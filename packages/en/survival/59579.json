This should be cleaned every day,\r\nand straw several inches thick spread over a part of it, especially\r\nwhere geese and ducks are shut up, for the purpose of giving them\r\ngood beds to sit in. As often as the litter gets soiled, remove it,\r\nand put clean straw in its place. A constant supply of food and water\r\nshould now be kept before them, allowing the fowls to eat and drink as\r\noften and as much as they please. Gravel is indispensable for their\r\nhealth, and charcoal, together with a little lime or ground bones, is\r\nbeneficial. Fowls fat better when they can get at their food as often\r\nas they please, and are not so apt to gorge themselves and become\r\nsurfeited.\r\n\r\nFor feed we prefer corn mostly; a little wheat, rye, or barley, is\r\nalso very well as a change; oats have rather too much husk about\r\nthem. In addition to these, boiled potatoes, sweet apples, pumpkins,\r\nand sugar beet, are excellent food, especially when mixed with a due\r\nproportion of mush or hasty pudding. Where sweet potatoes abound, they\r\nare an excellent substitute for the last. To the above, add daily a\r\nlittle lean meat, that which is cooked is preferred; and the last\r\nweek of their fattening, for a finishing process, rice boiled in milk\r\nand sweetened with molasses, is very excellent. This may be called an\r\nexpensive method; but our readers may be assured that the fowls will be\r\nenough better to pay for it. Meat derives much of its taste from the\r\nkind and quality of food that the animals consume; hence gross, fatty\r\nsubstances, fish, or anything that is disagreeable to the taste should\r\nbe avoided in the food given to fowls during the fattening process,\r\nas these invariably impart more or less of their disagreeable flavor\r\nto the flesh of the poultry fed upon them. It is well known that the\r\ncelebrated canvass-back duck derives its delicacy of taste from feeding\r\non the bulbous roots of a peculiar grass growing in the Chesapeake\r\nbay, and that other kinds of ducks are scarcely eatable, in consequence\r\nof their living almost entirely upon fish. These remarks will hold good\r\nto most kinds of birds, both of the water and land, and, indeed, of\r\nall animals; accordingly as their food is good or bad, so will be the\r\nquality of the milk, meat, or eggs.\r\n\r\nWe recollect when a boy, of having occasionally seen geese and ducks\r\nnailed through the webs of their feet to planks and floors, and hens\r\nand turkeys tied up and so closely confined to stakes, that they could\r\nnot exercise. This was done so that they might fat the faster! How\r\nshockingly barbarous, and any one guilty of such a practice in these\r\ndays, ought to be indicted, and severely punished for their cruelty and\r\ncupidity. We are totally opposed to the close confinement of beast or\r\nbird. Without exercise, the system can not be in a healthy state; and\r\nthe meat of close confined animals is never as good, to say the least\r\nof it, as when they have plenty of fresh air, and are allowed to move\r\nmoderately about.\r\n\r\nThe best method of killing fowls, is to cut their heads off at a single\r\nblow with a sharp axe, and then hang them up and allow them to bleed\r\nfreely. By this process they never know what hurts them, or endure pain\r\nfor a second. Wringing the necks of poultry is almost as shocking as\r\nnailing their feet to planks for the purpose of fattening them, and\r\nfollows in the same barbarous category.\r\n\r\nScalding the fowl previous to picking, injures the feathers, and\r\nmakes it troublesome to dry them, and we think the quality of flesh\r\nis somewhat injured by this process, especially if the weather be not\r\npretty cold at the time. They should be picked as soon as possible\r\nafter being killed, and their offal taken from them; be clean rinsed\r\nthen in cold water, and hung up to dry, and kept as separate as\r\npossible till sold; packing them together in heaps injures the flesh.\r\nTo be hung up and frozen for a few days, or even weeks before eating,\r\nmakes the flesh more tender. To keep them the same length of time after\r\nroasting, especially if well stuffed, also adds to their delicacy of\r\ntaste and tenderness.\r\n\r\nWhen the bird is brought on to the table, it is perfectly shocking to\r\nsee its head, legs, and feet, left upon it, though we know in many\r\nplaces this is fashionable, and considered highly genteel; but for\r\nour own part we detest such offal, and the sight of them frequently\r\ndestroys our appetite for the time being. The process of carving also\r\nat the table is a dead bore. We like the French fashion of cutting up\r\nthe bird in the kitchen or at a side table, and having it passed round\r\non the dish, every one then helping himself to such pieces as he likes\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILITY OF SEA-MUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-MUD varies greatly in its composition, dependant something upon\r\nthe soil of the neighboring uplands. It is considered a valuable\r\nmanure in Europe, and is sought for with avidity, and transported not\r\nunfrequently considerable distances into the interior. We have seen\r\nit used with good effect in the United States, from Massachusetts to\r\nPennsylvania; and are told that in Delaware and Maryland, and even\r\nfarther south, it is highly prized by those who have tried it. On Long\r\nIsland, the past summer, we were occasionally shown the fertilising\r\nresults, not only of sea-mud, but of the marsh soil also, applied to\r\nthe uplands a little removed from the borders of the marshes and the\r\nseashore. Our intelligent correspondent, Mr. Partridge, informs us he\r\nhas used beach-mud in various ways with good effect; and that the past\r\nsummer, two gentlemen whose country seats border his mill, were allowed\r\nto make use of the sediment from the tide mill-pond, and they found it\r\nadded greatly to the productiveness of their gardens.\r\n\r\nSea-mud may be applied in different ways, according to its\r\nconstituents. If it abounds with clay, it should be taken in the fall\r\nof the year, and spread broad-cast upon the land, and thus lie exposed\r\nto the action of the frost all winter. This pulverises it well, and\r\nin the spring of the year the roller should be passed over it in\r\ndry weather, followed by the harrow, and if any lumps remain after\r\nthis operation, let them be beaten fine with the dung-beater. This\r\nis considered one of the best top dressings for grass land which can\r\nbe given; it also answers well to be plowed in for either grain or\r\nroot crops. Where the mud abounds more with sand, it is an excellent\r\nthing to put into barn yards and pig-styes, to be incorporated with\r\nthe litter and manure; it may likewise be thrown into a heap until it\r\nbecomes completely pulverised, and then spread upon the land.\r\n\r\nAs air-slacked lime or small broken lime can be obtained in this city\r\nfor about half the price of quick lime, Mr. Partridge suggests that\r\nit would be an excellent ingredient to mix with the sea-mud, for\r\nthe purpose of forming a compost. A bushel or two of the lime, to a\r\ncart-load of the mud, he thinks a good mixture. When it abounds with\r\nconsiderable vegetable matter, we would recommend a greater proportion\r\nof lime, say from one to ten or twenty parts. Ashes and charcoal dust\r\nare excellent ingredients to mix with sea-mud, and when either of these\r\nor lime is used to form a compost, they make it much more lasting. It\r\nis less labor to transport the sea-mud directly to the place where it\r\nis to be used, and spread it broad-cast at once upon the land; and as\r\nthe saving of labor is quite an object in our country, we have found\r\nthat this method of applying it is the most generally practised.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few of our more intelligent farmers, sea-mud\r\nand marsh-mud as fertilizers, are not valued as highly as they ought\r\nto be in the United States. They exist in immense quantities all along\r\nour seaboard, and may be had in an unlimited extent for the mere labor\r\nof transportation. We hope that some experiments may hereafter be made\r\nwith them by some of our readers on the different kinds of crops, and\r\nthat they will give us the results. The time, we think, is approaching,\r\nwhen sea-mud and marsh-soil will be as highly prized here as they now\r\nare in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF THE WEST.--NO. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTATION OF MR. GREY.--One of the best plantations, especially\r\nfor its farm-buildings, which we visited in Kentucky, was that of\r\nMr. Benjamin Grey of Versailles. The house, as is usual in the more\r\nsouthern states, stands near the centre of the domain on rising ground,\r\nand commands a fine view of the country around. It is in cottage\r\nstyle, large and roomy, and flanked by thick, strong chimneys, built\r\nup outside of the gable ends. A pretty yard of smooth green-sward,\r\ndecked with shrubbery and evergreens, is enclosed around with pointed\r\nwhite palings, and adjoining this is a noble park, formed by merely\r\nunderbrushing and thinning out a few of the trees of the original\r\nforest. These are usually termed wood-land pastures in Kentucky; yet\r\nin most instances, they better deserve the name of park, than many of\r\nthose on noblemen's estates in Europe.\r\n\r\nCROPS.--Mr. Grey's farm being principally devoted to stock, and what\r\nis rather unusual here, dairy products, the crops are but a secondary\r\nconsideration. Hemp is the main one to which he gives his attention;\r\nand in addition to this, he raises a sufficiency of corn and the\r\nsmaller grains for his own consumption. The rotation is much like that\r\ndescribed in our first volume, under head of Tours in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nSTOCK.--This is very fine indeed, Mr. Grey having been highly spirited\r\nin this matter. His Short-Horns are choice, and quite numerous. We\r\nparticularly admired the cow Mary Ann, with the calf at her foot. She\r\nhas a fashionable and airy form; an up-head, and deer-like action;\r\nhandles well, and in addition to all these, we were informed that she\r\nis an excellent milker. Three heifers of her produce we also admired;\r\nthe two youngest were strikingly like their dam. After the Short-Horns,\r\nwe were shown a few good Cotswold, and South-Down sheep, imported\r\ndirect from England by Messrs. Bagg & Wait of Orange Co., in this\r\nstate. The stock-hogs are a cross of the Berkshire upon the Thin-Rinds,\r\n(a grade Chinese), and they make excellent porkers.\r\n\r\nFARM BUILDINGS.--These are among the most complete we have seen in any\r\nplace, and we speak of them with the more pleasure, because they are\r\nblameably deficient in farm buildings throughout the whole southwest.\r\nThe climate here, it is true, is warmer and much more open than at the\r\nnorth; but it is in this _very openness_, that consists the principal\r\nsuffering of the stock. The ground during this time is muddy, cold, and\r\ndamp; and worse, consequently, for animals to repose upon, than when\r\nfrozen dry, or covered with snow. Sudden changes are continually taking\r\nplace. Mild weather prevails for a few days, relaxing the system; this\r\nis then followed not unfrequently by intense cold; the thermometer\r\nsinking in 48 hours from 55° or 60° above, to zero, and sometimes 8° to\r\n10° below it. These sudden changes are very injurious to man and beast,\r\nand far more to be dreaded than the steady cold of northern latitudes;\r\nand for this reason, more attention should be paid to the warmth of\r\ntheir dress on the part of the people here, and to the housing of\r\nstock, than is generally done. It would lessen disease, add to their\r\nlongevity, and give a handsomer, fuller, and more healthful physical\r\nappearance. But to return more immediately to our subject.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the usually reserved gangway on the barn-floor,\r\nthe lower story is devoted to stables. These are planked, and each\r\nanimal is accommodated with a separate stall. Behind them is a shallow\r\ngutter, running the whole length of the stable, which conducts the\r\nliquid falling from the animals into a cess-pool in the yard, and is\r\nthere absorbed by muck. The solid manure is also equally carefully\r\nsaved and applied to the land, and notwithstanding the proverbial\r\nfertility of the soil of Kentucky, Mr. Grey assured us that he\r\nconsidered himself well paid in the increase of his crops, for the\r\nlabor employed in thus saving and applying his manure. Over-head in the\r\nbarn are lofts for hay and straw; a straw-cutter to prepare them for\r\nfeeding; cribs and bins for grain; and a large square box with heavy\r\nwooden pounders, for the hands to pound up corn and cob into meal on\r\nrainy days, when they can do nothing else. This cob-meal is usually\r\nmixed up with water, and allowed to stand till it ferments, and is then\r\nfed to the stock.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY.--This is a sufficiently roomy building, of one story,\r\nsituated in a little dell a short distance from the mansion. One of\r\nthe gable ends abuts against a nearly perpendicular cliff, out of\r\nwhich bursts a clear gurgling spring, that takes its course through\r\nthe centre of the rocky floor of the dairy, and then finds its way\r\ninto the valley below. Here is every convenience for making butter and\r\ncheese, in which Mr. Grey excels. We have dwelt thus minutely on the\r\nplantation, stock, and buildings of Mr. Grey, because we consider them\r\nan excellent example to follow in Kentucky; and also for the purpose\r\nof giving our northern readers a general idea of the husbandry at the\r\nwest, of which the great majority entertain the most indefinite notions\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nMR. HART'S PLANTATION.--After taking an early dinner, Mr. Grey ordered\r\nup his buggy, and we started for Mr. Nathaniel Hart's. This was some\r\nfew miles off, yet in order to get there we paid no attention to the\r\npublic roads, but took our way over gentle hill and dale, through\r\nwoodland-pastures, and among fields containing a hundred acres or more\r\nin each, under a single fence. For the purpose of opening and shutting\r\nthe field-gates as we passed, we were accompanied by an ebony urchin,\r\nas out-rider, mounted on the bare back of a high-spirited gray nag,\r\nwhich he rode with no little address. This seemed quite a gala business\r\nfor him; and bare-headed, with his thick woolly locks fluttering in\r\nthe wind, and his shirt-collar wide open, he went grinning along,\r\nnow advancing at a hard gallop, and anon closing up at a fast trot,\r\nswinging open and shutting to the gates, shaking his pate, and\r\nhallooing to every animal that he thought did not move with sufficient\r\nalacrity from our destined path.\r\n\r\n\"Yo! ho! So you no move, Misser Cow--then Pompey make you,\" and at\r\nher he charged, brandishing a long stick, like a Cossack of the Don\r\nwith his spear, the gray nag at the same time laying back his ears,\r\nand opening his mouth, and showing his teeth, as if grinning in fiery\r\nsympathy with his redoubtable rider, and ready to devour the animal\r\nthat so sluggishly obstructed the path. But one look from the cow, or\r\nwhatever beast it might be, at the horse and boy, seemed quite enough;\r\nand without waiting further hints, they would shake their tails, then\r\ngive them a slight curl, and set off at a round scamper, the triumphant\r\nPompey following up their career a short distance, singing with high\r\nsatisfaction:--\r\n\r\n  I tell you so, now Misser Cow;\r\n  Yo, ho, you go, bow wow, bow wow.\r\n\r\nMr. Hart's plantation is a very fine one, and he is one of the largest\r\nhemp-growers in Kentucky. He has done much to introduce a system of\r\nwater-rotting hemp in ponds, which we think is the best and most simple\r\nof the kind yet tried. He has promised us a description of this, with\r\nhis late improvements, and we trust that we shall be favored with it\r\nsoon, for the benefit of those desirous of preparing their hemp for\r\nmarket by the pond-water-rotting process. There is so much in common\r\nwith Kentucky plantations, that it is unnecessary to dwell further upon\r\nparticulars. Mr. Hart's stock of cattle is principally derived from the\r\nfirst importation of the Short-Horns into Kentucky, in 1817. He keeps\r\na flock of about 800 Merino sheep, which, low as wool is, he thinks\r\nmake him as good, if not a better return, than anything else which his\r\nplantation produces. Sheep-husbandry is attracting much attention at\r\npresent in Kentucky. It is a very superior region indeed, for sheep,\r\nand if the planters would go judiciously into the fine-woolled breeds,\r\nwool would soon become an article of large export with them, and a\r\nsource of considerable profit. Let it be remembered, that the cheaper\r\nand better wool can be produced, the more there will be consumed of it;\r\nand the cheaper and better, woollen cloths will be furnished in return.\r\nWe need not fear overstocking the country in our generation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hart keeps quite a herd of deer in his park, and several head of\r\nelk. These last, with their large branching horns, and lofty, erect\r\nheads, have a noble appearance. He formerly had a few buffaloes, but\r\nthey became so troublesome in breaking down fences, and sallying out\r\nwhenever they pleased, to the great terror of the country round,\r\nthat he was at last obliged to kill them. Buffalo bulls get somewhat\r\nferocious as they grow old, and are rather dangerous animals on the\r\nplantation. While in Kentucky, we picked up some comic anecdotes of\r\ntheir doings as they turned out; but a feather's weight in the other\r\nscale might have made them equally tragical; and upon the whole, unless\r\nenclosed within a fence that they could not break down, we should\r\nadvise our friends to eschew keeping buffaloes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDS OF FOWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN perusing the American Poultry Book, which we noticed in our October\r\nNo., we find the following recommendation for selecting a stock for the\r\npoultry-yard:--\r\n\r\n The better practice would seem to be, in order to make the\r\n poultry-yard most profitable, to select _no particular breed_.\r\n Commence with pullets and cocks of the first year, of all the breeds\r\n mentioned above, except bantams, and without any regard to color\r\n excepting those of a pure white. It would be well, if possible, to\r\n select the cocks from the same yard. Every year exchange a nest-full\r\n of eggs with your neighbors, or such as have good fowls. By pursuing\r\n steadily this practice of exchanging eggs, you will yearly infuse new\r\n blood into your stock, and avoid the inconvenience of breeding in and\r\n in. Without being aware of this fact, many farmers find their stock\r\n _running out_, &c.\r\n\r\nNow the above plan for forming a stock for the poultry-yard we hold\r\nto be perfectly absurd, and one might with just the same propriety,\r\nadvise mingling all the different breeds of horses or cattle together,\r\nfor the purpose of forming a good stock, as the different varieties\r\nof fowls; and we need only consider for one moment, the incongruity\r\nof the materials which form them, to be convinced of this. There is\r\nthe pugnacious Gamecock; the pheasant-shaped Top-knot; the coarse\r\nMalay; the thick-skinned Negro-fowl; the tender Chinese or Merino;\r\nthe tailless Rumpless; the Friesland, with reversed feathers; the\r\nshort-legged Creeper; the five-toed Dorking; &c., &c.; all thrown\r\ninto one helter-skelter mass, the progeny of which would prove as\r\ncontemptible a race of mongrels as ever graced a dung-hill, and beyond\r\nthe precincts of a dung-hill they would scarcely be worth removing.\r\n\r\nThose who have most eminently succeeded in breeding fowls, have\r\nadopted the same course in doing so, which is followed by judicious\r\nbreeders of animals; and that is, by sticking to the breed, when it\r\nis a good one, in its utmost purity; choosing the best of the flock\r\nfrom which to propagate, and thus continuing. In-and-in breeding, to a\r\ncertain extent, when pursued by those who thoroughly understand their\r\nbusiness, has been productive of the best results. The finest, the\r\nlargest, and the most _indomitable_ game-cocks have thus been bred;\r\nand if we possessed a good breed of poultry of any kind, we should be\r\nvery careful how we exchanged eggs with our neighbors for the purpose\r\nof improving them. If they had a superior stock to our own, of the\r\nsame breed, we would select from among them grown birds only; we\r\nshould then know what we got, and be able to make improvements upon\r\nthose we already possessed. It is by mingling all sorts of breeds\r\ntogether, without any definite notion as to the results, that \"many\r\nfarmers find their stock _running out_\"; and if every one were to\r\nfollow this course, we should soon be without a single good fowl in our\r\npoultry-yards. We really regret to see a book like this on American\r\nPoultry, which in the main is a good little work, recommend such a\r\ncourse of breeding; for in our humble judgment it is the very worst\r\nwhich could be pursued.\r\n\r\nWe can not say that we much like the author's advice either, as to the\r\nchoice of a cock. Why he should be \"restless, not very large, with a\r\nthick and stout bill, long spurs,\" &c., we can not divine. The best\r\ncocks we ever kept, and those of the most indomitable courage, when\r\nfighting was necessary, were the most quiet, attentive, and polite in\r\ntheir seraglio: they were also of rather large size for their breed;\r\nwith fine heads, bills, feet, and legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK FARMERS' CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMERS' Club resumed their meetings, on Tuesday, Nov. 13th, at the\r\nRepository of the American Institute.\r\n\r\nThe meeting commenced by reading a communication from the President\r\nof the Manhattan Gas Light Company, David C. Colden, Esq., inviting\r\nthe attention of farmers, and all interested in agriculture, to the\r\nvalue of the refuse of gas-works as manure. Extracts from the works\r\nof Liebig, and Johnston were then read, setting forth the powerful\r\nfertilizing properties of ammoniacal liquor, with which the refuse of\r\ngas-works is found to be strongly impregnated. After some conversation\r\non the subject, in which Mr. Stevens, Commodore De Kay, Mr. Meigs, and\r\nMr. Wakeman, took part, as to the best method of disposing of this\r\ncommunication, it was resolved that it be referred to a committee\r\nconsisting of Gen. Tallmadge, Mr. Prince, Gen. Johnson, Col. Clarke,\r\nand Mr. Townsend, to report at the next meeting of the club.\r\n\r\nMr. William R. Prince, of Flushing, presented to the meeting, specimens\r\nof nineteen different varieties of apples, among which were several of\r\nvery large size and superior quality.\r\n\r\nMr. Meigs presented seeds of a new variety of squash, the _Cucurbitur\r\nbicolor_.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, cuttings from a vine which produced ripe Isabella grapes on\r\nthe 5th September.\r\n\r\nA desultory conversation then ensued as to the future proceedings\r\nof the club. Much diversity of opinion appeared to exist as to the\r\npropriety of holding the meetings weekly, fortnightly, or monthly, when\r\na committee was appointed to report upon the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Field next called the attention of the club to a subject which\r\nhe considered deserving their serious attention, viz: the present\r\ncondition of the children now in the alms-house on Long Island. He\r\nthought they might be employed advantageously to themselves and\r\nthe public, either in the cultivation of the mulberry, and general\r\nmanagement of silk, or in horticultural occupations. He then proceeded\r\nto describe with feeling eloquence, their present deplorable condition,\r\nboth morally and physically, arising from the system of idleness they\r\nare now allowed to pursue.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Carter, who both agreed that it\r\nwas high time some steps should be taken to ameliorate the condition of\r\nthe poor children, and it was finally resolved:\r\n\r\nThat a committee consisting of Dr. Field, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Carter,\r\nbe appointed to investigate the subject, and petition the corporation\r\nthat the pauper children of this city, now on the Long Island farm, be\r\nemployed in horticultural pursuits generally, and also in the raising\r\nand manufacture of silk.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens then made some remarks on the subject of wax-flowers and\r\nfruits, a specimen of which was exhibited by Mr. Lane. Mr. Stevens\r\nthought that a model of every new variety of fruit ought to be taken in\r\nwax, and preserved at the Repository of the Institute.\r\n\r\nA motion was made and carried that the executive committee be\r\ninstructed to consider the subject.\r\n\r\nGen. Tallmadge suggested that a list of donors of fruits, &c., be\r\nkept by the secretary, and placed on the records of the club at every\r\nmeeting, which was unanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe meeting then adjourned to Tuesday, the 28th November.\r\n\r\nThe following are the extracts on refuse gas, sent to the club by the\r\nPresident of the Manhattan Gas-Light Company:--\r\n\r\n \"If the properties of manure, and its agency upon the growth of the\r\n vegetable world, can be explained by chemistry, we shall find the\r\n ammoniacal liquor produced in gas-works, to be a valuable substitute\r\n for those manures, by the application of which it is intended to\r\n supply the soil with nitrogen.\r\n\r\n \"One of the most valuable manures is urine, and its excellence\r\n depends almost entirely upon the ammoniacal salts which it holds in\r\n solution. The relative value of urine as manure, depends upon the\r\n quantity of nitrogen the different kinds yield. Thus human urine is\r\n the most esteemed, and that of horned animals the least.\"--_Clegg's\r\n Treatise on Gas-Making._\r\n\r\nAccording to Liebig, 547 pounds of human excrement contain 16.41 pounds\r\nof nitrogen; a quantity sufficient to yield the nitrogen of 800 pounds\r\nof wheat, rye, oats, or of 900 pounds of barley. How much more, then,\r\nwill be supplied from an equal weight of ammoniacal liquor!\r\n\r\nMr. J. Watson, the manager of the gas-works at Kirriemuir, has favored\r\nme with the following facts:--\r\n\r\n \"The ammoniacal liquor on the surface of the tar-well has been found\r\n a very great improvement as a manure for raising crops of grass in\r\n this quarter, by being sprinkled on the field in the same way as\r\n water is put on public streets in large towns, to keep down dust in\r\n dry weather. I have myself seen an experiment of this tried, and\r\n can say that part of a field of grass sprinkled in this way, after\r\n the first cutting, was far superior to any other part of the field\r\n receiving manure of any other kind, and that the part so sprinkled, or\r\n showered over, was ready to be cut down a second time in the course\r\n of between fourteen days and three weeks; whereas, the other part\r\n of the field cut at the same time, was only beginning to spring or\r\n rise from the roots in that time. It must be mixed up before use with\r\n four parts of common water. In particular, the said experiment of the\r\n gas-water has been used by David Nairn, Esq., Doumkilba, near Meigle,\r\n in this neighborhood, with success; and I am informed that he has\r\n purchased and taken a lease of the ammoniacal liquor from different\r\n gas-companies in this country.\r\n\r\n \"I am convinced much good might be derived from different qualities\r\n of the refuse products of gas-works as manure. An inquiry into this\r\n subject would remunerate the engineer or agriculturist to the full,\r\n and would besides confer a considerable benefit upon his fellows, and\r\n give that practical proof of the correctness of a theory so welcome to\r\n the man of science.\"\r\n\r\n \"The fertilizing power of gypsum has been explained by its supposed\r\n action on the ammonia which is presumed to exist in the atmosphere. If\r\n this be the true explanation, a substance containing ammonia should\r\n act _at least_ as energetically. At all events, the action of foldyard\r\n manure and of putrid urine, is supposed to depend chiefly on the\r\n ammonia they contain or give off.\r\n\r\n \"Now among the substances containing ammonia in large quantity,\r\n the ammoniacal liquor of the gas-works is one which can easily be\r\n obtained, and can be applied in a liquid state at very little cost. It\r\n must be previously diluted with water till its taste and smell become\r\n scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\n \"I would propose therefore, as a further experiment, that along with\r\n one or more of the substances above mentioned, the ammoniacal liquor\r\n of the gas-works should be tried, on a measured portion of ground,\r\n and, if possible, in the same field.\r\n\r\n \"Soot as a manure is supposed to act partly, if not chiefly in\r\n consequence of the ammonia it contains. In Gloucestershire, it is\r\n applied to potatoes and to wheat, chiefly to the latter, and with\r\n great success. In the wolds of Yorkshire it is also applied largely to\r\n the wheat-crop. In this country it is frequently used on grass land. I\r\n am not aware that it is extensively used on clover. I am inclined to\r\n anticipate that the sulphur it contains, in addition to ammonia, would\r\n render it useful to this plant. At all events comparative experiments\r\n in the same field with the gypsum and the ammoniacal liquor, are\r\n likely to lead to interesting results.\r\n\r\n * * * \"Of ammoniacal liquor 100 or 200 gallons per acre, according\r\n to its strength, for this is constantly varying. It must also be\r\n diluted with so large a quantity of water as will render it perfectly\r\n tasteless, and is likely to prove most beneficial if laid on at\r\n several successive periods.\"--_Johnston's Agricultural Chemistry_,\r\n part 1.\r\n\r\n \"Sal ammoniac is probably too expensive an article to be employed;\r\n but sulphate of ammonia may be had of the wholesale chemist at a\r\n price considerably more reasonable, and the ammoniacal liquor of\r\n the gas-manufactories, through the distillation of coal, is a still\r\n cheaper commodity.\"--_Liebig's Agricultural Chemistry._\r\n\r\n \"Its efficacy as a manure is vouched for by many who have made trial\r\n of it upon their land. See a communication by Mr. Paynter on gas-water\r\n as a manure.\"--_Journal Royal Ag. Soc._, No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT ANNUAL SHOW OF THE STATE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the annual show of the New York State Agricultural Society is now\r\nsure to bring fifteen to twenty thousand strangers into the place where\r\nit may be held, to pass three or four days there, and spend their\r\nmoney pretty freely, it has become quite an object with the different\r\ntowns situated on the great thoroughfares, to have the exhibitions\r\nwithin their boundaries as often as possible. Strong movements will\r\nbe made for these hereafter; but we trust that the Society will weigh\r\nwell the different claims preferred for its favor, and that no other\r\nconsideration than the public good, and the spread of its influence,\r\nwill have weight in its decisions.\r\n\r\nAlbany, Syracuse, and Rochester, each having had the advantage of one\r\nof these meetings, other towns now are soliciting the like favor; and\r\namong those which are preferring their claims for the show of 1844,\r\nwe understand that Buffalo, Utica, and Poughkeepsie, are the most\r\nprominent. Perhaps as the northern and western parts of the State have\r\nnow had the benefit of three of the exhibitions of the Society, it\r\nis no more than fair that some attention be paid to the southern and\r\neastern portions. We have heard this city named as a very suitable\r\nplace for the show of next year, and the only objection we can\r\nanticipate to it is, that it is an extreme end of the State. Granted;\r\nand is not Buffalo the same? Yet, notwithstanding this, we contend that\r\nNew York or Buffalo is just as fairly entitled in their turn to one\r\nof the exhibitions of the Society, as Albany, Syracuse, or Rochester.\r\nHowever, as our own interests might be somewhat served by a meeting of\r\nthe State Society in this city, we shall waive advocating its claims\r\nto one for the present, and content ourselves with stating those of\r\nPoughkeepsie.\r\n\r\n1. This town is 210 miles by the usual travelled route, northwest from\r\nMontauk Point, the southeast end of the State. This is as great a\r\ndistance as from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse, and 41 miles further than\r\nthe railroad route, though a circuitous one, from Syracuse to Buffalo;\r\nso that it may fairly be said to be the hither-end of a third-part of\r\nthe limits of the State.\r\n\r\n2. The population, from Dutchess county, south and east, includes about\r\none fourth of that of the whole State.\r\n\r\n3. Poughkeepsie is easy of access by land or water, and being situated\r\non the Hudson, hundreds of strangers from the neighboring States,\r\nespecially the southern ones, would visit a show here, when they could\r\nhardly be induced to go farther north or west, and as these visiters\r\nare always purchasers to a greater or less extent, it is quite an\r\nobject to get them to attend.\r\n\r\n4. This town is the capital of one of the oldest, wealthiest, and\r\nmost populous counties of the State, and the one whose general system\r\nof agriculture is probably more highly advanced than any other.\r\nDutchess, and the neighboring counties, have also considerable improved\r\nstock--much more than we had any idea of till our recent excursions in\r\nthese parts. Durham, Devon, and Ayrshire cattle abound; superior road\r\nand blood horses; Cotswold, Leicester, South Down, and numerous flocks\r\nof Merino sheep; the products of the dairy; agricultural implements,\r\nand roots, seeds, fruits, flowers, and domestic fabrics.\r\n\r\n5. Poughkeepsie is ready at her own expense, to build pens for the\r\nstock, and furnish all other needful accommodation for the Society,\r\nwhich will be a saving of expense to it of at least $1,000.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is more accumulated wealth in the southern, than other\r\nparts of the State, and the Society, by holding a fair proportion of\r\nits shows in this quarter, will make itself many staunch friends, and\r\nbe introduced to thousands, who would otherwise be ignorant of its\r\ngreat public merits. The Agricultural Society of the State of New York\r\nis looked up to as an example throughout the country, and it should\r\nbe careful to avoid even the appearance of being partial or local in\r\nits proceedings. The national societies of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nadopt the course of holding their shows in, not only the central, but\r\nthe extreme parts of the kingdom; and this is one great reason of their\r\npopularity among all classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTour in England. No. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHINKING that our readers had become somewhat satiated with so\r\nmuch upon foreign matters as have hitherto found place in this\r\njournal, we had desisted for several months past, giving sketches\r\nof the agriculture of England; but having recently received so many\r\nsolicitations to continue them, we again take up the subject, and shall\r\npursue it pretty regularly through the whole of our third volume,\r\nif such seems to be the pleasure of a majority of our subscribers.\r\nPerhaps, to these, we may also add sketches of some things we saw in\r\nRussia, the recollections of which are very pleasant, at least to us,\r\nyet whether we shall make them equally so in relating them to others,\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\nCHATSWORTH, SEAT OF THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE.--In returning from\r\nYorkshire to London on the North Midland railroad, we stopped at\r\nthe Chesterfield station, for the purpose of making an excursion to\r\nChatsworth, to view the celebrated gardens and immense conservatory of\r\nthis superb place. It was a raw morning in August, and as we jumped\r\nfrom a confined seat in the rail-coach, we were glad to be on our feet\r\nonce more, and have an opportunity of rousing our blood by a smart walk\r\nfrom the station into the town. We stopped at the Angel inn, took a\r\nhearty breakfast, and while waiting a gig being made ready to convey us\r\nto Chatsworth, stepped out for a stroll over the place. Chesterfield\r\nis a dingy old town, of about 6,000 inhabitants, and has little to\r\nrecommend it to the notice of strangers, save the spire of All Saints'\r\nChurch. This rises to the height of 230 feet, is curiously channeled,\r\nand covered with lead, and is so much out of perpendicular, as to\r\nattract marked attention in passing it, even when at a considerable\r\ndistance. It being market-day, the town was thronged with farmers from\r\nthe country, exposing stock and agricultural products in the square\r\nfor sale. There was little in these, however, deserving particular\r\nattention, and after giving them a hasty look, we returned to the inn.\r\nAs we came up, a dapper waiter announced the \"oss and gig as _h_all\r\nready;\" when in we jumped, and set out for Chatsworth at a round pace,\r\ndistant, if we recollect right, about 8 miles.\r\n\r\nDerbyshire possesses the wildest and most broken scenery of any county\r\nin England, and after passing over the flat surface of Yorkshire, it\r\nwas quite a relief to find ourselves trotting up and down along a road\r\nwinding picturesquely around high hills, and over deep narrow dales. An\r\nhour's drive or so, brought us to the pretty little village of Edensor,\r\nclose by the inn of which, is the entrance to Chatsworth. The village\r\nis situated within the park, and is the property of the Duke, and\r\ncertainly it is the most charming one we ever saw. Every cottage is of\r\nstone, and no two alike in their architecture. One is a mimic Gothic\r\ncastle; another a cottage ornèe; a third in the Elizabethan, a fourth\r\nin the Swiss, and perhaps a fifth in the Tudor style. Everything then\r\nwas so complete about them--the pretty gardens full of flowers--the\r\nhedges so neatly trimmed--the yards, laid down with the greenest and\r\nsoftest of turf, and the shrubbery so tastefully planted! These were\r\nthe residences of the laborers on the estate, the possession of which\r\nany one might envy them, and desire to be able to call his home.\r\nAttached to the village is a fine old church, and around it an ample\r\nyard, handsomely walled in with strong mason-work. Altogether, this\r\nvillage is quite a gem in its way, and we were going to add, an epitome\r\nof its owner's heart; for on all his estates, whether in England or\r\nIreland, the Duke of Devonshire has made it a point to protect and\r\nbountifully provide for his people. There is no want, or suffering, or\r\nseeking the poor-house, by the tenantry, allowed by this kind-hearted,\r\nbenevolent man.\r\n\r\nTurning from Edensor, and ascending a mound-like hill to the left of\r\nthe carriage-road, the palace and the grounds of Chatsworth appear to\r\nthe greatest advantage. Immediately below is the river Derwent, tracing\r\nits sparkling course through a rich vale, where were perhaps 1,500 deer\r\nbrowsing or taking their gambols. A handsome stone bridge spans the\r\nriver, and just beyond, the ground rises in terraces to a narrow plain,\r\nwhere stand the noble palace, with its out-buildings, and the immense\r\nconservatory, in magnificent grandeur. Back of these rises a lofty\r\nhill, the steep sides of which are thickly planted with forest-trees,\r\nand the summit is crowned with a high tower of octagonal shape, built\r\nof stone. We were received at the palace-gate by a servant in handsome\r\nlivery, and passing into the gallery of the court, a fine hearty girl\r\nmade her appearance to conduct us over the building. The front of the\r\npalace is 350 feet, and one of the side wings about 400 feet long, and\r\nthis whole area contains a series of apartments called the drawing-room\r\nsuite. An entire number of this paper would hardly suffice to give\r\nthe reader a complete description of these magnificent rooms, and the\r\ntreasures of art they contain, we therefore pass them over in silence.\r\nFrom these we strolled into the orangery, which is about 30 feet wide,\r\nand 200 feet long. It is full of beautiful exotics, and among them\r\nwere several specimens of the Rhododendron Arboreum, which bore, the\r\npreceding summer, over 2,000 flowers. We now walked out to the lawn\r\nin front of the palace, where one of the under-gardeners appeared\r\nto conduct us over the grounds. These are extremely beautiful, with\r\nwalled terraces in the Italian style, and fountains. One jet d'eau\r\nthrows up a column 90 feet high. But the great show here in the way\r\nof water-works, is the cascade. It is entirely artificial, and must\r\nhave been made at a great expense. The water rushes out from a series\r\nof lakes on top of the hill, and comes pouring down its side, taking\r\na leap of about 80 feet from one of the arches, and then falls for a\r\nlength of 300 yards over a series of 24 ledges, and disappears amidst\r\nmasses of rock, on the edge of the lawn. Here it finds a subterranean\r\npassage to the river Derwent. These water-works are looked upon by some\r\ncritics with affected contempt; not so with us, however, we greatly\r\nadmired them in their way; and yet we have seen Niagara a thousand\r\ntimes, and had a peep at most of the other water-falls worth looking\r\nat in the United States. We have no sympathy with such hypercritics\r\nas profess a distaste to the cascade at Chatsworth: as a work of art,\r\nit is a magnificent thing, and to our eye, in keeping with the palace\r\nand grounds; and we viewed it with interest. A bronze tree a little\r\nfarther on, excited still greater curiosity with us than the cascade,\r\nfor it was made to act the part of a fountain, by throwing water from a\r\nthousand sprigs and leaves all around in a shower of spray.\r\n\r\nBut leaving this and the exquisite scenery of the lawn, we passed on by\r\na winding carriage-road to a short distance to the conservatory. This\r\nwas 350 feet long, 150 feet wide, and nearly 70 feet high; and when\r\nfully completed, is to have an additional length of 150 feet. The roof\r\nis an arch, and is covered with plate glass of the best kind, and so\r\nthick as to resist the heaviest hail. It is heated by iron tubes of hot\r\nwater, and to these are added others for cold water, and the whole,\r\nif stretched out to a single length, we were informed would extend\r\nnearly six miles. The plants and trees here are distributed in open\r\nborders, each class being placed in the soil most proper for it, and\r\nthe temperature so regulated as to suit their natural state as nearly\r\nas possible. Not far from the centre is an immense rockery rising about\r\n50 feet high, and from the fissures of the thick slabs of stone that\r\ncompose it, the cactus and other plants grow out as in their natural\r\nstate. Half way up this huge precipice is a little lake with islets,\r\nand in this, water-lilies and other aquatic plants of the rarest and\r\nmost beautiful kinds. A wild goat path leads to the top of the rockery,\r\nand beneath it is a wide, deep cave. The variety of shrubs and plants\r\nin this immense conservatory is very great; some of the trees already\r\nreach nearly to the top of the roof, and others presented dimensions\r\ngigantic in the extreme for those within a green-house. There are wide\r\nfolding-doors at each end of the conservatory, and any time he pleases,\r\nthe Duke can have a drive with his coach and four horses through it.\r\nTaking it altogether, it is by far the most magnificent thing of the\r\nkind we have ever seen. The whole cost of it is not less than half\r\na million of dollars, which is but a little over the present annual\r\nincome of its wealthy possessor.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the conservatory, we took a zig-zag road, and ascended\r\nthrough the forest to the crown of the hill by the octagonal tower.\r\nA peasant family was residing here, who permitted us to ascend it to\r\nthe top. The view from this is no less extensive than beautiful, of\r\nChatsworth and the wild broken country around. Descending from this\r\nhigh perch we had quite a chat with the peasant's wife. She informed\r\nus that the tower was built by a predecessor of the present Duke, for\r\nthe purpose of giving the ladies at the palace an opportunity of seeing\r\nthe fox-hunting which formerly took place at Chatsworth. Upon taking\r\nleave, the good woman directed a little rosy-faced daughter to show\r\nus the lakes on the hill, the sources of the cascade and fountains\r\nbelow. After something of a stroll through the woods, we found two\r\nlarge expanses of water belted in by thick rows of the larch and fir,\r\nand apparently as isolated as if in a wild forest of our own country.\r\nThe white swan and the black are kept here, and most other kinds of\r\ncurious water-fowl. Our pretty guide answered all our inquiries with\r\nintelligence, and at parting we gave her a small guerdon, for which she\r\nreturned a grateful \"thank'e zur\" and a low courtesy, and then, with\r\nthe lightness of a young fawn, skipped into the woods, and immediately\r\ndisappeared. Descending the hill toward the palace we came to the\r\nstables. These are very extensive, of quadrangular shape, and large\r\ncourtyards within. At a distance, with their imposing architecture,\r\nthey might almost pass for the palace itself.\r\n\r\nWe now bent our steps to the house of the celebrated Mr. Paxton, the\r\nhead gardener of the Duke of Devonshire, editor of the Magazine of\r\nBotany which bears his name, and one of the first botanists of England.\r\nHis residence is within the park, about a quarter of a mile from the\r\npalace, and is a roomy, beautiful cottage, completely enveloped in\r\nflowers and flowering shrubbery, with a handsome little conservatory at\r\nthe end. Much to our regret, he was not at home; but a sub-gardener,\r\nquite an intelligent man, volunteered to show us the gardens. They\r\noccupy 12 acres, and are enclosed by a thick, brick wall, about twelve\r\nfeet high. Here are the experimental and kitchen gardens, and hundreds\r\nof fruit-bearing espaliers, trained up the walls. In addition to these\r\nthere are forcing pits in abundance, and upward of 20 hot-houses, about\r\n300 feet long each, devoted to different purposes, one of the most\r\nextensive of which is the growing of pine apples. All these things may\r\nbe considered very extravagant, but in supporting them, the Duke of\r\nDevonshire has done much for the cause of science, and has conferred a\r\nlasting benefit on his country.\r\n\r\nWe left Chatsworth with regret; the day we spent there we would have\r\ngladly prolonged to a week, and then we should have gained but an\r\nimperfect knowledge of the treasures of nature and art which are stored\r\nup here for the admiration of thousands of visiters. Mary Queen of\r\nScots was some time a prisoner here; so also was Marshal Tallard, who\r\nwas captured at the battle of Blenheim. What were the thoughts of the\r\nbeautiful Queen upon taking leave of it, history does not record; but\r\nthe Marshal, no less gracefully than happily, said: \"When I return to\r\nFrance and reckon up the days of my captivity in England, I shall leave\r\nout all those I have spent at Chatsworth.\" And so thought we, pausing\r\non the mound-like hill again, as we retraced our steps to Edensor, and\r\ncast a last lingering look upon the park, and palace, and forest hills\r\nin the background, lit up by the clear, glorious sun just sinking\r\nbeneath the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL SHOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY held its annual show at the Lamb tavern,\r\nOctober 4, 5, and 6. The Germantown Telegraph states, in the _Report\r\nof the Committee of Arrangements_, that the display of horses was\r\nunusually attractive, exhibiting the various breeds for the turf, road,\r\nand farm, in considerable numbers. The Durham cattle seem at last to be\r\ngetting the better of prejudice in that quarter, and in their superior\r\nforms and deep milking qualities, have shamed nearly everything else\r\nfrom the ground, save a few fine Devons and capital grade Durham\r\nmilkers. Of sheep and swine, there were very few present, which is\r\nthe more to be regretted, as these animals exist in considerable\r\nnumbers and of superior breeds throughout the neighboring counties\r\nof Montgomery, Delaware, Chester, and Lancaster. Of Agricultural\r\nImplements and Products there was a good show, and the Plowing-Match\r\nproved an interesting affair. Peter A. Browne, Esq., delivered the\r\naddress, which we find at length in the Farmers' Cabinet. Among\r\nother things, he contends no less strenuously than justly for the\r\nestablishment of Agricultural schools and Professorships. From another\r\npart of the address we subjoin a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n First, then, it is feared that our agricultural friends have not yet\r\n paid _all_ the attention that the subject demands, to a judicious\r\n rotation of crops, adapted to our climate; particularly in regard to\r\n _roots_.\r\n\r\n Second. Much has been done, that is beyond all praise, in insuring the\r\n best breeds of cattle. While we hear pronounced with gratitude, the\r\n names of Mease, Powell, Brantz, Clay, Gowen, and Kelley, let us not\r\n forget that the task is not finished.\r\n\r\n Third. Soiling, it is apprehended, has been too much neglected by most\r\n American husbandmen.\r\n\r\n Fourth. Irrigation has also been too little attended to in the United\r\n States.\r\n\r\n Fifth. Proper care and precaution have not been sufficiently bestowed\r\n upon the selection of seeds. This is a subject of the greatest\r\n importance.\r\n\r\n Sixth. Much is yet to be learned in regard to the preservation and\r\n economical use of manure.\r\n\r\n Seventh. The introduction, more generally, of labor-saving machinery,\r\n and particularly of the itinerant thrashing-machine, deserves to be\r\n mentioned.\r\n\r\n Eighth. Gardening and raising fruit are much neglected by our farmers.\r\n\r\n It is respectfully suggested that special committees might, with\r\n advantage, be raised upon these and other useful topics, to report at\r\n the next annual meeting.\r\n\r\n Pennsylvania contains nearly thirty millions of acres. According to\r\n the census of 1840, she had a population of one million seven hundred\r\n and odd thousands, which is nineteen acres and a fraction for each\r\n inhabitant. In 1842, she raised, of grains of all kinds, upward of\r\n sixty millions of bushels; of potatoes, nearly thirteen millions of\r\n bushels; of hay, upward of two millions and a quarter of tons; of flax\r\n and hemp, upward of three thousand three hundred tons; of tobacco,\r\n four hundred and eighty thousand tons; of silk, upward of twenty-one\r\n thousand pounds; of sugar, nearly three millions and a half of pounds;\r\n and of wines, nearly eighteen thousand gallons.\r\n\r\nTHE HENRICO SOCIETY held its third annual show at Richmond, Virginia,\r\nNovember 1st. The proceedings are published in the Richmond Enquirer.\r\nThe Executive Committee reports, that although there is a falling off\r\nin its receipts, there is an increased interest and attention to its\r\nproceedings by the planters. Mr. C. T. Botts, Editor of the Southern\r\nPlanter, made the address, from which we subjoin an extract.\r\n\r\n This society was organized and has been chiefly supported by a few\r\n public-spirited gentlemen in the neighborhood. Its beneficial effects\r\n are felt and seen by all of you. To form a proper appreciation of\r\n them, you have only to ride in any direction about the suburbs of the\r\n city. Rude grounds have been converted into productive gardens, and\r\n barren wastes into smiling fields. I recollect a lady's saying to me\r\n last summer, that she meant to make her husband become a member of\r\n this society, because it had done so much to beautify the rides and\r\n walks about the city. She declared the time had been when it gave her\r\n a fit of the horrors, (she was a nervous lady,) to order her carriage\r\n for an evening drive; but that now, there was nothing that she and her\r\n children enjoyed so much. But this is not all. Let him who has been\r\n familiar with your market for the last eight or ten years, compare its\r\n present abundant supplies of the finest fruits and vegetables, with\r\n the meager exhibition of former days; and, after all, let us be as\r\n sentimental as we will, a good market plays a very important part in\r\n the comedy of human happiness. Our merchants and mechanics too should\r\n remember, that these exhibitions are annually becoming more and more\r\n attractive, and that they are by no means inefficient in increasing\r\n the trade of the city. But, over and above all considerations of\r\n dollars and cents, let us, one and all, come forward and enrol our\r\n names as members of this association, which represents the great\r\n agricultural interest of the state, and which should be the pride and\r\n ornament of its metropolis.\r\n\r\nLAKE COUNTY SOCIETY.--The show of this society took place at Medina,\r\nOhio, and a complete account of its proceedings may be found in the\r\nPainsville Telegraph. In addition to the usual show of stock, &c., an\r\nextensive procession was got up of wagons and carriages, preceded by\r\nbands of music. One of these held no less than 35 ladies, engaged in\r\nthe laudable occupations of knitting, sewing, spinning, and various\r\nother domestic employments. We wish we could chronicle more such\r\nindustrial displays, for we consider them an excellent feature in\r\nagricultural shows.\r\n\r\nBOURBON COUNTY SOCIETY OF KENTUCKY.--We learn from the Paris Citizen,\r\nthat the Eighth Annual show of this Society took place near Paris,\r\nand continued three days, and is said to be the largest and most\r\nvaried ever held in Kentucky. The first two days were devoted to the\r\nexhibition of domestic animals, agricultural products, and farming\r\nimplements; the third day, to that of domestic manufactures. The\r\nshow of horses present was considered very superior; they were of\r\nall varieties, from the mettlesome thorough-bred, to the enormous\r\ncart-horse. The Durhams and other horned stock were well represented,\r\nand gave evidence in their splendid proportions of the superiority of\r\nKentucky pastures. The descendants are said to be an improvement over\r\nthe original importations from England. Mr. Clay was present, and had a\r\nsuperb pair of blankets presented him by Mrs. James Hutchcraft. These\r\nwere made from the wool of Leicester sheep, and were of uncommon size\r\nand thickness, weighing 23 lbs. the pair. On the presentation of these\r\nblankets, Mr. Clay was addressed by the Hon. Garrett Davis, M. C., and\r\nhe replied in his usual elegant and happy manner.\r\n\r\nHAMPSHIRE, HAMPDEN, AND FRANKLIN SOCIETY, MASSACHUSETTS.--The united\r\nshow for the three wealthy and populous counties above, came off at\r\nthe beautiful town of Northampton, on the 18th and 19th October,\r\nand we much regret on more accounts than one, that we could not, be\r\npresent. The Boston Cultivator furnishes a full report. A large number\r\nof working-oxen of course were present, and to these were added some\r\nsuperb fat oxen, exhibited by Mr. Sumner Chapin. The committee who\r\nreported upon this subject, attributes the superiority of the cattle\r\nto the large infusion of Short-Horn blood in their veins, and hence\r\ntheir fine symmetry, light offal, and increased weight of flesh on the\r\nmore valuable parts, as compared with native stock when fattened for\r\nthe shambles. Mr. Paoli Lathrop exhibited some choice Short-Horns. Of\r\nnative cows the committee thus speak:--\r\n\r\n Of the ten cows entered for the premium as _native_ animals, nearly\r\n or all have an intermixture of Short-Horn or other foreign blood. We\r\n awarded to Mr. Minor Hitchcock the first premium in this class. In\r\n his written statement to us it appears that her average product in\r\n milk for the six months, ending 1st October, was 49 lbs. per day,\r\n and in the months of June and July, 58 lbs. per day. In butter, her\r\n average product in the same time was more than 11 lbs. per week,\r\n and in the month of July alone, nearly 14 lbs. per week; yet in the\r\n same time he used the necessary milk and cream for his family of\r\n four persons. Your committee have entire confidence in the statement\r\n of Mr. Hitchcock; yet it is proper here to remark, that from his\r\n account of her, and though awarded, a premium as a native animal, she\r\n partakes highly of the blood of the Short-Horns. In the two classes of\r\n animals entered as of _native and foreign origin_ it is obvious that\r\n a proper discrimination was not made; for in some of the former there\r\n is evidently more of the blood of distinct imported races than the\r\n latter. Yet your committee deemed it their duty to award the premiums\r\n of the society to the two classes as they found them.\r\n\r\nNow here it is, most everywhere that our native cows are found\r\nexcelling as milkers, we can trace a portion of their blood, (usually\r\nthe greatest share,) to the Durhams, and yet there are those who are\r\nconstantly decrying the Short-Horns for not being _milkers_. Verily\r\na few particular people are very hard to be convinced. It is our\r\nintention hereafter to make up a table of the milking qualities of the\r\nShort-Horns and their grades, and any one possessing information upon\r\nthis subject, we shall be glad by their communicating the same to us.\r\nMr. Paoli Lathrop of South Hadley took the first premiums on Durham\r\nbulls and heifers. Mr. Ira Fenton of Belchertown on Durham cows. Mr.\r\nSumner Chapin of Springfield, the first premiums on Fat Cattle and\r\nWorking-Oxen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALE OF RAMBOUILLET MERINOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Mr. Nathaniel Hart, Jr., of Kentucky, has just passed through this\r\ncity on his way home, having in company with him three Rambouillet\r\nMerino bucks, purchased of Mr. D. C. Collins of Hartford, Connecticut.\r\nMr. Hart has kept a large flock of the old-fashioned Merinos for\r\nsome time, on his plantation at Versailles, Woodford county, and has\r\npurchased these fine bucks, as the best animals which could be found,\r\nfor the purpose of making improvements upon them. Kentucky will have\r\nin these Rambouillets a valuable addition to her sheep stock, and we\r\nrecommend their produce in advance, to the breeders of the western\r\ncountry. We understand Mr. Collins has recently met with a great demand\r\nfor his sheep, and that he has now disposed of all he has to spare this\r\nyear. We congratulate him upon it, and take some credit to ourselves,\r\nfor calling public attention to his very valuable imported flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP-DOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n--The price of a well-broke sheep-dog is $25 to $30. They ought always\r\nto be accompanied by their shepherds, as they are taught to manage\r\nsheep in a peculiar way, which none but regularly-bred shepherds\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING OF THE N. Y. STATE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n--The annual meeting of the New York State Agricultural Society, will\r\nbe held at the Society's room in the Old State Hall, Albany, on the 3d\r\nWednesday, (the 17th,) of January, 1844, at 10 o'clock, A. M.\r\n\r\nPersons intending to compete for the Society's premiums on field-crops,\r\nessays, &c., are reminded that their statements and essays must be sent\r\nto the Recording Secretary, Albany, before the first of January.\r\n\r\nPresidents of County Agricultural Societies are also requested to\r\ntransmit the reports required by the statute, to the Recording\r\nSecretary, previous to the annual meeting.\r\n\r\n  LUTHER TUCKER, Rec.

It is taken from the directions accompanying the sets of\r\ninstruments for caponising, made by Mr. John Mendenhall, Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n FOWLS intended to be cut, must be kept at least twenty-four hours\r\n without food, otherwise the entrails will fill the cavity of the belly\r\n and render it almost impossible to complete the operation; besides,\r\n when they have been starved the proper length of time, they are less\r\n liable to bleed.\r\n\r\n The chicken is taken at any age, from five days old until it begins\r\n to crow, or even after. Lay the fowl on its left side on the floor,\r\n draw the wings back, and keep it firm by resting the right foot on its\r\n legs, and the other foot or knee on its wings. (The table with the\r\n apparatus does away with the necessity of this stooping position.) Be\r\n careful that the head of the fowl is not held down, or even touched\r\n during the operation, as it would be sure to cause it to bleed. Pluck\r\n the feathers off from its right side near the hip joint, in a line\r\n between that and the shoulder joint; the space uncovered should be a\r\n little more than an inch square. Make an incision between the two last\r\n ribs, having first drawn the skin of the part backward, so that when\r\n left to itself it will cover the wound in the flesh. In some fowls the\r\n thigh is so far forward that it covers the two last ribs; in which\r\n case, care must be taken to draw the flesh of the thigh well back, so\r\n as not to cut through it, or else it would lame the fowl, and perhaps\r\n cause its death in a few days after the operation, by inflaming.\r\n\r\n The ribs are to be kept open by the hooks--the opening must be\r\n enlarged each way by the knife, if necessary, until the testicles,\r\n which are attached to the back bone, are entirely exposed to view,\r\n together with the intestines in contact with them. The testicles are\r\n enclosed in a thin skin, connecting them with the back and sides--this\r\n must be laid hold of with the pliers, and then torn away with the\r\n pointed instrument; doing it first on the upper testicle, then on the\r\n lower. (The lower testicle will generally be found a little behind the\r\n other--that is, a little nearer the rump.) Next introduce the loop;\r\n (which is made of a horse-hair or a fibre of cocoa-nut;) it must be\r\n put round the testicle which is uppermost, in doing which the spoon is\r\n serviceable to raise up the testicle and push the loop under it, so\r\n that it shall be brought to act upon the part which holds the testicle\r\n to the back; then tear it off by pushing the tube toward the rump of\r\n the fowl, at the same time drawing the loop. Then scoop it and the\r\n blood out with the spoon, and perform the same operation on the other\r\n testicle. Take away the hooks, draw the skin over and close the wound;\r\n stick the feathers that you pulled off before on the wound, and let\r\n the bird go.\r\n\r\n REMARKS.--If the operation be performed without sufficient skill, many\r\n of the fowls will prove not to be capons; these may be killed for use\r\n as soon as the head begins to grow large and get red, and they begin\r\n to chase the hens. The real capon will make itself known by the head\r\n remaining small, and the comb small and withered; the feathers of the\r\n neck or mane will also get longer, and the tail will be handsomer and\r\n longer: they should be kept to the age of fifteen or eighteen months,\r\n which will bring them in the spring and summer, when poultry is scarce\r\n and brings a high price. Take care, however, not to kill them near\r\n moulting time, as all poultry then is very inferior. The operation\r\n fails, principally, by bursting the testicle, so that the skin which\r\n encloses the soft matter, remains in the bird, and the testicle grows\r\n again.\r\n\r\n Birds of five or six months are less liable to have the testicles\r\n burst in the operation than younger fowls, but they are also more apt\r\n to bleed to death than those of from two to four months old.\r\n\r\n A skilful operator will always choose fowls of from two to three\r\n months;--he will prefer also, to take off the lower testicle first, as\r\n then the blood will not prevent him from proceeding with the other;\r\n whereas, when the upper one is taken off the first, if there should be\r\n any bleeding, he has to wait before he can take off the lower testicle.\r\n\r\n The large vein that supplies the entrails with blood passes in the\r\n neighborhood of the testicles; there is danger that a young beginner\r\n may pierce it with the pointed instrument in taking off the skin of\r\n the lower testicle, in which case the chicken would die instantly,\r\n for all the blood in its body would issue out. There are one or two\r\n smaller veins which must be avoided, which is very easy, as they are\r\n not difficult to see. If properly managed, no blood ever appears until\r\n a testicle is taken off: so that should any appear before that, the\r\n operator will know that he has done something wrong.\r\n\r\n If a chicken die, it is during the operation by bleeding; (of course\r\n it is as proper for use as if bled to death by having its throat cut;)\r\n they very seldom die after, unless they have received some internal\r\n injury, or the flesh of the thigh has been cut through, from not being\r\n drawn back from off the last two ribs, where the incision is made; all\r\n of which are apt to be the case with young practitioners.\r\n\r\n If the testicles be found to be large, the bamboo tube should be used,\r\n and it should have a strong cocoa-nut string in it,--for small ones\r\n the silver tube with a horse-hair in it, is best.\r\n\r\n When a chicken has been cut, it is necessary before letting it run,\r\n to put a permanent mark upon it; otherwise it would be impossible to\r\n distinguish it from others not cut. I have been accustomed to cut off\r\n the outside or the inside toe of the left foot,--by this means I can\r\n distinguish them at a distance. Another mode is to cut off the comb,\r\n then shave off the spurs close to the leg, and stick them upon the\r\n bleeding head, where they will grow and become ornamental in the shape\r\n of a pair of horns. This last mode is perhaps the best, but it is not\r\n so simple and ready as the first. Which ever mode is adopted, the fowl\r\n should be marked before performing the operation, because the loss of\r\n blood occasioned by cutting off the comb or a toe, makes the fowl less\r\n likely to bleed internally during the operation.\r\n\r\n It is very common, soon after the operation, for the chicken to get\r\n wind in the side, when the wound is healing, between the flesh and\r\n the skin; it must be relieved by making a small incision in the skin,\r\n which will let the wind escape.\r\n\r\n Those fowls make the finest capons which are hatched early in the\r\n spring; they can be cut before the hot weather comes, which is a great\r\n advantage.\r\n\r\n Never attempt to cut a full-grown cock; it is a useless and cruel\r\n piece of curiosity. I have never known one to live.\r\n\r\n Be not discouraged with the first difficulties; with practice they\r\n will disappear; every season you will find yourself more expert, until\r\n the cutting of a dozen fowls before breakfast will be a small matter.\r\n\r\n It may be well to give a warning against becoming dissatisfied with\r\n the tools. A raw hand, when he meets with difficulties, is apt to\r\n think the tools are in fault, and sets about to improve them and\r\n invent others; but it is only himself that lacks skill, which practice\r\n alone can give. I have spent money, besides wasting my time in this\r\n foolish notion, but have always found that the old, original tools,\r\n which came from China, and where this mode of operating was invented,\r\n are the best.\r\n\r\n Take care that the tools are not abused by ignorant persons attempting\r\n to use them; they will last a person's life-time if properly used; but\r\n if put out of order, none but a surgical instrument maker can repair\r\n them properly.\r\n\r\n The object in giving publicity to this, is to have the markets of\r\n Philadelphia well supplied with capons: they have ever been esteemed\r\n one of the greatest delicacies, preserving the flavor and tenderness\r\n of the chicken, with the juicy maturity of age. In the Paris and\r\n London markets, double the price of common poultry is obtained for\r\n capons.\r\n\r\n Considering the abundance and excellence of poultry in the United\r\n States, it seems surprising that the art of making capons should be\r\n almost entirely unknown--it is hoped that this deficiency will now be\r\n supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING AND BUDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what follows on grafting and budding, we are indebted to that\r\nexcellent family paper, the New World. The article was prepared for it\r\nby J. S. Skinner, Esq., of the Post Office Department, Washington, from\r\nan English work, which, he adds, \"is not published or much known in\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nGRAFTING.--The process of grafting consists in taking off a shoot from\r\none tree, and inserting it into another, in such a manner as that both\r\nmay unite closely, and become one tree; the shoot or cutting thus\r\nemployed is called a _scion_, and the tree on which it is inserted or\r\ngrafted, a stock. The process of budding has precisely the same object\r\nin view as that of grafting, differing from the latter process only in\r\nthe insertion of a bud, instead of a shoot or cutting, into the bark of\r\nanother tree. To execute either process with adroitness and success,\r\nconsiderable practice is required. To excel in either, instructions\r\nshould be received from some competent person, who is both willing\r\nand able to impart the necessary information. More knowledge can be\r\nacquired in a short time in this manner than can possibly be attained\r\nby the most attentive perusal of any treatise expressly written upon\r\nthe subject. Impressed with the difficulty of the task, many writers\r\nhave indeed asserted, that description alone must ever fail to convey\r\nan adequate knowledge of the process; but the intelligent author of\r\nthe English Gardener has, with his usual ability, treated the subject\r\nin so clear and comprehensive a manner that we are induced to give the\r\ndetails of the process in the author's own language.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the subject of grafting and budding, there is\r\none thing which is equally applicable to both processes, and that is,\r\nthat the _stock_ ought to stand the whole summer upon the spot where\r\nit is grafted, before that operation is performed upon it. If stocks\r\nbe planted out in the fall, the sap does not rise vigorously enough in\r\nthe spring to afford a fair chance to the growing of the graft; another\r\nremark of equal importance is, that fruit-trees stand only _one summer_\r\non the spot whence they are to be removed to their final destination;\r\nbecause, if they stand longer than this, they will have large and\r\nlong roots, great amputation must take place, and the trees suffer\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n_The Time of Grafting_ is generally from the beginning of February to\r\nthe end of March,[1] beginning with the earliest sorts of trees, as\r\nplums, cherries, and pears; and ending with the latest, as apples.\r\nBut seasons are different, and in a backward season, the season for\r\ngrafting will be backward; and in such case, the fulness and bursting\r\nappearance of the buds of the stocks, and the mildness of the weather\r\nmust be our guides. However, it is certain that the mild weather, with\r\noccasional showers, is the best time for grafting.\r\n\r\n[1] In this climate, April and May are the best months.--ED. AM. AG.\r\n\r\n_The Mode of Preparing the Scion_ comes next. Take from the tree from\r\nwhich you mean to propagate, as many branches of last year's wood as\r\nwill cut into the quantity of scions that you want; but in choosing\r\nwhat branches to take, let the vigor of the tree guide you, in some\r\nmeasure. If it be a healthy, flourishing, and young tree, take your\r\nbranches from the outside shoots, for the upright ones at the top, or\r\nthose near the middle, are more likely to produce wood than fruit. Yet\r\ndo not take branches from the very lowest part of the tree, if you\r\ncan avoid it, as these are sure to be more puling in their nature. In\r\ncase the tree be old or weakly, then choose the most vigorous of its\r\nlast year's shoots, no matter where they grow. Keep these branches\r\nuncut until you arrive at the season for grafting, keeping them, in\r\nthe meanwhile, buried in dry mould; and when that season arrives,\r\ntake them up and cut them into the proper lengths for grafting. The\r\nmiddle part of each branch will generally be found to be the best;\r\nbut your branches may be scarce and few in number, and then make use\r\nof every part. Each scion should have from three to six eyes on it,\r\nbut six will, in all cases, be quite enough, as there is no use in\r\nan extraordinary length of scion; but, on the contrary, it may be\r\nproductive of much mischief, by overloading the head with young shoots\r\nand leaves as summer advances, and thereby making it more subject to\r\naccident from high winds or heavy rains.\r\n\r\n_The Operation of Grafting_ is performed many ways, though none of them\r\ndiffers from any of the others in the _main principle_, which is that\r\nof bringing the under or inner bark of the scion to bear upon the same\r\nbark of the stock. The sap of the stock flows upward toward the scion,\r\nand it will flow on into the scion, provided it find no interruption.\r\nHere, therefore, is the nicety--to fit those two barks so closely, the\r\none upon the other, that the sap shall proceed onward into the scion,\r\njust as it would have done into the amputated branch, causing the scion\r\nto supplant the branch. I shall only mention and illustrate two modes\r\nof grafting, viz., _tongue-grafting_ and _cleft-grafting_. These two it\r\nis necessary for me to speak of separately, and thoroughly to describe,\r\nfor they are not both of them applicable in all cases; the former being\r\nused in grafting on small-sized stocks and small branches of trees, and\r\nthe latter on large stocks and large branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONGUE-GRAFTING.--(FIG. 58.)]\r\n\r\n_Tongue-Grafting._--Suppose you have your stock of the proper age for\r\ngrafting, you cut it off at three or four inches from the ground, and\r\nwith a very _sharp, straight, and narrow-bladed grafting-knife_, cut\r\na thin strip of bark and wood upward, from about two inches below\r\nyour already shortened stock. Make this cut at one pull of the knife,\r\ninserting the edge rather horizontally, and when it has gone through\r\nthe bark and into the wood a little short of the middle, pull straight\r\nupward, (2, _a, b_;) then at rather less than half way down this cut,\r\nand with the blade of your knife across the cut, and downward, cut a\r\nvery _thin tongue_ of not more than three eighths of an inch long, (2,\r\n_c_.) Proceed nearly in the same way with the bottom part of the scion;\r\ncut first a narrow strip of wood and bark out, but not putting the\r\nknife in horizontally, as you have done with regard to the stock, (at\r\n2, _a_,) nor bringing it out straight to the end, to make a shoulder\r\nor angle, as you have done at (2, _a b_;) but make a sloping cut (1,\r\n_a b_,) of about the same length as the cut in the stock, or rather\r\na little less if anything; then make a tongue (1, _c_) to correspond\r\nwith that of the stock, but recollect that this must be cut _upward_\r\ninstead of _downward_; then place the scion upon the stock, inserting\r\nthe tongue of the scion into the tongue of the stock. Bring the four\r\nedges of bark, that is, the two edges of the cut in the top of the\r\nstock, and the two corresponding edges of the cut in the bottom of the\r\nscion, to meet precisely; or, if the scion be, in diameter, a smaller\r\npiece of wood than the stock, so that its two edges of bark can not\r\nboth meet those of the stock, then let only one meet, but be sure that\r\none meets precisely. But observe, that this can never be unless the\r\nfirst cut in the stock and that in the scion (2, _a b_,) and (1, _a\r\nb_,) be as even as a die, and performed with a knife scarcely less\r\nsharp than a razor. Take a common pruning-knife, and attempt to make\r\na cut of this kind, and you will find when you come to fit the scion\r\non, that, squeeze them together as you may, you will, in most cases,\r\nsee light between the parts of the stock and the scion that you are\r\ntrying to join, so effectually, as that the sap shall flow out of the\r\none into the other, unconscious of any division at all! But I will\r\nnot suppose anybody so ungain (as it is called in Hampshire) as to go\r\nabout so nice an operation as this without being prepared with the\r\nproper instruments for performing it; and therefore, I now suppose the\r\nscion put on properly, and presenting the appearance as in (3, _a_.)\r\nBut this is not all; the operation is not yet complete. The two parts\r\nthus joined must be bound closely to one another with matting, or bass,\r\nas the gardeners call it, (4.) A single piece tied on to the stock,\r\nwill, if well done, almost insure the junction; but lest parching winds\r\nshould come and rip up all vegetation, it is usual to put on besides\r\nthe bandage of matting, a ball of well-beaten clay sprinkled over\r\nwith a little wood-ashes or the fine siftings of cinders, to cover\r\ncompletely the parts grafted, that is, from an inch below them to an\r\ninch or so above them, (5;) and, even to prevent this ball of clay from\r\nbeing washed off by heavy rains, it is well to tie around it a covering\r\nof coarse canvass, or else to earth up the whole plant as you do beans\r\nor peas, drawing a little mound around it so as to reach nearly the top\r\nof the clay. Mr. Harrison prepares his grafting clay in the following\r\nmanner: Take two parts of clay and one of horse-dung, free from straw,\r\nmix them together, and beat the mass until the whole is thoroughly\r\nincorporated, then temper it with a little water till it is reduced\r\nto the consistence of stiff paste. This composition _never cracks_ on\r\ndrying!\r\n\r\n_Future Treatment._--Something now remains to be said on the future\r\ntreatment of the grafted plant. In a month's time at least, you will\r\nsee whether the scion has taken; it will then be either bursting\r\nforth into leaf or be irrecoverably dead. In this latter case, take\r\noff immediately the canvass, clay, bandage, and dead scion, and let\r\nthe stock push forth what shoots it pleases, and recover itself. In\r\nthe former case, however, you must, as soon as the scion is putting\r\nforth shoots, cut off, or rub off, all shoots proceeding from the stock\r\nbetween the ground and the clay, as these, if suffered to push on,\r\nwould divert the sap away from the scion, and probably starve it; then\r\ncarefully stake the plant, that is, put a small stick into the ground\r\nat within three inches, or thereabouts, of the root, and long enough to\r\nreach a few inches above the scion, which you will tie to it slightly\r\nwith a piece of wetted matting. This is really necessary, for when the\r\nshoots proceeding from the scion become half a foot long, they, with\r\nthe aid of their leaves, become so heavy as, when blown to and fro by\r\nthe wind, to break off immediately above the clay, or become loosened\r\ndown at the part joined to the stock. The staking being done, you need\r\ndo nothing more till near the end of June, when you should take off the\r\nwhole mass of canvass, clay, and bandage, but be careful in taking off\r\nthe clay not to break off the plant at the junction. It should be done\r\nby a careful hand, and after a day or two of rainy weather, as then the\r\nclay is moist and comes off without so much danger to the plant as when\r\nit is not. On taking off the clay, there is found a little sharp angle,\r\nleft at the top of the stock; this should now be cut smooth off. The\r\nbark of the stock and that of the scion will heal over this, and the\r\nunion is then complete. Lastly, it is frequently found that mould, and\r\nsometimes small vermin, have collected around the heretofore covered\r\nparts of the plant, according as the clay has been cracked by the sun.\r\nRub off all mould with your fingers, (no instrument does it so well,)\r\nand kill all vermin in the same way; and it is not amiss to finish this\r\nwork by washing the joined parts with a little soap and water, using a\r\nsmall paint-brush for the operation. All these things done, you have\r\nonly to guard against high winds, which, if the plant be not staked,\r\nas is above described, will very likely be broken off by them; and, in\r\nthis work of destruction, you will have the mortification of seeing the\r\nfinest of your plants go first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEFT-GRAFTING.--(FIG. 59.)]\r\n\r\n_Cleft-Grafting._--This is a species of grafting adopted in cases where\r\nthe stock is large, or where it consists of a branch or branches of a\r\ntree headed down. In either of these cases, saw off horizontally, the\r\npart you wish to graft, and smooth the wound over with a carpenter's\r\nplane, or a sharp, long-blade knife, (1.)\r\n\r\nPrepare your scion in this manner: At about, an inch and a half from\r\nthe bottom, cut it in the form of the blade of a razor; that is, make\r\nit sharp on one side, and let it be blunt at the back, where you will\r\nalso take care to leave the bark whole, (2, _a_.) Having thus prepared\r\nthe scion, make a split (1) in the crown of the saw-cut downward for\r\nabout two inches, taking care that the two sides of this be perfectly\r\neven. Hold it then open, by means of a chisel or a wedge, (or when the\r\nstock is but a small one, your knife,) and insert the scion, the sharp\r\nedge going inward, and the bark side or razor-back remaining outward,\r\nso that, on taking out the wedge or chisel, the cleft closes firmly on\r\nthe scion, (3,) the two edges of bark formed by the cleft, squeezing\r\nexactly upon the two edges of bark formed by the blunt razor-back. To\r\nmake the two barks meet precisely is the only nicety in this operation;\r\nbut this is so essential, that the slightest deviation will defeat\r\nthe purpose. In this sort of grafting, the stock on which you graft\r\nis generally strong enough to hold the scion close enough within\r\nits cleft, without the aid of binding, and then it is better not to\r\nbind; but as it is also necessary to prevent air circulating within\r\nthe wounded parts both of the stock and the scion, use grafting-clay\r\nto cover them over so as to effectually exclude the air; and cover\r\nthe clay with a piece of coarse canvass, wetting it first, and then\r\nbinding it on securely. In this way, the stock being strong, you may\r\ninsert several scions on the same head, by making several different\r\nclefts, and putting one scion in each; but this can only be to insure\r\nyour having two to succeed, for if all the scions that you put on one\r\nhead take, you must choose the two most eligible, and sacrifice the\r\nrest, as more than two leading limbs from such head ought not to be\r\nencouraged. The season for performing this sort of grafting, and the\r\nmode of preparing the scion, and the future treatment of the tree, are\r\nprecisely the same as in _tongue-grafting_.\r\n\r\n_Crown, or Bark-Grafting_ is a very ready method of grafting upon\r\nlarge, uneven, old stocks and branches. It is practised somewhat later\r\nthan the methods above described, that is, from the end of March to the\r\nthird week in April, because, in that period, the separation of the\r\nbark from the wood is more easily affected; a circumstance of primary\r\nimportance in this case. The tree is to be headed down, the cut being\r\nmade horizontally, and the section bored quite even and smooth; then\r\nmake a slit in the bark two inches in length, next with the handle of a\r\nbudding-knife, carefully open the bark for about a quarter of an inch;\r\nthen cut the scion about two inches in a sloping direction, in the form\r\nof a tongue, leaving the bark entire on the outside. The scion thus\r\nprepared, is pressed downward between the bark and the wood as far as\r\nthe incision in the stock extends; the bark of the stock readily yields\r\nto the pressure employed, and the scion is supported in its situation\r\nby a few coils of bass-matting, the whole being surrounded by clay.\r\n\r\n_Dove-Tail Grafting._--This is a very neat and successful mode of\r\ngrafting, originating with Mr. Malone, who gives the following\r\ndirections for its performance. The scion is to be selected so as to\r\nhave two or three buds above where the knife is to be inserted to\r\nprepare it for the operation; a slip is cut off the end of the scion,\r\nsloping it to the bottom as long as it may be decided to insert it into\r\nthe stock. On each side of the cut, as far as it extends, a part of the\r\nbark is to be taken off, leaving the under part broader than the upper,\r\non which upper or back part always contrive to leave a bud. The stock\r\nor branch to be worked is thus prepared: Being first cut off smooth and\r\nstraight, two parallel slits, distant from each other nearly the width\r\nof the scion and the length of its cut part, are then made in the bark\r\nof the branch, observing particularly to slope the knife, so that the\r\nunder edge of the cut next the wood may be wider than the outer edge.\r\nThe piece of bark between the slits must then be taken out, separating\r\nat the bottom by a horizontal cut. The scion will then slide into the\r\ndove-tail groove thus formed, and, if the work is well performed, will\r\nfit neatly and tightly. A small quantity of the grafting-clay must then\r\nbe carefully applied, securing it on with list, or any other convenient\r\nbandage, fastening it at the end with two small nails. The top of the\r\nstock should be entirely covered with clay, sloping it well up to the\r\ngrafts, and should be examined often to see if any cracks or openings\r\nappear, which should be immediately filled up with some very soft clay.\r\nThe proper time for performing the operation is from the beginning\r\nof April till the middle of May, or earlier if the sap is in motion.\r\n(Gardener's Magazine, Vol. VII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUDDING.--(FIG. 60.)]\r\n\r\nBUDDING.--Budding is performed for precisely the same purpose as\r\ngrafting, and, like grafting, it is performed in many different ways;\r\nand as long experience has ascertained the best method, namely, that of\r\nT budding, (1,) so called from the form of the two cuts that are made\r\nin the bark of the stock to receive the bud, or _shield-budding_, as it\r\nis sometimes called from the form of the piece of bark (2) on which the\r\nbud is seated, assuming the shape of a shield when it is prepared to be\r\ninserted within the T cut in the stock.\r\n\r\nThe only solid difference between budding and grafting is this, that\r\nwhereas in grafting you insert on the stock a _branch_ already\r\nproduced, in budding, you insert only the _bud_. I shall proceed, in\r\ntreating of this matter, in the same way that I did in the preceding\r\narticle, namely, _as to the season proper for budding, the choosing\r\nand preparing of the bud, the operation of budding, and the future\r\ntreatment of the plant budded_.\r\n\r\n_The Season for Budding_ is generally from the latter end of July to\r\nthe latter end of August, the criterions being a plump appearance of\r\nthe buds formed on the spring shoot of the same year, seated in the\r\nangle of a leaf, and a readiness in the bark of the stock to separate\r\nfrom the wood.\r\n\r\n_In Choosing and Preparing the Bud_, fix on one seated at about\r\nthe middle of a healthy shoot of the mid-summer growth--these are,\r\ngenerally speaking, the most inclined to fruitfulness. Choose a cloudy\r\nday, if you have a choice of days at this season, and if not, perform\r\nyour work early in the morning, or in the evening. The time being\r\nproper, you sever the branch on which you find the buds to your liking.\r\nTake this with you to the stock that you are going to bud, holding the\r\nbranch in your left hand, the largest end downward; make a sloping cut\r\nfrom about an inch and a half below the bud to about an inch above it,\r\nsuffering your knife to go through the bark, and about half way into\r\nthe wood, cutting out wood and all. This keeping of the wood prevents\r\nthe bud and its bark from drying while you are preparing the incision\r\nin the stock, and if you wish to carry buds of scarce sorts to any\r\ndistance, you may do so safely by putting their ends in water, or in\r\ndamp moss, but it is always safer, as well in grafting as in budding,\r\nto perform the operation with as much expedition as possible, but\r\nparticularly it is so in budding.\r\n\r\n_Operation of Budding._--Cut off the leaf under which the bud is\r\nsituated, but leave its foot-stalk, (2, _a_,) and by this hold it\r\nbetween your lips, while with your budding-knife you cut two straight\r\nlines in the stock at the place where you wish to insert the bud, and\r\nthis should be where the bark is smooth, free from any bruises or\r\nknots, and on the side rather from the mid-day suns. Of these lines\r\nlet the first be horizontal, (1,) and let the next be longitudinal,\r\nbeginning at the middle of the first cut and coming downward. Let them,\r\nin short, describe the two principal bars of the Roman letter T. You\r\nhave now to take out from the bark on which the bud is, the piece of\r\nwood on which the bark is, and which has served you, up to this time,\r\nto preserve the bud and bark from drying and shrinking. But this is a\r\nnice matter. In doing it you must be careful not to endanger the root\r\nof the bud, as it is called, because in that is its existence. The\r\nbark, (if the season be proper for budding,) will easily detach itself\r\nfrom this piece of wood, but still it requires a very careful handling\r\nto get it out without endangering the root of the bud. Hold the bud on\r\nyour fore-finger, and keep your thumb on the wood opposite; then with\r\nthe fore-finger and thumb of the other hand, bend backward and forward\r\nthe lower end of the shield, and thus coax the wood to disengage itself\r\nfrom the bark; and when you find it decidedly doing so, remove your\r\nthumb from it, and the whole piece of wood will come out, leaving you\r\nnothing but a piece of bark of about two and a half inches long, with a\r\nbud and foot-stalk of a leaf on it. If the root of the bud be carried\r\naway with the piece of wood, you will perceive a small cavity where it\r\nought to be. In this case, throw away the bud and try another.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in the second attempt, now open the two sides of the\r\nlongitudinal bar of the T with the ivory haft of your budding-knife,\r\nbut in doing this, raise the bark clearly down to the wood, for the\r\ninside of the piece of bark belonging to the bud must be placed\r\ndirectly against this. Having opened these sides wide enough to receive\r\nthe longest end of the bark, insert it nicely, taking especial care\r\nthat its inner side be flatly against the wood of the stock. Then cut\r\nthe upper end of the bark off, so that its edge shall meet precisely\r\nthe edge of the horizontal bar of the T (3, _a_.). With your finger and\r\nthumb bring the two sides of the longitudinal bar over the bark of the\r\nbud, or rather the shield, and with a piece of well-soaked matting,\r\nbegin an inch below this bar and bind firmly all the way up to an inch\r\nabove the horizontal bar, taking good care to leave the bud peeping\r\nout. Bind in such a way as to exclude the air, for that is the intent\r\nof binding in this case. Tie your piece of matting on first, and wind\r\nit round and round the stock as you would a riband, taking care not\r\nto twist the matting; wind it slowly, and every time you have gone\r\ncompletely round, give a gentle pull to make it firm.\r\n\r\n_Future Treatment._--In a fortnight's time from the operation, you will\r\ndiscover whether the bud has taken, by its roundness and healthy look;\r\nand, in a fortnight after that, loosen the bandage to allow the plant\r\nto swell, and in about five weeks from the time of budding, take away\r\nthe bandage altogether. In this state, the plant passes the winter,\r\nand just as the sap begins to be in motion in the following spring,\r\nyou head down the stock at about an inch above the bud, beginning\r\nbehind it, and making a sloping cut upward to end above its point.\r\nSome gardeners leave a piece of the stock about six inches long for\r\nthe first year, in order to tie the first summer's shoot to it to\r\nprevent its being broken off by the wind. This may be well when the\r\nplant is exposed to high winds, but even then, if you see danger, you\r\nmay tie a short stick on the top part of the stock, and to this tie\r\nthe young shoot, and then the sap all goes into the shoot from the\r\nbud, instead of being divided between it and six inches of stock left\r\nin the other way. There are some advantages which budding has over\r\ngrafting, and these I think it right to mention. In the first place,\r\nuniversal experience has proved that certain trees succeed much better\r\nwhen budded, than the same trees do when grafted, such are the peach,\r\nnectarine, apricot, plum, and cherry; indeed, the rule is, that all\r\nstone-fruits do better budded than grafted, that they are, when budded,\r\nless given to gum, a disease peculiar to stone-fruits, and often very\r\npernicious to them. You may also, by budding, put two more branches\r\nupon a stock that would be too weak to take so many grafts, and you\r\nmay bud in July when grafting has failed in March and April. The\r\ndisadvantage of budding is that the trees are rendered one year later\r\nin coming into bearing than when you graft.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight has recommended a mode of budding, (Hort. Trans., vol. I.).\r\nHe thus describes the process: In the month of June, as the luxuriant\r\nshoots of my peach-trees were grown sufficiently firm to permit the\r\noperation, I inserted buds of other varieties into them, employing two\r\ndistinct ligatures to bind the buds in their places. One ligature was\r\nfirst placed above the bud inserted, and upon the transverse section\r\nthrough the bark; the other which had no further office than that of\r\nsecuring the bud, was applied in the usual way. As soon as the buds had\r\nattached themselves, the ligatures last applied were taken off, but\r\nthe others were suffered to remain. The passage of the sap upward, was\r\nin consequence much obstructed, and the inserted bud began to vegetate\r\nstrongly in July, and when these had afforded shoots about four inches\r\nlong, the remaining ligatures were taken off to admit the excess of\r\nsap to pass on, and the young shoots were nailed to the wall, being\r\nthere properly exposed to light, their wood ripened well, and afforded\r\nblossoms in the succeeding spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe should be pleased if any of our readers could give us further\r\ninformation about the shrub described below.\r\n\r\n  _From the Yankee Blade._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH CRANBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman of this place having occasion some twenty years ago, to\r\nmake an excursion into the northern part of the state, near Lake\r\nUmbagog, where the Magalloway empties into the Androscoggin, passed\r\nthrough a large piece of low land, comprising many acres, which was\r\ncovered with the high cranberry as far as the eye could see, exhibiting\r\nthe most beautiful and splendid appearance, perhaps, ever displayed\r\nfrom any of the spontaneous productions of the forests of New England.\r\nHe says that some shrubs which had acquired the magnitude of trees of\r\nseveral inches diameter, were literally bent to the ground, under the\r\nweight of their luxuriant fruit; and such was their abundance, that a\r\nsingle individual might have gathered more than thirty bushels in a day.\r\n\r\nThe high cranberry in dense forests, sometimes acquires the respectable\r\naltitude of 15 or 20 feet; but in more open places, its height is\r\ngenerally from 6 to 8 or 10 feet. Its stem and leaf very much resemble\r\nthose of the snow-ball; and the flower, while it lasts, is but little\r\ninferior in elegance and beauty to the flower of that highly ornamented\r\nand much esteemed shrub. The fruit is smaller than that of the running\r\ncranberry, of a bright red color when ripe, and grows in large, flat\r\nclusters on the ends of the branches. Its taste is very acid, and\r\nrather austere. It contains a large, hard, flat seed, which is an\r\nobjection to the use of it without sifting or straining; but being\r\nsifted or strained after stewing, it is excellent for sauce, pies, and\r\ntarts. Prepared with sugar, in the usual way, it makes a most delicious\r\njelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n  _For the American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINE WOOL SHEEP.\r\n\r\n  _Buskirk's Bridge, October, 1843._\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE read the article headed \"Sheep, Paular Merinos,\" over the\r\nsignature of Examiner, in the May number, page 52 of your paper,\r\npurporting to give us plain farmers an insight into sheep breeding,\r\n&c.; and what fine flocks used to be, when the \"old fashioned Merino\r\nsheep\" were in their \"glory.\" What they were a quarter of a century\r\nago, I cannot say, that was before I had any thing to do with sheep\r\nin this country; but I presume that _fine_ flocks were then not so\r\nnumerous as they are now. I can not agree with the writer, \"that the\r\nfine flocks of the United States are sadly deteriorated, indeed, nearly\r\nrun out.\" Since 1825, I have been acquainted with fine sheep in this\r\ncountry, and I venture to say, that there are three, four, or five, and\r\nin this section, _ten_, fine flocks, where there was but one 18 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIf Examiner will honor me with a visit, an invitation I herewith\r\ncordially tender to him, I will show him _fine_ flocks, consisting of\r\nmore than a few individuals--a dozen or two, or may be a few scores, of\r\npicked sheep together, and kept in the very highest possible condition;\r\nno, but flocks from 500 to 1,000--even more--which might alter his\r\njudgment, if that is not swayed by prejudice. Many of these large\r\nflocks shear on an average 3 lbs. and over, of wool, well washed on\r\nthe sheep's back, the quality of which is superior to the \"Paular,\"\r\nand \"old-fashioned Merinos;\" and I doubt not, should Examiner make\r\na comparison between the two kinds himself, he would pronounce it\r\n_superfine_; and besides the quality, he would also discover a great\r\ndifference in the condition and cleanliness of the wool. These flocks\r\nare high-grade Saxons, and show a result not quite so \"unfortunate\" as\r\nExaminer would make us believe. My own flock of 240 ewes and lambs and\r\na few bucks, pure, unmixed Saxons, whose pedigree can be traced back\r\nto the importations of the Elector of Saxony, from the royal flocks of\r\nSpain, sheared this year 2 lbs. 13 oz. per head; last year 2 lbs. 14\r\noz. clean wool. If I had had a proportionate number of weathers among\r\nthem, the average would have been at _least_ 3 lbs. I repeat then, that\r\nthe wool of the \"Paular,\" or \"old fashioned Merinos,\" does not compare\r\nwith the Saxons and their crosses in quality and condition. If the\r\nfleeces from the former are heavier than from the latter, let it be\r\nborne in mind that they contain more _gum_, and _yolk_, dirt, &c.,; are\r\nnot so fine, and that the sheep _consume a greater quantity of feed_.\r\nThese are facts well known to every good judge of wool, and to every\r\nexperienced, practical shepherd.\r\n\r\nI would ask whether Examiner had his eyes closed against them when\r\nhe was examining the fine-wooled flocks of the United States, and\r\ndeclared them \"sadly deteriorated, indeed, nearly run out.\" I do not\r\npretend, Mr. Editor, that I am acquainted with all \"the fine flocks of\r\nthe United States, but allow me to say, that my acquaintance among\r\nthe wool-growers is pretty extensive. I am a purchaser, as well as a\r\ngrower of wool, and handle no inconsiderable quantities yearly. My\r\npurchases this year amount to over 130,000 lbs., and I have examined at\r\nleast 300,000 lbs., and a great variety of flocks of different grades\r\nand character, have come under my observation--sheep kept in the very\r\nlowest up to the very highest condition. I have always found, that\r\nwhere the blood of the \"old fashioned Merinos, Paulars,\" or whatever\r\ntheir possessors are pleased to call them, predominated, there also I\r\nfound _gum_, yolk, dirt, and other substances adhering to the wool,\r\nin great abundance, _unfit to make cloth_ of, which goes far to make\r\nup the greater weight of fleece over the Saxony. Indeed, sir, when\r\ngentlemen talk of fine fleeces weighing 8, 9, or 10 lbs. they forget to\r\nmention \"_including gum, yolk, dirt, and other substances adhering to\r\nthe fleece_.\"\r\n\r\nSome years since, I saw a lot of \"old fashioned Merino\" wool at a\r\nfactory in Massachusetts, which the manufacturer assured me would lose\r\n55 per cent. in cleansing. \"Indeed,\" said he, \"we can never estimate\r\nthe dirt in such wool correctly; it always exceeds our estimate, and\r\nwe invariably suffer loss.\" And recently, a gentleman, a dealer in\r\nwool, told me that he sent this season, a large quantity to Boston to\r\nbe sold, and that on making sale of some 36,000 lbs., the manufacturer\r\nwho bought it, rejected all gummy, dirty fleeces, declaring that he\r\nwould not have them, as such wool would lose more than 50 per cent.\r\nin cleansing. And to use the gentleman's own words, \"there it lies,\r\nin a corner of the wool room, and I do not know what to do with it;\"\r\nobserving at the same time, that the manufacturers were \"getting more\r\ncunning.\" There was a time when the supply fell short of the demand,\r\nand almost any wool, however gummy and dirty, found ready purchasers;\r\nfor manufacturers were often compelled to buy it, in order to keep\r\ntheir machinery in operation; but that time has gone by, and they are\r\nnow more choice in their selections, and when they come across a lot of\r\nsuch wool they pass it by, with observations like these: \"I do not want\r\nit, it is too dirty, let him keep it for some body else\"!\r\n\r\nIn your July number, page 130 and 131, Mr. Editor, you have made a\r\ncalculation of the number of sheep, and the quantity of wool obtained\r\ntherefrom. The census of 1840 shows, say 20,000,000 in the United\r\nStates. Of this number you estimate only 11,000,000 shorn sheep,\r\nyielding 24,500,000 lbs. of wool, and the lambs at 9,000,000.--With due\r\ndeference to your superior opportunities for information, I beg leave\r\nto say that you are over estimating the number of lambs, for every\r\npractical wool-grower knows, that that proportion is too large--if\r\nyou had said one third, you would have come nearer the truth. I think\r\nyou are mistaken also that the census of 1840 included lambs, it was\r\nexclusive of lambs.(_a_) You are, however, perfectly safe in estimating\r\nthe average weight of fleece in the United States at 2¼ lbs. This is\r\ncertainly too low by one fourth of a pound.(_b_) In this region it\r\nexceeds 2¾ lbs. Then you say, that by producing a superior quality\r\nof wool, its value would be increased nine cents per pound; this\r\ncertainly is attainable; but the way in which you propose to bring it\r\nabout, namely, by crossing with the \"Paular, or old-fashioned Merinos,\"\r\nyou would not obtain that end, thousands of fine flocks would be\r\nreduced in quality.(_c_) In this section it would reduce the quality\r\nas much as you wish to improve it. Coarse sheep would be improved by\r\nthe cross; but to apply it to all the sheep in the United States, as I\r\nunderstand you to say, you would find yourself very much mistaken in\r\nthe result. I venture to say, that on the same quantity of feed, you\r\ncan not increase the heft of fleece of a fine flock shearing from 2¾ to\r\n3 lbs., by your cross up to 3¾ to 4 lbs. per head, and have the wool in\r\nequally good condition.(_d_) An increase of feed will do much toward\r\nincreasing the heft of fleece. A few words more and I have done.\r\n\r\nExaminer, page 52, says: \"As to Paular Bucks, it strikes me that you\r\nmight, for any practical purpose, just as well have advised a cross of\r\nthe fabulous Unicorn, for it would be just as easy to find the one as\r\nthe other at the present time in the United States; for depend upon it,\r\nthere is no such thing now existing, as _a Paular Buck_, nor _any thing\r\ndeserving the name_ in the whole country.\" And you say that \"there are\r\nstill large and valuable flocks scattered over the country.\"(_e_)\r\n\r\n  H. D. GROVE.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Immediately upon the receipt of this letter of Mr. Grove's we\r\nwrote on to Washington to ascertain the facts in the case, but were\r\nanswered that the census bureau was abolished, and they could not tell.\r\nWe know that when the person for taking the census in the district in\r\nwhich we were then residing, called upon us, he required the number of\r\ncolts, calves, lambs, and pigs, although some of them were only three\r\ndays old at the time; and to our objection of rendering an account of\r\nsuch young stock, he remarked, \"never mind, they will be grown when\r\nthe census appears, and it is the law.\" Most of those to whom we have\r\nput the question about rendering an account of the lambs in their\r\nflocks, say they did so; others do not recollect. If there has been\r\nirregularity with sheep-owners in giving an account of their lambs, of\r\ncourse we are incorrect; and we think, upon reflection, we may have\r\nestimated the number of lambs too high; though, on the other hand, we\r\nare quite certain Mr. Grove has set them down as entirely too few; for\r\nwe know flocks that produce within a fraction as many lambs annually as\r\nthere are breeding ewes.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Perhaps when Mr. Grove has travelled south and west more\r\nextensively, and seen in the months of March and April, as many\r\nhalf-bare sheep as we have, which shed their wool from disease, want of\r\ncare, &c., he may come to a different conclusion. We have often seen\r\nflocks in the same condition at the north too, leaving many of our\r\nfarmers little to boast of in this respect.\r\n\r\n(_c_) We have turned to the article to which Mr. Grove alludes, but\r\nreally, we do not find that we used the expressions attributed to\r\nus. We said \"Spanish Merino,\" also, \"unadulterated Merino;\" meaning\r\nthereby, the Rambouillets more particularly. We also spoke in general\r\nterms, in recommending the use of these. Such a flock of Saxons as Mr.\r\nGrove's we would _especially except_; and if the accounts which we hear\r\nof them be correct, and we have no doubt they are, we would not cross\r\nthem with anything less fine than themselves. They are unquestionably\r\nsuperior animals, as is proved by their superior weights of fleece, and\r\nthe high price the wool commands; and we wish, since the name of Saxon\r\nhas been so basely misused in this country by miserable counterfeits,\r\nthat Mr. Grove would give his flock the name of Electoral; for they\r\nand their descendants are probably the only ones entitled to it in\r\nthe United States. With this name, they would then fairly stand aloof\r\nfrom the common herd, as they deserve, and not be associated in idea\r\nhereafter, with the miserable riff-raff of the country, passing under\r\nthe general name of Saxons. It is our intention next season to call and\r\nsee Mr. Grove's flock.\r\n\r\n(_d_) We meant to be understood as alluding to a cross on the coarser\r\nand more restiff sheep of the country, when we spoke of obtaining an\r\nincrease of weight of wool on the same food, and we know that this can\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n(_e_) True enough, but we did not say these valuable flocks were\r\nPaulars; nor did we go so far as to assert that they were pure Merinos\r\nof any distinct name. We wish it understood, that we do not endorse all\r\nthe opinions of Examiner any more than we do other correspondents--he\r\nspeaks for himself, and we for ourselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _For the American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-MUD AS A FERTILIZER.\r\n\r\n  _Flushing, L. I., November 8th, 1843._\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN you inform me whether the sea-mud which is found on the shore,\r\nbelow high-water mark, is of any value to the farmer; and if it is,\r\nin what way would you advise that it should be applied? Do you think\r\nthat it would answer in a compost heap, or would it be preferable to\r\nput it into the cattle-yard or hog-pen? I have thought that the only\r\nobjection to using it would be on account of the great quantity of\r\nsalt, which it contains; although Leibig and other celebrated writers,\r\nspeak in very favorable terms upon the application of salt. And here\r\narises another question. Are not those farms which are situated upon\r\nthe sea-shore sufficiently supplied with salt by the winds which are\r\nconstantly sweeping over them? Johnson remarks that this is the case,\r\nand if this is so, would not the application of this sea-mud be too\r\nstrong? although I am inclined to believe that by drying the mud,\r\nmuch of the virtue of the salt would necessarily be destroyed, and as\r\nsea-water contains, as Leibig states, many very fertilizing qualities,\r\nthis mud which perhaps has been accumulating for ages, must have\r\nimbibed a large quantity of all those properties, of which sea-water is\r\ncomposed.

Henry Meigs at its meeting August 29, and is obligingly\r\nfurnished us for publication.\r\n\r\n  _For the American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM OF HUGH MAXWELL, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD EFFECTS OF MARL.--In a conversation with Hugh Maxwell, Esq., some\r\nshort time since, he stated some facts in relation to the fertilising\r\npower of a red marl abundantly existing at Nyack, which induced me to\r\nvisit the spot. I found Mr. Maxwell's farm of 110 acres bounded by the\r\nHudson, well worth a visit. The whole was in excellent fence, made of\r\nthe loose stones found on the land, neatly piled about 4½ feet high,\r\nforming fields of from 4 to 8 acres. The formation of these fences has\r\nused nearly all the stones which were on the surface of the lands. And\r\nin this it would seem as if Divine Providence had caused the rocks to\r\nbe distributed of the proper size for fencing. Had the pieces been much\r\nlarger or smaller they would not have answered the purpose so well as\r\nthey now do. If they had been planted two feet under ground, or had\r\nbeen piled in larger masses, the labor of fencing would have been very\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nThis farm, as well as all those about Nyack, lies on the singular mass\r\nof sandstone included by a front of about five miles on the river.\r\nAll the surrounding rocks are of other materials. This sandstone,\r\nwhen quarried, exhibits strata of a kind of red marl of many feet in\r\nthickness, lying between strata of the sandstone. The quarry-men throw\r\nit out of their way, and millions of loads are lying near the water's\r\nedge, so that in many places vessels can lie alongside a bed of it,\r\nand slide it on board. On Mr. Maxwell's farm, the former proprietor,\r\ndesirous of making extensive hard walks through his garden, caused\r\nthis marl to be put upon them about one foot deep. Soon after this\r\nwas finished, the walks began to produce clover; the white in such\r\nprofusion and persevering succession, that all prospect of using the\r\npaths in that condition was abandoned: they could not be kept in order\r\nby the hoe. Mr. Maxwell being strongly impressed by this occurrence,\r\ndetermined on applying it to the surface of his farm. I saw a field\r\nof corn of several acres which had been top-dressed this year with\r\nthe red marl, now bearing not less than 80 bushels of shelled corn\r\nto the acre--as great a product as is obtained from the best city\r\nmanure, costing at Nyack nearly 37 cents per load. I saw an upland\r\nfield of wheat, on which, as an experiment, Mr. Maxwell had top-dressed\r\nwith this marl a space of three rods by two, from which I pulled an\r\naverage bunch of straw-stubble, that is more than double the size and\r\nweight of any like parcel of stubble, to be found in the whole field\r\nof several acres. Unfortunately the husbandman had cradled all the\r\nwheat indiscriminately, which prevented Mr. Maxwell from examining the\r\nseparate product of the wheat. I should not hesitate to pronounce it a\r\ndouble product. Mr. M. top-dressed a field of oats with this marl, and\r\nthe yield was 70 bushels per acre. He top-dressed a field of clover\r\nwith it the third year from the seeding, and the product is heavier\r\nthan the crop of the _second year_. This field was dressed with ten\r\nloads of marl per acre. The corn is large 12-row yellow, and the stalks\r\nare about 10 feet high. The corn-blades never curled during the late\r\ndrought, while other fields all curled. The corn was worked with the\r\nhand-harrow once, with the cultivator twice, and was hoed twice. No\r\nplowing between the hills. Mr. M. thinks that in dry weather it is\r\nvery injurious to run the plow through, for it cuts the smaller roots\r\nof the corn. He has tried 25 bushels of hickory ashes, against 25 of\r\nanthracite coal ashes, and found no perceptible difference in the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of this red marl is perceptible in almost every\r\nplant and tree in that vicinity. Fruit-trees are especially vigorous\r\nand free from disease. Flowering shrubs, roses particularly, seem not\r\nto have been touched by any insect. I pulled up a mullein stalk growing\r\non a naked mound of this marl, which measures nine feet in height, and\r\nthe flower stem, which is covered with buds, is four feet in extent.\r\nThe trees, excepting peach alone, are more thriving than those I have\r\nanywhere seen. The peach-trees have the yellows. Moss roses growing\r\nin rich grass are remarkably strong; Mr. M. finds that they do better\r\nclosely surrounded by grass than in clear ground. He has ten kinds of\r\nhealthy cherry-trees, including the red and white ox-heart, and the\r\nbull's eye. He has freely given, and wishes to distribute buds and\r\ngrafts to all those who ask for them. Mr. M. has very healthy apricots,\r\nwhich have yielded fine fruit. _He smoked the blossoms with sulphur and\r\npitch_, and all the fruit was perfect. _This smoking was done in the\r\nevening._\r\n\r\nSome of the fields had never been but partially cultivated, on account\r\nof being so swamped that cattle mired in them. He made in one four-acre\r\nfield a drain ten rods long, and three feet deep, filled in with coarse\r\nstone. This drain formed a _perpetual spring for his cattle_, and this\r\nbarren field has now buckwheat of at least _thirty bushels per acre_.\r\n_One and a half bushels_ of seed was sowed per acre. No manure needed.\r\nThis drain cost $1.75. Twelve acres were drained in the same style at a\r\ncost of $150; this field is now fine, and asks for no manure from New\r\nYork, or Nyack marl. He prefers the same amount of marl to best New\r\nYork city manure for all grains and grapes.\r\n\r\nMr. M. has the old English yew thriving in open air in winter. The\r\nEuropean mountain ash, white and red linden, red maple, weeping ash,\r\nweeping beech, weeping elm, Madeira nut, (one five years old bearing\r\nfruit,) Spanish chestnut now in fruit, (this tree has also some\r\nblossoms on it at this time.) Apricots grafted on plum stock are very\r\nthrifty.\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE HORSE.--In passing through Mr. Maxwell's barn-yard, I\r\nnoticed a couple of horses, one of which was hoppled with a strong iron\r\nchain. What mischievous young horse have you there? He replied, it is\r\nmy old family mare Kate, who has carried me, and my wife and children,\r\nsafely for the last one and twenty years! I bought her when she was\r\nabout four years old, but she will break fences now (wooden ones) with\r\nher irons on, she is so active and cunning.\r\n\r\nLOCUST EGGS.--I remarked at Nyack the work of the locust, and Mr. M.\r\nand Thomas Addis Emmet, Esq., examined with a good microscope, a twig\r\nworked by the little insect. The twig being split in the line of the\r\nwork, exhibited the whole process of the egg deposite. The twig is\r\npierced nearly to its centre at every three quarters of an inch, or\r\nnearly so; the wood is rendered fibrous, it is then lifted up, and\r\nthe eggs, which are of a long, oval form, are deposited side by side\r\nat an angle of about 45 degrees to the grain of the twig, and the\r\nfibrous tuft of wood placed over them, with its end sticking out; these\r\nincisions being repeated every inch on a line for some few inches in\r\neach twig. With the microscope, we saw the eyes of the young locusts\r\nalways heads to the centre. The general outline of the young animal was\r\nperceptible through its delicate membranous cover. They moved slightly\r\non being disturbed. Almost every twig so operated on by the locust was\r\nentirely dead. The magnifying power of the microscope was perhaps 40 or\r\n50.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF AN ORCHARD.--I visited an apple orchard at Nyack, which\r\narrested my attention by its regular and healthy appearance. I found\r\nyoung Van Houton at home, who, with perfect good feeling and true\r\npoliteness, gave me the account of the orchard which I desired. When\r\nhis father was about fifty years of age, he undertook to plant 150\r\nwinter pippin-trees on that spot. His neighbors thought him an old fool\r\nto plant twigs of apple at his time of day. Young Van Houton, then\r\nabout 16 years of age, held the little nurslings in the holes while\r\nhis father filled in the soil. The old gentleman continued to prune\r\nthem, so that they are widely branched and open for air and sun within\r\nthe mass of branches. For twenty or twenty-two years past, the old\r\ngentleman has often received $1,000 a year for his apples. Sometimes $6\r\nper barrel; sometimes sold in the orchard for $1 per barrel. That old\r\ngentleman and his wife are now, between them, 174 years old. Let no man\r\nbe afraid to plant winter pippins because he is fifty or sixty years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nI have been highly pleased with my excursion. When gentlemen of high\r\nrank in learned professions are found turning that intellectual\r\nforce which has influenced the most wealthy and intelligent portion\r\nof mankind, from law, politics, &c., to that greatest, best of all\r\narts--agriculture, I look for good results and I find them. The old\r\nworld is hard at work in this direction, and I hope that we shall watch\r\nher operations with the eye of our own bird, and see to it, that we be\r\nnot excelled in any good thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _For the American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDITERRANEAN WHEAT.\r\n\r\n  _Wheatland, Va., November 2, 1843._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have noticed your remarks in the October No. of your paper, on the\r\nMediterranean wheat. Your views coincided with mine when I first sowed\r\nthis variety of wheat; but I have sown it now for two seasons, and\r\nthe change has been so great in the color, as to convince me that by\r\ncultivating it here, it will lose its dark color, and become as good\r\nin that respect, and yield as much flour as any wheat we have. The two\r\nseasons I have raised it, it has been the best wheat I had. I have\r\ndoubts whether it will tiller as much as some other varieties, and\r\ntherefore sow it much thicker.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT L.

C., Nov. 4th, 1843._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN those excellent matter-of-fact articles on the cultivation of\r\ncotton, which have appeared in the late numbers of your paper, by Dr.\r\nPhilips of Miss., and which, by the way, are the best I have ever seen\r\non the subject, I do not recollect that he has touched upon the subject\r\nof topping cotton. I have made one experiment in this, and was pleased\r\nwith the result. Some planters north of us, I understand, have also\r\ntried this method, and find the cotton is not so apt to shed, as when\r\nit is not topped, especially in wet seasons. Ordinarily we reckon the\r\nfirst week in August the best time for topping; but this, of course,\r\nwill depend upon the season, and the forwardness of the crop--for\r\nsometimes it must be earlier, and sometimes later.\r\n\r\nI tried the effects of what I suppose to be marl, on a small spot in\r\none of my fields, say about one acre. The marl I judge to be of poor\r\nquality, yet can not say, positively, as I have no analysis of it.\r\nI dug it out in January last, and spread it broad-cast, at the rate\r\nof 30 loads to the acre, as large as an ordinary pair of mules would\r\ncarry. It seemed to pulverize well, exposed to the severe frost of last\r\nwinter, and I plowed it in deeper than I usually plow, and harrowed the\r\nland well. The result is, I shall get full one third if not one half\r\nmore cotton off of this piece than any other part of the field, which\r\nmore than pays me for the trouble.\r\n\r\nI need not say that we read the articles on manures in the\r\nAgriculturist with much interest; for many of us are beginning to learn\r\nthat it is not only easier and better, but even _cheaper_ to renovate\r\nour old lands, than emigrate to a new country and bring new lands into\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n  C.

One\r\nmay not only be larger in measure than another, but heavier for the\r\nsame measure; yielding more flour from a given weight; and lastly,\r\naffording a greater proportion of gluten from the same quantity\r\nof flour. It is necessary for the farmer to have each of these\r\nconsiderations in view, if he would attain the utmost success in the\r\ncultivation of this invaluable grain. My object, in this brief article,\r\nwill be, to afford some helps to the agriculturist in increasing the\r\nultimate value of his crop. As a starting point, it will, perhaps, be\r\nmost instructive to inquire, what are the constituent elements of wheat?\r\n\r\nSprengel has analyzed both grain and straw, and the following is the\r\nresult:--1000 lbs. of wheat afford 11·77 lbs. and of wheat straw, 35·18\r\nlbs. of ash, consisting of\r\n\r\n                            Grain of wheat.   Straw of wheat.\r\n  Potash                         2·25 lbs.       0·20 lbs.\r\n  Soda                           2·40             ·29\r\n  Lime                            ·96            2·40\r\n  Magnesia                        ·90             ·32\r\n  Alumina with a trace of iron    ·26             ·90\r\n  Silica                         4·00           28·70\r\n  Sulphuric acid                  ·50             ·37\r\n  Phosphoric acid                 ·40            1·70\r\n  Chlorine                        ·10            0·30\r\n                                -----           -----\r\n                                11·77           35·18\r\n\r\nThis analysis shows an amount of ash far below the average. Davy found\r\n15·5 lbs. of ash in 100 lbs. of ripe wheat straw; and Johnstone, in one\r\nvariety, grown on a soil abounding in limestone, 16·5 per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, according to the above analysis of Sprengel,\r\nthat of the total of grain, less than 1½ per cent., and of straw,\r\nrather more than 3½ per cent. is earthy or inorganic matter; while all\r\nthe remainder is composed of the organic materials, carbon, oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen, of which carbon alone constitutes about one\r\nhalf. All these constituents are absolutely essential to the perfection\r\nof the crop. In the natural condition of a fertile soil when first\r\nreclaimed, these materials are usually found in sufficient abundance\r\nto produce wheat. Such was the condition of nearly all the land in New\r\nEngland, and the eastern portion of our own state; but a few years of\r\ncareless, unscientific cropping, has exhausted one or more of those\r\nconstituents which may have existed in an available form; and much\r\nof it, after a very few of the first years of its cultivation, has\r\nbeen of little or no value for wheat, under the system of tillage\r\nthere adopted. It has been asserted by Dr. Dana, that in a soil\r\npurely granitic (and much of the land in that region partakes of this\r\ncharacter), there is potash enough for successive crops of wheat for\r\n3,000 years, and lime enough to last more than twice that period.\r\nBut the result is the same for the growing vegetation, whether the\r\nmaterials do not exist at all, or are locked up beyond the reach of\r\nit. It is absolutely certain, if wheat will not grow with care and\r\nindustry, and all the usual appliances of good husbandry, where it\r\nonce nourished successfully, there is one or more ingredients wanted,\r\nin such a condition, that the plants can appropriate them to their own\r\nnourishment. And first of the inorganic matters.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of straw will vary from 2 to 3½ times the weight of the\r\ngrain. Suppose the quantity taken off the land be estimated at 2½ times\r\nthe weight of the grain. In a series of crops averaging 20 bushels of\r\nwheat per acre, for 30 years, we shall have as the result 36,000 lbs.\r\nof grain, and 90,000 lbs. of straw carried off the soil, charged with\r\nall the materials above enumerated, and probably sufficient to reduce\r\nthe land to a very small capacity for production.\r\n\r\nSome limited portions of the earth, as the plains of Babylon, when\r\nunder skilful cultivation, the valleys of the Indus and the Nile,\r\nand the fields of Sicily, almost since the days of the flood, have\r\nproduced luxuriantly, without the aid of manure to any extent; but it\r\nmust be remembered the former have their fertility annually renewed by\r\nthe rich overflowings of the rivers, which are charged with all the\r\nmaterials necessary to restore exhausted nature; while the soil of the\r\nlast, being wholly of basaltic origin, is rich in the alkalies, which\r\na year or two of rest, is sufficient to replenish in a soluble state,\r\nto be again taken up by the luxuriant crop. Hence, we have witnessed\r\na drainage of nearly all the products from these fertile regions, for\r\nthousands of years, with impunity. But they are exceptions which only\r\ngo to prove the general rule. The farmer must look to it, that all the\r\ningredients that enter into his crops, are supplied by the materials in\r\nhis soil, or a deficiency, or entire failure, will be the inevitable\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the constituents entering into the straw and grain, are\r\nabsolutely essential to their perfection, they are not all equally\r\nessential to be contained in the soil. It is indispensable, however,\r\nthat the earthy or inorganic portion of them be there, for these can\r\nnot be obtained elsewhere. How shall they be best supplied? Ashes, it\r\nis believed, afford the cheapest, as well as one of the most effectual\r\napplications that can be made for grain. Of the ten fixed ingredients\r\nenumerated as entering into wheat, ashes yield potash, soda, lime,\r\nmagnesia, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, in large proportions, and\r\nsilica and iron in smaller. The chemical operation of the potash, and\r\ncarbonate and sulphate of lime, however, when added to the soil, is to\r\nsupply the silica, in a soluble state, from its natural condition, (it\r\nbeing found in abundance for this object in every soil, except in such\r\nas are formed almost exclusively of peat,) for the demands of the crop.\r\n\r\nAn increased supply of lime and gypsum, beyond what is found in the\r\nashes, is frequently advantageous; and when the latter is beneficial,\r\nas it generally is, it should never be withheld to an extent in\r\nthe highest degree useful. Of the operation of this last material,\r\nbeyond yielding a portion of its sulphur to the gluten, we have as\r\nyet no satisfactory explanation. In respect to the theory of its\r\nconcentrating ammonia in the soil from the atmosphere, we have very\r\ncontradictory authority. Liebig asserts it, Johnstone questions it, and\r\nDana denies it; yet the increasing fertility its application produces,\r\nwould seem to give the weight of experience in favor of Liebig's views.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine and soda, if not furnished by the ashes in proportions\r\nsufficiently large, may be procured by the application of common salt,\r\nwhich yields both. The phosphoric acid may be obtained in any required\r\nquantity, by the addition of bones, which, dry or calcined, yield\r\nboth that acid and lime, phosphate of lime constituting 86 per cent.\r\nof bones. Most soils contain alumina in abundance to furnish the food\r\nrequisite for wheat; yet as it is one of the most valuable soils for\r\nthis grain, both as seizing upon and retaining ammonia, and furnishing\r\na firm foothold for the roots of the plants, it is important that lands\r\nintended for this purpose, should be adequately supplied with alumina\r\nas a top-dressing, if naturally deficient in it.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, above, all the inorganic materials for the purpose\r\nrequired. But there is about 97 per cent. of the crop yet to be made up\r\nof the organic constituents, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.\r\nHow shall they be provided for?\r\n\r\nFirst, by the selection of a calcareous or clay soil, which will\r\nfurnish a proper bed for the roots of the plant, and by their peculiar\r\nmechanical texture and chemical composition, will not only hold the\r\nmanures incorporated with them, but also draw some of the requisite\r\nconstituents largely from the air; the former absorbing carbonic acid,\r\nand the latter ammonia.\r\n\r\nSecond, by the liberal application of common farm-yard manure, to a\r\ncrop preceding that of wheat, which will leave a rich mould highly\r\nconducive to an abundant yield of perfect grain. An instance has been\r\nrecently given, of a Maryland farmer raising large successive crops\r\nof wheat, by the application of putrescent manure directly upon the\r\ngrain, and all injurious effects were obviated by the use of a moderate\r\nquantity of lime. This is a practice, however, which has not been found\r\ngenerally to be successful, causing either blight, or such rapid and\r\nluxuriant growth, as to crinkle and lodge. This effect is also produced\r\nin peaty and rich alluvial soils, where the silicate of potash, so\r\nessential to the formation of a strong, upright stalk, is not furnished\r\nin a quantity large enough for the object.\r\n\r\nThird, the liberal use of charcoal scattered through the soil. It is\r\nclaimed from its use, that the wheat crop of France has been largely\r\naugmented within the few past years. Several instances of its greatly\r\nbeneficial effects, have been noticed in this country; though its\r\ninfluence has not hitherto been felt on wheat, by an extensive Virginia\r\nplanter, in two or three recent experiments. The great power of\r\ncondensing gases peculiar to charcoal, was noticed by some of the early\r\nchemists. Murray mentions it, and Saussure gives a table of results, in\r\nwhich he shows that perfectly dry charcoal from boxwood, will absorb\r\n90 volumes of ammonia; 85 of muriatic acid; 65 of sulphurous acid; 55\r\nof sulphuretted hydrogen; 35 of carbonic acid, &c. This condensation\r\ntakes place in its pores, and does not produce any alteration, or new\r\nchemical compounds of the gases thus stored up; but their use in an\r\nagricultural point of view, is invaluable; for while the coal yields no\r\nfertilizing matter from its own substance, being nearly indestructible,\r\nit takes from the atmosphere in great abundance, and hoards up for the\r\nfuture use of the plants, one of the most evanescent, as well as most\r\nuseful materials for their perfection, viz., the nitrogen contained in\r\nthe ammonia.\r\n\r\nA fourth means for procuring a good yield of wheat, is by alternating\r\nwith clover, and turning in a liberal share of it as a preparation for\r\nthe wheat. This is practised extensively throughout the wheat districts\r\nof the United States, and has resulted in great benefit; for besides\r\nyielding a portion of food to the grain, it keeps the ground in the\r\nbest possible mechanical condition.\r\n\r\nA fifth means, is to return all the straw and chaff to the soil, as\r\nthey contain a large quantity of the identical materials required for a\r\nsucceeding crop.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing causes in full action, and an adequate supply of\r\nmoisture, whether from rains, dews, or artificial irrigation, the crop\r\nwill draw largely from the atmosphere for the supply of its required\r\norganic constituents. Carbon will be furnished from its carbonic acid;\r\nnitrogen from its ammonia; hydrogen from its vapor, dews, and ammonia;\r\nand oxygen from air, water, and soil.\r\n\r\nThe use of all these materials, _together with the selection of the\r\nbest varieties of seed_, will give the first three requisites of a\r\nwheat crop; large measure, heavy weight, and much flour.\r\n\r\nManures peculiarly adapted to the object, will tend in the highest\r\ndegree to produce the greatest quantity of _gluten_, the most valuable\r\nportion of the flour. It is true, that climate has much to do in\r\ncondensing, and of course, improving the value of wheat. It is a\r\ngeneral principle, that the warmer and drier the climate where it is\r\ngrown, the more valuable the grain. Wheat from the south of Europe,\r\nis worth more than when grown in the north; and that from any portion\r\nof the United States, owing to our superior dryness of climate, is\r\nmore nutritive than what is produced in Great Britain. This difference\r\nis increased from 8 to 14 per cent. in favor of the American. Gluten\r\nvaries in wheat from 8 to 35 per cent.; in rye, 9 to 13; barley, 3 to\r\n6; and oats 2 to 5. The _quality_ of wheat with regard to the quantity\r\nof gluten it contains, is nicely estimated and fully regarded by\r\naccomplished bakers.\r\n\r\nThe nitrates of potash, or soda, are frequently used in England to\r\nincrease not only the quantity, but especially the quality of their\r\nflour, a practice the high prices of land and produce may render\r\nprofitable there, though it is hardly to be expected they could\r\ngenerally be used in this country to a profit. In an experiment lately\r\ntried in England, one acre of wheat dressed with one cwt. of nitrate\r\nof soda, gave 42½ bushels, weighing 60¾ lbs. per bushel; another acre\r\ndressed with two cwt. yielded 47-3/8 bushels, weighing 60½ lbs.; while\r\nan undressed acre, in every other respect similar to the others,\r\nyielded only 27-7/8 bushels, weighing 61 lbs. Numerous other instances\r\ncould be given equally conclusive.\r\n\r\nAlthough we may not be justified in using these somewhat expensive\r\nsalts, so highly charged with nitrogen, there are sources of supply\r\nwithin our reach, especially rich in this material, and abounding in\r\nmany of the other ingredients of fertility. These are animal manures\r\nof all kinds, but more particularly urine, human excrements, and\r\nthe offal of animals, such as uncalcined bones, horns, hair, hides,\r\nflesh, blood, &c. All of these contain large proportions of nitrogen,\r\nand if carefully incorporated into the soil, would tend largely to\r\nthe increased production and value of the wheat crops throughout the\r\ncountry. An experiment was made in manuring wheat with cow dung, which\r\ncontains the smallest proportion of nitrogen, and this yielded 11·95\r\nper cent. of gluten. Another parcel, grown on land manured with human\r\nurine, gave 35·1 per cent. Thus it will be seen, that the maximum of\r\nvalue in wheat, may be reached, by the application of an article,\r\nalmost everywhere wasted in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is by skilfully feeding the wheat plant with all the nourishment\r\nthat it can take up, that the crops may be indefinitely increased. Lord\r\nHardwicke stated, in a speech before the Royal Ag. Soc. of England,\r\nthat the fine Suffolk wheat had produced 76 bushels per acre; and\r\nanother and more improved variety had yielded the astonishing quantity,\r\nof 82 bushels per acre. There is no comparison between the capacity\r\nof an animal and seeds, to produce results; for while the former is\r\nlimited to a definite growth, which no effort of science or skill\r\ncan augment, a seed may multiply beyond almost any assignable limit.\r\nWe have been shown a stool of wheat, originating from a single seed,\r\nthe growth of the present season, with 30 stalks, averaging from 100\r\nto 110 grains on each head. Over 3,000 perfect grains, is thus the\r\nproduct of a single parent in one season. It requires, then, but the\r\nproper pabulum to produce good wheat, within the wheat latitudes, in\r\nevery portion of the Union. Some of our worn-out eastern lands may be\r\nso totally unsuited to its growth, as not to justify the efforts of\r\nreclaiming or fitting them for this object, especially, while we have a\r\nregion in the west, every way adapted by nature, to its most successful\r\ncultivation. But we can not for a moment doubt, that when those western\r\nfields become comparatively full, industry and science will combine to\r\nclothe again those hills and valleys (now but partially robed with a\r\nscanty herbage), with teeming crops of wheat, such as gave to them, in\r\ntheir pristine days, a fame for fertility seldom exceeded.\r\n\r\n  R.

ALLEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _For the American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PENNSYLVANIA DAIRY.\r\n\r\n  _Philadelphia, Nov. 6th, 1843._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICING in your October number an account of a dairy on Long Island, I\r\nam induced to give you a description of one in this vicinity. Mr. Henry\r\nCharley has a dairy farm near Laurel Hill, where he keeps from 40 to\r\n50 cows, consisting of Ayrshire, Holderness, Alderny, Durham, and a\r\nfew natives; but mostly crossed with a fine, thorough-bred Short-Horn\r\nbull, and is raising full bloods, and high grades of this breed as fast\r\nas possible. He makes veal of his bull-calves, and raises all his best\r\nheifer-calves from his best cows for his own use. I found the cows\r\nluxuriating in a rich clover pasture when I visited them last summer\r\nbetween 2 and 3 o'clock, the hour for afternoon milking, from which\r\nthey were taken by the herdsman, and driven half a mile to the barn.\r\nThis is a stone building 100 feet long, 46 feet wide, with a wing of\r\n60 feet, the same width as the barn, high walls, and steep roof, which\r\nmake it capable of holding a great quantity of fodder, consisting last\r\nyear mostly of cornstalks, (some of which he bought very cheap of his\r\nneighbors, while others let theirs stand in the field and this spring\r\nraked them up and burned them,) rye straw, and oats unthrashed, all\r\nof which he cuts and steams--sometimes with a little hay cut also and\r\nmixed with the above articles. These are all steamed together, or each\r\nseparately, (as best suits the appetites of the cows) in a large vat,\r\nconnected with a pipe through which the steam passes from the boiler,\r\nwhich stands in a room adjoining with stone or ground floor. The\r\nchimney is of sheet-iron running up through the roof, and coal used\r\nfor fuel, renders the risk for insurance at a very low rate. The water\r\nis supplied from a spring running into the yard, and thence through\r\na pipe into the boiler. The cows are also watered from the same when\r\nthe weather is stormy in winter, and they are not allowed to go out.\r\nBut to return from this digression. After the fodder is sufficiently\r\ncooked, which takes but a short time, it is taken out into other\r\nlarger vats or troughs, with scoop shovels, and there left to cool;\r\nthen a suitable portion of Indian meal or ground rye, buck-wheat, or\r\noats, or any two or all four mixed and ground together, (which in my\r\nopinion would be better,) adding a portion of ship-stuffs, shorts, or\r\neven bran. This is the food for the cows at all seasons, except when\r\nthere is a full supply of grass. They are driven to a woods pasture for\r\nexercise and air when there is little or no grass. Air and exercise are\r\nindispensably necessary for the health of cows, and without these, the\r\nmilk will always be more or less unhealthy, according to the nature of\r\ntheir confinement.\r\n\r\nWhen the cows were brought into the yard, I was puzzled to know how\r\nthey were to be handled; but the stable doors being thrown open, each\r\ncow entered the door nearest her stall, and went to it with as much\r\nregularity as a young miss goes to her seat in a boarding-school. There\r\nis a drop in the floor immediately behind the cows, 14 inches wide and\r\n4 inches deep; into this all the excrements fall, the water running\r\noff immediately to a reservoir prepared for the purpose of receiving\r\nit; this, together with all the manure, was taken away daily, and\r\nput upon the land or crops or in a heap to make compost; so that the\r\npremises were kept perfectly clean and sweet. The floor was covered\r\nwith a thin bed of cut straw, which was passed off with the manure\r\nas it became soiled, and by being cut, worked immediately into and\r\nincorporated itself with the manure, without vexing the husbandman\r\nor gardener as long green manure so frequently does. The floor behind\r\nthe cows, between the trough to catch the liquid and the wall, is six\r\nfeet wide, with strong plank platforms or tables on which to set the\r\nvessels containing the milk. There is an open space directly over the\r\nvat for steaming, where all the feed is cut and passed down through\r\na hopper into the vat; also, hoppers or spouts leading from the meal\r\nroom over head directly into the vats, which contain the steamed feed\r\nfor cooking. The mangers in which the cows are fed are broad, so that\r\nthe food may be thrown into them with scoop shovels without waste, of\r\nwhich I found nothing of the kind about the whole premises. If a little\r\ntoo much feed is given to one animal, and consequently left, it is\r\ncarefully scraped out and fed to one having a better appetite; thus the\r\nmangers were kept clean and sweet. Mr. Charley feeds roots, but to what\r\nextent I did not learn. I hope he may be induced to write you a letter,\r\ngiving a description of his cutting machine, which does its work better\r\nthan any one I have ever seen; having two blades coming together like\r\nshears, cutting corn-stalks through their joints with as much apparent\r\nease as a pair of tailor's shears would cut a thread.\r\n\r\nThere is a stable for dried cows which were feeding for the butcher.\r\nBox stalls are provided for cows about to calve; the young cattle\r\nare kept by themselves, as are also the calves. Mr. Charley was not\r\nat home when I visited his dairy; but this disappointment to me was\r\nmade up by the kind Mrs. C., who, with justifiable pride, showed me\r\nher spring house with its large copper caldron for scalding her milk\r\ntubs, pans, pails, churns, &c. &c., in the best of order, all of which\r\nshe personally superintends and looks after; and whenever there is an\r\noverstock of milk for city customers, it is here converted into butter\r\nof the choicest quality, and each market-day finds her at her stand\r\nwith her butter and lots of garden vegetables, the raising of which she\r\nalso superintends and takes into the city at the dawn of day. That some\r\nfamilies are sick and others miserably poor, is not strange, to one who\r\nlooks behind the curtain and sees what can never otherwise be described.\r\n\r\n  S.

He gives tables of contents of two parcels, the first\r\ncontaining 30.3 per cent., the second rather more than 11 per cent.\r\nof sea-salt. I took the larger quantity, to prove that if dock-mud\r\ncontained sea-salt, it could be no objection to it as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIt is highly important that the tables of analysis of celebrated\r\nmanures should be correctly given, and if the editor of the Chronicle\r\ncan furnish correct tables, he will be conferring an important boon on\r\nthe agricultural community of the whole world.\r\n\r\n  WM. PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _From the American Agriculturist Almanac._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE closing month of the year is one in which every agriculturist\r\nshould take an interest, and for many useful hints we will refer the\r\nreader to the Northern Calendar for this month.\r\n\r\nCotton-picking will probably occupy this month until Christmas, when\r\nthis business will have been completed, if the culture has been well\r\nmanaged, and the season favorable. It would be well to start your plows\r\nand break up ground for corn; let nothing but cotton prevent--not\r\neven cleaning; for plowing is only one job; yet, if done soon, it is\r\ngenerally advantageous, and if bad weather should set in when it must\r\nbe done, time will be lost, and a drawback ensue, whereas by plowing in\r\ntime, cleaning can be done later.\r\n\r\nIn weather not employed about other labor more important, manure and\r\ntrim all kinds of vines and fruit-trees, except the orange tribe.\r\nTransplant evergreens and other trees, sweet briers, honeysuckles,\r\njasmines, &c.; sow late peas and beans, and set out onions for seed;\r\nset all hands at work in cleaning up for other crops, picking up\r\nlimbs, grubbing, cleaning up hollows, sides of bayous, cutting down\r\ncorn-stalks with hoes, gathering materials for making manure, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nIf you do not live in the immediate vicinity, say five or six miles,\r\nfrom a sugar-plantation, by all means keep bees. This can be rendered\r\none of the most productive branches of business of the day. Procure\r\na few swarms at first, and they will soon multiply to any extent\r\nrequired. Use sections of hollow logs, four or five feet long, for\r\nhives, if you have no other more convenient materials to make them\r\nof, and allow the bees to work over the honey a second time, that you\r\nmay avoid the injurious effects in eating honey which may have been\r\ngathered from poisonous flowers. If the above-named class of hives be\r\nused, there will be no necessity for killing the bees; for when the\r\nhives are filled with honey, they can be removed without harm from\r\nthe end opposite to that in which the bees are at work, and they will\r\nimmediately go to work and fill the vacancy. In most parts of the\r\nSouthern States bees maybe kept at work during the winter. If there\r\nare not flowers for them, they can be made to work over the bad honey\r\ncollected the season before.\r\n\r\nThis is also a busy month for the sugar-planter. He will be active\r\nin cutting and carting his cane with all possible despatch; and he\r\nshould employ one or more practical and intelligent men to conduct the\r\noperations of the mill. In the manufacture of sugar, we know of no\r\nbetter method than that given by Professor Mapes in a letter to Hon. H.\r\nL. Ellsworth, from which we make the following extract:--\r\n\r\n1. To cut the cane as ripe as possible, but before any acetic acid is\r\nformed; litmus paper, touched to the fresh-cut cane, will turn red if\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n2. Express the juice without loss of time, as every moment after\r\ncutting will deteriorate its quality.\r\n\r\n3. A small quantity of clear lime-water, say one quart to a hundred\r\ngallons of juice, should be added the moment it is expressed, unless\r\nthe juice shows acidity with litmus paper; in that case, no lime should\r\nbe used, but a solution of sal-soda or soda ash should be added, until\r\nit is precisely neutral.\r\n\r\n4. When the juice is neutral, free from excess of acid or alkali, it\r\nshould be evaporated in such an apparatus as would finish its charge in\r\n30 minutes; if the boiling power is too small, good crystallization can\r\nnot possibly be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe whole time occupied, from the cutting of the cane to finishing its\r\nboiling, should not exceed one hour.\r\n\r\n5. To know when the boiling is finished, place a thermometer in the\r\nkettle, and continue to evaporate until it stands at 239° Fahrenheit.\r\nIf, when placed to run off after cooling, it should be found too freely\r\nboiled, the next time boil to 240°, or, if too light to run off, to\r\n238°, and so on.\r\n\r\n6. The kettle or boiler should be so arranged, that the moment it is\r\ndone its charge should be thrown into a cooler, capable of holding a\r\nnumber of charges. The first charge should be left in the cooler with\r\nstirring, until the second charge is thrown in; then with an oar scrape\r\nthe crystals found on the side and bottom of the cooler loose, and\r\ngently stir the whole mass together: the less stirred the better; so\r\ncontinue at the letting in of each charge, to stir gently; and when all\r\nis in the cooler, let the whole stand until it cools down to 175°; then\r\nfill out into sugar-moulds of a capacity not less than 14 gallons. When\r\ncooled in the mould sufficiently, say fourteen hours, pull the plug out\r\nof the bottom of the mould, and insert a sharp point, nearly as large\r\nas the hole, some six inches; withdraw the point, and stand the mould\r\non a pot to drip.\r\n\r\n7. If the sugar is intended to be brown, leaving it standing on the pot\r\nfor a sufficient length of time, in a temperature of 80°, will run off\r\nits molasses, and leave it in a merchantable shape; it will probably\r\nrequire twenty days. It can then be thrown out of the moulds, and will\r\nbe fit for use. When moulds can not be obtained, conical vessels of\r\nwood or metal, with a hole at the apex, will answer equally well.\r\n\r\n  D.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _From the American Agriculturist Almanac._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLE all your accounts, collect what is due you, and pay what\r\nyou owe. \"Short settlements make long friends.\" Examine your farm\r\nstatistics, and see what have been the results of your experiments\r\nwith the different kinds of manures, seeds, modes of tillage, &c.,\r\n&c.; and note them well for future use. No farmer ought to be without\r\nsuch a book, in which all experiments should be carefully recorded\r\nat the time, and the results carried into a separate book for his\r\nown use hereafter; and if new and valuable discoveries are obtained,\r\ncommunicate them to some agricultural periodical for the benefit of\r\nthe world. Recollect, you have the experience of thousands to guide\r\nyour operations, and, by contributing to the general stock whatever\r\nmay be useful, you are but returning to mankind a part of the benefits\r\nyou have derived from them. But avoid twaddle and humbuggery, and\r\noft-published statements, and prolix or tedious narration, and give\r\nall the circumstances material to the subjects in the briefest,\r\nplainest, simplest language possible. Above all things, send in your\r\nsubscription to one or more valuable agricultural papers, and get as\r\nmany of your neighbors to subscribe as possible; and consider, in so\r\ndoing, you are benefiting yourself by it ten times as much as you are\r\nthe publishers. Summer is peculiarly the time for making observations\r\nand experiments, and winter the time for communicating them. _Remember\r\nthe poor_, not only in this month, but every month through the year,\r\nand especially during the inclemency of winter. You need not give so\r\nmuch to them outright, but endeavor to put them in a way of making\r\nthemselves comfortable, by affording them employment, by which, you may\r\nbe benefited, while doing them good. You thus confer on them a triple\r\nbenefit, by furnishing them the means of comfortable subsistence,\r\nteaching them to help themselves, and avoiding the habit of receiving\r\n_charity_, which insensibly weakens their sense of self-dependance.\r\n\r\nStock now requires increased attention: they must be well housed, or\r\nat least protected against wind, with a shelter to which they can\r\nresort in storms, well supplied with salt, and abundance of water,\r\nif possible, in the yard, where they can get it when they want, and\r\nwithout wearying themselves in looking for it, and wasting their\r\nmanure by dropping it in the road, or by a running stream or pond,\r\nwhere it will all be lost. Their feed should be regular, and given to\r\nthem as near stated times as possible. They look for their food then\r\nat certain hours, and are not uneasy and fretful till the customary\r\nperiod arrives, when they again fill themselves, and rest quietly,\r\ndigesting their food till it is time to look for another supply. If\r\nbrought up in regular habits, brutes are much better time-keepers than\r\nmany are disposed to consider them who have not observed closely their\r\nintelligence. Now is a good time to break steers and colts, while\r\nthe roads are smooth and hard. They ought to be early accustomed to\r\nhandling and the halter, and be gently treated, by which they are more\r\ndisposed to yield to the wishes of their master. If they have been\r\nalways used to good treatment, they will acquire a confidence in their\r\nkeepers, and the more readily submit to their guidance. 'Tis always\r\nbetter to train them with strong, well-broken animals. Sympathy has\r\nmore to do with the brute creation than they have credit for generally;\r\nand the good habits and orderly behavior of the older animals, they\r\nhave been accustomed to treat with deference, will not be without their\r\nwholesome effect on them.\r\n\r\nThis is the best month for spreading out hemp for dew-rotting, in the\r\nlatitudes below 40°, as it gets a whiter and better rot than if spread\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nKITCHEN-GARDEN.--Every fine day uncover the frames in which are lettuce\r\nand cauliflower plants; otherwise they will become spindling, from want\r\nof air. Hot-beds can now be made, for forcing asparagus for the table\r\nin January. If the ground is open, continue trenching for spring crops.\r\nWhen the ground is frozen, cart manure, repair fences, clean seeds,\r\nprepare tools for spring. Provide pea-sticks, bean-poles, &c., and\r\nfinish all that will be required in the spring, and which can be done\r\nwhen the ground is frozen.\r\n\r\nFRUIT-GARDEN AND ORCHARD.--Finish those things which may have been\r\nomitted the previous month. If the weather continues open, digging and\r\nplowing may be done advantageously. Perform any work that may tend to\r\nforward your business in the spring.\r\n\r\nFLOWER-GARDEN AND PLEASURE-GROUNDS.--Continue to protect your beds\r\nof bulbs, and also flower-beds and shrubs as directed in last month.\r\nShould the weather continue open in the early part of this month, bulbs\r\nmay still be planted. They should not be left as late as this, but if\r\nsuch has been the case, they had better be planted now than left until\r\nspring. Now carefully protect seedling bulbs. The more tender kinds of\r\ntrees can have their roots protected from frost by laying manure or\r\nlong litter about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AGRICULTURAL NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the steamship Caledonia, we are favored by the receipt of our\r\nEuropean journals up to the 4th November.\r\n\r\nMARKETS.--_Ashes_, both pots and pearls, have advanced, and were\r\nbrisk of sale. _Cotton_ had declined 1/8d. per lb. The recent advices\r\nfrom Bombay and Calcutta of the East India crop, were not quite\r\nso favorable. The stock of Cotton on hand at Liverpool on the 1st\r\nNovember, was 720,000 bales, against 520,000 at same period last\r\nseason. _Flour_ was flat, and little doing in it. _Naval Stores_,\r\ndeclining. _Provisions_ were about the same as by our last advices,\r\nwith the exception of Cheese, the finer qualities of which were of\r\nquick sale. _Tobacco_, steady and firm.\r\n\r\n_Money_ still plenty, and the low rates of interest prevail.\r\n\r\n_American Stocks_ continue nearly the same as at our last. Very few\r\nrecent transactions.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural School._--We see by the Berwick Warder, that an\r\nAgricultural School is established in Aberdeenshire, by the practical\r\nfarmers of that county, which promises to be a very useful institution.\r\nIt is superintended by Mr. R. O. Young, and we like its arrangements\r\nbetter than anything of the kind we have yet seen. To explain these, we\r\nmake a few quotations from the prospectus.\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen who may be intrusted to Mr. Young's charge for the\r\npurpose of being instructed in the principles and practice of Scottish\r\nagriculture, will have daily opportunities of witnessing the regular\r\nroutine of farming operations going on at the farm, and of taking an\r\nactive part in these operations.\r\n\r\nThey will be required to keep, in a farm-book, a daily record of what\r\nhas been done on the farm. Explanations will be given of the principles\r\nupon which the different operations are conducted, and upon which they\r\nwill be examined at stated times. Regular minutes will be kept by the\r\npupils of all such explanations, as well as of any facts that may\r\ncome to their knowledge through their occasional intercourse with the\r\nfarmers of the country.\r\n\r\nThere will be stated times set apart for reading, as text-books, the\r\nmost approved agricultural works of the day; and on the subjects of\r\ntheir reading Mr. Y. will minutely examine the young gentlemen, and\r\nwill also require them to write exercises upon given agricultural\r\ntopics--particularly those that bear on practice.\r\n\r\nWhile it will be Mr. Y.'s care to direct the attention of the pupils to\r\nchemistry and geology in their application to practical agriculture,\r\na branch of study until lately very little attended to, he will make\r\narrangements for procuring the services of the professor of agriculture\r\nin the University of Aberdeen, for a few weeks every summer, to give\r\nlectures and conduct experiments on the analysis of soils, manures,\r\n&c.--thus securing to the pupils more than a mere theoretical knowledge\r\nof this important branch of agricultural education.\r\n\r\nAs nothing is so much calculated to impress any subject upon the\r\nyouthful mind, as to invest it with a _personal interest_, Mr. Y.\r\nproposes to devote to the exclusive use of his pupils, a small farm, of\r\nabout 50 acres in extent, adjoining to his other farm. This small farm\r\ncontains a variety of soils, upon which experiments of different kinds\r\nmay be conducted, on a small scale. It will be possessed and managed by\r\nthe pupils, under Mr. Y.'s direction, and upon certain equitable rules\r\nas to each pupil's share of the concern. Each pupil will be required\r\nto keep regular books, exhibiting all disbursements and receipts, and\r\nthe results of all experiments tried, with every particular connected\r\nwith such experiments. Each pupil will be required to take his share\r\nof management, &c., and the profits of the concern, after paying a\r\ncertain moderate rent, will, at each term, be divided among the young\r\ngentlemen, in proportion to their respective interests. It is conceived\r\nthat such a plan will have a strong tendency to promote exactness,\r\nregularity, and business habits; but, without the consent of their\r\nparents or guardians, pupils will not be asked to join in this scheme.\r\n\r\nFARMERS' MAGAZINE.--_Meat-Salting Instrument._--The instrument\r\nresembles a common syringe of more than ordinary dimensions, and,\r\nalthough not quite so simple in its construction, it is intended to\r\nbe used in the same way as the syringe, provided the point or tube be\r\nnot exposed to the air. The advantages to be derived from the use of\r\nthe instrument are explained by the fact that a joint of meat may,\r\nin the simplest manner, be properly salted in less than ten minutes.\r\nThe brine is made of the usual ingredients, and after the salt and\r\nother substances are completely dissolved, the liquid is poured into\r\nthe machine, and the nipple or tube (the circumference of which is\r\nperforated with three small holes) is inserted into the most solid part\r\nof a joint of meat, and the contents are, by a very strong pressure,\r\nforced through the fibres until the brine is seen to escape on the\r\nsurface. For this purpose a smaller quantity of pickle is used than is\r\nemployed in the ordinary method of curing meat, and the bone (if there\r\nbe any,) in the centre becomes thoroughly impregnated with the fluid.\r\nBy the present mode of salting meat, it is a matter of some difficulty\r\nto inject the brine into the innermost part of a large joint, whereas\r\nby the process which is adopted in the use of Mr. Carson's instrument,\r\nthe size or substance of the meat presents no additional trouble to the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\n_Prince Albert's Annual Sale of Live Stock._--Since Prince Albert has\r\nturned farmer, he has an annual sale of his fat stock, and is said to\r\nrealize from 50 to 60 per cent. profit on it. The last took place in\r\nOctober, at which time 417 sheep, 55 oxen, and 9 cows and heifers, were\r\ndisposed of, realising him £1,743, (about $8,000;) a clever sum for fat\r\nsheep and cattle.\r\n\r\n_Produce of Ewes._--Count de Gourcey states in that part of his\r\nAgricultural Tour in Europe, just received, that Mr. Walker, manager\r\nof the late Duke of Gordon's estates, in Scotland, informed him that\r\nfrom 200 Leicester ewes, and as many Southdowns, they _bring up on an\r\naverage_, 450 lambs. We wish we had possessed this information when\r\nwriting our notes to Mr. Grove's letter in this paper, as it would have\r\nbeen something of an argument in our favor, regarding the difference\r\nof opinion existing between us about the number of lambs bred in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nNEW FARMERS' JOURNAL.--_Exportation of Cattle to Prussia._--One bull\r\nand eight heifers have been recently purchased in England, for the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society of Prussia.\r\n\r\nNETTING FOR SHEEP-FOLDS.--The fibre of the cocoa-nut is said to make\r\nthe most durable netting for sheep-folds; it out-wearing several sets\r\nof tarred-hemp netting, and is so light, that a herdsman can with ease\r\ncarry 200 yards of it.\r\n\r\n_Soiling._--Feeding animals in the summer-season with green food,\r\ncut daily, and given them in stalls or yards, is far preferable to\r\ngrazing--First, because the food is consumed with less waste; secondly,\r\nbecause rest is an equivalent for food. The bodies of animals do not\r\nremain stationary, but are constantly wasting in proportion to the\r\namount of exercise they undergo--hence, while they rove at large, they\r\nmust receive from time to time new supplies in the shape of food, to\r\nmake up for this waste, which are not needed when they are at rest,\r\nand consequently, by the system of soiling, less food will be required\r\nto fatten them. Thirdly, because by soiling there is an increase of\r\nvaluable manure, which, by the old method of grazing, was nearly\r\naltogether lost.\r\n\r\n_American Provisions._--Within the last few days, 204 boxes of American\r\ncheese have been received in Liverpool. Every year the quality of the\r\nAmerican cheese improves. Another article, which is arriving in very\r\nlarge quantities, is American lard, which is coming into use for many\r\npurposes for which salt and even fresh butter has been employed. Very\r\nexcellent salted beef has come from the United States in considerable\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n_Epidemic among Cattle._--This has broken out again in a most virulent\r\nshape in the north of England.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE.--_Miller's Safety Reins._--These consist\r\nof gut covered with leather, and are, therefore, proof against\r\nfracture; and being round, and of neat light appearance, form a rather\r\nornamental and sporting-like appendage to harness or saddle. They are\r\nmounted in this way:--They pass through a hook placed on the head of\r\nthe harness-bridle, and through a leather loop on the head of the\r\nriding-bridle, and come down on each side of the neck. About middle-way\r\ndown the neck is a coupling with two swivels, which receive the reins\r\nfrom the head, and they then pass through the dees of the harness, and\r\nthrough the turrets of the harness-saddle, and along to the front of\r\nthe splashboard to a rein-holder, by which they are held always ready\r\nfor use. The head of the horse and the turrets of the saddle being both\r\nhigher than the throat, and the coupling being short, and having leave\r\nto traverse the reins on each side of the neck, it settles on that part\r\nof the throat at which the reins, on being pulled, exert the greatest\r\nforce, when, the windpipe being forcibly compressed, the horse becomes\r\naffected in his respiration, and, therefore, stands still, or slackens\r\nhis pace for breath, which he immediately obtains on the reins being\r\nslackened. Thus, feeling he is mastered, the horse shows no farther\r\ninclination to run off again; but in case he should renew symptoms of\r\nstarting off, a few firm grips of the coupling on the throat will let\r\nhim feel the futility of his attempts.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the origin of the invention, Mr. Miller stated\r\nthat he was a farmer's son, and that, in his youth, he used to be\r\nemployed at times to assist in catching horses at grass, by means of\r\nsurrounding them with a rope, borne by a person at each end of it. He\r\nremarked that, in this service, although no restraint was laid upon the\r\nhorses when the rope rested on their chests, yet, whenever it could\r\nbe got upon their throats, they instantly stood still and allowed\r\nthemselves to be taken. The idea which this recollection suggested, of\r\nthe probable effect of pressure on the throat in stopping a runaway\r\nhorse, led Mr. Miller to the contrivance of his safety-reins. In his\r\nfirst experiment, the band which connects the reins under the neck\r\nwas attached to the headstall by hooks and straps; but it has been\r\nconsidered an improvement to allow it to move freely upon the reins, on\r\nwhich it settles in contact with the throat, in a proper position for\r\nuse when required.\r\n\r\nOur communications with Mr. Miller impressed us favorably in regard\r\nto his contrivance; but, wishing to see it in practice we availed\r\nourselves of an offer by him to afford us an opportunity of judging\r\nof it in operation. We, accordingly, on a day appointed, accompanied\r\nhim in a carriage drawn by one horse, for the purpose of trial; and we\r\nwitnessed as spectators, as well as made ourselves, repeated tests of\r\nthe reins, with the horse going at a smart canter, both on a level road\r\nand on a descent, and we invariably observed that the tightening of the\r\nreins caused the horse immediately to stop. No injurious effect seemed\r\nto be produced on the horse by the interruption of his respiration. He\r\nalways appeared to breathe freely, and to be ready to resume his work,\r\nas soon as the tension of the reins was relaxed.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, we consider Mr. Miller's invention to be a\r\nneat and simple, as well as, to appearance, an effective contrivance\r\nfor the accomplishment of its important object, in the prevention of\r\nthe disastrous accidents which not unfrequently occur from horses\r\nrunning away; and we think it reflects much credit on the ingenuity of\r\nits inventor.\r\n\r\nGARDENERS' CHRONICLE.--_Rhododendron._--There is a variety of the\r\nRhododendron ponticum growing here, which appears to be different from\r\nany of the others. It comes into flower about the same time as the\r\nothers, but instead of unfolding its blossoms at the same rate as its\r\nneighbors, it only opens a few at a time, and continues long in flower.\r\nIt did not cease flowering this season the whole month of August;\r\nconsequently was nearly a month longer in bloom than the others. It has\r\na southern exposure, and is sheltered from the north and east.\r\n\r\n_Blight on Grain from the Barberry._--In the Chronicle of August 19,\r\nunder the head of \"Vulgar Errors,\" we read as follows: \"People still\r\nmaintain that the barberry blights their grain.\" This is, nevertheless,\r\na matter deserving attention; for in this, as in many other instances,\r\na popular prejudice has been founded on truth, although the real cause\r\nhas been often overlooked. Some writers have treated this subject with\r\nrespect, and among them is Dr. Thornton. The latter says that the\r\n\"leaves are very subject to the _rubigo_, which will infect the grain\r\nin the neighborhood.\" Here the secret is at once explained, and the\r\naversion of farmers to the barberry-bush at once justified. The vulgar\r\nnotion is, that the barberry exercises some evil agency upon grain\r\nwithin a certain distance, and accordingly farmers will never suffer it\r\nto grow near their fields. They are right as to the effect, but they\r\nattribute it to a wrong cause. I have seen some remarkable instances\r\nof grain perishing in a semicircle, in front of a barberry-bush, and\r\nextending a good way into a field. Any one who has but superficially\r\nnoticed the barberry, must have observed that the leaves and young\r\nshoots of the shrub were covered with a peculiar kind of blight or\r\nmildew. Now it is by no means extraordinary that this should be carried\r\nby the wind into grain-fields, and infect the grain so as to cause its\r\ndestruction. This is the true explanation of the mischief caused by the\r\nbarberry to grain in its neighborhood. [This is the common explanation,\r\nbut if any one will take the trouble to examine the parasitical plant\r\nwhich attacks the barberry, and that of grain, he will find that they\r\nare totally different things. One is the Æcidium Berberidis, and the\r\nother some species of Uredo or Puccinia, for it is sometimes one and\r\nsometimes the other. We should as soon believe that a hen's egg would\r\nbe hatched into toads, as that the seed of an Æcidium would produce an\r\nUredo or Puccinia. We are aware of the facts mentioned by Mr. Wighton,\r\nfor we have seen them ourselves, and they form a curious problem yet to\r\nsolve.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE MARKET.\r\n\r\nPRICES CURRENT IN NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ASHES, Pots,              per 100 lbs.      $4 62      to  $4 68\r\n      Pearls,                        do.       5 12      \"    5 18\r\n  BACON SIDES, Smoked,           per lb.          3½     \"       4½\r\n      In pickle                      do.          3      \"       4\r\n  BALE ROPE                          do.          6      \"       9\r\n  BARK, Quercitron               per ton      23 00      \"   24 50\r\n  BARLEY                       per bush.         52      \"      56\r\n  BEANS, White                       do.       1 12½     \"    1 25\r\n  BEEF, Mess                    per bbl.       6 00      \"    7 00\r\n      Prime                          do.       4 00      \"    5 00\r\n      Smoked                     per lb.          6      \"       7½\r\n      Rounds, in pickle              do.          4      \"       5½\r\n  BEESWAX, Am.

Market--November 27.\r\n\r\nAt market, 1,150 beef Cattle, (110 from the south), 35 Cows and Calves,\r\nand 2,350 Sheep and Lambs.\r\n\r\nPRICES.--_Beef Cattle_ have slightly improved, and we quote $4.25 a $5\r\nto $5.25 a $5.50 for the best. 1,101 unsold.\r\n\r\n_Cows and Calves._--All taken at $18 a $27.\r\n\r\n_Sheep and Lambs._--Sales of Lambs at $1 a $2, and of Sheep at 1.37½ a\r\n$3.50. 100 unsold.\r\n\r\n_Hay_.--Sales at 62½ a 75 cents per cwt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMARKS.--_Ashes_, since the late news from Europe, have been in good\r\nrequest. _Candles_, especially those made of stearic, are brisk.\r\n_Cotton_. The day after the arrival of the Caledonia with advices of\r\na fall in England, this article receded nearly ¼ of a cent per lb.;\r\nbut a brisk demand springing up for export, it has recovered, and is\r\nabout the same now as before the reception of the late news. We hear\r\nnothing particularly new from the south regarding the picking, the\r\nweather upon the whole supposed to be more favorable. Export from the\r\nUnited States since 1st September last, 62,450 bales; same time last\r\nyear, 113,301; same time year before, 99,904. _Flour_. The continued\r\nnavigation on the canals, has brought us an unprecedented supply,\r\nand a large quantity has gone into store; a good business, however,\r\ncontinues to be done in it. The total arrivals this season have been\r\n1,440,000 brls. _Rye-flour_ is dull. _Buckwheat_, very scarce and\r\nadvancing. _Cornmeal_, dull. _Wheat_ is in good demand, and prices\r\nstiff. _Rye_, declining. _Barley_, _Oats_, and _Corn_, in fair demand.\r\n_Hemp_, dull. _Hops_, improving. _Molasses_, not much inquired for.\r\n_Beef_ and _Pork_, quiet, and little doing at present in them. _Lard_,\r\nmuch wanted. _Hogs_. Extreme rates now in Cincinnati are from $2.25\r\nto $2.75; we are free to repeat, however, that we believe the first\r\nquality of hogs will be worth $3 by Christmas. _Rice_, of the better\r\nqualities, scarce. _Seeds_, especially Timothy, in good request.\r\n_Sugar_, quite inactive. _Tobacco_, fine Kentucky, scarce and wanted;\r\nstems, none in market. _Wool_ seems to have taken a fresh start again,\r\nand prices have an upward tendency.\r\n\r\n_Stocks_. A large business continues to be done in these, and they are\r\nstill gradually advancing.\r\n\r\n_Money_ plenty, and seeking investment at the usual low rates.\r\n\r\n_Real Estate_ seems at last to have come into demand, and considerable\r\nsales in this species of property have recently taken place at good\r\nprices. It must henceforth advance. Our population and wealth have\r\nincreased in an unprecedented ratio within the past four years, and\r\nthere is no reason why real estate should remain at its late low\r\nprices, and transactions in it any longer stagnant.\r\n\r\n_Business generally_, the past season, has been extremely good; and\r\nwe do not hesitate to say, few years can show a greater amount of\r\nsubstantial profits. We consider the days of darkness as passed, and we\r\nmay now look forward to the future with the brightest anticipations.\r\n\r\n_Packing Pork._--On this subject we quote from the Cincinnati Chronicle\r\nof 22d November. For the benefit of our distant readers, who may\r\nbe disposed to send their orders here for pork, we give below the\r\npork-merchant's prices for _packing_ this season, based upon 60 cents\r\nper bushel for Turk-Island salt, 87½ cents for bbls., 28 cents per\r\nbushel for Kenhawa fine salt, and 75 cents to $1.50 per day, for\r\nlaborers. For receiving, weighing, and cutting the hogs, a block-fee of\r\n5 cents each.\r\n\r\nFor packing per bbl., including all charges, $1.60 _a_ $1.75. For\r\nsalting 100 lbs. in bulk, including saltpetre for the joints, $1.62\r\n_a_ $1.75. Smoking per 1.000 lbs., including washing, $1.25. Rendering\r\nlard, 37 _a_ 50 cents per 100 lbs., which does not include the price of\r\nthe keg or barrel--2 to 5 cents is also charged on each keg or barrel,\r\nfor nailing the hoops, boring, weighing, and marking. The cooperage is\r\ncharged at cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CORRESPONDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n--A. B. Your package of Essays is sent to T. C. R. of P., as directed,\r\nand we have written you in full in it. The sheep-articles shall be\r\ncondensed as you suggest, if we can possibly find room, and papers\r\nin any event sent to the gentlemen whose names are given. Good\r\nSouth-Downs, or Merinos, can be had from $10 to $20 each. It is not\r\nworth while to transport lower-priced animals such a distance. For\r\nRambouillets, $30 to $50 each.

K.\r\nMinor, in our next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n--From some unknown friend, we have received a tin case containing two\r\nfine paintings of cattle, sheep, &c. We should be pleased to know to\r\nwhom we are indebted for these, for no note accompanied them, and we\r\ncan hardly guess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBLACK GALLOWAY CATTLE.\r\n\r\nA pure-bred imported cow, and a bull of the Galloway or Kyloe breed of\r\nScotch Highland cattle, are for sale in this vicinity. These animals\r\nare very fine of their kind, and were chosen from one of the most\r\ncelebrated breeders of this stock in Scotland. The cow took several\r\nprizes at the agricultural shows before being shipped to this country,\r\nand gives a superior quality of milk. The bull is quite equal to the\r\ncow, and they will be sold at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nApply, post paid, to the Editor of this paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFARMING LANDS FOR SALE.\r\n\r\nFor sale, about 500 acres of choice farming lands, lying on the Erie\r\ncanal and Niagara river, 5 miles from Buffalo, and one mile below the\r\nHydraulic Works in Black Rock. There is a due proportion of cleared\r\nand timber land, and the soil is equally adapted for grain, grass, and\r\nroots. Its proximity to an extensive and growing market, as well as the\r\nconvenience, beauty, and healthfulness of the location, render this one\r\nof the most desirable situations in western New York. The most liberal\r\ncredit will be given to purchasers.\r\n\r\n  Address, post paid, R. L.

The collection at this establishment is unrivalled, and prices\r\ngenerally very much reduced; and the proprietors flatter themselves\r\nthat the catalogue will be found to surpass in extent of information\r\nand usefulness, anything of the kind ever before presented to the\r\npublic, and to be worthy of a permanent place in the library of the\r\nhorticulturist.

It is now about ten years\r\nsince this work was first published, since which time it has passed\r\nthrough many large editions, and the astonishing number of _one hundred\r\nthousand_ copies has been sold in the southern and western states, and\r\nthe demand is increasing.\r\n\r\nIt has just been revised and corrected, containing 900 pages, and\r\nexecuted in superior style. People may be disposed to smile when we\r\ntell them that they can save money by purchasing this book, but we\r\nthink we can satisfy them that such is the fact, In every family more\r\nor less is paid yearly for doctor's bills. A child is taken with a\r\nfever, or some other complaint, and from ignorance nothing is or can\r\nbe done effectually to check it. The physician is called, and a large\r\nbill is contracted; whereas, had GUNN'S DOMESTIC MEDICINE been on\r\nhand, a remedy could easily have been found which would have checked\r\nthe disease in its first stage, and not only have saved the purse, but\r\nperhaps the life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerican Agriculturist Almanac for 1844.\r\n\r\nThis work comprises 64 pages, double columns octavo, with numerous\r\nwood cuts, price $8 per hundred, 12½ cents each.
