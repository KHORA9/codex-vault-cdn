Now, we rejoice in the genial air and warm\r\nrains of spring, which clothe the earth with verdure; in the alternating\r\nheat and showers of summer, which insure the bountiful harvest; in the\r\nmilder, ripening sunshine of autumn; or the mantle of snow and the\r\ninvigorating air of a moderate winter's-day. Now, again, we suffer from\r\ndrenching rains and, devastating floods, or excessive and debilitating\r\nheat and parching drought, or sudden and unseasonable frost, or extreme\r\ncold. And now, death and destruction come upon us or our property, at any\r\nseason, in the gale, the hurricane, or the tornado; or a succession of\r\nsudden or peculiar changes blight our expected crops, and plant in our\r\nsystems the seeds of epidemic disease and death. These, and other normal\r\nconditions, and varied changes, and violent extremes, potent for good or\r\nevil, are continually alternating above and around us. They affect our\r\nhealth and personal comfort, and, through those with whom we are\r\nconnected, our social and domestic enjoyments. They influence our business\r\nprosperity directly, or indirectly, through our near or remote dependence\r\nupon others. They limit our pleasures and amusements--they control the\r\nrealities of to-day, and the anticipations of to-morrow. None can\r\nprudently disregard them; few can withhold from them a constant attention.\r\nScientific men, and others, devote to them daily hours of careful\r\nobservation and registration. Devout Christians regard them as the\r\nspecial agencies of an over-ruling Providence. The prudent, fear their\r\nsudden, or silent and mysterious changes; the timid, their awful\r\nmanifestations of power; and they are, to each and all of us, ever present\r\nobjects of unfailing interest.\r\n\r\nThis _interest_ finds constant expression in our intercourse with each\r\nother. A recent English writer has said: \"The germ of meteorology is, as\r\nit were, innate in the mind of every Englishman--the weather is his first\r\nthought after every salutation.\" In the qualified sense in which this was\r\nprobably intended, it is, doubtless, equally true of us. Indeed, it is\r\noften not only a \"first thought\" _after_ a salutation, but a part of the\r\nsalutation itself--an offspring of the same friendly feeling, or a part of\r\nthe same habit, which dictates the salutation--an expression of sympathy\r\nin a subject of common and absorbing interest--a sorrowing or rejoicing\r\nwith those who sorrow or rejoice in the frowns and smiles of an\r\never-changing, ever-influential atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf consistent with our purpose, it would be exceedingly interesting to\r\ntrace the varied forms of expression in use among different classes and\r\ncallings, and see how indicative they are of character and employment.\r\n\r\nThe sailor deals mainly with the winds of the hour, and to him all the\r\nother phases of the weather are comparatively indifferent. He speaks of\r\nairs, and breezes, and squalls, and gales, and hurricanes; or of such\r\nappearances of the sky as prognosticate them. The citizens, whose lives\r\nare a succession of _days_, deal in such adjectives as characterize the\r\nweather of _the day_, according to their class, or temperament, or\r\nbusiness; and it is pleasant, or fine, or _very_ pleasant or fine;\r\nbeautiful, delightful, splendid, or glorious; or unpleasant, rainy,\r\nstormy, dismal, dreadful or horrible. The farmer deals with the weather\r\nof considerable periods; with forward or backward _seasons_, with \"cold\r\nsnaps\" or \"hot spells,\" and \"wet spells\" or \"dry spells.\" And there are\r\nmany intermediate varieties. The acute observer will find much in them to\r\ninstruct and amuse him, and will probably be surprised to find how much\r\nthey have to do with his \"first impressions\" of others.\r\n\r\nBut I have a more important object in view. I propose to deal with \"The\r\nPHILOSOPHY _of the Weather_\"--to examine the nature and operation of the\r\narrangements from which the phenomena result; to strip the subject, if\r\npossible, of some of the complication and mystery in which traditionary\r\naxioms and false theories continue to envelop it; to endeavor to grasp\r\n_its principles_, and unfold them in a plain, concise, and systematic\r\nmanner, to the comprehension of \"_the many_,\" who are equal partners with\r\nthe scientific in its practical, if not in its philosophic interest; and\r\nto deduce a few general rules by which its changes may be understood, and,\r\nultimately, to a considerable extent, foreseen.\r\n\r\nThis is not an easy, perhaps not a prudent undertaking. Nor is my position\r\nexactly that of a volunteer. A few words seem necessary, therefore, by way\r\nof apology and explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1853, in the evening of a fair autumnal day, I started for\r\nHartford, in the express train. Just above Meriden, an acquaintance\r\nsitting beside me, who had been felicitating himself on the prospect of\r\nfine weather for a journey to the north, called my attention to several\r\nsmall patches of scud--clouds he called them--to the eastward of us,\r\nbetween us and the full clear moon, which seemed to be enlarging and\r\ntraveling south--and asked what they meant.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said I, \"they are scud, forming over the central and northern\r\nportions of Connecticut, induced and attracted by the influence of a\r\nstorm which is passing from the westward to the eastward, over the\r\nnorthern parts of New England, and are traveling toward it in a southerly\r\nsurface wind, which we have run into. They seem to go south, because we\r\nare running north faster than they. You see them at the eastward because\r\nthey are forming successively as the storm and its influence passes in\r\nthat direction, and are most readily seen in the range of the moon; but\r\nwhen we reach Hartford you will see them in every direction, more numerous\r\nand dense, running north to underlie that storm.\"\r\n\r\nI had seen such appearances too many times to be deceived. It was so. When\r\nwe arrived at Hartford they were visible in all directions, running to the\r\nnorthward at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour. In the space of forty\r\nminutes we had passed from a clear, calm atmosphere (and which still\r\nremained so), into a cloudy, damp air, and brisk wind blowing in the same\r\ndirection we were traveling, and toward a heavy storm. My friend passed\r\non, and met the southern edge of the rain at Deerfield, and had a most\r\nunpleasant journey during the forenoon of the next day. Taking the cars\r\nsoon afterwards, in the afternoon, for the south, I found him on his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I have fair weather now till I get home?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"There are no indications of a storm here, or at present,\" I replied, \"but\r\nwe may observe them elsewhere, and at nightfall.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept a sharp look-out, and, as we neared New Haven, discovered faint\r\nlines of cirrus cloud low down in the west, extending in parallel bars,\r\ncontracting into threads, up from the western horizon, in an E. N. E.\r\ndirection toward the zenith.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is that?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"The eastern outlying edge of a N. E. storm, approaching from the W. S. W.\r\nIt is now raining from 150 to 200 miles to the westward of the eastern\r\nextremity of those bars of cirrus-condensation; perhaps more, perhaps\r\nless; and under those bars of condensation the wind is attracted, and is\r\nblowing from the N. E. toward the body of the storm, and where the\r\ncondensation is sufficiently dense to drop rain. That dense portion will\r\nreach here, and it will rain from twelve to fifteen hours hence. As we\r\npass along the shore, and run under that out-lying advance\r\ncirrus-condensation, we shall see that the vessels in the Sound have the\r\nwind from the N. E., freshening, but we shall continue to have this light\r\nand scarcely-perceptible air from the northward for a time--_the N. E.\r\nwind always setting in toward an approaching storm, out on the Sound, much\r\nsooner than upon the land_.\"\r\n\r\nAs we approached the storm, and the storm us, the evidence of denser\r\ncondensation at the west, and of wind from the east, blowing toward it,\r\nbecame more apparent. The fore and aft vessels were running \"up Sound\"\r\nwith \"sheet out and boom off,\" before a fresh N. E. breeze, and my friend\r\nwas astonished.\r\n\r\n\"I must understand this,\" said he; \"how is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"All very simple. The page of nature spread out above us is intelligible\r\nto him who will attentively study it. The laws which produce the\r\nimpressions and changes upon that page, are few and comprehensible.\r\nAlthough there is great variety, even upon the limited portion which is\r\nbounded by our horizon, there is also substantial uniformity; and,\r\nalthough the changes are always extensive, often covering an area of one\r\nthousand miles or more, and our vision can not extend in any direction\r\nmore than from thirty to fifty, yet those changes are always, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, intelligible, and may often be foreseen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has meteorology made such progress?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. It has, indeed, been raised to the dignity of a science, and\r\nprofessorships endowed for its advancement. Some books have been written,\r\nand many theories broached in relation to it; and innumerable observations\r\nof the states of the barometer and thermometer, of the clouds, and the\r\nquantity of fallen rain, and the direction and force of the wind--made and\r\nrecorded simultaneously in different countries--have been published and\r\ncompared; and a great many important facts established, and tables of\r\n'_means_' constructed, and just inferences drawn, yet the _few and simple\r\narrangements_ upon which all the phenomena depend, and _their philosophy_,\r\nhave not yet been clearly elicited or understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have not the 'American Association for the Advancement of Science'\r\narrived at some definite and sound conclusion upon the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it has been with them, for many years, an interesting subject for\r\npapers and debate. Some very valuable articles, upon particular topics, or\r\nbranches of the subject, have been read and published. But the\r\n_Cyclonologists_, as they term themselves, and who seem to think the great\r\nquestion is, '_Are storms whirlwinds?_' appear with new editions and\r\nphases of their favorite views as regularly as the annual meeting recurs;\r\nand, though they have not convinced, they seem to have silenced their\r\nopponents. The only conclusion, however, judging from their debates, to\r\nwhich the Association appear to have come with any considerable unanimity,\r\nis, that they are yet without sufficient _authentic observations_ and\r\nwell-established facts, to authorize the adoption of the Huttonian,\r\nDaltonian, Gyratory, or Aspiratory, or any of the other numerous theories\r\nwhich abound. And they are right. The subject is mystified by these\r\ntheories and speculations of the study, founded on barometrical and\r\nthermometrical records, and the direction and force of the surface winds.\r\n\r\n\"The qualities of heat were among the earlier discoveries of science, and\r\nall the phenomena of the weather were forthwith attributed to its\r\ninfluence. Hastily-formed and erroneous views of its power, and the manner\r\nof its action in particular localities, and under particular\r\ncircumstances, have retained the credence accorded to them when first\r\nannounced, although subsequent discoveries have shown their fallacy; some\r\nnew theory of _modification_ having been invented to reconcile the\r\ndiscrepancies as soon as they appeared. Perhaps it is not too much to say\r\n(however it may seem to one not thoroughly acquainted with the subject,\r\nwho does not know that the _primary_ and secondary modifying hypotheses\r\nfound in Kaemtz, may be counted by hundreds) that there is not remaining in\r\nany other science, and possibly in all others, an equal amount of false\r\nand absurd theory, and of forced and unnatural grouping of admitted facts\r\nto sustain it, as in meteorology as at present taught and received.\r\nAstronomy, as a science, is almost perfected--the nature, and size, and\r\norbits, of the distant worlds around us are known--while constant changes\r\nand alternating atmospheric conditions, which all occur _within less than\r\nsix miles of us_, affecting all our important interests, and obvious to\r\nour senses, although much talked off, and made the objects of many\r\ntheories, are but little understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, did you acquire the information you seem to possess?\"\r\n\r\n\"By studying '_the countenance of the sky_,' for in no other way has such\r\ninformation ever been, or can it ever be, acquired. By a long-continued,\r\ndaily, and sometimes hourly observation of the clouds and currents of the\r\natmosphere, in connection with such reports of the then state of the\r\nweather elsewhere, as have fallen under my notice, and the effect of its\r\nchanges upon the animal creation--for very much can be learned from them.\r\nYonder flock of black ducks that sit on that inshore rock, above the\r\ntide--the wildest and most suspicious of all their tribe--although the\r\nair is calm about them, know well that a storm is at hand. They probably\r\nboth see and feel it. As twilight approaches they will fly away inland,\r\nforty or fifty miles perhaps, and settle among the lilies or grass which\r\nsurround some fresh-water pond, certain of remaining while the storm\r\nlasts, and for one day at least, out of danger, and undisturbed. Many a\r\ntime, in my boyhood, have I heard, in the stillness of evening, the\r\nwhistling of their wings, as they swept up the Connecticut valley, to\r\nseek, on the borders of the coves, and in the creeks of the meadows, a\r\nconcealed and safe feeding-place during a coming storm. And many a time in\r\nthe autumn, after they had all passed down for the season, when the\r\nindications of an approaching storm were clearly visible at nightfall,\r\nhave I waited for them to return, on the eastern margin of a bend in the\r\ncove, on the eastern side of a creek, to shoot them, though invisible, by\r\nshooting across the head of the wake, which they made upon the water in\r\nalighting, and from which the few remaining rays of twilight that came\r\nfrom the western sky were reflected.\r\n\r\n\"But I am far from being singular in this. That page is more extensively\r\nread than is generally supposed. Many plain, unassuming men--farmers,\r\nshipmasters, and others within the circle of my acquaintance--know more,\r\npractically, of the weather than the most learned closet-theorist, or the\r\nmost indefatigable recorder of its changes. Every one, by studying the\r\npage of nature above him, as he would the page of any other science, and\r\ntesting, by observation, the numerous theories invented to account for the\r\nvaried phenomena, may learn much, very much, that will be useful and\r\ninteresting to him, and which he can never learn from books, or\r\ninstruments, or theories alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said my friend, \"I am too far advanced in life, as are many\r\nothers, to commence such observations, and you must publish.\"\r\n\r\nI demurred, and he insisted.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to spare the time; and I can not neglect my profession,\"\r\nI urged.\r\n\r\n\"Where there is a will there is a way,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to make one's self understood without many\r\nillustrations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, they are easily obtained.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they cost money, and it is said 'science will not pay its way' like\r\nfiction and humbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said he, \"is a libel--such science will. Every one is interested\r\nin the weather--all talk about it--and thousands would carefully observe\r\nit, if they could be correctly guided in their observations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may get into unpleasant controversy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you do; you can yield your position if wrong, and maintain it if\r\nright, and _magna est veritas_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may be mistaken in some of the views to which it will be necessary\r\nto advert, if I attempt to systematize the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so--your mistakes may lead others to the discovery of the truth.\r\nBesides, the weather is _common property_, and every one has a right to\r\ntheorize about it, or to talk about it, as they please--even to call a\r\nstormy day a pleasant one, or make any other mistaken remark concerning\r\nit; and every other person is entitled to a like latitude of reply. And\r\nfurther,\" said he, with some emphasis, \"no important observation, in\r\nrelation to a subject of such interest, should be lost; and, if you have\r\nobserved one new fact, or drawn one new and just inference from those\r\nwhich have been observed by others; and especially if, from observation\r\nand reading, you can deduce from the phenomena an intelligible,\r\n_observable, general system_, it is not only your right, but duty, to make\r\nit known. Such a knowledge of the true system is greatly desired by every\r\nconsiderate man.\"\r\n\r\nTo my friend's last argument I was compelled to yield. I could make no\r\nreply consistent with the great principles of fraternity, which I shall\r\never recognize. The promise was given. My friend went on his way, and I\r\nwent to the daguerreotypist to procure a copy of the then appearance of\r\nthe sky, as the first step toward its fulfillment. The fulfillment of that\r\npromise, reader, you will find in the following work. It was commenced as\r\nan article for a magazine, but it has grown on my hands to a volume.\r\nJustice could not well be done to the subject in less space. It has been\r\nwritten during occasional and distant intervals of relaxation from\r\nprofessional avocations, or during convalescence from sickness, and it is,\r\nfor these reasons, somewhat imperfect in style and arrangement. But I have\r\nno time to rewrite. There is much in it which will be old to those who\r\nread journals of science, but new to those who do not. There is more which\r\nwill be new to all classes of readers, and may, perhaps, be deemed\r\nheretical and revolutionary by conservative meteorologists; yet I feel\r\nassured that the work is a step in the right direction--that it contains a\r\nsubstantially accurate exposition of the Philosophy of the Weather, and\r\nvaluable suggestions for the practical observer.\r\n\r\nI have inserted my name in the title-page, contrary to my original\r\nintention, and at the suggestion of others; for I have no scientific\r\nreputation which will aid the publisher to sell a copy. Nor do I desire to\r\nacquire such reputation. It can never form any part of my \"capital in\r\nlife.\" Nor has it influenced me at all in preparing the work. I have aimed\r\nto fulfill a promise, too hastily given, perhaps--to put on record the\r\nobservations I have made, and the inferences I have drawn from those of\r\nothers--to induce and assist further observations, and, if possible, of a\r\n_general_ and _connected character_--and to impress those who may read\r\nwhat I have written with the belief, that _they will derive a degree of\r\npleasure from a daily familiarity with, and intelligent understanding of,\r\nthe \"countenance of the sky,\" not exceeded by that which any other science\r\ncan afford them_.\r\n\r\nI have examined, with entire freedom and fearlessness (but I trust in a\r\nmanner which will not be deemed censurable or in bad taste) the theories\r\nand supposed erroneous views of others, for, in my judgment, the\r\nadvancement of the science requires it. Says Sir George Harvey, in his\r\nable article on Meteorology, written for the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana:\r\n\r\n     \"It is humiliating to those who have been most occupied in\r\n     cultivating the science of meteorology, to see an agriculturist or a\r\n     waterman, who has neither instruments nor theory, foretell the future\r\n     changes of the weather many days before they happen, with a precision\r\n     which the philosopher, aided by all the resources of science, would\r\n     be unable to attain.\"\r\n\r\nThe admissions contained in this paragraph, in relation to the comparative\r\nuselessness of instruments and theories, and the value of practical\r\nobservation, are both in a good measure true. And the time has come, or\r\nshould speedily come, when \"_pride of opinion_,\" and \"_esprit du corps_,\"\r\namong theorists and philosophers, should neither be indulged in, nor\r\nrespected; and when their theories should be freely discussed, and rigidly\r\ntested by the observations of practical men. Such measure, therefore, as I\r\nhave meted, I invite in return. Let whatever I have advanced, that is new,\r\nor adopted that is old, be _as_ rigidly tested, and _as_ freely discussed.\r\nLet the errors, if there be any--and doubtless there are--be detected and\r\nexposed.

Without\r\nsuitable arrangements for their diffusion and distribution, and within the\r\nlimits of certain minima and maxima, it would not have been habitable, or\r\nthe design of its Creator perfected. These arrangements therefore exist,\r\nand \"while the earth remaineth seed time and harvest shall not cease.\" Few\r\nand simple in their character, though necessarily somewhat complicated and\r\nirregular in their operation, the ultimate result is always attained. A\r\nbeautiful system of compensations supplies the losses of every apparent\r\nirregularity in one section or crop, by the abundance of others.\r\n\r\nFrom the operation of these few, simple, connected, and intelligible\r\narrangements for the diffusion of heat and the distribution of moisture\r\nover the earth, result all the phenomena which constitute the weather; and\r\nby studying them, and their operation, we may acquire an accurate\r\nknowledge of its \"_Philosophy_.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessary heat is furnished, or produced, mainly by the direct action\r\nof the sun's rays; and the most obvious feature in the arrangements for\r\nits diffusion is that by which the sun is made to shine successively and\r\nalternately upon different portions of the earth. Nothing animate or\r\norganic could endure his burning rays, if they shone continuously or\r\nvertically upon one point, or could exist without their occasional\r\npresence. Hence the provision for a diurnal rotation, to prevent the\r\nexposure of any portion of the globe to the action of those rays for\r\ntwenty-four consecutive hours, except for a limited period, and at a\r\nconsiderable angle, in the polar regions. But the earth is spheroidal, and\r\na diurnal revolution would still leave that portion which lies under the\r\nequator too much, and the other too little, exposed to the action of the\r\nsun. This is obviated by an annual revolution of the earth around the sun,\r\nand an obliquity of its axis, by reason of which the northern and southern\r\nportions are alternately and, as far as the tropics vertically, exposed to\r\nthe sun; and it is made to travel (so to speak) from tropic to tropic,\r\nproducing summer and winter, and other important phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis obliquity and consequent change of exposure are in degree precisely\r\nwhat the wants of the earth would seem to require. If it was greater, the\r\nsun would travel further north and south, but the alternate winters would\r\nbe longer and more severe. If it was less, the end would not be as\r\nperfectly attained.\r\n\r\nThe direct action of the sun's rays upon the earth, particularly those\r\nportions which lie north and south of the tropics, is not the only source\r\nfrom which the supply of heat is derived. Although there is a general\r\nincrease of heat in spring and summer when the sun travels north, and of\r\ncold when he travels south in winter, yet there are frequent\r\nirregularities attending both. Very sudden and great changes occur in each\r\nof them. Frost sometimes, cool weather often, occurs in midsummer, and\r\nconsiderable heat and tornadoes in midwinter. And ordinarily the maxima\r\nand minima of each month and, indeed, of each week are widely apart. Even\r\nin the polar regions, in midwinter, _where the sun does not shine at all_,\r\nthe same moderating changes with which we are conversant occur in degree.\r\nAn extract or two from the register found in Dr. Kane's narrative of the\r\n\"Grinnell Expedition\" will illustrate this.\r\n\r\n  JANUARY 1851, (LATITUDE ABOUT 74 deg., LONGITUDE ABOUT 70 deg.).\r\n\r\n  Date.

It will be seen that on the 3d of\r\nJanuary, when the sun had been absent some weeks, it was calm, the\r\nthermometer stood at 26 deg. below zero (the - or minus mark before the\r\nfigures indicates that), and the barometer at 29.62, with blue sky,\r\nsomewhat misty or hazy--(the letter \"m.\" standing for misty or hazy)--a\r\nstate of the air which existed most of the time when it did not snow or\r\nrain, and therefore is of no importance in this connection. The next day\r\nthe thermometer began to rise, and the barometer to fall. On the 5th it\r\nclouded over, and the thermometer rose rapidly, and on the 6th it had\r\nrisen more than 25 deg., and snow fell. On the 7th it cleared off, the\r\nthermometer fell rapidly, and the barometer rose. On the 8th the\r\nthermometer had fallen to 21 deg. below zero, and the barometer had risen to\r\n30.14. Another instance, in all respects similar, occurred the latter part\r\nof the month. We shall see hereafter that these changes are precisely like\r\nthose which occur with us, and every where. That, as in the polar regions,\r\nand whether the sun be present or absent, or obscured by clouds, and by\r\nnight as well as by day, the changes from warm to cold and from cold to\r\nwarm are sudden and great, and that the latter are connected with the fall\r\nof rain and snow--that every where in winter it _moderates to storm_.\r\n\r\nMany other instructive instances, especially in relation to the great\r\ndifference in the seasons in our own country, and upon the same parallels\r\nelsewhere, might be cited if it were necessary. But they will more\r\nappropriately appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nIn the above cut the isothermal lines are Centigrade. The zero of the\r\nCentigrade thermometer is the freezing point of water, or 32 deg. of\r\nFahrenheit. The boiling point of water is 100 deg. Centigrade, or 212 deg.\r\nFahrenheit. A degree of Centigrade is equal to one degree and four-fifths,\r\nFahrenheit. The 0 deg. line of the cut, therefore, is 32 deg. of Fahrenheit--the\r\nline of 5 deg. above is 41 deg. Fahrenheit--the line of 5 deg. below is 23 deg.\r\nFahrenheit, and so on. The reader, who is not familiar with the difference\r\nin the scale of the thermometer, is desired to remember this; for we shall\r\nmake occasional extracts in which the temperature is given in the\r\nCentigrade scale.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of those irregularities, especially in the same seasons of\r\ndifferent years, and when very great, is often sought and supposed to be\r\nfound in the presence or absence of spots on the sun, ice floes and bergs\r\nin the Atlantic, etc., etc. But neither the spots, nor ice, nor other\r\nlocal causes produce them. The cause will be found in the character of the\r\narrangements we are considering, and the irregular action of the power\r\nwhich controls them.\r\n\r\nNor is the temperature of the northern hemisphere, north of the tropics,\r\nequal in the same latitudes. Very great diversities exist in the \"annual\r\nmean\" as well as the \"mean\" of the different seasons. Accurate\r\nobservations at many points have enabled men of science to demonstrate\r\nthis by drawing isothermal lines (_i. e._, lines of equal average annual\r\nheat) from point to point around the earth, which show at a glance these\r\ndifferences. The annexed cut is a polar projection of the isothermal lines\r\nof the northern hemisphere, as far down as the tropic, copied from\r\nKaemtz's Meteorology. The dotted lines show the parallels of latitude, the\r\ndark lines the isothermal lines, or lines of equal annual average\r\ntemperature. The reader is desired to observe how rarely they correspond\r\nwith the parallels of latitude, and how they fall below in a few\r\ninstances, and in others with great uniformity rise almost to the pole.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the isothermal line of 0 or zero--that is, the line\r\nwhere the mean or _average_ height of the thermometer _for the year_ is at\r\nzero. At Behring's Straits this line is a little below the Arctic circle,\r\nor the parallel of 66.30 north latitude. Passing east over North America,\r\nit descends into Canada, almost to Lake Superior, and to about the 50th\r\nparallel: that is to say, it is on an average during the year as cold on\r\nour continent at the 50th parallel as it is near Behring's Straits at the\r\n65th parallel. Passing east, the line of zero rises again over the\r\nAtlantic Ocean until, in the meridian of Spitzbergen, it reaches, within\r\nthe Arctic circle, up almost to the 75th parallel. So, too, the isothermal\r\nof 5 deg. below zero, which is below the 60th parallel in Siberia, rises in\r\nthe North Sea, above Behring's Straits, to the parallel of 75 deg., descending\r\non the continent in North America to the 55th parallel, and rising again\r\nalmost to the pole at Spitzbergen, to descend again in Siberia, while the\r\nisothermals of 10 deg. and 15 deg. below zero, which in North America are but just\r\nabove the latitude of 60 deg. and 75 deg. respectively, ascend abruptly\r\n_surrounding the magnetic pole_, and _falling short of the geographical\r\none_. Let this projection of the lines of equal temperature, and\r\nparticularly the situation of the magnetic poles, be studied well, for we\r\nshall recur to it hereafter in illustration of many important portions of\r\nour subject.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from these facts, and were it necessary might be rendered\r\nstill more so by referring to others, that other causes operate in the\r\ndistribution of heat over the earth besides the direct action of the sun's\r\nrays upon it. Doubtless very considerable allowance is to be made for the\r\ndifference of seasons, and difference during the same season upon the\r\nland and upon the ocean; in mountainous countries and level ones. But\r\nmaking every allowance for them, the fact that other causes have a\r\n_controlling_ influence in producing the deviations still remains most\r\nobvious. Neither the difference of temperature between the land and the\r\nocean, or land surfaces of unequal elevations, will account for the\r\nelevation of the isothermal lines on different portions of the ocean, or\r\ntheir extension around the magnetic poles.\r\n\r\nReturning to a consideration of the arrangements for the diffusion of\r\nheat, we observe: First, that the earth itself is intensely heated in its\r\ninterior. This is inferred, and justly, from the fact that the thermometer\r\nis found to rise about one degree for every fifty-five feet of\r\ndescent--whether in boring artesian wells, exploring caves, or sinking\r\nshafts in mines. It is demonstrated, also, by the existence of hot springs\r\nand the action of volcanoes. Heat is supposed to be conducted from the\r\ncenter toward the surface every where, but with difficulty and slowly. It\r\nis also supposed to be conducted from the tropical regions toward the\r\npoles. Such is the opinion of Humboldt. (Cosmos, vol. i. p. 167.)\r\n\r\nProbably it reaches the surface and exerts an influence, also, upon the\r\nweather through the ocean, and by heating it in its greatest depths.\r\nLittle attention has been paid, so far as I am informed, to the question\r\nhow far the ocean is thus heated in _tropical latitudes_. Doubtless a\r\nportion of the warmth of the ocean there is derived from that source, and\r\nit has its influence in changing the temperature of the deep-seated cold\r\npolar currents of, the great oceans. Perhaps it may yet be found that the\r\nicebergs are detached by it in the polar seas--the observations of Dr.\r\nKane point to such a result. (Grinnell Expedition, p. 113, and also chap.\r\n48.)\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the inconsiderable quantities of heat supposed to\r\nbe derived by radiation from the stars, the planets, and from space. If\r\nany such are derived they are too inconsiderable to be of importance in\r\nthis inquiry.\r\n\r\nHeat is also carried, and in quantities which exert very considerable\r\ninfluence upon the weather, from the tropics to the poles by the great\r\noceanic currents which flow unceasingly from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these with which we are acquainted is the Gulf\r\nStream of the Atlantic. Gathering in the South Atlantic, and passing north\r\nthrough the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, it issues out through\r\nthe Bahama Channel, and flows north along the eastern coast of the United\r\nStates, but some distance from it, to Newfoundland, and from thence\r\ncontinuing to the north-east and spreading out over the surface of the\r\nocean--a portion of it mingling with the waters of the North Atlantic in\r\npassing--it flows up on the western coast of Europe, around the Faroe\r\nIslands, and Spitzbergen, to the polar sea; passing around Greenland, and\r\nperhaps through its Fiords, it descends again through the sounds and\r\nchannels of the Arctic regions into Baffin's Bay, and through Davis's\r\nStraits, burdened with the icebergs and floes of the polar waters, to\r\nreturn again to the South Atlantic. For reasons which will appear in the\r\nsequel, it has comparatively little influence upon the weather of the\r\nUnited States. Western Europe, however, Greenland, the islands which lie\r\nin its course, and the polar seas, are most materially influenced.\r\nAlthough not the only cause, it has very much to do with the remarkable\r\nelevation of the isothermal lines over the Northern Atlantic, and upon\r\nWestern Europe, as seen upon the map.\r\n\r\nA like oceanic current exists in the Pacific Ocean, the influence of which\r\nmay also be traced upon the map by the elevation of the isothermal lines\r\nat the northern extremity of that ocean, and upon the north-west coast of\r\nNorth America. A vast amount of heat is transported from the tropical to\r\nthe temperate and frozen regions of the earth by these great oceanic\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nAnother supply is derived from aerial currents which flow from the tropics\r\ntoward the poles. These currents exist every where over the entire surface\r\nof the earth, but in more concentrated volumes along the great \"lines of\r\nno variation,\" and greater magnetic intensity, on the western side of the\r\ngreat oceans, over the eastern portions of the two continents of North\r\nAmerica and Asia. Not, as meteorological writers suppose, in the upper\r\nportions of the atmosphere, having risen in the trade-wind region and run\r\noff at the top toward the poles by force of gravity, but near, and\r\nsometimes in contact with the earth. The influence of these aerial\r\ncurrents upon the temperature of the atmosphere, and in producing the\r\nphenomena we are to consider, is exceedingly important. We shall have\r\noccasion to examine them with great care and minuteness under another\r\nhead, for upon them, more than any other portion of the arrangements,\r\ndepend not only the diffusion of heat, but also the distribution of\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nStill another supply of heat, during the sudden changes, at least, is\r\nproduced by the action of terrestrial magnetism and electricity. Very\r\ngreat progress has been made within a short period, in the investigation\r\nof the nature of these agents. The identity, or at least intimate\r\nassociation or connection of heat, light, electricity, and magnetism,\r\nalways suspected, has been in various ways, and by a variety of\r\nexperiments demonstrated. The influence of magnetism if distinct from\r\ngravitation, is second only to that; and its agency in producing the\r\nphenomena we are considering is primary and controlling. We will only, in\r\nthis connection, ask the reader to note the situation of the north\r\nmagnetic poles (for there are two of them); the manner in which the\r\nisothermal lines _surround_ them; the fact that they are _poles of cold_,\r\n_i. e._, that it is colder there than even to the north of them. We shall\r\nrecur to this part of the subject again.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly considered, are the principal arrangements by which heat is\r\ndiffused over the earth.\r\n\r\nEqually marked by infinite wisdom, and equally interesting and important,\r\nare the arrangements by which moisture is distributed. Doubtless the\r\ngeneral belief is that this is a simple process; that water evaporates\r\nand rises till it meets a colder stratum of atmosphere, and then condenses\r\nand falls again; or that, according to the Huttonian theory, currents of\r\nair of different temperatures mingle and equalize their heat, and the\r\naggregate mass when equalized in temperature is cooler, and therefore is\r\nunable to hold as much moisture in solution as the most heated portion\r\nhad, and the excess falls in rain. But the process is by no means so\r\nsimple, nor is heat the sole or most powerful agent concerned in it.\r\nCurrents of air do not mingle, but stratify. Evaporation from the surface\r\nof any given portion of the earth outside of the tropics does not alone\r\nsupply that portion with rain. _Vast and wonderful, coextensive with the\r\nglobe itself, and perfectly connected, is the machinery by which that\r\nsupply is furnished even to the most inconsiderable portion of its\r\nsurface._\r\n\r\nTake your map of North America and note, in this respect, its\r\npeculiarities. It extends from the Isthmus of Darien to the Arctic\r\nregions, and from the 65th to the 160th meridian of west longitude from\r\nGreenwich, and has upon its surface a type of every climate in the world.\r\nFor the purpose of simplifying and illustrating the matter in hand, let us\r\ndivide it into five sections. Let the first section embrace Central\r\nAmerica and Southern Mexico, south of 28 deg.; the second, Northern Mexico and\r\nSouthern New Mexico, California, etc., between the parallels of 28 deg. and\r\n32 deg.; the third, Northern California, Utah, Southern Oregon, and Western\r\nNew Mexico, north of the parallel of 32 deg.; the fourth, the entire\r\ncontinent north of 42 deg.; and the fifth, the eastern United States, east of\r\nthe meridian of 100 deg.. These divisions are not intended to be entirely\r\naccurate in their separation, but substantially so for the purpose of\r\nillustrating the differences which exist in each.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram shows approximately, by dotted lines, the\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let us see in what a diverse manner, and to what a different extent,\r\nthey are severally supplied with moisture.\r\n\r\nCentral America and Southern Mexico lie within the tropics--their rains\r\nare tropical rains. The season is divided into wet and dry, as are the\r\nseasons of all tropical countries which are not rainless. During the rainy\r\nseason it rains a portion of nearly every day, and during the dry season\r\nthe sky is clear, the air is pure, and rain seldom falls.\r\n\r\nAll around the earth within the tropics, over the land and over the sea,\r\nthere is a belt of almost daily rains, varying in width, north and south,\r\nin different sections, but averaging about five hundred miles. This belt\r\nof daily rains is formed at and by the meeting of N. E. and S. E. trades,\r\nand travels north and south with them, as they do with the sun,\r\n_encircling the globe_. By this narrow belt a portion of the earth's\r\nsurface, an average of some 35 deg. of latitude, is supplied with moisture.\r\nWherever it is situated at any given period, the tropical rainy season\r\nexists; and when it is absent in its northern or southern transit, the dry\r\nseason prevails. Southern Mexico is within the range of this moving belt,\r\nand in its course to the northward with the sun, in our summer from May to\r\nOctober, it arrives over, and covers that country with a rainy season.\r\nWhen the sun returns to the south, taking with it the trades and this belt\r\nof tropical rains, that portion of Mexico is without rain, and dry, and so\r\ncontinues until the rainy belt returns in the following year. While the\r\nbelt is over Southern Mexico it is nearly all _precipitation_, and there\r\nis little _evaporation_; while that belt is _absent_ it is all\r\n_evaporation_, with little or no _rain_. Surely this is not consistent\r\nwith the prevailing belief of simple evaporation, ascent to a colder\r\nstratum, commingling, and condensation, and rain. Southern Mexico at least\r\nis not supplied by mere evaporation from its surface, and must therefore\r\nform an exception to that belief, and to the Huttonian theory.\r\n\r\nBut we shall recur again to the peculiarity of distribution within the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nTurn now for a brief space to Northern Mexico, Southern New Mexico, and\r\nSouthern California. In Northern Mexico, Southern New Mexico, Utah, and\r\nCalifornia, between the parallels of 28 deg. and 32 deg., and particularly west of\r\nthe mountain ranges, we find an almost rainless region, sterile and\r\nworthless, resembling that which is found upon nearly the same parallels\r\nof north latitude in Northern Africa, Egypt, Arabia, Beloochistan,\r\nAfghanistan, and North-western India; and in corresponding latitudes south\r\nof the Equator, in Peru, a portion of Southern Africa, and the northern\r\nand middle portions of New Holland. Why Northern Mexico and the other\r\ncountries named are thus sterile and comparatively rainless, we shall see\r\nhereafter, when we examine critically the machinery of distribution as it\r\noperates within the tropics. It is the fact that it is thus sterile and\r\nrainless to which we desire to call attention in this place.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartlett thus describes it:\r\n\r\n     \"On leaving the head waters of the Concho, nature assumes a new\r\n     aspect. Here shrubs and trees disappear, except the thorny chaparral\r\n     of the deserts; the water-courses all cease, nor does any stream\r\n     intervene until the Rio Grande is reached, three hundred and fifty\r\n     miles distant, except the muddy Pecos, which, rising in the Rocky\r\n     Mountains, near Santa Fe, crosses the great desert plain west of the\r\n     Llano Estacado, or Staked Plain.\r\n\r\n     \"From the Rio Grande to the waters of the Pacific, pursuing a\r\n     westerly course along the 32d parallel, near El Paso Del Norte, there\r\n     is no stream of a higher grade than a small creek. I know of none but\r\n     the San Pedro and the Santa Cruz--the latter but a rivulet, losing\r\n     itself in the sands near the Gila--the other but a diminutive stream,\r\n     scarcely reaching that river. At the head-waters of the Concho,\r\n     therefore, begins that great desert region, which, with no\r\n     interruption save a limited valley or bottom-land along the Rio\r\n     Grande, and lesser ones near the small courses mentioned, extends\r\n     over a district embracing sixteen degrees of longitude, or about a\r\n     thousand miles, and is wholly unfit for agriculture. It is a\r\n     desolate, barren waste, which can never be rendered useful for man or\r\n     beast, save for a public highway.\"--_Bartlett's Personal Narrative_,\r\n     vol. i. p. 138.\r\n\r\nTurning now to Central and Upper California, and Utah, and Southern\r\nOregon, we find still another peculiarity. Like Southern Mexico, they have\r\na rainy and dry season, but at a different period, and for a different\r\nreason. The dry season of California, etc., is the summer of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and her rainy season the winter. _California_ is, therefore,\r\n_dry_ when Southern _Mexico_ is _wet_, and _vice versa_. The belt of rains\r\nwhich supplies California with moisture during her rainy seasons is the\r\nbelt of _extra-tropical_ rains, which extends from the northern limit of\r\nthe north-east trades to the poles, encircling the earth. The southern\r\nedge of this extra-tropical belt is _carried up_ on the western coast of\r\nAmerica, and in that portion of the continent in _summer_, when the sun\r\nand trades, and the inter-tropical rainy belt travel to the north, and\r\nuncover California, etc., leaving them without rain for a period of about\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. IN SUMMER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the sun, with the trades, travels south, the southern edge of the belt\r\nof extra-tropical rain follows, and covers California, etc., again\r\nextending gradually from the north to the south, and thus their wet\r\nseason returns. The annexed diagrams by the shading will show the\r\nsituation of the rainy belts which cover Mexico, Utah, New Mexico, and\r\nCalifornia in summer and winter, and that the belts of rains are entirely\r\ndistinct and different in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. IN WINTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere again in this section of the continent, as in Mexico, evaporation is\r\ngoing on for six months of the year, and were it not for the return of the\r\nbelt of rains from the north, in the fall, would go on for the entire year\r\nwithout precipitation; and for the other six months precipitation is\r\nvastly in excess. Nor can this be reconciled with, or explained by, the\r\nHuttonian or any other received theory of rain. Here again it is obvious\r\nthat evaporation alone, however great or long continued, will not furnish\r\nthe evaporating section with rain.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of the continent lies beneath the zone of\r\nextra-tropical rains, and north of the northern limit of the N. E.\r\ntrades--is never uncovered from it, and has no distinct rainy or dry\r\nseason, although more rain falls at certain periods, and in certain\r\nlocalities, than at others. The climate of that part of Oregon which lies\r\nupon the Pacific, and the character of its rains, resemble those of\r\nNorth-western Europe, and will be further explained hereafter.\r\n\r\nComing to the portion of the continent which we occupy, the 5th section,\r\nwe find it different still--a most favored region. Portions of it--Eastern\r\nTexas, for instance--are upon the same parallels of latitude as the\r\nrainless regions of Northern Mexico, etc. Eastern Texas, however, is not\r\nrainless. Other portions are upon the same parallels as California, etc.,\r\nyet have no distinct rainy and dry season. We repeat, this section is a\r\nmost favored region--without a parallel upon any portion of the earth's\r\nsurface, except, in degree, in China and some other portions of Eastern\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nIt is not only without a distinct rainy and dry season, but it is watered\r\nby an average, annually, of more than forty inches of rain, while Europe,\r\nalthough bounded on three sides by seas and oceans, and apparently much\r\nmore favorably situated, receives annually an average of only about\r\ntwenty-five--if we except Norway, and one or two other places, where the\r\nfall is excessive. The distribution of this supply of moisture over the\r\nUnited States is, in other respects, wonderful. Iowa, in the interior of\r\nthe continent, far away from the great oceans, on the east or west, or the\r\nGulf of Mexico on the south, receives fifty inches; some ten or fifteen\r\ninches more than fall upon the slope east of the Alleghanies, and\r\ncontiguous to the great Atlantic (from which all our storms are,\r\nerroneously, supposed to be derived), and the average over the entire\r\ngreat interior valley is about forty-five inches, falling at all seasons\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nObserve, then, by way of recapitulation: Southern Mexico has a rainy\r\nseason furnished by the belt of _inter_-tropical rains, which _travels up\r\nover it from the south_ in summer. California has a rainy season, which is\r\nfurnished by the _extra_-tropical belt of rains, which travels _down from\r\nthe north_, and covers it in winter. Northern Mexico and the adjoining\r\nregions west of the 100th meridian are between the limits of the two, and\r\nneither travels far enough to reach them, except for brief and uncertain\r\nperiods; they are comparatively rainless; while the eastern portion of\r\nthe continent, _in all latitudes_, unlike the others, is without a\r\ndistinctly marked dry season, or a rainless region, and with the exception\r\nof occasional droughts, is abundantly supplied with rain at all seasons of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what is the explanation of all this? What produces the\r\nextra-tropical belt of regular rains surrounding the earth, north of the\r\nparallel of 30 deg. north, in some places, and 35 deg. in others, extending to the\r\npole, with its southern edge traveling up ten or more degrees in summer,\r\nleaving large portions of the earth subject to a dry season; and back\r\nagain in the winter to give them a rainy one? What produces the narrow\r\nbelt of inter-tropical rains, encircling the earth; traveling up and down\r\nevery year over an average of 35 deg. of latitude, supplying every portion of\r\nit alternately with rain? And what connects the two together over the\r\neastern portion of North America, so as to leave no distinctly marked wet\r\nand dry season, and no rainless and sterile portion there? Are all these\r\nthe result of simple evaporation, ascent to a colder region, condensation,\r\nand descent again? Demonstrably not. Of the forty inches which fall\r\nannually upon the middle and eastern portions of the United States, an\r\naverage probably of one-half or twenty inches, runs off by the rivers to\r\nthe ocean, or is carried away eastward by the westerly and north-westerly\r\nevaporating winds. The same is true, in degree, of the rain which falls\r\nupon the other portions. Evaporation, therefore, could not keep up the\r\nsupply. From whence, then, does it come? this twenty inches, thus lost by\r\nthe rivers and winds, and with such wonderful regularity every year.\r\n\r\n\"All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. _Note the place\r\nwhence the rivers come, hither they return again._\"\r\n\r\nBut how is it that they thus return with such wonderful regularity, in a\r\nnarrow traveling belt of daily rains within the tropics, and a movable\r\nbelt of irregular rains without the tropics, extending to the poles,\r\nleaving a space on each side of the equator encircling the earth in like\r\nmanner (except at two points, _viz._, Eastern Asia and Eastern North\r\nAmerica), from which they do not go, and to which they do not return, and\r\nwhich is almost entirely unfurnished with rain? And all this without any\r\nrelation, whatever, to the contiguity of the oceans? Obviously this is not\r\nthe work of mere evaporation, or of the accidental or irregular\r\ncommingling of winds with different dew points, or quantities of moisture\r\nin solution, or accidental, irregular changes of barometric pressure. _It\r\nis one vast, wonderful, connected, and regular system--co-extensive with\r\nthe globe--necessary to the return of moisture from the oceans upon the\r\nmost inconsiderable portion of it, and to the condensation of the local\r\nmoisture of evaporation; and by it the waters are returned from the oceans\r\nas regularly and bountifully upon the far interior of the great continents\r\nin the same latitudes, as upon the \"isles which rest in their bosoms.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to an examination of this connected atmospheric\r\nmachinery, and an investigation of the particular ocean from which our\r\nrivers return, it may be well to look at the form in which they appear to\r\nreturn, that we may have a clear understanding of terms.\r\n\r\nThey seem to return in the form of clouds, and in storms and showers,\r\nalthough, in truth, they return in regular, uniform, ordinarily invisible\r\ncurrents, and the storms and showers are but condensations in, and\r\ndischarges from portions of those currents, aided by the local moisture of\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nThe term _storms_, seems to be used by European meteorologists to denote\r\nwhat we term thunder showers or gusts, and tornados; while what we call\r\nstorms are denominated by them regular rains. As the terms are extensively\r\nin use in this country, we must adhere to the meaning attached to them\r\n_here_ rather than _there_.\r\n\r\nStorms with us, then, are regular rains of from six to forty-eight or more\r\nhours' continuance: generally without lightning, or thunder, or gusts, and\r\nusually with wind of more or less force, from some easterly point. They\r\nare called north-east storms, or south-east storms, according to the\r\npoint from which the surface winds blow. Practically we shall find that\r\nthis distinction is of some importance, for the north-east storms are the\r\nlongest, lasting generally twenty-four hours, or more, while the\r\nsouth-east ones seldom, if ever, continue as long.\r\n\r\nThese storms extend over a considerable surface, rarely less than one\r\nhundred miles in one direction or another, and sometimes fifteen hundred,\r\nor more. Distinct showers cover but a small surface, sometimes not more\r\nthan forty to one hundred rods, as in the tornado, and rarely more than\r\nten miles. Belts of showers, each new one forming a little more to the\r\nsouth, often, in summer, pass across the country, following each other in\r\nsuccession; and these belts may be of considerable width, say thirty to\r\none hundred and fifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe clouds which constitute the storms and showers differ in appearance\r\nand character, as well in the active as in the forming state. Clouds are\r\nof distinct characters, alike, substantially, every where under like\r\ncircumstances; and a distinct nomenclature has been applied to them by Dr.\r\nHoward, of London. He notes three kinds of primary clouds: _viz._, cirrus,\r\nstratus, and cumulus; and inasmuch as the boundary line between them is\r\nnot very distinct, certain compounds of the three, _viz._: cirro-stratus,\r\ncirro-cumulus, and cumulo-stratus. This nomenclature is every where\r\nreceived, and portions of it are of great practical importance.\r\n\r\nThe three principal descriptions of cloud, _viz._: the cirrus, the\r\nstratus, and the cumulus, we have very much as they have in Europe, and\r\ndoubtless as they exist every where outside of the tropics. The nimbus,\r\nanother cloud described by him, is not distinct from the cumulus or\r\nstratus. An isolated, limited thunder-shower in a clear sky, presents the\r\nappearance of a nimbus, as shown in the cuts, but the basis of it is a\r\ncumulus, and it differs from an ordinary fair-weather cumulus merely in\r\nthe dark and fringe-like appearance of the rain as it is falling from its\r\nlower surface, and sometimes in the existence of a stratus above and in\r\nconnection with it. A similar form is often assumed by the peculiar clouds\r\nof the N. W. winds in March or November, when they assume the form of\r\n_squalls_, and drop flurries of snow. The nimbus, therefore, is not a\r\ndistinct cloud, but an appearance which the cumulus, stratus, or\r\ncirro-stratus has in a stormy or showery state, and does not deserve a\r\ndistinct name. It is but a cumulus, or a stratus, or cirro-stratus\r\ndissolving in snow or rain. It is important that this term should be\r\nabandoned. It tends to confuse and prevent a clear understanding of the\r\ndifference in the character of the clouds, and in relation to which\r\nprecision is both difficult and desirable.\r\n\r\nThe figures on pages 27 and 29, show the different kinds of clouds as\r\ndesignated by Howard. They are copied from the engravings in the sixth\r\nedition of Maury's \"Sailing Directions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Figure 5.\r\n    The cirrus is indicated by      1 bird.\r\n    The cirro-cumulus by            2  \"\r\n    The cirro-stratus by            3  \"\r\n    The cumulo-stratus by           4  \"\r\n\r\n  Figure 6.\r\n    The cirrus by                   1  \"\r\n    The cumulus by                  3  \"\r\n    The stratus by                  2  \"\r\n    The nimbus by                   4  \"\r\n\r\nHow far these representations correspond with the actual appearance of the\r\ndifferent compound forms in England, I can not say. But although they\r\nconvey a _general_ idea, _they are not sufficiently accurate for practical\r\nillustration or observation here_. Indeed Howard himself has omitted from\r\nhis last edition his plate of the clouds, assigning as a reason, \"that the\r\nreal student will acquire his knowledge in a more solid manner by the\r\nobservation of nature, without the aid of drawings, and that the _more\r\nsuperficial are liable to be led into error by them_.\" The collection of\r\nforms in the cuts _does not contain some very important ones_, and\r\ncontains some which are not distinct forms; but they may aid us somewhat\r\nin this inquiry, and, therefore, I have copied them. It is well, also, for\r\nthe reader to have the generally received description before him.\r\n\r\nBut for the purpose of _practical_ illustration hereafter, and greater\r\nprecision, I shall follow a somewhat different order in describing them,\r\nand introduce two forms of _scud_ quite as important, practically, as any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, commencing at the earth, we have what may be properly termed\r\n_fog_, or low fog. This forms, in still clear weather, in the valleys, and\r\nover the surface of the rivers and other bodies of water, during the\r\nnight, and most frequently the latter part of it, and is at its acme at\r\nsunrise, or soon after, limiting vision horizontally and perpendicularly,\r\nand dissolving away during the forenoon. It is rarely more than from two\r\nto four hundred feet in height at its upper surface, and often much less,\r\nand is composed of vesicular condensed vapor, sometimes sufficiently dense\r\nto fall in mist, and is doubtless in composition substantially what the\r\nclouds are in the other strata of the atmosphere, as observed by us, or\r\npassed through by aeronauts. I have never seen it carried up to any\r\nconsiderable height into the other strata by any of the supposed ascending\r\ncurrents, to form permanent clouds, and shall have occasion to allude to\r\nthe fact in another connection. It disappears usually before mid-day, and\r\nhas, when thus formed, no connection with any clouds which furnish rain.\r\n\r\nTo this Dr. Howard originally gave the name of stratus, and so it is\r\nrepresented upon the cut; but the latter term may be with greater\r\npropriety applied to the smooth uniform cloud in the superior strata from\r\nwhich the rain or snow is known to fall, and I shall retain and so apply\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe next in order, ascending, is high fog. This is usually from one to\r\ntwo thousand feet in height at its lower surface. It forms, like low fog,\r\nduring the night and in still weather; and is rarely, if ever, connected\r\nwith clouds which furnish rain. It breaks away and disappears between ten\r\nand twelve in the forenoon, usually passing off to the eastward. This fog\r\nis most commonly seen in summer and autumn, particularly the latter, and\r\nunless distinguished from cloud will deceive the weather-watcher. It is\r\nreadily distinguishable. Although often very dense, obscuring the light of\r\nthe sun as perfectly as the clouds of a north-east storm, it differs from\r\nthem. It forms in still clear weather, is present only in the morning, is\r\nperfectly uniform, and, before its dissolution commences, without breaks,\r\nor light and shade, or apparent motion, and unaccompanied by scud or\r\nsurface wind. The storm clouds are never entirely uniform, or without\r\nspots of light and shade, by which their nature can be discerned, and\r\nrarely, when as dense as high fog, without scud running under them and\r\nsurface winds.\r\n\r\nThere is another fog still, connected with rain storms, but it does not\r\noften precede them; occurring at all seasons, but most commonly in\r\nconnection with the warm S. E. thaws and rains of winter and spring; and\r\nwhich usually comes on _after_ the rain has commenced and continued for\r\nawhile, and the easterly wind has abated; occupying probably the entire\r\nspace from the earth to the inferior surface of the rain clouds or\r\nstratus. Practically this does not require any further notice. It is an\r\n_incident_ of the storm. When formed it remains while the storm clouds\r\nremain, and passes off with them. It is sometimes exceedingly dense in\r\nFebruary and March, when it accompanies a thaw, and if there is a\r\nconsiderable depth of snow, it has the credit of aiding essentially in its\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nMingled with the smoke of London, it produced there the memorable _dark\r\nday_ of the 24th of February, 1832, and at various other times has\r\nproduced others of like character. (See Howard's Climate of London, vol.\r\niii. pp. 36, 207, 303.) These fogs have been so dense there that every\r\nkind of locomotion was dangerous, even _with lanterns, at mid-day_.\r\n\r\nThe next in order, ascending, are the storm scud, which float in the\r\nnorth-east or easterly, south-east or southerly wind, before and during\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nThese, as the reader will hereafter see, are, _practically_, very\r\nimportant forms of cloud condensation--although they have found no place\r\nin any practical or scientific description given of the clouds, and are\r\nnot upon the cuts. They are patches of foggy seeming clouds of all sizes,\r\nmore or less connected together by thin portions of similar condensation,\r\noften passing to the westward, south-westward, north-westward, or\r\nnorthward with great rapidity. Their average height is about half a mile,\r\nbut they often run much lower. They are usually of an \"ashy gray\" color.\r\nThe annexed cut shows one phase of them, from among many taken by\r\ndaguerreotype. The arrows pointing to the west show the scud distinguished\r\nfrom the smooth partially formed stratus above. This view was taken a few\r\nhours prior to the setting in of a heavy S. E. rain storm. It is a\r\nnortherly view.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about the same height, but in a _different state of the atmosphere_,\r\nfloat the peculiar fair-weather clouds of the N. W. wind. They usually\r\nform in a clear sky, and pass with considerable rapidity to the S. E.\r\nSometimes they are quite large, approaching the cumulus in form, and\r\nwhite, with dark under surfaces, and at others, in the month of November\r\nparticularly, are entirely dark, and assume the character of squalls and\r\ndrop flurries of snow; and then resemble the nimbus of Howard. They assume\r\nat different times and in different seasons, different shapes like those\r\nof the scud, the cumulus, or the stratus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey form and float in the peculiar N. W. current which is usually a\r\nfair-weather wind, and are never connected with storms. In mild weather\r\nthey are usually white, and in cold weather sometimes very black, and at\r\nall times differ _in color_ from the ashy gray scud of the storm. This\r\nvariety is not represented upon the general cuts. The annexed diagram\r\nshows one phase of them, but they are readily observable at all seasons of\r\nthe year, when the N. W. wind is prevailing; differing in appearance\r\naccording to the season. Let these, as well as the storm scud, be\r\ncarefully observed and studied by the reader, and let no opportunity to\r\nfamiliarize himself with their appearance be lost. A brief glance at\r\neach recurrence of easterly or north-westerly wind will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMER CUMULI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _cumuli_ appear in isolated clouds of every size, or in vast clouds\r\ncomposed of aggregated masses, as the peculiar cloud of the thunder\r\nshower. They form as low down as the scud or fair-weather cloud of the N.\r\nW. wind, which, for convenience, I will call N. W. _scud_; and often in\r\nviolent showers, and particularly in hail storms, extend up as far as the\r\ndensity of the atmosphere will permit them to form. Professor Espy thinks\r\nhe has measured their tops at an altitude of ten miles. Others have\r\nestimated their height, when most largely developed, at twelve miles; but\r\nit is very doubtful whether the atmosphere can contain the moisture\r\nnecessary to form so dense a cloud at that elevation. It is their immense\r\nheight, however, whether it be six, or eight, or ten miles, together with\r\nthe sudden and violent electric action, condensing suddenly all the\r\nmoisture contained in the atmosphere within the space occupied by the\r\ncloud, which produces such sudden and heavy falls of rain or hail. As the\r\nrain drops or hail, when formed at such an elevation, in falling through\r\nthe partially condensed vapor of the cloud must necessarily enlarge by\r\naccretion from the particles with which they come in contact, and probably\r\nalso by attraction, their size when they reach the earth, though\r\nfrequently very considerable, is not a matter of astonishment. The cumulus\r\nis represented in the general plate with sufficient accuracy to show its\r\npeculiar character.\r\n\r\nIn summer, when the air is calm, the weather warm, and no storm is\r\napproaching, there is always, in the day time, a tendency to the formation\r\nof cumuli. This tendency exhibits itself about ten o'clock in the\r\nforenoon, and they gradually form and enlarge until about two in the\r\nafternoon; and after that, if they do not continue to enlarge and form\r\nshowers, they melt away and disappear before nightfall. Sometimes in July\r\nand August the atmosphere will be studded with them at mid-day, floating\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile from the earth (in a level country), gently\r\nand slowly away to the eastward. At times it may seem as if they must\r\ncoalesce and form showers, yet they frequently do not, but gradually melt\r\naway, as before stated.\r\n\r\nThe cumulus is the principal cloud of the tropics, and is not often seen\r\nwith us except in summer, or when our weather is tropical in character.\r\n\r\nThe engraving on the preceding page, shows a phase of these fair-weather\r\nsummer cumuli.\r\n\r\nThe last in order occupying (with their compounds) the higher portions of\r\nthe atmosphere, are the cirrus and stratus. The cirrus is often the\r\nskeleton of the other, and precedes it in formation.\r\n\r\nThese are the proper clouds of the storm, in our sense of the term. While,\r\nhowever, the cirrus remains a cirrus, it furnishes no rain. When it\r\nextends and expands, and its threads widen and coalesce into cirro-stratus\r\nand stratus, or it induces a layer of stratus below it, the rain forms.\r\n\r\nThe following is Dr. Howard's description of cirrus: \"Parallel, flexuous\r\nor diverging fibers, extensible by increase in any or in all directions.\r\nClouds in this modification appear to have the least density, the greatest\r\nelevation, and the greatest variety of extent and direction. They are the\r\nearliest appearance after serene weather. They are first indicated by a\r\nfew threads penciled, as it were, on the sky. These increase in length,\r\nand new ones are in the mean time added to them. Often the first-formed\r\nthreads serve as stems to support numerous branches, which in their turn,\r\ngive rise to others.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in the general cut are imperfect, and do not represent\r\nthe delicate fibers of the cloud, for it is a difficult cloud to\r\ndaguerreotype or engrave, but the representation is sufficiently accurate\r\nto give the reader a general idea of the different varieties, and enable\r\nhim to discover them readily by observation. They are the most elevated\r\nforms, always of a light color, and often illuminated about sunset by the\r\nrays of the sun shining upon their inferior surface; the sun, however,\r\noften illuminates, in like manner, the dense forms of cirro-stratus, and\r\nthe latter, from their greater density, are susceptible of a brighter and\r\nmore vivid illumination.\r\n\r\nThe stratus is a smooth, uniform cloud--the true rain cloud of the storm;\r\noften forming without much cirrus above, or connected with it. It may be\r\nseen in its partially formed state in the bank in the west, at nightfall,\r\nor in the circle around the moon in the night. When it becomes\r\nsufficiently condensed, rain always falls from it, but in moderation. If\r\nthere be large masses of scud running beneath it for its drops to fall\r\nthrough (especially as is sometimes the case, in two or more currents),\r\nthe rain may be very heavy. But more of this hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed cut shows the forming stratus, light and thin, passing to the\r\neast, as indicated by the short arrows just before a storm, while the scud\r\nbeneath is running to the west.\r\n\r\nIt was copied from a daguerreotype view, facing northwardly.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the fibrous, tufted, cirrus, and the smooth uniform\r\nstratus, there is a variety of forms partaking more or less of the\r\ncharacter of one or the other, and termed _cirro-stratus_. No single\r\ncorrect representation of cirro-stratus as a distinct cloud, can be\r\ngiven--but several varieties will be hereafter alluded to, under the head\r\nof prognostics. Several modifications are represented with tolerable\r\naccuracy upon the cuts.\r\n\r\nThe cirro-cumulus is a collection in patches of very small distinct heaps\r\nof white clouds; they are called fleecy clouds, from their resemblance to\r\na collection of fleeces of wool, and are imperfectly represented on the\r\ngeneral cut. They do not appear often, and are usually _fair-weather\r\nclouds_.\r\n\r\nThis form has none of the characteristics of the cumulus, and does not\r\nappear in the same stratum. It was probably called cumulus because its\r\nsmall masses are distinct, as are those of the ordinary cumulus. It occurs\r\nin the same stratum as cirro-stratus, and properly belongs to that\r\nmodification. I retain the name inasmuch as the cloud is of some practical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe cumulo-stratus is seldom seen in our climate, as it is represented in\r\nthe cut. Stratus condensation _above_, and in connection with cumulus\r\ncondensation, is not uncommon, but that precise form is rare.\r\n\r\nThis, too, is practically of no consequence, and I shall take no further\r\nnotice of it.\r\n\r\nRecapitulating, I give (in a tabular form) the three principal strata and\r\ntheir modifications, located with sufficient accuracy for illustration.\r\nThe clouds which are found in an upper or lower portion of a stratum are\r\nso represented by the location of their names; those which appear at all\r\nheights in the stratum, with the names across. The elevation is the\r\naverage one--although there is no limit to the cirrus above, except the\r\nabsence of sufficient moisture. It was seen by Guy Lussac, and has been by\r\nother aeronauts, at an elevation of five miles, or more, when too delicate\r\nto be visible below.\r\n\r\n           +------------------------------------------------+\r\n           |                                                | 3 miles.\r\n           |Cirrus.                                         |\r\n           |                                Cirro-cumulus.  |\r\n           |                                Cirro-stratus.  |\r\n           |                                                |\r\n  Primary  |            { Cumulus extending up              |\r\n  stratum. |            { in violent showers.               |\r\n           |                                                |\r\n           |                                                |\r\n           |Stratus.                                        |\r\n           |------------------------------------------------|\r\n           |                                                | 1-1/2 miles.\r\n  Scud &   |N.

S. W., and in\r\nshowers between S. W. and N. W., to the opposite easterly points of the\r\ncompass; the most general direction, east of the Alleghanies, being from\r\nW. S. W. to E. N. E._\r\n\r\nBut do we not see, you inquire--at least those of us who live east of the\r\nAlleghanies--that when it rains, the wind is from the eastward; and that\r\nthe _clouds_ follow the wind from the east to the west? You do indeed,\r\ngenerally, in all considerable storms, observe that the wind blows from\r\nsome easterly point, and that _seeming_ clouds are blown by it to the\r\nwestward; but what you see, and call clouds, are not the clouds which\r\nfurnish the rain. Far above the seeming clouds you notice, directly over\r\nyour head when it rains or snows, are the rain or snow clouds, dense and\r\ndark, passing to the eastward, how strong soever the wind may blow from\r\nthe quarter to which they tend, or any other quarter, between you and\r\nthem. What you see below them are _scud_. So the sailors call them, and so\r\nI have termed them. It is a \"dictionary name,\" and a good one, expressive\r\nof a distinction between them and _clouds_. They are thin, and the sun\r\nshines through them, although with some difficulty, when the rain clouds\r\nabove are absent or broken. _This east wind and the scud are not the\r\nstorm, or essential parts of it._ Storms occasionally exist, particularly\r\nin April, without either. They are but _incidents_, _useful_, but not\r\n_necessary incidents_, as all surface winds are.\r\n\r\nIf you could see a section of the storm, you would see the rain cloud\r\nabove, moving to the east, and the scud beneath running to the west, as\r\nindicated by the arrows in the cut on page 40. Opportunities frequently\r\noccur when these appearances may be seen. Storms are sometimes very long,\r\na thousand miles, perhaps, from W. S. W. to E. N. E., and not more than\r\none to three hundred miles wide from S. E. to N. W., and their sides,\r\nparticularly the northern ones, regular, and without extensive partial\r\ncondensation. Then the storm cloud above, moving to the eastward, and the\r\nscud running under to the westward, may be seen as in the cut.\r\n\r\nSo they may be seen before, at the commencement, and at the conclusion of\r\neasterly storms, in a majority of cases, and the reader is desired to\r\nnotice them particularly as opportunities occur.\r\n\r\nThe term _running_, too, is a very expressive one, used by sailors as\r\napplicable to _scud_. For while the forming or formed storm clouds may be\r\nmoving moderately along, at the rate of twelve to fifteen or twenty miles\r\nan hour, from about W. S. W. to E. N. E., the scud may be running under\r\nthem in a different direction--opposite, or diagonal, or both--at the rate\r\nof twenty, fifty, sixty, and, in hurricanes, even ninety miles an hour.\r\nYou have doubtless seen these scud running from N. E. to S. W., and\r\nwithout dropping any moisture, a day or sometimes two days, before the\r\nstorm coming from the S. W. reached the place where you were; and then,\r\nsometimes the storm cloud slipped by to the southward, and the expected\r\nstorm at that point proved \"a dry northeaster.\" Sometimes the\r\ncondensation, although sufficiently dense to influence and attract the\r\nsurface atmosphere, and create an easterly wind and scud, does not become\r\nsufficiently dense to drop rain, and then, too, we have a dry northeaster,\r\nwhich may melt away or increase to a storm after it has passed over us. _I\r\nhave never seen, except, perhaps, in a single instance, one of these\r\nmasses of scud, however dense, which had not a rain (stratus) cloud above\r\nit, drop moisture enough to make the eaves run._ So you see it may be\r\ntrue, and if you will examine carefully, you may satisfy yourself that it\r\nis true, that the storms all move from a westerly point to the eastward,\r\nnotwithstanding the wind under them is blowing, and the scud under them\r\nare running to the westward.\r\n\r\nThere are many other methods by which the reader may determine this matter\r\nhimself. He may catch an opportunity for a view, when there is a break in\r\nthe stratus cloud above, and the sun or moon, no longer obscured by the\r\n_storm cloud_, shines through the scud beneath. Then he may see they are\r\nmoving in different directions. _The upper cloud, if there be any of it\r\nleft, always to the eastward._\r\n\r\nAgain, we may see the storm approach from the westward, as it often does,\r\nbefore the wind commences to blow, and the scud to run from the eastward;\r\nparticularly snow storms in winter, and the gentle showers and storms of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAgain, thunder storms, we know, come from the westward, and apparently\r\nagainst an east wind. It is sometimes said they approach from the east,\r\nbut it is a mistake. During thirty years attentive observation in\r\ndifferent localities, I have never seen an instance. They sometimes _form_\r\nover us, or just east of us, or one may form at the east and another at\r\nthe west, and as they _spread out in forming_, one may seem to be coming\r\nfrom the east, or there may be an easterly current, with dense flocculent\r\nscud at the under surface of the shower cloud running westward, but they\r\nfinally pass off to the eastward, and never to the westward. It is\r\npossible that a _patch of scud_ may become sufficiently _dense_ and\r\n_electrified_ to make a _shower_, but I have never observed one. Such an\r\n_apparent_ instance may be found recorded in \"Sillman's Journal,\" vol.\r\nxxxix. page 57. I have seen the scud assume a distinct cumulus form, but\r\nnever to become sufficiently dense to make a thunder shower.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning sometimes attend portions of regular storms in\r\nspring and autumn, but the thunder is always heard first in the west, and\r\nlast in the east.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are admitted facts with which you are conversant, which prove\r\nthis proposition. When it has been raining all day, and just at night the\r\nstorm has nearly all passed over to the eastward, and the sun shines under\r\nthe western edge of it, and \"_sets clear_,\" as it is termed--you say that\r\n\"_it will be clear the next day_.\" Why? Because the storm will not pass to\r\nthe westward, covering the sun and continuing, how strong soever the wind\r\nmay be from the east; and because it is passing, and will continue to pass\r\noff to the eastward, leaving the sky clear. _The easterly wind will stop\r\nas soon as the storm clouds have passed, and it will fall calm, or the\r\nwind will \"come out\" from the westward._\r\n\r\nSo, too, when the clouds are dark in the west in the morning, and the sun\r\nrises clear, but \"_goes into a cloud_,\" as it is expressed, you say that\r\nit will rain. And if the clouds are dense this generally proves true;\r\nbecause there is a storm or shower approaching from the west, and passing\r\nover to the east, the western edge of whose advance condensation has met\r\nthe sun in his coming, and obscured him from your vision.\r\n\r\nWhen, too, it has been storming, and lights up in the N. W. you say it\r\nwill clear off; the N. W. wind will blow all the clouds away. It is,\r\nindeed, generally true that when it so lights up it is about to clear off;\r\nalthough it sometimes shuts down again, in consequence of the approach of\r\nanother storm from the westward, following closely behind the one which is\r\npassing off. It is a great mistake, however, to suppose the N. W. wind\r\nblows away the clouds. Watch the smooth stratus rain cloud at its lower\r\nedge, where the clear sky is seen, and you will see that it is moving on\r\nsteadily to the N. E., in obedience to the laws of its current, and will\r\ndo so, even when its retreating edge has passed up to the zenith, and down\r\nto the S. E.\r\n\r\nThe storm uncovers us from the N. W. by the contraction of its width, _or_\r\nbecause it has a _southern lateral extension_ and _dissolution_, and not\r\nby being blown away by the N. W. wind; although that wind, by its peculiar\r\nfair-weather clouds, may be, perhaps, observed beneath, ready to follow\r\nits retreating edge.\r\n\r\nAgain, when it has been clear all day, and the sun sets in a bank of\r\ncloud, you say--\"_it will rain to-morrow, the sun did not set clear_,\" and\r\nunless that bank is a thunder cloud, merely, which will pass over or by\r\nyou, with or without rain, before morning, it is generally true that it\r\nwill. The bank will prove the eastern edge of an approaching storm.\r\n\r\nFrom these generally admitted and understood facts, you may know that\r\nstorms pass from the west to the east.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is also proved by all the investigations of storms, which\r\nhave taken place since the settlement of this country. Storms of great\r\nseverity attract particular attention, and are said to \"back up\" against\r\nthe wind, because they are observed to commence storming first at the\r\nwestward, although the wind is from the eastward. Doubtless you recollect\r\nmany such instances recorded in the newspapers. No season occurs without\r\nsuch notices.\r\n\r\nMany storms have been investigated by Mr. Redfield, for the purpose of\r\nsustaining his theory. Many others by Professor Espy, to sustain his. One\r\nby Professor Loomis, with great research and ability--and some by others,\r\naccounts of all which have been published; and every one yet investigated,\r\nnorth of the parallel of 30 deg., has been shown to pass from a westerly to an\r\neasterly point.\r\n\r\nSo, too, we may know it from analogy. The laws of nature are uniform.\r\nThere is a great end to be accomplished, _viz._: the distribution of forty\r\ninches of water, at regular intervals, over a large extent of country. The\r\nrivers are to return, and the clouds are to drop fatness, and seed time\r\nand harvest are not to cease. It is to be done and is done, by means of\r\nstorms and showers, and pursuant to general laws, as immutable as the\r\nresult. Most of these storms and showers, it has been found, and may be\r\nobserved, move from the westward to the eastward. Then we may know, from\r\nanalogy, that they do so in obedience to a general, uniform law; and so I\r\nmight say with confidence, if our inquiry stopped here, it will ever be\r\nfound by those who may hereafter examine them.\r\n\r\nBut, 2d. There is a current in the atmosphere, all over the continent\r\nnorth of the N. E. trades, but in great volume over the United States,\r\neast of the meridian of 105 deg. W. from Greenwich--varying in different\r\nseasons, and upon different parallels, and flowing near the earth, when no\r\nsurface wind interposes between them. In the vicinity of New York, the\r\nusual course of this current is from about W. S. W. to E. N. E. In the\r\nwestern and south-western portion of the United States, it is, doubtless,\r\nmore southerly--varying somewhat according to the season--and in other\r\nsections varies in obedience to the general law of its origin, and\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nI have observed its course in many places, between the parallels of 38 deg.\r\nand 44 deg. N. _This current comes from the South Atlantic Ocean._ It is our\r\nportion of the aerial current, which flows every where from the tropics\r\ntoward the poles, to which I have already alluded in connection with the\r\ndistribution of heat. _It brings to us the twenty inches of rain which we\r\nlose by the rivers, and by the westerly winds, which carry off a portion\r\nof the local moisture of evaporation, and its action precipitates the\r\nremaining portion of that moisture. It spreads out over the face of our\r\ncountry, with considerable, but not entire uniformity. All our great\r\nstorms originate in it, and all our showers originate in or are induced\r\nand controlled by it._\r\n\r\n_From the varied action, inherent or induced, of this current, most of our\r\nmeteorological phenomena, whether of wet or dry, or cold or warm weather,\r\nresult_; and a thorough knowledge of its origin, cause, and the reciprocal\r\naction between it and the earth, is essential to a knowledge of the\r\n\"_Philosophy of the Weather_.\"\r\n\r\nLet us then go down to the \"chambers of the south,\" to the inter-tropical\r\nregions, of which we have said something in connection with a notice of\r\nSouthern Mexico, and see where, and how this great aerial current\r\noriginates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the parallels of 35 deg. north latitude, and 35 deg. south\r\nlatitude--changing its location within this limit at different seasons of\r\nthe year--encircling the earth, and covering about one-half of its\r\narea--we find the trade-wind region. In this region are the simple and\r\nuniform arrangements, which extend every where, and produce all the\r\natmospheric phenomena. In the center of it we find that movable belt of\r\ncontinual or daily rains, and comparative calms, particularly _near its\r\ncenter_, about four hundred and fifty miles in width upon the Atlantic,\r\nand over Africa, and the eastern portions of the Pacific, and something\r\nmore over South America and the West Indies, the western portion of the\r\nPacific and the Indian Ocean, to which we have already alluded. This belt\r\nof rains and calms follows the trades and sun, in their transit north and\r\nsouth, from one tropic to the other--its width and extension depending\r\nupon the volume of trade-winds existing on the sides of it. Its southern\r\nedge, when the sun is at the southern solstice, extends to 7 deg. south in the\r\nAtlantic, to 10 deg. south in the Indian Ocean, and still further, probably,\r\nover South America: on this point I do not pretend to be accurate, for\r\naccuracy is not essential. When the sun is at the northern solstice the\r\nsouthern edge is carried up as far as 12 deg. north, over the Atlantic, and\r\nstill further over the northern portions of South America, the West\r\nIndies, and Mexico. It travels, therefore, from south to north, over from\r\ntwenty to forty degrees of latitude. The presence of this belt of rains\r\nover any given portion of the inter-tropics, gives that portion its rainy\r\nseason, and its absence, as it moves to the north, or the south, gives the\r\nportion from which it has moved, its dry season. It passes in its transit\r\ntwice each year over some portions of the country, Bogota, for instance,\r\nand two corresponding rainy and dry seasons result. Its presence, and\r\ncharacter, and movements, are as fixed and regular, over from twenty-five\r\nto forty degrees of the earth's surface, _and all around it_, as the\r\npresence and movements of the sun over the same area.\r\n\r\nAt the northern edge of this movable belt of rain, and extending in some\r\nplaces, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, north about 20 deg., or about one\r\nthousand four hundred miles, and in other places a less distance, the N.\r\nE. trade winds prevail, blowing toward and into it from N. N. E., N. E.,\r\nand E. N. E., averaging about N. E. At the south line of this belt of\r\nrains, extending south from twenty-five to thirty degrees, or from sixteen\r\nhundred to two thousand miles, the S. E. trades blow toward and into it,\r\nfrom the S. E., S. S. E., or E. S. E., averaging about S. E. Of course the\r\nnorthern limit of the N. E. trades travels north and south with the belt\r\nof rain, toward which it blows; and so the southern limit of the S. E.\r\ntrades travel in like manner with the rainy belt, or rather, to speak with\r\nentire accuracy, the belt of rain moves with the trades, and the trades\r\nfollow the verticality of the sun. The following diagrams exhibit\r\napproximately, and with sufficient accuracy for illustration, the\r\nsituations of the rainy belt and the trades, when at their northern and\r\nsouthern limit, as well as the manner in which it must give certain\r\nlocalities two rainy seasons each year, in its transit north and south.\r\n\r\nAt the northern and southern limits of the trade-winds, and extending from\r\nthem to the poles, are found the variable winds and irregular\r\nextra-tropical rains, all over the earth, which are shown by the shading\r\non the maps. This line of extra-tropical rains descends to the south,\r\nfollowing the retreating trades as they descend in our winter, and recedes\r\nnorth before the trades when they return in spring and summer, so that at\r\nthe outer limit of the trades respectively, toward the poles, the line of\r\nextra-tropical rains will be found, receding or following that limit, as\r\nthe trades pass up and down with the sun. From the north pole to the\r\nnorthern limit of the N. E. trade-winds, wherever found, whether at 38 deg.\r\nnorth latitude, as in some places in summer when the sun is at the tropic\r\nof Cancer; or whether at 20 deg. to 30 deg. north latitude, as in our winter, when\r\nthe sun is at the tropic of Capricorn; the extra-tropical rains prevail. A\r\nstate of things precisely similar exists between the south pole and the\r\nsouthern limit of the S. E. trades. Between this northern limit of the\r\nN. E. trades and the northern line of the inter-tropical belt of\r\nrains, wherever situated (with two exceptions, to which we have alluded\r\nand shall allude again), there is, for the time being, a dry season; and a\r\nlike dry season between the southern line of the belt of rains and the\r\nsouthern limit of the S. E. trades. We have, therefore, extending around\r\nthe earth, a belt of daily tropical rains, near the center,--two belts of\r\ndrought which are mainly trade-wind surfaces, one on each side of the\r\ncentral rainy belt,--extending to the outward limits of the trades and the\r\nline of extra-tropical rains; and these rainy and dry belts, moving up and\r\ndown after the sun, a distance of from twenty to forty degrees of\r\nlatitude, each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. IN SUMMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. IN WINTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the _main_ phenomena, _at the surface_, in the trade-wind region.\r\nAscending a step higher in the atmosphere, we find, above the\r\nsurface-trades, a counter-trade, running, not in the opposite direction,\r\nbut at right angles, or nearly so. The counter-trade which issues from the\r\nnorthern side of the rainy belt, running to the N. W. or W. N. W., and the\r\ncounter trade which issues from the southern side, running to the S. W. or\r\nW. S. W., varying, as the trades do in direction in different localities.\r\nThese counter-trades are continuations of the surface trades, which,\r\nascending in their course, have threaded their way through the opposite\r\ntrade in the rainy belt, and are continuing on at the same angle, and in\r\nthe same direction at which they blew upon the surface, and in obedience\r\nto the same law. This is apparent from several considerations.\r\n\r\n1st. They issue at the same angle, and over the top of the surface trades.\r\nIn the West Indies and elsewhere, this has been ascertained and proved by\r\nthe course of the storms, and the rotation of their surface winds, and\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n2d. We can not suppose the N. E. trade to be reflected, and turn back over\r\nitself at a right angle. That would be impossible, even if there were a\r\nwall of solid material there for it to blow against. Air is a peculiar\r\nfluid, and it stratifies with astonishing ease. He who supposes that a\r\ncurrent of air put in motion can be turned aside by another current, or by\r\nthe atmosphere at rest, or can be made to mingle, is mistaken. It will\r\nstratify, and force itself onward through the adjacent and opposing\r\natmosphere, and in a right line. I have observed some remarkable instances\r\nof this character.\r\n\r\n3d. The cause which operates to produce the surface trades, still operates\r\nupon the current to carry it over into the other hemisphere; a\r\ncounter-trade, as we shall see. It is impossible, therefore, to believe\r\nthat the surface-trades as they arrive at the belt of rains and calms,\r\nturn at a right angle, or at any angle, and return: and impossible to\r\ndoubt that they pass through each other in this belt, and out at the\r\nopposite side, as upper currents, at the same angle at which they entered.\r\nOf course the N. E. trade of the Atlantic becomes the N. E. counter-trade\r\nof South America, carrying their storms in a S. W. direction, and the S.\r\nE. trade of the Atlantic the S. E. counter-trade of the West Indies,\r\ncarrying all their storms in a N. W. direction; and what is true of them\r\nis true of the trade winds _every where, all over the globe, over the land\r\nand over the sea_.\r\n\r\nDoubtless here some one will say, our upper current is a S. W. current.\r\nTrue, the S. E. trade which enters the belt of rains, and issues out on\r\nthe north, a S. E. upper current or counter-trade, keeps that course until\r\nit arrives at the northern limit of the surface trade, when, in _obedience\r\nto another law_, which we shall notice, it gradually _decends near the\r\nsurface, curves to the eastward_, and becomes _the S. W. current which\r\npasses over us_. And so we have the S. E. trade-wind of the South\r\nAtlantic, with its moisture, warmth, electricity, and polarity, over, and\r\nperhaps sometimes around us, dropping the electric rain which makes glad\r\nour fields; giving us, when not prevented by other conditions, the balmy\r\nair of spring, the Indian summer of autumn, and the mild mitigating\r\nchanges of winter; and thus, _our rivers, which run into the sea, return\r\nto us again_.\r\n\r\nBut let us go back to the trade-wind region--the region of regularity and\r\nuniformity--and examine somewhat more attentively its features, that we\r\nmay more fully understand the character of this counter-trade.\r\n\r\nHere are 60 deg. at least of the 180 deg. of the earth's surface, and at its\r\nlargest diameter, covered in the course of the year, and of their travels,\r\nby the trade-winds at the surface, the counter-trades above, and the belt\r\nof rains and comparative calms, formed by the action of the opposite\r\ntrades, as they thread their way through each other, to assume the\r\nrelation of counter-trades. Truly the magnitude, simplicity, and\r\nregularity of this machinery are most wonderful.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some _apparent_ anomalies which deserve attention.\r\nHere are most distinctly marked the _rainy_ and _dry seasons_, existing\r\nside by side. Here are the _rainless portions_ of the earth, already but\r\nbriefly alluded to; here the _monsoons_, and another peculiarity, _viz._:\r\nthe _gathering of the counter-trades_ upon the western sides of the two\r\ngreat oceans, into two _aerial currents of greater volume_, _analogous_\r\nsomewhat to the two _gulf streams_ of those oceans. Let us examine these\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\nThe rainy and dry seasons depend, as we have seen, upon the transit north\r\nand south of the rainy belt, or belt of comparative calms. Wherever this\r\nbelt may happen on any given day to be situated, each side of it the\r\ntrades prevail, it is dry, the earth is parched, and vegetation withers.\r\nThese changes are graphically described by Humboldt in his \"Views of\r\nNature,\" as they occur on the northern portions of South America, as\r\nfollows: \"When, beneath the vertical rays of the bright and cloudless sun\r\nof the tropics, the parched sward crumbles into dust, then the indurated\r\nsoil cracks and bursts, as if rent asunder by some mighty earthquake. The\r\nhot and dusty earth forms a cloudy vail, which shrouds the heavens from\r\nview, and increases the stifling oppression of the atmosphere; while the\r\neast wind (_i. e._ trade-wind), when it blows over the long heated soil,\r\ninstead of cooling, adds to the burning glow.\r\n\r\n\"Gradually, too, the pools of water, which had been protected from\r\nevaporation by the now seared foliage of the fan-palm, disappear. As in\r\nthe icy north animals become torpid from cold, so here the crocodile and\r\nthe boa-constrictor lie wrapped in unbroken sleep, deeply buried in the\r\ndried soil. Every where the drought announces death, yet every where the\r\nthirsty wanderer is deluded by the phantom of a moving, undulating, watery\r\nsurface, created by the deceptive play of the reflected rays of light (the\r\nmirage). A narrow stratum separates the ground from the distant\r\npalm-trees, which seem to hover aloft, owing to the contact of currents of\r\nair having different degrees of heat, and therefore of density. Shrouded\r\nin dark clouds of dust, and tortured by hunger and burning thirst, oxen\r\nand horses scour the plain, the one belowing dismally, the other with\r\noutstretched necks snuffing the wind, in the endeavor to detect, by the\r\nmoisture in the air, the vicinity of some pool of water not yet wholly\r\nevaporated.\r\n\r\n\"Even if the burning heat of day be succeeded by the cool freshness of the\r\nnight, here always of equal length, the wearied ox and horse enjoy no\r\nrepose. Huge bats now attack the animals during sleep, and vampyre-like\r\nsuck their blood; or, fastening on their backs, raise festering wounds, in\r\nwhich mosquitos, hippobosces, and a host of other stinging insects, burrow\r\nand nestle. Such is the miserable existence of these poor animals, when\r\nthe heat of the sun has absorbed the waters from the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"When, after a long drought, the genial season of rain arrives, the scene\r\nsuddenly changes. The deep azure of the hitherto cloudless sky assumes a\r\nlighter hue. Scarcely can the dark space in the constellation of the\r\nSouthern Cross be distinguished at night. The mild phosphorescence of the\r\nMagellanic clouds fades away. Even the vertical stars of the\r\nconstellations Aquila and Ophiuchus, shine with a flickering and less\r\nplanetary light. Like some distant mountain, a single cloud is seen rising\r\nperpendicularly on the southern horizon. Misty vapors collect and\r\ngradually overspread the heavens, while distant thunder proclaims the\r\napproach of the vivifying rain. Scarcely is the surface of the earth\r\nmoistened, before the teeming steppe becomes covered with Killingiae, with\r\nthe many-panicled Paspalum, and a variety of grasses. Excited by the power\r\nof light, the herbaceous Mimosa unfolds its dormant, drooping leaves,\r\nhailing, as it were, the rising sun in chorus with the matin song of the\r\nbirds, and the opening flowers of aquatics. Horses and oxen, buoyant with\r\nlife and enjoyment, roam over and crop the plains. The luxuriant grass\r\nhides the beautiful and spotted jaguar, who, lurking in safe concealment,\r\nand carefully measuring the extent of the leap, darts, like the Asiatic\r\ntiger, with a cat-like bound on his passing prey.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Humboldt's description of the dry season on the Orinoco, and the\r\nreturn of the belt of rains from the south.\r\n\r\nAgain, within this trade-wind region are the _rainless countries_. These\r\nare portions of the earth which the equatorial rainy belt does not ascend\r\nfar enough north in summer to cover, nor does the southern edge of the\r\nextra-tropical regular rains descend, in winter, far enough south to cover\r\nthem, and where, of course, rain seldom, if ever, falls. Such are the\r\ncentral parts of the Desert of Sahara, Egypt, Arabia, portions of\r\nAffghanistan, Beloochistan, and the western parts of Hindoostan, to the\r\nnorth of the inter-tropical belt, and a similar state of things exists\r\nsouth of the equator in parts of South America, Africa, and New Holland,\r\nalthough upon a comparatively small surface.\r\n\r\nAgain, another anomaly is the gathering of the trade winds into greater\r\nvolumes, on the westerly side of the great oceans, and the consequent\r\ncarrying of the equatorial rainy belt up to the region of extra-tropical\r\nrains, on the eastern side of the great continents of Asia and North\r\nAmerica, and the peculiar liability of these aerial gulfs to hurricanes\r\nand typhoons. Such an aerial gulf gathers over the Caribbean Sea, and the\r\nWest Indies. Passing across the Gulf of Mexico, it enters over Texas, and\r\nLouisiana, and the other southern states; its western edge passing north\r\nin autumn and winter, on the eastern side of the highlands of Western\r\nTexas, New Mexico, and the Great Desert; curving, as all counter-trades\r\ndo, to the eastward as soon as it passes the limit of the N. E. trades,\r\nand spreading out over our favored country, leaving the evidence of its\r\npathway in the greater quantities of rain, which fall annually upon its\r\nsurface. This gathering deprives a portion of the Atlantic, north of the\r\ntropics, of its share of the counter trade, and there, as every where,\r\nwhere the volume of counter-trade is small, storms and gales are\r\ninfrequent, and of less force, and comparative calms prevail. That portion\r\nof the Atlantic has long been known as \"the horse latitudes,\" a name given\r\nto it by our Yankee sailors, because, there, in former times, the\r\nold-fashioned, low-decked, flat-bottomed, horse-carrying craft of New\r\nEngland, bound for the West Indies, often floundered about in the calms\r\nand baffling winds, until their animals perished for want of water, and\r\nwere thrown overboard. Lieutenant Maury, in his most praiseworthy and\r\nexceedingly useful investigation of \"The Winds and Currents of the Ocean,\"\r\nhas defined the situation of these calms and baffling winds at different\r\nseasons--for they move up and down, of course, with the motion of the\r\nwhole machinery--and enabled navigators to avoid them, by running _east_\r\nbefore they attempt to make _southing_; and very materially shortened the\r\nvoyages to the equator.\r\n\r\nA like gathering, in volume, of the S. E. trade, on the western side of\r\nthe Pacific, enters over Asia, and covers China and Malaysia, extending,\r\nin its western course, nearly as far as the western edge of Hindoostan. In\r\nthis concentrated volume of counter-trade, and owing to its concentrated\r\naction, form and float the typhoons of the China Sea, and of the Bay of\r\nBengal; and to this anomalous aerial gulf stream, the S. E. portions of\r\nAsia, from the western desert of Hindoostan, to the eastern portion of\r\nChina, north of the rainy belt, owe their great supply of moisture and\r\nfertility, and their peculiar climate. The western line of this volume of\r\ncounter-trade is marked by the eastern portion of the rainless region of\r\nBeloochistan, and the north-western deserts of India, as the western edge\r\nof our concentrated volume of counter-trade, is marked by the arid plains\r\nof northern Mexico, western Texas, and New Mexico. On the south of the\r\nequatorial rainy belt, there is no corresponding aerial gulf of equal\r\nvolume, as there is no corresponding gulf stream of equal magnitude. On\r\nthe western side of the Indian Ocean we find a gathering of the N. E.\r\ntrades from the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, in which form and\r\ntravel the hurricanes which prevail--traveling to the southward and\r\nwestward--about the Isle of France or Mauritius; and the lagullus oceanic\r\ncurrent, which runs down to the S. W. toward the Cape of Good Hope. But\r\nthe extension of South America to the eastward, under, or just south of\r\nthe N. E. trades, does not permit the formation of such a concentrated\r\nvolume on the western side of the Atlantic, nor is the strength or\r\nregularity of the N. E. trades, on that ocean, equal to those of the S. E.\r\n\r\nNor is the magnetic intensity on the eastern and middle portions of the\r\nPacific, sufficient to produce such a concentration, in large volume,\r\nthere. The trades over that ocean, therefore, curve without concentration,\r\nexcept a partial one, over the western groups of Polynesia, which the\r\nAsiatic line of magnetic intensity approaches and where hurricanes are\r\nsometimes found, until we arrive near the eastern line of magnetic\r\nintensity, on the eastern side of Asia. We shall, hereafter, have occasion\r\nto follow the anomalous concentrated volumes of the S. E. counter-trade,\r\nof the northern tropic, on the western side of the great oceans, in\r\nexplanation of some of the phenomena which we find north of the trade-wind\r\nregion. Suffice it here to add, that if it were not for the concentration\r\nof these counter-trades, on the western side of the great oceans, the\r\nrainless region between the parallels of 20 deg. and 30 deg. would encircle the\r\nearth; and China and the Eastern United States would have a distinctly\r\nmarked rainy and dry season, as have California, the Barbary States,\r\nSyria, Persia, and other countries which lie north of the rainless region,\r\nwithin the summer range of the N. E. trades, but also within the winter\r\ndescending range of the belt of extra-tropical rains.\r\n\r\nAnother anomaly which we find in the trade-wind region, is the monsoon.\r\nThere are several of them, but they are found, in the greatest strength\r\nand regularity, in the Indian Ocean. Another, defined by the\r\ninvestigations of Maury, is found on the west coast of Africa, extending\r\nout over the Atlantic. Another prevails on the western coast of South and\r\nCentral America. The etesian winds of the Mediterranean are but the N. E.\r\ntrades, whose northern limit is carried up in summer, by the transit of\r\nthe connected machinery, to the north, over that sea. The N. E. and S. E.\r\nmonsoons, so called, of the Indian Ocean, are but the regular trades,\r\nblowing when the belt of rains is absent, as they do all over the globe.\r\nThe N. W. monsoon, south of the equator, in the vicinity of New Holland;\r\nthe S. W. monsoon which blows from the Arabian Sea, in upon Hindoostan;\r\nthe S. W. monsoon of the Atlantic, south of the Cape De Verde Islands; and\r\nthe variable west monsoon winds of the west coast of Southern and Central\r\nAmerica, and Southern Mexico (known under several different names, but\r\nchiefly by that of Tapayaguas), are all that deserve attention as such.\r\n\r\nAt first sight they appear to be anomalies, but the facts declare their\r\ncharacter with perfect certainty. First, they are not continuous, like the\r\ntrades, but _prevailing_ winds, and are _storm winds_; _they always blow\r\ntoward a region_, _or portion of the ocean_, _covered at the time by\r\nclouds and falling weather_.\r\n\r\nSecond, they do not blow upon, or toward, heated surfaces of land or\r\nwater--_i. e._, toward the dry and parched surfaces, where the dry season\r\nprevails, or from adjoining cold waters on to warm surfaces, but toward\r\nthe land or water _situated under the rainy belt_. They are therefore\r\nincident storm winds, (as our easterly winds are incident storm winds) of\r\nthe rain clouds of the tropics. They blow in upon the land, under the belt\r\nof rains, while that belt with its daily cloud, and inducing electric\r\naction, is over it, and follow that belt in its transit north and south.\r\nThey blow from the warm south polar current of the Atlantic, which flows\r\nN. W. from the coast of Africa, toward the inshore north polar current,\r\nwhich is there flowing south, but under the belt of rains. In the Indian\r\nOcean they blow from the center of that ocean, and the Arabian Sea, toward\r\nthe belt which hangs over Hindoostan, from the S. W.; and when the rainy\r\nbelt travels south they still blow toward, and under it, from the Indian\r\nOcean, but of course from the N. W. The heated character of the waters of\r\nthe Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, which receive no polar currents, but\r\nheated waters from the Persian Gulf, and from rivers which flow into the\r\nBay of Bengal over the heated plains of a tropical country, explain this.\r\nSo, too, the monsoon of the Atlantic Ocean, does not blow north of the\r\nCape De Verde Islands,--where the heated surface of Sahara, burning with\r\nthe rays of a vertical sun, has a temperature sometimes ranging from one\r\nhundred and forty to one hundred and sixty degrees--but remains under the\r\nrainy belt, drawn from the heated waters which flow up from the South\r\nAtlantic, and travels north as the rainy belt travels north in summer, and\r\nsouth to the Gulf of Guinea, as that travels south in winter. The same is\r\ntrue of the Pacific monsoon, the Tapayaguas, the least marked of all,\r\nwhich blows in during the rainy season upon the west coast of Southern\r\nMexico, and of Southern and Central America. They are all incident rain or\r\nstorm winds, blowing in upon the land, or on to a colder surface of\r\ndifferent polarity, _during the rainy season_; and if it were possible to\r\ncatch one of our north-easters, in its passage over our country to the\r\neastward, and anchor it to the Alleghanies, \"paying out\" so to have it\r\nreach in part over the Atlantic, and keep it there in operation six\r\nmonths, we should have a continual easterly wind under it; a _monsoon_\r\nmore strongly marked than the monsoons of the Indian, or Atlantic Oceans.\r\n_The received theory in relation to them is a fallacy._\r\n\r\nRecapitulating, then, all the phenomena, we have,--_Surface-trades_,\r\nblowing toward the center, passing through each other, and continuing on\r\nas upper or counter-trades; a _belt of rains_, with calms near the center,\r\nformed by the trades where they meet and pass through each other, which\r\ntravels with them north and south following the sun; _two belts of\r\ndrought_, following the belt of rains and the trades, and followed by the\r\n_extra_-tropical line of rains, as it travels with the trades and the\r\nrainy belt, leaving a part of the earth which the equatorial rainy belt\r\ndoes not travel far enough north, nor the extra-tropical line of rains far\r\nenough south to cover, and which is consequently a _rainless region_; _the\r\nmonsoons_, which are but incidents of the rainy belt, and the _gathered\r\nvolumes_ of counter-trade, on the west of the two great oceans, which\r\nusurp the place of the N. E. trades, carrying the rainy belt up to the\r\nregion of extra-tropical rain, and preventing the rainless region from\r\nencircling the earth.\r\n\r\nUpon _what cause_ do these great central phenomena, so vast, so regular,\r\nso wonderful, depend? What is the _motive power_ of this connected\r\natmospheric machinery, whose action and influence extend over the entire\r\nglobe?\r\n\r\n\"_Heat, heat_,\" say the text books, the Professors, the votaries of\r\nmeteorology. \"All these phenomena are owing to the heat of the sun. It\r\nheats the ocean and the earth--the air is thereby heated and rises, the\r\ncold air rushes in from below, then the ascended current rolls off each\r\nway at the top toward the pole, acquiring a westerly motion from the\r\nrotation of the earth, slipping away from under it, and a different,\r\n_viz._: an easterly motion, after reaching the latitude of 30 deg., from the\r\n_same rotation_; and all the winds and disturbances of the atmosphere are\r\nproduced in the same way. They are produced by the action of heated\r\nsurfaces upon the adjacent atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the great theory of meteorologists, by which they attempt to\r\naccount for the various atmospherical disturbances, of both tropical and\r\nextra-tropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe whole theory is a fallacy--it will not stand the test of a careful\r\nexamination. The bases of the theory, which are assumed to be facts, are\r\nnot so. The agent has not the power claimed for it. A heated surface,\r\nalone, never caused any considerable ascending current, or if it did,\r\nnever produced a mile of wind. I repeat it, the theory and all incidental\r\nones--the thousand explanatory and modifying theories, and\r\nhypotheses--_the whole system_--is without foundation in fact, and will\r\nnot bear a critical examination.\r\n\r\nLet us see if this language is stronger than the facts will warrant.\r\n\r\nThe theory assumes that both the land and water, under this central belt,\r\nwhere the air is supposed to be rising are _materially hotter_ than the\r\nland and ocean are on _either side of it_. Now, how much hotter are the\r\nair and the land under the belt of rains and calms, upon Hindoostan, or\r\nAfrica, or South America, where the former is supposed to be acquiring\r\nheat and expansion so rapidly, and to be ascending, than under, and in the\r\ndry belts on either side? None; it is cooler by the thermometer--_much\r\ncooler_.\r\n\r\nThe central belt of rains in midsummer over Africa, extends up as far as\r\n17 deg. north latitude, and perhaps further. North of this line over the whole\r\nsurface of the desert, the Barbary States, a part of the Mediterranean,\r\nand some portion of Italy, the dry season extends, and from the entire\r\nsurface the N. E. trade blow into the central belt.[1] Over the desert\r\nthey all pass. Now this desert is a sea of sand, under a vertical sun,\r\nintensely heated, blistering the skin with which it comes in contact, and\r\noften acquiring a temperature of 150 deg. to 160 deg. of Fahrenheit. Under the\r\ncentral belt of rains neither the earth nor air exceed the temperature of\r\n84 deg.. And yet the hot air of the desert does not ascend, but blows into\r\nthis cooler central belt; and when it is felt as it blows off the western\r\ncoast by the mariner, or even in Guinea, when the belt of rains has gone\r\nsouth in winter, as it often is as the _harmattan_, it is suffocating and\r\nintolerable. There, then, not only is it untrue, that the land and the air\r\nover it under the rainy belt are hotter, but it is true that intensely\r\nheated air blows horizontally from the Desert of Sahara. Nay, as it will\r\nappear in the sequel, this hottest of all surfaces not only can not have a\r\nvortex, but it can not induce a monsoon, and scarcely a sea breeze. The\r\nsame is true in a great degree of the surface, and the air over it, on\r\neither side of the supposed vortex of the rainy belt upon South America.\r\nSee the description of Humboldt, already given, where the thermometer\r\nstood as high as 115 deg. of Fahrenheit in the shade, while the N. E. winds,\r\nthe regular trades, were blowing over the land. And it is equally true of\r\nArabia, and indeed of every portion of the earth. There is not a spot upon\r\nthe globe where the land and the air are cooler _by the side_ of the\r\ncentral belt of rains, than _under it_. _And the opposite is true every\r\nwhere upon the land._\r\n\r\nHow much hotter is the ocean and air under this supposed vortex? But\r\nlittle hotter than they are on the side where the sun is not vertical,\r\n_and none on the other_. Let us be a little more particular. The\r\ntemperature of the Atlantic under the belt of rains in our winter, and on\r\nthe south of the belt at the latitude of 3 deg. south, and down to 9 deg. or more\r\nsouth, is 82 deg.. The air may range a degree, or possibly two, higher than\r\nthe water at either point. On the north this difference is from nothing at\r\nthe meeting of the trades and belt of rains, to about 4 deg. at their northern\r\nlimit. This is too _trifling_ to be worth one moment's consideration. It\r\nis less, far less than the difference between the water and air of the\r\nGulf Stream which runs along our coast, and the adjoining waters and air\r\nover them. While on the south side of the belt of rains the _difference is\r\nactually against the theory_--and the same state of things is reversed in\r\nsummer, when the sun is vertical at the north.\r\n\r\nFrom the log of an intelligent shipmaster, found in the wind and current\r\ncharts of Lieutenant Maury, I abridge the following, which will illustrate\r\nthis. Captain Young in February, found the N. E. trades at about 17 deg. north\r\nlatitude, with the water at 75 deg. and air at 76 deg., trade-wind N.

E.\r\ntrades than in the _center_ of the belt of rains, as it is, usually, in\r\nmid-winter, but not in summer. On the other hand, _after he left the\r\nregion of calms and rains_, where the water and air stood with almost\r\nentire uniformity at 82 deg., on the 3d of March, and for three days\r\nthereafter, during which he was in the S. E. trades with fair weather,\r\nthe water was the same as under the supposed vortex, _viz._, 82 deg., _and the\r\nair rose to 83 deg. and 84 deg._! _This is demonstration._\r\n\r\nI also take from a letter of Lieutenant Walsh to Lieutenant Maury,\r\nrelative to the cruise of the \"Taney\" the following, showing the warmth of\r\nthe Gulf Stream compared with the adjacent ocean.\r\n\r\n     \"We first crossed the Gulf Stream on the 31st of October; we struck\r\n     it in latitude 37 deg. 22', longitude 71 deg. 26' as indicated by the\r\n     temperature of the water, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n          8 A.M. water at surface 66 deg.\r\n          9  \"     \"         \"    73 deg.\r\n         10  \"     \"         \"    76 deg.\r\n         11  \"     \"         \"    77 deg.\r\n\r\n     77 deg. was the highest temperature found in crossing at this time.\r\n\r\n     Re-crossing it in May, in latitude 35 deg. 30', longitude 72 deg. 35', he\r\n     found the water as follows:\r\n\r\n          8 A.M. water at surface 71 deg. 8'\r\n          9  \"     \"         \"    73 deg.\r\n         10  \"     \"         \"    75 deg. 5'\r\n         11  \"     \"         \"    78 deg. 5'\r\n         12  M.    \"         \"    78 deg. 5'\r\n\r\n     79 deg. being the highest temperature found.\"\r\n\r\nThe average difference between the temperature of the water of the Gulf\r\nStream and the adjoining ocean, at the line of division, is about ten\r\ndegrees, increasing to more than twenty on approaching the coast, and\r\nwithin one hundred miles--a far greater difference than is ever found on\r\nthe winter side of the inter-tropical rainy belt.\r\n\r\nIt is not only not so, then, that the surface of the ocean is materially\r\nwarmer under the belt of rains than the adjoining surface under the\r\ntrades, especially on the summer side, but if it were so, the trades would\r\nnot be created thereby, any more than upon the Gulf Stream. And the\r\nopposite is true of the land where the line of calms, and rains, and\r\ndrought meet, all around the globe. The fact assumed is therefore untrue.\r\nThe hottest surfaces, even at the rainless portion, where there is no\r\nvortex, no storm, and no wind but the continual uniform N. E. horizontal\r\ntrade-wind, _never_ created, by reason of the heat alone, a mile of wind,\r\na storm or shower.\r\n\r\nBut, again, the belt of calms, where the air is supposed to rise and\r\ncreate a suction which draws the trades on either side a distance of from\r\none thousand to two thousand miles, an average of three thousand miles in\r\nall, at least, is not itself, on an average, over five hundred miles in\r\nbreadth from north to south. What a wonder of meteorology is here!\r\n\r\nWith a breadth of five hundred miles, the rising of the atmosphere is\r\nsupposed to be so rapid and of such immense volume that it draws the\r\nsurface atmosphere, one thousand to fifteen hundred miles on one side and\r\ntwo thousand on the other, with a uniform steady velocity of twenty miles\r\nper hour. Is this vast suction found by the unlucky mariner who may be\r\ndrawn within the vortex? _Not at all._ He finds no rapid suction there,\r\nbut _horizontal currents_, not steady, indeed, like the trades, and\r\nsometimes calms _at the center_, but still the _currents are there_, and,\r\n_except near the center, there as squalls, showers, and baffling winds\r\nand as monsoons_.\r\n\r\nAgain, is there at the mouth of this vortex, or as you approach it, an\r\nincreased rapidity in the trade corresponding to the magnitude of its\r\ninfluence? Does the trade become a hurricane as it approaches the spot\r\nwhere it is to supply the place of that which has suddenly \"expanded by\r\nheat, and been forced to rise, boil over, and run off at the top in turn?\"\r\nNot at all. It blows gently, even up to the very line of the rainy belt,\r\nand becomes squally and baffling, falls gradually calm near the center, or\r\nchanges to a monsoon.\r\n\r\nBut, again, the belt of rains is so far from being a belt of calms\r\nstrictly, that its monsoons in the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans,\r\nat times, extend hundreds of miles out over the ocean. That of the\r\nAtlantic, triangular, with its base resting on Africa, according to\r\nLieutenant Maury, extends sometimes almost to the coast of South America,\r\na distance of one thousand miles, and thus under the supposed ascending\r\nvortex. Where is the great uprising suction during the prevalence of this\r\nextensive surface horizontal monsoon beneath it? Manifestly it does not\r\nexist. Nay, that monsoon is blowing from the warm current which sets up\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope toward the Caribbean Sea, and over the cold\r\nnorth polar current, which runs down between the continent and the Cape de\r\nVerdes. Equally untrue is the presumption that the air rises over heated\r\nportions of the earth elsewhere, and by reason of such heating.\r\n_Perpendicular currents of the atmosphere are rarely seen, never\r\nextensive, or attaining any considerable altitude._ I have watched for\r\nthem thirty years. I have seen currents of air ascend, with their moisture\r\ncondensing as they ascended, and unite with the under surface of a highly\r\nelectrified cloud--the advance condensation of a thunder shower--but that\r\ncloud was moving horizontally at a distance of from one to two thousand\r\nfeet above the surface of the earth, and did not rise. I have seen patches\r\nof scud rising from the surface during the intervals of a showery and\r\nhighly electrified storm, toward, and uniting with, the clouds above, when\r\nvery low, as I have seen them approach and unite horizontally; and\r\ndoubtless there is a tendency upwards of the wind, created and attracted\r\nby the summer shower, as may be seen in the ascending dust before the\r\nrain, but I have never been able to detect an ascending current, except as\r\ninduced and attracted by a cloud above moving horizontally, in the hottest\r\nday or dryest time. None of the clouds of our climate, even when the earth\r\nis heated and parched by a two months' unbroken drought, can be detected\r\nrising above the strata in which they form. I have watched the cumuli at\r\nsuch periods when they filled the air, and can assert that they never\r\nrise. The atmosphere moves, invariably, in horizontal strata, and the\r\nwhole theory of ascending currents is fallacious.\r\n\r\nBut let us look still further at the tropical currents. The true harmattan\r\nof north-western Africa (for the term is sometimes misapplied), hot and\r\nblistering, generated upon the sand of the desert--why does it blow from\r\nSahara horizontally, on or over cooler surfaces, following the belt of\r\nrains as a N. E. trade? Why does it not ascend? The sirocco of north\r\nSahara, the kamsin or chamsin of eastern Sahara, and the simoon of Arabia,\r\nwhich blow hot and suffocating from those deserts--why do they blow _from_\r\nheated surfaces and _horizontally over_ cooler ones? Why do they not\r\nascend? Arabia is surrounded on three sides by seas and gulfs, from which\r\nevaporation is rapid. Her interior deserts are extensive and intensely\r\nhot--why are they rainless? Why do they not have a _vortex_, a _monsoon_,\r\nor even a _shower_? Because there is no such law or action as this theory\r\nsupposes. Those winds blow horizontally in obedience to other laws, and\r\nunder the control of other and more powerful agents. But further still,\r\nwhat heating and ascending process is it that makes the variable winds\r\nnorth of the tropics? that brings in the warm air and fog of the Gulf\r\nStream upon our _snow-clad coast_, in mid-winter, to increase the January\r\nthaw? Nay, what heating process is it that disturbs the calms of the polar\r\nregions with fresh breezes and gales, sometimes of the force of 6, when\r\nthe _sun does not shine_, the thermometer is from 20 deg. to 40 deg. below zero,\r\nthe _earth and sea one frozen surface_, and the hardy explorer dressed in\r\nfurs, barely lives in his cabin covered by an embankment of snow, and\r\nheated by a stove?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, meteorologists, it will not do. The theory is unsound; the\r\nassumed facts do not exist. The whole universe has not an agent, organic\r\nor inorganic, which can play such absurd and inconsistent pranks in the\r\nface of its Creator, as your various and complicated theories assign to\r\ncaloric.\r\n\r\nAway with the theory and all its incidental and complicated and mystified\r\nhypotheses, they rest like a pall upon the science;--away with the whole\r\nsystem, and let us seek some agent whose _power_ and _adaptation_\r\ncorrespond with the _extent_, and _simplicity_, and _magnificence_ of the\r\nphenomena, and, in some degree, with the _power_ and _wisdom of their\r\nAuthor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne, and the principal end attained by the power of the agent, is the\r\ngathering of a volume of atmosphere from, or near, the _surface_ of the\r\nland and sea, so as to ensure its possession of all the moisture of\r\nevaporation which rises from the locality, and the highest degree of\r\ntemperature, and from a space ranging from one to two thousand miles in\r\nwidth, in one hemisphere, and to carry it over into the other. Not over\r\nthe top, or upon the top, of the whole mass of atmosphere situated in the\r\nopposite hemisphere--_out of reach of all influences from the earth_--but\r\nthrough it, and curving gradually down near to, and within influential\r\ndistance of the surface of the earth, soon after it passes the outward\r\nlimit of its fellow trade; and to continue the current onward, leaving\r\nportions of it and its heat and moisture on the way, but taking a\r\nconsiderable volume up and around the magnetic poles--it being impossible\r\nfor the entire volume to be thus carried around the poles in consequence\r\nof the diminished circumference of the earth. To this end it is obvious it\r\nmust possess _polarity_.\r\n\r\nAnother end to be attained is to combine the moisture of evaporation with\r\nthe air, so that the cold atmosphere through which, or the earth over\r\nwhich it passes, may not be _continually condensing its moisture_, and\r\nthereby _enveloping the earth in a perpetual mist_; but so that it may\r\npart with it at _intervals_, making _cloudy_ and _clear days_; and part\r\nwith it in _portions_, so that a _regular_ and _necessary supply_ may be\r\nfurnished to the _entire hemisphere_, even up to the geographical poles.\r\nIs there such an agent? There is, precisely and perfectly adapted to the\r\nends to be attained, ever there and ever active, and that agent is\r\n_magnetism_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth is a magnet. It has its magnetic poles, and they are distinct\r\nfrom its geographical ones; and there are two in each hemisphere. They are\r\nsituated from 17 deg. to 19 deg. distant from the geographical poles; and ours is\r\nnot far from longitude 97 deg. W. from Greenwich, and 71 deg. north latitude.\r\nNavigators have gone north and north-west of it, and found its situation\r\nby the declination of the needle. From these poles, lines of magnetic\r\nintensity extend to the opposite and corresponding pole of the other\r\nhemisphere, and upon or near those lines the needle points north without\r\nvariation; and toward these lines of no variation the needle every where,\r\non either side declines. The foregoing diagram shows the situation of our\r\nmagnetic pole and line of no variation, the dip of the needle by the\r\narrows, and the magnetic equator.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries have shown that the magnetic force is exerted in lines\r\nand currents; that such currents, as physical lines of force, surround\r\nmagnets, and currents of electricity. Doubtless such lines of force exist\r\naround the earth and the magnetic poles. There are also _longitudinal_\r\nlines of force existing and active, between the poles, and extending from\r\none side of the center to the other, occupying nearly one third of the\r\nmagnet. If you take a large needle thoroughly magnetized, place it upon\r\npaper and drop filings of iron upon it, they will become arranged about it\r\nin circular and perpendicular, and also in _longitudinal lines_,\r\nconforming to the currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experiment is illustrated in all our books on natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing diagram, copied from Olmstead's Philosophy, does not show as\r\naccurately as Faraday's projection of the lines upon a globe-magnet the\r\ncomparative distance from the poles of the needle, at which the\r\nlongitudinal currents commence and terminate, and _where the filings will\r\nnot adhere_ to any considerable extent. The lines shown upon the needle\r\nshould bear the same proportion to its length as the trade-winds bear to\r\nthat of the earth, measured from pole to pole, and if the needle had a\r\nglobular form they would so appear.\r\n\r\nThese lines are made by currents arising from one side of the magnetic\r\nequator, and passing over to the other. Doubtless, just such currents\r\nrise, and pass over upon the earth.\r\n\r\nMagnetic and electric currents carry the air with them. This is well\r\nsettled by experiment. _Oxygen_, too, is _magnetic_, and capable both of\r\nreceiving and retaining polarity and of combining with, or attracting and\r\nretaining vapor, and of course the moisture of evaporation. Here then we\r\nhave a power existing, capable of producing the result--precisely, and\r\nwith evident wisdom adapted to its production--ever present and active;\r\nand no other known agent can.\r\n\r\nIs it not then the agent?\r\n\r\nLet us look a little further. This result is affected by the action of the\r\nsun: the trades with the central belts of rains travel north and south\r\nafter it; so does the sun affect the magnetic currents every where, even\r\nthe magnetic needle is daily affected by its action, as it increases the\r\nintensity of the terrestrial magnetic currents, and hence its well\r\nestablished diurnal oscillations.\r\n\r\nAgain, along the eastern lines of the continents which skirt the great\r\noceans on the west, run the northerly and southerly lines of no variation,\r\nand of greatest magnetic intensity. Here are the trade currents gathered\r\ninto a volume, which curve and carry unusual fertility to South-eastern\r\nAsia, and North America, and in those great aerial gulf streams we find\r\nthe _intense_ electric action which produces the typhoons of the former,\r\nand the hurricanes of the latter. It may still be said that these\r\nconditions and phenomena of the trade-wind region, are not produced by\r\nmagnetism or magneto-electricity, _but the objector can point to no other\r\nadequate power_. That it must be heat, electricity, or magnetism, must be\r\nadmitted. There is no other power known. Heat demonstrably can not produce\r\nthem. Magnetism or electricity therefore must, and they are doubtless\r\nstates or phases of the same power, producing in their different states or\r\nphases the different results. And even heat--atmospheric temperature, is\r\noften, if not always the result of their action. In the present state of\r\nscience, it is enough for me that the _magnetic longitudinal currents are\r\nthere_; that they are _lines of force_ and _adequate_; that _oxygen is\r\nmagnetic_, and therefore the atmosphere must be affected by them--that so\r\nfar as we can reason from analogy, they ought to produce the effect upon\r\nthe atmosphere which we find produced, and until further light is thrown\r\nupon the subject I shall presume that they do. Every step we take\r\nhereafter in this investigation will confirm the presumption.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity to be more particularly noticed before we leave\r\nthe trade-wind region, and we are now prepared to notice it.\r\n\r\nThe belt of rains, formed by the currents of the two trades, threading\r\ntheir way through each other--how are they produced? Why should the place\r\nwhere the currents thus pass through each other be a place of almost daily\r\nprecipitation? There is, in fact, no ascension, except that which the\r\ncurrents have in their line of ascent to attain the elevation which the\r\nmagnetic law of the current requires.\r\n\r\nThe trades have passed over an evaporating surface and are charged with\r\nmoisture. This moisture they hold in magneto-electric combination.\r\n_Evaporation_ does not depend upon _temperature_. Ice and snow evaporate\r\nat all temperatures (Howard, vol. 1, p. 86). So the cold N. W. wind, full\r\nof positive electricity, will lap up, as it were, the pools from the\r\nearth, with astonishing quickness; and when this electricity is deranging\r\nthe action of the machinery and material of the manufacturer, he allays it\r\nby a supply of moisture, with which the electricity can combine. Nor does\r\nthe air lose its moisture when below the freezing point. In all parts of\r\nthe atmosphere, as at the surface of the earth in winter, moisture is held\r\nin large quantities in the coldest and severest weather; and it is not\r\ntill it moderates, and a perceptible _electric_ change takes place, that\r\nit is precipitated as rain or snow. Doubtless there is an exposure of\r\nconsiderable surfaces, of opposite currents, charged with opposite\r\npolarity, and a constant depolarization where their surfaces meet. May\r\nthere not be a consequent dissolution of the electro-magnetic combination\r\nbetween the air and moisture, or the excitation of that electric action\r\nwhich attends or produces like rains every where? and hence the constant\r\nprecipitation. This is rendered probable, by the fact that precipitation,\r\nat the meeting of the trades, takes place in level countries in the\r\nday-time, between 10 A. M. and sunset, in showers, with thunder and\r\nlightning, as with us in summer, although among the mountains the rain\r\nsometimes falls in the night also. The precipitation in the heat of the\r\nday is obviously induced by the action of the sun, although it is by no\r\nmeans certain that the friction of the opposing surfaces does not assist\r\nin the operation.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the lines of magnetic force curve upward and carry\r\nthe trades with them, and that, therefore, precipitation by condensation\r\nfrom the mere cold of the upper stratum of the atmosphere is possible.\r\nBut, there are three reasons why I do not believe such to be the fact.\r\n\r\n1st. Precipitation takes place in the day time mainly, and in sudden,\r\nisolated, heavy showers and not in steady continuous rain. Nor is there\r\ncondensation or continual mist at other hours of the day.\r\n\r\n2d. They occur at a time of day when the sun is affecting the magnetic\r\ncurrents most powerfully, _viz._, between ten o'clock A. M. and sunset,\r\nand mainly at the time of greatest heat.\r\n\r\n3d. The counter-trades _do not precipitate_ after they leave the rainy\r\nbelt, although at a great elevation, until they reach the outward limits\r\nof the trades; and they _do precipitate again_, although they gradually\r\ndescend _nearer the earth_, as soon as they become subject to the action\r\nof the currents of an opposite magnetism. Their precipitation is partial\r\ntoo, even then, and they carry a portion of their moisture through an\r\natmosphere of the coldest temperature up to the geographical poles.\r\n\r\nA similar result attends the action of the sun in the extra-tropical\r\nregions. Cumuli commence forming in the counter-trade, or at the line\r\nbetween that and the surface current, at the same time of day that the\r\ndiurnal motion of the magnetic needle commences, or the rain clouds form\r\nin the tropics; they continue to enlarge here as there, till about the\r\nsame hour of the day that the _needle_ obtains its maximum diurnal\r\nvariations; and when the influence of the sun upon the needle ceases, and\r\nit returns to its original status, the cumuli disappear. Hail storms too,\r\nit is said, always, or generally occur in the day time.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the sea-breezes and other fair-weather surface winds, rise\r\nin the forenoon with the influence of the sun upon the magnetic currents\r\nand the needle, and die away at nightfall when the influence ceases.\r\n\r\nThere are other electro-magnetic, or to speak more correctly,\r\nmagneto-electric, effects of the sun's action equally illustrative, which\r\ntend to show that the precipitation at the passing of the trades, is the\r\nresult of their action upon each other, aided by the sun, to which we\r\nshall allude when we come to speak of the causes and character of the\r\nsurface winds of the extra-tropical regions.\r\n\r\nAs, however, this takes place only, or mainly, where the threading\r\nsurfaces meet, it is but partial, and the body of the respective polarized\r\ncurrents pursue their way unaffected, toward the opposite magnetic\r\npole--and there for the present we leave them.\r\n\r\nStorms sometimes originate in these currents, when concentrated, as in the\r\nWest Indies, the China Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean, while\r\npassing through the rainy belt, and move with the current to the\r\nnorth-west if issuing on the north side of it, and to the south-west if\r\nissuing on the south side of it, until they respectively get beyond the\r\nextreme limits of the trades, and then they curve to the eastward,\r\nimbedded in and following their current. The peculiar extension of the\r\nland to the east on the northern portions of South America, prevents the\r\ngathering of an aerial gulf similar to the one which we have described to\r\nthe north-west, entering upon our division of the continent over the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. It is otherwise in the Indian Ocean, and there the storms are\r\nfound issuing from the rainy belt on the southern side, sweeping over the\r\nMauritius and other islands of that ocean, and _often simultaneously_ with\r\nstorms issuing on the north over the Bay of Bengal. Colonel Reid mentions\r\ninstances and gives a diagram.[2]\r\n\r\nThese storms in milder forms issue from the rain belt at other points, and\r\nmay issue any where, but will always be found most extensive and most\r\nviolent, that is to say, as hurricanes and typhoons, in the concentrated\r\nvolumes of counter-trade on the western side of the great oceans, within a\r\nfew hundred miles of the lines of magnetic intensity and no variation, and\r\nwhen they form in the rainy belt they are highly electric. Most\r\nfrequently, however, as we shall see, they form in these currents after\r\nthey have issued from the rainy belt, and after they have passed the\r\nextreme limits of the trades and become subject to the circular and\r\nperpendicular magnetic currents which exist north and south of the\r\nlongitudinal ones, and which when seen upon the magnetic needle, attract\r\nthe filings and cause them to adhere--although but slight attraction or\r\nadhesion takes place where the longitudinal currents exist.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the atmospheric arrangements and phenomena of the\r\ntrade-wind region, and the cause that produces them; such is the character\r\nand cause of the enlarged volume of counter-trade, which spreads out and\r\nblows over our country as permanently as the S. E. trades blow on the\r\nSouth Atlantic and South America, returning to us the rivers which had run\r\nfrom us to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nComing back now, to a consideration of the course and functions of the\r\ncounter-trade after it leaves the northern limit of the surface-trades, we\r\nfind it curves to the eastward and gradually assumes about an E. N. E.\r\ncourse, and becomes a W. S. W. current where it crosses the line of no\r\nvariation, and continues on until it passes off over the Atlantic; and\r\nthis course and curve is analogous to what may be found true of the\r\ncounter-trades every where. It is best illustrated by the course of all\r\nthe storms (in the American sense of the word, as distinguished from\r\nthunder showers and other brief rains), which have been traced north or\r\nsouth of the limits of the trades. It was found by Mr. Redfield in most of\r\nthe storms investigated by him, which originated within, or north of the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was the actual course of the others, and that the\r\ninvestigation was imperfect. All the great autumnal, winter, or spring\r\nstorms which have traversed the whole or any considerable portion of the\r\nterritory of the United States, east of New Mexico, which have been\r\ninvestigated by Professors Espy, Loomis, Redfield, or others, have been\r\nfound to follow this course. A storm which passed over Madeira, appears\r\nfrom the investigations of Colonel Reid to have followed the same law of\r\ncurvature.\r\n\r\nAnd so, doubtless, did another which he has described as passing over the\r\nLevant. The storms which supply the winter rains of California and Utah,\r\nreach them by this law of curvature and progress, after the northern\r\nlimits of the trades have descended to the south with the sun, so that the\r\ncounter-trades of the Pacific may descend to the surface and curve in upon\r\nthem. But the absence of a concentration of the counter-trade, and its\r\ndeficient action because of its passage over mountain ranges, and their\r\nlocation so near the northern limit of the trades that their storms can\r\nnot expand and become extensive, as well as their weaker magnetic\r\nintensity, prevent their storms from becoming violent, and their supply of\r\nrain is not large and much of it falls in showers. The same is true of the\r\nBarbary States, of Syria, and Persia, and of Southern Europe; and indeed\r\nof all the countries of the globe which lie between the winter and summer\r\nextreme limits of the surface-trades, and without the limits of the two\r\nconcentrated counter-trades. Enough appears in the writings of the\r\nmeteorologists of Europe to show, that their long continued rains, which\r\nare analogous to our storms and are _preceded by the formation of the true\r\ncirrus of the counter-trade_, follow the same great law of curvature and\r\nprogress; although the presence of the Gulf Stream with its mass of south\r\npolar waters on the western side of the British Islands, Denmark, and\r\nNorway supplies them with showers, and fogs, and cumuli from the west and\r\nnorth-west, and makes the mean of the surface winds of their storms\r\nsomewhat variant from ours. A like law reversed prevails in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The storms of New Holland and the Indian Ocean, south of the\r\nlimits of the trade, curve to the eastward and travel about south-east,\r\ntheir _south-west_ being a _clearing off wind_ as our _north-west_ is, and\r\n_precisely similar in all its other characteristics_, where the relation\r\nof magnetic intensity is the same.\r\n\r\nThe storms of the Pacific on the S. W. coast of South America, in like\r\nmanner travel to the S. E., flooding the western slopes of the mountain\r\nranges with rain, and aggravated by the intensity of the magnetic currents\r\nat the extremity of the continent in a high latitude, meet the mariner in\r\nthe face as he emerges from under the lee of the land and attempts to pass\r\nthe Horn. It will ultimately be shown that the precipitation which takes\r\nplace, as the storms and counter-trades pass north and east in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere and south and east in the southern hemisphere, is\r\nowing less to cold than increased magnetic intensity. And all this is the\r\nresult of one great uniform law, existing every where, varying in its\r\nphenomena only in consequence of the difference in volume, and\r\nmagneto-electric intensity of the portions of the counter-trade, as of the\r\nsurface-trade at different places, and the different magnetic intensity of\r\nthe local perpendicular and circular currents of the earth over which they\r\npass, at different periods and at different points.\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield and Lieutenant Maury have assumed that our S. W. current\r\ncomes from the Pacific Ocean. Aside from the adverse evidence which the\r\ninvestigations of the former in relation to the course of the West Indian\r\nstorms, and their curving over the continent, furnish to the contrary, and\r\nthat which has herein before been stated in relation to the law of\r\ncurvature, it is obvious they are mistaken, for another and conclusive\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach us from the Pacific in a direction from S. W. to N. E.,\r\nit must pass the table lands and mountain ranges of Mexico and New Mexico,\r\nand it would supply them bountifully, even if it did not thereby leave us\r\ncomparatively rainless and sterile. Every where currents passing from the\r\nocean _over mountain ranges_ part with a large share of their moisture.\r\nThus the counter-trade which curves over the Andes and over Peru, is\r\ndeprived of its moisture and leaves the western coast rainless. So in\r\ndegree of the counter-trade which curves over the Himalaya and Kuenlon\r\nMountains, and from there passes over the Desert of Cobi, to the north and\r\neast--it is deprived by those elevated ranges of its moisture. So the\r\nmountains on the south-western coast of South America are drenched with\r\nrain, while Patagonia, which lies on the east of them is comparatively\r\ndry. And so of every other country similarly situated.\r\n\r\nNow the mountain ranges and table lands of Mexico are not thus supplied\r\nwith moisture. For the space of four months in Southern and less in\r\nNorthern Mexico, and in summer, and while the belt of the tropics is\r\nextended up over them, they have rain and in daily showers which _travel\r\nup from the south_, indicating the course of the counter-trade. (See\r\nBartlett's Personal Narrative, vol. ii. p. 286.) At other seasons, and\r\nwhile we are bountifully supplied, they are dry. In short, there are no\r\ntwo portions of the earth that differ more widely in regard to their\r\nsupply of moisture, and all their climatic characteristics and relations.\r\nIt is therefore, according to all analogy, impossible that our\r\ncounter-trade should come from the South Pacific across the continent and\r\nbelow 35 deg., and in this also those gentlemen are mistaken.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Espy and Redfield recognizing the existence of \"a prevailing\" S.\r\nW. current, but considering the surface-winds beneath it as the principal\r\nactors in producing the atmospherical conditions and changes, have\r\nattributed no office to that current, except that of giving direction and\r\nprogression to our storms. This is their great mistake. It plays no such\r\nunimportant part in the philosophy of the weather, as we have already\r\nincidentally seen, and will proceed still further to consider.\r\n\r\n_All our storms originate in it._ This we may know from analogy.\r\n\r\n_Where there is no counter-trade, outside of the equatorial belt of rains,\r\nand within influential distance of the earth, there are neither storms nor\r\nrain._ So, when, as we have seen, the concentration of the volume of\r\nnorthern counter-trade in the West Indies, gathered by the hauling of the\r\nS. E. trades more from the east, as they approach the central belt,\r\ndiminishing the volume of the counter-trade over the North Atlantic, the\r\ncalms and drought of the horse-latitudes are found. And when the\r\ncounter-trade is small in volume and weak in intensity, by reason of the\r\nfact that the surface-trades from the opposite hemisphere which constitute\r\nit, formed upon land where evaporation was small, as upon Southern Africa\r\nand New Holland, or formed where the magnetic intensity was weak, or\r\npassed over mountain ranges in their course, the annual supply of rain,\r\nthe ranges of the barometer, and the alternations of atmospheres\r\nconditions are remarkably less.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen where the rainless portions of the earth are, and why\r\nthey are so; because those lying north of the northern limit of the\r\nequatorial rainy belt were yet too far south to be covered by the line of\r\nextra-tropical rains; or in other words, too far south to be uncovered by\r\nthe surface N. E. trades and the longitudinal magnetic currents, and to be\r\ncovered by the counter-trades in contact, or nearly so with the earth, and\r\ninfluenced by the perpendicular north polar magnetic currents. Thus we\r\nhave seen that the rains of Southern Mexico were summer rains, due to the\r\nnorthern extension of the equatorial rainy belt; those of California were\r\nwinter rains, due to the southern extension of the extra-tropical rains\r\nfollowing the N. E. surface trades. We have also briefly alluded to the\r\nfact that either side of the equatorial rainy belt, evaporation is going\r\non for months under a vertical sun, without precipitation--unless it be\r\nfrom an occasional brief storm of great intensity which originates in that\r\nbelt at the line of it, and passing on in the counter-trade, reverses, for\r\nthe time being, by its concentrated and powerful action, like a magnetic\r\nbody introduced into the field of another magnet, the surface-trades. Mere\r\nevaporation then, does not produce the storm, or shower, or rain, where\r\nmost active in the dry torrid zone. It may be said that those dry portions\r\nare, for the time being (as the rainless portions of the earth are\r\ncontinually), within the operation of the surface-trades, and that\r\ntherefore the evaporated moisture is carried away by them toward the\r\nequatorial rainy belt. Precisely so; but why carried away? Why should it\r\nnot condense, occasionally, at least, and drop the rain as it passes\r\nalong, if a great supply of moisture from excessive evaporation could\r\nfurnish rain. Perhaps it may still be said it is going from a cold to a\r\nwarm section. This is not true, as we have shown.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said that the rainless regions at any rate receive no\r\nmoisture, and therefore can not supply any by evaporation. This would not\r\nmeet the case, as it would still be true that when the rainy belt has left\r\na given spot, the dry weather sets in with excessive evaporation, and the\r\nnorth-east trades in summer, blowing from the countries lying north of the\r\nrainless regions, and which have been supplied during the interval by the\r\nextra-tropical rains, and are loaded with evaporation, are passing over\r\nthe rainless regions on their way to enter the central belt. So blow the\r\nN. E. trades from the Mediterranean, and the Barbary States _over the\r\nDesert of Sahara_ and into the rainy belt south of it; but drop no\r\nmoisture on their way, because exposed to no magnetic currents of an\r\nopposite polarity.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true that all the rainless regions are without evaporation.\r\nEgypt is an exception. The annual freshets of the Nile saturate its\r\ncentral valley, and vast reservoirs of water are saved from it and let out\r\nover its surface, and it all evaporates, but produces no rain. And so are\r\nlarge quantities turned aside and scattered over the bottom lands of\r\nNorthern Mexico, and other countries, during the dry season, and their\r\nevaporation furnishes no rain. Hygrometers and dew points are of no\r\nconsequence there--nor are they of any, on either side of the rainy belt,\r\nwhere six perpendicular feet of moisture is evaporated in six months.\r\n\r\nAgain we have alluded to a strip of coast on the Pacific west of the\r\nmountain ranges of South America, lying partly in Peru, partly in Bolivia,\r\nand partly in Northern Chili, which, although long and narrow, washed by\r\nthe broad Pacific Ocean, is without rain. South America has no other\r\n_wholly_ rainless region, so far as is known. A part of this region would\r\nlie between the equatorial belt of rain, and the southern extra-tropical\r\none, and never be covered by either; but the volume of N. E. trades from\r\nthe Atlantic, although from the make of the land not concentrated to so\r\ngreat an extent as the volume of S. E. trade on the north, and therefore\r\nnot so liable to hurricanes and other violent storms, is yet sufficiently\r\nso to carry the southern line of the equinoctial rainy belt down in winter\r\nto the summer line of extra-tropical rains, and give a supply of rain to\r\nall the continent--leaving no strictly rainless region south of the\r\nequatorial rainy belt and east of the Andes. Those mountains, however,\r\npresent a barrier to its south-western progress which it doubtless passes\r\nto some extent, but deprived of its moisture, and unable to supply the\r\nrainless coast region of Peru, Bolivia, and Northern Chili. There is,\r\ntherefore, a portion of this rainless line of coast which is within the\r\nregion of extra-tropical rains, over which a portion of the N. E. trades\r\nof the Atlantic, as a counter-trade, should or do, curve, and where there\r\nshould therefore be extra-tropical rains. It is washed by the Pacific, an\r\nevaporating surface, and westerly and south-west breezes are drawn in from\r\nthat ocean over it. Why then is it rainless? The only reason which can be\r\nassigned why rain does not fall there is that the high mountain ranges of\r\nthe Andes intercept and perhaps in part divert the counter-trade, and\r\ndeprive that portion of it which passes them, of its moisture, by that\r\nreciprocal action of opposite polarities which takes place whenever and\r\nwherever the trade approaches so near the earth; and it curves over the\r\nnarrow line of coast with the feeble condensation, and imperfect forms,\r\nand varied coloring which mark so peculiarly the rainless clouds of that\r\nregion. (See Stewart's Journal of a Voyage to the Sandwich Islands, page\r\n72.)\r\n\r\nAgain, it is estimated, and on reliable data, that twelve perpendicular\r\nfeet of water are annually evaporated from the surface of the Red Sea,\r\nbetween Nubia on one side, and Arabia on the other; yet they are both\r\nrainless countries, except so far as the inter-tropical belt of rains\r\nextends up on to a small portion of them. The moisture of evaporation,\r\nfloated up from a surface covered by the surface-trade is invariably so\r\ncombined as to remain uncondensed till it has passed south into the\r\nequatorial rainy belt, and over to the opposite hemisphere, and been\r\nexposed to the currents of an opposite magnetism.\r\n\r\nAgain, the N. E. trades extended up in summer over the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nan evaporating surface, blow over the Barbary States in June and July, but\r\nfurnish no rain. And so of the S. E. or N. E. trades which blow over\r\nBrazil and other countries in the absence north or south of the tropical\r\nbelt of rains.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from these facts--and more like them might be cited--that\r\nmere evaporation, however copious or long continued, does not make the\r\nstorm or shower in the locality where it takes place, and _without the\r\nexistence and influential agency_ of a counter-trade; and that _reciprocal\r\naction_, whatever it may be, that takes place _between it and the earth_.\r\n\r\nAgain, our own experience is conclusive of this. We have no surface-trade\r\nnorth of 30 deg., and yet a long drought and great evaporation may follow a\r\nwet spring. Belts of droughts and frequent rains occur every year in\r\ndifferent portions of the country side by side, and _the dividing line\r\nfollows the course of the counter-trade_, and is sometimes distinctly\r\nmarked for weeks. When a change occurs in the counter-trade, whether from\r\ncauses existing there or the influence of terrestrial magnetism (in\r\nrelation to which we shall inquire hereafter), showers form or storms come\r\non: until it does they will not. Efforts at condensation will occasionally\r\nappear, but they will be feeble and ineffectual, and occasion a repetition\r\nof the axiom that \"all signs fail in a drought.\" And we may know it from\r\ndirect observation.\r\n\r\nThe first indications of a storm, and of most if not all showers, are\r\nobservable in the counter-trade. These indications, so far as they are\r\nvisible, are of course to be looked for in the west; although the\r\ndirection and character of the surface-winds are often indicative of these\r\nchanges when not visible at the west as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe indications are those of condensation, and vary very much in different\r\nseasons of the year. It is not my purpose in this place to examine them\r\nparticularly. They will be alluded to hereafter under the head of\r\nprognostics. Suffice it now to say, then, that whether it be the long\r\nthreads or lines of cirrus which occur in the trade in the winter after a\r\nperiod of severe cold, following the interposition of a large volume of N.\r\nW. cold air and the elevation of the counter-trade; or the forms of cirrus\r\nwhich occur at other times and other seasons; or whether it be the\r\nordinary bank at night-fall, or the evening condensation which makes the\r\n\"circle\" around the moon, or the morning cirro-stratus haze which\r\ngradually thickens, passes over and obscures the sun, all which may be\r\nfollowed by the easterly scud and winds: they are alike condensation in\r\nthe trade, the advance or forming condensation of a storm or showers.\r\n\r\nThe state of the weather, whether hot or cold, is extensively affected by\r\nthis trade current. As we have already suggested, the mere presence of the\r\nsun in its summer solstice, or its absence in winter, is not an adequate\r\ncause of all the sudden and various changes to which we are subject. The\r\nstate of the counter-trade, which is always over, or _within influential\r\ndistance of us_, and sometimes probably in contact with us--the nature of\r\nthe surface-winds which it is at any given time creating and attracting\r\naround us, and the electric condition of the surface-atmosphere _induced_\r\nby it, or by the immediate action of the earth's magnetism, produce those\r\nsudden changes which mark our climate. When no intervening surface-winds\r\nelevate it above us, and there is no storm or other condensation within\r\ninfluential distance, it induces the gentle balmy S. W. wind of\r\nspring--the cooling S. W. wind of summer--the peculiar Indian summer air\r\nof autumn, or the comparatively moderate, although cold, open weather of\r\nwinter. If there be a partial tendency to condensation in it, the cumuli\r\nform under the magnetic influence excited by the sunbeams from ten to\r\nthree o'clock in the day, and float gently away to the eastward,\r\ndisappearing before night-fall. If the disposition to condensation is\r\nstronger, whether inherent or induced by an increased local activity of\r\nterrestrial magnetism, these cumuli will increase toward night-fall, or\r\nearlier, and terminate me showers; and if it is in a highly electrical\r\nstate, the still oppressive sultriness which precedes the tornado, and\r\nthat devastating scourge may appear. If this disposition to condensation\r\nbecomes extensive, cirri form and run into cirro-stratus, or they extend,\r\ncoalesce, and form stratus; the surface-wind will be attracted under them,\r\nthe thermometer fall in summer or rise in winter, and a storm begin.\r\nIntense action and sudden cold may exist in and under this counter-trade\r\nover the southern portion of the country, while all is calm, warm, and\r\nbalmy at the north. Heavy snow storms sometimes pass at the south when\r\nthere are none at the north, and a corresponding state of the weather\r\nfollows. If a large body of snow fall at the north, the winter is cold,\r\nregular, and \"old fashioned;\" if little snow falls at the north and more\r\nat the south, the winter at the north is open and broken. I have known the\r\nice make several inches thick at Baltimore and Washington, when none could\r\nbe obtained for the ice-houses on the Connecticut shore of Long Island\r\nSound. In short, although heat and cold are mainly dependent upon the\r\naltitude of the sun, aided by the other arrangements we have alluded to,\r\nyet the counter-trade, and the reciprocal action which takes place between\r\nit and the earth, are most powerful agents, mitigating the rigors of\r\nwinter, bringing about the changes from cold to warm weather which the\r\nsun is too far south to produce. And on the other hand, by this reciprocal\r\naction, producing the electrical phenomena, the gusts, the tornadoes, the\r\nhail storms, and the cool seasons of summer, and the period of intense\r\ncold in winter.\r\n\r\n_All our surface-winds, except the light, peculiar W. S. W. wind which is\r\nfelt where the counter-trade is in contact with the earth, and which is a\r\npart of it, and perhaps the genuine N. W. wind which is very peculiar, are\r\nincidents of the trade, and are due to its conditions and attractions._ We\r\nhave already said this was true of the easterly wind and scud of a\r\nstorm--it is alike true of all. The storm winds east of the Alleghanies\r\nare usually, though not always, from the eastward. They are sometimes from\r\nthe southward, as they doubtless are still more frequently in the interior\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nThere is occasionally a southerly afternoon wind, followed by short rains\r\nin spring and fall, or a succession of showers in summer, which is rather\r\na precedent wind than a storm wind; blowing toward and under an advance\r\nportion of the storm at the north, and hauling to the eastward when the\r\nrain sets in, or to the westward when the showers reach us.\r\n\r\nWhen there are no storms, or showers, or inducing electric action in the\r\ncounter-trade, within influential distance to disturb the surface\r\natmosphere, it is calm. If a storm approaches, or forms within inducing\r\ndistance, the surface atmosphere is _affected_ and _attracted toward the\r\nstorm_, from one or more points, and \"blows,\" as we say, toward and under\r\nit. It commences blowing first nearest the storm, and extends as the\r\nstorm travels, or becomes more intense and extends its inducing influence.\r\nI have repeatedly noticed this in traveling on steamboats and railroads\r\nrunning _toward_ or _from_, and in several instances _through_ a storm,\r\nand telegraphic notices and other investigations prove it. The point from\r\nwhich the surface atmosphere is attracted and blows, depends very much\r\nupon the position of the storm in relation to bodies of water and the\r\npoint of observation, and its shape; and the force with which it may blow\r\nwill depend much upon its intensity.\r\n\r\nLet us take an instance or two by way of illustration of all these points;\r\nand as I have given instances of summer in the introduction, we will take\r\nthose of winter. It is January of an \"old fashioned winter;\" the snow is\r\nabout three feet deep in Canada, about one foot in Southern New York, and\r\na few inches in Philadelphia, and so extends west to the Alleghanies at\r\nleast. For several days the sky has been clear, the thermometer rising in\r\nthe day-time, in the vicinity of New York to about 25 deg. Fahrenheit, falling\r\nat night to about 6 deg., with light airs from the N. W. during the middle and\r\nlatter part of the day; the counter-trade and the barometer both running\r\nhigh; cold but pleasant, steady, winter weather. There is a warm\r\nsouth-east rain and thaw coming, as one or more such almost invariably\r\noccur in January. How coming? The sun is far south, and shines aslant, but\r\nthrough a pure and windless atmosphere; he has tried for several days to\r\nmelt the snow from the roof; a few icicles are pendant from the eaves;\r\nbut the body of the snow is still there. How can a thaw come? not from the\r\nsun, surely. No, indeed, not from the action of the sun directly, upon our\r\ncountry, nor from the Atlantic or the Gulf Stream which is off our coast.\r\nBut a portion of the current of counter-trade is coming, heated by his\r\nrays and the warm water in the South Atlantic, in an intense\r\nmagneto-electric state, capable of inducing an electro-thermal change in\r\nthe surface atmosphere which it approaches, and of being reciprocally\r\nacted upon by the north polar terrestrial magnetism. It is now over\r\nNorthern Texas and Western Louisiana, it will be here day after tomorrow.\r\nThe day passes as the day previous had passed; the sleigh-bells jingle\r\nmerrily in the evening; the moon shines clear all night; the storm is\r\ncoming steadily on, but its influence has not reached us, and the morning\r\nand midday are like those which preceded it. As nightfall approaches,\r\nhowever, the thermometer does not fall as rapidly as on the day previous;\r\nthe sun shines dimly and through lines of whitish cirrus cloud extending\r\nfrom the horizon at the west, appearing darker as the sun descends and\r\nshines more _horizontally_ through them--perhaps mainly in the N. W.--and\r\nwhich extend up and over toward the E. N. E. The air next the earth begins\r\nto feel raw; it is changing, not from warm to cold, but _electrically_\r\nfrom positive to negative; and dampening, from a tendency to condensation\r\nby induction, as we shall see--the same condensation which in warm\r\nweather may be seen on flagging stones, and walls, and vessels containing\r\ncold water. The advance cirrus condensation of the storm is over us and\r\naffecting us; the earth too is affecting the adjacent atmosphere by action\r\nextended from beneath the storm. Still there is no wind, although sounds\r\nseem to be heard a little more distinctly from the east, and so ends the\r\nday. Evening comes, and the moon wades in a smooth bank of cirro-stratus\r\nhaze, with a very large circle around her; the cirrus bands of haze have\r\ncoalesced and formed a thin stratus. The storm is coming steadily on, its\r\ncondensation is seen to be thicker as it approaches, it is now raining\r\nfrom one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles to the west, but we do not\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nThat it is about to storm all believe, for all are conscious of a change.\r\nThe candle if extinguished will not relight as readily, if at all, on\r\nbeing blown; there is a crackling almost too faint for snow in the fire;\r\nthe sun did not set clear; the old rheumatic joints complain, and the\r\nvenerable corns ache.\r\n\r\nMorning comes, and the storm is on. The wind is blowing from the S. E.,\r\nthe scud are running rapidly from the same quarter to the N. W., the\r\nthermometer continues rising, and it rains. The storm has reached us and\r\nthe thaw has commenced. Gradually, as the densest portion of the storm\r\ncloud reaches us, it darkens; the scud are nearer the earth, and run with\r\nmore rapidity; the rain falls more heavily and continuously, and by the\r\nmiddle of the day a thick fog has enveloped the earth; the wind is dying\r\naway, and the trade itself, with its southern tendency to fog, has settled\r\nnear us; the barometer has fallen, the thermometer is up to fifty degrees,\r\nthe water is running down the hills, the snow is saturated with water and\r\nis disappearing under the influence of the fog, the rain, and the warm\r\nair. Evening comes; the south-east wind and the rain have ceased; the rain\r\nclouds have passed off to the eastward; the fog has followed on and\r\ndisappeared; there is a light trade air from the S. W.; the moon shines\r\nout, and a few patches of stratus, broken up into fragments and melting\r\naway, are following on in the trade: the storm is past.\r\n\r\nHark! to the tones of Boreas as he bursts forth from the N. W., and\r\nrushing, whistling, howling, dashes on between the trade and the earth,\r\nfollowing the storm. Now the barometer rises rapidly, the thermometer\r\nfalls, and in an incredibly short time all is congealed, and cold and\r\nwintery as before. The cold N. W. wind has again interposed between the\r\ntrade and the earth; the trade is elevated a mile or more above it and is\r\nentirely free from its influence and from condensation; the deep blue of a\r\nsky \"as pure as the spirit that made it\" is over us, and steady winter\r\nreigns again.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there was nothing in the action of the sun upon our\r\nsnow-clad country, to induce the thaw or the storm. It began, continued,\r\napproached, and passed off to the N. E. in the counter-trade. The S. E.\r\nwind which existed every where within its influence: in the interior\r\nStates, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and in Canada, as\r\nwell as upon the Atlantic coast, commencing in the former earlier than\r\nupon the last, was the result of its induction and attraction. Of the N.\r\nW. wind that followed we shall speak hereafter. If any one doubts whether\r\nthis be a true sketch let him examine the investigation of a storm\r\npublished by Professor Loomis, or observe for himself hereafter. If,\r\nhowever, the storm of Professor Loomis is referred to, it should be\r\nremembered that his notes show the occurrence of a slight distinct snow\r\nstorm at the N. W. stations one day in advance of the principal storm. The\r\nlatter appears first as rain at Fort Towson, on the nineteenth, moving\r\nnorth and curving to the east--its center passing near St. Louis, and\r\nsouth of Quebec, and the whole storm enlarging as it advanced.\r\n\r\nTake another instance. Since the thaw it has not been quite as cold as\r\nbefore; but the rain-soaked snow is hard and solid, the ground, where the\r\nsnow was blown or worn off, icy and slippery--the thermometer falls during\r\nthe night to about 12 deg., and rises to about 30 deg.; the sun makes no\r\nimpression upon the snow; the firmament is of the deepest blue, the\r\nborealis at night vivid. \"O, for a storm of some kind, to mitigate the\r\nstill severe cold;\" for the thaw has made us more sensitive, and storm\r\nwinds do blow warm in their season. But patience, it will come. Another\r\nday, or two, perhaps, pass: the sun rises as usual, the thermometer has\r\nthe same range still. \"Long cold snap,\" we exclaim; \"how long will it\r\nlast?\"\r\n\r\nA change is coming, but this time it will snow. About an hour or two after\r\nsunrise the cirrus threads are discoverable again in the west, but now\r\nthey are most numerous in the S. W. As the day passes on they thicken and\r\nadvance toward the E. N. E., the sun begins to be obscured, the\r\nthermometer rises, and it slowly \"_moderates_.\" There is a snow storm\r\napproaching from the S. W.\r\n\r\nBut the thermometer rises slowly; it must get up to 26 deg. or 28 deg. before it\r\ncan snow much. I have known in one instance, at Norwalk, a considerable\r\nfall of snow, although much mingled with hail, when the thermometer stood\r\nat 13 deg. above zero, and one, a moderate fall, some two inches, with it at\r\n24 deg., but these were exceptions. The snow range of the thermometer on the\r\nparallel of 41 deg. north latitude, and south of it, is from 26 deg. to 30 deg. above\r\n0 deg.; when colder or warmer it may snow to whiten the ground, or perhaps\r\nbarely cover it, but usually rains or hails. We have seen that in the\r\npolar regions, according to Dr. Kane, it is about zero, but the rise of\r\nthe thermometer there, previous to the snow, was about the same as here,\r\n_i. e._, from 15 deg. to 25 deg.. This fact is instructive. Since the foregoing\r\nwas written, and on the 7th of February, 1855, a snow-storm of\r\nconsiderable length set in, with the thermometer at 5 deg., and continued more\r\nthan twenty-four hours, the thermometer gradually rising. The snow was\r\nvery fine, like that described by Arctic voyagers as falling in extreme\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\nAs the dense and darker portions of the storm approach, and although the\r\nsun is obscured, and the ground frozen, it continues to moderate, and at\r\nevening, when the thermometer is up to 28 deg., and the dense portion of the\r\nstorm has reached us, gently and in calmness the snow begins to fall.\r\nPerhaps a light air following the storm, or the presence of the trade near\r\nthe earth, at first inclines the snow-flakes to the eastward. This is\r\nfrequently so at the commencement of snow storms. Ere long, however, the\r\nwind rises from the N. E., and the snow is driven against the windows,\r\nrounded and hardened by the attrition of its flakes upon each other, in\r\ntheir descent through the eddying and opposite currents. The next day we\r\nrise to witness a heavy fall of snow, perhaps, and a continued driving N.\r\nE. storm, in full blast; the snow whirling and settling in drifts under\r\nthe lee of every fence or building.\r\n\r\nCan it be, you ask, that this driving wind is but an _incident_ of the\r\nstorm? the result of _attraction_, while the storm clouds are sailing\r\nquietly and undisturbed on in the counter-trade above, directly over the\r\ngale which is blowing below? It is even so. Nor has it \"backed up,\" as it\r\nis termed by those who have ascertained that it has commenced snowing\r\nfirst, and cleared off first, at a point west of them. You saw, or might\r\nhave seen, the cirro-stratus cloud passing to the E. N. E. in the\r\nafternoon, and until the snow-flakes filled the air, and the clouds became\r\ninvisible. You may still see that the wind will die away before the storm\r\nbreaks, and \"come out\" gently from the S. W., unless it should back into\r\nthe northward and westward, and in either event you may see the last of\r\nthe storm clouds, as you did see, or might have seen the first of them,\r\npass to the eastward. Toward night the wind dies away, and the storm\r\npasses off abruptly, or the sky becomes clear in the N. W. Now you may see\r\nthe smooth stratus storm cloud, continuous, or breaking up into fragments\r\nand passing off to the east, even at the edge which borders the clear sky\r\nin the west or north-west, to be followed that evening or the next day, by\r\nthe north-west wind and its peculiar fair-weather scud.\r\n\r\nI have given these as instances illustrating the manner in which rain and\r\nsnow storms originate the surface easterly winds in winter.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that they commence with precisely the same\r\nappearances in every case in winter; much less in summer. There is very\r\ngreat diversity in this respect, in different seasons, and in different\r\nstorms during the same season. A great many different and accurate\r\ndescriptions might be given, if time and space would permit, which all\r\nwould recognize as truthful. Very frequently in summer, and sometimes in\r\nwinter, the wind will set in from the eastward, and blow fresh toward a\r\nstorm, before the condensation in the trade, which forms the eastern and\r\napproaching edge of the storm, has assumed the form of a distinct cloud.\r\nNot unfrequently, when it is calm next the surface, a narrow stratum of\r\neasterly wind, a half a mile or a mile above the earth, may be seen with a\r\ncontinuous fog, condensing, but not in considerable patches like the\r\nusual scud, running with great rapidity toward the storm. Such a stream of\r\nfog blew with great rapidity for thirty-six hours toward the storm which\r\ninundated Virginia and Pennsylvania, in 1852, and carried away the Potomac\r\nbridge at Washington. Such a stream of fog was visible the evening before\r\nthe great flood of 1854, which inundated Connecticut, and curried away so\r\nmany railroad and other bridges. I have also seen such a stream of fog\r\nrunning at about the same height, when it was calm at the surface, from\r\nthe S. W. toward a violent storm which formed over central New\r\nEngland--and from the north toward a heavy storm passing south of us. Such\r\nstrata form, as far as I have been able to discover, the _middle current_\r\nof storms which are accompanied with very heavy falls of rain. These\r\ndouble currents are much more common than is supposed. East of the\r\nAlleghanies, short and heavy rain storms, which commence north-east,\r\nhauling to the south and lighting up about mid-day _after a very rainy\r\nforenoon_, frequently have a S. E. or S. S. E. middle current of this\r\ncharacter, which involves the whole surface atmosphere when the storm has\r\nnearly passed, and the N. E. wind dies away, and the wind seems to haul to\r\nthe S. S. E. and S.; so that it is rather the prevalence of a _different_\r\nand _coexisting current_, than a hauling of the _same wind_, which marks\r\nthe period of lighting up in the south.\r\n\r\nSometimes the easterly wind will set in and blow a day or two before the\r\nborder of the storm reaches us. Sometimes the storm is passing, or will\r\npass, in its lateral southern extension, south of us, and the\r\ncondensation in the trade extends over us sufficiently dense to induce an\r\neasterly current beneath it, but not dense enough to drop rain, and then\r\nwe have a dry north-easter. I can not, within the limits I have\r\nprescribed, allude to all the peculiarities attending the induction and\r\nattraction of an easterly wind, by the storm in the counter-trade. They\r\nare readily noticeable by the attentive and discriminating observer, and\r\ntheir existence and cause is all with which I have to do at present.\r\n\r\nWinds from the north, or any point from N. N. E. to N. N. W., are\r\ncomparatively infrequent in the United States, east of the\r\nAlleghanies--though it is otherwise in the vicinity of the great lakes.\r\n\r\nSometimes the wind \"backs,\" as sailors term it, during a N. E. storm, from\r\nthe N. E. through the N. N. E., N., and N. N. W. to N. W. When this takes\r\nplace, it is toward the close of the storm. Occasionally, though very\r\nrarely, it continues to storm after the wind has passed the point of N. N.\r\nE., and until it gets N. W. I have known a few instances in the course of\r\nthirty years, and but a few. They are exceptions--rare exceptions. When\r\nthe wind thus backs from the N. E. to the N. W. through the N., you may be\r\nvery certain that the body of the storm, or at least the point of greatest\r\nintensity and greatest attraction, is at the time passing to the southward\r\nof you. This is most commonly the course of the wind when the storm\r\nextends far south and lasts several days, and does not extend north far,\r\nor if so, with much intensity, beyond the point of observation. The\r\nchange of the wind is explained by the situation of the focus of intensity\r\nand attraction, to the south of the observer, and its passage by on that\r\nside.\r\n\r\nProbably in locations further north and (as I think I have observed) south\r\nof the lakes, it may be more frequent than upon the parallel of 44 deg. east\r\nof the Alleghanies (which is as far north as I have observed), inasmuch as\r\nthe further north the locality, the more likely storms and other\r\ndisturbances in the counter-trade will be to pass to the southward of it.\r\n\r\nBetween the N. E. and S. E. the wind may blow from any point, before and\r\nduring storms, and in a clear day in the morning, as a light variable\r\nbreeze, or, after mid-day, toward approaching showers. I have known it\r\nblow all day during a storm from due east; to change back and forth\r\nbetween south-east and north-east, and to blow for hours from any\r\nintermediate point--as different portions of the storm were of different\r\nintensity, and exerted a more or less powerful inducing influence; and\r\ndoubtless this often takes place at sea. It depends upon the situation of\r\nthe focus of attraction of the storm, its shape relative to the particular\r\nlocality, and with reference to the atmosphere east of it, and peculiar\r\nlocal magnetic action; or, as is sometimes the case in low latitudes, is\r\nowing to the fact that the storm is made up of many imperfectly connected\r\nshowers, which have different force, and induce changeable and baffling\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThe inducing and attracting influence of the approaching storm is exerted\r\nsooner, and with most force, upon the surface atmosphere, over bodies of\r\nwater like the ocean and the lakes. Thus, the wind will set from the\r\neastward toward an approaching storm out upon Long Island Sound, for hours\r\nbefore it is felt upon either shore; and when all is calm in the evening\r\non land, and often before the moon forms a halo or circle in the milky\r\ncondensation of the approaching storm, or any sign of condensation is\r\nvisible, the breaking of the waves upon the shores may be heard. Doubtless\r\nthis may be observed on the shores of the Atlantic at other points.\r\n\r\nThis power of attracting the surface atmosphere from bodies of water like\r\nthe ocean and the great lakes, will account for two apparent anomalies,\r\nmentioned by Mr. Blodget in a valuable and instructive article read to the\r\nScientific Convention, in 1853, regarding the annual fall of rain over the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFirst--the influence of mountains in extracting the water from the\r\natmospheric currents which pass over them, is well known and readily\r\nexplainable. Mr. Blodget, however, found that the source of our rains,\r\nwhatever it might be, when it reached the Alleghanies, was so far\r\nexhausted of its moisture that those mountains extracted less from it than\r\nfell to the westward, by some five to ten inches annually; and that the\r\nfall of rain upon them was less than upon the Atlantic slope eastward of\r\nthem, to the ocean. This does not accord with observation elsewhere, but\r\nis easily explained. As the storm approaches the ocean, it attracts in\r\nunder it the surface atmosphere of the ocean, loaded with vapor,\r\ncondensing in the form of fog and scud, as it becomes subject to the\r\nincreasing influence of the storm. Although the scud and fog would not of\r\nitself make rain, it aids materially in increasing the quantity of that\r\nwhich falls through it. The drops, by attraction and contact, enlarge\r\nthemselves as they pass through, in the same manner as a drop of water\r\nwill do in running down a pane of glass which is covered with moisture.\r\nThe small drop which starts from the upper portion of a fifteen-inch pane,\r\nwill sometimes more than double its size before it reaches the bottom. _It\r\nis by this power of attracting the surface atmosphere, which contains the\r\nmoisture of evaporation, under it, and inducing condensation in it, that\r\nthe moisture of evaporation which rarely rises very far in the atmosphere\r\nis made to fall again during storms and showers._ This attraction of a\r\nmoist atmosphere from the ocean accounts for the excess of rain on the\r\neast of the Alleghanies, compared with its fall upon them. So the great\r\nvalley of the Mississippi is comparatively level, and less of its water\r\nruns off than of that which falls upon the Alleghanies. There is,\r\ntherefore, more moisture of evaporation in the atmosphere of the former to\r\nbe thus precipitated and add to the annual supply of rain upon that\r\nvalley, and it exceeds that which falls upon the Alleghanies. Those\r\nmountains, too, are elevated but about 1,500 feet above the table-lands at\r\ntheir base, and exert little influence on the counter-trade. If they, were\r\n6,000 or 8,000 feet high, a different state of things would exist.\r\n\r\nSecond--Mr. Blodget found the quantity of rain which fell in Iowa, and to\r\nthe south and west of the lake region, to be greater than fell over the\r\nlake region itself. This is doubtless in part owing to the same cause. The\r\ncounter-trade, in a stormy state, attracts the surface atmosphere from the\r\nlake region, with its evaporated moisture, before it arrives over it, and\r\ntherefore more rain falls S. W. of the lake region than upon it. This\r\npower of attracting the surface wind of the ocean in under it, produces\r\nthe heavy gales which affect our coast, and which are rarely felt west of\r\nthe Alleghanies to any considerable degree; and a storm coming from the W.\r\nS. W., extending a thousand miles or more from S. S. E. to N. N. W., may\r\nhave the wind set in violently at S. E. on the _southern coast first_, and\r\nat later periods, successively, at points further north, and thus induce\r\nthe belief that the storm traveled from south to north.\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield finding that some of the gales which he investigated,\r\nparticularly that of September 3d, 1821, did not extend far inland, and\r\ncommenced at later periods regularly, at more northern points, concluded\r\nthat the gale traveled along the line of the coast to the northward. In\r\nthis, and in relation to the storm of 1821 (and perhaps some others), he\r\nhas been deceived. My recollections of that storm are accurate and\r\ndistinct. But I shall recur to this again when I come to speak of his\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nToward storms, or belts of showers which would be storms if it were not\r\nsummer and the tropical tendency to showers active in the trade, which\r\npass mainly to the north of us, or commence north and pass over us,\r\ncondensing south while progressing east, the wind may commence blowing\r\nbefore the body of the storm reaches us, from any point between south by\r\nwest and south east, particularly in the summer season and in the\r\nafternoon. When the rain in a storm of this character sets in, in the\r\nnight, it will sometimes haul into the S. E., if the focus of attraction\r\nbe situated north of us, and so remain until just before the storm is to\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a class of southerly summer winds which deserve more\r\nparticular notice. For two or three months in the year--say from the\r\nmiddle of June to the 20th of August--storms on the eastern part of the\r\ncontinent, except in wet seasons, are rare, and most of our rain is\r\nderived from showers. During these periods belts of drought are frequent,\r\nsometimes in one locality, and sometimes in another, extending with\r\nconsiderable regularity from W. S. W. to E. N. E. in the course of the\r\ncounter-trade, while rain falls in frequent and almost daily showers to\r\nthe northward or southward of them. If the daily rains are at the north,\r\nover the belt of drought, S. S. W. and S. W. by S. winds blow, sometimes\r\nwith cumuli or scud, during the middle of the day and afternoon, to\r\nunderlie the showery counter-trade on the north of the line of drought.\r\nThus, sometimes nearly every day for several days, the evaporated moisture\r\nof the dry belt will be carried over to increase the store of those who\r\nhave a sufficient supply without. During the latter part of the afternoon\r\nthe clouds in the west may look very much like a gathering shower, but the\r\nattractions of the counter-trade fifty or one or two hundred miles to the\r\nnorth, will absorb them all, and at nightfall the wind will haul to the S.\r\nW. on a line with the counter-trade, and die away.\r\n\r\nIf there be a drought on any given line of latitude, and frequent showers\r\nor heavy rains at the south of it, although there may not be a like\r\nsurface-wind, with cumuli and fog, blowing from the north toward it, yet a\r\ngeneral, gentle set of the atmosphere, from the N. N. W., or N. W., or\r\nother northerly point, toward the belt of rains, some distance above the\r\nearth, will often be observable, with a barometer continually depressed,\r\nand perhaps a cool atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuring set fair weather, when the attracting belt of rains is far north,\r\non the north shore of Long Island Sound, the wind, like a sea breeze, will\r\nset in gently from about S. S. E. or S. by E. in the forenoon, blowing a\r\ngentle breeze through the day, and hauling to W. S. W. on a line with the\r\ntrade at nightfall, and dying away. During a drought I have known this to\r\nhappen for seventeen successive days. It is obvious to an attentive\r\nobserver that this is the result of the influence of the sun in exciting\r\nthe magnetic influence of the earth, and producing a state of the trade\r\nnot unlike that which induces the formation of cumuli, and which attracts\r\nthe surface atmosphere from the Sound in over the land: for the _tendency\r\nto cumulus condensation precedes the breeze_, and the breeze is often\r\nwanting in the hottest days where no such tendency to the formation of\r\ncumuli exists. The same is true of sea breezes elsewhere. They do not blow\r\nin upon some of the hottest surfaces. Where they do exist, they do not\r\nalways blow, but are wanting during the hottest days; and careful\r\nobservers have identified their appearance with the formation of cumuli,\r\nor other condensation, upon the hills inland. They are not, therefore, the\r\nresult of ascending currents of heated air.\r\n\r\nThe received theory regarding sea and land breezes is a mistaken one in\r\nanother respect. There is no such thing as a land wind corresponding in\r\nforce to, and the opposite of, the sea breeze--occasioned by the\r\ncomparative warmth of the ocean. These breezes blow mainly within the\r\ntrade-wind region. Of course they are either beneath the belt of rains or\r\nthe adjoining trades. They are said to be, and doubtless are, most active\r\nand strongly marked on lines of coast, particularly the Malabar coast, and\r\nwhere the trade-winds are drawing usually from them. In the day-time, when\r\nthe action of the sun increases the action of the magnetic currents upon\r\nthe land, or there are _elevations inland_ which approach the\r\ncounter-trade, and especially if it is elevated near the coast, as the\r\nMalabar coast is by the Ghauts, the attraction of this atmosphere over it\r\n_reverses the trade_, or inclines it in upon the land, and it blows in\r\nobliquely or perpendicularly, according to the relative trending of the\r\ncoast and the direction of the surface-trade. Thus, where islands are\r\nsituated within the range of the trades, the latter will be _reversed_\r\nduring the day on the _leeward_ side, but continue to blow as land winds\r\nduring the night. So they are sometimes deflected in upon the land on the\r\nsides, during the day, and in like manner return to their course in the\r\nnight. So, too, the north-east trades of Northern Africa, are occasionally\r\n(though feebly where the coast is flat) deflected during the day-time, and\r\nblow in as N. W. winds. Upon the southern coast of Africa the S. E. trade\r\nis deflected, and blows in as a S. W. wind. Upon the south-western coast\r\nof North America, the N. E. trades are deflected in like manner, and so\r\nare the S. E. trades upon the western coast of South America. Where the\r\ncoast mountain ranges are very elevated, as upon the western coast of the\r\nAmerican continent, this attracting influence and consequent deflection\r\nextends to a considerable distance seaward, and hence the westerly winds\r\nof California, etc. It must be understood that we are now speaking of the\r\nwinds which blow within the range and during the existence of the\r\ntrade-winds or the presence of the dry belt--for the trades are not always\r\nperceptible on the land. Captain Fitzroy thus describes the sea breezes of\r\nthe western coast of Peru, at 23 deg. south latitude. \"The tops of the hills\r\non the coast of Peru are frequently covered with heavy clouds. The\r\nprevailing winds are from S. S. E. to S. W., seldom stronger than a fresh\r\nbreeze, and often very slight. _Sometimes during the summer, for three or\r\nfour successive days, there is not a breath of wind, the sky is\r\nbeautifully clear, with a nearly vertical sun._ On the days that a sea\r\nbreeze sets in, it generally commences about ten in the morning, then\r\nlight and variable, but gradually increasing till one or two in the\r\nafternoon. From that time a steady breeze prevails till near sunset, when\r\nit begins to die away, and soon after the sun is down there is a calm.\r\nAbout eight or nine in the evening _light winds_ come off the land, and\r\ncontinue till sun-rise, when it again becomes calm until the sea breeze\r\nsets in as before.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this further, I take the following letter from Professor\r\nEspy's Philosophy of Storms:\r\n\r\n     CLINTON HOTEL, N. Y., Dec. 20, 1839.\r\n\r\n     TO PROFESSOR ESPY,\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--Understanding you are desirous of collecting curious\r\n     meteorological facts, I take the liberty of communicating to you what\r\n     I saw in the month of December, 1815, at the Island of Owhyhee. I lay\r\n     at that island in the Cavrico Bay,[3] in which Captain Cook was\r\n     killed, three weeks, and every day during that time, very soon after\r\n     the sea breeze set in, say about nine o'clock, a cloud began to form\r\n     round the lofty conical mountain in that island, in the form of a\r\n     ring, as the wooden horizon surrounds the terrestrial artificial\r\n     globe, and it soon began to rain in torrents, and continued through\r\n     the day. In the evening the sea breeze died away and the rain ceased,\r\n     and the cloud soon disappeared, and it remained entirely clear till\r\n     after the sea breeze set in next morning. The land breeze prevailed\r\n     during the night, and was so cool as to render fires pleasant to the\r\n     natives, which I observed they constantly kindled in the evening. I\r\n     was particularly struck with the phenomena of the cloud surrounding\r\n     the mountain, when none was ever seen in any other part of the sky,\r\n     and none then till after the sea breeze set in, in the morning, which\r\n     it did with wonderful regularity. The mountain stood in bold relief,\r\n     and its top could always be seen from where the ship lay, above the\r\n     cloud, even when it was the densest and blackest, with the lightning\r\n     flashing and the thunder rolling, as it did every day. I passed up\r\n     through the cloud once, and I know, therefore, how violently it\r\n     rains, especially at the lower side of the cloud. This rain never\r\n     extends beyond the base of the mountain;[4] and all round the horizon\r\n     there is eternally a cloudless sky. The dews, however, are very\r\n     heavy, and there seems to be no suffering for want of rain. That this\r\n     state of things continues all the year, I have no doubt, from what an\r\n     American, by name Sears, who had spent four years there, told me; he\r\n     had seen no change in regard to the rain.\r\n\r\n     CALEB WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n     Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\nSimilar citations might be made to show that the sea breeze is induced by\r\nthe same cause which forms the clouds over the land--that it is frequently\r\nwanting for three or four days under a vertical sun, and that the land\r\nbreeze blows gently and not with corresponding force where there is no\r\nsurface trade, or where it is deflected, not reversed.\r\n\r\nA succession of showers passing across the country to the north, within\r\none hundred to one hundred and fifty miles, almost always produces a\r\nsoutherly wind to the southward of them. There is more that is peculiar\r\nabout these belts of showers. Although they consist of large\r\nhighly-electrified cumuli, there is a strong tendency to cirro-stratus\r\ncondensation in the lower part of the trade over them; and it is that\r\ncondensation rather than the cumuli, which attracts the surface atmosphere\r\nfrom the south. They would be storms, if the atmosphere had not a\r\nsummer-tropical tendency to showers. There is, too, a tendency in these\r\nbelts to extend to the south, and it is generally, as far as I have\r\nobserved, the extension southerly of those belts, by the formation of new\r\nshowers which terminate the \"hot spells\" or \"heated terms\" of mid-summer.\r\nThe very oppressive and fatal one of the summer of 1853, was, in\r\ncharacter, a type of all--although exceeding them in severity. The first\r\nthree or four days were calm, hot, and smoky--an appearance which attends\r\nall similar periods more or less, refracting the red ray of the light, and\r\ngiving the sun a peculiar dry-weather, red appearance. (This smoky haze is\r\nusually atmospheric, and occasionally seen even in March, although not\r\nunfrequently fires in the woods fill the air with actual smoke, and very\r\nmuch increase it, and when this is so, the odor of the smoke is often\r\nperceptible.) Then we began to have a fresh south-west by south breeze in\r\nthe day-time, hauling to the south-west, and dying away at nightfall. The\r\nnext day, the tendency to condensation and consequent belt of showers\r\nhaving extended further south and approached nearer to us, the S. S. W.\r\nwind blew _fresher_ toward it, and _did not die away at nightfall_. During\r\nthe evening the reflection of the lightning playing upon the tops of the\r\nthunder clouds, just visible at the north (heat-lightning, it is termed,\r\nbecause supposed to be unaccompanied by thunder, but in reality lightning\r\nreflected from clouds at too great a distance for the thunder to be\r\nheard), and the continuance of the southerly wind after nightfall, gave\r\nsure evidence of the coming showers the next day, and an end of the\r\nexcessive heat for that time. So ended both of those long-to-be-remembered\r\n\"heated terms\" of 1853.\r\n\r\nThe same is probably true of the interior of the country every where.\r\nLieutenant Maury, in the course of his investigations, and in order to\r\nascertain the direction of the winds in the Mississippi valley during\r\nrain, addressed a number of gentlemen, and received their replies, which\r\nare published with his wind and current charts. Several answered, among\r\nother things, that, \"whenever the lightning appears to linger at the north\r\nat eventide, rain almost invariably follows speedily; not so in the\r\nsouth.\" Thus it frequently is with us. If, during a hot, dry time, of a\r\nfew days continuance, the lightning so lingers in the evening, and the\r\nwind continues to blow _fresh_ from the southward _after nightfall_,\r\nshowers will generally follow within forty-eight hours, most commonly the\r\nnext day, and a cool N. N. W. or N. W. wind with a favorable change ensue.\r\nSuch, at least, has been the result of my observation for many years.\r\n\r\nIndeed this seems to be the general law in summer in the Mississippi\r\nvalley, where the easterly winds are not so common as with us. To\r\nillustrate this further, I copy from a recent work by T. Bassnett,\r\nentitled the \"Mechanical Theory of Storms,\" two short extracts, showing\r\nthe manner in which belts of showers extend southerly, while progressing\r\nnorth-eastwardly, at Ottawa. The first occurred in August, 1853; the last,\r\nDecember, 1852. The first was a belt of showers; the latter would have\r\nbeen in August, but the lateness of the season changed its character\r\nsomewhat, though not entirely, to a more regular rain, especially toward\r\nthe close.\r\n\r\n     \"AUGUST 6th.--Very fine and clear all day: wind from S. W.; a light\r\n     breeze; 8 P.M. frequent flashes of lightning in the northern sky; 10\r\n     P.M., a _low bank of dense clouds in north_, fringed with cirri,\r\n     visible during the flash of the lightning; 12 P.M., same continues.\r\n\r\n     \"7th.--very fine and clear morning; wind S. W. moderate; noon, clouds\r\n     accumulating in the northern half of the sky; _wind fresher_, _S.\r\n     W._; 3 P.M., a clap of thunder over head, and black cumuli in west,\r\n     north, and east; 4 P.M., much thunder and scattered showers; six\r\n     miles west rained very heavily; 6 P.M., the heavy clouds passing over\r\n     to the south; 10 P.M., clear again in north.\r\n\r\n     \"8th.--Clear all day; wind the same (S. W.); a hazy bank visible all\r\n     along on _southern horizon_.\r\n\r\n     \"DECEMBER 21st, 1852.--Wind N. E., fine weather.\r\n\r\n     \"22d.--Thick, hazy morning, wind east, much lighter in S.

W., moderate, drizzly day; 10 P.M., wind west, and\r\n     getting clearer.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the showers at the north passed east on the evening of\r\nthe 6th of August; that new showers, taking the same course, originated in\r\nthe north, but more southerly next day, with S. W. wind, and that they\r\npassed east, and others formed successively further south, which passed\r\nover the place of observation late in the afternoon, and that others\r\nformed south and passed east during the night and next day, visible in a\r\nbank on the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nLater or earlier in the spring and autumn, these brisk afternoon\r\nsoutherly winds continuing after nightfall, indicate moderate rains from a\r\nrainy belt extending in a similar manner, without the cumuli and thunder\r\nwhich attend those of mid-summer. I shall recur to this class of showers\r\nand storms when we come to their classification.\r\n\r\nLight surface winds from south-west to west are not often storm-winds, and\r\nare usually those which the trade near the earth draws after it. Sometimes\r\nthe trade seems to draw the surface wind from the S. W. and W. S. W. with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, and some scud a little distance above the earth.\r\nWhen this is so, it will be found that a storm has passed to the north of\r\nus, or a belt of rains is passing north, which may or may not have\r\nsufficient southern extension to reach us. When there have been heavy\r\nstorms at the south in the spring, especially if of snow, the S. W. wind\r\nwhich the trade draws after it, and which comes from the snowy or chilled\r\nsurface, is exceedingly \"raw\"--that is, damp and chilly, although not\r\nthermometrically very cold. Probably every one has noticed these \"_raw_\"\r\nS. W. winds of spring.\r\n\r\nUsually, when storms and showers, which have not a southern lateral\r\nextension, pass off, the trade is very near the earth, and a light S. W.\r\nwind or calm follows for a longer or shorter period. Not unfrequently,\r\nhowever, our N. E. storms terminate with a S. W. wind, shifting suddenly,\r\nperhaps, just at the close of the storm, during what is sometimes called a\r\n\"clearing-off-shower,\" or, more frequently, dying gradually away as a N.\r\nE. wind, and coming out gently from the S. W., following the retreating\r\ncloud of the storm. In such cases it is said to \"clear off warm.\"\r\n\r\nWith us the wind rarely blows from the west, except while slowly hauling\r\nfrom some southerly point to the N. W. It is probably otherwise east of\r\nthe lakes and in some other localities to the north-west.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, and most frequently in March, a W. to W. N. W. wind follows\r\nstorms, and blows with considerable severity, with large irregular,\r\nsqually masses of scud, and sometimes a gale. Such was the character of\r\nthe dry gale which crossed the country, particularly Northern New York, in\r\nMarch, 1854, doing great damage. These westerly winds are always\r\naccompanied by a continued depression of the barometer, and peculiar,\r\nfoggy, scuddy, condensation, and should be distinguished with care from\r\nthe regular and peculiar N. W. wind, as they may be, by the continued\r\ndepression of the barometer, and the character of the scud. They are\r\ndoubtless magnetic storms.\r\n\r\nThe remaining surface wind, the N. W., the genuine Boreas of our climate,\r\nthe invariable fair-weather wind, is one of great interest. It is unique\r\nand peculiar. It is not the left-hand wind of a rotary gale, and has no\r\nimmediate connection with the storm. I have known it blow moderately,\r\nfifteen successive days in winter; rising about ten A.M., and dying away\r\nat nightfall. Occasionally, but very rarely indeed, a light wind exists\r\nfrom the N. W. during a storm, owing probably to a focus of intensity in\r\nrelation to some surface the storm covers, like the focus which exhibits\r\nitself as a clearing-off shower near the close of a storm; but the real\r\nfair-weather Boreas is a different affair altogether. Let us observe with\r\ncare its peculiarities; they are instructive.\r\n\r\n1st. It rarely blows with any considerable force beneath the trade while\r\nthere are storm clouds, or any considerable condensation in it. It does\r\nnot interfere with that reciprocal action which takes place between the\r\ntrade and the earth, during approaching or existing storms. I have\r\nfrequently seen it with its peculiar scud clouds in the N. W., waiting for\r\nthe storm condensation of the trade to pass by, that full of positive\r\nelectricity it might commence its sports; rushing and eddying along the\r\nsurface, licking up the warm, south polar, electric rain, which stood in\r\npools upon the ground, or rose in steamy vapor from the surface, and with\r\nits cool breath dry up the muddy roads as no degree of heat can dry them.\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure (14) shows the appearance of the northern edge of a\r\nstratus storm cloud, passing off E. N. E. at the close of the storm, which\r\nwas \"_clearing off from the north-west_.\" It is from a daguerreotype view,\r\nlooking W. N. W., taken at eight o'clock in the morning, in the fall of\r\nthe year. Near the horizon maybe seen the N. W. scud, forming in the N. W.\r\nwind, which is about to follow the retreating edge of the storm cloud.\r\n\r\nFigure 15 is from a daguerreotype view, taken at eleven o'clock the same\r\nday, when the storm cloud had passed off and its edge remained visible\r\nonly south of the zenith, and the north-east scud had risen up and covered\r\nthe northern half of the sky, and the wind was blowing a gale from that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother view was taken about two P.M. of the same day, when the scud had a\r\nvery dark, gloomy appearance--as _dark_ and _gloomy_ as those of a Mexican\r\nnorther--too dark to represent by a cut.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently in a moist summer season, after a day of showers or rain,\r\nwhich have had an extending formation or lateral extension from north to\r\nsouth, it will commence blowing in the morning, and encourage the\r\nhay-maker with the hope of fine weather. But often before noon, the milky\r\nstratus condensation above with cumuli below, will appear in the trade;\r\nthe N. W. wind die away and variable airs from the east or south appear,\r\nto be followed toward night by an enlargement of the cumuli and showers.\r\nIt rarely, if ever, blows fresh till the storm condensation of the trade\r\nhas passed; or continues to blow after that condensation reappears. When\r\nit commences blowing after a storm, and the northern edge of the storm is\r\nnot over us, we may frequently see the latter low down in the S. E.\r\npassing eastward.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. NORTH VIEW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2d. Its scud are peculiar. Every one, probably, has noticed them. They are\r\ndistinct, more or less disconnected, irregular, with every form between\r\nthose of the easterly scud, cumulus, and stratus, according to the season.\r\nIf large, with _dark under surfaces_; forming _rapidly_ and as _rapidly\r\ndissolving_; rarely dropping any rain, sometimes dropping a flurry of\r\nsnow, in November or March, oftener than at any other period; sailing away\r\nto the S. E., and casting a traveling shadow as they pass on over the\r\nsurface of the earth. Their electricity, particularly when white, is\r\nprobably always positive, as that of all whitish clouds is supposed to be.\r\n\r\n3d. _It is emphatically a surface wind._ The incident storm winds, the N.\r\nE. and S. E., frequently _commence blowing_ under the storm, toward its\r\npoint of greatest intensity, _up near the line of cirro-stratus\r\ncondensation_, evidenced by the running scud; or blow there with most\r\nrapidity, and so continue for hours before the whole surface atmosphere\r\nfrom thence to the earth becomes involved in the movement; and sometimes\r\nwithout being felt below at all. Not so with the N. W. wind; it _begins at\r\nthe surface_ and blows there with more rapidity than above; it seems to be\r\nattracted by the earth; it interposes between the earth and the trade,\r\nwedging the trade up and occupying its place. It blows under at all\r\nseasons of the year, but most readily and strongly from a surface of snow\r\nwhose electricity is always positive. Hence it blows most strongly and\r\n_continuously_ when snow has fallen at the north, and prevails during\r\nwinter very much in proportion to the extent and continuance of the\r\ncovering of snow which invests the earth in that direction. It follows\r\nafter storms, and particularly warm rains, during the autumn, winter, and\r\nspring months, which have a lateral southern extension. Whether it is\r\nincreased by the snow from the surface from which it blows, or is caused\r\nby the same magnetic action which causes the great fall of snow, is a\r\nquestion we shall consider hereafter.\r\n\r\n4th. It does not connect or mingle with the trade current in any way, or\r\nchange or divert the course of that current; but interposes between it and\r\nthe earth, elevating the trade in proportion to its own volume, above the\r\ninfluences of the earth (when the trade becomes free from condensation,\r\nand singularly, clear); and raising _proportionately_ the barometer. An\r\nexperienced observer can frequently estimate, with considerable accuracy,\r\nthe rise of the barometer, by measuring with his eye, (when the clouds\r\nwill enable him to do so,) the depth of this interposed N. W. current. The\r\nbarometer rarely rises after a storm, for twenty-four or forty-eight hours\r\nif the wind continues at any point from S. W. to W. N. W., but always\r\nrapidly as soon as the genuine N. W. current with any considerable depth\r\ninterposes and elevates the trade.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious to every one, I think, certainly, if they will\r\nhereafter study the subject and observe for themselves, that the N. W.\r\nwind does not blow away the storm; and that it follows after it, blowing\r\nover the surface which is uncovered by the storm; rarely, if ever, with\r\nany force when the body of the storm passed south of us; and that it is a\r\npurely surface wind, seemingly attracted by the peculiar magneto-electric\r\nstate in which the surface of the earth is left, compared with a snow-clad\r\nsurface to the north, by a recent storm, or that peculiar state of the\r\ntrade which is left by the action of the storm. It seems to follow that\r\nmagnetic wave which, passing from north to south, acts in its course upon\r\nthe counter-trade, producing the storm, or belt of showers, and giving\r\nthem their southern lateral extension, and will well repay future\r\ntelegraphic investigation. Its electricity is intensely positive--that of\r\nthe earth by the action of the storm as intensely negative.\r\n\r\n5th. This N. W. wind occurs in all parts of the northern hemisphere, so\r\nfar as we have data to determine, and its corresponding wind from the S.\r\nW. occurs in the southern hemisphere. It is identical with a class of the\r\nnorthers of the Gulf of Mexico, as a brief analysis of the character of\r\nthe latter will show.\r\n\r\n1st. The fall and winter _norther_ is a dry wind without rain or falling\r\nweather--so is our N. W. wind.\r\n\r\n2d. It is preceded by a falling barometer; S. E. scud and rain at the\r\npoint where it blows, or to the eastward of it. So is ours when it blows a\r\ngale in the fall and spring months, which bear the nearest resemblance in\r\nclimatic character to the periods when the northers blow. With this\r\ndistinction, however, that our precedent rains either pass over us or to\r\nthe southward, the direction of storms being E. N. E.; their precedent\r\nstorms passing over or to the eastward of them as they move more to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n3d. It is often preceded by a copious dew; so is ours--such dews often\r\nfollowing light fall rains in our climate, and preceding N. W. wind.\r\n\r\n4th. The most peculiar characteristic, however, is that the barometer\r\nrises rapidly and invariably while the norther prevails, and very much in\r\nproportion to its violence. The same is true of our genuine N. W. wind,\r\nand is not true _of any other wind_ on this continent which I have\r\nobserved or read of.\r\n\r\n5th. While they are thus alike in these respects, they are unlike in no\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield has traced them in _supposed_ connection with storms which\r\ncontinue from that vicinity across the United States to the E. N. E., and\r\nendeavored to connect them with those storms, as the left-hand winds of a\r\nrotary gale. Obviously, I think, they are identical with our N. W. winds\r\nwhich also _follow_, indeed, but _are distinct from the storms_.\r\n\r\nThere are a class of northers in the Gulf of Mexico--the \"Nortes del Muero\r\nColorado\"--sometimes occurring in the summer months, beginning at N. E.,\r\nveering about and settling at N. N. W., and as they decline hauling round\r\nby the west to the southward. These winds correspond precisely with the\r\nhurricane winds of the West Indies, and are doubtless the incident winds\r\nof a storm traveling thence to the N. N. W. precisely as our N. E. or E.\r\nN. E gales are incident storm winds to the N. E. storms of our latitude.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we will look at the peculiarities of a West India\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a little remarkable,\" says Mr. Espy, speaking of the storms and\r\nhurricanes of the West Indies, \"that all these storms, and _all others\r\nwhich have been traced to the West Indies_, traveled N. W. almost at right\r\nangles to the direction of the trade-wind in those latitudes, but very\r\nnearly, if not exactly, in the direction of an upper current of the air\r\nknown to exist there toward the N. W.\" Substantially the same facts have\r\nbeen repeated by Mr. Redfield, and demonstrated by his able\r\ninvestigations, both there and in the Eastern Pacific, and are confirmed\r\nby the observations of Edwards, Lawson, and others, while residents there.\r\nIt is a matter of surprise that gentlemen like Messrs. Redfield and Espy,\r\nwho have certainly displayed great ability in the investigations of\r\nmeteorological phenomena, should fail to recognize a more intimate\r\nrelation between this upper current and the storms they were\r\ninvestigating, and to detect the general laws which govern both. The\r\nstorms and hurricanes of the West Indies are comparatively of small\r\ndiameter, and have little advance condensation. When they pass on to the\r\nsouth-western portion of North America and curve to the N. E., as they\r\nfrequently do, they enlarge in front and at the sides, and their advance\r\ncondensation, which is not dense enough to drop rain, extends in some\r\ncases from one to three hundred miles; and the storm itself, by the time\r\nit reaches the Alleghanies, may extend one thousand to fifteen hundred\r\nmiles, and perhaps in certain magnetic states of the surface, and\r\noccasionally, may cover the entire portion of the continent, from north to\r\nsouth. Such, probably, was very nearly the extension of the storm\r\ninvestigated by Professor Loomis. In the West Indies, however, at the\r\ncommencement, they vary from twenty to one hundred miles, or possibly\r\nmore, in width.\r\n\r\nFirst, they are preceded by a hot, sultry and oppressive atmosphere--_as\r\nare electric storms every where_--a peculiar electric state of the earth\r\nand adjacent air.\r\n\r\nSecond, the black clouds and lightning which indicate the approaching\r\nhurricane are seen to the S., S. E., and E. S. E., according to the season\r\nof the year, as we see them at the westward. During the rainy season, and\r\nwhen the storm, as is usual at that period, is small, and the S. E. trade\r\nblows more eastwardly, the wind at the Windward Islands, possibly, may set\r\nin at the north, and back round by the east as it progresses. So Colonel\r\nReid thinks it sometimes does, at Barbadoes. But when the belt of rains is\r\nsouth, and the hurricane comes from the south-east, and is larger and more\r\nviolent in its action, and the north-east winds prevail, the first effect\r\nis an increase of these trades. Soon, however, the wind hauls to the north\r\nand north-west, in opposition to its course, bearing the same relation to\r\nit that our east and north-east winds bear to storms in the United States;\r\nand the wind hauls around during the passage of the storm to the west,\r\nsouth-west, and south-east, and at the latter point it clears off. Mr.\r\nEdwards in his History of Jamaica says--and as a resident, his authority\r\nshould be decisive as to this Island--\"_that all hurricanes begin from the\r\nnorth_, veer back to the W. N. W., W., and S. S. W., and when they get\r\naround to the S. E. the foul weather breaks up.\" Doubtless the same is\r\ntrue of the class of northers of which we are speaking on the Gulf of\r\nMexico. _But with this class the barometer does not rise during the gale,\r\nand in proportion to its length and violence._ With the other class of N.\r\nW. winds--the northers of winter--it does.\r\n\r\nThe following description of two winter northers, copied from Colonel\r\nReid's valuable work, will illustrate what has been said. _Precisely such\r\nchanges from S. E. rains to N. W. winds, with blue sky and detached dark\r\nclouds--fair-weather N. W. scud--occur every autumn in October and\r\nNovember_, and the falling of the thermometer and rising of the barometer,\r\nafter rain, and a change of the wind, are perfectly characteristic.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   1843.  |   Wind.    |Force.|Weather.| Bar.|Ther.|\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Jan. 30.|            |      |        |     |     |\r\n  A.M. 4. |S.

On the 30th January, with a rising thermometer and falling\r\nbarometer, there was rain at midday. The night following was moist--the\r\nnext day, about ten A.M., the wind came out N. W., with squalls and gloomy\r\nweather, a falling thermometer, and rising barometer.\r\n\r\nThe norther of Feb. 14th differed from the other only in regard to the\r\ntime of the day when it commenced; the order of events was the same. The\r\nrain fell in the night--it cleared off early in the day, and the norther\r\nfollowed in the afternoon. This also is frequently the case with us, as\r\nevery one may observe.\r\n\r\nThis brief notice of the surface winds of our climate would be incomplete\r\nwithout a description of those of the thunder-gust and tornado.\r\n\r\nThe former is exceedingly simple. The showers, which are accompanied with\r\nmuch wind, form suddenly in hot weather, and have a considerable advance\r\ncondensation (frequently with obvious lateral internal action), extending\r\neastwardly from the line of smooth cloud from which the rain is falling,\r\nor rather where the falling rain obscures the inequalities of the cloud.\r\n_The gust is never felt until the advancing condensation has passed over\r\nus_, when it takes the place of the gentle easterly breeze which\r\npreviously set toward the shower. _The gust ceases as soon as the cloud\r\nhas passed._ It is obviously the result of the inducing and attracting\r\ninfluence of the cloud upon the atmosphere near the surface of the earth\r\nas it passes over it. Let the reader watch attentively this advance\r\ncondensation, from its eastern edge to the line of smooth cloud and\r\nfalling rain, and he will understand at a glance this internal action of\r\ngust-clouds. The whole phenomena are simple and intelligible. A cloud\r\napproaching from a westerly point, dark and irregular from its eastern\r\nedge to the line of falling rain, where it appears smooth and of a light\r\ncolor; wind from the east blowing gently toward it, till the condensation\r\nis over us; then the gust following the cloud; then the rain, and in a few\r\nminutes the cloud, and wind, and rain have passed on to the east, and\r\n\"sunshine\" returns.\r\n\r\nThe tornado, as it is termed when it occurs upon land, \"spout,\" if on the\r\nwater, is sometimes of a different character, and as it undoubtedly had\r\ngreat influence in inducing the gyrating theory of Mr. Redfield, and the\r\naspiratory theory of Mr. Espy, and has been cited by both in support of\r\ntheir respective theories, it deserves a more particular notice. There are\r\nseveral marked peculiarities attending it which determine its character.\r\n\r\n1st. It occurs during a _peculiarly sultry and electric_ state of the\r\ntrade and surface atmosphere, and at a time when thunder showers are\r\nprevailing in and around the locality, and at every period of the year\r\nwhen such a state of the atmosphere exists. One recently occurred in\r\nBrandon, Ohio, in midwinter.\r\n\r\n2d. There is always a cloud above, but very near the earth, between which\r\nand the earth the tornado forms and rages. It is usually described as a\r\nblack cloud, ranging about 1000 feet or less above the earth, often with\r\na whitish shaped cone projecting from it, and forming a connection with\r\nthe earth; at intervals rising and breaking the connection, and again\r\ndescending and renewing it with devastating energy. Its width at the\r\nsurface varies from forty to one hundred and eighty rods--the most usual\r\nwidth being from sixty to ninety rods. Sometimes when still wider, they\r\nhave more the character of thunder-gusts, and are brightly luminous.\r\n\r\n3d. Two motions are usually visible, one ascending one near the earth and\r\nin the middle, and a gyratory one around the other. The latter is rarely\r\nfelt, or its effects observed, near the earth. Occasionally, and at\r\nintervals, objects are thrown obliquely backward by it.\r\n\r\n4th. It is composed, at the surface of the earth, of _two lateral\r\ncurrents_, a northerly and southerly one, varying in direction, but\r\nnormally at right angles in most cases, although not always, with its\r\ncourse of progression, extending from the extreme limits of its track to\r\nthe axis; which currents are most distinctly defined toward the center,\r\nand upward. These currents prostrate trees, or elevate and remove every\r\nthing in their way which is detached and movable. There does not seem to\r\nbe any current in advance of these lateral ones tending toward the\r\ntornado, save in rare and excepted cases, and then owing to the make of\r\nthe ground or the irregular action of the currents; nor any following,\r\nexcept that made by the curving of the lateral currents toward the center\r\nof the spout as it moves on, and perhaps a tendency of the air to follow\r\nand supply the place of that which has been carried upward and forward,\r\nlike that of water following the stern of a vessel. The south current is\r\nalways the strongest, and often a little in advance of the other, and\r\ncovers the greatest area. The proportion of the two currents to each other\r\nis much the same that the S. E. trades bear to the N. E. This excess in\r\nvolume and strength of the southerly current will explain the\r\nirregularities in most cases, and the fact that objects are so often\r\n_taken up and carried from the south to the north side_, and so rarely\r\nfrom the north and carried south of the axis. These irregularities are\r\nsuch as attend all violent forces, and something can be found which will\r\nfavor almost any theory; but the two lateral currents appear always to be\r\nthe principal actors, except, perhaps, when it widens out and assumes more\r\nthe character of a straightforward gust. See a collection by Professor\r\nLoomis, American Journal of Science, vol. xliii. p. 278.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram is a section of the New Haven tornado, from\r\nProfessor Olmstead's map accompanying his article in the \"American Journal\r\nof Science and Art,\" vol. 37. p. 340.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the main currents flow is shown by their early and\r\nunresisted effect in a cornfield, as represented by the dotted lines. The\r\ndirection in which the fragments of buildings were carried by the greater\r\npower of the southerly currents is shown also. And so is this irregular\r\naction, where a part of the southerly current broke through the northerly\r\none, and prostrated two or three trees backward on the north side of the\r\naxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5th. This cloud, and its spout, move generally with the course of the\r\ncounter-trade in the locality--_i. e._, from some point between S. W. and\r\nW., to the eastward, but occasionally a little south of east, deflected by\r\nthe magnetic wave beneath the belt of showers.\r\n\r\n6th. Several exceedingly instructive particulars have been observed and\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n_a_. _No wind is felt outside of the track_, as those assert who have\r\nstood very near it, and its effects show.\r\n\r\n_b_. The track is often as distinctly marked, where it passed through a\r\nwood, as if the grubbers had been there with their axes to open a path for\r\na rail-road. The branches of the trees, projecting within its limits, are\r\nfound twisted and broken off, or stripped of their leaves, while not a\r\nleaf is disturbed at the distance of a foot or two on the opposite side of\r\nthe tree, and outside of the track.\r\n\r\n_c_. As the spout passes over water, the latter seems to _boil up_ and\r\n_rise to meet it_, and _flow up_ its trunk in a _continued stream_.\r\n\r\n_d_. As it passes over the land, and over buildings, fences, and other\r\nmovable things, they appear to _shoot up_, instantaneously, as it were,\r\ninto the air, and into fragments. If buildings are not destroyed or\r\nremoved, the doors may be burst open _on the leeward side_, and gable ends\r\n_snatched out_, and roofs taken off on the _same side_, while that portion\r\nof the building which is to the windward remains unaffected.\r\n\r\n_e_. Articles of clothing, and other light articles, have been carried out\r\nof buildings through open doors, or chimneys, or holes made in the roofs,\r\nand to a great distance, without _any opening_ being made for the air to\r\n_blow_ in.\r\n\r\n_f_. If there be a discharge of electricity up the spout from the earth,\r\nlike that of lightning, the intense action ceases for a time or entirely.\r\n\r\n_g_. Vegetation in the track is often scorched and killed, and so of the\r\nleaves on one side of a tree, which is within the track, while those on\r\nthe other side, and without the track remain unaffected. (Espy's\r\nPhilosophy of Storms, 359, cited from Peltier.)\r\n\r\n_h_. The active agent whatever it is, has been known to _seize hold of a\r\nchain attached to a plow_ and _draw the plow about, turning the stiff sod\r\nfor a considerable distance_. (See Loomis on the tornado at Stow, Ohio,\r\nAmerican Journal of Science, vol. xxxiii. p. 368.)\r\n\r\n_i_. In passing over ponds, the spout has taken up all the water and fish,\r\nand scattered them in every direction, and to a great distance.\r\n\r\n_j_. The barometer falls very little during the passage of the spout. (See\r\nthe Natchez hurricane of 1827, Espy page 337.) Not more than it\r\n_frequently_ does during gentle showers.\r\n\r\n_k_. Persons have been taken up, carried some distance, and if not\r\nprojected against some object in the way, or some object against them,\r\nhave usually been _set down gently and uninjured_.\r\n\r\n_l_. Buildings which stood upon posts, with a free passage for the air\r\nunder them, although in the path of the tornado, escaped undisturbed.\r\n(Olmstead's account of the New Haven tornado, American Journal of Science,\r\nvol. xxxvii. p 340.)\r\n\r\n_m_. A chisel taken from a chest of tools, and stuck fast in the wall of\r\nthe house. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n_n_. Fowls have had all their feathers stripped from them in an instant\r\nand run about naked but uninjured.[5]\r\n\r\n_o_. Articles of furniture, etc., have been found torn in pieces by\r\nantagonistic forces.\r\n\r\n_p_. Frames taken from looking-glasses without breaking the glass. Nails\r\ndrawn from the roofs of houses without disturbing the tiles.\r\n\r\n_q_. Hinges taken from doors--_mud taken from the bed of a stream_ (the\r\nwater being first removed), and let down on a house covering it\r\ncompletely--a farmer taken up from his wagon and carried thirty rods, his\r\nhorses carried an equal distance in another direction, _the harness\r\nstripped from them_, and the wagon carried off also, _one wheel not found\r\nat all_. (American Journal of Science, vol. xxxvii. p. 93.)\r\n\r\nPieces of timber, boards, and clapboard, driven into the side of a hill,\r\n_as no force of powder could drive them, etc., etc._\r\n\r\nNow to my mind, these circumstances indicate clearly, that it is not wind,\r\n_i. e._, mere currents of air, which produces the effect, but that a\r\n_continuous current_ or _stream of electricity_ from the earth to the\r\ncloud exists, and carries with it from near the earth, such articles as\r\nare movable: That this stream collects from the _northerly_ and\r\n_southerly_ side upon the _magnetic meridian_, in _two currents_ with\r\n_polarity_, which meet in their passage up at the center; curving toward\r\nthe center in the posterior part as the spout moves on, when acting in a\r\nnormal manner, and making the \"_law of curvature_\" observed: That no\r\nconceivable movement of the air alone in such limited spaces could produce\r\nsuch effects; or if so, that no agent but electricity could so move the\r\nair: That the air in a building could not shoot the roof upward, and into\r\nfragments; much less could the air in a cellar by any conceivable force,\r\nbe made to elevate _or shoot up_ the entire house, and its inmates, and\r\ncontents--effects so totally unlike what takes place in gales,\r\nhurricanes, and typhoons: That elastic free air never did nor could take\r\nhold of the plow chain, and plow up the ground; or scorch and kill the\r\nvegetation; or twist the _limbs_ from one side of a tree, while the most\r\ndelicate leaves on the other, and within two or three feet, remained\r\nunaffected and undisturbed; or pick the chickens: That even if the\r\nexpansion of the air could produce these effects--if a sudden vacuum were\r\nproduced--_nothing but currents of electricity could produce the sudden\r\nvacuum_, by removing the air above.\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that atmospheric electricity can and does flow in\r\ncurrents with light, by experiments in relation to the brush discharge,\r\netc. That it may do so without light or disruptive discharge, and in a\r\nstream, or as it is termed, by convection, with the force and effect seen\r\nin the tornado, is perfectly consistent with what we know of it--and it\r\nis, I think clearly evinced that such is the character of the phenomena,\r\nby the fact that a sudden powerful _disruptive_ discharge, _with light, up\r\nthe spout_, produces an instantaneous partial or total suspension of its\r\naction; to be renewed as the cloud passes over _another_ and more highly\r\ncharged _portion_ of the _earth's surface_. Peltier gives instances where\r\nthe spout has been entirely and instantaneously destroyed by such a sudden\r\nand powerful discharge of electricity; marking the spot where it was so\r\ndestroyed by a large hole in the earth, from which the discharge issued.\r\nAnd in fact these tornados are often steadily luminous, and so much so,\r\nwhen they occur in the night, as to enable persons to read without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe lateral inward and upward currents, are accompanied, after they meet\r\nand unite, or seem to unite, by gyratory or circular ones. How are they\r\nproduced? This question can only be answered by analogy. No permanent\r\nimpressions are left by the circular currents, except to a limited extent,\r\nand in occasional instances; and observation of them has been, and must\r\nnecessarily be limited and uncertain. I have witnessed one or two on a\r\nmoderate scale; but owing to the suddenness of their passage, and the\r\nconfusion of the objects taken up, it was difficult to determine what the\r\ncircular currents were. When the southerly current is much the strongest,\r\nit appears sometimes to cross the axis, and curve round the northerly one.\r\nPerhaps this may be all the curving that really takes place, except at the\r\nposterior part of the axis, for evidence of a curving on the south of the\r\naxis is rarely, if ever seen.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, that the main currents unite and form one from the\r\nearth to the cloud, _induced_ circular currents would be in perfect\r\nkeeping with the known laws of electricity. Such currents, and with\r\nmagnetic properties, are always induced by powerful currents of voltaic\r\nelectricity passing through wires. And doubtless _in all cases_ powerful\r\ncurrents of electricity _induce attendant circular currents_. This may\r\naccount for the external gyration of the spout.\r\n\r\nOr it may be that the two lateral currents of air which attend the\r\ncurrents of electricity, do not unite; having opposite polarity, but pass\r\nby and around each other, in connection with the circular magnetic\r\ncurrents. Future observation and perhaps experimental research will\r\ndetermine this. But it may not be accomplished by the present generation;\r\nfor the belief that tornados are mere whirlwinds, produced by the action\r\nof the sun in heating the land, is adhered to, notwithstanding they cross\r\nthe intense magnetic area of Ohio in mid-winter, and seems to be\r\nineradicable.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of different winds vary in different localities. For the\r\nbenefit of those who are curious, I copy a table from an able compilation\r\nby Professor Coffin, published by the Smithsonian Institute, showing the\r\nproportion of the winds at New Haven (the station nearest to me). It will\r\nbe noticed that during the year the N. W. winds blow the greatest number\r\nof days; the S. W. next; the N. E. and S. E. less than either, and about\r\nequal. It may be observed that the two latter bear about the same\r\nproportion to the whole, that our number of cloudy and stormy days,\r\naveraging about ninety, bear to the whole number of days in the year.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Course.| 1804. | 1811. | 1812. | 1813. | Total. |\r\n  |------------------------------------------------|\r\n  | N.    |  143  |  105  |   90  |  111  |   449  |\r\n  | N.

The facts embodied in it will be found to comport with\r\nwhat I have observed and stated. In relation to the proportionate number\r\nof days in the year during which the wind blows from the different points\r\nof the compass at the several stations it is very full and able.\r\n\r\nBut it has cardinal defects. It does not show the _main currents_ of the\r\natmosphere. It treats the surface-winds, which are incidental, as\r\nprincipals. The direction of the main currents is indeed shown frequently\r\nby the mean course of the surface winds, but not uniformly or\r\nintelligibly. Nor does it distinguish between the fair weather and storm\r\nwinds; nor always between the trade winds during their northern transit,\r\nand the variable winds north of the trade-wind region. Hence, the\r\ndeductions derived from it disclose no general system, and sustain no\r\ntheory, although many very important facts appear. Some of these,\r\nProfessor Coffin found it difficult to reconcile with received theories,\r\nor satisfactorily explain. For instance, he found the prevailing winds of\r\nthe United States, in Louisiana and Texas, S. and S. E.; in western\r\nArkansas, and Missouri, southerly, and in Iowa and Wisconsin, S. W.,\r\nforming a curve, and evidently connected together.\r\n\r\nThus, alluding to the winds west of the Mississippi, and between the\r\nparallels of 36 deg. and 60 deg., he says:\r\n\r\n     \"On the American continent, west of the Mississippi, there appears to\r\n     be more diversity in the mean direction of the wind, yet here it is\r\n     westerly at sixteen stations out of twenty, from which observations\r\n     have been obtained. The most peculiar feature in this region, is the\r\n     _line_ of southerly winds on the western borders of Arkansas and\r\n     Missouri. It seems to form a connecting link between the winds of\r\n     this zone and the south-easterly ones that we find south of it; and,\r\n     in some degree, to favor an idea that has been advanced, that there\r\n     is a vast eddy, extending from the western shore of the Gulf of\r\n     Mexico, to the eastern shore of the Atlantic; that the easterly\r\n     trade-winds of the Atlantic Ocean, when they strike the American\r\n     continent, veer northwardly, and then N. E., and thus recross the\r\n     Atlantic, and follow down the coast of Portugal and Africa, till they\r\n     complete the circuit.\"\r\n\r\nThis mean prevalence of the curving winds indicates the course of the\r\nwestern portion of the concentrated counter-trade, of which we have so\r\nfully spoken, and to which that portion owes its rains and fertility.\r\nDoubtless the curve would have been traced somewhat further west, if\r\nobservations had been obtained from more westerly stations.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an eddy, to which Professor Coffin alludes, is of course\r\nunsound; that of a counter-trade, most fully confirmed; the curve\r\ncorresponding with that of the regular rains and fertility as they are\r\nknown to exist.\r\n\r\nProfessor Coffin is a believer in the generally-received theory of\r\nrarefaction, as the cause of all winds. His work is published by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, and the theory is, so far forth, nationalized.\r\nBut he found it very difficult to reconcile all the facts he obtained,\r\nwith the theory, and, possessing a truth-loving mind, he frankly admits\r\nit. Alluding to the prevalence of N. E. winds off the coast of Africa in\r\nthe summer months, as shown by certain numbered wind-roses, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Nos. 81, 83, 86, and 91, have caused me much perplexity. The arrows\r\n     for the warmer months evidently indicate a point of rarefaction\r\n     situated to the _south_ or _south-west_, and yet all the observations\r\n     from which they were computed were taken within a few hundred miles\r\n     of the African coast and desert of Sahara; a region, the annual range\r\n     of whose temperature must be exceedingly great. The only way in which\r\n     I can account for a fact so astonishing, is, by supposing the\r\n     deflecting forces at these numbers to be secondary to the influence\r\n     which we see so strongly marked in Nos. 88, 89, and 90. Let us, then,\r\n     first devote our attention to these.\"\r\n\r\n(We have not space for the map of Professor Coffin, nor is it necessary to\r\ninsert it. The numbers 81, 83, 86, and 91, refer to respective portions of\r\nthe Atlantic, west of Africa, North of the Cape de Verdes, of 5 deg. of\r\nlatitude each, where the N. E. trades are drawing off from the coast. The\r\nNos. 88, 89, and 90 refer to like portions _below_ the Cape de Verde,\r\nwhere the S. W. monsoons are found under the rainy belt; and the\r\nexplanation of the distinguished author is an attempt to account for the\r\nblowing of the trades _from_ Sahara, by supposing them connected with the\r\nmonsoons further south, which seem to blow toward it.)\r\n\r\n     \"The intense heat of the Great Desert rarefies the air exceedingly\r\n     from June to October, inclusive, and hence the arrows of unparalleled\r\n     length (Plate XII.),\" (showing the monsoon winds below the Cape de\r\n     Verdes,) \"pointing toward it during those months, the longest being\r\n     longer than that which represents the most uniform of the\r\n     trade-winds, in the ratio of 104 to 89. The influence of this\r\n     rarefaction is sufficient to curve the powerful current of the\r\n     trade-winds in the manner exhibited on Plate VII. Nos. 89 and 90, and\r\n     to produce the not less remarkable change in No. 88, holding the\r\n     current back and retarding it, so that its progressive motion in the\r\n     _three_ months of July, August, and September united, hardly exceeds\r\n     that during any _one_ of the colder months of the year. But while\r\n     this is so, the trades on the western side of the Atlantic are\r\n     pursuing nearly their regular track, being but slightly affected by\r\n     these influences. As a consequence, the latter must leave, as it\r\n     were, a partial vacuum behind them, which is filled by air flowing in\r\n     from the north-east and south-east. This will account for the seeming\r\n     anomaly of having a somewhat strong deflecting force directed toward\r\n     mid-ocean, in the hottest part of the year, as in the numbers above\r\n     referred to. _And yet it may be very naturally asked, Why does not\r\n     the air from these parts supply the Great Desert directly, instead of\r\n     taking a circuitous route to supply the region that supplies it? A\r\n     question which, I confess, it seems difficult to answer._\"\r\n\r\n(The italicization in the foregoing extract is mine).\r\n\r\nHere the worthy professor finds a fact inconsistent with the theory of\r\nrarefaction--viz.: that the winds blow off shore, and toward mid-ocean,\r\nopposite Sahara, and he is \"perplexed and astonished.\" The theory,\r\nhowever, must be maintained, and one of those modifying hypotheses which\r\nhave made meteorology such a complicated piece of patch-work, must be\r\ninvented; some \"deflecting forces\" found. There is the Great Desert,\r\nbordering upon the ocean, north of the Cape de Verde Islands, for a\r\ndistance of six hundred miles, widening as it extends inland, whose\r\ntemperature, as he says, \"_must be exceedingly great_;\" and doubtless is\r\nso, and yet the air, instead of blowing in upon it in a hurricane, is\r\nactually drawing off from it, and blowing towards the S. W., where the\r\nwater and air do not rise above 84 deg.. Well may he be \"perplexed and\r\nastonished.\"\r\n\r\nTurning south, however, to the distance of five hundred miles or more, he\r\nfinds the S. W. monsoon winds, which in those months blow under the belt\r\nof rains, toward the land, in the direction of, but at a great distance\r\nfrom, Sahara. It is an easy matter to suppose that they reach the Great\r\nDesert and supply its vortex of rarefaction, inasmuch as they blow in a\r\ndirection toward it, and distance is no impediment to supposition.\r\n\r\nThen it is necessary to _suppose_ that the S. E. and N. E. trades, at the\r\nsouth-west, draw so strongly to the westward as to create a partial vacuum\r\nto the S. W. of Sahara, which is filled by the winds which draw off shore,\r\nand then we have the supply brought from the distance of five hundred\r\nmiles or more, by an ascending vortex, which creates a vacuum, and the air\r\nnear the vortex taken away in _another_ direction by a _partial_ vacuum;\r\nand so an ascending _vortex_, which creates a vacuum is supplied from a\r\ndistance, and a _partial vacuum_ at a distance is supplied by the air near\r\nthe perfect vacuum. Such an idea of a supply by a circuitous route, and\r\nsecondary influence, is not very philosophical, to say the least, and\r\nProfessor Coffin feels it; and to the question, Why is it so? which, he\r\nsays, may very naturally be asked, he confesses there is no answer. And\r\nthere would be none, even if his suppositions were based upon facts. But\r\nother questions might be asked equally difficult to be answered, viz.:\r\n\r\n1st. Is there any rarefaction which can draw the trades to the west, and\r\nin that particular locality, in opposition to the supposed vortex of\r\nSahara, by creating a _partial vacuum_?\r\n\r\n2d. Are they in fact so drawn?\r\n\r\n3d. Do the S. W. winds, south of the Cape de Verdes, and _under the rainy\r\nbelt_, which in the summer months extend up to these islands, _reach the\r\ndesert at all_?\r\n\r\nThese are pertinent questions, _and every one of them must be answered in\r\nthe negative_. The hypothesis is without foundation, and Professor's\r\nCoffin's perplexity and astonishment must remain, until he abandons the\r\ntheory of rarefaction entirely. The winds which so perplex him are nothing\r\nbut the regular N. E. trades, made to originate on the coast and continent\r\nof Africa, in summer, by the northern transit of the whole machinery. They\r\nnot only draw off from the desert coast, but they _blow over the desert\r\nitself_ on to the ocean, and into the rainy belt upon the land, as we have\r\nalready seen, and the supposed vortex of rarefaction does not exist.\r\n\r\nThat the monsoons do not reach the desert is demonstrated by the tables of\r\nProfessor Coffin, and to set it at rest we will make the necessary\r\nextracts. Commencing with the region from the equator to 5 deg. N., and from\r\n10 deg. to 55 deg. W. longitude, we have the observed winds in proportion, as\r\nfollows, for July and August--the south-east trades prevailing, inasmuch\r\nas the belt of rains is at this season situated further north.\r\n\r\nLATITUDE 0 deg.

Among these are the northerly tendency, in the\r\nafternoon, of the winds in Ohio, south of Lake Erie; the winds of\r\nsouth-western Asia, which, he says, \"Are so irregular as to defy all\r\nattempts to reduce them to system;\" particularizing the N. W. at\r\nJerusalem, the westerly at Bagdad, the N. E. at Constantinople, the\r\nnortherly at Trebizond, etc., etc. Jerusalem has the Mediterranean at the\r\nN. W., Bagdad has it at the west, Constantinople has the Black Sea at the\r\nN. E., Trebizond N. N. W. and N. E., and the counter-trade, as it passes\r\nover them, draws its storm-surface wind or sea-breeze, from the quarter\r\nwhere evaporation is greatest, and the atmosphere is most susceptible of\r\nelectrical inductive influence. Precisely as it draws from the ocean and\r\nthe eastward, east of the Alleghanies, from the lake region, west of the\r\nlakes, and from the northward, south of the lakes, and from the westward,\r\neast of them.\r\n\r\nThis law of attraction will explain, too, the mean prevalence of easterly\r\nwinds north of the parallel of 60 deg., at the stations named in his work.\r\nGreat Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake, and Fort Enterprise, lie east of the\r\nRocky Mountain range which interposes between them and the Pacific, and\r\nhave Hudson's Bay and other large bodies of water on the east and north.\r\nHence, easterly winds prevail at these places. At Norway House, on\r\nNelson's River, near the north end of Lake Winnipeg, a large body of\r\nwater, which stretches off to the south, we find the south wind the\r\nprevalent one, especially in December, when the northern and north-eastern\r\nwaters are frozen up, and the N. E. largely present at all seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAt New Hernhut, in winter, when Davis' Straits are covered with floes, the\r\nprevailing wind is east, drawn from the warm, open sea east of Greenland,\r\nwhere the Gulf Stream is evaporating. But in June and July, when\r\nevaporation is going on over Davis' Straits and Baffin's Bay, the\r\nprevailing winds are west and south, and the east winds fall off.\r\n\r\nOther stations are equally instructive, but I must forbear.\r\n\r\nIn relation, however, to the easterly zone of wind, of which Professor\r\nCoffin speaks, it should be added that the counter-trade, south of the\r\nmagnetic pole, in high latitudes, pursues an easterly course, is near the\r\nearth, and attracts an opposite wind as it does on the east and north of\r\nthe pole, in localities where the surface atmosphere is not peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to its influence, and, therefore, the _winds are mainly\r\nopposite to its course_. Thus, at Melville Island, they are almost all\r\nwesterly and north-westerly, for there the remnant of the counter-trade is\r\npassing west around the magnetic pole. These westerly and north-westerly\r\nwinds are very light, and like the gentle easterly breeze which sets\r\ntoward the cumulus clouds and summer showers.\r\n\r\nSince most of this work was written, I have procured, and read with great\r\npleasure, Lieutenant Maury's \"Geography of the Sea.\" It is a work of\r\ngreat interest, and should be in the hands of every one. The extent of\r\nground covered, however, made it necessary for Lieutenant Maury to\r\nintroduce much matter not derived from his own investigations. In doing\r\nthis, he has taken received opinions, and has thereby introduced much\r\nheresy. The view he adopts in relation to the monsoons, although the\r\npopular one with philosophers, is of that character. He says (page 222):\r\n\r\n     \"Monsoons are, for the most part, formed of trade-winds. When a\r\n     trade-wind is turned back, or diverted, by over-heated districts,\r\n     from its regular course at stated seasons of the year, it is regarded\r\n     as a monsoon. Thus, the African monsoons of the Atlantic, the\r\n     monsoons of the Gulf of Mexico, and the Central American monsoons of\r\n     the Pacific, are, for the most part, formed of the north-east\r\n     trade-winds, which are turned back to restore the equilibrium which\r\n     the over-heated plains of Africa, Utah, Texas, and New Mexico have\r\n     disturbed. When the monsoons prevail for five months at a time--for\r\n     it takes about a month for them to change and become settled--then\r\n     both they and the trade-winds, of which they are formed, are called\r\n     monsoons.\"\r\n\r\nAgain (Sec. 476-7):\r\n\r\n     \"The agents which produce monsoons reside on the land. These winds\r\n     are caused by the rarefaction of the air over large districts of\r\n     country situated on the polar edge, or near the polar edge, of the\r\n     trade-winds. Thus, the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are caused by the\r\n     intense heat which the rays of a cloudless sun produce, during the\r\n     summer time, upon the Desert of Cobi and the burning plains of\r\n     Central Asia. When the sun is north of the equator, the force of his\r\n     rays, beating down upon these wide and thirsty plains, is such as to\r\n     cause the vast superincumbent body of air to expand and ascend. There\r\n     is, consequently, a rush of air, especially from toward the equator,\r\n     to restore the equilibrium; and, in this case, the force which tends\r\n     to draw the north-east trade-winds back becomes greater than the\r\n     force which is acting to propel them forward. Consequently, they obey\r\n     the stronger power, turn back, and become the famous south-west\r\n     monsoons of the Indian Ocean, which blow from May to September\r\n     inclusive.\r\n\r\n     \"Of course, the vast plains of Asia are not brought up to monsoon\r\n     heat _per saltum_, or in a day. They require time both to be heated\r\n     up to this point and to be cooled down again. Hence, there is a\r\n     conflict for a few weeks about the change of the monsoon, when\r\n     neither the trade wind nor the monsoon force has fairly lost or\r\n     gained the ascendency. This debatable period amounts to about a month\r\n     at each change. So that the monsoons of the Indian Ocean prevail\r\n     really for about five months each way, viz.: from May to September,\r\n     from the south-west, in obedience to the influence of the over-heated\r\n     plains, and from November to March inclusive from the north-east, in\r\n     obedience to the trade-wind force.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the \"trade-wind force\" is, Lieutenant Maury tells us in another\r\nparagraph, viz.: \"Calorific action of the sun and diurnal rotation of the\r\nearth\"--the received calorific theory. I have already shown, I think,\r\nconclusively, that there is no expansion and ascent in the supposed region\r\nof calms, which induces, or can induce, the trades; and that, in point of\r\nfact, the air on the land is cooler under the belt of rains. But as\r\nLieutenant Maury, whose reputation is national, adopts the theory, I shall\r\nbe pardoned for copying the following table, showing the difference of\r\ntemperature at two cities of India, before, after, and while the belt of\r\ninter-tropical rains is over them. It will be seen that the temperature is\r\nactually less when the belt is there, viz., in July and August, than in\r\nApril and May. _This should be conclusive upon that point._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           |    Anjarakandy.    |     Calcutta.     |\r\n  |  Months.  |--------------------|-------------------|\r\n  |           |   Rain.  |  Temp.  |   Rain. |  Temp.  |\r\n  |-----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n  |           |    M.

The\r\nformer is in and near the focus of the monsoons, and has a temperature in\r\nJuly (when 18 inches of rain fall), about as low as in December.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing table from Kaemptz, the rain is in millimetres, about\r\ntwenty-five of which make an inch, and the temperature is centigrade,\r\nwhich may be raised to Fahrenheit by adding four fifths of the quantity\r\nand also 32 deg.--thus, if the height of the centigrade thermometer be 25 deg.,\r\nadd to this four fifths of 25 deg., which is 20 deg., and also 32 deg., the result is\r\n77 deg.. Twenty-five centigrade is therefore equal to seventy-seven\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury is not, and should not be a theorist. He occupies the\r\nposition, in some sort, of a national _investigator_, and, of course, of\r\nnational _instructor_. Opinions which emanate from him, or which are\r\nendorsed by him, should be accurate. Sooner or later that which he has\r\nadopted in relation to the monsoons, and some others, must be abandoned.\r\nIn addition to what has already been said, I wish to call his, and the\r\nreader's attention, to several other facts and considerations in relation\r\nto the monsoons, and particularly those of India.\r\n\r\n1st. The deserts of Cobi and Bucharia, which constitute the \"burning\r\nplains\" of _Central_ Asia, north-east of the Indian Ocean, lie between 38 deg.\r\nand 45 deg. of north latitude, and under the zone of extra-tropical rains.\r\nThey are not wholly rainless. They partake of that saline character which\r\naffects so much of Asia and the western part of this continent. South of\r\nthem, running nearly east and west, are the lofty ranges of the Himmalaya\r\nand Kuenlun Mountains, and the table lands of Thibet. To their saline\r\ncharacter, in part, but mainly to the interposition of these mountain\r\nranges, depriving the counter-trade of moisture, they owe their\r\ncomparative sterility. _If bountifully supplied with rains, this salt\r\nwould doubtless ere this have been washed to the ocean, as it has been\r\nfrom other countries, once as salt as they._ But they have some rain, and\r\nmore or less vegetation, and are not intensely hot. They lie too far\r\nnorth, and are too elevated. Their temperature is not materially different\r\nfrom that of the western, and comparatively desert portions of our own\r\ncountry, and they are utterly incapable of creating a monsoon at the\r\nIndian Ocean, and especially from the long line of Malabar coast, where\r\nthe south-west monsoons are found in most strength. The sterile portions\r\nof Utah, New Mexico, and Texas are alike incapable of such effect upon the\r\natmosphere of Central America and Mexico. These monsoons commence in May,\r\nand prevail until October, and the temperature of the air where they blow\r\nranges with considerable regularity between 76 deg. at night, and 84 deg. at\r\nmid-day, on the Malabar coast, and a trifle lower in Central America.\r\n\r\n     At Fort Fillmore, El Paso, New Mexico, in latitude 32 deg.03, the mean\r\n     temperature for\r\n\r\n                     May        is     68 deg.\r\n                     June       \"      78 deg., 5'\r\n                     July       \"      80 deg., 1'\r\n                     August     \"      83 deg., 8'\r\n                     September  \"      77 deg., 9'\r\n                                       -------\r\n     And for the whole period,         77 deg., 1'\r\n\r\n     At Santa Fe, New Mexico, the mean for\r\n                     May        is     66 deg., 9'\r\n                     June       \"      72 deg., 5'\r\n                     July       \"      75 deg., 3'\r\n                     August     \"      72 deg., 9'\r\n                     September  \"      62 deg., 3'\r\n                                       -------\r\n     And for the whole period,         69 deg., 3'\r\n\r\n     Mean of the two united,           73 deg., 2'\r\n\r\nThe mean of Western Texas is about 2 deg. higher than at Fort Fillmore, and of\r\nUtah not materially different; and the mean of _Central_ Asia between 38 deg.\r\nand 45 deg. does not materially vary from them.\r\n\r\nNow, it is perfectly evident that during May and September the temperature\r\nof Central Asia is far below that of the Indian Ocean and India, and never\r\nmaterially exceeds it. Central Asia is hot, \"burning,\" if you please,\r\ncompared with more elevated, fertile, or better watered territory _in the\r\nsame latitude_, and so it has been characterized; but not so, compared\r\nwith the Indian Ocean, or India, where the sun is vertical. During the\r\ngreater part of the time, therefore, that the monsoons are in full blast,\r\nUtah, Texas, and New Mexico, and Cobi, and the burning plains of Asia, are\r\nfrom 5 deg. to 10 deg. colder than the temperature of the place where the monsoons\r\nare blowing. Would not such a fact be perfectly conclusive in any other\r\nscience except theory-swathed meteorology?\r\n\r\n2d. The theory assumes that the heated air has an ascensive force, which\r\ncauses it to rise and create a vacuum, and this vacuum, by its suction,\r\ndraws in the adjoining air, which immediately ascends. The adjoining air,\r\ndrawn away from its locality, leaves a vacuum, and that is filled by\r\nanother rush from the S. W., and so on, till the Indian Ocean is reached,\r\nand the monsoons are accounted for.\r\n\r\nNow, look at the difficulties:\r\n\r\nThe highest temperature that can be assumed for the air over Cobi, at any\r\ntime, without disregarding facts and analogy, is 100 deg.. What is the\r\nascensive power of an area of atmosphere of 100 deg.? For this we have no\r\nproblem or formula, although problems and formulas abound in the science.\r\nProfessor Espy relied on heated air only to give the storm a _start_. His\r\nmain reliance was on the latent heat supposed to be given out during\r\ncondensation, for his ascensive storm power. But over these \"burning\r\nplains\" there is, according to the theory, no storm or cloud, or\r\ncondensation on which that supposed reliance for expansion can be placed.\r\nWhat, then, is the ascension force of air at 100 deg.? _We ought to know, for\r\nwe sometimes have it as high, or within two or three degrees as high, in\r\nall the eastern and middle States._\r\n\r\nThe monsoons blow at from twenty to twenty-five miles an hour, and\r\nsometimes more. Is that the ascensive force of air at 100 deg.? At 25 miles an\r\nhour it would be 2,200 feet; at 20 miles, 1,760 feet; and at 10 miles, 880\r\nfeet per minute.\r\n\r\nDoes any man believe that either current exists? Why, then, do we not have\r\nour hats taken off, or light objects carried up, or have a monsoon, or, at\r\nleast, have the clouds running up, when we have such elevated\r\ntemperatures. _Nothing of the kind occurs with us._ Our hottest days are\r\ncomparatively still days; and I have seen the cumulus sailing gently to\r\nthe east, horizontally, when the air was at 98 deg.. Why should we be exempt?\r\nIs not our air the same and our heat the same?\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose we grant that the ascensive force is equal to 20 or even 10\r\nmiles an hour, will not the adjoining air hold back somewhat to avoid\r\nleaving behind an entire vacuum? or, will it all voluntarily rush in, and\r\nleave a new complete vacuum? and, if so, why the preference of vacuums by\r\nthe air, and _when, where, and why_, should the _successive vacuums stop_?\r\nNay, would not gravity fill the second vacuum from _above_, rather than\r\nfrom the south-west side? and will not the air incline to rush in, to some\r\nor all these successive vacuums, from some other side than south-west? or,\r\nhave these deserts the power of selecting the quarter from which their\r\nvacuum shall be filled, and of delegating it to succeeding vacuums? Would\r\nit not incline to rush in from the east and west where there are no\r\nelevations, rather than from the S. W. and over the Kuenlun Mountains, the\r\nintervening ridges and valleys of Thibet, the lofty Himmalayas, the extent\r\nof India, and the Ghaut Mountains, from three to four thousand feet high,\r\non its eastern coast? Would it not, at least, _leak in a little_, and\r\nlessen the force with which the vacuums would draw from the far-off Indian\r\nOcean, so that the monsoon could not blow with equal force? or, if Cobi\r\nand its fellow deserts _must_ and _can_ draw from an _ocean_, why not from\r\nthe head of the Arabian Sea, or Bay of Bengal, or the China Sea, which are\r\nnearer, or from the Japan Sea, which is still nearer, or the Yellow Sea,\r\nwhich is close by? Why draw only from under the central belt of rains?\r\nNay, what shall be done with Professor Dove? In a recent article,\r\nrepublished in the American Journal of Science and Art, for January, 1855,\r\nhe says: \"A greatly diminished atmospheric pressure taking place in summer\r\nover the _whole continent_ of Asia must produce an influx from all\r\nsurrounding parts; and thus we have west winds in Europe, north winds in\r\nthe Icy Sea, east winds on the east coast of Asia, and south winds in\r\nIndia. _The monsoon itself becomes, as we see, in this point of view, only\r\na secondary phenomena._\" This looks very like _antagonism_. Who shall we\r\nbelieve?\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose you get one atmosphere from the whole area, raised up by\r\nthe supposed ascensive force, and at the rate of twenty-five, twenty, or\r\neven ten miles an hour, and a new volume drawn in from the south-west,\r\nand _over the mountains_: will it not take a _little time_ for _that_ to\r\n_heat up_? Does it heat so fast as to _keep up the ascensive force_\r\nwithout intermission, at twenty-five, or twenty, or ten miles the hour?\r\nWhat says Mr. Ericsson to this? Can he not arrange with a moderate lens,\r\nto move his engine with the rays of the summer sun? Nay, Lieutenant Maury\r\nsays they can not heat up \"_per saltum_, or in a day.\" But according to a\r\nreasonable calculation, they must heat up the air from 80 deg., or less, to\r\n100 deg., at the rate of 2,000 feet per minute. Heating 2,000 feet in depth,\r\nin the proportion of 20 deg. per minute, night and day, for five months, is\r\n\"_per saltum_\" in a minute, and 1,440 \"_saltums_\" per day!\r\n\r\nAnd further still, the Indian Ocean, from which the monsoons are drawn to\r\nCobi and Central Asia to the N. E., is during those months covered by the\r\nbelt of calms and rains, as heretofore stated; and the S. E. trades\r\nblowing into it are attributed to the suction created by the ascent of\r\nheated air _there_. So, then, the monsoons are blowing away from under the\r\nrainy belt, from 500 to 1000 miles, to Cobi and the burning plains of\r\nAsia, while the ascensive force of that belt is such as to draw the S. E.\r\ntrades toward the very spot, a distance of 1,200 or 1,500 miles, at 20\r\nmiles an hour! What must the ascensive force over Cobi, etc., be, if, as a\r\n\"stronger power,\" it can overcome an ascensive force over the Indian Ocean\r\nsufficient to draw the S. E. trades 1,500 miles, at 20 miles an hour; and,\r\nin addition to the force necessary to resist this central suction, not\r\nonly stop or hold back the N. E. trade, but reverse it and draw it back,\r\nat 20 miles an hour, as a monsoon? Must it not be, at least, double that\r\nof the belt of calms, or the \"great region of expansion,\" as Professor\r\nDove calls it?\r\n\r\nNow, I am irresistibly tempted to ask whether a meteorological theory can\r\nbe too absurd for credence, and whether it would not be as well to endow\r\nthe deserts with ribs and lungs, and a proboscis long enough to reach the\r\nIndian Ocean, and the necessary power of inspiration and expiration? Such\r\na theory would avoid all difficulties, conflict with no more analogies,\r\nand, in my judgment, be as much entitled to credit as the one to which\r\nmeteorologists adhere.\r\n\r\n3d. North of the Malabar coast, in the north-west of India, lies an\r\nextensive desert. West of that is Beloochistan, with its rainless deserts.\r\nFurther west are the rainless deserts of Arabia, and these three,\r\nincluding the Persian deserts further north, cover _as much surface_ as\r\nthe deserts of Cobi and Bucharia--have the sun vertical in part, and\r\nnearly so over the entire surface--_are more intensely hot_, and lie\r\nwithin _one third of the distance_ which intervenes between that desert\r\nand the Indian Ocean off the Malabar coast, with _an open sea and_ no\r\n_mountains between_. Now, look at it. The north-west desert of India, and\r\nthe rainless deserts of Beloochistan and Arabia _reverse no trade_ and\r\n_have no monsoon_, although the Arabian Sea heads right up among them.\r\nThey do not attract one from the Indian Ocean off the Malabar coast,\r\nalthough not more than one third of the distance off, and without such\r\nmountains and table lands intervening as separate that coast from Cobi. It\r\nis said by Lieutenant Maury that the monsoons, \"_obey the stronger\r\nforce_.\" But which is the stronger force? Cobi, not _wholly_ rainless,\r\nlying north of 35 deg., under the zone of extra-tropical rains, with India and\r\nthe Ghauts, the Himmalaya Mountains, the table lands of Thibet, and the\r\nKuenlun Mountains between? or the deserts of India, Beloochistan, and\r\nArabia, _wholly rainless_, and _intensely hot, near by_, and in _open\r\nview_. There can be but one answer to this question. Nothing in the way of\r\ndesert barrenness, or elevated temperature, unless it be those of Sahara,\r\ncan exceed the deserts about the head of the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf.\r\nCertainly those of Cobi can not compare with them; yet the trades blow\r\nsteadily over them, although more northerly there, as every where, near\r\ntheir northern limits, especially on land. Says Hopkins, in his\r\natmospheric changes:\r\n\r\n     \"If any one part of the broad expanse of the continent of Asia could\r\n     be heated so as to draw air from the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean\r\n     during the summer, it would be that part which lies between\r\n     Hindoostan and the Lake of Aral, including the region between the\r\n     Valley of the Oxus and Persia, and the land of this part, unlike\r\n     Hindoostan, is not screened from the sun by thick vapors. But what\r\n     says Burnes respecting the winds of this part? Why, that about the\r\n     latter end of June, though the thermometer was at 103 deg. in the day,\r\n     'In this country a steady wind generally blows from the north.' And\r\n     on the 23d of August, after having passed the Oxus--'The heat of the\r\n     sand rose to 150 deg., and that of the atmosphere exceeded 100 deg., but the\r\n     wind blew steadily, nor do I believe that it would be possible to\r\n     traverse this tract in summer if it ceased to blow. The steady manner\r\n     in which it comes from one direction is remarkable in this inland\r\n     country.' Again--'The air itself was not disturbed but by the usual\r\n     north wind that blows steadily in this desert.' And he has many other\r\n     similar passages.\"\r\n\r\nHere there is a vast tract of country south of 35 deg. which has a temperature\r\noften of 103 deg., and does not reverse the trade and create a monsoon. How\r\nutterly unphilosophical, then, to attribute the monsoons to Cobi because\r\nthey \"obey the stronger force!\" or to attribute them to it at all.\r\n\r\n4th. The monsoons can not be _traced from_ the Malabar coast _to Cobi_.\r\nThey do not exist on the south-west of Cobi and near it, where they should\r\nin greatest force, and there is no connection, in fact, shown between\r\nthem. They do not often extend more than twenty-five miles inland, or to\r\nthe east of the Ghauts. There are no corresponding intervening monsoons\r\ncrossing India to the mountains--none over the mountains and table\r\nlands--none under the northern lee of the mountains--nor, in short, on the\r\nwhole track, nor any S. W. winds except such as naturally belong to the\r\naction of the curving counter-trade.\r\n\r\nFinally, the investigations of Commodore Wilkes on Mauna Loa, a mountain\r\nupon Hawaii, more than 13,000 feet high, and the observations of Professor\r\nWise and other aeronauts are sufficient to put this whole matter of heated\r\nlands and ascent of the atmosphere as the cause of winds, at rest.\r\nCommodore Wilkes was encamped for about _twenty days_ on Pendulum Peak, in\r\nDecember and January 1840. Although not up to the elevation of the\r\ncounter-trade in that latitude, he was above the local clouds which form\r\nover the island during the day, where the sea breezes blow in with as\r\ngreat strength as any where. Indeed, he was on the top of the \"lofty\r\nconical mountain\" to which Caleb Williams alludes in the letter to\r\nProfessor Espy I have quoted, and above the spot where Professor Espy\r\nassumed that the clouds were rising with such force as to induce the\r\nstrong sea breezes of that island. During this time there were two\r\nsnow-storms on Mauna Loa, and they had the wind from the S. W. during the\r\nstorm, as might be expected, looking at the situation of the mountain on\r\nthe western side of the island. These storms moved to the N. W., and were\r\nobserved at the other islands in that direction as rain.\r\n\r\nThe local clouds lay over the island every day, as they do over active\r\nvolcanic islands which are very elevated, although it was the dry season.\r\n_Nothing like an ascent of the clouds or of the currents of air from the\r\nocean was observed._ On the contrary, the clouds formed before the sea\r\nbreezes set in, and the latter blew from the different sides of the island\r\nin under the clouds, and outward again, probably on the opposite side. The\r\nwhole interior of the island is elevated, and its temperature low; and\r\n_there was no elevation of temperature on the high portions of the island\r\nover which the clouds formed, and toward which the winds blew, which could\r\ncreate an upward current_.\r\n\r\n     \"During our stay on the summit, we took much pleasure and interest in\r\n     watching the various movements of the clouds; this day in particular,\r\n     they attracted our attention; the whole island beneath us was\r\n     covered with a dense white mass, in the center of which was the cloud\r\n     of the volcano rising like an immense dome. All was motionless until\r\n     the hour arrived when the sea-breeze set in from the different sides\r\n     of the island; a motion was then seen in the clouds, at the opposite\r\n     extremities, both of which seemed apparently moving toward the same\r\n     center, in undulations, until they became quite compact, and so\r\n     contracted in space as to enable us to see a well defined horizon; at\r\n     the same time there was a wind from the mountain, at right angles,\r\n     that was affecting the mass, and drawing it asunder in the opposite\r\n     direction. The play of these masses was at times in circular orbits,\r\n     as they became influenced alternately by the different forces, until\r\n     the whole was passing to and from the center in every direction,\r\n     assuming every variety of form, shape and motion.\r\n\r\n     \"On other days clouds would approach us from the S. W. when we had a\r\n     strong N. E. trade-wind blowing, coming up with cumulus front,\r\n     reaching the height of about eight thousand feet, spreading\r\n     horizontally, and then dissipating. At times they would be seen lying\r\n     over the island in large horizontal sheets as white as the purest\r\n     snow, with a sky above of the deepest azure blue that fancy can\r\n     depict. I saw nothing in it approaching to blackness at any time.\"\r\n     (Exploring Expedition, vol iv. p. 155).\r\n\r\nHere, in the last paragraph, we have the whole truth disclosed. The N. E.\r\ntrade was blowing on Mauna Loa, 13,000 feet above the sea, and the\r\nsea-breeze blew in on the _leeward side_, its moisture condensing over the\r\nvolcanic island, but without rising _up the mountain_, or _through the\r\nsurface-trade_, or _above 8,000 feet_.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the celebrated aeronaut, Mr. Wise, in the course of more than a\r\nhundred ascensions, some during high wind, and others during rain storms,\r\nnever met with an ascending current, except in a single instance, in the\r\nbody of a hail-cloud, and then there were descending currents also, the\r\nusual intestine motion of hail-cloud with its opposite polarities.\r\n\r\nI copy a description of his passage through the clouds of a rain-storm,\r\nand his floating a long period above them; and there was no ascending\r\ncurrent which disturbed their horizontal repose or progression. The double\r\nlayer is not uncommon--condensation taking place at the connection of the\r\nupper and lower portions of the trades, with the surrounding atmosphere;\r\nor in the trade, and by _induction in the surface atmosphere_ at the same\r\ntime. Such instances are frequently visible, and if his ascensions had\r\nbeen undertaken at other times in stormy weather he would have seen more\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n     \"Before I passed the limits of the borough, a parachute, containing\r\n     an animal, was dropped, which descended fast and steady, and, just as\r\n     it reached the earth, my aerial ship entered a dense black body of\r\n     clouds. Ten minutes were consumed in penetrating this dismal ocean of\r\n     rainy vapor, occasionally meeting with great chasms, ravines, and\r\n     defiles, of different shades of light and darkness. When I emerged\r\n     from this ocean of clouds, a new and wonderfully magnificent scene\r\n     greeted my eyes. A faint sunshine shed its warmth and luster over the\r\n     surface of this vast cloud sea. The balloon rose more rapidly after\r\n     it got above it. Viewing it from an elevation above the surface, I\r\n     discovered it to present the same shape of the earth beneath,\r\n     developing mountains and valleys, corresponding to those on the\r\n     earth's surface. The profile of the cloud-surface was more depressed\r\n     than that on the earth, and, in the distance of the cloud-valley a\r\n     magnificent sight presented itself. Pyramids and castles, rocks and\r\n     reefs, icebergs and ships, towers and domes--every thing belonging to\r\n     the grand and magnificent could be seen in this distant harbor; the\r\n     half-obscured sun shedding his mellow light upon it, gave it a rich\r\n     and dazzling luster. They were really \"castles in the air,\" formed of\r\n     the clouds. Casting my eyes upward, I was astonished in beholding\r\n     another cloud-stratum, far above the lower one; it was what is\r\n     commonly termed a \"mackerel sky,\" the sun faintly shining through it.\r\n     The balloon seemed to be stationary; the clouds above and below\r\n     appeared to be quiescent; the air castles, in the distance, stood to\r\n     their places; silence reigned supreme; it was solemnly sublime.\r\n     Solitary and alone in a mansion of the skies, my very soul swelled\r\n     with emotion; I had no companion to pour out my feelings to. Great\r\n     God, what a scene of grandeur! Such were my thoughts; a reverence for\r\n     the works of nature, an admiration indescribable. The solemn\r\n     grandeur--the very stillness that surrounded me--seemed to make a\r\n     sound of praise.\r\n\r\n     \"This was a scene such that I never beheld one before or after\r\n     exactly like it. Two perfect layers of clouds, one not a mile above\r\n     the earth; the other, about a mile higher; and, between the two, a\r\n     clear atmosphere, in the midst of which the balloon stood quietly in\r\n     space. It was, indeed, a strange sight--a meteorological fact, which\r\n     we cannot possibly see or make ourselves acquainted with, without\r\n     soaring above the surface of the earth.\" (History and Practice of\r\n     Aeronautics, p. 209).\r\n\r\nThis is graphic. Perhaps in relation to the conformity of the upper\r\nsurface of the inferior layer of clouds, to the irregularities of the\r\nearth's surface, he was misled during the enthusiasm of the moment. He is\r\ncertainly mistaken as to the possibility of observing these double layers\r\nfrom the earth; I have seen them in hundreds of instances. But in relation\r\nto the _quiescence_ of the clouds for an hour, and _the entire absence of\r\nascending currents_, he could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the absence of all direct proof to sustain the hypothesis,\r\nthat the heating of the land produces ascending currents, and thereby the\r\nwinds, and especially the monsoons, and in view of all the adverse\r\nevidence, I put it to Lieutenant Maury, and every sincere searcher after\r\nmeteorological truth, whether the theory should not be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe counter-trade of the northern hemisphere ranges at different heights\r\nin different latitudes, in the same latitude at different seasons, and\r\nalso upon different days of the same season; and, like the line of\r\nperpetual snow, has its greatest elevation in the tropics, descending\r\ngradually to the surface of the ocean at the poles. At the northern limit\r\nof the N. E. trades, it does not, ordinarily, approach the earth\r\nsufficiently near for decided reciprocal action. Hence, at that point,\r\nstorms do not often originate; the winds are lighter and more variable,\r\nand calms are more frequent than at any point, except at the meeting and\r\nelevation of the trades, or in the polar regions. Doubtless this state of\r\nthings is increased by the feebler action of north polar magnetism, and\r\nthe irregular action of the longitudinal magnetic currents, evinced by the\r\nirregular, and often, feeble action of the trades, near their extreme\r\nlimits. They are not unfrequently wholly wanting, near the northern limit,\r\nfor several days in succession, and calms and baffling winds are found in\r\ntheir place--another effect of the irregular action of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism, consequent upon the ever-changing transit of central activity\r\nfrom south to north, and from north to south. Upon the islands, however,\r\nand continents, which have elevated mountain peaks and ridges, especially\r\nif of volcanic origin and activity, which approach more nearly the path of\r\nthe counter-trade, a different state of things exists. There, showers and\r\ngusts are frequent. Thus, upon the Sandwich Island, Kauai, the most\r\nnorthern one, which is within the region of the N. E. trade during ten\r\nmonths of the year, and upon its volcanic peaks and elevated table-lands,\r\nand north-easterly from them, over the district of Waioli, rain falls in\r\nabundance during the year, while the coastlines upon other portions of the\r\nisland can not be cultivated without irrigation. (See Wilkes' Exploring\r\nExpedition, vol. iv. pp. 61 and 71; and American Journal of Science and\r\nArt, for May, 1847).\r\n\r\nA like state of things, in degree, may be found upon the Canaries, and the\r\nmore elevated of the West India Islands. The Cape de Verdes are an\r\nexception, and the Christian world are quite often called upon for\r\ncontributions of provisions, to save the inhabitants of these islands from\r\nstarvation. They lie at the northern limit of the equatorial belt, and for\r\na period of two months only (July and August), are supplied with rain. If,\r\nfrom any cause, the belt does not move as far north as usual during any\r\nseason, unbroken drought and famine are sure to overtake them. The islands\r\ncontain some elevated peaks, and are of volcanic origin, but not of\r\npresent volcanic activity, and the counter-trades as they issue from the\r\nequatorial belt at their highest elevation, are too far above them for\r\nreciprocal, influential action. If the islands could be placed 10 deg. further\r\nnorth, we should hear no more of drought or famine from them, and their\r\nquantity of rain and fertility would be not only more permanent, but much\r\nincreased. Superadded to this, is the fact, that at that point the belt of\r\nrains precipitates feebly because the S. E. trade originates upon the\r\nsouthern part of the continent of Africa, and the N. E. mainly, upon the\r\ndesert and the Barbary States--and both are sparingly supplied with\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe same state of things is strikingly obvious upon continents wherever\r\nthe mountains are sufficiently elevated, even within the trade-wind\r\nregion. Thus, in South America, the Andean ranges are of great elevation,\r\nand spurs and table-lands extend from them a considerable distance to the\r\neastward. There, the S. E. and N. E. trades of the Atlantic meet in very\r\nconsiderable volumes, and not only is the equatorial belt much wider than\r\nupon the Atlantic and Pacific, but the counter-trades are met upon the\r\nelevated peaks and mountain-ranges, and showers and storms on their\r\neastern slopes and summits are frequent during the dry season--down even\r\nto the extra-tropical belt. I have already said that it was probable that\r\nthe great elevation of the Andes diverted and turned south a portion of\r\nthe N. E. counter-trade which would otherwise pass over the western coast\r\nof Peru.\r\n\r\nThe report of Lieutenant Herndon, which has come to my notice since that\r\nwas written, states facts which strongly corroborate that opinion. It\r\nseems that the trades and counter-trades actually _bank up_, in their\r\npassage to the westward, against those mountains, and the true elevation\r\nof their eastern slopes can not be barometrically ascertained. (See report\r\nof the Exploration of the Amazon, p. 261). Lieutenant Herndon says:\r\n\r\n     \"I was surprised to find the temperature of boiling water at Egas to\r\n     be but 208 deg. 2', the same within 2' of a degree that it was at a point\r\n     one day's journey below Tingo Maria, which village is several hundred\r\n     miles above the last rapids of the Huallaga river; at Santa Cruz, two\r\n     days above the mouth of the Huallaga, it was 211 deg. 2'; at Nauta, three\r\n     hundred and five miles below this, it was 211 deg. 3'; at Pebas, one\r\n     hundred and seventy miles below Nauta, 211 deg. 1'. I was so much\r\n     surprised at these results that I had put the apparatus away,\r\n     thinking that its indications were valueless; but I was still more\r\n     surprised, upon making the experiment at Egas, to find that the\r\n     temperature of the boiling water had fallen 3 deg. below what it was at\r\n     Santa Cruz, thus giving to Egas an altitude of fifteen hundred feet\r\n     above that village, which is situated more than a thousand miles up\r\n     stream of it. I continued my observations from Egas downward, and\r\n     found a regular increase in the temperature of the boiling water\r\n     until our arrival at Para, where it was 211 deg. 5'.\r\n\r\n     \"From an after-investigation, I am led to believe that the cause of\r\n     this phenomenon arises from the fact that the trade-winds are dammed\r\n     up by the Andes, and that the atmosphere in those parts is, from this\r\n     cause, compressed, and, consequently, heavier than it is further from\r\n     the mountains, though over a less elevated portion of the earth. The\r\n     discovery of this fact has led me to place little reliance in the\r\n     indications of the barometer for elevation, at the eastern foot of\r\n     the Andes. It is reasonable, however, to suppose that this cause\r\n     would no longer operate at Egas, nearly one thousand miles below the\r\n     mouth of the Huallaga.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of Lieutenant Gibbon, is also exceedingly instructive.\r\nSeparating from Lieutenant Herndon at Tarma, upon the Andes, he pursued a\r\nsouthern course, along the eastern slopes of the chain from 11 deg. 30'\r\nsouth, almost to 18 deg. south, at Ohuro, making a journey of about 7 deg. 30' of\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of this journey was over eastern and less elevated\r\nportions of the Andes; but little below, however, the line of perpetual\r\nsnow. Here, during the dry season, he met with frequent showers and fogs\r\nfrom the eastward, but left them as he descended into the plains upon the\r\ntable-land. There he found the dry season more distinctly marked; but\r\noccasional irregularities were found upon the table-lands, as every where\r\nupon corresponding elevations. The S. E. trades, however, were there\r\nobvious, during the dry season, notwithstanding the irregularities. The\r\nrainy season, from December to May, he spent at Cochabamba, and at its\r\nclose he traveled north down the Madeira and its tributaries, to the\r\nAmazon. Although scarcely consistent with my prescribed limits, I can not\r\nforbear making a few extracts. Thus, when on the mountains, east of\r\nHuanvelica, in the N. E. counter-trade, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Our course is to the eastward. The snow-capped mountains are in\r\n     sight to the west. Temperature of a spring 48 deg.; air 44 deg.. Lightning\r\n     flashes all around us; as the wind whirls from _north-east_ to\r\n     south-west, rain and snow-flakes become hail, half the size of peas.\r\n     Thunder roars and echoes through the mountains; the mules hang their\r\n     heads, and travel slowly; the thinly-clad aboriginal walks shivering\r\n     as he drives the train ahead; the dark cumulus cloud seems to wrap\r\n     itself around us.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at the Bombam Post-house, in the focus of change from cirrus to\r\ncumulus, and stratus, and storm:\r\n\r\n     \"The winds are very gentle, and curl the cirrus or hairy clouds in\r\n     most graceful shapes about the hoary-headed Andes, in rich and\r\n     delicate clusters; when the peak is concealed, all but the blue tinge\r\n     below the snow, we see a natural bridal vail. An _easterly wind_\r\n     lifts and turns them to dark, cumulus clouds, settled on the frosty\r\n     crown, like an old man's winter cap; the physiognomical expression is\r\n     that of anger. The change is accompanied by thunder, and seems to\r\n     command all around to clothe themselves for storms. The cold rain\r\n     comes down in _fine drops_ upon us; the day grows darker, and the\r\n     _clouds press close upon the earth_.\"\r\n\r\nDuring an excursion east of Cuzco--\r\n\r\n     \"Turning from the river, we ascend a steep ridge of mountains--the\r\n     eastern range at last. A heavy mist _wafts upward as the winds drive\r\n     it against the side of the Andes_, so that our view is shortened to a\r\n     few hundred yards. We hope the curtain will rise that we may view the\r\n     productions of the tropical valley below; but the mist thickens, and\r\n     the day gets dark with heavy, heaped-up black clouds; a rain-storm\r\n     follows. The grasses are thrifty, and the top of the ridge covered\r\n     with a thick sod. By barometer, we stand eleven thousand one hundred\r\n     feet above the level of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn May following, having spent the rainy season in Cochabamba, he travels\r\nnorth--\r\n\r\n     \"Our route from Tarma to Oruro was south. We traveled ahead of the\r\n     sun. In December, when we arrived in Cochabamba, the sun had just\r\n     passed us. As soon as he did so, the rains descended heavily on this\r\n     side of the ridge; it was impossible to proceed. The roads were\r\n     flooded, the ravines impassable, and the arrieros put off their\r\n     journey until the dry season had commenced. After the sun passed the\r\n     zenith of Cochabamba, and had fairly moved the rain belt after him\r\n     toward the north, then we came out from under shelter, and are now\r\n     walking behind the rain belt in dry weather, while the inhabitants\r\n     are actively employed in tending their crops.\"\r\n\r\nSo on the north of the equatorial belt, along the whole line of the Andes,\r\nup to the northern boundary of the desert valley of the Gila, rain falls\r\non the high mountain-ranges, owing to the contiguity of the counter-trade\r\nand the diversion of showers to the north, along their eastern sides.\r\n\r\nDuring the survey of the boundary line between Mexico and California,\r\netc., by the commission under Mr. Bartlett, it became necessary to find\r\nsome spot where water and grass were abundant, for the head quarters of\r\nthe commission. This was found, and _could only be found_, upon the\r\nMimbres Mountains, at an old abandoned Spanish copper mine, 7,000 or 8,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, surrounded with peaks of still greater\r\nheight. These elevated ranges were within influential distance of the\r\ncounter-trade, and here snow fell in the winter, from the extra-tropical\r\nbelt, and rain, in showers, in summer, at the period of the most northerly\r\nextension of the tropical belt; when fifteen miles off, in the valley, it\r\nwas unbroken drought. Mr. Bartlett thus describes it in his Personal\r\nNarrative:\r\n\r\n     \"We reached this district on the 2d of May. Vegetation was then\r\n     forward, though there had been no rain. But it must be remembered\r\n     that during the winter there is snow, and hence a good deal of\r\n     moisture in the earth when the spring opens. The months of May and\r\n     June were moderately warm. On the third of July the first rain fell.\r\n     It then came in torrents, accompanied by hail, and lasted three or\r\n     four hours. Many of our adobe houses were deluged with water, and the\r\n     mountain-sides exhibited cataracts in every direction. The Arroyo,\r\n     which passes through the village, and which furnishes barely water\r\n     enough for our party and the animals, became so much swollen as to\r\n     render it difficult to cross; and, by the time it had received the\r\n     numerous mountain torrents, which fall into it within a mile from our\r\n     camp, it became impassable for wagons, or even mules. The dry gullies\r\n     became rapid streams, five or six feet deep, and sometimes fifty feet\r\n     or more across. On this day, a party, in coming to the copper mines,\r\n     from the plain below, _where there had been no rain_, found\r\n     themselves suddenly in a region overflowing with water, so that\r\n     their progress was arrested, and they were obliged to wait until the\r\n     flood had subsided. After this we had occasional showers, during the\r\n     months of July and August.\"\r\n\r\nThe location of this mountain station is near the thirty-third degree of\r\nnorth latitude, while the northern limit of the equatorial belt, nowhere,\r\nexcept upon the mountain ranges and table-lands of Mexico, extends above\r\n25 deg..\r\n\r\nThere, for the reason we have been considering, it does extend further\r\nnorth during July and August, in occasional showers, and in the vicinity\r\nof Mount Picacho, Mr. Bartlett met one of its mountain thunder-storms on\r\nthe 13th of July, on his return south through Mexico, in latitude 32 deg., in\r\nthe following year. (Personal Narrative, vol. ii. p. 285). These showers\r\noriginated in strata of counter-trade, which had followed up along the\r\neastern side of the mountains and not from strata which had crossed them\r\nand curved to the eastward, as is shown by the course of progression of\r\nthe showers.\r\n\r\nLet us look, in this connection, at a fact or two of great interest,\r\nthough not directly connected with the point in hand. The southern limit\r\nof the extra-tropical belt in winter, on the Pacific coast of North\r\nAmerica, is in the vicinity of San Diego, at about 32 deg.. In summer, that\r\nlimit is carried up above Astoria, which is in latitude 46 deg. 11'--about\r\n14 deg.--yet New Mexico receives little if any rain in winter in the vicinity\r\nof Albuquerque, but does receive a limited supply of about seven inches in\r\nsummer and autumn, five and a half inches of which falls in June, July,\r\nand August. Albuquerque is in latitude 35 deg. 13', below the southern summer\r\nlimit of the extra-tropical belt, and north of the northern limit of the\r\nequatorial belt. This anomaly is explained by the extension west over\r\nnorthern New Mexico, of the extreme western edge of our concentrated\r\ncounter-trade, by reason of its issuing further west from the equatorial\r\nbelt in its northern extension in the summer months. This western edge, in\r\ncurving to the east, north-east of New Mexico, covers the north-western\r\nStates, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc., and furnishes them that great\r\nexcess of summer precipitation which is a peculiarity of their climate;\r\nand its absence further east in winter, and the very great elevation of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and other ranges over which their ordinary\r\ncounter-trade of that season curves, account for the absence of much\r\nprecipitation and snow there, or over the valley of the Rio Grande in New\r\nMexico, in winter.\r\n\r\nWe may now see, too, why the western coast and the Pacific region of the\r\ncontinent, below 45 deg., are so deficient in moisture. The S. E. trades,\r\nwhich arise from the western portion of the south Atlantic and the\r\ncontinent of South America, which, if it were not for the Andes chain, in\r\ntheir natural course, after passing the equatorial belt, would continue on\r\nto the north-west until they passed the limits of the N. E. trades, and\r\ncurve in upon the western portion of our continent below 45 deg., and supply\r\nit bountifully with rain, are, in part, perhaps, diverted along the\r\neastern side of those mountains to swell the volume of our counter-trade,\r\nand in part pass them, almost exhausted of their supply of moisture by\r\ntheir contiguous reciprocal action. Hence, too, the deficiency of\r\nprecipitation at the base of the Andes, on the western side, and the\r\npeculiar and irregular character of the winds under the western lee of the\r\nAndean range. Baffling airs and bands of calms prevail on this portion of\r\nthe Pacific, except where the mountains fall off, and then there is a\r\nwesterly or south-westerly monsoon under the equatorial belt. Says\r\nLieutenant Maury in his Charts, sixth edition, p. 731:\r\n\r\n     \"The passage, under canvass, from Panama to California, as at present\r\n     made, is the most tedious, uncertain, and vexatious that is known to\r\n     navigators.\r\n\r\n     \"My investigations have been carried far enough to show that at\r\n     certain seasons of the year a vessel bound from Panama to California,\r\n     must cross at least three, at some seasons four, such meetings of\r\n     winds or bands of calms, before she can enter the region of the N. E.\r\n     trades. Hence the tedious passage.\"\r\n\r\nSuch will ever be the state of things on this continent and upon the\r\neastern Pacific, so long as the S. E. counter-trades are compelled to pass\r\nover the mountain chain of South and Central America.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we examine carefully the belt or zone of extra-tropical rains,\r\nwe shall find that the focus of greatest precipitation is considerably\r\nnorth of its southern limit, and that, other things being equal, this\r\nfocus travels north in summer, and gives to higher latitudes their needed\r\nsummer rains. This is very apparent upon the north-western portion of our\r\ncontinent, as the following table will show:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  |                   | Lat.  |Jan.|Feb.|Mar.|Apr.|May.|June.|\r\n  |                   |-------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|\r\n  |San Diego, Cal.    |32 deg. 41'| 0.3| 1.7| 1.1| 0.9| 0.5| 0.0 |\r\n  |San Francisco.     |37 deg. 48'| 1.7| 0.5| 4.4| 2.1| 0.4| 0.0 |\r\n  |Cant., Far W., Cal.|39 deg. 02'| 3.3| 0.6| 6.4| 2.2| 0.9| 0.0 |\r\n  |Astoria, Oregon.   |46 deg. 11'|27.0|10.9| 6.1| 4.4| 5.9| 2.6 |\r\n  |Puget's S'd, Ore.  |47 deg. 07'|11.8| 3.9| 4.7| 4.1| 0.8| 0.6 |\r\n  |Sitka, Russ.

The increased quantities of rain which fall at the focus of\r\nprecipitation there, from Oregon up, are doubtless much enhanced by the\r\nequatorial oceanic current which flows over opposite that part of the\r\ncontinent. A like effect, precisely, is produced in Europe. The quantity\r\nof rain which falls at Bergen, in Norway, being 87-61/100 inches per year,\r\nmore than three times the average for that continent.\r\n\r\nThe difference shown in the foregoing table, between Astoria and Puget's\r\nSound, is owing to the fact that the latter lies in the interior and\r\nwithin the coast range of mountains, while Astoria is situated at the\r\nmouth of the Columbia River, with an open view of the ocean.\r\n\r\nA like comparative increase of precipitation in northern latitudes, in\r\nsummer, is found every where varying according to the local influences\r\nwhich operate in the particular case. Thus,\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      There falls in               |Winter.|Spring.|Summer.|Aut'mn.| Year.\r\n  ---------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------\r\n  Burlington, Vt., lat. 44 deg. 20'    |  5.7  |  7.3  | 11.4  |  9.8  | 33.9\r\n  Albany, N.

On the European continent, and over\r\nwestern Asia, there are 50 deg. of latitude to be supplied with moisture by\r\nthis polar belt of rains. If the focus of precipitation was at its\r\nsouthern border, the counter-trade would be deprived of its moisture at\r\nthat point, and little would reach the more northern portions of the globe\r\nwhich are to be supplied by it. But the movement of the whole machinery\r\ncarries up the southern line from the south boundaries of the Barbary\r\nStates on to the Mediterranean and portions of southern Europe, and the\r\nfocus of precipitation and of near approach of the counter-trade to the\r\nearth, being situated far north of the southern line, is carried up\r\ncorrespondingly, while the combination of the moisture with the atmosphere\r\nby south polar magnetism and electricity, and the gradual descent of the\r\ncounter-trade, enable it to resist, to some extent, the influence of north\r\npolar magnetism and cold, and thus retain portions of its moisture for\r\ndistribution in the polar regions.\r\n\r\n_The elevation of the counter-trade above the earth varies in the same\r\nlatitude with the variations in the phenomena of the weather._ An\r\nattentive observation of the clouds of our climate will soon satisfy any\r\none of this, after he has become familiar with them, so as to distinguish\r\nwith certainty the clouds of the trade. Its range, in this country, is\r\nfrom 3,000 feet, or less, to 12,000 feet above the earth, and its depth\r\nwith us probably, from 6,000 to 8,000 feet. Gay-Lussac, in his scientific\r\nexperimental balloon ascension, the first of _that character_ ever made,\r\nexcept an imperfect one just previous, by himself and Biot, found it at\r\nabout 12,000 feet over Paris, and about 4,000 feet in depth. It is\r\ndetected by the thermometer when much elevated.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere grows cool as it is ascended on mountains, or by balloons.\r\nThe rate of cooling is ordinarily about 1 deg. of Fahrenheit for every 300\r\nfeet. If it were not for the equatorial current, this progressive decrease\r\nof temperature would doubtless be perfectly uniform. Of Gay-Lussac's\r\nascension, on this point it was said:\r\n\r\n     \"At forty minutes after 9 o'clock, on the morning of the 15th\r\n     September, 1804, the scientific voyager ascended, as before, from the\r\n     garden of the repository of models. The barometer then stood at 30.66\r\n     English inches, the thermometer at 82 deg. Fahrenheit, and the hygrometer\r\n     at 57-1/2 deg.. The sky was unclouded, but misty.\r\n\r\n     \"During the whole of this gradual ascent, he noticed, at short\r\n     intervals, the state of the barometer, the thermometer, and the\r\n     hygrometer. Of these observations, amounting in all to twenty-one, he\r\n     has given a tabular view. We regret, however, that he has neglected\r\n     to mark the times at which they were made, since the results appear\r\n     to have been very materially modified by the progress of the day. It\r\n     would likewise have been desirable to have compared them with a\r\n     register, noted every half hour, at the Observatory. From the surface\r\n     of the earth to the height of 12,125 feet, the temperature of the\r\n     atmosphere decreased regularly, from 82 deg. to 47 deg. 3' by Fahrenheit's\r\n     scale; _but afterward it increased again, and reached to 53 deg. 6' at\r\n     the altitude of 14,000 feet_; evidently owing to the influence of the\r\n     warm currents of air which, as the day advanced, rose continually\r\n     from the heated ground. From that point the temperature diminished,\r\n     with only slight deviations from a perfect regularity. At the height\r\n     of 18,636 feet the thermometer subsided to 32 deg. 9', on the verge of\r\n     congelation; but it sunk to 14 deg. 9' at the enormous altitude of 22,912\r\n     feet above Paris, or 23,040 feet above the level of the sea, the\r\n     utmost limit of the balloon's ascent.\"\r\n\r\nThe high range of the barometer indicated a very considerable elevation\r\nof the trade at the time Gay-Lussac made his ascension. I am not aware\r\nthat it has since been found at so great an elevation, in so high a\r\nlatitude, though it is undoubtedly elevated by the interposition of a\r\nlarge volume of N. W. air, upon some occasions, to nearly the same\r\naltitude with us.\r\n\r\nIn the extract in relation to the ascension of Gay-Lussac, we have another\r\nof the thousand hastily-adopted and absurd hypotheses connected with the\r\ncaloric theory. It is obviously and utterly _impossible_ that in addition\r\nto the ordinary accumulation of heat at the surface of the earth \"_as the\r\nday advanced_\"--that is, _during the forenoon_, warm currents should\r\nascend, unobserved by Gay-Lussac during an ascent of 12,000 feet--not\r\n_affecting in the least_ so large an intervening body of the atmosphere or\r\nhis thermometer, and in such immense volumes as to increase the warmth of\r\na stratum of 4,000 feet in depth, an average of 3 deg. of Fahrenheit, and to\r\nthe extent of 6 deg. at the center.\r\n\r\nVery few balloon ascensions have been made with a view to scientific and\r\naccurate observation. But other aeronauts have met the counter-trade at\r\ndifferent altitudes, and in both clear and stormy weather.\r\n\r\nRecently, in 1852, four ascensions were made in England, under the\r\ndirection of the Kew Observatory Committee, of the British Association. I\r\ncopy from the August number of the \"London, Edinburg, and Dublin\r\nMagazine,\" for 1853, the following condensed amount of the result:\r\n\r\n     \"The ascents took place on August 17th, August 26th, October 21st,\r\n     and November 10th, 1852, from the Vauxhall Gardens, with Mr. C.\r\n     Green's large balloon.\r\n\r\n     \"The principal results of the observations may be briefly stated as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Each of the four series of observations shows that the progress of\r\n     the temperature is not regular at all heights, but that at a certain\r\n     height (_varying on different days_) the regular diminution becomes\r\n     arrested, and for the space of about 2,000 feet the temperature\r\n     remains constant, or even increases by a small amount. It afterward\r\n     resumes its downward course, continuing, for the most part, to\r\n     diminish regularly throughout the remainder of the height observed.\r\n     There is thus, in the curves representing the progression of\r\n     temperature with height, an appearance of _dislocation_, always in\r\n     the same direction, but varying in amount from 7 deg. to 12 deg..\r\n\r\n     \"In the first two series, viz.: August 17th and 26th, this peculiar\r\n     interruption of the progress of temperature is strikingly coincident\r\n     with a _large_ and _rapid fall_ in the temperature of the\r\n     _dew-point_. The same is exhibited in a less marked manner on\r\n     November 10th. On October 21st a dense cloud existed at a height of\r\n     about 3,000 feet; the temperature decreased uniformly from the earth\r\n     up to the _lower_ surface of the cloud. When a slight rise commenced,\r\n     the rise continuing through the cloud, and to about 600 feet above\r\n     its upper surface, when the regular descending progression was\r\n     resumed. At a short distance above the cloud, the dew-point fell\r\n     considerably, but the rate of diminution of temperature does not\r\n     appear to have been affected in this instance in the same manner as\r\n     in the other series; the phenomenon so strikingly shown in the other\r\n     three cases being perhaps modified by the existence of moisture in a\r\n     _condensed_ or vesicular form.\r\n\r\n     \"It would appear, on the whole, that about the principal plane of\r\n     condensation heat is developed in the atmosphere, which has the\r\n     effect of raising the temperature of the higher air above what it\r\n     would have been had the rate of decrease continued uniformly from the\r\n     earth upward.\"\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen do not adopt the absurd explanation of the French\r\nphilosophers; they account for the phenomenon by supposing heat to be\r\n_developed_ at that particular part of the atmosphere; but they are\r\nequally wide of the mark. They found the excess of heat there to the\r\nextent of 7 deg. to 12 deg., and on days when there was no condensation, or other\r\nassignable cause for its _development_.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the counter-trade partakes, doubtless, of the\r\ntemperature of the adjoining strata at its upper and lower portion, and\r\nhas never been found much, if any, higher than 60 deg. at the center. Nor\r\ncould it be expected. The trade, in its upward curving course, within the\r\ntropics, attains a considerable altitude where the atmosphere is\r\ncomparatively cold, and necessarily loses a portion of its heat there, and\r\nduring its northern flow. Probably its central summer range, in the\r\nlatitude of Paris, is not far from 55 deg., and with us 60 deg..\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the trade and the surrounding atmosphere, in winter,\r\nis much more striking, and this has been observed particularly upon the\r\nBrocken of the Alps, and in the polar regions.\r\n\r\n\"In all seasons the temperature is higher on the Brocken, on a serene,\r\nthan on a cloudy day, and, in the month of January, _the serene days were\r\nwarmer than at Berlin_.\" (Kaemtz's Meteorology, by Walker, p. 217.--Note.)\r\n\r\nAs the portion of the counter-trade, which does not become depolarized--in\r\ndiminished volume--progresses toward the polar regions, it settles nearer\r\nthe earth, and within the Arctic circle is found but little way above it.\r\nThus, in December, 1821, Parry, at Winter Island, in latitude 66 deg. 11',\r\nflew a kite, with a thermometer attached, to the height of 379 feet, and\r\nfound that the temperature, instead of falling 1-1/4 deg., the usual ratio of\r\ndecrease, rose 3/4 of a degree.\r\n\r\nThe same thing was observed at Spitzbergen, in latitude 77 deg. 30' north, and\r\nat Bosekop, latitude 69 deg. 58', by a scientific commission, and by means of\r\nkites, confined balloons, and the ascent of elevations.\r\n\r\n     \"In winter the temperature goes on increasing with the height, up to\r\n     a certain limit, which is variable, according to the different\r\n     atmospheric circumstances, the influence of which is not yet very\r\n     exactly known. The hour of the day appears to be indifferent, since\r\n     there exists no thermometric diurnal variation in the strata of the\r\n     surface. The mean of thirty-six experiments, made with kites, or with\r\n     captive balloons, at Bosekop, latitude 69 deg. 58' north, has given a\r\n     mean rate of increase of 1 deg. 6' for the first hundred meters.[6]\r\n     Beyond this limit, and even beyond the first 60 or 80 meters, the\r\n     temperature again becomes decreasing, at first very slowly, but\r\n     afterward the decrease is accelerated. The observations that have\r\n     been made on the flanks, or on the summits, of mountains, during the\r\n     same expeditions, entirely confirm these results. The cooling\r\n     influence of a soil, that radiates its own heat for several weeks,\r\n     without receiving any thing on the part of the sun, in compensation\r\n     of its losses, the influence of _counter-currents from above_, coming\r\n     from the west and the south-west, with a high temperature, account\r\n     for this anomaly, which, in winter, represents the normal state of\r\n     the most northern parts of the European continent.\" (Walker's Kaemtz,\r\n     p. 515.--Note.)\r\n\r\nMr. Walker is the only author, so far as I know, who has suspected the\r\ntrue cause of the phenomenon, viz.: \"currents from above coming from the\r\nwest and south-west, with a high temperature;\" but the caloric theory\r\n\"sticks like a burr,\" and he adheres also to the idea that a snow-clad\r\nsurface, in the absence of the sun, can aid, by radiation, in warming the\r\natmosphere for a distance of several hundred yards above it, increasing\r\nthe warmth as the distance from the earth increases!\r\n\r\nThis contrast between the counter-trade and the adjacent atmosphere, in\r\nwinter, in latitudes as low as that of the Brocken, is probably heightened\r\nby the increased warmth of the former, at that season. The S. E. trades\r\nthen form under a vertical sun, and the difference of temperature can not\r\nbe less than from 6 deg. to 8 deg.. Not unfrequently in winter and spring the rain\r\nwill fall with a temperature of 50 deg. to 55 deg., when the atmosphere near the\r\nearth is 10 deg. or 20 deg. or more, below those points; and it is frozen to every\r\nobject upon which it falls. The trade stratum, from which it descends, is\r\nnot warmed by \"radiation\" or by ascending currents from a snow-clad\r\nsurface, and during a cloudy day; nor by a \"development of heat\" at that\r\nparticular altitude, but it has brought its heat from the South Atlantic,\r\nand imparts it to the rain which forms within it. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the counter-trade flows north in a regular descending plane,\r\nnot materially differing from that of the line of perpetual snow. The\r\ndescent of the latter is well ascertained to be from about 16,000 feet at\r\nthe equator, to _the surface_ at the poles. The plane of the counter-trade\r\nis probably much the same, varying over different localities, from the\r\nvaried action between it and the earth which we are considering; and\r\nprobably both correspond with the increase of magnetic intensity.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury, in an able and original article upon the circulation of\r\nthe atmosphere, conceives the bands of comparative calms at the northern\r\nlimits of the trades, which he appropriately terms the \"_Calms of\r\nCancer_,\" to be nodes in the circulation of the atmosphere, and that the\r\nupper or counter-trade here decends and becomes a surface wind from the S.\r\nW., as the N. E. trade is a surface wind; and that an upper current from\r\nthe poles approaches and descends at the same node, to make the N. E.\r\ntrade. But it is evident he adopted that conclusion too hastily, as he\r\nobviously did the conclusion that the calms of the horse latitudes were a\r\ntype of all. We have seen that the latter are increased by a diversion of\r\nthe counter-trade, and that they are avoided by making easting. So it may\r\nbe observed that our upper current is a S. W. current, and no northerly\r\nupper current is visible, or exists over the country, however it may be in\r\nwestern Europe and the North Pacific, on the west of the magnetic poles,\r\nwhere cold, dry northerly and north-easterly winds are found. The origin\r\nand progress of storms withal demonstrates that no such node can exist.\r\n\r\nTwo points have been made in relation to the course of the counter-trade\r\nin the tropics, and are relied upon to show its progress there to the N.\r\nE., which deserve consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is well known that \"rain dust\" falls in\r\nconsiderable quantities on the western coast of Africa, particularly about\r\nthe Cape de Verde Islands, and also upon the Mediterranean and\r\nsouth-western Europe, where it is termed \"sirocco dust.\"\r\n\r\n     \"This dust,\" says Lieutenant Maury, \"when subjected to microscopic\r\n     examination, is found to consist of infusoria and organisms, whose\r\n     _habitat_ (place of abode) is not Africa, but South America, and in\r\n     the S. E. trade-wind region of South America. Professor Ehrenberg has\r\n     examined specimens of sea dust, from the Cape de Verdes and the\r\n     regions thereabout, from Malta, Genoa, Lyons, and the Tyrol, and he\r\n     has found such a similarity among them as would not have been more\r\n     striking had these specimens been all taken from the same pile.\r\n\r\n     \"South American forms he recognizes in all of them; indeed, they are\r\n     the prevailing form in every specimen he has examined.\r\n\r\n     \"It may, I think, be now regarded as an established fact, that there\r\n     is a perpetual upper current of air from South America to north\r\n     Africa, and that the volume of air in these upper currents, which\r\n     flows to the northward, is nearly equal to the volume which flows to\r\n     the southward with the N. E. trade-winds, there can be no doubt,\"\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nNow, it is doubtless true that this dust is transported in a\r\ncounter-trade, and that such dust is found in South America, and is taken\r\nup there by sand-spouts, like those of the ocean in form and action. Both\r\nHumboldt and Gibbon have graphically described them. Yet I do not think\r\nthe point well taken. South-eastward of the Cape de Verdes, where the\r\nsurface-trades--which, becoming counter-trades, pass over these islands,\r\nand, recurving, pass over the Mediterranean and south-western\r\nEurope--should originate, there is a vast extent of unexplored continent\r\nin the same latitude as the portion of South America where the dust is\r\nfound; and the same dry seasons, and the same spouts, in all probability,\r\nexist in both. Until it be shown that such forms have no \"_habitat_\" in\r\ncentral and southern and unexplored Africa, upon the same latitudes as in\r\nSouth America, it may fairly be presumed that the dust is taken up there.\r\nIndeed, the _curve_ upon which this dust is found to fall, in the greatest\r\nquantities, is very remarkable, and corresponds remarkably with the _law\r\nof curvature_ of the counter-trade we have considered, and with the\r\nprogress of a storm upon that coast, and over the Mediterranean,\r\ninvestigated by Colonel Reid. (See Reid, on Storms and Variable Winds, p.\r\n276.) This _curve clearly indicates the origin of the dust in South\r\nAfrica_.\r\n\r\nThe second point is, that ashes from the volcanos of Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica have fallen to the north-east of the place where they were\r\nejected. Mr. Redfield has grouped these instances of volcanic eruption\r\nusually cited, and I copy from him:\r\n\r\n     \"We learn from Humboldt, that in the great eruption of Jorullo, a\r\n     volcano of southern Mexico, which is 2,100 feet above the sea, in\r\n     latitude 18 deg. 45', longitude 161 deg. 30', the roofs of the houses in\r\n     Queretaro, more than 150 miles north, 37 deg. east from the volcano, were\r\n     covered with the volcanic dust. In January, 1845, an eruption took\r\n     place in the volcano of Cosiguina, on the Pacific coast of Central\r\n     America, in latitude 13 deg. north, and having an elevation of 3,800\r\n     feet, the ashes from which fell on the island of Jamaica, distant 730\r\n     miles north, 60 deg. east from the volcano. The elevated currents by\r\n     which volcanic ashes are thus transported are seldom or never of a\r\n     transient or fortuitous character; and these results, therefore,\r\n     afford us one of the best indications of their general course. Thus,\r\n     the progress of the higher portion of the trade-wind was marked by\r\n     the eruption of Tuxtla, latitude 18 deg. 30', longitude 95 deg., which\r\n     covered the houses in Vera Cruz with ashes, at the distance of 80\r\n     miles north, 55 deg. west, and also at Perote, 160 miles north, 60 deg. west.\r\n     The ashes from the volcano, at St. Vincent, which fell at Barbadoes,\r\n     and east of that island, in 1812, mark the course of a current from\r\n     the westward, which appears there at times, in the region of clouds,\r\n     and may, perhaps, be connected with the permanent winds on the\r\n     Pacific coast of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nAs to one of the instances cited in the foregoing paragraph, that of\r\nTuxtla, it may be laid out of the case--the direction conforming\r\nsubstantially to the assumed course of the counter-trade at that point.\r\nSt. Vincent lies W. N. W., or nearly so, of Barbadoes, and a N. W. or\r\nwesterly surface-wind, prior to, and during storms, is common in the West\r\nIndies as the N. E. is here--both alike, blowing in opposition to the\r\nprogressive course of the storm. There is nothing strange or peculiar,\r\ntherefore, respecting that instance, or the existence of variable and\r\nespecially S. W. currents, between the trades, with occasional partial\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nThe falling of the ashes from Cosiguina, upon Jamaica, has long and often\r\nbeen cited, as proof that in the West Indies the prevailing upper currents\r\nrun from the S. W. But it has been ascertained that, _during the same\r\neruption, ashes fell 700 miles to the westward, on the deck of the\r\nConway_, a vessel then upon the Pacific Ocean. That case, therefore, does\r\nnot prove the absence of the S. E. counter-trade at the time, but only the\r\npresence of another, and a different current above or below it--and it may\r\nhave been either, and transient.\r\n\r\nSo of the Jorullo instance. Investigation would probably have shown that\r\nashes fell to the N. W., and that they were carried N. E. by a transient\r\nS. W. wind produced by the existence of a storm to the eastward, or one of\r\nthose states of partial condensation of the counter-trade which often\r\nproduce currents at greater distances without a storm. Not one of these\r\ncases disproves the existence of a S. E. counter-trade, and the invariable\r\nN. W. progression of the storms of those latitudes demonstrates it.\r\n\r\nOccasional anomalous currents, depending upon storm action at considerable\r\ndistance, are found in our atmosphere, and doubtless are there also. Thus,\r\nalthough the N. W. wind is almost invariably a surface wind, I have, in a\r\nfew instances, seen a N. W. set at a considerable elevation, converging\r\ntoward a peculiarly stormy state of atmosphere far south of us, about the\r\nperiod of the spring equinox. And so in one or two instances I think I\r\nhave seen light cirro-stratus clouds _above_ the counter-trade, when it\r\nran very low, setting from the N. E., although the usual and almost\r\ninvariable location of the N. E. wind is below the counter-trade and the\r\nstratus clouds of the storm. Aeronauts, too, have found these secondary\r\ncurrents beneath a serene and cloudless sky. Indeed, the S. E.\r\ncounter-trade doubtless often induces a thin secondary current of S. W.\r\nwind between itself and the surface-trade, in the same manner that similar\r\ncurrents are induced with us, and every where.\r\n\r\nA question arises here of considerable interest, which, I confess, I can\r\nnot answer to my own satisfaction. It is, whether there be, or not, _an\r\neastern progression of the body of the atmosphere above the machinery of\r\ndistribution_. I have thought there was, and that in set fair weather I\r\nhad seen a peculiar kind of cirro-cumulus cloud, in patches, the small\r\ncumuli very distinct and rounded, moving due east, which indicated such a\r\ncurrent. But I am not satisfied, from my own observation, that it is so,\r\nnor is it easy to determine the question. The moisture of evaporation\r\nrarely, if ever, ascends to any considerable elevation, and the upper\r\nstrata must be very dry. Hence, condensation, if it takes place, is thin,\r\nand perhaps often undiscernable. Investigations upon mountains prove\r\nlittle, for the winds of the inferior strata rush up their sides and over\r\nthem. It is an open question, and future observation may solve it. The\r\nprevailing opinion seems to be that there is. If the theory of Oersted, in\r\nrelation to the circular currents of a magnet, be true, there should be\r\nsuch a progression produced by opposite secondary currents, unless,\r\nindeed, it be also true that those currents are inoperative at so great a\r\ndistance, or their influence barely suffices to retain the attenuated\r\natmosphere in its place. Perhaps the investigations of Ampere conflict\r\nwith it. But it is worth while, I think, for philosophers to inquire\r\nwhether the transverse position of the needle upon the wire is not the\r\neffect of the central _longitudinal_ currents, conforming to the circular\r\ncurrents of the wire, and whether it is not owing to the production of the\r\nsame currents in a globe by the circular currents of Ampere, that the\r\nglobe is magnetized, and the needles made to dip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly desirable, in a practical point of view, to understand\r\nthe precise character of the reciprocal action which takes place between\r\nthe earth and the counter-trade, and produces the varied phenomena which\r\nmark our climate. We have seen that the same laws, other things being\r\nequal, operate every where, and that analogies may be sought in the\r\ncharacter of those phenomena elsewhere, under the same, or different,\r\nmodifying circumstances. Looking, therefore, at the magneto-electric\r\nmovable machinery as a whole, and its influence upon the atmospheric\r\ncirculation and conditions, we find many facts which point to a primary\r\naction in the counter-trade, and others that point as significantly to a\r\nprimary local-inducing-action in the earth. Let us briefly review those to\r\nwhich we have alluded, and advert to some others, and see what solution of\r\nthe question they will justify:\r\n\r\nThe belt of inter-tropical rains appears to be, in width, and amount of\r\nprecipitation, and annual travel north and south, proportionate to the\r\nvolume of trades which blow into it, the quantity of moisture they\r\ncontain, and the elevation of the surface over which they meet.\r\n\r\nSouth America is the most thoroughly-watered country within the tropics,\r\nexcept, perhaps, portions of Hindoostan, Burmah, Siam, etc., on\r\nsouth-eastern Asia. The contrast between both, and Africa, as far as\r\nexplored, and as shown by its rivers, is most obvious. The Amazon, alone,\r\ndelivers more water to the ocean than all the rivers of Africa.\r\n\r\nOf the width of the belt of rains over Africa, in the interior, we know\r\nlittle. Its northern extension is less, by from 7 deg. to 10 deg., than the same\r\nbelt over South America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Probably its\r\nsouthern is also. Upon South America, the southern edge is carried down to\r\nCochabamba, in latitude 18 deg., and probably to 25 deg., to the northern edge of\r\nthe coast-desert of Peru, while it is rarely, if ever, found over the\r\nAtlantic below 7 deg., a difference of 12 deg. to 20 deg.. Over South America, too,\r\nthe quantity of water which falls is also vastly in excess of that which\r\nfalls upon the Atlantic. The main cause of these differences is obvious.\r\nThe N. E. counter-trades which blow over Africa, originate on a surface\r\nwhich is rainless, as eastern Sahara, Egypt, Arabia, etc., or subject to a\r\ndry season by the northern ascent of the southern line of the\r\nextra-tropical belt, as the Barbary States, Syria, Persia, etc., and their\r\nsupply of moisture is necessarily scanty. On the south, the S. E. trades\r\noriginate, in part, upon the eastern portion of southern Africa, and, in\r\npart, upon the Indian Ocean, and from the latter source, and a portion of\r\nthe Mediterranean, doubtless most of the water which falls upon Central\r\nAfrica, is derived.\r\n\r\nThe N. E. and S. E. trades which blow into the inter-tropical belt upon\r\nthe eastern portion of the Atlantic, originate upon similar surfaces, and\r\nwith like effect. Thus, the S. E. trades, in summer, are from the Southern\r\nportion of Africa, and the N. E., in part, from the Mediterranean; and, in\r\nwinter, the N. E. from the deserts, Senegambia, Nigritia, etc., and the S.\r\nE., owing to the narrowing of the African continent, mainly from the South\r\nAtlantic and Indian Oceans. Going west, the belt widens, and its range\r\nincreases until the Andes are reached; but under their lee, on the western\r\nside, a totally different state of things is found, and the belt of the\r\ncoast becomes broken and irregular, as we have seen in the citation from\r\nMaury.\r\n\r\nThe width, extension, and excessive precipitation of the belt, over South\r\nAmerica, follow the same law. The South Atlantic widens out by the\r\ntrending of the coast to the S. W., and furnishes a large area for the\r\nunobstructed formation and evaporative action of the S. E. trades. So the\r\ntrending of the coast to the N. W., from 5 deg. south to the northward, opens\r\na large area for a like formation and action of the N. E. trades. No\r\ncorrespondingly favorable circumstances exist any where, except, perhaps,\r\naround Hindoostan, and there the fall of rain is very excessive in some\r\nplaces, as on the Kassaya hills, to the extent of 400 inches per annum. In\r\naddition to this, the magnetic line of no variation, and of greater\r\nintensity, which runs from our magnetic pole, obliquely, S. S. E., to its\r\nopposite and corresponding pole in the southern hemisphere, enters the\r\nAtlantic on the coast of North Carolina, and traverses it, and the eastern\r\nportion of South America, through the whole trade-wind region. The\r\ntable-lands, and slopes, and high mountain peaks, meet the trades\r\nsuccessively, as they go west, and the latter wrench from them, to an\r\nunusual extent, their moisture; depressing the line of perpetual snow, by\r\nan increase of quantity on the eastern sides, several thousand feet, as it\r\nis for a like cause depressed on the southern side of the Himmalayas. On\r\nthe eastern slopes and tops of the Andes, as we have seen, and owing to\r\ntheir elevation, falls the moisture which, according to the working of the\r\nmachinery, and the law of curvature, should bless the coast line of Peru\r\nand northern Chili, the eastern Pacific, northern Mexico, California,\r\nUtah, and New Mexico; and, while the Andes stand, the curse of comparative\r\naridity must rest upon them all.\r\n\r\nSouthern Chili, and western Patagonia are supplied by the N. E. trades,\r\nwhich originate in the West Indies, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean\r\nSea, and the Pacific, off Central America, in the neighborhood of the Bay\r\nof Panama. But there, again, the same effect of elevation is seen. The\r\nmountain slopes of southern Chili and Patagonia are abundantly supplied,\r\nand their mountain ranges are drenched with rain, while eastern Patagonia\r\nand southern Buenos Ayres, under their lee, are comparatively dry. So the\r\nS. E. trades, which originate off the western coast of South America,\r\ncurve in upon, and aided by the oceanic currents, supply, abundantly, the\r\nN. W. coast of this continent, north of California; and there, too, the\r\ncoast, and its elevated ranges, receive, as we have seen, a very large\r\nproportionate supply of their moisture. Substantially, the same state of\r\nthings, as far as circumstances permit, is reproduced upon Malaysia,\r\nHindoostan, etc., and the interposition of arid New Holland upon the\r\nevaporating trade-surface may be distinctly traced upon south-western\r\nAsia. Deserts abound there; the Caspian Sea receives the drainage of a\r\nvery large surface, without an outlet; their southern line of\r\nextra-tropical rains is carried up very far in summer, and their dry\r\nseason is intensely hot. (See an article in the American Journal of\r\nScience, for July, 1846, by Azariah Smith.)\r\n\r\nAnother fact in this connection is worthy of a moment's consideration. The\r\nmagnetic equator, as sought by the dipping needle, is not coincident with\r\nthe geographical one. Humboldt found it, on the Andes, at 7 deg. 1' south, and\r\nit has been found still lower in the Atlantic. Over Africa it rises above\r\nthe geographical equator, and descends again on the Indian Ocean. About\r\nmidway the Pacific, it becomes coincident with the equator of the earth\r\nagain. (See diagram, on page 83.) Perhaps it is not known, with certainty,\r\nwhy this is so. The south pole may be situated nearer the geographical\r\npole than the north one--but this is not believed to be so, nor could it\r\nmake the difference. The greatest southern depression of the magnetic\r\nequator is found where the lines of greatest intensity, and of no\r\nvariation, are found; and at the more intense of these lines exists the\r\ngreatest depression. From this, I think, it may be inferred that the\r\nneedle is affected by the greater magnetic intensity of the northern\r\nhemisphere, to which it may yet appear the obliquity of the earth's axis\r\nis owing. However this may be, or whatever the cause, no marked effect is\r\nproduced upon the trades. The S. E. trades, by reason of the greater\r\nextent of ocean-surface on which they originate, are every where the most\r\nextensive, regular, and forcible. The south polar waters, from which they\r\nrise, are every where trenching upon, and overriding, the north polar\r\nones; and thus, by a most beneficent provision, the greater portion of the\r\nhabitable surface is placed in the northern hemisphere, and the principal\r\nportion of the southern is left open to an extensive, active evaporative\r\naction, which supplies the northern habitable surface with a large excess\r\nof the needed moisture.\r\n\r\nThe condensation, and consequent precipitation, which takes place at the\r\npassing of the trades, as we have already said, over the ocean and\r\nlowlands, takes place mainly in the day-time. Upon the table-lands and\r\nmountain-ranges, it often continues during the evening and night. The\r\nmorning, and early part of the day, however, in tropical countries, are\r\ngenerally fair at all elevations.\r\n\r\nStorms also originate in the equatorial belt, and issuing forth in great\r\nvolume and with great intensity of action, find their way up even within\r\nthe Arctic circle. Those which pass over this continent, or the northern\r\nAtlantic, generally originate in the West Indies, some of them over the\r\nCaribbean Sea, some over the islands, and some over the open ocean to the\r\neast of them; and, nearly all the most violent, during the months of\r\nAugust, September, and October. It would seem most probable that the\r\nprimary action in such cases was in the trades themselves, but it is by no\r\nmeans certain that such is the case. This is the class of storms of which\r\nMr. Redfield has industriously investigated some twenty or more; Mr. Espy\r\nsome, and Lieutenant Porter two. Their course, when very violent, is often\r\nmore directly north than that of storms, however violent, which originate\r\nnorth of the calms of Cancer, owing, perhaps, to their greater\r\nparamagnetic character. This course I have myself observed, in several\r\ninstances, about the period of the autumnal equinox--never, however, more\r\nsoutherly than from S. W. to N. E., on the parallel of 41 deg., except in\r\nthree, and, perhaps, four, instances, when it has been S. W. by S. to N.\r\nE. by N. I know of no class of storms in relation to which the evidence of\r\nprimary action in the counter-trade is stronger than in those of the class\r\nwhich originate on the ocean east of the Windward Islands. But it is not\r\nsatisfactory as to them. Doubtless the conflict of polarities between the\r\npassing trades is sufficient to produce the showers and rains which are\r\nordinarily found over the ocean and lowlands, in the equatorial belt; but\r\nit is doubtful whether it is sufficient to produce such extensive,\r\nlong-continued, and violent action, as that which characterizes the\r\nhurricane autumnal gales.\r\n\r\nThey occur, too, at the time when the whole machinery of distribution has\r\nreversed its course, and is rapidly pursuing its journey south. It is a\r\nperiod of great magnetic disturbance, over both land and sea; of more\r\nactive gales and local-increased precipitation. At the Magnetic\r\nObservatory of Toronto, Canada West, these disturbances are carefully and\r\nsystematically observed, and their maxima, or periods of greatest\r\ndisturbance occur in April and September. (See Silliman's Journal, new\r\nseries, vol. xvii. p. 145.)\r\n\r\nThe tendency to volcanic action is not as great at the autumnal, as at the\r\nvernal equinox, for the reason that most of the volcanic action of the\r\nwestern hemisphere develops itself now upon South rather than North\r\nAmerica. But both exist, and are active, and what are improperly termed\r\nequinoctial storms, and gales, and rains, are proverbial during, or just\r\nsubsequent to, both periods with us--as they are when the same change,\r\ncalled the breaking up of the monsoons, takes place in the line of\r\nmagnetic intensity, over southern and eastern Asia. A volume might be\r\nfilled with extracts, showing, at least, most remarkable coincidences\r\nbetween violent volcanic action and great atmospheric disturbance. Perhaps\r\nthe increased fall of rain at and after the equinoxes, in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and in certain localities subject to volcanic activity, is as\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the register, kept by Mr. Johnson, on the\r\nvolcanic Island of Kauai, one of the Hawaiian group, already alluded to,\r\nas in any other case, although it is by no means a singular one. The\r\ngreatest fall of rain, in any month except April and October, was eight\r\ninches. In April, the fall was fourteen inches, in October, eighteen\r\ninches. Neither the equatorial, nor extra-tropical belt, were over the\r\nisland during those months; but they were the N. E. trades, and the result\r\nwas owing solely to the interposition of high volcanic mountains, _in a\r\nstate of disturbance_, into, or near, the strata of the counter-trade. Mr.\r\nDobson, in stating a theory to which we shall hereafter advert, advances\r\nthe following proposition:\r\n\r\n\"7. _Cyclones (hurricanes) begin in the immediate neighborhood of active\r\nvolcanoes._ The Mauritius cyclones begin near Java; the West Indian, near\r\nthe volcanic series of the Caribbean Islands; those of the Bay of Bengal,\r\nnear the volcanic islands on its eastern shores; the typhoons of the China\r\nSea, near the Philippine Islands, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar stormy state of the atmosphere, over the Gulf Stream, to\r\nwhich I have alluded, certainly affords no evidence of primary atmospheric\r\naction. It is a body of south polar water, pursuing its way under the\r\nguidance of magnetism--maintaining its polarity--arched somewhat like the\r\nroof of a house, by the outward pressure of a cold north polar current\r\nwhich it has met to the east of the Banks of Newfoundland, and forced to\r\ntake an in-shore course to the southward, and the bodies of water which\r\nthe rivers discharge, and a conflict with the north polar surface-winds\r\nwhich sweep over it, and fogs, and thunder, and rain, are a matter of\r\ncourse. Dr. Kane met a portion of this singular current in Baffin's Bay,\r\nnorth of 75 deg., which had preserved its characteristics and a considerable\r\nproportionate excess of heat, although it probably had been around\r\nGreenland, or found its way to the west, toward the magnetic pole, through\r\nsome of its northern fiords or straits. (Grinnel Expedition, p. 120.)\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Lieutenant Maury show, that when the Gulf Stream\r\nturns to the eastward, crossing the lines of declination at right angles,\r\nas the counter-trades also seem to do in the same latitude, it is _carried\r\nup, in summer, several degrees to the north_, and descends again in\r\nwinter--thus demonstrating its connection with the shifting magnetic\r\nmachinery which controls alike the ocean, the atmosphere, and the\r\ntemperature of the earth.[7]\r\n\r\nThere are other irregularities which deserve to be noticed, in this\r\nconnection, although the analogical evidence they afford is far from being\r\ndecisive.\r\n\r\nI have already said that it was within my own observation, that\r\nalternating lines of heat and cold, as well as rain and drought, existed\r\nfrequently, without regard to latitude, following, to some extent, the\r\ncourse of the counter-trade. Such lines have been observed by others.\r\n\r\nThus, Mr. Espy, after describing a snow-storm, which was followed by a\r\nvery cold N. W. wind, of several days' continuance, says:\r\n\r\n     \"This cold air covered the whole country, from Michigan to the\r\n     eastern coast of the United States, till the beginning of the great\r\n     storm of the 26th January; and, what is worthy of particular notice\r\n     is, that _the temperature began to increase first in the north and\r\n     north-west_. On the morning of the 25th, in the north-western parts\r\n     of Pennsylvania, and northern parts of New York, the _thermometer_\r\n     had already _risen in some places 30 deg._, and, in others, _above 40 deg._.\r\n     While in the S. E. corner of Pennsylvania, and in the S. E. corner of\r\n     New York it had not _begun to rise_. The _wind_ also began to change\r\n     from the _north-west_ to _south_ and _south-east_, _first_ in the\r\n     north-west parts of Pennsylvania and New York, some time before it\r\n     commenced in the south-east of those States; and, during the whole of\r\n     the 25th, the thermometer, in the north of New York, continued to\r\n     rise, though the wind was blowing from the southward, where the\r\n     thermometer was many degrees lower.\"\r\n\r\nThus, too, Mr. Redfield (American Journal of Science, November, 1846, p.\r\n329):\r\n\r\n     \"On the contrary, in times of the greatest depression of the\r\n     thermometer, in numerous instances, the cold period has been found to\r\n     have first taken effect in, or near, the tropical latitudes, and the\r\n     Gulf of Mexico, and has thence been propagated toward the eastern\r\n     portions of the United States, in a manner corresponding to the\r\n     observed progression of storms.\"\r\n\r\nThis was because the cold N. W. wind which _followed_ storms began to\r\nfollow them as the storms curved and passed to the N. E.\r\n\r\nThey occur in Europe also. Says Kaemtz:\r\n\r\n     \"Such contrasts are not uncommon in Europe, and, in this respect, the\r\n     Alps form a remarkable limit; for they separate the climates of the\r\n     north of Europe from the Mediterranean climates, where the\r\n     distribution of rain is not the same as in the center of Europe.\r\n     Hence the differences between the climates of the north and south of\r\n     France. _If the winter is mild in the north_, the newspapers are\r\n     filled with the lamentations of the _Italians_ and _Provencals_ at\r\n     the _severity of the cold_.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to indicate a primary action in the counter-trade.\r\nProbably in connection with one class of storms they do, and with another\r\ndo not. I shall endeavor to show the distinction when I come to the\r\nclassification of storms.\r\n\r\nThe difference of seasons in this country, and over the entire northern\r\nhemisphere, is often very great. In a remarkable work of a remarkable\r\nman--\"A Brief History of Epidemic and Pestilential Diseases,\" by Noah\r\nWebster, published in 1799, 2 vols.--a history of the weather for about\r\ntwo centuries--1600 to 1799 inclusive, is given generally, and then in a\r\ntabular form. Those who think that every considerable extreme which occurs\r\nexceeds any thing before known, will do well to consult that work.\r\nDroughts are described, where \"there was not a drop of rain for three or\r\nfour months, and cattle were fed upon the leaves of the trees.\" Winters,\r\nso intensely cold that the thermometer fell to 20 deg. below zero, at\r\nBrandywine; or so mild that there was little frost, and people upon\r\nConnecticut River plowed their fields, and the _peach trees blossomed in\r\nPennsylvania in February_. These extremes generally existed in Europe and\r\nAmerica at the same time, but occasionally they were opposite and\r\nalternate. Says Mr. Webster, in summing up the facts (vol. ii. p. 12): \"It\r\nis to be observed that in some cases a severe winter extends to both\r\nhemispheres, sometimes to one only, and in a few cases to a part of a\r\nhemisphere only. Thus in 1607-8, 1683-4, 1762-3, 1766-7, 1779-80, 1783-4,\r\nthe severity extended to both hemispheres. In 1640-41, 1739-40, and in\r\nother instances, the severe winter in Europe preceded, by one year, a\r\nsimilar winter in America. In a few instances, severe frost takes place in\r\none hemisphere during a series of mild winters in the others; but this is\r\nless common. In general, the severity happens in both hemispheres at once,\r\nor in two winters, in immediate succession; and, as far as this evidence\r\nhas yet appeared, this severity is closely attendant on volcanic\r\ndischarges, with very few exceptions.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Dr. Webster (LL.D. and not M.D., and therefore the\r\nremarkable character of the work) attributes great influence to\r\nearthquakes and volcanic action. Probably he is correct in this. The\r\npresent active volcanic action of the western hemisphere is nearly all\r\nwithin the trade-wind region, from Mexico to Peru inclusive. The West\r\nIndia islands are of volcanic origin, and the influence of volcanic action\r\nis not confined to a concussion of the earth, or the eruption of mud and\r\nlava. Its connection with magnetic action, and disturbance, is\r\nunquestionable. But whether they operate to increase or diminish the\r\ntrades, and the extent to which they induce violent electric action and\r\nstorms within and without the tropics, is a question which further\r\nobservation must determine. The ripples of the ocean, compared by\r\nLieutenant Banvard to that of a \"boiling cauldron, or such as is formed by\r\nwater being forced from under the gate of a mill-pond,\" are met with in\r\nthe vicinity of volcanic islands, where hurricanes and water-spouts\r\noriginate, and have been observed to precede storms, and be connected with\r\na falling barometer. But whether they are volcanic or magneto-electric,\r\nit is difficult to determine. Dr. Webster remarks, as the result of\r\nobservation, during the 17th century, that earthquakes had a N. W. and S.\r\nE. progression in the United States, and especially in New England. In a\r\nrecent article, Professor Dana has examined, with great ability, the\r\ngeneral and remarkable trending of coast lines, groups of islands, and\r\nranges of mountains, from N. E. to S. W. and from N. W. to S. E. (American\r\nJournal of Science, May, 1847.)\r\n\r\nThe line of magnetic intensity, which connects our magnetic pole with its\r\nopposite, is now upon this continent nearly a N. W. and S. E. line, and\r\nthe pole is fast traveling to the west. It may, and probably will yet, be\r\nestablished, that there is an intimate connection between the cause of\r\nvolcanic action within the earth, to which the upheaval of the N. W. and\r\nS. E., and N. E. and S. W. ranges were due, and of magnetic action\r\nwithout, and between both, and the cause of _the S. E. extension_ of our\r\nsummer storms and belts of showers and barometric _waves_, and the\r\n_peculiar N. W. wind_. Our limits do not permit us to pursue the subject.\r\n\r\nMuch influence upon the weather has been attributed to the spots upon the\r\nsun. These spots are supposed to be breaks or openings in the luminous\r\natmosphere or photosphere of the sun, through which its dark nucleus body\r\nis seen. Counselor Schwabe, of Dessau, has made them his study since 1826,\r\nand has arrived at some singular results. They seem to be numerous--in\r\ngroups--and to appear periodically with minima and maxima of ten years.\r\nAs the result of his observations, from 1826 to 1850, he gives us the\r\nfollowing table and remarks:\r\n\r\n     +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n     | Year. | Groups. | Days showing |   Days of    |\r\n     |       |         |   no spots.  | Observation. |\r\n     |-------|---------|--------------|--------------|\r\n     | 1826  |   118   |       22     |     277      |\r\n     | 1827  |   161   |        2     |     273      |\r\n     | 1828  |   225   |        0     |     282      |\r\n     | 1829  |   199   |        0     |     244      |\r\n     | 1830  |   190   |        1     |     217      |\r\n     | 1831  |   149   |        3     |     239      |\r\n     | 1832  |    84   |       49     |     270      |\r\n     | 1833  |    33   |      139     |     267      |\r\n     | 1834  |    51   |      120     |     273      |\r\n     | 1835  |   173   |       18     |     244      |\r\n     | 1836  |   272   |        0     |     200      |\r\n     | 1837  |   333   |        0     |     168      |\r\n     | 1838  |   282   |        0     |     202      |\r\n     | 1839  |   162   |        0     |     205      |\r\n     | 1840  |   152   |        3     |     263      |\r\n     | 1841  |   102   |       15     |     283      |\r\n     | 1842  |    68   |       64     |     307      |\r\n     | 1843  |    34   |      149     |     312      |\r\n     | 1844  |    52   |      111     |     321      |\r\n     | 1845  |   114   |       29     |     332      |\r\n     | 1846  |   157   |        1     |     314      |\r\n     | 1847  |   257   |        0     |     276      |\r\n     | 1848  |   330   |        0     |     278      |\r\n     | 1849  |   238   |        0     |     285      |\r\n     | 1850  |   186   |        2     |     308      |\r\n     +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n     \"I observed large spots, visible to the naked eye, in almost all the\r\n     years not characterized by the minimum; the largest appeared in 1828,\r\n     1829, 1831, 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, 1847, 1848. I regard all spots,\r\n     whose diameter exceeds 50\", as large, and it is only when of such a\r\n     size that they begin to be visible to even the keenest unaided sight.\r\n\r\n     \"The spots are, undoubtedly, closely connected with the formation of\r\n     faculae, for I have often observed faculae, or narben, formed at the\r\n     same points from whence the spots had disappeared, while new solar\r\n     spots were also developed within the faculae. Every spot is surrounded\r\n     by a more or less bright, luminous cloud. I do not think that the\r\n     spots exert any influence on the annual temperature. I register the\r\n     height of the barometer and thermometer three times in the course of\r\n     each day, but the annual mean numbers deduced from their observations\r\n     have not hitherto indicated any appreciable connection between the\r\n     temperature and the number of the spots. Nor, indeed, would any\r\n     importance be due to the apparent indication of such a connection in\r\n     individual cases, unless the results were found to correspond with\r\n     others derived from many different parts of the earth. If the solar\r\n     spots exert any slight influence on our atmosphere, my tables would,\r\n     perhaps, rather tend to show that the years which exhibit _a larger\r\n     number of spots_ had a _smaller number of fine days_ than those\r\n     exhibiting few spots.\"\r\n\r\nThese observations _seem_ to show that the spots exert no influence upon\r\nthe weather, and to be satisfactory. But, perhaps, they are not entirely\r\nso. No effect would, of course, be expected from day to day, and perhaps\r\nthe annual mean may not be seriously disturbed, and yet the spots may\r\nseriously affect the seasons. Popular tradition has fixed upon certain\r\nperiods, of 10, 20, and 40 years, for the return of winters of unusual\r\nseverity; and the tables of Mr. Webster, and other facts, show that it is\r\nnot wholly without foundation. If we, and those we have cited, are not\r\nmistaken in most of the views expressed, the natural effect of a partial\r\ninterception or failure of the sun's rays, by or from the existence of the\r\nspots, would be to decrease the exciting power of the solar rays upon\r\nterrestrial magnetism, and, as a consequence, the volume of the trades and\r\ntheir amount of moisture. This would increase the _mean_ heat of the\r\nsummer in the temperate zone--for the _less_ the volume of trade, the less\r\nprecipitation and variable wind, and succeeding polar waves of cooler air,\r\nand the greater mean heat. On the other hand, the same cause, and the\r\nfeebler heating power of the sun's rays, would make the winters more\r\nsevere, both from an absence of a portion of heat, derived directly from\r\nthe sun's rays, and a less mitigating influence, from the action of the\r\ntrade, by reason of its decreased volume. So, too, the absence of spots,\r\nand a more powerful influence from the solar rays, may gradually carry\r\nthe machinery further north in summer, and further south in winter, and\r\nthus make the _seasons extreme_ without seriously disturbing the mean of\r\nthe year. And both these may occur in a more marked degree over our\r\nintense magnetic area than in Europe. I am satisfied that they do so\r\noccur. That the partial failure of the sun's rays limits the transit of\r\nthe machinery, and the volume of the trades during the latter half of the\r\ndecade, and extends the transit and increases the volume during the first\r\nhalf, producing an occasional severe summer drought and severe winter, in\r\nthe warmest portion of the decade. And that the variations correspond with\r\nthe difference in the character and number of the spots in different\r\ndecades, and hence the longer and shorter periods.\r\n\r\nTurning to the tables of Dr. Webster, we find that a general tendency to\r\nextreme seasons does seem to exist from the 6th to the 10th year of every\r\ndecade, and especially of every alternate decade. The periods of 1707-8,\r\n1728, 1737 and 1739, 1749-50, 1758-9, 1779-80, 1798-9, are those in which\r\nthe tendency was seen most decided. These tables are very general. The\r\nthermometer was not perfected till about 1700, and did not get into\r\ngeneral use before 1750. There were very few meteorological registers\r\nkept, or accessible to Dr. Webster. Hence he was obliged to resort to such\r\nother sources of information as were open to him, and such statements as\r\nhe found are not always entirely reliable. The oldest inhabitant is apt to\r\nexpress himself very strongly respecting present extremes, and fail\r\nsomewhat in his recollection of those which have past. Still his tables\r\nafford general and obvious evidence of the regularity of those periodic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |A.

Hildreth, of the seasons\r\nwhen the Ohio River was closed or obstructed by ice, found in Silliman's\r\nJournal, new series, vol. xiii. p. 238.\r\n\r\nThus, we have, from the tables of Dr. Holyoke, the following annual means,\r\nfrom 1786 to 1825, inclusive. I have arranged them in periods of five\r\nyears. It will be seen that there are three peculiarities observable.\r\nFirst, a marked difference between the first and second periods of the\r\ndecade, corresponding, generally, with the presence or absence of the\r\nspots. Second, a difference in the mean of the decades which may well be\r\nsupposed to correspond with the difference in the number or size of the\r\nspots since a like difference is observable in number and size, and the\r\ntime when they reached their maxima and minima, in the table of Schwabe.\r\nAnd, third, there are occasional single cold years during the warm period,\r\nand these correspond with what the tables of Dr. Webster show for both the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In relation to this, it should be\r\nremembered that volcanic action is a frequent and powerful disturber of\r\nthe regular action of terrestrial magnetism, and that the extremes, for\r\nthat reason, are frequently meridional or local and alternating; and to\r\nthat cause very great extremes, and marked exceptions, may be due,\r\nnotwithstanding the spots upon the sun may exert an influence in producing\r\nhot summers and cold winters toward the close of each decade. Thus, to\r\nselect an instance to illustrate this and explain an anomaly: The coldest\r\nseason during the whole period, embraced in the following tables, is that\r\nof 1812. This occurs during the decrease of spots, and the warm half of\r\nthe decade. Turning to the table of volcanic action, and of earthquakes,\r\nfound in the Report of the British Association for 1854, we find that year\r\nwas remarkable for earthquakes in the United States and South America. In\r\nDecember, 1811, earthquakes commenced in the valley of the Mississippi,\r\nOhio, and Arkansas, felt also at places in Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nIndiana, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, though\r\nnot so severely east of the Alleghanies, _which continued until 1813_.\r\nAbout the same time they commenced in Caraccas, and, in March, 1812,\r\nbecame severe over the greater portion of the northern section of South\r\nAmerica, and in the Atlantic. No such general and continued succession of\r\nearthquakes occurred during the other periods embraced in the tables, and\r\nthe mean of the following five years was very low, embracing the memorable\r\ncold summer of 1816.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Cold Period.  | Warm Period.  | Cold Period.  | Warm Period.  |\r\n  |---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\r\n  |1786    48 deg..53 |1791    48 deg..963|1796    48 deg..678|1801    50 deg..432|\r\n  |1787    47 deg..88 |1792    48 deg..44 |1797    48 deg..135|1802    50 deg..794|\r\n  |1788    47 deg..676|1793    50 deg..96 |1798    49 deg..471|1803    50 deg..24 |\r\n  |1789    47 deg..68 |1794    50 deg..768|1799    48 deg..291|1804    48 deg..328|\r\n  |1790    46 deg..53 |1795    50 deg..173|1800    49 deg..989|1805    50 deg..792|\r\n  |---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\r\n  |Mean of        |               |               |               |\r\n  |period  47 deg..659|Mean    49 deg..901|Mean    48 deg..910|Mean    50 deg..117|\r\n  |---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\r\n  |---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\r\n  |1806    47 deg..982|1811    50 deg..76 |1816    47 deg..113|1821    48 deg..15 |\r\n  |1807    48 deg..132|1812    45 deg..28 |1817    46 deg..277|1822    49 deg..81 |\r\n  |1808    49 deg..485|1813    47 deg..702|1818    48 deg..009|1823    47 deg..58 |\r\n  |1809    47 deg..92 |1814    48 deg..279|1819    50 deg..75 |1824    49 deg..25 |\r\n  |1810    49 deg..001|1815    47 deg..607|1820    48 deg..70 |1825    50 deg..99 |\r\n  |---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\r\n  |Mean    48 deg..505|Mean    47 deg..925|Mean    48 deg..169|Mean    49 deg..15 |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe tables of Dr. Hildreth, from 1826 to 1854, inclusive, furnish,\r\ngenerally, evidence of a like character. There are, however, an anomaly or\r\ntwo which will be observed. From 1826 to 1830, the mean is high during\r\nthe period when spots were at a maximum. But that maximum embraced a much\r\nless number of spots than the two succeeding ones. A contrast appears in\r\nthe tables of Dr. Hildreth, during the early period, for Dr. Holyoke's\r\nregister, for 1827, puts it _below the mean_, but Dr. Hildreth's one of\r\nthe _highest of the half century_. In 1835 commenced a period when the\r\nspots were much more numerous, and from 1835 to 1838, inclusive, the\r\nseasons were correspondingly below the mean. From that period to 1844 a\r\ngradual and slightly irregular rise took place, excepting the year 1843,\r\nwhen another cold year intervened. The table of earthquakes, published by\r\nthe British Association, closes with 1842, and I have not access to any\r\nothers. The occurrence of such cold years, in the warm period, at\r\nintervals during the two centuries previous, and in 1812, and onward, and\r\nevidently owing to increased volcanic action beneath the western portion\r\nof the northern hemisphere, justifies the belief that the low temperature\r\nof 1843 was owing to the same cause. The following are the means from the\r\ntables of Dr. Hildreth:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |1826  54 deg..00|1831  50 deg..87|1836  50 deg..03|1841  52 deg..18|1846  53 deg..64|\r\n  |1827  54 deg..92|1832  52 deg..42|1837  51 deg..57|1842  52 deg..83|1847  52 deg..00|\r\n  |1828  55 deg..22|1833  54 deg..56|1838  50 deg..62|1843  50 deg..77|1848  52 deg..50|\r\n  |1829  52 deg..38|1834  52 deg..40|1839  52 deg..54|1844  53 deg..25|1849  52 deg..09|\r\n  |1830  54 deg..93|1835  50 deg..65|1840  52 deg..35|1845  52 deg..73|1850  51 deg..48|\r\n  |------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\r\n  |Mean  54 deg..29|Mean  52 deg..18|Mean  51 deg..52|Mean  52 deg..35|Mean  52 deg..32|\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe observations of Dr. Holyoke were made at Salem, Massachusetts; those\r\nof Dr. Hildreth at Marietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe following, in relation to the freezing of the Ohio River, is evidence\r\nof a different kind, but shows the same general correspondence, and\r\nparticularly _the mildness of the winters when there were few spots_, and\r\ntheir severity from 1836 to 1838, inclusive, when the spots were most\r\nnumerous:\r\n\r\n  1829.--River open all winter--some floating ice.\r\n  1830.--River closed 27th January.\r\n  1831.--Floating ice--closed 23d January--opened 20th February.\r\n  1832.--Closed in December, which was a very cold month--opened January\r\n         8, and remained open all winter.\r\n  1833.--Open all winter.\r\n  1834.--Open all winter.\r\n  1835.--Closed January 6--opened the last of the month--cold.\r\n  1836.--Closed 28th January--opened 25th February.\r\n  1837.--Closed from 8th December to 8th February. Cold year.\r\n  1838.--Closed from 13th January to 13th March. Cold year.\r\n  1839.--Closed from 6th December to 13th January.\r\n  1840.--Closed 29th December--opened 15th January.\r\n  1841.--Closed 3d January--opened 8th do.\r\n  1842.--Open all winter.\r\n  1843.--Closed 28th November--opened 5th December--open all the rest of\r\n         the winter.\r\n  1844.--Open all winter.\r\n  1845.--Open all winter.\r\n  1846.--Closed 5th December--opened again a few days--closed again on the\r\n         26th. It is not stated how long it remained closed.\r\n  1847.--Open all winter.\r\n  1848.--Much floating ice, but not closed--heavy rains and floods.\r\n  1849.--Floating ice in January, but not closed.\r\n  1850.--Floating ice, but not closed.\r\n  1851.--Open all winter--a little ice.\r\n\r\n  (December in the above table, means December previous).\r\n\r\nThis is more reliable as to the winter season than the tables of annual\r\nmeans--although the evidence they afford, making due allowance for the\r\nexceptions, is very striking.\r\n\r\nI shall return to this part of the subject again.\r\n\r\nBut there is other evidence of the influence of these spots. Their\r\nconnection with the irregular magnetic disturbance of the earth has been\r\ndistinctly traced. Colonel Sabine, President of the British Association,\r\nin his opening address, September, 1852, after reviewing the recent\r\ndiscoveries in magnetism, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is not a little remarkable that this periodical magnetic\r\n     variation is found to be identical in period, and in epochs of maxima\r\n     and minima, with the periodical variation in the frequency and\r\n     magnitude of the _solar spots_, which M. Schwabe has established by\r\n     twenty-six years of unremitting labor. From a cosmical connection of\r\n     this nature, supposing it to be finally established, it would follow\r\n     that the decennial period, which we measure by our magnetic\r\n     instrument, is, in fact, a solar period, manifested to us, also, by\r\n     the alternately increasing and decreasing frequency and magnitude of\r\n     observations on the surface of the solar disc. May we not have in\r\n     these phenomena the indication of a cycle, or period of _secular\r\n     change in the magnetism of the sun_, affecting visibly his gaseous\r\n     atmosphere or photosphere, and sensibly modifying the magnetic\r\n     influence which he exercises on the surface of our earth?\"--American\r\n     Journal of Science, new series, vol. xiv. p. 438.\r\n\r\nI think it may fairly be inferred, that although these spots do not\r\noccasion the \"cold spells\" and \"hot spells,\" and other transient\r\npeculiarities, they do materially affect the _mean_ temperature of the\r\nyear, and exert an obvious influence when at their maxima; and there is a\r\ntendency to an increase of the heat and dryness of summer, and the\r\nseverity of winter, at the periods named, in our excessive climate, and a\r\nwell-established connection between the spots and magnetic disturbances\r\nand variations.\r\n\r\nPopular opinion has ever attributed to the moon a controlling effect upon\r\nthe changes of the weather. If it be dry, a storm is expected _when the\r\nmoon changes_; or if it be wet, dry weather. Such popular opinions are\r\nusually entitled to respect, and founded in truth. But every attempt to\r\nverify _this opinion_, by careful observation and registration, has\r\nfailed. Weather-tables and lunar phases, compared for nearly one hundred\r\nyears, show four hundred and ninety-one new or full moons attended by a\r\nchange of the weather, and five hundred and nine without. The celebrated\r\nOlbers, after _fifty years of careful observation_ and comparison, decided\r\nagainst it. So did the more celebrated Arago, at a more recent\r\ndate--summing up the result of his observations by saying--\"Whatever the\r\nprogress of the sciences, never will observers, who are trustworthy and\r\ncareful of their reputation, venture to foretell the state of the\r\nweather.\" Still, the moon may influence the weather, though she may not\r\neffect changes at her syzygies or quadratures, and this subject should not\r\nbe too summarily dismissed. That the moon can not effect changes at the\r\nperiods named seems philosophically obvious. She changes, for the _whole\r\nearth_, within the period of twenty-four hours; yet, how varied the state\r\nof things on different portions of its surface. The equatorial belts of\r\ntrades, and drought, and rains, cover from fifty to sixty degrees of its\r\nsurface, and know nothing of lunar disturbance. The extra-tropical belt of\r\nrains and variable weather moves up in its season, uncovering 10 deg., or\r\nmore, of latitude, and admitting the trades and a six months' drought over\r\nit, as in California, regardless of the moon. Under the zone of\r\nextra-tropical rains, even upon the eastern part of the continent of North\r\nAmerica, \"dry spells\" and \"wet spells\" exist side by side; the focus of\r\nprecipitation is now in one parallel, and now in another--_storms_ exist\r\n_here_ and _fair weather there_, on the same continent at the same time;\r\nand as the moon's rays in her northing pass round the northern hemisphere\r\nduring the twenty-four hours, they, doubtless, pass from ten to thirty or\r\nmore storms, of all characters and intensities, moving in opposition to\r\nher orbit--and as many larger intervening areas of fair weather, not one\r\nof which are indebted to her for their existence, or \"take thought of her\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm, which originates in the tropics, pursues its curving way now N.\r\nW., then N. E., and again north, to the Arctic circle, and, perhaps,\r\naround the magnetic pole, over gulf, and continent, and ocean, _occupying\r\none third the time of a lunation, and two changes, perhaps, in its\r\nprogress_, without any perceptible or conceivable influence from her. Yet\r\nevery inhabitant of mother-earth, influenced by _coincidences remembered_,\r\nand uninfluenced by _exceptions forgotten_, looks up within his limited\r\nhorizon, and devoutly expects from the agency of some phase of the moon, a\r\nchange for the special benefit of his _dot_ upon the earth's surface. Upon\r\nhow many of these countless dots is the moon at a particular phase, or\r\nrelative distance from the sun, to change fair weather to foul, or foul to\r\nfair? Upon none. The storms keep on their way;--the wet spells, and the\r\ndry spells, the cold and the hot spells alternate in their time, and\r\nthough the moon turns toward them in passing, her dark face, her half\r\nface, or her full orb (the gifts of the sun, which confer no power), they\r\ndo not heed her. They are originated, and are continued, by a more potent\r\nagent. They are the work of an atmospheric mechanism, as _ceaseless_ in\r\nits operation as _time_, as _regular_ as the _seasons_, _as extensive as\r\nthe globe_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it seems as if it was expressly designed by the Creator that the\r\nmoon should not interfere materially with this atmospheric machinery. She\r\nis the nearest orb; her influence would be controlling and continuous;\r\nwould follow her monthly path from south to north, and with changes too\r\nviolent, and intervals too long; and would interfere with the regular\r\nfundamental operation in the trade-wind region, where she is _vertical_.\r\nAside from the attraction of gravitation, therefore, she seems to have\r\nbeen so created as to be incapable of exerting any influence. She is\r\nwithout an atmosphere; the rays which she reflects are polarized, and\r\nwithout chemical or magnetic power; and, if it be true that Melloni has\r\nrecently detected heat in them, by the use of a lens three feet in\r\ndiameter, which could not previously be effected, its quantity is\r\nexceedingly small, and incapable of influence. Doubtless, the attraction\r\nof her mass is felt upon the earth, as the tides attest; and upon the\r\natmosphere as well as the ocean. But the atmosphere is comparatively\r\n_attenuated_, and exceedingly so at its upper surface. Her attraction,\r\ntherefore, although felt, is not influential. She seemed, to Dr. Howard,\r\nto produce in her northing and southing, a lateral tide which the\r\nbarometer disclosed, but owing to the attenuated character of the\r\natmosphere, neither the sun nor moon create an easterly and westerly tide,\r\nthat is observable, except with the most delicate instruments. Sabine is\r\nbelieved to have detected such a tide by the barometer, at St. Helena, of\r\none four thousandth of an inch. But even this _infinitesimal influence_\r\nmay prove an error upon further investigation. There is a diurnal\r\nvariation of the barometer, but it is not the result of her attraction,\r\nfor it is not later each day as are the tides, exists in the deepest mines\r\nas well as upon the surface, and is demonstrably connected with the\r\n_group_ of _diurnal_ changes produced by the action of the sun-light and\r\nheat upon the earth's magnetism.\r\n\r\nCan the lateral tide, if there be one, affect the weather? for in the\r\npresent state of science it seems entirely certain that the moon can exert\r\nan influence in no other way.\r\n\r\nIf the received idea of many, perhaps most, meteorologists, on which all\r\nwheel barometers are constructed, that a _high barometer_ necessarily\r\nproduces _fair weather_, and a _low one foul_, were true, she certainly\r\nmight do so. But that idea can not be sustained, and there is no known\r\ncertain influence exerted by the moon upon the weather, in relation to\r\nwhich we have any reliable practical data.\r\n\r\nHumboldt appears to have adopted the impression of Sir W. Herschell, that\r\nthe moon aids in the dispersion of the clouds. (Cosmos, vol. iv. p. 502.)\r\nBut the tendency to such dispersion is always rapid during the latter part\r\nof the day and evening, when there is no storm approaching, and the full\r\nmoon renders their dissolution visible, and attracts attention to them.\r\nThe Greenwich observations, also, carefully examined by Professor Loomis,\r\nfail to confirm the impression of Herschell and Humboldt, and those\r\neminent philosophers are doubtless in this mistaken.\r\n\r\nFrom this general and somewhat desultory view of the general facts, which\r\nbear analogically upon the question, no decisive inference can be drawn in\r\nrelation to the seat of the primary influence which produces the\r\natmospheric changes. The preponderance is in favor of the magnetic, or\r\nmagneto-electric, action of the earth. We must come back to our own\r\ncountry and grapple with the question at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to do this, however, it may be well to look at some\r\ntheories which have been advanced, and to a greater or less extent\r\nadopted, and at their bearing upon the question.\r\n\r\nThe calorific theory is at present the prevailing one in Europe and in\r\nthis country. Meteorologists there and here refer all atmospheric\r\nconditions and phenomena to the influence of heat. The principal\r\napplications of that theory have been considered. But within the last few\r\nyears the elasticity and tension of the aqueous vapor of the atmosphere\r\nhave received much attention, as exerting an auxiliary or modifying\r\ninfluence. Professor Dove, of Berlin, who ranks perhaps as the most\r\ndistinguished meteorologist of that continent, attributes barometric\r\nvariations to _lateral overflows_, and, in the upper regions, resulting\r\nfrom the elevation of the atmosphere by expansion; and in this view\r\nmeteorologists of Europe seem generally to acquiesce. In an article sent\r\nto Colonel Sabine, and recently republished in the American Journal of\r\nScience, January, 1855, in thus attempting to account for the annual\r\nvariation of barometric pressure, which occurs in Europe and Asia, and,\r\nindeed, over the entire hemisphere. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"From the combined action or the variations of aqueous vapor, and of\r\n     the dry air, we derive immediately the periodical variations of the\r\n     whole atmospheric pressure. As the dry air and the aqueous vapor\r\n     mixed with it, press in common on the barometer, so that the up-borne\r\n     column of mercury consists of two parts, one borne by the dry air,\r\n     the other by the aqueous vapor, we may well understand that as with\r\n     increasing temperature the air expands, and by reason of its\r\n     augmented volume rises higher, and _its upper portion overflows\r\n     laterally_,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnd in another place he says:\r\n\r\n     \"From the magnitude of the variations in the northern hemisphere, and\r\n     the extent of the region over which it prevails, we must infer that\r\n     _at the time of diminished pressure a lateral overflow probably takes\r\n     place_,\" etc.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the mean pressure of the atmosphere, in summer, in the northern\r\nhemisphere, is less than in winter, in some localities, and greater in\r\nothers, and it differs in different countries of equal temperature. And\r\nthis is all very intelligible. The mean of the pressure for the month is\r\nmade up by _averaging_ all the _elevations_ and _depressions_. During a\r\nmonth, showing a very low mean, the barometer may, at times, attain its\r\n_highest altitude_, if the depressions below the mean are great or more\r\nfrequent. The barometer is depressed during storms, and ranges high during\r\n_set fair_ weather. Ordinarily, therefore, the more stormy the season the\r\nmore diminished the mean pressure; and it is a mistake to look to an\r\noverflow to account for the fact. The changes in the location of the\r\natmospheric machinery, and consequent change in the amount and severity of\r\nfalling weather, and the periodic frequency and character of storms, and\r\nconsequent _periodic_ depressions and elevations of the barometer,\r\nexplain the annual mean variations, as they do the other phenomena. But it\r\nis perfectly consistent with the calorific theory to attempt to account\r\nfor these differences by another of those ever-necessary modifications,\r\nviz.: the different tension and elasticity of aqueous vapor in different\r\ncountries of equal temperature; and then to _suppose_ an expansion of the\r\nwhole body of the atmosphere and a lateral overflow from the place where\r\nthe air is expanded, on to some other, where it is not; and thus _suppose_\r\nall necessary currents in the upper regions, setting hither and yon, by\r\nthe force of gravity alone. And apparently he who is best at supposition\r\nbecomes the most distinguished meteorologist. Perhaps I have already said\r\nall that I ought to be pardoned for saying, in relation to the utter\r\nabsurdity of attributing all meteorological phenomena to the agency of\r\nheat; but when I find such views as those which that article contains,\r\nemanating from so distinguished a man, sanctioned by the President of the\r\nBritish Association, and copied into the leading journal of science in\r\nthis country, I can not forbear a further and a somewhat critical\r\nexamination of them. There is more error of supposition and less truth in\r\nit, than in any other article regarding the science, of equal length,\r\nwhich has fallen under my notice.\r\n\r\nWhat is the height of this expansion? The moisture of evaporation ascends,\r\nordinarily, but a few thousand feet. The atmosphere grows regularly\r\ncooler, from the earth to the trade, and _the increased warmth that is\r\nfelt at the surface extends but little way_. Currents of warm air do not\r\nascend. The strata maintain, substantially, their relative positions; and\r\nthis is a most beneficent provision. In northern latitudes of the\r\ntemperate zone, all the warmth derived from a few hours' sunshine is\r\nneeded at the surface; and, deplorable, indeed, would be our condition, if\r\nthe atmosphere, as fast as warmed by the rays of the sun, were to hasten\r\nup, and the frigid strata descend in its place. The earth would not be\r\nhabitable. All the warm air on its surface would be rising as soon as it\r\nbecame warmed, and the cold air above be descending, and enveloping us\r\nwith the chilling strata which are ever floating within two or three miles\r\nabove us. No. Infinite wisdom has ordered it otherwise. The laws of\r\nmagnetism and of static-electric induction and attraction keep the strata\r\nin their places, and preserve to us the warmth which the solar rays afford\r\nor produce. The inhabitant of the valley, in a high northern latitude, in\r\nsummer, can plant, and sow, and reap, at the base of the mountain whose\r\nsummit penetrates the stratum of continual congelation, and up its sides,\r\nalmost to the line of perpetual snow; and, as he looks upon the fruits of\r\nhis labor, and up to the snow-clad peak that towers above him, can thank\r\nhis Maker for placing a warm equatorial current, a perpetual barrier,\r\nbetween the fertility and warmth which surround him, and the cold\r\ndestructive strata above; and thank Him for not creating such a state of\r\nthings, as certain meteorologists insist we shall believe He has created.\r\nAgain, where are the _upper regions_, from which the lateral overflow\r\ntakes place? The atmosphere is differently estimated, at from thirty to\r\nforty-five miles, or more, in height. Whatever its height may be, it is\r\nexceedingly attenuated in its \"upper regions.\"\r\n\r\nGay-Lussac marked the barometer at 12-95/100 inches at the height of\r\n23,040 feet. Two thirds of the atmospheric density, then, is within five\r\nmiles of the earth. Air, too, is _compressible_. Allowing for the latter\r\nand the attenuation, how many miles in vertical depth, of its \"_upper\r\nregions_,\" must move from one portion to another, to depress the barometer\r\ntwo inches--its range sometimes in twenty-four hours--or even half an\r\ninch? Let the computation be made, and see how startling the proposition,\r\nhow utterly impossible that the theory can be true.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished Professor, in the paper referred to, introduces his\r\ntheory of the formation of hurricanes, and we quote--\r\n\r\n     \"If we suppose the upper portions of the air ascending over Asia and\r\n     Africa to flow off laterally, and if this takes place suddenly, it\r\n     will check the course of the upper or counter-current above the\r\n     trade-wind, and force it to break into the lower current.\r\n\r\n     \"An east wind coming into a S. W. current must necessarily occasion a\r\n     rotatory movement, turning in the opposite direction to the hands of\r\n     a watch. A rotatory storm, moving from S. E. to N. W., in the lower\r\n     current or trade, would, in this view, be the result of the encounter\r\n     of two masses of air, impelled toward each other at many places in\r\n     succession, the further cause of the rotation (originating primarily\r\n     in this manner) being that described by me in detail in a memoir 'On\r\n     the Law of Storms,' translated in the 'Scientific Memoirs,' vol. iii.\r\n     art. 7. Thus, it happens that the West India hurricanes, and the\r\n     Chinese typhoons occur near the lateral confines on either side of\r\n     the great region of atmospheric expansion, the typhoons being\r\n     probably occasioned by the direct pressure of the air from the region\r\n     of the trade-winds over the Pacific, into the more expanded air of\r\n     the monsoon region, and being distinct from the storms appropriately\r\n     called by the Portuguese 'temporales,' which accompany the out-burst\r\n     of the monsoon when the direction of the wind is reversed.\"\r\n\r\nThe analogy between this, and a theory of Mr. Redfield's, will be noticed\r\nfurther on. But I remark, in passing, that there is not a fact or\r\ninference in this paragraph which will bear examination.\r\n\r\n1. There is no such regular S. W. wind over the surface trade, as he\r\nsupposes. Doubtless, there are, occasionally, secondary S. W. currents\r\nbetween the counter-trade and the surface one, with partial condensation,\r\nfor much of both becomes depolarized by their reciprocal action and\r\nprecipitation, and these induced S. W. currents are sometimes so strong as\r\nto usurp the place of the surface-trade, and become very violent in the\r\nlatter part of hurricanes; but such is not the usual course of the upper\r\ncurrents of the West Indies, as the progress of storms there, and\r\nobservation, prove.\r\n\r\n2. There can not be any _periods_ of extensive and _sudden_ expansion over\r\nAfrica. If there is any place on the earth which has a more uniformly\r\nprogressive temperature, either way, and is more free from _sudden_\r\nextremes, or which is more arid and destitute of aqueous vapor, and sudden\r\naqueous expansions, than another, it is Africa. No such occasional sudden\r\nexpansions are there possible.\r\n\r\n3. Winds do not, and can not, \"_encounter_.\" They stratify upon each\r\nother. They are produced by the action of opposite electricity, and are\r\n_connected together_ in their origin and action. The atmosphere is never\r\nfree from the regular and irregular currents, however invisible for the\r\nwant of condensation. Aeronauts find them in the most serene days. They\r\nexist without encounter or tendency to rotation, every where, and at all\r\ntimes; even over the head of the distinguished Professor, whether he\r\nsleeps or is awake. We can all see them when there is condensation, and it\r\nis rarely the case that there is not some degree of it in some of them.\r\n\r\n4. That \"Great region of expansion\" is a chimera. It does not exist. It is\r\na region of _lower temperature_, and of _condensation_, instead of\r\n_expansion_ of _aqueous vapor_. The trade does not rise in it, or the S.\r\nW. wind overflow from it. See the table cited page 165.\r\n\r\n5. The hurricanes do not originate _in the surface trades_, as he\r\nsupposes. They originate in the belt of rains, the supposed \"region of\r\nexpansion,\" and issue out of it; or in the counter-trade, where volcanic\r\nelevations rise far into or above the surface trade.\r\n\r\n6. This hypothesis can not be sustained upon his own principles. The\r\ndistance between Africa and the West India Islands, where most of the\r\nhurricanes originate, is from 2,500 to 3,000 miles. These gales are small\r\nwhen they commence, not ordinarily over one or two hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, and often less. There are trades all the way over from Africa,\r\nand S. W. winds also, if they exist, as he supposes, in the West Indies.\r\nHow can it happen that this lateral overflow should pass _without effect_,\r\nover 2,500 miles of S. W. wind and trade, and concentrating the overflow\r\nof a continent over one small and chosen spot of the West Indies, _pitch\r\ndown_ there, and there only, and crowd the S. W. wind into the trade\r\nbelow? This is too much for sensible men to believe.\r\n\r\nWhat does Professor Dove mean by the term _impulsion_, as applied to the\r\nwinds? How are they _impelled_? It is the fundamental idea of his\r\ncalorific theory, that they are _drawn_ by the _suction_ caused by a\r\n_vacuum_, and the vacuum created by expansion and overflow above, in\r\nobedience to the law of gravity; that the S. E. trade is drawn to the\r\ngreat region of expansion, and the S. W. runs from it as an overflow. But\r\nif the S. W. is driven down into the plane and place of the\r\nsurface-trades, how does it continue to be impelled, and why is it not\r\nthen subject to the suction of the vacuum which draws the trade? Does that\r\nvacuum _select its air_, and so attract the trade, in preference to the\r\ndepressed portion of the S. W. current, that the former runs around the\r\nlatter to get to the vacuum, and the latter around the former to get away\r\nfrom it? And does the trade, when it has got around the S. W. current,\r\ninstead of going to the vacuum, continue to gyrate, and the S. W. current,\r\ninstead of pursuing its regular course, gyrate also about the trade, and\r\nboth move off together, regardless of the vacuum of the great region of\r\nexpansion, in a new direction to the N. W., in an independent,\r\nself-sustaining, cyclonic movement, increasing in power and extent,\r\ninvolving extended and increasing condensation, producing the most violent\r\nelectrical phenomena, and thus continuing up, even to the Arctic circle?\r\nYes, says Professor Dove. No, say all fact, all analogy, and his own\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n7. His theory relative to the typhoons is unintelligible. If they\r\noriginate near the lateral confines of the great region of atmospheric\r\nexpansion, they originate in the region of the trade-winds, for the two\r\nare identical. How the direct pressure of the air from the trade-wind over\r\nthe Pacific, in the more expanded air of the monsoon region, can occasion\r\na typhoon upon any principles, passes my comprehension. If, as Lieutenant\r\nMaury supposes, the monsoons are reversed trades, then the trade-wind and\r\nmonsoon region are identical. If the monsoons are found in the belt of\r\nrains, then, the trades, upon Professor Dove's principles, pass into the\r\nmonsoon region by attraction or suction, without pressure. Either way the\r\ntheory is undeserving of consideration.\r\n\r\nA new theory has recently been started by Mr. Thomas Dobson, and, although\r\nit is (like all other efforts to get the _upper strata down_ to produce\r\ncondensation, or those below _up_, that they may be condensed), without\r\nfoundation, his collection of facts is brief and interesting. I copy his\r\narticle from the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Phil. Mag., for December,\r\n1853. It adds to the collection of facts in relation to the connection\r\nbetween volcanic action and storms for the seventeenth century, made by\r\nDr. Webster:\r\n\r\n     The following appear to be the main facts which are available as a\r\n     basis for a theory which shall comprehend all the meteors in\r\n     question:\r\n\r\n     1st. The eruption of a submarine volcano has produced water-spouts.\r\n\r\n     \"During these bursts the most vivid flashes of lightning continually\r\n     issued from the densest part of the volcano, and the volumes of smoke\r\n     rolled off in large masses of fleecy clouds, gradually expanding\r\n     themselves before the wind in a direction nearly horizontal, and\r\n     drawing up _a quantity of water-spouts_.\"--(Captain Tilland's\r\n     description of the upheaval of Sabrina Island in June, 1811, Phil.\r\n     Trans.)\r\n\r\n     With this significant fact may be compared the following analogous\r\n     ones:\r\n\r\n     \"In the Aleutian Archipelago a new island was formed in 1795.

Within the tropics, cyclones move toward the west; and, in\r\n     middle latitudes, cyclones and water-spouts move toward the N. E., in\r\n     the northern hemisphere, and toward the S. E. in the southern\r\n     hemisphere.\r\n\r\n     9th. In the northern hemisphere, cyclones rotate in a horizontal\r\n     plane, in the order N. W., S. E.; and in the southern hemisphere, in\r\n     the order N. E., S. W.\r\n\r\n     By applying the principles of electro-dynamics to the electricity of\r\n     the atmosphere, I shall endeavor to connect and explain the preceding\r\n     well-defined facts. The continuous observations of Quetelet, on the\r\n     electricity of the atmosphere, from 1844 to 1849 (Literary Journal,\r\n     February, 1850), show that it is always positive, and increases as\r\n     the temperature diminishes. It therefore increases rapidly with the\r\n     height above the earth's surface. We may, consequently, regard the\r\n     upper and colder regions of the atmosphere as an immense reservoir of\r\n     electric fluid enveloping the earth, which is insulated by the\r\n     intermediate spherical shell formed by the lower and denser\r\n     atmosphere. Now, whenever a vertical column of this atmosphere is\r\n     suddenly displaced, the surrounding aqueous vapor will be immediately\r\n     condensed and aggregated, and the cold rarefied air and moisture will\r\n     form a vertical conductor for the descent of the electrical fluid.\r\n     This descent will take place down a spiral, gyrating in the order N.\r\n     W., S. E., in the northern hemisphere, since the electric current is\r\n     under the same influence as that of the south pole of a magnet; and\r\n     in the order N. E., S. W., in the southern hemisphere. The air\r\n     exterior to the conducting cylinder will partake of the violent\r\n     revolving motion, and a tornado or cyclone will be produced.\r\n\r\nUpon the foregoing facts I shall comment in another place.\r\n\r\nThree theories have been advanced by meteorologists of this country, two\r\nof which profess to explain all the phenomena of the weather. Professor\r\nEspy attributed the production of storms and rain to an ascending column\r\nof air, rarefied by heat, and the rarefaction increased by the latent heat\r\nof vapor given out during condensation, and an inward tendency of the air,\r\nfrom all directions, toward the ascending vortex, constituting the\r\nprevailing winds. Thus, Professor Espy conceived, and to some extent\r\nproved, that the wind blew inward, from all sides, toward the center of a\r\nstorm, either as a circle, or having a long central line, and he conceived\r\nthat it ascended in the middle, and spread out above; and that clouds,\r\nrain, hail, and snow, were formed by condensation consequent upon the\r\nexpansion and cooling of the atmosphere, as it attained an increased\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n_This ascent_ was not, in fact, _proved_ by Professor Espy, _has not been\r\nfound by others_, and _is not discoverable, according to my observations_.\r\nThe theory was ingenious, founded on the theory of Dalton, that the vapor\r\nwas maintained in the atmosphere by reason of a large quantity of latent\r\nheat, which was given out when condensation took place. This theory is\r\nalso unsound. No such elevation of temperature is found in clouds or fogs\r\nwhen they form near the earth, however dense. Thus the two principal\r\nelements of Professor Espy's theory are found to be untrue, and the theory\r\nuntenable. But it was sustained with great ability and research, and the\r\ndistinguished theorist deserves much for the discovery and record of\r\nimportant facts in relation to the weather. Aside from its theoretical\r\nviews, his book contains a great mass of valuable information, and will\r\nwell repay the cost of purchase and perusal.\r\n\r\nAnother theory, by Mr. Bassnett, is of recent date, founded on the\r\ninfluence of the moon, and the supposed creation of vortices in the ether\r\nabove, whose influence extends to the earth, producing storms and other\r\nphenomena. No one can peruse his book without conceding to him great\r\nability and scientific attainment; and if his theory was true, the periods\r\nof fair and foul weather could be calculated with great mathematical\r\ncertainty. But it contains inherent and insuperable objections. I will\r\nonly add that all herein before contained is in direct opposition to it.\r\n\r\nMr. W. C. Redfield, of New York, as early as 1831, first advanced in this\r\ncountry the theory of gyration in storms, and investigated their lines of\r\nprogress on our coast and continent. His theory is limited in its\r\ncharacter, and does not profess, except indirectly, to explain all, or\r\nindeed any, of the other phenomena of the weather. As far as it goes,\r\nhowever, it is generally received in this country and Europe, and has\r\nbeen adopted by Reed, Piddington, and others, who have written on the law\r\nof storms. The position of Mr. Redfield is honorable to himself and his\r\ncountry. Science and navigation are much indebted to him for his industry\r\nin the collection of facts. Nevertheless, his theory is not in accordance\r\nwith my observation, and I deem it unsound. Although expressed disbelief\r\nof the theory has been characterized as an \"attack\" upon its author, I\r\npropose, with that _respect_ which is due to him, but with that _freedom_\r\nand _independence_ which a search for _truth_ warrants, to examine it with\r\nsome particularity. It is a part of the subject, and I can not avoid it.\r\n\r\nWhen the theory was first announced, I adopted it as probably true; and\r\nbeing then engaged in a different profession, which took me much into the\r\nopen air by night and day, I watched with renewed care the clouds and\r\ncurrents for evidence to confirm it. I discovered none; on the contrary, I\r\nfound much, very much, absolutely and utterly inconsistent with its truth.\r\nThe substance only of these observations will be adduced.\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield admits that the progression of our storms in the vicinity of\r\nNew York, is from some point between S. S. W. and W. S. W., to some point\r\nbetween N. N. E. and E. N. E. According to my observation, except perhaps\r\nin occasional autumnal gales, they are not often, if ever, from S. of S.\r\nW., and the great majority of them, including, I believe, all N. E.\r\nstorms, are between S. W. and W. S. W. Now, the card of Mr. Redfield,\r\nmoving over any place from any point between S. W. and W. S. W., calls for\r\na S. E. wind at its axis, an E. wind at its north front, and a S. wind at\r\nits south front, and does not call _for a N. E. wind on its front at all,\r\nexcept at the north extreme_, where it could _not continue for any\r\nconsiderable period_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn relation to this, I observe, 1st. _About one-half of our N. E. storms,\r\nincluding some of the most severe ones, not only set in N. E., but\r\ncontinue in that quarter without veering at all, during the entire period\r\nthat the storm cloud is over us_; usually for twenty-four hours; not\r\nunfrequently for forty-eight hours, sometimes for seventy-two or more\r\nhours. This every one can observe for himself, and it can not, of course,\r\nbe reconciled with his theory.\r\n\r\n2d. N. E. storms, whether they set in from that quarter in the\r\ncommencement, or veer to it afterward, when they do \"change\" round, more\r\nfrequently veer by the S. to the S. W. in clearing off, than back through\r\nthe N. into the N. W. The former, in accordance with his theory, they can\r\nnot do, as the reader can see by passing the left side of the card over\r\nhis place of residence on the map from S. W. to N. E.\r\n\r\n3d. N. E. storms often pass off without hauling by S. or backing by N.,\r\nand with or without a clearing off shower, the _wind shifting and coming\r\nout suddenly at S. W._ This they could not do in accordance with his\r\ntheory, as slipping the card will show.\r\n\r\n4th. From June to February it is _exceedingly uncommon_ for a N. E. storm\r\nto back into the N. W. They do so more frequently from February to May,\r\nespecially about the time of the vernal equinox and after; and then,\r\nbecause the focus of precipitation and storm intensity of the extra\r\ntropical zone of rains is S. of 42 deg. east of the Alleghanies. His theory\r\nrequires them to back by N. into N. W. _in all cases, when they set in N.\r\nE._\r\n\r\n5th. When they do back from the N. E. into the N. W., it rarely indeed\r\ncontinues to storm after the wind leaves the point of N. E. by N., and\r\ngenerally, if it does continue stormy, _the wind is light_, and not a\r\ngale, how violent soever the gale from the eastward may have been.\r\nUsually, by the time the wind gets N. W., it has cleared off. This, Mr.\r\nRedfield, as we shall see, evades by embracing the N. W. fair wind as a\r\npart of the same gale. According to my observation, therefore, a _very\r\nlarge proportion_ of the _N. E. storms_, and they are a majority of the\r\nmost violent ones of our climate east of the Alleghanies, do not\r\n_commence, continue_, or _veer_ in accordance with his theory, but the\r\n_reverse_; and so long as this is so, I can not receive his theory as\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n6th. S. E. storms do not always, or indeed often, conform to the\r\nrequirements of his card. When they set in violently at S. E., and\r\ncontinue so for hours without veering, the axis of the storm should be\r\nover us, and the wind should change _suddenly_ to N. W. This did not occur\r\nin the storm of Sept. 3, 1821, nor does it often, if ever, occur in the\r\nsummer or early gales of the autumnal months. In the later storms of\r\nautumn, and as often in those which are very gentle as any, and in the\r\nwinter months when S. E. gales are rare, it does sometimes so change after\r\nthe storm cloud has passed. But in the winter months, as in the storm\r\ninvestigated by Professor Loomis, the storms are frequently long from S.\r\nE. to N. W., and the S. E. wind blows nearly in coincidence with its long\r\naxis, for a thousand or fifteen hundred miles, till the barometric minimum\r\nis passed, and the inducing and attracting force of this part of the storm\r\ncloud is spent, and then the N. W. wind follows; sometimes blowing in\r\nunder the storm cloud, turning the rain to snow; but oftener following the\r\nstorm within a few hours, or the next day. The storm of Professor Loomis,\r\nwhen over Texas, was not probably more than four or five hundred miles in\r\nlength. As it curved more, and passed north and east, it extended\r\nlaterally, its center traveling with most rapidity, and when it reached\r\nthe eastern coast was about fifteen hundred miles long, and not more than\r\nsix hundred broad. Along the eastern part of that storm, except when by\r\nits more rapid progress the front projected much further eastward over New\r\nEngland than its previously existing line, the S. E. winds blew. When it\r\nbulged out, so to speak, by reason of the increased progress of the\r\ncenter, the wind veered to the N. E. The center of the storm passed near\r\nSt. Louis and south of Quebec, as the _fall of rain_, the _bulging_ of the\r\n_rapidly-moving center_, and the _line of subsequent cold_, attest. It is\r\nutterly impossible for any unbiased mind to look at the description of\r\nthat storm, and attribute to it a rotary character. With all the data\r\nbefore him, Mr. Redfield himself has not attempted it directly.[8]\r\n\r\nThe September storm of 1821 was more violent in character than any which\r\nhave since occurred. My recollection of it is as distinct as if it\r\noccurred yesterday. Peculiar circumstances, not important in this\r\nconnection, fixed my attention upon the weather during that day and night.\r\nThere were cirro-stratus clouds passing all day, from about S. W. to N.\r\nE., thickening toward night with fresh S. S. W. wind and flocculent scud,\r\nsuch as I have since seen at the setting-in of S. E. autumnal gales. In\r\nthe evening the wind (in the immediate neighborhood of Hartford, Ct.),\r\nveered to S. E., the cloud floated low, it became very dark, and the wind\r\nblew a most violent gale. The trees were falling about the house where I\r\nthen resided, the windows were burst in, and I was up and observant. When\r\nthe cloud passed off to the east, it was suddenly light, and almost calm.\r\nThe western edge of the storm cloud was as perpendicular as a steep\r\nmountain side, and was enormously elevated, and very black. I have\r\nsometimes seen the western side of a summer thunder cloud, which had drawn\r\na violent gust along beneath it, as elevated and perpendicular, but never\r\na storm cloud. No cloud of that _depth_, or _intensity_ as exhibited by\r\nits peculiar blackness, ever floated or will float so near the earth,\r\nwithout inducing a devastating current beneath. After it had passed the\r\nridges east of the Connecticut valley, its top could be seen for a long\r\nand unusual period over the elevated ranges.\r\n\r\nNow that storm was but an _intense portion_ of an extensive stratus-rain\r\ncloud. Such portions frequently exist, and Mr. Redfield admits the fact.\r\nAnother like portion, in the same storm, passed over Norfolk, Virginia,\r\nand the adjacent section, where the wind was N. E., and veered round by N.\r\nW. to S. W. Baltimore, and some vessels at sea, were between the two\r\nintense portions of the storm, and were not affected by either. Its\r\nnorthern limit was bounded by a line, drawn from some point not far north\r\nof Trenton, New Jersey, north-eastward, and north of Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts. I was about forty miles south of its northern limit, and\r\nnorth of its center. During that day, and the next, there was wind from\r\nS. W. to S. E., inclusive, including the gale, and _from no other\r\nquarter_. It did not at any time veer to the W. or N. W. After the passage\r\nof the storm-cloud, the wind was very light. When this intense portion of\r\nthe storm passed over the valley of the Connecticut, its longest axis was\r\nfrom S. S. E. to N. N. W., and the _wind was S. E. the whole length of\r\nit_. In its passage from the longitude of Trenton to Boston, there was N.\r\nW. wind at one point, and but one, and that was in the iron region, at the\r\nN. W. corner of Connecticut, at the northern limit of the intense cloud,\r\nand owing, doubtless, to some local cause. The direction of the wind in\r\nthat storm was in accordance with what is generally true of our storms.\r\nThe wind on the front of the storm depends upon its shape. If the storm is\r\nlong in proportion to its width (and no other _violent_ autumnal or winter\r\nstorm has been investigated, to my knowledge), the wind blows axially, or\r\nobliquely, on its front. Thus, if long from S. E. to N. W., the wind on\r\nits front will blow from the S. E. So, if the storm is long from S. W. to\r\nN. E., and has a south-eastern lateral extension, with an easterly\r\nprogression, the wind will blow axially in the center, and obliquely at\r\nthe edges. Instances might be multiplied, but I refer to one of recent\r\ndate and striking character. All of us remember the drought of 1854. It\r\nended in drenching rain on the 9th of September. This rain fell from a\r\nbelt, half showery and half stormy in character, which had a S. E. lateral\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the previous day there was some lightning visible at the\r\nnorth, and the usual S. S. W. afternoon wind _continued fresh after\r\nnightfall_. The next day we had a brisk wind from the same quarter, and,\r\nafter noon, the clouds appeared to pile up in the far north, seeming very\r\nelevated. They continued to do so, extending southerly during the\r\nafternoon, _with a high wind from S. S. W._, the cumulus clouds moving E.\r\nN. E. At 5 P.M., gentlemen who left New York at 3 P.M., reported that a\r\ndispatch had been received from Albany, dated 1 P.M., stating that it was\r\nraining very heavily there. About 7 P.M., the belt reached us, and it\r\nrained heavily from that time till morning. Not far from 8 P.M., and\r\nduring the heaviest rain, the wind shifted from the S. S. W. to N. E., and\r\nblew fresh and cold from that quarter during the night, and till the belt\r\nhad passed south, and then from N. E. by N., cool, with heavy scud, during\r\nthe forenoon, veering gradually to the N. N. E., and dying away. After the\r\nrain ceased, the northern edge of the belt was distinctly visible in the\r\nS. and S. E., its stratus-cloud moving E. N. E., and its scud to the\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nThe front of that storm did not pass over us. It was long and narrow. The\r\nwind blew somewhat obliquely inward, along its southern border, to the\r\neastward, and, in like manner, to the westward, on its northern border,\r\nbut from the N. E. axially along its central portions.\r\n\r\nIn the last instance, the wind changed from S. W. to N. E. This, too, is\r\nimpossible, according to Mr. Redfield's theory. Similar instances, in\r\nsummer, and early autumn, are not uncommon. But I shall recur to this in\r\nconnection with the different _classes_ of storms.\r\n\r\nAgain, the manner in which these S. E. winds co-exist with the N. E., and\r\nbecome the prevailing wind, toward the close of the storm, is instructive,\r\nand inconsistent with the theory of Mr. Redfield. In the West Indies, the\r\nfirst effect of the storm is to increase the N. E. trade; the wind then\r\nbecomes baffling, but settles in the N. W. or N. N. W., _in direct\r\nopposition to the admitted progress of the storm_. At this point, or at S.\r\nW., it blows with most force. Sometimes it veers gradually, and sometimes\r\nfalls calm, and comes out from the S. W., blowing violently. It ends by\r\nveering to the S. E., following gently the course of the storm. Thus, Mr.\r\nEdwards, in the third volume of his History of Jamaica, as herein before\r\ncited, \"_all hurricanes begin from the north, veer back to W. N. W., W.,\r\nand S. S. W., and when they get round to S. E. the foul weather breaks\r\nup_.\"\r\n\r\nA short, sudden gale, resembling those of our summer thunder-showers, is\r\nsometimes met with from the S. E.; but the violent hurricanes of any\r\nconsiderable continuance are, in almost every case, as just stated.\r\n\r\nNow, there is, in our latitudes, an obvious law on the subject, and it is\r\nthis:--If the storm is not disproportionately long, northerly and\r\nsoutherly, there is a general tendency to induce and attract a surface\r\ncurrent, in opposition to the course of the storm on its front, and\r\nespecially its north front. At the same time, there is a tendency to\r\ninduce a lateral current on its side, particularly the southerly side, and\r\nsometimes its south front: that the latter current is, in the first part\r\nof the storm, above the former; in the middle and latter part, it becomes\r\nthe prevailing current at the surface, and the wind changes accordingly,\r\nwith or without a calm--that this lateral change sometimes takes place on\r\neither side, but usually occurs on the side where the water is warmest, or\r\nthere is, for other and local reasons, a _greater susceptibility in the\r\natmosphere to inductive and attractive influence_. Thus, our N. E. storms\r\nvery frequently have a southerly current also, drawn from the ocean, south\r\nof us, which forms the middle current, and, in the middle and latter part\r\nof it, becomes the prevailing one. _I have seen more than a hundred such\r\ninstances, clearly and distinctly marked._ Since I have been writing this\r\nchapter, January 29th, 1855, such an instance has occurred. On Sunday, the\r\n28th, the cirro-stratus were all day passing from the S. W. to N. E., and\r\ngradually thickening with light air from the E. N. E., in the afternoon.\r\nDuring the evening the wind set in _violently_ from the N. E., with a\r\ndeluging rain. During the night, and after a brief calm, it changed\r\nsuddenly to the southward, and blew in like manner. This morning the storm\r\nwas gone, and with it, six inches of hard, frozen icy snow; the trade was\r\nclear, with the exception of here and there a broken, melting piece of\r\nstratus, but scud were still running from the southward, and the wind has\r\nbeen from the south, veering to S. W., all day, with sunshine. As I have\r\nbefore remarked, this middle current is always present, in this locality,\r\nin stratus storms, when there is a heavy fall of rain or snow, although,\r\nwhen the latter happens, the middle current is sometimes from the\r\nnorthward; if it be from the southward, it turns the snow first into very\r\nlarge flakes, and then to rain in our part of the storm.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the same thing occurs every where. In the West Indies, and\r\nespecially over the Leeward Islands, the middle current is most commonly\r\nfrom the stream of warm water which runs off to the westward into the\r\nCaribbean Sea; as the S. W. moonsoon is from the same current below the\r\nCape de Verdes. The S. W. winds, which come from those south polar waters,\r\nin the West Indies, appear to be the most violent. But it may be on either\r\nor both sides.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane cloud of the West Indies moves confessedly N. W. in most\r\ninstances, and undoubtedly it does in all. There is an immutable law that\r\nrequires it. The seeming exceptions are not such; they are but instances\r\nimperfectly investigated. Now, a circular storm moving N. W. can set in N.\r\nW. only on the left front, and _can not change to S. W. on that side of\r\nthe axis_. Nor can the wind blow at the axis from N. W. at all. It should\r\nbe N. E. in first half, and S. W. in last half. Strange as it may seem,\r\nthe axis of a West India hurricane in conformity with Mr. Redfield's\r\ntheory, and a N. W. progression, has never been found, with perhaps a\r\nsingle exception, in any one of which I have seen a description. On the\r\nwest coast of Europe, the gale is commonly from the Atlantic, either\r\nfollowing under the storm from the S. W., or blowing in diagonally from\r\nthe W. or N. W.; the N. E. wind of western Europe being a cold, dry wind,\r\nwhich there is reason to believe has been around the Siberian pole and is\r\nreturning, as the cold northerly winds of the North Pacific have around\r\nthe North American magnetic pole. \"If the N. E. winds always prevailed,\"\r\nsays Kaemtz, speaking of Berlin, \"even at a considerable height it would\r\nnever rain.\" This was based on an observation of showers, and not fully\r\nreliable. But the dry and cool character of the N. E. wind of western\r\nEurope is unquestionable. The S. E. wind is also a storm wind, but owing\r\nto the character of the surface from which it is attracted, it is not as\r\nviolent as the westerly winds are.\r\n\r\nSuch, too, is the general course and character of the side wind in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. There gales are less frequent, the magnetic intensity\r\nis less, the counter-trades are less; it is not in \"the order of\r\nProvidence\" that as much rain shall fall there. Nevertheless, gales occur,\r\nalthough rarely, if ever, with equal violence. About New Holland, where\r\nstorms are pursuing a S. E. course, they have the wind N. E.,\r\ncorresponding to our S. E., veering from thence, _by the north_, to the\r\nwestward, clearing off from S. W., with a rising barometer, as ours do\r\nfrom N. W.\r\n\r\nIn the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea, there is more\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\nBut the law of progress and lateral winds can be distinctly traced as\r\n_present_ and prevailing, notwithstanding the irregularities. Our limits\r\ndo not permit an analysis. In the celebrated case of the Charles Heddle,\r\nthere was much evidence to show that she was driven across the front of\r\nthe storm by one lateral wind, and back by another. (Diagram of Colonel\r\nReid, p. 206.)\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Indian Ocean are hot and confined. Storms there are\r\noften composed of detached masses, move slower--sometimes not more than\r\nthree or four miles an hour--and they curve over the ocean, where it is\r\nhotter than in any similar latitude. Yet, notwithstanding all\r\npeculiarities and irregularities, the law we have been considering is\r\nprobably the _prevailing_ law there.\r\n\r\nNo man knows better the existence of these different currents than Mr.\r\nRedfield. Doubtless it has escaped his attention that the upper of two,\r\nafter the passage of a considerable proportion of the storm, becomes the\r\nlower, and causes a seeming change of the same wind.\r\n\r\nIn a series of elaborate articles, substantially reviewing the whole\r\nsubject, published in the American Journal of Science, for 1846, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"In nearly all great storms which are accompanied with rain, there\r\n     appear two distinct classes of clouds, one of which, comprising the\r\n     storm scuds in the active portion of the gale, has already been\r\n     noticed. Above this is an extended stratum of stratus cloud, which is\r\n     found moving with the general or local current of the lower\r\n     atmosphere which overlies the storm. It covers not only the area of\r\n     rain, but often extends greatly beyond this limit, over a part of the\r\n     dry portion of the storm, partly in a broken or detached state. This\r\n     stratus cloud is often concealed from view by the nimbus, and scud\r\n     clouds in the rainy portion of the storm, but by careful\r\n     observations, may be sufficiently noticed to determine the general\r\n     uniformity of its specific course, and, approximately, its general\r\n     elevation.\r\n\r\n     \"The more usual course of this extended cloud stratum, in the United\r\n     States, is from some point in the horizon between S. S. W. and W. S.\r\n     W. Its course and velocity do not appear influenced in any\r\n     perceptible degree by the activity or direction of the storm-wind\r\n     which prevails beneath it. On the posterior or dry side of the gale,\r\n     it often disappears before the arrival of the newly condensed cumuli\r\n     and cumulo-stratus which not unfrequently float in the colder winds,\r\n     on this side of the gale.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The general height of the great stratus cloud which covers a storm,\r\n     in those parts of the United States which are near the Atlantic, can\r\n     not differ greatly from one mile; and perhaps is oftener below than\r\n     above this elevation. This estimate, which is founded on much\r\n     observation and comparison, appears to comprise, at the least, the\r\n     limit or thickness of the proper storm-wind, which constitutes the\r\n     revolving gale.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not supposed, however, that this disk-like stratum of\r\n     revolving wind is of equal height or thickness throughout its extent,\r\n     nor that it always reaches near to the main canopy of stratus cloud.\r\n     It is probably higher in the more central portions of the gale than\r\n     near its borders, in the low latitudes, than in the higher, and may\r\n     thin out entirely at the extremes, except in those directions where\r\n     it coincides with an ordinary current. Moreover, in large portions of\r\n     its area, there may be, and often is, more than one storm-wind\r\n     overlying another, and severally pertaining to contiguous storms. In\r\n     the present case, we see, from the observations of Professor Snell\r\n     and Mr. Herrick, at Amherst, Massachusetts, and at Hamden, Maine (115\r\n     and 135 b.), that the true storm wind, at those places, was\r\n     super-imposed on another wind; and various facts and observations may\r\n     be adduced to show that brisk winds, of great horizontal extent, are\r\n     often limited, vertically to a very thin sheet or stratum.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of the foregoing is graphically described, and unquestionably true.\r\nBut it may well be asked how he, or others, distinguish which of two or\r\nmore currents (for there are frequently three, and sometimes four\r\nvisible), are the true currents of the storm, and which interlopers from\r\nanother storm? Is the true one always the upper one, and why? If the\r\nupper one, why is the interloper at the surface noted and quoted to prove\r\nwhat a storm is? How does he know what proportions of the winds he has\r\nrecorded to show the revolving motion of gales, were the true storm winds\r\nof the particular storm? or, that every one of them was not an interloping\r\nwind on which the true storm wind was superimposed?\r\n\r\nThese inquiries are pertinent, for obviously, unless some rule for\r\ndistinguishing between the currents is given, and there be evidence of\r\ndirect observation to show that the surface wind, whose direction is\r\nnoted, is the true wind of the storm, and that the _latter_ is not\r\n_superimposed_, no reliance can be placed upon logs, or newspaper\r\naccounts, or registers. There is another element besides direction, viz.:\r\nsuperimposition, a determination of which _is_ essential to _truth_. It\r\nwill be difficult for Mr. Redfield to say that a determination of that\r\nelement has been made, with certainty, in a single storm he has\r\ninvestigated; and in relation to the convergence of storms, and blending,\r\nand superimposition of their winds, I think he is mistaken.\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield is right in saying (American Journal of Science, vol. ii.,\r\nnew series, p. 321) that \"too much reliance may be placed upon mere\r\nobservations of the surface winds in meteorological inquiries,\" and yet\r\n_they_ only have thus far been regarded, and he has proved gyration in no\r\nother way. I have frequently, with a vane in sight, asked intelligent men\r\nhow the wind was, and been amused and instructed by their inability to\r\nstate it correctly. Mr. Redfield, in his inquiries, often found two\r\nreports of the weather at the _same time_, from the _same place_,\r\nmaterially different; and I have known, from my own observation,\r\nnewspapers and meteorological registers to be several points out of the\r\nway; and this, because the vanes are influenced by local elevations, and\r\nchange several points, and very often; because few know the exact points\r\nof the compass in their own localities, and because entire accuracy has\r\nnot been deemed essential. For these reasons, newspaper and telegraphic\r\nreports are not always reliable; and therefore, and because, also,\r\nstorm-winds are easterly and fair winds westerly, and the former veer from\r\neast around to west, on one or both sides in many cases, there are few\r\nstorms which can not be represented as whirlwinds, by a proper _selection_\r\nof _reports_, a corresponding _location_ of the _center_, and an\r\n_extension_ of the lines of supposed gyration, so as to include the\r\n_preceding_ winds, the actual winds of the storm, and the _lateral_, and\r\n_succeeding_ fair weather ones.\r\n\r\nBut, again, Mr. Redfield is right in saying there is, in such cases, \"an\r\nextended stratum of stratus cloud,\" and it is always present. But why does\r\nhe say this _covers the storm_? Is it distinct from it, and if so, what is\r\nit doing there? What power placed it there, and for what purpose? Has this\r\nextended stratum of cloud, which forms the canopy of a vast chamber--five\r\nhundred to one thousand miles in diameter, and less than two miles in\r\nvertical depth, while the earth forms the floor--any agency in producing\r\nthe whirl that is supposed to be going on within it, and if so, what? Has\r\nthe earth any agency, and if so, what? If neither the ceiling nor floor of\r\nthe chamber have any agency in producing it, what does? Are we to consider\r\nthe _storm-scud_ as possessing the power, and as waltzing around the\r\naerial chamber, carrying the air with them in a hurricane-dance of\r\ndevastation? _What, in short, is the power, and how is it exerted?_\r\n\r\nTo these questions, Mr. Redfield's essays furnish no comprehensive answer.\r\nThere is an intimation that the cause of storms will be, at some future\r\nday, developed. One attempt, and but one, has thus far been made, and that\r\nI quote entire:\r\n\r\n     \"We have seen that the two Cuba storms, as well as the Mexican\r\n     northers, have appeared to come from the contiguous border of the\r\n     Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, are there any peculiarities in the winds and aerial currents of\r\n     those regions, which may serve to induce or support a leftwise\r\n     rotation in extensive portions of the lower atmosphere, while moving\r\n     on, or near the earth's surface? I apprehend there are such\r\n     peculiarities, which have an extensive, constant, and powerful\r\n     influence. First, we find on the eastern portion of the Pacific, from\r\n     upper California to near the Bay of Panama, an almost constant\r\n     prevalence of north-westerly winds at the earth's surface. Next, we\r\n     have an equally constant wind from the southern and south-western\r\n     quarter, which, having swept the western coast of South America,\r\n     _extends across the equator to the vicinity of Panama_, thus meeting,\r\n     and commonly over-sliding the above-mentioned westerly winds, and\r\n     tending to a deflection or rotation of the same, from right to left.\r\n     As this influence may thus become extended to the Caribbean or\r\n     Honduras Sea, we have, next, the upper or S. E. trade of this sea,\r\n     which is here frequently a surface-wind, and must tend to aid and\r\n     quicken the gyrative movement, ascribed to the two previous winds;\r\n     and lastly we have the N. E. or lower trade, from the tropic, which,\r\n     coinciding with the northern front of the gyration, serves still\r\n     further to promote the revolving movement which may thus result from\r\n     the partial coalescence of these great winds of Central America, and\r\n     the contiguous seas.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, while a great storm is, in part, on the Pacific Ocean, its N.\r\n     E. wind may be felt in great force on that side of the continent,\r\n     through the great gorges or depressions near the bays of Papagayo or\r\n     Tehuantepec, as noticed by Humboldt, Captain Basil Hall, and others,\r\n     the elevations which there separate the two seas being but\r\n     inconsiderable; and, when the gyration is once perfected, the whole\r\n     mass will gradually assume the movement of the predominant current,\r\n     which is generally the higher one, and will move off with it,\r\n     integrally, as we see in the cases of the vortices, which are\r\n     successively found in particular portions of a stream, where subject\r\n     to disturbing influences.\"\r\n\r\nThe analogy between this and the theory of Professor Dove, cited above,\r\nand prior, in point of time, is obvious. They are substantially alike in\r\nprinciple, with different locations. They differ also in this, Professor\r\nDove appears to think something more than over-sliding necessary, and\r\nassigns the duty of crowding the upper current down in to the lower, to\r\nmake an _encounter_, to a lateral overflow from Africa. Mr. Redfield seems\r\nto think there may be a tendency to deflection when they \"over-slide\" each\r\nother. They are both closet hypotheses, the poetry of meteorology, with\r\nsomething more than poetical license as to facts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, _no such concurring winds exist in the same locality\r\nat the same time_. When the inter-tropical belt of rains is over Central\r\nAmerica and Southern Mexico, a S. W. monsoon blows in under it, but it\r\nusurps the place of all other surface winds; and, when the belt is absent,\r\nthat portion of the eastern Pacific is most remarkably calm, or is covered\r\nby the N. E. trades. Secondly, the _trade-winds every where pursue their\r\nappointed course without \"tendency to deflection\" by the meeting, or\r\n\"over-sliding,\" or \"breaking in,\" or \"encounter,\"_ of other winds. The\r\ngreat laws of circulation do not admit of any such _confusion_. And,\r\nlastly, _no storm ever came over the eastern United States from that\r\nquarter_. The unchangeable laws of atmospheric circulation forbid it.\r\nRecent observations also have shown that the storms on the west coast of\r\nCentral America, and the eastern Pacific, pursue a N. W. course, precisely\r\nas in the West Indies, and every where over the surface-trades of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Indeed _Mr. Redfield himself has recently\r\ninvestigated several of them, and admits their course to be\r\nnorth-westerly_. (See American Journal of Science, new series, vol. xviii.\r\np. 181.)\r\n\r\nBut, suppose the co-existence of the winds and the course of the storms\r\nadmitted as claimed, let us seek for clearer views. What do these\r\ngentlemen mean? Do they intend to have us believe the air has inherent\r\nmoving power, and that the \"tendency\" of which they speak is an attribute\r\nof the winds, and that when they thus meet, and \"come into each other,\"\r\n\"encounter,\" or \"over-slide,\" and become acquainted, they wheel into a\r\nwaltz, and move off northward, \"integrally,\" with unceasing circular\r\nmovement, even until they arrive at the Arctic circle? Or is it a mere\r\nmechanical effect of meeting, \"coming into each other,\" or \"over-sliding?\"\r\nIf the latter, why a tendency to rotation from right to left? The\r\ntrade-winds, at least, are _continuous, unbroken sheets_, and not\r\ndisconnected portions which meet and blow past each other, and there is no\r\nwarrant for placing them _side and side_, and attributing to them any\r\nsuch mechanical effect, and as little respecting the other winds. Outside\r\nof the fanciful hypothesis, there are no facts to show such a tendency one\r\nway rather than the other; and, in accordance with the known facts\r\nregarding stratification of the currents of air, no such \"tendency\" can\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nBut what _power_ impels the winds, which thus meet at these points? If\r\nthey be impelled, is it consistent with the action of this power that the\r\n_winds_ it has _created_ and _controls_, should thus assume an _opposite\r\n\"tendency,\"_ and whirl away to the north-eastward, regardless of the power\r\nthat originated and controls them? What must this \"_tendency_\" be, which\r\nthus _occasionally_ not only diverts the winds from the _usually regular\r\ncourse_ given them by their originating power, but increases their action,\r\nfrom gentle, ordinary winds, to hurricanes? Nay, which gives them a new,\r\nresistless gyratory and electric energy, increasing as the new,\r\nindependent, supposed cyclonic organization moves off, \"_integrally_,\"\r\naway from \"the home of its many fathers,\" on a devastating journey towards\r\nthe north pole?\r\n\r\nAnd, further, if all this were true as to the West Indies and Central\r\nAmerica, what is to be said of the billions of other storms, originating\r\non a thousand other portions of the earth's surface, and how are they to\r\nbe accounted for, inasmuch as such other \"meetings,\" \"coming into each\r\nother,\" and \"over-sliding,\" and \"tendency to deflection,\" is not assumed\r\nto exist?\r\n\r\nThese questions cannot be satisfactorily answered. The distinguished\r\ntheorists are mistaken. The stratus-cloud does not over-lie or cover the\r\nstorm. IT IS THE STORM. The winds beneath, whether surface or\r\nsuperimposed, are but its incidents, due to its static induction and\r\nattraction. Their _direction_ depends on the shape of the storm cloud, and\r\nits course of progression, and the susceptibility of the surface\r\natmosphere in this direction or that, to its inductive and attractive\r\ninfluence. Their _force_ to its depth, its contiguity to the earth, and\r\nthe intensity of its action; and the scud, are but patches of\r\ncondensation, occasioned by the same inductive action which affects and\r\nattracts the surface current in which they form.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to Mr. Redfield's theory of gyration is based upon the\r\nfact that in order to constitute his _storm_, to get the _gyration_, he\r\nhas to include, at least, an equal amount, generally a great deal more, of\r\n_fair weather_. The N. W. wind, the \"posterior, or dry side of the gale,\"\r\nas he calls it (in the foregoing extract), is a _fair weather wind_. It is\r\n_necessary_, however, to complete the supposed _circle_, and it is\r\n_pressed into the service_. The practical answer given to the question,\r\n\"_what are storms?_\" is, they are cyclones, part storm, so called, and\r\n_part fair weather_; that is, the stratus-cloud, the scud, the easterly\r\nwind, and rain or snow of day before yesterday, were the _wet side_, or\r\nfront part of the storm, and the sunshine, clear sky, and N. W. wind of\r\nyesterday, to-day, and, perhaps, to-morrow, are the posterior or dry side.\r\nWhen a storm clears off from the N. W. it is not _over_, it is, perhaps,\r\n_just begun_; and, inasmuch as it storms again, very soon after the wind\r\nchanges back from the N. W. to the southward, in winter, our weather then\r\nis pretty much all _storms_.\r\n\r\nThe statement of this claim seems so absurd that it may appear like\r\ninjustice to make it. But gyration can not be made out without it, and it\r\nis evident in the extract quoted above; in the claim that the winter\r\nnorthers of the Mexican Gulf are parts of passing storms; and clearly and\r\nunequivocally advanced as a distinct proposition, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. The body of the gale usually comprises an area of rain or foul\r\nweather, together with another, and, perhaps equal, or greater, area of\r\nfair or bright weather.\" (Am. Jour. of Science, vol. xlii. p. 114.)\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, we must distinguish between a storm and fair\r\nweather, before we can tell what the former is, and it is difficult to\r\nassent to a theory which explains what a S. E. storm of _twelve hours'_\r\ncontinuance is, by including _two or three days of succeeding N. W. fair\r\nweather wind_, as a part of it. There is no proportionate relation as to\r\n_time_, nor any relation as to _qualities_, or the attending conditions of\r\nthe atmosphere, nor any conceivable _connection_, except the hypothetical\r\none of _gyration_, between the two winds.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the second place, it is true, and Mr. Redfield is well aware of\r\nthe fact, that winds often blow for many days from the N. E., S. W., or N.\r\nW., without any preceding or succeeding winds to which they have any\r\ndiscoverable relation. If, therefore, truth would justify Mr. Redfield in\r\nincluding the fair weather wind, a difficulty would remain which his\r\ntheory does not cover or explain.\r\n\r\nNo American, except Mr. Redfield, has been able to discover satisfactory\r\nevidence of the gyration of storms, by actual careful observation, or a\r\ncareful unbiased collation of the observation of others. Professor Coffin\r\nis reported to have read to the Scientific Association, at their Buffalo\r\nmeeting, a paper, confirmatory, in part, but I have not been able to see\r\nit. The tracks of tornados have been searched as with candles. When they\r\nhave been narrow, from forty to eighty rods, their action has been\r\nsubstantially similar, and, although, as we have herein before stated,\r\nsome irregularities have been found which were consistent with\r\ngyration--for irregularities attend the violent action of all forces, and\r\nparticularly the motion of electricity through the atmosphere, as every\r\none who has seen the zig-zag course of a flash of lightning knows--yet the\r\nevidence of two lateral inward currents, or lines of force, has\r\npredominated over all others. In all cases, where the path is narrow,\r\nthose lateral currents are the actors; they constitute the tornado; their\r\n_irregularities_ of action produce the exceptions; but the exceptions are\r\nneither numerous nor uniform, and do not prove either the theory of Mr.\r\nEspy or that of Mr. Redfield. The action is not that of moving air,\r\nmerely, but of a power exceeding in force that of powder, which nothing\r\nbut electricity or magnetism can exert. As the path widens, the wind\r\nbecomes more like the straight-line gust which follows beneath the\r\nordinary severe thunder-showers. His theory finds no substantial\r\nconfirmation or support in the path of the tornado.\r\n\r\nSeveral storms were investigated by Professor Espy, some of them the same\r\nwhich Mr. Redfield had attempted to show were of a rotary character; one\r\nor two by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia; one by Professor Loomis,\r\nalready alluded to; and recently, two by Lieutenant Porter, from logs\r\nreturned to the National Observatory. None of these investigations confirm\r\nthe theory of Mr. Redfield. Indeed, Mr. Redfield himself has found it\r\nnecessary to resort to suppositions of _modifying causes_ to explain the\r\nevident inconsistencies. It is assumed that the axis, or center,\r\noscillates, and describes a series of circles; and thus, one class of\r\ndifficulties is avoided. Again, it is assumed that simultaneous storms\r\nconverge and blend upon the same field, and another class of difficulties\r\nare surmounted. And, again, inasmuch as it is notorious that violent gales\r\nare rarely if ever felt with equal violence around the area of a circle,\r\nbut from one or two points only, it is assumed, that the storm winds\r\nascend, superimpose, and descend again, when they return to the place of\r\ntheir first violent action, etc. The _simple truth_ requires no such\r\nresort to _modifying hypothesis_.\r\n\r\nStill, another objection is, that the changes in the barometer, which\r\noccur before, during, and after storms, do not sustain the claims of Mr.\r\nRedfield or the requirements of his theory.\r\n\r\nThe barometer sometimes rises before storms. It generally commences\r\nfalling about the time, or soon after the storm sets in, continues to fall\r\nduring its progress, and rises again, sooner or later, afterward. This is\r\nthe general rule.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Mr. Redfield's claim is this:\r\n\r\n     \"EFFECT OF THE GALE'S ROTATION ON THE BAROMETER.--The extraordinary\r\n     fall of the mercury in the barometer, which takes place in gales or\r\n     tempests, has attracted attention since the earliest use of this\r\n     instrument by meteorologists. But I am not aware that the principal\r\n     cause of this depression had ever been pointed out, previously to my\r\n     first publication in this journal, in April, 1831, when I took the\r\n     occasion to notice this result as being obviously due to the\r\n     _centrifugal force_ of the revolving motion found in the body of the\r\n     storm.\r\n\r\n     \"Since that period, inquiries have been continued by meteorologists\r\n     in regard to the periodical and other fluctuations of the barometer,\r\n     and the relations of these fluctuations to temperature and aqueous\r\n     vapor. But these incidental causes of variation, in the atmospheric\r\n     pressure, prove to be of minor influence, and we are left to the\r\n     sufficient and only satisfactory solution of this marked phenomenon\r\n     which is found in the centrifugal force of rotation.\"\r\n\r\nThe average pressure of the atmosphere, at the surface of the ocean, or in\r\nthe interior of the country, allowing for elevation, is about equal to the\r\nweight of a column of quicksilver, thirty inches in height; hence the\r\nbarometer is said to stand at about thirty inches at the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficiently accurate for the northern hemisphere, north of the N.\r\nE. trades; but the average is somewhat lower in the trades and in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Thus, the average of sixteen months, during which the\r\nGrinnell expedition was absent, was 30.08/100.\r\n\r\nFrom a large number of logs examined by Lieutenant Maury, the mean\r\nelevation in the N. E. trades of the Atlantic was 29.97/100; the S. E.\r\ntrades of the Atlantic, 29.93/100; off Cape Horn, 29.23/100; S. E. trades\r\nof the Pacific, 30.05/100; N. E. trades of the Pacific, 29.96/100. The\r\nheight of the barometer off Cape Horn is not a fair index of the general\r\nelevation of the southern hemisphere, inasmuch as it stands lower there\r\nthan at the coast of Patagonia and Chili, or at most, if not all, other\r\nstations in that hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAs the barometer is constantly oscillating up and down (irrespective of\r\nits diurnal oscillation), it has no known fair weather standard. The point\r\nof 30 inches is taken only as it is a mean. I have known it to commence\r\nstorming when the barometer was at 30.70, and not to fall before it\r\ncleared off, below 30.30. And I have known it to be below 30 for several\r\ndays consecutively, with fair weather. In our climate there is no reliable\r\nfair weather standard for the barometer. It falls below 30 without\r\nstorming; it rises far above, and storms without falling below. No\r\nreliance can be placed upon its elevation, except by comparison; but of\r\nthat hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe general rule, nevertheless, is, that it falls more or less during\r\nstorms, whatever its height, and rises sooner or later, more or less,\r\nafter they clear off.\r\n\r\nThe difference between its highest and lowest points is called its range.\r\nThe greatest range observed, and recorded, is about 3 inches--from about\r\n28 to 31--but this range is rare. The range, in the trade-wind region, is\r\ncomparatively small; in this country it is greater than in Europe; and,\r\ngenerally, the range will be found greatest where the volume of\r\ncounter-trade, and magnetic intensity, and the corresponding amount of\r\nprecipitation, and extremes of heat and cold are greatest. One of the\r\ngreatest ranges during one storm, or two successive portions of a storm,\r\nin this country, which I have seen recorded, occurred at Boston, in\r\nFebruary, 1842. It was as follows--counting the hours as 24, and from\r\nmidnight:\r\n\r\n  Feb. 15..10h..30.36.\r\n   \"   16..13h..28.47 fall of 1.89 in 27 hours.\r\n   \"   17..19h..30.39 rise of 1.92 in 30 hours.\r\n   \"   18.. 2h..30.39 stationary       5 hours.\r\n   \"   19.. 2h..29.46 fall of 0.93 in 24 hours.\r\n   \"   20.. 2h..30.43 rise of 0.97 in 24 hours.\r\n    Amount of oscillation, 5.71 in 4 days, 11 hours.\r\n\r\nThese ranges were owing to the alternation of S. E. storms, and N. W.\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nTaking the first range as a basis, and allowing the height of the\r\natmosphere to be 1,100 feet for the first inch, we have nearly 2,000 feet\r\ndisplaced during one day, if we look for the displacement near the earth,\r\nor some 30 or 35 miles, if we soar aloft in the upper regions to look for\r\nthe _lateral overflow_ of Professor Dove, and about the same quantity\r\nrestored the next. This brings us to the inquiry, how was it done? It is\r\nperfectly idle to talk about _difference_ of _temperature_ or _tension_ of\r\n_vapor_, the _ascent_ of warm air, or _descent_ of cold in a case like\r\nthis; or to say that they were occasioned by a lateral overflow of some\r\nthirty miles of its upper portion, first this way and then that, in such a\r\nbrief space of time. The change is equal to nearly 1/15 of the weight of\r\nthe whole atmosphere, and the cause, whatever it was, existed within two\r\nor three miles of the earth. Mr. Redfield's explanation I give in his own\r\nwords, at length:\r\n\r\n     \"One of the most important deductions which may be drawn from the\r\n     facts and explications which are now submitted, is an explanation of\r\n     the causes which produce the fall of the barometer on the approach of\r\n     a storm. This effect we ascribe to the centrifugal tendency or action\r\n     which pertains to all revolving or rotary movements, and which must\r\n     operate with great energy and effect upon so extensive a mass of\r\n     atmosphere as that which constitutes a storm. Let a cylindrical\r\n     vessel, of any considerable magnitude, be partially filled with\r\n     water, and let the rotative motion be communicated to the fluid, by\r\n     passing a rod repeatedly through its mass, in a circular course. In\r\n     conducting this experiment, we shall find that the surface of the\r\n     fluid immediately becomes depressed by the centrifugal action, except\r\n     on its exterior portions, where, owing merely to the resistance which\r\n     is opposed by the sides of the vessel, it will rise above its natural\r\n     level, the fluid exhibiting the character of a miniature vortex or\r\n     whirlpool. Let this experiment be carefully repeated, by passing the\r\n     propelling rod around the exterior of the fluid mass, in continued\r\n     contact with the sides of the vessel, thus producing the whole\r\n     rotative impulse, by an external force, analagous to that which we\r\n     suppose to influence the gyration of storms and hurricanes, and we\r\n     shall still find a corresponding result, beautifully modified,\r\n     however, by the quiescent properties of the fluid; for, instead of\r\n     the deep and rapid vortex before exhibited, we shall have a concave\r\n     depression of the surface, of great regularity: and, by the aid of a\r\n     few suspended particles, may discover the increased degree of\r\n     rotation, which becomes gradually imparted to the more central\r\n     portions of the revolving fluid. The last-mentioned result obviates\r\n     the objection, which, at the first view, might, perhaps, be\r\n     considered as opposed to our main conclusion, grounded on the\r\n     supposed equability of rotation, in both the interior and exterior\r\n     portions of the revolving body, like that which pertains to a wheel,\r\n     or other solid. It is most obvious, however, that all fluid masses\r\n     are, in their gyrations, subject to a different law, as is\r\n     exemplified in the foregoing experiment; and this difference, or\r\n     departure from the law of solids, is doubtless greater in aeriform\r\n     fluids than in those of a denser character.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole experiment serves to demonstrate that such an active\r\n     gyration as we have ascribed to storms, and have proved, as we deem,\r\n     to appertain to some, at least, of the more violent class; must\r\n     necessarily expand and spread out, _by its centrifugal action, the\r\n     stratum of atmosphere subject to its influence, and which must,\r\n     consequently, become flattened or depressed by this lateral movement,\r\n     particularly toward the vortex or center of the storm_; lessening\r\n     thereby the weight of the incumbent fluid, and producing a consequent\r\n     fall of the mercury in the barometrical tube. This effect must\r\n     increase, till the gravity of the circumjacent atmosphere, superadded\r\n     to that of the storm itself, shall, by its counteracting effect, have\r\n     produced an equilibrium in the two forces. Should there be no\r\n     overlaying current in the higher regions, moving in a direction\r\n     different from that which contains the storm, the rotative effect\r\n     may, perhaps, be extended into the region of perpetual congelation,\r\n     till the medium becomes too rare to receive its influence. But\r\n     whatever may be the limit of this gyration, its effect must be to\r\n     _depress_ the _cold stratum_ of the upper atmosphere, particularly\r\n     toward the more central portions of the storm; and, by thus bringing\r\n     it in contact with the humid stratum of the surface, to produce a\r\n     permanent and continuous stratum of clouds, together with a copious\r\n     supply of rain, or a deposition of congelated vapor, according to the\r\n     state of the temperature prevailing in the lower region.\"\r\n\r\nThe italics in the foregoing extract are mine; and, in relation to it, I\r\nobserve:\r\n\r\n1st. There is no cylindrical vessel around storms, and _air will not thus\r\nresist air_. Confessedly, such resistance is necessary. Let any one watch\r\nhis cigar smoke, and see how readily it moves on, with little momentum.\r\nLet any one try the experiment of creating a whirl in the _open air_, or\r\nin a room, or box of paper, or other material, which can be suddenly\r\nremoved, with air colored by smoke. I am exceedingly mistaken if he does\r\nnot find the presence of a \"cylindrical vessel,\" absolutely essential to\r\nprevent the instantaneous tangential escape of the air.\r\n\r\n2d. Turn back to page 3 and look at the fall of the barometer in the polar\r\nregions (recorded in the extract from Dr. Kane), with _scarcely any\r\nwind_, and _as little variation_ in its _direction_, and see how utterly\r\nMr. Redfield's theory fails to account for the phenomena.\r\n\r\n3d. If I understand Mr. Redfield correctly, he has abandoned the claim as\r\noriginally made, that the wind moves in circles, expanding, and _spreading\r\nout_ by a \"_lateral movement_,\" and now asserts that it blows spirally\r\ninward, and elevates the air in the center. I quote:\r\n\r\n     \"VORTICAL INCLINATION OF THE STORM WIND.--By this is meant some\r\n     degree of involution from a true circular course. In the New England\r\n     storm above referred to, this convergence of the surface-winds\r\n     appeared equal to an average of about 6 deg. from a circle. In the\r\n     present case, such indication seems more or less apparent in the\r\n     arrows on the storm figures of the several charts, where the\r\n     concentrical circle afford us means for a just comparison of the\r\n     general course of wind which is approximately shown by the several\r\n     observations.\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps we may estimate the average of the vorticose convergence, as\r\n     observed in the entire storm for three successive days, at from 5 deg. to\r\n     10 deg.--out of the 90 deg. which would be requisite for a congeries of\r\n     _centripetal_ or center-blowing winds. This rough estimate of the\r\n     degree of involution is founded only on a bird's-eye view of the\r\n     plotted observations. But, however estimated, this involution seems\r\n     to afford a measure of the air and vapor which finds its way to a\r\n     _higher elevation_ by means of the vortical movement in the body of\r\n     the storm.\"\r\n\r\nIf the elevation of the air at the borders of the storm, and depression in\r\nthe middle, resulted from the outward tendency and \"lateral movement\" of\r\nthe revolving air, and from the _centrifugal force_, as in the experiment\r\nwith the water in a cylindrical vessel, as stated in the first paragraph\r\nquoted, an _involution_ of from 5 deg. to 10 deg. from the action of a\r\n_centripetal force_, must carry the air _inward_, and the _barometer\r\nshould stand highest in the middle of the storm_. The change is fatal to\r\nhis theory. The two are diametrically opposite in character and effect. In\r\none, the superior strata would be brought down in the center by the\r\n_lateral pressure outward_; in the other, they would be elevated by the\r\n_involution_, which \"affords a measure of the air and vapor which finds\r\nits way to a higher elevation,\" etc. It is perfectly obvious Mr. Redfield\r\nhas refuted his own hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, he is met by the other difficulty alluded to, which he does\r\nnot attempt to explain. This gathering of the air inward, spirally, by a\r\ncentripetal force, if it took place, not only would not depress, but _must\r\nelevate the barometer in the center, above that of the adjoining\r\natmosphere_.\r\n\r\nWhen he first attributed the depression of the barometer to a lateral\r\nmovement and centrifugal force, he supposed the superior strata descended\r\ninto the depression, and their frigidity occasioned the condensation, and\r\ncloud, and rain. How he now proposes to account for the formation of cloud\r\nand rain during storms, while the warm air of the inferior stratum finds\r\nits way to a higher elevation in the center of the storm, he does not\r\ninform us, and we must wait his time.\r\n\r\n     \"I have,\" he says, \"long held the proper inquiry to be, _what are\r\n     storms_? and not, _how are storms produced_? as has been well\r\n     expressed by another. It is only when the former of these inquiries\r\n     has been solved that we can enter advantageously upon the latter.\"\r\n\r\nThe former does not seem to be yet solved, or the solution of the latter\r\ncommenced. Mr. Redfield tells us (page 259, and onward), that there is an\r\nextended stratum of stratus-cloud, which overlies the storm, and that it\r\ndoes not differ greatly from one mile in height. We are not told how the\r\nair, which finds its way to a higher elevation during several days\r\ncontinuance of such a storm, _gets through the stratum_. If he is right it\r\n_must_ do so, and it would not answer to _suppose_ a very small opening or\r\ngentle current through it, to carry off all the air which works inward in\r\na hurricane, during several days continuance. But he does not seem to\r\nrecognize either the necessity or existence of any _vent_ at all; nor is\r\nthere any; and this fact is open to the observation of every school-boy in\r\nthe country; and it is equally open to his observation that _when and\r\nwhere the barometer is most depressed, the stratus storm-cloud is nearest\r\nthe earth_. Colonel Reid has much to say about the \"_storm's eye_,\" or\r\n\"treacherous center\" of a storm. A careful analysis of the instances where\r\nthe \"storm's eye\" is noticed will show that the term is applied, in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, to that lighting up in the W. or N. W., which is the\r\ncommencement of the clearing-off process, and attended with a shift of\r\nwind to the fair-weather quarter: _i. e._, to W. or N. W. Just such an\r\n\"eye\" as is seen when the last of the storm cloud has passed so far to the\r\neast as to admit the rays of the sun under the western or north-western\r\nedge of it. The same kind of \"storm's eye\" is described in the southern\r\nhemisphere, except that the wind shifts to S. W. instead of N. W., that\r\nbeing the clearing-off wind there. No instance of a \"_storm's eye_\" in\r\nthe center of the extended stratum of stratus-cloud, which overlies the\r\nstorm, can be found recorded, to my knowledge; and it is obvious that\r\nColonel Reid adopts the view of Mr. Redfield, that the westerly and N. W.\r\n_fair weather_ winds are a part of the storm. So long as these gentlemen\r\nhold to that opinion they will never solve the question, \"_what are\r\nstorms?_\" or reach the other, \"_how are storms produced?_\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, Mr. Redfield asserts, or adopts the assertion, that the\r\ninquiry should be, \"What are storms?\" not \"How are storms produced?\" that\r\ninquiry should be a _rational_ one, and should not violate all analogy, or\r\ncall for an explanation which science can not _rationally_ furnish. Mr.\r\nRedfield does not seem to have formed any just conception of the\r\n_immeasurable power_ of a hurricane, _five hundred miles in diameter_; or\r\nof the nature of that _rod_ which the _Almighty must insert in it, to\r\nwhirl it with such violent and long-continued force_; nor any just\r\nconception of the tendency of the whirling mass, in the absence of his\r\n\"cylindrical vessel,\" to fly off, tangentially, into the surrounding air;\r\nor of the nature or power of the centripetal force necessary to hold the\r\ngyratory mass in its current, and gather it in involute spirals toward a\r\ncenter. Nor has any other man who has witnessed, or read of\r\nmountain-tossed waves; of the largest ships blown down and engulfed; of\r\ntowns submerged, and vessels carried far inland, and left in cultivated\r\nfields, by the subsidence of the sea; of sturdy forests and strongly-built\r\nedifices prostrated; or listened to the howling of the tempest, and felt\r\nhis own house rock beneath him, been able to conceive of any known form of\r\ncalorific or mechanical, or other power, acting from a comparatively small\r\ncenter, which could hold such an immense irresistable mass of whirling air\r\nin a circle, and _gather it_ in toward the center in gradually contracting\r\nspirals. I confess that, to my mind, it seems little less than a mockery\r\nof our intelligence for Mr. Redfield, or Professor Dove, or any other man,\r\nhow distinguished soever he may be, to tell us that all this is the result\r\nof a \"tendency to left-wise rotation\" of ordinary winds, \"coming into each\r\nother,\" or \"over-sliding,\" or \"meeting,\" or \"encountering,\" on this\r\n\"front,\" or that, down in Central America, or in the West Indies, or the\r\nmonsoon region; or to talk of \"lateral overflows\" from mere gravity; of\r\nthe ascent of warm air, or the descent of cold strata; of the _resistance\r\nof adjacent passive air_, or other mere _atmospheric resistances_ in\r\nconnection with such _awful manifestations of power_. Their explanations\r\nof these phenomena are not rational, nor can they be believed by any\r\nrational man, who will bestow upon them half an hour of _comprehensive,\r\nunbiased reflection_.\r\n\r\nWaiving many minor points of great force, for this notice of Mr.\r\nRedfield's theory is already too much extended for my limits, I am\r\nconstrained to take issue with him on the fact, and to assert,\r\nunhesitatingly, that in a _majority of instances no such barometric curve\r\nexists_.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the depression beneath the storm is found, and exterior lateral\r\nelevations may also be had by _extending the line into the usual fair\r\nweather elevation on each side_, as Mr. Redfield is obliged to do, to get\r\nhis supposed circle of winds at all. Doubtless, too, the seamen sailing\r\nout of a storm, on either _side_, and approaching fair weather, will have\r\na rising barometer. But from _front to rear, on the line of progression_,\r\nin tropical storms, the curve does not exist on shore, in this latitude,\r\noftener than in two, or possibly three, cases in ten; and then only upon a\r\nsingle state of facts--that is, when there is an interposition of N. W.\r\nwind; and this, at some seasons, rarely occurs. An elevation usually\r\noccurs before the storm, on its front, if it present an extensive easterly\r\nfront, as one of these classes does, and a _depression is left_ after it\r\nhas passed off, unless a considerable body of N. W. wind interposes, as\r\nheretofore stated. But when there is not such interposition of N. W. wind\r\n(for W., W. N. W., or even N. W. by W. will not suffice), there is not an\r\nimmediate rise of the barometer corresponding in rapidity and extent with\r\nthe fall, and frequently none during the first twenty-four hours of\r\nbright, fair weather. Let the reader, if he has access to a barometer,\r\nnote this fact, for it is obvious and conclusive.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are other atmospheric conditions to which the barometric\r\nchanges are obviously due:\r\n\r\n1st. The counter-trade is of a different _volume_, at different times,\r\nover the same locality, and hence a difference in the normal elevations of\r\nthe barometer.\r\n\r\n2d. It is at a different _elevation_, at different times, over the same\r\nlocality. It was so found by the investigations of the Kew Observatory\r\nCommittee referred to; has been so found by other aeronauts, and may\r\nreadily be seen by a careful, practiced observer.\r\n\r\nIt is highest, with a high barometer, in serene weather, when a storm is\r\nnot at hand; and can sometimes be plainly seen to ascend when a\r\nconsiderable volume of N. W. wind is blowing in beneath, and elevating,\r\nsimultaneously, the trade and the barometer.\r\n\r\nOpportunities occur every year, when the northern edge of the dissolving\r\nstratus-cloud is attenuated, and the storm is clearing off in the N. W.,\r\nwith wind from that quarter, and a rising barometer, when its gradual\r\nelevation may be observed to correspond with the _volume_ of that wind.\r\n\r\n3d. During storms, with a low barometer, the _trade_ and the _clouds run\r\nlow_. This, too, is clearly observable, especially when the stratus-cloud\r\npasses off abruptly, very soon after the rain ceases. In such cases the\r\nbarometer will remain depressed for a considerable time, unless another\r\nstorm supervenes speedily, or the wind sets in from the N. W.\r\n\r\n4th. The _trade, in a stormy state, moves faster_ than when in a normal\r\ncondition. This is observable during the partial breaks which frequently\r\noccur in storms, and at other times. It is also inferable from the more\r\nrapid progress of the more intense center, and other intense portions of\r\nstorms, and the consequent greater depression of the barometer, under such\r\ncenters or intense portions. (See the storm of Professor Loomis.) It is\r\nobvious, also, from the greater rapidity of progress attending the more\r\nintense and violent storms which all investigations discloses.\r\n\r\nThese simple facts explain all the phenomena:\r\n\r\n1st. The trade stratum is a continuous unbroken sheet, and its descent\r\nmust displace a portion of the surface atmosphere. A portion of it is\r\nimpelled forward, aiding in the precedent elevation of the barometer, and\r\na portion is attracted backward, into the space from which a like portion\r\nhad been previously attracted by the passing storm cloud, forming the\r\neasterly wind.\r\n\r\n2d. The increased progress of the stormy portion of the counter-trade\r\noccasions an accumulation in front of the storm, and an elevation of the\r\nbarometer, and tends also to increase the _depression_ under the spot from\r\nwhich it moves. The latter is, to some extent, counteracted by the thin\r\nsheets of surface wind which are drawn in under the stratus from the\r\nsides. That which is drawn from the front in successive portions, fills\r\nthe space from which like portions had been drawn to the westward, and\r\nleft behind in a passive state by the passing storm. Thus, the surface\r\natmosphere of New England may pass under the entire width of a storm, as a\r\ngale; moving now in puffs with great violence, as it passes beneath\r\nirregular and intense portions of the cloud, and now moderately; and be\r\nleft, in a passive state, in Kentucky, occupying the space from which the\r\natmosphere had been previously drawn by the same storm, _in like manner_,\r\non to northern Texas.\r\n\r\n3d. The nearer the stratus-cloud to the earth, the greater the\r\ndisplacement of surface atmosphere, the lower the barometer, and,\r\nordinarily, the more violent the wind. First, because the same intensity,\r\nwhich, by attraction, brings the trade near the earth, acts with greater\r\nforce upon the surface atmosphere; and, secondly, the storm winds, which\r\nare often most rapid beneath the clouds and above the earth, are likely to\r\nbe felt with more violence at its surface, where the stratus cloud runs\r\nlow, especially at sea.\r\n\r\nI desire to commend all these facts, in relation to the theory of Mr.\r\nRedfield, to the careful attention and observation of those who, although\r\nbelievers in the theory, are not wedded to it; and who have a sincere\r\ndesire to understand the phenomena which are continually, and thus far,\r\n_mysteriously_, occurring within two or three miles of us, while our\r\nknowledge of the distant worlds around us--the science of astronomy--seems\r\nalmost perfect.\r\n\r\nI will return to a further and a careful consideration of the nature of\r\nthe reciprocal action between the earth and the counter-trade, and the\r\nfacts bearing upon the question, in another chapter. It is obvious that\r\nreceived theories can not aid us materially in the inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are yet ignorant of the true nature of magnetism. We trace its lines,\r\nas in the diagrams, upon and around the magnet; but we can only do this\r\nwith soft iron, or other substance, in which magnetic action may be\r\ninduced. We know that these lines are currents, or lines of force, for\r\nthat force produces sensible effects, and we measure it by the movements\r\nof the needle. We know that these lines may be _deflected_ by other\r\nmagnetic bodies, and concentrated upon them. We know that the earth, and\r\nthe smallest magnets, exhibit properties in common. The poles of the\r\nmagnet are some distance from its extreme ends--so are those of the earth.\r\nThe intensity increases, from the center, or near it, to the poles of the\r\nmagnet, as shown by its attraction; and the same increase of magnetic\r\nintensity, from the magnetic equator to the magnetic poles, or near them,\r\nis traced upon the earth.\r\n\r\nWe know that there are two lines, or rather _areas_, of greater intensity\r\nupon the globe. One extending from the American magnetic pole,\r\nsouth-eastwardly, to a corresponding pole in the southern hemisphere; and\r\nanother, the Asiatic, extending from the Siberian pole to a corresponding\r\nsouthern one, in like manner. We know that, from those lines or areas,\r\nthe intensity, east and west, on the same parallel of latitude, decreases\r\neach way, to about midway between them. Thus, calling the intensity where\r\nHumboldt found the magnetic equator over South America, in 7 deg. 1' south\r\nlatitude, 1, or unity--the least intensity known is, .706, found at the\r\nmagnetic equator, over the South Atlantic, and at its most southern\r\ndepression; and it increases to 1.4 in the West Indies, and to 2.0099 upon\r\none or more points of the North American continent, south of the magnetic\r\npole, and about the meridian of 92 deg.. That it is 1.805, at Warren, Ohio, in\r\nlatitude 41 deg. 16', and longitude 72 deg. 57', and decreases to 1.774 at New\r\nHaven, Connecticut, in latitude 41 deg. 18'. That it is but 1.348 at Paris,\r\nnearly one third less than on the same latitude in some portions of this\r\ncontinent. That the line of equal intensity, or \"_iso-dynamic_\" line, of\r\n1-8/10, is a closed curve of an oval shape, extending somewhat below 40 deg.,\r\nin the longitude of Cincinnati, and reaches off nearly to Bhering's\r\nStraits, on the west; rising in a similar manner, though not so abruptly,\r\non the east; including the great northern lakes and a considerable part of\r\nHudson's Bay. While the iso-dynamic lines of 1-85/100, and 1-875/1000, are\r\nsmaller ovals, included within the former. Such, at least, is the present\r\nbelief from such investigations as have been made. (See an article by\r\nProfessor Loomis, American Journal of Science, new series, vol. iv. p.\r\n192.)\r\n\r\nOur subject demands a still closer examination of the elements of\r\nmagnetism and its associated electricities, and their influence upon\r\nclimate and the atmosphere with a view to the solution of the questions in\r\nhand, and we will pursue the inquiry in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nWaiving, for the present, any further notice of the fact that the\r\ncounter-trades are concentrated over, and contiguous to, this area of\r\nintensity, for the purpose of examining the magnetic phenomena\r\nindependently, and intending to return to a consideration of their\r\nconnection with it, we observe:--That it is now well settled that the\r\niso-geothermal lines, or lines of equal terrestrial heat, are coincident,\r\nor nearly so, with the lines of equal magnetic intensity. The points where\r\nthe magnetic intensity is at a minimum, on the magnetic meridian, are the\r\nwarmest points of that meridian, and those where it is most intense, the\r\ncoldest.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic elements of a place may be computed from its thermal ones.\r\nThe laws producing or governing the distribution of one, have an intimate\r\nphysical relation with those producing or governing the other. Professor\r\nNorton ably sums up a discussion of the subject (in the American Journal\r\nof Science for September, 1847), omitting the theoretic propositions, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"1. All the magnetic elements of any place on the earth may be\r\n     deduced from the thermal elements of the same; and all the great\r\n     features of the distribution of the earth's magnetism may be\r\n     theoretically derived from certain prominent features in the\r\n     distribution of its heat.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Of the magnetic elements, the horizontal intensity is nearly\r\n     proportional to the mean temperature, as measured by Fahrenheit's\r\n     thermometer; the vertical intensity is nearly proportional to the\r\n     difference between the mean temperatures, at two points situated at\r\n     equal distances north and south of the place, in a direction\r\n     perpendicular to the iso-geothermal line; and, in general, the\r\n     direction of the needle is nearly at right angles to the\r\n     iso-geothermal line, while the precise course of the inflected line\r\n     to which it is perpendicular may be deduced from Brewster's formula\r\n     for the temperature, by differentiating and putting the differential\r\n     equal to zero.\r\n\r\n     \"3. As a consequence, the laws of the terrestrial distribution of the\r\n     physical principles of magnetism and heat must be the same, or nearly\r\n     the same; and these principles themselves must have, toward one\r\n     another, the most intimate physical relations.\"\r\n\r\nThe magnetic elements, of which Professor Norton speaks, are the\r\ndeclination, dip, and horizontal and vertical forces or intensities.\r\n\r\nI have said, that toward the areas of greatest magnetic intensity, the\r\nneedle every where declines. So as intensity increases, from the magnetic\r\nequator toward the poles, the needle, when so suspended as to permit of\r\nthe motion, _dips_, inclines downward, and the dip is greatest, on the\r\nsame parallel, where intensity is greatest. To my mind, the magnetic\r\nelements are very intelligible. They are all attributable to attraction,\r\nand attraction is greatest where intensity is greatest. There is nothing\r\nin the earth or atmosphere to make the needle point northerly rather than\r\nin any other direction, except magnetic intensity. Thus, the greater\r\nintensity of magnetism near the northern and southern points of the globe,\r\nattracts the corresponding ends of the needle in those directions. And, as\r\nmagnetism increases in quantity or intensity, and the poles are\r\napproached, the attraction increases, and the needle dips more and more,\r\ntill the focus of intensity and attraction is reached, and then it becomes\r\nperpendicular. So magnetism is unequally diffused, meridionally, in or\r\nover the earth, and there are two equidistant areas where its quantity or\r\nintensity is greatest. These exert a lateral attraction upon the needle;\r\nit yields to this attraction, and hence its declination. If it is carried\r\non to one area of intensity, and to the center of it, it will point to the\r\nnorthern focus of intensity or magnetic pole; and, if carried a trifle\r\nfurther west, it will yield to an eastern attraction, and point directly\r\nnorth. If carried still further west, its declination _east_ will\r\nincrease. Thus its normal direction is to the pole, on the central focus\r\nof intensity, and when it points directly north it is west of the central\r\nline of intensity. And thus, it seems to me, all the magnetic elements may\r\nbe resolved into the one element of attraction by excess of intensity or\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThis impression is strengthened by the fact that the needle moves to the\r\neast in the morning, when the solar rays increase magnetic activity in\r\nthat direction, and west again, as their influence increases there.\r\n\r\nNow, these elements--the declination and horizontal and vertical\r\nforces--all these periodical, regular, and irregular variations of\r\nmagnetic activity, are intimately connected with the variations of\r\natmospheric condition:\r\n\r\nFirst, They show an increase of activity during certain hours of the day,\r\ncorresponding to, and obviously connected with, the diurnal atmospheric\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nSecond, They show an increase of activity during the northern transit of\r\nthe atmospheric machinery--an _annual_ variation.\r\n\r\nThird, They show an increase in that activity during the latter portion of\r\neach decennial period, conforming to the occurrence of solar spots.\r\n\r\nAnd, fourth, _Irregular variations_ of activity, corresponding with the\r\n_irregular changes_ of atmospheric condition.\r\n\r\nWe will examine these results, and in doing so, take those of the element\r\nof declination--one answering for all.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic needle moves to the west in summer, from about 8 A.M. till\r\nabout 2 P.M., and the extent of its progress, during that period,\r\nconstitutes the magnitude of its daily variation. It is found that this\r\nvariation differs in different months, and that it is normally greatest in\r\nthe summer months, and least in the winter, in the ratio of about two to\r\none. It is further found, that in different years the maximum activity\r\noccurs in different months, and that the years differ also, and there is a\r\ndistinctly marked decennial period, corresponding most remarkably with the\r\ndecennial maxima of recurring solar spots, as observed by Schwabe. Dr.\r\nLamont, of Munich, gives us the following table of magnitude of\r\ndeclination there, for the ten years preceding 1851, which clearly\r\nexhibits this fact, and also the greater intensity during the northern\r\ntransit of the atmospheric machinery. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"The magnitude of the variations of declination have a period of ten\r\n     years. For five years there is a uniform increase, and during the\r\n     following five years a uniform decrease in the variations. With us\r\n     the magnetic declination is a minimum at about eight o'clock in the\r\n     morning, and is greatest at two o'clock in the afternoon. Subtracting\r\n     the declination at eight o'clock from that at two o'clock, we obtain\r\n     _the magnitude of the diurnal motion_. From the hourly observations,\r\n     conducted in this observatory since the month of August, 1840, we\r\n     ascertain the following to be the magnitude of the diurnal motion for\r\n     each month separately.\"\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |      | Jan. | Feb. | March.| April.| May.  | June. | July. | Aug. |\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  | 1841 | 3.72 | 5.13 |  8.43 | 11.49 | 11.47 | 11.49 | 10.07 |  9.86|\r\n  | 1842 | 3.65 | 4.74 |  8.34 | 10.33 |  9.31 |  9.78 |  8.38 |  9.03|\r\n  | 1843 | 3.82 | 4.08 |  6.87 |  9.71 |  9.24 | 10.14 |  9.57 | 10.08|\r\n  | 1844 | 2.81 | 3.43 |  6.95 |  9.53 |  8.42 |  8.88 |  8.38 |  9.28|\r\n  | 1845 | 2.20 | 4.69 |  8.26 | 11.93 | 10.88 | 10.73 |  9.44 | 10.42|\r\n  | 1846 | 3.30 | 6.94 |  9.53 | 12.27 | 12.58 | 11.21 | 11.37 | 11.49|\r\n  | 1847 | 3.30 | 6.35 |  9.85 | 12.43 | 11.81 | 11.76 | 10.94 | 12.87|\r\n  | 1848 | 6.52 | 9.01 | 11.96 | 14.56 | 14.22 | 13.80 | 14.67 | 15.40|\r\n  | 1849 | 7.27 | 8.42 | 14.08 | 16.86 | 13.67 | 13.86 | 12.57 | 11.54|\r\n  | 1850 | 5.98 | 8.84 | 12.15 | 14.32 | 14.05 | 13.39 | 12.53 | 12.68|\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n         +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n         | Sept. |  Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Autmn | Spring| Year.|\r\n         |       |       |      |      |& Wint.| & Sum.|      |\r\n         |----------------------------------------------------|\r\n         |  8.78 |  6.82 | 3.71 | 2.89 | 5.12  | 10.53 |  7.82|\r\n         |  7.72 |  7.05 | 3.86 | 2.81 | 5.07  |  9.09 |  7.03|\r\n         |  8.81 |  6.82 | 3.82 | 2.79 | 4.70  |  9.59 |  7.15|\r\n         |  8.23 |  6.54 | 3.94 | 2.98 | 4.44  |  8.79 |  6.61|\r\n         |  8.82 |  7.34 | 4.49 | 8.34 | 5.89  | 10.87 |  8.13|\r\n         | 10.39 |  7.82 | 5.66 | 3.22 | 6.08  | 11.25 |  8.81|\r\n         | 12.06 | 11.53 | 7.06 | 4.70 | 7.63  | 11.98 |  9.55|\r\n         | 14.00 | 10.30 | 5.78 | 3.53 | 7.85  | 14.44 | 11.05|\r\n         | 10.79 |  9.12 | 5.41 | 4.09 | 8.06  | 13.21 | 10.64|\r\n         | 12.64 |  9.04 | 6.20 | 3.45 | 7.61  | 13.27 | 10.44|\r\n         +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia and Toronto observations disclose the same state of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nDr. Lamont, also, in his article, gives us the following table of the\r\nmagnitude of the variations derived from observations at Gottingen:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+\r\n  | Year.|Mean of Year.|\r\n  |--------------------|\r\n  | 1835 |    9.57     |\r\n  | 1836 |   12.34     |\r\n  | 1837 |   12.27     |\r\n  | 1838 |   12.79     |\r\n  | 1839 |   11.03     |\r\n  | 1840 |    9.91     |\r\n  | 1841 |    8.70     |\r\n  +--------------------+\r\n\r\nA comparison of these tables, and particularly the latter, with Schwabe's\r\ntable of spots, is interesting. There is obviously a greater mean\r\nvariation when the spots are most numerous. Comparing the two with the\r\ntables of Hildreth, in relation to the temperature, from 1830 to 1840,\r\nthere is, to say the least, a most remarkable coincidence. And there are\r\nothers equally remarkable.\r\n\r\nThere are also irregularities of action disclosed by all, in different\r\nmonths of the different years, and of the same year, which are obviously\r\nconnected with the difference of the seasons; and there are constantly\r\noccurring irregularities and disturbances which correspond with the, as\r\nconstantly occurring, irregular atmospheric phenomena. A wide field is\r\nhere opened for investigation and research. I have not time or opportunity\r\nto pursue it. Enough appears, so far as I have examined, to confirm the\r\nbelief that magnetism is actively concerned in the production of the\r\nvaried changes, as well as the normal conditions of the weather.\r\n\r\nIn what manner does it act? An answer to this requires an extension of the\r\ninquiry. The lines of magnetic force are every instant passing upward from\r\nthe earth, _around_ and _through_ us. Their connection with heat is\r\nunquestionable. They are intimately associated, also, with another equally\r\nobvious and intensely active agent--electricity. We speak of this as an\r\nindependent, imponderable, elementary body, but how little we yet know of\r\nit. It is every where, in every thing, easily excited into action, and\r\nthen traceable to a certain, but limited extent. It is set in motion, and\r\nbecomes obvious to us, by the chemical action of the acids and metals of\r\na galvanic apparatus. We separate it from the atmosphere by friction and\r\nexcitation, upon non-conductors, as in the electric machine; by the\r\ncleavage of crystals and other exciting operations. We obtain it from\r\nmagnets, by the magneto-electric machine, and from the lines of magnetic\r\nforce which are ever passing into the atmosphere from the earth, by\r\nintersecting them with a movable iron wire, properly insulated. _From the\r\ncurrent of magnetism which has passed through us from the earth,\r\nelectricity may thus be separated and collected over our heads._ We set it\r\nin motion, and obtain it _by heating_ different metals in connection, or\r\nthe same metal unequally; and from certain animals--like the torpedo and\r\nthe gymnotus--whose organization is such as to enable them to evolve it.\r\nIn all these cases, and they constitute an epitome of the principal\r\nmethods by which we obtain it in a distinct form, it is made to flow in\r\ncurrents. When thus obtained, and imprisoned in non-conductors, it may be\r\ndischarged, and with somewhat different effect, as it is discharged in a\r\nmass, disruptively, as it is called, as from the clouds in lightning, or\r\npermitted to flow convectively, in currents, along the wires of a galvanic\r\napparatus, or in heated air, as from the earth to a cloud in the tornado.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, capable of division into positive and negative, and when\r\nconcentrated or disturbed in one body, it tends to create a similar\r\ndisturbance or division in a contiguous mass. To this action of\r\nelectricity, the term static induction is applied. Thus, a positively\r\nelectrified body _induces_ a division of the electricity in a contiguous\r\nbody, if both are insulated or surrounded by a non-conducting medium; the\r\nnegative electricity of the contiguous body being attracted by, and\r\ntending to pass to, the positive of the adjoining body, and the positive\r\nbeing repelled to the opposite side. That, in its turn, if sufficiently\r\npowerful, tends to disturb the electricity of its neighbor, and attract\r\naway its negative electricity; or, if the body which contains it is free\r\nto move, to attract that. Thus, by the conflicting action of a positive\r\natmosphere, and a negative earth, and perhaps counter-trade, influenced by\r\nmagnetism and the solar rays, the currents and winds of the atmosphere are\r\nproduced, the atmosphere moving with exceeding ease and rapidity.\r\nElectricity, excited into currents, or obtained and discharged in either\r\nof the methods enumerated, is identical in character, and produces certain\r\nwell-known effects:\r\n\r\n1st. Physiological.--Shocking and convulsing the animal system; producing\r\na peculiar sensation on the tongue, and a flash before the eyes, and in\r\nsufficient quantity destroying life.\r\n\r\n2d. Magnetic.--_Deflecting the needle_, and, by a suitable arrangement of\r\nwire into helices, _conferring magnetic power_, or constituting magnets.\r\n\r\n3d. Luminous.--Producing light--by a spark, as it does in natural\r\nphenomena--by the glow, the brush discharge, the ball of flame, the flash,\r\nor the chain of lightning, and probably the aurora.\r\n\r\n4th. Evolving heat.--Melting metallic substances by concentration, with a\r\ngreat intensity of heat--as the wire of the galvanic apparatus, and as is\r\nsometimes seen in the effects of lightning in fusing metals on persons\r\nstricken; and setting combustibles on fire.\r\n\r\n5th. Attraction and repulsion.--Attraction, when the currents flow\r\nparallel with each other, or are of opposite natures, and repelling when\r\nof like character.\r\n\r\n6th. Induction.--Inducing attendant circular or other secondary currents,\r\nsuch as may be seen in the atmosphere during its most violent displays of\r\nactive energy.\r\n\r\n7th. Capable of being dissipated by heated air, or carried off by\r\nmoisture, although isolated by dry air, of ordinary temperature, which is\r\na bad conductor.\r\n\r\nNow, although magnetism can not be collected, imprisoned, or discharged,\r\nlike electricity, or collected at all, but by its adherence to some\r\nsubstance capable of magnetization, it is obvious there is an intimate\r\nassociation, at least, between it and electricity. _They are never found\r\nalone._ All _electricity_ will _magnetize_. All _magnetism_ will evolve\r\nelectricity. All _currents_ of _electricity_ have _encircling currents_ of\r\n_magnetism_, and all deflect the magnetic needle. All magnetic currents\r\ngive out to intersecting wires, _currents of electricity_, and all magnets\r\n_induce_ them.\r\n\r\nElectricity, therefore, whether identical in substance with magnetism, but\r\ndiffering in form, or whether merely associated with it, as is variously\r\nbelieved, should be present with magnetism in greater quantity or\r\nintensity where magnetism is most intense, and active, and whenever\r\npresent, should be active and influential. And so we find, from\r\nobservation, the fact to be. No inconsiderable effort has been made by the\r\nadvocates of the caloric and mechanical theories, to ignore the agency of\r\nelectricity and of magnetism, in the production of the varied\r\nmeteorological phenomena. But it will not do. The phenomena, grouped and\r\nanalyzed, disclose a potential-controlling, magneto-electric agency, and\r\nmeteorology will advance rapidly to perfection, as a simple, intelligible,\r\nand practical science, _as soon as that agency is admitted_.\r\n\r\nElectricity is always perceptibly present in storms and showers within the\r\ntropics. Most of the rain, from the tropical belt, falls from \"thunder\r\nshowers.\" So hurricanes and typhoons, and all tropical storms, are\r\nconfessedly, and in proportion to their intensity, \"_highly electric_.\"\r\nThis excess of quantity or activity of electricity, exists in connection\r\nwith the movable atmospheric machinery. When it moves up north in summer,\r\nand arrives at its highest point of northern transit, _storms_ are very\r\n_uncommon_, and the tropical forms of cloud and showers, with thunder and\r\nlightning, prevail. This is most obvious, if not most influential, where\r\nthe magnetic intensity is greatest. Violent showers, and gusts, and\r\ntornadoes, are more frequent in this country than in Europe; and over the\r\narea of greatest intensity, as in Ohio, than at a distance on the extreme\r\neastern or western coast. And the same is true over the intense magnetic\r\narea of Asia.\r\n\r\nElectricity, too, like magnetism, has its diurnal, and doubtless its\r\nannual and decennial variations, and also its irregular ones, and they are\r\nmost obviously and intimately connected. Magnetism and electricity\r\ntogether, constitute the aurora. Its culmination is in the magnetic\r\nmeridian--it affects the telegraph wires--is connected with the irregular\r\ndisturbances which affect the magnetic needle, and does not exist in the\r\nlimits of the trades, although occasionally seen from thence, when it\r\npasses south, and near them.\r\n\r\nThe aurora sometimes extends south in waves, as do the magneto-electric,\r\natmospheric, periodical changes of cold and heat, and storm, and sunshine.\r\n_The aurora is connected with the formation of cloud_, and with a smoky\r\natmosphere, similar to that with which we are familiar in summer and\r\nautumn. Thus Humboldt (Cosmos, vol. i. pp. 191, 192).\r\n\r\n\"This connection of the polar light with the most delicate cirrus clouds,\r\ndeserves special attention, because it shows that the electro-magnetic\r\nevolution of light is a part of a meteorological process. Terrestrial\r\nmagnetism here manifests its influence on the atmosphere, and on the\r\ncondensation of aqueous vapor. The fleecy clouds seen in Iceland, by\r\nThienemann, and which he considered to be the northern light, have been\r\nseen in recent times by Franklin and Richardson, near the American north\r\npole, and by Admiral Wrangel on the Siberian coast of the Polar Sea. All\r\nremarked 'that the aurora flashed forth in the most vivid beams when\r\nmasses of cirrus-strata were hovering in the upper regions of the air, and\r\nwhen these were so thin that their presence could only be recognized by\r\nthe formation of a halo round the moon.' These clouds sometimes range\r\nthemselves, even by day, in a similar manner to the beams of the aurora,\r\nand then disturb the course of the magnetic needle in the same manner as\r\nthe latter. On the morning after every distinct nocturnal aurora, the same\r\nsuperimposed strata of clouds have still been observed that had previously\r\nbeen luminous. The apparently converging polar zones (streaks of clouds in\r\nthe direction of the magnetic meridian), which constantly occupied my\r\nattention during my journeys on the elevated plateaux of Mexico, and in\r\nnorthern Asia, belong, probably, to the same group of diurnal phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nMr. William Stevenson gives us (in the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin\r\nPhilosophical Magazine for July, 1853) an interesting article on the\r\nconnection between aurora and clouds. His observations on this most\r\nimportant branch of the subject trace a connection between the aurora and\r\nthe formation of cloud, and open up, as he says, \"a most interesting field\r\nfor observation which promises to lead to very important results.\" Such\r\nobservations point with great significance, to the primary influence of\r\nthe magneto-electricity of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo the difference in the magnetic intensity of the eastern portion of this\r\ncontinent, compared with Europe and our western coast, very much of the\r\ndifference of climate, so far as temperature is involved, may be\r\nattributed. We have seen in what manner the iso-thermal lines surround\r\nthese areas of intensity. So the most excessive climate--that is, the\r\nclimate where the greatest extremes alternate, other things being equal,\r\nis upon or near the line or area of greatest magnetic intensity. I say\r\nother things being equal, because large bodies of water modify climates by\r\nequalizing the seasons--making the summers cooler and the winters warmer\r\nthan the mean of the parallel.\r\n\r\nThus, our great interior lakes modify the climate in relation to\r\ntemperature in their vicinity. Their summers are cooler and their winters\r\nwarmer; but westward of them the same line of equal summer temperature, or\r\niso-thermal line, rises with considerable abruptness, and the winter, or\r\niso-cheimal line of equal temperature, falls in a similar manner. Thus,\r\nthe range of the thermometer, from the highest elevation to the lowest\r\ndepression, for the year, is very great, while in the tropics the range is\r\ncomparatively small. From observations made at the military posts of the\r\nUnited States, Dr. Forrey deduced summer and winter lines of equal\r\ntemperature, starting from the vicinity of Boston and running west, which\r\nshowed most remarkably the rise of the summer lines as intensity\r\nincreased, and the fall of the winter lines in like manner.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the lakes was also most obvious. The elevation of the\r\nearth increases, going west, to about 700 feet at the surface of the\r\nlakes, and to nearly 4,000 feet at the eastern base of the Rocky\r\nMountains; and, although temperature does not decrease to as great a\r\ndegree when the elevation above the level of the sea is _gradual_, yet\r\nsome allowance should doubtless be made for that elevation on this line.\r\nWhen that allowance is made, the ascent of the summer line, to the north,\r\nover the area of greatest intensity, is strikingly apparent.\r\n\r\nDr. Forrey also instituted a comparison between Fort Snelling, where the\r\nclimate is as excessive, and the range of the thermometer as great, as in\r\nany portion of the continent in the same latitude, with Key West, and I\r\ncopy his diagram. It is very instructive, showing the gradual mean rise of\r\nthe temperature, from January to December, inclusive, while the cross\r\nlines show the _extremes of each month_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting part of it, is the illustration of the\r\nmonthly extremes, and the contrast between them, in the excessive climate\r\nof Fort Snelling, and the tropical one of Key West. Each is a type of the\r\nclimate in which it is situated. The annual range and monthly extremes are\r\nsmall in tropical countries, and large in extra-tropical ones. The extreme\r\nrange, or greatest elevation of heat, contrary to what is generally\r\nsupposed, is greater at Fort Snelling than at Key West. But the climate of\r\nthe latter is modified by the adjoining ocean.\r\n\r\nI copy, also, a table (p. 304), showing the range of the thermometer for\r\nthe year, and the maxima and minima, during each month, at several other\r\nplaces in this country, and at London and Rome, for the purpose of showing\r\nthe extent of the ranges compared with those places; and also, that these\r\ngreat changes in each month occur very uniformly all over the country,\r\nand may always be expected, and with considerable regularity. They are\r\nincident to our climate. I wish I could engrave the foregoing diagram, and\r\nthe following table, upon the mind of every man, woman, and child in the\r\ncountry; and under it, in ever-visible letters, these words of precaution:\r\nCONFORM TO THE PECULIARITIES OF YOUR CLIMATE, AND CLOTHE YOURSELVES, AT\r\nALL TIMES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIONS OF THE WEATHER. If heeded,\r\nthey would save thousands, every year, from premature death.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of this difference of magnetic intensity upon the climate of\r\nEurope is marked. There, the excessive summer heat, which our greater\r\nmagnetic intensity and larger volume of counter trade give us, is unknown.\r\nHence, while we can grow Indian corn (which requires the excessive summer\r\nheat) over all the Eastern States, up to 45 deg., and in some localities east\r\nof the lakes to 47 deg. 30', and to 50 deg. west of them, to the base of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and notwithstanding the increase of elevation, they can not\r\ngrow it except over a limited area, and with limited success. Nor can\r\nthey, or the inhabitants of any other country except China, grow\r\nprofitably the kind of cotton which is so successfully grown in the\r\nSouthern States of the Union. Nor can China do so to a considerable\r\nextent, because of the mountainous character of the surface. To a level\r\nand remarkably watered country, greater magnetic and electric intensity,\r\nand a greater volume of counter-trade, we are, and ever shall remain,\r\nindebted, for an almost exclusive monopoly in the growth of two of the\r\nmost important staple productions of the earth. On the other hand,\r\nalthough the same magnetic intensity, and its winter excess of positive\r\nelectricity and cold, make our winters extreme, there are but few of the\r\nproductions of temperate latitudes which we can not grow successfully, and\r\nthey are comparatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n  A  Fort Vancouver, Oregon Territory\r\n  B  Fort Brady, outlet of Lake Sup.\r\n  C  Hancock Barracks, Houlton, Me.\r\n  D  Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, Ill.\r\n  E  West Point, New York\r\n  F  Washington, D.

He who supposes that the restless activity and energy of\r\nthe people of the United States is the result of habit, or education, or\r\nany fortuitous circumstances alone, is mistaken. Let him watch the\r\ncontrast in his own feelings during those occasional languid, damp, and\r\nsultry, although not thermometrically, hot days--which so much resemble\r\nthe summer weather of England--with those days of bright, bracing, N. W.\r\nand S. W. air, so much more frequent here, and he will appreciate the\r\ndifference. That term \"bracing,\" so much in use, will express the effect\r\nof this peculiar weather. It \"girds up the loins,\" both of body and mind.\r\nMen and animals can work with more ease, even in our peculiar extremes of\r\nheat, than they can in England, and fatten with less.\r\n\r\nA similar difference in degree is found between our climate and that of\r\nthe Pacific portion of our country. Something is due to the difference in\r\nthe volume and moisture of the counter-trades, and something to the\r\ncontiguity of the Pacific Ocean; but to the difference in\r\nmagneto-electric intensity, the contrast is mainly due. Corn and cotton\r\nwill be grown, to some extent, in the valleys west of the meridian of\r\n105 deg., but never as successfully as east of it.\r\n\r\nThe aurora is periodical, like all the other atmospheric phenomena, but\r\nits periodicity is not accurately ascertained. It is believed to have\r\noccurred much oftener during the second quarter of this century, than\r\nduring the first. It is known, however, to occur most frequently in the\r\nspring and fall; and during those periods when the active and rapid\r\ntransit of the atmospheric machinery produces the greatest degree of\r\nmagnetic disturbance. This identifies it with terrestrial magnetism.\r\nDalton gives us the following table of observations, arranged according to\r\nthe months when they were seen.\r\n\r\n      Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May.

See an article by Mr. Herrick (American Journal of Science, vol.\r\n33. p. 297). In this, also, they conform to our greater magnetic intensity\r\nand more excessive climate.\r\n\r\nThe auroras appear to follow the polar belts of condensation and\r\nprecipitation. Dalton considers them indications of fair weather. They are\r\noften most brilliant just after a storm has passed, but their continuance\r\nis no indication that another will not follow within the usual period.\r\n\r\nThe condensation with which the aurora is connected, is not, in my\r\njudgment, often in the counter-trade, or below it, but above, where feeble\r\ncondensation has been seen by aeronauts when invisible at the surface of\r\nthe earth. Neither the height of this condensation, not that of the\r\naurora, have been satisfactorily ascertained. The aurora of April 7th,\r\n1847, was a favorable one for observation. It was carefully and\r\nattentively watched by Professor Olmsted, Mr. Herrick, Dr. Ellsworth, and\r\nothers, and they are intelligent and skillful observers.[9] But the nature\r\nof the aurora forbids reliance on parallax, or measurements founded on the\r\ntime when, any portion of the bow or arch rises in range of a particular\r\nstar. The bow or arch moves southwardly, but the same rays or currents do\r\nnot. The wave of magnetic _activity_ moves south, and each successive\r\ncurrent, as it is reached by the _impulse_, becomes luminous. Hence the\r\nobservers, when distant, do not see, at the same time, or at different\r\ntimes, the same rays. The phenomenon is unquestionably magneto-electric.\r\nElectricity becomes luminous in a vacuum, and De la Rive, by combining the\r\nelectric currents with those of magnetism, produced all the peculiarities\r\nof the aurora. The magnetic currents, passing from the earth, have\r\nassociated electric ones in connection, and these, in the upper attenuated\r\natmosphere, become luminous. Whether, as De La Rive supposes, by combining\r\nwith the positive electricity existing there, or because the associated\r\nelectric currents are _then_ in excess, not being intercepted by\r\natmospheric vapor and returned to the earth in rain, we can not know, nor\r\nis it very important we should.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a general view of the nature of magnetism and its\r\nassociated electricities, and their connection with the general and\r\nobvious peculiarities of climate, let us approach more nearly the varied\r\natmospheric phenomena, resulting from variations of pressure, temperature,\r\ncondensation, and wind, and give them a closer consideration. They all\r\nhave regularity and periodicity--they all occur in degree, and in\r\nconnection with magnetism and electricity, during the twenty-four hours of\r\nevery serene and normal summer's day. Grouped together, in comparison with\r\nthe changes in the activity and force of the magnetic elements, their\r\nconnection is clearly discernible.\r\n\r\nThe day may be said, with truth, to commence, in some portion of the\r\nsummer, at 4 A.M. The atmospheric does at all seasons. At that hour the\r\nbarometer is at its morning minimum. It has, as we have said, a\r\nperceptible diurnal variation of two maxima and two minima. Its periods of\r\ndepression are at 4 A.M., and 4 P.M., and of elevation at 10 A.M., and 10\r\nP.M. The difference between the elevation and depression is considerable\r\nwithin the tropics, where Humboldt tells us the hour of the day can be\r\nknown by the height of the barometer, and it decreases toward the poles.\r\nAt 4 A.M. it is then at one of its minima, and rises till 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAt, or about the same period, and sometimes when the barometer is falling,\r\nand previous thereto, there is a tendency to fog in localities subject to\r\nthat condensation. This tendency is sometimes observed at the other\r\nbarometric minimum, late in the afternoon or early in the evening, but\r\nless frequently. The tendency to fog condensation is greatest in this\r\ncountry about the morning minimum. It seems to be owing to the influence\r\nof the earth; it is confined to the surface atmosphere, and is apparently\r\nproduced by the inductive agency of the negative electricity of the earth.\r\nIt disappears, whether it be high or low fog, about the time when the\r\nbarometer attains its morning maximum, or about 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nAt about that period, when there has been fog, or earlier, when there has\r\nnot, and sometimes as early as 8 A.M., there is a tendency to trade\r\ncondensation--cirrus in mid-winter, and a cumulus in mid-summer, and,\r\nduring the intermediate time, a tendency to cirro-stratus, partaking more\r\nor less of the character of one or the other, according to the season.\r\n\r\nTemperature, in summer, commences its diurnal elevation about 4 A.M.,\r\nalso, and rises till about 2 P.M. From that time it falls with very little\r\nvariation till 4 o'clock the next morning. It has but one maximum and one\r\nminimum in the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAs the morning barometric maximum approaches, and the heat increases the\r\nmagnetic activity, condensation in the trade appears, or induced\r\ncondensation in the upper portion of the surface atmosphere, that portion\r\nnear the earth is affected and attracted--and the \"wind rises,\" according\r\nto the locality, the season, and the activity of the condensation. The\r\ntendency to blow increases with the tendency to trade and cumulus\r\ncondensation, and continues till toward night, when it gradually dies\r\naway, unless there be a storm approaching. As the heat increases, and\r\nstimulates magnetism into activity, the magnetic needle commences moving\r\nto the west, its regular diurnal variation, and continues to do so until\r\nabout 2 P.M., when it commences returning to the east, and so continues to\r\nreturn until 10 P.M., when it moves west again until 2 A.M., and from\r\nthence to the east, till 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nSimilar variations also take place in the horizontal force, as evinced by\r\nthe action of the magnetometer needle, and in the vertical force, as shown\r\nby the oscillations. So that it is evident that there are two maxima, and\r\ntwo minima of magnetic activity every day, shown by all the methods by\r\nwhich we measure magnetic action and force--more than double at the acme\r\nof northern summer transit over that of winter, and proceeding _pari\r\npassu_, with the other daily phenomena--evincing the same irregular action\r\nwhich the other phenomena evince. Still another phenomenon, which has a\r\ndaily change, is electric tension, or the increase or decrease in the\r\ntension of the positive or true atmospheric electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the mean two hourly tensions for three years, at\r\nKew, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Hours                   12 P.M.  2 A.M.  4 A.M.  6 A.M.  8 A.M.  10 A.M.\r\n  Number of observations   655     784     804     566     1,047   1,013\r\n  Tension                  22.6     20.1    20.5    34.2      68.2    88.1\r\n\r\n  Hours                   12 A.M.  2 P.M.  4 P.M.  6 P.M.  8 P.M.  10 P.M.\r\n  Number of observations   848     858     878     874     878     1,007\r\n  Tension                   75.4    71.5    69.1    84.8   102.4     104\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the tension of electricity is at a minimum\r\nat 4 A.M., also, that it rises till 10, falls till 4 P.M., but not as\r\nrapidly, rises till 10, falls again till 4 A.M., or the close of the\r\nmeteorological day--having two maxima and minima, as have most of the\r\nphenomena thus far considered.\r\n\r\nIn order to see what the connections between these ever-present, daily\r\nphenomena are, and their connection with other phenomena, and that we may\r\nunderstand their normal conditions, I will trace them approximately in a\r\ndiagram (figure 17.)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing diagram of the daily phenomena of a summer's day, when no\r\ndisturbing causes are in operation, no storm existing within influential\r\ndistance, and no unusual intensity or irregular action of any of the\r\nforces present, affords a basis for considering the various phenomena of\r\nthe weather in all its changes and conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the other phenomena do not all depend upon temperature\r\nmerely, if indeed any of them do.\r\n\r\nTemperature has but one maximum and minimum, and that is exceedingly\r\nregular, and does not correspond with any other.\r\n\r\nThe barometer has two; electric tension, two; magnetic activity, two;\r\ncondensation, two--one the formation of cloud, and the other the formation\r\nof fog and dew; wind, one--resembling temperature in that respect, but\r\nembracing a much less period.\r\n\r\nFog forms at one barometric minimum, and cloud at another.\r\n\r\nFog forms at one period of the magnetic variation, cloud at another.\r\n\r\nThe formation of cloud corresponds with the greatest intensity of magnetic\r\naction, and its associate electricities. But the oscillations of the\r\nbarometer do not correspond with either. And thus, then, we connect them:\r\n\r\n        CAUSE.        |        EFFECT.         | EFFECT.\r\n                      |                        |\r\n  Increase of magnetic|Decrease of pressure.   |Increase of primary\r\n  or magneto-electric |                        |condensation.\r\n  activity, as shown  |Of positive electric    |\r\n  by declination and  |tension.                |Of wind.\r\n  increase of         |                        |\r\n  horizontal and      |Of surface condensation,|Of electrical disturbance\r\n  vertical force.     |_i. e._, fog and dew.   |and phenomena in the\r\n                      |                        |trade and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThis connection is equally obvious if the order is reversed--thus;\r\n\r\n        CAUSE.        |        EFFECT.         | EFFECT.\r\n                      |                        |\r\n  Decrease of magnetic|Increase of pressure.   |Disappearance of primary\r\n  or magneto-electric |                        |condensation.\r\n  activity.           |Of tension of           |\r\n                      |atmospheric electricity.|Of wind, and\r\n                      |                        |\r\n                      |Of surface condensation,|Of electric disturbance\r\n                      |_i. e._, fog and dew.   |in the trade and its\r\n                      |                        |vicinity.\r\n\r\nIf we examine still more particularly the different phenomena, we shall\r\nfind the same relative action of the forces carried into all the\r\natmospheric conditions, however violent.\r\n\r\n1. The barometer falls when horizontal magnetic force, and a tendency to\r\ncloud and wind, increase; and rises when they decrease. This corresponds\r\nwith the character of the irregular barometric oscillation. Barometric\r\ndepressions accompany clouds and winds, and are in proportion to them, and\r\nare all greatest where magnetic force is greatest. The barometer also\r\nrises as the magnetic energy decreases. Do the magnetic currents, passing\r\nupward with increased force, lift, elevate the atmosphere? How, then, are\r\nwe to explain the increased range of the oscillations, as the center of\r\natmospheric machinery is reached, where magnetism has least intensity, and\r\nthe perpendicular currents are less, and attraction is less? Attraction is\r\ngreatest where intensity is greatest, and there the barometer stands\r\nhighest, and the diurnal range is least. Is it then the attraction of\r\nmagnetism which produces the barometric oscillations? If so, how then can\r\nwe explain the diurnal fall while magnetism is most active?\r\n\r\nPerhaps we have not yet arrived at such a knowledge of the nature of\r\nmagnetism as is necessary to a correct answer of those questions. Faraday\r\nhas taught us that the lines of magnetic force are close curves, passing\r\ninto the atmosphere, and over to the opposite hemisphere, and returning\r\nthrough the earth, out on the opposite side in like manner, and back\r\nagain, passing twice through the earth and twice through the atmosphere.\r\nAll we know of this is what the iron filings indicate, and we do not know\r\nhow much reliance to place upon the indications they give. But if Faraday\r\nis right, the sun will, twice each day, intersect and stimulate into\r\nincreased activity the same closed magnetic curve--once when it is coming\r\nout of the earth, during our day, when its influence will be the most\r\nactive, and once when it is returning on the opposite side of the earth;\r\nand a second, but feebler magnetic and electric maximum, may be occasioned\r\nby its action on the opposite and returning closed curve of the same\r\ncurrent. However this may be, it is exceedingly difficult to conceive, of\r\nany adequate influence exerted by the tension of vapor.\r\n\r\nSo the mid-day barometric minimum may be caused by the attraction of the\r\nearth, in a state of increased magnetic activity and intensity, upon the\r\ncounter-trade, and its consequent approach or settling toward the earth.\r\nObservation, as I have already said, pointedly indicates such a state of\r\nthings. So the increased magnetic activity, with or by its associate\r\nelectricity, acts upon the electricity of the counter-trade, condensation\r\ntakes place, the electricity is disturbed in the surface-atmosphere, by\r\ninduction, and its tension is changed. Opposite electrical conditions are\r\ninduced in the surface strata, and attraction takes place. The air moves\r\neasily, and thus the attractions originate the winds. Secondary currents\r\nare induced, as in all other cases of electric activity, and winds, in\r\n_different strata_ and directions, occur, with or without cumulus, or scud\r\ncondensation, according to their activity, and the proportion of moisture\r\nof evaporation they may contain.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the various received theories of meteorology\r\nattribute condensation to the action of cold, mingling of colder strata,\r\netc. But I think that view will have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt assumes that moisture is evaporated and held in the atmosphere by\r\nlatent heat, which is given out during condensation, and actually warms\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere. Thus, the Kew Committee undertook to explain\r\nthe development of greater heat, at the elevation where they, in fact,\r\nfound the counter-trade. But how unphilosophical to suppose a portion of\r\nthe air or vapor contained in it, can give out to another adjoining\r\nportion _more heat than is necessary to produce an equilibrium_. This can,\r\nindeed, be done by experiment--_but the experiment is made with currents\r\nof electricity_. How unphilosophical, too, to talk of latent heat in\r\nconnection with evaporation, _at the lowest temperature known_.\r\nMeteorologists must revise their opinions on the subject of condensation.\r\nThis latent heat has never been actually met with; on the contrary, the\r\nmost sudden and complete condensations of the vapor of the atmosphere are\r\nattended by as sudden and extraordinary productions of cold, and\r\nconsequent hail, and the connection between condensation and electricity\r\nis shown by too many facts to permit the old theory to stand.\r\n\r\n_Fog never forms with the thermometer below 32 deg.._ It is mainly a _summer\r\ncondensation_, especially high fog. It has been attributed to the cooling\r\neffect of an atmosphere colder than the earth, but it often occurs when\r\nthe earth is the coldest, and when the vapor, as it rises, is colder than\r\nthe air, and could not give out heat to a warmer medium. (See American\r\nJournal of Science, vol. xliv. p. 40.) Again, it is not mere condensation,\r\nbut a formation of globules or vesicles, hollow, and the air expanded in\r\nthem, by means of which they float like a soap bubble which contains the\r\nwarm air of the breath. Is not every vesicle a model shower, positively\r\nelectrified on the outside, negatively in the center, or the reverse,\r\naccording to the strata, with the air expanded in the middle by the excess\r\nof heat which negative electricity detains? Look at them, as they attach\r\nthemselves to the slender nap of the cloth you wear, when passing through\r\nthem, and see how many of them it would require to form a large drop of\r\nrain. The clouds are of a similar vesicular character, and rain does not\r\nfall till the vesicles unite to form drops. Sudden and extreme cold is\r\nindeed produced in the hail-storm, when, above, below, and around it, the\r\ntemperature is unaffected. Testu, Wise, and other aeronauts, have so found\r\nit, and the hail tells us it is so. But it is idle to say it results from\r\nradiation. All the phenomena of the sudden, violent hail-storms are\r\nelectric in an extraordinary degree. The electricity is disturbed and\r\nseparated--the associated heat continues with the negative, and leaves the\r\npositive portion of the cloud, and a corresponding reduction of\r\ntemperature results. So Masson found in his eudiometrical analytical\r\nexperiments the _negative_ wire would heat to fusion, while the positive\r\nwas cold. (See London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Journal of Science for\r\nDecember, 1853.) This disturbed electricity is diffused over the vesicles.\r\nListen to the thousand _crackling_ sounds which initiate the clap of\r\nthunder, and may be heard when the lightning strikes near you; produced by\r\nthe gathering of the lightning from as many points of the cloud where it\r\nwas diffused, to unite in one current and produce the \"clap\" or\r\n\"peal\"--and to the \"pouring\" of the rain, which follows the union of the\r\nvesicles, after the excess of repelling electricity is discharged.\r\n\r\nNo _change_ of temperature is observed when fogs form, except the ordinary\r\nchange between night and day; and it seems perfectly obvious, in looking\r\nat all the phenomena, that fogs form at a temperature of 70 deg. or 75 deg., in\r\nconsequence of the electric influence of the earth upon the adjoining\r\nsurface-atmosphere; and, when formed, they withstand the most intense\r\naction of a summer sun, till the time of day arrives for the barometric\r\nand electric tension to fall, condensation to take place in the\r\ncounter-trade above, and wind to be induced. Who that has noticed the\r\nalmost blistering force of the solar rays, as they break through a section\r\nof high fog, about 10 A.M., can forget them.\r\n\r\nFogs form near the earth, during the night, when the atmosphere above is\r\nloaded with moisture many degrees colder, and yet remains free from\r\ncondensation. On the other hand, during the heat of the day, and of the\r\nhottest days, the heavy rains condense above--nay, they frequently fall at\r\na temperature of 75 deg. to 80 deg., in the tropics, and of 50 deg. to 55 deg. in\r\nmid-winter here.\r\n\r\nThus far, an adherence to the opinion that condensation was simply a\r\ncooling process; the driving out of its latent heat, not merely to another\r\nbody to make an equilibrium, but \"_getting rid of it_\" by positive active\r\nradiation, or in some other way, so as to cool off and condense, has\r\ninvolved the formation and classification of clouds in obscurity. Hopkins\r\n(Atmospheric Changes, p. 331) laments this, but fettered by a false and\r\nimperfect theory, in relation to the tension of vapor, he falls into a\r\nsimilar error.\r\n\r\nNow, there are, as we have seen, peculiar, distinctly-marked varieties of\r\ncloud, connected with peculiar and distinctly-marked conditions of the\r\natmosphere, _irrespective of temperature_. None of the theories advanced,\r\naccount, or profess to account for the differences in either. No\r\nmodification of the calorific theory will account for them. They differ in\r\nshape, in color, in tendency to precipitation, in line of progress, and in\r\nelectrical character. The explanation of this is found in the fact, that\r\nthey form in distinct and different strata, partake of the positive\r\nelectric character of the one, or the negative of the other; or are\r\nsecondary, induced by the action of a primary condensation in a different\r\nstratum. There is not any mingling of the different strata, as has been\r\nsupposed; and many other facts than those to which we have alluded, show\r\nthat the formation of cloud is a magneto-electric process.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Reid show that every violent shower cloud has the\r\nelectricities disturbed, and portions of it are positive, and others\r\nnegative. Howard gives us the following _resume_ of Reid's observations:\r\n\r\n     \"From an attentive examination of Reid's observations I have been\r\n     able to deduce the following general results:\r\n\r\n     \"1. _The positive electricity, common to fair weather, often yields\r\n     to a negative state before rain._\r\n\r\n     \"2. _In general, the rain that first falls, after a depression of the\r\n     barometer, is_ NEGATIVE.\r\n\r\n     \"3. _Above forty cases of rain, in one hundred, give negative_\r\n     electricity; although the state of the atmosphere is positive, before\r\n     and afterward.\r\n\r\n     \"4. _Positive rain, in a positive atmosphere, occurs more rarely_:\r\n     perhaps fifteen times in one hundred.\r\n\r\n     \"5. _Snow and hail, unmixed with rain, are positive, almost without\r\n     exception._\r\n\r\n     \"6. _Nearly forty cases of rain, in one hundred, affected the\r\n     apparatus with both kinds_ of electricity; sometimes with an\r\n     interval, in which no rain fell; and so, that a positive shower was\r\n     succeeded by a negative; and, _vice versa_; at others, the two kinds\r\n     alternately took place during the same shower; and, it should seem,\r\n     _with a space of non-electric rain between them_.\"\r\n\r\nHoward attributes, with great apparent probability, the successive\r\ndifferences in the electrical character of the rain, to the passage of\r\ndifferent portions of the cloud, having different polarity, over the place\r\nof observation. So _positive hail_, and _negative rain_ fall in _parallel\r\nbands_ from the same cloud. Many such instances are on record. It should\r\nbe remembered that he is describing the phenomena in the showery climate\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nBut the most decisive, perhaps, as well as practically important evidence\r\nof the influence of magnetism, or magneto-electricity, in meteorological\r\nphenomena, is derived from the action of storms. My observation has been\r\nlimited, for my life has been, and must be, a practical one. But, subject\r\nto future, and I hope speedy corroboration, or correction, by extensive\r\nsystematic observation, I think I may venture to divide all storms into\r\nfour kinds:\r\n\r\n1. Those which come to us from the tropics, and constitute the class\r\ninvestigated by Mr. Redfield. That these are of a magneto-electric\r\ncharacter is evident. They originate near the line of magnetic intensity,\r\nover, or in the vicinity of, the volcanic islands of the tropics; are\r\nlargely accompanied by electrical phenomena; extend laterally as they\r\nprogress north; induce and create a change of temperature in advance of\r\nthem, and do not abate until they pass off over the Atlantic to the E. or\r\nN. E., and perhaps not until they reach the Arctic circle. Their extensive\r\nand continued action is not owing to any mere _mechanical agency_ of the\r\nadjoining passive air, or other supposed currents, originated, no man can\r\ntell how, but they concentrate upon themselves the local magnetic currents\r\nas they pass over and intersect them, and, by their inductive action upon\r\nthe surface-atmosphere, in different directions, attract it under them,\r\nand within their more active influence. Here the action of the magnetic\r\ncurrents is probably the primary cause, but the power of the storm to\r\nconcentrate upon itself the new magnetic currents which it intersects as\r\nit enters each new, successive field, enables them to maintain and extend\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram illustrates the course and gradual enlargement of a\r\nmid-autumn tropical storm, which induces a S. E. wind in front, and\r\noccasions a thaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Another class originate at the N. W., and extend gradually south\r\neasterly on the magnetic meridian. These are most frequent in summer,\r\nforming belts of showers, but occur, I believe, at all seasons of the\r\nyear. They seem to be produced by magnetic waves passing south, and are\r\nfollowed in autumn and winter, and sometimes in summer, by the peculiar N.\r\nW. wind and scud, and a term of cooler weather.\r\n\r\nThus, it is believed that many, perhaps all of the alternating terms of\r\nheat and cold, are dependent on magnetic waves passing over the country in\r\na similar manner, with a greater or less belt of condensation between\r\nthem, and depending on peculiar magnetic action traveling in the same\r\nway. The S. E. extension of showers and storms, and the cooler changes of\r\ntemperature which immediately follow them; with light N. W. wind in\r\nmid-summer, and with it fresher at earlier and later periods, in the form\r\nof northers blowing violently, according to the season, are intimately\r\nconnected, and indicate such waves. The indication is strengthened also by\r\nthe frequent progress of auroras in like manner, occurring usually after\r\nthe belt of condensation has passed, and frequently following it. The\r\nclouds and currents of the atmosphere, so far as I have been able to\r\ndiscover, show no permanent current from the pole to the atmospheric\r\nequator, compensating for the counter-trade; and that compensation is\r\nfurnished by the periodical but frequent atmospheric waves, connected with\r\nthe periodical changes of storm, and cloud, and sunshine, which gradually\r\nextend from north to south, in or near the magnetic meridian. Perhaps such\r\ncompensating currents are found west of the magnetic poles, as we have\r\nsuggested, and make the N. E. and northerly dry winds of Western Europe\r\nand the Pacific; but, in the present state of our knowledge, it is\r\nimpossible to say that they are. If it be so, the compensation they\r\nfurnish must be small; for the volume of counter-trade which is not\r\ndepolarized before it reaches the Arctic circle, and which passes round\r\nthe magnetic pole, must be very small. A majority of our periodical\r\nchanges, during the northern transit, and I believe at all seasons, are of\r\nthis character; and, I have reason to believe, from observation, in one\r\nor two cases, that where belts of rains and showers begin, over _any\r\nlocality_ in the United States, they may assume this character. I have\r\nbeen in Saratoga when an easterly storm commenced _south of that place_;\r\nthe condensation and mackerel sky being visible at the south, and no cloud\r\nformation or rain occurring there at the time, and have traced it\r\nafterward as a belt which had a lateral extension south-eastward. Leaving\r\nthat place immediately after a belt had passed south, I have overtaken it\r\nby railroad, and run into it again before arriving at New York; and\r\nwitnessed its subsequent extension south-eastwardly, out over the\r\nAtlantic. I have witnessed the approach of such a belt in the spring, at\r\nSandusky, upon Lake Erie, and its passage over to the S. E., followed by\r\nthe N. W. wind, as Mr. Bassnett describes them at Ottawa, and run under\r\nthe attenuated edge of the same belt, on the same day, on the way to\r\nPittsburg, leaving the N. W. wind behind, but finding it present again\r\nwith clear sky on the following morning. I have seen hundreds of them\r\napproach from the north, and pass to S. E., out over the Atlantic;\r\nfollowed by the N. W. wind in spring and autumn. This class of storms pass\r\noff toward, and doubtless over the track, of our European steamers and\r\npackets. I know this, for I witness it nearly every month in the year. It\r\nis not a matter of speculation, but of actual, long-continued observation.\r\nProbably, as one approaches the Gulf Stream, and when over it, its induced\r\nwinds may be more violent. It is time our navigators understood this; and\r\nthat all the gales of the North Atlantic, certainly, are not rotary; and\r\ndo not approach from the S. W. in the same manner as the class\r\ninvestigated by Mr. Redfield do. Where a fresh southerly or south-westerly\r\nwind is followed by any considerable cirro-stratus or stratus-condensation,\r\nit is usually of this character.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram exhibits the peculiarities of this class of storms.\r\nIt is intended to represent the same storm or belt of showers, on _two\r\nsuccessive_ days, and, of course, its usual rate of southerly extension:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis class of storms, or belts of showers, present the following\r\nsuccession of phenomena in summer:\r\n\r\n1. Still warm weather, one or more days.\r\n\r\n2. Fresh southerly wind, one or more days; if more than one, dying away at\r\nthe S. W., at night-fall, but continuing into the evening of the day\r\nbefore the belt of condensation arrives.\r\n\r\n3. Belt of condensation, with or without rain or showers, with the\r\neasterly wind blowing axially, if the condensation is heavy and the belt\r\nwide; westerly if the condensation is feeble or the belt narrow--the\r\nclouds moving about E. N. E.\r\n\r\n4. Cooler air, light N. W. in summer, heavy N. W. in autumn, winter, and\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAnd, the next period--\r\n\r\n5. Still warm weather or light airs.\r\n\r\n6. Southerly wind, fresh.\r\n\r\n7. Belt of condensation.\r\n\r\n8. Cool northerly wind.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, successively, unless broken in upon by some other class.\r\n\r\nSometimes these periods are exceedingly regular, at other times the other\r\nclasses prevail. I have much reason to believe that this is the _normal,\r\nperiodic_ provision for condensation of our portion of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and probably of every other where rain falls regularly in the\r\nsummer season, and that the other classes are exceptions, as the\r\nhurricanes are exceptions to the normal condition of the weather every\r\nwhere. Perhaps in some seasons, during the northern transit, the\r\nexceptions may equal the rule, but I do not now remember such a season. In\r\nother years nearly all the storms are of this character. Thus, Dr.\r\nHildreth (in Silliman's Journal for 1827), speaking of the year 1826, in a\r\nnote to his register of that year, says: \"There have been, this year, an\r\nunusual number of winds from N. or N. W. Nearly every rain the past summer\r\nhas been followed with winds from the northward, when, in many previous\r\nsummers, the wind continued to the southward after rain.\" The immediate\r\noccurrence of northerly wind after the passage of the belt of\r\ncondensation, is a peculiar feature of this class of storms.\r\n\r\nAs this also will be new, and is of great practical interest, I shall be\r\npardoned for referring to other evidence. Bermuda is in latitude 32 deg.\r\nnorth. In the summer season they are within the range of the Calms of\r\nCancer, as Lieutenant Maury terms them, and not subject to storms. From\r\nNovember to May, inclusive, they have successions of revolving wind.\r\nColonel Reid gave them much attention, and studied them barometrically:\r\nthat is, he studied the changes of the wind during the successive periodic\r\ndepressions. He found them revolving like ours, and hence inferred the\r\ntruth of the gyratory theory in relation to all winds. But it is perfectly\r\nevident the same polar belts which pass over us reach them during the\r\nsouthern transit. The precedent southerly wind, the _central\r\ncondensation_, the appearance of lightning, and the rotation of the wind\r\nby both the east and west, but most frequently by west, are the same. In\r\nhis chapter on observations at the Bermudas, he gives us many examples.\r\nProbably the existence of the Gulf Stream to the west and north has a\r\nmodifying influence upon them, and their action becomes less intense in\r\nthat latitude, but they are very similar. I copy a record of the weather,\r\nfor a month, which may be found on pages 252, 253, and 254, and a portion\r\nof his remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"The month of December, 1839, presents a continual succession of\r\n     revolving winds passing over the Bermudas, with scarcely an\r\n     irregularity, as regards the fall and rise of the barometer\r\n     accompanying the veering of the wind. One, however, occurred on the\r\n     10th and 11th. The S. W. wind abated, and changed to W. N. W., with\r\n     the barometer still falling. But in the column of remarks it is noted\r\n     that there was lightning seen in the N. and N. W., from 7 P.M.,\r\n     during the night. This irregularity may, therefore, have been\r\n     occasioned by a gale passing over the banks of Newfoundland,\r\n     influencing the direction of the wind at Bermuda.\r\n\r\n\"REVOLVING WINDS.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Date.  |  Hour.  |Direction of| Wind's | Weather.  |  Bar.|Ther.|\r\n  |        |         |    Wind.   | Force. |           |      |     |\r\n  |--------|---------|------------|--------|-----------|------|-----|\r\n  | 1839.  |         |            |        |           |      |     |\r\n  |Nov. 30 |Midnight.| S.

W. squall probably), but not sufficient\r\nto reverse the wind to the south. In Colonel Reid's opinion there were\r\nfive revolving gales which passed over Bermuda during the month. In my\r\nopinion, there were five perfect polar waves of condensation, and one\r\nimperfect one, with as many successive southerly winds preceding the\r\ncondensation, with or without rain in the center, followed by as many cold\r\nN.

W. There was a period when a belt of less intense stratus, without much\r\nwind, occurred (28th, 29th, and 30th of June). This was followed by a\r\ndistinct belt of showers and _fresh_ S. wind, on the 2d of July, and by\r\nthe N. W. wind and clear weather, on the 3d.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of July it was more irregular, with the exception of the\r\n7th, 8th, and 9th, when another belt and revolution occurred.\r\n\r\nNow, these periods, when distinctly marked, exhibit the same succession of\r\nphenomena--viz., elevation of temperature, fresh southerly wind, belt of\r\ncondensation, cumulus or stratus with cirrus running east, but extending\r\nsouth, followed by N. W. wind, and clear, cold air. Can any one believe\r\nthey were successive rotary gales?\r\n\r\nI wish, in this connection, to make a suggestion to Lieutenant Maury and\r\nothers. The descriptions of M. Bassnett, although not perfect, are very\r\nintelligible. He describes things as they were, and as they should be\r\ndescribed. He distinguishes the clouds, and the scud, and other\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Reid's descriptions are unmeaning and unintelligible. G.\r\nM.--Gloomy, misty! Gloomy from what? fog, or stratus, or a stratum of\r\nscud, or what? We can not know. Again, C. The table tells us this stands\r\nfor detached clouds. But of what kind? Cumulus, broken stratus, patches of\r\ncirro-cumulus or cirro-stratus, or scud? All these, and indeed every kind\r\nof cloud or fog formation, except low fog, may exist in detached portions.\r\n\r\nThese abbreviations will not answer; they do not describe the weather. The\r\nclouds must be studied and described. There is no difficulty in doing it.\r\nSailors will learn them very soon after their teachers have; and those who\r\nteach them should see to it that the logs contain terms of description\r\nwhich convey the meaning which may, and ought to be, conveyed. The use of\r\nthese indefinite terms can not be continued without culpability.\r\n\r\nAgain, the observations of seamen off our coast are in accordance with the\r\nprogress of this class of storms on land, and prove that they continue S.\r\nE. over the Atlantic, abating in action as they approach the tropics.\r\nThere is abundant evidence of this in the work of Colonel Reid, and the\r\ncharts of Lieutenant Maury, but I can not devote further space to them.\r\n\r\nThe third class form in the counter-trade, over some portion of the\r\ncountry, from excessive volume or action of the counter-trade, or local\r\nmagnetic activity, without coming from the tropics or being connected with\r\na regular polar wave of magnetic disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram exhibits their form, progress, and accompanying\r\ninduced winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentle rains of spring, particularly April, and the moderate and\r\nfrequent snow-storms of winter, are often of this character; and so are\r\nthe heavy rains, which commence at the morning barometric minimum, rain\r\nheavily through the forenoon, and light up near mid-day in the south,\r\nfollowed by gentle, warm, S. W. winds. This class are more frequent in\r\nsome years than others--probably the early years of the decade, while\r\npolar storms are, during the later ones. It is this class which have\r\n_violent_ easterly winds _in front_, and on the _south side_, with two or\r\nmore currents, and which Mr. Redfield has also supposed to be cyclones.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class are isolated showers, occurring over particular\r\nlocalities, or belts of drought and showers alternating; sometimes a\r\ngeneral disposition to cloudy and showery weather for a longer or shorter\r\ninterval over the whole country; at others, limited to particular\r\nlocalities in the course of the trade. Such a period occurred during the\r\nwheat harvest of 1855. This class I attribute to a general increased\r\nmagnetic action, but it may be induced by an increased volume, or greater\r\nsouth polar magnetic intensity of the counter-trade, exciting and\r\nconcentrating the regular currents of the field, and increasing their\r\nactivity and energy. These also often work off south gradually, and are\r\nfollowed by a cold N. W. air for a day or two; showing a tendency, in the\r\nexcited magnetism, to pass as a wave toward the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram will give some idea of this class:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes very obvious local tendencies to precipitation over\r\nportions adjoining an area affected with drought, as there are other\r\nmagnetic irregularities over particular areas.\r\n\r\nAll these classes of storms are variant in intensity. Sometimes the\r\ngeneral or local cloud-formation is weak, and does not produce\r\nprecipitation at all; so of that which extends southerly. Probably the\r\ntropical storm are always sufficiently dense and active to precipitate.\r\nTheir action is often violent over particular localities, and hence the\r\nmore frequent occurrence of the tornado over the more intense area of\r\nOhio, and other portions of the west. All violent local storms are\r\ndoubtless owing to local magneto-electric activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who has attentively perused and considered the facts stated,\r\nand the principles deduced, in the preceding pages, and is ready to make a\r\npractical application of them by careful observation, will have little\r\ndifficulty in understanding the varied atmospheric conditions; and will\r\nsoon be able to form a correct judgment of the immediate future of the\r\nweather, so far as his limited horizon will permit.\r\n\r\nBut there are other facts and considerations, not specifically alluded to,\r\nwhich will materially aid him in his observations; and there is a degree\r\nof philosophical truth in the proverbs and signs, which ancient popular\r\nobservation accumulated, and poetry and tradition have preserved, that\r\nmeteorologists have been slow to discover or admit, but which will be\r\nobvious upon examination, and commend them to his attention.\r\n\r\nThe classical reader is doubtless familiar with that part of the first\r\nGeorgic of Virgil, which contains a description of the signs indicative of\r\natmospheric changes. Much of it is beautifully poetic, and, if read in the\r\nlight of a correct philosophy, is equally truthful.\r\n\r\nI copy from a creditable translation, found in the first volume of\r\nHoward's \"Climate of London\":\r\n\r\n  \"All that the genial year successive brings,\r\n  Showers, and the reign of heat, and freezing gales,\r\n  Appointed signs foreshow; the Sire of all\r\n  Decreed what signs the southern blast should bring,\r\n  Decreed the omens of the varying moon:\r\n  That hinds, observant of the approaching storm,\r\n  Might tend their herds more near the sheltering stall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  PROGNOSTICS.--_1st.

These I add from Hone, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Her corns with shooting pains torment her--\r\n  And to her bed untimely send her.\"\r\n\r\nThat couplet is included by Hone with what is said of Aunt Betty.\r\n\r\n  \"The smoke from chimneys right ascends,\r\n  Then spreading back to earth it bends.\r\n  The wind unsteady veers around;\r\n  Or, settling in the south is found.\"\r\n\r\nThose are as philosophically accurate and valuable as any.\r\n\r\n  \"The tender colts on back do lie;\r\n  Nor heed the traveler passing by.\r\n  In fiery red the sun doth rise,\r\n  Then wades through clouds to mount the skies.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of those couplets is untrue. It is doubtless alluded to as one\r\nof the acts of the animal creation, indicating sleepiness and inaction,\r\nwhich precede storms; but colts do not lie on the back. The other couplet\r\nis both true and important. This collection entire, whether written by\r\nDarwin or Jenner, contains most of the signs which have been preserved,\r\nand which are of much practical importance in our climate.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably true that \"appointed signs foreshow the weather,\" to\r\na great extent, every where, but with more certainty in the climate in\r\nwhich Virgil wrote than in our variable and excessive one. \"Showers\" and\r\n\"freezing gales\" we can, perhaps, as well understand; but the \"_reign of\r\nheat_,\" by which he probably meant the dry period, when the southern edge\r\nof the extra-tropical belt of rains is carried up to the north of them, we\r\ndo not experience. Something like it we did indeed have, during the\r\nexcessive northern transit, in the summer of 1854; but it was an\r\nexception, not the rule.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important of those signs from Virgil and Jenner I propose\r\nto allude to in detail; but it is necessary to look; in the first place,\r\nto the character of the season and the month.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the years differ during different periods of the same\r\ndecade. That they incline to be hot and irregular during the early part of\r\nit, and cool, regular, and productive during the latter portion--subject,\r\nhowever, to occasional exceptions. The latter half of the third decade of\r\nthis century (1826 to 1830, inclusive) was comparatively warm; and, in the\r\nlatitude of 41 deg., was very unhealthy, and so continued during the early\r\npart of the next, over the hemisphere, embracing the _cholera seasons_.\r\nThe spots upon the sun were much less numerous than usual, during the\r\nlatter half of the third decade. Thus the spots from\r\n\r\n     1826 to 1830, inclusive, were  873\r\n     1836 to 1840      \"       \"   1201\r\n     1846 to 1850      \"       \"   1168\r\n\r\n     and the size of those from 1836 to 1840 exceeded those of the other\r\n     years.\r\n\r\nThe attentive observer will very soon be satisfied that the seasons have a\r\ncharacter; and those of every year differ in a greater or less degree from\r\nthose of other years in the same decade, and those of one decade not\r\nunfrequently from those of some other. _Periodicity_ is stamped upon all\r\nof them, and upon all resulting consequences. Like seasons come round,\r\nand, like productiveness or unproductiveness, healthy or epidemic\r\ndiatheses, attend them. We have seen that, in relation to mean\r\ntemperature, there are such periodical diversities, but they are more\r\nstrongly marked in the character of storms, and other successions of\r\nphenomena. \"_All signs fail in a drouth_,\" for then all attempts at\r\ncondensation are partial, imperfect, and ineffectual. \"_It rains very\r\neasy_,\" it is said, at other times, and so it seems to do, and with\r\ncomparatively little condensation. In the one case, no great reliance can\r\nbe placed upon indications which are entirely reliable in the other. So\r\n\"_all our storms clear off cold_,\" or, \"_all our storms clear off warm_,\"\r\nare equally common expressions--as the _prevailing classes_ of storms give\r\na _character_ to the _seasons_. It \"_rains every Sunday now_,\" is\r\nsometimes said, and is often peculiarly true--the storm waves having just\r\nthen a weekly or semi-weekly period, and one falls upon Sunday for several\r\nsuccessive weeks; and when it is so, _that_ coincidence is sure to be\r\nnoticed and commented upon, and the other perhaps disregarded.\r\n\r\nIf the seasons depended upon the northward and southward journey of the\r\nsun alone, entire regularity might be expected--for we have no reason to\r\nbelieve that magnetism and electricity contain, within themselves,\r\ninherently, any tendency to irregularity, or periodicity; and, the sun\r\nbeing constant in his _periods_, would be constant in his _influence_. But\r\nhe is inconstant and variable in his influence, and it is apparently\r\ntraceable to the existence of spots; but I am not quite sure that it is\r\noccasioned by the _observable_ spots alone. Grant that the intensity and\r\npower of his rays differ on the same day, in different years, and that\r\ndifference may be attributable in part to causes which our telescopes can\r\nnot discover.\r\n\r\nBut the differences in the seasons do not depend on the variability of the\r\nsun's influence alone. This appears from the frequent meridional and\r\nlatitudinal diversities and contrasts, to which allusion has been made.\r\nThe sun can not be supposed to exert a _less_ influence on a middle, than\r\na more northern latitude; nor on one series of meridians, than another.\r\nThere must, therefore, be another local and powerful disturbing cause,\r\nvarying the magnetic and electric activity and influence upon the trades,\r\nas well in their incipiency as in their circuits, and thus controlling the\r\natmospheric conditions locally and in _the opposite hemispheres_. That\r\nother disturbing cause is _volcanic action_. We can conceive of none\r\nother, and we can detect and trace the influence of that to a considerable\r\nextent. Unfortunately we know, and can practically know, comparatively\r\nlittle of it. It has been busy with the earth since the creation, and will\r\ncontinue to be so till, possibly, by a collision, it shall burst into\r\nasteroids--its molten interior flowing out in seeming combustion--each\r\nfragment retaining its magnetic polarities entire, and continuing on in an\r\nindependent orbit in the heavens, an asteroid, or meteorite.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the agency of magnetism in itself may be regular, and\r\nthe transit of the sun is regular, and \"seed-time and harvest shall not\r\ncease,\" yet the sun is not regular in his influence, and the magnetic\r\nagency is disturbed by another and irregular power. And, although we can\r\ntrace the influence of both upon the seasons, we can not measure that\r\ninfluence, and from it reliably foretell the weather. The discoveries of\r\nSwabe, and future ones, relative to solar irregularities, will assist us,\r\nbut, till we understand better, and to some extent anticipate, the\r\nchanges of volcanic action, we shall not be able to understand or foresee\r\nall the differences in the seasons. That time may come; for progress is\r\nyet to be read in the front of meteorology, and simultaneous practical\r\nobservations made and interchanged at every important point on the globe.\r\nNevertheless, the seasons have a character--often a regular one--one class\r\nof storms prevailing over all others--one series of phenomena occurring to\r\nthe exclusion of others--and we must regard it if we would arrive at\r\nintelligent estimates of their future condition.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part to understand are the meridional contrasts. Last\r\nyear we had one of the worst drouths which has occurred since the\r\nsettlement of the country. But while all the eastern portion of the United\r\nStates was dry, New Mexico was unusually wet; and the North-western\r\nStates, on the same curving line of the counter-trade, were not affected\r\nby the drouth.\r\n\r\nExtract from a letter written by Governor Merriweather, to Mr. Bennett, in\r\nanswer to a circular, published in the \"New York Herald,\" and dated\r\n\r\n     \"SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO, Oct. 25th, 1854.\r\n\r\n     \"More rain has fallen during the last six months, within this\r\n     territory, than ever was known to have fallen in the same length of\r\n     time, in this usually dry climate. Generally, little or no crops have\r\n     been produced without irrigation; but this season some good crops\r\n     have been produced without any artificial watering.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there was an apparent connection between the remarkable\r\nvolcanic action, exerted beneath the western continents during the second\r\ndecade of this century, and the remarkable coldness of that decade. And\r\nit is easy to see that the comparative absence of volcanic action from\r\nimmediately beneath the Old World, and its presence in great excess\r\nbeneath the New, may disturb the regular action of terrestrial magnetism\r\nabove it in the earth's-crust here, and affect seasons, diatheses, and\r\nhealth unfavorably; while from its absence they may be favorably affected\r\nthere. I have some general views in relation to this, but they are\r\nnecessarily speculative, for the data are few, and I reserve them.\r\n\r\nI am, however, induced to believe that the transit of the atmospheric\r\nmachinery is greater over some portions of the northern hemisphere, in\r\nsome seasons, than others. The most natural explanation of the unusual\r\ncontrast between the drouth of the Eastern States, and the wet of the\r\nTerritories, during the last summer, is, that the concentrated\r\ncounter-trade was carried west, by some irregular magnetic action in the\r\nSouth Atlantic or West Indies. But there was much evidence that the\r\nnorthern extension of the atmospheric machinery was greater than usual.\r\nThe transit began _early_--it was evidently _rapid_; the rains of May fell\r\nin April, and the spring was wet; _summer set in earlier_--all the\r\nappearances then were unusually tropical--the polar belts of condensation\r\ndescended upon us, but they were feeble, as they doubtless become, when\r\nthey reach the tropics, and did not precipitate; the summer continued full\r\ntwenty days later--no rain falling till about the 10th of September. The\r\nseason throughout was excessive, but otherwise regular. Spring came\r\nearlier; summer commenced earlier and continued longer; autumn held off\r\nlater, and cold weather, when it came, was uniform and severe. This season\r\nthe transit has seemed to be less than for several years.[10] The spring\r\nwas backward; the summer cool, but exceedingly regular; the autumn thus\r\nfar without extremes, and the whole year healthy and productive. It is the\r\nnormal period of the decade, between the irregular heat of the first part,\r\nand the irregular cold of the last; and it has been normal in character,\r\nand conformed beautifully to its location. If the transit of 1854 was\r\nfurther north than the mean, as it seemed to be over this country, that of\r\nitself would convey the showers which follow up in the western portion of\r\nthe concentrated trade, on the east of the mountains of Mexico, and cause\r\nthem to precipitate further north, over New Mexico, and thus, rather than\r\nfrom a diverted trade, they may have derived their unusual supply of\r\nmoisture during the summer of 1854. On this subject I can but conjecture,\r\nand leave to future observation a discovery of the truth.\r\n\r\nEnough appears, however, to show the importance of taking the location of\r\nthe year in the decade, and even the character of the decade itself, into\r\nthe account.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the remote cause of the difference in the seasons, the\r\ncharacter of the seasons is directly influenced by the character of\r\nstorms, or periodic changes. Sometimes the tropical storms are most\r\nnumerous; at others the polar waves; and at others the irregular local\r\nstorms, or general tendency to showers. The seasons when the polar waves\r\nare most prevalent, are the most regular, healthy, and productive. Those\r\nwhere the tropical tendency is greatest, are irregular; and so are those\r\nwhere the other classes predominate. These differences in the character of\r\nthe storms, are but the varying forms in which magnetic action develops\r\nitself. I have said that there was a decided tendency to cirrus without\r\ncumulus, in mid-winter, and cumulus without cirro-stratus or stratus, in\r\nmidsummer, and during the intermediate time an intermediate tendency. But\r\nthere is a difference between spring and autumn. Dry westerly (not N. W.)\r\ngales prevail in March, and N. E. storms in April and May, but violent S.\r\nE. gales are not as common. On the other hand, the dry westerly gales of\r\nMarch are comparatively unknown in autumn, and the violent, tropical,\r\nsouth-easters are then common.\r\n\r\nSnow-storms occur during the northern transit, not unfrequently in April\r\nand May; but they do not occur so near the acme of the northern transit on\r\nits return; nor until it approaches very near its southern limit. The\r\nquiet, warm, and genial air of April, is reproduced in the Indian summer\r\nof autumn, but they present widely different appearances. Those, and many\r\nother peculiarities of the seasons, deserve the attentive consideration of\r\nevery one who would become familiar with the weather and its prognostics.\r\n\r\nThese irregularities in the character of the seasons have doubtless always\r\nexisted, and always been the objects of popular observation. There are\r\nsome very old proverbs which show this. I copy a few of the many, which\r\nmay be found in Foster's collection. Mr. Graham Hutchison does not seem to\r\nthink any of those ancient proverbs worthy of notice. But he misjudges.\r\nThey are the result of popular observation, and many of them accord with\r\nthe true philosophy of the weather.\r\n\r\n_Irregular_ seasons are unhealthy, and unreliable for productiveness. When\r\nthe southern transit was late, or limited, and the autumn ran into winter,\r\nour ancestors feared the consequences in both particulars, and expressed\r\ntheir fears, and hopes also, in proverbs. Thus,\r\n\r\n  \"A green winter\r\n  Makes a fat churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nThere is very great truth in this proverb. Again,\r\n\r\n  \"If the grass grows green in Janiveer,\r\n  It will grow the worse for it all the year.\"\r\n\r\nThis is emphatically true, for the season which commences irregularly will\r\nbe likely to continue to be irregular in other respects.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same tenor:\r\n\r\n  \"If Janiveer Calends be summerly gay,\r\n  It will be winterly weather till Calends of May.\"\r\n\r\nJaniveer is an alteration of the French name for January, and the proverb\r\nis very old.\r\n\r\nSo March should be normally dry and windy.\r\n\r\nThis, too, they understood, and hence the strong proverb:\r\n\r\n  \"A bushel of March _dust_\r\n  Is worth a king's ransom.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another:\r\n\r\n            \"March hack ham,\r\n  Come in like a lion, go out like a lamb.\"\r\n\r\nSo April and May should be cool and moist. It is their normal condition in\r\nregular, healthy, and productive seasons. The grass and grain require such\r\nconditions; and the spring rains are needed to supply the excessive summer\r\nevaporation. This, too, they well understood. And hence the proverbs:\r\n\r\n  \"A cold April the barn will fill.\"\r\n\r\n  \"A cool May, and a windy,\r\n  Makes a full barn and a findy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd--\r\n\r\n  \"April and May are the keys of the year.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not very favorable, to be sure, for corn; but their consolation\r\nwas found, as we find it, in the truth of another proverb:\r\n\r\n  \"Look at your corn in May, and you'll come sorrowing away;\r\n  Look again in June, and you'll come singing in another tune.\"\r\n\r\nThis difference in the character of the seasons occasioned the adoption of\r\na great variety of \"Almanac days;\" and they are still very much regarded.\r\nCandlemas-day (2d of February) was one of them.\r\n\r\nSays Hone, in his \"Every-Day Book\":\r\n\r\n     \"Bishop Hall, in a sermon, on Candlemas-day, remarks, that 'it has\r\n     been (I say not how true) an old note, that hath been wont to be set\r\n     on this day, that if it be clear and sunshiny, it portends hard\r\n     weather to come; if cloudy and lowering, a mild and gentle season\r\n     ensuing.'\"\r\n\r\nTo the same effect is one of Ray's proverbs:\r\n\r\n  \"The hind had as lief see\r\n  His wife on her bier,\r\n  As that Candlemas-day\r\n  Should be pleasant and clear.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Paul's day, or the 25th of January, was another great \"Almanac day,\"\r\nand so the verse:\r\n\r\n  \"If Saint Paul's day be fair and clear,\r\n  It does betide a happy year;\r\n  But if it chance to snow or rain,\r\n  Then will be dear all kinds of grain.\r\n  If clouds or mists do dark the sky,\r\n  Great store of birds and beasts shall die;\r\n  And if the winds do fly aloft,\r\n  Then war shall vex the kingdom oft.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Swithin's day was another of these \"Almanac days.\" Gay said truly,\r\n\r\n  \"Let no such vulgar tales debase thy mind;\r\n  Nor Paul, nor Swithin, rule the clouds or wind.\"\r\n\r\nYet \"_Almanac days_\" are still in vogue to a considerable extent--such as\r\nthe _three first days_ of the year, old style--the first three of the\r\nseason--the last of the season--different days of the month--of the\r\nlunation, etc., etc. And some still look to the breastbone of a goose, in\r\nthe fall, to judge, by its whiteness, whether there is to be much snow\r\nduring the Winter, etc.\r\n\r\nThese _Almanac days should all be abandoned_; they have no foundation in\r\nphilosophy or truth. There is one proverb, however, in relation to\r\nCandlemas-day, which the \"oldest inhabitant\" will remember, and which it\r\nmay be well to retain. It has a practical application for the farmer, and\r\nin relation to the length of the winter:\r\n\r\n  \"Just half of your wood and half of your hay\r\n  Should be remaining on Candlemas-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe months, too, have a character which must be remembered and regarded.\r\n\r\n_January_ is the coldest month of the year, in most localities. The\r\natmospheric machinery reaches its extreme southern transit, for the\r\nseason, during the month--usually about the middle. It remains stationary\r\na while--usually till after the 10th of February. One or more thaws,\r\nresulting from tropical storms, occur during the month, in normal winters,\r\nbut they are of brief duration. Boreas follows close upon the retreating\r\nstorm with his icy breath. There is a remarkable uniformity in the\r\nprogress of the depression of temperature, to the extreme attained in this\r\nmonth, over the entire hemisphere. It differs in degree according to\r\nlatitude and magnetic intensity; but it progresses to that degree,\r\nwhatever it may be, with as great uniformity in a southern as northern\r\nlatitude. The table, copied from Dr. Forrey, discloses the fact, and so\r\ndoes the following one, taken from Mr. Blodget's valuable paper, published\r\nin the Patent Office Report for 1853:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE MEAN TEMPERATURE FOR EACH MONTH AT SEVERAL PLACES, VIZ.:\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                   |  Lat. | Jan. | Feb. |March.|April.| May. |June. |\r\n  |-------------------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n  |Quebec, Canada E.  |46 deg. 49'|  9.9 | 12.8 | 24.4 | 38.7 | 52.9 | 63.7 |\r\n  |New York, N.

The thaws, or tropical storms, also sometimes have a current of\r\ncold air, with snow setting under them on their northern and north-western\r\nborder. Such was the case with that investigated by Professor Loomis.\r\nJanuary is without other marked peculiarities. It shows, of course, those\r\nextremes of temperature found, to a greater or less degree, in all the\r\nmonths, and differs, as the others differ, in different seasons. Normally,\r\nin temperate latitudes, it is a healthy month. The digestive organs have\r\nrecovered from that tendency to bilious diseases which characterizes the\r\nsummer extreme northern transit, and the tendency to diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs, which characterizes the southern extreme and the\r\ncommencement of its return, is not often developed till February.\r\nFebruary, in its normal condition until after the 10th, and about the\r\nmiddle, is much like January. Often the first ten days of February are the\r\ncoldest of the season. The average of the month is a trifle higher, in\r\nmost localities, as the tables show. This results from the increasing\r\nwarmth of the latter part of the month. There are localities, however,\r\nwhere the entire month is as cold as January. Such (as will appear from\r\nBlodget's table) are Albany and Rochester, in the State of New York, and\r\nNew Orleans, in Louisiana. At most places the difference is slight, either\r\nway. South of the latitude of 40 deg. heavy snows are more likely to occur in\r\nthe last half of January and first half of February than earlier. About\r\nthe middle of the month we may expect thaws of more permanence in normal\r\nseasons. They are followed, as in January, by N. W. wind and cold weather,\r\nbut it is not usually as severe. Many years since, an observing old man\r\nsaid to me, \"_Winter's back breaks about the middle of February_.\" And I\r\nhave observed that there is usually a yielding of the extreme weather\r\nabout that period. Here, again, it is interesting and instructive to look\r\nat the tables, and see how regularly and uniformly the temperature rises\r\nin all latitudes, at the same time; as early and as rapidly at Quebec as\r\nat New Orleans or San Antonio; and subsequently rises with greatest\r\nrapidity where the descent was greatest. The elevation of temperature does\r\nnot progress northwardly, a wave of heat accompanying the sun, but is a\r\nmagneto-electric change, commencing about the same time over the whole\r\ncountry, and indeed over the hemisphere.\r\n\r\nMarch is a peculiar month--the month of what is termed, and aptly termed,\r\n\"unsettled weather.\" It, may \"come in like a lion,\" or be variable at the\r\noutset. The northern transit is fairly started, and is progressing\r\nrapidly, and there is great magnetic irritability. A reference to the\r\ntable of Dr. Lamont will show that the declination has increased with\r\ngreat rapidity. Normally, the early part is like the latter part of\r\nFebruary, and the latter part approaches the milder but still changeable\r\nweather of April. Its distinguishing feature is violent westerly wind. Not\r\nthe regular N. W. only--although that is prevalent--but a peculiar\r\nwesterly wind, ranging from W. by N. to N. W. by W., often blowing with\r\nhurricane violence. This wind was alluded to on page 130. With the change\r\nand active transit to the north, in February and in March, comes the\r\ntendency to diseases of the respiratory organs--pneumonias and lung\r\nfevers--and this is the most dangerous period of the year for aged people.\r\n\r\nApril is a milder and more agreeable month. During some period of it, in\r\nnormal seasons, and at other times in March, there is a warm, quiet,\r\ngenial, \"lamb-\"like _spell_, exceedingly favorable for oat seeding. When\r\nit comes, advantage should be taken of it, for long heavy N. E. storms are\r\nliable to occur, and frequently with snow. On the latitude of 41 deg. heavy\r\nsnow-storms are not uncommon in April. Within the last fifteen years two\r\nsuch have occurred after the 10th of the month. April, as we have seen,\r\nshould be cool and moist. If dry, the early crops are endangered by a\r\nspring drouth; if very wet, there is danger of an extreme northern\r\ntransit, and an early summer drouth. It is emphatically true that\r\n\r\n  \"April and May are the keys of the year.\"\r\n\r\nIts distinguishing peculiar feature is the gentle, _warm_, _trade_\r\nrains--\"_April showers_\"--which, in the absence of great magnetic\r\nirritability, that current drops upon us. There is great _mean_ magnetic\r\nactivity, but it is not so _irregularly excessive_ as in March.\r\n\r\nMay, in our climate, should be, and normally is, a wet month, and a cool\r\none, considering the altitude of the sun. The atmospheric machinery which\r\nthe sun moves is, however, ordinarily about six weeks behind it--the\r\nlatter reaching the tropic the 20th of June, and the former its farthest\r\nnorthern extension about six weeks later. Hence it is not a cause for\r\nalarm if May be wet and cool. The great staples, wheat, grass, and oats,\r\nare benefited; and corn, according to the proverb, will not be seriously\r\nretarded. The movable belt of excessive magneto-electric action, with its\r\ntropical electric rains, so exciting to vegetation, and its periods or\r\nterms of excessive heat, is on its way north, and sure to arrive in\r\nseason, and remain long enough to mature the corn. There have been but two\r\nseasons in this century when corn did not mature in the latitude of 41 deg..\r\nOne during the cold decade, and the cold part of it, between 1815 and\r\n1820; and the other, during the cold half of the fourth decade, between\r\n1835 and 1840.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature, if there be one, of May, is its long, and, for\r\nthe season, cool storms. These have, in different localities, different\r\nnames. In pastoral sections we hear of the \"_sheep storms_\"--those which\r\neffect the sheep severely when newly shorn--killing them or reducing them\r\nin flesh by their coldness and severity.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this too early shearing, there is an old English proverb,\r\nin \"Forster's Collection,\" viz.:\r\n\r\n  \"Shear your sheep in May,\r\n  And you will shear them all away.\"\r\n\r\nSo there are others called \"_Quaker storms_,\" which occur about the time\r\nwhen that estimable sect hold their yearly meeting. And there are other\r\nnames given in different localities to these long spring storms. But they\r\nare all _mere coincidences_--equinoctial and all.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the storms, however, the temperature rises at a mean. The\r\ndeclination is often as great as in mid-summer. The earth is growing\r\nwarmer by the increase of magneto-electric action, whatever the state of\r\nthe atmosphere. The yellow, sickly blade of corn is extending its roots\r\nand preparing to \"_jump_\" when the atmosphere becomes hot, as it is sure\r\nto do, when the machinery attains a sufficient altitude, how backward\r\nsoever it may seem to be. The farmer need not mourn over its backwardness,\r\nunless the season is a very extraordinary one, like those of 1816 and\r\n1836. The storms ensure his hay, wheat, and oat crops; the warming earth\r\nis at work with the roots of his corn, and is filling with water, and\r\npreparing for the hot and rapidly-evaporating suns of mid-summer. The\r\nearth would grow warmer if every day was cloudy.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of June the atmospheric machinery approaches its northern\r\nacme, the summer sets in, and not unfrequently, as extremely hot days\r\noccur during the latter part of the month, as at any period of the\r\nsummer. But the heat is not so continuous, or great, at a mean.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of June to the latter part of August is summer in our\r\nclimate, and during that period from one to three or four terms of extreme\r\nheat occur, continuing from one to five or six days, and possibly more,\r\nterminating finally in a belt of showers overlaid with more or less\r\ncirro-stratus condensation in the trade, and controlled by the S. E. polar\r\nwave of magnetism, and followed by a cool but gentle northerly wind.\r\nDuring these \"heated terms,\" a general showery disposition sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, appears, with isolated showers, which bring no mitigation\r\nof the heat. Not until a southern extension of them appears, followed by a\r\nN. W. air, does the term change, so far as I have observed.\r\n\r\nBy the 20th of August, in the latitude of 42 deg., an evident change of\r\ntransit is observable, by one who watches closely, although the range of\r\nthe thermometer in the day-time may not disclose it. A greater tendency to\r\ncirrus-formation is visible. The nights grow cooler in proportion to the\r\ndays. The swallows are departing, or have departed; the blackbirds, too,\r\nand the boblinks, with their winter jackets on, _their plumage all changed\r\nto the same colors_, are flocking for the same purpose, and hurrying away.\r\nThe pigeons begin to appear in flocks from the north, and the first of the\r\nblue-winged teal and black duck are seen straggling down the rivers. At\r\nthis season, and nearly coincident with the change, the peculiar annual\r\ncatarrhs return. These are colds (so called) which at some period of the\r\nperson's life were taken about or soon after the period of change, and\r\nhave returned every year, at, or near the same period. They soon become\r\n_habitual_, and no care or precaution will prevent them. I know one\r\ngentleman who has had this annual cold in August for twenty-seven years,\r\nwith entire regularity; and another who has had it nineteen years; and\r\nmany others for shorter periods. I never knew one which had recurred for\r\ntwo or three years that could be afterward prevented, or broken up. _Very\r\ninstructive are these annual catarrhs_ to those who think health worth\r\npreserving, and in relation to the change of transit.\r\n\r\n_The change is felt over the entire hemisphere._ Between the 20th of\r\nAugust and the 10th of September hurricanes originate in the tropics and\r\npursue their curving and recurving way up over us; or long \"north-easters\"\r\ncommence in the interior and pass off to E. N. E. on to the Atlantic,\r\nfollowed now in a more marked degree by the peculiar N. W. wind, so common\r\nover the entire Continent in autumn and winter.\r\n\r\nBy the 10th of September the pigeons may be seen in flocks in the morning,\r\nand just prior to the setting in of a brisk N. W. wind, hurrying away\r\nsouthward with a sagacity that we scarcely appreciate, to avoid the\r\nanticipated rigors of winter, and to be followed soon by all the migratory\r\nfeathered tribes that remain.\r\n\r\nThe nights grow cooler, although the sun shines hot in the day-time, and\r\nwoe to the person, unless with an iron constitution, who disregards the\r\nchange, and exposes himself or herself without additional protection, to\r\nits influence. Nature has taken care of those who depend upon her, or upon\r\ninstinct, for protection. The feathers of birds and water-fowl are full;\r\nthe hair and the fur are grown. Beasts and birds have been preparing for\r\nthe change, and are ready when it begins. They know that the earth is\r\nchanging. The shifting machinery is fast carrying south that excess of\r\nnegative electricity which has so much to do with giving it its summer\r\nheat. They feel its absence, even during the day, and the contrast between\r\nthat and the positively electrified northern atmosphere, which now follows\r\nevery retreating wave of condensation.\r\n\r\nThe musk-rat builds, of long grass and weeds, his floating nest in the\r\npond, that he may have a place to retire to, when the rain fills it up and\r\ndrives him from his burrow in its banks.\r\n\r\nBut man, with all his intellect, is too heedless of the change. Additional\r\nclothing is now as necessary to him as to animals, but it is burdensome to\r\nhim in the day time, and therefore he will not wear it, how much soever it\r\nwould add to his comfort and safety during the night. He stands with his\r\nthin summer soles upon the changed ground, or sits in a current, or in the\r\nnight air, less protected than the animals, and dysentery or fever sends\r\nhim to his long home. He has _intelligence_, but he lacks _instinct_. He\r\nhas time for the changes of dress which fashion may require, but none for\r\nthose which atmospherical changes demand. _Fashion_ has attention in\r\n_advance_; _death_ none till _at the door_.\r\n\r\nNow the southern line of the extra-tropical belt of rains descends upon\r\nthose who, living between the areas of magnetic intensity, have a dry\r\nseason; and the focus of precipitation in that belt descends every where.\r\n\"_Winter no come till swamps full_,\" the Indians told our fathers, and\r\nthere is truth in the remark; although like other general truths\r\nrespecting the weather, it is not always so in our climate. Rains fall\r\nduring the autumnal months, as during the spring months, and while the\r\ntransit of the machinery is active and the evaporation is less. And the\r\nmagnetic comparative rest, and the seed time and equable \"spell\" of April\r\nis reproduced in the Indian summer of autumn.\r\n\r\nThe machinery gradually and irresistibly descends, and with an excess of\r\npolar positive electricity, comes snow; Boreas controls, and winter sets\r\nin, reaching its maximum of cold in January again.\r\n\r\nRemembering, then, the differences in the normal conditions of the seasons\r\nand months, and the different characters that the winds, and storms, and\r\nclouds, and other phenomena bear in them respectively, let us now look at\r\nthe signs of foul or fair weather not herein before fully stated, upon\r\nwhich practical reliance may be placed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we must look to the forming condensation. There are\r\nmany days when the atmosphere is without visible clouds, but few when it\r\nis entirely without condensation. Such days are seen during the dry season\r\nin the trade-wind region; and with us, in mid-summer drouths, which\r\npartake of this tropical character; and when, at any season, but\r\nparticularly in winter, the N. W. wind in large volume has elevated the\r\ntrade very high. Condensation is not necessarily in form of visible cloud.\r\nIt may be of that smoky character which sometimes attends mid-summer\r\ndrouths, giving the sun a blood-red appearance; or it may be like that\r\nchange from deep azure to a \"lighter hue,\" obscuring the vision, which\r\nHumboldt describes as preceding the arrival of the inter-tropical belt of\r\nrains. Gay-Lussac, and other aeronauts, have seen a thin cloud stratum at\r\nthe height of 20,000 to 30,000 feet, not visible at the earth, although\r\nsome degree of mistiness and obscurity were observed. At that elevation\r\nthe clouds are thin, and always white and positive. Some degree of\r\nturbidness is frequent; it may occur, as we have stated, with N. W. wind,\r\nbut, if it does, the wind soon changes round to the southward.\r\n\r\nThis turbidness or mistiness, where it exists, and indicates rain, does\r\nnot disappear toward night, as it should do if but the daily cloudiness\r\nwhich results from ordinary diurnal magnetic activity, but becomes more\r\nobvious at nightfall; and, when hardly visible at mid-day, or during the\r\nafternoon, may then be observed, obscuring in a degree, the sun's rays;\r\nand, later in the evening, forming a circle round the moon. Thus Jenner--\r\n\r\n  \"Last night the sun went _pale to_ bed,\r\n  The moon in _halos_ hid her head.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, too, Virgil--\r\n\r\n  \"The sun, too, rising, and at that still hour,\r\n  When sinks his tranquil beauty in the main,\r\n  Will give thee tokens; certain tokens all,\r\n  Both those that morning brings, and balmy eve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  When Sol departs, his mighty day-task done,\r\n  How varied hues oft wander on his brow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    If the ruddy blaze\r\n  Be _dimm'd_ with _spots_, then all will wildly rage\r\n  With squalls and driving showers: on that fell night\r\n  None shall persuade me on the deep to urge\r\n  My perilous course, or quit the sheltering pier.\r\n  But if, when day returns, or when retires,\r\n  _Bright_ is the orb, then fear no coming rain:\r\n  Clear northern airs will fan the quiv'ring grove.\r\n  Lastly, the sun will teach th' observant eye\r\n  What vesper's hour shall bring; what clearing wind\r\n  Shall waft the clouds slow floating--what the South\r\n  Broods in his humid breast. Who dare belie\r\n  The constant sun?\"\r\n\r\nMore frequently this kind of condensation is sufficiently dense at\r\nnight-fall to take shape, and show a bank when the sun shines horizontally\r\nthrough a mass of it. I am now speaking of _storm_ condensation, or that\r\nwhich indicates the approach of a storm. Thunder clouds at nightfall,\r\ndark, dense, and isolated, are, of course, to be distinguished. Those,\r\nevery one understands to indicate a shower, and immediate succeeding fair\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe halos do not, in cases of incipient storm condensation, always appear.\r\nThe moon may not be present: though, in her absence, I have seen them in\r\nthe light of the primary planets; or she may be in the eastern portion of\r\nthe heavens. When this is so, and the condensation forms slowly, there may\r\nbe less appearance of it, after the sun disappears, than before, although\r\na storm is approaching, and sure to be on by the middle of next day, and\r\nperhaps with great violence. When the failure of the light no longer\r\nreveals the denser condensation in the west, the stars may shine, as did\r\nthe sun, dimly but visibly, through the partial and invisible\r\ncondensation; and one who did not notice the bank in the west, at\r\nnightfall and before dark, may be deceived by the seeming clearness of the\r\nevening. Thus Virgil--\r\n\r\n  \"Mark, with attentive eye, the rapid sun--\r\n  The varying moon that rolls its monthly round;\r\n  So shalt thou count, not vainly, on the morn;\r\n  _So the bland aspect of the tranquil night\r\n  Will ne'er beguile thee with insidious calm_.\"\r\n\r\nAll early condensation and indications derived from it, must be looked for\r\nin the west. From that quarter all storms come. These indications at\r\nnightfall are of a varied character. They may consist of primary\r\ncondensation in the trade, or of secondary condensation, scud running\r\nnorth toward a storm, the condensation of which has not yet visibly\r\nreached us, but which will extend south and pass over us. It may be a\r\nheavy bank, or consist of narrow cirrus bands. Cirro-stratus cloud banks,\r\nin the S. W., in the fall and winter, of a foggy and uniform character,\r\nare indicative of snow. The body of the storm will pass south of us, and a\r\nportion over us, the wind be north of east, and the snow will not be\r\nlikely to turn to rain before it reaches the earth, by reason of a\r\nsouthern middle current.\r\n\r\nBanks in the N. W. indicate rain at all seasons. The storm is north of us,\r\nworking southerly, and such storms rain on the southern border--in winter\r\neven--because they have the wind on that border from south of east. It\r\nmay, indeed, snow, but if so, probably in large flakes, soon turning to\r\nrain. There are other appearances at nightfall which deserve\r\nconsideration. A red sun, with smoky air, is indicative of continued dry\r\nweather, a frequent appearance in dry terms, lasting three or four days,\r\nat least, from the commencement. So is a red appearance of the sky, when\r\nthere are no clouds, indicative of a fair day following. On this subject\r\nwe have an allusion to the weather, by our Saviour while on earth, which,\r\nlike all such allusions found in the Bible, is of remarkable philosophical\r\naccuracy. It is found in Matthew, chapter xvi., verses 2 and 3: \"He\r\nanswered and said unto them, When it is evening ye say, It will be fair\r\nweather, for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather\r\nto-day, for the sky is red and lowering. O, ye hypocrites, ye _can\r\ndiscern_ the face of the sky,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother allusion to the weather, though not applicable to this point, I\r\nwill refer to in passing. It is found in Luke, chapter xii., verses 54 and\r\n55: \"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the\r\nwest straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. And when ye\r\nsee the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all very true, and might have been cited to show the universality\r\nof the phenomena. But to return.\r\n\r\nWe have an old English proverb alluding to the same phenomena, of great\r\nvalue and truth, viz.:\r\n\r\n  \"An evening red and a morning gray\r\n  Are sure signs of a fair day;\r\n  Be the evening gray and the morning red,\r\n  Put on your hat or you'll wet your head.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky is red if there be no condensation at the west to obscure the rays\r\nof the sun; if there be, it is gray, or there is a bank or cloud, and it\r\nis obscured. So if there be no condensation over, or to the east of us, in\r\nthe morning, to reflect the rays of the sun, the sky is gray; if there be\r\nsuch condensation, the sun is reflected from it, and the sky is red. Such\r\nmorning condensation is indicative of foul weather. It is, as we have\r\nsaid, the eastern edge of an approaching storm, on, or under which, the\r\nsun shines and illumines it. Thus, at night, it shines through a portion\r\nat the west, which is situate between the sun and us, making the sky gray:\r\nbut shines on, or under, a portion in the morning, east of us, but not far\r\nenough east to obscure the horizon, and the rays of the rising sun are\r\nreflected from it. In either case the red or gray appearance results from\r\nthe relative situation of the sun and the eastern edge of an approaching\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nThe following couplet of Darwin is an apt description of the morning\r\nappearance:\r\n\r\n  \"In fiery red the sun doth rise,\r\n  Then wades through clouds to mount the skies.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun is often reflected in vivid colors, from the under surface of\r\nclouds, at sunset. This is an indication of fair weather. It is evident\r\nthe sun shines through a _clear atmosphere beyond the cloud_, or his rays\r\nwould not reach and illume the lower surface of the cirro-stratus with\r\nsuch distinctness. He \"_sets clear_,\" as is said; the clouds are passing\r\noff, and there are none beyond. It is this appearance, in different forms,\r\nwhen there happen to be patches of broken, melting cirro-stratus above the\r\nhorizon, which makes the beautiful sunsets that attract attention. So the\r\nsun is reflected, in beautiful colors sometimes, from the cumulus clouds\r\nwhich have passed over to the east. The most beautiful and variegated I\r\nhave ever seen, were reflected from that imperfect cumulus condensation\r\nwhich takes place occasionally during long drouths--doubtless resembling\r\nthat which is seen over Peru, hereinbefore alluded to, as described by\r\nStewart.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, the presence of cloud condensation at the west, at\r\nnightfall, which alone indicates foul weather; but such condensation,\r\nwhatever its form, as evinces that it is not the _dissolving_ cloud of the\r\nday, but the eastern, approaching portion of a _still denser portion\r\nbeyond, through, or under which, the sun can not shine clearly, but which\r\nwholly or partially obscures it_. _Remembering this philosophy of the\r\nmatter_, the observer will soon be able to detect the various forms of\r\ncondensation which originate or exhibit themselves at nightfall, and\r\nwhether they indicate an approaching storm or not, without a more explicit\r\nspecification of them. It is an important hour for observation; \"Let not\r\nthe sun go down\" without attention.\r\n\r\nWhen the condensation is obvious, but thin, at nightfall, it may not, as I\r\nhave said, be discernible in the evening. But there are methods by which\r\nthe incipient storm condensation may be detected. The number of the stars\r\nvisible, and the _distinctness_ with which they may be seen, indicate the\r\nabsence or presence of condensation and its density. Virgil, alluding to\r\nthe indications of fair weather, says:\r\n\r\n  \"_Brightly_ the stars shine forth; Cynthia no more\r\n  _Glimmers_ obnoxious to her brother's rays;\r\n  Nor fleecy clouds float lightly through the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe brightness of the stars and the clear appearance of the moon show the\r\nabsence of condensation and the _dissolution_ of the fleecy clouds at the\r\nclose of the day is, as we have seen, always a fair-weather indication.\r\n\r\nThere is much true philosophy in the allusions of Virgil to the moon.\r\nThus--\r\n\r\n  \"When Luna first her scatter'd fires recalls,\r\n  If with _blunt horns_ she holds the _dusky_ air,\r\n  Seamen and swains predict th' abundant shower.\"\r\n\r\nThe horns, or angles of the moon will, of course, appear distinct and\r\nsharp or indistinct and blunt, in proportion to the amount of\r\ncondensation in the atmosphere which impedes the passage of the light. For\r\nthe same reason, when the moon is new, her entire disk is visible when the\r\natmosphere is very clear, by reason, as is supposed, of light reflected\r\nfrom the earth to the moon and back to us. This double reflection can only\r\ntake place when the atmosphere is very clear. Hence, Virgil alludes to it,\r\nand correctly, as an indication of continued fair weather:\r\n\r\n                  \"If (mark the ominous hour!)\r\n  The clear fourth night her lucid disk define,\r\n  That day, and all that thence successive spring,\r\n  E'en to the finished month, are calm and dry.\"\r\n\r\nProbably Virgil alluded to a month of the summer trade-wind drouth which\r\nreaches up on Southern Italy. But that appearance of the moon is\r\noccasionally seen here, and the indication is, in degree, philosophically\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat more difficult to determine what will be the result of the\r\ncondensation seen at the west in the morning, and which is not so far\r\neast, or of such a character, as to reflect the rays of the sun; for,\r\nalthough always suspicious, it is sometimes of a foggy character, and\r\ndisappears between eight and nine o'clock. If it increases in density\r\nafter ten o'clock, or is of a dense cirro-stratus character, rain may\r\ngenerally be expected. If of a decided _cirro-cumulus_ character, it is\r\ncertain to disappear. Cirro-cumulus is seen in small patches, with small,\r\ndistinct, and rounded masses, in summer, in the morning, and sometime,\r\nduring the day, after high fog has disappeared, and at other times, and is\r\nalways, when of that _distinct_ character, a fair weather indication. I\r\nhave seen it thus when the wind was blowing from the N. E., and the scud\r\nrunning toward a storm passing near, but to the south of us, when those\r\nwho relied upon the existence of the wind and scud as evidences that we\r\nwere to have the desired rain, were deceived. Thus, the couplet from an\r\nold almanac:\r\n\r\n  \"If _woolly fleeces_ strew the heavenly way,\r\n  Be sure no rain disturb the summer day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this morning condensation is not high fog, and is dense and passing\r\neast with a wavy appearance, it is very certain to rain. Jenner says:\r\n\r\n  \"The boding shepherd heaves a sigh,\r\n  _For see, a rainbow spans the sky_.\"\r\n\r\nAn old almanac had the following verse:\r\n\r\n  \"A rainbow in the morning\r\n  Is the shepherd's warning;\r\n  A rainbow at night\r\n  Is the shepherd's delight.\"\r\n\r\nSo the proverb was originally made; but as our ancestors were not\r\nshepherds, and had a horror of ocean storms, it was commonly quoted, in\r\nthis country, in the following form:\r\n\r\n  \"A rainbow in the morning,\r\n  The sailors take warning,\" etc.\r\n\r\nRainbows are not reflected from _clouds_, but falling rain, and a morning\r\nrainbow at the west is, of course, evidence that it is _actually raining\r\nthere_, and will, in all probability, pass over us. \"Thunder in the\r\nmorning, rain before night,\" is a common saying, and a true one. There is\r\na belt of showers, or showery period approaching, of unusual\r\nintensity--for thunder showers in the morning are rare. The afternoon is\r\ntheir most common period, and they are very apt to appear then, when the\r\nmorning is showery.\r\n\r\nOf the different forms of cirrus and cirro-stratus, which appear during\r\nthe day, and indicate approaching storms, or of cumulus indicative of\r\nshowers, it is difficult to give an intelligible description without very\r\nmany illustrations. I have many daguerreotype views, taken at different\r\nseasons of the year, and at a time when different forms of cirrus and\r\ncirro-stratus condensation, indicative of storms, exhibited themselves.\r\nThey differ, as I have said, and it must be remembered, very much at\r\n_different seasons_ of the year, and in _different years_, and their\r\ndelicate shades are taken with difficulty by the artist, and reproduced\r\nwith difficulty, and only at considerable expense, by the engraver; and I\r\nhave omitted them. The time will come when a knowledge of their language\r\nwill be sought for and read--when the \"countenance of the sky\" will be an\r\nobject of intelligent interest to all whose business may be affected by\r\nthe weather, or who love to learn of nature. But it is not yet. This is\r\nthe age of theory and speculation. The time of actual, practical,\r\nconnected observation and prognostication, which may justify expensive\r\nillustration, is yet to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in the general plates representations of several\r\nkinds of cirri. They are delicate, always white, more or less fibrous, and\r\nform in the upper part of the trade or the adjoining atmosphere above it.\r\nTheir character and elevation should be studied, and the observer should\r\nbe careful to distinguish which is the most elevated. Not unfrequently it\r\nmay seem, to a hasty observer, that the cirrus is below the cirro-stratus\r\nor forming stratus. But the genuine cirrus never is. It forms near, and\r\nabove, the point of congelation, and is often composed of crystals of ice\r\nor snow. If they fall, they melt and evaporate, when there is no storm,\r\nbefore reaching the earth. Aeronauts have met with them and their crystals\r\nwhen there was no fall of moisture at the surface of the earth; and the\r\nangles of reflection exhibited by halos and other optical phenomena which\r\nform in them, enable us to detect their crystallization and the form of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThey are produced by electric changes which condense the vapor, and the\r\ncoldness of the air at that elevation freezes it at the _instant of its\r\ncondensation_.\r\n\r\nCongelation is crystallization, and all crystallization is electric, or\r\nmagneto-electric. The snow-flakes differ in form and size according to the\r\nsuddenness of the condensation, the amount of moisture condensed, the\r\npolarity of the strata through which they pass, and their consequent\r\nattraction and adhesion to each other.\r\n\r\nThe connection of electricity with these formations of cirri has\r\nfrequently been admitted, and it is perfectly obvious that the long\r\nfibrous bands, shooting from horizon to horizon, could not be formed by\r\ncommingling of currents any more than the perfectly isolated, distinct,\r\nenlarging-outward cumulus hail-storm, could be so formed. Cirri form at\r\nthe line of meeting, between the trade and the upper atmosphere, and in\r\none or the other, or both, very much according to the season, and the\r\nsuddenness with which storms are produced. These often _induce_ a layer of\r\ncirro-stratus or stratus at the lower line of the counter-trade, and in\r\nthe surface-atmosphere, which precipitates; and this operation is clearly\r\ndiscernible, and very frequently, before gentle rains. Condensation in the\r\nwhole body of the trade is usually in the form of turbidness or mistiness,\r\na bank or incipient stratus, without cirri.\r\n\r\nIt seems matter of astonishment that water should float so far condensed,\r\nin strata where the air is so much lighter, without being precipitated.\r\nBut electric attraction and repulsion between the different strata and the\r\nvesicles, explain it.\r\n\r\nIn mid-winter, the cirrus forms are prevalent and most distinct. After\r\nsevere cold weather, when a storm approaches, the cirri form in long,\r\nnarrow threads, parallel to each other, extending from about W. S. W. to\r\nE. N. E., gradually thickening and forming, or inducing, cirro-stratus and\r\nstratus, and dropping snow. This form is called the _linear_-cirrus. The\r\ntufted, and other fibrous forms, are seen in patches also, in great\r\ndistinctness, during these mid-winter days, when the wind gets around to\r\nthe southward, and the weather is pleasant. Such days are called\r\n\"_weather-breeders_,\" and their _offspring_ the patches of cirrus, which\r\nare to extend and compose, or induce the storm, and indeed are an advance\r\npart of it, are then never absent. A clear, moderate day, in a normal\r\nwinter, with wind from any southern point, however light, between the 1st\r\nof January and the middle of February, without these patches of cirrus, is\r\nvery uncommon. Watch and see whether they tend to cirro-stratus, or\r\nwhether the wind gets around to the N. W. at nightfall, and they\r\ndisappear. If the former, a storm may be expected; if the latter, fair\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThus there are three peculiarities attending the forming cirrus of\r\nmid-winter (1st of January to 10th of February): long, fibrous, parallel\r\nbands in the morning (linear cirrus), gradually coalescing as the day\r\nadvances, after severe cold; the comoid, curled, or tufted cirrus, in\r\ncurling bunches, called \"_mares'-tails_,\" and the _transverse_, when the\r\nfibers are in bands or threads, which are not parallel, but cross each\r\nother at angles, more or less acute. The two former varieties are\r\nrepresented on Figure 5, page 26, indicated by one bird, but the last form\r\nis a very prevalent one in our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nVarious names have been given to different forms of _cirro-stratus_. Those\r\nrepresented in Figure 5, page 26, are the \"_cymoid_\" on the right, the\r\n\"_mottled_\" on the left, below the cirro-cumulus; and the \"_linear_\"\r\nbelow that. The form known as the \"_mackerel sky_\" is not represented\r\nthere. It consists of regular forms, resembling the _waves_ on the surface\r\nof the water when the wind blows a gentle breeze. But the _wavy_ form, and\r\nof all sizes, is very frequently assumed by cirro-stratus, which is\r\nrapidly condensing, and turning to stratus. In the \"mackerel sky,\"\r\nstrictly so called, the waves are small, parallel, nearly distinct and\r\nequi-distant, and resembling the appearance of a school of mackerel,\r\nswimming in the same direction, one above another. All _wavy_ forms of\r\ncirro-stratus indicate a disposition to increased condensation and rain.\r\nWhen the waves are very large and dense, and cross obliquely, or unite at\r\none end, rain is very certain to fall soon, if the line of progress of the\r\ncondensation is over the observer, and the clouds are seen in the western\r\nor N. W. quarter of the sky.\r\n\r\nBut there are few forms which are not occasionally seen when no rain or\r\nsnow falls. The intensity of the electric action which produces them may\r\nnot be sufficient to effect precipitation, or they may be the attendant,\r\nattenuated _lateral_ condensation, which frequently \"thins out\" a\r\nconsiderable distance from the dense, precipitating portions of the storm.\r\n\r\nIf that denser portion is north of us, the probabilities of rain are\r\ngreater, for there is always a probability that the storm may be of the\r\ncharacter which is extended south, by a polar wave. The observer must\r\nwatch the formation of cirri, and the different forms of cirro-stratus and\r\nstratus, and become familiar with their appearance. It is not a difficult\r\ntask. With the aid of a few general directions he will soon be familiar\r\nwith them:\r\n\r\n1. Get a correct idea of the different characters of the primary clouds.\r\nThe true fibrous _cirrus_--the different forms of _cirro-stratus_--the\r\nsmooth, uniform _stratus_--the _cirro-cumulus_, which is nothing but a\r\ncirro-stratus, separated into _distinct masses_ by the repulsion of static\r\nelectricity--and the _cumulus_, too distinct ever to be mistaken. There is\r\nno difficulty, except with the varied forms of cirro-stratus. It is\r\nuseless to attempt to give, or the observer to rely on, names for these\r\nnumerous forms, without as numerous illustrations. Those in use are rarely\r\napplied correctly. I have never met with ten persons who applied even the\r\nterm \"mackerel sky\" to the same precise form of cirro-stratus. In relation\r\nto all of them it is to be observed that polar belts of condensation, and\r\nlocal appearances of considerable extent, are often too feeble in action\r\nto precipitate, even when the mackerel form is present; and all may be the\r\nlateral attendants of passing storms. Therefore,\r\n\r\n2. Satisfy yourself whether the cirrus or cirro-stratus increases in\r\ndensity and tends to the formation, or induction, of stratus; and whether\r\nit is isolated, or an extension of the condensation of a storm, and if the\r\nlatter, _where that storm is_. The time will come when an intelligent use\r\nof the telegraph will do this for you.\r\n\r\n3. Look also to the character of the wind, if there be any. On this\r\nsubject I have perhaps said all that is necessary in the preceding pages.\r\nNext to condensation, the direction and character of the wind is the most\r\nvaluable prognostic. Indeed it often tells us that a storm is approaching,\r\nand the quarter from which it will come, and its character, before the\r\ncondensation is visible.\r\n\r\n4. See if there is any _secondary_ condensation or scud. These are\r\nsometimes seen running toward a storm, when there are not distinct clouds\r\nvisible in the western horizon, at nightfall, or in the evening, as in the\r\ninstance stated in the introduction, and sometimes from the north-east, as\r\nin cases heretofore so often stated. But the easterly scud do not often\r\nform in winter, until after the cirrus has passed into the form of\r\ncirro-stratus, or has induced the latter forms in the inferior portion of\r\nthe trade, or the surface atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe inductive effect of the primary condensation, therefore, is not\r\nalways, and especially in winter, sufficient to create the easterly\r\ncurrent and scud, and it is often the case that the easterly wind is not\r\nfelt, or the scud seen, in snow-storms, until the snow has begun to fall,\r\nand the first snow will fall with a S. W. air, as I have heretofore\r\nstated. But when the condensation has so far advanced toward stratus that\r\nthe easterly wind and scud are obvious, there is little or no doubt that\r\nrain or snow will fall speedily. The occasional occurrence of easterly\r\nwind and scud, without rain, however--dry north-easters, as I have termed\r\nthem--in connection with storms passing south of us, or condensation too\r\nfeeble to precipitate, should be remembered. The long, dry,\r\nnorth-easterly winds of spring have been attributed to the icebergs, but\r\nthey are overlaid by feeble stratus or cirro-stratus condensation, or are\r\nthe result of attraction, by a more southern precipitation. The observer\r\nmust be careful to distinguish between the various forms of N. W. scud and\r\ncirro-stratus, which they sometimes resemble. This he may do _from the\r\ndirection in which they move_. Cirro-stratus always moves from some point\r\nbetween S. S. W. and W. S. W. to some point between N. N. E. and E. N. E.\r\nThe various forms of N. W. scud move to the S. E. The March, foggy scud,\r\nfrom between W. and N. W., rarely have any cirro-stratus above them, but\r\nrather a peculiar turbid condensation.\r\n\r\nThe character of the primary condensation, the direction and force of the\r\nwind, and the direction of the secondary condensation or scud, must be the\r\nmain reliance of the observer. But I must reiterate that they all differ\r\nin different kinds of storms, in different seasons of the same year, and\r\nthe same seasons of different years; and the observer must be careful to\r\nmake due allowance for those differences.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, divers other secondary signs, which, although not\r\nalone to be relied upon, will aid the observer, if carefully studied, when\r\nthe character of the clouds, and the pressure of easterly or southerly\r\nwind and scud, are not decisive. Of these, a large class are electrical.\r\n\r\nThe smoke descends the adjoining chimney-flues, or outside of the chimney,\r\ntoward the ground.\r\n\r\nThus, Darwin, as quoted by Hone:\r\n\r\n  \"The smoke from chimneys right ascends,\r\n  Then, _spreading_, back to earth it bends.\"\r\n\r\nSmoke is electrified _positively_, by the act of combustion; the earth and\r\nthe adjacent atmosphere, when storms are gathering or approaching, is\r\n_negative_. Hence the smoke spreads, and is attracted downward by an\r\nopposite electricity. On the other hand, it is interesting to see, at\r\nother times, and when the difference in temperature is not material, but\r\nthe whole atmosphere is positive, with what rapidity and compactness the\r\nsmoke will ascend in a _straight and elevated column_ from the chimney,\r\nrepelled by a similar electricity. I am aware it is generally supposed the\r\nsmoke descends because the _air is lighter_. But it is a mistake. I have\r\nseen it descend when the barometer was at 30 deg..60, or .60 above the mean.\r\n\r\nThere is, too, a draught downward in chimneys, in such cases when there is\r\nno smoke or fire in any of its flues. Thus Jenner says: \"The soot falls\r\ndown;\" whether he meant by this that there was an actual fall of soot\r\nother than what is occasioned by the rain falling in through the chimney\r\ntop, and disturbing the soot, as sometimes happens, I do not know. It\r\noccurs rarely, and is of very little practical importance. But every\r\nhousewife knows that chimneys, which have been used in winter, and are\r\nfull of soot, _smell_ before storms. The odor results from a downward\r\ndraught and the dampness of the air. So the smoke from one flue will\r\ndescend another, into some unused room, on such occasions. Another class\r\nof these electrical signs are felt by those who are suffering from chronic\r\ndiseases, which have affected the nerves and made them sensitive. Thus\r\nJenner:\r\n\r\n  \"Old Betty's joints are on the rack.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Hone adds:\r\n\r\n  \"Her corns with shooting pains torment her,\r\n  And to her bed untimely send her.\"\r\n\r\nBut Old Betty's rheumatism or corns are not alone in this. Those whose\r\nbones have been broken feel it. All invalids feel it. And, indeed, all\r\nobserving healthy persons may, and do, although all are not distinctly\r\nconscious of it. It is common for such to say, I feel sleepy, or I feel\r\ndull, or, It _feels_ like snow, or _feels_ like rain, and thus from their\r\nown feelings to be able to predict, not only falling weather, but its\r\n_character_, whether snow or rain, at a time when either may occur\r\nconsistently with appearances.\r\n\r\nThis change is a change from the positive electricity which is so\r\ncongenial to the active--\"bracing\" is the usual term--to negative and\r\ndamp--for this change is accompanied by condensation, as I believe all\r\nchanges from positive to negative are. Certain it is, if the atmosphere is\r\nhighly charged with negative electricity, condensation takes place; if\r\nwith positive, evaporation. Perhaps it is a change of the associated\r\nelectricity which accompanies magnetism, and not of the free atmospheric\r\nelectricity alone. Hence another phenomenon alluded to by Jenner:\r\n\r\n  \"The walls are damp, the ditches smell.\"\r\n\r\nThere are localities where this dampness is very obvious. The celebrated\r\nWilliam Cobbett, many years since, when a farmer on Long Island, observed\r\nand published the fact that the stones grew damp before a storm. I know of\r\nflagging stones that usually grow damp two or three hours before rain,\r\nespecially in spring and fall, and every step taken upon them is made\r\nvisible by a corresponding increase of condensation.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of this takes place just before the close of storms. Flagging\r\nstones, and walls under cover, will frequently become dry before the rain\r\nceases. The negative electricity becomes less as the positive prevails,\r\nalthough the clouds above are still dropping rain.\r\n\r\nIn the comparatively moist, showery climate of England, these changes from\r\npositive to negative alternate rapidly between successive showers; but\r\nobservations of electric phenomena, or of clouds, in that climate, are\r\nnot, without qualification, safe guides for us.\r\n\r\nSo \"the ditches smell,\" particularly in the evening before a rain, when\r\nthe immediate surface-atmosphere is charged with negative electricity, and\r\nthe _condensing moisture_ prevents the diffusion of the odors. For the\r\nsame reason the candle will not relight, and there is crackling in the\r\nashes or lamp. Thus, again, Virgil:\r\n\r\n  \"Maidens that nightly toil the tangled fleece\r\n  Divine the coming tempest; in the lamp\r\n  _Crackles_ the oil, the gathering wick grows dim.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil did not live in our cold climate, and knew nothing of the crackling\r\nin the fire, or in the ashes or coals which remain after the wood is\r\nconsumed. The lamp exhibits it on a smaller scale, and perhaps he had\r\nnoticed it when in company with the maidens. But it is sometimes\r\nnoticeable even in the lamp or candle with us. A small particle of\r\nmoisture will produce it, in a marked degree, at any time.\r\n\r\nIn winter, when the air is highly positive and cold, the candle can be\r\nblown out, and by another puff of the breath relighted, with ease. But\r\nwhen the electricity before a storm becomes negative, and partial\r\ncondensation takes place, this can not be done. This partial condensation\r\nbefore storms and showers shows itself upon vessels containing cold-water,\r\nin summer. It seems to be the received opinion, that the condensation is\r\nevidence of a greater _quantity_ of moisture in the atmosphere. But this,\r\ntoo, is a mistake, and hence the little reliance to be placed on\r\nhygrometers.\r\n\r\nThis partial condensation is sometimes visible. When the sun shines\r\nclearly, at the east or west, through a _small opening_ in the clouds, the\r\ncondensing vapor is shown by the streaks of sunlight, just as the fine\r\nparticles of dust are seen in a dark room, when a few rays of sunlight are\r\nadmitted through a small aperture. This phenomenon is often observed, and\r\nit is said of it--\"It's a going to rain; _the sun is drawing water_.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil alludes to this as seen in the east in the morning, thus:\r\n\r\n  \"But when beneath the dawn _red-fingered rays_\r\n  Through the dense band of clouds _diverging_ break,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ill does the leaf defend the mellowing grape;\r\n  Leaps on the noisy roof the plenteous hail,\r\n  Fearfully crackling.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well ascertained that storm-clouds of great intensity have polarity\r\nin the different portions, and that in the less intense magneto-electrical\r\nclimate of England isolated showers are often of this character--the\r\npolarity existing in rings. Showers are doubtless thus found with us. Mr.\r\nWise got into one of them; see his description (Theory and Practice of\r\nAeronautics page 240).\r\n\r\nI have, in another place, alluded to the upward attraction of the dust\r\nbeneath the advance condensation of a shower. Jenner alludes to it in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  \"The whirling winds the _dust_ obeys,\r\n  And in the rapid eddy plays.\"\r\n\r\nSo Virgil:\r\n\r\n  \"Light chaff and leaflets, _flitting, fill the air_,\r\n  And sportive feathers circle on the lake.\"\r\n\r\nAll these are electrical.\r\n\r\nIn England, where the action of such isolated clouds is less intense, the\r\ndifferent electricities in different portions of the cloud, whose opposite\r\nand changing action produce all the phenomena, the condensation, the cold\r\nand congelation, the currents, etc., have been accurately ascertained. We\r\ncan not get into the situation occupied by Mr. Wise. But every man may\r\nobserve these _intestine motions_ occasionally, in the advance\r\ncondensation of an isolated thunder-shower, in front of, but near the\r\nsmooth line of falling rain. They are more lateral than upward or\r\ndownward, and are often exceedingly rapid in movement.\r\n\r\nI have said that hail has often been found to fall from particular and\r\nwell-defined portions of a cloud, and rain from the other portions, the\r\nhail being positive, and rain negative. An instance of very striking\r\ncharacter may be found in Espy's Philosophy of Storms (Introduction, page\r\nxx.) Doubtless in all cases thunder-showers, which are isolated and\r\ndistinct, have opposite electricity in different portions, to whose active\r\nagency all the phenomena are owing. And the return of electricity to the\r\nearth in the rain explains the greater fertilizing effect of the latter\r\ncompared With all artificial watering. He was a true philosopher who\r\nattempted to stimulate vegetation by electricity.\r\n\r\nSounds may sometimes aid the observer in doubtful cases in foretelling the\r\nweather. The roar of the surf, or breaking of the waves on the shore, when\r\ngreat bodies of water are disturbed by a precedent storm-wind, often heard\r\nbefore the wind is perceived on the land, I have already alluded to. And\r\nthus Virgil:\r\n\r\n  \"When storms are brooding--in the _leeward gulf_\r\n  Dash the swelled waves; the mighty mountains pour\r\n  A harsh, dull murmur; far along the beach\r\n  Rolls the deep rushing roar.\"\r\n\r\nThe moaning or whistling of the wind all have noticed. It is not uncommon\r\nto hear the expression, \"The wind sounds like rain.\" Jenner says:\r\n\r\n  \"The _hollow_ winds begin to blow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Virgil:\r\n\r\n  \"The _whispering_ grove\r\n  Betrays the gathering elemental strife.\"\r\n\r\nThis whispering is the motion of the leaves; and they are often stirred by\r\na peculiar motion which is not that of wind. Sometimes every leaf upon a\r\ntree may be seen _vibrating_ with an _upward and downward_ motion, when\r\nthere is not wind enough to stir a twig. This interesting phenomenon is\r\nelectrical. Trees, and all vegetables, confessedly discharge electricity,\r\nand such discharges move the leaves, when very active.\r\n\r\nWith us, sounds can be heard more distinctly from the east or south,\r\nbefore storms, according to the character of the coming wind. Howard\r\nmentions an instance when he heard carriages five miles off. Steamboat\r\npaddles, rail-road cars, and other sounds, are often heard a great\r\ndistance. The distance at which the now common steam-whistle is heard, and\r\nthe direction, is not an unimportant auxiliary indication of the weather.\r\nHoward attributes these peculiar phenomena to the \"_sounding board_,\" made\r\nby the _stratum of cloud_; but sounds may be heard from the north-west,\r\nwhen there is no condensation, and the wind is from that quarter, and also\r\nfrom the east when it is not cloudy; and in a level country the village\r\nbells often tell the direction of the current of air just over our heads\r\nwhen we do not feel it at the surface. The wind is undoubtedly moving in a\r\nrapid, and perhaps invisible current, not far above us. If from the east\r\nor south, it betokens rain; if from the western quarter, fair weather.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the different animals furnish a considerable portion of the\r\nsigns alluded to by Virgil and Jenner, and are never unimportant auxiliary\r\nevidence of the approaching changes, whether from dry to wet, or wet to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nThe observer will find, in the conduct of our birds and animals,\r\nespecially those which are not domestic, ample evidence of the truth of\r\nthe descriptions of Virgil. He denies the animals and birds foresight, but\r\nhe does not seem to have observed that the swallow leaves for the south as\r\nsoon as the _autumnal_ change begins to be felt, and in August; nor the\r\nevident sagacity of other _migratory_ birds. They do not act from the\r\n\"_varying impulse_\" produced by an actual state of things, but a knowledge\r\nor apprehension of those which are to come. This is nothing more or less\r\nthan foresight. So foresight tends to prudence and skill, and they\r\nexercise both, and with reference to the future. The goldfinch does not\r\nbuild her nest in the hole of the tree, or in the crotch of the limb; but\r\n_hangs it_ with _exquisite skill_ on the slender _waving, outward branch_,\r\nwhere no animal, or larger bird, or any depredator, can be sustained. She\r\nis not more timid than others; why does she invariably thus build? What\r\nmakes her \"_impulses_\" differ from those of other birds, and always in the\r\n_same manner_?\r\n\r\nJenner, too, has grouped, in admirably descriptive language, many of the\r\npeculiarities exhibited by animals and birds before approaching storms,\r\nsome of which exhibit foresight, and others not.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the rooster, who keeps ceaseless watch over his harem, is the most\r\nreliable weather-watcher we have. In my earlier days, when it was the\r\npractice to keep valuable birds of the kind much longer than it now is,\r\nand they had opportunity to become _experienced_, it was interesting to\r\nobserve how closely they watched the weather. I well remember a venerable\r\nchanticleer, who, perched on the tree among his hens, would always\r\nforetell the coming storm of the morrow, by sounding forth _in the\r\nevening_, and _often_, his defiant note. Such note in the evening was\r\ninvariable evidence of foul weather. And during the night, their earlier\r\nand more frequent crowing is often indicative of it. It is, however, in\r\nthe earlier part of the day, in doubtful cases, that no inconsiderable\r\nreliance may be placed on their sagacity. Often, when a storm is gathering\r\nin the forenoon, they will announce it by an almost incessant crowing. The\r\nhabits of an _experienced_, old-fashioned bird, of this kind, will well\r\nrepay attention; but I can not answer for the Shanghai and other _fancy\r\nbreeds_.\r\n\r\nJenner says:\r\n\r\n  \"The leech disturbed, is newly risen\r\n  Quite to the summit of his prison.\"\r\n\r\nFew have had, or will have, opportunities to observe this, but it is\r\nstrikingly true. It is difficult to conceive how mere condensation, from\r\nan increase of vapor in the atmosphere, should be foreseen by the leech in\r\nhis watery prison. It is obvious, I think, there is an electric change\r\nwhich reaches him, as it does the whole animal creation, the once broken\r\nbones, and the joints of Aunt Betty. Thus much of the philosophy of signs.\r\n\r\n_The barometer_ is a useful instrument, in connection with observations of\r\nthe other phenomena. It is especially useful to the sailor, as its\r\nindications relative to the winds are much the most certain. But it is\r\nnot, _alone_, to be relied upon. This is well settled, although the\r\nreasons for it have not been understood. Why it should rise sometimes\r\nbefore storms, in opposition to the general rule--or fall at others\r\nwithout rain--or rise occasionally during the heaviest gales, has been a\r\nmystery, and impaired the confidence in its accuracy and usefulness even\r\nof the class of philosophers of whom Sir George Harvey spoke, in the\r\nsentence quoted in the introduction. But, as I have already intimated, it\r\nis all very intelligible.\r\n\r\nI have said that the barometer has no fair weather standard--the mean of\r\n30 inches at the level of the sea being an _average_ of the _fair weather_\r\nelevations and the _foul weather_ depressions. Its fair weather position,\r\nit would seem, must be above the mean, therefore, and as much above as its\r\nfoul weather depressions are below. But this is not precisely true. Its\r\nextreme fair weather range is 31 inches, and it rarely reaches that; while\r\nits lowest storm range is down to 28, and is the most often reached of\r\nthe two. My barometer stands about 40 feet above ordinary high-water mark.\r\nIt is not a \"wheel,\" but an open, \"scale\" barometer, and a perfectly good\r\none. Its most reliable fair weather standard is about 30-30/100 inches. It\r\nis its _most common summer, set fair position_, but that position is often\r\nat other and different elevations, at other periods of the year, during\r\nfair weather. The reader must observe for his own locality, and satisfy\r\nhimself what the most common set fair position for the barometer is, at\r\nthe different periods of the year, where he resides. When he has\r\nascertained this, he may apply the following principles to illustrate its\r\nexceptional action, and in judging of the future of the weather:\r\n\r\n1st. _As to its rise before storms._--Supposing it to have been\r\nstationary, at or about a set fair position, _for the period_, and for one\r\nor two or more days, a very _gradual_ and _moderate_ rise is an indication\r\nof continued fair weather; and a _sudden_ and _considerable rise_ is\r\nindicative of a storm. If the sudden and considerable rise occurs in the\r\nlatter part of spring, summer, or early autumn, it indicates a storm of\r\nthe _first_ or _third classes_ described in Chapter X., if in winter, a\r\nstorm of the _first class_ only. If the elevation is _very_ sudden and\r\nconsiderable, the storm will probably be _severe_. The philosophy of this,\r\naccording to my present apprehension of it, is, that these storms present\r\nan _extended easterly front_--_settle very near the earth_--and _have a\r\nrapid progress_--thus accumulating the atmosphere somewhat, in advance of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2d. _As to its fall before storms without previous rise._--This is always\r\nvery regular before the second class of storms, or polar belts of showers\r\nand storms. It is very fairly exemplified in the table from Reid, on page\r\n329. The barometer, so far as I have opportunity to observe, does not rise\r\nfrom a stationary position on the approach of this class of storms. At the\r\ncommencement of heated, summer, dry terms, my barometer has most\r\nfrequently ranged at about 30.30, and gradually, but slowly, fallen below\r\n30 inches before the belt of showers arrived, and the term closed. The\r\nfourth rule of Dalton (Meteorology, page 183) indicates a similar law in\r\nEngland. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"In summer, after a long continuance of fair weather, with the\r\n     barometer high, it generally falls gradually, and for one, two, or\r\n     more days, before there is much appearance of rain. If the fall be\r\n     sudden and great for the season, it will probably be followed by\r\n     thunder.\"\r\n\r\n3d. _It falls frequently and considerably without rain._--This is owing to\r\nthe fact that _all_ regular, periodic efforts at condensation do not\r\nresult in rain. The second, third, and fourth classes of storms described,\r\nmay not (as we have said) _be sufficiently active to precipitate_,\r\nalthough the _series of phenomena_ (including the fall of the barometer)\r\nmay be, in other respects, perfect. Such an instance may be found in\r\nReid's table, on page 329, and on the 11th of the month. But the fall in\r\nsuch cases is not as great, unless the wind be violent.\r\n\r\n4th. _It rises during considerable gales._--But these are of the kind so\r\noften alluded to--viz., the N. W., in the northern hemisphere, and the S.\r\nW., in the southern; and the _philosophy_ of it has been explained, and is\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations, the reader will be able to understand, and\r\npractically apply, the barometric changes, in connection with the other\r\nphenomena, in forming an opinion of the weather.\r\n\r\n_The thermometer_ is also an auxiliary. It _rises_, during the winter half\r\nof the year, in the _advance portion of the storm_, and falls when it\r\npasses off again; and the reverse is true, as we have seen, when its range\r\nis very high in summer. It is, therefore, to some extent, a useful\r\nauxiliary, although of minor importance.\r\n\r\n_The hygrometer_ is of less importance still. It is not in general use as\r\na practical guide to the changes of the weather, and does not deserve to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nA question, which has been much mooted, deserves a passing notice in this\r\nconnection--viz., whether our climate has gradually become ameliorated and\r\nmilder on the eastern part of our continent, since its settlement. I have\r\nnot space left for its discussion. Humboldt (Aspects of Nature, page 103)\r\nis of opinion that there has been no material change. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"The statements so frequently advanced, although unsupported by\r\n     measurements, that since the first European settlements in New\r\n     England, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the destruction of many forests\r\n     on both sides of the Alleghanys, has rendered the climate more\r\n     equable--making the winters milder and the summers cooler--are now\r\n     generally discredited. No series of thermometric observations worthy\r\n     of confidence extend further back, in the United States, than\r\n     seventy-eight years. We find, from the Philadelphia observations,\r\n     that from 1771 to 1824, the mean annual heat has hardly risen 2 deg..7\r\n     Fahrenheit--an increase that may fairly be ascribed to the extension\r\n     of the town, its greater population, and to the numerous\r\n     steam-engines. This annual increase of temperature may also be owing\r\n     to accident, for in the same period I find that there was an increase\r\n     of the mean winter temperature of 2 deg. Fahrenheit; but, with this\r\n     exception, the seasons had all become somewhat warmer. Thirty-three\r\n     years' observation, at Salem, in Massachusetts, show scarcely any\r\n     difference, the mean of each one oscillating within 1 deg. of Fahrenheit,\r\n     about the mean of the whole number; and the winters of Salem, instead\r\n     of having been rendered more mild, as conjectured, from the\r\n     eradication of the forests, have become colder, by 4 deg. Fahrenheit,\r\n     during the last thirty-three years.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts hereinbefore stated show that there is nothing like a _regular_\r\namelioration; that the seasons differ during the same decade, and\r\ndifferent decades. The cold decade, from 1811 to 1820, has not been\r\nreproduced. But it may be, and we know not how soon. Since that period\r\nthere has certainly been a change--for even the cold period from 1835 to\r\n1840 did not equal that from 1815 to 1820, nor indeed those of 1775 to\r\n1780 or 1795 to 1800. But as these variations, so far as we are enabled to\r\njudge, depend upon the varying influence of the sun's rays, and of\r\nvolcanic action, it is impossible to say that equally cold periods will\r\nnot return, during the latter half of this century.\r\n\r\nIf the influence of the sun was constant, and volcanic action regular, two\r\ncauses would tend to modify the seasons:\r\n\r\n1st. The exposure of the surface to a more effective action of the solar\r\nrays, by a removal of the forests, and by drainage. That such action would\r\nbe more effective upon a surface thus uncovered and drained, can not be\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\n2d. _The movement of the area of magnetic intensity, and the magnetic\r\npole, to the west._--There is such a movement, and its progress can be\r\nmeasured by the increase of declination on the east of it, and its\r\ndecrease on the west. And the effect of it on climate is unquestionable.\r\nIn all probability it has had an influence upon ours; and a removal of\r\nthat area and pole still further west--60 deg. or 80 deg.--would change the\r\nlocation of the concentrated trade, and the Gulf Stream, and restore to\r\nGreenland the fertility she once had, and which the Faroe Islands now\r\nenjoy. And, on the other hand, its removal as far east of its present\r\nposition would again depopulate Greenland, and render it again\r\ninaccessible. But I can not pursue this subject.\r\n\r\nFinally, assistance may be derived from the occasional, although\r\nimperfect, accounts of the state of the weather elsewhere, which the\r\nnewspapers afford. I have been much indebted to the Associated Press of\r\nNew York for intelligence contained in their telegraphic reports.\r\nOccasionally they have been very full and instructive.\r\n\r\nOn this point, however, there is less of reality in the present than of\r\nhope in the future. The time must come when the collection and\r\ndissemination of meteorological truth, will be deemed an object of\r\nnational importance, and national duty. Population is increasing, by\r\nimmigration and propagation, in a rapidly progressive ratio. There has\r\nbeen great danger that it would outrun agricultural production. A short\r\ncrop this year would have been disastrous to our prosperity--and the\r\ndanger was imminent. Every description of business, and every financial\r\ncircle, felt that fever of anxiety it was so well calculated to induce.\r\nThe importance of extended agricultural production, and the dependence of\r\nall classes upon its success, are now in a greater measure appreciated;\r\nand none can fail to see the value of a correct understanding of the\r\nweather to the agriculturist, how short-sighted soever they may be, in\r\nrelation to its direct influence upon their own prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nOur country is, physically, a most favored one. The facts disclosed or\r\nalluded to in this volume show that it is without a parallel on the face\r\nof the globe; and our facilities for meteorological observation, and the\r\nascertainment and practical application of meteorological truth, are\r\nequally pre-eminent. The great extent and unbroken surface of the eastern\r\nportion of the continent; its excessive supply of magnetism and\r\natmospheric currents, and the consequent marked character of the\r\nphenomena; the existence and prospective increase of telegraph lines over\r\nmost of its surface; the homogeneous and energetic character of a\r\npopulation united, upon so large a surface, under one government; the\r\nfreedom of that government from debt, and the excess of its revenue; the\r\npossession of a National Observatory, with a competent philosopher at its\r\nhead; and a national institution, liberally endowed, and adapted to the\r\ncollection and diffusion of practical and scientific intelligence, give\r\nus an opportunity and a capacity for connected observation and\r\ninvestigation, and an ability to profit by it, that no other nation can\r\nboast.\r\n\r\nWe have, too, a just national pride. Our exploring ships have penetrated\r\nand made discoveries in both hemispheres, and our travelers have visited\r\nsuccessfully every clime; and thus our national interests, and\r\nobligations, and pride, demand an organization, practical and permanent,\r\nin relation to this subject, and the time will come when we shall have it.\r\n\r\nWhen that time comes--when the present _limited horizon_ of each of us is\r\n_practically extended over the entire country_--and when the actual state\r\nof the weather over every part of it is known, at the same time, to the\r\ninhabitants of every other, and every where _read in the light of a\r\ncorrect philosophy_, prognostication will be comparatively simple and\r\ncertain; and A PROGRESS will have been made, productive of an amount of\r\npecuniary, intellectual, and social benefit to the people, which can not\r\nbe overestimated. May it come before the shadows of the night of death\r\nhave gathered around us, that we may have a more perfect view of that\r\natmospheric machinery which distinguishes our planet from others, and is,\r\nwith such infinite wisdom, adapted to make it a fit habitation for man!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this work was completed I have received a very valuable publication,\r\nentitled, the \"Army Meteorological Register.\" It is a compilation of the\r\nobservations made by the officers of the medical department of the army,\r\nat the military Posts of the United States, from 1843 to 1854 inclusive,\r\nprepared under the supervision of the Surgeon-general, and published by\r\ndirection of the Secretary of War. To this, there is appended a report or\r\ngeneral review of the prominent features of American climatology, so far\r\nas the basis afforded by the published observation of the army medical\r\nBureau would warrant positive deduction, by Mr. Lorin Blodget, a\r\ndistinguished meteorologist, accompanied by temperature and rain charts,\r\nfor each of the four seasons;--exhibiting the various local differences\r\nand peculiarities relative to temperature and precipitation in each.\r\n\r\nThese local differences and peculiarities and contrasts are deduced and\r\ndelineated by Mr. Blodget with much ability. He was fettered, however, by\r\nthe prevailing calorific theories, and the unfortunate practice of\r\ngrouping the phenomena into means for the seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn,\r\nand Winter, which grouping is arbitrary, and comparatively uninstructive.\r\nHence, he failed to discover what the tables and summaries most clearly\r\ndisclose--the principles and system unfolded in the foregoing work.\r\n\r\nBut the summaries of this register contain observations made at posts in\r\nWestern and Southwestern Texas, in Kansas and Nebraska, and in New Mexico\r\nand California, where there has been a dearth of such observations\r\nhitherto, and enable me to demonstrate, more conclusively, and I think so\r\nthat none can fail to understand it, the truth of the philosophy I have\r\nendeavored to exhibit.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I will take a _year_,--divide it into two seasons, the periods\r\nof northern and southern transit, the only natural and correct\r\ndivision--and note the phenomena in each, as each progresses.\r\n\r\nAnd I will take the year 1854, because that is the last year for which the\r\nrecord of observation is complete; because it had marked peculiarities\r\nwhich are remembered; and because I have alluded to those peculiarities,\r\nand those allusions should be confirmed or disproved by the record. Unless\r\nI mistake exceedingly, the confirmation will be found signal and\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\nI have assumed, pp. 187, 351, that the transits were greater in some\r\nseasons than others; that the drought of 1854 was owing to an extreme\r\nnorthern transit, or to an extension west of the concentrated\r\ncounter-trade, or both, leaving us less supplied with moisture than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, it appears from these observations that it resulted from\r\n_both_ causes, operating _connectedly_; and the annals of Science rarely\r\nfurnish a more striking instance of analogical inference proved true by\r\nsubsequent investigation.\r\n\r\nCommencing then with the commencement of the northern transit about the\r\n1st of February, we are enabled to trace the then location of our\r\nconcentrated trade, and its subsequent progress to the north till August,\r\nand its influence upon temperature and precipitation. And we can also\r\ntrace the situation during the same period, of the intervening drought,\r\nand the inter-tropical belt of rains, and the extension of the latter\r\nnorth over Florida and the cotton-planting States.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, 1854, our counter-trade was somewhat more\r\nconcentrated on its extreme winter curve, over the Southern States, than\r\nusual. Its line of excess reached up from Fort Brooke, on the peninsula of\r\nFlorida, to the northwest, a little east of Pensacola on the gulf, cutting\r\nMount Vernon Arsenal north of Pensacola, and extending thence\r\nnorth-westwardly on to Eastern Louisiana, and curving thence and passing\r\nN. E. or E. N. E., to the Atlantic, about the waters of the Chesapeake\r\nBay. It thinned out to the west over New Orleans and Baton Rouge,\r\nsupplying them moderately, but did not extend to the forts of Texas on the\r\nwest, nor the posts in the Indian Territory at the N. W. It was east of\r\nFort Towson, which is the south-eastern one. It did not reach St. Louis on\r\nthe north, nor extend north of the Ohio River, as will appear from the\r\ntables hereinafter given. The following cut shows substantially its\r\nsituation on the 1st of February.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, during the month of January, we find the following state of things.\r\n_Under_ this concentrated trade, the temperature was above the mean, even\r\nif Forts Monroe and McHenry on the Atlantic are included; but Mr. Blodget\r\ndiscredits their returns, and some others which do not conform to general\r\nresults. On the west and north of its curving line, both precipitation and\r\ntemperature were below the mean.\r\n\r\nUnder the counter trade, we have the following stations, with their actual\r\nand mean temperature. I have inserted the temperature for several\r\nsubsequent months, to show a depression in April.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  |  LAT. |  LON. |  JAN. |  FEB. |  MAR. | APRIL.| MAY.  |\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  Fort Moultrie   | 32.45 | 79.51 | 50.83 | 53.09 | 62.72 | 62.76 | 73.35 |\r\n   Mean of 28 yrs.|       |       | 50.36 | 52.41 | 58.68 | 65.44 | 73.42 |\r\n  Fort Pierce     | 27.30 | 80.20 | 67.91 | 67.33 | 73.01 | 71.10 | 78.41 |\r\n   Mean of 5 yrs. |       |       | 62.75 | 64.42 | 69.77 | 73.63 | 76.92 |\r\n  Fort Meade      | 28.01 | 82.00 | 63.75 | 63.33 | 70.64 | 68.10 | 76.31 |\r\n   Mean of 3 yrs. |       |       | 58.40 | 63.23 | 69.02 | 69.89 | 76.69 |\r\n  Fort Brooke     | 28.00 | 82.28 | 62.94 | 62.36 | 70.06 | 70.07 | 77.49 |\r\n   Mean of 25 yrs.|       |       | 61.53 | 63.54 | 67.72 | 71.82 | 76.64 |\r\n  Fort Myers      | 26.38 | 82.00 | 67.56 | 67.39 | 73.74 | 71.07 | 79.13 |\r\n   Mean of 4 yrs. |       |       | 63.39 | 67.98 | 72.19 | 73.86 | 80.13 |\r\n  Key West        | 24.32 | 81.48 | 71.75 | 71.95 | 76.56 | 73.89 | 80.84 |\r\n   Mean of 14 yrs.|       |       | 66.68 | 68.88 | 72.88 | 75.38 | 79.10 |\r\n  Fort Barrancas  | 30.18 | 87.27 | 54.71 | 54.56 | 64.98 | 62.93 | 75.40 |\r\n   Mean of 17 yrs.|       |       | 53.61 | 55.58 | 61.80 | 68.51 | 75.45 |\r\n  Mt.

In April, the inter-tropical belt\r\nappeared at that point, and went on increasing till September. As the\r\ncounter-trade commenced moving north in February, an increased\r\nprecipitation above the mean commenced at all the more southern stations\r\nunder the concentrated-trade--an earnest of that irregularity which\r\nfollowed, and marked the season as the most excessive of the century.\r\n\r\nIn March, the intervening drought appeared at the other posts on the\r\npeninsula, and also at Fort Moultrie, followed _much more closely than\r\nusual_, by the inter-tropical belt of rains. In April, the drought\r\nappeared at Fort Barrancas and Mount Vernon Arsenal (the wave of\r\nprecipitation having moved to the west), and slightly in comparison at\r\nBaton Rouge.\r\n\r\nIf now we look at the condition of things, _west_ and _north_ of the\r\ncurving line of concentrated trade, from Fort Brown, at the mouth of the\r\nRio Grande, in South-western Texas, through that State, the Indian\r\nTerritory, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Northern Pennsylvania, to the\r\nAtlantic, we find the thermometer every where in January below the mean.\r\nThe following table will show this, and the precipitation for that month\r\nand February:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                         |    JANUARY.   |   FEBRUARY.   |    MARCH.     |\r\n                         |-----------------------------------------------|\r\n                         | 1854. | Mean. | 1854. | Mean. | 1854. | Mean. |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  _Western Texas._       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Fort Brown             | 59.34 | 60.41 | 62.45 | 63.63 | 71.87 | 68.95 |\r\n   \"   Ewell             | 50.47 | 52.92 | 58.12 | 57.61 | 70.34 | 67.00 |\r\n   \"   Inge              | 47.24 | 49.46 | 56.04 | 55.39 | 67.54 | 62.63 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Indian Territory._    |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Fort Towson.           | 36.32 | 43.14 | 49.29 | 45.97 | 59.55 | 53.40 |\r\n  Forts Gibson, Washita, |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n    and Arbuckle, in much|       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n    the same proportions.|       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Arkansas._            |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Fort Smith.            | 33.92 | 40.18 | 47.01 | 43.89 | 57.01 | 51.58 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Missouri._            |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  St. Louis Arsenal.     | 25.47 | 31.44 | 36.66 | 33.43 | 46.10 | 42.30 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Kentucky._            |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Newport Barracks.      | 31.75 | 34.04 | 39.60 | 36.94 | 46.74 | 45.46 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Pennsylvania._        |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Allegheny Arsenal.     | 29.08 | 29.25 | 33.49 | 31.16 | 40.36 | 39.02 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _Delaware._            |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Fort Delaware          | 32.38 | 33.67 | 34.56 | 35.84 | 43.18 | 42.90 |\r\n                         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  _New York Harbor._     |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Fort Columbus.         | 28.71 | 30.18 | 28.17 | 30.44 | 36.17 | 38.28 |\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                         --------------------------------------\r\n                         | Rain in January. | Rain in February.\r\n                         --------------------------------------\r\n                         |       0.45       |       1.50\r\n                         |       0.22       |       2.86\r\n                         |       0.20       |       2.15\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       1.01       |       2.00\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       1.37       |       2.05\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       0.65       |       2.40\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       3.20       |       5.30\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       2.23       |       2.33\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       2.30       |       5.45\r\n                         |                  |\r\n                         |       2.60       |       4.00\r\n                         --------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe find, also, from this and table first, that every where, except at Fort\r\nBrown, and upon the Atlantic coast, the temperature had risen above the\r\nmean in February.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the belt which supplied the western coast in winter, and\r\nits excess of precipitation, are also represented upon the cut.

At all the stations\r\nwhere the greatest fall was in March, it should have been in April, and\r\nthe fall at those points was greatly in excess of the usual quantity. And\r\nthe same was true of stations reached in April. The concentrated trade,\r\ninstead of spreading out, and precipitating over the whole south-eastern\r\nportion of the continent (its normal condition), was gathered into a wave\r\nof greater volume, resulting in greater precipitation, and was rapidly\r\nhastening its curve to the west over Texas, and to the north-west over the\r\nIndian Territory, and northward on its usual curve to the north and east\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe observations for April disclose another singular and instructive\r\ncondition. The temperature, that had every where been above the mean in\r\nMarch, fell below it in April under the concentrated trade. And snow fell\r\non three days in some localities, and four in others.\r\n\r\nAlong the Ohio River, it fell to the depth of 8 to 10 inches on the 17th,\r\nand east of the mountains to a greater depth on the 18th, one day later.\r\nIt fell to the depth of 4 inches at Marietta on the 29th also. Dr.\r\nHilldreth, American Journal of Science for March, 1855, says:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a singular fact that the deepest snow, 8 inches, fell on the 17th\r\nof April, and at the head waters about Pittsburg over a foot. Also, on the\r\n29th of the month, at Marietta, 4 inches, a very rare occurrence.\" This\r\ndepression of the temperature was quite general, but the fall of snow was\r\nlocal. The latter was north of a line drawn from Fort Laramie, at the base\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, in an E. S. E. direction--north of Forts Kearney\r\nand Leavenworth, and of St. Louis, but south of Newport barracks in\r\nKentucky, and from thence to the Atlantic. Snow fell at every station\r\nnorth of this line, at no station south of it. The depression of\r\ntemperature, however, was experienced over the continent, east of the\r\nRocky Mountains, under, and south of, the belt of precipitation. Now what\r\noccasioned this general depression of temperature, and local fall of snow?\r\nIt will not do to say, as perhaps some calorific theorist may be inclined\r\nto say, because the concentrated trade had been carried up where it was\r\ncold, a month too soon; or that the sun had heated the land in advance of\r\nit, and drawn it up.\r\n\r\nFor, 1st, it might be asked how, if it was warm enough to draw it up,\r\ncould it be cold enough to make it snow; or, 2d, how happened it to start,\r\nwhen, as we have seen, it was warmer than the mean under it, and colder\r\nthan the mean to the north and west of it, when it commenced its journey?\r\n\r\nBut again, it snowed at posts north of the line, while the thermometer\r\nremained above the mean; and the thermometer fell below the mean down to\r\nFort Brown in south-western Texas, and at Key West in the southern part of\r\nFlorida; and what is more remarkable still, at Key West, Fort Barrancas,\r\nand every other south-eastern station, except Forts Brooke and Moultrie,\r\nit not only fell below the _mean_ of the month, but _below the actual\r\ntemperature of March_. (See Table I.) At Forts Brooke and Moultrie it did\r\nnot rise above that temperature. West of the Rocky Mountains the\r\ndepression was not felt; nor at stations north, or north-west of the belt\r\nof precipitation.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, the calorific theory can furnish no rational explanation of\r\nthis matter; for the reason that, whatever the cause, it operated not\r\nonly under, but south, and far south of the belt of precipitation. It\r\ncould not have been spots upon the sun, or other general cause, for then\r\nit would have operated in New Mexico and California, and at the\r\nnorth-western stations. It operated most intensely in Florida and the\r\nSouth-Eastern States, which approach most nearly the volcanic areas of\r\nSouth America and the West Indies. I believe it to have been occasioned by\r\nvolcanic action affecting the local magnetism of our intense area; but it\r\nis a most important development, and should be thoroughly investigated. We\r\nmay find in it the key to the mysterious, but unquestionable, influence of\r\nvolcanic upon magnetic action; and I hope the distinguished\r\nsurgeon-general will cause the records of that month to be published \"in\r\nextenso.\"\r\n\r\nIn May and June, the trade became more concentrated, a perfectly developed\r\nbelt from the Rio Grande to the Lakes and British possessions, and\r\ndoubtless to the Atlantic, with every where a central focus of excessive\r\nprecipitation, gathering to itself in one vast wave the current that\r\nshould have been spread out over the whole country; and leaving every\r\nwhere on its eastern and southern borders, down to the northern edge of\r\nthe inter-tropical belt of rains--(which extended up to lines drawn from\r\nBaton Rouge to Charleston)--a _perfectly well developed_ and _defined\r\ndrought_. That drought will long be remembered. The following cuts show,\r\napproximately, the location of the belt of precipitation and drought for\r\nthose months, and the table which follows will show their correctness.\r\n\r\nThe tables also show that this wave was occasionally a double, or divided\r\none--evinced by an intervening _partial_ precipitation. Tables IV., V.,\r\nand VI., also show the commencement of the drought at the several\r\nstations, as the wave moved to the west and north.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.\r\n\r\n                     JAN.

The reader will not only find in it an explanation of the\r\nextraordinary character of the summer of 1854, but will see from the\r\n_means_, that it was but an _excessive development_ of an ANNUAL\r\nPHENOMENON,--THE PROGRESS OF A CONCENTRATED COUNTER-TRADE.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow with particularity the return transit. It\r\nrequired no great degree of sagacity to predict, at the time, that the\r\ndrought would continue in the vicinity of New York till about the 10th of\r\nSeptember. The return of the belt to that latitude, was not to be expected\r\nbefore that time, and the drought continued, in fact, until the 9th of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nIts return progress was slow, and it was every where behind time. The\r\nautumn was warm, and so, indeed, were December and January, west of the\r\narea of magnetic intensity, although upon, and east of it, there was a\r\ndepression in December. The retreating but lingering edge of\r\ncounter-trade, with its excess of snow for the season, caught the Iron\r\nHorse, with its train and passengers, upon the prairies of the west, and\r\nlaid its embargoing hands upon them. Few, if any, can have forgotten the\r\nthrilling accounts which reached us from that section, of the sufferings\r\nendured by those who were thus embargoed for days and nights, far from the\r\ncomfortable habitations of their fellow men.\r\n\r\nBut the return transit, though slow, was extreme, and February and March\r\nwere exceedingly cold for the season. The transit to the north, again, did\r\nnot commence as early as usual, and the spring was backward, and the\r\nsummer cool. Both were without irregularity, and the season was\r\nproductive. The following table exhibits the temperature on a line of\r\nposts, running north and south at the west, during the winter months of\r\n1855, and will illustrate what has been said.\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n  1855.           |JANUARY |FEBRUARY.| MARCH.| APRIL.\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n  Key West        | 67.18  |  65.94  | 70.28 | 75.09\r\n          Mean    | 66.58  |  68.88  | 72.88 | 75.38\r\n  Fort Snelling   | 17.09  |  12.62  | 25.30 | 49.86\r\n          Mean    | 13.76  |  17.57  | 31.41 | 46.34\r\n  Fort Kearney    | 23.55  |  25.69  | 32.86 | 54.39\r\n          Mean    | 21.14  |  26.11  | 34.50 | 47.13\r\n  Fort Laramie    | 35.85  |  29.01  | 36.41 | 52.94\r\n          Mean    | 31.03  |  32.60  | 36.81 | 47.60\r\n  Fort Arbuckle   | 41.94  |  39.86  | 49.09 | 67.43\r\n          Mean    | 39.10  |  43.69  | 53.22 | 61.85\r\n  Fort Belknap    | 45.92  |  44.49  | 53.09 | 70.00\r\n          Mean    | 42.80  |  47.47  | 56.90 | 65.79\r\n  Fort Chadbourne | 48.89  |  45.87  | 56.68 | 68.51\r\n          Mean    | 44.29  |  46.75  | 58.01 | 65.52\r\n  Fort McKavitt   | 46.74  |  44.51  | 53.66 | 67.05\r\n          Mean    | 44.75  |  46.87  | 57.39 | 66.25\r\n  Fort Merrill    | 54.51  |  54.65  | 61.82 | 74.50\r\n          Mean    | 54.82  |  57.20  | 68.66 | 73.27\r\n  Fort Brown      | 60.23  |  61.60  | 66.24 | 74.98\r\n          Mean    | 60.41  |  63.63  | 68.95 | 75.05\r\n  Fort Inge       | 52.21  |  50.63  | 61.22 | 74.48\r\n          Mean    | 49.46  |  55.39  | 62.63 | 68.02\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe return transit to the south for this winter, 1855-6, has been an\r\nextreme one. It is too early yet (Feb. 18th) to write its history, but the\r\nextreme southern transit is as obvious as the unusual severity of the\r\ncold. The rains which usually fall upon the Southern States are\r\nprecipitated further south upon the West Indies, and threaten a\r\ndeterioration of their sugar crop. The snow, and cold winds, and ice, of\r\nthe middle latitudes, are felt even in Florida. Our sheet of\r\ncounter-trade has been exceedingly thin, and the barometer has ranged, in\r\nfair weather, much below the mean. Occasional, and for a part of the time,\r\n_weekly_ periods of an increase of its volume, with a corresponding\r\nelevation of the barometer, and a consequent moderation of the intense\r\ncold, and a storm, have occurred. But those periods have been few and\r\nbrief. No regular thaw has yet occurred. From the 26th of December to this\r\ndate, at Norwalk, there have been but two periods when the wind has blown\r\nfrom the south-west with sufficient force to stir the limbs of the trees.\r\nThere has been no wind from south of that point, or east of north-east;\r\nand even our storm-winds, with one exception, have been north of\r\nnorth-east--owing to the situation of the focus of precipitation far to\r\nthe south of us--and there is reason to fear that a cold summer like those\r\nof 1816 and 1836 may follow. If this extreme transit is owing to defect in\r\nthe influence of the sun, from spots, or other causes, such will probably\r\nbe the result. If from volcanic action at the south, the influence of that\r\naction may cease, and a rapid return transit, and an ordinary season, may\r\nfollow. Believing in the laws of periodicity in relation to the weather\r\nand disease, I planted an early kind of corn (the Dutton), in 1836, and\r\nhad a crop when few around me succeeded. We must watch this return\r\ntransit, with hope, indeed, but not without fear, and be wise in time.\r\n\r\nThere is a mass of other evidence in these summaries which shows the truth\r\nof what I have written. There is not a deduction of Mr. Blodget which it\r\nwill not explain. The ascent of the summer lines of temperature to the\r\nwest is explained by the diminution of magnetic intensity. Their descent\r\nin winter by the location and attractions of the concentrated trade. The\r\nexcess of precipitation in Alabama and Mississippi by the succession of\r\nsummer and winter belts. That of the interior of the Atlantic slope in\r\nsummer, by the showers which fall upon the elevations; and of the coast,\r\nby the easterly storms and their attraction of the surface atmosphere of\r\nthe ocean, at other seasons. But I cannot further particularize. Even the\r\ninfluence of the spots is clearly demonstrated by the observations at\r\n_interior stations_, which were unaffected by contiguous oceans or\r\nelevations. At Forts Washita, Gibson, Scott, Smith, and others, the years\r\n1847 and 1848 were below the mean.
