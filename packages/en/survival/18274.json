We have seen in\r\nthe last few years a marked revival of nature studies. This has led to\r\na wider range of interest in natural phenomena and in the growth and\r\nways of animals and plants. If this movement is not to be merely a\r\npassing fad, the element of truthfulness must be constantly insisted\r\nupon. If a clever imagination, or worse, sentimental symbolism, be\r\nsubstituted for the truth of nature, the value of such studies is\r\naltogether lost.\r\n\r\nThe essence of character-building lies in action. The chief value of\r\nnature study in character-building is that, like life itself, it\r\ndeals with realities. One must in life make his own observations,\r\nframe his own inductions, and apply them in action as he goes along.\r\nThe habit of finding out the best thing to do next and then doing it\r\nis the basis of character. Nature-study, if it be genuine, is\r\nessentially doing. To deal with truth is necessary, if we are to know\r\ntruth when we see it in action. The rocks and shells, the frogs and\r\nlilies, always tell the absolute truth. Every leaf on the tree is an\r\noriginal document in botany. When a thousand are used or used up, the\r\narchives of Nature are just as full as ever. By the study of realities\r\nwisdom is built up. In the relations of objects he can touch and move,\r\nthe child finds the limitations of his powers, the laws that govern\r\nphenomena, which his own actions must obey. So long as he deals with\r\nrealities, these laws stand in their proper relation. \"So simple, so\r\nnatural, so true,\" says Agassiz. \"This is the charm of dealing with\r\nnature herself. She brings us back to absolute truth so often as we\r\nwander.\"\r\n\r\nSo long as a child is led from one reality to another, never lost in\r\nwords or abstractions,--so long this natural relation remains. \"What\r\ncan I do with it?\" is the beginning of wisdom. \"What is it to me?\" is\r\nthe beginning of personal virtue.\r\n\r\nBy adding near things to near, the child grows in Knowledge.\r\nKnowledge, tested and set in order, is Science. Nature-study is the\r\nbeginning of science. It is the science of the child. The \"world as\r\nit is\" is the province of science. In proportion as our actions\r\nconform to the conditions of the world as it is, do we find the world\r\nbeautiful, glorious, divine. The truth of the world as it is must be\r\nthe final inspiration of art, poetry, and religion. The world, as men\r\nhave agreed to say that it is, is quite another matter. The less our\r\nchildren hear of this, the less they may have to unlearn. Nature\r\nstudies have long been valued as \"a means of grace,\" because they\r\narouse the enthusiasm, the love of work, which belongs to open-eyed\r\nyouth. The child blase with moral precepts and irregular conjugations\r\nturns with fresh delight to the unrolling of ferns or the song of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nNature must be questioned in earnest, or she will not reply. But to\r\nevery serious question she will return a serious answer. \"Simple,\r\nnatural, and true,\" she tends to create simplicity and truth. Truth\r\nand virtue are but opposite sides of the same shield. As leaves pass\r\nover into flowers, and flowers into fruit, so are wisdom, virtue, and\r\nhappiness inseparably related.\r\n\r\nThis little volume is a contribution to the subject matter of Nature\r\nStudy. It is the work of students of nature, and their work is\r\n\"simple, natural, and true,\" in so far as it is represented here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Signature) David Starr Jordan]\r\n\r\nLELAND STANFORD JR.

H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvery one has seen a cornfield. If you pluck up one of the innumerable\r\nwheat plants which are fixed in the soil of the field, about harvest\r\ntime, you will find that it consists of a stem which ends in a root at\r\none end and an ear at the other, and that blades or leaves are\r\nattached to the sides of the stem. The ear contains a multitude of\r\noval grains which are the seeds of the wheat plant. You know that when\r\nthese seeds are cleared from the husk or bran in which they are\r\nenveloped, they are ground into fine powder in mills, and that this\r\npowder is the flour of which bread is made. If a handful of flour\r\nmixed with a little cold water is tied up in a coarse cloth bag, and\r\nthe bag is then put into a large vessel of water and well kneaded with\r\nthe hands, it will become pasty, while the water will become white. If\r\nthis water is poured away into another vessel, and the kneading\r\nprocess continued with some fresh water, the same thing will happen.\r\nBut if the operation is repeated the paste will become more and more\r\nsticky, while the water will be rendered less and less white, and at\r\nlast will remain colorless. The sticky substance which is thus\r\nobtained by itself is called gluten; in commerce it is the substance\r\nknown as maccaroni.\r\n\r\nIf the water in which the flour has thus been washed is allowed to\r\nstand for a few hours, a white sediment will be found at the bottom of\r\nthe vessel, while the fluid above will be clear and may be poured off.\r\nThis white sediment consists of minute grains of starch, each of\r\nwhich, examined with the microscope, will be found to have a\r\nconcentrically laminated structure. If the fluid from which the starch\r\nwas deposited is now boiled it will become turbid, just as white of\r\negg diluted with water does when it is boiled, and eventually a\r\nwhitish lumpy substance will collect at the bottom of the vessel. This\r\nsubstance is called vegetable albumin.\r\n\r\nBesides the albumin, the gluten, and the starch, other substances\r\nabout which this rough method of analysis gives us no information, are\r\ncontained in the wheat grain. For example, there is woody matter or\r\ncellulose, and a certain quantity of sugar and fat. It would be\r\npossible to obtain a substance similar to albumin, starch, saccharine,\r\nand fatty matters, and cellulose, by treating the stem, leaves, and\r\nroot in a similar fashion, but the cellulose would be in far larger\r\nproportion. Straw, in fact, which consists of the dry stem and leaves\r\nof the wheat plant, is almost wholly made up of cellulose. Besides\r\nthis, however, it contains a certain proportion of mineral bodies,\r\namong them, pure flint or silica; and, if you should ever see a wheat\r\nrick burnt, you will find more or less of this silica, in a glassy\r\ncondition, in the embers. In the living plant, all these bodies are\r\ncombined with a large proportion of water, or are dissolved, or\r\nsuspended in that fluid. The relative quantity of water is much\r\ngreater in the stem and leaves than in the seed.\r\n\r\nEverybody has seen a common fowl. It is an active creature which runs\r\nabout and sometimes flies. It has a body covered with feathers,\r\nprovided with two wings and two legs, and ending at one end in a neck\r\nterminated by a head with a beak, between the two parts of which the\r\nmouth is placed. The hen lays eggs, each of which is inclosed in a\r\nhard shell. If you break an egg the contents flow out and are seen to\r\nconsist of the colorless glairy \"white\" and the yellow \"yolk.\" If the\r\nwhite is collected by itself in water and then heated it becomes\r\nturbid, forming a white solid, very similar to the vegetable albumin,\r\nwhich is called animal albumin.\r\n\r\nIf the yolk is beaten up with water, no starch nor cellulose is\r\nobtained from it, but there will be plenty of fatty and some\r\nsaccharine matter, besides substances more or less similar to albumin\r\nand gluten.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of the fowl are chiefly composed of horn; if they are\r\nstripped off and the body is boiled for a long time, the water will be\r\nfound to contain a quantity of gelatin, which sets into a jelly as it\r\ncools; and the body will fall to pieces, the bones and the flesh\r\nseparating from one another. The bones consist almost entirely of a\r\nsubstance which yields gelatin when it is boiled in water, impregnated\r\nwith a large quantity of salts of lime, just as the wood of the wheat\r\nstem is impregnated with silica. The flesh, on the other hand, will\r\ncontain albumin, and some other substances which are very similar to\r\nalbumin, termed fibrin and syntonin.\r\n\r\nIn the living bird, all these bodies are united with a great quantity\r\nof water, or dissolved, or suspended in water; and it must be\r\nremembered that there are sundry other constituents of the fowl's body\r\nand of the egg, which are left unmentioned, as of no present\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe wheat plant contains neither horn, nor gelatin, and the fowl\r\ncontains neither starch, nor cellulose; but the albumin of the plant\r\nis very similar to that of the animal, and the fibrin and syntonin of\r\nthe animal are bodies closely allied to both albumin and gluten.\r\n\r\nThat there is a close likeness between all these bodies is obvious\r\nfrom the fact that when any of them is strongly heated, or allowed to\r\nputrefy, it gives off the same sort of disagreeable smell; and careful\r\nchemical analysis has shown that they are, in fact, all composed of\r\nthe elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, combined in very\r\nnearly the same proportions. Indeed, charcoal, which is impure carbon,\r\nmight be obtained by strongly heating either a handful of corn, or a\r\npiece of fowl's flesh, in a vessel from which the air is excluded so\r\nas to keep the corn or the flesh from burning. And if the vessel were\r\na still, so that the products of this destructive distillation, as it\r\nis called, could be condensed and collected, we should find water and\r\nammonia, in some shape or other, in the receiver. Now ammonia is a\r\ncompound of the elementary bodies, nitrogen and hydrogen; therefore\r\nboth nitrogen and hydrogen must have been contained in the bodies from\r\nwhich it is derived.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, then, that very similar nitrogenous compounds form a\r\nvery large part of the bodies of both the wheat plant and the fowl,\r\nand these bodies are called proteids.\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable fact that not only are such substances as\r\nalbumin, gluten, fibrin, and syntonin, known exclusively as products\r\nof animal and vegetable bodies, but that every animal and every plant,\r\nat all periods of its existence, contains one or other of them,\r\nthough, in other respects, the composition of living bodies may vary\r\nindefinitely. Thus, some plants contain neither starch nor cellulose,\r\nwhile these substances are found in some animals; while many animals\r\ncontain no horny matter and no gelatin-yielding substance. So that the\r\nmatter which appears to be the essential foundation of both the animal\r\nand the plant is the proteid united with water; though it is probable\r\nthat, in all animals and plants, these are associated with more or\r\nless fatty and amyloid (or starchy and saccharine) substances, and\r\nwith very small quantities of certain mineral bodies, of which the\r\nmost important appear to be phosphorus, iron, lime, and potash.\r\n\r\nThus there is a substance composed of water + proteids + fat +\r\namyloids + mineral matters which is found in all animals and plants;\r\nand, when these are alive, this substance is termed protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe wheat plant in the field is said to be a living thing; the fowl\r\nrunning about the farmyard is also said to be a living thing. If the\r\nplant is plucked up, and if the fowl is knocked on the head, they soon\r\ndie and become dead things. Both the fowl and the wheat plant, as we\r\nhave seen, are composed of the same elements as those which enter into\r\nthe composition of mineral matter, though united into compounds which\r\ndo not exist in the mineral world. Why, then, do we distinguish this\r\nmatter when it takes the shape of a wheat plant or a fowl, as living\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nIn the spring a wheat-field is covered with small green plants. These\r\ngrow taller and taller until they attain many times the size which\r\nthey had when they first appeared; and they produce the heads of\r\nflowers which eventually change into ears of corn.\r\n\r\nIn so far as this is a process of growth, accompanied by the\r\nassumption of a definite form, it might be compared with the growth of\r\na crystal of salt in brine: but, on closer examination, it turns out\r\nto be something very different. For the crystal of salt grows by\r\ntaking to itself the salt contained in the brine, which is added to\r\nits exterior; whereas the plant grows by addition to its interior: and\r\nthere is not a trace of the characteristic compounds of the plant's\r\nbody, albumin, gluten, starch, or cellulose, or fat, in the soil, or\r\nin the water, or in the air.\r\n\r\nYet the plant creates nothing; and, therefore, the matter of the\r\nproteins and amyloids and fats which it contains must be supplied to\r\nit, and simply manufactured, or combined in new fashions, in the body\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, in a general way, what the raw materials are which\r\nthe plant works up, for the plant get nothing but the materials\r\nsupplied to it by the atmosphere and by the soil. The atmosphere\r\ncontains oxygen and nitrogen, a little carbonic acid gas, a minute\r\nquantity of ammoniacal salts, and a variable proportion of water. The\r\nsoil contains clay and sand (silica), lime, iron, potash, phosphorus,\r\nsulphur, ammoniacal salts, and other matters which are of no\r\nimportance. Thus, between them, the soil and the atmosphere contain\r\nall the elementary bodies which we find in the plant; but the plant\r\nhas to separate them and join them together afresh.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the new matter, by the addition of which the plant grows, is\r\nnot applied to its outer surface, but is manufactured in its interior;\r\nand the new molecules are diffused among the old ones.\r\n\r\nThe grain of wheat is a part of the flower of the wheat plant, which,\r\nwhen it becomes ripe, is easily separated. It contains a minute and\r\nrudimentary plant; and, when it is sown, this gradually grows, or\r\nbecomes developed into, the perfect plant, with its stem, roots,\r\nleaves, and flowers, which again give rise to similar seeds. No\r\nmineral body runs through a regular series of changes of form and\r\nsize, and then gives off parts of its substance which take the same\r\ncourse. Mineral bodies present no such development, and give off no\r\nseeds or germs. They do not reproduce their kind.\r\n\r\nThe fowl in the farmyard is incessantly pecking about and swallowing\r\nnow a grain of corn, and now a fly or a worm. In fact, it is feeding,\r\nand, as every one knows, would soon die if not supplied with food. It\r\nis also a matter of every-day knowledge that it would not be of much\r\nuse to give a fowl the soil of a cornfield, with plenty of air and\r\nwater, to eat.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the fowl is like all other animals; it cannot\r\nmanufacture the proteid materials of its body, but it has to take them\r\nready made, or in a condition which requires but very slight\r\nmodification by devouring the bodies either of other animals or of\r\nplants. The animal or vegetable substances devoured are taken into the\r\nanimal's stomach; they are there digested or dissolved; and thus they\r\nare fitted to be distributed to all parts of the fowl's own body, and\r\napplied to its maintenance and growth.\r\n\r\nThe fowl's egg is formed in the body of the hen, and is, in fact, part\r\nof her body inclosed in a shell and detached. It contains a minute\r\nrudiment of a fowl; and when it is kept at a proper temperature by the\r\nhen's sitting upon it, or otherwise for three weeks, this rudiment\r\ngrows, or develops, at the expense of the materials contained in the\r\nyolk and the white, into a small bird, the chick, which is then\r\nhatched and grows into a fowl. The animal, therefore, is produced by\r\nthe development of a germ in the same way as the plant; and, in this\r\nrespect, all plants and all animals agree with one another, and differ\r\nfrom all mineral matter.\r\n\r\nThus there is a very broad distinction between mineral matter and\r\nliving matter. The elements of living matter are identical with those\r\nof mineral bodies; and the fundamental laws of matter and motion apply\r\nas much to living matter as to mineral matter; but every living body\r\nis, as it were, a complicated piece of mechanism which \"goes,\" or\r\nlives, only under certain conditions. The germ contained in the\r\nfowl's egg requires nothing but a supply of warmth, within certain\r\nnarrow limits of temperature, to build the molecules of the egg into\r\nthe body of the chick. And the process of development of the egg, like\r\nthat of the seed, is neither more nor less mysterious than that, in\r\nvirtue of which, the molecules of water, when it is cooled down to the\r\nfreezing-point, build themselves up into regular crystals.\r\n\r\nThe further study of living bodies leads to the province of biology,\r\nof which there are two great divisions--botany, which deals with\r\nplants, and zooelogy, which treats of animals.\r\n\r\nEach of these divisions has its subdivisions--such as morphology,\r\nwhich treats of the form, structure, and development of living beings,\r\nand physiology, which explains their actions or functions, besides\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE GROWTH;--FROGS\r\n\r\n(FROM A SONG OF LIFE.)\r\n\r\nBY MARGARET WARNER MORLEY.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Copyright by A. C. McClurg & Co., 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSomewhat higher than the fish in the scale of life is the frog.\r\nAlthough he begins life as a fish, and in the tadpole state breathes\r\nby gills, he soon discards the water-diluted air of the pond, and with\r\nperfect lungs boldly inhales the pure air of the upper world. His life\r\nas a tadpole, although so fish-like, is much inferior to true fish\r\nlife: for though the fish has not the perfect lung, he has a\r\nmodification of it which he fills with air, not for breathing\r\npurposes, but as an air-sac to make him float like a bubble in the\r\nwater. Will he rise to the surface? he inflates the air-bladder. Will\r\nhe sink to the bottom? he compresses the air-bladder. But in the frog\r\nthe air-bladder changes into the lungs, and is never the delicate\r\nballoon which floats the fish in aqueous space. When the frog's lungs\r\nare perfected, his gills close, and he forever abandons fish-life,\r\nthough being a cold-blooded creature he needs comparatively little\r\nair, and delights to return to his childhood's home in the bottom of\r\nthe pond. But although he can stay under water for a long time, he is\r\nobliged to hold his breath while there, and when he would breathe must\r\ncome to the surface to do so. It is possible to drown him by holding\r\nhim under water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FROG.]\r\n\r\nAs a feeder the frog relies upon animal life, which he expertly seizes\r\nwith a tongue fastened by the wrong end, as compared with our tongues.\r\nHe is a certain marksman, and when he aims at an insect the chances\r\nare that the insect will enter his stomach and be there speedily\r\nchanged into a new form of animal life.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the moment the gills disappear the frog is a true land\r\nanimal, he is obliged, on account of the fish-like character of his\r\nyoung, to lay his eggs in the water. For this purpose the frogs enter\r\nthe pools in early spring. The surface of every country pond swarms\r\nwith the bright-eyed little creatures. They have awakened from a\r\nlong, cold, winter sleep, to find the spring about them and within\r\nthem. Life has suddenly become abundant and joyous. Their sluggish\r\nblood flows faster, their hearts beat quicker; they leap, they swim,\r\nthey swell out their throats and call to each other in various keys.\r\nThe toads are with them, and the pretty tree-frogs that change their\r\ncolor to suit their emotions. And all are rapturously screaming. Their\r\nvoices are not musical, according to man's standard, but seem to\r\nafford great satisfaction to the performers in the shrill orchestra of\r\nthe swamps, who thus give vent to the flood of life that sweeps\r\nthrough them after the still, icy winter.\r\n\r\nAs though the new spring-life were too plentiful to find room in the\r\nfrogs and toads already existing, it calls for more frogs and toads;\r\nand new creatures are born to share the extra vitality. Like the\r\nflowers and the fish, the frogs, too, give forth new life. Within\r\nthem, too, the miracle is performed. The tiny eggs of the one wake up\r\nand begin to grow. The tiny living bodies in the fertilizing principle\r\nof the other also wake up and begin to grow. But higher life is better\r\nguarded, because less prolific. The frog and the toad lay but few eggs\r\nas compared with the fish. Fish eggs may drop under the stones or\r\nfloat away, and so escape the vital touch of the fertilizing\r\nprinciple. There are so many that numbers may be lost and yet enough\r\nremain to continue the family. Not so with the frog family. No egg may\r\nbe lost. So we find that the eggs of the frog are not dropped singly,\r\nlike so many shot, but are bound together by a colorless, transparent,\r\njelly-like substance, much like that found in the morning-glory seed,\r\nand which like that supplies nourishment to the young life, for the\r\ntadpole feeds upon it until he is able to seek other food. Moreover,\r\ninstinct has taught the frog the need of extreme caution in the act of\r\nfertilization. Every egg _must_ be fertilized. As the time draws near\r\nfor the dropping of the few eggs into the water, the male frog so\r\nplaces himself that the moment the eggs are being laid, he pours over\r\nthem, one by one, as they fall into the water, the fertilizing fluid.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the mystery of life is again repeated. The union of the\r\nliving, microscopic bodies of the fertilizing principle with the new\r\nlaid egg is followed by the growth of the two elements into a living\r\ncreature, able to eat, to breathe, to see, to feel. In some unknown\r\nway the atom of fertilizing principle seems to have contained the\r\nwhole life of the father-frog, for it can give to his sons and\r\ndaughters any of his peculiarities, either of color, form, motion, or\r\ndisposition; and the tiny egg seems to have contained the whole life\r\nof the mother-frog, and can give to her sons and daughters any of her\r\npeculiarities; though, as is true of all inheritance, the tadpoles, as\r\nthe young frogs are called, share the natures of both parents,\r\ninheriting some peculiarities from the father and others from the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FROG.]\r\n\r\nBut, like other life, although the frogs may vary a good deal within\r\nfrog limits, none of them can escape their own limits and enter into\r\nthose of any other life. Once a frog, always a frog; and no frog-egg\r\nmay hope to develop into a turtle, or a bird, or anything but a frog.\r\nThe life in the fertilizing principle of the frog is sacred to frog\r\neggs, and is lifeless in contact with any other.\r\n\r\nOur common frogs, like many of the fishes, do not trouble themselves\r\nabout the fate of their eggs after they are carefully laid in a safe\r\nplace. They trust Mother Nature to see the little tadpoles safely\r\nthrough the perils of childhood, to help them change their dresses and\r\nget rid of their tails, and cut, not their teeth, but their arms and\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nIn Venezuela, however, there dwells a frog with well developed\r\nmaternal instinct. The mothers have pockets on their backs, not for\r\ntheir own convenience, but as cradles for their babies. The fathers\r\nput the fertilized eggs into the pockets of the mothers; and there\r\nthey remain, well guarded, until the young are able to care for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TADPOLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN-LIKE APES\r\n\r\n(FROM EVIDENCE AS TO MAN'S PLACE IN NATURE.)\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR T. H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF GORILLA.]\r\n\r\nSound knowledge respecting the habits and mode of life of the man-like\r\nApes has been even more difficult of attainment than correct\r\ninformation regarding their structure.\r\n\r\nOnce in a generation, a Wallace may be found physically, mentally, and\r\nmorally qualified to wander unscathed through the tropical wilds of\r\nAmerica and of Asia, to form magnificent collections as he wanders,\r\nand withal to think out sagaciously the conclusions suggested by his\r\ncollections; but, to the ordinary explorer or collector, the dense\r\nforests of equatorial Asia and Africa, which constitute the favorite\r\nhabitation of the Orang, the Chimpanzee, and the Gorilla, present\r\ndifficulties of no ordinary magnitude; and the man who risks his life\r\nby even a short visit to the malarious shores of those regions may\r\nwell be excused if he shrinks from facing the dangers of the interior;\r\nif he contents himself with stimulating the industry of the\r\nbetter-seasoned natives, and collecting and collating the more or less\r\nmythical reports and traditions with which they are too ready to\r\nsupply him.\r\n\r\nIn such a manner most of the earlier accounts of the habits of the\r\nman-like Apes originated; and even now a good deal of what passes\r\ncurrent must be admitted to have no very safe foundation. The best\r\ninformation we possess is that based almost wholly on direct European\r\ntestimony respecting the Gibbons; the next best evidence relates to\r\nthe Orangs; while our knowledge of the habits of the Chimpanzee and\r\nthe Gorilla stands much in need of support and enlargement by\r\nadditional testimony from instructed European eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be convenient in endeavoring to form a notion of\r\nwhat we are justified in believing about these animals, to commence\r\nwith the best known man-like Apes, the Gibbons, and Orangs; and to\r\nmake use of the perfectly reliable information respecting them as a\r\nsort of criterion of the probable truth or falsehood of assertions\r\nrespecting the others.\r\n\r\nOf the Gibbons, half a dozen species are found scattered over the\r\nAsiatic Islands, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and through Malacca, Siam,\r\nArracan, and an uncertain extent of Hindostan on the mainland of Asia.\r\nThe largest attain a few inches above three feet in height, from the\r\ncrown to the heel, so that they are shorter than the other man-like\r\nApes, while the slenderness of their bodies renders their mass far\r\nsmaller in proportion even to this diminished height.\r\n\r\nDr. Salomon Mueller, an accomplished Dutch naturalist, who lived for\r\nmany years in the Eastern Archipelago, and to the result of whose\r\npersonal experience I shall frequently have occasion to refer, states\r\nthat the Gibbons are true mountaineers, loving the slopes and edges of\r\nthe hills, though they rarely ascend beyond the limit of the\r\nfig-trees. All day long they haunt the tops of the tall trees, and\r\nthough toward evening, they descend in small troops to the open\r\nground, no sooner do they spy a man than they dart up the hillsides\r\nand disappear in the darker valleys.\r\n\r\nAll observers testify to the prodigious volume of voice possessed by\r\nthese animals. According to the writer whom I have just cited, in one\r\nof them, the Siamang, \"the voice is grave and penetrating, resembling\r\nthe sounds goek, goek, goek, goek, goek ha ha ha ha haaaaa, and may be\r\neasily heard at a distance of half a league.\" While the cry is being\r\nuttered, the great membranous bag under the throat which communicates\r\nwith the organ of voice, the so-called \"laryngeal sac,\" becomes\r\ngreatly distended, diminishing again when the creature relapses into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nM. Duvaucel, likewise, affirms that the cry of the Siamang may be\r\nheard for miles--making the woods ring again. So Mr. Martin describes\r\nthe cry of the agile Gibbon as \"overpowering and deafening\" in a room,\r\nand \"from its strength, well calculated for resounding through the\r\nvast forests.\" Mr. Waterhouse, an accomplished musician as well as\r\nzooelogist, says, \"The Gibbon's voice is certainly much more powerful\r\nthan that of any singer I ever heard.\" And yet it is to be recollected\r\nthat this animal is not half the height of, and far less bulky in\r\nproportion than, a man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GIBBON.]\r\n\r\nThere is good testimony that various species of Gibbon readily take to\r\nthe erect posture. Mr. George Bennett, a very excellent observer, in\r\ndescribing the habits of a male _Hylobates syndactylus_ which remained\r\nfor some time in his possession, says: \"He invariably walks in the\r\nerect posture when on a level surface; and then the arms either hang\r\ndown, enabling him to assist himself with his knuckles; or, what is\r\nmore usual, he keeps his arms uplifted in nearly an erect position,\r\nwith the hands pendent ready to seize a rope, and climb up on the\r\napproach of danger or on the obtrusion of strangers. He walks rather\r\nquick in the erect posture, but with a waddling gait, and is soon run\r\ndown if, while pursued, he has no opportunity of escaping by\r\nclimbing.... When he walks in the erect posture, he turns the leg and\r\nfoot outward, which occasions him to have a waddling gait and to seem\r\nbow-legged.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Burrough states of another Gibbon, the Horlack or Hooluk:\r\n\r\n\"They walk erect; and when placed on the floor, or in an open field,\r\nbalance themselves very prettily by raising their hands over their\r\nhead and slightly bending the arm at the wrist and elbow, and then run\r\ntolerably fast, rocking from side to side; and, if urged to greater\r\nspeed, they let fall their hands to the ground, and assist themselves\r\nforward, rather jumping than running, still keeping the body, however,\r\nnearly erect.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat different evidence, however, is given by Dr. Winslow Lewis:\r\n\r\n\"Their only manner of walking was on their posterior or inferior\r\nextremities, the others being raised upward to preserve their\r\nequilibrium, as rope-dancers are assisted by long poles at fairs.\r\nTheir progression was not by placing one foot before the other, but by\r\nsimultaneously using both, as in jumping.\" Dr. Salomon Mueller also\r\nstates that the Gibbons progress upon the ground by short series of\r\ntottering jumps, effected only by the hind limbs, the body being held\r\naltogether upright.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Martin, who also speaks from direct observation, says of the\r\nGibbons generally:\r\n\r\n\"Pre-eminently qualified for arboreal habits, and displaying among the\r\nbranches amazing activity, the Gibbons are not so awkward or\r\nembarrassed on a level surface as might be imagined. They walk erect\r\nwith a waddling or unsteady gait, but at a quick pace, the equilibrium\r\nof the body requiring to be kept up, either by touching the ground\r\nwith the knuckles, first on one side then on the other, or by\r\nuplifting the arms so as to poise it. As with the Chimpanzee, the\r\nwhole of the narrow, long sole of the foot is placed upon the ground\r\nat once, and raised at once, without any elasticity of step.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this mass of concurrent and independent testimony, it cannot\r\nreasonably be doubted that the Gibbons commonly and habitually assume\r\nthe erect attitude.\r\n\r\nBut level ground is not the place where these animals can display\r\ntheir very remarkable and peculiar locomotive powers, and that\r\nprodigious activity which almost tempts one to rank them among flying,\r\nrather than among ordinary climbing mammals.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin has given so excellent and graphic an account of the\r\nmovements of a _Hylobates agilis_, living in the Zooelogical Gardens,\r\nin 1840, that I will quote it in full:\r\n\r\n\"It is almost impossible to convey in words an idea of the quickness\r\nand graceful address of her movements: they may indeed be termed\r\naerial, as she seems merely to touch in her progress the branches\r\namong which she exhibits her evolutions. In these feats her hands and\r\narms are the sole organs of locomotion, her body, hanging as if\r\nsuspended by a rope, sustained by one hand (the right, for example),\r\nshe launches herself, by an energetic movement, to a distant branch,\r\nwhich she catches with the left hand; but her hold is less than\r\nmomentary; the impulse for the next launch is acquired; the branch\r\nthen aimed at is attained by the right hand again, and quitted\r\ninstantaneously, and so on, in alternate succession. In this manner\r\nspaces of twelve and eighteen feet are cleared, with the greatest ease\r\nand uninterruptedly, for hours together, without the slightest\r\nappearance of fatigue being manifested; and it is evident that, if\r\nmore space could be allowed, distances very greatly exceeding eighteen\r\nfeet would be as easily cleared; so that Duvaucel's assertion that he\r\nhas seen these animals launch themselves from one branch to another,\r\nforty feet asunder, startling as it is, may be well credited.\r\nSometimes, on seizing a branch in her progress, she will throw\r\nherself, by the power of one arm only, completely round it, making a\r\nrevolution with such rapidity as almost to deceive the eye, and\r\ncontinue her progress with undiminished velocity. It is singular to\r\nobserve how suddenly this Gibbon can stop, when the impetus giving by\r\nthe rapidity and distance of her swinging leaps would seem to require\r\na gradual abatement of her movements. In the very midst of her flight\r\na branch is seized, the body raised, and she is seen, as if by magic,\r\nquietly seated on it, grasping it with her feet. As suddenly she again\r\nthrows herself into action.\r\n\r\n\"The following facts will convey some notion of her dexterity and\r\nquickness. A live bird was let loose in her apartment; she marked its\r\nflight, made a long swing to a distant branch, caught the bird with\r\none hand in her passage, and attained the branch with her other hand,\r\nher aim, both at the bird and at the branch, being as successful as if\r\none object only had engaged her attention. It may be added that she\r\ninstantly bit off the head of the bird, picked its feathers, and then\r\nthrew it down without attempting to eat it.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion this animal swung herself from a perch, across a\r\npassage at least twelve feet wide, against a window which it was\r\nthought would be immediately broken: but not so; to the surprise of\r\nall, she caught the narrow framework between the panes with her hand,\r\nin an instant attained the proper impetus, and sprang back again to\r\nthe cage she had left--a feat requiring not only great strength, but\r\nthe nicest precision.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gibbons appear to be naturally very gentle, but there is very good\r\nevidence that they will bite severely when irritated, a female\r\n_Hylobates agilis_ having so severely lacerated one man with her long\r\ncanines that he died; while she had injured others so much that, by\r\nway of precaution, these formidable teeth had been filed down; but if\r\nthreatened she would still turn on her keeper. The Gibbons eat\r\ninsects, but appear generally to avoid animal food. A Siamang,\r\nhowever, was seen by Mr. Bennett to seize and devour greedily a live\r\nlizard. They commonly drink by dipping their fingers in the liquid and\r\nthen licking them. It is asserted that they sleep in a sitting\r\nposture.\r\n\r\nDuvaucel affirms that he has seen the females carry their young to the\r\nwater-side and there wash their faces, in spite of resistance and\r\ncries. They are gentle and affectionate in captivity--full of tricks\r\nand pettishness, like spoiled children, and yet not devoid of a\r\ncertain conscience, as an anecdote, told by Mr. Bennett will show. It\r\nwould appear that his Gibbon had a peculiar inclination for\r\ndisarranging things in the cabin. Among these articles a piece of soap\r\nwould especially attract his notice, and for the removal of this he\r\nhad been once or twice scolded. \"One morning,\" says Mr. Bennett, \"I\r\nwas writing, the Ape being present in the cabin, when, casting my eyes\r\ntoward him, I saw the little fellow taking the soap. I watched him\r\nwithout him perceiving that I did so: and he occasionally would cast a\r\nfurtive glance toward the place where I sat. I pretended to write; he\r\nseeing me busily occupied, took the soap, and moved away with it in\r\nhis paw. When he had walked half the length of the cabin, I spoke\r\nquietly, without frightening him. The instant he found I saw him he\r\nwalked back again and deposited the soap nearly in the same place from\r\nwhence he had taken it. There was certainly something more than\r\ninstinct in that action: he evidently betrayed a consciousness of\r\nhaving done wrong both by his first and last actions--and what is\r\nreason if that is not an exercise of it?\"\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate account of the natural history of the Orang-Utan\r\nextant is that given in the \"_Verhandelingen over de Natuurlijke\r\nGeschiedenis der Nederlandsche overzeeche Bezittingen (1839-45)_,\" by\r\nDr. Salomon Mueller and Dr. Schlegel, and I shall base what I have to\r\nsay upon this subject almost entirely on their statements, adding here\r\nand there particulars of interest from the writings of Brooke,\r\nWallace, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Utan would rarely seem to exceed four feet in height, but\r\nthe body is very bulky, measuring two thirds of the height in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Utan is found only in Sumatra and Borneo, and is common in\r\neither of these islands--in both of which it occurs always in low,\r\nflat plains, never in the mountains. It loves the densest and most\r\nsombre of the forests, which extend from the seashore inland, and thus\r\nis found only in the eastern half of Sumatra, where alone such forests\r\noccur, though, occasionally, it strays over to the western side.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is generally distributed through Borneo, except\r\nin the mountains, or where the population is dense. In favorable\r\nplaces the hunter may, by good fortune, see three or four in a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF ORANG-UTAN.]\r\n\r\nExcept in the pairing time, the old males usually live by themselves.\r\nThe old females and the immature males, on the other hand, are often\r\nmet with in twos and threes; and the former occasionally have young\r\nwith them, though the pregnant females usually separate themselves,\r\nand sometimes remain apart after they have given birth to their\r\noffspring. The young Orangs seem to remain unusually long under their\r\nmother's protection, probably in consequence of their slow growth.\r\nWhile climbing the mother always carries her young against her bosom,\r\nthe young holding on by the mother's hair. At what time of life the\r\nOrang-Utan becomes capable of propagation, and how long the females go\r\nwith young is unknown, but it is probable that they are not adult\r\nuntil they arrive at ten or fifteen years of age. A female which lived\r\nfor five years at Batavia had not attained one-third the height of the\r\nwild females. It is probable that, after reaching adult years, they go\r\non growing, though slowly, and that they live to forty or fifty years.\r\nThe Dyaks tell of old Orangs which have not only lost all their\r\nteeth, but which find it so troublesome to climb that they maintain\r\nthemselves on windfalls and juicy herbage.\r\n\r\nThe Orang is sluggish, exhibiting none of that marvellous activity\r\ncharacteristic of the Gibbons. Hunger alone seems to stir him to\r\nexertion, and when it is stilled he relapses into repose. When the\r\nanimal sits, it curves its back and bows its head, so as to look\r\nstraight down on the ground; sometimes it holds on with its hands by a\r\nhigher branch, sometimes lets them hang phlegmatically down by its\r\nside; and in these positions the Orang will remain for hours together,\r\nin the same spot, almost without stirring, and only now and then\r\ngiving utterance to its deep, growling voice. By day he usually climbs\r\nfrom one tree-top to another, and only at night descends to the\r\nground: and if then threatened with danger he seeks refuge among the\r\nunderwood. When not hunted, he remains a long time in the same\r\nlocality, and sometimes stops for many days on the same tree, a firm\r\nplace among its branches serving him for a bed. It is rare for the\r\nOrang to pass the night in the summit of a large tree, probably\r\nbecause it is too windy and cold there for him; but as soon as night\r\ndraws on he descends from the height and seeks out a fit bed in the\r\nlower and darker part, or in the leafy top of a small tree, among\r\nwhich he prefers Nibong palms, Pandani, or one of those parasitic\r\norchids which gave the primeval forests of Borneo so characteristic\r\nand striking an appearance. But whenever he determines to sleep, there\r\nhe prepares himself a sort of nest; little boughs and leaves are drawn\r\ntogether round the selected spot, and bent crosswise over one\r\nanother; while to make the bed soft, great leaves of ferns, of\r\norchids, of _Pandanus fascicularis_, _Nipa fruticans_, etc., are\r\nlaid over them. Those which Mueller saw, many of them being very fresh,\r\nwere situated at a height of ten to twenty-five feet above the ground,\r\nand had a circumference, on the average, of two or three feet. Some\r\nwere packed many inches thick with _pandanus_ leaves; others were\r\nremarkable only for the cracked twigs, which, united in a common\r\ncentre, formed a regular platform. \"The rude _hut_,\" says Sir James\r\nBrooke, \"which they are stated to build in the trees, would be more\r\nproperly called a seat or nest, for it has no roof or cover of any\r\nsort. The facility with which they form this nest is curious, and I\r\nhad an opportunity of seeing a wounded female weave the branches\r\ntogether and seat herself within a minute.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dyaks the Orang rarely leaves his bed before the sun\r\nis well above the horizon and has dissipated the mists. He gets up\r\nabout nine, and goes to bed again about five; but sometimes not till\r\nlate in the twilight. He lies sometimes on his back, or, by way of\r\nchange, turns on one side or the other, drawing his limbs up to his\r\nbody, and resting his head on his hand. When the night is cold, windy,\r\nor rainy, he usually covers his body with a heap of _pandanus nipa_,\r\nor fern leaves, like those of which his bed is made, and he is\r\nespecially careful to wrap up his head in them. It is this habit of\r\ncovering himself up which has probably led to the fable that the Orang\r\nbuilds huts in the trees.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Orang resides mostly amid the boughs of great trees\r\nduring the daytime, he is very rarely seen squatting on a thick branch\r\nas other apes, and particularly the Gibbons, do. The Orang, on the\r\ncontrary, confines himself to the slender leafy branches, so that he\r\nis seen right at the top of the trees, a mode of life which is closely\r\nrelated to the constitution of his hinder limbs, and especially to\r\nthat of his seat. For this is provided with no callosites such as\r\nare possessed by many of the lower apes, and even by the Gibbons; and\r\nthose bones of the pelvis, which are termed the ischia, and which form\r\nthe solid framework of the surface on which the body rests in the\r\nsitting posture, are not expanded like those of the apes which possess\r\ncallosities, but are more like those of man.\r\n\r\nAn Orang climbs so slowly and cautiously as, in this act, to resemble\r\na man more than an ape, taking great care of his feet, so that injury\r\nof them seems to affect him far more than it does other apes. Unlike\r\nthe Gibbons, whose forearms do the greater part of the work as they\r\nswing from branch to branch, the Orang never makes even the smallest\r\njump. In climbing, he moves alternately one hand and one foot, or,\r\nafter having laid fast hold with the hands, he draws up both feet\r\ntogether. In passing from one tree to another he always seeks out a\r\nplace where the twigs of both come close together, or interlace. Even\r\nwhen closely pursued, his circumspection is amazing; he shakes the\r\nbranches to see if they will bear him, and then bending an overhanging\r\nbough down by throwing his weight gradually along it, he makes a\r\nbridge from the tree he wishes to quit to the next.\r\n\r\nOn the ground the Orang always goes laboriously and shakily on all\r\nfours. At starting he will run faster than a man, though he may soon\r\nbe overtaken. The very long arms which, when he runs, are but little\r\nbent, raise the body of the Orang remarkably, so that he assumes much\r\nthe posture of a very old man bent down by age, and making his way\r\nalong by the help of a stick. In walking, the body is usually directed\r\nstraight forward, unlike the other apes, which run more or less\r\nobliquely, except the Gibbons, who in these, as in so many other\r\nrespects, depart remarkably from their fellows.\r\n\r\nThe Orang cannot put its feet flat on the ground, but is supported\r\nupon their outer edges, the heel resting more on the ground, while the\r\ncurved toes partly rest upon the ground by the upper side of their\r\nfirst joint, the two outermost toes of each foot completely resting on\r\nthis surface. The hands are held in the opposite manner, their inner\r\nedges serving as the chief support. The fingers are then bent out in\r\nsuch a manner that their foremost joints, especially those of the two\r\ninner-most fingers, rest upon the ground by their upper sides, while\r\nthe point of the free and straight thumb serves as an additional\r\nfulcrum.\r\n\r\nThe Orang never stands on its hind legs, and all the pictures\r\nrepresenting it as so doing are as false as the assertion that it\r\ndefends itself with sticks and the like.\r\n\r\nThe long arms are of especial use, not only in climbing, but in the\r\ngathering of food from boughs to which the animal could not trust his\r\nweight. Figs, blossoms, and young leaves of various kinds, constitute\r\nthe chief nutriment of the Orang; but strips of bamboo two or three\r\nfeet long were found in the stomach of a male. They are not known to\r\neat living animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough, when taken young, the Orang-Utan soon becomes domesticated,\r\nand indeed seems to court human society; it is naturally a very wild\r\nand shy animal, though apparently sluggish and melancholy. The Dyaks\r\naffirm that when the old males are wounded with arrows only they will\r\noccasionally leave the trees and rush raging upon their enemies, whose\r\nsole safety lies in instant flight, as they are sure to be killed if\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nBut, though possessed of immense strength, it is rare for the Orang to\r\nattempt to defend itself, especially when attacked with firearms. On\r\nsuch occasions he endeavors to hide himself, or to escape along the\r\ntop-most branches of the trees, breaking off and throwing down the\r\nboughs as he goes. When wounded he betakes himself to the highest\r\nattainable point of the tree, and emits a singular cry, consisting at\r\nfirst of high notes, which at length deepen into a low roar, not\r\nunlike that of a panther. While giving out the high notes the Orang\r\nthrusts out his lips into a funnel-shape; but in uttering the low\r\nnotes he holds his mouth wide open, and at the same time the great\r\nthroat bag, or laryngeal sac, becomes distended.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dyaks, the only animal the Orang measures his\r\nstrength with is the crocodile, who occasionally seizes him on his\r\nvisits to the water-side. But they say that the Orang is more than a\r\nmatch for his enemy, and beats him to death, or rips up his throat by\r\npulling the jaws asunder!\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been here stated was probably derived by Dr. Mueller\r\nfrom the reports of his Dyak hunters; but a large male, four feet\r\nhigh, lived in captivity under his observation for a month, and\r\nreceives a very bad character.\r\n\r\n\"He was a very wild beast,\" says Mueller, \"of prodigious strength, and\r\nfalse and wicked to the last degree. If any one approached he rose up\r\nslowly with a low growl, fixed his eyes in the direction in which he\r\nmeant to make his attack, slowly passed his hand between the bars of\r\nhis cage, and then, extending his long arm, gave a sudden\r\ngrip--usually at the face.\" He never tried to bite (though Orangs will\r\nbite one another), his great weapons of offence and defence being his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHis intelligence was very great; and Mueller remarks that, though the\r\nfaculties of the Orang have been estimated too highly, yet Cuvier, had\r\nhe seen this specimen, would not have considered its intelligence to\r\nbe only a little higher than that of a dog.\r\n\r\nHis hearing was very acute, but the sense of vision seemed to be less\r\nperfect. The under lip was the great organ of touch, and played a very\r\nimportant part in drinking, being thrust out like a trough, so as\r\neither to catch the falling rain or to receive the contents of the\r\nhalf cocoanut shell full of water with which the Orang was supplied,\r\nand which, in drinking, he poured into the trough thus formed.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo, the Orang-Utan of the Malays goes by the name of \"_Mias_\"\r\namong the Dyaks, who distinguish several kinds as _Mias Pappan_, or\r\n_Zimo_, _Mias Kassu_, and _Mias Rambi_. Whether these are distinct\r\nspecies, however, or whether they are mere races, and how far any of\r\nthem are identical with the Sumatran Orang, as Mr. Wallace thinks the\r\nMias Pappan to be, are problems which are at present undecided; and\r\nthe variability of these great apes is so extensive that the\r\nsettlement of the question is a matter of great difficulty. Of the\r\nform called \"Mias Pappan,\" Mr. Wallace observes: \"It is known by its\r\nlarge size, and by the lateral expansion of the face into fatty\r\nprotuberances, or ridges, over the temporal muscles, which have been\r\nmistermed callosites, as they are perfectly soft, smooth, and\r\nflexible. Five of this form, measured by me, varied only from 4 feet\r\n1 inch to 4 feet 2 inches in height, from the heel to the crown of the\r\nhead, the girth of the body from 3 feet to 3 feet 71/2 inches, and the\r\nextent of the outstretched arms from 7 feet 2 inches to 7 feet\r\n6 inches; the width of the face from 10 to 131/4 inches. The color and\r\nlength of the hair varied in different individuals, and in different\r\nparts of the same individual; some possessed a rudimentary nail on the\r\ngreat toe, others none at all; but they otherwise present no external\r\ndifferences on which to establish even varieties of a species.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, when we examine the crania of these individuals, we find\r\nremarkable differences of form, proportion, and dimension, no two\r\nbeing exactly alike. The slope of the profile, and the projection of\r\nthe muzzle, together with the size of the cranium, offer differences\r\nas decided as those existing between the most strongly marked forms of\r\nthe Caucasian and African crania in the human species. The orbits vary\r\nin width and height, the cranial ridge is either single or double,\r\neither much or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture varies\r\nconsiderably in size. This variation in the proportions of the crania\r\nenables us satisfactorily to explain the marked difference presented\r\nby the single-crested and double-crested skulls, which have been\r\nthought to prove the existence of two large species of Orang. The\r\nexternal surface of the skull varies considerably in size, as do also\r\nthe zygomatic aperture and the temporal muscle: but they bear no\r\nnecessary relation to each other, a small muscle often existing with a\r\nlarge cranial surface, and vice versa. Now those skulls which have the\r\nlargest and strongest jaws, and the widest zygomatic aperture, have\r\nthe muscles so large that they meet on the crown of the skull, and\r\ndeposit the bony ridge which separates them, and which is the highest\r\nin that which has the smallest cranial surface. In those which combine\r\na large surface with comparatively weak jaws, and small zygomatic\r\naperture, the muscles, on each side, do not extend to the crown, a\r\nspace of from 1 to 2 inches remaining between them, and along their\r\nmargins small ridges are formed. Intermediate forms are found, in\r\nwhich the ridges meet only in the hinder part of the skull. The form\r\nand size of the ridges are therefore independent of age, being\r\nsometimes more strongly developed in the less aged animal. Professor\r\nTemminck states that the series of skulls in the Leyden Museum shows\r\nthe same result.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace observed two male adult Orangs (Mias Kassu of the Dyaks),\r\nhowever, so very different from any of these that he concludes them to\r\nbe specially distinct; they were respectively 3 feet 81/2 inches and\r\n3 feet 91/2 inches high, and possessed no sign of the cheek excrescences,\r\nbut otherwise resembled the larger kinds. The skull has no crest, but\r\ntwo bony ridges, 13/4 to 2 inches apart, as in the _Simia morio_ of\r\nProfessor Owen. The teeth, however, are immense, equalling or\r\nsurpassing those of the other species. The females of both these\r\nkinds, according to Mr. Wallace, are devoid of excrescences, and\r\nresemble the smaller males, but are shorter by 11/2 to 3 inches, and\r\ntheir canine teeth are comparatively small, subtruncated and dilated\r\nat the base, as in the so-called _Simia morio_, which is, in all\r\nprobability, the skull of a female of the same species as the smaller\r\nmales. Both males and females of this smaller species are\r\ndistinguishable, according to Mr. Wallace, by the comparatively large\r\nsize of the middle incisors of the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no one has attempted to dispute the accuracy of\r\nthe statements which I have just quoted regarding the habits of the\r\ntwo Asiatic man-like Apes; and if true, they must be admitted as\r\nevidence that such an ape--\r\n\r\n1stly, May readily move along the ground in the erect, or semi-erect,\r\nposition, and without direct support from its arms.\r\n\r\n2dly, That it may possess an extremely loud voice--so loud as to be\r\nreadily heard one or two miles.\r\n\r\n3dly, That it may be capable of great viciousness and violence when\r\nirritated; and this is especially true of adult males.\r\n\r\n4thly, That it may build a nest to sleep in.\r\n\r\nSuch being well-established facts respecting the Asiatic anthropoids,\r\nanalogy alone might justify us in expecting the African species to\r\noffer similar peculiarities, separately or combined; or, at any rate,\r\nwould destroy the force of any attempted _a priori_ argument against\r\nsuch direct testimony as might be adduced in favor of their existence.\r\nAnd if the organization of any of the African apes could be\r\ndemonstrated to fit it better than either of its Asiatic allies for\r\nthe erect position and for efficient attack, there would be still less\r\nreason for doubting its occasional adoption of the upright attitude,\r\nor of aggressive proceedings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF CHIMPANZEE.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Tyson and Tulpius downward the habits of the young\r\nChimpanzee in a state of captivity have been abundantly reported and\r\ncommented upon. But trustworthy evidence as to the manners and customs\r\nof adult anthropoids of this species, in their native woods, was\r\nalmost wanting up to the time of the publication of the paper by Dr.\r\nSavage, to which I have already referred, containing notes of the\r\nobservations which he made, and of the information which he collected\r\nfrom sources which he considered trustworthy, while resident at Cape\r\nPalmas, at the north-western limit of the Bight of Benin.\r\n\r\nThe adult Chimpanzees, measured by Dr. Savage, never exceeded, though\r\nthe males may almost attain, five feet in height.\r\n\r\n\"When at rest, the sitting posture is that generally assumed. They are\r\nsometimes seen standing and walking, but when thus detected, they\r\nimmediately take to all fours and flee from the presence of the\r\nobserver. Such is their organization that they cannot stand erect, but\r\nlean forward. Hence they are seen, when standing, with the hands\r\nclasped over the occiput, or the lumbar region, which would seem\r\nnecessary to balance or ease of posture.\r\n\r\n\"The toes of the adult are strongly flexed and turned inward, and\r\ncannot be perfectly straightened. In the attempt the skin gathers into\r\nthick folds on the back, showing that the full expansion of the foot,\r\nas is necessary in walking, is unnatural. The natural position is on\r\nall fours, the body anteriorly resting upon the knuckles. These are\r\ngreatly enlarged, with the skin protuberant and thickened like the\r\nsole of the foot.\r\n\r\n\"They are expert climbers, as one would suppose from their\r\norganization. In their gambols they swing from limb to limb at a great\r\ndistance, and leap with astonishing agility. It is not unusual to see\r\nthe 'old folks' (in the language of an observer) sitting under a tree\r\nregaling themselves with fruit and friendly chat, while their\r\n'children' are leaping around them, and swinging from tree to tree\r\nwith boisterous merriment.\r\n\r\n\"As seen here, they cannot be called _gregarious_, seldom more than\r\nfive, or ten at most, being found together. It has been said, on good\r\nauthority, that they occasionally assemble in large numbers, in\r\ngambols. My informant asserts that he saw once not less than fifty so\r\nengaged, hooting, screaming, and drumming with sticks upon old logs,\r\nwhich is done in the latter case with equal facility by the four\r\nextremities. They do not appear ever to act on the offensive, and,\r\nseldom, if ever, really on the defensive. When about to be captured,\r\nthey resist by throwing their arms about their opponent, and\r\nattempting to draw him into contact with their teeth.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to this last point Dr. Savage is very explicit in another\r\nplace:\r\n\r\n\"_Biting_ is their principal art of defence. I have seen one man who\r\nhad been thus severely wounded in the feet.\r\n\r\n\"The strong development of the canine teeth in the adult would seem to\r\nindicate a carnivorous propensity; but in no state save that of\r\ndomestication do they manifest it. At first they reject flesh, but\r\neasily acquire a fondness for it. The canines are early developed, and\r\nevidently designed to act the important part of weapons of defence.\r\nWhen in contact with man almost the first effort of the animal is--_to\r\nbite_.\r\n\r\n\"They avoid the abodes of men, and build their habitations in trees.\r\nTheir construction is more that of _nests_ than _huts_, as they have\r\nbeen erroneously termed by some naturalists. They generally build not\r\nfar above the ground. Branches or twigs are bent, or partly broken,\r\nand crossed, and the whole supported by the body of a limb or a\r\ncrotch. Sometimes a nest will be found near the _end_ of a _strong\r\nleafy branch_ twenty or thirty feet from the ground. One I have lately\r\nseen that could not be less than forty feet, and more probably it was\r\nfifty. But this is an unusual height.\r\n\r\n\"Their dwelling-place is not permanent, but changed in pursuit of food\r\nand solitude, according to the force of circumstances. We most often\r\nsee them in elevated places; but this arises from the fact that the\r\nlow grounds, being more favorable for the natives' rice-farms, are the\r\noftener cleared, and hence are almost always wanting in suitable trees\r\nfor their nests.... It is seldom that more than one or two nests are\r\nseen upon the same tree, or in the same neighborhood: five have been\r\nfound, but it was an unusual circumstance.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"They are very filthy in their habits. It is a tradition with the\r\nnatives generally here that they were once members of their own tribe;\r\nthat for their depraved habits they were expelled from all human\r\nsociety, and that, through an obstinate indulgence of their vile\r\npropensities, they have degenerated into their present state of\r\norganization. They are, however, eaten by them, and when cooked with\r\nthe oil and pulp of the palm-nut considered a highly palatable morsel.\r\n\r\n\"They exhibit a remarkable degree of intelligence in their habits,\r\nand, on the part of the mother, much affection for their young. The\r\nsecond female described was upon a tree when first discovered, with\r\nher mate and two young ones (a male and a female). Her first impulse\r\nwas to descend with great rapidity and make off into the thicket with\r\nher mate and female offspring. The young male remaining behind, she\r\nsoon returned to the rescue. She ascended and took him in her arms, at\r\nwhich moment she was shot, the ball passing through the forearm of the\r\nyoung one, on the way to the heart of the mother....\r\n\r\n\"In a recent case the mother, when discovered, remained upon the tree\r\nwith her offspring, watching intently the movements of the hunter. As\r\nhe took aim, she motioned with her hand, precisely in the manner of a\r\nhuman being, to have him desist and go away. When the wound has not\r\nproved instantly fatal, they have been known to stop the flow of blood\r\nby pressing with the hand upon the part, and when they did not\r\nsucceed, to apply leaves and grass.... When shot, they give a sudden\r\nscreech, not unlike that of a human, being in sudden and acute\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary voice of the Chimpanzee, however, is affirmed to be\r\nhoarse, guttural, and not very loud, somewhat like 'whoo-whoo.'\"\r\n\r\nThe analogy of the Chimpanzee to the Orang, in its nest-building habit\r\nand in the mode of forming its nest, is exceedingly interesting,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the activity of this ape, and its tendency\r\nto bite, are particulars in which it rather resembles the Gibbons. In\r\nextent of geographical range, again, the Chimpanzees--which are found\r\nfrom Sierra Leone to Congo--remind one of the Gibbons rather than of\r\neither of the other man-like Apes; and it seems not unlikely that, as\r\nis the case with the Gibbons, there may be several species spread over\r\nthe geographical area of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe same excellent observer, from whom I have borrowed the preceding\r\naccount of the habits of the adult Chimpanzee, published an account of\r\nthe Gorilla, which has, in its most essential points, been confirmed\r\nby subsequent observers, and to which so very little has really been\r\nadded, that, in justice to Dr. Savage, I give it almost in full:\r\n\r\n\"It should be borne in mind that my account is based upon the\r\nstatements of the aborigines of that region (the Gaboon). In this\r\nconnection it may also be proper for me to remark that, having been a\r\nmissionary resident for several years, studying, from habitual\r\nintercourse, the African mind and character, I felt myself prepared to\r\ndiscriminate and decide upon the probability of their statements.\r\nBesides, being familiar with the history and habits of its interesting\r\ncongener (_Trogniger_, Geoff.), I was able to separate their accounts\r\nof the two animals, which, having the same locality and a similarity\r\nof habit, are confounded in the minds of the mass, especially as but\r\nfew--such as traders to the interior, and huntsmen--have ever seen the\r\nanimal in question.\r\n\r\n\"The tribe from which our knowledge of the animal is derived, and\r\nwhose territory forms its habitat, is the _Mpongwe_, occupying both\r\nbanks of the River Gaboon, from its mouth to some fifty or sixty miles\r\nupward....\r\n\r\n\"If the word 'Pongo' be of African origin, it is probably a corruption\r\nof the word _Mpongwe_, the name of the tribe on the banks of the\r\nGaboon, and hence applied to the region they inhabit. Their local name\r\nfor the Chimpanzee is _Enche-eko_, as near as it can be Anglicized,\r\nfrom which the common term 'Jocko' probably conies. The _Mpongwe_\r\napellation for its new congener is _Enge-ena_, prolonging the sound of\r\nthe first vowel, and slightly sounding the second.\r\n\r\n\"The habitat of the _Enge-ena_ is the interior of Lower Guinea, while\r\nthat of the _Enche-eko_ is nearer the seaboard.\r\n\r\n\"Its height is about five feet; it is disproportionately broad across\r\nthe shoulders, thickly covered with coarse black hair, which is said\r\nto be similar in its arrangement to that of the _Enche-eko_; with age\r\nit becomes gray, which fact has given rise to the report that both\r\nanimals are seen of different colors.\r\n\r\n\"Head.--The prominent features of the head are the great width and\r\nelongation of the face, the depth of the molar region, the branches of\r\nthe lower jaw being very deep and extending far backward, and the\r\ncomparative smallness of the cranial portion; the eyes are very large,\r\nand said to be like those of the _Enche-eko_, a bright hazel; nose\r\nbroad and flat, slightly elevated toward the root; the muzzle broad,\r\nand prominent lips and chin, with scattered gray hairs; the under lip\r\nhighly mobile, and capable of great elongation when the animal is\r\nenraged, then hanging over the chin; skin of the face and ears naked\r\nand of a dark-brown, approaching to black.\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable feature of the head is a high ridge, or crest of\r\nhair, in the course of the sagittal suture, which meets posteriorly\r\nwith a transverse ridge of the same, but less prominent, running round\r\nfrom the back of one ear to the other. The animal has the power of\r\nmoving the scalp freely forward and back, and when enraged is said to\r\ncontract it strongly over the brow, thus bringing down the hairy ridge\r\nand pointing the hair forward, so as to present an indescribably\r\nferocious aspect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GORILLA.]\r\n\r\n\"Neck short, thick, and hairy; chest and shoulders very broad, and\r\nsaid to be fully double the size of the _Enche-ekos;_ arms very long,\r\nreaching some way below the knee--the forearm much the shortest; hands\r\nvery large, the thumbs much larger than the fingers....\r\n\r\n\"The gait is shuffling; the motion of the body, which is never upright\r\nas in man, but bent forward, is somewhat rolling, or from side to\r\nside. The arms being longer than the Chimpanzee, it does not stoop as\r\nmuch in walking; like that animal, it makes progression by thrusting\r\nits arms forward, resting the hands on the ground, and then giving the\r\nbody a half-jumping, half-swinging motion between them. In this act it\r\nis said not to flex the fingers, as does the Chimpanzee, resting on\r\nits knuckles, but to extend them, making a fulcrum of the hand. When\r\nit assumes the walking posture, to which it is said to be much\r\ninclined, it balances its huge body by flexing its arms upward.\r\n\r\n\"They live in bands, but are not so numerous as the Chimpanzees; the\r\nfemales generally exceed the other sex in number. My informants all\r\nagree in the assertion that but one adult male is seen in a band; that\r\nwhere the young males grow up a contest takes place for mastery, and\r\nthe strongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes\r\nhimself as the head of the community.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Savage repudiates the stories about the Gorillas carrying off\r\nwomen and vanquishing elephants, and then adds:\r\n\r\n\"Their dwellings, if they may be so called, are similar to those of\r\nthe Chimpanzee, consisting simply of a few sticks and leafy branches,\r\nsupported by the crotches and limbs of trees; they afford no shelter,\r\nand are occupied only at night.\r\n\r\n\"They are exceedingly ferocious, and always offensive in their\r\nhabits, never running from man, as does the Chimpanzee. They are\r\nobjects of terror to the natives, and are never encountered by them\r\nexcept on the defensive. The few that have been captured were killed\r\nby elephant-hunters and native traders, as they came suddenly upon\r\nthem while passing through the forests.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that when the male is first seen he gives a terrific yell,\r\nthat resounds far and wide through the forest, something like kh--ah!\r\nkh--ah! prolonged and shrill. His enormous jaws are widely opened at\r\neach expiration, his under-lip hangs over the chin, and the hairy\r\nridge and scalp are contracted upon the brow, presenting an aspect of\r\nindescribable ferocity.\r\n\r\n\"The females and young, at the first cry, quickly disappear. He then\r\napproaches the enemy in great fury, pouring out his horrid cries in\r\nquick succession. The hunter awaits his approach with his gun\r\nextended; if his aim is not sure he permits the animal to grasp the\r\nbarrel, and as he carries it to his mouth (which is his habit) he\r\nfires. Should the gun fail to go off, the barrel (that of the ordinary\r\nmusket, which is thin), is crashed between his teeth and the encounter\r\nsoon proves fatal to the hunter.\r\n\r\n\"In the wild state their habits are in general like those of the\r\n_Troglodytes niger_, building their nests loosely in trees, living\r\non similar fruits, and changing their place of resort from force of\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Savage's observations were confirmed and supplemented by those of\r\nMr. Ford, who communicated an interesting paper on the Gorilla to the\r\nPhiladelphian Academy of Sciences, in 1852. With respect to the\r\ngeographical distribution of this greatest of all the man-like Apes,\r\nMr. Ford remarks:\r\n\r\n\"This animal inhabits the range of mountains that traverse the\r\ninterior of Guinea from the Cameroon in the north to Angola in the\r\nsouth, and about one hundred miles inland, and called by the\r\ngeographers Crystal Mountains. The limit to which this animal extends,\r\neither north or south, I am unable to define. But that limit is\r\ndoubtless some distance north of this river [Gaboon]. I was able to\r\ncertify myself of this fact in a late excursion to the head-waters of\r\nthe Mooney (Danger) River, which comes into the sea some sixty miles\r\nfrom this place. I was informed (credibly, I think), that they were\r\nnumerous among the mountains in which that river rises, and far north\r\nof that.\r\n\r\n\"In the south, this species extends to the Congo River, as I am told\r\nby native traders who have visited the coast, between the Gaboon and\r\nthat river. Beyond that, I am not informed. This animal is only found\r\nat a distance from the coast in most cases, and, according to my best\r\ninformation, approaches it nowhere so nearly as on the south side of\r\nthis river, where they have been found within ten miles of the sea.\r\nThis, however, is only of late occurrence. I am informed by some of\r\nthe oldest Mpongwe men that formerly he was only found on the sources\r\nof the river, but that at present he may be found within half a day's\r\nwalk of its mouth. Formerly he inhabited the mountainous ridge where\r\nBushmen alone inhabited, but now he boldly approaches the Mpongwe\r\nplantations. This is doubtless the reason of the scarcity of\r\ninformation in years past, as the opportunities for receiving a\r\nknowledge of the animal have not been wanting; traders having for one\r\nhundred years frequented this river, and specimens, such as have been\r\nbrought here within a year, could not have been exhibited without\r\nhaving attracted the attention of the most stupid.\"\r\n\r\nOne specimen Mr. Ford examined weighed one hundred and seventy pounds,\r\nwithout the thoracic or pelvic viscera, and measured four feet four\r\ninches round the chest. This writer describes so minutely and\r\ngraphically the onslaught of the Gorilla--though he does not for a\r\nmoment pretend to have witnessed the scene--that I am tempted to give\r\nthis part of his paper in full, for comparison with other narratives.\r\n\r\n\"He always rises to his feet when making an attack, though he\r\napproaches his antagonist in a stooping posture.\r\n\r\n\"Though he never lies in wait, yet, when he hears, sees, or scents a\r\nman, he immediately utters his characteristic cry, prepares for an\r\nattack, and always acts on the offensive. The cry he utters resembles\r\na grunt more than a growl, and is similar to the cry of the Chimpanzee\r\nwhen irritated, but vastly louder. It is said to be audible at a great\r\ndistance. His preparation consists in attending the females and young\r\nones, by whom he is usually accompanied, to a little distance. He,\r\nhowever, soon returns with his crest erect and projecting forward, his\r\nnostrils dilated, and his under-lip thrown down; at the same time\r\nuttering his characteristic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify\r\nhis antagonist. Instantly, unless he is disabled by a well-directed\r\nshot, he makes an onset, and, striking his antagonist with the palm of\r\nhis hands, or seizing him with a grasp from which there is no escape,\r\nhe dashes him upon the ground, and lacerates him with his tusks.\r\n\r\n\"He is said to seize a musket, and instantly crush the barrel between\r\nhis teeth.... This animal's savage nature is very well shown by the\r\nimplacable desperation of a young one that was brought here. It was\r\ntaken very young, and kept four months, and many means were used to\r\ntame it; but it was incorrigible, so that it bit me an hour before it\r\ndied.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND OF GORILLA, ORANG, GIBBON, AND CHIMPANZEE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME STRANGE NURSERIES\r\n\r\n(FROM NATURE'S WORKSHOP.)\r\n\r\nBY GRANT ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou could hardly find a better rough test of relative development in\r\nthe animal (or vegetable) world than the number of young produced and\r\nthe care bestowed upon them. The fewer the offspring, the higher the\r\ntype. Very low animals turn out thousands of eggs with reckless\r\nprofusion; but they let them look after themselves, or be devoured by\r\nenemies, as chance will have it. The higher you go in the scale of\r\nbeing, the smaller the families, but the greater amount of pains\r\nexpended upon the rearing and upbringing of the young. Large broods\r\nmean low organization; small broods imply higher types and more care\r\nin the nurture and education of the offspring. Primitive kinds produce\r\neggs wholesale, on the off chance that some two or three among them\r\nmay perhaps survive an infant mortality of ninety-nine per cent, so as\r\nto replace their parents. Advanced kinds produce half a dozen young,\r\nor less, but bring a large proportion of these on an average up to\r\nyears of discretion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-HORSES.]\r\n\r\nWithout taking into account insects and such other \"small deer,\"--to\r\nquote Shakespeare's expression,--this fundamental principle of\r\npopulation will become at once apparent if we examine merely familiar\r\ninstances of back-boned or vertebrate animals. The lowest vertebrates\r\nare clearly the fishes: and the true fishes have almost invariably\r\ngigantic families. A single cod, for example, is said to produce,\r\nroughly speaking, nine million eggs at a birth (I cannot pretend I\r\nhave checked this calculation); but supposing they were only a\r\nmillion, and that one-tenth of those eggs alone ever came to maturity,\r\nthere would still be a hundred thousand codfish in the sea this year\r\nfor every pair that swam in it last year: and these would increase to\r\na hundred thousand times that number next year; and so on, till in\r\nfour or five years' time the whole sea would be but one solid mass of\r\nclosely-packed cod-banks. We can see for ourselves that nothing of the\r\nsort actually occurs--practically speaking, there are about the same\r\nnumber of cod one year as another. In spite of this enormous\r\nbirth-rate, therefore, the cod population is not increasing--it is at\r\na standstill. What does that imply? Why, that taking one brood and one\r\nyear with another, only a pair of cod, roughly speaking, survive to\r\nmaturity out of each eight or nine million eggs. The mother cod lays\r\nits millions, in order that two may arrive at the period of spawning.\r\nAll the rest get devoured as eggs, or snapped up as young fry, or else\r\ndie of starvation, or are otherwise unaccounted for. It seems to us a\r\nwasteful way of replenishing the earth: but it is nature's way; we can\r\nonly bow respectfully to her final decision.\r\n\r\nFrogs and other amphibians stand higher in the scale of life than\r\nfish; they have acquired legs in place of fins, and lungs instead of\r\ngills; they can hop about on shore with perfect freedom. Now, frogs\r\nstill produce a great deal of spawn, as every one knows: but the eggs\r\nin each brood are numbered in their case by hundreds, or at most by a\r\nthousand or two, not by millions as with many fishes. The spawn\r\nhatches out as a rule in ponds, and we have all seen the little black\r\ntadpoles crowding the edges of the water in such innumerable masses\r\nthat one would suppose the frogs to be developed from them must cover\r\nthe length and breadth of England. Yet what becomes of them all?\r\nHundreds are destroyed in the early tadpole stage--eaten up or\r\nstarved, or crowded out for want of air and space and water: a few\r\nalone survive or develop four legs, and absorb their tails and hop on\r\nshore as tiny froglings. Even then the massacre of the innocents\r\ncontinues. Only a tithe of those which succeeded in quitting their\r\nnative pond ever return to it full grown, to spawn in due time, and\r\nbecome the parents of further generations.\r\n\r\nLizards and other reptiles make an obvious advance on the frog type;\r\nthey lay relatively few eggs, but they begin to care for their young.\r\nThe family is not here abandoned at birth, as among frogs, but is\r\nfrequently tended and fed and overlooked by the mother. In birds we\r\nhave a still higher development of the same marked parental tendency;\r\nonly three or four eggs are laid each year, as a rule, and on these\r\neggs the mother sits, while both parents feed the callow nestlings\r\ntill such time as they are able to take care of themselves and pick\r\nup their own living. Among mammals, which stand undoubtedly at the\r\nhead of created nature, the lower types, like mice and rabbits, have\r\nfrequent broods of many young at a time; but the more advanced groups,\r\nsuch as the horses, cows, deer, and elephants, have usually one foal\r\nor calf at a birth, and seldom produce more than a couple. Moreover,\r\nin all these higher cases alike, the young are fed with milk by the\r\nmother, and so spared the trouble of providing for themselves in their\r\nearly days, like the young codfish or the baby tadpole. Starvation at\r\nthe outset is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, too, that anticipations of higher types, so\r\nto speak, often occur among lower races. An animal here and there\r\namong the simpler forms hits upon some device essentially similar to\r\nthat of some higher group with which it is really quite unrelated. For\r\nexample, those who have read my account of the common earwig (given in\r\nthe sixth chapter of \"Flashlights on Nature\") will recollect how that\r\nlowly insect sits on her eggs much as a hen does, and brings up her\r\nbrood of callow grubs as if they were chickens. In much the same way,\r\nanticipations of the mammalian type occur pretty frequently among\r\nlower animals. Our commonest English lizard, for example, which\r\nfrequents moors and sandhills, does not lay or deposit its eggs at\r\nall, but hatches them out in its own body, and so apparently brings\r\nthem forth alive: while among snakes, the same habit occurs in the\r\nadder or viper. The very name _viper_, indeed, is a corruption of\r\n_vivipara_, the snake which produces living young. Still more closely\r\ndo some birds resemble mammals in the habit of secreting a sort of\r\nmilk for the sustenance of their nestlings. Most people think the\r\nphrase \"pigeon's milk\" is much like the phrase \"the horse-marines,\" a\r\nburlesque name for an absurd and impossible monstrosity. But it is\r\nnothing of the sort: it answers to a real fact in the economy of\r\ncertain doves, which eat grain or seeds, grind and digest it in their\r\nown gizzards into a fine soft pulp or porridge, and then feed their\r\nyoung with it from their crops and beaks. This is thus a sort of\r\nbird-like imitation of milk. Only the cow or the goat takes grass or\r\nleaves, chews, swallows, and digests them, and manufactures from them\r\nin her own body that much more nutritive substance, milk, with which\r\nall mammals feed their infant offspring.\r\n\r\nNow, after this rather long preamble, I am going to show you in this\r\npresent article a few other examples of special care taken of the\r\nyoung in certain quarters where it might be least expected. Fish are\r\nnot creatures from which we look for marked domestic virtues: yet we\r\nmay find them there abundantly. Let us begin with that familiar friend\r\nof our childhood, the common English stickleback.\r\n\r\nWhich of us cannot look back in youth to the mysteries of the\r\nstickleback fisheries? Captains courageous, we sailed forth with bent\r\npin and piece of thread, to woo the wily quarry with half an inch of\r\nchopped earthworm. For stickleback abound in every running stream and\r\npond in England. They are beautiful little creatures, too, when you\r\ncome to examine them, great favorites in the fresh-water aquarium; the\r\nmale in particular is exquisitely colored, his hues growing brighter\r\nand his sheen more conspicuous at the pairing season. There are many\r\nspecies of sticklebacks--in England we have three very different\r\nkinds--but all are alike in one point which gives them their common\r\nname, that is to say, in their aggressive and protective prickliness.\r\nThey are armed against all comers. The dorsal fin is partly replaced\r\nin the whole family by strong spines or \"stickles,\" which differ in\r\nnumber in the different species. One of our English sorts is a lover\r\nof salt water: he lives in the sea, especially off the Cornish coast,\r\nand has fifteen stickles or spines; on which account he is commonly\r\nknown as the Fifteen-spined Stickleback; our other two sorts belong to\r\nfresher waters, and are known as the Ten-spined and the Three-spined\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe special peculiarity of the male stickleback consists in the fact\r\nthat he is, above all things, a model father. In his acute sense of\r\nparental responsibility he has few equals. When spring comes round, he\r\nfirst exhibits his consciousness of his coming charge by suddenly\r\nenduing himself in a glowing coat of many colors and of iridescent\r\nbrilliancy. That is in order to charm the eyes of the prospective\r\nmate, or rather mates, for I may as well confess the sad truth at once\r\nthat our amiable friend is a good parent but an abandoned polygamist.\r\nWe all know that\r\n\r\n   \"In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;\r\n    In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;\r\n    In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;\r\n    In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.\"\r\n\r\nNot to be out of the fashion, therefore, the romantic stickleback does\r\nprecisely the same thing as all these distinguished and poetical\r\ncompeers. And he does it for the same reason, too; because he wants to\r\nget himself an appropriate partner. \"There is a great deal of human\r\nnature in man,\" it has been said: I am always inclined to add, \"And\r\nthere is a great deal of human nature in plants and animals.\" The more\r\nwe know of our dumb relations, the more closely do we realize the\r\nkinship between us. Fish in the spring are like young men at a\r\nfair--all eager for the attention of their prospective partners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 1. FEMALE STICKLEBACK ABOUT TO ENTER NEST.]\r\n\r\nThe first care of the male stickleback, when he has acquired his\r\ncourting suit, is to build a suitable home for his future wives and\r\nchildren. So he picks up stems of grass and water-weeds with his\r\nmouth, and weaves them deftly into a compact nest as perfect as a\r\nbird's, though some what different in shape and pattern, it rather\r\nresembles a barrel, open at both ends, as though the bottom were\r\nknocked out: this form is rendered necessary because the eggs, when\r\nlaid, have to be constantly aerated by passing a current of water\r\nthrough the nest as I shall describe hereafter. No. 1 shows us such a\r\nnest when completed, with the female stickleback loitering about\r\nundecided as to whether or not she shall plunge and enter it. You\r\nwill observe that the fabric is woven round a fixed support of some\r\nwaving water-weeds; but the cunning little architect does not trust in\r\nthis matter to his textile skill alone; he cements the straws and\r\nother materials together with a gummy mortar of mucous threads\r\nsecreted for the purpose by his internal organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 2. FEMALE STICKLEBACK LAYING EGGS IN NEST.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the building operations are fully completed, the eager\r\nlittle householder sallies forth into his pond or brook in search of\r\na mate who will come and stock his neatly-built home for him. At this\r\nstage of the proceedings, his wedding-garment becomes even more\r\nbrilliant and glancing than ever; he gleams in silver and changeful\r\ngems; when he finds his lady-love, he dances round her, \"mad with\r\nexcitement,\" as Darwin well phrased it, looking his handsomest and\r\nbest with his lustrous colours glistening like an opal. If she will\r\nlisten to his suit, he grows wild with delight, and coaxes her into\r\nthe nest with most affectionate endearments. In No. 2, as you\r\nperceive, the mate of his choice has been induced to enter, and is\r\nlaying her eggs in the dainty home his care has provided for her. The\r\nfather fish, meanwhile dances and capers around, in a _pas de\r\ntriomphe_ at the success of his endeavors.\r\n\r\nOne wife, however, does not suffice to fill the nest with eggs; and\r\nthe stickleback is a firm believer in the advantages of large\r\nfamilies. So, as soon as his first mate has laid all her spawn, he\r\nsets out once more in search of another. Thus he goes on until the\r\nhome is quite full of eggs, bringing back one wife after another, in\r\nproportion to his success in wooing and fighting. For, like almost all\r\npolygamists, your stickleback is a terrible fighter. The males join\r\nwager of battle with one another for possession of their mates; in\r\ntheir fierce duels they make fearful use of the formidable spines on\r\ntheir backs, sometimes entirely ripping up and cutting to pieces their\r\nill-fated adversary. The spines thus answer to the spurs of the\r\ngamecock or the antlers of the deer; they are masculine weapons in the\r\nstruggle for mates. Indeed, you may take it for granted that brilliant\r\ncolors and decorative adjuncts in animals almost invariably go with\r\nirascible tempers, pugnacious habits, and the practice of fighting for\r\nthe possession of the harem. The consequence is, with the\r\nsticklebacks, that many males get killed during the struggle for\r\nsupremacy, so that the survivors wed half a dozen wives each, like\r\nlittle Turks that they are in their watery seraglios. Only the most\r\nbeautiful and courageous fish succeed in gaining a harem of their own:\r\nand thus the wager of battle tells in the end for the advantage of the\r\nrace, by eliminating the maimed, the ugly, and the cowardly, and\r\nencouraging the strong, the handsome, the enterprising, and the\r\nvaliant. This is nature's way of preventing degeneracy.\r\n\r\nIn No. 3 the nest is seen full of eggs, and the excellent father now\r\ncomes out in his best light as their guardian and protector. He\r\nwatches over them with ceaseless care, freeing them from parasites,\r\nand warding off the attacks of would-be enemies who desire to devour\r\nthem, even though the intruder be several times his own size. The\r\nspines on his back here stand him once more in good stead: for small\r\nas he is, the stickleback is not an antagonist to be lightly despised:\r\nhe can inflict a wound which a perch or a trout knows how to estimate\r\nat its full value. But that is not all the good parent's duty. He\r\ntakes the eggs out of the nest every now and then with his snout, airs\r\nthem a little in the fresh water outside, and then replaces and\r\nrearranges them, so that all may get a fair share of oxygen and may\r\nhatch out about simultaneously. It is this question of oxygen, indeed,\r\nwhich gives the father fish all the greatest trouble. That necessary\r\nof life is dissolved in water in very small quantities; and it is\r\nabsolutely needed by every egg in order to enable it to undergo those\r\nvital changes which we know as hatching. To keep up a due supply of\r\noxygen, therefore, the father stickleback ungrudgingly devotes\r\nlaborious days in poising himself delicately just above the nest, as\r\nyou see in No. 3, and fanning the eggs with his fins and tail, so as\r\nto set up a constant current of water through the centre of the\r\nbarrel. He sits upon the eggs just as truly as a hen does; only, he\r\nsits upon them, not for warmth, but for aeration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 3. MALE STICKLEBACK WATCHING EGGS IN NEST.]\r\n\r\nFor weeks together this exemplary parent continues his monotonous\r\ntask, ventilating the spawn many times every day, till the time comes\r\nfor hatching. It takes about a month for the eggs to develop: and then\r\nthe proud father's position grows more arduous than ever. He has to\r\nrock a thousand cradles at once, so to speak, and to pacify a thousand\r\ncrying babies. On the one hand, enemies hover about, trying to eat the\r\ntender transparent glass-like little fry, and these he must drive off:\r\non the other hand, the good nurse must take care that the active young\r\nfish do not stray far from the nest, and so expose themselves\r\nprematurely to the manifold dangers of the outer world. Till they are\r\nbig enough to take care of themselves, he watches with incessant\r\nvigilance over their safety; as soon as they can go forth with\r\ntolerable security upon the world of their brook or pond, he takes a\r\nlast well-merited holiday.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising under these circumstances to learn that\r\nsticklebacks are successful and increasing animals. Their numbers are\r\nenormous, wherever they get a fair chance in life, because they\r\nmultiply rapidly up to the extreme limit of the means of subsistence,\r\nand develop as fast as food remains for them. There the inexorable\r\nMalthusian law at last steps in: when there is not food enough for all\r\nsome must starve; that is the long and the short of the great\r\npopulation question. But while provender is forthcoming they increase\r\ngayly. Sticklebacks live mainly on the spawn of other fish, though\r\nthey are so careful of their own, and they are therefore naturally\r\nhated by trout-preservers and owners of fisheries in general.\r\nThousands and thousands are caught each year; in some places, indeed,\r\nthey are so numerous that they are used as manure. It is their\r\nnumbers, of course, that make them formidable; they are the locusts of\r\nthe streams, well armed and pugnacious, and provided with most\r\nremarkable parental instincts of a protective character, which enables\r\nthem to fill up all vacancies in their ranks as fast as they occur\r\nwith astonishing promptitude.\r\n\r\nTo those whose acquaintance with fish is mainly culinary, it may seem\r\nodd to hear that the father stickleback alone takes part in the care\r\nof the nursery. But this is the rule among the whole class of fish;\r\nwherever the young are tended, it is almost always the father, not the\r\nmother, who undertakes the duty of incubation. Only two instances\r\noccur where the female fish assumes maternal functions towards her\r\nyoung; about these I shall have more to say a little later on. We must\r\nremember that reptiles, birds, and mammals are in all probability\r\ndescended from fish as ancestors, and it is therefore clear that the\r\nhabit of handing over the care of the young to the female alone\r\nbelongs to the higher grades of vertebrates--in other words, is of\r\nlater origin. We need not be astonished, therefore, to find that in\r\nmany cases among birds and other advanced vertebrates a partial\r\nreversion to the earlier habit not infrequently takes place. With\r\ndoves, for example, the cock and hen birds sit equally on the eggs,\r\ntaking turns about at the nest; and as for the ostriches, the male\r\nbird there does most of the incubation, for he accepts the whole of\r\nthe night duty, and also assists at intervals during the daytime.\r\nThere are numerous other cases where the father bird shares the tasks\r\nof the nursery at least equally with the mother. I will glance first,\r\nhowever, at one of the rare exceptions among fish where the main duty\r\ndoes not devolve on the devoted father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 4. FEMALE TUBE-MOUTH.]\r\n\r\nIn No. 4 we have an illustration of the tube-mouth or Solenostoma, one\r\nof the two known kinds of fish in which the female shows a sense of\r\nher position as a mother. The tube-mouth, as you can see at a glance,\r\nis a close relation of our old friend the seahorse, whose disguised\r\nand undisguised forms in Australia and the Mediterranean we have\r\nalready observed when dealing with the question of animal\r\nmasqueraders. Solenostoma is a native of the Indian Ocean, from\r\nZanzibar to China. In the male, the lower pair of fins are separate,\r\nas is usual among fish; but in the female, represented in the\r\naccompanying sketch, they are lightly joined at the edge, so as to\r\nform a sort of pouch like a kangaroo's, in which the eggs are\r\ndeposited after being laid, and thus carried about in the mother's\r\nsafe keeping. No. 5 shows the arrangement of this pouch in detail,\r\nwith the eggs inside it. The mother Solenostoma not only takes charge\r\nof the spawn while it is hatching in this receptacle, but also looks\r\nafter the young fry, like the father stickleback, till they are of an\r\nage to go off on their own account in quest of adventures. The most\r\nfrequent adventure that happens to them on the way is, of course,\r\nbeing eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 5. POUCH OF TUBE-MOUTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 6. PIPE-FISH.]\r\n\r\nThe common English pipe-fish is a good example of the other and much\r\nmore usual case in which the father alone is actuated by a proper\r\nsense of parental responsibility. The pipe-fish, indeed, might almost\r\nbe described as a pure and blameless rate-payer. No. 6 shows you the\r\nouter form of this familiar creature, whom you will recognize at a\r\nglance as still more nearly allied to the sea-horses than even the\r\ntube-mouth. Pipe-fishes are timid and skulking creatures. Like their\r\nhorse-headed relations, they lurk for the most part among sea-weed\r\nfor protection, and being but poor swimmers, never venture far from\r\nthe covering shelter of their native thicket. But the curious part of\r\nthem is that in this family the father fish is provided with a pouch\r\neven more perfect than that of the female tube-mouth, and that he\r\nhimself, not his mate takes sole charge of the young, incubates them\r\nin his sack, and escorts them about for some time after hatching. The\r\npouch, which is more fully represented in No. 7, is formed by a loose\r\nfold of skin arising from either side of the creature. In the\r\nillustration this fold is partly withdrawn, so as to show the young\r\npipe-fish within their safe retreat after hatching out. It is said, I\r\nknow not how truly, that the young fry will stroll out for an\r\noccasional swim on their own account, but will return at any threat of\r\ndanger to their father's bosom, for a considerable time after the\r\nfirst hatching. This is just like what one knows of kangaroos and many\r\nother pouched mammals, where the mother's pouch becomes a sort of\r\nnursery, or place of refuge, to which the little ones return for\r\nwarmth or safety after every excursion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 7. POUCH OF PIPE-FISH.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-horses and many other fish have similar pouches; but, oddly\r\nenough, in every case it is the male fish which bears it, and which\r\nundertakes the arduous duty of nurse for his infant offspring.\r\n\r\nA few female fish, on the other hand, even hatch the eggs within their\r\nown bodies, and so apparently bring forth their young alive, like the\r\nEnglish lizard among reptiles. This, however, is far from a common\r\ncase: indeed, in an immense number of instances, neither parent pays\r\nthe slightest attention to the eggs after they are once laid and got\r\nrid of: the spawn is left to lie on the bottom and be eaten or spared\r\nas chance directs, while the young fry have to take care of\r\nthemselves, without the aid of parental advice and education. But\r\nexceptions occur where both parents show signs of realizing the\r\nresponsibilities of their position. In some little South American\r\nriver fish, for instance, the father and mother together build a nest\r\nof dead leaves for the spawn, and watch over it in unison until the\r\nyoung are hatched. This case is exactly analogous to that of the doves\r\namong birds: I may add that wherever such instances occur they always\r\nseem to be accompanied by a markedly gentle and affectionate nature.\r\nBrilliantly-coloured fighting polygamous fishes are fierce and cruel:\r\nmonogamous and faithful animals are seldom bright-hued, but they mate\r\nfor life and are usually remarkable for their domestic felicity. The\r\ndoves and love-birds are familiar instances.\r\n\r\nFrogs are very closely allied to fish: indeed, one may almost say that\r\nevery frog begins life as a fish, limbless, gill-bearing, and aquatic,\r\nand ends it as something very like a reptile, four-legged,\r\nlung-bearing, and more or less terrestrial. For the tadpole is\r\npractically in all essentials a fish. It is not odd, therefore, to\r\nfind that certain frogs reproduce, in a very marked manner, the\r\nfatherly traits of their fish-like ancestors. There is a common kind\r\nof frog in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, which does not extend to\r\nEngland, but which closely recalls the habits of the stickleback and\r\nthe pipe-fish. Among these eminently moral amphibians, it is the\r\nfather, not the mother, who takes entire charge of the family. The\r\nfemale lays her spawn in the shape of long strings or rolls, looking\r\nat first sight like slimy necklaces. I have seen them as much as a\r\ncouple of yards long, lying loose on the grass where the frog lays\r\nthem. As soon as she has deposited them, however, the father frog hops\r\nup, twists the garlands dexterously in loose festoons round his legs\r\nand thighs, and then retires with his precious burden to some hole in\r\nthe bank of his native pond, where he lurks in seclusion till the eggs\r\ndevelop. Frogs do not need frequent doses of food--their meals are\r\noften few and far between--and during the six or eight weeks that the\r\neggs take to mature the father probably eats very little, though he\r\nmay possibly sally forth at night, unobserved, in search of provender.\r\nAt the end of that time the devoted parent, foreseeing developments,\r\ntakes to the water once more, so that the tadpoles may be hatched in\r\ntheir proper element. I may add that this frog is a great musician in\r\nthe breeding season, but that as soon as the tadpoles are hatched out\r\nhe loses his voice entirely, and does not recover his manly croak till\r\nthe succeeding spring. This is also the case with the song of many\r\nbirds, the crest of the newt, the plumes of certain highly-decorated\r\ntrogons and nightjars, and, roughly speaking, the decorative and\r\nattractive features of the male sex in general. Such features are\r\ngiven them during the mating period as allurements for their\r\nconsorts: they disappear, for the time at least, like a ball-dress\r\nafter a ball, as soon as no immediate use can any longer be made of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POUCHED FROG.]\r\n\r\nSome American tree-frogs, on the other hand, imitate rather the\r\nmotherly Solenostoma than the fatherly instincts of the pipe-fish or\r\nthe stickleback. These pretty little creatures have a pouch like the\r\nkangaroo, but in their case (as in the kangaroo's) it is the female\r\nwho bears it. Within this safe receptacle the eggs are placed by the\r\nmale, who pushes them in with his hind feet; and they not only undergo\r\ntheir hatching in the pouch, but also pass through their whole tadpole\r\ndevelopment in the same place. Owing to the care which is thus\r\nextended to the eggs and young, these advanced tree-frogs are enabled\r\nto lay only about a dozen to fifteen eggs at a time, instead of the\r\ncountless hundreds often produced by many of their relations.\r\n\r\nTree-frogs have, of course, in most circumstances much greater\r\ndifficulty in getting at water than pond-frogs; and this is especially\r\ntrue in certain tropical or desert districts. Hence most of the frogs\r\nwhich inhabit such regions have had to find out or invent some\r\ningenious plan for passing through the tadpole stage with a minimum of\r\nmoisture. The devices they have hit upon are very curious. Some of\r\nthem make use of the little pools collected at the bases of huge\r\ntropical leaf-stalks, like those of the banana plant; others dispense\r\nwith the aid of water altogether, and glue their new-laid eggs to\r\ntheir own backs, where the fry pass through the tadpole stage with the\r\nslimy mucus which surrounds them. Nature always discovers such cunning\r\nschemes to get over apparent difficulties in her way: and the\r\ntree-frogs have solved the problem for themselves in half a dozen\r\nmanners in different localities. Oddest of all, perhaps, is the dodge\r\ninvented by \"Darwin's frog,\" a Chilean species, in which the male\r\nswallows the eggs as soon as laid, and gulps them into the\r\nthroat-pouch beneath his capacious neck: there they hatch out and pass\r\nthrough their tadpole stage: and when at last they arrive at frogly\r\nmaturity, they escape into the world through the mouth of their\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 8. THE SURINAM TOAD.]\r\n\r\nThe Surinam toad, represented in No. 8, is also the possessor of one\r\nof the strangest nurseries known to science. It lives in the dense\r\ntropical forests of Guiana and Brazil, and is a true water-haunter.\r\nBut at the breeding season the female undergoes a curious change of\r\nintegument. The skin on her back grows pulpy, soft, and jelly-like.\r\nShe lays her eggs in the water: but as soon as she has laid them, her\r\nlord and master plasters them on to her impressionable back with his\r\nfeet, so as to secure them from all assaults of enemies. Every egg is\r\npressed separately into a bed of the soft skin, which soon closes over\r\nit automatically, thus burying each in a little cell or niche, where\r\nit undergoes its further development. The tadpoles pass through their\r\nlarval stage within the cell, and then hop out, in the four-legged\r\ncondition. As soon as they have gone off to shift for themselves, the\r\nmother toad finds herself with a ragged and honeycombed skin, which\r\nmust be very uncomfortable. So she rubs the remnant of it off against\r\nstones or the bark of trees, and re-develops a similar back afresh at\r\nthe next breeding season.\r\n\r\nAlmost never do we find a device in nature which occurs once only. The\r\nunique hardly exists: nature is a great copyist. At least two animals\r\nof wholly unlike kinds are all but sure to hit independently upon the\r\nself-same mechanism. So it is not surprising to learn that a cat-fish\r\nhas invented an exactly similar mode of carrying its young to that\r\nadopted by the Surinam toad: only, here it is on the under surface,\r\nnot the upper one, that the spawn is plastered. The eggs of this\r\ncat-fish, whose scientific name is Aspredo, are pressed into the skin\r\nbelow the body, and so borne about by the mother till they hatch. This\r\nis the second instance of which I spoke above, where the female fish\r\nherself assumes the care of her offspring, instead of leaving it\r\nentirely to her excellent partner.\r\n\r\nHigher up in the scale of life we get many instances which show\r\nvarious stages in the same progressive development towards greater\r\ncare for the safety and education of the young. Among the larger\r\nlizards, for example, a distinct advance may be traced between the\r\ncomparatively uncivilized American alligator and his near ally, the\r\nmuch more cultivated African crocodile. On the banks of the\r\nMississippi, the alligator lays a hundred eggs or thereabouts, which\r\nshe deposits in a nest near the water's edge, and then covers them up\r\nwith leaves and other decaying vegetable matter. The fermentation of\r\nthese leaves produces heat and so does for the alligator's eggs what\r\nsitting does for those of hens and other birds: the mother deputes her\r\nmaternal functions, so to speak, to a festering heap of decomposing\r\nplant-refuse. Nevertheless, she loiters about all the time, like\r\nMiriam round the ark which contained Moses, to see what happens; and\r\nwhen the eggs hatch out, she leads her little ones down to the river,\r\nand there makes alligators of them. This is a simple and relatively\r\nlow stage in the nursery arrangements of the big lizards.\r\n\r\nThe African crocodile, on the other hand, goes a stage higher. It lays\r\nonly about thirty eggs, but these it buries in warm sand, and then\r\nlies on top of them at night, both to protect them from attack and to\r\nkeep them warm during the cooler hours. In short, it sits upon them.\r\nWhen the young crocodiles within the eggs are ready to hatch, they\r\nutter an acute cry. The mother then digs down to the eggs, and lays\r\nthem freely on the surface, so that the little reptiles may have space\r\nto work their way out unimpeded. This they do by biting at the shell\r\nwith a specially developed tooth; at the end of two hours' nibbling\r\nthey are free, and are led down to the water by their affectionate\r\nparent. In these two cases we see the beginnings of the instinct of\r\nhatching, which in birds, the next in order in the scale of being, has\r\nbecome almost universal.\r\n\r\nI say _almost_ universal, because even among birds there are a few\r\nkinds which have not to this day progressed beyond the alligator\r\nlevel. Australia is the happy hunting-ground of the zooelogist in\r\nsearch of antiquated forms, elsewhere extinct, and several Australian\r\nbirds, such as the brush-turkeys, still treat their eggs essentially\r\non the alligator method. The cock birds heap up huge mounds of earth\r\nand decaying vegetable matter, as much as would represent several\r\ncartloads of mould; and in this natural hot-bed the hens lay their\r\neggs, burying each separately with a good stock of leaves around it.\r\nThe heat of the sun and the fermenting mould hatch them out between\r\nthem; to expedite the process, the birds uncover the eggs during the\r\nwarmer part of the day, expose them to the sun, and bury them again in\r\nthe hot-beds towards evening. Several intermediate steps may also be\r\nfound between this early stage of communal nesting by proxy and the\r\ntrue hatching instinct; a good one is supplied by the ostrich, which\r\npartially buries its eggs in hot sand, but sits on them at intervals,\r\nboth father and mother birds taking shares by turn in the duties of\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nThe vast subject which I have thus lightly skimmed is not without\r\ninterest, again, from its human implications. Savages as a rule\r\nproduce enormous families; but then, the infant mortality in savage\r\ntribes is proportionally great. Among civilized races, families are\r\nsmaller, and deaths in infancy are far less numerous. The higher the\r\nclass or the natural grade of a stock, the larger as a rule the\r\nproportion of children safely reared to the adult age. The goal\r\ntowards which humanity is slowly moving would thus seem to be one\r\nwhere families in most cases will be relatively small--perhaps not\r\nmore on an average than three to a household--but where most or all of\r\nthe children brought into the world will be safely reared to full\r\nmaturity. This is already becoming the rule in certain favored ranks\r\nof European society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TADPOLES AND YOUNG FROG.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS SPEND THE WINTER\r\n\r\n(FROM GLEANINGS FROM NATURE.)[2]\r\n\r\nBY W. S. BLATCHLEY.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Popular Science Monthly,\" February, 1897. Copyright by William\r\nStanley Blatchley, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COCOON.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest problems which each of the living forms about us\r\nhas had to solve, during the years of its existence on earth, is how\r\nbest to perpetuate its kind during that cold season which once each\r\nyear, in our temperate zone, is bound to come. Many are the solutions\r\nto this problem. Each form of life has, as it were, solved it best to\r\nsuit its own peculiar case, and to the earnest student of Nature there\r\nis nothing more interesting than to pry into these solutions and note\r\nhow varied, strange, and wonderful they are.\r\n\r\nTo fully appreciate some of the facts mentioned below it must be borne\r\nin mind that there is no such thing as \"spontaneous generation\" of\r\nlife. Every cell is the offspring of a pre-existing cell. Nothing but\r\na living thing can produce a living thing. Hence every weed that next\r\nseason will spring up and provoke the farmer's ire, and every insect\r\nwhich will then make life almost intolerable for man or beast, exists\r\nthroughout the winter in some form....\r\n\r\nBeginning with the earth-worms and their kindred, we find that at the\r\napproach of winter they burrow deep down where the icy breath of the\r\nfrost never reaches, and there they live, during the cold season, a\r\nlife of comparative quiet. That they are exceedingly sensitive to\r\nwarmth, however, may be proven by the fact that when a warm rain comes\r\nsome night in February or March, thawing out the crust of the earth,\r\nthe next morning reveals in our dooryards the mouths of hundreds of\r\nthe pits or burrows of these primitive tillers of the soil, each\r\nsurrounded by a little pile of pellets, the castings of the active\r\nartisans of the pits during the night before.\r\n\r\nIf we will get up before dawn on such a morning we can find the worms\r\ncrawling actively about over the surface of the ground, but when the\r\nfirst signs of day appear they seek once more their protective\r\nburrows, and only an occasional belated individual serves as a\r\nbreakfast for the early birds.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of these lowly creatures are not visible, and consist of\r\nsingle special cells scattered among the epidermal cells of the skin,\r\nand connected by means of a sensory nerve fibre with a little bunch of\r\nnervous matter in the body. Such a simple visual apparatus serves them\r\nonly in distinguishing light from darkness, but this to them is most\r\nimportant knowledge, as it enables them to avoid the surface of the\r\nearth by day, when their worst enemies, the birds, are in active\r\nsearch for them.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water mussels and snails and the crayfish burrow deep into\r\nthe mud and silt at the bottom of ponds and streams where they lie\r\nmotionless during the winter. The land snails, in late autumn, crawl\r\nbeneath logs, and, burrowing deep into the soft mould, they withdraw\r\nfar into their shells. Then each one forms with a mucous secretion two\r\nthin transparent membranes, one across the opening of the shell and\r\none a little farther within, thus making the interior of the shell\r\nperfectly air-tight. There for five or six months he sleeps, free from\r\nthe pangs of hunger and the blasts of winter, and when the balmy\r\nbreezes of spring blow up from the south he breaks down and devours\r\nthe protecting membrane and goes forth with his home on his back to\r\nseek fresh leaves for food and to find for himself a mate.\r\n\r\nNext in the scale come the insects, which comprise four-fifths of all\r\nexisting animals, and each one of the mighty horde seen in summer has\r\npassed the winter in some form. One must look for them in strange\r\nplaces and under many disguises; for they cannot migrate, as do the\r\nmajority of the birds, nor can they live an active life while the\r\nsource of their food supply, the plants, are inactive.\r\n\r\nThe majority of those insects which in May or June will be found\r\nfeeding on the buds or leaves of our trees, or crawling worm-like over\r\nthe grass of our lawns, or burrowing beneath the roots of our garden\r\nplants, are represented in the winter by the eggs alone. These eggs\r\nare deposited in autumn by the mother insect, on or near the object\r\ndestined to furnish the young, or larvae, their food. Each egg\r\ncorresponds to a seed of one of our annual plants; being, like it,\r\nbut a form of life so fashioned and fitted as to withstand for a long\r\nperiod intense cold; the mother insect, like the summer form of the\r\nplant, succumbing to the first severe frost.\r\n\r\nThus myriads of the eggs of grasshoppers are in the early autumn\r\ndeposited in the ground, in compact masses of forty to sixty each.\r\nAbout mid-April they begin to hatch, and the sprightly little insects,\r\ndevoid of wings, but otherwise like their parents, begin their\r\nlife-work of changing grass into flesh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEDGEHOG CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\nA comparatively small number of insects pass the winter in the larval\r\nor active stage of the young. Of these, perhaps the best known is the\r\nbrown \"woolly worm\" or \"hedgehog caterpillar,\" as it is familiarly\r\ncalled. It is thickly covered with stiff black hairs on each end, and\r\nwith reddish hairs on the middle of the body. These hairs appear to be\r\nevenly and closely shorn, so as to give the animal a velvety look; and\r\nas they have a certain degree of elasticity, and the caterpillar curls\r\nup at the slightest touch, it generally manages to slip away when\r\ntaken into the hand. Beneath loose bark, boards, rails, and stones,\r\nthis caterpillar may be found in mid-winter, coiled up and apparently\r\nlifeless. On the first bright, sunny days of spring it may be seen\r\ncrawling rapidly over the ground, seeking the earnest vegetation which\r\nwill furnish it a literal \"breakfast.\" In April or May the chrysalis,\r\nsurrounded by a loose cocoon formed of the hairs of the body\r\ninterwoven with coarse silk, may be found in situations similar to\r\nthose in which the larva passed the winter. From this, the perfect\r\ninsect, the Isabella tiger moth, _Pyrrharctia isabella_ Smith, emerges\r\nabout the last of June. It is a medium sized moth, dull orange in\r\ncolor, with three rows of small black spots on the body, and some\r\nscattered spots of the same color on the wings.\r\n\r\nBy breaking open rotten logs one can find in mid-winter the grubs or\r\nlarvae of many of the wood-boring beetles, and, beneath logs and stones\r\nnear the margins of ponds and brooks, hordes of the maggots or larvae\r\nof certain kinds of flies may often be found huddled together in great\r\nmasses. The larvae of a few butterflies also live over winter beneath\r\nchips or bunches of leaves near the roots of their food plant, or in\r\nwebs of their own construction, which are woven on the stems close to\r\nthe buds, whose expanding leaves will furnish them their first meal in\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nMany insects pass the winter in the quiescent or pupal stage; a state\r\nexceedingly well fitted for hibernating, requiring as it does, no\r\nfood, and giving plenty of time for the marvellous changes which are\r\nthen undergone. Some of these pupae are enclosed in dense silken\r\ncocoons, which are bound to the twigs of the plants upon which the\r\nlarvae feed, and thus they swing securely in their silken hammocks\r\nthrough all the storms of winter. Perhaps the most common of these is\r\nthat of the brown Cecropian moth, _Attacus cecropia_ L., the large\r\noval cocoon of which is a conspicuous object in the winter on the\r\ntwigs of our common shade and fruit trees. Many other pupae may be\r\nfound beneath logs or on the under side of bark, and usually have the\r\nchrysalis surrounded by a thin covering of hairs, which are rather\r\nloosely arranged. A number pass the cold season in the earth with no\r\nprotective covering whatever. Among these is a large brown chrysalis\r\nwith a long tongue case bent over so as to resemble the handle of a\r\njug. Every farm boy has ploughed or spaded it up in the spring, and is\r\nit but the pupa of a large sphinx moth, _Protoparce celeus_ Hub., the\r\nlarva of which is the great green worm, with a \"horn on its tail,\" so\r\ncommon on tomato plants in the late summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRYSALIS OF TOMATO WORM.]\r\n\r\nEach of the winter forms of insects above mentioned can withstand long\r\nand severe cold weather--in fact, may be frozen solid for weeks and\r\nretain life and vigor, both of which are shown when warm weather and\r\nfood appear again. Indeed, it is not an unusually cold winter, but one\r\nof successive thawings and freezings, which is most destructive to\r\ninsect life. A mild winter encourages the growth of mould which\r\nattacks the hibernating larvae and pupae as soon as, from excess of rain\r\nor humidity, they become sickly; and it also permits the continued\r\nactivity of insectivorous mammals and birds. Thus, moles, shrews,\r\nand field mice, instead of burying themselves deeply in the ground,\r\nrun about freely during an open winter and destroy enormous numbers\r\nof pupae; while such birds as the woodpeckers, titmice, and chickadees\r\nare constantly on the alert, and searching in every crevice and cranny\r\nof fence and bark of tree for the hibernating larvae.\r\n\r\nOf the creeping, wingless creatures, which can ever be found beneath\r\nrocks, rails, chunks, and especially beneath those old decaying logs\r\nwhich are half buried in the rich vegetable mould, the myriapods, or\r\n\"thousand-legs,\" deserve more than a passing notice. They are typical\r\nexamples of that great branch of the animal kingdom known as\r\n_arthropods_, which comprises all insects and crustaceans. Each\r\narthropod has the body composed of rings placed end to end and bearing\r\njointed appendages, and in the myriapods each ring and its appendages\r\ncan be plainly seen; whereas in the higher forms of the branch many of\r\nthe rings are so combined as to be very difficult to distinguish.\r\n\r\nFull forty kinds of myriapods occur in any area comprising one hundred\r\nsquare miles in the eastern United States. About twenty-five of them\r\ngo by the general name of \"thousand-legs\" or millipedes, as each has\r\nfrom forty to fifty-five cylindrical rings in the body, and two pairs\r\nof legs to each ring. The other fifteen belong to the \"centipede\"\r\ngroup, the body consisting of about sixteen flattened segments, or\r\nrings, each bearing a single pair of legs. When disturbed, the\r\n\"thousand-legs\" generally coils up and remains motionless, shamming\r\ndeath, or \"playing possum,\" as it is popularly put, as a means of\r\ndefence; while the centipede scampers hurriedly away and endeavors to\r\nhide beneath leaf, chip, or other object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTIPEDE.]\r\n\r\nAll those found in the Northern States are perfectly harmless, the\r\ntrue centipede, whose bite is reputed much more venomous than it\r\nreally is, being found only in the South. True, some of the centipede\r\ngroup can pinch rather sharply with their beetle-like jaws; and one,\r\nour largest and most common species, a brownish red fellow about three\r\ninches long and without eyes, can even draw blood if its jaws happen\r\nto strike a tender place. When handled it always tries to bite,\r\nperhaps out of revenge for the abominably long Latin name given it by\r\nits describer. In fact the name is longer than the animal\r\nitself--_Sco-lo-po-cryp-tops sex-spi-no-sus_ (Say)--being its cognomen\r\nin full. With such a handle attached to it, who can blame it for\r\nattempting to bite? Yet, to the scientist up on his Latin, each part\r\nof the above name bears a definite and tangible meaning. All the\r\nmyriapods found in the woods and fields feed upon decaying vegetation,\r\nsuch as leaves, stems of weeds, and rotten wood, and in winter three\r\nor four species can usually be found within or beneath every decaying\r\nlog or stump. One species with very long legs, _Scutigera forceps_\r\n(Raf.), is often found in damp houses or in cellars. It is sometimes\r\ncalled the \"wall-sweeper,\" on account of its rapid ungainly gait, and\r\nis even reputed to prey upon cockroaches and other household pests.\r\n\r\nSpiders, which do not undergo such changes as do most of the common,\r\nsix-footed insects, winter either as eggs or in the mature form. The\r\nmembers of the \"sedentary\" or web-spinning group, as a rule, form\r\nnests in late autumn, in each of which are deposited from fifty to\r\neighty eggs, which survive the winter and hatch in the spring, as soon\r\nas the food supply of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes appear. The\r\ndifferent forms of spiders' nests are very interesting objects of\r\nstudy. Some are those close-spun, flat, button-shaped objects, about\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, which are so common in winter on the under\r\nside of bark, chunks and flat rocks. Others are balloon-shaped and\r\nattached to weeds. Within the latter the young spiders often hatch in\r\nearly winter, make their first meal off their empty egg cases, and\r\nthen begin a struggle for existence, the stronger preying upon the\r\nweaker until the south winds blow again, when they emerge and scatter\r\nfar and wide in search of more nutritious sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe \"wandering\" spiders never spin webs, but run actively about and\r\npounce upon their prey with a tiger-like spring. Six or eight of the\r\nlarger species of this group winter in the mature form beneath logs\r\nand chunks, being often frozen solid during cold weather, but thawing\r\nout as healthy as ever when the temperature rises. Retiring beneath\r\nthe loose-fitting bark of hickory or maple trees, a number of the\r\nsmaller tube-weaving spiders construct about themselves a protecting\r\nweb of many layers of the finest silk. Within this snug retreat they\r\nlie from November until April--a handsome, small, black fellow, with\r\ngreen jaws and two orange spots on his abdomen, being the most common\r\nspecies found motionless within this seeming shroud of silk on a day\r\nin mid-winter.\r\n\r\nIn any Northern State as many as four hundred different kinds of the\r\nsix-footed or true insects, in the winged or adult stage, may be taken\r\nin winter by any one who is so disposed, and knows where to search for\r\nthem. Among the _Orthoptera_, the \"grouse grasshoppers\" live during\r\nthe cold season beneath the loose bark of logs, or beneath the bottom\r\nrails of the old Virginia worm fences. From these retreats every warm,\r\nsunny day tempts them forth in numbers. On such occasions the earth\r\nseems to swarm with them, as they leap before the intruder, their hard\r\nbodies striking the dead leaves with a sound similar to that produced\r\nby falling hail. The common field cricket belongs also to the\r\n_Orthoptera_, and the young of various sizes winter under rails and\r\nlogs, bidding defiance to Jack Frost from within a little burrow or\r\npit beneath the protecting shelter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINCH BUG.]\r\n\r\nThe true bugs, or _Hemiptera_, hibernate in similar places; squash\r\nbugs, chinch bugs, \"stink\" bugs, and others being easily found in\r\nnumbers beneath loose bark or hidden between the root leaves of\r\nmullein and other plants.\r\n\r\nNearly three hundred species of _Coleoptera_, or beetles, occupy\r\nsimilar positions. Almost any rotten log or stump when broken open\r\ndiscloses a half dozen or more \"horn\" or \"bess beetles,\" _Passalus\r\ncornutus_ L., great, shining, clumsy, black fellows with a curved horn\r\non the head. They are often utilized as horses by country children,\r\nthe horn furnishing an inviting projection to which may be fastened,\r\nby a thread or cord, chips and pieces of bark to be dragged about by\r\nthe strong and never lagging beast of burden. When tired of \"playing\r\nhorse\" they can make of the insect an instrument of music; for, when\r\nheld by the body, it emits a creaking, hissing noise, produced by\r\nrubbing the abdomen up and down against the inside of the hard, horny\r\nwing covers. This beetle passes its entire life in cavities in the\r\nrotten wood on which it feeds, and when it wishes a larger or more\r\ncommodious home it has only to eat the more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRTEEN-SPOTTED LADY BEETLE.]\r\n\r\nThe handsome and beneficial lady beetles winter beneath fallen leaves\r\nor between and beneath the root leaves of the mullein and the thistle.\r\nOur most common species, the thirteen-spotted lady beetle, _Megilla\r\nmaculata_ De G., is gregarious, collecting together by thousands on\r\nthe approach of cold weather, and lying huddled up like sheep until a\r\nbreath of spring gives them the signal to disperse. Snout beetles\r\ngalore can be found beneath piles of weeds near streams and the\r\nborders of ponds or beneath chunks and logs in sandy places. All are\r\ninjurious, and the farmer by burning their hibernating places in\r\nwinter can cause their destruction in numbers. Rove beetles, ground\r\nbeetles, and many others live deep down in the vegetable mould beneath\r\nold logs, where they are, no doubt, as secure from the ice king as if\r\nthey followed the swallow to the tropics.\r\n\r\nOf the _Diptera_, or flies, but few forms winter in the perfect state,\r\nyet the myriads of house flies and their kin, which next summer will\r\ndistract the busy house-wife, are represented in winter by a few\r\nisolated individuals which creep forth occasionally from crevice or\r\ncranny and greet us with a friendly buzz.\r\n\r\nIn mid-winter one may also see in the air swarms of small, gnat-like\r\ninsects. They belong to this order and live beneath the bark of\r\nfreshly fallen beech and other logs. On warm, sunny days they go forth\r\nin numbers for a sort of rhythmical courtship; their movements while\r\nin the air being peculiar in that they usually rise and fall in the\r\nsame vertical line--performing a curious aerial dance which is long\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nAmong the dozen or more butterflies and moths which winter in the\r\nperfect state, the most common and the most handsome is the\r\n\"Camberwell beauty\" or \"mourning cloak,\" _Vanessa antiopa_ L., a large\r\nbutterfly whose wings are a rich purplish brown above, duller beneath,\r\nand broadly margined with a yellowish band. It is often found in\r\nwinter beneath chunks which are raised a short distance above the\r\nground, or in the crevices of old snags and fence rails. It is then\r\napparently lifeless, with the antennae resting close along the back,\r\nabove which the wings are folded. But one or two warm days are\r\nnecessary to restore it to activity, and I have seen it on the wing as\r\nearly as the 2d of March, hovering over the open flowers of the little\r\nsnow trillium.\r\n\r\nAll the species of ants survive the winter as mature forms, either in\r\ntheir nests in the ground or huddled groups in half rotten logs and\r\nstumps; while here and there beneath logs a solitary queen bumble-bee,\r\nbald hornet, or yellow jacket is found--the sole representatives of\r\ntheir races.\r\n\r\nThus insects survive the winter in many ways and in many places, some\r\nas eggs, others as larvae, still others as pupae, and a large number as\r\nadults--all being able to withstand severe cold and yet retain\r\nvitality sufficient to recover, live, grow, and replenish the earth\r\nwith their progeny when the halcyon days of spring appear once more.\r\n\r\nIn the scale of animal life the vertebrates or back-boned animals\r\nsucceed the insects. Beginning with the fishes, we find that in late\r\nautumn they mostly seek some deep pool in pond or stream at the bottom\r\nof which the water does not freeze. Here the herbivorous forms eke out\r\na precarious existence by feeding upon the innumerable diatoms and\r\nother small plants which are always to be found in water, while the\r\ncarnivorous prey upon the herbivorous, and so maintain the struggle\r\nfor existence. The moving to these deeper channels and pools in autumn\r\nand the scattering in the spring of the assembly which has gathered\r\nthere constitute the so-called \"migration of fishes,\" which is far\r\nfrom being so extensive and methodical as that practiced by the\r\nmigratory birds.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller species of fishes, upon leaving these winter\r\nresorts, ascend small, clear brooks in large numbers for the purpose\r\nof depositing their eggs; as, when hatched in such a place, the young\r\nwill be comparatively free from the attacks of the larger carnivorous\r\nforms. Among the lowest vertebrate often found in numbers in early\r\nspring in these meadow rills and brooks is the lamprey, _Ammocoetes\r\nbranchialis_ (L.), or \"lamper eel,\" as it is sometimes called. It has\r\na slender eel-like body, of a uniform leaden or blackish color, and\r\nwith seven purse-shaped gill openings on each side. The mouth is\r\nfitted for sucking rather than biting, and with it they attach\r\nthemselves to the bodies of fishes and feed on their flesh, which they\r\nscrape off with their rasp-like teeth. Later in the season they\r\ndisappear from these smaller streams, probably returning in midsummer\r\nto deeper water. Thoreau, who studied their habits closely, says of\r\nthem: \"They are rarely seen on their way down stream, and it is\r\nthought by fishermen that they never return, but waste away and die,\r\nclinging to rocks and stumps of trees for an indefinite period; a\r\ntragic feature to the scenery of the river bottoms worthy to be\r\nremembered with Shakespeare's description of the sea floor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LAMPREY.]\r\n\r\nA few of the fishes, as the mud minnow and smaller catfishes,\r\ntogether with most frogs, turtles, and salamanders, on the approach of\r\nwinter, burrow into the mud at the bottom of the streams and ponds, or\r\nbeneath logs near their margins. There they live without moving about\r\nand with all the vital processes in a partially dormant condition,\r\nthus needing little if any food.\r\n\r\nThe box tortoise or \"dry land terrapin,\" the common toad, and some\r\nsalamanders burrow into the dry earth, usually going deep enough to\r\nescape frost; while snakes seek some crevice in the rocks or hole in\r\nthe ground where they coil themselves together, oftentimes in vast\r\nnumbers, and prepare for their winter's sleep. In an open winter this\r\nhibernation is often interrupted, the animal emerging from its retreat\r\nand seeking its usual summer haunts as though spring had come again.\r\nThus I have, on one occasion, seen a soft-shelled turtle moving\r\ngracefully over the bottom of a stream on a day in late December, and\r\nhave in mid-January captured snakes and salamanders from beneath a\r\npile of drift-wood, where they had taken temporary refuge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURTLE.]\r\n\r\nWith frogs, especially, this hibernation is not a perfect one, and\r\nthere is a doubt if in a mild winter some species hibernate at all.\r\nFor example, the little cricket frog or \"peeper\" has been seen many\r\ntimes in mid-winter alongside the banks of flowing streams, and during\r\nthe open winter of 1888-89 numerous specimens of leopard and green\r\nfrogs were seen on different occasions in December and January, while\r\non February 18th they, together with the \"peepers,\" were in full\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\nOf our mammals, a few of the rodents or gnawers, as the ground-hogs,\r\ngophers and chipmunks, hibernate in burrows deep enough to escape the\r\ncold, and either feed on a stored supply of food, or, like the snakes\r\nand crayfish, do not feed at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIPMUNK.]\r\n\r\nOthers, as the rabbits, field-mice, and squirrels, are more or less\r\nactive and forage freely on whatever they can find, eating many things\r\nwhich in summer they would spurn with scorn. To this class belongs\r\nthat intelligent but injurious animal the musquash or muskrat. Those\r\nwhich inhabit the rivers and larger streams live in burrows dug deep\r\nbeneath the banks, but those inhabiting sluggish streams and ponds\r\nusually construct a conical winter house about three feet in diameter\r\nand from two to three feet in height. These houses are made of coarse\r\ngrasses, rushes, branches of shrubs, and small pieces of driftwood,\r\nclosely cemented together with stiff, clayey mud. The top of the house\r\nusually projects two feet or more above the water, and when sun-dried\r\nis so strong as to easily sustain the weight of a man. The walls are\r\ngenerally about six inches in thickness and are very difficult to pull\r\nto pieces. Within is a single circular chamber with a shelf or floor\r\nof mud, sticks, leaves and grass, ingeniously supported on coarse\r\nsticks stuck endwise into the mud after the manner of piles. In the\r\ncentre of this floor is an opening, from which six or eight diverging\r\npaths lead to the open water without, so that the little artisan has\r\nmany avenues of escape in case of danger. These houses are often\r\nrepaired and used for several winters in succession, but are vacated\r\non the approach of spring. During the summer the muskrat is, in the\r\nmain, a herbivorous animal, but in winter necessity develops its\r\ncarnivorous propensities and it feeds then mainly upon the mussels and\r\ncrayfish which it can dig from the bottom of the pond or stream in\r\nwhich its house is built.\r\n\r\nThe bats pass the winter in caves, the attics of houses, and barns, or\r\nin hollow trees, hanging downward by their hind claws. Motionless for\r\nmonths they thus remain, and those in the more exposed situations are,\r\ndoubtless, frozen solid. Yet, in time, their blood flows freely once\r\nagain and they become as expert on the wing as though the year were\r\none continual jubilee of insect chasing, and frost and snow were to\r\nthem unknown.\r\n\r\nAll the carnivora, or flesh-eaters, as the mink, skunk, opossum, fox,\r\nand wolf, are in winter active and voracious, needing much food to\r\nsupply the necessary animal heat of the body. Hence they are then much\r\nmore bold than in summer, and the hen yard or sheep pen of the farmer\r\nis too frequently called upon to supply this extra demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WOLF.]\r\n\r\nBut of all our animals it seems to me the birds have solved the winter\r\nproblem best. Possessing an enduring power of flight and a knowledge\r\nof a southern sunny sky, beneath which food is plentiful, they alone\r\nof all the living forms about us have little fear of the coming of the\r\nfrost. True, fifty or more species remain in each of the Northern\r\nStates during the cold season, but they are hardy birds which feed\r\nmainly upon seeds, as the snow-bird and song sparrow; on flesh, as the\r\nhawks and crows; or on burrowing insects, as the nut-hatches and\r\nwoodpeckers.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the solutions to the problem of life in winter which\r\nthe plants and animals about us have worked out; such some of the\r\nforms which they undergo; the places which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nTo the thinking mind a knowledge of these solutions but begets other\r\nand greater problems, such as how can a living thing be frozen solid\r\nfor weeks and yet retain vitality enough to fully recover? How can a\r\nwarm-blooded animal sleep for months without partaking of food or\r\ndrink? And greater than either, what is that which we call life?\r\n\r\nI hold in my hand two objects, similar in size, color, organs,\r\neverything--twins from the same mother in all outward respects. One\r\npulsates and throbs with that which we call \"life.\" It possesses heat,\r\nbodily motion, animal power. The other is cold, motionless, pulseless,\r\nthrobless--a thing of clay. What is that \"life\" which the one\r\npossesses and the other lacks? Ah, there's the rub! With the wisest of\r\nmen we can only answer, \"_Quien sabe?_\" (Who knows?)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER HOUSE OF MUSKRAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS' NESTS\r\n\r\n(FROM WAKE ROBIN.)[3]\r\n\r\nBY JOHN BURROUGHS.\r\n\r\n[3] Copyright by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow alert and vigilant the birds are, even when absorbed in building\r\ntheir nests! In an open space in the woods, I see a pair of\r\ncedar-birds collecting moss from the top of a dead tree. Following the\r\ndirection in which they fly, I soon discover the nest placed in the\r\nfork of a small soft-maple, which stands amid a thick growth of\r\nwild-cherry trees and young beeches. Carefully concealing myself\r\nbeneath it, without any fear that the workmen will hit me with a chip\r\nor let fall a tool, I await the return of the busy pair. Presently I\r\nhear the well-known note, and the female sweeps down and settles\r\nunsuspectingly into the half-finished structure. Hardly have her wings\r\nrested, before her eye has penetrated my screen, and with a hurried\r\nmovement of alarm, she darts away. In a moment, the male, with a tuft\r\nof wool in his beak (for there is a sheep pasture near), joins her,\r\nand the two reconnoitre the premises from the surrounding bushes. With\r\ntheir beaks still loaded, they move around with a frightened look, and\r\nrefuse to approach the nest till I have moved off and lain down behind\r\na log. Then one of them ventures to alight upon the nest, but, still\r\nsuspecting all is not right, quickly darts away again. Then they both\r\ntogether come, and after much peeping and spying about, and apparently\r\nmuch anxious consultation, cautiously proceed to work. In less than\r\nhalf an hour, it would seem that wool enough has been brought to\r\nsupply the whole family, real and prospective, with socks, if needles\r\nand fingers could be found fine enough to knit it up. In less than a\r\nweek, the female has begun to deposit her eggs,--four of them in as\r\nmany days,--white tinged with purple, with black spots on the larger\r\nend. After two weeks of incubation, the young are out.\r\n\r\nExcepting the American goldfinch, this bird builds later in the spring\r\nthan any other, its nest, in our northern climate, seldom being\r\nundertaken till July. As with the goldfinch, the reason is, probably,\r\nthat suitable food for the young cannot be had at an earlier period.\r\n\r\nLike most of our common species, as the robin, sparrow, bluebird,\r\npewee, wren, etc., this bird sometimes seeks wild, remote localities\r\nin which to rear its young; at others, takes up its abode near that of\r\nman. I knew a pair of cedar-birds, one season, to build in an\r\napple-tree, the branches of which rubbed against the house. For a day\r\nor two before the first straw was laid, I noticed the pair carefully\r\nexploring every branch of the tree the female taking the lead, the\r\nmale following her with an anxious note and look. It was evident that\r\nthe wife was to have her choice this time; and, like one who\r\nthoroughly knew her mind, she was proceeding to take it. Finally the\r\nsite was chosen upon a high branch extending over one low wing of the\r\nhouse. Mutual congratulations and caresses followed, when both birds\r\nflew away in quest of building material. That most freely used is a\r\nsort of cotton-bearing plant, which grows in old, worn-out fields. The\r\nnest is large for the size of the bird, and very soft. It is in every\r\nrespect a first-class domicile.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, while walking, or rather sauntering, in the woods\r\n(for I have discovered that one cannot run and read the book of\r\nnature), my attention was arrested by a dull hammering, evidently but\r\na few rods off. I said to myself, \"Some one is building a house.\" From\r\nwhat I had previously seen, I suspected the builder to be a red-headed\r\nwoodpecker, in the top of a dead oak stub near by. Moving cautiously\r\nin that direction, I perceived a round hole, about the size of that\r\nmade by an inch-and-a-half auger, near the top of the decayed trunk,\r\nand the white chips of the workman strewing the ground beneath. When\r\nbut a few paces from the tree, my foot pressed upon a dry twig, which\r\ngave forth a very slight snap. Instantly the hammering ceased, and a\r\nscarlet head appeared at the door. Though I remained perfectly\r\nmotionless, forbearing even to wink till my eye smarted, the bird\r\nrefused to go on with his work, but flew quietly off to a neighboring\r\ntree. What surprised me was, that amid his busy occupation down in\r\nthe heart of the old tree he should have been so alert and watchful as\r\nto catch the slightest sound from without.\r\n\r\nThe woodpeckers all build in about the same manner, excavating the\r\ntrunk or branch of a decayed tree, and depositing the eggs on the fine\r\nfragments of wood at the bottom of the cavity. Though the nest is not\r\nespecially an artistic work,--requiring strength rather than\r\nskill,--yet the eggs and the young of few other birds are so\r\ncompletely housed from the elements, or protected from their natural\r\nenemies--the jays, crows, hawks, and owls. A tree with a natural\r\ncavity is never selected, but one which has been dead just long enough\r\nto have become soft and brittle throughout. The bird goes in\r\nhorizontally for a few inches, making a hole perfectly round and\r\nsmooth and adapted to his size; then turns downward, gradually\r\nenlarging the hole, as he proceeds, to the depth of ten, fifteen,\r\ntwenty inches, according to the softness of the tree and the urgency\r\nof the mother bird to deposit her eggs. While excavating, male and\r\nfemale work alternately. After one has been engaged fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, drilling, and carrying out chips, it ascends to an upper\r\nlimb, utters a loud call or two, when its mate soon appears, and,\r\nalighting near it on the branch, the pair chatter and caress a moment;\r\nthen the fresh one enters the cavity and the other flies away.\r\n\r\nA few days since, I climbed up to the nest of the downy woodpecker, in\r\nthe decayed top of a sugar-maple. For better protection against\r\ndriving rains, the hole which was rather more than an inch in\r\ndiameter, was made immediately beneath a branch which stretched out\r\nalmost horizontally from the main stem. It appeared merely a deeper\r\nshadow upon the dark and mottled surface of the bark with which the\r\nbranches were covered, and could not be detected by the eye until one\r\nwas within a few feet of it. The young chirped vociferously as I\r\napproached the nest, thinking it was the old one with food; but the\r\nclamor suddenly ceased as I put my hand on that part of the trunk in\r\nwhich they were concealed, the unusual jarring and rustling alarming\r\nthem into silence. The cavity, which was about fifteen inches deep,\r\nwas gourd-shaped, and was wrought with great skill and regularity. The\r\nwalls were quite smooth and clean and new.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODPECKER'S NEST. (Dotted lines indicate inside of\r\nnest and eggs).]\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the circumstance of observing a pair of\r\nyellow-bellied woodpeckers,--the most rare and secluded, and, next to\r\nthe red-headed, the most beautiful species found in our\r\nwoods,--breeding in an old, truncated beech in the Beaverkill\r\nMountains, an off-shoot of the Catskills. We had been travelling,\r\nthree of us, all day in search of a trout lake, which lay far in among\r\nthe mountains, had twice lost our course in the trackless forest,\r\nand, weary and hungry, had sat down to rest upon a decayed log. The\r\nchattering of the young, and the passing to and fro of the parent\r\nbirds, soon arrested my attention. The entrance to the nest was on the\r\neast side of the tree, about twenty-five feet from the ground. At\r\nintervals of scarcely a minute, the old birds, one after another,\r\nwould light upon the edge of the hole with a grub or worm in their\r\nbeaks; then each in turn would make a bow or two, cast an eye quickly\r\naround, and by a single movement place itself in the neck of the\r\npassage. Here it would pause a moment, as if to determine in which\r\nexpectant mouth to place the morsel, and then disappear within. In\r\nabout half a minute, during which time the chattering of the young\r\ngradually subsided, the bird would again emerge, but this time bearing\r\nin its beak the ordure of one of the helpless family. Flying away very\r\nslowly with head lowered and extended, as if anxious to hold the\r\noffensive object as far from its plumage as possible, the bird dropped\r\nthe unsavory morsel in the course of a few yards, and, alighting on a\r\ntree, wiped its bill on the bark and moss. This seemed to be the order\r\nall day,--carrying in and carrying out. I watched the birds for an\r\nhour, while my companions were taking their turn in exploring the lay\r\nof the land around us, and noted no variation in the programme. It\r\nwould be curious to know if the young are fed and waited upon in\r\nregular order, and how, amid the darkness and the crowded state of the\r\napartment, the matter is so neatly managed. But ornithologists are all\r\nsilent upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YELLOW-BELLIED WOODPECKER.]\r\n\r\nThis practice of the birds is not so uncommon as it might at first\r\nseem. It is, indeed, almost an invariable rule among all land birds.\r\nWith woodpeckers and kindred species, and with birds that burrow in\r\nthe ground, as bank swallows, kingfishers, etc., it is a necessity.\r\nThe accumulation of the excrement in the nest would prove most fatal\r\nto the young.\r\n\r\nBut even among birds that neither bore nor mine, but which build a\r\nshallow nest on the branch of a tree or upon the ground, as the robin,\r\nthe finches, the buntings, etc., the ordure of the young is removed to\r\na distance by the parent bird. When the robin is seen going away from\r\nits brood with a slow, heavy flight, entirely different from its\r\nmanner a moment before on approaching the nest with a cherry or worm,\r\nit is certain to be engaged in this office. One may observe the social\r\nsparrow, when feeding its young, pause a moment after the worm has\r\nbeen given, and hop around on the brink of the nest, observing the\r\nmovements within.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of cleanliness no doubt prompts the action in all cases,\r\nthough the disposition to secrecy or concealment may not be unmixed\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe swallows form an exception to the rule, the excrement being voided\r\nby the young over the brink of the nest. They form an exception, also,\r\nto the rule of secrecy, aiming not so much to conceal the nest as to\r\nrender it inaccessible.\r\n\r\nOther exceptions are the pigeons, hawks, and water-fowls.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Having a good chance to note the color and markings of\r\nthe woodpeckers as they passed in and out at the opening of the nest,\r\nI saw that Audubon had made a mistake in figuring or describing the\r\nfemale of this species with the red spot upon the head. I have seen a\r\nnumber of pairs of them, and in no instance have I seen the mother\r\nbird marked with red.\r\n\r\nThe male was in full plumage, and I reluctantly shot him for a\r\nspecimen. Passing by the place again next day, I paused a moment to\r\nnote how matters stood. I confess it was not without some compunctions\r\nthat I heard the cries of the young birds, and saw the widowed mother,\r\nher cares now doubled, hastening to and fro in the solitary woods. She\r\nwould occasionally pause expectantly on the trunk of a tree, and utter\r\na loud call.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens when the male of any species is killed during the\r\nbreeding season, that the female soon procures another mate. There\r\nare, most likely, always a few unmated birds of both sexes, within a\r\ngiven range, and through these the broken links may be restored.\r\nAudubon or Wilson, I forgot which, tells a pair of fish-hawks, or\r\nospreys, that built their nest in an ancient oak. The male was so\r\nzealous in the defence of the young that it actually attacked with\r\nbeak and claw a person who attempted to climb into his nest, putting\r\nhis face and eyes in great jeopardy. Arming himself with a heavy club,\r\nthe climber felled the gallant bird to the ground and killed him. In\r\nthe course of a few days, the female had procured another mate. But\r\nnaturally enough the step-father showed none of the spirit and pluck\r\nin defence of the brood that had been displayed by the original\r\nparent. When danger was nigh, he was seen afar off, sailing around in\r\nplacid unconcern.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that when either the wild turkey or domestic\r\nturkey begins to lay, and afterwards to sit and rear the brood, she\r\nsecludes herself from the male, who then, very sensibly, herds with\r\nothers of his sex, and betakes himself to haunts of his own till male\r\nand female, old and young, meet again on common ground, late in the\r\nfall. But rob the sitting bird of her eggs, or destroy her tender\r\nyoung, and she immediately sets out in quest of a male, who is no\r\nlaggard when he hears her call. The same is true of ducks and other\r\naquatic fowls. The propagating instinct is strong, and surmounts all\r\nordinary difficulties. No doubt the widowhood I had caused in the case\r\nof the woodpeckers was of short duration, and chance brought, or the\r\nwidow drummed up, some forlorn male, who was not dismayed by the\r\nprospect of having a large family of half grown birds on his hands at\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\nI have seen a fine cock robin paying assiduous addresses to a female\r\nbird as late as the middle of July; and I have no doubt that his\r\nintentions were honorable. I watched the pair for half an hour. The\r\nhen, I took it, was in the market for the second time that season; but\r\nthe cock, from his bright, unfaded plumage, looked like a new arrival.\r\nThe hen resented every advance of the male. In vain he strutted around\r\nher and displayed his fine feathers; every now and then she would make\r\nat him in a most spiteful manner. He followed her to the ground,\r\npoured into her ear a fine, half-suppressed warble, offered her a\r\nworm, flew back to the tree again with a great spread of plumage,\r\nhopped around her on the branches, chirruped, chattered, flew\r\ngallantly at an intruder, and was back in an instant at her side. No\r\nuse,--she cut him short at every turn.\r\n\r\nThe _denouement_ I cannot relate, as the artful bird, followed by her\r\nardent suitor, soon flew away beyond my sight. It may not be rash to\r\nconclude, however that she held out no longer than was prudent.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there seems to be a system of Women's Rights prevailing\r\namong the birds, which, contemplated from the standpoint of the male,\r\nis quite admirable. In almost all cases of joint interest, the female\r\nbird is the most active. She determines the site of the nest, and is\r\nusually the most absorbed in its construction. Generally, she is more\r\nvigilant in caring for the young, and manifests the most concern when\r\ndanger threatens. Hour after hour I have seen the mother of a brood of\r\nblue grossbeaks pass from the nearest meadow to the tree that held her\r\nnest, with a cricket or grasshopper in her bill, while her\r\nbetter-dressed half was singing serenely on a distant tree or pursuing\r\nhis pleasure amid the branches.\r\n\r\nYet among the majority of our song birds, the male is most conspicuous\r\nboth by his color and manners and by his song, and is to that extent a\r\nshield to the female. It is thought that the female is humbler clad\r\nfor her better concealment during incubation. But this is not\r\nsatisfactory, as in some cases she is relieved from time to time by\r\nthe male. In the case of the domestic dove, for instance, promptly at\r\nmid-day the cock is found upon the nest. I should say that the dull or\r\nneutral tints of the female were a provision of nature for her greater\r\nsafety at all times, as her life is far more precious to the species\r\nthan that of the male. The indispensable office of the male reduces\r\nitself to little more than a moment of time, while that of his mate\r\nextends over days and weeks, if not months.\r\n\r\nIn migrating northward, the males precede the females by eight or ten\r\ndays; returning in the fall, the females and young precede the males\r\nby about the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF THE CHICADEE.]\r\n\r\nAfter the woodpeckers have abandoned their nests, or rather chambers,\r\nwhich they do after the first season, their cousins, the nut-hatches,\r\nchickadees, and brown creepers, fall heir to them. These birds,\r\nespecially the creepers and nut-hatches, have many of the habits of\r\nthe _picidae_, but lack their powers of bill, and so are unable to\r\nexcavate a nest for themselves. Their habitation, therefore, is always\r\nsecond-hand. But each species carries in some soft material of various\r\nkinds, or, in other words, furnishes the tenement to its liking. The\r\nchickadee arranges in the bottom of the cavity a little mat of a\r\nlight, felt-like substance, which looks as if it came from the\r\nhatter's, but which is probably the work of numerous worms or\r\ncaterpillars. On this soft lining the female deposits six white eggs.\r\n\r\nI recently discovered one of these nests in a most interesting\r\nsituation. The tree containing it, a variety of the wild cherry, stood\r\nupon the brink of the bald summit of a high mountain. Gray, time-worn\r\nrocks lay piled loosely about, or overtoppled the just visible by-ways\r\nof the red fox. The trees had a half-scared look, and that\r\nindescribable wildness which lurks about the tops of all remote\r\nmountains possessed the place. Standing there, I looked down upon the\r\nback of the red-tailed hawk as he flew out over the earth beneath me.\r\nFollowing him, my eye also took in farms, and settlements, and\r\nvillages, and other mountain ranges that grew blue in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe parent birds attracted my attention by appearing with food in\r\ntheir beaks, and by seeming much put out. Yet so wary were they of\r\nrevealing the locality of their brood, or even of the precise tree\r\nthat held them, that I lurked around over an hour without gaining a\r\npoint on them. Finally a bright and curious boy who accompanied me\r\nsecreted himself under a low, projecting rock close to the tree in\r\nwhich we supposed the nest to be, while I moved off around the\r\nmountain-side. It was not long before the youth had their secret. The\r\ntree, which was low and wide branching, and overrun with lichens,\r\nappeared at a cursory glance to contain not one dry or decayed limb.\r\nYet there was one a few feet long, in which, when my eyes were piloted\r\nthither, I detected a small round orifice.\r\n\r\nAs my weight began to shake the branches, the consternation of both\r\nold and young was great. The stump of a limb that held the nest was\r\nabout three inches thick, and at the bottom of the tunnel was\r\nexcavated quite to the bark. With my thumb I broke in the thin wall,\r\nand the young, which were full-fledged, looked out upon the world for\r\nthe first time. Presently one of them, with a significant chirp, as\r\nmuch as to say, \"It is time we were out of this,\" began to climb up\r\ntoward the proper entrance. Placing himself in the hole, he looked\r\naround without manifesting any surprise at the grand scene that lay\r\nspread out before him. He was taking his bearings and determining how\r\nfar he could trust the power of his untried wings to take him out of\r\nharm's way. After a moment's pause, with a loud chirrup, he launched\r\nout, and made tolerable headway. The others rapidly followed. Each\r\none, as it started upward, from a sudden impulse, contemptuously\r\nsaluted the abandoned nest with its excrement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARN SWALLOW AND NEST.]\r\n\r\nThough generally regular in their habits and instincts, yet the birds\r\nsometimes seem as whimsical and capricious as superior beings. One is\r\nnot safe, for instance, in making any absolute assertion as to their\r\nplace or mode of building. Ground builders often get up into a bush,\r\nand tree builders sometimes get upon the ground or into a tussock of\r\ngrass. The song-sparrow, which is a ground builder, has been known to\r\nbuild in the knot-hole of a fence rail, and a chimney swallow once got\r\ntired of soot and smoke, and fastened its nest on a rafter in a hay\r\nbarn. A friend tells me of a pair of barn swallows which, taking a\r\nfanciful turn, saddled their nest in the loop of a rope that was\r\npendent from a peg in the peak, and liked it so well that they\r\nrepeated the experiment next year. I have known the social sparrow, or\r\n\"hair bird,\" to build under a shed, in a tuft of hay that hung down,\r\nthrough the loose flooring, from the mow above. It usually contents\r\nitself with a half a dozen stalks of dry grass and a few long hairs\r\nfrom a cow's tail, loosely arranged on the branch of an apple-tree.\r\nThe rough-winged swallow builds in the wall and in old stone heaps,\r\nand I have seen the robin build in similar localities. Others have\r\nfound its nest in old, abandoned wells. The house wren will build in\r\nanything that has an accessible cavity, from an old boot to a\r\nbombshell. A pair of them once persisted in building their nest in the\r\ntop of a certain pump-tree, getting in through the opening above the\r\nhandle. The pump being in daily use, the nest was destroyed more than\r\na score of times. This jealous little wretch has the wise forethought,\r\nwhen the box in which he builds contains two compartments, to fill up\r\none of them, so as to avoid the risk of troublesome neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe less skilful builders sometimes depart from their usual habit, and\r\ntake up with the abandoned nest of some other species. The blue-jay\r\nnow and then lays in an old crow's-nest or cuckoo's-nest. The\r\ncrow-blackbird, seized with a fit of indolence, drops its eggs in the\r\ncavity of a decayed branch. I heard of a cuckoo that dispossessed a\r\nrobin of its nest; of another that set a blue-jay adrift. Large, loose\r\nstructures, like the nests of the osprey and certain of the herons,\r\nhave been found with half a dozen nests of the blackbird set in the\r\nouter edges, like so many parasites, or, as Audubon says, like the\r\nretainers about the rude court of a feudal baron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALTIMORE ORIOLE AND NEST.]\r\n\r\nThe same birds breeding in a southern climate construct far less\r\nelaborate nests than when breeding in a northern climate. Certain\r\nspecies of water-fowl that abandon their eggs to the sand and the sun\r\nin the warmer zones, build a nest and sit in the usual way in\r\nLabrador. In Georgia, the Baltimore oriole places its nest upon the\r\nnorth side of the tree; in the Middle and Eastern States, it fixes it\r\nupon the south or east side, and makes it much thicker and Warner. I\r\nhave seen one from the South that had some kind-of coarse reed or\r\nsedge woven into it, giving it an open-work appearance, like a\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nVery few species use the same material uniformly. I have seen the nest\r\nof the robin quite destitute of mud. In one instance, it was composed\r\nmainly of long, black horse-hairs, arranged in a circular manner, with\r\na lining of fine yellow grass; the whole presenting quite a novel\r\nappearance. In another case, the nest was chiefly constructed of a\r\nspecies of rock moss.\r\n\r\nThe nest for the second brood during the same season is often a mere\r\nmake-shift. The haste of the female to deposit her eggs as the season\r\nadvances seems very great, and the structure is apt to be prematurely\r\nfinished. I was recently reminded of this fact by happening, about the\r\nlast of July, to meet with several nests of the wood or bush sparrow\r\nin a remote blackberry field. The nests with eggs were far less\r\nelaborate and compact than the earlier nests, from which the young had\r\nflown.\r\n\r\nDay after day, as I go to a certain piece of woods, I observe a male\r\nindigo-bird sitting on precisely the same part of a high branch, and\r\nsinging in his most vivacious style. As I approach, he ceases to sing,\r\nand, flirting his tail right and left with marked emphasis, chirps\r\nsharply. In a low bush near by, I come upon the object of his\r\nsolicitude, a thick, compact nest, composed largely of dry leaves and\r\nfine grass, in which a plain brown bird is sitting upon four pale blue\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is, that a bird will leave the apparent security of the\r\ntree-tops, to place its nest in the way of the many dangers that walk\r\nand crawl upon the ground. There, far out of reach, sings the bird;\r\nhere, not three feet from the ground, are its eggs or helpless young.\r\nThe truth is, birds are the greatest enemies of birds, and it is with\r\nreference to this fact that many of the smaller species build.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIGO BIRD'S NEST.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest proportion of birds breed along highways. I have\r\nknown the ruffed grouse to come out of a dense wood and make its nest\r\nat the root of a tree within ten paces of the road, where, no doubt,\r\nhawks and crows, as well as skunks and foxes, would be less liable to\r\nfind it out. Traversing remote mountain-roads through dense woods, I\r\nhave repeatedly seen the veery, or Wilson's thrush, sitting upon her\r\nnest, so near me that I could almost take her from it by stretching\r\nout my hand. Birds of prey show none of this confidence in man, and,\r\nwhen locating their nests, avoid rather than seek his haunts.\r\n\r\nIn a certain locality in the interior of New York, I know, every\r\nseason, where I am sure to find a nest or two of the slate-colored\r\nsnow-bird. It is under the brink of a low, mossy bank, so near the\r\nhighway that it could be reached from a passing vehicle with a whip.\r\nEvery horse or wagon or foot passenger disturbs the sitting bird. She\r\nawaits the near approach of a sound of feet or wheels, and then darts\r\nquickly across the road, barely clearing the ground, and disappears\r\namid the bushes on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nIn the trees that line one of the main streets and fashionable drives\r\nleading out of Washington city, and less than half a mile from the\r\nboundary, I have counted the nests of five different species at one\r\ntime, and that without any very close scrutiny of the foliage, while\r\nin many acres of woodland, half a mile off, I searched in vain for a\r\nsingle nest. Among the five that interested me most was that of a blue\r\ngrossbeak. Here this bird, which, according to Audubon's observations,\r\nin Louisiana is shy and recluse, affecting remote marshes and the\r\nborders of large ponds of stagnant water, had placed its nest in the\r\nlowest twig of the lowest branch of a large sycamore, immediately over\r\na great thoroughfare, and so near the ground that a person standing in\r\na cart or sitting on a horse could have reached it with his hand. The\r\nnest was composed mainly of fragments of newspaper and stalks of\r\ngrass, and, though so low, was remarkably well concealed by one of the\r\npeculiar clusters of twigs and leaves which characterize this tree.\r\nThe nest contained young when I discovered it, and though the parent\r\nbirds were much annoyed by my loitering about beneath the tree, they\r\npaid little attention to the stream of vehicles that was constantly\r\npassing. It is a wonder to me when the birds could have built it, for\r\nthey are much shyer when building than at other times. No doubt they\r\nworked mostly in the morning, having the early hours all to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAnother pair of blue grossbeaks built in a graveyard within the city\r\nlimits. The nest was placed in a low bush, and the male continued to\r\nsing at intervals till the young were ready to fly. The song of this\r\nbird is a rapid, intricate warble, like that of the indigo-bird,\r\nthough stronger and louder. Indeed, these two birds so much resemble\r\neach other in color, form, manner, voice, and general habits that,\r\nwere it not for the difference in size,--the grossbeak being nearly as\r\nlarge again as the indigo-bird,--it would be a hard matter to tell\r\nthem apart. The females of both species are clad in the same\r\nreddish-brown suits. So are the young the first season.\r\n\r\nOf course in the deep, primitive woods also are nests, but how rarely\r\nwe find them! The simple art of the bird consists in choosing common,\r\nneutral-tinted material, as moss, dry leaves, twigs, and various odds\r\nand ends, and placing the structure on a convenient branch, where it\r\nblends in color with its surroundings; but how consummate is this art,\r\nand how skilfully is the nest concealed! We occasionally light upon\r\nit, but who, unaided by the movements of the bird, could find it out?\r\nDuring the present season, I went to the woods nearly every day for a\r\nfortnight, without making any discoveries of this kind, till one day,\r\npaying them a farewell visit, I chanced to come upon several nests. A\r\nblack and white creeping warbler suddenly became much alarmed as I\r\napproached a crumbling old stump in a dense part of the forest. He\r\nalighted upon it, chirped sharply, ran up and down its sides, and\r\nfinally left it with much reluctance. The nest, which contained three\r\nyoung birds nearly fledged, was placed upon the ground, at the foot of\r\nthe stump, and in such a position that the color of the young\r\nharmonized perfectly with the bits of bark, sticks, etc., lying about.\r\nMy eye rested upon them for the second time before I made them out.\r\nThey hugged the nest very closely, but as I put down my hand they\r\nscampered off with loud cries for help, which caused the parent birds\r\nto place themselves almost within my reach. The nest was merely a\r\nlittle dry grass arranged in a thick bed of dry leaves.\r\n\r\nThis was amid a thick undergrowth. Moving on into a passage of large,\r\nstately hemlocks, with only here and there a small beech or maple\r\nrising up into the perennial twilight, I paused to make out a note\r\nwhich was entirely new to me. It is still in my ear. Though\r\nunmistakably a bird note, it yet suggested the bleating of a tiny\r\nlambkin. Presently the birds appeared,--a pair of the solitary vireo.\r\nThey came flitting from point to point, alighting only for a moment at\r\na time, the male silent, but the female uttering this strange, tender\r\nnote. It was a rendering into some new sylvan dialect of the human\r\nsentiment of maidenly love. It was really pathetic in its sweetness\r\nand childlike confidence and joy. I soon discovered that the pair were\r\nbuilding a nest upon a low branch a few yards from me. The male flew\r\ncautiously to the spot, and adjusted something, and the twain moved\r\non, the female calling to her mate at intervals, _love-e, love-e_,\r\nwith a cadence and tenderness in the tone that rang in the ear long\r\nafterward. The nest was suspended to the fork of a small branch, as is\r\nusual with the vireos, plentifully lined with lichens, and bound and\r\nrebound with masses of coarse spider-webs. There was no attempt at\r\nconcealment except in the neutral tints, which made it look like a\r\nnatural growth of the dim, gray woods.\r\n\r\nContinuing my random walk, I next paused in a low part of the woods,\r\nwhere the larger trees began to give place to a thick second growth\r\nthat covered an old Bark-peeling. I was standing by a large maple,\r\nwhen a small bird darted quickly away from it, as if it might have\r\ncome out of a hole near its base. As the bird paused a few yards from\r\nme, and began to chirp uneasily, my curiosity was at once excited.\r\nWhen I saw it was the female mourning ground warbler, and remembered\r\nthat the nest of this bird had not yet been seen by any\r\nnaturalist,--that not even Dr. Brewer had ever seen the eggs,--I felt\r\nthat here was something worth looking for. So I carefully began the\r\nsearch, exploring inch by inch the ground, the base and roots of the\r\ntree, and the various shrubby growths about it, till, finding nothing,\r\nand fearing I might really put my foot in it, I bethought me to\r\nwithdraw to a distance and after some delay return again, and, thus\r\nforewarned, note the exact point from which the bird flew. This I did,\r\nand, returning, had little difficulty in discovering the nest. It was\r\nplaced but a few feet from the maple-tree, in a bunch of ferns, and\r\nabout six inches from the ground. It was quite a massive nest,\r\ncomposed entirely of the stalks and leaves of dry grass, with an inner\r\nlining of fine, dark-brown roots. The eggs, three in number, were of\r\nlight flesh color, uniformly specked with fine brown specks. The\r\ncavity of the nest was so deep that the back of sitting bird sank\r\nbelow the edge.\r\n\r\nIn the top of a tall tree, a short distance farther on, I saw the nest\r\nof the red-tailed hawk,--a large mass of twigs and dry sticks. The\r\nyoung had flown, but still lingered in the vicinity, and, as I\r\napproached, the mother bird flew about over me, squealing in a very\r\nangry, savage manner. Tufts of the hair and other indigestible\r\nmaterial of the common meadow mouse lay around on the ground beneath\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF RED-EYED VIREO.]\r\n\r\nAs I was about leaving the woods, my hat almost brushed the nest of\r\nthe red-eyed vireo, which hung basket-like on the end of a low,\r\ndrooping branch of the beech. I should never have seen it had the bird\r\nkept her place. It contained three eggs of the bird's own, and one of\r\nthe cow-bunting. The strange egg was only just perceptibly larger than\r\nthe others, yet three days after, when I looked into the nest again\r\nand found all but one egg hatched, the young interloper was at least\r\nfour times as large as either of the others, and with such a\r\nsuperabundance of bowels as to almost smother his bedfellows beneath\r\nthem. That the intruder should fare the same as the rightful\r\noccupants, and thrive with them, was more than ordinary potluck; but\r\nthat it alone should thrive, devouring, as it were, all the rest, is\r\none of those freaks of Nature in which she would seem to discourage\r\nthe homely virtues of prudence and honesty. Weeds and parasites have\r\nthe odds greatly against them, yet they wage a very successful war\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe woods hold not such another gem as the nest of the humming-bird.\r\nThe finding of one is an event to date from. It is the next best thing\r\nto finding an eagle's nest. I have met with but two, both by chance.\r\nOne was placed on the horizontal branch of a chestnut-tree, with a\r\nsolitary green leaf, forming a complete canopy, about an inch and a\r\nhalf above it. The repeated spiteful dartings of the bird past my\r\nears, as I stood under the tree, caused me to suspect that I was\r\nintruding upon some one's privacy; and following it with my eye, I\r\nsoon saw the nest, which was in process of construction. Adopting my\r\nusual tactics of secreting myself near by, I had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the tiny artist at work. It was the female, unassisted by her\r\nmate. At intervals of two or three minutes she would appear with a\r\nsmall tuft of some cottony substance in her beak, dart a few times\r\nthrough and around the tree, and alighting quickly in the nest arrange\r\nthe material she had brought, using her breast as a model.\r\n\r\nThe other nest I discovered in a dense forest on the side of a\r\nmountain. The sitting bird was disturbed as I passed beneath her. The\r\nwhirring of her wings arrested my attention, when, after a short\r\npause, I had the good luck to see, through an opening in the leaves,\r\nthe bird return to her nest, which appeared like a mere wart or\r\nexcrescence on a small branch. The humming-bird, unlike all others,\r\ndoes not alight upon the nest, but flies into it. She enters it as\r\nquick as a flash, but as light as any feather. Two eggs are the\r\ncomplement. They are perfectly white, and so frail that only a woman's\r\nfingers may touch them. Incubation lasts about ten days. In a week the\r\nyoung have flown.\r\n\r\nThe only nest like the humming-bird's, and comparable to it in\r\nneatness and symmetry, is that of the blue-gray gnat-catcher. This is\r\noften saddled upon the limb in the same manner, though it is generally\r\nmore or less pendent; it is deep and soft, composed mostly of some\r\nvegetable down, covered all over with delicate tree-lichens, and,\r\nexcept that it is much larger, appears almost identical with the nest\r\nof the humming-bird.\r\n\r\nBut the nest of nests, the ideal nest, after we have left the deep\r\nwoods, is unquestionably that of the Baltimore oriole. It is the only\r\nperfectly pensile nest we have. The nest of the orchard oriole is\r\nindeed mainly so, but this bird generally builds lower and shallower,\r\nmore after the manner of the vireos.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore oriole loves to attach its nest to the swaying branches\r\nof the tallest elms, making no attempt at concealment, but satisfied\r\nif the position be high and the branch pendent. This nest would seem\r\nto cost more time and skill than any other bird structure. A peculiar\r\nflax-like substance seems to be always sought after, and always\r\nfound. The nest when completed assumes the form of a large, suspended\r\ngourd. The walls are thin but firm, and proof against the most driving\r\nrain. The mouth is hemmed or over-handed with horse-hair, and the\r\nsides are usually sewed through and through with the same.\r\n\r\nNot particular as to the matter of secrecy, the bird is not particular\r\nas to material, so that it be of the nature of strings or threads. A\r\nlady friend once told me that while working by an open window, one of\r\nthese birds approached during her momentary absence, and, seizing a\r\nskein of some kind of thread or yarn, made off with it to its\r\nhalf-finished nest. But the perverse yarn caught fast in the branches,\r\nand, in the bird's efforts to extricate it, got hopelessly tangled.\r\nShe tugged away at it all day, but was finally obliged to content\r\nherself with a few detached portions. The fluttering strings were an\r\neye-sore to her ever after, and passing and repassing, she would give\r\nthem a spiteful jerk, as much as to say, \"There is that confounded\r\nyarn that gave me so much trouble.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Pennsylvania, Vincent Barnard (to whom I am indebted for other\r\ncurious facts) sent me this interesting story of an oriole. He says a\r\nfriend of his, curious in such things, on observing the bird beginning\r\nto build, hung out near the prospective nest skeins of many-colored\r\nzephyr-yarn, which the eager artist readily appropriated. He managed\r\nit so that the bird used nearly equal quantities of various high,\r\nbright colors. The nest was made unusually deep and capacious, and it\r\nmay be questioned if such a thing of beauty was ever before woven by\r\nthe cunning of a bird.\r\n\r\nNuttall, by far the most genial of American ornithologists, relates\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"A female (oriole), which I observed attentively, carried off to her\r\nnest a piece of lamp-wick ten or twelve feet long. This long string\r\nand many other shorter ones were left hanging out for about a week\r\nbefore both the ends were wattled into the sides of the nest. Some\r\nother little birds making use of similar materials, at times twitched\r\nthese flowing ends, and generally brought out the busy Baltimore from\r\nher occupation in great anger.\r\n\r\n\"I may perhaps claim indulgence for adding a little more of the\r\nbiography of this particular bird, as a representative, also, of\r\nthe instincts of her race. She completed the nest in about a week's\r\ntime, without any aid from her mate, who, indeed, appeared but seldom\r\nin her company, and was now become nearly silent. For fibrous\r\nmaterials she broke, hackled, and gathered the flax of the _asclepias_\r\nand _hibiscus_ stalks, tearing off long strings and flying with them\r\nto the scene of her labors. She appeared very eager and hasty in her\r\npursuits, and collected her materials without fear or restraint, while\r\nthree men were working in the neighboring walks, and many persons\r\nvisiting the garden. Her courage and perseverance were indeed truly\r\nadmirable. If watched too narrowly, she saluted with her usual\r\nscolding, _tshrr, tshrr, tshrr_, seeing no reason, probably, why she\r\nshould be interrupted in her indispensable occupation.\r\n\r\n\"Though the males were now comparatively silent on the arrival of\r\ntheir busy mates, I could not help observing this female and a second,\r\ncontinually vociferating apparently in strife. At last she was\r\nobserved to attack this second female very fiercely, who slyly\r\nintruded herself at times into the same tree where she was building.\r\nThese contests were angry and often repeated. To account for this\r\nanimosity, I now recollected that two fine males had been killed in\r\nour vicinity; and I therefore concluded the intruder to be left\r\nwithout a mate; yet she had gained the affections of the consort of\r\nthe busy female, and thus the cause of their jealous quarrel became\r\napparent. Having obtained the confidence of her faithless paramour,\r\nthe second female began preparing to weave a nest in an adjoining elm,\r\nby tying together certain pendent twigs as a foundation. The male now\r\nassociated chiefly with the intruder, whom he even assisted in her\r\nlabor, yet did not wholly forget his first partner, who called on him\r\none evening in a low, affectionate tone, which was answered in the\r\nsame strain. While they were thus engaged in friendly whispers,\r\nsuddenly appeared the rival, and a violent _rencontre_ ensued, so that\r\none of the females appeared to be greatly agitated, and fluttered with\r\nspreading wings as if considerably hurt. The male, though prudently\r\nneutral in the contest, showed his culpable partiality by flying off\r\nwith his paramour, and for the rest of the evening left the tree to\r\nhis pugnacious consort. Cares of another kind, more imperious and\r\ntender, at length reconciled, or at least terminated, these disputes\r\nwith the jealous females; and by the aid of the neighboring bachelors,\r\nwho are never wanting among these and other birds, peace was at length\r\ncompletely restored, by the restitution of the quiet and happy\r\ncondition of monogamy.\"\r\n\r\nLet me not forget to mention the nest under the mountain ledge, the\r\nnest of the common pewee, a modest mossy structure, with four\r\npearl-white eggs, looking out upon some wild scene and overhung by\r\nbeetling crags. After all has been said about the elaborate, high-hung\r\nstructures, few nests, perhaps, awaken more pleasant emotions in the\r\nmind of the beholder than this of the pewee,--the gray, silent rocks,\r\nwith caverns and dens where the fox and the wolf lurk, and just out of\r\ntheir reach, in a little niche, as if it grew there, the mossy\r\ntenement!\r\n\r\nNearly every high projecting rock in my range has one of these nests.\r\nFollowing a trout stream up a wild mountain gorge, not long since, I\r\ncounted five in the distance of a mile, all within easy reach, but\r\nsafe from the minks and the skunks, and well housed from the storms.\r\nIn my native town I know a pine and oak clad hill, round-topped, with\r\na bold, precipitous front extending half-way around it. Near the top,\r\nand along this front or side, there crops out a ledge of rocks\r\nunusually high and cavernous. One immense layer projects many feet,\r\nallowing a person or many persons, standing upright, to move freely\r\nbeneath it. There is a delicious spring of water there, and plenty of\r\nwild, cool air. The floor is of loose stone, now trod by sheep and\r\nfoxes, once by the Indian and the wolf. How I have delighted from\r\nboyhood to spend a summer-day in this retreat or take refuge there\r\nfrom a sudden shower! Always the freshness and coolness, and always\r\nthe delicate mossy nest of the phoebe-bird! The bird keeps her place\r\ntill you are within a few feet of her, when she flits to a near\r\nbranch, and, with many oscillations of her tail, observes you\r\nanxiously. Since the country has become settled, this pewee has fallen\r\ninto the strange practice of occasionally placing its nest under a\r\nbridge, hay-shed, or other artificial structure, where it is subject\r\nto all kinds of interruptions and annoyances. When placed thus, the\r\nnest is larger and coarser. I know a hayloft beneath which a pair has\r\nregularly placed its nest for several successive seasons. Arranged\r\nalong on a single pole, which sags down a few inches from the flooring\r\nit was intended to help support, are three of these structures,\r\nmarking the number of years the birds have nested there. The\r\nfoundation is of mud with a superstructure of moss, elaborately lined\r\nwith hair and feathers. Nothing can be more perfect and exquisite than\r\nthe interior of one of these nests, yet a new one is built every\r\nseason. Three broods, however, are frequently reared in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF PHOEBE.]\r\n\r\nThe pewees, as a class, are the best architects we have. The king-bird\r\nbuilds a nest altogether admirable, using various soft cotton and\r\nwoollen substances, and sparing neither time nor material to make it\r\nsubstantial and warm. The green-crested pewee builds its nest in many\r\ninstances wholly of the blossoms of the white-oak. The wood pewee\r\nbuilds a neat, compact socket-shaped nest of moss and lichens on a\r\nhorizontal branch. There is never a loose end or shred about it. The\r\nsitting bird is largely visible above the rim. She moves her head\r\nfreely about, and seems entirely at her ease,--a circumstance which I\r\nhave never observed in any other species. The nest of the\r\ngreat-crested flycatcher is seldom free from snake skins, three or\r\nfour being sometimes woven into it.\r\n\r\nAbout the thinnest, shallowest nest, for its situation, that can be\r\nfound is that of the turtle-dove. A few sticks and straws are\r\ncarelessly thrown together, hardly sufficient to prevent the eggs from\r\nfalling through or rolling off. The nest of the passenger pigeon is\r\nequally hasty and insufficient, and the squabs often fall to the\r\nground and perish. The other extreme among our common birds is\r\nfurnished by the ferruginous thrush, which collects together a mass of\r\nmaterial that would fill a half-bushel measure; or by the fish-hawk,\r\nwhich adds to and repairs its nest year after year, till the whole\r\nwould make a cart-load.\r\n\r\nThe rarest of all nests is that of the eagle, because the eagle is the\r\nrarest of all birds. Indeed, so seldom is the eagle seen, that its\r\npresence always seems accidental. It appears as if merely pausing on\r\nthe way, while bound for some distant unknown region. One September,\r\nwhile a youth, I saw the ring-tailed eagle, an immense, dusky bird,\r\nthe sight of which filled me with awe. It lingered about the hills for\r\ntwo days. Some young cattle, a two year-old colt, and half a dozen\r\nsheep were at pasture on a high ridge that led up to the mountain,\r\nand in plain view of the house. On the second day, this dusky monarch\r\nwas seen flying about above them. Presently he began to hover over\r\nthem, after the manner of a hawk watching for mice. He then with\r\nextended legs let himself slowly down upon them, actually grappling\r\nthe backs of the young cattle, and frightening the creatures so that\r\nthey rushed about the field in great consternation; and finally, as he\r\ngrew bolder and more frequent in his descents, the whole herd broke\r\nover the fence, and came tearing down to the house \"like mad.\" It did\r\nnot seem to be an assault with intent to kill, but was, perhaps, a\r\nstratagem resorted to in order to separate the herd and expose the\r\nlambs, which hugged the cattle very closely. When he occasionally\r\nalighted upon the oaks that stood near, the branch _could_ be seen to\r\nsway and bend beneath him. Finally, as a rifleman started out in\r\npursuit of him, he launched into the air, set his wings, and sailed\r\naway southward. A few years afterward, in January, another eagle\r\npassed through the same locality, alighting in a field near some dead\r\nanimal, but tarried briefly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAGLE.]\r\n\r\nSo much by way of identification. The bird is common to the northern\r\nparts of both hemispheres, and places its eyrie on high, precipitous\r\nrocks. A pair built on an inaccessible shelf of rock along the Hudson\r\nfor eight successive years. A squad of Revolutionary soldiers also\r\nfound a nest along this river, and had an adventure with the bird that\r\ncame near costing one of their number his life. His comrades let him\r\ndown by a rope to secure the eggs or young, when he was attacked by\r\nthe female eagle with such fury that he was obliged to defend himself\r\nwith his knife. In doing so, by a mis-stroke, he nearly severed the\r\nrope that held him, and was drawn up by a single strand from his\r\nperilous position. Audubon, from whom this anecdote is taken, figures\r\nand describes this bird as the golden eagle, though I have little\r\ndoubt that Wilson was right, and that the golden eagle is a distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe sea-eagle also builds on high rocks, according to Audubon, though\r\nWilson describes the nest of one which he saw near Great Egg Harbor,\r\nin the top of a large yellow pine. It was a vast pile of sticks, sods,\r\nsedge, grass, reeds, etc., five or six feet high by four broad, and\r\nwith little or no concavity. It had been used for many years, and he\r\nwas told that the eagles made it a sort of home or lodging-place in\r\nall seasons. This agrees with the description which Audubon gives of\r\nthe nest of the bald eagle. There is evidently a little confusion on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nThe eagle in all cases uses one nest, with more or less repair, for\r\nseveral years. Many of our common birds do the same. The birds may be\r\ndivided, with respect to this and kindred points, into five general\r\nclasses. First, those that repair and appropriate the last year's\r\nnest, as the wren, swallow, blue-bird, great-crested flycatcher, owls,\r\neagles, fish-hawk, and a few others. Secondly, those that build anew\r\neach season, though frequently rearing more than one brood in the same\r\nnest. Of these, the phoebe-bird is a well-known example. Thirdly, those\r\nthat build a new nest for each brood, which includes by far the\r\ngreatest number of species. Fourthly, a limited number that make no\r\nnest of their own, but appropriate the abandoned nests of other birds.\r\nFinally, those who use no nest at all, but deposit their eggs in the\r\nsand, which is the case with a large number of aquatic fowls. Thus the\r\ncommon gull breeds in vast numbers on the sand bars or sand islands\r\noff the south coast of Long Island. A little dent is made in the sand,\r\nthe eggs are dropped, and the old birds go their way. In due time the\r\neggs are hatched by the warmth of the sun, and the little creatures\r\nshift for themselves. In July countless numbers of them, of different\r\nages and sizes, swarm upon these sandy wastes. As the waves roll out,\r\nthey rush down the beach, picking up a kind of sea gluten, and then\r\nhasten back to avoid the next breaker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS IN THEIR RELATION TO AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n(FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEBRASKA ORNITHOLOGISTS' UNION JANUARY,\r\n1901.)[4]\r\n\r\nBY LAURENCE BRUNER.\r\n\r\n[4] By permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen civilized man takes possession of new regions and begins\r\ncultivating the soil and establishes his sovereignty there, the\r\nequilibrium as it existed upon his arrival is very quickly disturbed.\r\nOne or more of the many forms of life--plant and animal--that were\r\npreviously held within certain limits gain ascendency. The\r\nintroduction of new crops that furnish an abundance of the proper food\r\nfor some insect, enables this form to increase out of all proportions\r\nand harm soon results. The killing off of certain other forms of life\r\nthat naturally keep still others in check also assists in disturbing\r\nthe equilibrium further. The cutting down and clearing away of forests\r\nremoves the shelter and homes of others, as does also the turning\r\nunder of prairie grasses. Then, too, many of the natural residents of\r\nprimeval forests and virgin prairies shun the sight of man, hence they\r\ngradually withdraw from the region, and their influence for good or\r\nevil goes with them. Since the majority of such forms are timid and\r\ninoffensive creatures, their withdrawal only adds that much more to\r\nthe already overbalanced conditions. Year by year the gap which at\r\nfirst was scarcely noticeable becomes widened, so that frequent\r\ninroads are made and harm results. Instead of trying to ascertain the\r\ntrue cause for all this trouble perhaps exactly the wrong thing is\r\ndone by the settlers. This of course only has the effect of further\r\nwidening the gap between safety and danger. Since an insect or other\r\nanimal becomes noticeably harmful only when present in alarming\r\nnumbers, it stands to reason that anything which favors such an\r\nabnormal increase is a factor in disturbing nature and should be\r\nquickly rectified where possible. In order that these disturbances\r\nshould be looked after the all-wise God of the universe created birds\r\nand gave them the power of flight that they might the more readily\r\nmove about rapidly from place to place, where their services might be\r\nneeded in balancing affairs. Hence birds have naturally and rightfully\r\nbeen called the \"balancers\" in nature. This being true, let us see\r\njust what their relations are to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe farmer sows in order that he may reap an increased measure of what\r\nhe has sown. In doing this he must first turn over the soil. This\r\ndestroys many existing plants as well as animals that depend upon them\r\nfor food. The plants thus turned down cannot regain their position\r\nand must of necessity die. Not so with many of the animals, however,\r\nwhich soon work their way to the surface. Some of these attack the\r\ngrowing plants which have been made to occupy the place of those\r\ndestroyed by the plough. Others take wing and seek suitable food in\r\nadjoining districts where they add to the numbers already drawing upon\r\nthe vegetation up to the point of possible continued supply. Here,\r\nthen, the scales begin to vibrate. In the field the new and tender\r\ncrop entices the ever-shifting individuals of myriads of forms that\r\nhave been crowded out elsewhere. The result here too is, or would be,\r\nvery disastrous were it not for the timely visit of flocks of birds\r\nlikewise in search of food.\r\n\r\nIt is during the period of first settlement of a country, when the\r\nfields are small, few and widely separated, that injury may and\r\nfrequently does result from birds. It is then a problem that needs\r\ncareful consideration, not only for the time being, but also for the\r\nfuture welfare of that country. If animal life is destroyed\r\nindiscriminately and without intelligent forethought, calamities\r\nunforeseen are sure to follow in the not distant future.\r\n\r\nBirds can be useful to man in many ways. They can benefit him by\r\ncarrying the seeds of various plants from place to place so as to\r\nassist him in establishing new groves in which to find shelter from\r\nthe cold in winter and refuge from the heat of the noonday sun in\r\nsummer. They plant various shrubs by the wayside that spring up and\r\nlater are laden with luscious fruit. They also carry the spawn of\r\nfishes and small crustaceans among their feathers into new waters, and\r\nfeed upon the countless seeds of weeds that are scattered broadcast\r\nover the face of the earth. Some kinds live almost exclusively upon\r\ninsects, while others hunt out the small rodents that would, if left\r\nto themselves, destroy great quantities of grain and other vegetation.\r\nStill other birds benefit mankind by acting as scavengers in the\r\nremoval of putrid and other offensive matter which would endanger our\r\nhealth. In addition to all these varied direct benefits which are\r\nbrought about by the presence of birds, man is further indebted to\r\nthese creatures for the cheer which their gay music, bright plumage\r\nand pleasant manners bring to him. The birds form a carefully\r\norganized army of police which is engaged in keeping affairs balanced\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nBut we can go even further summing up the benefits that men may derive\r\nfrom the birds. A great many kinds make excellent food, while others\r\nfurnish sport and pleasure to a large number of men and boys who seem\r\nto require a certain kind of entertainment while accompanied with dog\r\nand gun. Dead birds when embalmed as mummies and attached to the\r\nhead-gear worn by some girls and women are also claimed to cause much\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n_Birds as Enemies._--It would be ridiculous for me to assert here that\r\nno injury ever results from the presence of birds on the farm or in\r\nthe orchard. Quite a number of different species are continually\r\nstepping over to the wrong side of the \"ledger\" as it were, and\r\ncommitting depredations of various kinds which if considered alone\r\nwould render the perpetrators liable to severe punishment--in some\r\ncases even unto death. Some of the crimes that can be charged to the\r\nfeathered tribe are cherry and berry-stealing, grape-puncturing,\r\napple-pecking, corn-pulling, grain-eating, the unintentional carrying\r\nfrom place to place of some kinds of scale insects that happen to\r\ncrawl on their legs and feet, the possible spreading of hog cholera by\r\ncrows and buzzards, the robbing of the poultry yard, and lastly some\r\nbirds are accused of making noises that awaken us from our slumbers in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nSome of these crimes are genuine and are to be deplored, while others\r\nare more imaginary than real. A few of them could be prevented in part\r\nor altogether, while others might be diminished if we were inclined to\r\ntake the trouble to do it.\r\n\r\nAfter all that can be said pro and con concerning the usefulness of\r\nbirds in general there remains no doubt, in the minds of thinking\r\npeople at least, as to the value of these creatures. It is only the\r\nvicious, biased, and thoughtless persons who continue ruthlessly to\r\ndestroy birds indiscriminately without first pausing to consider\r\nwhether or not it is a proper thing to do, whether it is right or\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n_Food habits._--So varied is this task of evening up in nature that if\r\nattended to properly the workers must be numerous in individuals and\r\npossess widely different habits. That such is the case can readily be\r\nseen by the following brief account of the various groups of our\r\nNebraska birds, along with brief statements of their food habits.\r\n\r\nThe Grebes and Loons feed chiefly upon snails and other aquatic\r\nanimals such as are found about their haunts. They also capture many\r\ngrasshoppers and similar insects that happen in their way. They\r\ncannot, therefore, be classed among the especially beneficial birds,\r\nneither can they be termed injurious on account of what they eat.\r\n\r\nThe Gulls, provided as they are with long wings and great powers for\r\nflight, are not confined to the seacoast, hence they reach far inland\r\nin their migrations, feeding extensively upon insects like locusts,\r\nJune-beetles, crickets, etc., large numbers of which they destroy\r\nannually. Several kinds of these birds are known to follow the plough\r\nand pick up the white grubs and other insects that are turned up and\r\nlaid bare. In early days, when grasshoppers did much harm in this\r\nstate, numerous flocks of these birds were seen to feed upon these\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe Cormorants and Pelicans are chiefly destroyers of fishes and\r\nfrogs, hence can hardly be classed among the most beneficial forms;\r\nbut whether or not they do any more than to maintain the necessary\r\nequilibrium in that particular part of the vast field of nature it is\r\ndifficult to judge without time for investigation.\r\n\r\nThe various Ducks and Geese which are also nearly as aquatic in their\r\nhabits as some of the foregoing, frequently leave their haunts and\r\nmake excursions into the surrounding country where in summer they feed\r\nupon locusts, beetles, and other injurious insects. They also partake\r\nof considerable quantities of vegetable food, as grains, weed seeds,\r\ngrasses, and other herbage. While not included among the insectivorous\r\nforms these birds do much towards diminishing the ever increasing\r\nhorde of creeping and jumping things. Ducks and geese on the other\r\nhand are largely utilized by us as food: while their feathers make\r\ncomfortable pillows and coverlets.\r\n\r\nThe Herons, Cranes, and Rails are frequenters of marshes and the\r\nmargins of streams and bodies of water, where they assist in keeping\r\nthe various forms among the animal life balanced. Fishes, frogs,\r\nsnails, insects, and crustaceans are alike devoured by them.\r\n\r\nThe Snipe, Sandpipers, Plovers, Phalaropes, Curlews, etc., are great\r\ndestroyers of insects. Moving as many of them do in great flocks and\r\nspreading out over the meadows, pastures, and hillsides, as well as\r\namong the cultivated fields, they do a large amount of careful police\r\nservice in arresting the culprits among insects. They even pry them\r\nout of burrows and crevices in the earth where these creatures lurk\r\nduring daytime only to come forth after nightfall to destroy\r\nvegetation. The large flocks of Eskimo Curlews that formerly passed\r\nthrough eastern Nebraska did magnificent work during years when the\r\nRocky Mountain Locust was with us, as did also the equally large\r\nflocks of Golden Plovers. The Bartramian Sandpiper even now is a great\r\nfactor each summer in checking the increasing locusts on our prairies.\r\n\r\nThe various members of the Grouse family, while belonging to a\r\ngrain-eating group, are certainly quite prominent as insect\r\ndestroyers. Especially is this so with respect to the Quail, Prairie\r\nHen, Sharptailed Grouse, and Wild Turkey, all of which are occupied\r\nmost of the summer months in capturing and destroying vast numbers of\r\nsuch insects as are found on the prairies. Grasshoppers, locusts,\r\ncrickets, caterpillars, and similar insects comprise the bulk of their\r\ninsect food--forms that are all among the most numerous as well as\r\ndestructive species. In writing about these birds as insect\r\ndestroyers Prof. Samuel Aughey writes: \"I happened to be in the\r\nRepublican Valley, in south-western Nebraska, in August, 1874, when\r\nthe locust invaded that region. Prairie chickens and quails, that\r\nprevious to their coming had a large number of seeds in their\r\nstomachs, when dissected, seemed now for a time to abandon all other\r\nkinds of food. At least from this onward for a month little else than\r\nlocusts were found in their stomachs. All the birds seemed now to live\r\nsolely on locusts for a while.\" In winter and at other times of the\r\nyear when insect life is scarce and difficult to obtain, these birds\r\nfeed more or less extensively upon seeds and other kinds of\r\nvegetation. Some even enter cultivated grounds and seek food that\r\nbelongs to the farmer, thereby doing more or less direct injury. The\r\nextent of such injury, of course, depends upon the number of birds\r\nengaged in the depredations, and also on the time over which it is\r\nallowed to extend. If corn and other grain is harvested at the proper\r\ntime, but little damage ensues; but if allowed to remain in the field\r\nthroughout winter, much of the crop is liable to be taken by the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAIL.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other bird that frequents the farm pays higher prices for\r\nthe grain it eats than does the Quail. Living about the hedgerows,\r\ngroves, and ravines, where insect enemies gather and lurk during the\r\ngreater part of the year, this bird not only seizes large numbers of\r\nthese enemies daily during the summer months when they are \"abroad in\r\nthe land,\" but all winter through it scratches among the fallen leaves\r\nand other rubbish that accumulates about its haunts seeking for\r\nhibernating insects of various kinds. Being a timid little creature,\r\nthe Quail seldom leaves cover to feed openly in the fields, and\r\ntherefore does but little actual harm in the way of destroying grain.\r\nIn fact it only takes stray kernels that otherwise might be lost. This\r\nbird is one of the few that feeds upon that unsavory insect, the\r\nchinch-bug; and the number of this pest that occasionally are\r\ndestroyed by it is really astonishing. No farmer or fruit-grower\r\nshould ever kill a quail himself nor allow anyone else to hunt it on\r\nhis premises.\r\n\r\nOur domestic fowls, save ducks and geese, from which so much direct\r\nincome is derived throughout the year, belong here. It would be folly\r\non my part to assert that they are useless to the farmer. Besides\r\nfurnishing eggs and meat for the table, they are great aids in keeping\r\ndown a variety of noxious insects during spring, summer, and fall.\r\n\r\nThe various species of Doves or Pigeons are not, as a rule, thought of\r\nas being especially harmful, yet repeated examinations of their\r\nstomach contents would indicate that their food seldom, if ever,\r\nconsists of anything but grains and various kinds of seeds along with\r\nother particles of vegetation. The good done by these birds as\r\ndestroyers of weed seeds more than pays for the harm done by them as\r\ngrain-eaters.\r\n\r\nRecent careful study with reference to the food habits of Hawks and\r\nOwls carried on by the United States Department of Agriculture go to\r\nshow that these birds, with but few exceptions, are the farmer's\r\nfriends rather than his enemies. It appears that the good which they\r\naccomplish in the way of destroying mice, gophers, rabbits and other\r\nsmall mammals along with great quantities of noxious insects far\r\nexceeds the possible harm they do by the occasional destruction of\r\npoultry and other birds. A critical examination of the actual contents\r\nof about twenty-seven hundred stomachs of these birds showed that only\r\nsix of the seventy-three species found in the United States are\r\ninjurious. Three of these are so rare that they need not be\r\nconsidered. Of the remaining three the Fish Hawk is only indirectly\r\ninjurious: hence but two remain to be considered, viz., the\r\nSharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks. \"Omitting the six species that feed\r\nlargely on poultry and game, 2,212 stomachs were examined, of which\r\n56 per cent contained mice and other small mammals, 27 per cent insects,\r\nand only 31/2 per cent poultry and game birds.\"\r\n\r\nThe food habits of both the Turkey Vulture and Carrion Crow, or Black\r\nVulture, are of such a nature that the destruction of these birds\r\nshould be prohibited. In fact, in many of the states this is done by\r\nlaw. They live almost exclusively upon carrion or decomposing animal\r\nmatter, and in this manner aid in the prevention of diseases that\r\nmight result from the presence of such filth. They may, however, be\r\nthe cause of indirectly spreading hog cholera where animals that have\r\ndied from this disease are left unburied or unburned.\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoos are among the few birds that habitually feed upon hairy\r\ncaterpillars, such as the various \"tent-making\" species. They also\r\ndestroy large numbers of other caterpillars, and do not object to\r\nbeetles and other insects which they find among the foliage of trees.\r\nAlthough shy birds they are frequently seen in cities, where they do\r\ntheir share in protecting the shade trees from the ravages of insect\r\ndefoliators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODPECKER.]\r\n\r\nTaking the Woodpeckers as a family, there are few persons but who will\r\nreadily admit that these birds comprise a very useful group. Feeding,\r\nin fact, as most of them do, upon the larvae of wood-boring insects,\r\nthey can readily do much greater good for the actual number of insects\r\ndestroyed than if they destroyed only those that feed upon the foliage\r\nof trees. Not unfrequently will a single borer kill an entire tree if\r\nleft to itself, while hundreds of foliage-feeding caterpillars of the\r\nsame size have but little effect upon the appearance, to say nothing\r\nof the health, of the same tree.\r\n\r\nMr. M. L. Beal, assistant in the Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, in summing up the\r\nresults obtained from the examination of six hundred and seventy-nine\r\nstomachs of these birds, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the results of these investigations and comparing one\r\nspecies with another, without losing sight of the fact that\r\ncomparative good is not necessarily positive good, it appears that of\r\nseven species considered the Downy Woodpecker is the most beneficial.\"\r\nHe then goes on to give the food habits based on contents of the\r\nstomachs of our most common species. \"Judged by the stomach\r\nexaminations of the Downy and Hairy Woodpecker and Flicker it would be\r\nhard to find three other species of our common birds with fewer\r\nharmful qualities.\"\r\n\r\nThe Flicker is one of our most common woodpeckers in Nebraska and does\r\nmuch towards keeping down a number of different kinds of insects. It\r\nis very fond of ants as a diet, in fact is partial to them, and this\r\nelement forms almost half of its entire food-supply during the year.\r\nIt also occasionally feeds upon the chinch-bug, as can be attested by\r\nthe fact that the stomach of a specimen killed near Lincoln contained\r\nin the vicinity of one thousand of these bugs. It is also a\r\nfruit-eater to the extent of about one-quarter of its entire bill of\r\nfare, but nature, not man, furnishes the supply. It takes the wild\r\nkinds in preference to those that are cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe Whippoorwill, Night Hawk, and Swifts feed entirely on insects,\r\nand must consequently be classed among the beneficial birds. They all\r\ncapture their prey while upon the wing, and naturally destroy large\r\nnumbers of troublesome kinds.\r\n\r\nThe various species of Flycatchers, as the name implies, destroy\r\ninsects which they capture for the most part while on the wing. Flies\r\nand allied insects are quite prominent on their bill of fare; but\r\nthese by no means are the only kinds of insects destroyed by them.\r\nMany a luckless locust, butterfly, moth or even beetle is snapped up\r\nand devoured by the different species of the family. The Bee-bird, or\r\nKingbird as it is more frequently called, sometimes even catches bees.\r\nThese latter, however, consist largely of drones, hence comparatively\r\nlittle harm is done.\r\n\r\nOne should be unprejudiced in order to write a fair biography of even\r\na bird, or group of birds. To say that I am without such prejudice\r\nwith reference to some of the members of the family of birds now to be\r\nconsidered, would be a falsehood. Still, I shall endeavor to give as\r\nunbiased testimony as possible with reference to their food-habits at\r\nleast, and let the reader judge for himself as to what would be the\r\nproper treatment for these birds. Taking the family as a whole that\r\nwhich is made up of birds like the Crows, Ravens, Magpies, Jays,\r\nNut-crackers, \"Camp-robbers,\" etc., though some of them have\r\nunenviable names and reputations at least, are not at all as bad as we\r\nare sometimes requested to believe them to be.\r\n\r\nThe Crows, Ravens, Magpies, and immediate relatives are what might be\r\ntermed \"omnivorous\" in food-habits, eating everything that comes their\r\nway. Crows, however, have been shown to feed largely on insects,\r\nwhich in great measure at least, offsets the harm done in other\r\ndirections. They also feed on various substances, the removal of which\r\nis for the general good.\r\n\r\nThe Raven is too rare a bird in this state to be taken into\r\nconsideration in respect to food-habits, and the Magpie certainly can\r\nbe put out of the question of doing any possible harm for the same\r\nreason. This leaves then to be considered, the Jays, of which we seem\r\nto have six or seven distinct kinds; but only two of these are at all\r\ncommon. The Blue Jay is found over the entire state, and is familiar\r\nto everybody. The second species is found only in the western and\r\nnorth-western portions among the pine forests, and is known as the\r\nPinon Jay or \"Camp-robber\"--the latter name not very flattering to the\r\nbird I must confess.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Jay does much of the mischief that is laid at the door of the\r\nRobin, orioles, thrushes, and other birds, and then sneaks away\r\nunobserved. He also destroys large numbers of insects and robs the\r\nnest of some small birds.\r\n\r\nIn the Bobolink, Meadowlark, Orioles, and Black-birds, we have some of\r\nthe most important insect destroyers among the feathered tribes. The\r\nBobolink is with us only during the summer months when it is entirely\r\ninsectivorous; and the same can be said of the Cowbird, although the\r\nlatter has the bad habit of compelling other birds to rear its young.\r\n\r\nIn the Red-winged Blackbird we have a friend that we little dream of\r\nwhen we see the large flocks gathering about our corn-fields during\r\nlate summer, and early fall. During the balance of the year it is\r\nengaged most of the time in waging war on various insect pests,\r\nincluding such forms as the \"grub-worms,\" cut-worms, grasshoppers,\r\narmy worm, beet caterpillar, etc. Even when it visits our corn-fields\r\nit more than pays for the corn it eats by the destruction of the worms\r\nthat lurk under the husks of a large per cent of the ears in every\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOBOLINK.]\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago the beet fields in the vicinity of Grand Island were\r\nthreatened great injury by a certain caterpillar that had nearly\r\ndefoliated all the beets growing in many of them. At about this time\r\nlarge flocks of this bird appeared and after a week's sojourn the\r\ncaterpillar plague had vanished, it having been converted into bird\r\ntissues. Numerous other records of the efficiency of their labor as\r\ndestroyers of insect pests might be quoted in favor of this bird, but\r\nI do not believe this to be necessary, although considerable evidence\r\nhas been recorded of its destroying both fruits and grains.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Oriole has received such a bad reputation here in\r\nNebraska as a grape thief during the past few years that I feel\r\ninclined to give extra time and space in endeavoring to \"clear him\"\r\nof such an unenviable charge. This, however, I hardly think necessary\r\nwhen the facts in the case are known. As insect destroyers both this\r\nbird and the Orchard Oriole have had an undisputed reputation for many\r\nyears: and the kinds of insects destroyed by both are of such a class\r\nas to count greatly in their favor. Caterpillars and beetles belonging\r\nto injurious species comprising ninety-six per cent of the food of\r\nthree specimens killed is the record we have in their favor. On the\r\nother hand, grapes have been punctured only \"presumably by this bird,\r\nsince he has so frequently been found in the vineyard and must be the\r\nculprit.\" Now I myself have seen the Oriole in apple orchards under\r\ncompromising circumstances, and have heard pretty strong evidence to\r\nthe effect that it will occasionally puncture ripe apples. It also\r\nbelongs in the same family with some generally accepted \"rascals\"\r\nhence I will admit that possibly some of the charges with which he is\r\ncredited may be true; but I still believe that most of the injuries\r\nto grapes in this and other states must be laid to the English\r\nSparrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD.]\r\n\r\nIf we take pains to water our birds during the dry seasons they will\r\nbe much less apt to seek this supply from the juices of fruits that\r\nare so temptingly near at hand. Place little pans of water in the\r\norchard and vineyard where the birds can visit them without fear of\r\nbeing seized by the house cat or knocked over by a missile from the\r\nalert \"small boy,\" and I am sure that the injury to fruit, to a great\r\nextent at least, will cease.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations tend to prove that the Grackle or Crow-Blackbird\r\ndoes more good than harm and should be protected.\r\n\r\nOur Sparrows and their allies, taken together, form a very extensive\r\nfamily of very beautiful as well as useful birds. Like the warblers,\r\nthey occupy themselves with searching for and destroying insects all\r\nsummer long; but this is not all they do that is good. In fall,\r\nwinter, and early spring, when Mother Earth has lost her brilliant\r\ngreen and rests in sombre browns or beneath ice and snow, the\r\nlongspurs, Snow Bunting, Snowbird, and some of the sparrows that have\r\nremained with us are busily engaged in gathering for themselves a\r\nliving. They hop and fly about from place to place searching for and\r\npicking up little seeds of grass, grain and weeds, of shrubs and\r\ntrees, and appropriating the same to their use, chirping merrily as\r\nthey work away. The European House Sparrow, or the English Sparrow as\r\nit is more commonly called, has the worst reputation of the entire\r\nfamily. But even this bird has some redeeming traits.\r\n\r\nThe Tanagers are insect destroyers, feeding for the most part on such\r\nforms as attack the foliage of trees.\r\n\r\nAll of our Swallows are insect destroyers, capturing such forms as\r\ngnats, flies, etc., which they seize while on the wing. The large\r\ncolonies of different species of these birds that breed within the\r\nstate, as well as those that pass through during their migrations,\r\ndestroy great numbers of these insects. They should be protected.\r\n\r\nThe Waxwings, both the Cedar Bird and Bohemian Waxwing, feed\r\nprincipally upon berries, etc., which they find throughout the year.\r\nStill, in his studies of the food contents of the stomachs of a\r\nvariety of birds taken in a certain orchard that was overrun with\r\ncanker worms, Professor Forbes found that the seven specimens of the\r\nCeder Waxwing had eaten nothing but canker-worms and a few dung\r\nbeetles, the latter in such small numbers as to scarcely count. The\r\nnumber of caterpillars eaten by each bird ranged from 70 to 101.\r\n\r\nThe Shrikes or \"Butcher Birds\" are known as veritable \"brigands\" or\r\n\"pirates\" when it comes to the destruction of other forms of life.\r\nThey are true to their name, and \"butcher\" for pastime large numbers\r\nof insects, mice, lizards, small snakes, and even a few birds. They\r\nthen fly to some thorn bush or barbed-wire fence and impale the\r\nluckless victim and leave it for future use, or to dry up and finally\r\nblow away. The good they do will outweigh the harm.\r\n\r\nThe food of the various Greenlets or Vireos is made up almost entirely\r\nof insects, of which a large per cent are caterpillars, such as\r\ninfest shade trees and the larger shrubs. They should be protected and\r\nencouraged, about the orchard in particular.\r\n\r\nIn the words of that pleasing writer, Dr. Elliott Coues,[5] \"The\r\nWarblers have we always with us, all in their own good time; they come\r\nout of the south, pass on, return, and are away again, their\r\nappearance and withdrawal scarcely less than a mystery; many stay with\r\nus all summer long, and some brave the winters in our midst. Some of\r\nthese slight creatures, guided by unerring instinct, travel true to\r\nthe meridian in the hours of darkness, slipping past like a 'thief\r\nin the night,' stopping at daybreak from their lofty nights to rest\r\nand recruit for the next stage of the journey. Others pass more\r\nleisurely from tree to tree, in a ceaseless tide of migration,\r\ngleaning as they go; the hardier males, in full song and plumage, lead\r\nthe way for the weaker females and yearlings. With tireless industry\r\ndo the warblers befriend the human race; their unconscious zeal plays\r\ndue part in the nice adjustment of nature's forces, helping to bring\r\nabout the balance of vegetable and insect life without which\r\nagriculture would be in vain. They visit the orchard when the apple\r\nand pear, the peach, plum, and cherry are in bloom, seeming to revel\r\ncarelessly amid the sweet-scented and delicately-tinted blossoms, but\r\nnever faltering in their good work. They peer into the crevices of the\r\nbark, scrutinize each leaf, and explore the very heart of the buds, to\r\ndetect, drag forth, and destroy those tiny creatures, singly\r\ninsignificant, collectively a scourge, which prey upon the hopes of\r\nthe fruit-grower, and which, if undisturbed, would bring his care to\r\nnaught. Some warblers flit incessantly in the terminal foliage of the\r\ntallest trees; others hug close to the scored trunks and gnarled\r\nboughs of the forest kings; some peep from the thicket, coppice, the\r\nimpenetrable mantle of shrubbery that decks tiny water-courses,\r\nplaying at hide-and-seek with all comers; others more humble still,\r\ndescend to the ground, where they glide with pretty mincing steps and\r\naffected turning of the head this way and that, their delicate\r\nflesh-tinted feet just stirring the layer of withered leaves with\r\nwhich a past season carpeted the ground. We may seek warblers\r\neverywhere in the season; we shall find them a continued surprise; all\r\nmood and circumstance is theirs.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Key to North American Birds, p. 288.\r\n\r\nMuch could be written concerning the food-habits of the various\r\nmembers of the group of Thrushes, Mocking-birds and Wrens. Three of\r\nthe species at least are known to be more or less destructive to\r\nfruits, viz., Catbird, Brown Thrasher, and Mocking-bird. Still, if we\r\ntake into account what these birds eat during the entire time spent\r\nwithin the state, the balance sheet stands in favor of the birds as\r\ninsect destroyers. The wrens are pre-eminently insect destroyers, and\r\nthe others are not much behind them in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe members of the family of Nuthatches and Tits feed for the most\r\npart on insects. But we lack very definite figures regarding the kinds\r\nand numbers of insects that each destroys. We can be sure, however,\r\nthat any favors shown them will not be thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe Thrushes, Solitaires, Bluebirds, etc., are all beneficial as\r\ninsect destroyers, and might be well compared with the Robin, which is\r\ndescribed quite fully beyond, only they are even less liable to commit\r\ninjuries to fruits.\r\n\r\nThe Robin has certainly been accused often enough of being a\r\nfirst-class rascal to warrant the belief that there must be at least\r\nsome grounds for such accusations being made. In his examination of\r\none hundred and fourteen stomachs of this bird, taken during ten\r\nmonths of the year, Professor Forbes, of Illinois, found the contents\r\nto consist of sixty-five per cent insects and thirty-four per cent of\r\nfruits and seeds. In the estimates of these food percentages taken by\r\nthe Robin, as well as by other birds, bulk for bulk is taken, i.e., a\r\nquart of caterpillars or other insects is equivalent to a quart of\r\ncherries or a quart of berries. Professor Forbes asks this question:\r\n\"Will the destruction of seventeen quarts of average caterpillars,\r\nincluding at least eight quarts of cut-worms, pay for twenty-four\r\nquarts of cherries, blackberries, currents, and grapes?\" and then\r\nanswers it in these words: \"To this question I, for my own part, can\r\nonly reply that I do not believe that the horticulturist can sell his\r\nsmall fruits anywhere in the ordinary markets of the world at so high\r\na price as to the Robin, provided that he uses proper diligence that\r\nthe little huckster doesn't overreach him in the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said in favor of the Robin had I the time and space\r\nat my command.\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully scanned the foregoing notes concerning the\r\nfood-habits of our birds we cannot afford to continue indifferent to\r\nour treatment of them, nor can we even allow our neighbors to kill\r\nthem though we ourselves have decided to reform in this respect. We\r\nmust work for a change of heart in our neighbors also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCISSOR BEAK\r\n\r\n(FROM A JOURNAL OF RESEARCHES, ETC.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has short legs, web feet, extremely long--pointed wings, and is\r\nabout the size of a tern. The beak is flattened laterally, that is, in\r\na plane at right angles to that of a spoonbill or duck. It is as flat\r\nand elastic as an ivory paper-cutter, and the lower mandible,\r\ndifferently from every other bird, is an inch and a half longer than\r\nthe upper. In a lake near Maldonado, from which the water had been\r\nnearly drained, and which, in consequence, swarmed with small fry, I\r\nsaw several of these birds, generally in small flocks, flying rapidly\r\nbackwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake. They kept\r\ntheir bills wide open, and the lower mandible half buried in the\r\nwater. Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their course;\r\nthe water was quite smooth, and it formed a most curious spectacle to\r\nbehold a flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like\r\nsurface. In their flight they frequently twist about with extreme\r\nquickness, and dexterously manage with their projecting lower mandible\r\nto plough up small fish, which are secured by the upper and shorter\r\nhalf of their scissor-like bills. This fact I repeatedly saw, as, like\r\nswallows, they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before\r\nme. Occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight\r\nwas wild, irregular and rapid; then they uttered loud harsh cries.\r\nWhen these birds are fishing, the advantage of the long primary\r\nfeathers of their wings, in keeping them dry, is very evident. When\r\nthus employed, their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists\r\nrepresent marine birds. Their tails are much used in steering their\r\nirregular course.\r\n\r\nThese birds are common far inland along the course of the Rio Parana;\r\nit is said that they remain here during the whole year, and breed in\r\nthe marshes. During the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains,\r\nat some distance from the water. Being at anchor, as I have said, in\r\none of the deep creeks between the islands of Parana, as the evening\r\ndrew to a close, one of these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared. The\r\nwater was quite still, and many little fish were rising. The bird\r\ncontinued for a long time to skim the surface, flying in its wild and\r\nirregular manner up and down the narrow canal, now dark with the\r\ngrowing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees. At Montevideo,\r\nI observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the\r\nmud-banks at the head of the harbor, in the same manner as on the\r\ngrassy plains near the Parana; and every evening they took flight\r\nseaward. From these facts I suspect that the Rhynchops generally\r\nfishes by night, at which time many of the lower animals come most\r\nabundantly to the surface. M. Lesson states that he has seen these\r\nbirds opening the shells of the mactrae buried in the sandbanks on the\r\ncoast of Chile; from their weak bills, with the lower mandible so much\r\nprojecting, their short legs and long wings, it is very improbable\r\nthat this can be a general habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONDOR\r\n\r\n(FROM A JOURNAL OF RESEARCHES, ETC.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis day I shot a condor. It measured from tip to tip of the wings\r\neight and a half feet, and from beak to tail, four feet. This bird is\r\nknown to have a wide geographical range, being found on the west coast\r\nof South America, from the Strait of Magellan along the Cordillera as\r\nfar as eight degrees north of the equator. The steep cliff near the\r\nmouth of the Rio Negro is its northern limit on the Patagonian coast;\r\nand they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great\r\ncentral line of their habitation in the Andes. Further south, among\r\nthe bold precipices at the head of Port Desire, the condor is not\r\nuncommon; yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the seacoast. A\r\nline of cliff near the mouth of the Santa Cruz is frequented by these\r\nbirds, and about eighty miles up the river, where the sides of the\r\nvalley are formed by steep basaltic precipices, the condor reappears.\r\nFrom these facts, it seems that the condors require perpendicular\r\ncliffs. In Chile, they haunt, during the greater part of the year, the\r\nlower country near the shores of the Pacific, and at night several\r\nroost together in one tree; but in the early part of summer, they\r\nretire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner Cordilleras, there\r\nto breed in peace.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their propagation, I was told by the country people in\r\nChile, that the condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of\r\nNovember and December lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare\r\nrock. It is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year;\r\nand long after they are able, they continue to roost by night, and\r\nhunt with their parents. The old birds generally live in pairs; but\r\namong the inland basaltic cliffs of the Santa Cruz, I found a spot,\r\nwhere scores must usually haunt. On coming suddenly to the brow of the\r\nprecipice, it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty\r\nof these birds start heavily from their resting-place, and wheel away\r\nin majestic circles. From the quantity of dung on the rocks, they must\r\nlong have frequented this place for roosting and breeding. Having\r\ngorged themselves with carrion on the plains below, they retire to\r\nthese favorite ledges to digest their food. From these facts, the\r\ncondor, like the gallinazo, must to a certain degree be considered as\r\na gregarious bird. In this part of the country they live altogether on\r\nthe guanacos which have died a natural death, or, as more commonly\r\nhappens, have been killed by the pumas. I believe, from what I saw in\r\nPatagonia, they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily\r\nexcursions to any great distance from their regular sleeping-places.\r\n\r\nThe condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height, soaring over a\r\ncertain spot in the most graceful circles. On some occasions I am sure\r\nthat they do this only for pleasure, but on others, the Chileno\r\ncountryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal, or the\r\npuma devouring its prey. If the condors glide down, and then suddenly\r\nall rise together, the Chileno knows that it is the puma which,\r\nwatching the carcass, has sprung out to drive away the robbers.\r\nBesides feeding on carrion, the condors frequently attack young goats\r\nand lambs; and the shepherd dogs are trained, whenever they pass over,\r\nto run out, and looking upwards to bark violently. The Chilenos\r\ndestroy and catch numbers. Two methods are used; one is to place a\r\ncarcass on a level piece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with\r\nan opening, and when the condors are gorged, to gallop up on horseback\r\nto the entrance, and thus enclose them; for when this bird has not\r\nspace to run, it cannot give its body sufficient momentum to rise from\r\nthe ground. The second method is to mark the trees in which,\r\nfrequently to the number of five or six together, they roost, and then\r\nat night to climb up and noose them. They are such heavy sleepers, as\r\nI have myself witnessed, that this is not a difficult task. At\r\nValpariso, I have seen a living condor sold for sixpence, but the\r\ncommon price is eight or ten shillings. One which I saw brought in had\r\nbeen tied with rope, and was much injured; yet, the moment the line\r\nwas cut by which its bill was secured, although surrounded by people,\r\nit began ravenously to tear a piece of carrion. In a garden at the\r\nsame place, between twenty and thirty were kept alive. They were fed\r\nonly once a week, but they appeared in pretty good health. The Chileno\r\ncountrymen assert that the condor will live, and retain its vigor,\r\nbetween five and six weeks without eating; I cannot answer for the\r\ntruth of this, but it is a cruel experiment, which very likely has\r\nbeen tried.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is killed in the country, it is well known that the\r\ncondors, like other carrion-vultures, soon gain intelligence of it,\r\nand congregate in an inexplicable manner. In most cases it must not be\r\noverlooked, that the birds have discovered their prey, and have picked\r\nthe skeleton clean, before the flesh is in the least degree tainted.\r\nRemembering the experiments of M. Audubon, on the little smelling\r\npowers of carrion-hawks, I tried in the above-mentioned garden the\r\nfollowing experiment: the condors were tied, each by a rope, in a long\r\nrow at the bottom of a wall; and having folded up a piece of meat in\r\nwhite paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand\r\nat the distance of about three yards from them, but no notice whatever\r\nwas taken. I then threw it on the ground, within one yard of an old\r\nmale bird; he looked at it for a moment with attention, but then\r\nregarded it no more. With a stick I pushed it closer and closer, until\r\nat last he touched it with his beak; the paper was then instantly torn\r\noff with fury, and at the same moment, every bird in the long row\r\nbegan struggling and flapping its wings. Under the same circumstances,\r\nit would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog. The\r\nevidence in favor of and against the acute smelling powers of\r\ncarrion-vultures is singularly balanced. Professor Owen has\r\ndemonstrated that the olfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard\r\n(_Cathartes aura_) are highly developed; and on the evening when Mr.\r\nOwen's paper was read at the Zooelogical Society, it was mentioned by a\r\ngentleman that he had seen the carrion-hawks in the West Indies on two\r\noccasions collect on the roof of a house, when a corpse had become\r\noffensive from not having been buried: in this case, the intelligence\r\ncould hardly have been acquired by sight. On the other hand, besides\r\nthe experiments of Audubon and that one by myself, Mr. Bachman has\r\ntried in the United States many varied plans, showing that neither the\r\nturkey-buzzard (the species dissected by Professor Owen) nor the\r\ngallinazo find their food by smell. He covered portions of highly\r\noffensive offal with a thin canvas cloth, and strewed pieces of meat\r\non it; these the carrion-vultures ate up, and then remained quietly\r\nstanding, with their beaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid\r\nmass, without discovering it. A small rent was made in the canvas, and\r\nthe offal was immediately discovered; the canvas was replaced by a\r\nfresh piece, and meat again put on it, and was again devoured by the\r\nvultures without their discovering the hidden mass on which they were\r\ntrampling. These facts are attested by the signatures of six\r\ngentlemen, besides that of Mr. Bachman.\r\n\r\nOften when lying down to rest on the open plains, on looking upwards,\r\nI have seen carrion-hawks sailing through the air at a great height.\r\nWhen the country is level I do not believe a space of the heavens, of\r\nmore than fifteen degrees above the horizon, is commonly viewed with\r\nany attention by a person either walking or on horseback. If such be\r\nthe case, and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three\r\nor four thousand feet, before it could come within the range of\r\nvision, its distance in a straight line from the beholder's eye, would\r\nbe rather more than two British miles. Might it not thus readily be\r\noverlooked? When an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely\r\nvalley, may he not all the while be watched from above by the\r\nsharp-sighted bird? And will not the manner of its descent proclaim\r\nthroughout the district to the whole family of carrion feeders, that\r\ntheir prey is at hand?\r\n\r\nWhen the condors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot,\r\ntheir flight is beautiful. Except when rising from the ground, I do\r\nnot recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near\r\nLima, I watched several for nearly half an hour, without once taking\r\noff my eyes; they moved in large curves, sweeping in circles,\r\ndescending and ascending without giving a single flap. As they glided\r\nclose over my head, I intently watched from an oblique position, the\r\noutlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing; and\r\nthese separate feathers, if there had been the least vibratory\r\nmovement, would have appeared as if blended together; for they were\r\nseen distinct against the blue sky. The head and neck were moved\r\nfrequently, and apparently with force; and the extended wings seemed\r\nto form the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck, body, and tail\r\nacted. If the bird wished to descend, the wings were for a moment\r\ncollapsed; and when again expanded with an altered inclination, the\r\nmomentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards\r\nwith the even and steady movement of a paper kite. In the case of any\r\nbird _soaring_, its motion must be sufficiently rapid, so that the\r\naction of the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may\r\ncounterbalance its gravity. The force to keep up the momentum of a\r\nbody moving in a horizontal plane in the air (in which there is so\r\nlittle friction) cannot be great, and this force is all that is\r\nwanted. The movement of the neck and body of the condor, we must\r\nsuppose, is sufficient for this. However this may be, it is truly\r\nwonderful and beautiful to see so great a horde, hour after hour,\r\nwithout any apparent exertion, wheeling and gliding over mountain and\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UMBRELLA BIRD\r\n\r\n(FROM TRAVELS ON THE AMAZON.)\r\n\r\nBY SIR A. R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis singular bird is about the size of a raven, and is of a similar\r\ncolor, but its feathers have a more scaly appearance, from being\r\nmargined with a different shade of glossy blue. It is also allied to\r\nthe crows in its structure, being very similar to them in its feet and\r\nbill. On its head it bears a crest, different from that of any other\r\nbird. It is formed of feathers more than two inches long, very thickly\r\nset, and with hairy plumes curving over at the end. These can be laid\r\nback so as to be hardly visible, or can be erected and spread out on\r\nevery side, forming a hemi-spherical, or rather a hemi-ellipsoidal\r\ndome, completely covering the head, and even reaching beyond the point\r\nof the beak: the individual feathers then stand out something like the\r\ndown-bearing seeds of the dandelion. Besides this, there is another\r\nornamental appendage on the breast, formed by a fleshy tubercle, as\r\nthick as a quill and an inch and a half long, which hangs down from\r\nthe neck, and is thickly covered with glossy feathers, forming a large\r\npendant plume or tassel. This also the bird can either press to its\r\nbreast, so as to be scarcely visible, or can swell out, so as almost\r\nto conceal the forepart of its body. In the female the crest and the\r\nneck-plume are less developed, and she is altogether a smaller and\r\nmuch less handsome bird. It inhabits the flooded islands of the Rio\r\nNegro and the Solimoes, never appearing on the mainland. It feeds on\r\nfruits, and utters a loud, hoarse cry, like some deep musical\r\ninstrument; whence its Indian name, _Uera-mimbe_, \"trumpet-bird.\" The\r\nwhole of the neck, where the plume of feathers springs from, is\r\ncovered internally with a thick coat of hard, muscular fat, very\r\ndifficult to be cleaned away,--which in preparing the skins, must be\r\ndone, as it would putrefy, and cause the feathers to drop off. The\r\nbirds are tolerably abundant, but are shy, and perch on the highest\r\ntrees, and, being very muscular, will not fall unless severely\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UMBRELLA BIRD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMMING BIRDS\r\n\r\n(FROM THE NATURALIST IN NICARAGUA.)\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS G. BELT, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSoon after crossing the muddy Artigua below Pavon, a beautifully clear\r\nand sparkling brook is reached, coming down to join its pure waters\r\nwith the soiled river below. In the evening this was a favorite resort\r\nof many birds that came to drink at the pellucid stream, or catch\r\ninsects playing above the water. Amongst the last was the beautiful\r\nblue, green and white humming-bird; the head and neck deep\r\nmetallic-blue, bordered on the back by a pure white collar over the\r\nshoulders, followed by deep metallic-green; on the underside the blue\r\nneck is succeeded by green, the green from the centre of the breast to\r\nthe end of the tail by pure white; the tail can be expanded to a half\r\ncircle, and each feather widening towards the end makes the semicircle\r\ncomplete around the edge. When catching the ephemeridae that play above\r\nthe water, the tail is not expanded: it is reserved for times of\r\ncourtship. I have seen the female sitting quietly on a branch, and\r\ntwo males displaying their charms in front of her. One would shoot up\r\nlike a rocket, than suddenly expanding the snow-white tail like an\r\ninverted parachute, slowly descend in front of her, turning round\r\ngradually to show off both back and front. The effect was heightened\r\nby the wings being invisible from a distance of a few yards, both from\r\ntheir great velocity of movement and from not having the metallic\r\nlustre of the rest of the body. The expanded white tail covered more\r\nspace than all the rest of the bird, and was evidently the grand\r\nfeature in the performance. Whilst one was descending, the other would\r\nshoot up and come slowly down expanded. The entertainment would end in\r\na fight between the two performers; but whether the most beautiful or\r\nthe most pugnacious was the accepted suitor, I know not. Another fine\r\nhumming-bird seen about this brook was the long-billed, fire-throated\r\n_Heliomaster pallidiceps_, Gould, generally seen probing long,\r\nnarrow-throated red flowers, forming, with their attractive nectar,\r\ncomplete traps for the small insects on which the humming-birds feed,\r\nthe bird returning the favor by carrying the pollen of one flower to\r\nanother. A third species, also seen at this brook, _Petasophora\r\ndelphinae_, Less., is of a dull brown color, with brilliant\r\near-feathers and metallic-green throat. Both it and the _Florisuga\r\nmellivora_ are short billed, generally catching flying insects, and do\r\nnot frequent flowers so much as other humming-birds. I have seen the\r\n_Petasophora_ fly into the centre of a dancing column of midges and\r\nrapidly darting first at one end then at another secure half a dozen\r\nof the tiny flies before the column was broken up; then retire to a\r\nbranch and wait until it was re-formed, when it made another sudden\r\ndescent on them.... I have no doubt many humming-birds suck the honey\r\nfrom flowers, as I have seen it exude from their bills when shot; but\r\nothers do not frequent them; and the principal food of all is small\r\ninsects. I have examined scores of them, and never without finding\r\ninsects in their crops. Their generally long bills have been spoken of\r\nby some naturalists as tubes into which they suck the honey by a\r\npiston-like movement of the tongue; but suction in the usual way would\r\nbe just as effective; and I am satisfied that this is not the primary\r\nuse of the tongue, nor of the mechanism which enables it to be exerted\r\nto a great length beyond the end of the bill. The tongue, for one-half\r\nof its length, is semi-horny and cleft in two, the two halves are laid\r\nflat against each other when at rest, but can be separated at the will\r\nof the bird and form a delicate pliable pair of forceps, most\r\nadmirably adapted for picking out minute insects from amongst the\r\nstamens of the flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF A WONDERFUL CITY\r\n\r\n(FROM THE LIFE OF THE BEES.)\r\n\r\nBY MAURICE MAETERLINCK.\r\n\r\n(TRANSLATED BY MARIE JOSEPHINE WELSH.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere in their new home there is nothing--not a drop of honey nor a\r\nsingle landmark in the shape of a piece of wax. The bee has no data\r\nand no starting-point; he has nothing but the desolate nakedness of\r\nthe walls and the roof of an immense building. The walls are round and\r\nsmooth, but all is dark within.... The bee does not understand useless\r\nregrets, or if he does, he does not encumber himself with them. Far\r\nfrom being discouraged by the conditions which now confront him, he is\r\nmore determined than ever. The hive is no sooner set up in its proper\r\nplace than the disorder of the crowd begins to diminish, and one sees\r\nin the swarming multitude clear and definite divisions which take\r\nshape in a most unexpected manner. The larger part of the bees, acting\r\nprecisely like an army which is obeying the definite orders of its\r\nofficer, at once begins to form thick columns along the whole length\r\nof the vertical partitions of the hive. The first to arrive at the top\r\nhang on to the arch by the claws of their hind legs, those who come\r\nafter attach themselves to the first, and so on till long chains are\r\nformed which serve as bridges for the ever mounting crowd to pass\r\nover. Little by little these chains are multiplied with indefinite\r\nre-enforcements and interlacing each other become garlands, which,\r\nowing to the enormous and uninterrupted mounting of the bees upon\r\nthem, are transformed into a thick triangular curtain, or rather into\r\na sort of compact reversed cone, the point of which is attached to the\r\ntop of the hive; the base of which is about two-thirds of the total\r\nheight of the hive. Then the last bee, which would appear to be\r\nsummoned by some interior voice to join this group, mounts this\r\ncurtain, which is hung in the darkness, and little by little every\r\nmovement among the vast crowd ceases, and this strange reversed cone\r\nremains for many hours in a silence which might be called religious,\r\nand in a statuesqueness which in such a mass of life is almost\r\nstartling, waiting for the arrival of the mystery of the wax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLUSTER OF BEES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEE HIVE.]\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, without taking any notice of the wonderful\r\ncurtain from out of whose folds so magic a gift will come, without\r\neven appearing to be tempted to attach themselves to it, the rest of\r\nthe bees, that is all those who are on the floor of the hive, begin to\r\nexamine the building and to undertake the work which is necessary to\r\nbe done. The floor is carefully swept, dead leaves, twigs, grains of\r\nsand are transferred to a considerable distance one by one, for bees\r\nhave an absolute mania for cleanliness; so much is this the case that\r\nin the winter, when the extremely cold weather prevents them from\r\ntaking what bee lovers know as their \"flight of cleanliness,\" rather\r\nthan soil the interior of the hive they perish in enormous numbers,\r\nvictims of a disease of the stomach.\r\n\r\nAfter this cleaning up is done these same bees set themselves to work\r\nto carefully close up every opening which is round about the lower\r\npart of the hive. Finally when every crack has been carefully looked\r\nover, filled up and covered with propolis, they begin to varnish the\r\nwhole of the interior sides. By this time guardians are placed at the\r\nentrance of the hive, and very soon a number of the working bees start\r\non their first trip to the fields and begin to come back laden with\r\nnectar and pollen....\r\n\r\nLet us now lift up, so far as we may, one of the folds of this\r\ngarlanded curtain in the midst of which the swarm is beginning to\r\nproduce that strange exudation which is almost as white as snow, and\r\nis lighter than the down on a bird's breast. The wax which is now\r\nbeing made does not resemble at all that with which we are acquainted.\r\nIt is colorless, and may be said to be imponderable. It is the very\r\nsoul of the honey, which in its turn is the very spirit of the\r\nflowers, evolved by the bees in a species of silent and motionless\r\nincantation....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to follow the various phases of the secretion and\r\nof the manner in which the wax is evolved by the swarm which is just\r\nbeginning to build. The operation takes place in the midst of a dense\r\ncrowd which becomes constantly more and more dense, thus producing a\r\ntemperature favorable to the exudation of the wax in its first stage.\r\n\r\nHuber, who was the first to study these operations with marvellous\r\npatience, and sometimes not without personal danger, has written more\r\nthan fifty pages on the subject, but they are very confused. For\r\nmyself, as I am not writing a scientific book, I shall confine myself\r\nto describing what anybody can see if he will watch the movements of a\r\nswarm in a glass hive. At the same time I shall not fail to avail\r\nmyself of Huber's studies whenever they may prove to be of service. We\r\nmust admit at the very outset that the process by which the honey is\r\ntransformed into wax in the bodies of this mysterious curtain of bees\r\nis still hidden in mystery. All that we know is that after about\r\neighteen or twenty-four hours in a temperature so high that one might\r\nalmost imagine there was a fire in the hive, small, white, transparent\r\nscales appear at the opening of the four little pockets which are to\r\nbe found on each side of the abdomen of the bee. When the larger part\r\nof those who form the reversed cone have their abdomens decorated with\r\nthese little ivory plates, one of them may be seen, as if under the\r\ninfluence of a sudden inspiration, to detach itself from the crowd and\r\nclimb over the backs of its passive brethren until it reaches the apex\r\nof the cupola of the hive; attaching herself firmly to the top, she\r\nimmediately sets to work to brush away those of her neighbors who may\r\ninterfere with her movements. Then she seizes with her mouth one of\r\nthe eight scales on the side of her abdomen and chews it, clips it,\r\ndraws it out, steeps it in saliva, kneads it, crushes it, and makes it\r\nagain into shape as dexterously as a carpenter would handle a piece of\r\nveneering. Then when the substance has been treated so as to bring it\r\nto the desired size and to the desired consistency, it is affixed to\r\nthe very summit of the interior of the dome, and thus the first stone\r\nis laid of the new city, or rather the key-stone of the new city is\r\nplaced in the arch, for we are considering a city turned upside down,\r\nwhich descends from the sky and which does not arise from the bosom of\r\nthe earth as do terrestrial cities. Then she proceeds to apply to this\r\nkey-stone more of the wax which she takes from her body, and having\r\ngiven to the whole of her part of the work one last finishing stroke,\r\nshe retires as quickly as she came and is lost in the crowd; another\r\nreplaces her and immediately takes up the work where she has left it\r\noff, adds her own to it, puts that right which appears to her to be\r\nnot in conformity with the general plan, and disappears in her turn,\r\nwhile a third and a fourth and a fifth succeed her in a series of\r\nsudden and inspired apparitions, not one of whom finishes a piece of\r\nwork, but all bring to it their common share.\r\n\r\nNow there hangs from the top of the vault a small block of wax which\r\nis yet without form. As soon as it appears to be thick enough there\r\ncomes out of the group another bee bearing an entirely different\r\naspect from that of those which have preceded it. One may well believe\r\non seeing the certainty, the determination, with which he goes about\r\nhis work and the manner in which those who stand round about him look\r\non, that he is an expert engineer who has come to construct in space\r\nthe place which the first cell shall occupy, the cell from which must\r\nmathematically depend everything which is afterwards constructed.\r\nWhatever he may be, this bee belongs to a class of the sculpturing, of\r\nchisel working bees who produce no wax and whose function seems to be\r\nto employ the materials with which the others furnish them. This bee\r\nthen chooses the place of the first cell. She digs for a moment in the\r\nblock of wax which has already been placed in position, and builds up\r\nthe side of the cell with the wax that she picks from the cavity. Then\r\nin exactly the same way as her predecessors have done, she suddenly\r\nleaves the work she has designed; another impatient worker replaces\r\nher and carries it on another step, which is finished by a third one.\r\nIn the meantime others are working round about her according to the\r\nsame method of division of labor until the outer sides of each wall is\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nIt would almost seem that an essential law of the hive was that every\r\nworker should take a pride in its work, and that all the work should\r\nbe done in common, and so to speak, unanimously, in order that the\r\nfraternal spirit should not be disturbed by a sense of jealousy.\r\n\r\nVery soon the outline of the comb may be seen. In form it is still\r\nlenticular, for the little prismatic tubes of which it is composed are\r\nunequally prolonged, and they diminish as they get away from the\r\ncentre towards the extremities. At this moment it might be compared,\r\nboth in form and in thickness, to a human tongue hanging down from two\r\nof the sides of the hexagonal cells which are placed back to back.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first cells are constructed, the workers add a roof to\r\nthe second and so on to the third and to the fourth. These sets of\r\ncells are divided by irregular intervals, and they are calculated in\r\nsuch a manner that when they are made to receive their full\r\ncomplement, the bees always have room enough to move about between the\r\nparallel walls of the honeycombs.\r\n\r\nIt follows then that in making their original plan the different\r\nthicknesses of every honeycomb must be fixed upon, and at the same\r\ntime the alley-ways which separate each must be different in turn,\r\nand this width must be twice the height of a bee since they have to\r\npass each other between the upright combs.\r\n\r\nBut even the bees are not infallible, and they do not always work with\r\nexact mechanical certainty. When they find themselves in a difficult\r\nplace they sometimes make very great blunders. One often finds that\r\nthey leave too much, and often too little, space between the\r\nhoneycombs, and they remedy these faults as well as they\r\ncan--sometimes in finishing the comb which is too near another in an\r\noblique line, or sometimes when they have left too much space they\r\ninterpose a smaller comb between it.\r\n\r\nReamur, on this subject, says:--\"Since bees sometimes make mistakes\r\nand rectify them, this must be a proof that they possess the power of\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN BEE.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that bees make four different kinds of cells. There are\r\nfirst the \"royal cells\" which are exceptional and are of acorn shape.\r\nThen there are the large cells in which the male bees are reared, and\r\nin which provisions are stored when the flowers furnish forth of their\r\nabundance. Then there are the little cells which may be called the\r\n\"cradles of the working bees,\" which are also employed as ordinary\r\nstore-rooms. These generally occupy about eight-tenth's of the\r\ntotal surface of the combs in a hive; and finally there are a certain\r\nnumber of what may be called transition cells. Although these latter\r\nare inevitably irregular, the dimensions of the second or third type\r\nare so well calculated that when the decimal system was first\r\nestablished, and people were seeking an incontestable standard of\r\nmeasurement, it was the cell of the bee which was proposed first of\r\nall by Reamur. Each one of these cells is an hexagonal tube placed\r\nupon a pyramid form, and each honeycomb is formed of two strata of\r\nthese tubes, base to base, in such a way that the three lozenges which\r\nmake the pyramid-like base of one cell form at the same time the\r\npyramid-like bases of the three cells on the other side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORKER.]  [Illustration: DRONE.]\r\n\r\nIn these prismatic tubes the honey is stored away--and so that the\r\nhoney shall not trickle out as it would be likely to do if they were\r\nbuilt strictly horizontal--they are tilted up at the outer edge of an\r\nangle of four or five degrees.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the saving in wax,\" says Reamur, speaking of this marvellous\r\nbuilding, \"which is effected by this arrangement of the\r\ncells,--besides the fact that by this plan the comb may be filled\r\nwithout a single gap, there are other advantages in the way of the\r\nsolidity thus given.... Every possible advantage in the way of the\r\nsolidity of each cell is brought about by the manner of its\r\nconstruction, and by its place with reference to the rest of the cells\r\nin the comb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Students of geometry know,\" says Dr. Reid, \"that there are only three\r\nshapes that can be employed to divide a surface into, uniform spaces,\r\nthat shall be regular in shape, and without interstices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF CELLS CONSTRUCTED BY BEES.]\r\n\r\n\"They are the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular\r\nhexagon, which latter, in the matter of cell construction, is superior\r\nto the two first both from the point of view of strength and utility,\r\nand it is just this form that the bees have adopted, precisely as\r\nthough its advantages were familiar to them.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, the bottoms of the cells form three planes meeting at\r\none point, and it has been demonstrated that both in economy of labor\r\nand material this system of construction is the best--again, the angle\r\nof the inclination of the planes affects this question of economy:\r\nthis problem has been solved by the bees and confirmed by Maclaurin by\r\nabstruse mathematical calculations published in the \"Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Society of London.\"\"\r\n\r\nOf course I do not suppose for a moment that the bees themselves have\r\nmade these calculations, but on the other hand I do not believe that\r\nchance, or accidental circumstance has brought about, these results.\r\nThe wasps, for instance, have built hexagonal cells, but they have not\r\ndisplayed such ingenuity as the bees have done. Their combs have only\r\none course of cells, and they have not the foundation which serves the\r\nbees for their double rows. Hence there is less strength, more\r\nirregularity, and a loss of time, of material, and of room, which\r\nreally means that a quarter of the labor employed and a third of the\r\nspace occupied is lost. We also find certain other domesticated bees,\r\nnot so far progressed in civilization, which only build one row of\r\ncells for rearing their young, and which support horizontal combs one\r\nabove another on costly columns of wax. Their food store-cells, are\r\nlike a row of round pots, and the bees make but a clumsy use of the\r\nspaces between them. Indeed, when we compare their City with the\r\nWonderful City of the bees of which we are speaking, it is like\r\ncomparing a row of huts with a modern laid out city. If the result is\r\nnot charming, it is severely logical, and demonstrates the genius of\r\nthe race which is forever fighting to get the most out of matter,\r\nspace, and time.\r\n\r\nBuffon had a theory which has been revived once more, that the bees\r\ndid not intend to make hexagonal cells, but rather round ones, and\r\nthat owing to the crowding of the workers all around, the round ones\r\nbecame hexagonal. It is said also that crystals, fish-scales of\r\ncertain kinds, soap-bubbles, etc., follow the same law, and Buffon\r\nadvances this experiment to prove it. \"Take a vessel and fill it full\r\nwith peas or any other round grains, pour as much water upon them as\r\nwill fill the spaces between them, close the vessel tightly, and boil\r\nthe water. It will be found that the round peas have become six-sided.\r\nOne sees clearly that this must be so from purely mechanical causes;\r\neach one of the round grains tends in the course of swelling as it\r\nboils to fill up the utmost space that it can, and by the extension\r\nand pressure of all alike they become hexagonal. Each bee wishes to\r\noccupy as much room as possible in its allotted space, therefore as\r\nthe bodies of the bees are round or cylindrical, their cells become\r\nhexagonal because of the extension and pressure of all alike.\"\r\n\r\nHere then we see reciprocal obstacles working a wonder, somewhat in\r\nthe same way perhaps as the vices of men bring about a general virtue,\r\nso that the race odious, often so far as individuals are concerned, is\r\ntolerable in the mass. Broughman, Kirby, and Spence and others claim\r\nthat the observations of soap-bubbles and peas prove nothing in this\r\nconnection, for the effect of compression is only to produce irregular\r\nhexagonal forms, and does not explain the earlier form of the base of\r\nthe cells.\r\n\r\nTo this one might rejoin that there are more ways than one of dealing\r\nwith the blind law of necessity, for the wasp and the bumble-bee and\r\nmany other species in similar circumstances and with the same end in\r\nview, arrive at very different, and manifestly inferior, results.\r\nIndeed it might be said further that even if the bee-cells did conform\r\nto the laws of crystallization as in the case of snow, or Buffon's\r\nsoap-bubbles, or boiled peas, they show also in their general\r\nsymmetry, in their well-determined angle of inclination, etc., that\r\nthere are many other laws not followed by inert matter to which they\r\nalso conform.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure myself that the hexagonal form of the cell was the\r\noutcome of the bee-brain, I cut out from the centre of a honey-comb a\r\nround piece not quite so large as a silver dollar, containing both\r\nbrood-cells and honey-cells. I cut into this disc, at the point where\r\nthe pyramidal bases of the cells were joined, and I fixed on the base\r\nof the section thus exposed a piece of tin of the same size, and so\r\nstout that the bees could not bend or twist it. Then I replaced the\r\ndisc of comb, with the piece of tin as described. One side of the comb\r\nshowed, of course, nothing extraordinary, but on the other side was to\r\nbe seen a hole at the bottom of which was a round piece of tin\r\noccupying the place of about thirty cells. At first the bees were\r\ndisconcerted, and came in crowds to examine and study this wonderful\r\nabyss; for some days they wandered about it in agitation without\r\ncoming to any decision. But as I fed them well every evening, the time\r\nsoon came when they needed more cells in which to store their\r\nprovisions. Then most likely the famous engineers, the sculptors, and\r\nthe waxmakers, were summoned to show the way to fill up this useless\r\nchasm.\r\n\r\nA heavy curtain, or garland, of the wax-making bees covered the spot\r\nso as to develop the necessary heat; others went down into the hole\r\nand began the work of solidly fixing the metal in place by means of\r\nlittle claws of wax around its entire circumference, attaching them to\r\nthe walls of the cells which surrounded it. Then they set to work to\r\nmake three or four cells in the upper part of the disc, attaching them\r\nto these waxen claws. Each of these new cells was more or less\r\nunfinished at the top, so as to leave material wherewith to fasten it\r\nto the next cell, but below on the piece of tin was always three very\r\nclear, and precise angles from which would grow the three upright\r\nlines which regularly marked the outline of the first half of the next\r\ncell. After about forty-eight hours, although three or four bees at\r\nmost could work at the same time in the opening, the whole surface of\r\nthe piece of tin was covered with the outlines of the new cells. They\r\nwere certainly somewhat less regular than those in an ordinary\r\ncomb.... But they were all perfectly hexagonal; not a line was bent,\r\nnot an angle out of shape; nevertheless all the ordinary conditions of\r\nbee-life were changed. The cells were not dug out of a block of wax as\r\nHuber described, nor were they made according to Darwin, circular at\r\nfirst, and then made into hexagons by the pressure of their neighbors.\r\nHere was no question of reciprocal obstacles, seeing that the cells\r\nwere made one by one, and these first outlines were sketched on a kind\r\nof table. It would appear therefore that the hexagonal form is not the\r\nresult of any mechanical necessity, but that it forms the plan\r\nresulting from the experience, the intelligence, and the will of the\r\nbee. Another curious thing which I accidentally noticed was that the\r\ncells built upon the tin were not provided with any other floor than\r\nthe tin itself. The engineers of the working party evidently reasoned\r\nthat the tin was sufficient to retain the liquid honey, and that it\r\nwas not necessary, therefore, to line it with wax. But a little while\r\nafter, when some honey was placed in the cell, they probably found\r\nthat the metal effected some change in it, for upon taking counsel\r\ntogether they covered the surface of the tin with a kind of diaphanous\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to throw light on all the secrets of this geometrical\r\narchitecture, we shall find many more interesting questions to\r\nexamine--for example, that of the form of the first cells, which are\r\nattached to the roof of the hive--a form which is modified so that the\r\ncells can fit its curve and touch the roof at the greatest possible\r\nnumber of points.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary to notice also, not only the direction in which\r\nthe main streets of the hive run, but the alley-ways and passages\r\nwhich run in and out and around the comb, as much for the circulation\r\nof the air as for the traffic; and it should be remarked that these\r\nare planned so as to avoid long detours or confusion in the\r\ntraffic....\r\n\r\nBefore we leave this subject let us, only for a minute, stop to\r\nconsider the wonderful and mysterious way in which the bees make their\r\nplans and work together when they are occupied in carving out their\r\ncells, on both sides of the comb, where neither can see the other.\r\nLook through one of these transparent combs, and you will see clearly\r\nand sharply cut out in this diaphanous wax a network of prisms\r\narranged in so perfectly fitting a manner that one might think they\r\nwere stamped out of steel.\r\n\r\nThose who have never seen the inside of a hive can have little idea of\r\nthe appearance of these honeycombs. Let us take a countryman's hive in\r\nwhich the bee has been left free to work as he pleases. This\r\nbell-like shape is divided from top to bottom by five, six, eight, and\r\nsometimes ten, slices of wax, so to speak, perfectly parallel with\r\neach other, which take the exact shape of the curve of the walls of\r\nthe hive. Between each one of these slices is a space of about half an\r\ninch in which the bees move about. When they begin to build one of\r\nthese slices at the top of the hive, the wall of wax is quite thick,\r\nand hides entirely the fifty or sixty bees who are working on one side\r\nfrom the fifty or sixty at work on the other. Unless they have a sight\r\nwhich can pierce the most opaque bodies, neither can see what is doing\r\non the other side. Nevertheless, a bee on one side does not dig a hole\r\nor add a fragment of wax which does not correspond exactly with a\r\nprotuberance or a cavity on the other side. How do they contrive to do\r\nthis? How does it happen that one does not dig too far, and the other\r\nnot far enough?\r\n\r\nHow is it that every angle coincides in such magnificent perfection?\r\nWho tells the bee to begin here and to end there? Once again we must\r\nbe satisfied with the reply that does not answer: \"It is one of the\r\nmysteries of the hive.\" Huber has tried to explain it by saying that\r\nat certain intervals, by the pressure of their feet or their teeth,\r\nthey produce a slight projection of the wax on the other side of the\r\ncomb, or that they can determine the thickness of the block of wax by\r\nits flexibility, its elasticity, or some other physical property which\r\nit may possess; or, again, that their antennae are able to serve as\r\ncompasses in enabling them to examine what is going on in the darkness\r\nof the other side; or, last of all, he suggests that all the cells\r\nmathematically derive their shape and dimensions from those of the\r\nfirst row, which is built without the need of further concert on the\r\npart of the workers. But one can easily see that these explanations\r\nare not sufficient; the first are guesses which cannot be verified;\r\nthe others simply change but do not remove the mystery. But if it is\r\ngood to change a mystery as often as possible, it is never good to\r\nflatter one's self that to change it means to remove it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASPS\r\n\r\n(FROM THE NATURALIST IN NICARAGUA.)\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS G. BELT, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI one day saw a small black and yellow banded wasp hunting for\r\nspiders; it approached a web where a spider was stationed in the\r\ncentre, made a dart towards it--apparently a feint to frighten the\r\nspider clear of its web; at any rate it had that effect, for it fell\r\nto the ground, and was immediately seized by the wasp, who stung it,\r\nthen ran quickly backwards, dragging the spider after it, up a branch\r\nreaching to the ground until it got high enough, when it flew heavily\r\noff with it. It was so small, and the spider so heavy, that it\r\nprobably could not have raised it from the ground by flight. All over\r\nthe world there are wasps that store their nests with the bodies of\r\nspiders for their young to feed on. In Australia, I often witnessed a\r\nwasp combating with a large flat spider that is found on the bark of\r\ntrees. It would fall to the ground, and lie on its back, so as to be\r\nable to grapple with its opponent; but the wasp was always the victor\r\nin the encounters I saw, although it was not always allowed to carry\r\noff its prey in peace. One day, sitting on the sandbanks on the coast\r\nof Hobson's Bay, I saw one dragging along a large spider. Three or\r\nfour inches above it hovered two minute flies, keeping a little\r\nbehind, and advancing with it. The wasp seemed much disturbed by the\r\npresence of the tiny flies, and twice left its prey to fly up towards\r\nthem, but they darted away with it. As soon as the wasp returned to\r\nthe spider, there they were hovering over and following it again. At\r\nlast, unable to drive away its small tormentors, the wasp reached its\r\nburrow and took down the spider, and the two flies stationed\r\nthemselves one on each side the entrance, and would, doubtless, when\r\nthe wasp went away to seek another victim, descend and lay their own\r\neggs in the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASPS' NEST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAND-WASP.]\r\n\r\nThe variety of wasps, as of all other insects, was very great around\r\nSanto Domingo. Many made papery nests, hanging from the undersides of\r\nlarge leaves. Others hung their open cells underneath verandahs and\r\neaves of houses. One large black one was particularly abundant about\r\nhouses, and many people got stung by them. They also built their\r\npendent nests in the orange and lime trees, and it is not always safe\r\nto gather the fruit. Fortunately they are heavy flyers, and can often\r\nbe struck down or evaded in their attacks. They do good where there\r\nare gardens, as they feed their young on caterpillars, and are\r\ncontinually hunting for them. Another species, banded brown and yellow\r\n(_Polistes carnifex_), has similar habits but is not so common.\r\nBates, in his account of the habits of the sand-wasps at Santarem, on\r\nthe Amazon, gives an interesting account of the way in which they took\r\na few turns in the air around the hole they had made in the sand\r\nbefore leaving to seek for flies in the forest, apparently to mark\r\nwell the position of the burrow, so that on their return they might\r\nfind it without difficulty. He remarks that this precaution would be\r\nsaid to be instinctive, but that the instinct is no mysterious and\r\nunintelligible agent, but a mental process in each individual\r\ndiffering from the same in man only by its unerring certainty. I had\r\nan opportunity of confirming his account of the proceedings of wasps\r\nwhen quitting a locality to which they wished to return, in all but\r\ntheir unerring certainty. I could not help noting how similar they\r\nwere to the way in which a man would act who wished to return to some\r\nspot not easily found out, and with which he was not previously\r\nacquainted. A specimen of the _Polistes carnifex_ was hunting about\r\nfor caterpillars in my garden. I found one about an inch long, and\r\nheld it out towards it on the point of a stick. It seized it\r\nimmediately, and commenced biting it from head to tail, soon reducing\r\nthe soft body to a mass of pulp. It rolled up about one-half of it\r\ninto a ball, and prepared to carry it off. Being at the time amidst a\r\nthick mass of a fine-leaved climbing plant, before flying away, he\r\ntook note of the place where it was leaving the other half. To do\r\nthis, it hovered in front of it for a few seconds, then took small\r\ncircles in front of it, then larger ones round the whole plant. I\r\nthought it had gone, but it returned again, and had another look at\r\nthe opening in the dense foliage down which the other half of the\r\ncaterpillar lay. It then flew away, but must have left its burden for\r\ndistribution with its comrades at the nest, for it returned in less\r\nthan two minutes, and making one circle around the bush, descended to\r\nthe opening, alighted on a leaf, and ran inside. The green remnant of\r\nthe caterpillar was lying on another leaf inside, but not connected\r\nwith the one on which the wasp alighted, so that in running in it\r\nmissed it, and soon got hopelessly lost in the thick foliage. Coming\r\nout again, it took another circle, and pounced down on the same spot\r\nagain, as soon as it came opposite to it. Three small seed-pods, which\r\nhere grew close together, formed the marks that I had myself taken to\r\nnote the place, and these the wasp seemed also to have taken as its\r\nguide, for it flew directly down to them, and ran inside; but the\r\nsmall leaf on which the fragment of caterpillar lay, not being\r\ndirectly connected with any on the outside, it again missed it, and\r\nagain got far away from the object of its search. It then flew out\r\nagain, and the same process was repeated again and again. Always when\r\nin circling round it came in sight of the seed-pods down it pounced,\r\nalighted near them, and recommenced its quest on foot. I was surprised\r\nat its perseverance, and thought it would have given up the search;\r\nbut not so, it returned at least half a dozen times, and seemed to get\r\nangry, hurrying about with buzzing wings. At last it stumbled across\r\nits prey, seized it eagerly, and as there was nothing more to come\r\nback for, flew straight off to its nest, without taking any further\r\nnote of the locality. Such an action is not the result of blind\r\ninstinct, but of a thinking mind: and it is wonderful to see an insect\r\nso differently constructed using a mental process similar to that of\r\nman. It is suggestive of the probability of many of the actions of\r\ninsects that we ascribe to instinct being the result of the possession\r\nof reasoning powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASP AND HOLE IN THE SAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WASP AND ITS PREY\r\n\r\n(FROM THE INSTINCTS AND HABITS OF THE SOLITARY WASPS.)[6]\r\n\r\nBY G. W. AND E. G. PECKHAM.\r\n\r\n[6] Reprinted by permission from Bulletin No. 2, Series I, of The\r\nWisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMost graceful and attractive of all the wasps--as Fabre describes\r\nthem, the Ammophiles, of all the inhabitants of the garden, hold the\r\nfirst place in our affections. Not so beautiful as the blue\r\n_Pelopaeus_ nor so industrious as the little red-girdled _Trypoxylon_,\r\ntheir intelligence, their distinct individuality, and their obliging\r\ntolerance of our society make them an unfailing source of interest.\r\nThey are, moreover, the most remarkable of all genera in their\r\nstinging habits, and few things have given us deeper pleasure than\r\nour success in following the activities and penetrating the secrets of\r\ntheir lives. In our neighborhood we have but two species of\r\n_Ammophila_, _urnaria_ Cresson and _gracilis_ Cresson, both of them\r\nbeing very slender bodied wasps of about an inch in length, _gracilis_\r\nall black, and _urnaria_ with a red band around the front end of the\r\nabdomen. With two exceptions our observations relate to _urnaria_.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the summer we had often seen these wasps\r\nfeeding upon the nectar of flowers, especially upon that of the sorrel\r\nof which they are particularly fond, but at that time we gave them but\r\npassing notice. One bright morning in the middle of July, however, we\r\ncame upon one that was so evidently hunting, and hunting in earnest,\r\nthat we gave up everything else to follow her. The ground was covered,\r\nmore or less thickly, with patches of purslane, and it was under these\r\nweeds that our _Ammophila_ was eagerly searching for her prey. After\r\nthoroughly investigating one plant she would pass to another, running\r\nthree or four steps and then bounding as though she were made of\r\nthistledown and were too light to remain upon the ground. We followed\r\nher easily, and as she was in full view nearly all of the time we had\r\nevery hope of witnessing the capture, but in this we were destined to\r\ndisappointment. We had been in attendance on her for about a quarter\r\nof an hour when, after disappearing for a few moments under the thick\r\npurslane leaves, she came out with a green caterpillar. We had missed\r\nthe wonderful sight of the paralyzer at work, but we had no time to\r\nbemoan our loss for she was making off at so rapid a pace that we were\r\nwell occupied in keeping up with her. She hurried along with the same\r\nmotion as before, unembarrassed by the weight of her victim. Twice she\r\ndropped it and circled over it a moment before taking it again. For\r\nsixty feet she kept to open ground, passing between two rows of\r\nbushes, but at the end of this division of the garden, she plunged,\r\nvery much to our dismay, into a field of standing corn. Here we had\r\ngreat difficulty in following her, since far from keeping to her\r\nformer orderly course, she zigzagged among the plants in the most\r\nbewildering fashion, although keeping a general direction of\r\nnortheast. It seemed quite impossible that she could know where she\r\nwas going. The corn rose to a height of six feet all around us; the\r\nground was uniform in appearance, and, to our eyes, each group of corn\r\nstalks was just like every other group, and yet, without pause or\r\nhesitation, the little creature passed quickly along, as we might\r\nthrough the familiar streets of our native town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"She Hurried along, Unembarrassed by the Weight of Her\r\nVictim.\"]\r\n\r\nAt last she paused and laid her burden down. Ah! the power that has\r\nled her is not a blind, mechanically perfect instinct, for she has\r\ntravelled a little too far. She must go back one row into the open\r\nspace that she has already crossed, although not just at this point.\r\nNothing like a nest is visible to us. The surface of the ground looks\r\nall alike, and it is with exclamations of wonder that we see our\r\nlittle guide lift two pellets of earth which have served as a covering\r\nto a small opening running down into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe way being thus prepared she hurries back with her wings quivering\r\nand her whole manner betokening joyful triumph at the completion of\r\nher task. We, in the meantime, have become as much excited over the\r\nmatter as she is herself. She picks up the caterpillar, brings it to\r\nthe mouth of the burrow and lays it down. Then, backing in herself,\r\nshe catches it in her mandibles and drags it out of sight, leaving us\r\nfull of admiration and delight.\r\n\r\nHow clear and accurate must be the observing powers of these wonderful\r\nlittle creatures! Every patch of ground must, for them, have its own\r\ncharacter; a pebble here, a larger stone there, a trifling tuft of\r\ngrass--these must be their landmarks. And the wonder of it is that\r\ntheir interest in each nest is so temporary. A burrow is dug,\r\nprovisioned and closed up, all in two or three days, and then another\r\nis made in a new place with everything to learn over again.\r\n\r\nFrom this time (July thirteenth) on to the first of September our\r\ngarden was full of these wasps, and they never lost their fascination\r\nfor us, although owing to a decided difference between their taste and\r\nours as to what constituted pleasant weather all our knowledge of them\r\nwas gained by the sweat of our brows. When we wished to utilize the\r\ncool hours of the morning or of the late afternoon in studying them,\r\nor thought to take advantage of a cloud which cast a grateful shade\r\nover the sun at noonday, where were our Ammophiles? Out of sight\r\nentirely, or at best only to be seen idling about on the flowers of\r\nthe onion or sorrel. At such a time they seemed to have no mission in\r\nlife and no idea of duty. But when the air was clear and bright and\r\nthe mercury rose higher and higher, all was changed. Their favorite\r\nworking hours were from eleven in the morning to three in the\r\nafternoon, and when they did work they threw their whole souls into\r\nit. It was well that it was so, for they certainly needed all the\r\nenthusiasm and perseverance that they could muster for such wearisome\r\nand disappointing labor. Hour after hour was passed in search, and\r\noften there was nothing to show at the end of it, for, since the\r\ncaterpillars that they wanted were nocturnal species, most of them\r\nwere under ground in the day-time. The species observed by Fabre knew,\r\nby some subtle instinct, where to find the worm, and unearthed it from\r\nits burrow. _Urnaria_, on the contrary, never dug for her prey, but\r\nhunted on bare ground, on the purslane, and most of all on the\r\nbean-plants. These were examined carefully, the wasp going up and down\r\nthe stems and looking under every leaf, but the search was so\r\nfrequently unsuccessful that in estimating their work we are inclined\r\nto think that they can scarcely average one caterpillar a day. When\r\nthey were hunting over bare ground they often paused and seemed to\r\nlisten, and in the beginning we expected to see them burrow down and\r\ndrag a victim from under the soil, but this never happened.\r\n\r\nIn this species, as in every one that we have studied, we have a most\r\ninteresting variation among the different individuals, not only in\r\nmethods but in character and intellect. While one was beguiled from\r\nher hunting by every sorrel blossom she passed, another stuck to her\r\nwork with indefatigable perseverance. While one stung her caterpillar\r\nso carelessly and made her nest in so shiftless a way that her young\r\ncould only survive through some lucky chance, another devoted herself\r\nto these duties, not only with conscientious thoroughness, but with an\r\napparent craving after artistic perfection that was touching to see.\r\n\r\nThe method employed by the _Ammophilae_ in stinging their prey is more\r\ncomplex than that of any other predatory wasp. The larvae with which\r\nthey provision their nests are made up of thirteen segments, and each\r\nof these has its own nervous centre or ganglion. Hence if the\r\ncaterpillar is to be reduced to a state of immobility, or to state so\r\nnearly approaching immobility that the egg may be safely laid upon it,\r\na single sting, such as is given by some of the _Pompilidae_ to their\r\ncaptured spiders, will be scarcely sufficient. All this we knew from\r\nFabre's \"Souvenirs,\" and yet we were not at all prepared to believe\r\nthat any plain American wasp could supply us with such a thrilling\r\nperformance as that of the Gallic _hirsuta_, which he so dramatically\r\ndescribes. We were, however, most anxious to be present at the\r\nall-important moment that we might see for ourselves just how and\r\nwhere _Ammophila urnaria_ stings her victim.\r\n\r\nFor a whole week of scorching summer weather we lived in the bean\r\npatch, scorning fatigue. We quoted to each other the example of\r\nFabre's daughter Claire, whose determination to solve the problem of\r\n_Odynerus_ led to a sun-stroke. We followed scores of wasps as they\r\nhunted; we ran, we threw ourselves upon the ground, we scrambled along\r\non our hands and knees in our desperate endeavors to keep them in\r\nview, and yet they escaped us. After we had kept one in sight for an\r\nhour or more some sudden flight would carry her far away and all our\r\nlabor was lost.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, our day came. We were doing a little hunting on our\r\nown account, hoping to find some larvae which we could drop in view of\r\nthe wasps and thus lead them to display their powers, when we saw an\r\n_urnaria_ fly up from the ground to the underside of a bean leaf and\r\nknock down a small green caterpillar. Breathless with an excitement\r\nwhich will be understood by those who have tasted the joy of such a\r\nmoment, we hung over the actors in our little drama. The ground was\r\nbare, we were close by and could see every motion distinctly. Nothing\r\nmore perfect could have been desired.\r\n\r\nThe wasp attacked at once but was rudely repulsed, the caterpillar\r\nrolling and unrolling itself rapidly and with the most violent\r\ncontortions of the whole body. Again and again its adversary descended\r\nbut failed to gain a hold. The caterpillar in its struggles, flung\r\nitself here and there over the ground, and had there been any grass or\r\nother covering near by it might have reached a place of partial\r\nsafety, but there was no shelter within reach, and at the fifth attack\r\nthe wasp succeeded in alighting over it, near the anterior end, and in\r\ngrasping its body firmly in her mandibles. Standing high on her long\r\nlegs and disregarding the continued struggles of her victim, she\r\nlifted it from the ground, curved her abdomen under its body, and\r\ndarted her sting between the third and fourth segments. From this\r\ninstant there was a complete cessation of movement on the part of the\r\nunfortunate caterpillar. Limp and helpless, it could offer no further\r\nopposition to the will of its conqueror. For some moments the wasp\r\nremained motionless, and then, withdrawing her sting, she plunged it\r\nsuccessively between the third and the second, and between the second\r\nand the first segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASP PLUNGING HER STING INTO THE CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar was now left lying on the ground. For a moment the\r\nwasp circled above it and then, descending, seized it again, further\r\nback this time, and with great deliberation and nicety of action gave\r\nit four more stings, beginning between the ninth and tenth segments\r\nand progressing backward.\r\n\r\n_Urnaria_, probably feeling--as we certainly did--reaction from the\r\nstrain of the last few minutes, and a relief at the completion of her\r\ntask, now rested from her labors. Standing on the ground close by she\r\nproceeded to smooth her body with her long hind legs, standing in the\r\nmeantime, almost on her head, with her abdomen directed upward. She\r\nthen gave her face a thorough washing and rubbing with her first\r\nlegs, and not until she had made a complete and satisfactory toilet\r\ndid she return to the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nWe saw _Ammophila_ capture her prey only three times during the whole\r\nsummer, but from these observations and from the condition of her\r\ncaterpillars taken at various times from nests, her method seems to be\r\nwonderfully close to that of _hirsuta_, with just about the same\r\namount of variation in different individuals.\r\n\r\nThus in our second example, she stung the first three segments in the\r\nregular order, the third, the second, and lastly (and most\r\npersistently) the first. She then went on, without a pause, to sting\r\nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, stopping at this point and\r\nleaving the posterior segments untouched. In our first example, it\r\nwill be remembered, the middle segments were spared. The sting being\r\ncompleted, she proceeded to the process known as _malaxation_, which\r\nconsists in repeatedly squeezing the neck of the caterpillar, or other\r\nvictim, between the mandibles, the subject of the treatment being\r\nturned around and around so that all sides may be equally affected.\r\n\r\nIn our third case a caterpillar which we had caught was placed in\r\nfront of a wasp just after she had carried the second larva into her\r\nnest. She seemed rather indifferent to it, passing it once or twice as\r\nshe ran about, but finally picked it up and gave it one prolonged\r\nsting between the third and fourth segments. She then spent a long\r\ntime in squeezing the neck, pinching it again and again. It was then\r\nleft on the ground, and as she showed no further interest in it we\r\ncarried it home for further study.\r\n\r\nIn the three captures, then, that came under our observation, all the\r\ncaterpillars being of the same species and almost exactly of the same\r\nsize, three different methods were employed. In the first, seven\r\nstings were given at the extremities, the middle segments being left\r\nuntouched, and no malaxation was practised. In the second, seven\r\nstings again but given in the anterior and middle segments, followed\r\nby slight malaxation. In the third, only one sting was given but the\r\nmalaxation was prolonged and severe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF-CUTTING ANTS\r\n\r\n(FROM THE NATURALIST IN NICARAGUA.)\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS G. BELT, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNearly all travellers in tropical America have described the ravages\r\nof the leaf-cutting ants (_OEcodoma_); their crowded, well-worn paths\r\nthrough the forests, their ceaseless pertinacity in the spoliation of\r\nthe trees--more particularly of introduced species--which are left\r\nbare and ragged, with the mid-ribs and a few jagged points of the\r\nleaves only left. Many a young plantation of orange, mango, and lemon\r\ntrees has been destroyed by them. Again and again have I been told in\r\nNicaragua, when inquiring why no fruit-trees were grown at particular\r\nplaces, \"It is no use planting them; the ants eat them up.\" The first\r\nacquaintance a stranger generally makes with them is on encountering\r\ntheir paths on the outskirts of the forest crowded with the ants; one\r\nlot carrying off the pieces of leaves, each piece about the size of a\r\nsixpence, and held up vertically between the jaws of the ant; another\r\nlot hurrying along in an opposite direction empty handed, but eager to\r\nget loaded with their leafy burdens. If he follows this last division,\r\nit will lead him to some young trees or shrubs, up which the ants\r\nmount; and where each one, stationing itself on the edge of a leaf,\r\ncommences to make a circular cut, with its scissor-like jaws, from the\r\nedge, its hinder-feet being the centre on which it turns. When the\r\npiece is nearly cut off, it is still stationed upon it, and it looks\r\nas though it would fall to the ground with it; but, on being finally\r\ndetached, the ant is generally found to have hold of the leaf with one\r\nfoot, and soon righting itself, and arranging its burden to its\r\nsatisfaction, it sets off at once on its return. Following it again,\r\nit is seen to join a throng of others, each laden like itself, and,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, it hurries along the well-worn path. As it\r\nproceeds, other paths, each thronged with busy workers, come in from\r\nthe sides, until the main road often gets to be seven or eight inches\r\nbroad, and more thronged than the streets of the city of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SETS OFF AT ONCE ON ITS RETURN.]\r\n\r\nAfter travelling for some hundreds of yards, often for more than half\r\na mile, the formicarium is reached. It consists of low, wide mounds of\r\nbrown, clayey-looking earth, above and immediately around which the\r\nbushes have been killed by their buds and leaves having been\r\npersistently bitten off as they attempted to grow after their first\r\ndefoliation. Under high trees in the thick forest the ants do not make\r\ntheir nests, because, I believe, the ventilation of their underground\r\ngalleries, about which they are very particular, would be interfered\r\nwith, and perhaps to avoid the drip from the trees. It is on the\r\noutskirts of the forest, or around clearings, or near wide roads that\r\nlet in the sun, that these formicariums are generally found. Numerous\r\nround tunnels, varying from half an inch to seven or eight inches in\r\ndiameter, lead down through the mounds of earth; and many more, from\r\nsome distance around, also lead underneath them. At some of the holes\r\non the mounds ants will be seen busily at work, bringing up little\r\npellets of earth from below, and casting them down on the\r\never-increasing mounds, so that its surface is nearly always fresh and\r\nnew-looking.\r\n\r\nStanding near the mounds, one sees from every point of the compass\r\nant-paths leading to them, all thronged with the busy workers carrying\r\ntheir leafy burdens. As far as the eye can distinguish their tiny\r\nforms, troops upon troops of leaves are moving up towards the central\r\npoint, and disappearing down the numerous tunnelled passages. The\r\noutgoing, empty-handed hosts are partly concealed amongst the bulky\r\nburdens of the incomers, and can only be distinguished by looking\r\nclosely amongst them. The ceaseless, toiling hosts impress one with\r\ntheir power, and one asks--What forests can stand before such\r\ninvaders? How is it that vegetation is not eaten off the face of the\r\nearth? Surely nowhere but in the tropics, where the recuperative\r\npowers of nature are immense and ever active, could such devastation\r\nbe withstood.\r\n\r\nFurther acquaintance with the subject will teach the inquirer that,\r\njust as many insects are preserved by being distasteful to\r\ninsectivorous birds, so very many of the forest trees are protected\r\nfrom the ravages of the ants by their leaves either being distasteful\r\nto them, or unfitted for the purpose for which they are required,\r\nwhilst some have special means of defence against their attacks.\r\n\r\nThese ants do not confine themselves to leaves, but also carry off any\r\nvegetable substance that they find suitable for growing the fungus on.\r\nThey are very partial to the inside white rind of oranges, and I have\r\nalso seen them cutting up and carrying off the flowers of certain\r\nshrubs, the leaves of which they neglected. They are very particular\r\nabout the ventilation of their underground chambers, and have numerous\r\nholes leading up to the surface from them. These they open out or\r\nclose up, apparently to keep up a regular degree of temperature below.\r\nThe great care they take that the pieces of leaves they carry into the\r\nnest should be neither too dry nor too damp, is also consistent with\r\nthe idea that the object is the growth of a fungus that requires\r\nparticular conditions of temperature and moisture to ensure its\r\nvigorous growth. If a sudden shower should come on, the ants do not\r\ncarry the wet pieces into the burrows, but throw them down near the\r\nentrances. Should the weather clear up again, these pieces are picked\r\nup when nearly dried, and taken inside; should the rain, however,\r\ncontinue, they get sodden down into the ground, and are left there. On\r\nthe contrary, in dry and hot weather, when the leaves would get dried\r\nup before they could be conveyed to the nest, the ants, when in\r\nexposed situations, do not go out at all during the hot hours, but\r\nbring in their leafy burdens in the cool of the day and during the\r\nnight. As soon as the pieces of leaves are carried in they must be cut\r\nup by the small class of workers into little pieces. I have never seen\r\nthe smallest class of ants carrying in leaves! their duties appear to\r\nbe inside, cutting them up into smaller fragments, and nursing the\r\nimmature ants. I have, however, seen them running out along the paths\r\nwith the others; but instead of helping to carry in the burdens, they\r\nclimb on the top of the pieces which are being carried along by the\r\nmiddle-sized workers, and so get a ride home again. It is very\r\nprobable that they take a run out merely for air and exercise. The\r\nlargest class of what are called workers are, I believe, the directors\r\nand protectors of the others. They are never seen out of the nest,\r\nexcepting on particular occasions, such as the migrations of the ants,\r\nand when one of the working columns or nests is attacked, they then\r\ncome stalking up, and attack the enemy with their strong jaws.\r\nSometimes, when digging into the burrows, one of these giants has\r\nunperceived climbed up my dress, and the first intimation of his\r\npresence has been the burying of his jaws in my neck, from which he\r\nwould not fail to draw blood. The stately observant way in which they\r\nstalk about, and their great size, compared with the others, always\r\nimpressed me with the idea that in their bulky heads lay the brains\r\nthat directed the community in their various duties. Many of their\r\nactions, such as that I have mentioned of two relays of workmen\r\ncarrying out the ant food, can scarcely be blind instinct. Some of the\r\nants make mistakes, and carry in unsuitable leaves. Thus grass is\r\nalways rejected by them, but I have seen some ants, perhaps young\r\nones, carrying leaves of grass; but after a while these pieces are\r\nalways brought out again and thrown away. I can imagine a young ant\r\ngetting a severe ear-wigging from one of the major-domos for its\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION THROUGH LEAF-CUTTING ANT'S NEST.]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this long account of the leaf-cutting ants with one\r\nmore instance of their reasoning powers.\r\n\r\nA nest was made near one of our tramways, and to get to the trees the\r\nants had to cross the rails, over which the wagons were continually\r\npassing and repassing. Every time they came along a number of ants\r\nwere crushed to death. They persevered in crossing for some time, but\r\nat last set to work and tunnelled underneath each rail. One day, when\r\nthe wagons were not running, I stopped up the tunnels with stones; but\r\nalthough great numbers carrying leaves were thus cut off from the\r\nnest, they would not cross the rails, but set to work making fresh\r\ntunnels underneath them. Apparently an order had gone forth, or a\r\ngeneral understanding been come to, that the rails were not to be\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WONDERFUL SPIDERS\r\n\r\n(FROM A JOURNAL OF RESEARCHES, ETC.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe number of spiders, in proportion to other insects, is here\r\ncompared with England very much larger; perhaps more so than with any\r\nother division of the articulate animals. The variety of species among\r\nthe jumping spiders appears almost infinite. The genus, or rather\r\nfamily of Epeira, is here characterized by many singular forms; some\r\nspecies have pointed coriaceous shells, others enlarged and spiny\r\ntibiae. Every path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow\r\nweb of a species belonging to the same division with the Epeira\r\nclavipes of Fabricius, which was formerly said by Sloane to make, in\r\nthe West Indies, webs so strong as to catch birds. A small and pretty\r\nkind of spider, with very long forelegs, and which appears to belong\r\nto an undescribed genus, lives as a parasite on almost every one of\r\nthese webs. I suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the\r\ngreat Epeira, and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects,\r\nwhich, adhering to the lines, would, otherwise be wasted. When\r\nfrightened, this little spider either feigns death by extending its\r\nfront legs, or suddenly drops from the web. A large Epeira of the same\r\ndivision with Epeira tuberculata and conica is extremely common,\r\nespecially in dry situations. Its web, which is generally placed among\r\nthe great leaves of the common agave, is sometimes strengthened near\r\nthe centre by a pair or even four zigzag ribbons, which connect two\r\nadjoining rays. When any large insect, as a grasshopper or wasp, is\r\ncaught, the spider by a dexterous movement, makes it revolve very\r\nrapidly, and at the same time emitting a band of threads from its\r\nspinners, soon envelops its prey in a case like the cocoon of a silk\r\nworm. The spider now examines the powerless victim, and gives the\r\nfatal bite on the hinder part of its thorax; then retreating,\r\npatiently waits till the poison has taken effect. The virulence of\r\nthis poison may be judged from the fact that in half a minute I opened\r\nthe mesh, and found a large wasp quite lifeless. This Epeira always\r\nstands with its head downwards near the centre of the web. When\r\ndisturbed, it acts differently according to circumstances: if there is\r\na thicket below, it suddenly falls down; and I have distinctly seen\r\nthe thread from the spinners lengthened by the animal while yet\r\nstationary, as preparatory to its fall. If the ground is clear\r\nbeneath, the Epeira seldom falls, but moves quickly through a central\r\npassage from one side to the other. When still further disturbed, it\r\npractises a most curious manoeuvre: Standing in the middle, it\r\nviolently jerks the web, which is attached to elastic twigs, till at\r\nlast the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement, that even the\r\noutline of the spider's body becomes indistinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR DIFFERENT SPIDERS.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that most of the British spiders, when a large insect\r\nis caught in their webs, endeavor to cut the lines and liberate their\r\nprey, to save their nests from being entirely spoiled. I once,\r\nhowever, saw in a hot-house in Shropshire a large female wasp caught\r\nin the irregular web of a quite small spider; and this spider, instead\r\nof cutting the web, most perseveringly continued to entangle the body,\r\nand especially the wings, of its prey. The wasp at first aimed in vain\r\nrepeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist. Pitying the\r\nwasp, after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour, I killed it\r\nand put it back into the web. The spider soon returned; and an hour\r\nafterwards I was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the\r\norifice, through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp. I\r\ndrove the spider away two or three times, but for the next twenty-four\r\nhours I always found it again sucking at the same place. The spider\r\nbecame much distended by the juices of its prey, which was many times\r\nlarger than itself.\r\n\r\nI may here just mention, that I found near St. Fe Bajada, many large\r\nblack spiders, with ruby-colored marks on their backs, having\r\ngregarious habits. The webs were placed vertically, as is invariably\r\nthe case with the genus Epeira; they were separated from each other by\r\na space of about two feet, but were all attached to certain common\r\nlines, which were of great length, and extended to all parts of the\r\ncommunity. In this manner the tops of some large bushes were\r\nencompassed by the united nets. Azara has described a gregarious\r\nspider in Paraguay, which Walckenaer thinks must be a Theridion, but\r\nprobably it is an Epeira, and perhaps even the same species with mine.\r\nI cannot, however, recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat,\r\nin which, during autumn, when the spiders die, Azara says the eggs are\r\ndeposited. As all the spiders which I saw were of the same size, they\r\nmust have been nearly of the same age. This gregarious habit, in so\r\ntypical a genus as Epeira, among insects, which are so bloodthirsty\r\nand solitary that even the two sexes attack each other, is a very\r\nsingular fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMPING SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I SAW IN AN ANT'S NEST\r\n\r\n(FROM FACTS AND FICTIONS OF ZOOeLOGY.)\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF TERMITES.]\r\n\r\nAmongst those spectacles and incidents in human existence which remain\r\nfixed on the memory of the spectator from their sad or unwonted\r\nnature, that of a panic-stricken crowd, gathered by the report of some\r\nnational disaster, stands pre-eminent. Still more terrible in its\r\ndetails is the history of some catastrophe which has laid a city in\r\nruins and wrought death and desolation to thousands of the\r\ninhabitants. A deadly epidemic, or fatal plague, searing a nation with\r\nits dread, mysterious power, is a calamity appalling enough; but the\r\nspectacle of a city overthrown at one fell swoop by the earthquake\r\nshock may perhaps rank foremost amongst the untoward incidents which\r\nenviron the sphere of man. A certain event, occurring during a recent\r\nholiday by the sea, tended forcibly to impress upon the mind that the\r\ngreat catastrophes of life are not limited to humanity's special\r\nsphere, and that in lower life panic and alarm seem to exercise no\r\nsmall influence, as in man's estate; whilst the incident referred to\r\nalso afforded food for reflection on topics not far removed from some\r\nweighty matters in the history of man's own nature and constitution.\r\nIn this latter view, it is especially hoped the observations of a\r\nbrief period of leisure-time may not be without their due meed of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe chance removal from its secure site, of a large stone placed in\r\nclose proximity to the sea-beach, where the bliss of idleness was\r\nbeing fully exemplified by a small party of holiday-makers, proved, on\r\nclose examination, to be the cause of a literal revolution in lower\r\nlife. Imagine a city to be totally unroofed, try to conceive of the\r\nsudden downfall of houses and buildings, and the consequent panic of\r\nthe inhabitants, and you may obtain an idea of the disturbance on\r\nsimple procedure effected in the peaceable, well-ordered colony of\r\nants which had located themselves securely beneath the friendly\r\nshelter of the stone. The scene presented to view was one of the most\r\ncurious and interesting which could engage the attention of an\r\nobserver in any field of inquiry, and the occurrence certainly\r\nbanished the idle mood of the time, and lent a zest to the subsequent\r\nhours of our holiday. Running hither and thither in wild confusion\r\nwere the denizens of this underground colony; their six little legs\r\ncarrying their curious globular bodies backward and forward over the\r\ndisturbed area from which the stone had been removed. At first the\r\nmovements of the ants were extremely erratic and purposeless. Panic\r\nand alarm appeared to be the order of the day during the few minutes\r\nwhich elapsed after removal of the stone. But soon the eye could\r\ndiscern movements of purposive kind on the part of the alarmed\r\nresidents. There was \"racing and chasing\" in all directions: but the\r\nants which had at first radiated from the centre of disturbance, as if\r\non some definite quest, soon returned thereunto, and continued to\r\nadvance and retire from the field of action with tolerable regularity.\r\nNot less than sixty or seventy ants appeared to be engaged in this\r\nlabor of scouring the country around. The object of their repeated\r\njourneys in all directions was soon discovered. They were the\r\nself-appointed scouts, engaged in the work of reconnoitring. Such at\r\nleast is a fair interpretation of the acts of the ants, and such also\r\nis the conclusion borne out by the subsequent course of events. For,\r\nafter the scouts had spent a considerable time in their rapid journeys\r\nto the environments of the nest, a new set of ants appeared upon the\r\nscene, destined to perform a highly important series of labors.\r\n\r\nThe scouts continued their journeyings, and gave one the idea of a set\r\nof fussy individuals who were superintending, or even bullying, their\r\nnew neighbors, who appeared from amongst the ruins and debris of the\r\nant city, carrying in their mouths certain oval bodies of a\r\ndirty-white color, and measuring each about one-third of an inch in\r\nlength. Each of these bodies closely resembled a grain of corn in\r\nshape, size, and appearance. The spectacle of these small insects\r\ncarrying off these bodies in their powerful jaws impressed one\r\nforcibly with the idea that, relatively to its size, an ant is an\r\nherculean insect.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there might be seen certain rather ludicrous incidents\r\nconnected with the removal of the objects in question. One ant might\r\nbe witnessed in the endeavor to hoist the oval body it was carrying in\r\nits mouth over some obstacle lying in the path, and the staggering\r\ngait of the insect seemed very accurately to mimic the similar\r\ndisposition of a human porter struggling under a burdensome load.\r\nAnother ant, carrying the oval body before it, would arrive at a steep\r\nincline formed of loose sand, and presenting a treacherous surface\r\neven to the light feet of the insect. The efforts of the ant to carry\r\nthe body upward being found to be fruitless, the insect might be seen\r\nto whirl about with great rapidity of action, and ascend the hill\r\nbackward, pulling the body after it, instead of pushing it as before.\r\n\r\nAnother instance might be witnessed in which an ant which had\r\nliterally come to grief with its burden would be assisted by a kindly\r\nneighbor; but it was no uncommon sight to behold in the excessive\r\neagerness of the insects an actual means of defeating the object they\r\nhad in view, since two ants would in some cases seize the same burden,\r\nand then came the tug of war. One pulled one way whilst the other\r\ntugged in the opposite direction; and the observer could almost have\r\nsupposed that the burden itself might have been parted in twain by the\r\ntreatment to which it was subjected--the incident affording a new\r\napplication of the remark that a surfeit of zeal is destructive of the\r\nbest intentions. The nature of the bodies which the ants seemed so\r\nexcessively anxious to preserve from injury was readily determined.\r\nThe oval bodies, resembling grains of corn, were the _pupae_ or\r\n_chrysalides_ of the ants--the sleeping babies and young hopefuls, on\r\nwhom the hopes of the colony were, and I may say, are, founded. It is\r\nnoteworthy, however, that upon some mistaken notions regarding the\r\nnature of these bodies many of the ideas concerning the frugal care of\r\nthese insects were founded. Solomon's advice that the sluggard should\r\n\"go to the ant,\" with the view of considering her ways and gaining\r\nwisdom as a result of the study, was in days of old thought to be\r\napproved by the observation that the ants husbanded their stores of\r\nfood in the shape of the grains of corn they had gained from the\r\nautumnal store. There can be little doubt that some species of ants do\r\nstore food; but their praiseworthy actions in this direction have been\r\ngreatly exaggerated, and there appears, indeed, to be some danger of\r\nidle persons being prepared with the retort to the wise man, that the\r\nant is by no means the model creature he thought her to be. If,\r\nhowever, the supposed corn-grains turn out to be the rising generation\r\nof ants in their chrysalis-state, it may be said that what the ants\r\nmay have lost in the way of fame in this direction has been amply\r\ncompensated for by the discovery of more wonderful traits of character\r\nthan Solomon could possibly have dreamt of.\r\n\r\nThe work of removing the developing population thus appeared in our\r\nant's nest to absorb the entire energies of the alarmed denizens. Pupa\r\nafter pupa was carried out from amongst the debris and taken for a\r\nconsiderable distance--certainly fifteen inches--to a place of\r\nsecurity, beneath a small sloping stone of flat shape, which roofed\r\nover a hollow in the ground. So far as I could observe, the scouts\r\nmust have discovered this place of refuge, and have communicated the\r\nintelligence to their neighbors. The regularity with which the\r\nslumbering innocents were conveyed to the same spot would appear to\r\npoint to concerted work and to a definite idea, if one may so term it,\r\nhaving animated the laborers. I was careful to ascertain at an early\r\nstage of the proceedings that the place of refuge had no\r\ncommunications with the nest. It was, in point of fact, an entirely\r\nnew habitation, and, as far as human judgment might venture upon an\r\nopinion, the new residence appeared to give promise of being a safe\r\nand convenient domicile. Now and then an ant would emerge from the\r\nruins of the nest carrying a younger hopeful in the larva or\r\ncaterpillar stage. This latter was a little white grub, which\r\ncorresponds in its development to the grub or caterpillar of the\r\nbutterfly or fly; the ants thus exemplifying insects which undergo a\r\ncomplete \"metamorphosis.\" It was rather a difficult matter to\r\nascertain clearly if the ants were actually excavating the chrysalides\r\nfrom amongst the debris. Bearing in mind what Sir John Lubbock has\r\ntold us concerning the apparent inability of ants to discover the\r\nwhereabouts of companions buried under earth, I rather lean to the\r\nbelief that my ants simply conveyed to a place of safety those\r\nchrysalides which were at hand and readily obtainable. The latter fact\r\nI could not ascertain, since I feared to disturb the ants at their\r\ninteresting labors; but a simple experiment served to show the\r\nfeasibility of the idea that the chrysalides were probably within\r\neasy reach of the ants.\r\n\r\nTaking possession of one chrysalis which was being conveyed to the new\r\ndomicile, I buried it about half an inch deep in the sand, directly in\r\nthe track over which the ants were journeying to their new residence,\r\nand a second chrysalis I placed at a little distance from this track,\r\nbut in a spot over which numerous ants were running apparently without\r\nany definite aim. The second pupa ant was not buried in any sense, and\r\nwas covered merely with a sprinkling of sand. The result in both cases\r\nwas negative. No attempt was made to disinter the chrysalis from the\r\nbeaten track, although numberless ants walked directly over it; and I\r\nextricated the chrysalis five hours after its interment, and when the\r\nbusy scene of the morning had been replaced by a dull prospect, over\r\nwhich only a single ant now and then hurried in a rapid fashion. The\r\nother chrysalis was also unnoticed, despite its proximity to the\r\nsurface of the sand. Whether or not ants want a sense of smell or\r\nother means of guiding them to the whereabouts of their neighbors or\r\nchildren, is a subject difficult of determination either toward a\r\npositive or negative result. And I am the more inclined to wonder at\r\nthe incapacity of the insects to discover their buried companions,\r\nsince they appear to be perfectly capable of detecting them at a\r\nconsiderable distance above ground. When a chrysalis was placed in a\r\nspot remote from the nest, and an ant placed within a foot or so of\r\nthe chrysalis, the insect would occasionally seem to be attracted to\r\nthe neighborhood of the object. I frequently observed that if an ant\r\nhappened to crawl within two or three inches of the chrysalis as it\r\nlay on the ground, it appeared to become conscious of the object,\r\nalthough at the same time it seemed ignorant of its precise locality.\r\nIn such a case the insect would proceed hither and thither in an\r\nerratic fashion, but would continue to hover or rotate around the\r\nchrysalis until it seized the object and bore it off in triumph in its\r\njaws. Relatively to the size of the ant, we must consider this latter\r\nincident by no means a slight tribute to its acuteness.\r\n\r\nThe busy scene resulting from the disturbance of the nest proceeded\r\nactively during at least two hours. The nest appeared to be by no\r\nmeans a large one. At the end of two hours, however, the ants were\r\nstill rushing hither and thither, bent on errands unknown to their\r\nobservers, although the work of conveying the chrysalides had at the\r\nlapse of the period just mentioned entirely ceased. Five and a half\r\nhours after the nest had been alarmed, not an ant was visible over the\r\ndisturbed area, and our next task was that of investigating the manner\r\nin which the insects had dispersed themselves and their belongings in\r\ntheir new habitation by carefully removing the flat sloping stone\r\nalready mentioned as that beneath which the main stream of the ants\r\nhad disappeared. Not an insect was to be seen after this operation was\r\nperformed, and it was only after the removal of several small stones\r\nwhich lay below the flat stone that the colony in its new sphere was\r\nbrought into view. Our investigation once again excited the restless\r\nbeings. Then ensued, for the second time, the seizure of the\r\nchrysalides, which, however, were to be seen packed together in a\r\nsecure position and already partly covered with particles of earth\r\nand sand. To have reached the position in which we found them, the\r\ninsects must have descended at least three inches after entering below\r\nthe stone, and the labor of the continual ascent in search of fresh\r\nchrysalides must therefore have been of no light kind. We saw enough\r\nto convince us that the ants had already settled down in a new\r\norganization, which, with an undisturbed history, might repeat the\r\npeaceful state of their former life; and we also had the thought\r\npresented, that in the exercise of their duties under the pressure of\r\nan unwonted exigency, the insect behaved and acted with no small\r\ndegree of intelligence, and apparently in harmonious concert to the\r\ndesired end.\r\n\r\nBut the thoughts suggested by the brief observation of the disturbed\r\nant's nest hardly end thus. We may very naturally proceed to inquire\r\ninto the regular organization and constitution of the ant colony, and\r\nalso, as far as fact and theory may together lead, into the\r\nanalogies--if analogies there be--which exist between the social\r\ninstincts of ants and the ways of the higher animals, man included.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. 1, Winged termite; 2, wingless termite; 3,\r\nsoldier; 4, worker; 5, female swollen with eggs.]\r\n\r\nThe common ants and their neighbors belong to the order of insects\r\nknown as the _Hymenoptera_, a group represented by other insects of\r\n\"social\" habits, such as bees, wasps, and hornets. The termites, or\r\nwhite ants of the tropics, are the only \"ants\" foreign to this order\r\nof insects, the white ants being near relations of the dragonflies,\r\nmay-flies, etc. The family history of the latter, as told by Mr.\r\nBates, may serve to introduce us agreeably to ant society at large.\r\nThe nests of the termites may attain a height of five feet, and\r\npresent the appearance of conical hillocks, formed of earth particles\r\n\"worked,\" says Mr. Bates, \"with a material as hard as stone.\" In the\r\nneighborhood of the nests, narrow covered galleries or underground\r\nways are everywhere to be seen, these latter being the passages along\r\nwhich the materials used for building the nests are conveyed. The\r\ntermites are small soft-bodied animals of a pale color, but resemble\r\nthe common or true ants in that they live in colonies, composed, like\r\nthose of bees, of three chief grades of individuals. These grades are\r\nknown as males, females, and blind \"neuters,\" the latter forming at\r\nonce the largest bulk of the population, and including in their\r\nnumbers the true \"working classes\" of this curious community. In the\r\ncommon ants, the \"neuters\" are regarded as being Undeveloped female\r\ninsects. These neuters exhibit in the termites a further division into\r\nordinary \"workers\" (Figs. 1, 4), which perform the multifarious duties\r\nconnected with the ordinary life of the colony, and \"soldiers\" (3),\r\nwhich perfectly exemplify the laws of military organization in higher\r\nlife, in that they have no part in the common labor, but devote\r\nthemselves entirely to the defence of the colony and to the\r\n\r\n   \"Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war.\"\r\n\r\nThe workers appear to perform a never-ending round of duties. They\r\nbuild the nests, make the roads, attend to the wants of the young,\r\ntrain up the latter in the ways of ant existence, wait on the\r\nsovereigns of the nest, and like diplomatic courtiers, duly arrange\r\nfor the royal marriages of the future. As Mr. Bates remarks, \"The\r\nwonderful part in the history of the termites is, that not only is\r\nthere a rigid division of labor, but nature has given to each class a\r\nstructure of body adapting it to the kind of labor it has to perform.\r\nThe males and females form a class apart; they do no kind of work, but\r\nin the course of growth acquire wings to enable them to issue forth\r\nand disseminate their kind. The workers and soldiers are wingless, and\r\ndiffer solely in the shape and armature of the head. This member in\r\nthe laborers is smooth and rounded, the mouth being adapted for the\r\nworking of the materials in building the hive. In the soldier the head\r\nis of very large size, and is provided in almost every kind with\r\nspecial organs of offence and defence in the form of horny processes\r\nresembling pikes, tridents, and so forth.... The course of human\r\nevents in our day seems, unhappily, to make it more than ever\r\nnecessary for the citizens of civilized and industrious communities to\r\nset apart a numerous armed class for the protection of the rest; in\r\nthis, nations only do what nature has of old done for the termites.\r\nThe soldier termite, however, has not only the fighting instinct and\r\nfunction; he is constructed as a soldier, and carries his weapons not\r\nin his hand but growing out of his body.\" When a colony of termites is\r\ndisturbed, the ordinary citizens disappear and the military are called\r\nout. \"The soldiers mounted the breach,\" says Mr. Bates, \"to cover the\r\nretreat of the workers,\" when a hole was made in the archway of one\r\nof their covered roads, and with military precision the rearmen fall\r\ninto the vacant places in the front ranks as the latter are emptied by\r\nthe misfortune of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. THE QUEEN ANT; AND THE WORKERS CARRYING AWAY\r\nTHE EGGS.]\r\n\r\nIn a termite colony there is but one king and queen, the royal couple\r\nbeing the true parents of the colony. The state-apartments are\r\nsituated in the centre of the hive, and are strictly guarded by\r\nworkers. Both king and queen are wingless, and are of larger size than\r\ntheir subjects. The queen engages in a continual round of maternal\r\nduties, the eggs deposited by the sovereign-mother being at once\r\nseized by the workers and conveyed to special or \"nursery cells,\"\r\nwhere the young are duly tended and brought up. Once a year, at the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season, winged termites appear in the hive as\r\ndevelopments of certain of the eggs laid by the queen-termite. These\r\nlatter are winged males and females (Fig. 1, 1), the two sexes being\r\npresent in equal numbers. Some of these, after shedding their wings,\r\nbecome the founders--kings and queens--of new communities, the\r\nprivilege of sex being thus associated with the important and\r\nself-denying work of perpetuating the species or race in time. Sooner\r\nor later--a termite family takes about a year to grow--a veritable\r\nexodus of the young winged termites takes place; and just before this\r\nemigration movement occurs, a hive may be seen to be stocked with\r\n\"termites\" of all castes and in all stages of development. The workers\r\nnever exhibit a change of form during their growth; the soldiers begin\r\nto differ from the workers in the possession of larger heads and jaws;\r\nwhilst the young which are destined to become the winged males and\r\nfemales are distinguished by the early possession of the germs of\r\nwings which become larger as the skin is successively moulted. Amongst\r\nthe bees, blind Huber supposed that an ordinary or neuter egg develops\r\ninto a queen bee if the larva is fed upon a special kind of\r\nfood--\"royal food,\" as it is called. Although some entomological\r\nauthorities differ from Huber with regard to the exact means by which\r\nthe queen bee is reared and specialized from other larvae, yet the\r\nopinion thus expressed possesses a large amount of probability.\r\nWhatever may be the exact method or causes through or by which the\r\nqueen bee is developed, Mr. Bates strongly asserts that the\r\ndifferences between the soldiers and worker termites are distinctly\r\nmarked from the egg. This latter observer maintains that the\r\ndifference is not due to variations in food or treatment during their\r\nearly existence, but is fixed and apparent from the beginning of\r\ndevelopment. This fact is worthy of note, for it argues in favor of\r\nthe view that if, as is most likely, the differences between the\r\ngrades of termites may have originally been produced by natural\r\nselection or other causes, these differences have now become part and\r\nparcel of the constitution of these insects, and are propagated by the\r\nordinary law of heredity. Thus acquired conditions have become in time\r\nthe natural \"way of life\" of these animals.\r\n\r\nMr. Bates has also placed on record the noteworthy fact that a species\r\nof termites exists in which the members of the soldier class did not\r\ndiffer at all from the workers \"except in the fighting instinct.\" This\r\nobservation, if it may be used at all in elucidation of the origin of\r\nthe curious family life of these insects, points not to sudden\r\ncreation, but to gradual acquirement and modification as having been\r\nthe method of development of the specialized classes and castes in\r\ntermite society. Firstly, we may thus regard the beginnings of the\r\nfurther development of a colony to appear in a nest in which workers\r\nand soldiers are alike, as stated by Mr. Bates. Then, through the\r\npractice of the fighting instinct, we may conceive that natural\r\nselection would be competent to adapt the soldiers more perfectly for\r\ntheir duties militant, by developing the head and jaws as offensive\r\nweapons. Possibly, were our knowledge of the termites at all complete,\r\nwe should meet with all stages in the development and specialization\r\nof the various grades of society amongst these insects--at least the\r\npresent state of our knowledge would seem to lead to such a conclusion\r\nas being much more feasible than the theory of special or sudden\r\ncreation of the peculiarities of the race. It is admitted that the\r\ntermites are in many respects inferior in structure to the bees and\r\nwasps, whilst the white ants themselves are the superiors of their own\r\norder--that of the _Neuroptera_. That the termites preceded the bees\r\nand their neighbors, the common ants, in the order of development of\r\nsocial instincts, is a conclusion supported by the fact that the\r\n_Neuroptera_ form the first group of insects which are preserved to us\r\nin the \"records of the rocks.\" Fossil _Neuroptera_ occur in the\r\nDevonian rocks of North America; the first traces of insects allied to\r\nthe bees and wasps being geologically more recent, and appearing in\r\nthe oolitic strata. The occurrence of high social instincts in an\r\nancient group of insects renders the repetition of these instincts in\r\na later and higher group the less remarkable. The observation,\r\nhowever, does not of necessity carry with it any actual or implied\r\nconnection between the termites and their higher neighbors, although,\r\nindeed, the likeness between the social life of the two orders of\r\ninsects might warrant such a supposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. RED, OR HORSE-ANT (_Formica rufa_.) a, male; b,\r\nfemale, winged; c, worker.]\r\n\r\nThe common ants (Fig. 3), the study of which in their native haunts is\r\na matter of no great difficulty, and one which will fully reward the\r\nseeking mind, like the termites, possess three grades of individuals.\r\nIn a single ant's nest more than One female may be found, the ants\r\ndiffering from the bees in this respect; and in the nests of some\r\nspecies of ants there are apparently \"soldiers\" resembling the\r\nmilitary termites in the possession of large heads and well-developed\r\njaws. Very amazing differences are to be perceived amongst the various\r\nspecies of ants. Differences in size are of common occurrence, but\r\nnaturalists have actually succeeded in classifying ants in a general\r\nway, by differences in manner and disposition. We know, for example,\r\nthat the horse-ant (_Formica rufa_, Fig. 3) has little _individual_\r\nintelligence, but is extremely socialistic, and moves and acts _en\r\nmasse_ with precision and tact. Another species (_F. fusca_) is timid\r\nand retiring. _F. pratensis_ is a revengeful creature, since it\r\n\"worries\" its fallen foes; _F. cinerea_ is bold and audacious; others\r\nare termed \"thieves\" and \"cowards\"; some are phlegmatic; and to\r\ncomplete the list of failings and traits which are human enough in\r\ncharacter, one species is said to present an invariable greediness as\r\nits prevailing characteristic. The common ants resemble the termites\r\nin the general details of their life. We see in an ant's nest the same\r\nrestless activity of the workers, the same earnest attention paid to\r\nthe young and pupae, the same instinct in shielding the young from\r\ndanger, and much the same general routine of development. Certain\r\nrather special, and it may be said extraordinary, habits of ants may,\r\nhowever, demand notice before we attempt a brief survey of their\r\ninstincts at large. Few readers are unacquainted with the _Aphides_,\r\nor plant-lice, those little wingless insects which infest our plants\r\nand herbs in myriads in summer. It is a fact now well known to\r\nnaturalists, and first placed on record by Huber, that between the\r\nants and plant-lice, relations of a very friendly and, as far as the\r\nants are concerned, advantageous character have become established.\r\nAnts have been observed to stroke the tips of the bodies of the\r\nplant-lice with their antennae, this act causing the plant-lice to\r\nexude drops of a clear, sweet fluid, of which the ants are extremely\r\nenamoured. The ants would thus appear to habitually \"milk\" their\r\ninsect-neighbors, and, as far as observation goes, some ants seem not\r\nmerely to keep the plant-lice in their nests so as to form a veritable\r\ndairy establishment, but also to make provision in the future by\r\nsecuring the eggs of the aphides, and bringing up the young as we rear\r\ncalves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 4. APPLE APHIS (_Eriosoma Mali_).]\r\n\r\nThat the relation between the ants and plant-lice are of very stable\r\nkind is proved by the interesting remarks of Mr. Darwin, who \"removed\r\nall the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant,\r\nand prevented their attendance during several hours.\" Careful watching\r\nshowed that the plant-lice after this interval did not excrete the\r\nsweet fluid. Mr. Darwin then stroked the plant-lice with a hair,\r\nendeavoring thus to imitate the action of the ant's feelers, but not a\r\nsingle plant-louse seemed disposed to emit the secretion. Thereafter a\r\nsingle ant was admitted to their company, the insect, in Mr. Darwin's\r\nwords, appearing, \"by its eager way of running about, to be well aware\r\nwhat a rich flock it had discovered.\" The ant first stroked one aphis\r\nand then another, each insect excreting a drop of the sweet juice \"as\r\nsoon as it felt the antennae;\" and \"even the quite young aphides\r\nbehaved in this manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and\r\nnot the result of experience.\" If, as Mr. Darwin remarks, it is a\r\nconvenience for the aphides to have the sweet secretion removed, and\r\nthat \"they do not excrete solely for the food of the ants,\" the\r\nobservation does not in any degree lessen the curious nature of the\r\nrelationship which has become established between the ants and their\r\nneighbors, or the interesting features in ant life which have\r\ninaugurated and perpetuated the habit.\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable are the \"slave-making\" instincts of certain\r\nspecies of ants. It may be safely maintained that the slave-making\r\nhabit forms a subject of more than ordinary interest not merely to\r\nnaturalists but to metaphysicians given to speculate on the origin and\r\nacquirement of the practices of human existence. Pierre Huber, son of\r\nthe famous entomologist, was the first to describe the slave-making\r\ninstincts in a species (_Polyergus rufescens_) noted for its\r\npredaceous instincts, and subsequent observations have shown that\r\nother species participate in these habits. _Polyergus_ is thoroughly\r\ndependent on slaves. Without these bonds-men it is difficult to see\r\nhow the ants could exist. Huber tells us that the workers of this\r\nspecies perform no work save that of capturing slaves. Use and wont,\r\nand the habit of depending entirely on their servitors, have produced\r\nsuch changes in the structure of the ants that they are unable to help\r\nthemselves. The jaws of these ants are not adapted for work; they are\r\ncarried by their slaves from an old nest to a new one; and, more\r\nextraordinary still, they require to be fed by their slaves, even with\r\nplenty of food close at hand. Out of thirty of these ants placed by\r\nHuber in a box, with some of their larvae and pupae, and a store of\r\nhoney, fifteen died in less than two days of hunger and of sheer\r\ninability to help themselves. When, however, one of their slaves was\r\nintroduced, the willing servitor \"established order, formed a chamber\r\nin the earth, gathered together the larvae, extricated several young\r\nants that were ready to quit the condition of pupae, and preserved the\r\nlife of the remaining Amazons.\" It must be noted that there are very\r\nvarying degrees in the dependence of the ant-masters on their slaves.\r\nIn the recognition of this graduated scale of relationship and\r\ndependence, indeed, will be found the clue to the acquirement of this\r\ninstinct. The horse-ant (_Formica rufa_) will carry off the larvae and\r\npupae of other ants _for food_, and it sometimes happens that some of\r\nthese captives, spared by their cannibal neighbors, will grow up in\r\nthe nest of their captor. A well-known ant, the _Formica sanguinea_,\r\nfound in the South of England, is however, a true slave-making\r\nspecies, but exhibits no such utter dependence on its servitors as\r\ndoes _Polyergus_. The slave-making habit is not only typically\r\ndeveloped in the _Sanguineas_, but the bearing of the captives to\r\ntheir masters indicate a degree of relationship and organization such\r\nas could hardly be conceived to exist outside human experience. The\r\n_Sanguineas_ make periodical excursions, and, like a powerful\r\npredatory clan, carry off the pupae or chrysalides of a neighboring\r\nspecies, _F. fusca_. Thus the children of the latter race are born\r\nwithin the nest of their captors in an enslaved condition. As slaves\r\n\"born and bred,\" so to speak, they fall at once into the routine of\r\ntheir duties, assist their masters in the work of the nest, and tend\r\nand nurse the young of the family. The slaves, curiously enough in\r\nthis instance, are black in color, whilst the masters are twice the\r\nsize of the servitors, and are red in color, and that the slaves are\r\ntrue importations is proved by the fact that males and females of the\r\nslave species are never developed within the nest of the masters, but\r\nonly within those of their own colonies. The slaves in this instance\r\nrarely leave the nest, the masters foraging for food, and employing\r\ntheir captives in household work, as it were; whilst, when the work of\r\nemigration occurs, the masters carry the slaves in their mouths like\r\nhousehold goods and chattels, instead of being carried by them, as in\r\nthe case of _Polyergus_.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin gives an interesting account of the different attitudes\r\nexhibited by the _Sanguineas_ toward species of ants other than the\r\nblack race from which their slaves are usually drawn. A few pupae of\r\nthe yellow ant (_F. flava_), a courageous and pugnacious little\r\nspecies, were placed within the reach of the slave-making\r\n_Sanguineas_. A like chance presented with the pupae of their slave\r\nrace was eagerly seized, and the chrysalides carried off. The pupae of\r\nthe yellow ants, however, were not merely left untouched, but the\r\nslave-makers exhibited every system of terror and alarm at the sight\r\nof the chrysalides of their yellow neighbors. Such an instance\r\ndemonstrates the existence not merely of perception but also of the\r\nmemory of past experience, probably of not over agreeable kind, of\r\nencounters with the yellow ants. When, on the contrary, a nest of the\r\nslaves is attacked, the _Sanguineas_ are both bold and wary. Mr.\r\nDarwin traced a long file of _Sanguineas_ for forty yards backward to\r\na clump of heath, whence he perceived the last of the invaders\r\nmarching homeward with a slave pupa in its mouth. Two or three\r\nindividuals of the attacked and desolate nest were rushing about in\r\nwild despair, and \"one,\" adds Mr. Darwin, \"was perched motionless,\r\nwith its own pupa in its mouth, on the top of a spray of heath, an\r\nimage of despair over its ravaged home.\" The picture thus drawn is not\r\nthe less eloquent because its subject is drawn from lower existence;\r\nalthough the pains and sorrows of ant life may not legitimately be\r\njudged by the standard of human woe.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the slave-making instinct in ants begins with the\r\nrecognition of the fact that many ants, not slave-makers, store up\r\npupae of other species for food. If we suppose that some of the pupae,\r\noriginally acquired through a cannibal-like instinct, came to maturity\r\nwithin the nest of their captors, and in virtue of their own inherited\r\ninstincts engaged in the work of the hive, we may conceive of a\r\nrational beginning of the slave-making instinct. If, further, the\r\ncaptors learned to appreciate the labors of their captives, as\r\nlightening their own work, the habit of collecting pupae as slaves\r\nmight succeed and supersede that of collecting them for food. In any\r\ncase, we should require to postulate on the part of the slave-makers a\r\ndegree of instinct altogether unusual in insects, or, indeed, in\r\nhigher animals; but that such instinct is developed in ants other than\r\nslave-makers admits of no dispute. The strengthening, through\r\nrepetition, of a habit useful to the species may thus be credited with\r\nthe beginning of the practice of slavery amongst ants; whilst special\r\ncircumstances--such as the number of the slaves as compared with the\r\nnumber of masters--would tend to develop a greater or less degree of\r\ndependence of the captors or their servitors.\r\n\r\nHuber, for instance, informs us that the _Fusca_-slaves of the\r\n_Sanguineas_ of Switzerland work with their masters in building the\r\nnest; they close and open the doors of the hive; but their chief\r\noffice appears to be that of hunting for plant-lice. In England, on\r\nthe contrary, the slaves are strictly household servants, rarely\r\nventuring out of doors. Such differences depend most probably on the\r\nfact that a greater number of slaves occur in Swiss than in English\r\nnests, and they may therefore be employed in a wider range of duties\r\non the Continent than at home. A fewer number of slaves, a greater\r\naptitude on the part of the slaves for their duties, the inability of\r\nthe masters to perform the duties of the slaves--each or all of these\r\ncauses combined would serve to increase the value of the servitors,\r\nand at the same time to reduce the independence of the masters.\r\n\r\nThis increase of the value of the slaves as active factors in the ant\r\ncommunity might at length proceed to such extremes as we see\r\nexemplified in the _Polyergus_, already referred to--a race which has\r\nbecome literally unable to feed itself, and to discharge the simplest\r\nduties of ant existence, and whose actual life is entirely spent in\r\nmarauding expeditions on the nests of its neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the general intelligence of ants, and of their ability\r\nto adapt themselves to awkward and unusual circumstances, may be\r\nbriefly touched upon by way of conclusion.\r\n\r\nBetween the reason and intelligence of higher animals and the\r\n\"instinct\" of ants there is unquestionably a great gulf fixed. I make\r\nthis statement unhesitatingly, notwithstanding that I should no more\r\nwillingly attempt to define \"instinct\" than to give an exact\r\ndefinition of \"insanity.\" In the latter case one may make the\r\ndefinition so limited as practically to exclude all save one class of\r\ncases, or so wide as to include even the judge on the bench. In the\r\ncase of instinct, the rigid definition of one authority might cause us\r\nto regard it as the exclusive property of lower forms and as having no\r\nrelationship whatever with the mental powers of higher beings; or, on\r\nthe other hand, as being but a modified form of, or in some respects\r\nidentical with, these very powers. We know too little respecting the\r\nso-called \"automatic\" powers and ways, even of higher animals, to\r\ndogmatize regarding the acts of lower animals, but we may safely\r\nassume that one apparent ground or distinction between instinct and\r\nreason may be found in the common incompetence of instinct to move out\r\nof the beaten track of existence, and in the adaptation of reason,\r\nthrough the teachings of experience, to new and unwonted\r\ncircumstances. Let Dr. Carpenter speak as an authority on such a\r\nsubject. \"The whole nervous system of invertebrated animals, then, may\r\nbe regarded as ministering entirely to _automatic_ action; and its\r\nhighest development, as in the class of insects, is coincident with\r\nthe highest manifestations of the 'instinctive' powers, which, when\r\ncarefully examined, are found to consist entirely in movements of the\r\nexcito-motor and sensori-motor kinds. (The terms '_excito-motor_' and\r\n'_sensori-motor_' are applied to nervous actions resulting in\r\nmovements of varying kinds, and produced by impressions made on\r\nnervous centres, but without any necessary emotion, reason, or\r\nconsciousness.) When we attentively consider the habits of these\r\nanimals, we find that their actions, though evidently adapted to the\r\nattainment of certain ends, are very far from evincing a _designed_\r\nadaptation on the part of the beings that perform them.... For, in the\r\nfirst place, these actions are invariably performed in the same manner\r\nby all the individuals of a species, when the conditions are the same;\r\nand thus are obviously to be attributed rather to a uniform impulse\r\nthan to a free choice, the most remarkable example of this being\r\nfurnished by the economy of bees, wasps, and other 'social' insects,\r\nin which every individual of the community performs its appropriated\r\npart with the exactitude and method of a perfect machine. The very\r\nperfection of the adaptation, again, is often of itself a sufficient\r\nevidence of the unreasoning character of the beings which perform the\r\nwork; for if we attribute it to their own intelligence, we must admit\r\nthat this intelligence frequently equals, if it does not surpass, that\r\nof the most accomplished Human Reasoner.\"\r\n\r\nAppealing to the most recent observations on ants, we may find\r\nevidence of the truth of Dr. Carpenter's statements, whilst at the\r\nsame time we may also detect instances of the development of higher\r\npowers which are hardly to be classed as \"automatic,\" and which, in\r\ncertain species (as in the _Ecitons_, charmingly described by Mr. Belt\r\nin \"The Naturalist in Nicaragua\"), may be said to be elevated above\r\nthe common instincts of the race. Dr. Henry Maudsley has also well\r\nsummed up the relationship of the acts of these insects to the acts of\r\nhigher forms, and to new adaptations when he says: \"I do not say that\r\nthe ant and the bee are entirely destitute of any power of adaptation\r\nto new experiences in their lives--that they are, in fact, purely\r\norganized machines, acting always with unvarying regularity; it would\r\nappear, indeed, from close observation, that these creatures do\r\nsometimes discover in their actions traces of a sensibility to strange\r\nexperiences, and of corresponding adaptations of movements. We cannot,\r\nmoreover, conceive how the remarkable instincts which they manifest\r\ncan have been acquired originally, except by virtue of some such\r\npower. But the power in them now is evidently of a rudimentary kind,\r\nand must remain so while they have not those higher nerve-centres in\r\nwhich the sensations are combined into ideas, and perceptions of the\r\nrelations of things are acquired. Granting, however, that the bee or\r\nant has these traces of adaptive action, it must be allowed that they\r\nare truly rudiments of functions, which in the supreme nerve-centres\r\nwe designate as reason and volition. Such a confession might be a\r\ntrouble to a metaphysical physiologist, who would thereupon find it\r\nnecessary to place a metaphysical entity behind the so-called\r\ninstincts of the bee, but can be no trouble to the inductive\r\nphysiologist--he simply recognizes an illustration of a physiological\r\ndiffusion of properties, and of the physical conditions of primitive\r\nvolition, and traces in the evolution of mind and its organs, as in\r\nthe evolution of other functions and their organs, a progressive\r\nspecialization and increasing complexity.\"\r\n\r\nThe recently published experiments of Sir John Lubbock show that ants\r\nunder certain circumstances are both stupid and devoid of any\r\nintelligent comprehension in the way of surmounting difficulties; but\r\nthis distinguished observer has also shown that as regards\r\ncommunication between ants, and in the regulation of the ordinary\r\ncircumstances of their lives, these insects evince a high degree of\r\nintelligence, and exhibit instincts of a very highly developed kind.\r\nStill, making every allowance for the development of extraordinary\r\nmental power in some species of ants, there can be little doubt of the\r\npurely automatic beginnings and nature of most, if not all, of the\r\nacts of ordinary ant existence. The young ant, wasp, or bee, will\r\nbegin its labors and discharge them as perfectly at the beginning of\r\nits existence as a perfect insect, as at the close of life. Here there\r\nis no experience, no tuition, no consciousness, no reason, and no\r\npowers save such as have been transferred to the insect as a mere\r\nmatter of heredity and derivation from its ancestors, who lived by an\r\nunconscious rule of thumb, so to speak. It is very hard at first to\r\nconvince one's self, when watching an ant's nest, that intelligence\r\nand consciousness play little or no part in the apparently intelligent\r\noperation of these insects. But to assume the contrary would be to\r\nmaintain that the insect stands on an equal footing to man himself,\r\nand for such a supposition there is neither lawful ground nor\r\nsympathy. The marvellous instinct of lower life stands on a platform\r\nof its own, has its own phases of development, and probably its own\r\nunconscious way of progress. The higher reason and intellect of\r\nhumanity similarly possesses its own peculiar standard, rate, and\r\nmethod of culture. A man may seek and find in the ways of lower\r\nexistence not merely a lesson in the ordering of his existence, but\r\nsome comfort, also, in the thought that the progress of lower nature\r\nis not unknown in the domain of human hopes and aspirations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETURN OF ANTS AFTER A BATTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD LLAMA\r\n\r\n(FROM A JOURNAL OF RESEARCHES, ETC.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF GUANACO.]\r\n\r\nThe guanaco, or wild Llama, is the characteristic quadruped of the\r\nplains of Patagonia; it is the South American representative of the\r\ncamel in the East. It is an elegant animal in a state of nature, with\r\na long slender neck and fine legs. It is very common over the whole of\r\nthe temperate parts of the continent, as far south as the islands near\r\nCape Horn. It generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to\r\nthirty in each; but on the banks of the St. Cruz we saw one herd which\r\nmust have contained at least five hundred.\r\n\r\nThey are generally wild and extremely wary. Mr. Stokes told me, that\r\nhe one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals which evidently\r\nhad been frightened, and were running away at full speed, although\r\ntheir distance was so great that he could not distinguish them with\r\nhis naked eye. The sportsman frequently receives the first notice of\r\ntheir presence, by hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill\r\nneighing note of alarm. If he then looks attentively, he will probably\r\nsee the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill. On\r\napproaching nearer, a few more squeals are given, and off they set at\r\nan apparently slow, but really quick canter, along some narrow beaten\r\ntrack to a neighboring hill. If, however, by chance, he abruptly meets\r\na single animal, or several together, they will generally stand\r\nmotionless and intently gaze at him; then perhaps move on a few yards,\r\nturn round, and look again. What is the cause of this difference in\r\ntheir shyness? Do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief\r\nenemy the puma? Or does curiosity overcome their timidity? That they\r\nare curious is certain; for if a person lies on the ground, and plays\r\nstrange antics, such as throwing up his feet in the air, they will\r\nalmost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him. It was an\r\nartifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success,\r\nand it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be\r\nfired, which were all taken as parts of the performance. On the\r\nmountains of the Tierra del Fuego, I have more than once seen a\r\nguanaco, on being approached, not only neigh and squeal, but prance\r\nand leap about in the most ridiculous manner, apparently in defiance\r\nas a challenge. These animals are very easily domesticated, and I have\r\nseen some thus kept in northern Patagonia near a house, though not\r\nunder any restraint. They are in this state very bold, and readily\r\nattack a man by striking him from behind with both knees. It is\r\nasserted that the motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of\r\ntheir females. The wild guanacos, however, have no idea of defence;\r\neven a single dog will secure one of these large animals, till the\r\nhuntsman can come up. In many of their habits they are like sheep in a\r\nflock. Thus when they see men approaching in several directions on\r\nhorseback, they soon become bewildered, and know not which way to run.\r\nThis greatly facilitates the Indian method of hunting, for they are\r\nthus easily driven to a central point, and are encompassed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUANACO.]\r\n\r\nThe guanacos readily take to the water: several times at Port Valdes\r\nthey were seen swimming from island to island. Byron, in his voyage, says\r\nhe saw them drinking salt water. Some of our officers likewise saw a\r\nherd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near Cape Blanco.\r\nI imagine in several parts of the country, if they do not drink salt\r\nwater, they drink none at all. In the middle of the day they frequently\r\nroll in the dust, in saucer-shaped hollows. The males fight together;\r\ntwo one day passed quite close to me, squealing and trying to bite each\r\nother; and several were shot with their hides deeply scarred. Herds\r\nsometimes appear to set out on exploring parties; at Bahia Blanca,\r\nwhere, within thirty miles of the coast, these animals are extremely\r\nunfrequent, I one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty, which had come\r\nin a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek. They then must have\r\nperceived that they were approaching the sea, for they had wheeled with\r\nthe regularity of cavalry, and had returned back in as straight a line\r\nas they had advanced. The guanacos have one singular habit, which is\r\nto me quite inexplicable; namely, that on successive days they drop\r\ntheir dung in the same defined heap. I saw one of these heaps which\r\nwas eight feet in diameter, and was composed of a large quantity. This\r\nhabit, according to M. A. d'Orbigny, is common to all the species of\r\nthe genus; it is very useful to the Peruvian Indians, who use the dung\r\nfor fuel, and are thus saved the trouble of collecting it.\r\n\r\nThe guanacos appear to have favorite spots for lying down to die. On\r\nthe banks of the St. Cruz, in certain circumscribed spaces, which were\r\ngenerally bushy and all near the river, the ground was actually white\r\nwith bones. On one such spot I counted between ten and twenty heads. I\r\nparticularly examined the bones; they did not appear, as some\r\nscattered ones which I have seen, gnawed or broken, as if dragged\r\ntogether by beasts of prey. The animals in most cases must have\r\ncrawled, before dying, beneath and amongst the bushes. Mr. Byron\r\ninforms me that during a former voyage he observed the same\r\ncircumstances on the banks of the Rio Gallegos. I do not at all\r\nunderstand the reason of this, but I may observe, that the wounded\r\nguanacos at the St. Cruz invariably walked towards the river. At St.\r\nJago in the Cape de Verd islands, I remember having seen in a ravine a\r\nretired corner covered with bones of the goat; we at the time\r\nexclaimed that it was the burial-ground of all the goats in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATS\r\n\r\n(FROM STUDIES OF ANIMATED NATURE.)\r\n\r\nBY W. S. DALLAS, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLEEPING BAT.]\r\n\r\nAmong the sounds which greet the ear of the wayfarer as the shades of\r\nevening deepen into night, one of the commonest is a rather faint\r\nchirping noise which comes mysteriously from overhead. On looking up\r\nin search of the source of this peculiar sound, we may see a small,\r\ndark, shadow-like creature sweeping to and fro with great rapidity. It\r\nis one of the curious groups of animals called Bats, representatives\r\nof which are to be met with in in all countries, always active at\r\nnight or in the twilight, and presenting a remarkable general\r\nsimilarity of structure, although in some respects they may differ\r\nconsiderably in habits. In the British Islands some fourteen species\r\nhave been distinguished.\r\n\r\nLike the owls, with which they share the dominion of the evening air,\r\nthe Bats have a perfectly noiseless flight; their activity is chiefly\r\nduring the twilight, although some species are later, and in fact seem\r\nto keep up throughout the whole night. As they rest during the day,\r\nconcealed usually in the most inaccessible places they can find, and\r\nare seen only upon the wing, their power of flight is their most\r\nstriking peculiarity in the popular mind, and it is perhaps no great\r\nwonder that by many people, both in ancient and modern times they have\r\nbeen regarded as birds. Nevertheless, their hairy bodies and leathery\r\nwings are so unlike anything that we ordinarily understand as\r\npertaining to a bird, that opinion was apparently always divided, as\r\nto the true nature of these creatures--\"a mouse with wings,\" as\r\nGoldsmith called it once, according to James Boswell, is certainly a\r\ncurious animal, and very difficult to classify so long as the would-be\r\nsystematist has no particularly definite ideas to guide him. The\r\nlikeness of the Bat to a winged mouse has made itself felt in the name\r\ngiven to the creature in many languages, such as the \"Chauvesouris\" of\r\nthe French and the \"Flitter-mouse\" of some parts of England, the\r\nlatter being reproduced almost literally in German, Dutch, and\r\nSwedish, while the Danes called the Bat a \"Flogenmues,\" which has\r\nabout the same meaning, and the Swedes have a second name, \"Laedermus,\"\r\nevidently referring to the texture of the wings, as well as to the\r\nmouse-like character of the body.\r\n\r\nBut so soon as we have definite characters to appeal to in\r\nclassification, we find no difficulty in assigning these puzzling\r\ncreatures to their proper place in the system. Bats produce their\r\nyoung alive, and suckle them; the milk being produced by special\r\nglands. Now, these are characters which are peculiar among all animals\r\nto the vertebrate class Mammalia. They possess also other characters\r\nthat are unmistakably mammalian. Leaving out of consideration the\r\nstructure of the internal organs, they have teeth implanted in sockets\r\nin the jaws, four limbs, and a hairy covering to the skin, so that\r\nthey possess more decidedly mammalian characters than some other\r\nmembers of the class, such as the marine whales and dolphins\r\n(_Cetacea_) and manatees (_Sirenia_), which are still often spoken of\r\nas fishes. In point of fact, although organized for flight, the Bat\r\nmay, without any violence to language, be spoken of as a _quadruped_,\r\nfor its fore-limbs contain all the parts found in those of other\r\nmammals fully developed, and they come into use when the creature is\r\nwalking on the ground.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the special characteristics of the Bats will be brought out\r\nmost distinctly by a comparison of their structure with that of a\r\nbird, seeing that the modification of the fore-limbs into wings is\r\ntheir most striking distinction from other Mammalia; for, although\r\nsome other members of the class are spoken of as \"flying,\" such as the\r\nFlying Squirrels, Flying Lemurs, and Flying Phalangers, these\r\ncreatures do not really fly, but merely glide through the air to\r\nconsiderable distances by the action of a broad fold of skin which\r\nruns down each side of the body, and which, when stretched between\r\nthe extended limbs, buoys the creatures up in the air after the\r\nfashion of a parachute.\r\n\r\nMost of us must have had occasion to pick the bones of a bird's wing,\r\na piece of practical anatomy which may serve us in good stead at\r\npresent. They consist of a long bone, which may be called the arm-bone\r\n(_humerus_), jointed to the shoulder-bones (the so-called \"side-bones\"\r\nof a fowl or turkey), followed by a pair of parallel bones\r\nconstituting the fore-arm, at the end of which we find two or three\r\nsmall bones, then two parallel bones united at their extremities, and\r\nsome smaller joints terminating the whole.\r\n\r\nWe need say nothing about the arm-bone and the two bones of the\r\nfore-arm, the peculiarity of bird-structure lying chiefly in the\r\nterminal portion of the limb, or the hand. Here we find, after two\r\nlittle bones forming the wrist, a pair of long bones as above\r\ndescribed, firmly united both at base and apex, and on the outside of\r\nthe base of these, close to the wrist, a small bone, which may be\r\neither free or soldered to the others, and which represents the thumb\r\nin the human hand. At the other end of the piece formed by the two\r\nunited bones, the limb is continued by two joints, forming a second\r\nfinger, inside of which there is usually a single small bone,\r\nrepresenting a third finger. But all these parts are stiffly attached\r\nto one another, admitting of very little motion, so that the whole\r\nhand forms as it were a single piece. The bony structure of the bird's\r\nwing is in point of fact a rod hinged in two places, at the elbow and\r\nthe wrist, for the convenience of being folded into a small compass.\r\nThe flight of the bird is effected by the agency of a number of stiff\r\nfeathers implanted in the skin covering the bones and muscles of the\r\narm and hand; these fold together like the sticks of a fan when the\r\nwing is folded, and are spread into an elastic instrument for striking\r\nthe air when the different sections of the bony framework are extended\r\nby the action of their respective muscles.\r\n\r\nIn the Bat the structure is very different. Of course, as in the\r\nVertebrata generally, we find in the Bat's fore-limb the same three\r\nmain sections as in birds; and as the function of the limb is the\r\nsame, and a certain stiffness is necessary in the extended organ, the\r\nmovements of the joints at the elbow and wrists are hinge-like. But\r\nthe bones of the arm and fore-arm are longer and more slender,\r\nespecially the latter; and in this part, in place of the two parallel\r\nbones of the bird's wing, we find in the Bat only a single long bone\r\nrepresenting the smaller bone of the bird, the larger one being\r\nusually reduced to very small dimensions, and firmly united with the\r\nother into a single piece, although it still forms the elbow-joint. At\r\nthe other end of this long fore-arm we find some small wrist-bones and\r\nto these the fingers are articulated. In birds, as we have seen, only\r\ntwo or three fingers are represented, and these are more or less\r\nreduced in size, and the most important of them soldered together;\r\nBats, on the contrary, show the whole five fingers as distinctly as in\r\nthe hand of man or any other mammals. The first of them, or the\r\n_thumb_, is short, slender, and flexible, and composed of three\r\njoints; the other four are very long and slender, but chiefly\r\ncomposed of the metacarpal bones, corresponding to those of the palm\r\nof the human hand. The first, or index finger, indeed, in many Bats,\r\nconsists of this bone alone; but in the others it is followed by two\r\nor three slender joints, gradually tapering to the extremity, the\r\nsecond finger, corresponding to our middle finger, being always the\r\nlongest of all.\r\n\r\nJust as is the bird's wing, these various parts can be folded together\r\nor extended by the action of the muscles, but in the Bat the long\r\nfingers become separated when the wing is stretched out, and by this\r\naction they at the same time stretch a thin leathery double membrane\r\nin which they are enclosed, which is thus converted into a broad\r\nsurface for striking the air in flight. This membrane is continued\r\nfrom the fingers to the sides of the body, and even to the hind limbs,\r\nwhich are often included in it to the ankle-joints; while in the great\r\nmajority of Bats there is even a further portion of membrane between\r\nthe hind legs, enclosing the whole or a portion of the tail. There is\r\nusually also a narrow strip of the same membrane in front of each arm,\r\nso that the skin of the animal is extended as much as possible, in\r\norder to give it support in its aerial evolution. It is to be noted\r\nthat the long second finger extends to the extreme point of the wing\r\nand that the first finger runs close beside it and thus assists in\r\nstiffening that part of the organ. The thumb is left free, and is\r\nfurnished with a rather strong hooked claw.\r\n\r\nSupported by the action of these great leathery wings, the Bat flies\r\nabout almost incessantly during the twilight, and often late into the\r\nnight. In full career its flight is swift, though perfectly\r\nnoiseless, and it has the power of executing rapid turns and changes\r\nof direction with the greatest facility, as required for the capture\r\nof its prey, which, in the great majority of cases, consists of the\r\ninsects of various kinds that in most places fly by night. In pursuit\r\nof these, the Bats flit rapidly about trees, houses, and other\r\nbuildings, now and then resting by clinging for a moment to the rough\r\nsurfaces of the walls or the trunks and branches of trees. Old country\r\nchurch-yards, which are usually full of trees, are naturally favorite\r\nhaunts of these nocturnal insect-hunters, offering them an excellent\r\nfield for the chase of their prey, while at the same time, the church\r\nitself, with its architectural peculiarities, usually affords them a\r\nsafe retirement during the day in the dark and secluded corners of its\r\nstructure. Hence in the popular mind the Bat has long been associated\r\nwith the church-yard, that spot so dreaded that few can pass through\r\nit after nightfall without experiencing certain peculiar feelings, so\r\nthat it is no great wonder if a portion of the superstitious fear thus\r\nengendered has transferred itself to these frail and harmless\r\ncreatures, and given them and their companions, the owls, something of\r\nan evil reputation. And it must be confessed that when seen against\r\nthe light, flitting silently overhead, there is something weird in the\r\nBat's form, and this is no doubt the reason why, while angels of all\r\nkinds are represented with birds' wings, those of Bats have, by\r\nuniversal consent, always been conferred upon demons, dragons, and\r\nsimilar uncanny creatures.\r\n\r\nWhen it descends from its flight upon the ground or any solid body,\r\nthe Bat becomes to all intents and purposes a genuine quadruped. The\r\nfingers being drawn together, with the membranes of the wings thrown\r\ninto folds between them, the whole hand of the creature is brought up\r\nparallel to the fore-arm, and so got out of the way, and the animal\r\ncan then walk more or less easily, its hind legs, though short and\r\nrather feeble, being perfectly formed, and the fore limbs, from which\r\nthe thumbs with their sharp claws now project freely, becoming\r\navailable for terrestrial progression. Nevertheless, this progression\r\nis generally rather clumsy, as indeed might be expected from creatures\r\nso curiously constructed.\r\n\r\nWhile on the wing, our Bats are constantly engaged in the pursuit of\r\nthe numerous insects of various kinds which, like themselves, are\r\nactive in the evening and after dark, and of these they must destroy\r\nimmense quantities. The swarms of delicate gnats and midges which\r\ndisport themselves in the most complicated aerial dances, moths of all\r\nkinds, and even the hard-shelled beetles, many of which fly about in\r\nthe evening or at night, fall a prey to these leathern-winged rovers\r\nof the night air, and weak as the latter would seem to be, some of\r\nthem are able to seize and devour beetles which appear to be far\r\nbeyond their powers. Thus, the largest of our British species, the\r\nGreat Bat, or Noctule (_Scotophilus noctula_), which, however, is only\r\nabout three inches in length, preys freely upon such large and\r\nhard-shelled insects as cockchafers; these, in fact, appear to be its\r\nfavorite food, and for their consumption its broad and comparatively\r\nstrong jaws would seem to be specially fitted, while its large and\r\npowerful wings, measuring fourteen or fifteen inches from tip to tip\r\nwhen expanded, enable it to fly with the rapidity necessary for the\r\npursuit and capture of such powerful prey. When thus engaged, the\r\nNoctule haunts the neighborhood of trees, and generally flies at a\r\nconsiderable elevation, from which, however, his shrill cry easily\r\nreaches the ear of the passer-by. His addiction to large prey gives\r\nrise to a curious movement, thus noticed by Professor Bell in his\r\nvaluable book on \"British Quadrupeds.\" \"An observer will not watch his\r\nmovements long,\" says the Professor, \"without noticing a manoeuvre\r\nwhich at first looks--like the falling of a tumbler-pigeon, but on\r\ncloser examination proves to be simply a closing of the wings, and a\r\nconsequent drop of about a foot. Sometimes, this is repeated every few\r\nyards, as long as in sight. It is occasioned by some large and\r\nintractable insect having been captured, and the anterior joint of the\r\nwing, with its well-armed thumb, is required in retaining it until\r\nmasticated.\" Notwithstanding this little difficulty, however, the\r\nNoctule is pretty rapid in disposing even of his most recusant prey,\r\nas he has been known to consume as many as thirteen cockchafers one\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements apply to all our British Bats, and indeed, in\r\nthe matter of food and general habits, to the great majority of the\r\nspecies of the order, in whatever country they may occur. But in the\r\ntropical and sub-tropical regions of the eastern hemisphere, we find a\r\ngreat and important group of Bats, which, although agreeing in general\r\nstructure and habits with our European species, differ from them\r\naltogether in their diet. These Bats, distinguished generally, among\r\nother things, by their larger size and more robust construction, and\r\nby certain characters of the molar teeth (grinders), from the ordinary\r\nBats, are almost exclusively confined to a fruit diet, in search of\r\nwhich they fly vigorously, often in flocks, like birds, at the\r\ncommencement of the night. From this peculiarity of their food they\r\nare commonly known as Fruit Bats, while the larger species, such as\r\nthe Indian Fruit Bat and the Kalong of the Eastern Archipelago, which\r\nare respectively eleven and fourteen inches in length, are sometimes\r\ncalled Flying Foxes, in allusion to the prevalence of a reddish tint\r\nin their fur, and their more or less lengthened and dog-like muzzles.\r\nIn many parts of the Eastern world, in India, the Malayan Archipelago,\r\nAustralia, Africa, and even in outlying islands at some distance from\r\ntheir main range, these Fruit Bats occur in great numbers. Swarms of\r\nthem roost together during the day, hanging from the branches of the\r\ntrees which they select as their regular resting-place, and taking\r\nwing at sunset, fly off frequently to great distances in search of\r\ntheir favorite articles of food; for they by no means devour\r\nindiscriminately any kind of fruit, but show a distinct preference for\r\nparticular sorts, generally selecting such as are also prized by their\r\nhuman competitors. Hence they often do considerable damage in\r\nplantations of fruit trees, as when they meet with articles that suit\r\ntaste, they seem, like some human gourmands, not to know when to leave\r\noff eating. Of one of the smaller Indian species, the Margined Fruit\r\nBat, Mr. Dobson obtained a living specimen in Calcutta, and he gives\r\nthe following account of its voracious appetite:--He gave it \"a ripe\r\nbanana, which, with the skin removed, weighed exactly two ounces. The\r\nanimal immediately, as if famished with hunger, fell upon the fruit,\r\nseized it between the thumbs and the index fingers, and took large\r\nmouthfuls out of it, opening the mouth to the fullest extent with\r\nextreme voracity. In the space of three hours the whole fruit was\r\nconsumed. Next morning the Bat was killed, and found to weigh one\r\nounce, half the weight of the food eaten in three hours! Indeed, the\r\nanimal when eating seemed to be a kind of living mill\"--so\r\ncontinuously does its food pass through it.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements of some writers, it would appear that although\r\nthese Bats live chiefly upon fruits, they occasionally, like many\r\nother frugivorous animals, diversify their diet with animal food,\r\ndevouring insects of various kinds, caterpillars, birds' eggs, and\r\neven young birds, while there seems to be some reason to believe that\r\none species even feeds upon shell-fish which it picks up upon the\r\nseashore.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-eating Bats of this group are not found in the warmer parts\r\nof America, but some American Bats feed chiefly upon fruits, while\r\nmany of the large essentially insectivorous species which occur there\r\nvary their diet more or less with fruits, and also occasionally attack\r\nand devour other vertebrate animals. Some of them--but it is still\r\nvery doubtful how many--have another habit connected with their\r\nfeeding, which renders them very decidedly objectionable, namely, that\r\nof inflicting wounds upon birds and mammals, even including man\r\nhimself, and sucking up the blood that flows from them. This charge\r\nhas been brought against many Bats of South and Central America,\r\nsome of which have been commonly named Vampires in consequence, after\r\nthe ghostly blood-suckers, which were formerly the objects of so much\r\nsuperstitious terror in Hungary and other parts of Eastern Europe; but\r\nso far as can be made out from a consideration of the evidence, a\r\nverdict of \"not proven,\" at all events, must be arrived at in the case\r\nof all but two species, which constitute a little group distinguished\r\nby what is apparently a special organization adapting them to this\r\npeculiar diet. These wretched little beasts, which only measure two\r\nand a half or three inches in length, are furnished in the upper jaw\r\nwith a single pair of incisor or front teeth, but these are of great\r\nsize and strength, triangular in form, and so excessively sharp that\r\nwhen the creatures are seized they can draw blood from the hand of\r\ntheir captor by what seems a mere touch. This extreme sharpness of\r\ntheir weapons enables them, when attacking sleeping men or animals, to\r\nslice off a small portion of skin almost without causing any pain, and\r\nthe little oval wounds thus produced, like the similar surface-cuts\r\nwhich a careless shaver sometimes inflicts upon his chin, bleed with\r\nparticular freedom. The Desmodonts, as these true Vampires are called,\r\nwill attack horses, mules, and cattle, which they generally wound on\r\nthe back, near the spine, often in the region of the withers; and they\r\nalso bite the combs of domestic fowls, and any part of the human body\r\nthat they can get at. In the case of man, however, according to most\r\nauthorities, the extremity of the great toe is the favorite part; and\r\nsome writers, perhaps possessed of a strong poetical vein, have given\r\nwonderful descriptions of the artfulness with which these little\r\nblood-suckers make their approaches, and keep their victim comfortably\r\nasleep during the operation by fanning him with their wings. In fact,\r\nthe Vampire Bats had so bad a reputation from the accounts given by\r\ntravellers, that they seemed to be veritable scourges of the countries\r\nin which they live, but so far as can be made out from the most\r\ntrustworthy reports, the mischief they cause may be summed up under\r\ntwo heads, namely, weakness produced by loss of blood, which continues\r\nto flow from the wounds long after the Bats have drunk their fill and\r\ngone quietly home to rest, and inflammatory affections, caused either\r\nby the irritation of the bite in the case of people of a bad habit of\r\nbody, or by the friction of the saddle or collar upon the part bitten\r\nin the case of horses and mules, or of the shoe in the human patient.\r\nThat the Desmodonts do really feed on blood is proved by evidence of\r\nvarious kinds. They have been captured in the act of blood-sucking,\r\nwhen their stomachs, which are peculiarly constructed and very long,\r\nare found filled with a black paste, which is evidently half-digested\r\nblood; and their teeth, which are in part so well adapted for\r\nproducing the necessary wounds in other animals, are totally unfit for\r\nthe mastication of an insect prey, such as constitutes the diet of\r\ntheir nearest allies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VAMPIRE BAT.]\r\n\r\nAfter all this feeding, Bats, whatever the nature of their diet, not\r\nunnaturally find themselves inclined for repose, and as they are\r\nactive during the night or in the twilight, of course their rest has\r\nto be taken in the daytime. To pass the period of repose in security\r\nthey seek shelter of various kinds, not only for protection against\r\nthe weather, but also for the sake of concealment from other\r\npredaceous animals, some of which would no doubt be perfectly willing\r\nto make a meal of them. The great Eastern Fruit Bats, trusting perhaps\r\nto their size and strength, are content to resort to the branches of\r\ntrees, from which, after the manner of Bats in general, they suspend\r\nthemselves by the hind feet with the head downwards. From the\r\nstatements of various writers it appears that after being out all\r\nnight in search of food, the Flying Foxes and other allied Bats fly\r\nback to their regular resting-places, where they begin to arrive about\r\nor soon after dawn. The number resorting to the same retreat is\r\nusually so great that the whole of the branches are loaded with them,\r\nand in fact they are so crowded together that the settling down of the\r\nflock into their repose is preceded by a scene of squabbling and\r\nquarrelling of the most noisy description. Mr. Tickell, speaking of\r\nthe common Indian Flying Fox, says:--\"From the arrival of the first\r\ncomer, until the sun is high above the horizon, a scene of incessant\r\nwrangling and contention is enacted among them, as each endeavors to\r\nsecure a higher and better place, or to eject a neighbor from too\r\nclose vicinage. In these struggles the Bats hook themselves along the\r\nbranches, scrambling about hand over hand with some speed, biting each\r\nother severely, striking out with the long claw of the thumb,\r\nshrieking and cackling without intermission. Each new arrival is\r\ncompelled to fly several times round the tree, being threatened from\r\nall points; and when he eventually hooks on, he has to go through a\r\nseries of combats, and be probably ejected two or three times, before\r\nhe makes good his tenure.\" This scene of selfish contention over, the\r\nFruit Bats pass some hours in profound sleep, during which they remain\r\nsuspended in rows along the branches, to which they cling by one foot\r\nonly, the other with all the lower surface of the body being\r\ncomfortably wrapped in the leathery mantle formed by the contracted\r\nwings. In this condition, as Dr. Horsfield says of the Great Kalong,\r\n\"ranged in succession with the head downwards ... and often in close\r\ncontact, they have little resemblance to living beings, and by a\r\nperson not accustomed to their economy are easily mistaken for a part\r\nof the tree, or for a fruit of uncommon size suspended from its\r\nbranches.\" In this position the head is folded down upon the breast.\r\nDr. Bennett and Mr. Gould ascribed very similar habits to a large\r\nFruit Bat common in the northern parts of New South Wales and in\r\nQueensland, which is said to be often exceedingly destructive to the\r\npeach and other fruit crops of the settlers in those colonies.\r\n\r\nThe European Bats, and indeed all the Bats except these Flying Foxes\r\nand their immediate allies, seek a different kind of shelter. Their\r\nchief natural dormitories consist of hollow trees and the caves and\r\nfissures of rocks, to which they often resort in great numbers; but in\r\npopulous countries they also find an abundance of convenient places of\r\nretirement in and about buildings of various kinds. Roofs, especially\r\nwhen covered with tiles, or otherwise provided with apertures through\r\nwhich the space immediately under the roofing is easily accessible,\r\noutbuildings of all kinds, church towers and other similar structures,\r\ndisused chimneys, the spaces behind weather-boards and shutters which\r\nare not often moved, in fact any dark and sheltered places about our\r\nbuildings, are readily resorted to by many species, although some few\r\nretain their taste for unadulterated nature so strongly that no\r\nartificial harbor will serve their turn. Thus among the British\r\nspecies the Great Bat or Noctule, a generally distributed though not\r\nabundant species throughout the southern and middle counties of\r\nEngland, seems generally to retreat for its diurnal sleep to the holes\r\nor cavities in the trunks of trees, and only to visit buildings when\r\nthere is a scarcity of such accommodation; and the Horseshoe Bats show\r\na decided preference for caverns and deserted quarries; but the great\r\nmajority appear to be indifferent in the matter, and to resort to any\r\nshelter that seems convenient to them. Some, such as the Barbastelle\r\nof the southern parts of England, are solitary in their habits,\r\ngenerally retiring alone for their day's rest; others are more\r\nsociable, reposing in larger or smaller parties in their dormitories,\r\nwhether natural or artificial, and sometimes, like the Fruit Bats,\r\ncollecting in immense numbers.\r\n\r\nThe common Bats, like the Fruit Bats, sleep in what we should consider\r\nan exceedingly uncomfortable position, namely, with their heads\r\ndownwards, but they cling by the claws of _both_ hind feet to the\r\nsmall irregularities of the stone or wood forming the walls and other\r\nparts of the structure of their retreat. They frequent the same places\r\nyear after year, so that, where they are numerous, the ground is often\r\ncompletely covered and discolored with their excrements, which in some\r\ncases accumulate in course of time to such an amount as to have given\r\nrise to the notion of carrying it away to be used as guano. The little\r\nblood-sucking Vampire Bats already mentioned take up their abode in\r\ncaverns, and, according to Dr. Hensel, who observed their habits, they\r\ndischarge their excrements, which are black and pasty, near the\r\nentrance of the cave just before starting on their evening flight, and\r\nthis substance by degrees forms quite a thick layer (one foot or more)\r\non the floor of the cavern. The Doctor says that a large dog which had\r\npaid a visit of curiosity to one of these caves came out again looking\r\nas if he had got long black boots on.\r\n\r\nIn the warmer regions of the earth's surface, where their supply of\r\nfood is constant, the activity of the Bats is not known to have any\r\nintermission, but in cold and temperate countries they pass the winter\r\nseason in a state of torpidity. The period of this hibernation, as it\r\nis called, varies somewhat in the different species, but few of them\r\nare to be seen flying about, except when the weather is decidedly\r\nmild. The commonest of all our British species, the Pipistrelle, has a\r\nshorter winter sleep than any of its companions, it usually makes its\r\nappearance on the wing by the middle of March, and continues active\r\nuntil quite late in the year; in fact Mr. Gould has recorded the fact\r\nof his having shot a specimen of it on a warm sunny day just before\r\nChristmas. For the purpose of hibernation the Bats retire to their\r\nusual resting-places, but frequently, instead of suspending themselves\r\nby their hind feet, as when sleeping, pack themselves away in small\r\nparties in holes and crevices, an arrangement which probably furnishes\r\na better protection against the inclemency of the season.\r\n\r\nIt is probably in the dormitory that the birth of the young bats takes\r\nplace--at least, so far as we know, the process is affected in a\r\nmanner which must preclude active exertions on the part of the mother\r\nfor some little time. The best account of the operation with which we\r\nare acquainted is that given fifty years ago by Mr. George Daniell, in\r\na paper read before the Zooelogical Society, in which he described the\r\nhabits of some Noctules kept by him in captivity. Four out of five\r\ndied, and the survivor, a female, was observed on 23d June to become\r\nvery restless, and to continue so for about an hour, although still\r\nsuspended by the hind limbs in the attitude of repose. \"Suddenly,\" to\r\nuse Mr. Daniell's words, \"she reversed her position, and attached\r\nherself by her anterior limbs to a cross wire of the cage, stretching\r\nher hind limbs to their utmost extent, curving the tail upwards, and\r\nexpanding the interfemoral membrane, so as to form a perfect nestlike\r\ncavity for the reception of the young ... which was born on its back,\r\nperfectly destitute of hair, and blind. The mother then cleaned it,\r\nturning it over in its nest; and afterwards, resuming her usual\r\nposition, placed the young in the membrane of her wing. She next\r\ncleaned herself, and wrapped up the young one so closely as to prevent\r\nany observation of the process of suckling. At the time of birth the\r\nyoung was larger than a new-born mouse, and its hind legs and claws\r\nwere remarkably strong and serviceable, enabling it not only to cling\r\nto its dam, but also to the deal sides of the cage. On the 24th the\r\nanimal took her food in the morning, and appeared very careful of her\r\nyoung, shifting it from side to side to suckle it, and folding it in\r\nthe membranes of the tail and wings.\" Unfortunately, these\r\ninteresting observations were cut short by the death of the mother,\r\nand the young animal, which was with some difficulty removed from the\r\nnipple, survived only eight days, during which it was fed with milk\r\nfrom a sponge, and made but little progress, its eyes being still\r\nunopened, and its body almost hairless.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this process, varied in minor points in\r\naccordance with differences of structure, reveals to us what takes\r\nplace in Bats generally in immediate connection with the birth of the\r\nyoung. From all the observations that have been made it appears\r\ncertain that the female Bats produce only a single young one at a\r\nbirth; that this is at first blind, naked, and helpless; and that the\r\nfemale nurses it carefully--a process which must be greatly\r\nfacilitated by the power of clinging to its parent possessed by the\r\nyoung Bat from the first moment of its appearance in the world. The\r\ntwo nipples possessed by the female are situated upon the breast,\r\nsometimes quite at the sides under the arm-pits, a position which\r\nrenders it particularly easy for the careful mother to tend her\r\noffspring, while she is also enabled to carry it about with her in her\r\nevening flights, the young creature clinging firmly to its mother's\r\nfur, and being quite out of the way of the movements of the wings.\r\nThis part of the business, of course, could not be exemplified in Mr.\r\nDaniell's case, as the female was imprisoned in a cage, but it is a\r\nwell-known fact in the natural history of these creatures that the\r\nmother does carry her young about with her so long as it continues\r\nhelpless. Apparently, indeed, even after the young animal becomes\r\ncapable of flying about, its mother still retains some interest in its\r\nwell-being--at least, if we may apply generally a case recorded by Dr.\r\nAllen in his account of the Bats of North America. It relates to a\r\nsmall species, the Red Bat, very common throughout the United States,\r\na young individual of which having been captured by a lad, \"three\r\nhours afterwards, in the evening, as he was conveying it to the museum\r\nin his hand, while passing near the place where it was caught, the\r\nmother made her appearance, and followed the boy for two squares,\r\nflying around him, and finally alighted on his breast, such was her\r\nanxiety to save her offspring. Both were brought to the museum, the\r\nyoung one firmly adhering to its mother's teat. This faithful creature\r\nlived two days in the museum, and then died of injuries received from\r\nher captor. The young one being but half grown was still too young to\r\ntake care of itself, and died shortly after.\"\r\n\r\nThis little anecdote seems to set the moral character of the Bat in a\r\nvery favorable light, at any rate as regards the family affections,\r\nand there is no doubt that the females of all the species of the group\r\nshow considerable fondness for their young. In other respects,\r\nperhaps, they do not all shine quite so brilliantly, for, as we have\r\nseen, the Fruit Bats squabble very selfishly for the most convenient\r\nsleeping places, as indeed do other gregarious species of the order,\r\nand some of the former quarrel and fight over their food. As regards\r\namiability of character, however, there is probably considerable\r\ndifference between different kinds of Bats; at any rate, in\r\nconfinement, they show much diversity of temper, some of them being\r\nsullen, refusing food, and biting vigorously at their captors or the\r\nbars of their prison, while others are easily tamed and soon become\r\nfamiliar. Two of the commonest species, the Pipistrelle, and the\r\nLong-eared Bat are among the latter. The Pipistrelle, which appears to\r\nbe abundant throughout Britain, and indeed in most of the northern\r\ntemperate regions of the eastern hemisphere, is a small reddish-brown\r\nspecies, measuring little more than one inch and a half in length\r\nwithout the tail, but with a spread of wing of more than eight inches.\r\nIts regular food consists chiefly of gnats, midges, and other small\r\nflies, in pursuit of which it often frequents the vicinity of water,\r\nbut it has a curious predilection for raw meat, and in search of this\r\nit often makes its way into pantries, where the little thief will be\r\nfound clinging to a joint of meat, and feeding upon it with avidity.\r\nThis fondness for meat makes the Pipistrelle very easy to keep in\r\nconfinement, as it diminishes the necessity of finding it insect food,\r\nand the little creature will in time become so tame as to take pieces\r\nof meat from its owner's fingers. It is an active and lively little\r\ncreature, flying, running, and climbing about with great ease; in the\r\nlatter operation, according to Professor Bell, it makes use of the\r\nextreme tip of the tail as if it was a finger.\r\n\r\nThe Long-eared Bat, so called from the great size of its ears, which\r\nare nearly as long as the whole animal exclusive of the tail, has\r\nperhaps a wider distribution than the Pipistrelle, but is hardly so\r\nabundant in Britain. Its head and body measure nearly two inches long,\r\nwhile its wings spread to about ten inches. This Bat generally sleeps\r\nduring the day under the roofs of houses and in church towers, and\r\nwhen sleeping its long ears are carefully stowed away under the folded\r\nwings, but the earlet or inner lobe of the ear still projects, so that\r\nthe creature appears to have a pair of short-pointed ears. The\r\nLong-eared Bat flies very late in the evening, and indeed seems to\r\ncontinue its activity throughout the night; its food appears to\r\nconsist to a great extent of the smaller moths, although other insects\r\nare by no means disdained. This species also soon becomes very tame\r\nand familiar; it will fly about the room, play with its fellows, and\r\ncome fearlessly to take its food from the hand. Professor Bell gives\r\nan interesting account of one kept by Mr. James Sowerby, which, \"when\r\nat liberty in the parlor, would fly to the hand of any of the young\r\npeople who held up a fly toward it, and, pitching on the hand, take\r\nthe fly without hesitation. If the insect was held between the lips,\r\nthe Bat would then settle on its young patron's cheek, and take the\r\nfly with great gentleness from the mouth; and so far was this\r\nfamiliarity carried, that, when either of the young people made a\r\nhumming noise with the mouth, in imitation of an insect, the Bat would\r\nsearch about the lips for the promised dainty.\" This habit of taking\r\nits food when off the wing, would seem to be natural to the Long-eared\r\nBat under certain circumstances, as Mr. Tomes records his having seen\r\none feeding in this manner upon the myriads of small moths which\r\nswarmed about a spindle tree in bloom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-EARED BAT.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that the creatures which display all this\r\nactivity and intelligence are well endowed with at least all the\r\nsenses possessed by the other animals of their class. The organs of\r\nsmell and hearing are well developed, and in many cases associated\r\nwith external membranous expansions of great size, as seen in the ears\r\nof the Long-eared Bat; and the eyes, though generally of small size\r\nexcept in the Fruit Bats, are bright and efficient, serving the\r\ncreatures in good stead in the rapid pursuit of their insect-prey,\r\nwhich must be directed principally by sight. The common expression \"as\r\nblind as a Bat,\" must be taken to apply to Bats accidentally driven\r\nfrom their retreats in the day-time, when it must be confessed that\r\nthey fly about in a dazed manner; but at night and in their dark\r\nretreats they show no such imbecility of purpose, but find their way\r\nwith astonishing precision and certainty. In fact, instead of being\r\nblind, the Bats must be especially sharp-sighted, if all their\r\nevolutions be guided by the sense of sight, for in many cases they\r\nhabitually resort to the inmost recesses of caverns and other places\r\nwhere, so far as our judgment goes, no light can possibly penetrate.\r\nHence it was long since suspected that some other sense than that of\r\nsight must come to their aid when they plunge into such outer darkness\r\nas prevails in some places through which they fly with the greatest\r\nfreedom, and more than a century ago numerous experiment were made by\r\na distinguished Italian naturalist, the Abbe Spallanzani, in order to\r\ndiscover, if possible, what might be the secret of these curious\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nHe set free, in a long passage which was bent at a right angle about\r\nthe middle of its length, a blinded Bat, which flew through the whole\r\nof this passage, turning the corner correctly, without anywhere\r\ntouching the walls; while flying, too, it in some mysterious manner\r\ndetected a hole in the roof at a distance of eighteen inches, and\r\nproceeded at once to ensconce itself in this shelter. In another\r\nexperiment the Abbe took two Bats, one blinded, the other not, and\r\nplaced them in a space shut off from a garden and roofed in with nets,\r\nand with sixteen strings suspended from the top in different parts.\r\nBoth Bats flew about briskly and avoided the hanging strings equally\r\nwell, until at length the _blinded_ Bat discovered that the meshes of\r\nthe net were large enough for him to get through, when he at once made\r\nhis escape, and after flying about for a short time, went off directly\r\nto the only roof in the vicinity, under which he disappeared. In\r\nshort, from these experiments it became perfectly clear that under\r\nthese circumstances the sense of sight was not of primary importance\r\nin guiding the course of the Bat. Similar trials with the organs of\r\nsmell and hearing showed that they had nothing to do with it, and the\r\nonly other sense that could be appealed to was the general sense of\r\ntouch. Baron Cuvier, the great French comparative anatomist, was the\r\nfirst to suggest, from the consideration of the results obtained by\r\nthe Abbe Spallanzani and others, especially by M. de Jurine, of\r\nGeneva, that the peculiar phenomena in question might be accounted for\r\nby the existence, especially in the great membranous expansions of the\r\nwings, of a most delicate sensibility; and subsequent investigations\r\nof the structure of those organs has tended to confirm this view, so\r\nthat it is now the one generally accepted. It is found that these\r\ngreat membranes are traversed in all parts by numerous nerves, the\r\ndelicate terminations of which form little loops, exactly resembling\r\nthose which occur in our skin in those parts where the sense of touch\r\nis most highly developed; and this resemblance is heightened by the\r\nfact that the membrane is covered with rows of little points. Even the\r\norgans of circulation in the wings are so constructed as to render it\r\nalmost certain that those organs have a quite exceptional sensibility.\r\nTheir ramifications are very numerous, and the veins as well as the\r\narteries have contractile walls, rendering the circulation of the\r\nblood exceedingly active, the conditions, as Professor St. George\r\nMivart remarks, being almost those of a state of inflammation.\r\n\r\nIf these membranous expansions have the functions just ascribed to\r\nthem, we can easily understand that the larger they are the better,\r\nand this will explain why the Bats generally exhibit so great a\r\ntendency to run out into naked membranes. Thus although the ears, as\r\norgans of hearing, have probably nothing to do with guiding the Bat\r\nwhen flying in dark places, we find that in a great number of species\r\nthe external ears are exceedingly large and delicately membranous, of\r\nwhich indeed we have an example in the British Long-eared Bat already\r\nreferred to. In like manner, while the nose, as a nose, may also be\r\nleft out of consideration, the development of membranous appendages of\r\nthe part of the face in which the nostrils open is one of the most\r\ncurious peculiarities of a vast number of Bats, in many of which these\r\nsingular nose-leaves almost rival the ears in size, while their\r\nstructure often renders them most grotesque. We have two Bats thus\r\nadorned in Britain, namely, the Greater and the Lesser Horseshoe Bats,\r\nbut most of the leaf-nosed species are inhabitants of warmer regions,\r\nand it is there that they run out into the most remarkable\r\neccentricities of structure. In Blainville's Bat, a small species\r\ninhabiting South America and the West Indies, these expansions of the\r\nskin of the face seem to have reached the utmost possible\r\ngrotesqueness, but the membranous leaves are larger and the ears much\r\nmore developed in many species allied to our own Horseshoe Bats,\r\nespecially such as the Megaderms. We can hardly imagine that these\r\ngreat membranous expansions of the outer ears and the region of the\r\nnose can have any other purpose than that of enlarging the surface of\r\nhighly sensitive skin specially adapted for the perception of external\r\nimpressions, and it is a remarkable fact, strictly in accordance with\r\nthis view, that, so far as we know, the Bats so endowed are more\r\ndecidedly nocturnal in their habits and frequent darker retreats than\r\ntheir less gifted fellows. Thus our Long-eared Bat, as already stated,\r\ncontinues active on the wing throughout the whole night, and the\r\nHorseshoe Bats are distinguished as specially affecting dark caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SNAKES EAT\r\n\r\n(FROM SNAKES.)\r\n\r\nBY CATHERINE C. HOPLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMADRYAD SNAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe Hamadryad's appointed diet is one ring-snake per week; but \"Ophi,\"\r\nas we now call him, is occasionally required--and with no sacrifice of\r\nhis principles either--to eat an extra snake to satisfy the curiosity\r\nof some distinguished visitor. Sometimes, too, colubers are plentiful,\r\nand two small ones are not too much for his ten or twelve feet of\r\nappetite. This splendid serpent has rewarded care by remaining in\r\nperfect health, and growing several feet. He was between eight and\r\nnine feet long when he came, and is now not far short of twelve and\r\nproportionately larger in circumference. Sometimes during winter, when\r\nring-snakes are scarce, \"Ophi\" is compelled to fast; for he is not\r\nthen to be tempted with other food. During the first year of his\r\nresidence in the Gardens, the supply was good, and he ate no less than\r\neighty-two fellow-creatures before the winter was well over. Towards\r\nspring, however, the supply ran short, and only two more remained for\r\nhim. He had now fasted two entire weeks, and looked hungry and eager.\r\nThe keeper offered him a guinea-pig, at which he took great offence,\r\nraising his hood and hissing angrily for a long while. Eggs he\r\ndeclined, also a lizard and a rat, in great disgust. In India the\r\nOphiophagi are said to feed on lizards and fish occasionally, but\r\n_our_ Ophiophagus preferred to fast. At last one of the two\r\nring-snakes was produced, and Ophio was to be regaled. It was the 31st\r\nof March, 1876, and he had been a denizen of the Gardens just one\r\nyear. My note-book informs me that it was a lovely, soft spring day,\r\nand that Ophio was quite lively. He had rejected frogs on his own\r\naccount, but in the uncertainty of more ring-snakes arriving, he was\r\nnow decoyed into eating half a dozen. Holland contrived that the snake\r\ndestined for his dinner should answer the purpose of a feast, and had\r\nallowed it to eat as many frogs as it chose. Like the poor wretch who,\r\ndoomed to the gallows, is permitted to fare sumptuously the last\r\nmorning of his life, the ring-snake ate three frogs, by which the\r\nOphiophagus was to derive chief benefit; he, all unconscious of the\r\ncause of his victim's unusual plumpness, swallowed him speedily.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Ophio doffed his winter coat entire, and having again\r\nfasted for ten days, was at once rewarded by the last remaining\r\nring-snake in a similarly plethoric condition, namely, with three more\r\nfrogs inside him. Now and then during the winter months the scarcity\r\nof ring-snakes has compelled the sacrifice of some far rarer colubers\r\nto Ophio's cannibal tastes. And yet each year we hear of hundreds of\r\nring-snakes being ruthlessly killed in country districts, while at\r\ngreat cost and trouble others are purchased or brought from the\r\nContinent for the Hamadryad's sustenance. Lord Lilford, one of the\r\nOphidarium's best patrons, sometimes sends presents of game in the\r\nshape of ring-snakes to the Hamadryad.\r\n\r\nWhile watching this snake-eater over his dinner, one is struck with\r\nthe remarkable tenacity of life exhibited in the victim, or the slow\r\naction of the venom if poisoned in the first grasp. The Ophiophagus\r\nseizes it anywhere, that is, at whichever part happens to come first,\r\nand then, after holding it quietly for a time, works his jaws up to\r\nthe head in the usual hand-over-hand, or \"jaw-after-jaw\" fashion,\r\ninvariably swallowing the snake head first. On one occasion when I\r\nwatched attentively, Ophio, having seized a ring-snake by the middle,\r\nheld it doggedly still for one quarter of an hour, while the lesser\r\nsnake did its very best to work its way out of the jaws, and also to\r\nfetter its captor by twirling itself over his head and coiling round\r\nhis neck. This continued while Ophio, with his head and neck raised,\r\nremained motionless, and after the quarter of an hour commenced to\r\nwork his jaws up towards the head of the ring snake, which, as more\r\nand more of its own body was free for action, twirled itself about,\r\nand at length coiled its tail round the bit of branch nailed into the\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nPersistently, like a sailor making his vessel fast to the windlass,\r\nthe ring snake lashed as much of himself as was free round the branch\r\na foot off, and so pulled and pulled till he looked in danger of\r\nsevering himself in two. Meanwhile Ophio, slowly but surely advancing,\r\ncaused its head and neck to disappear, grasping tightly with his\r\nvenomous jaws, as if he would say, \"We'll see who is master.\" It was a\r\nclose tussle, so firmly did the little coluber retain his hold on the\r\n\"tree\"; but as the upper part of him was gradually drawn into those\r\nunrelaxing jaws, he by degrees gave way, and by and by was gone.\r\n\r\nNot far short of an hour was occupied in this meal, during which the\r\nvictim showed no signs of being poisoned, nor were his coils round the\r\nstump relaxed in the slightest degree, till Ophio reached the tail.\r\nThe ring snake is not a constrictor, yet he thus tied himself round\r\nthe tree by the coils of his tail.\r\n\r\nOne more singular case of tenacity of life must be recorded. A\r\nring-snake had been caught in the usual way, and the usual struggle\r\nensued between captor and captive. Coluber, with its head tightly\r\ngripped in the jaws of his enemy, had still all the rest of himself at\r\nliberty and in full activity, and after wriggling a violent protest,\r\nhe coiled what was left of himself so closely round the neck of his\r\npersecutor that the latter made little or no progress with his dinner\r\nfor a time. He seemed to be deliberating how to proceed next, and\r\nasking, \"What is the meaning of this?\" then shook his head, lowered it\r\nto the shingle, and tried to rub off the coils. The only result thus\r\nachieved was that the extreme end of Coluber's tail was loosened for a\r\nmoment, but only to coil afresh around Ophio's jaws, which\r\nnevertheless slowly and surely advanced.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour the progress was very slow; but when the ring-snake\r\nwas nearly all swallowed except a few inches of tail, these became so\r\ntight a muzzle that Ophio in turn was the victim. Shaking his head and\r\nvainly endeavoring to free his jaws of this muzzle, a minute or two\r\nelapsed, during which he seemed to suffer some discomfort, when\r\nsuddenly his mouth opened widely, and out crawled Natrix, apparently\r\nnone the worse for this temporary entombment. He had turned round when\r\ntwo or three feet from daylight, and come back to see the world once\r\nmore. But it so happened that Ophio closed his jaws in time over the\r\nfew inches of tail which still remained between them. Nor did he once\r\nrelax his grasp of this, but quickly and patiently began to work his\r\nway up to the head and recommence his meal, and this time with better\r\nsuccess. An hour and a quarter I watched, nor was any evidence of\r\npoison seen, so as to reduce the powers of the bitten snake; for\r\nbitten it must have been in those prolonged and forcible grasps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn these conflicts one could but observe a dogged stupidity on the\r\npart of the venomous snake, who, had he but brought coils to his aid,\r\nmight have simplified matters so easily. The little Heterodons, and\r\neven the Lacertines, often assist themselves with coils in managing\r\ntheir prey, though not themselves constrictors; but the venomous ones\r\nhave not the slightest notion of helping themselves in this way, as if\r\nconfident that in time their venom would do its work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WORMS DO\r\n\r\n(FROM THE FORMATION OF VEGETABLE MOULD.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe now come to treat of a curious and important subject,--namely, the\r\namount of earth which is brought up by worms from beneath the surface,\r\nand is afterwards spread out more or less completely by the rain and\r\nwind. The amount can be judged of by two methods,--by the rate at\r\nwhich objects left on the surface are buried, and more accurately by\r\nweighing the quantity brought up within a given time. We will begin\r\nwith the first method, as it was first followed.\r\n\r\nNear Maer Hall in Staffordshire, quick-lime had been spread, about the\r\nyear 1827, thickly over a field of good pasture-land, which had not\r\nsince been ploughed. Some square holes were dug in this field in the\r\nbeginning of October, 1837, and the sections showed a layer of turf,\r\nformed by the matted roots of the grasses, 1/2 inch in thickness,\r\nbeneath which, at a depth of 21/2 inches (or 3 inches from the surface),\r\na layer of the lime in powder or in small lumps could be distinctly\r\nseen running all round the vertical sides of the holes. The soil\r\nbeneath the layer of lime was either gravelly or of a coarse sandy\r\nnature, and differed considerably in appearance from the overlying\r\ndark-coloured fine mould. Coal-cinders had been spread over a part of\r\nthis same field either in the year 1833 or 1834; and when the above\r\nholes were dug, that is, after an interval of 3 or 4 years, the\r\ncinders formed a line of black spots round the holes, at a depth of\r\n1 inch beneath the surface, parallel to and above the white layer of\r\nlime. Over another part of this field cinders had been strewed, only\r\nabout half a year before, and these either still lay on the surface or\r\nwere entangled among the roots of the grasses; and I here saw the\r\ncommencement of the burying process, for worm-castings had been heaped\r\non several of the smaller fragments. After an interval of 43/4 years\r\nthis field was re-examined, and now the two layers of lime and cinders\r\nwere found almost everywhere at a greater depth than before by nearly\r\n1 inch, we will say by 3/4 of an inch. Therefore, mould to an average\r\nthickness of .22 of an inch had been annually brought up by the worms,\r\nand had been spread over the surface of this field.\r\n\r\nCoal-cinders had been strewed over another field, at a date which\r\ncould not be positively ascertained, so thickly that they formed\r\n(October, 1837) a layer, 1 inch in thickness at a depth of about\r\n3 inches from the surface. The layer was so continuous that the\r\noverlying dark vegetable mould was connected with the sub-soil of\r\nred clay only by the roots of the grasses; and when these were broken,\r\nthe mould and the red clay fell apart. In a third field, on which\r\ncoal-cinders and burnt marl had been strewed several times at unknown\r\ndates, holes were dug in 1842; and a layer of cinders could be traced\r\nat a depth of 31/2 inches, beneath which at a depth of 91/2 inches from\r\nthe surface there was a line of cinders together with burnt marl. On\r\nthe sides of one hole there were two layers of cinders, at 2 and\r\n31/2 inches beneath the surface; and below them at a depth in parts of 91/2,\r\nand in other parts of 101/2 inches there were fragments of burnt marl.\r\nIn a fourth field two layers of lime, one above the other could be\r\ndistinctly traced, and beneath them a layer of cinders and burnt marl\r\nat a depth of from 10 to 12 inches below the surface.\r\n\r\nA piece of waste land was enclosed, drained, ploughed, harrowed, and\r\nthickly covered in the year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders. It was\r\nsowed with grass seeds, and now supports a tolerably good but coarse\r\npasture. Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its\r\nreclamation, and we see in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1) reduced\r\nto half of the natural scale, that the turf was 1/2 inch thick, beneath\r\nwhich there was a layer of vegetable mould 21/2 inches thick. This layer\r\ndid not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a\r\nlayer of mould, 11/2 inch in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl,\r\nconspicuous from their red color, one of which near the bottom was an\r\ninch in length; and other fragments of coal-cinders together with a\r\nfew white quartz pebbles. Beneath this layer and at a depth of\r\n41/2 inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil with a\r\nfew quartz pebbles was encountered. Here, therefore, the fragments of\r\nburnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course of 15 years by a\r\nlayer of fine vegetable mould, only 21/2 inches in thickness, excluding\r\nthe turf. Six and a half years subsequently this field was\r\nre-examined, and the fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches\r\nbeneath the surface. So that in this interval of 61/2 years, about\r\n11/2 inch of mould had been added to the superficial layer. I am surprised\r\nthat a greater quantity had not been brought up during the whole\r\n211/2 years, for in the closely underlying black, peaty soil there were many\r\nworms. It is, however, probable that formerly, whilst the land\r\nremained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould would then have\r\naccumulated slowly. The average annual increase of thickness for the\r\nwhole period is .19 of an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\nSection of the vegetable mould in a field, drained and reclaimed\r\n    fifteen years previously; a, turf; b, vegetable mould without\r\n    any stones; c, mould with fragments of burnt marl, coal cinders,\r\n    and pebbles; d, sub-soil of black, peaty sand with quartz\r\n    pebbles.]\r\n\r\nTwo other cases are worth recording. In the spring of 1835 a field,\r\nwhich had long existed as poor pasture, and was so swampy that it\r\ntrembled slightly when stamped on, was thickly covered with red sand\r\nso that the whole surface appeared at first bright red. When holes\r\nwere dug in this field after an interval of about 21/2 years, the sand\r\nformed a layer at a depth of 3/4 inch beneath the surface. In 1842\r\n(i.e., seven years after the sand had been laid on) fresh holes were\r\ndug, and now the red sand formed a distinct layer, 2 inches beneath\r\nthe surface, or 11/2 inch beneath the turf; so that on an average\r\n.21 inches of mould had been annually brought to the surface. Immediately\r\nbeneath the layer of red sand the original sub-stratum of black, sandy\r\npeat extended.\r\n\r\nA grass field, likewise not far from Maer Hall, had formerly been\r\nthickly covered with marl, and was then left for several years as\r\npasture; it was afterwards ploughed. A friend had three trenches dug\r\nin this field 28 years after the application of the marl, and a layer\r\nof the marl fragments could be traced at a depth, carefully\r\nmeasured, of 12 inches in some parts, and of 14 inches in other parts.\r\nThis difference in depth depended on the layer being horizontal,\r\nwhilst the surface consisted of ridges and furrows from the field\r\nhaving been ploughed. The tenant assured me that it had never been\r\nturned up to a greater depth than from 6 to 8 inches; and as the\r\nfragments formed an unbroken horizontal layer from 12 to 14 inches\r\nbeneath the surface, these must have been buried by the worms whilst\r\nthe land was in pasture before it was ploughed, for otherwise they\r\nwould have been indiscriminately scattered by the plough throughout\r\nthe whole thickness of the soil. Four and a half years afterwards I\r\nhad three holes dug in this field, in which potatoes had been lately\r\nplanted, and the layer of marl fragments was now found 13 inches\r\nbeneath the bottoms of the furrows, and therefore probably 15 inches\r\nbeneath the general level of the field. It should, however, be\r\nobserved that the thickness of the blackish, sandy soil, which had\r\nbeen thrown up by the worms above the marl fragments in the course of\r\n321/2 years, would have measured less than 15 inches, if the field had\r\nalways remained as pasture, for the soil would in this case have been\r\nmuch more compact. The fragments of marl almost rested on an\r\nundisturbed sub-stratum of white sand with quartz pebbles; and as this\r\nwould be little attractive to worms, the mould would hereafter be very\r\nslowly increased by their action.\r\n\r\nWe will now give some cases of the action of worms, on land differing\r\nwidely from the dry, sandy, or the swampy pasture just described. The\r\nchalk formation extends all round my house in Kent; and its surface,\r\nfrom having been exposed during an immense period to the dissolving\r\naction of rain-water, is extremely irregular, being abruptly festooned\r\nand penetrated by many deep, well-like cavities. During the\r\ndissolution of the chalk the insoluble matter, including a vast number\r\nof unrolled flints of all sizes, has been left on the surface and\r\nforms a bed of stiff red clay, full of flints, and generally from 6 to\r\n14 feet in thickness. Over the red clay, wherever the land has long\r\nremained as pasture, there is a layer a few inches in thickness of\r\ndark-coloured vegetable mould.\r\n\r\nA quantity of broken chalk was spread, on December 20, 1842, over a\r\npart of a field near my house, which had existed as pasture certainly\r\nfor 30, probably for twice or thrice as many, years. The chalk was\r\nlaid on the land for the sake of observing at some future period to\r\nwhat depth it would become buried. At the end of November, 1871, that\r\nis, after an interval of twenty-nine years, a trench was dug across\r\nthis part of the field; and a line of white nodules could be traced on\r\nboth sides of the trench, at a depth of 7 inches from the surface. The\r\nmould, therefore (excluding the turf), had here been thrown up at an\r\naverage rate of .22 inches per year. Beneath the line of chalk nodules\r\nthere was in parts hardly any fine earth free of flints, while in\r\nother parts there was a layer 21/4 inches in thickness. In this latter\r\ncase the mould was altogether 91/4 inches thick; and in one such spot a\r\nnodule of chalk and a smooth flint pebble, both of which must have\r\nbeen left at some former time on the surface, were found at this\r\ndepth. At from 11 to 12 inches beneath the surface, the undisturbed\r\nreddish clay, full of flints, extended. The appearance of the above\r\nnodules of chalk surprised me much at first, as they closely resembled\r\nwater-worn pebbles, whereas the freshly-broken fragments had been\r\nangular. But on examining the nodules with a lens, they no longer\r\nappeared water-worn, for their surfaces were pitted through unequal\r\ncorrosion, and minute, sharp points, formed of broken fossil shells,\r\nprojected from them. It was evident that the corners of the original\r\nfragments of chalk had been wholly dissolved, from presenting a large\r\nsurface to the carbonic acid dissolved in the rain-water and to that\r\ngenerated in soil containing vegetable matter, as well as the\r\nhumus-acids. The projecting corners would also, relatively to the\r\nother parts, have been embraced by a larger number of living rootlets;\r\nand these have the power of even attacking marble, as Sachs has shown.\r\nThus, in the course of twenty-nine years, buried angular fragments of\r\nchalk had been converted into well-rounded nodules.\r\n\r\nAnother part of this same field was mossy, and as it was thought that\r\nsifted coal-cinders would improve the pasture, a thick layer was\r\nspread over this part either in 1842 or 1843, and another layer some\r\nyears afterwards. In 1871 a trench was here dug, and many cinders lay\r\nin a line at a depth of 7 inches beneath the surface, with another\r\nline at a depth of 51/2 inches parallel to the one beneath. In another\r\npart of this field, which had formerly existed as a separate one, and\r\nwhich it was believed had been pasture-land for more than a century,\r\ntrenches were dug to see how thick the vegetable mould was. By chance\r\nthe first trench was made at a spot where at some former period,\r\ncertainly more than forty years before, a large hole had been filled\r\nup with coarse, red clay, flints, fragments of chalk, and gravel; and\r\nhere the fine vegetable mould was only from 4 1/8 to 4 3/8 inches in\r\nthickness. In another and undisturbed place, the mould varied much in\r\nthickness, namely, from 61/2 to 81/2 inches; beneath which a few small\r\nfragments of brick were found in one place. From these several cases,\r\nit would appear, that during the last 29 years mould has been heaped\r\non the surface at an average annual rate of from .2 to .22 of an\r\ninch. But in this district when a ploughed field is first laid down in\r\ngrass, the mould accumulates at a much slower rate. The rate, also,\r\nmust become very much slower after a bed of mould, several inches in\r\nthickness, has been formed; for the worms then live chiefly near the\r\nsurface, and burrow down to a greater depth so as to bring up fresh\r\nearth from below, only during the winter, when the weather is very\r\ncold (at which time worms were found in this field at a depth of\r\n26 inches), and during summer, when the weather is very dry.\r\n\r\nA field which adjoins the one just described, slopes in one part\r\nrather steeply (viz., at from 10 deg. to 15 deg.); this part was last ploughed\r\nin 1841, was then harrowed and left to become pasture-land. For\r\nseveral years it was clothed with an extremely scant vegetation, and\r\nwas so thickly covered with small and large flints (some of them half\r\nas large as a child's head) that the field was always called by my\r\nsons \"the stony field.\" When they ran down the slope the stones\r\nclattered together. I remember doubting whether I should live to see\r\nthese larger flints covered with vegetable mould and turf. But the\r\nsmaller stones disappeared before many years had elapsed, as did every\r\none of the larger ones after a time; so that after thirty years (1871)\r\na horse could gallop over the compact turf from one end of the field\r\nto the other, and not strike a single stone with his shoes. To anyone\r\nwho remembered the appearance of the field in 1842, the transformation\r\nwas wonderful. This was certainly the work of the worms, for though\r\ncastings were not frequent for several years, yet some were thrown up\r\nmonth after month, and these gradually increased in numbers as the\r\npasture improved. In the year 1871 a trench was dug on the above\r\nslope, and the blades of grass were cut off close to the roots, so\r\nthat the thickness of the turf and of the vegetable mould could be\r\nmeasured accurately. The turf was rather less than half an inch, and\r\nthe mould, which did not contain any stones, 21/2 inches in thickness.\r\nBeneath this lay coarse, clayey earth full of flints, like that in any\r\nof the neighboring ploughed fields. This coarse earth easily fell\r\napart from the overlying mould when a split was lifted up. The average\r\nrate of accumulation of the mould during the whole thirty years was\r\nonly .083 inch per year (i.e., nearly one inch in twelve years); but\r\nthe rate must have been much slower at first, and afterwards\r\nconsiderably quicker.\r\n\r\nThe transformation in the appearance of this field, which had been\r\neffected beneath my eyes, was afterwards rendered the more striking,\r\nwhen I examined in Knole Park a dense forest of lofty beech-trees,\r\nbeneath which nothing grew. Here the ground was thickly strewed with\r\nlarge, naked stones, and worm-castings were almost wholly absent.\r\nObscure lines and irregularities on the surface indicated that the\r\nland had been cultivated some centuries ago. It is probable that a\r\nthick wood of young beech-trees sprung up so quickly, that time enough\r\nwas not allowed for worms to cover up the stone with their castings,\r\nbefore the site became unfitted for their existence. Anyhow, the\r\ncontrast between the state of the now miscalled \"stony field,\" well\r\nstocked with worms, and the present state of the ground beneath the\r\nold beech-trees in Knole Park, where worms appeared to be absent, was\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nA narrow path running across part of my lawn was paved in 1843 with\r\nsmall flag-stones, set edgeways; but worms threw up many castings, and\r\nweeds grew thickly between them. During several years the path was\r\nweeded and swept; but ultimately the weeds and worms prevailed, and\r\nthe gardener ceased to sweep, merely moving off the weeds, as often as\r\nthe lawn was mowed. The path soon became almost covered up, and after\r\nseveral years no trace of it was left. On removing, in 1877, the thin\r\noverlaying layer of turf, the small flag-stones, all in their proper\r\nplaces, were found covered by an inch of fine mould.\r\n\r\nTwo recently published accounts of substances strewed on the surface\r\nof pasture-land, having become buried through the action of worms, may\r\nbe here noticed. The Rev. H. C. Key had a ditch cut in a field, over\r\nwhich coal-ashes had been spread, as it was believed, 18 years before,\r\nand on the clean-cut perpendicular sides of the ditch, at a depth of\r\nat least 7 inches, there could be seen, for a length of 60 yards, \"a\r\ndistinct, very even, narrow line of coal-ashes, mixed with small coal,\r\nperfectly parallel with the top-sward.\" This parallelism and the\r\nlength of the section gives interest to the case. Secondly, Mr. Dancer\r\nstates that crushed bones had been thickly strewed over a field, and\r\n\"some years afterwards\" these were found \"several inches below the\r\nsurface, at a uniform depth.\" Worms appear to act in the same manner\r\nin New Zealand as in Europe; for Professor J. von Haast has described\r\na section near the coast, consisting of mica-schist, \"covered by 5 or\r\n6 feet of loess, above which about 12 inches of vegetable soil had\r\naccumulated.\" Between the loess and the mould there was a layer from 3\r\nto 6 inches in thickness, consisting of \"cores, implements, flakes,\r\nand chips, all manufactured from hard basaltic rock.\" It is,\r\ntherefore, probable, that the aborigines, at some former period, had\r\nleft these objects on the surface, and that they had afterwards been\r\nslowly covered up by the castings of worms.\r\n\r\nFarmers in England are well aware that objects of all kinds, left on\r\nthe surface of pasture-lands, after a time disappear, or, as they say,\r\nwork themselves downwards. How powdered lime, cinders, and heavy\r\nstones, can work down, and at the same rate, through the matted roots\r\nof a grass-covered surface, is a question which has probably never\r\noccurred to them.\r\n\r\n_The sinking of great stones through the action of worms._--When a\r\nstone of large size and of irregular shape is left on the surface of\r\nthe ground, it rests, of course, on the more protuberant parts; but\r\nworms soon fill up with their castings all the hollow spaces on the\r\nlower side; for, as Hensen remarks, they like the shelter of stones.\r\nAs soon as the hollows are filled up, the worms eject the earth which\r\nthey have swallowed beyond the circumference of the stones; and thus\r\nthe surface of the ground is raised all round the stone. As the\r\nburrows excavated directly beneath the stone after a time collapse,\r\nthe stone sinks a little. Hence it is, that boulders which at some\r\nancient period have rolled down from a rocky mountain or cliff on to a\r\nmeadow at its base, are always somewhat imbedded in the soil; and,\r\nwhen removed, leave an exact impression of their lower surfaces in\r\nthe under-lying fine mould. If, however, a boulder is of such huge\r\ndimensions, that the earth beneath is kept dry, such earth will not be\r\ninhabited by worms, and the boulder will not sink into the ground.\r\n\r\nA lime-kiln formerly stood in a grass-field near Leith Hill Place, in\r\nSurrey, and was pulled down 35 years before my visit; all the loose\r\nrubbish had been carted away, excepting three large stones of\r\nquartzose sandstone, which it was thought might hereafter be of some\r\nuse. An old workman remembered that they had been left on a bare\r\nsurface of broken bricks and mortar, close to the foundations of the\r\nkiln; but the whole surrounding surface is now covered with turf and\r\nmould. The two largest of these stones had never since been moved; nor\r\ncould this easily have been done, as, when I had them removed, it was\r\nthe work of two men with levers. One of these stones, and not the\r\nlargest, was 64 inches long, 17 inches broad, and from 9 to 10 inches\r\nin thickness. Its lower surface was somewhat protuberant in the\r\nmiddle; and this part still rested on broken bricks and mortar,\r\nshowing the truth of the old workman's account. Beneath the brick\r\nrubbish the natural sandy soil, full of fragments of sandstone, was\r\nfound; and this could have yielded very little, if at all, to the\r\nweight of the stone, as might have been expected if the sub-soil had\r\nbeen clay. The surface of the field, for a distance of about 9 inches\r\nround the stone, gradually sloped up to it, and close to the stone\r\nstood in most places about 4 inches above the surrounding ground. The\r\nbase of the stone was buried from 1 to 2 inches beneath the general\r\nlevel, and the upper surface projected about 8 inches above this\r\nlevel, or about 4 inches above the sloping border of turf. After the\r\nremoval of the stone it became evident that one of its pointed ends\r\nmust at first have stood clear above the ground by some inches, but\r\nits upper surface was now on a level with the surrounding turf. When\r\nthe stone was removed, an exact cast of its lower side, forming a\r\nshallow crateriform hollow, was left, the inner surface of which\r\nconsisted of fine, black mould, excepting where the more protuberant\r\nparts rested on the brick-rubbish. A transverse section of this stone,\r\ntogether with its bed, drawn from measurements made after it had been\r\ndisplaced, is here given on a scale of 1/2 inch to a foot (Fig. 2). The\r\nturf-covered border which sloped up to the stone, consisted of fine\r\nvegetable mould, in one part 7 inches in thickness. This evidently\r\nconsisted of worm-castings, several of which had been recently\r\nejected. The whole stone had sunk in the thirty-five years, as far as\r\nI could judge, about 11/2 inch; and this must have been due to the\r\nbrick-rubbish beneath the more protuberant parts having been\r\nundermined by worms. At this rate, the upper surface of the stone, if\r\nit had been left undisturbed, would have sunk to the general level of\r\nthe field in 247 years; but before this could have occurred, some\r\nearth would have been washed down by heavy rain from the castings on\r\nthe raised border of turf over the upper surface of the stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\nTransverse section across a large stone, which had lain on a\r\n    grass-field for thirty-five years. _aa_, general level of the\r\n    field. The underlying brick of rubbish has not been represented.]\r\n\r\nThe second stone was larger than the one just described, viz.,\r\n67 inches in length, 39 in breadth, and 15 in thickness. The lower\r\nsurface was nearly flat, so that the worms must soon have been\r\ncompelled to eject their castings beyond its circumference. The stone\r\nas a whole had sunk about 2 inches into the ground. At this rate it\r\nwould have required 262 years for its upper surface to have sunk to\r\nthe general level of the field. The upwardly sloping, turf-covered\r\nborder round the stone was broader than in the last case, viz., from\r\n14 to 16 inches; and why this should be so, I could see no reason. In\r\nmost parts this border was not so high as in the last case, viz., from\r\n2 to 21/2 inches, but in one place it was as much as 51/2. Its average\r\nheight close to the stone was probably about 3 inches, and it thinned\r\nout to nothing. If so, a layer of fine earth, 15 inches in breadth and\r\n11/2 inch in average thickness, of sufficient length to surround the\r\nwhole of the much elongated slab, must have been brought up by the\r\nworms in chief part from beneath the stone in the course of 35 years.\r\nThis amount would be amply sufficient to account for its having sunk\r\nabout 2 inches into the ground; more especially if we bear in mind\r\nthat a good deal of the finest earth would have been washed by heavy\r\nrain from the castings ejected on the sloping border down to the level\r\nof the field. Some fresh castings were seen close to the stone.\r\nNevertheless, on digging a large hole to a depth of 18 inches where\r\nthe stone had lain, only two worms and a few burrows were seen,\r\nalthough the soil was damp and seemed favorable for worms. There were\r\nsome large colonies of ants beneath the stone, and possibly since\r\ntheir establishment the worms had decreased in number.\r\n\r\nThe third stone was only about half as large as the others; and two\r\nstrong boys could together have rolled it over. I have no doubt that\r\nit had been rolled over at a moderately recent time, for it now lay at\r\nsome distance from the two other stones at the bottom of a little\r\nadjoining slope. It rested also on fine earth, instead of partly on\r\nbrick-rubbish. In agreement with this conclusion, the raised\r\nsurrounding border of turf was only 1 inch high in some parts, and\r\n2 inches in other parts. There were no colonies of ants beneath this\r\nstone, and on digging a hole where it had lain, several burrows and\r\nworms were found.\r\n\r\nAt Stonehenge, some of the outer Druidical stones are now prostrate,\r\nhaving fallen at a remote but unknown period; and these have become\r\nburied to a moderate depth in the ground. They are surrounded by\r\nsloping borders of turf, on which recent castings were seen. Close to\r\none of these fallen stones, which was 17 feet long, 6 feet broad, and\r\n281/2 inches thick, a hole was dug; and here the vegetable mould was at\r\nleast 91/2 inches in thickness. At this depth a flint was found, and a\r\nlittle higher up on one side of the hole a fragment of glass. The base\r\nof the stone lay about 91/2 inches beneath the level of the surrounding\r\nground, and its upper surface 19 inches above the ground.\r\n\r\nA hole was also dug close to a second huge stone, which in falling had\r\nbroken into two pieces; and this must have happened long ago, judging\r\nfrom the weathered aspect of the fractured ends. The base was buried\r\nto a depth of 10 inches, as was ascertained by driving an iron skewer\r\nhorizontally into the ground beneath it. The vegetable mould forming\r\nthe turf-covered sloping border round the stone, on which many\r\ncastings had recently been ejected, was 10 inches in thickness; and\r\nmost of this mould must have been brought up by worms from beneath its\r\nbase. At a distance of 8 yards from the stone, the mould was only\r\n51/2 inches in thickness (with a piece of tobacco pipe at a depth of\r\n4 inches), and this rested on broken flint and chalk which could not\r\nhave easily yielded to the pressure or weight of the stone.\r\n\r\nA straight rod was fixed horizontally (by the aid of a spirit-level)\r\nacross a third fallen stone, which was 7 feet 9 inches long; and the\r\ncontour of the projecting parts and of the adjoining ground, which was\r\nnot quite level, was thus ascertained, as shown in the accompanying\r\ndiagram (Fig. 3) on a scale of 1/2 inch to a foot. The turf-covered\r\nborder sloped up to the stone on one side to a height of 4 inches, and\r\non the opposite side to only 21/2 inches above the general level. A hole\r\nwas dug on the eastern side, and the base of the stone was here found\r\nto lie at a depth of 4 inches beneath the general level of the\r\nground, and of 8 inches beneath the top of the sloping turf-covered\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\nSection through one of the fallen Druidical stones at Stonehenge,\r\n    showing how much it had sunk into the ground.]\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence has now been given showing that small objects left\r\non the surface of the land where worms abound soon get buried, and\r\nthat large stones sink slowly downwards through the same means. Every\r\nstep of the process could be followed, from the accidental deposition\r\nof a single casting on a small object lying loose on the surface, to\r\nits being entangled amidst the matted roots of the turf, and lastly to\r\nits being embedded in the mould at various depths beneath the surface.\r\nWhen the same field was re-examined after the interval of a few years,\r\nsuch objects were found at a greater depth than before. The\r\nstraightness and regularity of the lines formed by the embedded\r\nobjects, and their parallelism with the surface of the land, are the\r\nmost striking features of the case; for this parallelism shows how\r\nequably the worms must have worked; the result being, partly the\r\neffect of the washing down of the fresh castings by rain. The specific\r\ngravity of the objects does not affect their rate of sinking, as could\r\nbe seen by porous cinders, burnt marl, chalk and quartz pebbles,\r\nhaving all sunk to the same depth within the same time. Considering\r\nthe nature of the sub-stratum, which at Leith Hill Place was sandy\r\nsoil including many bits of rock, and at Stonehenge, chalk-rubble with\r\nbroken flints; considering, also, the presence of the turf-covered\r\nsloping border of mould round the great fragments of stone at both\r\nthese places, their sinking does not appear to have been sensibly\r\naided by their weight, though this was considerable.\r\n\r\n_On the number of worms which live within a given space._--We will\r\nnow show, first, what a vast number of worms live unseen by us beneath\r\nour feet, and, secondly, the actual weight of the earth which they\r\nbring up to the surface within a given space and within a given time.\r\nHensen, who has published so full and interesting an account of the\r\nhabits of worms, calculates, from the number which he found in a\r\nmeasured space, that there must exist 133,000 living worms in a\r\nhectare of land, or 53,767 in an acre. This latter number of worms\r\nwould weigh 356 pounds, taking Hensen's standard of the weight of a\r\nsingle worm, namely, one gram. It should, however, be noted that this\r\ncalculation is founded on the numbers found in a garden, and Hensen\r\nbelieves that worms are here twice as numerous as in corn-fields. The\r\nabove result, astonishing though it be, seems to me credible, judging\r\nfrom the number of worms which I have sometimes seen, and from the\r\nnumber daily destroyed by birds without the species being\r\nexterminated. Some barrels of bad ale were left on Mr. Miller's land,\r\nin the hope of making vinegar, but the vinegar proved bad, and the\r\nbarrels were upset. It should be premised that acetic acid is so\r\ndeadly a poison to worms that Perrier found that a glass rod dipped\r\ninto this acid and then into a considerable body of water in which\r\nworms were immersed, invariably killed them quickly. On the morning\r\nafter the barrels had been upset, \"the heaps of worms which lay dead\r\non the ground were so amazing, that if Mr. Miller had not seen them,\r\nhe could not have thought it possible for such numbers to have existed\r\nin the space.\" As further evidence of the large number of worms which\r\nlive in the ground Hensen states that he found in a garden 64 open\r\nburrows in a space of 141/2 square feet, that is, 9 in 2 square feet.\r\nBut the burrows are sometimes much more numerous, for when digging in\r\na grass-field near Maer Hall, I found a cake of dry earth, as large as\r\nmy two open hands, which was penetrated by seven burrows, as large as\r\ngoose-quills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FOPS AMONG THE FISHES\r\n\r\n(FROM GLEANINGS FROM NATURE.)[7]\r\n\r\nBY W.

You will not\r\nfind him swimming about like the minnows in the still, deep water of\r\nthe stream, but where the clear, cold water is rushing rapidly over\r\nthe stones of a ripple he makes his home. There he rests quietly on\r\nthe bottom, waiting patiently for his food, the larvae or young of\r\ngnats, mosquitoes, and other such insects, to float by.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to catch him, or your shadow suddenly frightens him,\r\nwith a sweep of his broad pectoral or breast fins, he moves quicker\r\nthan a flash a few feet farther up the stream, and then as suddenly\r\ncomes to a stop, and resumes his quiet, \"thoughtful\" attitude. If you\r\npersist in your attempt to capture him, he will dart under a small\r\nstone or submerged leaf, where, like the foolish ostrich which when\r\npursued hides her head under her wing, no longer seeing you, he thinks\r\nhimself secure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAINBOW DARTER.]\r\n\r\nOn account of the shape of his body, as well as on account of his\r\nrapid movements, he has received the surname \"darter.\" Belonging to\r\nthe group which bears this surname, there are, in the eastern half of\r\nthe United States, about forty-seven species or kinds, the largest of\r\nwhich, when full grown, measures only about six inches in length,\r\nwhile the smallest species never reaches a length of more than an inch\r\nand a half. They all have the same habits, and at least twenty-nine\r\nkinds of them are found in Indiana; but the one of which I am writing\r\nis much the more common. He is from two to two and a half inches in\r\nlength, and, like the other members of his family, has two fins on his\r\nback; \"dorsal\" fins they are called by naturalists, the front one of\r\nwhich contains ten short spines. During eight months of the year, the\r\nmales and females dress alike in a suit of brownish olive which is\r\nstriped on the sides with ten or twelve narrow, black cross-bars, and\r\nmore or less blotched on the back with darker spots. But on the first\r\nwarm days of spring, when the breezes blow up from the gulf, awakening\r\nthe gypsy in our blood, the little male fish feels, too, their\r\ninfluence, and in him there arises an irresistible desire to\r\n\"a-courting go.\" Like most other beings of his sex, he thinks his\r\nevery-day suit too plain for the important business before him. It\r\nwill, in his opinion, ne'er catch the eye of his lady love. So he dons\r\none of gaudy colors and from it takes his name,--the rainbow\r\ndarter,--for in it he is best known, as it not only attracts the\r\nattention of his chosen one, but often also that of the wandering\r\nnaturalist who happens along the stream.\r\n\r\nThe blackish bars of other seasons are changed to indigo blue, while\r\nthe space between them assumes a hue of the brightest orange. The fins\r\nare broadly edged with blue and have the bases orange, or orange and\r\nscarlet, while the cheeks assume the blue and the breast becomes an\r\norange. Clad in this suit he ventures forth on his mission, and if\r\nsuccessful, as he almost always is, the two construct a nest of tiny\r\nstones in which the eggs of the mother-fish are laid and watched over\r\nwith jealous care by both parents until in time there issue forth sons\r\ndestined some day to wear a coat of many colors, and \"darters\" to be\r\nattracted by those coats, as was their mother by the one their father\r\nwore.\r\n\r\nAlthough so abundant and so brilliant in the springtime, the rainbow\r\ndarter is known to few but naturalists. The fishes in which the\r\naverage country boy is interested are the larger ones--such as the\r\ngoggle-eye, the sucker, chub, and sunfish--those which, when caught,\r\nwill fill up the string and tickle the palate.\r\n\r\nBut there are, let us hope, among our farmers' sons and daughters,\r\nsome who are learning to take an interest in the objects of nature\r\nwhich are beautiful, as well as in those which are useful. To them I\r\nwill say, if you wish to see something really pretty, make a seine\r\nfrom an old coffee sack or a piece of mosquito netting, and any day in\r\nspring drag two or three ripples of the branch which flows through the\r\nwood's pasture, and ten chances to one you will get some \"rainbows.\"\r\nBy placing them in a fruit jar three-fourths full of clear, cold\r\nwater, and renewing the water every few hours, they can be kept for\r\nseveral days; but they cannot bear the confinement long, accustomed as\r\nthey are to the free running stream from which they were taken.\r\n\r\nBy taking the rainbow as the type of the darter and studying closely\r\nits habits, both in captivity and in the streams, much can be learned\r\nabout a group which, in the words of Dr. S. A. Forbes, \"are the\r\nmountaineers among fishes. Forced from the populous and fertile\r\nvalleys of the river beds and lake bottoms, they have taken refuge\r\nfrom their enemies in the rocky highlands where the free waters play\r\nin ceaseless torrents, and there they have wrested from stubborn\r\nnature a meagre living. Although diminished in size by their\r\ncontinual struggle with the elements, they have developed an activity\r\nand hardihood, a vigor of life and a glow of high color almost unknown\r\namong the easier livers of the lower lands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE LONG-EARED SUNFISH.\r\n\r\nAmong the most brightly colored of all the fresh-water members of the\r\nfinny tribe is the long-eared sunfish. When full grown its length is\r\nabout eight inches and the breadth one-half as much. The color is then\r\na brilliant blue and orange, the former predominating above; the\r\norange on the sides in spots, the blue in wavy, vertical streaks. The\r\ncheeks are orange with bright blue stripes; the fins with the\r\nmembranes orange, and the rays blue. Extending back from the hind\r\nmargin of each cheek is a conspicuous blackish membrane termed an\r\n\"ear-flap,\" which in this species is longer than in any other of the\r\nsun-fish family, whence the specific name, _megalotis_, from two Greek\r\nwords meaning \"great\" and \"ear.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-EARED SUNFISH.]\r\n\r\nWithin the placid pools of the brooks and larger streams of the State\r\nthis sunfish has its favorite haunts. Mid-summer is the time when its\r\nhabits can be best observed. On a recent August morn I sat for an\r\nhour or longer on the banks of a stream, which flows through a wooded\r\nblue-grass pasture, and watched the denizens of its waters. A peaceful\r\ncalm existed, the water being without a ripple and with scarce the\r\nsemblance of a flow--the air without the shadow of a breeze. Dragon\r\nflies lazily winged their way across the pool, now resting daintily\r\nupon a blade of sedge or swamp grass, now dipping the tips of their\r\nabdomens beneath the surface of the water while depositing their eggs.\r\nThe only sounds of nature were the buzz of a bumble-bee feeding among\r\nthe flowers of the _Brunella_ at my side, and an occasional drawl of a\r\ndog-day locust from the branches of the sycamore which threw a\r\ngrateful shade about me.\r\n\r\nThe sunfish \"hung motionless\" in the water, their heads towards me,\r\nholding their position only by a slow flapping of their dorsal and\r\npectoral fins. Their nesting time over, their season's labor ended, it\r\nwas with them, as with many other beings, a time of languor.\r\n\r\nThese long-eared fishes are the lords and ladies of the respective\r\npools wherein they abide. When they move other smaller fry clear the\r\nway. If a worm or gnat, falling upon the surface, tempts them, it is\r\ntheirs. A leaf falls near them and is seemingly unnoticed--a fly, and\r\nhow quickly their dormant energy is put into motion. With a dart and a\r\ngulp the insect is swallowed, and a new stage of waiting expectancy is\r\nushered in.\r\n\r\nHow admirably fitted their form for cleaving the water! They often\r\nseem to glide rather than propel themselves through its depths. Again,\r\nhow swiftly the caudal fin moves when with straight unerring motion\r\nthey dart upon their prey. At times one turns his body sideways, and,\r\nwith a slow, upward-gliding motion, moves toward some object on the\r\nsurface which is doubtfully \"good to eat.\" He even takes it into his\r\nmouth and then, not having faith in his power to properly digest it,\r\nejects it with force, and turning quickly darts back to the friendly\r\nshadow of a boulder beneath whose sides he has, in time of threatened\r\ndanger, a safe retreat.\r\n\r\nI throw a grasshopper into the pool. Like a flash six of the sunfish\r\nare after it. One reaches it a tenth of a second in advance of the\r\nothers, and with a lightning-like gulp, which disturbs the serenity of\r\nthe surface of the pool, swallows the kicking prey. The energy of the\r\nsun's heat and light, stored in grass, transmitted to move muscles in\r\ngigantic leaps, will, in a short time, wag a caudal fin and propel the\r\nowner through these watery depths.\r\n\r\nYears are thus doubtless spent by these long-eared sunfish in a dreamy\r\nsort of existence, their energies quickened by the vernal season and\r\ngrowing duller on the approach of winter. Excepting the times when\r\nthey are tempted by a wriggling worm on some boy's hook, theirs is a\r\nlife exempt from danger. A kingfisher glancing down from his perch on\r\nthe bent sycamore limb may, at times, discern them and lessen their\r\nranks; but, methinks, the chub minnows, with fewer spines in their\r\ndorsal fins, are more agreeable to the king-fisher's palate. With all\r\nthe tints of the rainbow gleaming from their sides they move to and\r\nfro, the brilliant rulers of these quiet pools.\r\n\r\nThe king or monarch of those noted was most gorgeously arrayed. In\r\naddition to the hues above described, a streak of emerald bordered his\r\ndorsal and caudal fins and was bent around the edge of his upper\r\nlip--a green mustache, as it were. By tolling them with occasional\r\nbits of food I drew him and his retinue close into shore. There, for\r\nsome time they rested, watching eagerly for additional morsels. As I\r\nwas leaving I plucked from my sleeve an ant and threw it towards them.\r\nA dart, a gurgle, a gulp--the leader had leaped half his length from\r\nthe water, and the ant was forever gone. The ripples receded and\r\nfinally disappeared, and the last scene in this tragedy of nature was\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-SLUGS AND CUTTLE-FISH\r\n\r\n(FROM A JOURNAL OF RESEARCHES.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTLE-FISH.]\r\n\r\nI was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of\r\nan Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left\r\nby the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means\r\nof their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very\r\nnarrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to\r\nremove them. At other times they darted, tail first, with the rapidity\r\nof an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same\r\ninstant discoloring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These\r\nanimals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like\r\npower of changing their color. They appear to vary their tints\r\naccording to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in\r\ndeep water, their general shade was brownish-purple, but when placed\r\non the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of\r\na yellowish green. The color, examined more carefully, was a French\r\ngray, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these\r\nvaried in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared\r\nagain by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that\r\nclouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut brown,\r\nwere continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a\r\nslight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but\r\nin a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle.\r\nThese clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be\r\nproduced by the alternate contraction and expansion of minute\r\nvescicles containing variously colored fluids.\r\n\r\nThis cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the\r\nact of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was\r\nmuch amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one\r\nindividual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining\r\nfor a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or\r\ntwo, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its color: it thus\r\nproceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a\r\ndusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above\r\nthe rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water,\r\naccompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what\r\nit was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish,\r\nwhich, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery.\r\nThat it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and\r\nit appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing\r\nthe tube or siphon on the upper side of its body. From the difficulty\r\nwhich these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl\r\nwith ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept\r\nin the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COW-FISH\r\n\r\n(FROM TRAVELS ON THE AMAZON.)\r\n\r\nBY SIR ALFRED RUSSELL WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKULL OF COW-FISH.]\r\n\r\nIt was a female, about six feet long, and nearly five in circumference\r\nin the thickest part. The body is perfectly smooth, and without any\r\nprojections or inequalities, changing into a horizontal semicircular\r\nflat tail, with no appearance whatever of hind limbs. There is no\r\ndistinct neck; the head is not very large, and is terminated by a\r\nlarge mouth and fleshy lips, somewhat resembling those of a cow. There\r\nare stiff bristles on the lips, and a few distantly scattered hairs\r\nover the body. Behind the head are two powerful oval fins, and just\r\nbeneath them are the breasts, from which, on pressure being applied,\r\nflows a stream of beautiful white milk. The ears are minute holes, and\r\nthe eyes very small. The color is a dusky lead, with some large\r\npinkish-white marbled blotches on the belly. The skin is about an inch\r\nthick on the back, and a quarter of an inch on the belly. Beneath the\r\nskin is a layer of fat of a greater or less thickness, generally about\r\nan inch, which is boiled down to make an oil used for light and for\r\ncooking. The intestines are very voluminous, the heart about the size\r\nof a sheep's, and the lungs about two feet long, and six or seven\r\ninches wide, very cellular and spongy, and can be blown out like a\r\nbladder. The skull is large and solid, with no front teeth; the\r\nvertebrae extend to the very tip of the tail, but show no rudiments of\r\nposterior limbs; the fore limbs, on the contrary, are very highly\r\ndeveloped, the bones exactly corresponding to those of the human arm,\r\nhaving even the five fingers, with every joint distinct, yet enclosed\r\nin a stiff inflexible skin, where not a joint can have any motion.\r\n\r\nThe cow-fish feeds on grass at the borders of the rivers and lakes,\r\nand swims quickly with the tail and paddles; and though the external\r\norgans of sight and hearing are so imperfect, these senses are said by\r\nthe hunters to be remarkably acute, and to render necessary all their\r\ncaution and skill to capture the animals. They bring forth one, or\r\nrarely two, young ones, which they clasp in their arms or paddles\r\nwhile giving suck. They are harpooned or caught in a strong net, at\r\nthe narrow entrance of a lake or stream. Each yields from five to\r\ntwenty-five gallons of oil. The flesh is very good, being something\r\nbetween beef and pork, and this one furnished us with several meals,\r\nand was an agreeable change from our fish diet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COW FISH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD RATTLER AND THE KING SNAKE[8]\r\n\r\nBY DAVID STARR JORDAN.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF LELAND STANFORD, JUNIOR, UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n[8] From _The Popular Science Monthly_ by permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"I only know thee humble, bold,\r\n    Haughty, with miseries untold,\r\n    And the old curse that left thee cold,\r\n    And drove thee ever to the sun\r\n    On blistering rocks ...\r\n                        Thou whose fame\r\n    Searchest the grass with tongue of flame,\r\n    Making all creatures seem thy game,\r\n    When the whole woods before thee run,\r\n    Asked but--when all is said and done--\r\n    To lie, untrodden, in the sun!\"\r\n                                  --BRET HARTE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOld Rattler was a snake, of course, and he lives in the King's River\r\nCanon, high up and down deep in the mountains of California.\r\n\r\nHe had a hole behind and below a large, flat granite rock, not far\r\nfrom the river, and he called it his home; for in it he slept all\r\nnight and all winter, but when the sun came back in the spring and\r\ntook the frost out of the air and the rocks, then he crawled out to\r\nlie until he got warm. The stream was clear and swift in the canon,\r\nthe waterfalls sang in the side gulch of Roaring River, the wind\r\nrustled in the long needles of the yellow pines, and the birds called\r\nto their mates in the branches. But Old Rattler did not care for such\r\nthings. He was just a snake, you know, and his neighbors did not think\r\nhim a good snake at that, for he was surly and silent, and his big,\r\nthree-cornered, \"coffin-shaped\" head, set on a slim, flat neck, was\r\nvery ugly to see. But when he opened his mouth he was uglier still,\r\nfor in his upper jaw he had two long fangs, and each one was filled\r\nwith deadly poison. His vicious old head was covered with gray and\r\nwrinkled scales, and his black, beadlike eyes snapped when he opened\r\nhis mouth to find out whether his fangs were both in working order.\r\n\r\nOld Rattler was pretty stiff when he first came from his hole on the\r\nmorning of this story. He had lain all night coiled up like a rope\r\namong the rocks, and his tail felt very cold. But the glad sun warmed\r\nthe cockles of his heart, and in an hour or two he became limber, and\r\nthis made him happy in his snaky fashion. But, being warm, he began to\r\nbe hungry, for it had been a whole month since he had eaten anything.\r\nWhen the first new moon of August came, his skin loosened everywhere\r\nand slipped down over his eyes like a veil, so that he could see\r\nnothing about him, and could not hunt for frogs by the river, nor for\r\nchipmunks among the trees. But with the new moon of September all this\r\nwas over. The rusty brown old coat was changed for a new suit of gray\r\nand black, and the diamond-shaped checkers all over it were clean and\r\nshiny as a set of new clothes out to be.\r\n\r\nThere was a little striped chipmunk running up and down the sugar-pine\r\ntree over his head, pursing his little mouth and throwing himself into\r\npretty attitudes, as though he were the centre of an admiring\r\naudience, and Old Rattler kept a steady eye on him. But he was in no\r\nhurry about it all. He must first get the kinks out of his neck, and\r\nthe cold cramps from his tail. There was an old curse on his family,\r\nso the other beasts had heard, that kept him always cold, and his tail\r\nwas the coldest part of all. So he shook it a little, just to show\r\nthat it was growing limber, and the bone clappers on the end rustled\r\nwith a sharp, angry noise. Fifteen rattles he had in all--fifteen and\r\na button--and to have so many showed that he was no common member of\r\nhis hated family. Then he shook his tail again, and more sharply. This\r\nwas to show all the world that he, Old Rattler, was wide awake, and\r\nwhoever stepped on him would better look out. Then all the big beasts\r\nand little beasts who heard the noise fled away just as fast as ever\r\nthey could; and to run away was the best thing they could do, for when\r\nOld Rattler struck one of them with his fangs all was over with him.\r\nSo there were many in the canon, beasts and birds and snakes too, who\r\nhated Old Rattler, but only a few dared face him. And one of these was\r\nGlittershield, whom men call the King of Snakes, and in a minute I\r\nshall tell you why.\r\n\r\nAnd when Old Rattler was doing all that I have said, the King Snake\r\nlay low on a bed of pine needles, behind a bunch of fern, and watched\r\nhim with keen, sharp eye. The angry buzz of Rattler's tail, which\r\nscared the chipmunks and the bullfrogs and all the rest of the beast\r\nfolk, was music for Glittershield. He was a snake, too, and snakes\r\nunderstand some things better than any of the rest of us.\r\n\r\nGlittershield was slim and wiry in his body, as long as Old Rattler\r\nhimself, but not so large around. His coat was smooth and glossy, not\r\nrough and wrinkly like Old Rattler's, and his upraised head was small\r\nand pretty--for a snake. He was the best dressed of all his kind, and\r\nhe looked his finest as he faced Old Rattler. His head was shiny\r\nblack, his throat and neck as white as milk while all down his body to\r\nthe end of his tail he was painted with rings, first white, then\r\nblack, then crimson, and every ring was bright as if it had just been\r\nfreshly polished that very day.\r\n\r\nSo the King Snake passed the sheltering fern and came right up to Old\r\nRattler. Rattler opened his sleepy eyes, threw himself on guard with a\r\nsnap and a buzz, and shook his bony clappers savagely. But the King of\r\nSnakes was not afraid. Every snake has a weak spot somewhere, and that\r\nis the place to strike him. If he hadn't a weak spot no one else could\r\nlive about him, and then, perhaps he would starve to death at last. If\r\nhe had not some strong points, where no one could harm him, he\r\ncouldn't live himself.\r\n\r\nAs the black crest rose, Old Rattler's tail grew cold, his head\r\ndropped, his mouth closed, he straightened out his coil, and staggered\r\nhelplessly toward his hole.\r\n\r\nThis was the chance for Glittershield. With a dash so swift that all\r\nthe rings on his body--red, white, and black--melted into one purple\r\nflash, he seized Old Rattler by his throat. He carried no weapons, to\r\nbe sure. He had neither fangs nor venom. He won his victories by\r\nforce and dash, not by mean advantage. He was quick and strong, and\r\nhis little hooked teeth held like the claws of a hawk. Old Rattler\r\nclosed his mouth because he couldn't help it, and the fangs he could\r\nnot use were folded back against the roof of his jaw.\r\n\r\nThe King Snake leaped forward, wound his body in a \"love-knot\" around\r\nOld Rattler's neck, took a \"half-hitch\" with his tail about the\r\nstomach, while the rest of his body lay in a curve like the letter S\r\nbetween the two knots. Then all he had to do was to stiffen up his\r\nmuscles, and Old Rattler's backbone was snapped off at the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HE SEIZED OLD RATTLER BY HIS THROAT.\"]\r\n\r\nAll that remained to Glittershield was to swallow his enemy. First he\r\nrubbed his lips all over the body, from the head to the tail, till it\r\nwas slippery with slime. Then he opened his mouth very wide, with a\r\nhuge snaky yawn, and face to face he began on Old Rattler. The ugly\r\nhead was hard to manage, but, after much straining, he clasped his jaws\r\naround it, and the venom trickled down his throat like some fiery\r\nsauce. Slowly head and neck and body disappeared, and the tail\r\nwriggled despairingly, for the tail of the snake folk can not die\r\ntill sundown, and when it went at last the fifteen rattles and the\r\nbutton were keeping up an angry buzz. And all night long the King of\r\nSnakes, twice as big as he ought to be, lay gorged and motionless upon\r\nOld Rattler's rock.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning the little chipmunk ran out on a limb above him,\r\npursed up his lips, and made all kinds of faces, as much as to say, \"I\r\ndid all this, and the whole world was watching while I did it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING SNAKE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A STRANGE LAND\r\n\r\n(FROM SCIENCE SKETCHES.)[9]\r\n\r\nBY DAVID STARR JORDAN.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF LELAND STANFORD, JUNIOR, UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n[9] Copyright, 1896, by A. C. Mclurg & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In one strange land,\r\n    And a long way from home,\r\n    I heard a mighty rumbling, and I couldn't tell where.\"\r\n                                            --NEGRO MELODY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt happened a long time ago, it may be fifty thousand years in round\r\nnumbers, or it may have been twice as many, that a strange thing\r\ntook place in the heart of the Great Mountains. It was in the middle\r\nof the Pliocene epoch, a long, dull time that seemed as if it would\r\nnever come to an end. There was then on the east side of the Great\r\nDivide a deep, rocky basin surrounded by high walls of granite gashed\r\nto the base by the wash of many streams. In this basin, we know not\r\nhow--for the records all are burned or buried--the crust of the earth\r\nwas broken, and a great outflow of melted larva surged up from below.\r\nThis was no ordinary eruption, but a mighty outbreak of the earth's\r\nimprisoned forces. The steady stream of lava filled the whole mountain\r\nbasin and ran out over its sides, covering the country all around so\r\ndeeply that it has never been seen since. More than four thousand\r\nsquare miles of land lay buried under melted rock. No one can tell how\r\ndeep the lava is, for no one has ever seen the bottom. Within its bed\r\nare deep clefts whose ragged walls descend to the depth of twelve\r\nhundred feet, and yet give no glimpse of the granite below, while at\r\ntheir side are mountains of lava whose crags tower a mile above the\r\nbottom of the ravines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT WOULD HISS AND BOIL HIGH IN THE AIR.\"]\r\n\r\nAt last, after many years or centuries--time does not count for much\r\nin these Tertiary days--the flow of melted lava ceased. Its surface\r\ncooled, leaving a high, uneven plain, black and desolate, a hard, cold\r\ncrust over a fiery and smoldering interior. About the crater lay great\r\nropes and rolls of the slowly hardening lava, looking like knots and\r\ntangles of gigantic reptiles of some horrible extinct sort. There was\r\nneither grass nor trees, nor life of any sort. Nothing could grow in\r\nthe coarse, black stone. The rivers and brooks had long since\r\nvanished in steam, the fishes were all dead, and the birds had flown\r\naway. The whole region wore the aspect of the desolation of death.\r\n\r\nBut to let land go to waste is no part of Mother Nature's plan. So\r\neven this far-off corner of her domain was made ready for settlement.\r\nIn the winter she sifted snow on the cold black plain, and in the\r\nsummer the snow melted into a multitude of brooks and springs. The\r\nbrooks gradually wore paths and furrows down the large bed, and the\r\nsands which they washed from one place they piled up in another. The\r\nwinds blew the seeds of grasses about, and willows and aspens crept up\r\nthe mountain-sides. Then came the squirrels, scattering the nuts of\r\nthe pine. Other seeds came too, in other ways, till at last the barren\r\nhillside was no longer barren.\r\n\r\nThe brooks ran over the surface of the crust undisturbed by the fires\r\nwithin, and were clear and cold as mountain brooks should be; but the\r\nrain and melted snow will never all remain on the surface. Some of it\r\nfalls into cracks or joints or porous places in the rock, and from\r\nthis come underground streams or springs. But in this region a stream\r\ncould not run long underground without coming in contact with the old\r\nstill-burning fires. When a crust is formed over the lava, it cools\r\nvery slowly. When the crust is a rod or two deep, the lava within is\r\nalmost as well protected as if it were at the center of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhenever the water came down into the fire, the hot rocks would be\r\nfurious with indignation, and tearing the water to atoms they would\r\nthrow it back to the surface as steam. Then the explosive force of the\r\nsteam would in turn tear up the rocks, making still larger the hole\r\nthrough which the water came. When the rocks were very hot, a little\r\nwater upon them would make a terrible commotion like the shock of an\r\nearthquake. When much water came down, it would hiss and boil high in\r\nthe air, as it tried to break the cushion of steam which came between\r\nit and the lava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUTH OF GEYSER.]\r\n\r\nAnd all this went on in hundreds of places and maybe for thousands of\r\nyears. The hot rocks glowed and sweltered in the ground, and the cold\r\nsnow-water crept after them closer and closer, while more and more\r\nvigorously the rocks resented the intrusion. Sometimes the water would\r\ngo down in a mass through a cleft, when it would be hurled bodily the\r\nvery way it came. At other times the water came down little by little,\r\ninsinuating itself into many places at once. Then the hot rocks threw\r\nit back in many little honeycomb channels, and by the spreading of\r\nthese channels the rocks were at last crumbled to pieces. The hard\r\nblack lava on the glass-like obsidian were changed to white kaolin as\r\nsoft and powdery as chalk. And as the water fought its way, gaining a\r\nlittle every year, steadily working between the joints in the enemy's\r\narmor and as surely being thrown back with violence if it penetrated\r\ntoo far, the animals and the plants followed in the wake of the\r\nwater, and took possession of the territory as fast as it was won.\r\n\r\nAt last the Pliocene times were over, for all times come to an end.\r\nThe one sure thing on the earth is the certainty of change. With the\r\nchange of time came on the earth's great winter. The snow-drifts on\r\nthe lava were piled up mountain-high. Snow is but ice gathered in\r\nlittle fragments which will grow solid under pressure. As the snow\r\naccumulated it began to move, forming great rivers of ice which ran\r\ndown the courses of the stream. And as these slowly moving, gigantic\r\nice-rivers tore away huge blocks of lava and pushed them down the\r\nmountain-sides, where the rocks had been softened by the action of\r\nsteam, the ice wore out deep valleys, and everything that it touched\r\nwas smoothed and polished. The winter of the great Ice age lasted a\r\nvery long time, many thousands of years; but, long as it was and long\r\nago, it came at last to an end--not to a full stop, of course, for\r\neven now, some of its snow still lingers on the highest peaks that\r\nsurround the lava-beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"CUTTING DEEP GORGES OR CANONS.\"]\r\n\r\nThen the winters grew shorter and the summers longer. The south winds\r\nblew and the ice melted away, first from the plain and then from the\r\nmountains. The water ran down the sides of the lava-bed, cutting deep\r\ngorges or canons, so deep that the sun can hardly see the bottom. And\r\ninto the joints and clefts of the rocks more and more water went, to\r\nbe hurled back with greater and greater violence, for all the waters\r\nof all the snow cannot put out a mile deep of fire.\r\n\r\nIn the old depressions where the ice had chiselled away the softer\r\nrocks, there were formed lakes of the standing water, and one of these\r\nwas more than thirty miles long, winding in and out among the\r\nmountain-ridges. In the lake bottom the water soaked through down to\r\nthe hot lava below, from which it was thrown boiling back to the\r\nsurface again, fountains of scalding water in the icy lake.\r\n\r\nThe cold Ice age has killed all the plants in the region; and it had\r\ndriven off the animals that could be driven, and had then buried the\r\nrest. But when the snow was gone the creatures all came back again.\r\nGrass and meadow-flowers of a hundred kinds came up from the valleys\r\nbelow. The willow and the aspen took their place again by the\r\nbrook-side, and the red fir and the mountain pine covered the hills\r\nwith their sombre green. The birds came back. The wild goose swam and\r\nscreamed, and the winter wren caroled his bright song--loudest when\r\nthere seemed least cause for rejoicing. The beaver cut his timber and\r\npatiently worked at his dams. The thriftless porcupine destroyed a\r\ntree for every morning meal. The gray jay, the \"camp robber,\" followed\r\nthe Indians about in hope that some forgotten piece of meat or of\r\nboiled root might fall to his share; while the buffalo, the bear, and\r\nthe elk each carried on his affairs in his own way, as did a host of\r\nlesser animals, all of whom rejoiced when this snow-bound region was\r\nat last opened for settlement. Time went on. The water and the fire\r\nwere every day in mortal struggle, and always when the water was\r\nthrown back repulsed, it renewed the contest as vigorously as before.\r\nThe fire retreated, leaving great stretches of land to its enemy, that\r\nit might concentrate its strength where its strength was greatest. And\r\nthe water steadily gained, for the great ocean ever lay behind it. So\r\nfor century after century they wrestled with each other, the water,\r\nthe fire, the snow, the animals and the plants. But the fishes who had\r\nonce lived in the mountain torrents were no longer there. They had\r\nbeen boiled and frozen, and in one way or another destroyed or driven\r\naway. Now they could not get back. Every stream had its canon, and in\r\neach canon was a waterfall so high that no trout could leap up.\r\nAlthough they used to try it every day, not one ever succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"AND IN EACH CANON WAS A WATERFALL.\"]\r\n\r\nSo it went on. A great many things happened in other parts of the\r\nworld. America had been discovered and the colonies were feeling their\r\nway toward the Pacific Ocean. And in the vanguard was the famous\r\nexpedition of Lewis and Clarke, which went overland to the mouth of\r\nthe river Columbia. John Colter was a hunter in this expedition, and\r\nby some chance he went across the mountains on the old trail of the\r\nNez Perces Indians which leads across the Divide from the Missouri\r\nwaters to those of the Columbia. When he came back from the Nez Perces\r\ntrail he told most wonderful tales of what he had seen at the head of\r\nthe Missouri. There were cataracts of scalding water which shot\r\nstraight up into the air; there were blue ponds hot enough to boil\r\nfish; there were springs that came up snorting and steaming, and which\r\nwould turn trees into stone; the woods were full of holes from which\r\nissued streams of sulphur; there were canons of untold depth with\r\nwalls of ashes full of holes which let off steam like a locomotive,\r\nand there were springs which looked peaceful enough, but which at\r\ntimes, would burst like a bomb.\r\n\r\nIn short, every one laughed at Colter and his yarns, and this place\r\nwhere all lies were true was familiarly known as \"Colter's Hell.\" But\r\nfor once John Colter told the truth, and the truth could not easily be\r\nexaggerated. But no one believed him. When others who afterwards\r\nfollowed him over the Nez Perces trail told the same stories, people\r\nsaid they had been up to \"Colter's Hell\" and had learned to lie.\r\n\r\nBut, as time passed, other men told what they had seen, until, in\r\n1870, a sort of official survey was made under the lead of Washburne\r\nand Doane. This party got the general bearings of the region, named\r\nmany of the mountains, and found so much of interest that the next\r\nyear Dr. Hayden, the United States Geologist, sent out a party for\r\nsystematic exploration. The Hayden party came up from Colorado on\r\nhorseback, through dense and tangled forests, across mountain\r\ntorrents, and other craggy peaks. The story of this expedition has\r\nbeen most charmingly told by its youngest member, another John\r\nCoulter. Professor Coulter was the botanist of the survey, and he won\r\nthe first of his many laurels on this expedition. In 1872, acting on\r\nHayden's report, Congress took the matter in hand and set apart this\r\nwhole region as a \"public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit\r\nand enjoyment of the people,\" and such it remains to this day.\r\n\r\nBut, while only of late this region has had a public history, the\r\nlong-forgotten years between the Glacial period and the expedition of\r\nLewis and Clarke were not without interest in the history of the\r\ntrout. For all these years the fishes have been trying to mount the\r\nwaterfalls in order to ascend to the plateau above. Year after year,\r\nas the spawning-time came on, they leaped against the falls of the\r\nGardiner, the Gibbon, and the Firehole Rivers, but only to fall back\r\nimpotent in the pools at their bases. But the mightiest cataract of\r\nall, the great falls of the Yellowstone, they finally conquered, and\r\nin this way it was done: not by the trout of the Yellowstone River,\r\nbut by their brothers on the other side of the Divide. These followed\r\nup the Columbia to the head-waters of the Snake River, its great\r\ntributary, past the beautiful Heart Lake, and then on to the stream\r\nnow called Pacific Creek, which rises on the very crest of the\r\nDivide. In the space between this stream, which flows west to help\r\nform the Snake River, and a smaller stream now called Atlantic Creek,\r\nflowing down the east slope of the Divide, the great chain of the\r\nRocky Mountains shrinks to a narrow plateau of damp meadow, not a\r\nfourth of a mile in width; and some years, when the snows are heavy\r\nand melt late in the spring, this whole region is covered with\r\nstanding water. The trout had bided their time until they found it so,\r\nand now they were ready for action. Before the water was drained they\r\nhad crossed the Divide and were descending on the Atlantic side toward\r\nthe Yellowstone Lake. As the days went by, this colony of bold trout\r\nspirits grew and multiplied and filled the waters of the great clear\r\nlake, where their descendants remain to this day. And no other\r\nfishes--not the chub, nor the sucker, nor the white-fish, nor the\r\nminnow, nor the blob--had ever climbed Pacific Creek. None of them\r\nwere able to follow where the trout had gone, and none of them have\r\never been seen in the Yellowstone Lake. What the trout had done in\r\nthis lake--their victories and defeats, their struggles with the bears\r\nand pelicans, and with the terrible worm, joint enemy of trout and\r\npelicans alike--must be left for another story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROUT.]\r\n\r\nSo the trout climbed the Yellowstone Falls by way of the back\r\nstaircase. For all we know, they have gone down it on the other side.\r\nAnd in a similar way, by stealing over from Blacktail Deer Creek, they\r\novercame the Undine Falls in Lava Creek and passed its steep obsidian\r\nwalls, which not all the fishes in the world could climb.\r\n\r\nIn the Gibbon River the cataracts have proved to the trout an\r\nimpassible barrier; but, strangely enough, its despised associate, the\r\nsluggish, chunky blob, the little soft-bodied, smooth, black\r\ntadpole-like fellow, with twinkling eyes and a voracious appetite--a\r\nfish who cannot leap at all--has crossed this barrier. Hundreds of\r\nblob live under the stones in the upper reaches of the stream, the\r\nonly fish in the Gibbon waters. There he is, and it is a standing\r\npuzzle even to himself to know how he got there. We might imagine,\r\nperhaps, that some far-off ancestor, some ancient Queen of the Blobs,\r\nwas seized by an osprey and carried away in the air. Perhaps an eagle\r\nwas watching and forced the osprey to give up its prey. Perhaps in the\r\nstruggle the blob escaped, falling into the river above the falls, to\r\nform the beginning of the future colony. At any rate, there is the\r\ngreat impassable waterfall, the blob above it and below. The osprey\r\nhas its nest on a broken pine tree, above the cataract, and its tyrant\r\nmaster, the bald eagle, watches it from a still higher crag whenever\r\nit goes fishing.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago the Hon. Marshall McDonald, whose duty as United States\r\nFish Commissioner it is to look after the fishes wherever they may be,\r\nsent me to this country to see what could be done for his wards. It\r\nwas a proud day when I set out from Mammoth Hot Springs astride a\r\nblack cayuse, or Indian pony, which answered to the name of Jump,\r\nfollowed by a long train of sixteen other cayuses of every variety of\r\ncolor and character, the most notable of all being a white pony called\r\nTinker. At some remote and unidentified period of her life she had\r\nbucked and killed a tradesman who bestrode her against her will, and\r\nthereby, as in the old Norse legends, she has inherited his strength,\r\nhis wickedness, and his name. And when, after many adventures, I came\r\nback from this strange land and told the story of its fishes other men\r\nwere sent out from Washington with nets and buckets. They gathered up\r\nthe trout and carried them to the rivers above the falls, and now all\r\nthe brooks and pools of the old lava-bed, the fairest streams in the\r\nworld, are full of their natural inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLORS OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n(FROM CHAPTERS IN POPULAR NATURAL HISTORY.)\r\n\r\nBY SIR JOHN LUBBOCK, BART., M.P., F.B.S., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe color of animals is by no means a matter of chance; it depends on\r\nmany considerations, but in the majority of cases tends to protect the\r\nanimal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be\r\nsaid that if coloring is mainly protective, there ought to be but few\r\nbrightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which\r\nvivid colors are themselves protective. The kingfisher itself, though\r\nso brightly colored, is by no means easy to see. The blue harmonizes\r\nwith the water, and the bird as it darts along the stream looks almost\r\nlike a flash of sunlight; besides which, protection is not the only\r\nconsideration. Let us now consider the prevalent colors of animals and\r\nsee how far they support the rule.\r\n\r\nDesert animals are generally the color of the desert. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the lion, the antelope, and the wild ass are all\r\nsand-colored. \"Indeed,\" says Canon Tristram, \"in the desert, where\r\nneither trees, brushwood, nor even undulation of the surface afford\r\nthe slightest protection to its foes, a modification of color which\r\nshall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country is absolutely\r\nnecessary. Hence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird,\r\nwhether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand grouse, and also the fur of all\r\nthe smaller mammals and the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of\r\none uniform sand color.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, while the lion is sand-colored like\r\nthe desert, the long, upright, yellow stripes of the tiger make it\r\nvery difficult to see the animal among the long dry grasses of the\r\nIndian jungles in which it lives. The leopard, again, and other tree\r\ncats are generally marked with spots which resemble gleams of light\r\nglancing through the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe colors of birds are in many cases perhaps connected with the\r\nposition and mode of construction of their nests. Thus, we know that\r\nhen birds are generally less brightly colored than the cocks, and this\r\nis partly, perhaps, because bright colors would be a danger to the\r\nhens while sitting on their eggs. When the nest is placed underground\r\nor in the hole of a tree, etc., we find it no longer to be such an\r\ninvariable rule that the hen bird is dull-colored; but, on the\r\ncontrary, she is then often as gaily colored as the male. Such, for\r\ninstance, is the case with the hen kingfisher, which is one of the\r\nbrightest of British birds and one of the very few which make their\r\nnests underground; the hen woodpecker, which is also gaily colored and\r\nbuilds in hollow trees, forms a second instance.\r\n\r\nIn the few cases where the hens are as conspicuously colored as the\r\ncocks, and yet the nest is open to view, we generally find that the\r\nhens are strong, pugnacious birds, and well able to defend themselves.\r\nThere are even instances, though these are comparatively rare, in\r\nwhich the hens are more brilliantly colored than the cocks; and it is\r\nan interesting fact that it is then the cocks, and not the hens, which\r\nhatch the eggs.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems to be a rule, with very few exceptions, that when\r\nboth the cocks and hens are of strikingly gay or conspicuous colors,\r\nthe nest is such as to conceal the sitting bird; while, whenever there\r\nis a striking contrast of colors, the nest is open and the sitting\r\nbird exposed to view.\r\n\r\nAgain, most fishes are dark above and pale below. This points to the\r\nsame fact, for when one looks down into the dark water, the dark color\r\nof their backs renders them the less easy to distinguish; while, to an\r\nenemy looking up from below, the pale belly would be less conspicuous\r\nagainst the light of the sky. Those fishes which live deep down in the\r\ndepths of the ocean present no such contrast between the upper and\r\nunder surface. Many of the smaller animals which live in the sea are\r\nas transparent as glass, and are consequently very difficult to\r\ndistinguish.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that if animals were really colored with\r\nreference to concealment, sheep would be green, like grass. This,\r\nhowever, is quite a mistake. If they were green they would really be\r\nmore easy to see. In the gray of the morning and the evening twilight,\r\njust the time when wild animals generally feed, gray and stone colors\r\nare most difficult to distinguish. Sheep were originally mountain\r\nanimals, and every one who has ever been on a mountain-side knows how\r\ndifficult it is to distinguish a sheep, at some distance, from a mass\r\nof stone or rock.\r\n\r\nIt is, again, a great advantage to the rabbit and hare to be colored\r\nlike earth; black or white rabbits are more easy to see, and\r\nconsequently more likely to be killed. This, however, does not apply\r\nto those which are kept in captivity, and we know that tame rabbits\r\nare often black and white. Again, in the far north, where for months\r\ntogether the ground is covered with snow, the white color, which would\r\nbe a danger here, becomes an advantage; and many Arctic animals, like\r\nthe polar bear and polar hare, are white, while others, such as the\r\nmountain hare and ptarmigan, change their color, being brown in summer\r\nand white in winter. So are the Arctic fox and the ermine, to whom it\r\nis then an advantage to be white, not to avoid danger, but in order\r\nthat they may be the more easily able to steal unperceived upon their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases in which certain insects escape danger by their\r\nsimilarity to plants are well known; the leaf insect and the\r\nwalking-stick insect are familiar and most remarkable cases. The larvae\r\nof insects afford, also, many interesting examples, and in other\r\nrespects teach us, indeed, many instructive lessons. It would be a\r\ngreat mistake to regard them as merely preparatory stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the perfect insect. They are much more than this, for\r\nexternal circumstances act on the larvae, as well as on the perfect\r\ninsect: both, therefore, are liable to adaptation. In fact, the\r\nmodifications which insect larvae undergo may be divided into two\r\nkinds--developmental, or those which tend to approximation to the\r\nmature form; and adaptational or adaptive, those which tend to suit\r\nthem to their own mode of life.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that the forms of larvae do not depend on\r\nthose of the mature insect. In many cases, for instance, very similar\r\nlarvae produce extremely dissimilar insects. In other cases, similar,\r\nor comparatively similar, perfect insects have very dissimilar larvae.\r\nIndeed, a classification of insects founded on larva would be quite\r\ndifferent from that founded on the perfect insects. The group to which\r\nthe bees, wasps, and ants belong, for instance, and which, so far as\r\nthe perfect insects are concerned, form a very natural division, would\r\nbe divided into two; or rather one portion of them--namely, the\r\nsaw-flies--would be united to the butterflies and moths. Now, why do\r\nthe larvae of saw-flies differ from those of their allies, and resemble\r\nthose of butterflies and moths? It is because their habits differ from\r\nthose of ants and bees, and they feed on leaves like ordinary\r\ncaterpillars.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the form changes considerably during the larval state.\r\nFrom this point of view, the transformations of a small beetle, called\r\n_Sitaris_, which have been carefully observed by M. Fabre, are\r\npeculiarly interesting.\r\n\r\nThe genus Sitaris, which is allied to the blister-fly and to the\r\noil-beetle, is parasitic on a kind of solitary bee which excavates\r\nsubterranean galleries, each leading to a cell. The eggs of the\r\nbeetle, which are deposited at the entrance of the galleries made by\r\nthe bees, are hatched at the end of September or beginning of\r\nOctober, and we might not unnaturally expect that the young larvae,\r\nwhich are active little creatures with six serviceable legs, would at\r\nonce eat their way into the cells of the bee. No such thing: till the\r\nmonth of April following they remain without leaving their birthplace,\r\nand consequently without food; nor do they in this long time change\r\neither in form or size. M. Fabre ascertained this, not only by\r\nexamining the burrow of the bees, but also by direct observations of\r\nsome young larvae kept in captivity. In April, however, his captives at\r\nlast awoke from their long lethargy, and hurried anxiously about their\r\nprisons. Naturally inferring that they were in search of food, M.\r\nFabre supposed that this would consist either of the larvae or pupae of\r\nthe bee, or of the honey with which it stores its cell. All three were\r\ntried without success. The first two were neglected; and the larvae,\r\nwhen placed on the latter, either hurried away or perished in the\r\nattempt, being evidently unable to deal with the sticky substance. M.\r\nFabre was in despair. The first ray of light came to him from our\r\ncountryman Newport, who ascertained that a small parasite found on one\r\nof the wild bees was, in fact, the larva of the oil-beetle. The larvae\r\nof Sitaris much resembled this larva. Acting on this hint, M. Fabre\r\nexamined many specimens of the bee, and found on them at last the\r\nlarvae of his Sitaris. The males of the bee emerge from the pupae sooner\r\nthan the females, and M. Fabre ascertained that, as they come out of\r\ntheir galleries, the little Sitaris larvae fasten upon them. Not,\r\nhowever, for long: instinct teaches them that they are not yet in the\r\nstraight path of development; and, watching their opportunity, they\r\npass from the male to the female bee. Guided by these indications, M.\r\nFabre examined several cells of the bee; in some, the egg of the bee\r\nfloated by itself on the surface of the honey; in others, on the egg,\r\nas on a raft, sat the still more minute larva of the Sitaris. The\r\nmystery was solved. At the moment when the egg is laid, the Sitaris\r\nlarva springs upon it. Even while the poor mother is carefully\r\nfastening up her cell, her mortal enemy is beginning to devour her\r\noffspring; for the egg of the bee serves not only as a raft, but as a\r\nrepast. The honey, which is enough for either, would be too little for\r\nboth; and the Sitaris, therefore, at its first meal, relieves itself\r\nfrom its only rival. After eight days the egg is consumed, and on the\r\nempty shell the Sitaris undergoes its first transformation, and makes\r\nits appearance in a very different form.\r\n\r\nThe honey, which was fatal before, is now necessary--the activity,\r\nwhich before was necessary, is now useless; consequently, with the\r\nchange of skin, the active, slim larva changes into a white fleshy\r\ngrub, so organized as to float on the surface of the honey, with the\r\nmouth beneath and the breathing-holes above the surface; for insects\r\nbreathe, not as we do through the mouth, but through a row of holes\r\narranged along the side. In this state it remains until the honey is\r\nconsumed; then the animal contracts, and detaches itself from its\r\nskin, within which the further transformations take place. In the next\r\nstage the larva has a solid corneous envelope and an oval shape, and,\r\nin its color, consistency, and immobility, resembles the chrysalis of\r\na fly. The time passed in this condition varies much. When it has\r\nelapsed, the animal moults again, again changes its form; after this,\r\nit becomes a pupa, without any remarkable peculiarities. Finally,\r\nafter these wonderful changes and adventures, in the month of August\r\nthe perfect beetle makes its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. THE CATERPILLAR OF THE MARBLED WHITE BUTTERFLY\r\n(_Arge galathea_).]\r\n\r\nIn fact, whenever in any group we find differences in form or color,\r\nwe shall always find them associated with differences in habit. Let us\r\ntake the case of Caterpillars. The prevailing color of caterpillars is\r\ngreen, like that of leaves. The value of this to the young insect, the\r\nprotection it affords, are obvious. We must all have observed how\r\ndifficult it is to distinguish small green caterpillars from the\r\nleaves on which they feed. When, however, they become somewhat larger,\r\ntheir form betrays them, and it is important that there should be\r\ncertain marks to divert the eye from the outlines of the body. This is\r\neffected, and much protection is given, by longitudinal lines (Fig. 1),\r\nwhich accordingly are found on a great many caterpillars. These\r\nlines, both in color and thickness, much resemble some of the lines on\r\nleaves (those, for instance, of grasses), and also the streaks of\r\nshadow which occur among foliage. If this be the explanation of them,\r\nthen they ought to be wanting, as a general rule, in very small\r\ncaterpillars, and should prevail most among those which feed on or\r\namong grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE EYED HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Smerinthus ocellatus_).]\r\n\r\nNow, similar lines occur on a great number of caterpillars belonging\r\nto most different groups of butterflies and moths, as you may see by\r\nturning over the illustrations of any monograph of the group. They\r\nexist among the Hawk-moths--as, for instance, in the Humming-bird\r\nHawk-moth; they occur in many butterflies, especially in those which\r\nfeed on grass; and in many moths. But you will find that the smallest\r\ncaterpillars rarely possess these white streaks. As regards the second\r\npoint, also, the streaks are generally wanting in caterpillars which\r\nfeed on large-leaved plants. The _Satyridae_, on the contrary, all\r\npossess them, and all live on grass. In fact we may say, as a general\r\nrule, that these longitudinal streaks only occur on caterpillars which\r\nlive on or among narrow-leaved plants. As the insect grows, these\r\nlines often disappear on certain segments, and are replaced by\r\ndiagonal lines. These diagonal lines (Fig. 2) occur in a great many\r\ncaterpillars, belonging to the most distinct families of butterflies\r\nand moths. They come off just at the same angle as the ribs of leaves,\r\nand resemble them very much in general effect. They occur also\r\nespecially on species which feed on large-leaved plants; and I believe\r\nI may say that though a great many species of caterpillars present\r\nthese lines, they rarely, if ever, occur in species which live on\r\ngrass; while, on the contrary, they are very frequent in those\r\nspecies which live on large-leaved plants.\r\n\r\nIt might at first be objected to this view that there are many cases,\r\nas in the Elephant-Hawk-moth, in which caterpillars have both. A\r\nlittle consideration, however, will explain this. In small\r\ncaterpillars these oblique lines would be useless, because they must\r\nhave some relation, not only in color, but in their distance apart, to\r\nthe ribs of the leaves. Hence, while there are a great many species\r\nwhich have, longitudinal lines when young, and diagonal ones when they\r\nare older and larger, there is not, I believe, a single one which\r\nbegins with diagonal lines, and then replaces them with longitudinal\r\nones. The disappearance of the longitudinal lines on those segments\r\nwhich have diagonal ones, is striking, where the lines are marked. It\r\nis an advantage, because white lines crossing one another at such an\r\nangle have no relation to anything which occurs in plants, and would\r\nmake the creature more conspicuous. When, therefore, the diagonal\r\nlines are developed, the longitudinal ones often disappear. There is\r\none other point in connection with these diagonal lines to which I\r\nmust call your attention.\r\n\r\nIn many species they are white, but in some cases--as, for instance,\r\nin the beautiful green caterpillar of the Privet-Hawk-moth--the white\r\nstreak is accompanied by a colored one, in that case lilac. At first\r\nwe might think that this would be a disadvantage, as tending to make\r\nthe caterpillar more conspicuous; and in fact, if we put one in full\r\nview--for instance, out on a table--and focus the eye on it, the\r\ncolored lines are very striking. But we must remember that the habit\r\nof the insect is to sit on the lower side of the leaf, generally near\r\nthe middle rib, and in the subdued light of such a situation,\r\nespecially if the eye be not looking exactly at them, the colored\r\nlines beautifully simulate a line of soft shadow, such as must always\r\naccompany a strong rib; and I need not tell any artist that the\r\nshadows of yellowish-green must be purplish. Moreover, any one who has\r\never found one of these large caterpillars will, I am sure, agree with\r\nme that it is surprising, when we consider their size and conspicuous\r\ncoloring, how difficult it is to see them.\r\n\r\nBut though the prevailing color of caterpillars is green, there are\r\nnumerous exceptions. In one great family of moths the prevailing color\r\nis brown. These caterpillars, however, escape observation by their\r\ngreat similarity to brown twigs--a resemblance which is heightened by\r\ntheir peculiar attitudes, and in many cases by the existence of warts\r\nor protuberances, which look like buds. Some, however, even of these\r\ncaterpillars, when very young, are green. Again, some caterpillars are\r\nwhite. These feed on and burrow in wood. The Ringlet Butterfly also\r\nhas whitish caterpillars, and this may at first sight appear to\r\ncontradict the rule, since it feeds on grass. Its habit is, however,\r\nto keep at the roots by day, and feed only at night.\r\n\r\nIn various genera we find Black caterpillars, which are of course very\r\nconspicuous, and, so far as I know, not distasteful to birds. In such\r\ncases, however, it will be found that they are covered with hairs or\r\nspines, which protect them from most birds. In these species the bold\r\ndark color may be an advantage, by rendering the hair more\r\nconspicuous. Many caterpillars are black and hairy, but I do not know\r\nany large caterpillar which is black and smooth.\r\n\r\nBrown caterpillars, also, are frequently protected by hairs or spines\r\nin the same way; but, unlike black ones, they are frequently naked.\r\nThese fall into two principal categories: firstly, those which, like\r\nthe Geometridae, put themselves into peculiar and stiff attitudes, so\r\nthat in form, color, and position they closely resemble bits of dry\r\nstick; and, secondly, those which feed on low plants, concealing\r\nthemselves on the ground by day, and only coming out in the dark.\r\n\r\nYellow and yellowish-green caterpillars are abundant, and their color\r\nis a protection. Red and blue, on the contrary, are much less common\r\ncolors, and are generally present as spots.\r\n\r\nMoreover, caterpillars with red lines or spots are generally hairy,\r\nand this for the reason given above. Such species, therefore, would be\r\navoided by birds. There are, no doubt, some apparent exceptions. The\r\nSwallow-tail Butterfly, for instance, has red spots and still is\r\nsmooth; but as it emits a strongly-scented liquid when alarmed, it is\r\nprobably distasteful to birds. I cannot recall any other case of a\r\nBritish caterpillar which has conspicuous red spots or lines, and yet\r\nis smooth.\r\n\r\nBlue is, among caterpillars, even a rarer color than red. Indeed,\r\namong our larger larvae, the only cases I can recall are the Lappets,\r\nwhich have two conspicuous blue bands, the Death's-head Moth, which\r\nhas broad diagonal bands, and two of the Hawk-moths, which have two\r\nbright blue oval patches on the third segment. The Lappets are\r\nprotected by being hairy, but why they have the blue bands I have no\r\nidea. It is interesting, that both the other species frequent plants\r\nwhich have blue flowers. The peculiar hues of the Death's-head\r\ncaterpillar, which feeds on the potato, unite so beautifully the brown\r\nof the earth, the yellow and green of the leaves, and the blue of the\r\nflowers, that, in spite of its size, it can scarcely be perceived\r\nunless the eye be focussed exactly upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Oleander Hawk-moth is also an interesting case. Many of the\r\nHawk-moth caterpillars have eye-like spots, to which I shall have to\r\nallude again presently. These are generally reddish or yellowish, but\r\nin this species, which feeds on the periwinkle, they are bright blue,\r\nand in form as well as color closely resemble the blue petals of that\r\nflower. One other species, the Sharp-winged Hawk-moth, also has two\r\nsmaller blue spots, with reference to which I can make no suggestion.\r\nIt is a very rare species, and I have never seen it. Possibly, in this\r\ncase, the blue spots may be an inherited character, and have no\r\nreference to the present habits. They are, at any rate, quite small.\r\n\r\nNo one who looks at any representations of Hawk-moth caterpillars can\r\nfail to be struck by the peculiar coloring of those belonging to the\r\nPine Moth, which differ in style of coloring from all other sphinx\r\nlarvae, having longitudinal bands of brown and green. Why is this?\r\nTheir _habitat_ is different. They feed on the leaves of the pinaster,\r\nand their peculiar coloring offers a general similarity to the brown\r\ntwigs and narrow green leaves of a conifer. There are not many species\r\nof butterflies or moths which feed on the pine, but there are a few:\r\nand most, if not all of them, have a very analogous style of coloring\r\nto that of the Pine Moth, while the latter has also tufts of\r\nbluish-green hair which singularly mimic the leaves of the pine. It is\r\nstill more remarkable that in a different order of insects we again\r\nfind species--for instance one of the saw-flies--which live on the\r\npine, and in which the same style of coloring is repeated.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a single group, and see how far we can explain its\r\nvarious colors and markings, and what are the lessons which they teach\r\nus. For this purpose, I think I cannot do better than select the larvae\r\nof the Hawk-moths, which have just been the subject of a masterly work\r\nby Dr. Weissmann, from which most of the following facts are taken.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this group are very different in color--green,\r\nwhite, yellow, brown, sometimes even gaudy, varied with spots,\r\npatches, streaks, and lines. Now, are these differences merely casual\r\nand accidental, or have they a meaning and a purpose? In many, perhaps\r\nin most cases, the markings serve for the purpose of concealment.\r\nWhen, indeed, we see caterpillars represented on a white sheet of\r\npaper, or if we put them on a plain table, and focus the eye on them,\r\nthe colors and markings would seem, if possible, to render them even\r\nmore conspicuous; but amongst the intricate lines and varied colors of\r\nfoliage and flowers, and if the insect be a little out of focus, the\r\neffect is very different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Full grown. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). First stage.]\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the Elephant Hawk-moth. The caterpillars (Fig. 3),\r\nas represented in most entomological works, are of two varieties, most\r\nof them brown, but some green. Both have a white line on the three\r\nfirst segments; two remarkable eye-like spots on the fourth and fifth,\r\nand a very faint median line; and are rather more than four inches\r\nlong. I will direct your attention specially, for the moment, to three\r\npoints:--What do the eye-spots and the faint lateral line mean? and\r\nwhy are some green and some brown, offering thus such a marked\r\ncontrast to the leaves of the small epilobe on which they feed? Other\r\nquestions will suggest themselves later. I must now call your\r\nattention to the fact, that when the caterpillars first quit the egg,\r\nand come into the world (Fig. 4), they are quite different in\r\nappearance, being, like so many other small caterpillars, bright\r\ngreen, and almost exactly the color of the leaves on which they feed.\r\nThat this color is not the necessary or direct consequence of the\r\nfood, we see from the case of quadrupeds, which, as I need scarcely\r\nsay, are never green. It is, however, so obviously a protection to\r\nsmall caterpillars, that this explanation of their green color\r\nsuggests itself to every one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Second Stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Just before the second moult.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Third Stage.]\r\n\r\nAfter five or six days, and when they are about a quarter of an inch\r\nin length, they go through their first moult. In their second stage\r\n(Fig. 5), they have two white lines, stretching along the body from\r\nthe horn to the head; and after a few days (Fig. 6), but not at first,\r\ntraces of the eye-spots appear on the fourth and fifth segments, shown\r\nby a slight wave in the upper line. After another five or six days,\r\nand when about half an inch in length, our caterpillars moult again.\r\nIn their third stage (Fig. 7), the commencement of the eye-spots is\r\nmore marked, while, on the contrary, the lower longitudinal line has\r\ndisappeared. After another moult (Fig. 8), the eye-spots are still\r\nmore distinct, the white gradually becomes surrounded by a black line,\r\nwhile in the next stage (Fig. 9) the centre becomes somewhat violet.\r\nThe white lines have almost or entirely disappeared, and in some\r\nspecimens faint diagonal lines make their appearance. Some few assume\r\na brownish tint, but not many. A fourth moult takes place in seven or\r\neight days, and when the caterpillars are about an inch and a half in\r\nlength. Now, the difference shows itself still more between the two\r\nvarieties, some remaining green, while the majority become brown. The\r\neye-spots are more marked, and the pupil more distinct, the diagonal\r\nlines plainer, while the white line is only indicated on the first\r\nthree, and on the eleventh segment. The last stage (Fig. 9) has been\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Fourth Stage.]\r\n\r\nNow, the principal points to which I wish to draw attention are (1)\r\nthe green color, (2) the longitudinal lines, (3) the diagonal lines,\r\n(4) the brown color, and (5) the eye-spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ELEPHANT HAWK-MOTH\r\n(_Chaerocampa elpenor_). Fifth Stage.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the first three, however, I think I need say no more. The\r\nvalue of the green color to the young larva is obvious; nor is it much\r\nless clear that when the insect is somewhat larger, the longitudinal\r\nlines are a great advantage, while subsequently diagonal ones become\r\neven more important.\r\n\r\nThe next point is the color of the mature caterpillars. We have seen\r\nthat some are green, and others brown. The green ones are obviously\r\nmerely those which have retained their original color. Now for the\r\nbrown color. This probably makes the caterpillar even more conspicuous\r\namong the green leaves than would otherwise be the case. Let us see,\r\nthen, whether the habits of the insect will throw any light upon the\r\nriddle. What would you do if you were a big caterpillar? Why, like\r\nmost other defenceless creatures, you would feed by night, and lie\r\nconcealed by day. So do these caterpillars. When the morning light\r\ncomes, they creep down the stem of the food plant, and lie concealed\r\namong the thick herbage, and dry sticks and leaves, near the ground;\r\nand it is obvious that under such circumstances the brown color really\r\nbecomes a protection. It might indeed be argued that the caterpillars,\r\nhaving become brown, concealed themselves on the ground; and that we\r\nwere, in fact, reversing the state of things. But this is not so;\r\nbecause, while we may say, as a general rule, that (with some\r\nexceptions due to obvious causes) large caterpillars feed by night and\r\nlie concealed by day, it is by no means always the case that they are\r\nbrown; some of them still retaining the green color. We may then\r\nconclude that the habit of concealing themselves by day came first,\r\nand that the brown color is a later adaptation. It is, moreover,\r\ninteresting to note that while the caterpillars which live on low\r\nplants often go down to the ground and turn brown, those which feed on\r\nlarge trees or plants remain on the under side of the leaves, and\r\nretain their green color.\r\n\r\nThus, in the Eyed Hawk-moth, which feeds on the willow and sallow; the\r\nPoplar Hawk-moth, which feeds on the poplar; and the Lime Hawk-moth,\r\nwhich frequents the lime, the caterpillars all remain green; while in\r\nthose which frequent low plants, such as the Convolvulus Hawk-moth,\r\nwhich frequents the convolvulus; the Oleander Hawk-moth, which feeds\r\nin this country on the periwinkle; and other species, most of the\r\ncaterpillars turn brown. There are, indeed, some caterpillars which\r\nare brown, and still do not go down to the ground--as, for instance,\r\nthose of the Geometridae generally. These caterpillars, however, as\r\nalready mentioned, place themselves in peculiar attitudes, which,\r\ncombined with their brown color, make them look almost exactly like\r\nbits of stick or dead twigs.\r\n\r\nThe last of the five points to which I called your attention was the\r\neye-spots. In some cases, spots may serve for concealment, by\r\nresembling the marks on dead leaves. In one species, which feeds on\r\nthe hippophae, or sea buckthorn, a gray-green plant, the caterpillar\r\nalso is a similar gray-green, and has, when full grown, a single red\r\nspot on each side--which, as Weissmann suggests, at first sight much\r\nresembles in color and size one of the berries of the hippophae. This\r\nmight, at first, be supposed to constitute a danger, and therefore to\r\nbe a disadvantage; but the seeds, though present, are not ripe, and\r\nconsequently are not touched by birds. Again, in another caterpillar,\r\nthere is an eye-spot on each segment, which mimics the flower of the\r\nplant on which it feeds. White spots, in some cases, also resemble the\r\nspots of light which penetrate foliage. In other instances, however,\r\nand at any rate in our Elephant Hawk-moth, the eye-spots certainly\r\nrender the insect more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nNow in some cases, this is an advantage, rather than a drawback.\r\nSuppose that from the nature of its food, from its being covered with\r\nhair, or from any other cause, a small green caterpillar were very\r\nbitter, or disagreeable or dangerous as food, still, in the number of\r\nsmall green caterpillars which birds love, it would be continually\r\nswallowed by mistake. If, on the other hand, it had a conspicuous and\r\npeculiar color, its evil taste would serve to protect it, because the\r\nbirds would soon recognize and avoid it, as has been proved\r\nexperimentally. I have already alluded to a case of this among the\r\nHawk-moths, in a species which, feeding on euphorbia, with its bitter\r\nmilky juice, is very distasteful to birds, and is thus actually\r\nprotected by its bold and striking colors. The spots on our Elephant\r\nHawk-moth caterpillar do not admit of this explanation, because the\r\ninsect is quite good to eat--I mean, for birds. We must, therefore, if\r\npossible, account for these spots in some other way. There can, I\r\nthink, be little doubt that Weissmann is right when he suggests that\r\nthe eye-spots actually protect the caterpillar, by frightening its\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nEvery one must have observed that these large caterpillars--as, for\r\ninstance, that of the small Elephant Hawk-moth (Fig. 10)--have a sort\r\nof uncanny poisonous appearance; that they suggest a small thick snake\r\nor other evil beast, and the so-called \"eyes\" do much to increase the\r\ndeception. Moreover, the segment on which they are placed is swollen,\r\nand the insect, when in danger, has the habit of retracting its head\r\nand front segments, which gives it an additional resemblance to some\r\nsmall reptile. That small birds are, as a matter of fact, afraid of\r\nthese caterpillars (which, however, I need not say, are in reality\r\naltogether harmless), Weissmann has proved by actual experiment. He\r\nput one of these caterpillars in a tray in which he was accustomed to\r\nplace seed for birds. Soon a little flock of sparrows and other small\r\nbirds assembled to feed as usual. One of them lit on the edge of this\r\ntray, and was just going to hop in, when she spied the caterpillar.\r\nImmediately she began bobbing her head up and down, but was afraid to\r\ngo nearer. Another joined her, and then another, until at last there\r\nwas a little company of ten or twelve birds, all looking on in\r\nastonishment, but not one ventured into the tray; while one bird,\r\nwhich lit in it unsuspectingly, beat a hasty retreat in evident alarm,\r\nas soon as she perceived the caterpillar. After watching for some\r\ntime, Weissmann removed it, when the birds soon attacked the seeds.\r\nOther caterpillars also are probably protected by their curious\r\nresemblance to spotted snakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE SMALL ELEPHANT\r\nHAWK-MOTH (_Chaerocampa porcellus_).]\r\n\r\nMoreover, we may learn another very interesting lesson from these\r\ncaterpillars. They leave the egg, as we have seen, a plain green, like\r\nso many other caterpillars, and gradually acquire a succession of\r\nmarkings, the utility of which I have just attempted to explain. The\r\nyoung larva, in fact, represents an old form, and the species, in the\r\nlapse of ages, has gone through the stage which each individual now\r\npasses through in a few weeks. Thus, the caterpillar of _Chaerocampa\r\nporcellus_, a species very nearly allied to the Elephant Hawk-moth,\r\npasses through almost exactly the same stages as that species. But it\r\nleaves the egg with a subdorsal line, which the caterpillar of the\r\nElephant Hawk-moth does not acquire until after its first moult. No\r\none can doubt, however, that there was a time when the new-born\r\ncaterpillars of the small Elephant Hawk-moth were plain green, like\r\nthose of the large one. Again, if we compare the mature caterpillars\r\nof this group of Hawk-moths, we shall find there are some forms which\r\nnever develop eye-spots, but which, even when full grown, correspond\r\nto the second stage of the Elephant Hawk-moth. Here, then, we seem to\r\nhave species still in the stage which the Elephant Hawk-moth must have\r\npassed through long ago.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Deilephila_, of which we have three species--the Euphorbia\r\nHawk-moth, the Galium Hawk-moth, and the Rayed Hawk-moth--is also very\r\ninstructive. The caterpillar of the Euphorbia Hawk-moth begins life of\r\na clear green color, without a trace of the subsequent markings. After\r\nthe first moult, however, it has a number of black patches, a white\r\nline, and a series of white dots, and has, therefore, at one bound,\r\nacquired characters which in the Elephant Hawk-moth, as we have seen,\r\nwere only very gradually assumed. In the third stage, the line has\r\ndisappeared, leaving the white spots. In the fourth, the caterpillars\r\nhave become very variable, but are generally much darker than before,\r\nand have a number of white dots under the spots. In the fifth stage,\r\nthere is a second row of white spots under the first. The caterpillars\r\nnot being good to eat, there is, as has been already pointed out, no\r\nneed for, or attempt at, concealment. Now if we compare the mature\r\ncaterpillars of other species of the genus, we shall find that they\r\nrepresent phases in the development of the Euphorbia Hawk-moth. The\r\nSea Buckthorn Hawk-moth, for instance, even when full grown, is a\r\nplain green, with only a trace of the line, and corresponds,\r\ntherefore, with a very early stage of the Euphorbia Hawk-moth; there\r\nis another species found in South Russia, which has the line, and\r\nrepresents the second stage of the Euphorbia Hawk-moth; another has\r\nthe line and the row of spots, and represents, therefore, the third\r\nstage; lastly, there are some which have progressed further, and lost\r\nthe longitudinal line, but they never acquire the second row of spots\r\nwhich characterizes the last stage of the Euphorbia Hawk-moth.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the individual life of certain caterpillars gives us a\r\nclue to the history of the species in past ages.\r\n\r\nFor such inquiries as this, the larvae of Lepidoptera are particularly\r\nsuitable, because they live an exposed life; because the different\r\nspecies, even of the same genus, often feed on different plants, and\r\nare therefore exposed to different conditions; and last, not least,\r\nbecause we know more about the larvae of the butterflies and moths than\r\nabout those of any other insects. The larvae of ants all live in the\r\ndark; they are fed by the perfect ants, and being therefore all\r\nsubject to very similar conditions, are all very much alike. It would\r\npuzzle even a good naturalist to determine the species of an ant\r\nlarva, while, as we all know, the caterpillars of butterflies and\r\nmoths are as easy to distinguish as the perfect insects; they differ\r\nfrom one another as much as, sometimes more than, the butterflies and\r\nmoths themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are five principal types of coloring among caterpillars. Those\r\nwhich live inside wood, or leaves, or underground, are generally of a\r\nuniform pale hue; the small leaf-eating caterpillars are green, like\r\nthe leaves on which they feed. The other three types may, to compare\r\nsmall things with great, be likened to the three types of coloring\r\namong cats. There are the ground cats, such as the lion or puma, which\r\nare brownish or sand color, like the open places they frequent. So\r\nalso caterpillars which conceal themselves by day at the roots of\r\ntheir food-plant, tend, as we have seen, even if originally green, to\r\nassume the color of earth. Nor must I omit to mention the\r\n_Geometridae_, to which I have already referred, and which, from their\r\nbrown color, their peculiar attitudes, and the frequent presence of\r\nwarts or protuberances, closely mimic bits of dry stick. That the\r\ncaterpillars of these species were originally green, we may infer from\r\nthe fact that some of them at least are still of that color when first\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nThen there are the spotted or eyed cats, such as the leopard, which\r\nlive among trees; and their peculiar coloring renders them less\r\nconspicuous by simulating spots of light which penetrate through\r\nfoliage. So also many caterpillars are marked with spots, eyes, or\r\npatches of color. Lastly, there are the jungle cats, of which the\r\ntiger is the typical species, and which have stripes, rendering them\r\nvery difficult to see among the brown grass which they frequent. It\r\nmay, perhaps, be said that this comparison fails, because the stripes\r\nof tigers are perpendicular, while those of caterpillars are either\r\nlongitudinal or oblique. This, however, so far from constituting a\r\nreal difference, confirms the explanation; because in each case the\r\ndirection of the lines follows that of the foliage. The tiger, walking\r\nhorizontally on the ground, has transverse bars; the caterpillar,\r\nclinging to the grass in a vertical position, has longitudinal lines;\r\nwhile those which live on large-veined leaves have oblique lines, like\r\nthe oblique ribs of the leaves.\r\n\r\nRed and blue are rare colors among caterpillars. Omitting minute dots,\r\nwe have six species more or less marked with red or orange. Of these,\r\ntwo are spiny, two hairy, and one protected by scent-emitting\r\ntentacles. The orange medio-dorsal line of the Bedford Butterfly is\r\nnot very conspicuous, and has been omitted in some descriptions. Blue\r\nis even rarer than red; in fact, none of our butterfly larvae can be\r\nsaid to exhibit this color.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the moths. I have taken all the larger species,\r\namounting to rather more than one hundred and twenty; out of which\r\nsixty-eight are hairy or downy; and of these forty-eight are marked\r\nwith black or gray, fifteen brown or brownish, two yellowish-green,\r\none bluish-gray, one striped with yellow and black, and one\r\nreddish-gray. There are two yellowish-green hairy species, which\r\nmight be regarded as exceptions: one, that of the Five-spotted\r\nBurnet-moth, is marked with black and yellow, and the other is\r\nvariable in color, some specimens of this caterpillar being orange.\r\nThis last species is also marked with black, so that neither of these\r\nspecies can be considered of the green color which serves as a\r\nprotection. Thus, among the larger caterpillars, there is not a single\r\nhairy species of the usual green color. On the other hand, there are\r\nfifty species with black or blackish caterpillars, and of these\r\nforty-eight are hairy or downy.\r\n\r\nIn ten of our larger moths the caterpillars are more or less marked\r\nwith red. Of these, three are hairy, one is an internal feeder, four\r\nhave reddish lines, which probably serve for protection by simulating\r\nlines of shadow, and one, the Euphorbia Hawk-moth, is inedible. The\r\nlast, the striped Hawk-moth, is rare, and I have never seen the\r\ncaterpillar; but to judge from figures, the reddish line and spots\r\nwould render it, not more, but less conspicuous amongst the low\r\nherbage which it frequents.\r\n\r\nSeven species only of the larger moths have any blue; of these, four\r\nare hairy, the other three are Hawk-moths. In one, the Death's Head,\r\nthe violet color of the side stripes certainly renders the insect less\r\nconspicuous among the flowers of the potato, on which it feeds. In the\r\nOleander Hawk-moth there are two blue patches, which, both in color\r\nand form, curiously resemble the petals of the periwinkle, on which it\r\nfeeds. In the third species, the small Elephant Hawk-moth, the bluish\r\nspots form the centres of the above-mentioned eye-like spots.\r\n\r\nIn one family, as already mentioned, the caterpillars are very often\r\nbrown, and closely resemble bits of stick, the similarity being much\r\nincreased by the peculiar attitudes they assume. On the other hand,\r\nthe large brown caterpillars of certain Hawk-moths are night feeders,\r\nconcealing themselves on the ground by day; and it is remarkable that\r\nwhile those species, such as the Convolvulus Hawk-moth, which feed on\r\nlow plants, turn brown as they increase in age and size, others, which\r\nfrequent trees, and cannot therefore descend to the ground for\r\nconcealment, remain green throughout life. Omitting these, there are\r\namong the larger species, seventeen which are brown, of which twelve\r\nare hairy, and two have extensile caudal filaments. The others closely\r\nresemble bits of stick, and place themselves in peculiar and stiff\r\nattitudes.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, summing up the caterpillars, both of butterflies and moths,\r\nout of eighty-eight spiny and hairy species, only one is green, and\r\neven this may not be protectively colored, since it has conspicuous\r\nyellow warts. On the other hand, a very great majority of the black\r\nand brown caterpillars, as well as those more or less marked with blue\r\nand red, are either hairy or spiny, or have some special protection.\r\n\r\nHere, then, I think we see reasons, for many at any rate, of the\r\nvariations of color and markings in caterpillars, which at first sight\r\nseem so fantastic and inexplicable. I should, however, produce an\r\nimpression very different from that which I wish to convey, were I to\r\nlead you to suppose that all these varieties have been explained, or\r\nare understood. Far from it; they still offer a large field for study;\r\nnevertheless, I venture to think the evidence now brought forward,\r\nhowever imperfectly, is at least sufficient to justify the conclusion\r\nthat there is not a hair or a line, not a spot or a color, for which\r\nthere is not a reason--which has not a purpose or a meaning in the\r\neconomy of nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCES IN SPIDERS\r\n\r\nBY ELIZABETH G. PECKHAM.[10]\r\n\r\n[10] Abbreviated from the occasional Papers of the Natural History\r\nSociety of Wisconsin, Vol. I., 1889. By permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are, among spiders, two forms of protective modification: the\r\nfirst, including all cases of protective resemblance to vegetable and\r\ninorganic things--that is, all modifications of color or of color and\r\nform that tend to make them inconspicuous in their natural\r\nrelations--I shall call direct protection. The second form, which I\r\nshall call indirect protection, includes two classes, the spiders\r\nwhich are specially protected themselves and those which mimic other\r\ncreatures which are specially protected.\r\n\r\nSpiders are specially protected when they become inedible through the\r\nacquisition of hard plates and sharp spines. The modification of form\r\nis frequently accompanied by conspicuous colors, which warn their\r\nenemies that they belong to an unpalatable class.\r\n\r\nThe second class of indirectly protected spiders--those that mimic\r\nspecially protected creatures--presents some difficulties, since it is\r\nnot always easy to determine whether the purpose of mimicry is\r\nprotection or the capture of prey. The resemblance may, as is\r\nfrequently the case in direct protection, serve both purposes.\r\n\r\nIn looking for instances of protective form and color among spiders we\r\nencounter one difficulty at the outset. The meaning of a protective\r\npeculiarity can be determined only when the animal is seen in its\r\nnatural home. The number of strangely modified forms depicted in\r\ndescriptive works on spiders is enormous. Bodies are twisted,\r\nelongated, inflated, flattened, truncated, covered with tubercles or\r\nspines, enclosed within chitinous plates, colored like bark, like\r\nlichens, like flowers of every imaginable hue, like bird droppings,\r\nlike sand or stones, and in every one of these modifications there is\r\ndoubtless an adaptation of the spider to its surroundings which, when\r\nit is studied out of its natural relations, we can only guess at.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that in these protective resemblances those\r\nfeatures of the portrait are most attended to by nature which produce\r\nthe most effective deception when seen in nature; the faithfulness of\r\nthe resemblance being much less striking when seen in the cabinet....\r\n\r\nDIRECT PROTECTION. RESEMBLANCES TO VEGETABLE AND INORGANIC\r\nTHINGS.--As a general rule the forms and colors of spiders are\r\nadapted to render them inconspicuous in their natural homes. Bright\r\ncolored spiders, ... either keep hidden away or are found upon flowers\r\nwhose tints harmonize with their own. This rule, while it has\r\nnumerous exceptions, is borne out by the great majority of cases. A\r\ngood illustration is found in the genus Uloborus, of which the members\r\nbear a deceptive resemblance to small pieces of bark, or to such bits\r\nof rubbish as commonly become entangled in old deserted webs. The only\r\nspecies in our neighborhood is Uloborus plumipes, which I have almost\r\ninvariably found building in dead branches, where its disguise is more\r\neffective than it would be among fresh leaves. The spider is always\r\nfound in the middle of the web, with its legs extended in a line with\r\nthe body. There has been, in this species, a development along several\r\nlines, resulting in a disguise of considerable complexity. Its form\r\nand color make it like a scrap of bark, its body being truncated and\r\ndiversified with small humps, while its first legs are very uneven,\r\nbearing heavy fringes of hair on the tibia and having the terminal\r\njoints slender. Its color is a soft wood-brown or gray, mottled with\r\nwhite. It has the habit of hanging motionless in the web for hours at\r\na time, swaying in the wind like an inanimate object. The strands of\r\nits web are rough and inelastic, so that they are frequently broken;\r\nthis gives it the appearance of one of those dilapidated and deserted\r\nwebs in which bits of wind-blown rubbish are frequently entangled....\r\n\r\nOut of seven examples of the species taken during one summer, five\r\nwere found in dead tamarack branches, one on a dead bush, and the\r\nseventh, an interesting variety, under the eaves of a porch. My eye\r\nwas caught by what seemed to be a string of eleven cocoons (it is not\r\ncommon to see more than four in a web). On attempting to take them\r\ndown I was surprised to see one of the supposed cocoons begin to shake\r\nthe web violently. Ten were what they seemed to be, but the eleventh\r\nwas the mother spider, whose color and general appearance was exactly\r\nlike that of the little cases that she had made for her eggs....\r\n\r\nWe come now to a large and interesting class in genus Epeira. I refer\r\nto those species, mostly nocturnal, which are protected during the\r\nday, not by hiding in crevices, nor in any way actually getting out of\r\nsight, but by the close resemblance which they bear to the bark of the\r\ntrees to which they cling. This resemblance is brought about in two\r\nways; through their color, which is like that of wood or lichens, and\r\nthrough their tuberculated and rugose forms, which resemble rough\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CAEROSTRIS MITRALIS (from Vinson).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--CAEROSTRIS MITRALIS, in profile (from Vinson).]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these forms is C. mitralis, a Madagascar\r\nspecies, which, looked at in profile, probably resembles a woody knot.\r\nThe abdomen is divided into two divergent cones (Fig. 1). The entire\r\nupper surface of the body is covered with conical elevations, which\r\nrender it rough and uneven; the sides of the abdomen are made up of\r\nseveral layers, which form stages, one above another, like the ridges\r\nof bark on a woody excrescence. The legs, formed of wide, flattened\r\nplates, make the base. The color of the spider is yellowish-gray,\r\nvaried with white and dark reddish-brown. It has the habit of perching\r\non a branch and clasping it like a bird, so that the elaborate\r\nmodification of form, which would be useless if the spider hung\r\nexposed in the web, is made as effective as possible.\r\n\r\nTo take an example nearer home, E. infumata is a large, round-bodied\r\nspider, with two humps on the abdomen, which Emerton describes from\r\nNew England as being brown, mottled with white and black; he adds that\r\nwhen it draws in its feet it looks like a lump of dirt. Infumata, in\r\nWisconsin, has always a good deal of bluish-green on the upper surface\r\nof the abdomen. This may be a variety which has been so developed as\r\nto resemble the lichens which cover the tree to which it clings. It is\r\none of the spiders which bear a good deal of handling without\r\nuncurling its legs, or showing any sign of life. Its humpy form and\r\nits color give it a very inanimate appearance. It is rather common in\r\nour neighborhood and may be caught in the late twilight while building\r\nits web, but to search for it in the daytime, even among the trees\r\nthat it most frequents, is an almost hopeless task. A more grotesque\r\nform is E. stellata, in which the abdomen has not two, but twelve or\r\nfifteen humps. These are so disposed that the edge of the abdomen, all\r\naround, is scalloped. The colors are light and dark brown, modified by\r\ngray and white hairs. This spider remains motionless during the\r\ndaytime, keeping its legs drawn up to its body. It is common on grass\r\nand low bushes. It is not found in Wisconsin, but the description of\r\nit suggests a resemblance to a piece of dead leaf.\r\n\r\nThere are many other spiders in this genus that have humps and are\r\ncolored in brown, gray or dull yellow, as nordmanii, angulata,\r\nsolitaria, etc. It is an almost universal habit among the Epeiridae to\r\ndrop to the ground when threatened, and when a humped gray or brown\r\nspider drops to the ground and draws in its legs it is nearly\r\nindistinguishable from the lumps of earth, sticks and stones that\r\nsurround it.\r\n\r\nOne of the Therididae which has the same protection is Ulesanis\r\namericana (Fig. 3). The abdomen, which covers the cephalothorax nearly\r\nto the eyes, has a prominent hump in the middle of the back and four\r\nor five others behind. Its color is in shades of brown and yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--ULESANIS AMERICANA (from Emerton).]\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the humped Epeiridae is Thomisus foka, of Madagascar, a\r\nspider which is regarded with great terror by the natives, as being so\r\npoisonous that even its breath is deadly. They say that cattle, when\r\nabout to lie down, look carefully about to see if one of these spiders\r\nis in the neighborhood. This dread is, no doubt, inspired by the\r\nstrange and uncanny aspect of a perfectly harmless creature. It has a\r\nrugose, tuberculated body of trapezoid form, the colors being brown\r\nand reddish, while the whole aspect is crab-like. The thick, short\r\nlegs are reddish, covered with tubercules. The secret of its strange\r\nform is made clear when we learn that it resembles in color and\r\ngeneral appearance the fruit of Hymenaea verrucosa, a tree common in\r\nthe forests where this spider is found.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious forms which must have been developed through\r\nadvantageous variations but which we are unable to explain, is\r\nEriauchenus workmanni (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ERIAUCHENUS WORKMANNI (from Cambridge).]\r\n\r\nEpeira prompta, a variety of parvula, is a common spider in the State\r\nof Wisconsin. It is most frequently seen on cedar bushes, where its\r\ncolor harmonizes with that of the foliage and fruit. During the day it\r\nusually rests on a branch near its web. The back of the abdomen is of\r\na peculiar bluish-green, exactly like that of the lichens growing on\r\ntree trunks. The bluish color is broken by waving black lines which\r\nimitate the curling edges of the lichens. The one represented in the\r\nplate was found on an old cedar which was covered with lichens. It was\r\nkept for two weeks in a glass-covered box, where it spent most of the\r\ntime crouching in a corner. It built no web, but spun some irregular\r\nlines to run about on. It ate gnats, flies, and once a little jumping\r\nspider, S. pulex, which we were keeping in the same box, leaping upon\r\nits prey, as noted by Hentz, like an Attus. This seems a curious habit\r\nto be acquired by an Epeirid, since spiders, as we have noticed among\r\nour captives, are usually dependent for food upon what is caught in\r\ntheir webs. Prompta moves awkwardly, but very rapidly.\r\n\r\nDrapetisca socialis, while quite a different looking spider, is\r\nprotected in the same way--by its resemblance to the bark upon which\r\nit lives. Emerton speaks of finding it on the bark of spruce trees,\r\nwhich it \"closely resembles in color.\" Menge says that it is common\r\nin Prussia, where it is seen in great numbers on fir trees, whose\r\nspotted bark it resembles in color, so that it is not easily seen. We\r\nhave found them, most commonly, upon birch trees, and in this\r\nsituation their color adaptation is perfect. Both the spider and the\r\npeeling bark of the tree are of a light silvery brown, covered with\r\nlittle blackish marks. On the bark these marks are, of course,\r\nirregular, while on the spider they form a pattern made up of straight\r\nand curved lines and dots, the legs being silvery, barred with\r\nblackish.\r\n\r\nAnother little Theridion that is found on birch bark has the same\r\ncolors arranged a little differently. The abdomen above has a large\r\nand peculiarly irregular black patch, which shades off into mottled\r\nbrown and black on the sides and below. The cephalothorax has stripes\r\nof brown and black, and the legs are barred with light and dark brown.\r\n\r\nSpiders that live upon walls, fences, tree trunks, or on the ground\r\nharmonize in color with the surfaces upon which they are found, being\r\nusually gray, brown or yellow, mottled with black and white. This\r\nproposition is so well established as to need but few illustrations.\r\nThe Therididae furnish many examples, as T. murarium, a gray spider\r\nvaried with black and white, said by Emerton to live usually \"under\r\nstones and fences, where it is well concealed by its color\"; and\r\nLophocarenum rostratum, a yellowish-brown spider, found among leaves\r\non the ground. Among the Attidae bright sexual coloring often gains the\r\nascendancy over the protective tints, yet this family gives us good\r\nexamples in such species as M. familiaris and S. pulex.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added an as yet undescribed species which we\r\ndiscovered last season in a neighborhood that we had searched\r\nthoroughly for eight summers. We found the new spider in great\r\nnumbers, but could only detect it by a close scrutiny of the rail\r\nfences on which it lived, its color being dark gray....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. ORNITHOSCATOIDES DECIPIENS (from Cambridge).]\r\n\r\nThe last instance that I shall cite is a predaceous spider which is\r\ndisguised from both its enemies and its prey by an elaborate\r\ncombination of form, color, position, and character of web. I refer to\r\nOrnithoscatoides decipiens (Fig. 5), first described by Forbes and\r\nafterwards by Cambridge, the latter author giving in the same paper\r\ndescriptions of three other species of the same genus, whose habits\r\nhave not been noted, but whose protection is evidently of the same\r\norder as that of decipiens. I give Forbes's interesting account of his\r\ncapture of decipiens, quoting also the remarks by which Cambridge\r\nprefaces his description, since his explanation of the gradual\r\ndevelopment, through Natural Selection, of the spider's deceptive\r\nappearance applies as well to all the cases of protective disguise\r\nwhich have been here enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe capture is described as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"On June 25th, 1881, in the forest near the village of Lampar, on the\r\nbanks of the Moesi river in Sumatra, while my 'boys' were procuring\r\nfor me some botanical specimens from a high tree, I was rather\r\ndreamily looking on the shrubs before me, when I became conscious of\r\nmy eyes resting on a bird-excreta-marked leaf. How strange, I thought,\r\nit is that I have never got another specimen of that curious spider I\r\nfound in Java which simulated a patch just like this! I plucked the\r\nleaf by the petiole while so cogitating, and looked at it half\r\nlistlessly for some moments, mentally remarking how closely that other\r\nspider had copied nature, when, to my delighted surprise, I discovered\r\nthat I had actually secured a second specimen, but the imitation was\r\nso exquisite that I really did not perceive how matters stood for some\r\nmoments. The spider never moved while I was plucking or twirling the\r\nleaf, and it was only when I placed the tip of my little finger on it,\r\nthat I observed that it was a spider, when it, without any\r\ndisplacement of itself, flashed its falces into my flesh.\r\n\r\n\"The first specimen I got was in W. Java, while hunting one day for\r\nLepidoptera. I observed a specimen of one of the Hesperidae sitting, as\r\nis often a custom of theirs, on the excreta of a bird on a leaf; I\r\ncrept near it, intending to examine what they find in what one is\r\ninclined to consider incongruous food for a butterfly. I approached\r\nnearer and nearer, and at last caught it between my fingers, when I\r\nfound that it had as I thought become glued by its feet to the mass;\r\nbut on pulling gently the spider, to my amazement, disclosed itself by\r\nletting go its hold: only then did I discover that I was not looking\r\non a veritable bird's excreta.... The spider is in general color\r\nwhite, spotted here and there with black; on the underside its rather\r\nirregularly shaped and prominent abdomen is almost all white, of a\r\npure chalk white; the angles of the legs are, however, shining\r\njet-black. The spider does not make an ordinary web, but only the\r\nthinnest film on the surface of the leaf. The appearance of the\r\nexcreta rather recently left by a bird on a leaf is well known. There\r\nis a pure white deposit in the centre, thinning out round the margin,\r\nwhile in the central mass are dark portions variously disposed; as the\r\nleaf is rarely horizontal, the more liquid portions run for some\r\ndistance. Now, this spider one might almost imagine to have in its\r\nrambles 'marked and inwardly discerned' what it had observed, and to\r\nhave set about practising the 'wrinkles' gained; for it first weaves a\r\nsmall, irregular patch of white web on some prominent leaf, then a\r\nnarrow streak laid down towards its sloping margin ending in a small\r\nknob; it then takes its place on the centre of the irregular spot on\r\nits back, crosses its black-angled legs over its thorax, and waits.\r\nIts pure white abdomen represents the central mass of the bird's\r\nexcreta, the black legs the dark portions of the slime, while the web\r\nabove described which it has spun represents the more watery marginal\r\npart (become dry), even to the run-off portion with the thickened knob\r\n(which was not accidental, as it occurred in both cases), like the\r\nresidue which semi-fluid substances ending in a drop leave on\r\nevaporation. It keeps itself in position on its back by thrusting\r\nunder the web below it the spines with which the anterior upper\r\nsurfaces of the legs are furnished.\" ...\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE HABITS.--Going along with these forms of\r\nprotective resemblance, we find certain habits which sometimes serve\r\nindependently to protect the spider, but oftener are supplemental to\r\ncolor and form. Many species hide in crevices or in leaves which they\r\nroll up and bind together at the edges. In the Epeiridae some are like\r\nthaddeus, which makes a little tent of silk under a leaf near its web.\r\nThe young thaddeus also makes a tent, but spins its little geometrical\r\nweb on the under side of the leaf, the edges being bent downward. E.\r\ninsularis has the more common habit of forming its tent by drawing the\r\nedges of two or three leaves together with strands of web; in this it\r\nsits all day, but at night descends and occupies the centre of the web\r\nduring the hours of darkness. I have often found it in this position\r\nwhen hunting nocturnal species by lantern light. It is probable that\r\nin tropical countries the monkeys, and perhaps the birds, which devour\r\nthese large Epeiridae have learned to recognize their webs, which are\r\nvery large and conspicuous, and to trace them to their hiding places\r\nclose by; and thus may have arisen the curious habit noticed by Vinson\r\nas possessed by E. nocturna and E. Isabella of destroying the web each\r\nmorning and rebuilding it at night; the spider in this way gaining\r\ngreater security from diurnal enemies.\r\n\r\nAtypus abbotii builds a purse-shaped tube which is found attached to\r\nthe bark of trees, and which has the external surface dark and covered\r\nwith sand. The trap-doors which close the nest of some of the\r\nTerritelariae are wonderful examples of protective industry. They fit\r\nwith such absolute accuracy into the openings of the nests and are so\r\ncovered on the upper side with moss, earth, lichens, etc., as to be\r\nindistinguishable from the surrounding surface.\r\n\r\nThe rectilinear lines which are stretched in front of the webs of\r\nmany Epeirids are useful in taking and sending on to the spider the\r\nshock which tells of an approaching enemy. Some spiders, when danger\r\nthreatens, shake the web so violently as to grow indistinct to the\r\neye, and others, as Pholcus atlanticus, hang by the legs and whirl the\r\nbody rapidly with the same bewildering result....\r\n\r\nA habit common to many spiders, especially among the Epeiridae, is that\r\nof dropping to the ground at the approach of danger and resting\r\nmotionless among the dirt, sticks, leaves, etc., which they resemble\r\nin color. The holding of the body in some peculiar position, as in\r\nUloborus, Hyptioides, and the flower-like Thomisidae, is a\r\nnecessary accompaniment to the color modification.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons of spiders are seldom left exposed and unprotected. We\r\nfind them in corners and crevices, concealed in rolled up leaves or\r\nunder bark. Very often the cocoon itself is covered over with a sheet\r\nof web. In some families the mother carries it about with her attached\r\nto the underside of the abdomen. In other she carries it in her falces\r\nuntil the young are hatched. The cocoons of others, as Uloborus,\r\nArgyrodes, etc., while hung out in the web are still concealed by\r\ndeceptive form and color, or by being covered with rubbish.\r\n\r\nCambridge speaks of A. brunnea, whose cocoons \"are covered over very\r\nsoon after they are made and the eggs deposited in them, with a\r\ncoating of clay, which effectually destroys all their form and beauty.\r\nThis coating of clay answers probably two ends: first, the concealment\r\nof the cocoon and its protection from insect enemies; and, secondly,\r\nthe protection of the eggs from the too powerful rays of the sun, dry\r\nclay being (as is well known) one of the best non-conductors of heat.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar cocoon of C. bisaccata is described by Emerton as\r\nfollows: \"Only one specimen of this (_bisaccata_) was found on a beech\r\ntree at New Haven with two cocoons. These were dark brown, as dark as\r\nthe bark of the tree and as hard. Around the middle of each was a\r\ncircle of irregular points. One of the cocoons was attached by a\r\nstrong stem to the bark, and the other was attached in a similar way\r\nto the first cocoon. The spider held on to one of the cocoons.\" In\r\nthis instance the egg has evidently the same protection as that\r\npossessed by the gray, bark-haunting spiders, with the added advantage\r\nof hardness.\r\n\r\nThe habit of distributing the eggs through a number of cocoons made at\r\nintervals of several days, is protective. In this way, although one or\r\ntwo of the cocoons may be pierced by the ichneumon, there is a chance\r\nthat part of the brood may survive.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT PROTECTION.--The indirectly protected group includes\r\nthose spiders which are rendered inedible by the possession of sharp\r\nspines and chitinous plates, and also those that mimic other specially\r\nprotected creatures.\r\n\r\nThe females of the specially protected group are characterized by the\r\nfollowing attributes:\r\n\r\nTheir inedibility, which they owe to a more or less coriaceous\r\nepidermis and an armature of strong sharp spines (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nTheir brilliant colors--glistening black and white, yellow, fiery\r\ngold, metallic silver, rose-color, blue, orange and blood-red.\r\n\r\nTheir habit of hanging always exposed in the centre of the web.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--GASTERACANTHA CREPIDOPHORA (from Cambridge).]\r\n\r\nIn an interesting discussion of the protective value of color and\r\nmarking in insects, Poulton says that \"the smaller convergent groups\r\nof nauseous insects often present us with ideally perfect types\r\nof warning patterns and colors--simple, crude, strongly\r\ncontrasted--everything subordinated to the paramount necessity of\r\nbecoming conspicuous,\" the memory of enemies being thus strongly\r\nappealed to.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is well illustrated by the Gasteracanthidae. Among\r\nlarvae the warning colors are almost invariably black and white, or\r\nblack (or some very dark color), in contrast with yellow, orange and\r\nred. These are the colors that also constantly recur among the\r\nGasteracanthidae.\r\n\r\nCases that may be more justly considered exceptions to the rule that\r\nthese hard, uneatable spiders are conspicuous are such species as\r\nAcrosoma rugosa (Fig. 7). One of this species was sent me by Mrs.\r\nTreat last summer. It lived for several weeks in my window, making no\r\nregular web, but hanging among a few irregular strands. It ate\r\nnothing, although provided with insects, but drank greedily of water.\r\nIt might seem that its black and white coloring would make it\r\nconspicuous, but in connection with its irregular shape and its way of\r\nhanging motionless in the web it had the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to suppose that the class represented in rugosa is\r\nlike that touched upon by Poulton, in which very protectively colored\r\nlarvae suddenly assume a terrifying aspect on the near approach of an\r\nenemy; still they do enjoy a kind of double protection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--ACROSOMA RUGOSA. Left-hand figure female,\r\nright-hand figure male (from Emerton).]\r\n\r\nThey are inconspicuous, and thus likely to escape attack, but in case\r\nthey are attacked they have still the advantage of being quickly\r\nrejected. This experience cannot be as fatal to them as to the soft\r\nand thin skinned larvae. Their hard covering and projecting spines\r\nwould protect them to such an extent as to give them a fair chance of\r\nsurviving.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the inconspicuous Gasteracanthidae have a decided\r\nadvantage over their bright-colored relatives. The birds, indeed,\r\navoid the conspicuous ones, but their brilliancy serves to attract\r\nanother enemy against which spines are no protection--the hunter wasp,\r\nwhich, as we have seen in the work of Bates, sometimes provisions its\r\nnest wholly with spiders of this family. Mr. Smith gives like\r\ntestimony, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Spines on the abdomen of certain spiders would serve as a protection\r\nagainst vertebrate enemies, though they do not protect against the\r\nhunter wasps, which frequently provision their nests with these\r\nspecies.\" He adds, however, that most of the spiny spiders are common,\r\nand that their colors make them conspicuous; just as butterflies that\r\nare protected by an odor are common and bright-colored....\r\n\r\nMIMICRY.--Mimicry, or the imitation of animal forms, while it\r\nis a form of indirect protection, differs in no essential respect from\r\nthe imitation of vegetable and inorganic things. As Bates has said,\r\nthe object of mimetic tendencies is disguise, and they will work in\r\nany direction that answers this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all respects spiders come under the three laws given by\r\nWallace, as governing the development of mimetic resemblances in\r\nseveral large classes. These laws are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In an overwhelming majority of cases of mimicry, the animals (or\r\nthe groups) which resemble each other inhabit the same country, the\r\nsame district, and in most cases are to be found together on the very\r\nsame spot.\r\n\r\n2. These resemblances are not indiscriminate, but are limited to\r\ncertain groups, which, in every case, are abundant in species and\r\nindividuals, and can often be ascertained to have some special\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n3. The species which resemble or \"mimic\" these dominant groups, are\r\ncomparatively less abundant in individuals, and are often very rare.\r\n\r\nThe second and third of these laws are confirmed by what we know of\r\nmimetic resemblances among spiders. They mimic ants much oftener than\r\nother creatures, and ants are very abundant, are specially protected,\r\nand are much more numerous than the mimetic spiders. To the first\r\nlaw, also, they conform to a great extent, since everything tends to\r\nshow that in tropical America and in Africa the ant and the spider,\r\nthe one mimicked and the other mimicking, are always found together.\r\nSo far as I can discover, however, the ant-like spiders of North\r\nAmerica are not found in company with any species of ant which they\r\nresemble. This may be because they do not mimic any particular\r\nspecies, but only the general ant-like form; or, considering that the\r\ngenera which contain their nearest relatives are much more abundant in\r\nCentral and South America, it may be that these forms were originally\r\ntropical, mimicking some tropical species of ants, and that after the\r\nGlacial Epoch they migrated northward, leaving the ants behind them.\r\nHowever this may be, their peculiar form has served them well, since\r\nthey have maintained themselves as fairly abundant species with a\r\nlower fecundity than is found in any other group of spiders.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which one species mimics another may be divided,\r\naccording to the kind of benefit derived, into four classes: Class 1.\r\nAs a rule, where we find one species mimicking another, the mimicked\r\nspecies possesses some special means of defence against the enemies of\r\nboth. This defence may consist of a disagreeable taste or odor, as in\r\nthe Heliconidae, which are mimicked by other butterflies; of some\r\nspecial weapon of offence, as where wasps and bees are mimicked by\r\nflies and moths, or poisonous vipers by harmless caterpillars; or of a\r\nhard shell, as where the coriaceous beetles are mimicked by those that\r\nare soft-bodied.\r\n\r\nInstances of this rule are exceedingly numerous; indeed, Wallace says\r\nthat specially protected forms are always mimicked; still we have\r\nnothing mimicking our Gasteracanthidae.\r\n\r\nClass 2. The mimetic may prey upon the mimicked species, its disguise\r\nenabling it to gain a near approach to its victims; as the mantis,\r\nmentioned by Bates as exactly resembling the white ants upon which it\r\nfeeds; and the flies which mimic bees, upon which they are parasitic,\r\nand are thus able to enter the nests of the bees and lay eggs on the\r\nlarvae.\r\n\r\nClass 3. The mimetic species may, by its imitation, be protected from\r\nthe attacks of the creature it mimics, as is the case with the\r\ncrickets and grasshoppers which mimic their deadly foe, the hunter\r\nwasp.\r\n\r\nClass 4. The mimetic species may prey upon some creature which is\r\nfound commonly with, and is not eaten by, the mimicked species.\r\n\r\nNo two of these classes are mutually destructive so that in any case\r\nof mimicry a double advantage may be gained.\r\n\r\nLet us see which of these advantages has directed the development of\r\nmimetic tendencies among spiders.\r\n\r\nWhile among beetles and butterflies we most commonly find mimicry of\r\none species by another within the same order, we have no instance of a\r\nspider mimicking another spider. This may be accounted for by the fact\r\nthat the specially protected spiders depend for their safety upon the\r\npossession of hard plates and spinous processes, and although the\r\nhardened epidermis might be imitated (we know that hard-shelled\r\nbeetles are mimicked by others that are soft), spines could scarcely\r\nbe imitated by a soft-bodied creature with sufficient accuracy to\r\ninsure disguise.\r\n\r\nWhile spiders most commonly mimic ants, we hear also of their\r\nimitating beetles, snail-shells, ichneumons and horseflies. There is\r\nalso a curious Madagascar species which looks exactly like a little\r\nscorpion, the resemblance being heightened by its habit of curving its\r\nflexible tail up over its back when irritated.\r\n\r\nThose that resemble beetles comprise nearly all the species of the\r\ngenera Coccorchestes and Homalattus. These are small spiders with\r\nshort, convex bodies. The abdomen fits closely over the cephalothorax,\r\nand the epidermis, which has usually a metallic lustre, is sometimes\r\ncoriaceous. Striking examples are found in H. coccinelloides, which\r\nbears a strong resemblance to beetles of the family Coccinelloidae, and\r\nin C. cupreus, in which certain marks on the abdomen imitate the\r\nelytra of beetles.\r\n\r\nThe following account of a spider which mimics a snail-shell is given\r\nby Mr. G. F. Atkinson;--\r\n\r\n\"An undescribed species of _Cyrtarachne_ mimics a snail-shell, the\r\ninhabitant of which, during the summer and fall, is very abundant on\r\nthe leaves of plants in this place. In the species of Cyrtarachne the\r\nabdomen partly covers the cephalothorax, is very broad at the base, in\r\nthis species broader than the length of the spider, and rounds off at\r\nthe apex. When it rests upon the under side of a leaf with its legs\r\nretracted it strongly resembles one of these snail-shells by the color\r\nand shape of its abdomen. The two specimens which I collected deceived\r\nme at first, but a few threads of silk led me to make the examination.\r\nThe spider seemed so confident of its protection that it would not\r\nmove when I jarred the plant, striking it several hard blows. I\r\npulled the spider forcibly from the leaf, and it did not exhibit any\r\nsigns of movement until transferred to the cyanide bottle.\" ...\r\n\r\nTrimen gives an account of the imitation, by spiders, of horseflies, a\r\ncase falling into Class 2, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Hunting spiders are in some cases very like their prey, as may\r\neverywhere be noticed in the case of the species of Salticus which\r\ncatch horseflies on sunny walls and fences. The likeness is not in\r\nitself more than a general one of size, form and coloring; but its\r\neffect is greatly aided by the actions of the spider, which walks\r\nhurriedly for short distances, stopping abruptly, and rapidly moving\r\nits falces, in evident mimicry of the well-known movements so\r\ncharacteristic of flies.\"\r\n\r\nInstances of spiders mimicking ants are very numerous, and in many\r\ncases the resemblance is so close as to, at first sight, deceive a\r\ntrained naturalist. This resemblance is brought about by the spider's\r\nbody being elongated and strongly constricted, so that it appears to\r\nbe composed of three segments instead of two, by the color, by the way\r\nin which the spider moves about, zig-zagging from side to side like an\r\nant, and by its habit of holding up one pair of its legs and moving\r\nthem in such a way that they look exactly like the antennae of an ant.\r\n\r\nAnts may be regarded as specially protected, by their sharp, acid\r\nflavor, and in some species by the possession of stings or of horny\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nOn the ground that there are birds which do eat ants, and eat them\r\ngreedily, it has been thought by some naturalists that they cannot be\r\nconsidered specially protected creatures, and that, as spiders can\r\ntherefore derive no protection from mimicking them, all cases of such\r\nmimicry depend upon the spider's increased ability to capture the ants\r\nas prey, but I am convinced that this is too hasty a conclusion. It is\r\nunquestionably true that some birds feed almost exclusively upon ants,\r\nbut these are the exceptions. It is a common thing to find that\r\nspecially protected groups, which are safe from the attacks of most\r\ncreatures, have their special enemies. Thus, even the nauseous\r\nHeliconidae are preyed upon by certain spiders and wasps; and bees, in\r\nspite of their stings, are preferred to other insects by the\r\nbee-eaters. Moreover, the ant-devouring birds are found largely among\r\nthe wood-peckers, which eat the ants that run on the trunks of trees,\r\nand are therefore not a source of danger to the ant-like spiders, the\r\nAmerican species of which, so far as I can learn, live entirely upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIn the United States comparatively small numbers of either ants or\r\nspiders are eaten by birds, but in tropical America there are enormous\r\nnumbers of humming-birds feeding almost exclusively upon spiders, and\r\nthere the protective advantage of looking like ants must be of great\r\nimportance to the smaller species.\r\n\r\nBelt considers that the advantages gained by ant-mimicking Central\r\nAmerican spiders lies entirely on the side of protection. In relation\r\nto this subject he says: \"Ant-like spiders have been noticed\r\nthroughout tropical America and also in Africa. The use that the\r\ndeceptive resemblance is to them has been explained to be the facility\r\nit affords them for approaching ants on which they prey. I am\r\nconvinced that this explanation is incorrect, so far as the Central\r\nAmerican species are concerned. Ants, and especially the stinging\r\nspecies are, so far as my experience goes, not preyed upon by any\r\nother insects. No disguise need be adopted to approach them, as they\r\nare so bold that they are more likely to attack a spider than a spider\r\nthem. Neither have they wings to escape by flying, and generally go in\r\nlarge bodies easily found and approached. The use is, I doubt not, the\r\nprotection the disguise affords against small insectivorous birds. I\r\nhave found the crops of some humming-birds full of small, soft-bodied\r\nspiders, and many other birds feed on them. Stinging-ants, like bees\r\nand wasps, are closely resembled by a host of other insects; indeed,\r\nwhenever I found any insect provided with special means of defence I\r\nlooked for imitative forms, and was never disappointed in finding\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe ant-like species are probably protected by their appearance from\r\nthe attacks of many of the larger spiders. We have kept great numbers\r\nof Attidae in captivity, and, although they devoured flies, gnats,\r\nlarvae, and other spiders, they would never touch ants. Among spiders,\r\nhowever, as among birds, we find that certain groups subsist almost\r\nentirely upon ants.\r\n\r\nThe class of spiders whose mimicry protects them from their enemies,\r\nwhether they are birds or other spiders, probably includes at least\r\ntwo of our own ant-like species, Synageles picata and Synemosyna\r\nformica, which, in confinement, are always hungry for gnats, but will\r\nnot touch ants, even of small size.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a class of spiders which mimic the particular species\r\nof ants upon which they prey is not to be questioned, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether the benefit to the spider is increased facility in\r\ncapturing the ant, or whether it is merely protective. It may be that\r\nthe spider, by virtue of its resemblance to the ant, not only gets an\r\nabundant supply of food, but also escapes being eaten itself, and thus\r\nenjoys a double advantage. Both Bates and Wallace take the ground that\r\nthe advantage derived by the spider consists in greater ease in the\r\ncapture of prey, but both of these writers refer to spiders only\r\nincidentally to illustrate a general proposition, without special\r\nconsideration of their peculiar conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Smith, who has paid a good deal of attention to this\r\nsubject, is inclined to believe that the mimicry in question is\r\nentirely protective. He writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In the United States there are a few rare spiders that mimic ants.\r\nHere at Taperinha we find a good score of species of these spiders\r\naping the various kinds of ants very closely; even the odd, spiny\r\nwood-ant, _cryptocerus_, furnishes a pattern, and there are spiders\r\nthat mimic the wingless ichneumons. We find, after a while, that the\r\nspiders prey upon ants just as our spiders catch flies; indeed, this\r\nfact has already been noted by other observers. But we go a step\r\nbeyond the books when we discover not only that the spiders eat the\r\nants, but that they eat the particular ants which they mimic. At all\r\nevents, we verify this fact in a great number of cases, and we never\r\nfind the spiders eating any but the mimicked species.... I do not like\r\nto hazard a theory on this case of mimicry. It is difficult to suppose\r\nthat the quick-witted ants would be deceived even by so close a\r\nresemblance; and, in any case, it would seem that the spiders do not\r\nrequire such a disguise in order to capture slow-moving ants. Most\r\nbirds will not eat ants; it seems likely, therefore, that this is\r\nsimply another example of protection; the spider deceives its enemies,\r\nnot its prey; it mimics the particular species that it feeds on,\r\nbecause it is seen in that company when it is hunting, and among a\r\nhost of similar forms is likely to pass unnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight, and especially in view of the fact that such cases are\r\nnot uncommon among insects, it would be naturally supposed that the\r\nobject of the mimicry was to enable the spider to approach its victim\r\nwithout exciting suspicion; and it is difficult to account, on any\r\nother supposition, for the very close resemblance between certain\r\nspecies of spiders and the particular species of ants which they prey\r\nupon. It seems as though the highest point of _protective_ benefit\r\nwould have been reached long before the resemblance of the spider to\r\nthe ant had become so close as it really is. On the other hand, it is\r\ndifficult to believe that ants are deceived, even by those spiders\r\nwhich mimic them most closely, when we remember that their perceptions\r\nare so keen that they discriminate not only between ants of their own\r\nand different species, but even between ants of their own species\r\nliving in two different communities.\r\n\r\nThe mimicry of ichneumon flies by spiders was noted some years ago by\r\nMr. Herbert Smith. This case comes under Class 3, in which one species\r\nmimics another which preys upon it. Great destruction is caused by\r\nichneumons which lay their eggs on the bodies of the live spiders,\r\nand the disguise probably protects the spider by leading the fly to\r\nmistake it for one of its own species.\r\n\r\nWe have no proof that spiders ever mimic ants as a method of escaping\r\nfrom them, but it is possible that this sometimes happens. We know\r\nthat some ants prey upon them. The foraging ants of South America\r\ndestroy spiders as well as many kinds of insects, and Wallace mentions\r\na small, wood-boring ant which fills its nest with small spiders.\r\n\r\nIf the spiders that feed upon ants deceive them by their mimicry those\r\nwhich are preyed upon by ants would gain an advantage by a similar\r\ndisguise. I once placed a little ant-like spider of the genus\r\nHerpyllus in a bottle with three ants no larger than itself, which I\r\nhad caught with it in the sweep-net. In a very few minutes the ants\r\nhad killed and begun to devour the spider. It may be that the\r\nresemblance was sufficiently close to deceive them in the open, but\r\nfailed when spider and ants were confined together in close quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATH OF THE BIRDS\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD JEFFERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne morning Sir Bevis went down to the brook. Standing on the brink,\r\nhe said: \"Brook, Brook! what are you singing? You promised to tell me\r\nwhat you were saying.\"\r\n\r\nThe brook did not answer, but went on singing. Bevis listened a\r\nminute, and then he picked a willow leaf and threw it into the bubbles\r\nand watched it go whirling round and round in the eddies and back up\r\nunder the fall, where it dived down and presently came up again, and\r\nthe stream took it and carried it away past the flags. \"Brook, Brook!\"\r\nsaid Bevis, stamping his foot; \"tell me what you are singing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the brook, having now finished that part of his song, said:\r\n\"Bevis, dear; sit down in the shadow of the willow, for it is very hot\r\nto-day, and the reapers are at work; sit down under the willow and I\r\nwill tell you as much as I can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the reed said you could not remember anything,\" said Bevis,\r\nleaning back against the willow.\r\n\r\n\"The reed did not tell you the truth, dear; indeed, he does not know\r\nall; the fact is, the reeds are so fond of talking that I scarcely\r\never answer them now or they would keep on all day long, and I should\r\nnever hear the sound of my own voice, which I like best. So I do not\r\nencourage them, and that is why the reeds think I do not recollect.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that you sing about?\" said Bevis impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"My darling,\" said the brook, \"I do not know myself always what I am\r\nsinging about. I am so happy I sing, sing, and never think about what\r\nit means; it does not matter what you mean as long as you sing.\r\nSometimes I sing about the sun, who loves me dearly, and tries all day\r\nto get at me through the leaves and the green flags that hide me; he\r\nsparkles on me everywhere he can, and does not like me to be in the\r\nshadow. Sometimes I sing to the wind, who loves me next most dearly,\r\nand will come to me everywhere in places where the sun cannot get. He\r\nplays with me whenever he can, and strokes me softly and tells me the\r\nthings he has heard in the woods and on the hills, and sends down the\r\nleaves to float along; for he knows I like something to carry. Fling\r\nme in some leaves, Bevis, dear.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I sing to the earth and the grass; they are fond of me,\r\ntoo, and listen the best of all. I sing loudest at night to the stars;\r\nfor they are so far away they would not otherwise hear me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you say?\" said Bevis; but the brook was too occupied now\r\nto heed him and went on.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I sing to the trees; they, too, are fond of me and come as\r\nnear as they can; they would all come down close to me if they could.\r\nThey love me like the rest, because I am so happy and never cease my\r\nchanting. If I am broken to pieces against a stone, I do not mind in\r\nthe least; I laugh just the same and even louder. When I come over the\r\nhatch, I dash myself to fragments; and sometimes a rainbow comes and\r\nstays a little while with me. The trees drink me, and the grass drinks\r\nme; the birds come down and drink me; they splash me and are happy.\r\nThe fishes swim about, and some of them hide in deep corners. Round\r\nthe bend I go; and the osiers say they never have enough of me. The\r\nlong grass waves and welcomes me; the moor-hens float with me; the\r\nkingfisher is always with me somewhere, and sits on the bough to see\r\nhis ruddy breast in the water. And you come too, Bevis, now and then\r\nto listen to me; and it is all because I am so happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so happy?\" said Bevis.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said the brook. \"Perhaps it is because all I think of\r\nis this minute; I do not know anything about the minute just gone by,\r\nand I do not care one bit about the minute that is just coming; all I\r\ncare about is this minute, this very minute now. Fling me in some more\r\nleaves, Bevis. Why do you go about asking questions, dear? Why don't\r\nyou sing and do nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I want to know all about everything,\" said Bevis. \"Where did\r\nyou come from, and where are you going, and why don't you go on and\r\nlet the ground be dry--why don't you run on, and run all away? why are\r\nyou always here?\"\r\n\r\nThe brook laughed and said: \"My dear, I do not know where I came from,\r\nand I do not care at all where I am going. What does it matter, my\r\nlove? All I know is I shall come back again; yes, I shall come back\r\nagain.\" The brook sang very low and rather sadly now: \"I shall go into\r\nthe sea and shall be lost; and even you would not know me; ask your\r\nfather, love; he has sailed over the sea in ships that come to\r\nSouthampton, and I was close to him, but he did not know me. But by\r\nand by, when I am in the sea, the sun will lift me up, and the clouds\r\nwill float along--look towards the hills, Bevis, dear, every morning\r\nand you will see the clouds coming and bringing me with them; and the\r\nrain and the dew, and sometimes the thunder and the lightning, will\r\nput me down again; and I shall run along here and sing to you, my\r\nsweet, if you will come and listen. Fling in some little twigs, my\r\ndear, and some bits of bark from the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will,\" said Bevis; and he picked up a stone and flung it into\r\nthe water with such a splash that the kingfisher flew away; but the\r\nbrook only laughed and told him to throw another and to make haste and\r\ngrow bigger and jump over him.\r\n\r\n\"S--s, we shall meet by the drinking place,\" said the grasshopper; and\r\nwas just hopping off, when Bevis asked him what the birds went down to\r\nbathe for.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I do not know,\" said the grasshopper, speaking fast, for he\r\nwas rather in a hurry to be gone; he never could stand still long\r\ntogether. \"All I can tell you is, that on Midsummer Day every one of\r\nthe birds has to go down to the brook and walk in and bathe; and it\r\nhas been the law for so many, many years that no one can remember when\r\nit began. They like it very much, because they can show off their\r\nfine feathers which are just now in full color; and if you like to go\r\nwith me, you will be sure to enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis; and he followed the grasshopper, who hopped\r\nso far at every step that he had to walk fast to keep up with him.\r\n\r\nThey went on in silence a good way, except that the grasshopper cried\r\n\"S--s\" to his friends in the grass as he passed, and said good-morning\r\nalso to a mole, who peeped out for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you hop straight?\" said Bevis presently. \"It seems to me\r\nthat you hop first one side and then the other, and go in such a\r\nzigzag fashion it will take us hours to reach the brook.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very stupid you are!\" said the grasshopper. \"If you go straight,\r\nof course you can only see just what is under your feet; but if you go\r\nfirst this way and then that, then you see everything. You are nearly\r\nas silly as the ants, who never see anything beautiful all their\r\nlives. Be sure you have nothing to do with the ants, Bevis; they are a\r\nmean, wretched, miserly set, quite contemptible and beneath notice.\r\nNow, I go everywhere, all round the field, and spend my time searching\r\nfor lovely things; sometimes I find flowers, and sometimes the\r\nbutterflies come down into the grass and tell me the news; and I am so\r\nfond of the sunshine, I sing to it all day long. Tell me, now, is\r\nthere anything so beautiful as the sunshine and the blue sky, and the\r\ngreen grass, and the velvet and blue and spotted butterflies, and the\r\ntrees which cast such a pleasant shadow and talk so sweetly, and the\r\nbrook which is always running? I should like to listen to it for a\r\nthousand years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like you,\" said Bevis; \"jump into my hand and I will carry you.\" He\r\nheld his hand out flat, and in a second up sprang the grasshopper and\r\nalighted on his palm and told him the way to go, and thus they went\r\ntogether merrily.\r\n\r\n\"Bevis, dear, I do not sing at night; but I always go where I can see\r\na star. I slept under a mushroom last night, and he told me he was\r\npushing up as fast as he could before some one came and picked him to\r\nput on a gridiron. I do not lay up any store, because I know I shall\r\ndie when the summer ends; and what is the use of wealth then? My store\r\nand my wealth is the sunshine, dear, and the blue sky, and the green\r\ngrass, and the delicious brook who never ceases sing, sing, singing\r\nall day and night. And all the things are fond of me; the grass and\r\nthe flowers, and the birds and the animals--all of them love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall take you home and put you under a glass case on the\r\nmantelpiece,\" said Bevis.\r\n\r\nOff jumped the grasshopper in a moment, and fell so lightly on the\r\ngrass it did not hurt him in the least, though it was as far as if\r\nBevis had tumbled down out of the clouds. Bevis tried to catch him,\r\nbut he jumped so nimbly this way and that, and hopped to and fro, and\r\nlay down in the grass, that his green coat could not be seen. Bevis\r\nnow went down to the brook and stood on the bank, where it was high,\r\nnear a bush at the side of the drinking place. \"Ah, dear little Sir\r\nBevis!\" whispered a reed, bending towards him as the wind blew,\r\n\"please do not come any nearer; the bank is steep and treacherous, and\r\nhollow underneath where the water-rats run. So do not lean over after\r\nthe forget-me-nots--they are too far for you. Sit down where you are,\r\nbehind that little bush, and I will tell you all about the bathing.\r\nThe birds come down to bathe every Midsummer Day, and the goldfinches,\r\nand the sparrows, and the blackbirds, and the thrushes, and the\r\nswallows, and the wrens, and the robins, and almost every one of them,\r\nexcept two or three, whose great-grandfathers got into disgrace a long\r\nwhile ago. The rooks do not come because they are thieves, and steal\r\nthe mussels, nor the crows, who are a very bad lot; the swan does not\r\ncome either, unless the brook is muddy after a storm. The swan is so\r\ntired of seeing himself in the water that he quite hates it, and that\r\nis the reason he holds his neck so high, that he may not see more of\r\nhimself than he can help.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the birds came. They were all in their very best and brightest\r\nfeathers, and as the sun shone on them and they splashed the water and\r\nstrutted about, Bevis thought he had never seen anything so beautiful.\r\n\r\nThey did not all bathe, for some of them were specially permitted only\r\nto drink instead, but they all came, and all in their newest dresses.\r\nSo bright was the goldfinch's wing, that the lark, though she did not\r\ndare speak, had no doubt she rouged. The sparrow, brushed and neat, so\r\nquiet and subdued in his brown velvet, looked quite aristocratic among\r\nso much flaunting color. As for the blackbird he had carefully washed\r\nhimself in the spring before he came to bathe in the brook, and he\r\nglanced round with a bold and defiant air, as much as to say: \"There\r\nis not one of you who has so yellow a bill, and so beautiful a black\r\ncoat as I have.\" In the bush the bullfinch, who did not care much to\r\nmix with the crowd, moved restlessly to and fro. The robin looked all\r\nthe time at Bevis, so anxious was he for admiration. The wood-pigeon,\r\nvery consequential, affected not to see the dove, whom Bevis longed to\r\nstroke, but could not, as he had promised the reed to keep still.\r\n\r\nBevis looked up into the sky, and there was the hawk, almost up among\r\nthe white clouds, soaring round and round, and watching all that was\r\nproceeding. Almost before he could look down again a shadow went by,\r\nand a cuckoo flew along very low, just over the drinking place.\r\n\r\n\"Cuckoo!\" he cried, \"cuckoo! The goldfinch has the prettiest dress;\"\r\nand off he went.\r\n\r\nNow the hawk had bribed the cuckoo, who was his cousin, to do this,\r\nand the cuckoo was not at all unwilling, for he had an interest\r\nhimself in keeping the birds divided, so he said that although he had\r\nmade up his mind to go on his summer tour, leaving his children to be\r\ntaken care of by the wagtail, he would stop a day or two longer to\r\nmanage this little business. No sooner had the cuckoo said this, than\r\nthere was a most terrible uproar, and all the birds cried out at once.\r\nThe blackbird was so disgusted that he flew straight off, chattering\r\nall across the field and up the hedge. The bullfinch tossed his head,\r\nand asked the goldfinch to come up in the bush and see which was\r\nstronger. The greenfinch and the chaffinch shrieked with derision; the\r\nwood-pigeon turned his back and said \"Pooh!\" and went off with a\r\nclatter. The sparrow flew to tell his mates on the house, and you\r\ncould hear the chatter they made about it right down at the brook.\r\nBut the wren screamed loudest of all, and said that the goldfinch was\r\na painted impostor, and had not got half so much gold as the\r\nyellow-hammer. So they were all scattered in a minute, and Bevis stood\r\nup and hurried homeward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOON\r\n\r\n(FROM WALDEN.)\r\n\r\nBY HENRY D. THOREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free, though secret,\r\nin the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of\r\ntowns, suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to\r\nlive here! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy,\r\nperhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly\r\nsaw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and\r\nprobably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an\r\nhour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch,\r\nand read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a\r\nbrook, oozing from under Brister's Hill, half a mile from my field.\r\nThe approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy\r\nhollows, full of young pitch-pines, into a larger wood about the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nThere, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading\r\nwhite-pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out\r\nthe spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a\r\npailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost\r\nevery day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the\r\nwood-cock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot\r\nabove them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at\r\nlast, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round\r\nme, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken\r\nwings and legs, to attract my attention, and get off her young, who\r\nwould already have taken up their march, with faint wiry peep, single\r\nfile through the swamp, as she directed. Or I heard the peep of the\r\nyoung when I could not see the parent bird.\r\n\r\nThere, too, the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from\r\nbough to bough of the soft white-pines over, my head; or the red\r\nsquirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar\r\nand inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some\r\nattractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit\r\nthemselves to you by turns....\r\n\r\nIn the fall the loon (_Colymbus glacialis_) came, as usual, to moult\r\nand bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter\r\nbefore I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen\r\nare on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three,\r\nwith patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come\r\nrustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one\r\nloon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that,\r\nfor the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come\r\nup there.\r\n\r\nBut now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling\r\nthe surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though\r\nhis foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound\r\nwith their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash angrily,\r\ntaking sides with all waterfowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat\r\nto town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often\r\nsuccessful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I\r\nfrequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few\r\nrods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how\r\nhe would manoeuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did\r\nnot discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day.\r\nBut I was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went\r\noff in a rain.\r\n\r\nAs I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October\r\nafternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like\r\nthe milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon,\r\nsuddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods\r\nin front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued\r\nwith a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than\r\nbefore. He dived again but I miscalculated the direction he would\r\ntake, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this\r\ntime, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed\r\nlong and loud, and with more reason than before.\r\n\r\nHe manoeuvred so cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen\r\nrods of him. Each time when he came to the surface, turning his head\r\nthis way and that, he coolly surveyed the water and the land, and\r\napparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was\r\nthe widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the\r\nboat. It was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his\r\nresolve into execution. He led me at once to the wildest part of the\r\npond, and could not be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing\r\nin his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was\r\na pretty game, played on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against\r\na loon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and\r\nthe problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again.\r\nSometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me,\r\nhaving apparently passed directly under the boat. So long-winded was\r\nhe and so unweariable, that when he had swam farthest he would\r\nimmediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine\r\nwhere in the deep pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be\r\nspeeding his way like a fish, for he had time and ability to visit the\r\nbottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is said that loons have\r\nbeen caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface,\r\nwith hooks set for trout,--though Walden is deeper than that. How\r\nsurprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another\r\nsphere speeding his way amid their schools!\r\n\r\nYet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the\r\nsurface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple\r\nwhere he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,\r\nand instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest\r\non my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where\r\nhe would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over\r\nthe surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly\r\nlaugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he\r\ninvariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?\r\nDid not his white breast enough betray him?\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a silly loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the plash\r\nof the water when he came up, and so also detected him. But after an\r\nhour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as willingly and swam yet\r\nfarther than at first. It was surprising to see how serenely he sailed\r\noff with unruffled breast when he came to the surface, doing all the\r\nwork with his webbed feet beneath. His usual note was this demoniac\r\nlaughter, yet somewhat like that of a waterfowl; but occasionally when\r\nhe had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he\r\nuttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf\r\nthan any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and\r\ndeliberately howls. This was his looning,--perhaps the wildest sound\r\nthat is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I\r\nconcluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his\r\nown resources.\r\n\r\nThough the sky was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that\r\nI could see where he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His\r\nwhite breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the\r\nwater were all against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off,\r\nhe uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of\r\nloons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from the east and\r\nrippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I\r\nwas impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his\r\ngod was angry with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the\r\ntumultuous surface.\r\n\r\nFor hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer\r\nand hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which\r\nthey will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When\r\ncompelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over\r\nthe pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to\r\nother ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I\r\nthought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down\r\nby a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which\r\nwas left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the\r\nmiddle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the\r\nsame reason that I do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARTMOOR PONIES, OR THE WANDERINGS OF THE HORSE TRIBE\r\n\r\n(FROM \"THROUGH MAGIC GLASSES.\")\r\n\r\nBY ARABELLA B. BUCKLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI want you to take a journey with me which I took in imagination a few\r\ndays ago, as I lay on my back on the sunny moor and watched the\r\nDartmoor ponies.\r\n\r\nIt was a calm misty morning one day last week, giving promise of a\r\nbright and sunny day, when I started off for a long walk across the\r\nmoor to visit the famous stone-circles, many of which are to be found\r\nnot far off the track, called Abbot's Way, leading from Buckfast\r\nAbbey, on the Dart, to the Abbey of Tavistock, on the Tavy.\r\n\r\nMy mind was full of the olden times as I pictured to myself how, seven\r\nhundred years or more ago, some Benedictine monk from Tavistock Abbey,\r\nin his black robe and cowl, paced this narrow path on his way to his\r\nCistercian brethren at Buckfast, meeting some of them on his road as\r\nthey wandered over the desolate moor in their white robes and black\r\nscapularies in search of stray sheep. For the Cistercians were\r\nshepherds and wool-weavers, while the Benedictines devoted themselves\r\nto learning, and the track of about twenty-five miles from one abbey\r\nto the other, which still remains, was worn by the members of the two\r\ncommunities and their dependents, the only variety in whose lives\r\nconsisted probably in these occasional visits one to the other.\r\n\r\nYet even these monks belonged to modern times compared to the ancient\r\nBritons who raised the stone-circles, and buried their dead in the\r\nbarrows scattered here and there over the moor; and my mind drifted\r\nback to the days when, long before that pathway was worn, men clad in\r\nthe skins of beasts hunted wild animals over the ground on which I was\r\ntreading, and lived in caves and holes of the ground.\r\n\r\nI wondered, as I thought of them, whether the cultured monks and the\r\nuncivilized Britons delighted as much in the rugged scenery of the\r\nmoor as I did that morning. For many miles in front of me the moor\r\nstretched out wild and treeless; the sun was shining brightly upon the\r\nmass of yellow furze and deep-red heather, drawing up the moisture\r\nfrom the ground, and causing a kind of watery haze to shimmer over the\r\nlandscape; while the early mist was rising off the _tors_, or\r\nhill-tops, in the distance, curling in fanciful wreaths around the\r\nrugged and stony summits, as it dispersed gradually in the increasing\r\nheat of the day.\r\n\r\nThe cattle which were scattered in groups here and there feeding on\r\nthe dewy grass were enjoying the happiest time of the year. The moor,\r\nwhich in winter affords them scarcely a bare subsistence, is now\r\nrichly covered with fresh young grass, and the sturdy oxen fed\r\nsolemnly and deliberately, while the wild Dartmoor ponies and their\r\ncolts scampered joyously along, shaking their manes and long flowing\r\ntails, and neighing to each other as they went; or clustered together\r\non some verdant spot, where the colts teased and bit each other for\r\nfun, as they gambolled round their mothers.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure, there on the open moor, with the lark soaring\r\noverhead, and the butterflies and bees hovering among the\r\nsweet-smelling furze blossoms, to see horses free and joyous, with no\r\nthought of bit or bridle, harness or saddle, whose hoofs had never\r\nbeen handled by the shoeing-smith, nor their coats touched with the\r\nsingeing iron. Those little colts, with their thick heads, shaggy\r\ncoats, and flowing tails, will have at least two years more freedom\r\nbefore they know what it is to be driven or beaten. Only once a year\r\nare they gathered together, claimed by their owners and branded with\r\nan initial, and then left again to wander where they will. True, it is\r\na freedom which sometimes has its drawbacks, for if the winter is\r\nsevere the only food they can get will be the furze-tops, off which\r\nthey scrape the snow with their feet; yet it is very precious in\r\nitself, for they can gallop when and where they choose, with head\r\nerect, sniffing at the wind and crying to each other for the very joy\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nNow as I strolled across the moor and watched their gambols, thinking\r\nhow like free wild animals they seemed, my thoughts roamed far away,\r\nand I saw in imagination scenes where other untamed animals of the\r\nhorse tribe are living unfettered all their lives long.\r\n\r\nFirst there rose before my mind the level grass-covered pampas of\r\nSouth America, where wild horses share the boundless plains with\r\ntroops of the rhea, or American ostrich, and wander, each horse with\r\nas many mares as he can collect, in companies of hundreds or even\r\nthousands in a troop. These horses are now truly wild, and live freely\r\nfrom youth to age, unless they are unfortunate enough to be caught in\r\nthe more inhabited regions by the lasso of the hunter. In the broad\r\npampas, the home of herds of wild cattle, they dread nothing. There,\r\nas they roam with one bold stallion as their leader, even beasts of\r\nprey hesitate to approach them, for, when they form into a dense mass\r\nwith the mothers and young in their centre, their heels deal blows\r\nwhich even the fierce jaguar does not care to encounter, and they\r\ntrample their enemy to death in a very short time. Yet these are not\r\nthe original wild horses we are seeking, they are the descendants of\r\ntame animals, brought from Europe by the Spaniards to Buenos Ayres in\r\n1535, whose descendants have regained their freedom on the boundless\r\npampas and prairies.\r\n\r\nAs I was picturing them careering over the plains, another scene\r\npresented itself and took their place. Now I no longer saw around me\r\ntall pampas-grass with the long necks of the rheas appearing above it,\r\nfor I was on the edge of a dreary, scantily covered plain between the\r\nAral Sea and the Balkash Lake in Tartary. To the south lies a barren\r\nsandy desert, to the north the fertile plains of the Kirghiz steppes,\r\nwhere the Tartar feeds his flocks, and herds of antelopes gallop over\r\nthe fresh green pasture; and between these is a kind of no-man's\r\nland, where low scanty shrubs and stunted grass seem to promise but a\r\npoor feeding-ground.\r\n\r\nYet here the small long-legged but powerful \"Tarpans,\" the wild horses\r\nof the treeless plains of Russia and Tartary, were picking their\r\nmorning meal. Sturdy wicked little fellows they are, with their shaggy\r\nlight-brown coats, short wiry manes, erect ears, and fiery watchful\r\neyes. They might well be supposed to be true wild horses, whose\r\nancestors had never been tamed by man; and yet it is more probable\r\nthat even they escaped in early times from the Tartars, and have held\r\ntheir own ever since, over the grassy steppes of Russia and on the\r\nconfines of the plains of Tartary. Sometimes they live almost alone,\r\nespecially on the barren wastes where they have been seen in winter,\r\nscraping the snow off the herbage as our ponies do on Dartmoor. At\r\nother times, as in the south of Russia, where they wander between the\r\nDnieper and the Don, they gather in vast herds and live a free life,\r\nnot fearing even the wolves, which they beat to the ground with their\r\nhoofs. From one green oasis to another they travel over miles of\r\nground.\r\n\r\n   \"A thousand horse--and none to ride!\r\n    With flowing tail, and flying mane,\r\n    Wide nostrils--never stretched by pain,\r\n    Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,\r\n    And feet that iron never shod,\r\n    And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,\r\n    A thousand horse, the wild, the free,\r\n    Like waves that follow o'er the sea.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Byron's _Mazeppa_.\r\n\r\nAs I followed them in their course I fancied I saw troops of yet\r\nanother animal of the horse tribe, the \"Kulan,\" or _Equus hemionus_,\r\nwhich is a kind of half horse, half ass (p. 393), living on the\r\nKirghiz steppes of Tartary and spreading far beyond the range of the\r\nTarpan into Tibet. Here at last we have a truly wild animal, never\r\nprobably brought into subjection by man. The number of names he\r\npossesses shows how widely he has spread. The Tartars call him\r\n\"Kulan,\" the Tibetans \"Kiang,\" while the Mongolians give him the\r\nunpronounceable name of \"Dschiggetai.\" He will not submit to any of\r\nthem, but if caught and confined soon breaks away again to his old\r\nlife, a \"free and fetterless creature.\"\r\n\r\nNo one has ever yet settled the question whether he is a horse or an\r\nass, probably because he represents an animal truly between the two.\r\nHis head is graceful, his body light, his legs slender and fleet, yet\r\nhis ears are long and ass-like; he has narrow hoofs, and a tail with a\r\ntuft at the end like all the ass tribe; his color is a yellow brown,\r\nand he has a short dark mane and a long dark stripe down his back as a\r\ndonkey has, though this last character you may also see in many of our\r\nDevonshire ponies. Living often on the high plateaux, sometimes as\r\nmuch as fifteen hundred feet above the sea, this \"child of the\r\nsteppes\" travels in large companies even as far as the rich meadows of\r\nCentral Asia; in summer wandering in green pastures, and in winter\r\nseeking the hunger-steppes where sturdy plants grow. And when autumn\r\ncomes the young steeds go off alone to the mountain heights to survey\r\nthe country around and call wildly for mates, whom, when found, they\r\nwill keep close to them through all the next year, even though they\r\nmingle with thousands of others.\r\n\r\nTill about ten years ago the _Equus hemionus_ was the only truly wild\r\nhorse known, but in the winter of 1879-80 the Russian traveller\r\nPrzevalsky brought back from Central Asia a much more horse-like\r\nanimal, called by the Tartars \"Kertag\" and by the Mongols \"Statur.\" It\r\nis a clumsy, thick-set, whitish-gray creature with strong legs and a\r\nlarge, heavy, reddish-colored head; its legs have a red tint down to\r\nthe knees, beyond which they are blackish down to the hoofs. But the\r\nears are small, and it has the broad hoofs of the true horse, and\r\nwarts on his hind legs, which no animal of the ass tribe has. This\r\nhorse, like the Kiang, travels in small troops of from five to\r\nfifteen, led through the wildest parts of the Dsungarian desert,\r\nbetween the Altai and Tianschan Mountains, by an old stallion. They\r\nare extremely shy, and see, hear, and smell very quickly, so that they\r\nare off like lightning whenever anything approaches them.\r\n\r\nSo having travelled over America, Europe, and Asia, was my quest\r\nended? No; for from the dreary Asiatic deserts my thoughts wandered to\r\na far warmer and more fertile land, where between the Blue Nile and\r\nthe Red Sea rise the lofty highlands of Abyssinia, among which the\r\nAfrican wild ass (_Asinus taeniopus_), the probable ancestor of our\r\ndonkeys, feeds in troops on the rich grasses of the slopes, and then\r\nonwards to the bank of a river in Central Africa where on the edge of\r\na forest, with rich pastures beyond, elephants and rhinoceroses,\r\nantelopes and buffaloes, lions and hyaenas, creep down in the cool of\r\nthe evening to slake their thirst in the flowing stream. There I saw\r\nthe herds of Zebras in all their striped beauty coming down from the\r\nmountain regions to the north, and mingling with the darker-colored\r\nbut graceful quaggas from the southern plains, and I half-grieved at\r\nthe thought how these untamed and free rovers are being slowly but\r\nsurely surrounded by man closing in upon them on every side.\r\n\r\nI might now have travelled still farther in search of the Onager, or\r\nwild ass of the Asiatic and Indian deserts, but at this point a more\r\ninteresting and far wider question presented itself, as I flung myself\r\ndown on the moor to ponder over the early history of all these tribes.\r\n\r\nWhere have they all come from? Where shall we look for the first\r\nancestors of these wild and graceful animals? For the answer to this\r\nquestion I had to travel back to America, to those Western United\r\nStates where Professor Marsh has made such grand discoveries in horse\r\nhistory. For there, in the very country where horses were supposed\r\nnever to have been before the Spaniards brought them a few centuries\r\nago, we have now found the true birthplace of the equine race.\r\n\r\nCome back with me to a time so remote that we cannot measure it even\r\nby hundred of thousands of years, and let us visit the territories of\r\nUtah and Wyoming. Those highlands were very different then from what\r\nthey are now. Just risen out of the seas of the Cretaceous Period,\r\nthey were then clothed with dense forests of palms, tree-ferns, and\r\nscrew-pines, magnolias and laurels, interspersed with wide-spreading\r\nlakes, on the margins of which strange and curious animals fed and\r\nflourished. There were large beasts with teeth like the tapir and the\r\nbear, and feet like the elephant; and others far more dangerous, half\r\nbear, half hyaena, prowling around to attack the clumsy paleotherium or\r\nthe anoplotherium, something between a rhinoceros and a horse, which\r\ngrazed by the waterside, while graceful antelopes fed on the rich\r\ngrass. And among these were some little animals no bigger than foxes,\r\nwith four toes and a splint for the fifth, on their front feet, and\r\nthree toes on the hind ones.\r\n\r\nThese clumsy little animals, whose bones have been found in the rocks\r\nof Utah and Wyoming, have been called _Eohippus_, or horses of the\r\ndawn, by naturalists. They were animals with real toes, yet their\r\nbones and teeth show that they belonged to the horse tribe, and\r\nalready the fifth toe common to most other toed animals was beginning\r\nto disappear.\r\n\r\nThis was in the Eocene Period, and before it passed away with its\r\nscrew-pines and tree-ferns, another rather larger animal, called the\r\nOrohippus, had taken the place of the small one, and he had only four\r\ntoes on his front feet. The splint had disappeared, and as time went\r\non still other animals followed, always with fewer toes, while they\r\ngained slender fleet legs, together with an increase in size and in\r\ngracefulness. First one as large as a sheep (Mesohippus) had only\r\nthree toes and a splint. Then the splint again disappeared, and one\r\nlarge and two dwindling toes only remained, till finally these two\r\nbecame mere splints, leaving one large toe or hoof with almost\r\nimperceptible splints, which may be seen on the fetlock of a horse's\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\nYou must notice that a horse's foot really begins at the point which\r\nwe call his knee in the front legs, and at his hock in his hind legs.\r\nHis true knee and elbow are close up to the body. What we call his\r\nfoot or hoof is really the end of the strong, broad, middle toe\r\ncovered with a hoof, and farther up his foot we can feel two small\r\nsplints, which are remains of two other toes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF HORSE OR ASS.\r\n    i, Incisor teeth. g, Grinding teeth, with the gap between the two\r\n    as in all grass-feeders. k, Knee. h, Hock or heel. f, Foot. s,\r\n    Splints or remains of the two lost toes. e, Elbow. w, Wrist. h,\r\n    Hand-bone. t, Middle toe of three joints, 1, 2, 3 forming the\r\n    hoof.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile during these long succeeding ages while the foot was\r\nlengthening out into a slender limb the animals became larger, more\r\npowerful, and more swift, the neck and head became longer and more\r\ngraceful, the brain-case larger in front and the teeth decreased in\r\nnumber, so that there is now a large gap between the biting teeth and\r\nthe grinding teeth of a horse. Their slender limbs too became more\r\nflexible and fit for running and galloping, till we find the whole\r\nskeleton the same in shape, though not in size, as in our own horses\r\nand asses now.\r\n\r\nThey did not, however, during all this time remain confined to\r\nAmerica, for, from the time when they arrived at an animal called\r\n_Miohippus_, or lesser horse, which came after the Mesohippus and had\r\nonly three toes on each foot, we find their remains in Europe, where\r\nthey lived in company with the giraffes, opossums, and monkeys which\r\nroamed over these parts in those ancient times. Then a little later we\r\nfind them in Africa and India; so that the horse tribe, represented by\r\ncreatures about as large as donkeys, had spread far and wide over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd now, curiously enough, they began to forsake, or to die out in,\r\nthe land of their birth. Why they did so we do not know; but while in\r\nthe old world as asses, quaggas, and zebras, and probably horses, they\r\nflourished in Asia, Europe, and Africa, they certainly died out in\r\nAmerica, so that ages afterwards, when that land was discovered, no\r\nanimal of the horse tribe was found in it.\r\n\r\nAnd the true horse, where did he arise? Born and bred probably in\r\nCentral Asia from some animal like the \"Kulan,\" or the \"Kertag,\" he\r\nproved too useful to savage tribes to be allowed his freedom, and it\r\nis doubtful whether in any part of the world he escaped subjection. In\r\nour own country he probably roamed as a wild animal till the savages,\r\nwho fed upon him, learned in time to put him to work; and when the\r\nRomans came they found the Britons with fine and well-trained horses.\r\n\r\nYet though tamed and made to know his master, he has, as we have seen,\r\nbroken loose again in almost all parts of the world--in American on\r\nthe prairies and pampas, in Europe and Asia on the steppes, and in\r\nAustralia in the bush. And even in Great Britain, where so few patches\r\nof uncultivated land still remain, the young colts of Dartmoor,\r\nExmoor, and Shetland, though born of domesticated mothers, seems to\r\nassert their descent from wild and free ancestors as they throw out\r\ntheir heels and toss up their heads with a shrill neigh, and fly\r\nagainst the wind with streaming manes and outstretched tails as the\r\nKulan, the Tarpan, and the Zebra do in the wild desert or grassy\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEN, GRANT, English scientist and man of letters; born\r\n1848, died 1899.
