Built on the Clyde twenty years back, this\r\nPeruvian-owned tramp was no longer in her prime.  Since passing out of\r\nthe hands of her British owners, neglect had lessened her speed, while\r\nthe addition of various deck-houses, to suit the requirements of the\r\nSouth American firm under whose house-flag she sailed, had not\r\nincreased her steadiness.\r\n\r\nCaptain Antonio Perez, who was in command, was a short, thick-set man\r\nof almost pure Spanish descent, swarthy, greasy, and vain--combining\r\nall the characteristics, good, bad, and indifferent, of the South\r\nAmerican skipper.  As part owner of the _San Martin_ he was glad of the\r\nopportunity of adding to the vessel's earnings, so he had willingly\r\nagreed to take five passengers as far as Tahiti.\r\n\r\nThe five passengers were Mr. McKay, his son Andrew, Terence Donaghue,\r\nFanshaw Ellerton, and Quexo; but before relating the circumstances in\r\nwhich they found themselves on board the _San Martin_, it will be\r\nnecessary to introduce them to our readers.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, a tall, erect Queenslander, of Scottish descent, had,\r\nthrough the death of a near relative, migrated from Australia to one of\r\nthe Central American republics in order to test the possibilities of an\r\nestate which had been left him, before putting it into the market.\r\n\r\nAndrew McKay, or Andy, as he was called, was a well-set-up young fellow\r\nof nineteen, broad-shouldered and straight-limbed, with a fine head\r\nsurmounted by a crop of auburn hair.\r\n\r\nTerence Donaghue, the son of an Irish Canadian, was about Andy's age,\r\nand was on a visit to the McKays.  He was impulsive both in manner and\r\nspeech, high-spirited, and good-natured.\r\n\r\nFanshaw Ellerton, a lad of sixteen, was supposed to be serving his\r\napprenticeship on board the _Tophet_, a barque of 2200 tons, of the\r\nport of Liverpool.  He was in reality a deserter--but in circumstances\r\nbeyond his control.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of general leave being granted to the crew of the\r\n_Tophet_, Ellerton had gone \"up-country,\" and, before he actually\r\nrealised it, he found himself besieged in Mr. McKay's ranch of San\r\nEugenio.\r\n\r\nOne of those revolutions that occur in many of the South Central\r\nAmerican states had broken out, and the rebels, thinking that Mr.\r\nMcKay's house and estate would prove an easy and profitable prize,\r\npromptly attempted to take and plunder San Eugenio.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a vigorous defence, it seemed as if numbers would gain the\r\nday, till Quexo, a mulatto lad on the ranch, contrived to steal through\r\nthe rebels' lines and bring timely aid, but not before Mr. McKay had\r\nbeen severely wounded.\r\n\r\nBut, so far as his Central American affairs were concerned, Mr. McKay\r\nwas practically ruined, and he took steps to return to Queensland with\r\nthe least possible delay.\r\n\r\nAndy, of course, was to accompany him, while Terence arranged to go as\r\nfar as Tahiti, whence he could take steamer to Honolulu and on to\r\nVictoria, British Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, old chap,\" exclaimed Andy, when Ellerton made the\r\nstartling yet not altogether unexpected discovery that the _Tophet_ had\r\nsailed without him.  \"We've stuck together through thick and thin these\r\nlast few days, and it seems as if we have been chums for years.  I know\r\nthe governor will be only too glad to have you with us, and no doubt\r\nyou can pick up your ship at Sydney.\"\r\n\r\nNor did Mr. McKay forget Quexo's devotion; and, to the mulatto's great\r\ndelight, he was engaged as servant at the--to him--princely salary of\r\nfive dollars a month.\r\n\r\nA fever-stricken coast was no place for a wounded man, hence Mr.\r\nMcKay's anxiety to sail as soon as possible; and since ten days or more\r\nwould elapse before one of the regular line of steamers left for\r\nHonolulu, passages were booked on the Peruvian tramp steamer _San\r\nMartin_.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"What a scratch crew!\" remarked Terence, pointing at the swarm of\r\nolive-featured Peruvians who were scrubbing down decks with the aid of\r\nthe ship's hose.\r\n\r\n\"But even they have one advantage over most of the crews of the\r\nmercantile marine,\" replied Ellerton.  \"They are all of one\r\nnationality.  Take the _Tophet's_ crew--there are only eight British\r\nseamen before the mast; the rest are Germans, Finns, and Swedes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a crying scandal,\" interrupted Mr. McKay, who was resting in a\r\ndeck-chair a few feet from the head of the poop-ladder.  \"England, the\r\nprincipal carrier of the world, has to rely upon foreigners to man her\r\nmerchant ships.  And the reason is not far to seek,\" he added.\r\n\r\nThe _San Martin_ was in the Doldrums.  Not a ripple disturbed the\r\nsurface of the ocean, save the white wake of the steamer as she pounded\r\nalong at a steady nine knots.  Overhead the sun shone fiercely in a\r\ncloudless sky.\r\n\r\n\"How deep is it here?\" asked Terence, leaning over the rail.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Ellerton?\" asked Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I had no opportunity of examining a chart.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's approximately three thousand fathoms.  Between the Galapagos and\r\nthe Marquesas is a vast sunken plateau.  Sunlight never penetrates\r\nthese great depths; probably all is dark beyond two hundred fathoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are there fish or marine animals in the bed of the ocean?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows.  Possibly there are some marine animals capable of\r\nwithstanding the enormous pressure, for it may be taken for granted\r\nthat at three thousand fathoms the pressure per square inch is about\r\nthree tons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it always calm in the Doldrums?\" continued Terence, for he had\r\nnever before \"crossed the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Often for weeks at a stretch.  What's your experience of these,\r\nEllerton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks with the canvas hanging straight down from the yards.  If\r\nyou threw anything overboard it would be alongside for days.  I can\r\nassure you, Terence, that I am jolly glad we're on board a steamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get out of it?\" continued the young Canadian, eager for\r\nfurther information.\r\n\r\n\"By one of the frequent and sudden hurricanes that spring up in the\r\nbelt of the calms; but even that was looked upon as a slice of luck.\"\r\n\r\nThus the days passed.  Conversation was the chief means of passing the\r\ntime, although the lads derived considerable amusement from their\r\nefforts to teach Quexo English.\r\n\r\nReading was out of the question, for the ship's library consisted of\r\nonly a few Spanish books of little interest to Mr. McKay and Andy,\r\nwhile to Terence and Ellerton they were unfathomable.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fourth day there was an ominous change in the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe sun, setting between high-banked, ill-defined clouds, gave out\r\nbright copper-coloured rays that betokened much wind at no distant\r\ndate; while from the south-east a long, heavy swell, although far from\r\nland, gave further indications of change.\r\n\r\n\"How is the glass, Captain?\" asked Mr. McKay, as Captain Perez emerged\r\nfrom the companion and began to make his way for'ard to the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Low, senor.  I like it not.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an admission,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, as the officer mounted the\r\nladder.  \"Fancy a British skipper replying like that!  Here, Andy, you\r\nare not shaky on the pins like I am; just present my compliments to\r\nCaptain Perez and ask him to tell you how the barometer stands.  I'm\r\nrather curious on that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to have a good knowledge of seamanship, sir,\" remarked\r\nEllerton, as young McKay made his way to the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must confess I have,\" admitted Mr. McKay.  \"Years ago I spent\r\nsome months on a pearl-fisher in Torres Strait; but that's a long\r\nstory.  Some day, perhaps, I'll tell you more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven hundred and forty millimetres--a fall of twenty-two millimetres\r\nin eight hours,\" announced Andy, reading the figures from a slip of\r\npaper, on which he had noted the captain's reply.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.  \"That's equivalent to a trifle over\r\n29.1 inches.  We're in for something, especially with that deck cargo,\"\r\nas he pointed to the towering baulks of mahogany which were stowed\r\namidships.\r\n\r\n\"Are they doing anything for'ard?\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"The men are placing additional lashings over the hatchways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity they didn't man the derrick and heave some of that stuff\r\noverboard,\" replied Mr. McKay, eyeing the timber with concern.\r\n\"However, it will be dark in another quarter of an hour, so we had\r\nbetter turn in and get some sleep while we are able.\"\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after midnight when Ellerton awoke, conscious that\r\nsomething was amiss.  He had slept through severe gales in the old\r\n_Tophet_ when she was scudding under close-reefed canvas before the\r\nwind or lying hove-to in a hurricane in Magellan Straits; but there was\r\nsomething in the peculiar motion of the _San Martin_ that roused his\r\nseaman's instincts.\r\n\r\nIt was blowing.  He could hear the nerve-racking clank of the engines\r\nas the propeller raced in the air, and the corresponding jar as the\r\nship's stern was engulfed in the following seas.  That was a mere\r\nnothing; it was the excessive heel and slow recovery of the vessel\r\nwhich told him that things were not as they should be.\r\n\r\nHastily dressing, he was about to leave the cabin when a hollow groan\r\ncaught his ear.  It was pitch dark, for the electric lights had failed,\r\nand the after part of the ship was in a state of absolute blackness.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Terence?\"\r\n\r\nTerence was like the sufferer on the Channel mail boat.  He was past\r\nthe stage when he was afraid he might die, and was entering into the\r\nstage when he was afraid he might not.  Ellerton had suffered the\r\nagonies of sea-sickness before, so, knowing that the unhappy victim\r\nwould prefer to suffer in solitude, he went outside.\r\n\r\nIn the alley-way he collided with the second mate, who, clad in\r\ndripping oilskins, was returning from his watch on deck.\r\n\r\nEre the two could disengage, a heavy list sent them both rolling\r\nagainst one of the starboard cabins, and, at the same time, Andy, who,\r\nunable to sleep, was on the point of making his way over to Ellerton's\r\nberth, stepped upon the writhing forms and promptly joined them on the\r\nfloor of the alley-way.\r\n\r\nA number of choice expressions in English and Spanish, drowned by the\r\nthunder of the \"combers\" on deck, arose from the struggling trio, till\r\nat length Ellerton disentangled himself and succeeded in pulling his\r\nchum from under the form of the second mate.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it awful, this gale?\" gasped Andy, whose right eye was rapidly\r\nclosing from the effects of an accidental knock from the Peruvian's\r\nsea-boot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a bit thick,\" replied Ellerton, whose knuckles were bleeding\r\nthrough coming into contact with the brass tread of the cabin door.\r\n\"But let's follow this chap up and get him to let us have a candle;\r\nthen we can see what we are doing.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a vivid flash of lightning revealed the Peruvian, still in\r\nhis wet oilskins, stretched at full length on his bunk, his head buried\r\nin the blankets.  He was in a state of absolute funk!\r\n\r\nA swinging candlestick was affixed to the bulkhead, and Ellerton was\r\nsoon able to procure a light.  Andy glanced at the barometer.  The\r\nmercury stood at 715 millimetres (28.15 in.)--a fall of nearly an inch\r\nsince six o'clock on the previous evening.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we go on deck?\" asked Andy, as the _San Martin_ slowly recovered\r\nfrom a dangerous list.  \"It's rotten being cooped up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would stand a jolly good chance of being swept overboard,\" replied\r\nEllerton.  \"Everything is battened down, and we can only get out by the\r\nsliding hatch communicating with the----\"\r\n\r\nHis words were interrupted by a succession of heavy thuds, plainly\r\naudible above the roar of the wind and waves, while the shouts of the\r\nfrantic seamen showed that something had broken adrift.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the lift of the vessel as she threw her stern clear\r\nof a mountainous sea, Ellerton opened the steel sliding doorway\r\nsufficiently wide for the two chums to gain the poop.  Staggering along\r\nthe slippery, heaving deck, they reached the lee side of the\r\ndeck-house, where, gripping the stout iron stanchion-rail, they awaited\r\nthe next flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait.  A brilliant, prolonged succession of\r\nflashes dazzled their eyes, the electric fluid playing on the wet\r\nplanks and foam-swept waist of the plunging vessel.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the commotion was now apparent.  One of the mainmast\r\nderricks had broken adrift, and, charging from side to side like a\r\ngigantic flail, had smashed the rail, crushed two steel\r\nventilator-cowls, and utterly demolished two boats in the davits.\r\n\r\nThe crew, trying to secure the plunging mass of metal, were working\r\nwith mad desperation, frequently up to their waists in water.\r\n\r\nTwo of the unfortunate men, crushed by the sweep of the derrick, had\r\nbeen hurled over the side, while another, his leg bent under him, lay\r\nhelpless in the lee-scuppers, with only a few inches of broken bulwarks\r\nto prevent him from sharing the fate of his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by, Andy!\" shouted Ellerton.  \"Take a couple of turns round this\r\nbollard,\" and throwing the end of a coil of signal-halliards to his\r\nfriend, he made the other end fast round his waist and jumped down the\r\npoop-ladder.\r\n\r\nHe was only just in time.  Another dazzling flash enabled him to see\r\nthe helpless form of the crippled seaman, and as he wound his arms\r\nround the man's waist in an iron grip, a seething cataract of foam\r\nswept the deck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELLERTON WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME.  ANOTHER DAZZLING FLASH\r\nENABLED HIM TO SEE THE HELPLESS FORM OF THE CRIPPLED SEAMAN]\r\n\r\nThe ship, stunned by the force of the gigantic billow, listed till her\r\ndeck took an angle of 45 degrees, or more.  To the young apprentice,\r\nheld only by a single turn of the thin signal-halliard, it seemed as if\r\nthe ship were already taking her downward plunge, for all round him\r\nsurged the torrent of solid water, his position rendered doubly\r\nhorrible by the intense blackness of the night.\r\n\r\nStill he held on like grim death to the disabled seaman, the thin rope\r\ncutting into his breastbone like a steel wire.  His feet were unable to\r\nfind a hold; the last fragment of the bulwarks had vanished, and only\r\nthe rope held him and his burden from a prolonged death in the surging\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nQuivering like an aspen leaf, the stricken vessel slowly resumed an\r\neven keel, and then began the correspondingly sickening list to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\nAnother flash revealed the charging derrick whirling over his head;\r\nthen, as he felt the rope slacken and himself slipping across the deck,\r\nhis hand managed to grasp the foot of the poop-ladder.\r\n\r\nAlmost breathless by his exertions, and half suffocated through being\r\nso long under water, Ellerton retained sufficient presence of mind to\r\nclamber up the ladder, Andy assisting his burden by steadily and\r\nstrongly hauling on the rope; then, as the _San Martin_ once more began\r\nher sickening roll to leeward, he sank exhausted to the deck, safe\r\nunder the lee of the deck-house, with the Peruvian still in his grip.\r\n\r\nThat last tremendous breaker had been the means of saving the ship,\r\nthough at the time it had threatened to end her career.  The dangerous\r\ndeck-load of mahogany baulks had been wrenched from its securing\r\nlashings, and had been swept overboard; while the disabled derrick,\r\ncoming into contact with the donkey-engine, had snapped off short.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the waves had swept four more of the crew to their\r\nlast account, and the remainder, exhausted and disheartened by their\r\nmisfortunes, had gained the shelter of the fo'c'sle.\r\n\r\nSecuring themselves by the rope, Andy and Ellerton--the latter having\r\npassed a bight round the now conscious and groaning seaman--hung on\r\nwith desperation.\r\n\r\nFrom their comparatively sheltered position they could gain occasional\r\nglimpses of the bridge, where Captain Perez, the first mate, and a\r\ncouple of seamen stood braving the elements, their sou'-westers just\r\nvisible above the top of the canvas storm-dodgers.\r\n\r\nAt one moment, silhouetted against the glare of the lightning, their\r\nheads could be seen against a background of wind-torn clouds; at\r\nanother the vessel would be so deep in the trough of the waves that the\r\ncrests ahead appeared to rise high above the rigid figures on their\r\nlofty, swaying perch.\r\n\r\n\"Will it hold?\" shouted Andy above the hiss of the foam and the howling\r\nof the wind, as a few tons of water struck the weather side of the\r\ndeck-house.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied Ellerton.  \"It would have gone before this if\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's put the man inside.  We can then go below and get the\r\nsteward or some of the crew to look after him.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they dragged the groaning seaman into the deck-house, and,\r\nwedging him up with cushions to prevent him from playing the part of\r\nNeptune's shuttlecock, they left him.\r\n\r\nSeizing their opportunity, the two friends contrived to gain the\r\nsaloon, where they found Mr. McKay, who had succeeded in procuring and\r\nlighting a pair of cabin-lamps.\r\n\r\n\"Thick, isn't it?\" remarked Andy's father.  Then: \"What have you\r\nfellows been up to?\" for both were wet to the skin, while Andy's eye\r\nwas black and green, and Ellerton's forehead was bleeding from a\r\nsuperficial cut.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" replied Ellerton modestly.  \"We were caught in the\r\ntail end of a comber.  The deck cargo's gone, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good news,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Though I fancy the worst is\r\nyet to come.  I suppose Captain Perez is steering to the south'ard to\r\ntry and avoid the main path of the hurricane?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had the chance of looking at the compass,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\"But I must go for'ard and get help for the poor fellow in the\r\ndeck-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fellow is that?\" asked Mr. McKay of his son as the apprentice\r\ndisappeared along the darkened alley-way.\r\n\r\nWhile Andy was relating with whole-hearted praise the story of his\r\ncompanion's bravery, Ellerton was feeling his way along the narrow,\r\nheaving passage that communicated with the fore part of the ship.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to the engine-room hatchway.  Down below he could see\r\nthe mass of complicated machinery throbbing in the yellow glimmer of\r\nthe oil lamps, while the hot atmosphere was filled with a horrible\r\nodour of steam and burning oil.\r\n\r\nHere, at any rate, the men were doing their duty right manfully, for he\r\ncould see the engineers, gripping the shiny rails as they leant over\r\nthe swaying, vibrating engines, calmly oiling the bearings of the\r\nplunging rods and cranks.  The \"chief,\" his eyes fixed upon the\r\nindicators, was alertly awaiting the frequently recurring clank which\r\ndenoted that the propeller was racing.  For a few moments Ellerton\r\nstood there fascinated, the spectacle of an engine-room in a vessel in\r\na storm was new to the lad, whose experience of the sea was confined to\r\na sailing barque.\r\n\r\nSuddenly above the monotonous clank of the piston-rods came a hideous\r\ngrinding sound.  The cylinders began to give out vast columns of steam,\r\nas the engines ran at terrifying speed.\r\n\r\nThrough the vapour Ellerton could discern the \"chief,\" galvanised into\r\nextraordinary alertness, make a rush for a valve, while his assistants,\r\nshouting and gesticulating, dashed hither and thither amid the confined\r\nspaces between the quivering machinery.\r\n\r\nThe main shaft had broken, and the _San Martin_ was helpless in the\r\nteeth of the hurricane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAGROUND\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant Ellerton hesitated; ought he to return to his\r\nfriends or make his way for'ard?  The _San Martin_, losing steerage\r\nway, was rolling horribly in the trough of the sea; any instant she\r\nmight turn turtle.\r\n\r\nThere was a rush of terrified firemen from the grim inferno of the\r\nstokeholds; the engineers, having taken necessary precautions against\r\nan explosion of the boilers, hastened to follow their example,\r\nscrambling in a struggling mass between the narrow opening of the\r\npartially closed hatchway.\r\n\r\nClearly Ellerton had no means of gaining the deck in the rear of that\r\nhuman press; so lurching and staggering along the alley-way he made his\r\nway aft, where he met Mr. McKay, who, assisted by Andy, was about to go\r\non deck.  Terence, looking a picture of utter misery in the yellow\r\nlight of the saloon, and Quexo, his olive skin ashy grey with fear, had\r\nalready joined the others.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Hoppy,\" shouted Andy cheerfully.  \"Give me a hand with the\r\ngovernor.  Terence, you had better stay here.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully watching their chance, the two lads managed to help Mr. McKay\r\nto the shelter of the poop deck-house, and they were about to return\r\nfor Donaghue and the mulatto when they encountered Captain Perez and\r\nthe first mate.  Both were in a state bordering on frenzy, the captain\r\nrolling his eyes and calling for the protection of a thousand saints,\r\nwhile the mate was mumbling mechanically the last compass course, \"Sur\r\noeste, cuarto oeste\" (S.W. by W.).\r\n\r\nThe cowardly officers had deserted their posts!\r\n\r\nIn an instant Fanshaw Ellerton saw his chance--and took it.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him, Andy!\" he shouted, setting the example by throwing himself\r\nupon the Peruvian skipper.\r\n\r\nThe man did not resist; he seemed incapable of doing anything.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother about the other,\" hissed the apprentice.  \"Make this chap\r\ncome with us to the bridge.  I'll be the skipper and he'll be the\r\nfigurehead.\"\r\n\r\nThe two chums dragged the captain across the heaving deck, up the\r\nswaying monkey-ladder, and gained the lofty bridge.\r\n\r\nEllerton glanced to windward.  His seamanship, poor though it was,\r\nbegan to assert itself.  The wind was going down slightly, but, veering\r\nto the nor'ard, was causing a horrible jumble of cross-seas--not so\r\nlofty as the mountainous waves a few hours ago, but infinitely more\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\nThe _San Martin_, swept on bow, quarter, and broadside, rolled and\r\npitched, the white cascades pouring from her storm-washed decks; yet\r\nEllerton realised that she possessed a considerable amount of buoyancy\r\nby the way she shook herself clear of the tons of water that poured\r\nacross her.\r\n\r\nThe wheel was deserted.  The steersman, finding that his officers had\r\nfled and that the vessel carried no way, had followed his superior's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nCowering under the lee of the funnel casing were about twelve of the\r\ncrew, including the bo'sun and quartermaster.\r\n\r\n\"Tell the captain,\" yelled Ellerton to his chum, \"to order those men to\r\nset the storm staysail, if they value their hides.\"\r\n\r\nAndy interpreted the order, which the captain, gaining a faint\r\nsuspicion of confidence, communicated to the bo'sun.\r\n\r\nThe bare chance of saving their lives urged the men into action.\r\nUnharmed, they succeeded in gaining the fo'c'sle, and in less than ten\r\nminutes the stiff canvas was straining on the forestay.\r\n\r\nGathering way, the _San Martin_, no longer rolling, pounded sluggishly\r\nthrough the foam-flecked sea.\r\n\r\nEllerton would not risk setting any canvas aft; he was content to let\r\nthe vessel drive.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him whether we have plenty of sea room--whether there is any\r\ndanger of running ashore during the next hour or so?\"\r\n\r\nAndy put the question.\r\n\r\n\"No, senor; there is plenty of sea room.\"\r\n\r\nThat was enough.  The apprentice cared not what course he steered, so\r\nlong as he kept the waves well on the quarter.  When the hurricane was\r\nover they could carry on till they fell in with some passing vessel and\r\ngot a tow into port.\r\n\r\n\"That's right.  Tell him to take his watch below,\" continued the\r\napprentice.  \"And you might get hold of some oilskins, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nObediently the skipper left the bridge, and, steeling himself for a\r\nlong trick at the helm, Ellerton grasped the spokes of the wheel with\r\nfirm hands.\r\n\r\nAt length the day broke, and with it a regular deluge of rain, pouring\r\nfrom an unbroken mass of scudding, deep blue clouds.  The rain beat\r\ndown the vicious crests, but the sea still ran \"mountains high.\"\r\n\r\nAbout noon Mr. McKay expressed his intention of joining Ellerton on the\r\nbridge, and assisted by his son he left the shelter of the poop.\r\n\r\nFrom the foot of the poop-ladder to that of the bridge a life-line had\r\nbeen rigged to give the protection that the shattered bulwarks no\r\nlonger afforded.\r\n\r\nWhen midway between the two ladders, a roll of the vessel caused Mr.\r\nMcKay to lurch heavily towards the rope.  His wounded limb proved\r\nunequal to the strain, and falling heavily upon the main rope his\r\nweight broke the lashings that held it to the ring-bolt.  Before Andy\r\ncould save him, Mr. McKay had crashed against the main hatchway.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt?\" asked Andy anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so,\" replied his father, manfully suppressing a groan.  \"My\r\nleg is broken.\"\r\n\r\nBy dint of considerable exertion the sufferer was taken back to the\r\nsaloon, and the ship's surgeon, who had been routed out of his cabin,\r\npronounced the injury to be a double fracture.\r\n\r\nEllerton, his whole attention fixed upon keeping the vessel on her\r\ncourse, had neither observed nor heard the noise of the accident, and\r\ngreat was his concern when Andy mounted the bridge and informed him of\r\nthe catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can leave the command,\" he remarked.  \"No doubt that\r\nyellow-skinned johnny has recovered his nerve by now.\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Captain Antonio Perez gained the bridge.  He had\r\nlost his suave, self-confident manner, and his general appearance\r\nshowed a change for the better in his moral and physical condition.\r\nYet, without a word of thanks to the English lad who had saved the\r\nsituation, he called up two of the seamen, and placed them at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"He might have been a bit civil over the business,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Poor brute!  I dare say he feels his position pretty acutely.  I only\r\nhope he won't break down in a hurry,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days the _San Martin_ fled before the storm, the\r\ntrysail keeping her steady and checking any tendency to broach-to.  The\r\nwind had increased to almost its former violence on the evening of the\r\nfirst day, but the vessel was then close on the outer edge of the\r\nstorm-path.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, who was suffering considerably, bore his injuries gamely,\r\nwhile Terence, who had recovered from his bout of sea-sickness, began\r\nto take a new interest in life.  Quexo, however, still lay on the floor\r\nof the stateroom, refusing to eat or drink, and groaning dismally at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon he's sorry he followed the Americanos across the wide river\r\nthat tastes of salt,\" said Terence, quoting the Nicaraguan way of\r\nspeaking of the sea.  \"Even I can feel sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good sign,\" remarked Andy.  \"Yesterday you hadn't the pluck\r\nto feel sorry for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day of the storm the wind piped down\r\nconsiderably, and the Peruvian captain ordered the fore and aft canvas\r\nto be set.  The engine-room staff also began to take steps to attempt\r\nthe temporary repairing of the shafting, and had already removed a\r\nconsiderable portion of the plating of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nAs yet the sky was completely overcast.  At noon the officers, sextant\r\nin hand, waited in vain for an opportunity of \"shooting the sun.\"\r\nWhere the ship was, no one on board knew, though it was agreed that she\r\nwas driven several miles to the south'ard of her proper course.\r\n\r\nThe weather began to improve as night drew on.  The setting sun was\r\njust visible in a patch of purple sky, showing that fine weather might\r\nbe expected from that quarter.  The glass, too, was rising; not\r\nrapidly, but gradually and surely.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a good night's rest,\" exclaimed Andy, for throughout the gale\r\nthe lads had turned in \"all standing.\"\r\n\r\nBut Andy was doomed to be disappointed, for at four bells in the middle\r\nwatch (2 a.m.) a sudden crash roused the sleepers from their berths.\r\nThe _San Martin_ was hard and fast aground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nABANDONED\r\n\r\nHastily assuring the helpless Mr. McKay that they would soon return and\r\ntell him how things really stood, the three lads rushed on deck.\r\n\r\nIt needed no seaman's instinct to tell that the _San Martin_ was\r\ndoomed.  Scudding before the lessening gale, she had been lifted on the\r\ncrest of a huge roller and dropped fairly on the rocks.  Her forward\r\npart, trembling under the tremendous blows of the waves, was hard and\r\nfast aground, while her after part, lifting to the heave of the ocean,\r\nassisted, like a gigantic lever, in the destruction of her bows.\r\n\r\nAbove the roar of the waves, the howling of the wind, and the\r\nshattering of iron plates, arose the frantic shouts of the crew.\r\n\r\nAlready demoralised by their trying experiences in the gale, the last\r\nvestiges of discipline had vanished.  In the darkness, for now no\r\nfavouring lightning flash came to throw a light upon the scene, the\r\nPeruvian crew rushed madly for the boats, fighting, cursing,\r\nentreating, and imploring the saints.\r\n\r\nFor'ard a succession of rapid cracks, as the trysail, having burst its\r\nsheets, was flogging itself to ribbons, added to the din, till the\r\nforemast, buckling close to the deck, crashed over the side.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" shouted Andy, and even then his voice sounded faint in the\r\nmidst of the terrifying uproar, \"let's get the pater on deck.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Better stop where he is.  What chance do you think these fellows will\r\nhave?\" and he pointed to the struggling mass of frenzied seamen as they\r\nclambered into the boats.\r\n\r\nAlready the cutter, still in the davits, was crowded, the men striving\r\nto swing her clear with oars and stretchers, while others were\r\nscrambling up the boat ladders.\r\n\r\nRound swung the foremost davit.  The men who had already climbed into\r\nher began to lower away the boat-falls.  A sudden lurch sent the\r\ncutter, already at a dangerous angle, crashing into the ship's side.\r\nThe lower block of the foremost fall became disentangled, and, amidst a\r\nchorus of shrieks, the boat swung stern in the air, shooting its human\r\nfreight into the surging waters.\r\n\r\nThe next instant a huge wave dashed the swaying cutter into matchwood,\r\nthe wind drowning the death shouts of a score of hapless victims.\r\n\r\nHeedless of the fate of their comrades, the remainder of the crew made\r\na headlong rush for one of the quarter boats.  Being more to lee'ard,\r\nfor the _San Martin_ had struck with the wind on her starboard quarter,\r\nthis boat seemed to stand little chance.\r\n\r\nEllerton could hear the captain's voice, urging the men to swing the\r\nboat clear.  The apprentice sprang towards the falls.\r\n\r\n\"You are not going to throw away your life, are you?\" shouted Andy,\r\ngrasping him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I'm going to give those fellows a chance.  Stand by that rope,\r\ntake a turn round that cleat, and lower when I give the word.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the Peruvian seamen had scrambled into the boat.  Not one\r\nof these cared who was left; all that they knew was that a few remained\r\nto man the falls, but in the darkness they were unaware that it was the\r\nBritish lads who stayed to help them.\r\n\r\n\"Lower!\" yelled Ellerton.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the ropes ran through the blocks.  The crest of a wave received\r\nthe frail boat, and, more by luck than by good management, the seamen\r\ncontrived to disengage the falls.  Then the oars splashed, and the next\r\ninstant the boat was lost to sight in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant the chums stood in silence, grasping one of the now\r\nburdenless davits.  They were alone--a crippled man, three lads, and a\r\nnative boy--upon an abandoned vessel that threatened every moment to\r\npart amidships.\r\n\r\nWhere they were they had no possible knowledge.  The ship was aground,\r\nbut whether on an isolated rock, or, what was more than likely, upon\r\nthe edge of an encircling reef, they knew not.  They must wait till\r\ndaylight--if they were fated to see the dawn of another day--but they\r\nwere determined that the anxious period of waiting should not be passed\r\nin idleness.\r\n\r\nReturning to the cabin where Mr. McKay was lying in suspense, awaiting\r\nnews of their hazardous position, the lads briefly explained what had\r\nhappened during their absence on deck.\r\n\r\n\"We must hope for the best,\" observed the invalid.  \"And, after that,\r\nwe stand a better chance than those in the boat.  Even if those poor\r\nfellows escape being dashed to death upon a rock-bound shore, or being\r\nengulfed in the waves, they'll have a terrible time.  No water or\r\nprovisions, no compass--a thousand tortures before they reach land or\r\nare picked up by a passing craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the seas are getting less heavy,\" said Andy.  \"Is it because\r\nthe tide is falling?\"\r\n\r\n\"The tide may have something to do with it,\" replied Mr. McKay; \"though\r\nthe rise and fall is barely four feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our stern seems to be settling,\" said Ellerton.  \"The ship doesn't\r\nappear quite so lively.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be because the water is pouring into the after-hold,\"\r\nremarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"In that case the vessel is settling on the bottom; otherwise she would\r\nsink.  That's another point in our favour, and it often happens that\r\nthere is deep water close to the reef,\" said the apprentice.  \"But\r\nlet's to work.  Terence, you know where the steward's pantry is.  Take\r\na lamp and fetch up as much stuff as you can carry.  Andy, will you\r\nplease take Quexo with you and bring up a couple of barricoes of water?\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged, Ellerton collected five lifebelts, one of\r\nwhich he proceeded to fasten round Mr. McKay's body.\r\n\r\n\"We may want them, sir; but, on the other hand, we may not.  In any\r\ncase, if there is an island under our lee we had better wear these,\r\nespecially if we have to land through the surf.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy I shall have some difficulty in getting through the surf,\"\r\nreplied Mr. McKay with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, sir; we'll pull you through,\" was the determined assurance.\r\n\r\nPresently Andy and the mulatto returned, having found and secured a\r\nsupply of the precious fluid.\r\n\r\n\"The fore-hold and the engine-room are flooded,\" reported the former,\r\n\"and I think there's a hole on the starboard quarter.  But I believe\r\nthere's some of the crew up for'ard--I heard them groaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and see,\" replied Ellerton, buckling on a lifebelt and\r\npicking up a lantern.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, lads,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Trust us,\" answered Andy, likewise putting on a belt.  \"We need not\r\nwait for Terence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's not half so rough,\" he continued as they gained the deck,\r\nwhich had settled to a list of less than ten degrees, and no longer\r\nlifted as the rollers swept past.  \"See, very few of the waves break\r\nover the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bad job those cowardly beggars pushed off,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\"They would have done better to have waited.  But listen!\"\r\n\r\nAbove the moaning of the wind came the unmistakable sound of a groan.\r\n\r\n\"It's down there,\" exclaimed Andy, pointing to a battened-down hatchway.\r\n\r\n\"There's no harm in opening it now,\" replied his companion, casting off\r\nthe lashings and unbolting the heavy iron slide.  \"Now, then, down you\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\nAndy, holding the lantern well behind his head, slowly descended, but\r\nat two steps from the bottom of the ladder his feet encountered water.\r\nAt the same time a deafening bellow echoed in the confined space.\r\n\r\n\"Great snakes!\" he exclaimed, \"it's an ox!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor brute, it's nearly drowned, and half starved into the bargain.\r\nAnd here is a pen full of sheep.  I wonder where they keep the fodder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's some pressed hay,\" announced Andy after a short examination.\r\n\"And I don't think the salt water has touched it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throw some down in that corner,\" continued his companion, pointing to\r\na part of the flat that the sea, by reason of the ship's list, had not\r\nreached.  \"We'll let the brutes loose; they can't do much damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now set to, lads,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, when they returned to the\r\nsaloon, and found Terence with a regular store of provisions--the loot\r\nof the steward's pantry.  \"Make a good meal, for our future movements\r\nare uncertain.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be light in another hour,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"And the sea's going down,\" chimed in the apprentice.\r\n\r\n\"And our spirits are rising,\" added Terence.\r\n\r\n\"You speak for yourself, Terry, my boy,\" replied Andy, laughing.  \"Your\r\nspirits were low enough a few days ago.\"\r\n\r\nAll hands set to with a will, for even Quexo had recovered his former\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\n\"This storm has lasted longer than usual,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"It was\r\nof more than ordinary severity.  Still, I've known similar instances,\r\nand within three hours of the height of the hurricane the wind has died\r\naway to a flat calm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall be able to take to the boat almost immediately after\r\ndaylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there one left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two.  I think one is stove in, but the other seems sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"A long voyage in an open boat on the ocean is no light matter,\"\r\nreplied Mr. McKay.  \"If we were in the latitude of the Trades the task\r\nwould be easier; but here we are, I imagine, in a zone of calms\r\nalternating with violent hurricanes.  The best thing we can do is to\r\nland on the island--if we are near one, as I firmly believe is the\r\ncase--and bring ashore as many of the ship's stores as we can.  Then,\r\nif not sighted by any passing craft, we can set to work and deck in one\r\nof the boats, provision her, and shape a course for the nearest trading\r\nstation.  By the time the boat is ready I trust I shall be firmer on my\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that, Quexo?\" asked Andy.  \"You may be ashore in a few\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\nQuexo grinned approvingly.  He had had enough of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Don't build up his hopes too high,\" continued Mr. McKay.  \"Even if the\r\nweather continues fine, it may be days before we can effect a landing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because after these hurricanes, although the open sea is comparatively\r\ncalm, a heavy ground swell sets in on shore.  A boat would certainly be\r\ncapsized, unless there happens to be a shelter formed by a barrier reef\r\nof coral.  But now, up on deck.  It will be daylight in less than ten\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nEagerly the lads ran up the companion, and what a sight met their gaze\r\nas the tropical day quickly mastered the long hours of darkness!\r\n\r\nThe _San Martin_ lay on the outer edge of a long, level reef of coral,\r\nagainst which the surf still hammered, throwing up clouds of white\r\nspray.\r\n\r\nLess than fifty yards from the port quarter was a gap in the barrier,\r\ngiving entrance to the lagoon.  The doomed ship had missed the opening\r\nby half her own length.\r\n\r\nShe lay with her bows pointed diagonally towards the reef.  Her funnel\r\nand foremast had gone by the board, while she showed unmistakable signs\r\nof breaking in two, for her bow and stern had \"sagged\" till amidships\r\nher port side was flush with the water, while, correspondingly, her\r\nstarboard side, owing to the ship's list, was but five feet higher.\r\n\r\nBut it was neither the ship nor the reef that attracted the castaways'\r\nattention.  Barely a quarter of a mile away was an island, rugged and\r\nprecipitous, the highest point towering a thousand feet above the level\r\nof the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn several places the ground sloped towards the sea, the valley being\r\nthickly covered with luxuriant foliage, while for a distance of nearly\r\na mile was a strand of dazzling whiteness, upon which the sheltered\r\nwaters of the lagoon lapped as gently as the ripples of a mill pond in\r\na summer's breeze.  Elsewhere, so far as could be seen, the rocks rose\r\nsheer from the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Any sign of the boat?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I'll get a glass,\" replied Ellerton, and swarming up the\r\nstanchion of the bridge--for the ladder had been swept away--he gained\r\nthe chart-house.\r\n\r\nFrom his elevated position he swept the shore with the telescope, but\r\nno trace of the boat was to be seen.  Neither, so far as he could\r\njudge, was the island inhabited.\r\n\r\nOn rejoining his comrades, the young apprentice next directed his\r\nattention to the two remaining boats.  One, a gig, was, as he had\r\nsurmised, stove in, three of the planks being shattered.  For the time\r\nbeing she was useless, though, he reflected, she might be patched up at\r\nsome future date.\r\n\r\nThe other, a 23-ft. cutter, was still secured to the boat-booms, and\r\nwas practically uninjured.  Her size and weight would, he knew, be a\r\nsevere drawback when the time came to hoist her outboard.\r\n\r\n\"I vote we bring your pater up on deck, Andy,\" said he.  \"We must have\r\nhim out of the saloon sooner or later.  The sooner the better, I think,\r\nbecause he can, if we place him on a pile of cushions close to the\r\nbreak of the poop, direct operations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a long and tedious task.  Mr. McKay was no featherweight, and\r\nhis injured limb had to be carefully handled.  Moreover, the companion\r\nladder was steep and narrow.\r\n\r\nAt length Ellerton solved the difficulty by procuring one of the men's\r\nmess tables, nailing a strut to one end, against which the victim\r\nsteadied himself by his sound leg while he was stretched at full length\r\non the board.  On this improvised sleigh four pairs of strong arms\r\ndragged the patient up the steep stairway and on to the poop deck.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that, sir?\" asked Ellerton, pointing to the\r\nisland of refuge.  \"Isn't it superb?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" assented Mr. McKay.  \"I hope we'll find it so, for we will\r\nhave to throw ourselves upon its hospitality for a few weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know its name, sir?\" continued the apprentice.\r\n\r\n\"No; has it one?\" was the astonished reply.\r\n\r\n\"The Nameless Island,\" announced Ellerton.  \"Now, lads, three cheers\r\nfor the Nameless Island!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING\r\n\r\nThis burst of high spirits showed how light-hearted the castaways were\r\nin the face of difficulties, for what lay before them and how they were\r\nto reach the island required all their powers of thought and action.\r\n\r\n\"How do you propose to get the cutter over the side?\" asked Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"By means of one of the derricks,\" replied Ellerton promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so; but where is the power required to turn the winches to come\r\nfrom?  We've no steam at our command, you know, and these winches are\r\nnot adapted to manual power.\"\r\n\r\nThe apprentice's face clouded; he thought for a few minutes, then--\r\n\r\n\"We can top one of the derricks and rig up a tackle, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"But what is the weight of the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ours on the _Tophet_ weighed twelve hundredweight; this one is about\r\nthe same size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then rig a gun tackle, and the four of you will manage the job, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly two large double blocks were obtained and the rope rove\r\nready for use.  One of the blocks was secured to the cud of the\r\nderrick, which was then hoisted to an angle of about forty-five\r\ndegrees.  This took time, but at length everything was ready for the\r\ncrucial test.\r\n\r\n\"Now, all together!\"\r\n\r\nThe three lads and the mulatto tailed on to the rope.  The blocks\r\nsqueaked as the strain began to tell; the cutter began to lift,\r\nthen--crash!\r\n\r\nFlat on their backs fell the four lads; high in the air jerked the\r\ndisengaged lower block.  The slings to which it had been fastened had\r\nsnapped.\r\n\r\nSlowly the victims regained their feet, Andy rubbing a tender portion\r\nof his anatomy, Terence gasping for breath, for Andy's head had\r\nwell-nigh winded him.  Ellerton was clapping his hands to a rapidly\r\nrising bump on the back of his head, while Quexo, whose skull was as\r\nhard as iron, was hopping all over the deck, rubbing his shins, that\r\nhad saved the apprentice's head at the mulatto's expense.\r\n\r\n\"Try again, boys!\" shouted Andy.  \"Everything on board this blessed\r\ncraft seems rotten!\"\r\n\r\nA new span was placed in position, and the tackle again manned, and\r\nthis time their efforts were crowned with success.  The cutter rose\r\nslowly in the air, till it hung fire five feet above the shattered\r\nbulwarks.\r\n\r\n\"Belay, there!  Man the guy-rope!\"\r\n\r\nThe derrick swung outboard, till the cutter was poised above the water\r\nand well clear of the sloping sides of the hull.\r\n\r\n\"Lower away handsomely.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly the boat dipped, till at length she rode, sheltered under the\r\nlee of her stranded parent, upon the bosom of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, as his son swarmed down the rope,\r\ndisengaged the tackle, and allowed the cutter a generous length of\r\npainter.\r\n\r\nThen the work of loading her was begun.  It was decided that for the\r\nfirst trip nothing more than was absolutely necessary for immediate use\r\nwas to be taken, until it was settled where their camp was to be fixed,\r\nand whether the island had any inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"A small barrico of water will be sufficient, though I am certain there\r\nare springs amongst those trees,\" said Ellerton.  His sense of\r\nresponsibility was hourly increasing.  \"A barrel of flour, some tinned\r\ngoods, canvas and rope for a tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not forgetting hatchets, knives, and firearms,\" added Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Firearms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye; one never knows how the natives--if there be natives on the\r\nisland--will greet us.  Most of the Pacific Islanders are fairly\r\npeaceable, thanks to missionary enterprise and the fear of a visit from\r\na warship; yet cannibalism still exists.  I have known instances of the\r\ncrews of small 'pearlers' being treacherously surprised, killed, and\r\neaten.  So get hold of the arms; you'll probably find the key of the\r\ncaptain's cabin in the chart-house; if not, burst open the door.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton departed upon his errand, and presently returned with the news\r\nthat there was no trace of the key.  \"Here is a sextant and a bundle of\r\ncharts, however,\" he added.  \"They are bound to be useful, although I\r\ncannot understand the meaning of the depths on the chart.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in 'brazas,' equal to about five and a half English feet.\r\nBut, as you say, the charts will be of extreme importance to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Terence, let's burgle the captain's cabin,\" exclaimed\r\nEllerton, laying hold of a hatchet.\r\n\r\nSoon the sound of blows was heard, followed by the splintering of wood,\r\nand the two lads returned literally armed to the teeth.\r\n\r\nEach had a couple of rifles slung across his back; Terence carried half\r\na dozen revolvers in his arms and a sheath-knife between his teeth,\r\nwhile Ellerton staggered beneath the weight of several belts of ball\r\ncartridges and a box of revolver ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"There's more to come; the place is like a regular armoury,\" explained\r\nTerence.\r\n\r\n\"That's somewhat unusual,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Most captains keep\r\nfirearms of a kind in their cabins.  I strongly suspect that those arms\r\nwere to be sold to some South American insurgents.  They are much too\r\ngood for bartering with the South Sea Islanders.  Nevertheless, I'm\r\nright glad we have been able to arm ourselves thoroughly, as I expected\r\nwe should have to be content with a couple of pistols between the lot\r\nof us.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of loading the boat proceeded briskly, till the strictly\r\nlimited quantity of gear was carefully stowed under the thwarts.  Then\r\ncame the question, how were they going to transport the crippled Mr.\r\nMcKay to the shore?\r\n\r\n\"Hoist me over by the derrick, of course,\" replied he.  \"A couple of\r\nrope spans round the plank and their bights slipped over the hook of\r\nthe lower block, and the trick's done.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton and Terence thereupon slipped down a rope into the boat and\r\ncarefully guided the swaying mess table and its helpless burden on to a\r\ncouple of the after thwarts.  This done, they were joined by Andy and\r\nQuexo, and, shipping the heavy ash oars, they pulled clear of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe first fifty yards meant hard and careful rowing, for directly they\r\nwere beyond the shelter of the stranded vessel they felt the full force\r\nof the rollers as they dashed against the coral reef, barely a boat's\r\nlength to lee'ard.\r\n\r\nOnce, indeed, it seemed as if the cutter were bound to be swept upon\r\nthe rocks; but by dint of the utmost exertions of her crew, the boat\r\nsurely and slowly drew away from the influence of the rollers.\r\n\r\n\"My word, that was a narrow squeak!\" exclaimed Andy, wiping his face,\r\nfrom which the perspiration ran freely.  \"I thought we were going to be\r\ncapsized that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't say much for the chances of those poor fellows last night,\"\r\nreplied Ellerton.  \"They must have dropped smack on top of the reef.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon find out,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"You see, they were immediately\r\nto lee'ard of the ship, and it was high water at the time.  If they\r\nsurvived, we'll find them ashore right enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw no sign of the boat when I looked through the glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be because there is a creek or cove that is invisible from\r\nthe ship.  Being directly to wind'ard, we are bound to find either the\r\nmen or the remains of the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship is sitting up well,\" remarked Andy, for, the tide having\r\ndropped nearly six feet--it had been abnormally high by reason of the\r\nterrific wind--they could see the top of one of her propeller blades.\r\n\"Do you think she'll stay there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly doesn't seem as if she is likely to slip off into deep\r\nwater, but we cannot say for certain.  The first fine day there's\r\nlittle or no swell we'll sound all round her.  Now, give way, lads.\"\r\n\r\nThe rowers resumed their oars, and the boat, passing through the narrow\r\ngap in the reef, gained the shelter of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, isn't it?\" exclaimed Terence enthusiastically, as he rested on\r\nhis oar and gazed into the clear depths of the tranquil water.  \"Won't\r\nwe be able to have some bathes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to be careful if you do,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"There are\r\nbound to be sharks about.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not think it advisable to call the lads' attention to a\r\ncommotion in the water a few hundred yards in front of the boat.  From\r\nhis inclined position he could see ahead, while the rowers had their\r\nbacks turned in that direction.  His keen eyes had detected the\r\nsinister dorsal fin of not one, but many sharks, all cutting towards\r\none spot.  There could be but little doubt of the fate of the Peruvian\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the approaching oars disturbed the huge monsters, and they\r\ndarted off to the shelter of the rock-strewn floor of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nUnaware of the tragedy, the lads urged the boat almost over the fatal\r\nspot, and five minutes later the cutter's forefoot grounded on the\r\nsandy beach.\r\n\r\n\"Terence, I want you and Quexo to stay in the boat,\" said Ellerton,\r\nafter the survivors had, by a common impulse, knelt down and returned\r\nthanks to Divine Providence for their escape.  \"Keep her stern from\r\nslewing round, so that we can push off in a hurry.  Andy and I are\r\ngoing to explore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, buckling on a revolver and an ammunition belt, and grasping a\r\nrifle in his hand, Ellerton took a flying leap over the bows and\r\nalighted on the sand.\r\n\r\nThe lads found themselves on the shore of a small bay, its extremities\r\nbounded by two towering cliffs, that rose sheer from the lagoon.  That\r\nto the left was not less than five hundred feet in height, while the\r\nother was but slightly lower.  Midway between these impassable\r\nboundaries the land sloped abruptly to the beach, and was thickly\r\ncovered with cocoanut palms.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your weather eye lifting, Andy,\" cautioned Ellerton, who had\r\ntaken the precaution of charging both the magazine of his rifle and the\r\nchambers of his revolver.\r\n\r\nIt was an unnecessary warning, for Andy was an infinitely better scout\r\nthan his companion; still, it showed that Ellerton was fast adopting\r\nthe manner of life required in a wild and unsettled country.\r\n\r\nSkirting the edge of the wood, the lads kept a vigilant look-out for\r\nany traces of human agency, but nothing was visible.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to a small stream, which, trickling down the steep\r\nhillside, was lost in the sand.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be no lack of fresh water,\" exclaimed Andy thankfully, for he\r\nknew the value of that precious fluid.  \"But, I say, isn't everything\r\nquiet?\"  For, save the babbling of the brook and the distant roar of\r\nthe breakers on the reef, there was an unaccustomed silence.  Not a\r\nbird sang in the groves, not an animal rustled the thick undergrowth.\r\n\r\n\"I think we may take it for granted that the island is uninhabited--at\r\nleast, this part,\" said Andy, as they completed their walk along the\r\nshores of the bay.  \"Otherwise, there's almost sure to be a beaten\r\ntrack to the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't promise much for the boat's crew,\" answered Ellerton.\r\nThen, with an exclamation of surprise, he shouted: \"Look!  What's that?\"\r\n\r\nLying on the sand a few feet from the water's edge was a mournful relic\r\nof the unfortunate boat, her back-board bearing the words _San Martin_.\r\nA little farther they found an oar.\r\n\r\n\"There were two boats, remember,\" said Ellerton.  \"And one we know was\r\ncapsized.\"\r\n\r\n\"I vote we explore the next bay,\" exclaimed Andy.  \"There's no suitable\r\nclearing here for a camp, and felling trees takes time; so let's get\r\nback to the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Mr. McKay on their return.\r\n\r\n\"We must push off and land on the other side of the cliff,\" said his\r\nson.  \"There may be a better site for our tent.  It's too steep and\r\ndensely wooded here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any signs of the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only part of their boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much,\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"This looks more promising,\" exclaimed Andy enthusiastically, as the\r\nboat slowly rounded the northernmost of the two cliffs.\r\n\r\nHere the land sloped less abruptly towards the lagoon, while in places\r\nthere were terraces almost bare of trees.  In the background towered a\r\nrange of mountains whose rugged sides gave the appearance of being\r\nunclimbable, while on either hand of the bay rose lofty cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe beach, too, was better adapted for landing purposes than where they\r\nhad first touched, consisting of sand interspersed by ledges of rocks\r\njutting seawards, thus forming convenient natural jetties.\r\n\r\n\"This will do admirably,\" said Ellerton, pointing to a narrow cove\r\nbetwixt the ledges.  \"There's sand at its head, so there's no fear of\r\nthe boat being damaged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP\r\n\r\nSlowly the cutter was backed in till its sternpost stuck on the smooth,\r\neven bottom.\r\n\r\nThe castaways could not have chosen a better harbour.  On either hand\r\nthe rocks, smooth and flat-topped, allowed a boat to be moored\r\nalongside without danger of being left high and dry at low water, while\r\nthe ledge shelved so gradually that it was possible to bring the boat's\r\ngunwale level with the natural pier at any state of the tide.\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better make a tour of exploration as we did before,\"\r\nsaid Andy.  \"Not that I think this part of the island is inhabited any\r\nmore than yonder bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Andy,\" exclaimed Terence, \"isn't it about time I had a spell\r\nashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Terence,\" replied Ellerton.  \"You go with Andy and take\r\nQuexo; I'll stay with Mr. McKay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Hoppy,\" replied Terence, and without further ado he jumped\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n\"Here, take this rope and make her stern fast before you go,\" said\r\nEllerton.  \"And you, Andy, stand by with the painter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I make fast to?\" asked Terence.  \"This rock is as smooth\r\nas a table.\"\r\n\r\n\"See if there's a lump of rock on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nTerence crossed the landing-place, holding the rope's-end in his hand.\r\nSuddenly he shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Come here, you fellows!  Here's a boat!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a rush to where Terence stood, while even Mr. McKay raised\r\nhimself on his elbow, eager to hear the news.\r\n\r\nLying bottom upwards on the sandy shore was the ill-fated boat in which\r\nthe last of the crew attempted to reach the shore.  Her bows were\r\nconsiderably damaged, while amidships a portion of her keel and both\r\ngarboards had been stove in, leaving a jagged hole nearly two feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nFour or five oars lay on the shore within a few feet of the boat, but\r\nthere were no signs of the hapless crew; the sand above high-water mark\r\nwas innocent of footprints.\r\n\r\n\"They are drowned, sure enough,\" said Andy sadly.\r\n\r\nAlas! though they did not know it, the fate of the crew was far more\r\nterrible.  Holed on the outer reef, the boat, rapidly filling, had been\r\nswept into the lagoon, where the waves, though high, were not so\r\nterrific as outside the coral barrier.\r\n\r\nWell it was that the watchers on the wreck heard not the awful shrieks\r\nas the sharks fought for and seized their helpless prey.\r\n\r\nEllerton returned to the cutter to inform Mr. McKay of their discovery,\r\nwhile the others set off to explore.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour they were back, and reported that there were no\r\nsigns of human habitation, although the shore was strewn with the\r\nremains of the first boat that left the wreck, including most of the\r\noars, gratings, also a quantity of timber, presumably from the\r\nshattered decks of the _San Martin_.\r\n\r\n\"But we've found a fine place to pitch the tent,\" continued Andy.  \"You\r\nsee the second terrace?  Well, at the extreme right is a steep ravine.\r\nThe other two sides are enclosed by a wall of rock, while on this side\r\nthere is a natural path, although you can't distinguish it from where\r\nwe are.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds all right,\" said his father.  \"But how are we to get the\r\ngear up there--including the useless lump of animated clay in the shape\r\nof myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" replied Andy.\r\n\r\n\"We must find a more convenient spot at first,\" continued Mr. McKay.\r\n\"Then, when we have landed all the gear from the ship that we can\r\npossibly manage to move, we can devise some means of setting up a more\r\nsubstantial dwelling on the terrace you mention.  Now, if you will\r\nplease carry me ashore, you can proceed to unload the boat.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the adaptable jetty, the work of getting Mr.\r\nMcKay--crippled as he was--on shore was no easy task.  The patient bore\r\nthe discomfort gamely, uttering a heartfelt sigh of relief as the lads\r\nset the improvised stretcher down in the shade of a thin grove of\r\ncocoanut palms.\r\n\r\n\"How far away is the stream--I think you mentioned there was a stream\r\nin the bay?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Less than a hundred yards away.  It's very clean, but not so full as\r\nthe one we found,\" replied Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's set up the tent.  This place will do for a day or two at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\nThe chosen site consisted of soft springy turf, sloping very gradually\r\ntowards the lagoon.  In the background was a wall of rock, about forty\r\nfeet in height, forming the limit of the next terrace, while on either\r\nhand the trees served as an efficient screen from all winds save those\r\nblowing from the sea.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of their axes the lads felled five young palms, and soon\r\nstripped them of their heads.  Four of the trunks were then lashed in\r\npairs, and set up with guy-ropes at a distance of about fifteen feet\r\napart, and one end of the fifth pole was placed over the crutch formed\r\nby one of the pairs.\r\n\r\nThis done, Ellerton swarmed up the other pair of poles and fastened a\r\nsmall pulley to the extremity of one of them.  A rope was passed\r\nthrough the block, one end being lashed to the lower part of the fifth\r\npole that rested on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Haul away, lads!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd the pole, lifted into a horizontal position, was quickly placed\r\nbetween, thus forming the ridge of the tent.\r\n\r\nOne of the fore and aft sails was then thrown over the ridge pole and\r\nits end pegged down; while to make doubly sure, the lads piled stones\r\nand sand upon the ends of the canvas.  Filling in the back and front of\r\nthe tent with portions of another sail took an hour's steady work, and\r\nthe dwelling was then pronounced ready for occupation.\r\n\r\nThe box of ammunition, the rifles, bread cask, and water-beakers were\r\nneatly stowed against the afterpart of their dwelling, till, on Mr.\r\nMcKay's suggestion, a low barricade was erected close to the flap of\r\nthe tent.  Then pieces of canvas were cut and laid down to serve as\r\nbeds, the cripple having the use of the cushions that had been brought\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why we should sleep on the hard ground,\" remarked Terence.\r\n\"Of course, we have been used to it, but, after sleeping in a\r\ncomfortable bunk, we are bound to feel the difference.  So let us cut a\r\nnumber of small trees and fasten the strips of canvas to them like a\r\nstretcher.\"\r\n\r\nThis was accordingly done, the beds being raised from the ground by\r\nmeans of two stout planks lashed to short uprights driven firmly into\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\"There we are, all in a row,\" exclaimed Terence, as they surveyed the\r\nresult of their labour with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Quexo,\" said Andy, \"go down to the beach and gather as much\r\ndriftwood as you can carry.  And, Hoppy, you start opening that tin of\r\nbeef there, and I'll slice up the bread.  But----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed Terence and Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"We are a set of donkeys!  We haven't brought a pot or a kettle ashore\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boil the water in the beef-tin,\" said Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Spoil the coffee,\" objected Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Either that or nothing.  But how about a light?  Has anyone any\r\nmatches?\"\r\n\r\nMore disappointment.  Terence suggested using the object glass of the\r\ntelescope as a burning glass, but the sun was low in the heavens; Andy\r\nwas for sprinkling some powder on a heap of dry leaves and firing it by\r\nmeans of a blank cartridge; while Ellerton vaguely remembered that fire\r\nmight be obtained by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever tried to make a blaze that way?\" asked Mr. McKay.  \"I\r\ndon't think you would succeed.  Savages can do the trick, I know, but\r\nI've never seen a white man obtain fire by that means.  I would have\r\nsuggested flint and steel.  We have plenty of steel, only,\r\nunfortunately, flints are as scarce as diamonds on this island, I\r\nfancy.  However, now you have exhausted your brains over the problem,\r\nallow me to assist you.  Andy, put your hand in the inside pocket of my\r\ncoat and you'll find my metal match-box.\r\n\r\n\"Now you are satisfied,\" he continued, as his son produced the required\r\narticle.  \"The fact of the matter is, you were all in such a hurry to\r\nget ashore that you never gave a thought to the things most urgently\r\nrequired.  Lucky for you, my lad, you've a father to think for you.\r\nNow will you please empty that case of biscuits?  I am afraid some\r\nspray splashed over it, and in time the salt will make the biscuits\r\nsoft.\"\r\n\r\nAndy did as he was requested, but a moment later he uttered an\r\nexclamation of surprise, for on opening the lid he discovered a kettle,\r\nsaucepan, and coffee-pot, knives, forks, and spoons, while wedged in\r\nbetween the metal articles were bottles containing salt, pepper,\r\nvinegar, and several useful drugs in tabloid form.\r\n\r\n\"I say, pater, you are----\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely one who has learnt by experience the value of forethought.\r\nWhile you were busy on deck I sent Quexo to gather these things and\r\nstow them in a box.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the conversation was interrupted by a series of shrieks.  The\r\nlads seized their rifles and rushed to meet the mulatto, whose face was\r\nlivid with fear.\r\n\r\n\"A caiman is after me, senor,\" he shouted in his native tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" replied Andy; then turning to his companions he explained\r\nthat the mulatto had declared that an alligator had run after him.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible,\" he added.  \"However, we'll see what's frightened\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the edge of the wood that had obstructed their view of\r\nthat part of the bay where Quexo had been to gather dry sticks, the\r\nlads burst into a roar of laughter.  Sedately waddling over the sand\r\nwas a huge turtle.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, Hoppy,\" exclaimed Andy.  \"Get between him and the sea; we\r\ncan't afford to lose this chance.\"\r\n\r\nFinding its retreat cut off, the turtle began to throw up showers of\r\nsand with its flippers, but Andy rushed it, and, seizing one of the\r\ncreature's horny limbs, strove to capsize the reptile.\r\n\r\nThe task was beyond him; even with the aid of his two chums he could\r\nnot raise the shell-clad creature from the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Get hold of an oar and one of the empty tubs,\" he exclaimed\r\nbreathlessly.  \"You go, Terence.  Hoppy and I will prevent the turtle\r\ngetting away.\"\r\n\r\nPresently Terence returned with the desired article, and using the oar\r\nas a lever the three lads succeeded in turning the turtle on its back,\r\nwhen Andy, with a dexterous sweep of his knife, cut the animal's throat.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!  Turtle steak to-morrow, pater!\" he shouted on their return to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nQuexo gathered up the firewood that he had dropped in his flight, and\r\nas darkness set in, a roaring fire was kindled, and a gorgeous supper\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nThen, ere the last dying embers had ceased to glow, Terence, who had\r\nvolunteered to keep the first two hours' watch, shouldered his rifle\r\nand took up his position in the shelter of the neighbouring palm-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMAL THAT WOULDN'T BE RESCUED\r\n\r\nNo unusual incident marked the castaways' first night on the island.\r\nGuard was relieved with the utmost regularity, while the weary watches\r\nwere spent in gazing at the exterior of the tent and listening to the\r\nregular breathing of its four inmates.\r\n\r\nAt length the day broke, and the camp became the scene of activity.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, there was a rush to the boat; Quexo, however, remaining\r\nwith the injured Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nThe weather showed every indication of remaining fine, a light\r\nsouth-easterly breeze--a part of the regular trade-wind--blowing off\r\nshore, while not a cloud was visible in the dark blue sky.\r\n\r\n\"We must make two trips to-day,\" observed Andy, as they pushed off from\r\nthe little natural dock.  \"Yesterday the clouds kept the sun's rays\r\nfrom us, but to-day we will not be able to work during midday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, I don't feel like work,\" remarked Terence, stifling a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose there is some excuse for you, seeing you did two turns of\r\nsentry-go last night,\" replied his friend.  \"Still, this is an\r\nexceptional time, and we must set to work with a will.  Can we get over\r\nthe reef, do you think, Hoppy?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better stick to the channel,\" replied Ellerton.  \"You see, we\r\ndon't know the actual depth, and there is a slight swell on.  We'll\r\nboard on the port quarter, so as to get between the ship and the reef.\"\r\n\r\nThe lads plied their oars steadily yet without undue exertion, and in\r\nless than half an hour from the time of leaving the shore they ran\r\nalongside the stranded _San Martin_.\r\n\r\nEllerton's first care on boarding the wreck was to supply fresh water\r\nand food to the animals.  To get them safely ashore was a difficult\r\nproblem, for the ox was an unwieldy brute to ship aboard the cutter,\r\nwhile it was equally risky to let it swim ashore on account of the\r\npresence of numerous sharks.  The sheep could be trussed up and laid\r\nupon the bottom boards.\r\n\r\nAndy and Terence at once made for the provision-room, and returned\r\nladen with flour, salt beef, tinned goods, and some small chests of\r\npressed tea.  These articles they placed on deck close to the entry\r\nport and proceeded to procure more.\r\n\r\nEllerton, having attended to the live stock, made a thorough\r\nexploration of the after cabins and staggered on deck looking like a\r\nsecond-hand wardrobe dealer, for he realised the necessity of having a\r\ngood supply of clothing.  Then a huge pile of bedding, including\r\nwaterproof sheets, blankets, and pillows, was added to the already\r\nlarge collection of plunder.\r\n\r\n\"I think this lot will be sufficient for one trip,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"We may as well take the rest of the navigating instruments,\" replied\r\nEllerton, \"and, what is also necessary, the carpenter's chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital,\" replied his chum.  \"That will, of course, come in handy; but\r\nwon't we require it on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are enough tools for work both ashore and on board,\" said\r\nEllerton.  \"I've seen to that.  But I should like to get the animals\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ox?\"\r\n\r\n\"If possible.  Otherwise we must kill it and bring the carcase ashore\r\npiecemeal.\"\r\n\r\nAndy thought for some moments.  He, too, realised the danger of the\r\nanimal being devoured by sharks.  Dead or alive, the ox would be far\r\nmore useful to the castaways.\r\n\r\n\"How are we going to get the brute on deck?\" asked Terence.\r\n\r\nThis was a poser, for with the fall of the foremast the derricks for\r\nworking the fore-hold had also been carried away.\r\n\r\n\"We must rig up a pair of sheer-legs,\" observed Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Well?  How are we to pass a sling round the brute's body?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's as easy as pie; the beast is quiet enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you take the job on, Hoppy; I'd rather not.  So let's look sharp\r\nwith the sheer-legs; there's plenty of tackle to hoist the creature\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of making the early preparations proceeded without a hitch,\r\nthen Ellerton commenced his particular part of the operations.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of a lantern which he hung from the deck-beams, the\r\napprentice descended once more to the partially submerged hold.\r\nHolding a stout canvas sling, with a rope ready to haul tight the\r\nmoment the lifting gear was in position, Ellerton climbed over the\r\npartition of the stall.\r\n\r\nThe animal, now refreshed by its food and drink, had lost its docile\r\nmanner, and eyed the intruder with no friendly spirit.  Possibly it\r\nthought the youth was one of the brutal Peruvian cattle-drivers.  If\r\nso, there was some excuse for its action, for lowering its head the\r\nbrute tossed the apprentice right over the wooden partition, landing\r\nhim squarely in the midst of the startled sheep in the adjacent pen.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you nearly ready?\" asked a voice from above.\r\n\r\nEllerton sat up.  He was beginning to feel pain in more than one part\r\nof his anatomy.  The task of tackling an apparently inoffensive ox was\r\nnot going to be quite so easy as he imagined.\r\n\r\n\"Come and bear a hand,\" he replied.  \"The brute is getting vicious.\"\r\n\r\nAndy thereupon descended into the semi-gloom of the hold.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" continued the apprentice.  \"He nearly bumped my head\r\nagainst the deck-beams; as it was, I had a flight through space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm not going to pass a sling round him,\" said Andy.  \"We'll\r\nlasso him just behind the horns.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done, but then came the difficulty: how were they to release\r\nthe animal from the stall and drag it to the hatchway?\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" explained Andy, \"I'll take this end of the line on deck,\r\nwind it on to the tackle, and heave taut.  Then we'll unship this\r\nladder and you can unfasten the front of the stall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what happens to me?\" objected Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can make a bolt to the fore end of the hold and stay there\r\ntill Terence and I haul the brute on deck.  Then we'll re-ship the\r\nladder and you can get out.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton had his doubts, but he followed his companion's counsel.\r\nDirectly there was a strain on the lasso, he threw open the door of the\r\nstall and rushed for the shelter of the sheep-pen.\r\n\r\nBellowing lustily, and contesting every inch of the way, the animal was\r\nslowly dragged towards the hatch, to the accompaniment of a lusty\r\n\"Heave-ho!\" from the two youths on deck.\r\n\r\nTerence watched the operation with considerable misgiving, expecting\r\nevery moment to see the rope part and to find himself confronted by the\r\ninfuriated brute.\r\n\r\nSlowly the animal was forced across the floor of the hold, then its\r\nponderous carcase rose, kicking and plunging, in the air.\r\n\r\nAs the animal appeared above the coaming, the light of day\r\nrevealed--not a mild ox, but an unusually sturdy specimen of an\r\nAndalusian bull!\r\n\r\n\"Belay there, and lower away the after guy!\" shouted Andy, \"or he'll\r\ndrop down the hatch again when we let go.\"\r\n\r\nTerence hastened to obey; but, allowing the sheers to incline too far\r\nforward, the infuriated animal's legs touched the deck.\r\n\r\nInstantly the brute made a wild rush, the lassoo parted like pack\r\nthread, and the next moment Terence and Andy were flying for their\r\nlives, while Ellerton, a prisoner in the hold, heard the thunder of the\r\nanimal's hoofs and its triumphant bellowing as it revelled in its\r\nnew-found freedom.\r\n\r\nAndy made a desperate rush aft, but finding the bull close to his\r\nheels, gripped a rope hanging from the boat booms, and swung himself\r\ninto a position of comparative safety upon one of the narrow timbers,\r\nhis upward flight being assisted a little too well by the obliging\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDY, FINDING THE BULL CLOSE TO HIS HEELS, GRIPPED A\r\nROPE AND SWUNG HIMSELF INTO A POSITION OF COMPARATIVE SAFETY]\r\n\r\nNever did matador execute a more rapid leap over the barrier than did\r\nAndy on this occasion.  Terence, finding that he was not pursued, took\r\na more leisurely step, and hoisted himself into the main shrouds, where\r\nhe would be quite safe from any further onslaught of the animal.\r\n\r\nFor a while the bull eyed the fugitives with undisguised\r\ndisappointment, then spying the heap of bedding and clothing on the\r\ndeck, it lowered its head and rushed headlong to the attack.\r\n\r\nBoth lads watched the proceedings, powerless to prevent the\r\ncatastrophe, and indulging in vain regrets that their firearms were not\r\navailable, as beds, blankets, and suits of useful clothing were tossed\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nAt length a heavy blanket became impaled upon the brute's horns, the\r\nfolds falling over its eyes.\r\n\r\nIn vain the bull strove to toss aside the fabric; then, rushing along\r\nthe deck, it collided with ventilators, hatchways, and other obstacles,\r\neach obstruction increasing its anger.  Wheeling suddenly, the bull\r\ndarted through the entry port and vanished over the ship's side.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the boat!  The boat will be smashed to firewood,\" shouted Andy,\r\nsliding down from his perch.\r\n\r\nTerence had joined him, and, heedless of Ellerton's voice shouting to\r\nbe released from his prison, the two lads rushed to the side of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe animal had fallen upon one of the thwarts of the boat, breaking it\r\ncompletely in half, and was lying on the bottom-boards plunging wildly.\r\nOne kick in a vital place and the boat would be holed.\r\n\r\n\"There's enough damage done already,\" muttered Andy.  \"It's the only\r\nway,\" and running aft he returned in a moment with a loaded rifle.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to manage it?\" asked Terence.  \"You'll do almost as\r\nmuch damage to the boat with the bullet----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" growled Andy, and, snapping the safety catch of the weapon,\r\nhe swung himself without further delay into the stern sheets of the\r\ncutter.\r\n\r\nThe bull tried to rise, but in vain.  Its head reared itself slightly\r\nabove the gunwale; the rifle cracked.\r\n\r\n\"There's fresh beef at least, Terence.  Throw Hoppy the tail end of a\r\nrope and get him out of that hole.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Ellerton appeared, blinking in the strong sunshine, Andy\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Throw those things into the boat, and look sharp.  We've wasted enough\r\ntime and precious cargo this morning--all for the sake of that brute.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time the boat was being rowed shoreward, Andy--usually so\r\ngenial and even-tempered--preserved an almost sullen silence; while\r\nEllerton, annoyed at having failed to bring the bull ashore alive, was\r\nalso ill at ease.  Nor did the latter guess the cause of his friend's\r\nglumness till some days later, when he observed Andy repairing a rent\r\nin one of his garments.  Even a graze from an infuriated bull is likely\r\nto cause discomfort, he thought, though there is no reason why others\r\nshould suffer for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE EMBLEM OF EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\"You've been a long time,\" remarked Mr. McKay, as the three youths made\r\ntheir appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" admitted Terence, \"I'm afraid we have; but we must blame Hoppy's\r\nbull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoppy's bull?\" asked Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the ox turned out to be a bull--and a tough customer he was,\"\r\nreplied Terence, who then proceeded to give Mr. McKay a graphic\r\ndescription of how they had tried to unload the bull from the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"And how do you feel to-day?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Considerably better,\" replied the injured man.\r\n\r\n\"You've been moved,\" declared Andy, pointing to some marks in the grass.\r\n\r\n\"I plead guilty,\" replied his father with a smile.  \"Quexo dragged my\r\ncouch out in the sunshine.  I wanted to take an observation at midday.\r\nJust hand me that chart.  I've pricked our position.  Here it is.\r\nReduced to English degrees the latitude is 21 deg. 4' 15\" S. and the\r\nlongitude 134 deg. 17' 14\" W. of Greenwich.  As I suspected, we are on the\r\nfringe of the Low Archipelago, well away from the Great Circle route\r\nbetween Panama and New Zealand, and equally remote from the regular\r\ntracks between the Sandwich Islands and Cape Horn.  That means that\r\nunless a whaler or stray trading vessel puts in here, or that we make\r\nthe cutter seaworthy enough for a thousand-mile voyage, our stay here\r\nis likely to be indefinitely prolonged.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't mind,\" observed Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, if only my people knew we were safe,\" added Terence, and\r\nEllerton expressed himself in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't the heat oppressive?\" said Andy.  \"It's like an oven here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented his father.  \"I can see we've made a mistake in\r\nchoosing this spot.  It's splendidly sheltered--too much so--for what\r\nwith the rocks behind us and the palm groves on either side, the air\r\ncannot circulate.  We must find a more open spot on the next terrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no reason why we shouldn't have two camps--one for stormy\r\nweather and the other for the dry season,\" replied Andy.  \"Once we've\r\nfinished with the wreck we can set to and build a more substantial\r\nhome.  But what do you say?  Hadn't we better unload the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm game,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"What did you bring ashore?\" asked Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly provisions, bedding, and clothing, though that beastly bull\r\ntossed a lot of stuff overboard.  We've also brought the rest of the\r\nnavigation instruments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you making another trip to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" replied Ellerton.  \"I shall not be satisfied till those\r\npoor sheep are safely ashore.  By the by, Andy, you might tell Quexo to\r\nbuild a fence between the rock and the edge of this terrace.  It won't\r\ntake long, and it will inclose enough pasture land to feed the sheep\r\nfor some time to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell him directly we've had lunch; but come on, unloading the\r\nboat will take all our spare time before lunch, and we mustn't work too\r\nhard in this broiling sun.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the cutter's cargo was brought up to the camp Quexo had\r\nprepared the meal.  This over, the inhabitants of the Nameless Island\r\nindulged in a siesta till the sun was sufficiently low in the heavens\r\nto enable them to resume work.\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget to bring some lamps ashore,\" said Mr. McKay, as the three\r\nlads prepared to set off to the wreck.  \"And a bundle of signal flags,\r\nwhile you are about it.\"\r\n\r\nThis time the salvage operations were uninterrupted.  The sheep,\r\nsecurely trussed up, were placed in the boat, while the bunting, lamps,\r\na portable galley, and a set of blacksmith's tools, including a bellows\r\nand anvil, were also lowered into the cutter without mishap.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get the hatch off and see what is in the forehold,\" suggested\r\nEllerton.\r\n\r\nThe hold was full of water, as the lads had expected, but a hasty\r\nexamination showed that the part of the cargo nearest the opening was\r\ncomposed of several sheets of galvanised corrugated iron.\r\n\r\n\"This is fortunate,\" exclaimed Andy.  \"We'll be able to knock up a\r\ndecent house.  But what's that I can see for'ard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like farming implements,\" suggested Terence.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong,\" replied Andy.  \"I know; it's what the Americans term a\r\nrunabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"A runabout--otherwise a motor-car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy a motor-car on the Nameless Island!\" exclaimed Terence, and the\r\nlads burst into a fit of hearty laughter at the incongruous idea.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have it ashore in time,\" observed Andy.  \"It will come in\r\nuseful.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind how.  I have an idea, and, all being well, I'll fix it up\r\nto a good purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we try and find the bill of lading and the charter-party; they\r\nwill give us some idea of the nature of the cargo.\"\r\n\r\nA search revealed the required documents, but, being in Spanish, the\r\napprentice could make no meaning to the text.\r\n\r\n\"Snakes!\" ejaculated Andy.  \"There's enough to set us up as universal\r\nproviders!  Woollen and cotton goods, boots and leggings, hardware of\r\nAmerican manufacture, nine cases of rifles--for some blooming\r\ninsurgents more than likely--30,000 rounds of ammunition, and--hullo,\r\nthis looks dangerous!--two tons of dynamite; building and railroad\r\nmaterials, agricultural implements, and one petrol-driven runabout,\r\nconsigned to Monsieur Georges Lacroix, Grand Bassin, Tahiti.  Well, I'm\r\nafraid Monsieur Georges Lacroix will have to wait for his motor-car!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, we are lucky!\" ejaculated Ellerton.  \"That is, provided we\r\nget the stuff ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do it,\" replied his chum resolutely.  \"Only give us time and\r\ngood weather, and we'll leave precious little on the _San Martin_, I\r\ncan assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time to be off,\" exclaimed Terence.  \"It will be dark in an hour.\"\r\n\r\nSo, thrusting the documents into his belt, Andy dropped over the side,\r\nand received the rest of the articles that the lads had collected.\r\nThen, well laden, the boat returned to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"We've much to be thankful for,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, after he had\r\nperused the ship's papers.  \"There is, I think, no need for anxiety as\r\nto our future.  You brought the signal flags, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ellerton, \"and a couple of Peruvian ensigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!  I'm going to make up a Union Jack.  There are two reasons for\r\ndoing so.  The first is that it can be used as a means of attracting\r\npassing vessels; the second, and more important to my mind, is that it\r\nsignifies that the island becomes part of the British Empire.  I've\r\nbeen going into the question pretty deeply.  You may be aware that the\r\nLow Archipelago belongs to France.  These islands consists of a number\r\nof flat coral islands, hence their name.  Now, as this island is lofty\r\nand of volcanic origin, I cannot see that it can be classed as\r\nbelonging to the Low Archipelago, even though it is not far distant\r\nfrom that group.  Neither does it appear to have been inhabited, so we\r\nmay be pretty safe in claiming it.  Terence, there's a pencil and paper\r\nclose to your elbow; will you please sketch a plan of a Union Jack?\"\r\n\r\nTerence did so, but the result was not to Mr. McKay's satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"You try, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nNor was Andy's attempt any more satisfactory, so Ellerton was put to\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\n\"Shame on you, lads!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay reproachfully.  \"Three\r\nmembers of the good old British Empire, and unable to draw its national\r\nensign correctly.  Here, hand me that pencil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now do you see,\" he continued, after he had explained the various\r\nminute particulars of the flag.  \"There's a broad white diagonal above\r\nthe two portions of St. Patrick's cross next to the pole, and a broad\r\nwhite diagonal below the two portions farthest from the pole.  If the\r\nflag is hoisted in any manner but the correct the ensign becomes a\r\nsignal of distress.  Often in bygone days hostile ships have attempted\r\nto sail under British colours, and in nine cases out of ten their\r\nignorance of its peculiarities has led to their undoing.  However,\r\nwe'll postpone the cutting out till the rest of the boat's cargo is\r\nbrought up.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Quexo getting on?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"He's been away the whole afternoon.  I guess your fence is nearly\r\ncompleted by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go and see how he is progressing,\" remarked the apprentice.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto had indeed made rapid strides, for only a few feet more\r\nremained to be done, so Ellerton returned to the boat to liberate the\r\nsheep.  Ere nightfall the pen was tenanted by a score of animals,\r\nfrisking with enjoyment at finding themselves once more in pasture.\r\n\r\nThat evening three large lamps contributed to the comfort of the tent.\r\nThe lads, tired out with their exertions, were \"taking things easy,\"\r\nlamenting the fact that there was no literature to beguile the time.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, having been raised to a sitting position, called for the\r\nbunting.  Laboriously he threaded a needle and commenced his lengthy\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, sir,\" exclaimed Ellerton.  \"Wouldn't a sewing machine be\r\nbetter?\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?  Bless the lad!  Where's a machine to be had?\"\r\n\r\n\"On board, sir.  I noticed a couple in the fo'c'sle.  You see, a seaman\r\nhas to make his own duds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I'll put off the job till to-morrow, if you'll remember to\r\nbring one of the things ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any need to keep watch to-night, pater?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be advisable till we've explored the island.  Not\r\nthat I anticipate any interference, but forewarned is forearmed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay's words proved to be correct.  Nothing occurred to disturb\r\nthe camp during the second night ashore.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that Terence and you can manage by yourselves?\" asked Mr.\r\nMcKay during breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Then Andy can take Quexo and make an exploration of the interior.  I\r\nparticularly want him to reach the summit of the hill, so as to find\r\nout if there are other islands in the vicinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand, Andy?\" continued his father.  \"Keep a sharp look-out\r\nfor signs of past or present inhabitants, any animals you may come\r\nacross--there may be a few pigs--and, above all, note the general\r\nextent of the island and the position of its neighbours, if visible.\r\nDon't overburden yourselves; a revolver and twenty rounds apiece, a\r\nwater-bottle, and some provisions will be quite enough to carry.  Rest\r\non the summit of the hill during the heat of the day, and get back here\r\nwell before sunset.\"\r\n\r\nHaving seen the explorers on their way, Ellerton and Donaghue pushed\r\noff the cutter and rowed to the wreck.\r\n\r\nIt was again an ideal morning, and without the faintest hitch the boat\r\nwas made fast alongside the battered hull of the _San Martin_.\r\n\r\n\"I've a mind to try and patch up that gig,\" remarked Ellerton, gazing\r\nat the battered boat.\r\n\r\n\"Take too much time,\" was Terence's reply.\r\n\r\n\"No, I mean to fasten some painted canvas over the hole and nail some\r\ncopper sheathing outside the canvas to protect it.  It won't be a long\r\njob, so meanwhile you might clear all the light gear out of the cabins\r\nand saloon.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours sufficed to effect the temporary repairs, and the gig on\r\nbeing launched let in very little water.  Ellerton was overjoyed with\r\nhis success.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take a double load ashore, Terence,\" he exclaimed.  \"We may as\r\nwell make a start by clearing the for'ard hold.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Ellerton began to strip off his clothing.  He was an expert\r\nswimmer and diver, and these qualifications stood him in good stead.\r\n\r\nTaking a strong hook attached to a rope in his hand, he dived from the\r\ncoaming of the hatchway.  The top of the stacks of galvanised iron was\r\nbut a few feet below the surface, and in a few seconds the hook was\r\naffixed to the wire rope that held the plates together.\r\n\r\nThen, regaining the deck, the apprentice assisted his companion in\r\nhauling their booty out of the hold.\r\n\r\nSix times the operation was repeated, till the deck resembled a \"tin\"\r\ncity in the western plains of Arizona.\r\n\r\n\"It takes it out of you,\" remarked Ellerton.  \"I wish we could get rid\r\nof the water in the hold; though I'm afraid the vessel's too badly\r\nstrained to be able to patch up her sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even then we would have a bother to get rid of the water,\" replied\r\nTerence.  \"Still, we've done very well up to now.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's all that railway line material underneath the iron sheeting;\r\nthat will want some shifting.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do it some time, but now we'll get off home.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed natural for the lads to talk of the camp as \"home,\" for\r\nalready they were becoming attached to the free, yet none the less\r\ncomfortable, manner of living.\r\n\r\n\"Wait while I get the sewing machine from the fo'c'sle.  But you may as\r\nwell come, too, and we'll take both of them.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, Ellerton, accompanied by Terence, made his way for'ard.  In\r\nthe gloom of the stuffy fo'c'sle, the sight of which forcibly reminded\r\nhim of his quarters on the _Tophet_, Ellerton found the required\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, here's a find!\" he exclaimed, holding up a concertina.\r\n\r\n\"Sling the blessed thing overboard,\" replied Terence laughing.  \"If you\r\ntake it ashore it's bound to make trouble in the camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may come in handy.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton looked upon everything as being likely \"to come in handy.\"  He\r\nwould have overstocked the island with useless things in the hope that\r\nthey might be of use at some distant date.  In this case, did he but\r\nknow it, the concertina was fated to play a most useful part.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" assented Terence good-humouredly.  \"To look at us\r\nnow one would think we were going to run old women's sewing meetings\r\nand popular Saturday night concerts.\"\r\n\r\nWith the gig in tow, the lads returned to the shore, putting off the\r\nunloading of their boat till the evening, though they brought the\r\nsewing machines with them to the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Now I can get on,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.  \"It's slow work lying here\r\nand unable to do a decent bit of hard work.\"\r\n\r\nLunch, followed by the customary siesta, occupied the rest of the\r\nafternoon.  By the aid of a telescope Andy and Quexo had been seen on\r\nthe summit of the hill, and their descent followed till an intervening\r\nspur hid them from sight.  Mr. McKay calculated that they would be home\r\nwithin a couple of hours.\r\n\r\n\"You might cut down a suitable palm tree--one about forty feet in\r\nheight--Terence,\" he added.  \"I should like to have the flag flying on\r\ntheir return.\"\r\n\r\nThe tree was easily felled, and a small block, with signal halliards\r\nrove, was fastened to its smaller end.  This done, a hole was dug to\r\nreceive the pole, and by the aid of a pair of guys the flagstaff was\r\nerected and set up in quite a professional style.\r\n\r\nAbout five in the afternoon Andy and the mulatto returned.  They\r\nreported that from the summit of the hill the island appeared to be\r\nnearly circular, without any noticeable bays that might serve as boat\r\nharbours.\r\n\r\nThe reef extended completely around the island, approaching it closely\r\non the southern side, while there were three well-defined entrances\r\nbesides the one they already knew about.\r\n\r\nAndy reckoned that the extreme length of the island was about seven\r\nmiles, its breadth barely a mile less.  There were no other islands\r\nvisible, but as the sea was hazy away on the north-west it was possible\r\nthat land might lie in that direction.\r\n\r\n\"Then, assuming the altitude to be one thousand feet, your horizon\r\nwould be approximately forty-two miles off,\" remarked Mr. McKay.\r\n\"Well, in that case we are not likely to be troubled by our neighbours,\r\nfor the nearest island cannot be less than fifty miles away.  Did you\r\nfind any signs of the island having been inhabited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Andy, \"we found this,\" and opening a leather sling case\r\nhe produced a pistol.  It was a quaint specimen of a flint-lock weapon,\r\nits large-bore barrel eaten with rust and its silver-mounted walnut\r\nstock pitted and rotted by exposure.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the gentleman who dropped this article is in a fit state\r\nto call upon us,\" observed Mr. McKay.  \"Nevertheless, it shows that we\r\nare not the first civilised people to set foot on the island.  What is\r\nthe interior like?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are distinct signs of a volcano about.  The top of the hill is\r\nmost certainly an extinct volcano, while the base is honeycombed with\r\nfissures like the volcano of Monotombo.  Otherwise the island is well\r\nwooded.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done well,\" commented Mr. McKay.  \"Now it's nearly sunset, so\r\nthere will be just time to hoist the Union Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finished it, then, pater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!  Now, Andy, you hoist the emblem of empire!\"\r\n\r\nAmid the cheers of the band of Britishers the ensign was broken at the\r\nmasthead.  For a few minutes it fluttered idly in the breeze, then, as\r\nthe sun sank beneath the horizon, the Jack was slowly lowered.\r\n\r\nThey had asserted the King's authority over the island to which they\r\nhad now given the name of McKay's Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\"A SAIL!\"\r\n\r\nFor the next five months things went smoothly at McKay's Island.\r\n\r\nTaking every advantage of the remaining period of the dry season, the\r\nlads worked hard.  Almost everything of value was removed from the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nThe heavy lengths of railway lines were safely transported to the\r\nshore; the motor-car, its mechanism not altogether useless, was stored\r\nunder a canvas canopy on the lower terrace.\r\n\r\nThe ship's dynamos were removed, as well as the lighter portion of the\r\nmain propelling machinery, while the remaining derricks, practically\r\nthe whole of the wire rigging, and all the woodwork that could be taken\r\naway, had found a safe storage-place on McKay's Island.\r\n\r\nMost of the dynamite had been cautiously conveyed ashore and placed in\r\nsome of the numerous caves at a safe distance from the camp.  The\r\nremainder of the explosive had been judiciously used--under Andy's\r\ndirection, for his experiences at San Eugenio had not been thrown\r\naway--in demolishing those portions of the wreck that prevented easy\r\naccess to the precious cargo.\r\n\r\nOnly the bare hull of the _San Martin_ now remained.  No doubt the\r\nfirst on-shore hurricane would sweep away every vestige of the\r\nill-fated vessel, but the castaways were satisfied with the knowledge\r\nthat nothing of value remained on board.\r\n\r\nNor had the work ashore been delayed.  Already a substantial\r\nthree-roomed building of galvanised iron reared itself proudly upon the\r\nsecond terrace.  Its furniture--the best that the state-rooms and\r\ncabins of the _San Martin_ could provide--would have made many a\r\nstay-at-home Englishman green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe lads had contrived to lay a double set of rails from the shore up\r\nthe steep path to the lower terrace.  Then, by means of a steel hawser\r\nattached to two sets of trucks, they were able to draw the bulk of\r\ntheir goods to the higher level with little difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe mode of locomotion, thanks to Andy's ready skill, was comparatively\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nAt first Terence wished to utilise the motor of the \"runabout\"; but to\r\nthis proposal Andy objected, having another purpose in view for the\r\nundelivered consignment for Monsieur Georges Lacroix.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the rolling stock were several iron tip waggons, of the\r\nkind generally in use in mining districts.  Two of these Andy attached\r\nto each of his \"trains.\"  Those on the upper level he filled with\r\nearth, till the weight, being greater than the other set of waggons,\r\ncaused the former to descend the incline, and at the same time raise\r\nthe trucks filled with cargo from the beach.\r\n\r\nThis plan acted very well, but the labour in filling the trucks with\r\nsoil was tedious; so Andy conceived the brilliant idea of trapping some\r\nof the water from the little stream, and conveying it by means of a\r\nlength of iron pipe supported on trestles into the empty tip waggons.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the \"McKay's Island Express\" was in full working\r\norder, and the task of hauling the salved cargo up the terrace became a\r\nmatter of comparative ease.\r\n\r\nThose five months had worked wonders in Mr. McKay.  Though weak on his\r\nfeet, he was able to walk, and showed promise of soon throwing off all\r\nill-effects of his double misfortune.\r\n\r\nAs a natural result of his prolonged convalescence he had grown stout.\r\nThis was a source of worry to him, and he longed to be able to get\r\nabout again as usual.\r\n\r\nAmongst their many undertakings, the lads found time to make use of the\r\nremains of the disabled gig.\r\n\r\nRealising that the work of replacing the garboards and keel would not\r\nrepay the amount of labour expended on the work, they cut the boat in\r\ntwo, and built transoms to each of the sound ends.  Thus they possessed\r\ntwo light craft, each about ten feet in length, and easy to haul up and\r\ndown the beach.\r\n\r\nWhen occasion served, they could also bolt the two transoms together,\r\nand thus form one boat, resembling the original gig with a slice of her\r\n'midship section missing.\r\n\r\nThe craft proved of great service while the cutter was under\r\nreconstruction.  This was a big task, for not only had the lads given\r\nher a fairly deep keel, to make her more seaworthy, but a cabin,\r\nwater-tight well, and decked fo'c'sle were added.  The rig was altered\r\nto that of a yawl, while Andy hoped at an early date to instal the\r\nmotor in her.\r\n\r\nHitherto his difficulties lay in the fact that the motor was not water\r\ncooled, nor was it adapted to consume kerosene.  They had a plentiful\r\nsupply of that fuel, but of petrol they had none.  Nevertheless, Andy\r\nhad firm faith in his capabilities, and trusted to overcome these\r\ndifficulties all right.\r\n\r\nIn this craft the hopes of the inhabitants of McKay's Island were\r\ncentred.  Although happy in their little domain, for plenty of work had\r\nproved the greatest factor to their well-being, they yearned at times\r\nfor the society of their fellow-men and civilisation.\r\n\r\nDirectly the rainy season was over the little party meant to try their\r\nfate upon the broad Pacific.  It was to be a risky voyage, but others\r\nhad done similar passages under worse conditions.  Blythe, of H.M.S.\r\n_Bounty_, for instance, did he not successfully accomplish a voyage of\r\n4000 miles in an open boat in forty-one days?\r\n\r\nThe advent of the rainy season was heralded by a hurricane of terrific\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nGiving but little warning, the storm swept over the island, uprooting\r\ntrees and turning the tiny rivulets into foaming torrents.  The usually\r\nplacid surface of the lagoon became a seething cauldron, huge breakers\r\nsweeping completely over the reef and lashing themselves upon the\r\nrock-strewn beach.\r\n\r\nWell it was that the lads had hauled their craft above the reach of\r\nthose breakers, for on the morning following the commencement of the\r\nstorm not a vestige of the hull of the _San Martin_ was to be seen.\r\n\r\nFortunately the house was solidly constructed.  The hail pelted on the\r\niron roof, the windows rattled and the doors shook to such an extent\r\nthat it became necessary to barricade them, while almost incessantly\r\nthe lightning flashed and the thunder rolled in deafening peals.\r\n\r\nWhile the rains lasted there was very little outside work done.\r\nWelcome as were the showers at first, they soon became monotonous.  It\r\nwas too hot to wear oilskins, the ground was too soft to walk on\r\nwithout sinking ankle deep in mire, so that the castaways were thrown\r\nupon their own resources to pass the time as well as they were able\r\nwithin doors.\r\n\r\nLack of books had been their greatest discomfort, even the study of the\r\nSpanish charts and treatises on navigation became a pleasure; paper and\r\nwriting materials they possessed, and Mr. McKay systematically wrote up\r\nhis diary.\r\n\r\nBut the task that gave the lads the greatest pleasure and amusement was\r\ntheir efforts to teach Quexo English.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto was a willing though difficult pupil, and was doubly\r\nhandicapped by being unable to write even his own language.\r\nNevertheless, before the rainy season was over, Quexo could understand\r\nmost of what was said to him, and was able to reply in weird sentences\r\nand phrases that often set the lads laughing.\r\n\r\nAt length the \"off season\"--as Terence termed it--passed, its departure\r\nbeing marked by almost as severe a hurricane as the one that preceded\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen for three days and nights a thick mist overspread the island.  The\r\nair resembled that of a hothouse, without the least suspicion of a\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day the sun shone in an unclouded sky, the\r\nmud disappeared as if by the touch of a magic wand, and the inhabitants\r\nof McKay's Island awoke to their life of outdoor activity.\r\n\r\n\"I think we will do well to postpone the time of our departure for\r\nanother month,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"We shall then have more chance of\r\na wind, and the zone of the Trades will extend farther north by then.\r\nWe shall have plenty to see, too, in a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to get the motor fixed up,\" observed Andy.  \"I think my plan\r\nfor making a water-jacket will succeed, and installing the engine and\r\ntuning it up will take quite a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you succeed the motor will prove invaluable, especially if we lose\r\nthe benefit of the Trades,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\nAndy was hard at work making a propeller.  This he did by means of two\r\nsheets of steel plating riveted to an iron boss; for, in order to\r\nprevent the boat from being unduly kept back while under sail alone, he\r\nhad decided to have but two blades, which when at rest were up and\r\ndown, in line with the boat's stern-post.\r\n\r\nTerence, who was also of an engineering turn of mind, had embarked upon\r\na somewhat ambitious programme.  He meant to use the dynamo for\r\nlighting purposes.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected Ellerton, \"what's the use?  We are leaving the island\r\nshortly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but I am looking beyond then, Hoppy.  Provided I could be\r\nsure of a passage to 'Frisco occasionally I would not mind settling\r\ndown here.  No doubt I am indulging in wild day-dreams, but still, my\r\nplans may mature, and there's a living to be made out of the island.\r\nBut to deal with present events; the dynamo will be of great service to\r\nus, as we can recharge those accumulators we brought ashore.  Then Andy\r\nwill be able to use electrical ignition for his motor instead of the\r\nslower and more uncertain lamp ignition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, Terence,\" assented Andy.  \"So carry on, my boy.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Terence, assisted by Ellerton and Quexo, dug a deep\r\ntrench close to the brink of the lower terrace, the side of which he\r\nlined with thick planks from the wreck.\r\n\r\nNext a water-wheel, twelve feet in diameter, was constructed, the\r\npaddle floats being cut from the iron plates obtained from the same\r\nsource.  A portion of the ship's piston rods formed the axle of the\r\nwheel, a grooved drum being attached to take the driving belt of the\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\nAt length came the critical test of Terence's work.  The stream, once\r\nmore diverted, was conducted into the trench, and as the last barrier\r\nto its progress was removed the water rushed through its new channel.\r\nThen, with a cascade of silver splashing from its floats, the wheel\r\nbegan to gather way, and was soon spinning merrily.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very fine,\" exclaimed Andy, who had left his work to view\r\nthe opening ceremony of the McKay Island Power Company.  \"But how are\r\nyou going to stop the wheel?  It will soon wear its axle out at that\r\nrate; and, besides, we can't have that noise day and night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never thought of that!\" replied Terence.  \"We must make a hatch to\r\ntrap the water when we don't require the power.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later the dynamo was in full working order.  The lads were\r\nhighly delighted, and suggested several schemes for making use of the\r\nelectric current.\r\n\r\nThen came Andy's triumph.  After many difficulties and failures he\r\nsucceeded in duly installing the motor in the yawl, and on a trial trip\r\ninside the lagoon the boat behaved magnificently under power.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a trip round the island to-morrow,\" he exclaimed, as the\r\ncraft was moored for the night.  \"Let's turn in early so as to make a\r\nstart immediately after sunrise.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned bright and calm, with no wind.\r\n\r\n\"It will mean running under power,\" observed Andy, as the lads, laden\r\nwith provisions and tins of kerosene, wended their way to the shore.\r\n\"I mean to----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, his eyes fixed seaward.\r\n\r\nHis companions followed his gaze, and simultaneously there was a shout\r\nof:\r\n\r\n\"A sail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nUNWELCOME VISITORS\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!  It's a native canoe,\" declared Mr. McKay.  \"And she's\r\nheading straight for the island!\"\r\n\r\nThe craft was some little distance from the entrance to the reef, her\r\nhuge brown sail hanging idly from its yard, while the crew vigorously\r\nplied their paddles as they made the water fly from her sharp prow.\r\n\r\n\"Trouble in store?\" queried Andy.\r\n\r\n\"It's well to be prepared,\" replied his father.  \"I know these natives\r\nof old.  Sometimes they are quiet and inoffensive, at another time they\r\nare bold and war-like, or, what is worse, extremely treacherous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must arm ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly.  Quexo, bring my glass.\"\r\n\r\nThe mulatto darted off, and presently reappeared, bringing a glass of\r\nlime-juice.\r\n\r\n\"Not that, you ass!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, laughing.\r\n\"Glass--telescope--see?\" and he raised his hands to imitate the\r\noperation of using a telescope.  \"I'll have the drink, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Quexo ran to the house, this time bringing back the required\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"There are at least forty natives,\" said Mr. McKay, after a lengthy\r\nexamination of the oncoming craft.  \"They may be armed.  If so, their\r\nweapons are lying on the bottom of the canoe.  But unless I am very\r\nmuch mistaken, there's a white man aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prisoner?  Let me have a look, pater!\"\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness Andy almost snatched the telescope from his parent's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"A queer set of customers,\" he exclaimed; \"but I don't think the white\r\nman is a captive, for he's talking to a fellow with his hair frizzed up\r\na foot above his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've seen enough for the time being,\" rejoined Mr. McKay quietly, \"so\r\nwe'll return to the house and serve out the arms.  At the rate they are\r\ntravelling, the canoe will be here in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't injure the boat?\" asked Andy anxiously, for the yawl was\r\nalmost like a child to him.\r\n\r\n\"Not when they see us with rifles in our hands.  Whatever you do, don't\r\nlet them have reason to think we want to fight, and, above all, don't\r\nshow any signs of fear.\"\r\n\r\nThe party quickly strapped on their ammunition belts and revolver\r\nholsters, then, grasping their rifles, they hastened down to the beach.\r\n\r\nThe canoe had by this time entered the lagoon, and its occupants had\r\nperceived the house and the other buildings, for they had ceased\r\npaddling, and were gazing in wonder towards the shore.  Nor did the\r\nappearance of five armed men serve to set their minds at rest.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, there!\" shouted Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, there!\" was the reply.  \"What's your game?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's yours?\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"All square, governor.  Can we land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Provided you keep your people in order,\" replied Mr. McKay, then\r\nturning to his companions he exclaimed: \"By Jove!  I know that fellow;\r\nhe's no good, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I met him on a pearl-fisher in Torres Strait twenty odd years\r\nago.  He hasn't changed much in appearance, and I'm afraid his manners\r\nhaven't.  Still, I'll not claim acquaintanceship with him at present.\"\r\n\r\nThe paddles were resumed, and the canoe glided quietly to the shore.\r\nThe natives, for the most part stark naked, began to tumble over the\r\nside, some grasping enormous clubs studded with sharks' teeth, and\r\nothers long triple-barbed spears.\r\n\r\n\"Tell those fellows to throw those weapons back into the canoe,\"\r\nshouted Mr. McKay sternly.  \"Otherwise we'll not permit them to land.\"\r\n\r\nThe white man spoke a few words to the turban-haired native, who in\r\nturn uttered an order to his men.  Instantly the weapons were thrown\r\ninto the canoe with a loud clatter, and the natives, wading ashore,\r\nsecured their boat and proceeded to squat in a semicircle.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Blight--Jimmy Blight,\" exclaimed the stranger.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay merely nodded his head in reply.  He could not bring himself\r\nto say the words \"Pleased to see you,\" for the simple reason that he\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nJimmy Blight had had a chequered career.  He was a man of about fifty\r\nyears of age, some five feet eight inches in height, and of medium\r\nbuild.  Years of exposure to a tropical sun had not left any trace upon\r\nhis face, for his complexion was a chalky white.  He had a bristling,\r\ndark moustache; cut high over the lips, a scanty crop of dark hair, a\r\nthin, straight nose, rather deep-set eyes that were continually\r\nshifting in expression, while his hands, the broad nails of which were\r\nbitten to the quick, showed little trace of hard work.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. McKay first met him he was mate of a pearling vessel, and\r\nalready he bore a bad reputation as a hard drinker and a card-sharper,\r\nwhile it was well known that his tyranny had more than once caused\r\nbloodshed amongst the Kanaka crew of the vessel.  By his white\r\nassociates he was commonly known as \"Chinese Pork\"--in other words,\r\nsomething very unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can I do for you?\" asked Mr. McKay bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"The island's free, I guess?\" replied Blight, with a leer that\r\nill-concealed his natural aggressiveness.\r\n\r\n\"So long as you behave yourself; but should one of those men touch so\r\nmuch as a copper nail, we'll send you to the right about in double\r\nquick time.  Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, boss.  But how about a drink?  You seem fixed up pretty\r\ncomfortable here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have as much water as you want at the stream.  Beyond that,\r\nI'm afraid we cannot provide you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!  Must take pot-luck, I suppose.  Say, are you traders?\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay did not think it advisable to answer.\r\n\r\n\"What's your business, might I ask?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long story, boss.  You see my mates here\"--indicating the group\r\nof squatting natives--\"belong to the island of Ahii, which lies seventy\r\nmiles nor'west of here.  In fact, I was very comfortable along of 'em,\r\nbut might is right in these parts, I'll allow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chinese Pork\" paused to allow the weight of this sentence to take\r\neffect, but Mr. McKay betrayed no sign.\r\n\r\n\"So a few days ago a tribe of natives from Teku came and drove us out.\r\nThere was a fight, you bet, but our fellows got the worst of it.  So we\r\nhooked it, and took canoe to Ni Atong, which is less than twenty miles\r\nS.E. of Ahii.  Ni Atong's all very well, only it ain't big enough, so\r\nwe're trying to find a larger island to settle upon.  There's close on\r\na couple of hundred natives, and ten large canoes at Ni Atong.  Strikes\r\nme this place 'ud suit, 'specially with white gents like yourselves for\r\ncompany like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you must give up all idea of bringing your friends here,\r\nMr. Blight, or yourself either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we cannot permit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, boss,\" replied Blight with an impudent swagger.  \"How do\r\nyou think you'll stop two hundred natives if they set their minds on\r\nlanding here?  Even I couldn't stop 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them try,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Now, Mr. Blight, I cannot refuse\r\nyou hospitality.  Food will be sent down to you; then, when your men\r\nhave rested sufficiently, I must ask you to leave this island.\"\r\n\r\nAnd turning on his heel, Mr. McKay began to make his way back to the\r\nhouse, the lads following him closely.\r\n\r\nBefore he had taken a dozen steps the ex-pearler ran after him.\r\n\r\n\"See here, boss; I don't mean to give offence--no offence meant--but\r\nyou'll allow it's hard on a chap to be done out of his own crib by a\r\npack o' niggers.  And then you can't deny you've treated me\r\noff-handish, specially as you're the first white man I've seen these\r\ntwo years.  So let's come to terms.  I see you're well armed.  Why not\r\ncome back to Ahii with us, and make those chaps from Teku clear off\r\nback to their own island?  Then the Ahii people won't want to trouble\r\nyou.  See?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll consider the matter,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"By the by, do you ever\r\ngo to Tahiti?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not often, boss.  I was there two years ago.  When I've got a cargo of\r\ncopra ready I send it by a native boat.  Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely wanted to know, Mr. Blight.  But now I must be off.  I'll\r\nsend the provisions along shortly, and will give you a definite reply\r\nto your proposal in a few hours.  It seems to me that the easiest way\r\nout of the mess is to accept the fellow's advice,\" remarked Mr. McKay\r\nas they entered their house.  \"We certainly don't want to try\r\nconclusions with a horde of savages on this island.  No doubt we could\r\nbeat them off, but in any case there is a considerable amount of risk.\r\nIf I can get Blight to give me a guarantee--though I don't place much\r\nreliance on his word--backed by the chief's assurance that his men will\r\nnot trespass upon the island, I think we can very well help them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think there will be much of a struggle?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Between whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"The natives of Ahii and the natives who took possession of their\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; our presence will soon turn the scale, though we may not even have\r\nto use our firearms.  You can rely upon it that I'll do my best to\r\nprevent bloodshed.  Are you willing to go, lads?  If you have\r\nobjections don't hesitate to say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't,\" said Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" added the others.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then.  Quexo, take this keg of flour down to the beach, and\r\ntell that white man that his people can gather as much taro and\r\ncocoanuts as they want, so long as they don't cross to this side of the\r\nstream.  You understand?  Do you think we might spare Blight a lamb,\r\nAndy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, pater.  We've twenty at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell Quexo to take one down when he comes back.  Now, boys, if we\r\nare going on this trip, we had better make preparations.  We ought to\r\nstart by sunrise at least, if we want to reach Ahii before dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are we going straight to Ahii?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by Jove!  I forgot that for the moment.  Of course, it will be\r\nmuch better to spend the night off Ni Atong--I suppose there's a\r\nlagoon--and proceed to Ahii on the following morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Quexo,\" said Andy, on the mulatto's return, \"what did the white\r\nman say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He say: 'Come here you number one size blackamoor.  What your massa\r\nname is?'  An' I say: 'I no number one size blackamoor; I no niggah,\r\nsah; an' my massa name me no give, massa he tell you his name if you\r\nask.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a smart reply, Quexo,\" replied Mr. McKay, laughing.  \"There's\r\nnothing like keeping your master's counsel and your own.  Now take that\r\ncarcase down to the beach.  Ellerton, you might take a stroll along the\r\nedge of the cliff and, without attracting undue attention, keep an eye\r\non the rascals.  I don't want them straggling across the stream.\"\r\n\r\nThus bidden, Ellerton walked cautiously to the edge of the first\r\nterrace, then laying his rifle on the ground, stretched himself into a\r\ncomfortable position so that he could see without being seen, and hear\r\nwithout being heard.\r\n\r\nMost of the natives had dispersed, and were busily engaged in seeking\r\ntaro and cocoanuts, although they kept strictly within the bounds laid\r\ndown by Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nBlight, the chief, and a couple of natives had killed the lamb and were\r\nroasting it by the aboriginal method of caking it with clay and placing\r\nit in the red-hot embers of a fire.  Although the white man cast\r\nseveral curious glances at the cliff, above which the roof of the house\r\nwas just visible, he refrained from setting foot upon the path that led\r\nto Mr. McKay's settlement.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Mr. McKay went down to the beach and informed\r\nBlight that he had decided to lend his aid, at the same time\r\nstipulating that the natives must promise not to molest the inhabitants\r\nof McKay's Island.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the yawl's stores were then carried aboard, Andy and\r\nEllerton volunteering to keep watch on the boat while Mr. McKay,\r\nTerence, and Quexo took turns in patrolling the edge of the terrace.\r\n\r\nA tent, some blankets, and a few luxuries in the way of provisions were\r\nthen sent down to the ex-pearler, while the natives prepared to sleep\r\nunder the shelter of the palm trees and bushes.\r\n\r\n\"If you see or hear anything of a suspicious nature, Andy,\" cautioned\r\nMr. McKay, \"here is a signal rocket.  Don't use it except in\r\ncircumstances that warrant our interference.  You have plenty of\r\nammunition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy rounds of rifle ammunition and fifty revolver cartridges each.\r\nYou'll see that another box of ammunition comes off in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" replied his father.  \"Now I think everything is ready to\r\nmake an early start, so you had better be off.\"\r\n\r\nThen, having bade the rest of the party good night, Andy and his trusty\r\ncompanion descended to the beach, passed between knots of curious\r\nnatives, and embarked in the yawl's tender.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later they were on board, and the ammunition stowed away\r\nwithin easy reach.\r\n\r\nThe lads had made an excellent job in converting the ship's cutter.\r\nFrom the awning-covered well a short ladder led to the cabin.  Here\r\nfour roomy folding bunks, a swing table, plenty of lockers and racks\r\nhad been fitted, while the linoleum-covered floor, the red baize\r\ncurtains, and the polished brass lamp imparted an air of comfort.\r\nOverhead a skylight served to admit both fresh air and light.\r\n\r\nIn the fo'c'sle, to which access could be obtained either by sliding\r\ndoors between it and the cabin, or through a hatch on deck, were the\r\nsails, spare ropes, anchor cable, and a small stove constructed from\r\none of the galleys of the _San Martin_.\r\n\r\nThe motor had been installed under the floor of the well, while on the\r\nafterside of the cabin bulkhead was fixed a boat's compass, illuminated\r\nby means of the cabin lamp, so that the steersman could keep a course\r\nwith comfort, whether by day or night.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hoppy, I'll take the first watch,\" remarked Andy, as the sun sank\r\nbeneath the lofty peak of McKay's Island.  \"I'll turn you out at two in\r\nthe morning, and then you can carry on till daybreak, if that will suit\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Righto!\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\nAnd turning in upon his bunk he was soon fast asleep, lulled by the\r\nslight motion of the little craft as she rose and fell to the gentle\r\nheave of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ALLIES\r\n\r\n\"Turn out, Hoppy!\"\r\n\r\nEllerton was awake in an instant, but forgetting that the cabin of a\r\nsmall craft does not possess unlimited headroom, he sat up and brought\r\nhis head violently in contact with the deck beams.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he exclaimed, grasping his revolver.  \"Anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Andy.  \"Only it's two o'clock, and your watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness!  I feel as if I've only been asleep five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for you, then, old chap, for you've got to keep awake five\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Andy slid into his bunk, and within a minute his regular\r\nbreathing showed that he was asleep.\r\n\r\nEllerton took up his position under the shelter of the dew-sodden\r\nawning.  Everything was quiet, save for the occasional splash of a fish\r\nas it played upon the surface of the placid water, and the ever-present\r\nrumble of the breakers upon the distant reef.\r\n\r\nShorewards the outline of the island was dimly visible against the loom\r\nof the starlit sky, while a light from the seaward window of the house\r\nand the dull red gleam of the dying embers of the fire the natives had\r\nkindled were the only sign of human occupation.\r\n\r\nYet, Ellerton reflected, the bush might be alive with savages, awaiting\r\nthe opportunity to fall upon the settlement, murder his friends, and\r\npossess themselves of the valuable stores.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the story of the seizure of Ahii and the flight of the\r\ninhabitants to Ni Atong was a myth, invented by that rogue Blight for\r\nthe purpose of luring the castaways into a false position.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt about it, Ellerton's nerves were \"jumpy.\"\r\nPerhaps it was that the suddenness of coming into contact with human\r\nbeings other than his comrades had acted upon his nerves.\r\n\r\nEllerton realised that he was entering into a new phase of his\r\nexistence.  He regretted it, for, beyond his natural anxiety concerning\r\nhis parents, he had grown to love the isolated life on McKay's Island.\r\n\r\nThen, should Blight's story prove to be correct, Ellerton felt sure\r\nthat Mr. McKay's action was the only course permissible.  The little\r\ncolony was to fight for its existence, and the more remote the scene of\r\nhostilities the better chance they had of securing the sole\r\nproprietorship of the island.\r\n\r\nHist!  A succession of faint sounds like those of a man stealthily\r\nswimming caused Ellerton to sit bolt upright, grasp his rifle, and peer\r\nintently through the darkness.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistake about it.  It was some object heading directly for\r\nthe yawl, its track being marked by a faint blur of phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nVisions of bloodthirsty savages, swimming, knife in mouth, to surprise\r\nthe crew of the little craft, filled Ellerton with alarm.  He raised\r\nhis rifle, released the safety catch, and took aim at the mysterious\r\nintruder.\r\n\r\n\"Andy,\" he whispered, but his friend was too deep in slumber to be\r\nawakened by a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait till he's close alongside,\" muttered Ellerton, fingering the\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a perceptible jar alongside the boat, followed\r\nby a prolonged grating sound, as if a piece of sandpaper were slowly\r\ndrawn over a rough surface.  Then, with a swirl and a succession of\r\nphosphorescent splashes, the object vanished.\r\n\r\nThe sound had roused Andy.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he exclaimed, springing into the cockpit.\r\n\r\nBoth lads looked over the side.  Deep beneath the surface they saw a\r\nhuge luminous shape slowly gliding away.\r\n\r\n\"My word!\" whispered Andy.  \"Can't you see what it is?  It's a shark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was some natives swimming off to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear.  They'll never attempt such a thing with a sentry like\r\nthat brute,\" replied Andy as he re-entered the cabin.\r\n\r\nSlowly the weary hours passed, till the sun rose in a sky of misty\r\ngrey, and the inhabitants of McKay's Island, both black and white,\r\nbestirred themselves into activity.\r\n\r\n\"Not much wind, boss,\" was Chinese Pork's salutation as Mr. McKay and\r\nhis companions arrived at the beach, whither Andy had rowed in the\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be some before long,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"It usually springs\r\nup about an hour after sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll mean a long pull if it doesn't,\" rejoined Blight.  \"Shall I lend\r\nyou four or five hands to work the sweeps?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not trouble you, thanks.  It's your men who will find it hard\r\nwork, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, why?  You just see them use those paddles.  They'll keep it up\r\nfor hours at a stretch.  Your craft'll be the tail end of this 'ere\r\nprocession, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" replied Mr. McKay quietly, for he had no desire to\r\nenlighten the ex-pearler upon the subject of the motor.\r\n\r\n\"Say, boss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a rum packet,\" said Blight, indicating with a jerk of his thumb\r\nthe boat the lads had made from the wreck of the gig.  \"I bet you never\r\nbought her at Hilo?\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay did not reply.  He quite realised that the ex-pearler was\r\ntrying to pump him, while, on the other hand, he was equally determined\r\nto conceal the fact that he and his companions were on the island\r\nthrough shipwreck.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. McKay hated deception, he wished to convey the impression\r\nthat they settled here by choice, yet Blight's question showed that he\r\nkept his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to start?\" demanded Mr. McKay.  \"There's a wind\r\nspringing up from the south-east'ard.\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you like.  But can you lend me a revolver, cap'n?  I've got\r\na bloomin' Martini, but I've run out o' cartridges months and months\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, and here are fifty cartridges.  I'll make you a present\r\nof the pistol,\" replied Mr. McKay, though he realised that he was\r\nplaying into the man's hands.\r\n\r\nThen, without waiting to receive the ex-pearler's thanks, he stepped\r\ninto the boat and was rowed off to the yawl.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Ellerton,\" he exclaimed.  \"All quiet, I suppose?  Well,\r\nlet's get the canvas on her.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the natives were hauling their canoe down the beach, and by the\r\ntime the yawl had set her sails the splash of a score of paddles showed\r\nthat they had lost no time in embarking.\r\n\r\n\"Up with your helm, Andy; check the jib sheets.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as the little craft drew clear of the land, the freshening breeze\r\ncaused her to heel and glide through the ruffled water of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had gained the passage through the reef the yawl was\r\nahead of the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Glorious!\" ejaculated Andy.  \"See, they're setting their sail.  It\r\nwill be a good race, after all.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen bronzed natives were setting the raking mast and bending\r\nthe yard with its enormous sail of cocoa fibre.  Then, as the sail rose\r\nswiftly in the air, the breeze filled the mat-like canvas.  The crew\r\ntook in their paddles and watched the yawl with curious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We are gaining on her, I think,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we must shorten sail,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"But I want\r\nparticularly to note the respective speeds of the two craft.  I should\r\nthink that, under sail and aided by her paddles, that canoe could\r\noverhaul us under sail alone.  Yes,\" he continued, after a few moments'\r\ncareful observation.  \"I think I've seen enough in case of future\r\ndevelopments, so we'll strike the topsail.\"\r\n\r\nUnder reduced canvas the yawl kept the canoe at a regular distance from\r\nher, neither gaining nor allowing the latter to overhaul her.  Quexo,\r\nfearing an attack of sea-sickness, had retired to the seclusion of a\r\nberth in the fo'c'sle, while Ellerton and Terence, who had kept the\r\nlast portion of the previous night's watch, followed his example,\r\nthough from other motives.\r\n\r\nAndy was steering.  His father, who had given him the course, was below\r\npreparing a meal.\r\n\r\nThe wind held steadily all the forenoon, and by eleven o'clock the\r\nsummit of McKay's Island had dipped beneath the horizon.  It was not\r\nwithout feelings of regret that Andy saw it disappear.  He, too,\r\nrealised that they were embarked upon a hazardous mission, and that\r\npossibly great sacrifice would have to be made ere they returned to\r\ntheir island home.\r\n\r\nAt midday the wind died away to a flat calm, the yawl rolling\r\nsluggishly in the oily swell, with her boom swaying violently from side\r\nto side, and threatening dire disaster to the heads of any of the crew\r\nthat incautiously came within its reach.\r\n\r\nThe canoe, similarly situated, did not hesitate to lower the sail, and\r\npaddle close alongside.\r\n\r\n\"This is a bit rotten, cap'n,\" shouted Blight.  \"Shall I give you a\r\ntow?\"\r\n\r\n\"No thanks, don't trouble about us,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"You can\r\npaddle on ahead, and we'll follow when the breeze springs up.  If we\r\ncan't fetch Ni Atong before dark you might get those fellows to light a\r\nfire on the beach, so that we can come up to the anchorage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Righto, boss!  Ta-ta!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar glint in the man's eye.  He fancied that the\r\nsuperior speed of the canoe under paddles was an asset in his favour\r\nfor the events he had already planned.\r\n\r\nThe chief gave the word, the blades dipped, and, gathering way, the\r\ncanoe soon gained a rapid pace.  The long-drawn song of the paddlers\r\ngradually died away as the distance increased, and an hour later the\r\ncanoe was lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Andy, we'll start the motor, and creep up within a couple of\r\nmiles of Ni Atong.  They will think we have picked up a breeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you want to let that chap Blight know we've a motor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, Andy, I don't trust him.  If he plays a straight game, well\r\nand good; but, should he act treacherously--and I have every reason to\r\nbelieve he will, judging by his past career--we must keep a trump card\r\nup our sleeves.  That's why I wanted to make sure of the respective\r\nspeeds of the two craft, for you may be certain that, since the chief\r\nis in her, yonder canoe is the largest and swiftest they possess.\r\nUnder power we can easily outstrip her, I have no doubt.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the motor started than Terence and Ellerton appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!  Where's the wind?\" asked the latter.\r\n\r\n\"And where's the canoe?  added Donaghue.\r\n\r\n\"Hull down,\" replied Andy.  \"They've gone on ahead to give us a\r\nhouse-warming.  Now, you fellows, get yourselves something to eat, and\r\nthen give us a spell.  I'll let you have the course.  Keep your weather\r\neye lifting, and look out for a breeze.  It may come down suddenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet I will,\" assented Ellerton.  \"How far are we from Ni Atong?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twenty miles.  Directly the island hoves in sight call us.\"\r\n\r\nAt about four in the afternoon Terence, who had climbed the main-mast\r\nand had taken up a perch upon the diminutive cross-trees, reported land\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay and Andy were instantly warned, and, a breeze springing up,\r\nthe motor was shut off.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the heads of a patch of palm trees were visible from\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n\"That's Ni Atong, right enough,\" commented Mr. McKay, as bit by bit the\r\nland appeared to rise above the horizon.  \"Blight told me that the\r\nentrance to the lagoon is easily picked out.\"\r\n\r\nNi Atong resolved itself into a low, regularly outlined island barely\r\ntwo miles in length.  Its surface was covered with dense scrub and a\r\nfew cocoanut palms, the soil being apparently loose and sandy.  So far\r\nas could be seen, a coral reef extended round the island at a distance\r\nof half a mile from the shore, the rocks in places protruding above\r\nwater to a height of nearly three feet.\r\n\r\n\"There's another island showing up on our port bow, sir,\" announced\r\nEllerton.\r\n\r\n\"Then that's Ahii.  It's a lofty island something like ours, judging by\r\nthe appearance of that mountain.  However, we'll hear and see more of\r\nit later on.  Now, Andy, we are approaching the reef.  Do you climb\r\naloft and con the boat in through the channel.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the only practical method of entering an unbeaconed lagoon, for\r\nowing to the sudden increase in depth, a lead line is of little use.\r\nOn the other hand, the extreme clearness of the water makes it possible\r\nfor a man aloft to detect instantly any rocks or shoals that lurk\r\nbeneath the surface.\r\n\r\nFor the space of five minutes it was an anxious time.  On either hand\r\nthe breakers thrashed themselves in masses of milk-white foam upon the\r\nglistening coral reef, while ahead a narrow patch of undulating, yet\r\nunbroken water showed the presence of the only available channel into\r\nthe shelter of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Starboard--bear away--starboard again--port, steady!\"\r\n\r\nUnder the light breeze the yawl was in danger of dropping to leeward\r\nupon the merciless rocks.  One moment her stern was lifted high in the\r\nair, the rudder consequently being useless.  The next she threw her\r\nstreaming bows above the following wave, then, shaving the edge of the\r\nreef by a bare five yards, the little vessel glided into the quiet\r\nwaters of the anchorage.\r\n\r\nThe crew now had time to look about them.  Drawn up on the sandy beach\r\nwere seven large canoes, similar to that which had paid an unwelcome\r\nvisit to McKay's Island, while others, only slightly smaller in size,\r\nwere hauled up beneath the shelter of the bushes, their lofty carved\r\nprows alone being visible.\r\n\r\nThe beach was lined with natives, numbering at least 180 men, besides a\r\nhost of women and children.\r\n\r\nThe men were of medium stature, muscular, and well built.  In colour\r\nthey resembled that of Quexo, being considerably lighter than the\r\nnatives of New Guinea.  Many of them bore scars, possibly\r\nself-inflicted or the result of inter-tribal wars.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to let go!\" shouted Andy to Terence and Ellerton.  Then, as\r\nthe yawl shot up into the wind, he followed up with: \"Let go!\"\r\n\r\nWith a roar and rattle of chain the anchor plunged to the bottom of the\r\nlagoon, and as the crew prepared to lower and stow the sails, Mr. McKay\r\nwaved his arm towards the crowded shore.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lads,\" he exclaimed, \"what do you think of our allies?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FRUSTRATED SACRIFICE\r\n\r\n\"A rum-looking crowd,\" observed Terence.  \"They look as if they could\r\ndo a lot of damage, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. McKay, \"I am sure of it.  These fellows often fight\r\nfor fighting's sake, and a pretty spectacle they make of it at times.\r\nI've seen them at it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, these natives?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the inhabitants of New Guinea.  They are strongly associated,\r\nhowever, not only in manners and customs, but in language.  I must\r\npolish up my Polynesian lingo, though after acquiring a smattering of\r\nSpanish I'm afraid I've become very rusty.  Come, now, hurry up and\r\nsnug down, and we'll go ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Armed, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.  Take your revolvers only.  I don't think we need fear\r\nanything at present.  If there's to be trouble it will be after the\r\nnatives have made the best use of us.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly the little crew worked with a will; then, directly the\r\ncanvas was stowed and a second anchor laid out, the whole party went\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nThey were received with great show of goodwill, the natives crowding\r\nround them with shouts of welcome, while the ceremony of rubbing noses\r\nwas duly performed.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the women advanced bearing long garlands, and, to the\r\nundisguised bashfulness of the three lads, placed the flowing chains\r\nround the necks of their visitors.  Quexo, however, was denied that\r\nhonour.  He was a coloured man, and therefore, in the eyes of the\r\nnatives, of no consequence.\r\n\r\n\"You made a quick passage, boss, after all,\" observed Blight.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, we picked up with a breeze,\" replied Mr. McKay, though he did not\r\noffer to explain when the breeze was encountered.\r\n\r\n\"They've prepared a feast for you,\" continued the ex-pearler.  \"So\r\nlet's put our best foot foremost.\"\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the shore was a large clearing, temporary huts\r\nmade of branches and leaves of palm trees being erected in a vast\r\ndouble circle.  Here a number of natives were busy baking pigs and\r\nfowls, while there was an abundance of yams and cocoanuts.\r\n\r\n\"They are very improvident with their supplies,\" remarked Andy.  \"They\r\nevidently seem as if they are certain of returning to the land of\r\nplenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, who had taken an early opportunity of\r\nexamining the roasted pigs to make sure they were pigs.  \"We may as\r\nwell set-to and enjoy their hospitality; now, keep close together and\r\nsee that your pistols are easy to draw.\"\r\n\r\nThe chiefs, each distinguishable by his huge mop of greased and frizzed\r\nhair, had squatted in a semicircle, and no sooner had the guests seated\r\nthemselves than there was a terrific scramble on the part of the native\r\nchiefs to help themselves.\r\n\r\n\"We must forget for the moment that we are civilised and follow their\r\nexample,\" remarked Mr. McKay, seizing a bit of pork in his fingers.\r\n\r\nHis companions did likewise, and notwithstanding the absence of knives\r\nand forks they managed to eat and enjoy their share of the feast.\r\n\r\nThis done, there was a war-dance performed by the young men of the\r\ntribe, the warriors brandishing their clubs with such energy that it\r\nseemed wonderful that no one was hurt.\r\n\r\nThe natives did not appear to use their heavy clubs for the purpose of\r\nknocking their imaginary adversaries over the head; instead, they\r\nutilised the upward swing of their arms, lunging with the weapon on its\r\nupward stroke.\r\n\r\nAndy particularly noticed this, and remarked it to his father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.  \"It's a favourite 'knock-out' blow with these\r\nfellows.  I've seen them at it in actual combat.  The idea is to get\r\nunderneath their antagonist's guard, and strike him on the chin with\r\nthe upward sweep of the club, and knock him senseless.  Afterwards the\r\nwinning side secure those who are only stunned and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat them!\"\r\n\r\nAt length the display came to an end, and the guests prepared to return\r\non board.  Mr. McKay had attempted to converse with some of the chiefs,\r\nbut the result was a failure.  He therefore told Blight to inform the\r\nchief that an early start was to be made on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe news was received with redoubled shouts of delight, and the entire\r\npopulation escorted the white men to the beach.  Nor did they stop\r\nthere, for men, women, and children rushed headlong into the sea, and\r\nformed a huge bodyguard of swimmers till the yawl was reached.\r\n\r\nAll round the boat the water was black with the heads and arms of the\r\nswimmers, for these natives of the Pacific Islands take to the water\r\noften before they can walk.\r\n\r\nSplashing and shouting loud enough to scare every shark within a mile,\r\nthey swam round and round the yawl, none offering to climb aboard, till\r\nat a shout from one of the chiefs they turned and swam rapidly to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"We must set watches to-night, I suppose?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!  Although these people are supposed to be our friends, we\r\nmust imagine ourselves in hostile waters.  I remember once that a small\r\nschooner put into Niihau.  The natives came off to barter, and appeared\r\nto be extremely friendly.  During the night about a couple of hundred\r\nswam off to the schooner and took her crew entirely by surprise.  We\r\nfound the charred remains of her timbers about a month afterwards, but\r\nnot a trace of her unfortunate crew.  They had been made into 'big\r\npig.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise killed, roasted, and eaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"The usual.  Gunboat, landing party, etc.  The village was shelled and\r\nburnt, and the island afterwards annexed to the Empire.  So, you see,\r\nwe must exercise due caution, although I don't want to upset your\r\nnerves.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been shortly after midnight when the crew was awakened by\r\na warning shout from Terence.  Turning out of their comfortable bunks,\r\nthe others rushed from the cabin, armed in anticipation of a sudden and\r\ntreacherous attack.\r\n\r\nA low rumbling greeted their ears, the sound apparently coming from the\r\nshore.  For more than a minute the mysterious sound continued, then it\r\nsuddenly ceased.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Donald.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I cannot tell you,\" replied his father.  \"It's rather like\r\nthe sound of a submarine explosion; probably a volcanic eruption.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the noise was repeated, yet no agitation of the placid water took\r\nplace.  The natives did not appear to be disturbed, for no commotion\r\ndue to human agency could be heard from the island.  This time the\r\nrumbling continued for quite five minutes, dying away in a succession\r\nof long-drawn tremors.  Then all was quiet.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make it out,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"Whatever it is it seems to\r\nbe accepted by the natives without a protest.  To-morrow I'll inquire.\"\r\n\r\nThe party remained on deck for nearly an hour, but as the mysterious\r\nnoise was not repeated, they at length retired to the cabin, leaving\r\nTerence to continue the remainder of his watch.\r\n\r\nJust after sunrise Ellerton called Mr. McKay's attention to something\r\non the beach.  Seizing his glasses, the elder man brought them to bear\r\nupon the spot, and the next moment he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Come on, lads, get your arms and row ashore as hard as you can.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an explanation, the three lads jumped into the\r\nboat, Mr. McKay taking his place in the stern sheets.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look ahead; keep your eyes on the boat and pull,\" said Mr. McKay\r\nquietly, yet there was a grim, determined expression on his face that\r\nbetokened trouble ahead.\r\n\r\nThe moment the little craft touched the beach the lads jumped out, and\r\nled by Mr. McKay, they made their way at top speed along the sandy\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nFifty yards from where they landed was the chief's canoe, which had\r\nbeen hauled up on shore since the previous night.  At regular intervals\r\nbetwixt its lofty prow and the water were six dark objects lying on the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThe lads gave a gasp of horror, for lashed firmly to bamboo poles were\r\nsix natives.  Their fellows were preparing to launch the canoe over\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that!\" shouted Mr. McKay sternly, holding up his hand to arrest\r\nthe progress of the heavy craft, which was quivering under the grasp of\r\nfifty stalwart blacks.\r\n\r\nThe natives hesitated, glaring at the interrupters of their ceremony,\r\nwhile some of the chiefs made signs for the interfering strangers to\r\nstand aside.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Blight?\" shouted Mr. McKay, as he opened the cut-off of the\r\nmagazine of his rifle.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, boss,\" replied that individual, coolly sauntering forward.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to knock off this horrible business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em carry on, boss,\" was the reply, almost apologetic.  \"You see,\r\nthey ain't got no prisoners, and the chief's canoe must be launched in\r\nthis 'ere way, else it's bad luck.  So they picked on some of their\r\nleast wanted pals.  Bless me, you'll soon get used to it.  I did years\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell them from me that the moment that canoe moves we'll open\r\nfire.  You might also explain that if our wishes are not carried out,\r\nwe'll go back to our own island, and those rascals can stay here to\r\nstarve.  Now be quick, and let them know we mean business.  Cover these\r\ntow-headed rogues,\" he continued to his companions.  \"If I give the\r\nword, let fly continuous volleys till the rest of the rascals bolt.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the chiefs knew the power of the white men's rifles, for they\r\nstepped back a few paces.  Some of their followers grasped their clubs\r\nand spears, and courageously awaited their leaders' orders.\r\n\r\nJimmy Blight spoke rapidly.  At first his words seemed to enrage the\r\nchiefs, but finally they expostulated.\r\n\r\n\"What do they say?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are willing to let the brutes free if you promise that your\r\npower'll keep off the--the--you know what I mean, boss, the----\"\r\n\r\n\"Evil eye?\"' suggested Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, that's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell them that there's nothing to fear on that score.  Let\r\nthem know that six men alive are worth something, and that six squashed\r\nto a pulp will do them no earthly good.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again Blight turned to the half-pacified chiefs, a rapid exchange\r\nof words followed, and in the end the latter signed to their people to\r\nfree the captives from their terrible position.\r\n\r\n\"That's over, thank God!\" ejaculated Mr. McKay with intense fervour.\r\n\"Tell the chiefs I'm going to make them a present,\" and putting his\r\nrifle to his shoulder he fired six shots in the air in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nAstonishment held the natives spell-bound; they had never before seen a\r\nmagazine rifle discharged.  The sharp \"crack\" of the weapon, its\r\nsmokelessness, and the peculiar screech of the nickel bullets filled\r\nthem with awe, and with great hesitation they accepted the six empty\r\ncartridge-cases as an exchange for the release of the intended victims.\r\n\r\n\"They've given you a tally, boss,\" observed Blight.  \"They call you\r\n'The Wonder that Breathes Fire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope they will bear it in mind then,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Now let\r\nthem proceed with the launching operations.  When all is ready we will\r\nset sail.  By the by, what was that noise we heard last night?\" he\r\ninquired, turning to the ex-pearler.\r\n\r\n\"Noise!  What noise, boss?\"\r\n\r\n\"A kind of prolonged roar of distant thunder.  Twice it occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I know what you mean.  We don't take no notice of it in these\r\nparts.  It's the 'Barking Sands.'  See yon hills?\"--pointing to a ridge\r\nof sand dunes about sixty feet in height.  \"The stuff's slippery like,\r\nand often it rolls down, and makes a row.  There's a sight of other\r\nislands about here like it.\"\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later a flotilla of nine canoes, crowded with armed\r\nnatives, paddled slowly towards the entrance of the lagoon.  As they\r\npassed the white men's craft, their paddles rose in the air to the\r\naccompaniment of a sonorous salute.\r\n\r\nThen, as the dripping anchor rose clear of the water, the breeze filled\r\nthe sails of the yawl, and she, too, started to play her part in the\r\nhazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\nAnother five hours would decide whether Ahii would fall into the hands\r\nof its former possessors, and, what was still more important, the fate\r\nof the little band from McKay's Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAT BAY\r\n\r\nOnce clear of the reef, the canoes ceased paddling, and the brown\r\ncocoa-fibre sails were hoisted.\r\n\r\nThe yawl, by reason of her superior spread of canvas, soon forged ahead\r\ntill, drawing in line with the largest canoe, in which were Blight and\r\nthe head man of the tribe, the speed was regulated so as to keep within\r\nhailing distance of the ex-pearler.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay had already been given a rough chart of the island of Ahii.\r\nLike their own island and Ni Atong, Ahii was surrounded by a reef, only\r\nthat on the eastern side the rocky barrier practically touched the\r\nshore.  There were four large passages through the reef, two on the\r\nsouthern side--which they were approaching--one on the western, and the\r\nfourth on the northern.\r\n\r\nThe summit of Ahii was clearly visible from Ni Atong, and as the\r\nflotilla neared the island its peculiarities could be gradually\r\ndiscerned.  It was considerably larger than McKay's Island, and\r\ncomposed chiefly of a dark brown rock, its flat portions covered with\r\nverdure.  The general outline resembled a saddle, the higher of the two\r\npeaks being over two thousand feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nBut in place of the glistening sands of McKay's Island there was a\r\nbeach of black sand, apparently the ground-up deposit of lava, for from\r\nthe lower of the two peaks a thin cloud of smoke was emitted, showing\r\nthat Ahii was still an active volcano.\r\n\r\nAt the western termination of the beach was perceived the entrance to a\r\nsmall creek, while beyond this opening low, dark-coloured cliffs rose\r\nsheer from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the invaders was observed long before the flotilla\r\nreached the entrance of the lagoon, and by the aid of their telescopes\r\nand field-glasses the crew of the yawl saw that the beach was lined\r\nwith warriors, armed with formidable beak-headed clubs, long spears and\r\noblong shields, the natives being bedecked with barbaric finery and\r\nplentifully bedaubed with paint and ochre.\r\n\r\n\"That's their boat harbour,\" shouted Blight, pointing to the creek.\r\n\"Their canoes are drawn up on the banks about half-a-mile up the river.\r\nThe village is on the port side.  Shall I tell our men to push right in\r\nand burn their blessed canoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"I don't want unnecessary violence; besides,\r\nif their canoes are destroyed, how can they leave the island?  Let our\r\nboats remain about two hundred yards from shore.  You will then stand\r\nin the chief's canoe and tell the natives to clear out.  Say that we\r\ngive them till midday.  Otherwise we must open fire on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't want these fellows to have a set-to?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!  No bloodshed unless it cannot possibly be avoided.  Now carry on\r\nand we'll be ready to open fire to cover your retreat if they give\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\nBlight could not but obey.  The chief's canoe was paddled slowly\r\ntowards the shore, the natives regarding the late inhabitants of Ahii\r\nwith contemptuous gestures not unmingled with curiosity.  They expected\r\na mad rush, a fierce conflict on the shore, and an easy victory; but\r\nthe apparently timorous approach of a solitary canoe mystified them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHIEF'S CANOE WAS PADDLED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SHORE]\r\n\r\nThe ex-pearler stood up and shouted to the hostile chiefs.  Whether he\r\ngave Mr. McKay's message in a conciliatory manner the Australian was\r\nnot in a position to ascertain.  More than likely, Blight, with a white\r\nman's contempt for \"niggers,\" put his own construction upon the\r\nrequest, for before he had spoken half-a-dozen sentences there was a\r\nblood-curdling yell, and a shower of stones was hurled at the canoe.\r\n\r\nThe crew paddled out of range, while their companions, with loud\r\ncounter-shouts of defiance, urged their boat to the attack, till by\r\ndint of much hand-waving Mr. McKay kept them temporarily in check.\r\n\r\n\"They've asked us to come ashore and be made into 'big pig,'\" shouted\r\nBlight.  \"Shall we let our men loose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Paddle along the shore and we'll make\r\na landing as far from the village as possible.  That will give the\r\nenemy a chance to clear out if they get the worst of it.\"\r\n\r\nHeaded by the yawl, the little fleet kept parallel with the shore, a\r\ncrowd of about two thousand armed savages keeping pace with the\r\ninvaders, yelling, dancing, brandishing their weapons, and hurling the\r\ndirest insults of which the natives were capable at their apparently\r\ninferior enemies.\r\n\r\n\"It must be a sharp lesson, lads,\" observed Mr. McKay.  \"What wouldn't\r\nI give for a Maxim or an automatic Colt.  Ellerton, you take the helm\r\nand keep the boat just so, no nearer to shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe flotilla was now abreast of that part of the beach that was\r\nterminated by the cliffs.  Here the flat shore consisted of a\r\nwedge-shaped piece of ground, so narrow that the enemy was unable to\r\ntake due advantage of its superiority in numbers.  The rapid fire of\r\nfour magazine rifles would play havoc with the dense serried ranks of\r\nbronzed and painted warriors, but still Mr. McKay refrained from making\r\nthe first advance.\r\n\r\n\"Let them fight it out between themselves,\" he shouted to Blight, who,\r\nhowever eager he was to send the natives to the fight, did not show any\r\nstrong inclination to lead them.  \"We'll open fire if our fellows get\r\nthe worst of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plainly impossible to keep the invaders in hand.  With a roar of\r\ndefiance that momentarily drowned the yells of their more numerous\r\nadversaries, the natives urged their canoes towards the shore.\r\n\r\nThen, as craft after craft grounded upon the beach, their crews dropped\r\npaddles, grasped their clubs and spears, and plunged waist deep into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nIt was a veritable struggle between a host of bronzed paladins.\r\n\r\nClubs met with a loud and ponderous clang, spears met shields or else\r\nfound a softer billet, while those of the defenders of the island who\r\ncould not gain the van hurled enormous stones over the heads of their\r\nforemost ranks at their vindictive foes.\r\n\r\nAbove the shouts of the combatants could be heard the shrieks of the\r\ndesperately wounded.\r\n\r\nSeveral received serious wounds on both sides, yet save in extreme\r\ncases, they bore their hurts bravely, returning to the fray with the\r\nutmost determination, till failing strength caused them to drop, still\r\nfighting so long as they could wield a club or thrust with a spear.\r\n\r\nTwice the rightful inhabitants of Ahii gained a footing on the shore,\r\nand twice were they swept back by the weight of numbers, for as fast as\r\none of the defenders fell, another filled his place, while on the other\r\nhand the invaders had no reserves.  True, there were the white men, but\r\nit was impossible to wield a rifle without serious consequence to\r\nfriend as well as foe.\r\n\r\n\"How these fellows fight!\" exclaimed Andy.  \"They simply won't give\r\nway; they'll be exterminated.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fighting for fighting's sake,\" replied his father.  \"We must chip\r\nin or we'll find ourselves opposed to the whole island without a native\r\nto help us.  Luff her up, Ellerton.  That's right; now keep her as she\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nThe yawl moved slowly in the opposite direction to her previous course,\r\nthough still parallel with the shore.  By this means the scene of the\r\nactual struggle was passed and only the serried rearguard of the\r\ndefenders was abeam.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, aim low!\"\r\n\r\nThe four rifles opened a rapid fire.  It seemed like butchery, yet, as\r\nMr. McKay had said, there was no alternative.  Twenty human beings\r\ncannot stop a modern rifle-bullet fired at one hundred yards' range.\r\n\r\nThe defence seemed to melt away, and with redoubled shouts of triumph\r\nthe friendly natives started in pursuit of the fugitives, knocking over\r\nthe head all who were overtaken.\r\n\r\n\"If those fellows won't keep in hand, they will be in danger of being\r\ncut off,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.  \"We must follow our friends up.\r\nEllerton, you stay on board, and keep our craft underway.\"\r\n\r\nHurriedly the two McKays, Terence, and Quexo jumped into the tender,\r\nrowed ashore, and followed the ghastly trail of the victorious natives.\r\n\r\nIt was a hazardous undertaking, for some of the fugitives had fled\r\ninland instead of following their main body in their retreat upon the\r\nvillage.  At any moment these might rally and fall upon the little band\r\nof white men, the dense scrub being favourable for such tactics.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of Jimmy Blight.  He had not accompanied the natives\r\nin their first attack, although he was known to have been in the\r\nchief's canoe, nor had he made his appearance when the white party\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\n\"Keep a bright look-out, lads,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.  \"Have your\r\nrevolvers ready.  They are more serviceable than rifles here.\"\r\n\r\nAt almost every yard of the way lay natives either dead or grievously\r\nwounded.  Many of the latter were bold enough to attempt to rise and\r\nthreaten the white men.  So far as possible, the wounded were ignored,\r\ngreatly to their surprise, for a savage rarely gives and never expects\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, however, a warrior would spring to his feet after the\r\nwhite men had passed, and with his remaining energy throw his club or\r\nspear at his enemies.  In that case it became necessary to silence the\r\ndesperate native for ever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the shelter of a dense belt of scrub three powerful\r\nblacks dashed upon Quexo, who had strayed a few yards behind the rest\r\nof the party.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto raised his revolver and fired, and a huge native sprang a\r\ngood three feet in the air and tumbled on his face.  But ere Quexo\r\ncould repeat his shot a triple-barbed spear pierced his shoulder.  He\r\nfell, the weapon still embedded in his flesh.\r\n\r\nThe man who had thrown the lance drew a stone knife, and threw himself\r\nupon the prostrate mulatto, while the third native raised his club to\r\ncomplete the business.\r\n\r\nWith admirable presence of mind Quexo shot the man with the club, who\r\nin his fall completely covered the hapless mulatto.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the first shot, Mr. McKay and the two lads ran to the aid of\r\ntheir companion, but ere they emerged from the bush a third shot rang\r\nout, and the savage who had hurled the spear at the mulatto fell shot\r\nthrough the head.\r\n\r\nThen as Andy rushed to the spot where Quexo lay, Jimmy Blight stepped\r\nfrom the cover of a group of palm trees.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bad shot, eh, boss?\" he exclaimed, as he thrust fresh cartridges\r\ninto his revolver.  \"You'd best get your young fellow on board as quick\r\nas you can, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\nQuexo was groaning dismally, now the actual struggle was over.  The\r\ntriple spear-head had made a ghastly wound in his shoulder, for in his\r\nfall the haft had broken off short.  Mr. McKay managed to extract it\r\nskilfully.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their misfortunes the roar of the combatants came\r\nnearer and nearer.  The enemy had rallied; the savages were driving\r\nback their attackers.  Already men were streaming by, flying for their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\"Guess we'd best hook it,\" exclaimed Blight.\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand, Andy,\" said his father, as he pointed to his helpless\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool, boss!\" shouted the ex-pearler, who was already\r\nbeginning to retire.  \"He's about done for, and we'll be the same if we\r\nstop.  Come along!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" replied Mr. McKay sturdily.  \"You go if you want to.  Come on,\r\nAndy, move him across to yonder thicket.  We'll make a last stand here\r\nif it comes to the worst.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in Mr. McKay's reply must have appealed to the better nature\r\nof this low-down specimen of the white race, for, turning swiftly on\r\nhis heel, he returned.  Kneeling beside the unconscious man he helped\r\nhimself to his bandolier, revolver, and rifle.\r\n\r\nWithout another word the four men lifted Quexo to the shelter of the\r\ntrees, and quietly and resolutely made ready to receive the horde of\r\ntriumphant savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nELLERTON TO THE RESCUE\r\n\r\nAlready the last of the fugitives had passed, rushing blindly for the\r\nshelter of their canoes, and the foremost of their pursuers were\r\nemerging from the clearing.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, cool in the time of extreme peril, calculated that only\r\nabout a hundred of their allies remained alive, while, making due\r\nallowance for the tremendous execution, there were at least a thousand\r\nbloodthirsty foes.  Four against a thousand!\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire yet!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the savages crossed the clearing at breakneck rate,\r\nand disappeared in the direction of the beach, but others came at a\r\nmore leisurely pace, examining those of the fugitives who had fallen.\r\nThose who showed signs of life were bound hand and foot, for what\r\npurpose the white men had no doubt whatever.\r\n\r\nPresently the keen eye of one of the savages caught a glimpse of one of\r\nthe rifle barrels.  The man was evidently a chief, for, in addition to\r\nhis coat of paint, he wore a short cloak of feathers.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation the savage uttered a loud shout and ran\r\nstraight in the direction of the white men, followed, at a distance of\r\nabout twenty paces, by some fifty yelling natives.\r\n\r\n\"You take that fellow, Blight!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay quietly.\r\n\r\nBlight raised his rifle to his shoulder, took a sight in the centre of\r\nthe chief's broad chest, and pressed the trigger.\r\n\r\n\"Missed, by smoke!\" he cried, for the man came on steadily.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a few seconds to open and close the bolt of the\r\nrifle, and in that time the chief still ran on; but before Blight could\r\ndischarge his weapon a second time, the native's knees appeared to give\r\nway, and he pitched headlong on his face.\r\n\r\nAll four men were firing fast into the hostile press.  The rush was\r\nstopped, although some of the savages came near enough to hurl their\r\nspears, several of which stuck in the trunks of the palm trees behind\r\nwhich the little band took shelter.\r\n\r\nMany of the attackers fled for safety, others did not deign to run, but\r\nretired slowly, brandishing their weapons at their enemies as they did\r\nso.  Some paid for their rashness, for it was a case of fighting for\r\nexistence, and every native put out of action told.\r\n\r\n\"The beggars are going to corral us,\" exclaimed Blight.  \"See, they are\r\nrunning round to our left.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of volleys drove the natives back still farther, yet without\r\nattempting to take cover they continued their tactics of trying to cut\r\noff their enemies' retreat.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea Islanders rarely resort to strategy in actual fighting.\r\nThey may, indeed, take steps to surround their enemies, and then charge\r\nfearlessly to close quarters.\r\n\r\nThe white men were even now surrounded, for the advanced body, having\r\nfailed to prevent the embarkation of the discomfited invaders, had been\r\nattracted by the sound of the firing and had completed the hostile\r\ncordon.\r\n\r\nIn the lull that ensued, Mr. McKay contrived to place a temporary\r\nbandage over Quexo's shoulder.  The mulatto was still unconscious, but\r\nshowed no symptoms of having been poisoned by the spear thrust.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what Hoppy is doing?\" remarked Terence, after moistening his\r\nparched lips with a draught from his water-bottle.  \"I guess he's in a\r\nterrible stew.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may manage to make our friends attempt another attack.  If so, we\r\ncan bolt for the shore; though I'm not going to put much faith in\r\nthat,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"They've had too much of a licking, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity you didn't let us burn those blessed canoes, boss; these black\r\nrascals will be able to follow our craft now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I admit I erred on the side of mercy, Mr. Blight,\" was the reply.\r\n\"It's my fault, and I must take the blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"That comes o' being so mighty particular,\" retorted the ex-pearler\r\nbluntly.  \"If we come out o' this I guess your opinion of a nigger will\r\nhave an almighty change.  Now, stand by, for here they come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be taken alive, lads,\" continued Mr. McKay, and the next instant\r\nthe rifle-fire reopened.\r\n\r\nUpon the dense masses of natives every shot told, yet having only one\r\nrifle for each front the fire was not sufficiently extended to keep the\r\nadvancing enemy at bay.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with shouts and shrieks, while stones and spears\r\nflew in deadly showers.  Once the magazines were empty there was no\r\ntime to recharge.  The heated rifles were flung aside and the revolvers\r\nwere brought into use.\r\n\r\nThe four men shot rapidly and well, the heavy lead bullets stopping the\r\nheadlong rush far more effectively than did the nickel rifle ammunition.\r\n\r\nOnce again the attack failed, the savages drawing off and leaving at\r\nleast fifty of their number dead or wounded on the field.  Not one of\r\nthe enemy had got within twenty yards of the death-dealing weapons of\r\nthe white men.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boss,\" gasped Blight, as he bound a discoloured silk handkerchief\r\nround a spear-scratch on his left wrist.  \"Shall we make a bolt for it?\r\nWe can fight our way to the shore.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay pointed to the still unconscious Quexo.\r\n\r\n\"Put a bullet through his head.  He won't feel it.  Why should we chuck\r\naway our chance for a wounded nigger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Mr. Blight, I've told you before you can go if you want to.\r\nHere are two revolvers you can take; there's a good chance now, so go,\r\nand good luck to you!  I must stay here--what do you say, lads?\"\r\n\r\nTerence and Andy grimly signified their intention of remaining with\r\ntheir stricken comrade.\r\n\r\nBlight saw there was a chance, but, in his opinion, far from a good one.\r\n\r\nAlthough the spot the little band had chosen for their stand was within\r\na hundred yards of the sea, to return to where the canoes had landed\r\ntheir armed contents was at least a quarter of a mile distant.\r\n\r\nThen, again, directly he left cover and began to run, a hundred natives\r\nwould join in the pursuit.  Even could he manage to fight his way\r\nthrough the ring and outstrip his pursuers, there was a long swim in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nGood swimmer though he was, Blight recognised that he was decidedly\r\ninferior in speed to the amphibious natives.\r\n\r\n\"I see it's no go, boss,\" he exclaimed.  \"So let's stick at it to the\r\nend.  Come on, you black fiends!\" he added, shaking his fist at the\r\ndark masses of warriors, as they prepared to renew the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Don't waste a single shot,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.  \"Here's the main\r\nattack, so direct a combined fire in that direction, till they get\r\nwithin fifty yards.  Then each man must look to his front and do his\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely spoken ere the fierce yells of the savages\r\nredoubled, and the rush began.\r\n\r\nScorning to take advantage of the slightest bit of cover, they raced\r\nfuriously, leaping over the low scrub that would have stopped a\r\ncivilised race.\r\n\r\nThen the rattle of the rifle-fire rose above the shouts of the natives.\r\nScores were hit, some falling on the spot, others running several yards\r\nere their strength failed, while many of the wounded, in their mad\r\nthirst for vengeance, staggered after their comrades in an endeavour to\r\nlaunch themselves upon the white men.\r\n\r\nNo longer was there need to raise rifle to shoulder.  Firing from the\r\nhip, the little knot of desperate men emptied their magazines into the\r\nthrong of natives, then, casting aside their rifles, as before, they\r\ngrasped their revolvers, hardly daring to hope to check the headlong\r\nrush.\r\n\r\nSuddenly to an accompaniment of a peculiar screech, a trail of thin\r\nsmoke flashed earthwards from the sky.  Then, with a terrific report,\r\nan explosion took place right in the middle of the surging pack of\r\nsavages, and ere the cloud of dense, suffocating smoke cleared away,\r\nthe natives fled in all directions.  Some, indeed, were so terrified\r\nthat they fell flat on their faces, clapping their hands to their ears\r\nto shut out the echoes of the thunderous report.\r\n\r\nThose who were on the remote side of the encircling body of natives,\r\nthough far from the scene of the explosion, were also seized with\r\npanic, and the whole crowd, save those who had been hit or were too\r\ndazed to move, fled helter-skelter for the village.\r\n\r\nFor a full minute none of the white men spoke.  Terence and Andy looked\r\nwith utter amazement at the retreating foes; Mr. McKay and Blight, more\r\nhardened in peril, seized the opportunity to thrust fresh clips of\r\ncartridges into their magazines.\r\n\r\n\"Guess a gunboat's been dropping a shell,\" observed Blight, who was the\r\nfirst to break the long-drawn silence.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong,\" replied Mr. McKay quietly.  \"A shell would never throw\r\nout a cloud of smoke like that; it's not the colour of lyddite either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what is it?  Who fired it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Young Ellerton,\" was the astonishing reply.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay was correct in his surmise.  Ellerton, on seeing his\r\ncompanions start in support of their coloured allies, was not\r\naltogether at his ease.  He kept tacking the yawl, so as to be within\r\neasy distance of the landing-place in case of a hasty retreat on the\r\npart of the invaders.\r\n\r\nGradually the sounds of the running fight died away; but no report of\r\nfirearms served to show that the white men had got in touch with their\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nSeen from seaward the scrub seemed almost so thick as to be impassable.\r\nMr. McKay and his companions were literally swallowed up in the\r\ntrackless waste that lay beyond the low range of cliffs.\r\n\r\nEllerton looked around at the canoes.  Beyond a man left in each as a\r\nboat-keeper they were deserted.  Blight had vanished; when and where\r\nthe young Englishman knew not.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the distant report of a revolver burst upon his ears.  He knew\r\nit to be a pistol shot, for it had not the short, sharp crack of a\r\nrifle.  That meant foes at close quarters.  Then came two other reports\r\nin quick succession, followed by a prolonged silence.\r\n\r\nThe firing reassured him.  He realised that his friends were not with\r\ntheir savage allies, and that they were, in consequence, between the\r\nvillage and the beach.  Rightly enough he guessed that they were\r\ndealing with a party of stragglers, the noise of only three shots and\r\nthe absence of rifle-fire showed that the conflict was brief and\r\ndecisive.\r\n\r\nThe youth tacked once more, and steered eastward along the beach.\r\nAgain the long silence filled him with a nameless anxiety.  He\r\nregretted the evil day when Blight and the natives came to McKay's\r\nIsland; but in the circumstances nothing else could be done.  They had\r\nput their hand to the plough; there was no turning back.\r\n\r\nThen, gradually but surely, came the sound of the natives still engaged\r\nin conflict, unaccompanied by the report of firearms.  There was no\r\nmistaking it.  Their allies were being driven back; but where were the\r\nwhite men?\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the sounds of the retreating natives and their\r\npursuers, till the foremost of the fugitives gained the shore.  Jumping\r\ninto their canoes they pushed off, panic-stricken and utterly fatigued.\r\nThen came the main body, a sorry remnant at most, grimly fighting their\r\nfoes at almost every step.\r\n\r\nWaist deep in water they fought, till the survivors contrived to escape\r\nin their boats.  Two canoes were left unmanned, their solitary\r\noccupants paddling laboriously out of the reach of their foes.\r\n\r\nNor did the pursuit cease at the water's edge, for several of the enemy\r\ndashed boldly into the waves and swam after the retreating craft.\r\n\r\nOne of the latter was, indeed, overtaken, and a desperate struggle\r\nensued between the rival natives, till the crew of another canoe,\r\nseeing their companions' plight, returned and saved them from being\r\nwiped out.\r\n\r\nThen the flotilla moved well out into the lagoon, and took up a\r\nposition beyond the yawl, the natives, many of them badly wounded,\r\nbeing too exhausted to paddle another stroke.\r\n\r\nEllerton was now confronted with a real peril.  His friends, if alive,\r\nwere cut off; he was unable to gather any tidings from the natives, who\r\nreplied to his gestures by grunts and meaningless exclamations.\r\n\r\nJust then came the rattle of musketry.  At all events, Mr. McKay and\r\nhis party were still in a position to offer resistance, but against\r\nwhat odds?\r\n\r\nJust then the wind, hitherto light, died utterly away.  Ellerton knew\r\nnothing about the motor, and he himself was now in a position of peril.\r\nUnable to move, save by using a sweep, which was hard work, he was at\r\nthe mercy of the savages, who, lining the shore, had realised his\r\npredicament, and were preparing to swim off and carry the yawl by storm.\r\n\r\nEllerton had plenty of rifles and revolvers, but even then he could not\r\nhope to keep the mob of foes at bay.\r\n\r\nSeizing a rifle, he sprang upon the cabin-top and opened fire.  It was\r\na fairly long range--some six hundred yards--but Ellerton gauged the\r\ndistance to a nicety; with the correct elevation, missing a man in that\r\nthrong was about an impossibility.  A commotion showed that the shot\r\nhad taken effect.  Another with equally good result!  Ellerton again\r\nfelt the lust of battle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of his cool and deliberate firing, a blow from\r\nthe boom nearly knocked the youth overboard.  The breeze had again\r\nsprung up.\r\n\r\nRecovering himself by grasping the main shrouds, Ellerton laid his\r\nrifle on the deck and jumped into the cockpit.  He meant to steer along\r\nthe coast towards the village, and, if possible, aid his friends by a\r\nlong, dropping fire.\r\n\r\nHis progress was slow, the wind being still light, and ere the yawl had\r\ntravelled a hundred yards the firing on shore died away.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean?  He thought.  Were his companions at length\r\noverwhelmed by dint of numbers?  If so he would take revenge; he would\r\ncruise up and down the shore and blaze away so long as a savage\r\nremained on the beach, or a cartridge remained on board.\r\n\r\nAnd after?  He gave but a brief thought to that--a solitary existence\r\non a boat far from the little island he regarded as his home--but the\r\nthought filled him with the rage of despair.\r\n\r\nSteering by means of the tiller between his knees, Ellerton headed\r\ndiagonally towards the shore, at the same time charging the magazines\r\nof half-a-dozen rifles.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, to his astonishment and delight the sound of firing\r\nwas resumed, the scene of action being nearly abreast of where the yawl\r\nwas steering.  He immediately hove-to, and again ascending the\r\ncabin-top, looked ashore.  The scrub and several small groves of\r\ncocoanut palms prevented him from seeing the combatants, and on this\r\naccount he refrained from opening a dropping fire, for fear of harming\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nHe was in a helpless state of perplexity till all at once a thought\r\nstruck him which gave him new-born hope.\r\n\r\nThe night he and Andy kept watch on board, in the lagoon of McKay's\r\nIsland, they had taken some rockets to use should they require\r\nassistance.  These rockets were of the ordinary sea-pattern, making a\r\nloud explosion by means of a small charge of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nHurriedly Ellerton fixed one of the rockets so that it would assume a\r\ncurved flight instead of soaring upwards, then turning the vessel's\r\ncourse till the direction of the projectile would be as near as\r\npossible towards the scene of action, he discharged the novel weapon.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"That was a lucky thought of yours, Ellerton, my boy,\" exclaimed Mr.\r\nMcKay, when the little party was safely on board.  \"They scooted like\r\nrabbits.  But, by Jove! it was a narrow squeak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nROUTING THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest doubt about it.  The expedition had failed\r\ndisastrously.  Quexo was badly wounded, the white men all more or less\r\nexhausted, while barely forty utterly demoralised natives were cowering\r\nin their canoes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can't stay here,\" remarked Mr. McKay, after the mulatto's\r\nhurts had been dressed and the wounded man placed on one of the bunks.\r\n\"They will be starting in pursuit, I'm thinking, and so, Mr. Blight,\r\nwill you tell those black rascals to man two of their canoes and\r\ndestroy the others?  By that means we may be able to get the survivors\r\nback to Ni Atong.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay's opinion of the ex-pearler was undergoing a change.  No\r\ndoubt the man was a bit of a scoundrel, he thought, but he was older\r\nand possibly more of a reformed character than in the old days in\r\nTorres Strait.  He had certainly fought well and had impressed the lads\r\nas a resolute and cautious combatant.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell 'em, boss,\" he replied.  \"But, by snakes, it's a bad\r\nlook-out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" assented Mr. McKay, as he prepared to go below and bind up a\r\nslight wound on his shoulder.  \"Your friends will have to be content\r\nwith Ni Atong for a while, I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was also in the cabin, where he was attending to a surface wound\r\non his forehead--the legacy of one of the savages' showers of\r\nstones--so only Terence and Ellerton remained on deck with the\r\nex-pearler.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't the boss bring over the rest of your pals and settle our\r\nscore with those niggers?\"\r\n\r\n\"What pals?\"' asked Terence, taken aback by the suddenness of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the other chaps on your island.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are none,\" replied Terence.\r\n\r\nBarely had the words escaped him, when he realised that he had made an\r\nadmission.  He had revealed the comparative weakness of the defences of\r\nMcKay's Island.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Is that so?\" was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\nBlight said no more on the subject, for the yawl was now within hailing\r\ndistance of the forlorn flotilla.\r\n\r\nThe natives accepted their white companion's orders without demur.  The\r\ntwo most serviceable canoes were brought up with their full complement,\r\nand the rest were scuttled till they floated awash--useless to friend\r\nor foe.  Then with a light breeze the three craft--the yawl leading the\r\nforlorn procession--headed for the opening in the reef.\r\n\r\nJimmy Blight was thinking.  He was not of a thinking nature, but\r\nscheming and plotting were the only intellectual subjects in which he\r\nexcelled.  In fact, he was a past master in the art of intrigue.\r\n\r\nHe briefly summed up the situation and enlarged upon it.  His house and\r\nstore at Ahii were in the hands of a hostile race of savages.  His\r\nwealth of copra and other valuable native products had vanished.\r\n\r\nHad his black friends been able to regain possession of Ahii, he would\r\nnot have hesitated to incite them to fall treacherously upon the white\r\nmen from McKay's Island, and the doubtless valuable stores of that\r\nplace would be his.  Now, with fewer than forty of his savage friends\r\nat his command, the risk was too great--at least at present.\r\n\r\nNo, he must wait his time, return to Ni Atong, and endeavour to find an\r\nopportunity of surprising and slaying the handful of whites.  If only\r\nhe dared!  With a fully charged revolver he might make a sudden\r\nattack----\r\n\r\nThis wicked scheming was suddenly interrupted by a shout from one of\r\nthe canoes.  The keen-eyed savages had detected an ominous movement\r\nashore.  Their enemies were launching their canoes in pursuit of their\r\ndiscomfited adversaries.\r\n\r\n\"Say, boss!\" exclaimed the ex-pearler, as Mr. McKay emerged from the\r\nlittle cabin.  \"What's to be done now?  There ain't no wind, in a\r\nmanner o' speaking, and those reptiles'll overhaul us hand over fist.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay did not reply at first, but anxiously scanned the shore with\r\nhis glasses.\r\n\r\n\"There are seven canoes,\" he announced.  \"Three for us to tackle and\r\ntwo for each canoe. 'Tis long odds, but I reckon we'll come out on top.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not get aboard the canoes, and let this 'ere packet go?\" asked\r\nBlight.  \"There'll be more chance with the blacks using their paddles.\r\nIt'll be a flat calm in a minute or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"We'll fight it out as we are, though we've\r\nhad quite enough for one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe crews of the two friendly canoes were still lying on their paddles,\r\nrealising that their only hope was in remaining by the white man's\r\nboat.  Their indifference had vanished, and weapons were brandished in\r\na way that showed a grim determination to fight to the death.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to paddle for all they are worth,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" demanded Blight, his old aggressive manner beginning to\r\nreturn.  \"What's the use?  Let's keep together, I vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to,\" replied Mr. McKay coolly.  \"Now do as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nSullenly the ex-pearler obeyed, and the natives, plying their paddles\r\nto the accompaniment of a mournful chant, soon increased the distance\r\nbetween them and the almost becalmed yawl.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Andy, start the motor.\"\r\n\r\nGreat was Blight's astonishment as the engine began to purr, and the\r\nlittle craft shot through the water at a good eight knots.  He had\r\nnever seen an internal combustion engine before.  Although motor-driven\r\ncraft are common amongst the pearling and trading fleets in the\r\nPacific, he had left the fishing-grounds some years before the first\r\nmotor had made its appearance.\r\n\r\nNor was the wonder of the crews of the friendly canoes any the less.\r\nTo them the white man's boat, vomiting clouds of vapour from the\r\nexhaust and producing a series of rapid explosions, was nothing more or\r\nless than a fiery-dragon.\r\n\r\n\"We are going the pace too much,\" remarked Andy, for the yawl was\r\neasily outdistancing the canoes, whose crews were showing signs of\r\nphysical distress.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we must stand by them,\" replied his father.  \"See, our pursuers\r\nare gaining; you are quite sure the motor is thoroughly tuned up, I\r\nhope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Running like clockwork,\" was Andy's enthusiastic reply.\r\n\r\n\"Good!  Now, lads, it's revolvers for this business.  Get the canvas\r\noff her, then.  Keep well under cover; I'm going to ram the leading\r\ncanoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe sails were quickly stowed, and the bowsprit run in.  The five men,\r\nrevolvers in hand, kept in the cockpit so as to be sheltered by the\r\nraised roof of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ellerton, how's your nerve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then put your helm over when I give the word and strike yonder canoe\r\nsquare amidships.\"\r\n\r\nThe pursuers had trailed out in a long, straggling line, a couple of\r\nhundred yards separating the foremost from the second.\r\n\r\nOn they came, fearlessly.  Ellerton could see the foam flying from the\r\nsharp prow, the muscular backs of the straining oarsmen, and hear the\r\nsteady yet rapid thud of the paddles.  Now he could discern the whites\r\nof the eyes of the fierce-looking warriors who were gathering in her\r\nlofty bows.\r\n\r\n\"Make due allowance for the way she carries,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.\r\n\"Now, hard over!\"\r\n\r\nThe youth at the helm put all his strength against the tiller.  The\r\nyawl rolled outward as she turned, then recovering herself rushed\r\nstraight for her gigantic antagonist.\r\n\r\nWith a yell of defiance the savages let fly a shower of arrows and\r\nstones.  The masts and deck were literally bristling with darts, while\r\nthe stones rolled like hail upon the planks.\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of the cabin-top the white men escaped the deadly\r\nvolley, but Ellerton, gripping the tiller with a vice-like grip, felt a\r\nhot, stinging pain in his left arm.\r\n\r\nThen, crash!  Fair in the centre of the lightly-built fifty-feet hull\r\nstruck the sharp stem.  There was a terrific splintering of wood and\r\nthe gurgling sound of inrushing water, while at the same time the fore\r\npart of the yawl was crowded with a score of black fiends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRASH!  FAIR IN THE CENTRE OF THE LIGHTLY BUILT\r\nFIFTY-FEET HULL STRUCK THE SHARP STEM]\r\n\r\nThen the revolvers barked, and the living mob of savages melted away,\r\nand the next instant the yawl was ploughing her way over the shattered\r\nremains of the war-canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the crew.  \"Now for the next!\"\r\n\r\nBut the second canoe, profiting by her consort's misfortunes, turned\r\nand paddled rapidly back, to obtain the support of the third.\r\n\r\nWith a difference of barely one knot in speed the advantage of the\r\nmotor-driven vessel was lost, so the crew had to be content to keep out\r\nof range of the arrows and pour in volleys from the rifles.\r\n\r\nIt was a stern lesson, but one that was absolutely necessary, for the\r\nremaining canoes turned tail and paddled hurriedly for the shore.\r\n\r\nThe sharp and short conflict was ended by the return of the two\r\nfriendly canoes, whose crews, with true savage instinct, completed the\r\nwork of destruction by spearing every man whose head remained above\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Capitally done, Ellerton!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.  \"You--Why, what's the\r\nmatter with the lad?\"\r\n\r\nThe lad's face had turned a ghastly greyish hue, and only Andy's prompt\r\naction saved him from falling upon the grating of the cockpit.\r\n\r\n\"Look!  He's hit!\" said Andy, pointing to Ellerton's left arm, which\r\nhad hitherto been concealed.\r\n\r\nIn a trice Mr. McKay cut away the wounded youth's shirt-sleeve.  The\r\narrow had gone through the fleshy part of his forearm, the barb\r\nprojecting quite a couple of inches.\r\n\r\n\"Hold his arm as firmly as you can,\" said Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nThen, grasping the haft of the missile, he dexterously snapped it in\r\ntwo.  In spite of his care and skill, the slight motion caused the lad\r\nto utter a groan; but the worst was still to come.\r\n\r\nLubricating the broken shaft with some cocoanut oil, Mr. McKay told\r\nAndy and Terence to hold Ellerton's arm tightly, so as to compress the\r\nveins and arteries, and consequently numb the limb.  Then with a rapid\r\nand deliberate motion he laid hold of the barbed end and drew the\r\nfragment of the missile through the wound.  With a low moan Ellerton\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't be better,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"Now, lads, take him into\r\nthe cabin, and start the stove as fast as you can.  I'm afraid the\r\narrow is poisoned.\"\r\n\r\nAndy and Terence lifted their comrade upon one of the bunks opposite to\r\nthat on which Quexo was peacefully slumbering.  Mr. McKay had given the\r\nmulatto a strong sleeping draught; he now took up a rifle, and,\r\nwithdrawing the cleaning rod, snapped it close to the \"worm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might take the helm, Blight,\" he remarked.  \"You know the course?\r\nI shall be busy for half an hour or so.\"\r\n\r\nBlight nodded.  Left alone, he gave a glimpse at the compass, put the\r\ntiller up till the vessel lay on her proper course, and motioned to the\r\ntwo canoes to follow.\r\n\r\nThen he resumed his meditations.  Everything seemed in his favour.\r\nHalf a dozen revolvers, thrown down after the fight, were within hand's\r\nreach.  In the cabin were two wounded persons and three totally\r\nunsuspecting unarmed men.  And close by were the two canoes containing\r\nhis coloured associates.  What could be easier?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA KNIFE-THRUST IN THE DARK\r\n\r\nMore than once Blight bent over the array of death-dealing weapons, but\r\non each occasion his nerve failed him.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as he was to deal swiftly with the natives, never hesitating\r\nto shoot down any black creature that thwarted him, he shrank from\r\ntackling his intended victims.\r\n\r\nNot from feelings of compunction did he pause; he was a coward at\r\nheart, and the thought of a possible failure filled him with a horrible\r\ndread.  So, nervously sawing at the tiller, he gnawed his lower lip and\r\nformed fresh plans for evil.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. McKay, unconscious of his peril, proceeded with his\r\npreparations.  He deeply regretted the fact that the case of surgical\r\ninstruments salved from the _San Martin_ was at that moment--like the\r\nDutchman's anchor--left at home, or rather on McKay's Island.  In the\r\nfinal hurry of embarkation that important item had been overlooked.\r\n\r\nGrasping the glowing portion of the cleaning rod, Mr. McKay approached\r\nthe unconscious lad.  Once more telling the other two lads to hold the\r\npatient's arm firmly, he inserted the red-hot metal into the wound.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a few seconds, but the operation of cauterising the\r\nwound was accomplished.  Time alone would tell whether this rude\r\nsurgery was a success or not.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the low-lying island of Ni Atong was in sight, and just\r\nbefore sunset the yawl and her two native consorts entered the lagoon.\r\n\r\nIt was a pitiful home-coming.  The miserable remnant of the fleet of\r\ncanoes told the tale, and already the beach was lined with a crowd of\r\nwailing women and crying children, with a sprinkling of old men, whose\r\nservices had been dispensed with on the fatal expedition.\r\n\r\nThe latter had good cause for being cast down.\r\n\r\nIn many of the Pacific Islands old age is looked upon as a useless\r\nqualification, and, failing a crowd of prisoners to serve as sacrifices\r\nand to appease the warriors' appetites, it was their aged and infirm\r\nfellow-tribesmen who were doomed to die to keep the angry gods\r\ngood-tempered.\r\n\r\n\"Coming ashore, boss?\" asked Blight, as if he did not care one way or\r\nthe other.  \"I can give you a shakedown in my hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we cannot manage it,\" was the reply.  \"You see, with our\r\ntwo patients it is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!  Maybe it will be best, 'specially as them natives are\r\ngoing to have a bit of a bust-up to-night.  You mayn't like it, though\r\nI'm used to it.  When do you set sail for your own island?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow at dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay looked up sharply.  There was a strange sound about that\r\n\"Oh!\"  The ex-pearler realised that the exclamation was a weak\r\nexpression of regret, and hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n\"I thought as how you would be wanting fresh water, 'specially for your\r\ntwo young chaps.  Make a day of it, and have a spell ashore.  One more\r\nday won't make no difference like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly not,\" assented Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Then there are yams and plantains.  They'll be rare good for feverish\r\nfellows.  You're welcome, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see what the others say.  So now, Blight, my son can row you\r\nashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a present, isn't it, boss?\" asked Blight, pointing to the\r\nrevolver that he had used to such good purpose at Ahii.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I gave it you,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nBlight picked up the weapon and thrust it with assumed carelessness\r\ninto his belt; then, bidding the crew of the yawl good night, he\r\nstepped into the dinghy.\r\n\r\nHardly had the sun set, than the wearied crew retired to the cabin for\r\nrest and refreshment.\r\n\r\nEllerton was awake, feverish, and at intervals in great pain.  Quexo\r\nstill slumbered.  Andy and Terence were sleepily nodding their heads in\r\nan almost vain endeavour to keep awake.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, though utterly done up, announced his intention of keeping\r\nwatch on deck the moment he had finished supper.\r\n\r\nJust as the moon rose, a blood-curdling roar came from the island.\r\nInstantly the two McKays and Terence rushed on deck.  Fires gleamed in\r\nthe centre of the wretched village, and around the flames danced a\r\nhundred natives, yelling, screaming, and invoking their idols.\r\n\r\n\"What are they up to, pater?\" asked Andy, as his father scanned the\r\nshore with a pair of night-glasses.  \"Let me have a look when you've\r\nfinished.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better not,\" was the reply.  \"Take my word for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe lads understood.  They were fairly well acquainted with the hideous\r\norgies that are practised on these islands.\r\n\r\n\"And to think we helped those villains,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" admitted his father, \"it was, as I said before, the only course\r\nopen to us.  Now, I think all danger is past.  They are not strong\r\nenough to attempt to seize our island, so we can go back with easy\r\nminds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" returned his son.  \"But my word, it's cost us something!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand that chap Blight,\" said Terence.  \"He seemed mighty\r\ncurious to know how many of us lived on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!  I let the cat out of the bag, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did?\" replied Mi.  McKay gravely.  \"I'm sorry; but perhaps there's\r\nno harm done.  However, we'll set sail to-morrow morning in any case.\r\nI, for one, will not be sorry to say good-bye to Mr. Blight.  Now,\r\nlads, you must turn in.  I'll be all right here; and to-morrow, all\r\nbeing well, I'll make up arrears of sleep.\"\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Mr. McKay sat in the cockpit and watched the orgies\r\nashore till the fires died out and the sounds of the worshippers\r\nceased.  Half-an-hour later he appeared, to all intents and purposes,\r\nto be lying in the stern sheets fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAt about three in the morning the moon, now high in the heavens, threw\r\nher beams upon a strange drama.\r\n\r\nSwimming with eel-like swiftness and silence towards the unguarded yawl\r\ncame three men.  Two were natives, the third a white man, and each had\r\na glittering knife betwixt his teeth.\r\n\r\nGrasping the boat's stern, Blight (for it was he) listened intently.\r\nThen, hearing only the sounds of deep slumber arising from the cabin,\r\nhe cautiously placed his foot over the bobstay, and with slow and\r\nstealthy movement hoisted himself clear of the water.\r\n\r\nHaving made sure that the deck was deserted, he climbed softly upon the\r\nfo'c'sle and proceeded to unfasten his revolver, which he had secured\r\nto the top of his head by means of a strip of cocoa fibre.\r\n\r\nPresently he was joined by one of the natives, and at a short interval\r\nby the second.  Creeping towards the open skylight the miscreant\r\nlistened once more.  The loud ticking of the cabin chronometer and the\r\ndeep, regular breathing of the sleepers, alone broke the stillness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Blight perceived Mr. McKay's form lying with his head buried\r\nin his arm upon one of the seats of the cockpit.  This was awkward.  He\r\nraised his revolver, then reflected that ere he could reach the cabin\r\nafter firing the fatal shot the occupants would be aroused.\r\n\r\nSprawling full length upon the cabin-top, Blight watched the slumbering\r\nvictim with considerable misgivings, till realising that Mr. McKay was\r\nsound asleep, he raised himself upon his elbow, and beckoned to the two\r\nnatives.  Uplifting his knife, Blight made an imaginary thrust, then\r\npointed meaningly towards the sleeper.\r\n\r\nJust then a shark glided past the boat at barely an oar's length.\r\nRising to the surface it turned on its back and snapped at some\r\nfloating object.  The sharp, almost metallic snap of those powerful\r\njaws filled the would-be murderer with alarm.  He realised that the\r\nsleeper might awake, and also that his own retreat was cut off.\r\n\r\nThe sweat poured in torrents from his brow and ran down his chalky\r\ncheeks.  But the sleeping man stirred not.\r\n\r\nReassured, Blight again signed to the natives.  Knife in hand the two\r\nglided along the narrow waterways, dropping noiselessly into the\r\ncockpit, and crept towards their unsuspecting prey.\r\n\r\nBlight, revolver in hand, followed, stopping by the side of the cabin\r\nbulkhead, ready to dive into the cabin and complete the murderous\r\nbusiness the moment the fatal blow was struck.\r\n\r\nLike panthers the two natives launched themselves upon their victim,\r\ntheir knives flashed in the moonlight; the next instant they were\r\nburied to the hilt in the body of the sleeper.\r\n\r\nEre the weapons could be withdrawn, two shots rang out in quick\r\nsuccession.  One of the natives fell face foremost across the coaming\r\nof the cockpit, the other gave a spring and plunged lifeless into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThen, before Blight could realise the sudden turn of affairs, he felt\r\nthe contact of the muzzle of a smoking revolver against his temple.\r\n\r\n\"Hands up, Blight!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay resolutely.\r\n\r\nThe would-be murderer's weapon fell from his nerveless grasp and\r\nimmediately his hands were raised high above his head.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the firing had aroused the sleeping inmates of the cabin,\r\nand Andy, Terence, and even Ellerton rushed through the narrow doorway\r\ninto the well.\r\n\r\n\"Get hold of a few pieces of lashing and secure the rascal,\" said Mr.\r\nMcKay calmly.\r\n\r\n\"You are not hurt?\" asked his son anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt?  Not a bit of it.  No thanks to this beauty, though.  See!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, still keeping the weapon at the would-be assassin's head, he\r\npointed to the made-up figure of himself, in which the hilts of the two\r\nknives glittered in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAndy and Terence lost no time in securing the ankles of the prisoner.\r\nThen ordering him to lower his hands, the lads deftly lashed his elbows\r\ntogether behind his back.\r\n\r\n\"So, Mr. James Blight, alias 'Chinese Pork,' I find your delightful\r\ncharacter has undergone little change during the last twenty years.\r\nOne would have thought that your unpleasant experiences in connection\r\nwith the _Sea Belle_----\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'ye mean?\" gasped the prisoner, his eyes rolling heavily in his\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you not to interrupt.  A connection with the _Sea Belle_ would\r\nhave taught anyone but an utter villain or a fool a lifelong lesson.  I\r\nwill pass over those minor affairs at Boni Harbour and Fortescue\r\nStrait, though by mentioning them you can realise that I know a good\r\ndeal of your former career.  What you've been doing since is of little\r\nconsequence, though I'll wager that your existence will not bear\r\ninvestigation.  Now, to complete your record, you've been caught in the\r\nact of attempting to treacherously slay your white--well, I won't say\r\nfriends.  Thanks to a merciful Providence, your schemes were thwarted.\r\nI am now going to keep you in custody till I can hand you over to\r\njustice at Brisbane, where you will have a fair trial and be allowed to\r\nanswer to a number of various crimes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay paused to note the effect of his accusation, then he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"I am going to keep you a close prisoner in the fo'c'sle till we return\r\nto our island.  You will then be kept in confinement ashore till such\r\ntime as we are able to reach some island under the control of a\r\nrecognised British governor.  Have you anything to say?\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-pearler maintained a sullen silence, and, without offering any\r\nresistance, he was carried into the fo'c'sle and locked in, there to\r\nmeditate on the fate in store for him.\r\n\r\n\"Ellerton, go back to your bunk.  You ought not to be here,\" exclaimed\r\nMr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"But I feel all right again,\" replied the youth.\r\n\r\n\"Probably you do, but with your arm in that state absolute rest is\r\nessential.  So go.  Andy, we've had enough of this island, so let's\r\nclap on all sail and shape a course for home.\"\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight the entrance through the reef was plainly visible.\r\nThere was a favourable breeze, so that the yawl could lay on her course\r\nwithout having to tack.\r\n\r\nAs the anchor rose, a long-drawn chorus of shouts of rage came from the\r\nbeach, and a swarm of arrows, all of which fell short, hurtled through\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"So much for our native allies,\" observed Mr. McKay.  \"They are all in\r\nthe swim in this business.  No matter, they can do us no harm.\"\r\n\r\nTo the accompaniment of a farewell shout of anger from the baffled\r\ninhabitants of Ni Atong, the yawl glided swiftly across the moonlit sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE GALE\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the stiff little craft gallantly breasted the\r\nwaves, making a much better passage than she had done on her outward\r\nvoyage, and at sunrise the highest peak of McKay's Island appeared\r\nabove the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut with the rising of the sun the wind increased in force, and an hour\r\nlater it was blowing half a gale, and dead astern.\r\n\r\nTrembling on the crest of a huge wave, then sliding with a sickening\r\nsensation down the green slope into the trough, the little craft held\r\non her course, steered by Andy's sinewy arm.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, unable to keep his eyes open, lay deep in slumber upon one\r\nof the bunks.\r\n\r\nEllerton, propped up by cushions, was kept awake by the motion of the\r\nboat, every lurch causing his wound to pain horribly.\r\n\r\n\"Another couple of hours will find us home, Hoppy, old man,\" exclaimed\r\nTerence cheerily, as he entered the cabin.  \"But it does blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I should think,\" replied Ellerton.  \"But how is she behaving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a cork; we've only had the tail end of a couple of seas aboard.\r\nWell, cheer up!  Make yourself at home and wish you were,\" and with\r\nthis pleasantry Terence returned to keep Andy company.\r\n\r\nEach time the yawl breasted the summit of a wave, the peak of McKay's\r\nIsland could be seen rearing its head above the waste of storm-tossed\r\nwaters.  Each time it did so it appeared to be getting nearer.\r\n\r\nAndy knew that there was danger ahead, but he forebore to mention the\r\nfact to his chum.\r\n\r\nThe \"back-wash\" from the terrible reef, with its accompaniment of a\r\ntumble of dangerous cross-seas, had to be encountered, and the risky\r\npassage through the coral barrier made at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor half-an-hour more the seas, though high, were comparatively\r\nregular, but at the expiration of that time the dinghy, which was being\r\ntowed astern, was filled by a vicious comber.  The dead weight of the\r\nwater-logged craft caused the stout painter to snap like pack-thread,\r\nand the next instant the tender was lost to view in the turmoil of\r\nfoaming water.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we go back for her?\" shouted Terence, for the howling of the\r\nwind made ordinary conversation inaudible.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" replied his chum.  \"She would be swamped before we hauled\r\nto the wind.  Besides, the dinghy's done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a rotten look-out.  We shall miss her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented Andy.  \"But it can't be helped.  Look here, Terence,\r\nnow we are going through a patch of broken water.  I can see it a mile\r\nor so ahead.  We may have a few seas on board, so lash yourself to this\r\ncleat and stand by with the bucket.  You may have to bale for all\r\nyou're worth.\"\r\n\r\nTerence closed the cabin-doors.  Fortunately they were close-fitting\r\nand comparatively watertight; but, on the other hand, the cockpit was\r\nnot a self-emptying one.  Whatever quantity of water broke over had to\r\nbe baled out.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have one of those cans of kerosene out of that locker,\"\r\ncontinued Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Going to start the motor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; to throw oil on the sea.  Kerosene's not very heavy, but it's all\r\nwe have.  Now, stand by, here it comes.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a mile now separated the yawl from the entrance to the lagoon of\r\nMcKay's Island, but every yard of that mile was beset with dangers.\r\n\r\nAndy gripped the tiller, and braced himself for the ordeal.  He had\r\nbeen the chief workman in the task of converting the boat into her\r\npresent form, and now his handiwork was to be put to the test.  A\r\nfaulty piece of wood, a defective screw, an unsound rope--and their\r\nlives would have to answer for it.\r\n\r\nWith a dull roar a white-crested wave broke over the fore-deck, burying\r\nthe little yawl as far as the mainmast; then ere she could recover\r\nherself another comber came like a cataract over the lee quarter.  Well\r\nit was that both lads had taken the precaution of lashing themselves\r\non, otherwise they might have been swept clean out of the well.\r\n\r\nAndy, wellnigh breathless--for he had been hit in the side by the\r\ntiller as the boat attempted to broach to--retained sufficient presence\r\nof mind to thrust the helm up and enable the craft to meet the next\r\nfollowing wave stern on.\r\n\r\n\"Bale!\" he shouted.  \"Bale for your life!\" and seizing the kerosene can\r\nthat was floating from side to side of the cockpit, he splayed a\r\nquantity of oil over each quarter.\r\n\r\nTerence, who was thrown in every direction as far as his tether would\r\nallow, struggled manfully with the bucket, but could hardly cope with\r\nthe frequent showers of spray that literally played over the boat from\r\nevery point of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe helmsman noticed, with feelings of deepest concern, that the yawl\r\nhad made considerable headway since entering the zone of broken water,\r\nand it would be touch-and-go whether they could avoid being carried on\r\nto the lee side of the coral reef.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly high tide, and the cruel ridges were covered,\r\nalthough in the trough of the heavier waves the jagged lines of\r\nglistening coral showed themselves above the smother of foam.\r\n\r\nAndy tried his best to keep the boat's head towards the channel, but in\r\nvain.  She had lost ground, and was driving straight for the reef.  One\r\nchance alone remained.  He must put the yawl about and endeavour to\r\nclaw-off the treacherous reef.\r\n\r\nLike a top the little craft responded to the shift of the helm.  For a\r\nfew brief seconds the reefed head-sail slatted violently in the howling\r\nwind; then, to the accompaniment of another tremendous sea, the yawl\r\nstaggered on her fresh course.\r\n\r\nAndy's idea was to sail round to the lee side of the island and cruise\r\nabout in the shelter of the reef till the gale moderated; but a few\r\nmoments sufficed to show him that the spread of canvas--already as much\r\nas the vessel could carry--was not sufficient to take her to windward.\r\nShe was drifting broadside on to the reef.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Terry!\" he shouted.  \"Tell them to stand by and make a rush\r\ndirectly you open the cabin door.  The yawl's done for.  She'll be\r\nsmashed to splinters in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay received the appalling intelligence fairly calmly.  He at\r\nonce proceeded to fasten a lifebelt round Ellerton's practically\r\nhelpless form, and then did a like service to Quexo.  Nor did he forget\r\nthe prisoner, Blight.  But, on sliding back the fo'c'sle hatch, he\r\nfound the man lying senseless on the floor.  Either he had fainted\r\nthrough sheer fright, or he had been stunned by being thrown against\r\none of the lockers, and bound hand and foot, had been unable to help\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBlight was no feather-weight, but in spite of the plunging and rolling\r\nof the doomed craft, Mr. McKay gripped him with one hand and dragged\r\nhis senseless body into the cabin.  Then, cutting his bonds, he\r\ncompleted his work of mercy by lashing the sole remaining lifebelt\r\nround the body of his would-be murderer.\r\n\r\n\"You've nothing to put on,\" gasped Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"True; but I have my strength,\" was the reply, as Mr. McKay stealthily\r\ngirded on a leather belt in which hung a formidable sheath-knife.  It\r\nwas not the thought of being cast on the waters that troubled him.\r\nDeath, should it come, would be swift and merciful.  But should they\r\nsurvive the dangers of the reef there was the probability of far\r\ngreater peril.\r\n\r\nThough he forbore to mention the fact to Ellerton, Mr. McKay thought of\r\nthe sharks, and with a fervent unspoken prayer to save them from these\r\ncreatures, he stood ready for the cabin door to be opened.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Terence and Andy had cut themselves free from their lashings.\r\nTwenty yards away the reef showed its teeth as if waiting for its prey.\r\n\r\nThen with a noise like the rattle of musketry, which drowned the\r\nthunder of the breakers, the staysail burst asunder, and the yawl, in\r\nspite of the helmsman's efforts, flew up into the wind.\r\n\r\nDown in the trough of a murderous sea she sank.  A rapid glance astern\r\nshowed the glistening reef towering several feet above the little\r\ncraft, the white foam pouring down the honeycombed ridges as if the\r\nrock were baring itself to strike a harder blow.\r\n\r\n\"The door!\" gasped Andy, as a gigantic roller bore down upon the reef.\r\n\r\nTerence unfastened the cabin door, and as Mr. McKay appeared, holding\r\nEllerton and Quexo in his powerful grip, the yawl seemed to stand on\r\nend.  Then, borne on the breast of the roller, the little craft was\r\ntossed like a cork right over the rocks, her keel scraping the lee side\r\nof the reef by barely a yard!\r\n\r\nThe next instant the vessel was rolling sluggishly in the sullen swell\r\nwithin the lagoon, with two feet of water in her cabin, yet still\r\nafloat and in comparative safety.\r\n\r\n\"Don't wait to bale out!\" shouted Andy.  \"You take the helm, pater.\r\nRun her up into the wind and we'll anchor.\"\r\n\r\nThe ground swell inside the lagoon was too great to allow the yawl to\r\nrun alongside the usual jetty.  They would have to wait till low tide,\r\nwhen the reef would be sufficiently exposed to serve as a breakwater.\r\n\r\nQuickly Andy and Terence made their way for'ard to let go the anchor.\r\n\r\nWhen within a couple of hundred yards of the beach the yawl was again\r\nput head to wind, and with a splash the anchor plunged to the bottom of\r\nthe lagoon.  But just as Andy was checking the out-rushing cable, a\r\nsudden blow from the staysail caught him unawares, and the next instant\r\nhe was struggling in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe waves carried the lad clear of the vessel, and in spite of his\r\nutmost efforts he was unable to regain the boat.  His father hurled a\r\ncoil of rope, but the line, being wet, became entangled and fell short.\r\n\r\nAndy saw that it was impossible to swim back, so with a cheery wave of\r\nhis arm he pointed towards the surf-beaten shore, and immediately\r\nstruck out for land.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Mr. McKay intended to plunge into the sea and accompany\r\nhis son on his perilous swim, till the thought of the possibility of\r\nBlight recovering his senses occurred to him.  With Ellerton and Quexo\r\ndisabled, the margin of safety was not sufficient when only Terence\r\nremained to guard the prisoner.\r\n\r\nBoth lads were surprised to see Mr. McKay rush into the flooded cabin\r\nand return with a rifle and a belt of ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"Don't alarm him,\" said Andy's father hurriedly.  \"But there may be\r\nsharks about.\"\r\n\r\nPlacing the rifle on the fo'c'sle of the heaving vessel, Mr. McKay\r\nwatched the progress of the swimmer with the greatest concern, at the\r\nsame time keeping a sharp look-out for the expected appearance of the\r\ndreaded dorsal fin of one of the tigers of the deep.\r\n\r\nSteadily Andy swam shorewards, keeping up a slow yet powerful side\r\nstroke.  Now he was in the grip of the ground swell.  Once his feet\r\ntouched bottom, but ere he could obtain a firm footing the \"undertow\"\r\nswept him backwards.\r\n\r\nThe next instant he was lost to sight in a white-capped roller.  The\r\nwave broke, then receded, but to the alarm of the anxious watchers\r\nthere were no signs of the swimmer.\r\n\r\nQuickly the wide expanse of sand uncovered; then, just as another\r\nbreaker was preparing to launch itself upon the beach, Andy sprang to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nKnee-deep in water he rushed up the shelving shore, and managed to\r\ngrasp a ledge of rock ere he was again overwhelmed by the mighty\r\ntorrent.  Fortunately he was able to retain his grasp, and directly the\r\nrock uncovered he ran beyond the reach of the waves and sank exhausted\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be all right in a minute,\" said Mr. McKay with a sigh of relief.\r\n\"Now, Ellerton, you had better stay here while we get rid of the water;\r\nthe bunks must be saturated.  Come on, Terence, we've been through a\r\ngreat deal, and now, thank God, we are safely home; but all the same,\r\nwe've plenty of work to do.\"\r\n\r\nThus exhorted, Terence assisted Mr. McKay to lower and stow the\r\nmainsail and secure the fragment of the head sail that had caused so\r\nmuch mischief.\r\n\r\nThis done, they plied buckets and balers till the level of the water\r\nthey had shipped sank well beneath the floor-boards of the cabin.  The\r\nyawl was no longer sluggish, but rose buoyantly as each roller passed\r\nunder her.\r\n\r\n\"This is the second gale from this quarter,\" remarked Mr. McKay, as\r\nthey were partaking of a hastily cooked meal.  \"It's taught me a\r\nlesson.  Had our boat been in her usual dock she would have been dashed\r\nto pieces.  At the first opportunity we'll lay down a heavy set of\r\nmoorings and keep her afloat.  Here, thanks to the reef, the seas can\r\nnever be really dangerous, though on shore they break heavily.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall we be able to land, do you think?\" asked Terence, for the\r\nshort, sharp motion of the boat as she pitched at her cable was\r\nbeginning to prove distressing, both to him and Quexo.\r\n\r\n\"In a matter of three hours Andy will be able to launch the other\r\ntender.  We will then lay out another anchor, so as to make doubly\r\nsure, and get ashore.  Is Andy still on the beach?\"\r\n\r\nTerence went out of the cabin, and on returning reported that his chum\r\nwas ascending the cliff path.\r\n\r\n\"Now we'll secure this fellow Blight once more.  I see he's coming\r\nround,\" continued Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nPlacing the prisoner again in the fo'c'sle he did not attempt to secure\r\nhis arms and legs.  He merely tied the man's thumbs with a piece of\r\nstrong but fine cord, so that his arms were kept behind his back.\r\nUnless he attempted to struggle, the prisoner would feel but slight\r\ninconvenience, while this method was a perfect means of keeping him in\r\na state of utter helplessness.\r\n\r\nShortly after this was done Mr. McKay went on deck \"to have a look\r\nround.\"  Gazing landward, he saw Andy standing on the edge of the lower\r\nterrace, striving to attract his attention by means of a handkerchief\r\ntied to a stick.\r\n\r\n\"There's Andy calling me up in the Morse code,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"I\r\nwonder what's up?  Terence, will you please hand me over that\r\nsignalling flag from the for'ard port locker?\"\r\n\r\nAndy, though not an expert signaller, knew the Morse system fairly\r\nwell.  Slowly he transmitted the startling message:\r\n\r\n\"_The house has been broken into!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBACK TO THE ISLAND\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation Mr. McKay replied:\r\n\r\n\"Do not go to the house.  Remain on beach till you can launch boat.\"\r\n\r\nAndy gave the A.F., showing that he understood the signal, and\r\ndescending to the shore proceeded to divest himself of most of his\r\nsodden clothing.\r\n\r\n\"There's something amiss ashore, lads,\" explained Mr. McKay.  \"Andy's\r\njust informed me that the house has been broken into.  Of course, it\r\nmay be another unfortunate party of shipwrecked mariners, or a hurried\r\nvisit of the crew of a passing ship.  All I hope is that there are no\r\nnatives on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if any remained after the canoe left,\" remarked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Quite possible.  I never thought of that, by Jove!  They might have\r\nslipped away in the night in order to steal all they could lay their\r\nhands upon.  In that case there are only a few.  We may be able to hunt\r\nthem out without much trouble.  Still, I'm sorry it's happened.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the cabin Mr. McKay produced his pair of marine glasses.  After a\r\nprolonged examination he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the door is ajar.  I feel certain I closed it when I left.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon see what's amiss,\" said Terence.  \"See, the reef is\r\nuncovering and the wind is dropping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" assented Mr. McKay.  \"Andy will be able to put off in the\r\nboat in less than an hour.  Ellerton, I think you had better remain on\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of your arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of it.  Besides, I can use a revolver with my sound\r\nlimb if necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then; only don't blame me if anything goes wrong.  Quexo\r\nmust stay in any case.  There's no need to worry about Blight.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than the predicted time Andy succeeded in rowing the small boat\r\nsafely through the rapidly subsiding swell.  Directly he came\r\nalongside, Mr. McKay and the two lads slipped on board, and with no\r\ngreater inconvenience than a thorough drenching--to which they were now\r\nperfectly accustomed--the party landed at the natural quay at the foot\r\nof the path leading up to the house.\r\n\r\nEverything appeared quiet.  A hasty glance at the two storehouses on\r\nthe lower terrace revealed the astonishing discovery that nothing had\r\nbeen disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.  \"One would have thought that these\r\nwould be the first places to be ransacked.  Now, carefully, lads!  Keep\r\nyour firearms ready.\"\r\n\r\nCautiously they scaled the cliff path and gained the terrace on which\r\nthe house stood.  Still no signs of human beings, except that the door\r\nwas half open.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay knocked quietly, then, pushing open the door, he entered.  A\r\nstrange sight met his gaze.  Everything movable had been upset or\r\npushed out of place; the floor of the living-room was littered with\r\nbedding and the fragments of earthenware vessels.\r\n\r\n\"The brutes!\" ejaculated Mr. McKay savagely.  \"They've capsized\r\neverything out of sheer mischief.  I hope I'll be able to lay my hands\r\non them.\"\r\n\r\nThe lads, not without feeling of mysterious awe at the scene of wanton\r\ndesolation, crossed the floor of the room and entered the sleeping\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nHere the state of confusion was, if possible, greater than in the outer\r\napartment; but a clue to the mystery was afforded by the discovery of\r\nthe dead body of a sheep, its head wedged in between the bars of a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Andy, \"the sheep have broken out of their pasture!\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father.  \"They managed to find their way into the\r\nhouse, though how I cannot imagine.  Something must have frightened\r\nthem and there was a mad stampede.  This poor brute contrived to get\r\nhis head jammed in the chair, and in his struggles he broke his neck.\r\nWe've had a rare fright, but, after all, there's nothing of consequence\r\nthat cannot be set right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better get Quexo ashore before it gets dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, and Blight as well.  I think the best place we can put him\r\nis in the small store.  He'll be all right for one night, though I'm\r\nsorry to keep him bound.\"\r\n\r\n\"The treacherous reptile deserves no consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Andy, we are not Nicaraguan revolutionaries.  So long as he\r\nremains our prisoner we ought to treat him with the same amount of\r\nconsideration that any other British criminal receives while awaiting\r\ntrial.  To-morrow we must find a place better suited for his reception.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the farthermost cave, the one beyond those where we've stowed\r\nthe dynamite,\" observed Andy.  \"There's not much in it at present; we\r\ncan build a partition over the opening and make a door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will be far more comfortable than his quarters in Ni Atong.\r\nWe'll make a start to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Mr. McKay and his son put off in the dinghy--which, by the\r\nway, was the larger though more awkwardly-shaped part of the _San\r\nMartin's_ gig--and transferred Quexo to the shore.  The poor fellow was\r\nin a bad state, though his wound showed no signs of complications.\r\nEllerton had had his hurts attended to as soon as the house was set in\r\norder.  Beyond the inflammation caused by the searing-iron, his wound\r\ngave no reason for undue anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, out you come,\" ordered Mr. McKay sternly, as Andy and he,\r\narmed in case of emergency, returned to the yawl.\r\n\r\nBlight obeyed.  Indeed, there was no option.  His face was a picture of\r\nutter cowardice and terror.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't going to shoot me?\" he whined.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"I've already told you what I intend to do\r\nwith you.  So long as you behave yourself you'll be treated\r\nproperly--far better than you deserve.\"\r\n\r\nWith that the would-be assassin took his place in the boat, Mr. McKay\r\nseated beside him with a revolver in his hand, while Andy rowed.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the shore the captive's eyes were bandaged, and, still\r\nsecured by his thumbs, he was led up to the first terrace and placed in\r\nthe storehouse.  Mr. McKay then severed the cord that bound him, the\r\ndoor was locked, and the rogue left to his own reflections.\r\n\r\nThe following day was an exceptionally busy one.  Ellerton, being\r\nunable to do any hard work, was dispatched into the grove to \"round up\"\r\nthe sheep, while the three sound members of the establishment, after\r\nhaving conveyed the prisoner his food and water, set off for the cave\r\nthat was to be prepared for his quarters.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on the extreme end of the upper terrace, where the\r\nlevel stretch of ground tapered away till it ended in the sheer face of\r\na high precipice.\r\n\r\nOutside the mouth of the cave was a belt of grass land about ten yards\r\nin width, the cliff falling to a depth of about seventy feet, while\r\nabove the cave the rocks, too smooth to afford a foothold, towered to\r\nnearly a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe cave was quite fifty feet in depth, and averaged ten feet in width,\r\nwhile its height in places was over twenty feet.  Its entrance,\r\nhowever, was barely four feet wide and six in height.\r\n\r\n\"There won't be much light for the poor beggar when once we've inclosed\r\nthe entrance,\" remarked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" replied his father.  \"I really don't see why we couldn't\r\ninclose a strip of land between the two cliffs, and let him have the\r\nrun of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How inclose it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we can spare enough of the galvanised iron sheeting to make an\r\nunclimbable fence.  Each sheet is ten feet in height, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll make a start.  Although we cannot possibly hope to complete\r\nthe work to-day, we may reasonably expect to finish it to-morrow\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil proved to be fairly soft, so that it was necessary to sink the\r\nbase of the iron sheets at least two feet into the ground.  Strong\r\ntimber uprights with cross-braces of railway iron served to make the\r\nfence secure, a doorway being left to afford means of communication\r\nwith the prisoner's quarters.\r\n\r\n\"I think we have taken every possible precaution,\" remarked Mr. McKay,\r\nafter the fence was completed and the bedding and the other necessary\r\narticles for the ex-pearler's use had been placed in the cave.  \"Of\r\ncourse, this business entails a considerable amount of extra work, for\r\nbesides the feeding arrangements we must make a thorough examination of\r\nthe fence every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  He cannot possibly pull it down, and I'm sure he will not be\r\nable to scale the wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are at least two ways he might manage to escape.  He could\r\neither burrow under the fence, or he might manage to spring from the\r\ntop of a pile of furniture on to the upper edge of the wall.  If we\r\nmake a point of examining both sides of the fence twice a day, we shall\r\nbe able to detect any sign of a tunnel; while it is unlikely that an\r\neffort to scale the wall will meet with any success, for the edge of\r\nthe iron sheets is sharp enough to cut through his hands should he make\r\na leap at it.  I'll talk to him pretty straight and let him know what\r\nto expect if he does manage to escape, though, at the same time, it\r\nwill be an anxious business for us while he's at large--if he's fool\r\nenough to try it.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening Blight was conducted to his new quarters, duly cautioned\r\nas to his behaviour, and safely locked up; and from that day the\r\n\"prison yard,\" as Terence termed it, was carefully examined night and\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIt was, as Mr. McKay predicted, a severe strain on their time, for to\r\nguard against a surprise it was necessary that two people, armed in\r\ncase of emergency, should make a visit to the prisoner twice daily.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity a strong set of moorings was laid down off the\r\nlittle stone quay, sufficiently clear of the shore to be out of the\r\nrange of breaking rollers.  Here the yawl was to make her future berth,\r\nthe dinghy being kept on the beach well beyond the reach of the tide.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to make a trip at an early date to the Marquesas, there\r\nto hand over the criminal into the charge of the British Consular Agent.\r\n\r\nThe planning of this voyage necessitated much thought, for Mr. McKay\r\nwas loath to abandon the island entirely.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand he did not like to let Andy and Ellerton make the\r\nvoyage with the prisoner; on the other, he did not like to leave\r\nTerence and Quexo, and, perhaps, Andy, alone on the island.\r\n\r\n\"I have been wondering,\" he remarked, \"whether my brother and your five\r\ncousins would care to join us.  There are boundless possibilities in\r\nthe place, and I don't think they would mind a change.  Once we have a\r\nfew more members of the little colony, we can spare a few months to\r\nvisit our respective homes.  Ellerton, I know, would be pleased to see\r\nEngland again.  And you, Terence, would you not like to return to 'Our\r\nLady of the Snows'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!\" replied Ellerton.  \"I should be awfully glad to see my people\r\nagain; but, I must admit, I haven't had enough of McKay's Island.  I\r\nshould like to spend a great deal of my life here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, too,\" added Terence.\r\n\r\n\"Gently, lads, gently!\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"You must remember that,\r\nalthough the island can be made self-supporting--for there's tons of\r\ncopra to be had, and I have no doubt that the bed of the lagoon is\r\ncovered with pearl oysters--the idea of living here is not altogether\r\nfavourable.  It wouldn't be good for us to have only each other's\r\ncompany for long.  I'll not deny that this open-air, free-and-easy life\r\nis splendid from a physical point of view, but isolation tends to\r\ndestroy one's mental powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you advise me to get away from the island as soon as I can, and\r\nnever return to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  You misunderstood me, Ellerton.  The island is as much\r\nyours as it is mine, or Terence's.  What I meant to imply was that once\r\nwe can open up communication with the regular ports of call, so that we\r\ncan leave whenever we wish to, the better it will be for all of us.\r\nBut once abandon the island it becomes the property of the next comer.\r\nTo put the matter briefly, I intend to sit tight here; but should any\r\nof you go away for, say, even three or four years, you will be welcome\r\nto return and secure your part of the commonwealth--such as it is.\"\r\n\r\nFinally it was decided that Blight should be kept on the island for the\r\npresent, and that Ellerton and Andy should attempt to navigate the yawl\r\nto the Society Islands, communicate with their friends at home, and\r\nalso write to the Agent at Fiji requesting that a British gunboat be\r\ndispatched to ratify the annexation of McKay's Island.\r\n\r\nThey could then return and await events.\r\n\r\nA week or more passed.  Preparations for the voyage were pushed\r\nforward, and at length everything was ready for the lads' adventurous\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, turn in early, for you may not get a good night's rest for\r\nsome days,\" observed Mr. McKay, on the evening prior to the day fixed\r\nfor their departure.\r\n\r\nThe advice was acted upon, but Ellerton could not sleep.  The night was\r\nsultry, not a breath of wind rustled the leaves of the palm-trees.\r\nMosquitoes buzzed in and out of the room, while without the glow of the\r\nfire-flies betokened a spell of fine weather.\r\n\r\nUneasily the lad tossed from side to side on his bed.  A stray mosquito\r\nmanaged to pass the meshes of the mosquito-net, and settled down to\r\nbusiness, his object of attack being the lad's nose.\r\n\r\nEllerton knew that rest could only be obtained by killing the insect,\r\nso sitting up he began his plan of campaign.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his ear caught the sound of the long-drawn shriek of a\r\nconcertina, followed by a chorus of shouts and exclamations of surprise.\r\n\r\nIn an instant he was out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up!  Wake up!\" he shouted, shaking the heavy sleepers with\r\nunsparing hand.  \"The savages are upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE FOR THE INVADERS\r\n\r\nHastily throwing on portions of their clothing and seizing their rifles\r\nand revolvers, which, by a general custom, were in variably kept\r\nloaded, the four white men prepared to dash out of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Don't show a light on any account,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.  \"We must let\r\nthe storehouses go and hold this terrace.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a complete surprise.  The natives, who had wrested Ahii from its\r\nformer owners, had followed up their success in driving off the\r\ninvaders by paying a return visit to Ni Atong.  The population of that\r\nisland had either been killed or reserved for a more lingering death,\r\nand from one of the latter their captors learnt of the existence of\r\nMcKay's Island and its wealth of metal goods so prized by the South Sea\r\nIslanders.\r\n\r\nAccordingly ten large canoes set out on an expedition to raid the white\r\nmen's dwelling.\r\n\r\nArriving within sight of the peak of the island, they kept in the\r\noffing till night, then with torches blazing aloft they found the\r\npassage into the lagoon, and, paddling rapidly, landed on the beach\r\nbelow the settlement.\r\n\r\nThereupon three hundred powerful savages, armed with club, bow, spear,\r\nand knife, and bearing torches, began the ascent of the path that led\r\nto the three terraces.\r\n\r\nThe lower storehouse was their first discovery.  Quickly finding that\r\nno white men were within, the host of warriors resumed their advance.\r\nSome, however, tempted by the various articles stored in the building,\r\nbegan to help themselves.\r\n\r\nThen it was that a savage laid hold of the concertina that Ellerton had\r\nbrought from the wreck and had hitherto been left neglected in the\r\nstore.  The native was examining his prize in the torchlight, when,\r\nhappening to come into collision with another plunderer, the concertina\r\ngave out a startling screech as if to atone for its days of idleness.\r\n\r\nDropping the musical instrument of torture like a live coal, the savage\r\nrushed from the building, his yells of terror being taken up by his\r\ncompanions.  This diversion was the cause of alarming Ellerton, and\r\nconsequently saving the inhabitants of McKay's Island from a massacre.\r\n\r\n\"Aim low, lads!\" shouted Mr. McKay.  \"Let 'em have it!\"\r\n\r\nThe conflict was short and sharp.  Although many of the attackers got\r\nwithin throwing distance, not a single native succeeded in gaining the\r\ntop of the steep and narrow path.\r\n\r\nThey fled hurriedly to the shore, where they rallied to await the dawn.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone hurt?\" inquired Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nThere was a general reply in the negative, though in the heat of the\r\nfiring there had been several narrow escapes, for the ground was\r\nbristling with spears and littered with stones, which, had they struck\r\nanyone, would have caused serious if not fatal wounds.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement Ellerton had forgotten his crippled arm, and had used\r\na rifle equally as well as his comrades; but the exertion had caused\r\nthe blood to flow afresh.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten luck, I call it,\" he grumbled as Andy readjusted the bandage.\r\n\"You must load at least a dozen revolvers for me.  Thank goodness it's\r\nmy left arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a fair surprise,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"We've our work cut out to\r\ndrive them off.  Won't they play old Harry with the storehouse--and the\r\nyawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Andy in dismay, at the thought of his particular\r\ntreasure being in the hands of the savages.  \"Whatever can be done to\r\nsave it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, I'm afraid,\" replied his father.  \"Perhaps if the mischief is\r\nnot already done and the vessel holed, we can keep them off with a long\r\nrange fire, though I can hold out no strong hopes in that direction.\r\nThe plain truth is, that we are in a tight corner, and we must make the\r\nbest of it.\"\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the defenders kept silence, listening to the subdued\r\nsounds of their foes.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. McKay, \"it's no use sitting here and doing\r\nnothing.  Terence, will you go back to the house and bring three or\r\nfour spades?  We'll dig a shelter trench along the edge of the cliff so\r\nas to be able to command the path without unduly exposing ourselves to\r\nthe rascals.  Andy, you had better go with him and bring some more\r\nrifles and some ammunition.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the lads' return, the little band set to work to throw up their\r\ndefences, and barely had the work been completed ere the day broke.\r\n\r\n\"There are not so many of them after all,\" remarked Andy, when the full\r\nstrength of the attacking party was revealed.  \"We had greater odds at\r\nAhii.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a worse position,\" added his father.  \"We can hold out here, I\r\nfancy, but we cannot prevent the damage to our stores and gear.  See,\r\nthey've begun again.\"\r\n\r\nNumbers of the savages were engaged in looting the store, while others,\r\nto Andy's great disgust especially, had paddled off to where the yawl\r\nlay at her moorings.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Andy, setting the backsight of his rifle.  \"Eight\r\nhundred yards!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about the range,\" assented his father, and four rifles opened\r\nfire upon the daring natives, Ellerton contriving to rest the barrel of\r\nhis weapon upon the ridge of the earthwork, so as to avoid using his\r\ndamaged arm.\r\n\r\nThe bullets all fell close to the yawl, several of the natives being\r\nhit; but possibly in their hour of triumph the savages scorned the\r\nwhite men's weapons.  Casting off the moorings, they leisurely towed\r\nthe yawl out towards the reef and plundered her.\r\n\r\nGreat was the defenders' rage to see the blacks hacking at the rigging,\r\nsails, and cordage, throwing the contents of the cabin-lockers into the\r\nbottom of their canoe, and wrenching the metal cleats, hinges, and\r\nshroud-plates from her hull.  This done, a powerful savage stove a hole\r\nin the craft, and slowly sinking by the stern, she at length plunged to\r\nthe bottom of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard lines, Andy,\" exclaimed his father as he paused to recharge\r\nhis magazine.  \"But I'm afraid we shall have to make greater sacrifices\r\nbefore this affair is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"We seem to have horrible bad luck,\" replied Andy savagely.  \"First at\r\nAhii, and now here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember we were saved by the merciful intervention of One above,\"\r\nadded Mr. McKay.  \"And if it please Him, we'll come out of this in\r\nsafety.  We've had a lot to be thankful for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but all the same it's hard lines.  Take that, you brute!\" Andy\r\nadded, pressing the trigger.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid shot.  A group of natives had begun to batter the\r\nyawl's tender to splinters.  They were a good four hundred yards away,\r\nbut Andy's shot struck a tall savage, clad in a gorgeous cloak of white\r\nand red feathers, fairly between the shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\nAndy had laid aside his rifle immediately after discharging it, and had\r\nsnatched up a pair of field-glasses.  The effect of the chief's\r\ndeath--for a chief he evidently was--caused the wreckers to abandon\r\ntheir task, and they fled to join their fellows under the shelter of\r\nthe lowermost cliff.\r\n\r\n\"They are preparing for another rush,\" observed Terence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I wish we had a Maxim or two,\" replied Andy.  \"That would stop\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" exclaimed Ellerton.  \"I can best be spared, so I'll\r\nrun over to the caves and bring back a few sticks of dynamite and some\r\ndetonators.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!  Good!\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"You're a wonder, Hoppy.  Mind how\r\nyou come back, and don't stumble, or we won't be able to find even your\r\nfragments.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton set off on his self-imposed mission, and presently returned\r\nwith about fourteen pounds of dynamite and half a dozen time-fuses.\r\n\r\n\"What do you propose to do?\" asked Terence.  \"Make a bomb and roll it\r\nover the cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied the youth.  \"We can load up one of those trucks, set the\r\ntime-fuse, and turn the thing adrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will mean good-bye to our storehouse,\" observed Mr. McKay.  \"But\r\nthat cannot be helped, so let's to work; they'll be rushing us in a few\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nAt the top of the cable-railway stood three empty trucks.  In ordinary\r\ncircumstances these would be filled with water, and their increased\r\nweight would cause them to descend and, at the same time, bring up the\r\nloaded trucks from the shore or the storehouse.  Half-way down the\r\nline, and almost abreast of the building, were three other trucks,\r\nwaiting to be loaded should occasion require.  Around these trucks,\r\nwhich were invisible from the upper terrace, were most of the savages,\r\nwho were massing for the attack at the base of the second terrace.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite sure you can unshackle the thing easily?\" asked Mr.\r\nMcKay.  \"If there's a hitch we shall be the ones to be blown to\r\nsmithereens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make sure of it,\" replied Ellerton, and securing the lowermost of\r\nthe three trucks to the second one by means of a piece of rope, he\r\nunfastened the proper connecting shackles.\r\n\r\nThen placing the explosive in the truck he asked Mr. McKay to take the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"It's set for four minutes,\" he announced.  \"Half-a-minute will be\r\nquite enough, so at three and a half minutes from the time the fuse is\r\nlit I'll cut the rope and off she'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand back, you fellows!  If it goes wrong we need not all be blown\r\nsky-high.  Are you ready?  Stand by!\"\r\n\r\nThe fuse began to hiss and splutter.  Ellerton, knife in hand, kept his\r\neyes fixed on Mr. McKay, who, standing fifty yards off, held his watch\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"Precious long three and a half minutes,\" thought the lad.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant task standing within two yards of a\r\nhighly-charged explosive.  More than once he felt tempted to cut the\r\nrope and let the truck go.\r\n\r\n\"Time?\" he shouted huskily, for his heart seemed literally in his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet,\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nRealising the strain on the plucky youth, he began to walk slowly in\r\nthe direction of the truck.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back, sir!\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay stopped and slowly raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by!  Let go!\"\r\n\r\nOne swift sweep of the sharp blade and the cord was severed.  Slowly\r\nthe truck began to gather way, then moving with increased speed it\r\nplunged on its headlong course.\r\n\r\nTen seconds later--before the fuse had time to complete its work--the\r\ndescending truck crashed into the stationary ones.  There was a\r\ndeafening roar, a cloud of dust, in which was mingled a number of\r\nheavy, shapeless objects, and then an ominous silence, broken only by\r\nthe crash of some fragments of wood and metal hurled high in the air by\r\nthe explosive.\r\n\r\nRushing to the edge of the cliff the four defenders gazed upon the\r\nresult of their stratagem.\r\n\r\nWhere the trucks had stood gaped a pit six feet in depth, for one of\r\nthe peculiarities of dynamite is that it shows its power mainly where\r\nit meets resistance.  Of the storehouse scarce a vestige remained,\r\nwhile the double line of rails had been uprooted for a distance of\r\nnearly twenty yards.\r\n\r\nThe havoc wrought amongst the savages was appalling.  So many were\r\nkilled that had the white men so wished it they could have fallen upon\r\nthe survivors and exterminated them; but such was not their intention.\r\n\r\n\"We must act with prudence or we shall be left with fifty wounded\r\nsavages on our hands,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"Those who are unhurt will take\r\nto their canoes, and leave the others to their fate, and that won't do!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we stop them taking to their canoes?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"By taking advantage of their cowed condition and disarming them.\r\nCome, let's to work.\"\r\n\r\nFearlessly the four defenders descended the path to the lower terrace.\r\n\r\n\"We'll begin with those fellows first!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, pointing\r\nto a group of natives cowering, with their hands over their eyes,\r\nagainst a spur of the cliff.  \"Stand by with your revolvers in case\r\nthey resist.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no resistance.  Passively the savages allowed Mr. McKay to\r\nremove their weapons, which had fallen from their nerveless grasp.\r\n\r\nSeizing one man firmly but gently, Mr. McKay dragged him from his\r\ncompanions.  The native's face bore a strong resemblance to that of a\r\nsheep led to the slaughtering-block; no doubt he thought he was to be\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nEscorted by the three lads the prisoner was taken to the fringe of the\r\ncocoa-nut grove, where Mr. McKay presented him with a branch of a\r\npalm--the almost universal emblem of peace.\r\n\r\nAt this the native began to see a chance of having his life spared, and\r\nMr. McKay, pointing to the canoes and then to the wounded savages, made\r\nsigns to the man that they desired their crippled enemies to be placed\r\nin the native craft.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was tried upon some of the other unharmed savages, with\r\nequally good results, and quickly recovering their senses the natives\r\nset to work with a will.\r\n\r\nOne powerful-looking savage, however, refused to deliver up his club,\r\nbut instead made a sudden rush at Mr. McKay with the evident intention\r\nof knocking him over the head.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay had discarded his rifle, and his revolver was in the side\r\npocket of his pyjama coat.  Coolly his hand sought his pocket, and\r\nwithout attempting to withdraw the weapon he discharged it at his\r\nassailant, who was barely five yards off.\r\n\r\nThe heavy bullet, striking the man full in the chest, laid him dead on\r\nthe ground, while the other savages, awestruck at the sight of one of\r\ntheir number being killed by no visible agency, were again thrown into\r\na state of panic.\r\n\r\nAt length all the wounded were distributed between five of the canoes.\r\nThen Mr. McKay made signs for the rest of the natives to embark,\r\nkeeping the other five canoes on the beach, and within an hour of the\r\nexplosion the sorry remnant of the invaders was paddling back towards\r\nthe island of Ahii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER'S ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they will ever return?\" asked Terence.\r\n\r\n\"I think they have had enough,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"They've had a\r\nlesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have we,\" added Ellerton, dolefully regarding the fragments of\r\nthe storehouse and the shattered line of rails.\r\n\r\n\"And our boat; how shall we be able to leave the island now?\" asked\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the damage done to that is not so great as we imagine.  With\r\nthe help of these canoes we may be able to raise her.  But we'll go\r\ninto that question later.  At present I feel as if I could enjoy a good\r\nsquare meal.\"\r\n\r\nSo back to the dwelling-house they went, where Quexo, who had been\r\nquaking all the time, was reassured.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think we could rig up an electric alarm?\" said Terence\r\nduring the progress of the meal.  \"There's plenty of insulated copper\r\nwire in the small store.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be as well,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"We might have a return\r\nvisit; though, as I said before, I don't anticipate one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But some natives from another island might try and surprise us,\" said\r\nAndy.  \"News travels quickly, and perhaps we might again be favoured\r\nwith the unwelcome attentions of these savage gentry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I tell you what,\" continued Terence, waxing enthusiastic, for\r\nelectrical engineering was his strong point, \"we brought one of the\r\n_San Martin's_ searchlights ashore.  I'll try and fix it up and connect\r\nit with the dynamo.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see what's to be done.  But now, how about Blight?  It's time we\r\npaid him a visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess he's been wondering what the dust-up was about,\" remarked\r\nAndy, as he prepared the prisoner's daily ration.\r\n\r\nAndy and Terence were deputed to visit the prisoner, and, armed as\r\nusual and carrying a supply of food and water, they set off for the\r\nfenced-in dwelling.\r\n\r\nFrom the elevation of the upper terrace they could see the distant dark\r\nbrown sails of the canoes, for the wind was light and their progress\r\nhad been slow.\r\n\r\n\"They'll have a nice yarn to pitch into their friends when they\r\nreturn,\" observed Terence.\r\n\r\n\"They stood a good chance of pitching into us,\" replied Andy grimly.\r\n\"The rascals!\"\r\n\r\nFor his mind was still sore on the subject of the scuttled yawl.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the fence Andy put down his load, and producing a key\r\nunlocked the door.  The space without the cave was deserted.\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" muttered Andy.  \"Blight is generally anxious for his food.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully relocking the door, the lads made their way to the mouth of\r\nthe cave.  Here, too, silence reigned.\r\n\r\n\"Blight!  Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.  Andy repeated the call, but without result.\r\n\r\n\"Is he asleep, or is he dead?\" asked Terence, and gripping their\r\npistols the two lads entered the cave.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the brilliant sunshine without, the apartment seemed\r\nplunged into utter darkness, but by degrees the lads' eyes grew\r\naccustomed to the gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" whispered Andy.  \"Perhaps he's up to some of his tricks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You locked the door in the fence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us explore the cave thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\nThis they did, penetrating into the cavern and examining every recess\r\nas they advanced, till the daylight which filtered in was insufficient\r\nto allow them to continue their search.\r\n\r\n\"Where's his lamp?  I know the pater let him have one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it on a ledge close to the entrance.  Have you any matches?\"\r\n\r\nAndy had; matches were becoming scarce on McKay's Island, and whenever\r\npossible a burning glass was used for obtaining fire.  Being, in this\r\ncase, without his magnifying glass, Andy had to use one of the precious\r\nhoard of matches that he kept in a watertight gun-metal case, and\r\nlighting the lamp the two explorers resumed their search.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone right enough,\" exclaimed Terence, as they \"drew blank.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where?  And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness only knows.  Let's run back and tell the others.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay was greatly upset at the news, and seizing a light rifle he\r\nstrode off towards the prisoner's quarters, accompanied by the three\r\nlads.\r\n\r\n\"Did you leave the door open?\" he inquired, as they came in sight of\r\nthe fence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Andy.  \"I was in a hurry to tell you, and what does it\r\nmatter now that the man has escaped?\"\r\n\r\n\"For all we know he might have been lying concealed within the fence\r\nthe whole time you were looking for him, and finding the door unlocked\r\nafter you left he coolly walked out.  Andy, I'm surprised at such\r\ncarelessness.\"\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that Mr. McKay was annoyed with his son, but the apparent\r\nlaxity was enough to justify his displeasure.\r\n\r\nWith Blight roaming about the island, the existence of the others would\r\nbe a continual round of anxiety.  The man was no ordinary criminal.  He\r\nwas versed in all the wiles of the savage life, possessed of\r\nconsiderable strength, skill, and reliance, and was not above resorting\r\nto treachery and murder to gain his ends.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the outside of the fence revealed no signs of\r\na burrow under the iron sheeting, but close to the part of the wall\r\nthat touched the cliff there were unmistakable signs of a man's feet.\r\n\r\n\"There you are!  He did not escape by the door after all, Andy,\"\r\nremarked his father.  \"See, these two footprints close together show us\r\nthat he jumped, and, what is more, jumped skilfully, for there are no\r\ntraces of his heels.  We'll find out how he scaled the fence by\r\nexamining the other side.\"\r\n\r\nEntering the door, the gaolers found that Blight had cut a number of\r\nniches in the rock and had thus managed to climb to the top of the\r\nfence.  The cutting of these footholds must have taken a considerable\r\ntime, and in spite of the daily examination of the ground for any sign\r\nof a tunnel, the niches had escaped observation.\r\n\r\n\"You see how he hoodwinked us,\" said Mr. McKay, pointing to the little\r\nheap of dried grass and mud.  \"He dug out those footholds and filled\r\nthem up with grass and clay, so that they presented the same appearance\r\nas the rest of the cliff.  Now, lads, we must find him, and the sooner\r\nthe better.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they returned to the house, where Terence was told off to\r\nremain on guard with Quexo in the event of the escaped prisoner\r\nbreaking in and securing arms.  The mulatto, though far from having\r\nrecovered from his injuries, was strong enough to use a pistol, so the\r\ntwo could hold the dwelling-house against a surprise.\r\n\r\nHaving supplied themselves with enough provisions for the day, the two\r\nMcKays and Ellerton set out on the trail of the fugitive.  Mr. McKay\r\nand his son took rifles and revolvers and also an axe to \"blaze\" the\r\npalm-trees, while Ellerton, by reason of his damaged arm, carried a\r\nrevolver only in addition to his canvas knapsack containing his share\r\nof provisions.\r\n\r\nTracking was a new experience to the English lad, and he could not help\r\nwondering at the keenness displayed by father and son as they followed\r\nthe scantiest trail.\r\n\r\nAndy would walk with considerable speed for a hundred yards, his eyes\r\nfixed upon the ground; while Mr. McKay would follow at his heels, at\r\nthe same time keeping a sharp look-out on all sides in order to guard\r\nagainst a sudden attack.\r\n\r\nThen the order would be reversed, Mr. McKay following the trail, and\r\nhis son acting as a cover to his father.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a mile the track was fairly well-defined, though Ellerton\r\nhad to confess that he would have failed to notice it.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive had skirted the base of the cliff, then plunging into the\r\npalm grove, he had gone by a round-about way towards the left; and was\r\nevidently heading for the thickly-wooded belt of land surrounding the\r\nbase of the highest peak of the island.\r\n\r\nThen the pursuers met with an unexpected rebuff.  The trail led up to a\r\nbroad tract of barren country, the surface of the land consisting of\r\nrocky mounds covered with a deposit of lava--the result of volcanic\r\naction many years previously.\r\n\r\n\"This kind of stuff extends right up to the base of the peak,\" said\r\nAndy.  \"We had a rough scramble when Quexo and I climbed the mountain.\r\nI know what it's like.  There are hundreds of rifts where a man might\r\nhide himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's covered his tracks,\" announced Mr. McKay.  \"See, he's gone in\r\nthat direction, then back again and off in entirely the opposite way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the trail is getting very much fainter,\" added Andy.\r\n\r\n\"It's my belief that he's lying low within a few yards of us,\"\r\ncontinued his father.  \"It's an admirable hiding-place, but it's\r\ncertain that he must have food, so he's bound to make for the cocoanuts\r\nand bread-fruit trees sooner or later.  That's why he's doubled on his\r\ntracks.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must double on our tracks before long,\" replied Andy.  \"That is, if\r\nwe don't want to spend a night in this wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I intend to do,\" said his father in a low voice.  \"I want\r\nyou two to go back to the house.  Make plenty of noise, and grumble at\r\nhaving been unsuccessful.  I'm going to remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" queried Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!  Don't speak so loud.  Yes, alone.  You don't imagine I'm afraid\r\nto tackle an unarmed man, do you?  Now, listen to what I have to say.\r\nIt will be dark in an hour or so, but the moon will rise at nine\r\no'clock.  Make your way here at sunrise to-morrow, and I'll warrant\r\nyou'll find me safe enough--and not alone, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nAndy knew that it was no good arguing, and the two lads set off towards\r\ntheir home.  The blazed track was followed without difficulty, and just\r\nas the sun set they emerged from the forest and gained the terrace on\r\nwhich the house stood.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mr. McKay?\" asked Terence.\r\n\r\n\"Left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Left behind?  What for?  Has anything gone wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not.  He insisted, so there was no help for it.  We've to\r\nrejoin him at sunrise to-morrow,\" replied Andy.\r\n\r\nAll that night the lads did not attempt to sleep.  Filled with anxiety,\r\nthey listened intently for the sound of a rifle shot.  The air was\r\nperfectly still, and though the strained nerves of the watchers caused\r\nthem to hear a variety of imaginary sounds, no reassuring report of\r\nfirearms broke the echoes of the palm-groves.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" exclaimed Ellerton, after hours of weary vigil, \"the\r\nmoon's up quite enough to allow us to find our way; so let's make a\r\nstart.\"\r\n\r\nAndy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know the pater well enough by this time, Hoppy.  It's\r\nrotten hanging about here, I admit, but it's part of the game.  So\r\nlet's make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE ENEMY IS CORNERED\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, left to himself, prepared for his all-night watch.  His\r\nhiding-place consisted of a crevice which commanded a view of the route\r\nhis companions had taken.  Standing upright he could also see over the\r\nrock in which he was concealed, though prudence urged him not to show\r\nhis head above the gaunt stone walls of his lair.\r\n\r\nHe rested himself on a convenient ledge, and waited, with his rifle\r\nacross his knee.  Then, as the sun set and intense darkness brooded\r\nover the land, he braced himself for his task.  Instinct told him that\r\nthe fugitive would skulk in the rocks till the moon rose; then in all\r\nprobability he would prowl for food.\r\n\r\nMore than once Mr. McKay fancied he heard the crunching of a boot upon\r\nthe pumice stone.  Twice he grasped his rifle, as a dark shadow seemed\r\nto loom up against the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Imagination,\" he remarked to himself.  \"What is the matter with my\r\nnerves?\"  But a finger pressed upon his wrist showed him that his pulse\r\nwas beating regularly.\r\n\r\nThen came a sound that could not possibly be mistaken--a smothered\r\nsneeze.\r\n\r\nBlight was within a few yards of Mr. McKay, but in which direction the\r\nlatter was unable to decide.\r\n\r\nThen came the scuffling of feet.  The fugitive was scuffling blindly\r\nacross the rock.  At any instant he might pitch into the crevice right\r\ninto the arms of his pursuer.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer he came, cursing under his breath as his feet came in\r\ncontact with the ruts and sharp corners of the rocks.  Mr. McKay could\r\neven hear the laboured breathing of his quarry.\r\n\r\nRealising the danger of making his way over the pitfalls, Blight sat\r\ndown, muttering angrily at being baulked, at the same time abusing the\r\nmoon for its tardy appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay waited, rifle in hand, feeling almost pleased.  He pictured\r\nthe fugitive's consternation when the moonlight revealed his tracker\r\ncovering him at ten paces.  It was the old animal instinct, the joy of\r\nthe chase, whether hunter and hunted be human beings or mere beasts of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nAbove the tops of the distant palm-trees a pale yellow light dawned in\r\nthe eastern sky.  Stronger and stronger it grew, till the golden disc\r\nof the queen of night appeared, the brilliant light throwing the rocks\r\ninto strong relief.\r\n\r\nThe escaped prisoner, now that his path seemed clear, prepared to make\r\nhis journey towards the trees once more, and obviously fearing no\r\ndanger, he scrambled over a flat-topped boulder.  Barely had he stood\r\nerect when Mr. McKay, rifle to shoulder, shouted:\r\n\r\n\"The game's up once more.  Throw up your hands!\"\r\n\r\nSo great was Blight's surprise that he stood stock still, with mouth\r\nagape, staring at the silhouetted form of his enemy; then, recovering\r\nhimself, rushed wildly towards Mr. McKay, shrieking:\r\n\r\n\"You'll never take me alive, bad luck to you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the act of a madman.  Ere he could cover the intervening apace,\r\nMr. McKay could have shot him dead on the spot.  But the Australian was\r\nloath to be the rascal's executioner; the business seemed to him to be\r\nmere butchery.\r\n\r\nTurning down the muzzle of his rifle, the solitary tracker aimed the\r\nweapon at his enemy's feet.  This action had a most restraining effect\r\nupon the rogue.  He would welcome a swift and almost painless death,\r\nbut to be deliberately crippled, secured at leisure, and dragged back\r\nto his prison, did not appeal to him.  He turned swiftly and, dodging\r\nfrom side to side as he ran, he sped rapidly across the rocks.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay fired, but the shot went wide.  He could have perforated the\r\nman's body between the shoulders with the greatest ease, but a pot-shot\r\nin the moonlight at a pair of swiftly-moving legs afforded plenty of\r\nopportunities of missing.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive uttered a yell of defiance, and sped onwards.  Another\r\nfifty yards and he would be lost to sight in the midst of a labyrinth\r\nof fantastically-shaped rocks.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay did not attempt to fire a second shot.  The success of his\r\nlong vigil depended upon keeping the chase in view.  Laying his rifle\r\non the ground and making sure that the flap of his pistol-holster was\r\nloose, he vaulted upon the rock and set off in pursuit.\r\n\r\nAlthough \"hard as nails\" and sound of wind, Mr. McKay forgot for the\r\ntime being that the result of his accident on board the _San Martin_\r\nhad left him somewhat weak in his lower limbs.\r\n\r\nWith elbows pressed close to his sides he ran, but ere forty yards were\r\ncovered he found himself lurching dangerously.  Setting his jaw firmly,\r\nhe persevered, keeping his eyes fixed upon the form of the fugitive,\r\nyet he was forced to confess that he was losing ground.\r\n\r\nBlight was now within twenty yards of the sheltering rocks.  Dare the\r\npursuer use his revolver and stop this headlong flight?  The odds were\r\ntoo great, for with the exertion of running his aim would be erratic.\r\nNo, he must continue to run and trust to chance that his quarry might\r\nbe cornered somewhere.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Blight stumbled, kicking up a cloud of pumice dust that looked\r\nsilvery in the moonlight.  Two yards he traversed ere he fell headlong\r\nin the soft lava, and before he could stagger to his feet his pursuer\r\nwas almost within arm's length.\r\n\r\n\"Give in, you idiot,\" shouted Mr. McKay, drawing his revolver.\r\n\r\nFor answer Blight laughed, and, bending low as he ran, he doubled away\r\nto the right, where the ground sloped downwards towards a line of\r\nirregularly-shaped cliffs.  He was crippled.  He had twisted his ankle,\r\nand everything was in Mr. McKay's favour.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to close with the desperate fugitive, Mr. McKay prepared to\r\nmaim him with a bullet through his leg; but even as he levelled the\r\nweapon, Blight disappeared from sight with a shriek of terror.\r\n\r\nInstinctively Mr. McKay threw himself flat on his back, digging his\r\nheels into the soft yielding dust; but surely and gradually he found\r\nhimself slipping towards the mouth of a gaping abyss.  The very ground\r\non which he was sprawling was moving.  He could hear the rustle of the\r\nsand and small stones as they dropped over the ledge into the\r\napparently fathomless chasm.\r\n\r\nDesperately Mr. McKay plunged his arms into the sliding sand; but his\r\nefforts were unavailing.  He was being launched towards the yawning\r\ngulf, the horrors of which seemed worse in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nJust as he was on the point of slipping over the edge--his heels were\r\nalready over the abyss--his hand, buried arm's length in the pumice,\r\ncame in contact with a piece of hard rock.\r\n\r\nWould it hold? he wondered.\r\n\r\nSlowly his outstretched arm began to change from a vertical to an\r\nalmost horizontal position as his body still continued its downward\r\nmotion.  The rock afforded but a slender hold: either the fabric might\r\nbecome loosened, or his hand might be unable to keep up the strain, and\r\nthen----?\r\n\r\nMr. McKay ceased to struggle.  He could feel the sand slipping from\r\nunder him, streaming past like a solid cataract.  So long as he kept\r\nquiet he was comparatively safe, but directly he commenced to find a\r\nfoothold, his peril increased threefold.  Yet he knew that every moment\r\nhis grip upon the small pinnacle that stood between him and instant\r\ndeath was gradually becoming weaker.\r\n\r\nIn those awful moments of peril he could hear the laboured breathing of\r\nhis enemy, coming apparently from a great depth beneath his feet.\r\nBlight, then, was still alive, but his gasping breaths sounded ominous.\r\n\r\nAt length, regaining his self-possession, Mr. McKay put forth a final\r\neffort in an endeavour to draw his feet clear of the awful chasm.\r\n\r\nInch by inch he worked himself upwards, against the increasing torrent\r\nof sand, when suddenly the rocky ledge was wrenched from its base, and\r\nthe next instant he was swept into the gulf.\r\n\r\nAmidst a shower of dust and stones he felt himself hurtling through the\r\npitch dark air, then everything became a blank.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe first rays of the rising sun filtering through the narrow neck of\r\nthe inverted funnel-shaped chasm strove to disperse the darkness.\r\n\r\nStretched upon the thick carpet of powdered pumice were two motionless\r\nfigures, partially covered with the flow of dust that trickled from the\r\nopen air like the sand of a gigantic hour-glass.\r\n\r\nThe head and shoulders of one of the victims were pillowed upon the\r\nbody of the other, who lay, with arms outstretched, gazing upwards with\r\nsightless eyes at the narrow slit of sky that was visible between the\r\nlips of the abyss.\r\n\r\nBlight had gone to his last account.\r\n\r\nSlowly opening his eyes, Mr. McKay blinked stupidly at nothingness for\r\na few seconds, then stretched out his arms.  It was the action of a man\r\nawakening from slumber.  He felt no pain; he had no idea of where he\r\nwas, or of what had occurred.\r\n\r\nWith the intention of going to sleep again he turned his head on its\r\nghastly pillow, but on drawing up his arms to compose himself, his head\r\ncame in contact with the cold face of his companion in misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe touch acted like an electric shock.  In an instant the details of\r\nthe tragedy flashed across his mind.  He stumbled to his feet, but\r\novercome by weakness, he sank once more upon the dust-covered floor.\r\n\r\nHow long had he been in this hideous deathtrap? he wondered.  Was it a\r\nnight, or many days and nights?  Had his comrades searched in vain and\r\nhad they abandoned their quest and left him to his fate?\r\n\r\nFor quite half-an-hour Mr. McKay sat and thought, striving to collect\r\nhis mental and physical powers.  He went over the events leading up to\r\nthe final tragedy--the ambush, the pursuit, Blight's disappearance, and\r\nhis own terrible ordeal on the sliding sand.  Then he reflected that\r\nhis trail would be fairly well-defined, and that help must be\r\nforthcoming.  His watch was still going, so that he knew that it was\r\nonly the morning following his night's vigil.\r\n\r\nOverhead a dazzling ray of sunlight shone obliquely through the\r\nopening, illuminating the shaft-like sides of his prison, but so dead\r\nblack was the colour of the rock that hardly any light was reflected to\r\nthe bottom of the pit.  He could, in fact, just see his own hands and\r\nthe grey features of his ill-fated companion.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay groped about the floor.  At first his fingers encountered\r\nnothing but dust.  He plunged his arm up to the elbow in the soft\r\nyielding deposit; but nothing solid met his touch.\r\n\r\nFearing that he might be lying on a ledge overhanging a pit of\r\nfathomless depth, Mr. McKay extended his field of exploration, making\r\nwide sweeps with his arms.  Presently his fingers encountered a metal\r\nobject.  It was his revolver.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" he thought, \"I can signal for aid.\"\r\n\r\nBut on second thoughts he hesitated.  Then he remembered his box of\r\nmatches.  Fumbling in his pocket he found the little case, and eagerly,\r\nlike a miser counting his gold, he passed the little sticks one by one\r\nthrough his fingers.  Ten--ten priceless matches.\r\n\r\nHe struck one.  For the moment his eyes were dazzled by the yellow\r\nfire, but ere it burnt out he made sure of two things.  He was not\r\nlying on the edge of another precipice; that was reassuring.  His\r\nsecond discovery was disconcerting.  His trusty revolver was choked\r\nwith fine dust, and had he discharged it he would have assuredly been\r\ninjured by the bursting of the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe match flickered out, and to the imprisoned man the darkness seemed\r\ndenser than ever.  It pressed upon him like a real substance, till he\r\nfelt tempted to shout in his distress.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he grew calmer, and staggering to his feet he moved his\r\nlimbs with extreme caution.  To his satisfaction they were still sound,\r\nthough he was beginning to feel stiff and bruised from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe light of a second match showed that Blight was indeed beyond all\r\nhuman aid, so, placing his handkerchief over the face of the corpse,\r\nMr. McKay retired a few steps till a third match became necessary.\r\n\r\nHe found himself within a few feet of one of the walls of his prison.\r\nThe stone, divided by volcanic agency, was almost vertical at the\r\npoint, though at others it receded so that the base of the abyss was\r\nseveral yards beyond the perpendicular height of the shaft.  Close to\r\nhim was a deep crack in the wall, known by mountaineers as a \"chimney.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to scale the rock, he thought, but the knowledge\r\nthat the edge of the shaft was \"rotten\" compelled Mr. McKay to abandon\r\nthat attempt.  He must wait; yet, unwilling to remain idle, he resolved\r\nto sacrifice four more of his precious matches in exploring the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the chasm.\r\n\r\nKeeping close to the wall, Mr. McKay proceeded with the utmost caution,\r\ntill he reached a yawning cavern that descended abruptly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he hesitated, fearing the presence of carbonic acid gas,\r\nbut on holding the lighted match close to the ground the flame burnt\r\nclear and bright.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise Mr. McKay found his hand resting on the butt of a\r\nmusket.  The weapon was lying on the hard, rocky floor of the cave, for\r\nhere no dust had penetrated.  Another match revealed the fact that the\r\nfirearm was of an ancient pattern, the combined flint and matchlock\r\nbeing of not later date than the end of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\"By George!  This is a find!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nFor the time being he forgot his surroundings, interest being centred\r\nin this relic of bygone days.\r\n\r\nThen, unwilling to risk using his remaining stock of matches, yet\r\nmentally resolving to explore this part of the cavern at the earliest\r\nfavourable opportunity, he retraced his steps to that part of the chasm\r\nthat lay beneath the narrow shaft.  Here he sat down and waited, hoping\r\nfor the speedy arrival of Andy and Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE BUCCANEERS' CAVE\r\n\r\nIt could not have been more than a couple of hours after Mr. McKay\r\nreturned to consciousness that the two lads emerged from the forest and\r\ngazed wonderingly upon the rock-strewn plain.  Not knowing the course\r\nof events, they had left Terence and Quexo to guard the dwelling-house\r\nagainst a possible attack.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, Hoppy!\" cautioned Andy, as Ellerton was about to rush towards\r\nthe spot where they had left Mr. McKay on the previous evening.  \"I\r\ndon't like the look of things.  Suppose that rogue has got the upper\r\nhand?  You would be potted to a cert if you rushed into the open in\r\nthat reckless style.  You work round to the right and I'll go by the\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly the lads, taking advantage of every bit of cover, advanced\r\nwith the utmost caution towards the little rift in the dark rock where\r\nMr. McKay had made his ambush.\r\n\r\nThere was his rifle, lying on the ground, with no sign of an empty\r\ncartridge to show that the weapon had been discharged.  Andy removed\r\nthe magazine and found that the cartridges were still intact.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it,\" he exclaimed.  \"The pater was evidently in a\r\nhurry, for, you see, the rifle was not placed against a rock, but was\r\nthrown down on the ground.  He's too careful, in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, to do a thing like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, where is he?  If Blight had managed to get the better of him he\r\nwould have taken away the rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have chased him right across this island.  Come on, it's no use\r\nwasting time here; let's try and pick up the trail.\"\r\n\r\nAndy leapt upon the flat top of the rock and assisted his chum to\r\nfollow his example.  Both took it for granted that there was no further\r\nneed for concealment.\r\n\r\nFrom where they stood the ground had the appearance of a broad belt of\r\nflat rock, divided in all directions by narrow crevices, most of which\r\ncould be jumped across with the greatest ease, while ahead was the\r\nfirst of a series of cliffs, which incircled the base of the peak of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" exclaimed Ellerton, pointing to a little heap of brown canvas\r\nwhich was lying on the rock about thirty feet away.  \"There's your\r\nfather's haversack.\"\r\n\r\nThe lad was right, for Mr. McKay had discarded the article as he\r\ncommenced the pursuit of the fugitive.  From this spot the mingled\r\ntracks of the hunter and the hunted were easily traced, by reason of\r\nthe deposit of lava dust, which grew thicker as the lads advanced.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they came to an abrupt halt.  Almost at their feet began the\r\ntreacherous slope, ending in the horrible fissure which had been the\r\ncause of Blight's death and Mr. McKay's disaster.\r\n\r\nAlthough the still sliding dust and sand had almost hidden the traces\r\nof Mr. McKay's desperate struggle to save himself from the yawning pit,\r\nthere remained sufficient evidences of the disappearance of the\r\nfugitive and his pursuer.\r\n\r\nThe faces of both lads grew pale.  Andy was about to rush towards the\r\nbrink of the abyss when Ellerton's detaining hand was laid upon his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing more or less than a trap,\" said he.  \"You'll----\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence remained unfinished, for from the depths of the chasm a\r\nhollow voice that the lads hardly recognised as Mr. McKay's repeated\r\nthe warning:\r\n\r\n\"Stand back, lads!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, sir?\" shouted Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you cannot get to my aid without a rope.  Hurry back to the\r\nhouse, and bring all hands with you.  A lantern will also be useful.\r\nBe as quick as you can, for it's pretty doleful down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir, we'll make haste; but stand by!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as a parting gift Ellerton dexterously threw Mr. McKay's haversack,\r\nstill containing an ample supply of food, into the pit.\r\n\r\nAndy, however, hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you are all right, dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, my boy.  Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your voice sounds so strange.  I suppose it's the rocks that\r\naffect it.  How far did you fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know; about thirty feet, I expect; luckily the ground's soft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen anything of Blight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost despatch Ellerton and Andy returned to the house,\r\nwhere, having told the others all they knew about the accident, they\r\ncollected a couple of coils of rope, some lanterns, two strong\r\ncrowbars, a hammer, and, at Ellerton's suggestion, two six-inch pulleys.\r\n\r\nThe four lads--for even Quexo insisted on coming, though he was still\r\nin a weak state of health--set off for the scene of the disaster, Andy\r\nand Terence carrying the bulk of the appliances, while Ellerton and the\r\nmulatto took only what they could place in their belts.\r\n\r\nCheering up the prisoner with a lusty shout of encouragement, the\r\nrescuers proceeded to drive the crowbars into a convenient crevice in\r\nthe rocks, so that one was about ten feet nearer to the chasm than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the outside bar to the top of the inner one, Ellerton\r\nlashed a piece of rope, then making sure that the \"crows\" would bear\r\nany strain that was likely to be put upon them, he attached a pulley to\r\nthe base of the innermost.\r\n\r\nThrough the block was rove one of the coils of rope, one end of which\r\nhe tied round his waist.  Then, taking the lighted lantern in his hand,\r\nhe walked cautiously towards the brink of the pit, the others paying\r\nout the rope as he went.\r\n\r\nBefore he had gone a distance of five yards the pumice dust began to\r\nslide away from under his feet, causing him to sit down on the slope,\r\nwhile the avalanche nearly blinded Mr. McKay as he was looking upwards\r\nfor the expected relief.\r\n\r\n\"Come back, Hoppy!\" shouted Andy.  \"Remember your arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Ellerton with a laugh.  \"It's giving me good cause to\r\nremember it, but I mean to make the best of it.  You fellows can do\r\nmore good by hauling on that rope than I can, so slack away.\"\r\n\r\nTerence and Andy accordingly \"slacked away,\" and Ellerton slid another\r\nyard or so towards the brink.  He was then able to lower the lantern to\r\nMr. McKay, and at the same time he made the discovery that the shaft\r\nwas too rugged to allow a man to be hauled up by a rope without serious\r\ndanger of the rope being chafed through by the sharp projections.\r\n\r\nHe explained the situation to Mr. McKay, who fully realised the force\r\nof his remarks.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, we'll manage it right enough,\" concluded Ellerton\r\ncheerily, and giving the word he was hauled back to where his\r\ncompanions stood.\r\n\r\n\"We must have one of those trees down,\" he said, pointing to the\r\ndistant palms.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the lads set off for the forest, where without much\r\ndifficulty a stout trunk, thirty feet in length, was felled.  The work\r\nof transporting it to the brink of the pit was a more tedious business,\r\nand an hour elapsed ere they succeeded in slinging the timber across\r\nthe yawning gulf, where it rested with about ten feet imbedded in the\r\nsoft lava on either side of the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Now you can do this part of the work better than I,\" said Ellerton to\r\nAndy.  \"Lash this block to the centre of the trunk, and reeve a rope\r\nthrough it.\"\r\n\r\nThis Andy managed to do.  He also lashed a smaller piece of timber at a\r\ndistance of about four feet below the tree-trunk, so as to form a\r\nplatform to enable Mr. McKay to obtain a clear spring when hauled up as\r\nfar as the pulley would permit.\r\n\r\n\"All ready, pater?\" asked the son.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, Andy.  Could you manage to come down here, do you\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try.  I say, you fellows, I'm going down, so pay out the rope.\"\r\n\r\nAndy swung himself from the main beam upon the lower piece of timber,\r\nand, summoning up his courage, launched himself off from the swaying\r\nperch.\r\n\r\nSlowly he descended, spinning round on the straining rope like a joint\r\non a meat-jack, while at almost every second his shoulders or hips came\r\ninto contact with the jagged walls of the shaft.  To avoid the dust he\r\nkept his head bent downwards, and as he did so he saw the glimmer of\r\nthe lantern from beneath.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty feet, do you call it?\" he asked, as his feet touched the floor\r\nof the pit, and his father grasped his hand.  \"It's sixty at the very\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" was the reply.  \"You see, looking down from a\r\nheight the distance always appears greater.  Had the floor been hard\r\nrock, I should have been killed or at least seriously injured.  But to\r\nchange the subject, look here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay had, during the long interval of waiting since Ellerton had\r\nlowered the lantern, made another tour of exploration, and now he led\r\nthe way towards the tunnel where he had found an old musket.\r\n\r\nHe had made a strange discovery.  At no very distant date a long cavern\r\nof varying height and breadth existed here.  Where its entrance was Mr.\r\nMcKay had not found out; but a volcanic disturbance had caused a mighty\r\nfissure to divide the original cave in two, as an examination of the\r\nstrata proved conclusively.\r\n\r\nCasting off the rope from around his waist, Andy followed his father\r\ninto the tunnel-like cavern, stooping as he did so, for its mouth was\r\nbarely five feet in height.\r\n\r\nAt ten paces from its mouth the passage turned almost at right angles\r\nto its former direction, and expanded into a broad and lofty chamber.\r\nAlmost covering the width of the four sides was a range of arm-racks\r\nfilled with old-time weapons.  The candle-light flashed upon the bright\r\nbarrels of musket and pistol, and glittered on the steel of bayonet,\r\ncutlass, sword, and pike, for so dry was the atmosphere that a couple\r\nof centuries had not left any appreciable trace on the metal.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!  How did these get here?\" asked Andy, after he had\r\nrecovered from his astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"It's the armoury of some long-forgotten buccaneer,\" replied his\r\nfather.  \"I've had plenty of time to look round since you first sent me\r\nthe lantern, and none of these weapons are later than the earlier part\r\nof the eighteenth century, or the last part of the seventeenth.  See,\r\nthese muskets have Vauban locks, a combination of flint and matchlock.\r\nThese kinds of muskets were used at the battles of Steenkirke and\r\nLanden.  You can also see that all these bayonets are the plug variety,\r\nthat is to say they were plugged into the barrel of the musket, thus\r\ntemporarily converting it from a firearm to a pike.  These are\r\nevidently the original bayonets used in the reign of James II., so that\r\nwe can fix the period at which they were stored here to within a few\r\nyears, since the socket type were introduced early in the reign of\r\nWilliam III.\"\r\n\r\nIn this strain Mr. McKay continued, forgetful of time and place, till\r\nEllerton's voice was heard shouting to know of anything was amiss.\r\n\r\n\"We had better retrace our footsteps,\" observed Mr. McKay, \"or the\r\nothers will be getting alarmed.  When we've found an easier way of\r\ndescending into this pit--for I do not want another fall like that, I\r\ncan assure you--we'll make a thorough exploration of the place.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly father and son made their way back towards the shaft, but\r\nas they turned the bend of the passage they found themselves confronted\r\nby Terence and Ellerton, each of whom carried a lantern.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!  How did you descend?\" asked Andy, who was very astonished at\r\nseeing his friends down there.\r\n\r\n\"I lowered Terence, and then let myself down,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Then, how in the name of goodness, do you expect to get back?\"\r\ndemanded Andy.  \"Quexo cannot haul us up.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the same means as I came down,\" replied the young sailor calmly.\r\n\"It's easy enough with a bos'un's chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all I can say is that I hope you lashed the pulley on securely,\"\r\nrejoined Andy with evident concern.  \"If that goes wrong, we're\r\ntrapped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" replied Ellerton, somewhat ruffled at the slur cast upon\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" observed Mr. McKay good-humouredly.  \"Don't quarrel.  Now\r\nwe are here we might as well continue our exploration.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the armoury was inspected, the lads showing the greatest\r\ninterest in the weapons, snapping the flints in order to see the sparks\r\nfly from the steel.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, some of these muskets may be loaded,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.\r\n\"Always make it a practice to point a weapon away from anybody when\r\nfooling about like that.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he spoken, when a tremendous explosion shook the cave, the\r\nnoise being intensified by the confined space, and Terence sat on the\r\nfloor rubbing his shoulder, while a smoking musket lay by his side.\r\n\r\n\"You're a young ass,\" observed Andy.  \"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't know it was loaded,\" replied the youth, still clapping his hand\r\nto his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"That's what they all say after an accident has occurred,\" said Mr.\r\nMcKay.  \"By some means or the other the musket was stored without the\r\ncharge being drawn.  However, thank goodness it's no worse, though the\r\nconcussion might have brought the roof down on our heads.\"\r\n\r\nPresently Ellerton, who had wandered behind one of the arms-racks that\r\nstood about three feet from the wall, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Here's another passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, then,\" cautioned Mr. McKay.  \"Wait till I come.  There might\r\nbe a pitfall.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully examining the floor of the tunnel, the explorers advanced\r\nabout ten yards, when further progress was prevented by a door covered\r\nwith flat iron bars.\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" ejaculated Mr. McKay.  \"What have we here?\"\r\n\r\nTerence was dispatched to bring a dagger and a pike from the armoury,\r\nbut on further thoughts Mr. McKay forbade the lads to tamper with the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Then we are done for the time being,\" remarked Andy.  \"Shall we go\r\nback for our axes?\"\r\n\r\n\"A crowbar would be the thing,\" replied Ellerton.  \"But we want the two\r\nwe brought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably it's as well we haven't got them,\" added Mr. McKay.  \"To tell\r\nthe truth, I have my suspicions of that door, so we'll defer the\r\nopening of it till a more convenient time.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly the lads retraced their steps to the open chasm, where\r\nBlight's body lay.\r\n\r\n\"We must bury him as soon as possible,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"There's no\r\nplace here, so we must haul the body to the surface, and dig a grave in\r\nthe soft earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no soil nearer than the edge of the palm-forest,\" observed\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\n\"I know, but it cannot be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there a rift or a hole in the floor where we could bury him?\"\r\nasked Ellerton.  \"After all, where does it matter, so long as he\r\nreceives Christian burial?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may as well look,\" assented Mr. McKay, and taking one of the\r\nlanterns he commenced to explore that side of the chasm which lay\r\nopposite to the tunnel leading to the buccaneers' armoury.\r\n\r\nThe first ten or twelve paces were knee deep in the pumice dust, but on\r\napproaching the wall of the abyss the floor was fairly hard, being\r\nprotected from falling dirt and sand by the overhang of the shaft.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the stone face of the rift the explorers followed its\r\ngeneral direction without discovering any crack or crevice likely to\r\nsuit their purpose, till they stumbled upon another tunnel-like shaft,\r\nsimilar and almost opposite to the one they had already traversed.\r\n\r\nThis tunnel was about six feet in height and four in width, and ran in\r\na slightly upward direction.  Evidently it was at one time a\r\ncontinuation of the other passage.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see where this leads to,\" exclaimed Ellerton, full of curiosity\r\nand enthusiasm.  \"I believe it leads to the open air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Mr. McKay, pointing to the smooth, even steps in\r\nthe floor of the tunnel.  \"See, the floor is as dry as a bone, and\r\ncovered with a thick deposit of dust.  If this tunnel is open, the\r\ntropical rains would have washed the dust away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then where does it lead to?\" continued Ellerton.  \"Those arms must\r\nhave been brought in by some means.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll carry on and see who's right.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a long walk.  Up and up ran the tunnel, turning slightly to the\r\nright, yet maintaining a uniform height and breadth throughout its\r\nentire length.\r\n\r\n\"This passage has been hewn out,\" announced Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't the other?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Only in parts.  The armoury is a natural cave.  Perhaps there was a\r\nsmaller tunnel here before, and the people who discovered it enlarged\r\nit.  It's about time we came to the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now who's right, sir?\" exclaimed Ellerton triumphantly, as the pale\r\ngleam of daylight was visible from a curve of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"Not this child,\" replied Mr. McKay, without the faintest trace of\r\nchagrin.  In fact, he was glad to know he was in the wrong, for he did\r\nnot relish the task of tackling the shaft and the treacherous,\r\ndust-covered slope at its edge.\r\n\r\nA few sparse bushes masked the mouth of the tunnel, and upon these\r\nbeing thrust aside, the adventurers found themselves at the foot of the\r\nlowermost range of cliffs and within a hundred yards of the abyss which\r\nhad been the cause of their presence in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nStanding close to where the crowbars were driven into the rock was\r\nQuexo, looking the picture of misery, for he was perfectly convinced in\r\nhis own mind that all his companions had met with disaster.\r\n\r\n\"Quexo!\" shouted Andy.  \"Quexo!  Here we are!\"\r\n\r\nThe mulatto's joy was curious to behold.  He danced, swung his sound\r\narm over his head, and cut fantastic capers, the tears running down his\r\ncheeks the while as he blurted out unintelligible sentences in mingled\r\nEnglish and Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're safe once more, thanks to Providence,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nAll the explorers looked rather disreputable, but Mr. McKay in\r\nparticular was little better than a walking scarecrow.  His clothes\r\nwere in rags, his face clotted with dried blood and dust, while, now\r\nthe excitement was over, he once more began to feel stiff and bruised\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, we've forgotten what we went to look for!\" exclaimed Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"We must bring the poor fellow's body up\r\nafter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the tunnel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by the shaft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then here goes,\" said Ellerton quietly, and drawing up one of the\r\nropes he fastened it round his waist.  Lantern in hand he slid down the\r\nsand, and getting astride the tree-trunk, edged his way along till he\r\nreached the swaying piece of timber.  The next minute he was lowering\r\nhimself into the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"He's a plucky chap,\" commented Mr. McKay as they awaited Ellerton's\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\n\"And with an arm like that,\" added Terence admiringly.  \"He really\r\nseems to make light of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe watchers had not long to wait.\r\n\r\n\"Haul away!\" shouted Ellerton, and heaving slowly on the rope they\r\nbrought the body of the unfortunate Blight to the surface, where the\r\nyoung seaman soon rejoined the others.\r\n\r\nBetween them they bore the corpse across the rocky plain to the edge of\r\nthe palm-forest, where they dug a shallow grave with their axes.\r\n\r\nHere the body of the ex-pearler was laid to rest, Mr. McKay recited a\r\nfew prayers, and the earth was heaped over the corpse, a pile of heavy\r\nstones being placed over the grave to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nThis depressing task completed, they hastened homewards to enjoy a\r\nwelcome meal and a still more desired rest.\r\n\r\nFor the next two or three weeks all hands were too busy to think of\r\nmaking a further exploration of the buccaneers' cave.\r\n\r\nThe damage wrought by the savages required a considerable amount of\r\npatience and hard work to set to rights.  A new storehouse had to be\r\nconstructed, and the various stores that had not been totally destroyed\r\nwere collected and placed once more under cover.\r\n\r\nTerence had, with considerable ingenuity, contrived to erect an\r\nelectric alarm, so that the moment a foot was placed upon the lowermost\r\npath leading up to the house, a bell would ring in the sleeping\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nHe also succeeded in rigging up the searchlight salved from the wreck,\r\nand after many failures the apparatus worked to perfection.\r\n\r\nThereafter every night its great beam was directed skywards, the\r\nInternational Signal, \"N.G.\" (want immediate assistance), being flashed\r\nin the hope of attracting the attention of any vessel within seventy\r\nmiles of the island.\r\n\r\nThe little party was now completely isolated from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nBefore the destruction of the yawl they had the means of making even a\r\nfairly long passage, but now this was denied them, for it would be\r\nutter madness to attempt to go to sea in one of the captured canoes.\r\n\r\nSo, realising that the sooner they were in possession of a seaworthy\r\ncraft the better it would be for them, the inhabitants of McKay's\r\nIsland debated whether it would be advisable to construct a new decked\r\ncraft, convert one of the canoes into a cabin boat, or to salvage the\r\nwreck of the yawl and patch her up sufficiently to enable them to reach\r\nTahiti.\r\n\r\nEven with the appliances at their command, Mr. McKay reckoned that it\r\nwould take a twelvemonth to make a boat large enough for their\r\nrequirements.  As regards reconstructing one of the canoes, he came to\r\nthe conclusion that the work might be done, but the canoe being without\r\na keel would be a bad craft in a sea-way; while her light construction\r\nwould not allow a keel to be fixed without a grave risk of straining\r\nthe vessel in the first breeze she encountered.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was decided that the captured canoes should be utilised to\r\nattempt the salvage of the yawl, and on the first fine day the actual\r\nwork was put in hand.\r\n\r\nBy means of rollers and a powerful jack, three of the canoes were\r\nlaunched and taken to the scene of the savages' wanton act.\r\n\r\nThe wrecked boat could be clearly discerned lying on the sandy bed of\r\nthe lagoon in six fathoms of water, with a slight list to starboard.\r\n\r\nAnchoring two of the native craft close to the sunken yawl, Ellerton\r\nand Andy contrived to pass the bight of a chain under her bows, the\r\nends of the chain being made fast to two stout cables.  A similar\r\ndevice was employed to engage the stern of the wreck, although the fact\r\nthat her keel was imbedded in the sand added to the difficulty of the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nTwo massive trunks of palm-trees were then placed across the gunwales\r\nof both canoes, converting them into a kind of pontoon.\r\n\r\nThese preparations being completed, all that was at present necessary\r\nwas to wait till dead low water.\r\n\r\nAll hands knew that it would be a tedious job, for the rise of the tide\r\nwas but five feet at springs and only two feet at neaps, so what work\r\nhad to be done must be performed during the spring tides.\r\n\r\nAt dead low water all the slack of the four hawsers was taken in, and\r\nonce more came a tedious wait for the rising tide.\r\n\r\nGradually the strain on the ropes increased, till the timbers groaned\r\nunder the weight of the sunken boat and the canoes sank lower in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!  She's lifting!\" shouted Ellerton, and allowing sufficient\r\ntime for the yawl to be lifted clear of the bottom, Mr. McKay and his\r\nassistants began to haul on an anchor cable which had been previously\r\nlaid towards the shore.\r\n\r\nSlowly the ungainly pontoon with its heavy burden began to move\r\nshorewards, when suddenly the bows of the canoes rose high in the air,\r\nthrowing their occupants on their backs.  One of the hawsers had\r\nslipped, and the work of six long hours was wasted.\r\n\r\n\"Hard lines!\" exclaimed Terence dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"It is, I admit,\" replied Ellerton cheerfully.  \"Still, we must not\r\nexpect to have everything our own way.  Try, try, try again, as the old\r\nsaw says.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do no more to-day,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"We'll leave the canoes\r\nmoored to the yawl, however.  That will save time to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, if you don't mind, sir, we'll try and slip the sling under\r\nher again,\" said Ellerton.  \"You see, if we do that there won't be so\r\nmuch chance of the canoes drifting and consequently slipping the other\r\nsling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"It may save us some hours of hard\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nSo directly the water cleared, for the settling of the wrecked boat had\r\nchurned up the sand till she was practically invisible, the chain sling\r\nwas again placed in position.\r\n\r\nThis time this part of the business was done more satisfactorily, as\r\nthe yawl was resting on a hummock of shell and sand amidships, so that\r\nabove five feet of the after part of her keel was clear of the bed of\r\nthe lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"I hope it doesn't come on to blow to-night,\" remarked Ellerton, as the\r\nparty rowed ashore.  \"If it does, then good-bye to the yawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"The glass is steady,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"If it should pipe up, we\r\nmust slip the slings and let the canoes take their chance.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Ellerton and Andy were busy preparing additional slings,\r\nfor the former was resolved not to have a repetition of the morning's\r\nfailure if it could be avoided.\r\n\r\nJust before low water on the following morning, the salvage party set\r\nout for the wreck.  As Mr. McKay had predicted, the weather was fine,\r\nthere being no swell to speak of within the lagoon, though as usual the\r\nbreakers were lashing themselves into milk-white foam upon the outer\r\nfringe of the reef.\r\n\r\nOnce more the slings were hove tight, and as the tide rose, the wrecked\r\ncraft was again lifted from her ocean bed.  Directly the yawl was\r\n\"lively,\" as Ellerton expressed it, two more slings were passed\r\nunderneath her keel so as to make doubly sure of her being swung\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURE CHAMBER\r\n\r\nAt high water the wrecked craft was moved for a distance of nearly a\r\nhundred yards towards the shore ere she grounded.  This completed the\r\nday's work, and on the following morning at low tide the \"slack\" was\r\nagain taken in so as to enable the rising tide again to lift the yawl\r\nclear of the bottom.\r\n\r\nThis time, owing to the bed of the lagoon shoaling more rapidly, only\r\ntwenty yards were gained.\r\n\r\n\"It will be a tiring and tedious job, I can see,\" said Terence.  \"How\r\nare we to manage when the hull is brought close in shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to be content to move her a few feet at a time,\" replied\r\nEllerton.  \"It's slow work, I admit, but we are making very\r\nsatisfactory progress.\"\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the neap tides, the work came to a standstill, the\r\nrise of water being insufficient to justify the time and labour spent\r\non it; so the slings were cast off and buoyed, and the canoes brought\r\ninto the little natural harbour, where they would be safe from all but\r\nan exceptional on-shore gale.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval, the lads utilised several spare lengths of rails,\r\nand spiking them into rough sleepers, formed a temporary hauling-up\r\nslip.\r\n\r\nTwo of the wagons were dismantled, and the axles and wheels attached to\r\na cradle, while a winch was firmly bolted to a secure foundation on the\r\nshore at twenty yards above high-water mark.\r\n\r\nThe rails were to be laid down at low water as far seaward as possible,\r\nand the sleepers sunk by means of heavy stones.  Andy hoped to avail\r\nhimself of a high spring tide to float the yawl right over the cradle,\r\nthen, casting off the lashings that supported her, they could haul the\r\nwreck up by means of the winch and effect the repairs at their leisure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with the return of the spring tides a strong on-shore\r\nbreeze sprang up and continued with unremitting freshness for over a\r\nweek, so that the members of the salvage party were compelled\r\ntemporarily to abandon their enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Never say die,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay encouragingly.  \"Another fortnight\r\nand I hope we shall be able to resume the work.  In the meantime, lads,\r\nwhat do you say to a kind of picnic?\"\r\n\r\n\"A picnic?\" asked Ellerton.  \"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of paying another visit to the buccaneers' cave.  I'm\r\nvery curious to know what is on the other side of that iron-bound door,\r\nand I've no doubt you are equally so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the lads in chorus.  \"When shall we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an hour,\" replied Mr. McKay promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Bursting open the door will be a tough job,\" remarked Andy.  \"How do\r\nyou propose to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to manage it by means of an explosive,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\n\"Dynamite?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there's too much risk in carting a few sticks of that stuff\r\nthrough a tunnel a hundred yards in length or more.  One slip and it\r\nwould mean sudden death to the lot of us.  I want a couple of fuses,\r\nhowever, so while we are getting ready you can run up to the magazine\r\nand obtain them.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Andy was away on his errand, Mr. McKay opened a few cartridges\r\nand extracted the cordite.\r\n\r\n\"This stuff is safe enough with reasonable precautions,\" he remarked to\r\nEllerton, who was watching Mr. McKay with no little fear.  \"So long as\r\nit is not under compression cordite can be lit without the faintest\r\ndanger.  In the open air it merely fizzles like a damp squib.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we smash the door with an axe?\" asked Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"We could, but I prefer not to.  In the first place there's not much\r\nroom to wield an axe; in the second, as I mentioned before, I have my\r\nsuspicions regarding that door.\"\r\n\r\n\"What suspicions, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait and see!\" replied Mr. McKay with a laugh.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Andy with the fuses, the little party set out for the\r\ncave, each member carrying part of the equipment.  On gaining the\r\nsummit of the hill overlooking the house, Mr. McKay scanned the horizon\r\nwith his glasses to satisfy himself that no canoes were approaching the\r\nisland, then, having reassured himself on that point, he gave the word\r\nto step out briskly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to spend a night away from the house in case anything\r\nhappens,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"But do you expect another crowd of savages?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect the last lot,\" he replied grimly, \"but they came all\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey through the forest and across the rock-strewn plain was\r\nperformed without incident, and within a couple of hours after leaving\r\nthe house the party drew up at the mouth of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nHere each member lit a lantern, and in a comparatively bright light the\r\npassage of the tunnel commenced.  Quexo, however, remained in the open\r\nair.  Nothing could prevail upon him to descend into the bowels of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice someone stumbled, Terence falling heavily and barking his\r\nshins, while Mr. McKay's head came in contact with the roof much too\r\noften for his liking; but in high spirits the explorers crossed the\r\nfloor of the abyss, traversed the second tunnel, and gained the\r\narmoury.  Here they rested ere commencing the final stage of their\r\njourney underground.\r\n\r\nAt length the explorers came face to face with the mysterious\r\niron-bound door.  In spite of themselves they felt a strange sensation\r\nas they gazed upon the relic of bygone days.  What lay behind it?  What\r\nsecret did it guard so well?\r\n\r\n\"Stand back a bit, lads, and hand me another lantern,\" said Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nDropping on his knees, he carefully examined the floor and the\r\niron-shod threshold of the door, probing the narrow slit with his\r\nknife.  This done, he turned his attention to the walk and the crown of\r\nthe arch next to the woodwork, tapping the stone with the blade of his\r\nknife with the greatest caution.\r\n\r\nThe others looked on with interest not unmingled with curiosity and\r\nawe.  At length, apparently satisfied with the examination, Mr. McKay\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to bore a hole here,\" said he to Andy, pointing out a place\r\nin the door barely two inches from the floor.\r\n\r\nAndy, armed with a ratchet-brace, began his task, and the subdued\r\nsilence of the underground passage was broken only by the rattle of the\r\npawl and the sharp burr of the bit as it wormed its way steadily\r\nthrough the stout oaken plank.\r\n\r\n\"It's hot work,\" exclaimed Andy, who in order to use the brace in that\r\nmost inconvenient place was obliged to lie full length on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I know, but keep it up,\" replied Mr. McKay, who, grasping a crowbar,\r\nwas standing astride his son's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Stand a bit farther back,\" he continued, addressing Ellerton and\r\nTerence.\r\n\r\nThe two lads instantly obeyed, though they wondered at Mr. McKay's\r\nalert and expectant attitude.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, like the tongue of an enormous serpent, a double-pronged barb\r\nof steel flashed dully in the candle-light, passing completely across\r\nthe passage and about three feet above and over Andy's prostrate body.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Mr. McKay's powerful arm brought the crowbar upward in a\r\nresistless sweep, and with one blow severed the dreadful device of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe lads, pale with the excitement and horror of the incident, could\r\nonly utter an exclamation of astonishment while Andy hurriedly backed\r\naway from the well-guarded door.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant, isn't it?\" remarked Mr. McKay in a cool matter-of-fact tone,\r\nas if such incidents were of an everyday occurrence.  \"I had my\r\nsuspicions, as I said more than once before.  That device was cunningly\r\ncontrived to salute marauders in a very forcible manner.  Had either of\r\nus been standing in front of the door we should have been transfixed in\r\na jiffy.  Now, carry on, Andy.  I don't think there's anything more to\r\nbe feared on this side of the door, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nBut Andy was not equal to the task.  The risky experience had, to use\r\nhis own words, completely knocked the stuffing out of him.\r\n\r\n\"Let's quit; the game's not worth the candle,\" said Terence.\r\n\r\n\"Rather not!\" replied Mr. McKay, resolutely.  \"There's something worth\r\nsecuring behind that door, or the former owners would not have taken\r\nsuch elaborate and crafty steps to guard it.  Here, Ellerton, stand by\r\nwith the crowbar in case of accidents, and I'll finish boring the hole.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mr. McKay took up a position similar to that formerly\r\noccupied by his son and plied the brace vigorously.\r\n\r\nEre the bit had sunk another quarter of an inch there came a dull\r\nmetallic sound from the remote side of the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" gasped Andy breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Another surprise for trespassers,\" replied his father without ceasing\r\nin his work.  \"I've released another secret spring, I suppose.\r\nHowever, we are on the right side of the door this time.\"\r\n\r\nHaving bored the hole sufficiently deep for his purpose Mr. McKay\r\nproceeded to insert the cordite, ramming it tightly home with the end\r\nof the crowbar.  The rest of the explosive he laid close to the base of\r\nthe door, covering it with stones and pieces of rock brought from the\r\nfloor of the chasm.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's go back to the other tunnel,\" he continued, after the\r\ndetonator and the fuse had been inserted and the latter fired.\r\n\"There's no hurry; the explosion will not take place for five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAs the moments sped, the lads awaited in breathless silence the sound\r\nof the detonation.\r\n\r\nPresently a dull rumble echoed through the rocky passage, followed by a\r\nblast of air mingled with the acrid fumes of the cordite.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast!  Not so fast!\" cautioned Mr. McKay, as the lads began to\r\nrun towards the hitherto baffling barrier.  \"Some of the rock may be\r\ndislodged.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was, they were obliged to wait some considerable time, as the\r\natmosphere in the tunnel was so vile that it was impossible to breathe\r\nwith comfort.  Then as the mist gradually cleared, the dull yellow\r\nglare of the lanterns revealed a mass of shattered woodwork where the\r\ndoor had stood; while a foot beyond was a barrier of steel rods, which,\r\nserving the purpose of a portcullis, had fallen from above.\r\n\r\n\"That's what we heard fall,\" observed Mr. McKay.  \"The idea was, I\r\nsuppose, that any unauthorised person who escaped the lance-thrust on\r\nthis side of the door would, on opening it, be impaled by the weapons\r\nconcealed in the roof.  Now to settle with this obstruction.\"\r\n\r\nA few powerful strokes with an axe shattered enough bars to enable Mr.\r\nMcKay to squeeze through, and, followed by his eager companions, he\r\nentered the mysterious cavern.\r\n\r\nAt first there was little to attract the attention of the explorers.\r\nThe cave was of irregular form, being about fifty feet in length,\r\nthirty in breadth, and varying in height from twenty-five to six feet.\r\n\r\nOn the floor were six wooden chests, ordinary in appearance and\r\napparently of simple construction; they would have easily been mistaken\r\nfor seamen's chests placed in a lumber-room.\r\n\r\nStriding up to the nearest one, Mr. McKay raised the lid.  There was no\r\ncreaking of rusty hinges, no glitter of gold and jewels to dazzle the\r\neyes.  The chest was empty!\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is a sorry trick to have played on one another after so\r\nmuch trouble,\" commented he with a forced laugh.  He was visibly\r\ndisappointed, and his discouragement was shared by his companions.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt this has been the hiding-place of some great hoard,\" he\r\ncontinued.  \"But the buccaneering rascals have evidently removed their\r\nbooty.  I've drawn a blank, so you, Ellerton, try your hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe second chest was opened with equal ease, but to the unbounded\r\ndelight of the whole party the coffer was two-thirds filled with yellow\r\nmetal ingots, which flashed dully in the light of the lanterns.\r\n\r\n\"Gold!\" was the chorus of exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Gold it is,\" added Mr. McKay.  \"But a deal of good it will do us in\r\nour present state!  However, let's continue the examination.\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining four coffers gave more trouble, the lids being secured by\r\nstout iron screws.  Two were filled with gold and silver ornaments,\r\ncups, vases, and plates--the plunder, doubtless, of many a rich city of\r\nSpain's colonies on the shores of the Pacific.  The remaining two were\r\nladen with virgin gold.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lads,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, when the last coffer had been forced\r\nto disclose its contents, \"once we get this stuff safely to a civilised\r\ncountry we shall be rich beyond our wildest imagination.  We'll share\r\nand share alike, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the value of the treasure?\" asked Ellerton in an awestruck\r\nvoice, for the sudden avalanche of untold wealth had wellnigh upset him.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness only knows!  There's enough to enable you to go through life\r\nwithout doing another stroke of work.  That is, of course, when you are\r\nhome in England once more.  But, my lad, don't look upon it in that\r\nlight.  Take my word for it that idleness is a curse, and the wealth,\r\nif used solely to promote idleness, would serve a better purpose if it\r\nlay a thousand fathoms deep on the bed of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever I take my share back to my home, I trust I'll use it to a good\r\npurpose,\" said Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"I trust so, too,\" added Mr. McKay.  \"Now, let us see if there's\r\nanything else of interest here.  I am anxious to examine these\r\nmurderous devices.  Ah!\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKay pointed in the direction of the shattered door.  On either\r\nside, but separated from the entrance tunnel by a massive wall composed\r\nof the solid rock, was a narrow and lofty passage, both running\r\nparallel with the tunnel.\r\n\r\nLantern in hand, Mr. McKay stooped down and entered the right-hand\r\nrecess, and to his surprise he found no fewer than six steel lances,\r\neach accompanied by a tightly coiled spring, while a seventh had\r\nuncoiled itself, the spiral spring stretching from wall to wall.\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed with thankfulness.  \"We've had a\r\nfortunate escape.  Each of these fiendish contrivances is set to launch\r\nitself into the tunnel on the outside of the door.  The one we released\r\nis the nearest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must have passed them?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and by the intervention of Providence they failed to act.  Watch!\"\r\n\r\nAnd touching a slender steel rod that passed from the front of one of\r\nthe springs to the floor, Mr. McKay gave it a sharp upward jerk.\r\n\r\nInstantly the hidden coil released itself, and the dread weapon\r\ndisappeared through the rock which separated the cave-like recess from\r\nthe tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"The whole contrivance, though deadly, is comparatively simple,\"\r\nexplained Mr. McKay.  \"Underneath the floors of both chambers are a\r\nnumber of levers.  The weight of a person treading in the tunnel would\r\ncause the lever to move a rod, which in turn releases a finely set\r\ntrigger which controls the springs.  Owing to years of idleness the\r\nlevers failed to act, and only Andy's continuous exertions as he lay on\r\nthe ground in front of the door caused one of the springs to be\r\nreleased.  I bargained for one, but not a dozen or more, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\n\"A dozen?\" echoed Terence.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, a dozen at least.  We'll find six or seven more on the other side\r\nof the tunnel.\"\r\n\r\nOne by one the remaining springs were released, and on entering the\r\nleft-hand cavity a similar state of things was revealed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we need fear these any longer,\" continued Mr. McKay, as\r\nthe sound of the releasing of the last spring vibrated in the confined\r\nspace.  \"Now the question is, what is to be done with the stuff?\" and\r\nhe indicated the coffers with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it here,\" suggested Andy.\r\n\r\n\"I would but for one reason.  If we are taken off the island by a\r\npassing ship, the captain would not feel inclined to waste time while\r\nwe were bringing these chests from here to the shore, for, of course,\r\nwe could not reveal the nature of their contents.  No; I propose to\r\ncart the whole of the treasure back to the house, stow it away in small\r\nboxes that are convenient to handle, and bury the boxes a few feet\r\nunder the floor.\"\r\n\r\nEach member of the party thereupon filled his haversack with as much\r\ngold as it would hold, until the stout canvas straps cut into the\r\nshoulders of the wearers; and thus laden they retraced their steps,\r\narriving on the surface in a breathless and exhausted condition.\r\n\r\nHere the loads were redistributed, and making better progress, the\r\nwearied adventurers arrived at their dwelling just as the sun dipped\r\nbeyond the lofty peak of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\"A SAIL!  A SAIL!\"\r\n\r\nTwice daily on each of the succeeding days Mr. McKay and his companions\r\npaid a hurried visit to the treasure-cave, and at the end of that time\r\nthe bulk of the buccaneers' spoil was safely hidden in the spot chosen\r\nfor its reception.\r\n\r\nThen, with the return of the spring tides, the work of salving the yawl\r\nwas resumed.\r\n\r\nSlowly, yet without a hitch, the sunken craft was moved towards the\r\ncradle which awaited its burden, till the falling off of the tides\r\nfound the yawl within ten yards of low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking, pater,\" observed Andy one day, as they were\r\npreparing to revisit the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking what, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, every journey we make to the cavern we perform practically\r\nempty-handed.  Would it not be well to carry a supply of provisions\r\nwith us and store them in the cave?  You see, if those savages should\r\nreturn we might be glad of a retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true, though I sincerely hope we shall not be put to such\r\nstraits.  However, we'll take a few barrels of provisions and some\r\nrifles and ammunition as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but that's the rub.  Water is heavy to carry about, and as far as\r\nI can see there's no spring or brook within a mile of the entrance to\r\nthe cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if there's water to be found above the cliffs in which lies\r\nthe mouth of the tunnel.  I noticed several small streams when I\r\nclimbed the mountain, though, of course, I didn't ascend on that side.\r\nI think I'll explore that slope as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not to-day?  Ellerton and you can do so while we are making our\r\nmidday trip back to the house.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, instead of ascending the tunnel with Mr. McKay and\r\nTerence, the two chums clambered up the face of the cliff.  At the top\r\nthey found that the land sloped steeply towards the peak, the ground\r\nbeing thickly covered with stunted bushes and occasional clumps of\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Hoppy,\" remarked Andy, as they sat down to recover their\r\nbreadth after their fatiguing climb.  \"It's all very well living on an\r\nisland when everything goes well, but we can't say that it is now.\r\nPerhaps it's a useless fear, but I fear that there's always the\r\npossibility of those savage brutes coming back here in overwhelming\r\nnumbers and wiping us out.  That does not tend to make things\r\ncomfortable, although it may tend to liven things up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they had such a terrible smashing last time,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"True!  But didn't we give them a good licking when they pursued us in\r\ntheir canoes?  That didn't prevent them repeating their unwelcome\r\nattentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you don't mean to show the white feather, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I.  If there's a dust-up, I'll do my best; but, at the same time,\r\nI shan't be sorry to get the yawl repaired and say good-bye to the\r\nisland.  The treasure can wait till we charter a steamer to fetch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the savages haven't returned, so we can still make the best of\r\nthings,\" replied Ellerton cheerfully.  \"But we must be moving or we'll\r\nfind no water.\"\r\n\r\nThe two lads had not gone fifty yards ere they came across a small\r\nstream.  Andy bent down, and raising some of the water in the palm of\r\nhis hand applied it to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Fresh as one could wish,\" he pronounced.\r\n\r\n\"Good!  Now we'll follow its course and see if it approaches the mouth\r\nof the cave.\"\r\n\r\nThe rivulet, for it was nothing more, wended its way in an almost\r\nsemicircular direction, till, at about two hundred yards from where the\r\nlads had struck it, it emptied itself into a rift in the rocks, the\r\nsplash of its fall echoing dimly from apparently unfathomable depths.\r\n\r\n\"Look!  We are not very far from that part of the cliff that overhangs\r\nthe mouth of the cave,\" exclaimed Ellerton.  \"What is to prevent us\r\nfrom digging a shallow trench and conducting the water right to the\r\nentrance to the tunnel?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fairly hard rock,\" objected Andy, \"It will be no end of a task\r\ncutting a new watercourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can use some of the cast-iron pipes we brought ashore,\"\r\ncontinued the young seaman, determined not to be overcome by early\r\ndifficulties.  \"There are more than enough to cover this distance, and\r\nby damming the stream we can----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's all very well, but if we are compelled to beat a retreat\r\nto the cave the savages will find the pipes and so discover our\r\nhiding-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that will make but little difference.  The trail from the\r\nhouse up the mouth of the tunnel is so well defined that a blind man\r\nmight follow it.  Why, whatever is the matter with you, Andy?  You seem\r\nto throw cold water on every suggestion that is made.  You are not\r\nalways like that.  Are you ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I am,\" replied Andy.  \"At least, I do not feel quite up to\r\nthe mark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's get back,\" said Ellerton, and assisting his chum over the\r\nrough ground the pair returned to the mouth of the tunnel just as the\r\nothers were emerging.\r\n\r\n\"Any luck?\" asked Mr. McKay cheerfully; then realising that his son\r\nlooked ill, he exclaimed: \"What have you been doing, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, father.  I feel absolutely rotten.\"\r\n\r\nThey managed to get him back to the house, his teeth chattering with\r\nthe cold; but before night he was in a high fever.  His father\r\nadministered liberal doses of quinine, of which there was a plentiful\r\nsupply; but, in spite of this remedy, the lad's illness increased, and\r\nbefore morning he was in a delirium, raving about the sunken yawl and\r\nthe savages.  More than once he attempted to leave his bed and seize a\r\nrifle, and it required the united efforts of Mr. McKay, Ellerton, and\r\nTerence to hold him down.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious time.  Mr. McKay had had experience of this kind of\r\nmalady, and knew that should the patient leave his bed and take cold,\r\nhe must die.\r\n\r\nFor forty-eight hours Mr. McKay, the two lads, and Quexo kept ceaseless\r\nwatch, the mulatto being particularly attentive in his duties; but at\r\nlength the feverish state was succeeded by a profuse sweat, and Mr.\r\nMcKay knew that for the present the dreaded disaster was averted.\r\n\r\nDuring the lengthy period of convalescence, someone had to be within\r\ncall of the patient, but the others resumed their outdoor occupation.\r\n\r\nMost of the traces of the last visit of the savages had been removed;\r\nthe cliff-path leading up from the shore had been fortified by the\r\nerection of a loop-holed palisade, so as to command the approach by\r\nrifle-fire; while the remainder of the treasure had been brought from\r\nthe cave to the house, and the former was well provisioned in case of\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nEllerton also found time to carry out his project of conducting fresh\r\nwater into the cave.  By the aid of Terence and Quexo he contrived to\r\nlay a line of pipes from the stream down the slope to the edge of the\r\ncliff overhanging the entrance, whence a tiny cascade fell over the\r\nrocks within a few feet of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nLater on, at Mr. McKay's suggestion, the line of iron pipes was\r\ncontinued down the face of the cliff, though concealed by the bushes,\r\nand carried a few yards into the tunnel.  For most of that distance the\r\npipes were covered by the thick dust, till sufficiently far from the\r\nentrance to enable the occupants to defend the end of the aqueduct if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe water, on escaping, ran down the incline, till absorbed by the\r\npumice dust, although by degrees it cut for itself a channel close to\r\nthe sides of the tunnel.  Thus a plentiful supply of the precious\r\nliquid was assured, and at the same time no inconvenience was caused by\r\nthe waste turning the floor of the passage into a swamp.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season was shortly due, and unable, on account of Andy's\r\nweakness, to complete the salvage of the yawl, since every available\r\nhand was necessary, the wrecked boat was again rafted farther out into\r\nthe lagoon and allowed to sink to the bottom, so as to lie in safety\r\nduring the on-shore gales.\r\n\r\nOne morning Ellerton set out as usual to attend to the sheep, which\r\nwere in a thriving state, having so increased in numbers that new\r\npasture grounds had to be provided for them.\r\n\r\nIt was then blowing strongly from the north-east and almost dead on\r\nshore.  Happening to glance seaward, he was surprised to see a topsail\r\nschooner, under close-reefed canvas, running past the island.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or so he remained gazing with astonishment at the unwonted\r\nsight: then, recovering himself, he ran as hard as he could to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"A sail!  A sail!\" he exclaimed breathlessly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A SAIL!  A SAIL!\" HE EXCLAIMED BREATHLESSLY]\r\n\r\nEveryone, including Andy, ran out of the house, and, as Ellerton had\r\nannounced, there was the schooner now abreast of the entrance of the\r\nlagoon, but still keeping on her course to the south-west.\r\n\r\n\"Bring out the signal-book and the flags,\" ordered Mr. McKay.  \"And\r\nyou, Quexo, make a fire.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton soon returned with the bunting, and the Union Jack was hoisted\r\nto the masthead.  The mulatto procured some dry wood from the store,\r\nand set it in a blaze.  When well alight, he piled a quantity of damp\r\nleaves upon the fire, causing a thick smoke.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the strong wind prevented the vapour from rising, the\r\nsmoke drifting over the ground in thick, suffocating columns, but to\r\nthe castaways' great joy the vessel hoisted her ensign.  It was the\r\nFrench tricolour.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Mr. McKay.  \"Now lads, hand me N and C.\"\r\n\r\nThe next instant the N and C flags, signifying in the International\r\ncode, \"_Want assistance_\" were fluttering from the mast.\r\n\r\nThrough the telescope the inhabitants of McKay's Island could see the\r\noilskin-clad figure of the French skipper, his neatly-trimmed moustache\r\nand imperial as correct as if he were on the boulevards of Paris,\r\nrushing hither and thither, and giving his orders with much waving of\r\nhis arms.  Then, as a string of flags ran up to her main truck, the\r\nschooner was hove-to.\r\n\r\n\"_D.C.--Are coming to your assistance_,\" read Mr. McKay, referring to\r\nhis signal-book.  \"By Jove! that won't do, the boat will be swamped,\"\r\nfor already some of the crew were manning the falls.\r\n\r\n\"Sharp there,\" he continued, \"'_E.Y.--Do not attempt to land in your\r\nboat_.'  That will stop them; but there's no denying that they are\r\nplucky fellows.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the signal, the crew of the French schooner gave up\r\ntheir attempt, and a lengthy interchange of signals was kept up, the\r\nFrenchman promising to report the presence of the castaways at the\r\nfirst port she touched; then, with a farewell dip of her ensign, she\r\nflung about, and half an hour later she was lost in the haze.\r\n\r\n\"That's a load off our minds,\" remarked Mr. McKay.  \"We can reasonably\r\nexpect help in a month at the very outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless she is blown out of her course, for a gale is freshening,\"\r\nreplied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, the chances are greatly in our favour, though at the\r\nsame time we must not cease our efforts to work out our salvation.\r\nThis gale will doubtless mark the end of the rainy season, so we can\r\nhope to renew our efforts to salve the yawl within the next few days.\"\r\n\r\nBut, contrary to Mr. McKay's expectations, the weather continued bad\r\nfor nearly a month and, although a sharp look-out was kept by day and\r\nthe searchlights flashed nightly, no vessel appeared in sight.\r\nAlternate hopes and fears did not tend to improve the spirits of the\r\ncastaways, and ere the fine weather set in their condition was\r\nbordering on acute depression, in spite of their individual efforts to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a long spell of rainy weather, the sun burst forth in\r\nall its splendour, the wind went away, and the island appeared under a\r\ntotally different aspect from that which it had shown during the last\r\nsix months.  With the return of the dry season, the spirits of the\r\ncastaways likewise rose, and energetically they resumed their outdoor\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThe submerged yawl was, so far as they could see, little the worse for\r\nits prolonged rest on the bed of the lagoon, and by dint of hard and\r\npainstaking work she was moved nearer to the shore than she had been\r\nsince the disastrous day when she had been scuttled by the natives.\r\n\r\n\"It will be new moon to-morrow at about ten o'clock,\" announced Mr.\r\nMcKay.  \"Consequently there will be a fairly high tide at noon, so we\r\ncan reasonably hope for sufficient water to float the yawl to the\r\ncradle.  Everything is ready, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Ellerton.  \"I finished rigging the tackle this\r\nmorning, and the cradle is properly ballasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!  Then we'll make the attempt to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA FALSE AND A REAL ALARM\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak everyone was up and eager for the fray, and directly\r\nbreakfast was over they sallied down to the shore.  It was still pitch\r\ndark, but the time of dead low water made it absolutely necessary that\r\noperations should commence ere the sun rose.\r\n\r\nBy the light of several lanterns the slack of the hawsers was taken in\r\nand the two canoes pinned down so far as the united efforts of all\r\nhands would permit.  Nothing more could be done till the rising of the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThe cradle, its ends marked by long poles to indicate its position at\r\nhigh water, was already run out so far as the lines of the slipway\r\nextended, a rope being fastened to it from the windlass ashore.\r\n\r\nAnxiously the little group of workers watched the tide rise slowly,\r\ninch by inch, up the temporary tide gauge.  Sometimes it paused as a\r\n\"false ebb\" in the offing stayed its progress, till at length it crept\r\nwithin a few inches of its predicted height.\r\n\r\n\"There's enough water now, I fancy,\" announced Ellerton, \"so heave\r\naway.  Gently does it!\"\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious time.  Slowly the two canoes were warped shore wards,\r\nguided by a pair of ropes abeam so as to insure the wrecked boat being\r\ndeposited evenly on the cradle.  Already the two outer poles of the\r\ncradle were passed, when a slight shock told the salvors that the\r\nyawl's forefoot had touched the cradle.\r\n\r\n\"Avast there!\" shouted Ellerton to Terence and Quexo, who were hauling\r\non the shore.\r\n\r\n\"There's not enough water,\" exclaimed Andy, with dismay written on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes yet before high water,\" announced Mr. McKay.  \"Will she do\r\nit, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Ellerton slipped off his clothes and plunged over the side\r\nof the canoe.  Mr. McKay and Andy could follow his movements as he\r\ndescended with slow yet powerful strokes, till he disappeared from view\r\nbeneath the submerged craft.  Half a minute later he reappeared, and\r\nswam alongside the canoe, into which he was assisted by the eager\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n\"She'll do it,\" he announced, when he had recovered his breath.  \"We\r\nare a bit out in our reckoning; her keel is touching the side of the\r\ncradle.\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the yawl was lying immediately over the slipway, the\r\nslings were cast off, and slowly she settled upon the carriage prepared\r\nfor her reception.  The canoes were warped clear, and all that remained\r\nto be done was to man the winch and heave the cradle above high-water\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the broiling sun, the work of winding the winch was begun,\r\nfor the delighted lads would not be persuaded to delay the operation\r\ntill the cool of the day.  Foot by foot the cradle came home, till the\r\nhuge barnacle-covered hull began to appear above the water.\r\n\r\n\"What a state she's in,\" exclaimed Andy, as the lads rested from their\r\nlabours, for they were thoroughly played out.  \"There's a week's\r\nscraping in front of us before we can do anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better see about baling her out?\" asked Terence.  \"Directly\r\nshe ceases to be water-borne the pressure of the water will burst her\r\nseams.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"The water will find its way out\r\nof the hole that the natives made in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess the motor is pretty rusty,\" continued Terence.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be,\" Andy replied.  \"You see, I kept it smothered in\r\ngrease, and unless those brutes smashed it, it ought to be capable of\r\nbeing repaired.  But I am awfully anxious to see, so what do you say to\r\nanother turn at the winch?\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the lads resumed their work of hauling up the cradle, till\r\nnearly the whole of the streaming, weed-covered hull--a forlorn waif\r\nfrom the sea--was visible.\r\n\r\n\"Another five yards, lads,\" exclaimed Ellerton cheerfully.  \"Now, put\r\nmore beef into it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there was a warning shout from Mr. McKay, but the warning\r\ncame too late.  Ere the lads could realise the extent of their\r\nmisfortune the cradle collapsed and the hull of the yawl crashed over\r\non her side.\r\n\r\nWith a horrible rending of the shattered timbers, the enormous mass\r\npitched fairly on a jagged rock; the next instant the object of so many\r\nmonths' tedious toil lay on its broadside, hopelessly damaged.\r\n\r\nFor quite a minute all hands gazed in speechless grief upon the scene\r\nof calamity.  To have the fruits of victory snatched from their lips\r\nseemed almost more than they could realise, till by degrees the extent\r\nof their misfortune began to assert itself.\r\n\r\n\"Is she really done for?\" said Andy, his voice barely raised above a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, her back's broken,\" replied his father.  \"She will never float\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, by George!\" announced Andy, speaking in a tone that surprised\r\nhis companions by its resolution, \"I won't be done.  I begin to build\r\nanother craft to-morrow.  Come on, pater, let's get something to eat,\r\nand after that we'll set out the plans for our new craft.  Buck up,\r\nHoppy, it's no use crying over spilt milk.\"\r\n\r\nInspired by their companion's cheerfulness, the lads turned their backs\r\nupon the scene of their ill-favoured labours and set off towards the\r\nhouse.  They now felt specially anxious to devote their energies to the\r\nnew task that lay before them, and already their late misfortune was\r\nbeing regarded as a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\"Without wishing to discourage you, Andy,\" began Mr. McKay, after the\r\nmeal was over, \"I think we had better give up all idea of building\r\nanother craft.  I've been going carefully into this matter, and I'll\r\ntell you why I form this conclusion.  You see there's no timber growing\r\non this island that can be used, and our own stock is insufficient even\r\nif we make use of the planks of the wrecked yawl.  So I think the best\r\nthing we can do is to convert one of the canoes----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought we had already decided that they are unsuitable and\r\nunseaworthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  As they are at present I should hesitate to make a long\r\nvoyage in one of them, although the natives frequently travel great\r\ndistances in this type of craft.  So I think if we give the smallest\r\ncanoe--for that one seems the handiest--a good keelson, bolt a false\r\nkeel into it, and provide her with some stout timbers and stringers,\r\nshe'll answer our purpose.  We can use most of the deck planks of the\r\nyawl to deck-in the canoe.  Her sails and most of her gear will come in\r\nhandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would certainly save a lot of work,\" replied Andy, for in calmer\r\nmoments the size of his proposed task had begun to assert itself.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's make a start,\" added Ellerton.  \"There's no time like the\r\npresent, so I vote we begin to dismantle the remains of the yawl,\r\nexamine and overhaul her canvas, and remove the ballast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't measured the smallest canoe,\" remarked Andy.  \"What's her\r\nlength, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twenty-eight feet in length, nine in breadth, and two feet\r\ndraught, though with the addition of a false keel and ballast she will\r\ndraw at least four feet.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly all hands set to work with a will, and ere nightfall the\r\nshattered hull of the yawl was a mere shell, the gear being stowed away\r\nin the lower storehouse.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we'll make a start with the canoe,\" said Ellerton, as they\r\nprepared to retire for the night.  \"There are plenty of pieces of\r\ntimber to shore her up, and wedges can easily be made.  Before the end\r\nof the week we ought to have her keel and keelson bolted on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then sleep well on it,\" added Mr. McKay, \"for there's much to be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of McKay's Island had already made their customary\r\nsignal with the searchlight, the power had been switched off, and the\r\ncanvas hood placed over the instrument for the purpose of protecting it\r\nfrom the night dews.  This routine was always the last ere the day's\r\nwork ended.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay was about to close the door of the dwelling-house when a\r\nrapid and prolonged ringing of the electric alarm bell broke upon the\r\nstillness of the night.\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a rush for the arms-rack where the rifles were kept\r\nready for immediate use, and, securing their weapons, the whole party\r\nmade for the open, Terence, according to a prearranged plan, running to\r\nthe powerhouse to switch on the current, while the others took up their\r\nposition at the palisade commanding the cliff-path.\r\n\r\nThe night was pitch dark; a light breeze ruffled the palm trees, but\r\nbeyond that all was still.  Peering into the darkness the defenders\r\nwaited, finger on trigger, to open fire on the first appearance of the\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nThen the alarm bell began to ring again.\r\n\r\n\"There's someone climbing the path,\" whispered Ellerton, when the din\r\nhad died away.\r\n\r\n\"I wish Terence would hurry up with the searchlight; we could then see\r\nwho the intruders are.  There it is again,\" as the clanging of the bell\r\ncommenced for the third time.\r\n\r\nIn his natural anxiety and haste, Terence fumbled over his task, but at\r\nlength the carbons fused and the giant beam of the searchlight threw\r\nits dazzling rays seaward.  Then, trained by Donaghue's guiding hand,\r\nit swept the lower terraces and the beach, but neither hostile canvas\r\nnor lurking bloodthirsty warriors came within its blinding glare.\r\n\r\n\"There's someone moving down there,\" exclaimed Andy, pointing towards\r\nthe foot of the steep path.  \"See!  To the right of that great boulder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged if I can,\" muttered Ellerton.  Nevertheless he took aim with\r\nhis rifle at the spot indicated by his chum.\r\n\r\n\"It's only the shadows thrown by the moving beam,\" said Mr. McKay.\r\n\"Terence, keep the light steady for a moment, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThe now stationary ray revealed the fact that some moving object was\r\ncreeping cautiously over the rock-strewn beach immediately at the end\r\nof the path.\r\n\r\n\"There's someone down there,\" whispered Ellerton, and almost as he\r\nspoke the alarm bell resumed its shrill warning.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going down to see who or what it is,\" announced Mr. McKay, leaning\r\nhis rifle against the stockade and drawing a revolver.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Andy, Ellerton and Quexo, he descended the steep and\r\nrugged path.\r\n\r\nAll at once Mr. McKay burst into a hearty laugh, his companions joining\r\nin as soon as they perceived the cause of his mirth.  A huge turtle had\r\ncrawled across the beach and was digging a hole in the sand with its\r\nflippers.  This had set the alarm bell ringing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUGE TURTLE HAD CRAWLED ACROSS THE BEACH AND HAD SET\r\nTHE ALARM BELL RINGING]\r\n\r\nAs the larder needed filling, the turtle was dispatched and dragged up\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the forenoon of the next day ere the inmates turned out\r\nof their beds, for the previous night's diversion had deprived them of\r\na fair share of their accustomed sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Buck up and fill the kettle, Quexo,\" shouted Andy \"I'm right hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThe mulatto, taking a can in his hand, set out for the stream, but\r\nhardly had he stepped outside the door when he returned with\r\nconsternation written all over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Massa!  Massa!\" he gasped.  \"Canoes!  Heap, plenty, much, great\r\ncanoes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT INVASION\r\n\r\nQuexo's warning was only too true.  Less than a mile from the reef the\r\nsea was dotted with the brown mat sails of a large fleet of native\r\ncraft all heading for the island.\r\n\r\n\"Forty canoes at least, by Jove!\" ejaculated Mr. McKay.  \"And taking\r\ntwenty men to each--a low average--that means there are eight hundred\r\nof the wretches making straight for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's long odds,\" replied Ellerton grimly, \"but we'll do our best, and\r\nperhaps we may find a means of driving them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought the last little surprise would have settled\r\nthem.  We must give them credit for their persistence.  There's one\r\nthing to our advantage, though; it's a day attack, and we are more or\r\nless prepared for it.  But what are they up to now?\"\r\n\r\nThe advancing canoes had now reached the entrance to the lagoon, and,\r\nwith marvellous precision, their sails were lowered, and the crews took\r\nto their paddles.  Then, instead of heading straight for the beach, the\r\nwhole flotilla turned its course parallel with the shore.\r\n\r\n\"That's bad,\" remarked Mr. McKay, pausing in the act of dragging a box\r\nof ammunition from the house to the stockade.  \"They have learnt a\r\nlesson, and now they mean to take us on the flank or in the rear.  Come\r\non, lads, there's no time to be lost.  We must follow them and see if\r\nwe can prevent them landing.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the savages' idea of strategy was not very advanced.\r\nInstead of keeping one section of their fleet for the purpose of making\r\na feint or a frontal attack while the other canoes skirted the island,\r\nthe whole of the boats kept together.\r\n\r\nLoaded with ammunition-belts and carrying their rifles, the little band\r\nof defenders toiled up the path leading to the interior till they\r\nreached the summit of the cliffs overlooking the house.  Then, bearing\r\naway to the left, they hastened to keep pace with their savage invaders.\r\n\r\nThrough the palm-groves, fighting their way between patches of thick,\r\nprickly scrub, Mr. McKay and his companions continued their wearisome\r\nmarch, till, from the summit of the ridge that separated their bay from\r\nthe one where they had first landed, they saw that the hostile canoes\r\nhad gained considerably.\r\n\r\nThe usually calm waters of the lagoon were broken into thousands of\r\nripples by the swift-moving craft, while the cliffs re-echoed to the\r\nregular beats of their paddles.  Yet, without attempting to land on\r\nthat part of the shore, the savages continued their roundabout voyage.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use going any farther,\" gasped Mr. McKay breathlessly.  \"We\r\nare only tiring ourselves out to no purpose.  A hundred well-armed men\r\nwould be powerless to prevent them landing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must return to the house and make every possible use of the few\r\nhours that as yet remain to us.  I quite admit I have been guilty of a\r\nserious error of omission.  While paying great attention to our seaward\r\ndefences, we have entirely neglected the landward approach.\"\r\n\r\nOn return to the terrace on which stood the dwelling-house and the\r\npower-station, the already wearied defenders immediately set to work to\r\nfortify the approach from the interior of the island.\r\n\r\nSixty yards from the house began the narrow defile that afforded a road\r\nbetween the settlement and the treasure cave.  On either side the\r\ncliffs towered to nearly one hundred feet, so that once the savages\r\ntook possession of those heights the terrace could not be held.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we cannot launch one of the canoes, provision her, and make\r\na dash for safety?\" asked Terence.\r\n\r\n\"It's too risky,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"If seen, we should be overhauled\r\nin less than half-an-hour.  No, we must stick to this place and hold it\r\nto the last, so let's set to at once.\"\r\n\r\nWith the energy of despair all hands worked with feverish desperation,\r\ntheir loaded rifles lying within easy reach, while every moment they\r\nexpected to hear the savage shouts of their bloodthirsty foes.\r\n\r\nAcross the foot of the defile they dug a shallow trench, lining the\r\ninner side with boxes, crates, and other articles so as to form a\r\nbarricade.  It was a feeble defence at the most, but with five skilled\r\nriflemen armed with modern rifles behind it, the breastwork might serve\r\nits purpose.\r\n\r\nTo guard against a shower of missiles from the summit of the adjacent\r\ncliffs, a lean-to roof of stout planks was hastily constructed, earth\r\nbeing thrown upon it to deaden the shock of heavy stones, while the\r\nremaining boxes of ammunition were brought up so that the supply was\r\nready to hand.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Quexo,\" said Mr. McKay, \"go to the stockade at the top of\r\nthe cliff-path, and keep watch.  Don't move, whatever happens, till we\r\ncall you, even if you hear us firing; but if you see any signs of the\r\nsavages landing on the beach, fire your rifle.  You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas, massa,\" replied the mulatto, and snatching up his rifle he ran to\r\nhis appointed post as quickly as his legs could carry him.\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't forget water and provisions, Ellerton,\" said Mr. McKay.\r\n\"They must be brought ready to hand, for if the fighting is prolonged\r\nwe will have no time to go to the house for food and drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bring some biscuits and water,\" replied Ellerton.  \"I remember\r\nhow dry I was during the last attack.  But, do you know, sir, I begin\r\nto feel quite hopeful, now our defences are completed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's certainly improved the situation, Hoppy,\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\"But we've a tough job in front of us.  Eight or nine hundred savages,\r\neach eager for a fight and keen on plundering us.  We must not be\r\nover-confident.  But now cut off and get the provisions and water.\"\r\n\r\nEllerton quickly performed his task, and, having placed the water and\r\nbiscuits in the spot indicated by Mr. McKay, he observed:\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity we can't use some of that dynamite again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot make the trucks run up hill, and, besides, there are no\r\nrails, if that's what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I know that,\" was the reply, \"but I thought that if we could\r\nplace a few tins of the stuff on those rocks we could easily manage to\r\nput a bullet through them at two hundred yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means we'll try it,\" said Mr. McKay heartily.  \"As I've often\r\nsaid, you're a brick.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Ellerton ran to the cave where the explosive was stored,\r\nand returned at a walking pace with nearly forty pounds of the\r\ndangerous compound.\r\n\r\n\"Don't use all of it,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"Here, take these three tins;\r\nthey'll be a better mark for us.\"\r\n\r\nInto each of the metal boxes Ellerton placed about ten pounds of the\r\nexplosive, adding a few handfuls of iron, nails, and bits of scrap\r\nmetal.  Then, climbing over the breastwork, he was handed the\r\nrough-and-ready bombs.\r\n\r\nThus laden he cautiously made his way up the rough defile till he\r\nreached a spot about two hundred yards from the defenders' position.\r\n\r\nHere a mass of fallen rock, the highest part ten feet in height, formed\r\na suitable site for his operations, and without mishap the tin\r\ncanisters were placed in such a position that they could readily be\r\nseen above the heads of any number of savages likely to come between\r\nthem and the defences.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. McKay was busily engaged in preparing a number of\r\nhand-bombs, charging several small tins with explosive mixed with\r\nnails, and lashing a short length of thin rope securely to each\r\ncompleted missile.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to place these things here,\" said he, pointing to a small\r\ncleft in the cliff.  \"Be careful not to knock them, or we shall punish\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to throw them?\" asked Ellerton, who had meanwhile\r\nreturned from his expedition.  \"If they fall too close they will do us\r\nharm, and I don't think they can be thrown more than the length of a\r\ncricket-pitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"By this,\" replied Mr. McKay, holding up a short stick with a notch cut\r\nin one end.  \"I lay the rope along the stick and jam its end between\r\nthe palm of my hand and the wood.  By swinging the stick a greatly\r\nincreased power is obtained; at the right moment the cord is released\r\nand the bomb flies off at a tangent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" replied Ellerton, and although he had great faith in Mr.\r\nMcKay, he found himself wondering what the result would be did the\r\nmissile not fly off at the correct tangent.\r\n\r\nSlowly the hours dragged, for, all the preparations for the defence\r\nbeing completed, the tedious and nerve-racking ordeal of waiting for\r\nthe fray told more upon the energies of the defenders than would the\r\nactual fight.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking low ere the alert watchers detected the distant\r\nshouts of the savages.\r\n\r\n\"They've found the trail leading to the cave, I fancy,\" remarked Mr.\r\nMcKay.  \"They'll be here before dark, unless I'm much mistaken.\r\nTerence, you had better start the dynamo and see that the searchlight\r\nis ready for use.  Tell Quexo to come here and take your place.  You\r\nmust take sole charge of the seaward side of our defences.  Now,\r\nlisten: whatever you do, don't train the searchlight this way till I\r\ndischarge my rifle.  Keep the rays playing on the shore, and\r\noccasionally flash the beam skywards.  It may bring us aid.  When you\r\nhear the shot, slew the projector round and direct the beam straight up\r\nthe defile.  You quite understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Terence.  \"You can rely upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel sure of it,\" was the quiet reply, as the lad set off on his\r\nresponsible and single-handed task.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be dark,\" said Ellerton.  \"That will be all the better\r\nfor us, for these brutes won't find their way so easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the darkness will stop them, provided they are not\r\nafraid of it.  These savages can find their way by night like cats.\r\nHullo, Quexo, tired, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, massa, not berry tired.  One eye he go sleep, den oder eye he go\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quexo means to go to sleep with one eye open,\" said Andy.  \"We ought\r\nto take a leaf from his book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll feel the want of sleep as much as anything,\" replied his\r\nfather.  \"Once the attack opens there will be little respite.  It\r\nwouldn't be a bad idea if you three were to snatch a few moments' rest.\r\nI'll wake you up in time, never fear.\"\r\n\r\nThis advice was acted upon, Andy, Ellerton, and Quexo stretching\r\nthemselves out on the ground at the foot of the barricade, and in a few\r\nminutes, in spite of their risky position, the lads were sleeping\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nNight had now fallen, and the ghostly white beams of the searchlight\r\nswept the shore, the noise of the distant surf mingling with the\r\nsubdued fizzing of the carbons as Terence diligently attended to the\r\nworking of the projector.\r\n\r\nThe far-off shouts of the savages had now ceased.  Probably the\r\ninvaders, satisfied with the success of their unopposed landing, were\r\nawaiting the dawn ere they commenced their attack.\r\n\r\nSilence, when intent upon a hand-to-hand conflict, was a stranger to\r\nthem, and for this Mr. McKay was thankful, since few things are more\r\ntrying than the expectation of a sudden onslaught by an unseen and\r\nunheard foe.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this peculiarity on the part of the invaders, Mr. McKay\r\ndid not for one moment relax his vigilance.  Rifle in hand he stood,\r\nrarely altering his position, and gazed stedfastly in the direction of\r\nthe defile, his ears alert for the faintest footfall or shout that\r\nmight denote the approach of the bloodthirsty savages.\r\n\r\nAlthough the defenders were cut off from their carefully prepared\r\nretreat in the treasure cave, another shelter yet remained.  The cavern\r\nwhere Blight had been kept a prisoner had been since used as a\r\ntemporary storehouse for several casks of provisions.  As a last\r\nresource it could be held, possibly for a month.\r\n\r\nBut if the natives took the island and showed no disposition to leave,\r\nafter having plundered the white man's possessions, even that refuge\r\nwould be a means of only prolonging the sufferings of the defenders.\r\n\r\nHopeful as he generally was, Mr. McKay fully realised that he and his\r\ncompanions were in a very tight fix, and unless the skill and resource\r\nof civilisation could overcome the superior numbers and reckless\r\ncourage of the savages, nothing short of a timely rescue would save the\r\ndefenders from death.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. McKay found himself counting the number of days which had\r\nelapsed since the French schooner had exchanged signals with the\r\nisland.  Even allowing for light winds and calms she would have had\r\ntime to reach some port, and, should the captain keep his word, a\r\ngunboat or at least a trading vessel might be on her way to the rescue.\r\n\r\nMr. McKay's thoughts were interrupted by a loud chorus of savage shouts\r\nat no great distance, then came the confused noise of scuffling feet\r\ntearing down the defile.\r\n\r\n\"Up with you,\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nBut the warning was unnecessary, for the three lads, awakened by the\r\nnoise, were already standing to their arms.\r\n\r\n\"It's the sheep!\" exclaimed Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"The savages have frightened them, and they are running this way for\r\nshelter,\" said Andy.  \"That means that the natives will soon be at\r\ntheir heels.\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified sheep continued their flight till they found their\r\nadvance checked by the barricade, and in a confused, struggling mass\r\nthey herded into the corner formed by the breastwork and the adjoining\r\ncliff, their loud baa-ing adding to the confusion.\r\n\r\nThen upon the brow of the rise at the end of the defile appeared a\r\nmultitude of lights, and with fierce shouts the savages tore down the\r\nrough inclined path straight for the barricade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITH FIERCE SHOUTS THE SAVAGES TORE DOWN THE PATH\r\nSTRAIGHT FOR THE BARRICADE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nA GREAT DISASTER\r\n\r\nThe natives had furnished themselves with torches made from the\r\nbranches of resinous trees, and in the ruddy flare the painted bodies\r\nof the warriors made an easy mark.\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred yards,\" said Mr. McKay, setting up the backsight of his\r\nrifle.  \"Fire rapidly, but aim low.  We may check the rush before they\r\ncome to close quarters.\"\r\n\r\nThe sharp reports of the rifles echoed along the rocky walls of the\r\ndefile, and a series of loud shrieks told that the fire had not been in\r\nvain.  Yet the onward rush was apparently unchecked, for though several\r\nof the torches were extinguished, the savages still rushed to the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the searchlight?\" muttered Mr. McKay, as he thrust a fresh\r\nclip of cartridges into his magazine.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the giant beam swung majestically round and fixed itself\r\nupon the gorge.\r\n\r\nUnder the powerful rays the scene of horror was thrown into high\r\nrelief.  The upper part of the defile was literally choked with human\r\nbeings.  A few of the foremost warriors, drawing clear of the press,\r\nhad managed to evade the death-dealing volleys, and with brandished\r\nclubs and spears were rushing upon the barricade.\r\n\r\nThis much the defenders saw as the first flash of the searchlight was\r\nthrown upon the scene.  The next instant the shouts of triumph and pain\r\ngave place to cries of terror.\r\n\r\nThe blinding rays, coming apparently from out of the earth, were far\r\nmore to be feared than the bullets.  To the savage mind it was\r\nmagic--black magic.\r\n\r\nThe warlike mob seemed to melt away.  Some of the warriors, throwing\r\ndown their weapons, rushed from the scene of action with their arms\r\npressed tightly across their eyes as if to shut out the penetrating\r\nbeams; others dropped where they stood, grovelling in the dust and\r\nuttering cries, while in the space of five minutes the defile was\r\ndeserted, save by the dead and wounded and a few of the natives, whose\r\nterror seemed to have rooted them to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"That's spotted them!\" exclaimed Andy, as he threw down his over-heated\r\nrifle.  \"I hope it will scare them right off the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has worked wonders,\" assented Mr. McKay.  \"But be careful, some of\r\nthose men are not dead, I feel sure.  Bring down every man you see\r\nmoving.\"\r\n\r\nRifle on shoulder the lads waited.  They quite realised the danger of\r\nallowing the natives to lurk in the defile, and as each cautiously\r\nmoving body could be seen, as a terrified warrior slowly recovered from\r\nhis panic, a carefully aimed shot caused him to fall.\r\n\r\n\"We are comparatively secure till daylight,\" said Mr. McKay.  \"They've\r\nhad another lesson.  Andy, you might relieve Terence at the\r\nsearchlight.  Keep it fixed on the defile, though at intervals you\r\nmight direct it seawards.  Quexo, I want you to carry up as many pails\r\nof water as you can to Blight's cave.  Ellerton, you're feeling fit, I\r\nhope?  Will you keep a look-out, I am going to have forty winks.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an exaggerated \"forty winks.\"  Mr. McKay, dead beat with his\r\nexertions, slept like a log till daybreak, Terence keeping him company.\r\n\r\nEllerton had meanwhile climbed over the stockade and succeeded in\r\nbringing back several of the terrified sheep, which throughout the\r\nnight had been huddled together in helpless terror.\r\n\r\nBeyond an occasional shot as a few of the wretched natives attempted to\r\nwriggle out of the death-trap, the rest of the night had passed without\r\nfurther disturbance; but the dawn revealed a different state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe discomfited savages were evidently built of stern stuff, for as\r\nsoon as it was light, undaunted by their defeat in the hours of\r\ndarkness, they took possession of the summit of the cliff overlooking\r\nthe defenders' lines.\r\n\r\nStanding on the very edge of the precipice, like bronzed statues,\r\nseveral of the chiefs surveyed the scene beneath them, till, having\r\ntaken in all that they wanted, they withdrew to the main body of\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nInstantly the fierce shouts of the savages rent the air, and a shower\r\nof stones and throwing-spears was hurled upon the white men's defences.\r\n\r\nThe missiles rattled on the iron roof of the house and upon the top of\r\nthe shelter over the searchlight; but the defenders, safe within the\r\ncovered-in barricade, were secure from the furious hail, though unable\r\nto reply by a single shot.  Several of the sheep were transfixed by\r\nspears, each casualty being greeted with a hoarse roar of delight from\r\nthe attackers.\r\n\r\nTerence, however, who had returned to his post at the seaward side of\r\nthe terrace, saw the possibility of the searchlight being damaged by\r\nstones, and, regardless of the danger, he rushed from his shelter to\r\nplace a screen of planks over the partially exposed instrument.\r\n\r\nHis appearance was the signal for a redoubled discharge of missiles,\r\nbut coolly he continued his task.\r\n\r\n\"Get back to cover!\" shouted Mr. McKay.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a stone caught the lad in the side, and staggering a few\r\npaces he fell.\r\n\r\nA yell of triumph greeted the success of the savages; but without a\r\nmoment's hesitation Ellerton rushed through the danger zone.  Unscathed\r\nhe gained his friend's side, and to his relief found that the missile\r\nhad merely winded him.\r\n\r\nFortunately Terence had the presence of mind to stagger to the remote\r\nside of the searchlight hut, where the two lads were protected from the\r\nhailstorm of stones.\r\n\r\n\"Are you fit for a dash?\" asked Ellerton after a while.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Terence, \"I'm ready now.\"\r\n\r\nSeizing their rifles, the two friends rushed at top speed across the\r\nopen ground and gained the shelter of the palisade guarding the\r\ncliff-path.  Here they were, so to speak, on the wrong side of the\r\nfence, and had there been any savages on the shore their position would\r\nhave been critical in the extreme.\r\n\r\nAs it was, they were able to keep up a constant fire upon the natives\r\non the cliff; but their foes seemed totally indifferent to the rifles,\r\nthough man after man was observed to fall.\r\n\r\nThe savages had not been idle.  Realising that the buildings and the\r\nbarricade at the end of the defile were proof against stones and\r\nspears, they rolled an enormous stone to the edge of the cliff with the\r\nintention of dropping it upon the roofed-in stockade.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" shouted Ellerton.  \"There's a rock about to fall on your\r\nheads!\"\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the warning shout, Mr. McKay, Quexo, and Andy\r\ncrossed the covered way to the opposite side of the defile.  Not a\r\nmoment too soon.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a couple of successful shots by Ellerton, who managed to\r\nbowl over one of the most active of the savages who were engaged in\r\nrolling the ponderous rock, the mass of stone rushed down the slope and\r\nshot clear of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe next instant it crashed through the frail roof of the barricade,\r\nand, in addition, smashed a huge gap in the wall of packing-cases and\r\nchests.\r\n\r\n\"A near shave,\" ejaculated Mr. McKay.  \"If they keep that game up we\r\nshall soon be without a roof to our heads.\"\r\n\r\nEmboldened by their success, a considerable number of the savages\r\nworked their way round to the head of the gorge with the intention of\r\ncharging the shattered defences, the remaining natives still keeping up\r\na telling discharge from the brink of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"I must rush it,\" said Ellerton hurriedly, as he grasped the state of\r\naffairs.  \"Keep a good look-out along the shore, Terence.  If I fall,\r\ndon't attempt a rescue; there are not enough of us to throw ourselves\r\naway like that.\"\r\n\r\nBending low, the lad ran across the danger zone once more, and although\r\nseveral spears fell close to him, he gained the side of his companions\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nSeen by day, the advance of the savages had an even more fearful\r\nappearance than the night attack.  Brandishing their weapons and\r\nuttering awful yells, they rushed down the gorge, with one object in\r\nview.  They meant to come to hand-grips with the stubborn defenders of\r\nthe barricade.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Andy,\" remarked Mr. McKay quietly, \"reserve your fire till the\r\nthickest of the press passes yonder rock, then aim carefully at that\r\ncanister.  Go on firing, you,\" he added to the other two lads.\r\n\r\nThe execution caused by the three rifles amongst that solid pack of\r\nhowling savages was great.  No body of white men would have faced it,\r\nbut undaunted the warriors swept on.\r\n\r\nAndy, finger on trigger, watched the advance till the critical moment;\r\nbut his arm was not so firm as it ought to have been, and the bullet\r\nstruck the rock a foot to the left of the tin of explosives.\r\n\r\n\"Miss, by Jove!\" he exclaimed savagely as he jerked open the breach and\r\nejected the empty cylinder.\r\n\r\nEre he could again take aim, Mr. McKay's rifle spoke.  There was a\r\nblinding glare, followed by a deafening report, and the close ranks of\r\nthe savages seemed to be swept aside as if by a gigantic flail.  Not\r\nonly did the dynamite charge scatter death amongst the natives, but the\r\nconcussion brought down huge masses of rock from the cliffs, their fall\r\nadding to the terror and confusion of the attackers.\r\n\r\n\"That's fifty of them at the very least,\" exclaimed Andy.  \"A few more\r\ncoups like that, and we'll wipe them all out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will teach them caution, I'm afraid,\" was his father's reply.  \"But\r\nwe've done very well up to the present.  How's Terence?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was only slightly hurt,\" replied Ellerton.\r\n\r\n\"No sign of any canoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven for that,\" replied Mr. McKay fervently.\r\n\r\n\"The explosion also sent off the other canisters,\" observed Andy.\r\n\"Shall we place some others in the gorge when it is dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they will attempt that way again,\" replied Mr. McKay.\r\n\"They've had a rare fright, both by day and night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I noticed a crowd of them on the cliffs immediately above the cave\r\nwhere the rest of the dynamite is stored,\" paid Ellerton.  \"If we can\r\nuse the stuff to no better purpose, why not set a time-fuse, and give\r\nthem another surprise?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be done, but there's a great risk to be run by whoever lights\r\nthe fuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing to do it,\" said Ellerton resolutely.  \"I can creep along\r\nthe base of the cliff so as to be out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do it, my boy.  Now's the time to act, before they have got over\r\ntheir last reverse.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's delay, Ellerton dashed across the spear-encumbered\r\nground and gained the shelter of the overhanging cliffs.  Then waving\r\nhis hands to his companions, he disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the fighting.  The defenders, anxiously awaiting\r\ntheir comrade's return, lay idle within their defences, while the\r\nnatives were content to hurl an occasional spear or stone upon the\r\nroofs of the buildings to show that they were still determined to\r\ncontinue the attack.\r\n\r\n\"I hope Ellerton's all right,\" exclaimed Andy uneasily.  \"He's been\r\ngone quite long enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help thinking the same,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\nThey waited another five minutes, then Quexo announced his intention of\r\ngoing to search for Massa El'ton.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, then, Quexo,\" said Andy.  \"Remember Mr. Ellerton may have\r\nlit the fuse--set fire to great bang-up,\" he added, noting that the\r\nmulatto looked puzzled over the word \"fuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Massa Andy.  Quexo he mind take care ob self an' Massa\r\nEl'ton.\"\r\n\r\nAnother five minutes passed in breathless suspense.  What had happened?\r\nEllerton had only to cover a distance of about four hundred yards both\r\nways.  Allowing for the rugged nature of the ground, and the necessity\r\nfor caution, he ought to have returned several minutes ago.  Perhaps he\r\nhad stumbled and was lying helpless within a few feet of the heavily\r\ncharged mine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly two revolver shots rang out in quick succession, and Quexo's\r\nvoice was heard shouting for aid.\r\n\r\n\"Stay here, Andy,\" exclaimed his father hurriedly, and grasping his\r\nrevolver he ran towards the scene of action, the report of another shot\r\ngreeting his ears as he went.\r\n\r\nOn rounding a spur of the cliff, a strange sight met his gaze.  From\r\nthe summit of the cliff dangled a long rope of cocoa-fibre.  Half-way\r\nfrom the ground was a native, evidently badly wounded, grasping the\r\nswaying rope with one hand while the other was pressed against his\r\nside.  On the ground at about twelve feet from the end of the rope lay\r\nfour bodies in a heap, and on arriving at the spot Mr. McKay discovered\r\nto his consternation that two of the motionless forms were those of his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nQuexo lay uppermost, a jagged spear-head buried deep in his back.  One\r\nhurried glance revealed the sad truth that the faithful mulatto was\r\ndead.  Under him were the bodies of two natives, both shot through the\r\nchest, while underneath the ghastly pile was Ellerton.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. McKay stooped over the lad, a spear whizzed close to his ear and\r\nsank deeply in the ground.  It was a stern warning, and Mr. McKay took\r\nadvantage of it.  Lifting Ellerton's body, he bore it to the shelter of\r\nthe cliffs, then as the rope began to tremble violently he stepped out\r\na pace, revolver in hand.\r\n\r\nHe fired, and two bodies came hurtling through space, striking the\r\nground with a heavy thud.  A lucky shot had severed the rope as cleanly\r\nas if by a knife.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost.  At any moment the mine might be sprung.\r\nHoisting Ellerton's body on his shoulder like a sack of flour, Mr.\r\nMcKay began his retreat, stepping over the rough ground with giant\r\nstrides, till the shelter of the cliffs came to an end.  Here he\r\ntransferred his burden to his arms, and, protecting it as well as he\r\nwas able with his own body, he dashed across the open.\r\n\r\nUnscathed he reached the roofed-in stockade, and breathlessly he\r\ndeposited the body of his comrade upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" asked Andy anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, only stunned.  It's a bad business.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Quexo?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's gone, poor fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" Andy gasped, as if something had struck him; but the blow was a\r\nmental not a physical injury.  \"How----\"\r\n\r\nHis words were interrupted by a roar that seemed to shake the island to\r\nits very foundations.  The cliffs trembled, dislodging masses of loose\r\nrock, while a blast of air swept over the terrace like a tornado.\r\n\r\nThe mine had exploded!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST STAND\r\n\r\nThe explosion, though terrific, had not the desired effect.  Ellerton\r\nhad succeeded in lighting the fuse, and was on his way back, when the\r\nnatives lowered a rope from the cliffs.  No doubt they had observed him\r\non his way to the cave as he rather thoughtlessly showed himself in\r\ncrossing the base of the projecting spur.\r\n\r\nCunningly two of the savages lowered themselves on to a ledge within\r\ntwenty feet of the ground, and on Ellerton's return they hurled a stone\r\nwith unerring aim, bringing him senseless to the ground.\r\n\r\nEager to secure his body, the two assailants descended the remaining\r\ndistance, and were stooping over the prostrate youth when Quexo\r\nappeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nA couple of well-directed shots settled their accounts; but the\r\nmulatto, in rushing to Ellerton's assistance, failed to notice that the\r\nedge of the cliff above him swarmed with natives.\r\n\r\nEven as he bent over the bodies of Ellerton and his assailants, a spear\r\nthrown with terrible force struck him in the back.  Hardly knowing what\r\nhurt him, the mulatto sprang to his feet, and with his dying strength\r\ndischarged his revolver at one of the blacks who was descending the\r\nrope, ere he fell across the bodies of the victims of his first two\r\nshots.\r\n\r\nThis episode had caused the crowd of savages, who had previously been\r\ncongregating immediately above the mine, to rush to that part of the\r\ncliff nearest to the scene of the tragedy, and thus the actual\r\nexplosion did not inflict very great damage upon the invaders.\r\nNevertheless the moral result was a good service to the sore-pressed\r\nwhite men, for the savages refrained from renewing the attack, and\r\nwithdrew to the shelter of the palm-groves.\r\n\r\nThe approach of night also prolonged the mutual cessation of\r\nhostilities, for the natives dreaded the great flashing beams of light\r\nmore than anything else.\r\n\r\nTerence, in spite of himself, fell asleep several times beside the\r\nsearchlight, while Andy, weary-eyed and stricken with grief, was kept\r\nawake solely by his devotion to his wounded comrade.\r\n\r\nFortunately Ellerton's injuries were not so bad as Mr. McKay had at\r\nfirst supposed.  The missile had struck him a glancing blow, and\r\nalthough reducing him to insensibility, was more of the nature of a cut\r\nthan a contusion.  There had been a copious flow of blood which\r\nrelieved the pressure on the scalp that a bruise would have otherwise\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight Ellerton had recovered sufficiently to relate the\r\ncircumstances of the affair so far as he knew, although he was ignorant\r\nof the actual ambush.  Neither did Mr. McKay think fit to tell him at\r\npresent of Quexo's death in his heroic and successful attempt to save\r\nhis master from mutilation.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWith the return of daylight the savages renewed the attack.  Large\r\nstones, brought to the brink of the cliff by their stupendous efforts,\r\ncame crashing down upon the frail defences, till only a small section\r\nof the barricade midway between the walls of the defile remained intact.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. McKay and Terence kept up a continuous but apparently\r\nineffectual fire, while Ellerton, still weak and showing signs of\r\nlight-headedness, did his best with a revolver.\r\n\r\nAndy, nearly done up for want of rest, resumed his solitary vigil at\r\nthe cliff path, occasionally adding to the fusillade whenever a group\r\nof natives appeared at the edge of the cliff to hurl another of the\r\nweighty missiles.\r\n\r\nWith parched lips and swollen eyes the weary little band continued the\r\nunequal combat, almost unable to raise their rifles to their aching\r\nshoulders, till, to add to their misfortunes, Andy perceived ten large\r\ncanoes rounding the south-eastern promontory of the island.\r\n\r\nThe natives had at length grasped the importance of a simultaneous rear\r\nand frontal attack.\r\n\r\n\"We must retreat to Blight's cave,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, when his son\r\nhad shouted the disheartening intelligence.  \"Let us hope the explosion\r\nhas not closed up the entrance.  Pull yourself together, Hoppy!  We've\r\ngot to make a rush for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stay here--I'm quite comfortable where I am,\" replied\r\nEllerton with astonishing determination.\r\n\r\n\"But you can't, man; you'll be cut to pieces in less than a minute.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ellerton refused to move.  His comrades looked at each other\r\nanxiously.  In ordinary circumstances it would have been no easy task\r\nto compel the lad to get up and walk, and with a few hundred savages\r\nhanging round, the difficulties were increased tenfold.\r\n\r\n\"I'll risk it,\" muttered Mr. McKay.  \"It's either kill or cure.\"  And\r\nraising his voice he said: \"Hoppy, old man, Quexo is missing.  He went\r\nto look for you and has not returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed Ellerton wildly.  \"Quexo missing?  I'll go and look\r\nfor him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all going,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"Take your rifle and keep with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe savages saw the white men deserting the shelter of the barricade,\r\nand with shouts of triumph they redoubled the hail of missiles, while\r\nnumbers of them rushed to the head of the defile and thence straight\r\nfor the abandoned defences.\r\n\r\nEdging cautiously along the base of the cliff, the forlorn little band\r\ncontinued its retreat till Ellerton, who was leading, came across the\r\nbody of the faithful mulatto.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he gazed at the ghastly scene with drawn face and staring\r\neyes; then, his scattered wits returning, he burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. McKay to his son.  \"That's saved his reason.  But\r\nhere they come.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the leading pursuers were appearing on the edge of the\r\ncliff-path, while others, rushing down the gorge, had scrambled over\r\nthe debris of the barricade, and with brandished clubs and spears were\r\ncharging down upon their white foes.\r\n\r\n\"Pick him up, Hoppy; we must not leave him to those fiends,\" shouted\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Terence, Ellerton raised the body of the mulatto on his\r\nback, and, covered by Mr. McKay and Andy, continued the retreat.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the scene of the great explosion, they found that\r\nmasses of dislodged boulders extended almost to the edge of the lower\r\ncliff.  Slowly Ellerton and Terence bore their burden over the rough,\r\nrock-strewn ground, the savages meanwhile gaining upon them rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Keep going at any cost,\" shouted Mr. McKay.  \"Gain the door of the\r\nfence, and look out for us.  Andy, we must make a stand here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, pater,\" replied his son as he took cover behind a\r\nconvenient mass of stones.\r\n\r\nThe two rifles opened a furious fire upon the advancing natives.  Not a\r\nshot was thrown away, and although stones and spears whizzed over their\r\nheads or shattered themselves against the sheltering rock, father and\r\nson continued to blaze away coolly, and deliberately.  The savages, now\r\nmore or less contemptuously familiar with the white men's weapons,\r\nhesitated to close in upon the dauntless twain, and, shouting to their\r\nfellows to hasten to help them to wipe out the white men, they\r\ncontented themselves with rushing to the right and left in the hope of\r\nsurrounding their foes.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that chap!\" yelled Andy, pointing to a crafty warrior, who was\r\ncreeping on all fours up the rocks on Mr. McKay's left.\r\n\r\nBarely two inches of the man's head were visible above the sheltering\r\nboulder, but those two inches were sufficient.  Mr. McKay's rifle\r\ncracked, and the savage bounded a good three feet in the air to fall\r\nupon his face upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"They're safe!\" shouted Mr. McKay, giving a rapid glance in the\r\ndirection of the iron fence.  \"Now, bolt for it!\"\r\n\r\nSpringing over the remainder of the intervening boulders, father and\r\nson ran for shelter.  For a brief instant the natives failed to\r\nunderstand that their foes were again in retreat; then, to the\r\naccompaniment of a flight of spears, they launched themselves over the\r\nlatest line of defence and pressed home the pursuit.\r\n\r\nRifle in hand, Terence and Ellerton stood by the open door to aid their\r\ncomrades' retreat; another five yards, then comparative safely.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Andy stumbled and fell headlong on the ground, his rifle\r\nflying from his grasp; the next instant half-a-dozen natives were upon\r\nhim.  Without a moment's hesitation, Mr. McKay faced about, and,\r\ndrawing his revolver, fired.\r\n\r\nAt the first report one of the pursuers fell; but the hammer of the\r\nweapon clicked harmlessly as Mr. McKay attempted to bring down a\r\nsecond.  The weapon was empty.\r\n\r\nThrowing the now useless weapon straight into the face of one of the\r\nsavages, Mr. McKay stooped to pick up his rifle, a spear just grazing\r\nhis shoulder as he did so.\r\n\r\nWith the strength and fury of a Berserker, he gripped the rifle by the\r\nbarrel, and wielding it like a ponderous flail he smote right and left.\r\n\r\nAt one moment the brass-bound butt crashed with a terrific lunge full\r\nin the tattooed face of a native; at the next it descended with\r\nrelentless force upon the skull of another.\r\n\r\nThen Ellerton's rifle cracked and Terence's revolver added to the din.\r\nThe blacks seemed to melt away; and ere the main body of the pursuers\r\ncould join in the struggle, the white men were safe within the stockade.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble about the door,\" shouted Mr. McKay, as Terence was about\r\nto close and barricade the iron-lined aperture.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly the harried fugitives entered the cave, and, holding their\r\nrifles ready for instant use, awaited the arrival of their triumphant\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nThe door of the fence standing tantalisingly open served a better\r\npurpose than if it had been closed and barred.  Had it been secured,\r\nthe savages would soon have battered it in by sheer weight of numbers;\r\nbut even in the heat of the pursuit the natives paused and looked\r\naskance at the mute invitation to enter.\r\n\r\nFears of some other snare, more terrible than those they had already\r\nexperienced, held them in a spell-bound grip.\r\n\r\nThe temporary check gave the defenders a chance of much-needed rest.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" exclaimed Mr. McKay, \"we are safe enough for the present.\r\nA thousand of the wretches couldn't rush us in this place.  But keep\r\nyour eyes open, and let rip at the first chap who shows his head inside\r\nthe door.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of irony in Mr. McKay's advice.  Want of sleep\r\nthreatened to become a more dangerous foe than the savages themselves,\r\nand the lads were almost falling asleep as they awaited the next\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nAll at once Mr. McKay raised his rifle and fired.\r\n\r\nA gaudily-decked warrior had so far overcome his fears and doubts as to\r\npeer cautiously into the inclosure.  His curiosity led to his undoing,\r\nfor, without knowing what struck him, he slid quietly to the ground\r\nwith a bullet through his brain.\r\n\r\nBut the spell was broken, and with a hideous clamour the natives poured\r\nin through the doorway.  Many fell dead or wounded, while others\r\ntripped over their prostrate bodies; but by sheer weight of numbers the\r\nfence was overthrown, and over the removed obstruction rushed the\r\nbloodthirsty mob.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it was impossible to check the flowing tide of warriors as\r\nthey sped over the broad expanse, the defenders hurriedly retired into\r\nthe farthermost recesses of the cave.  Here they were able to command\r\nthe narrow entrance, and with a rapid magazine fire they simply mowed\r\ndown every savage who showed himself at the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nAt last, disheartened by the obvious impossibility of rushing the\r\ndesperate band of white men, the warriors retired, and silence reigned\r\nsave for the moans of the wounded who littered the floor of the cavern.\r\n\r\nWorn out as they were, the four defenders, as soon as possible, scooped\r\nout a shallow trench for the reception of the body of Quexo, who had\r\nbeen killed, and silently the earth was heaped over the still form of\r\nthis their faithful servant and devoted comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Now turn in for a spell,\" said Mr. McKay, as the last offices were\r\nperformed.  \"I'll take the first watch.  I think I can keep awake for\r\nanother couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\nVainly protesting, the lads obeyed and were soon asleep.\r\n\r\nShouldering his rifle, Mr. McKay walked as far as the overthrown fence,\r\nwhence he could command a view of the house.  Swarming in and out of\r\nthe building were the natives bearing away everything of value, while\r\nothers were demolishing the searchlight, which they evidently regarded\r\nas an evil spirit, whose powers were harmless by day.  The work of\r\nplunder continued till nothing was left of the dwelling but the bare\r\nwalls and roof, and presently the building burst into flames.\r\n\r\nHoping against hope, Mr. McKay watched with impotent rage the wanton\r\ndestruction of the result of so many months of patient toil and energy.\r\n\r\nWould the natives be content with their success, and re-embark with\r\ntheir booty?  Already several of them, laden with spoil, were\r\ndescending the cliff-path to their canoes; were the white men to be\r\nleft unmolested?\r\n\r\nWithout thinking of the sore straits to which they would be reduced by\r\nthe loss of their home with most of their stores, Mr. McKay waited and\r\nwatched.  The possibility of a fresh lease of life, even under such\r\nadverse conditions, was infinitely preferable to having to fight\r\ndesperately to the last.\r\n\r\nBut his hopes were doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nA strong body of savages began to ascend the slope leading to the cave,\r\nand, to his consternation, the watcher perceived that many of them were\r\nbearing bundles of sticks and grass.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a struggle not only against the spears and clubs of the\r\nnatives, but against fire and smoke, and Mr. McKay realised that the\r\nchoice of the defenders lay between a fight to the death in the open or\r\nbeing stifled in the recesses of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE\r\n\r\nReturning to the cave, Mr. McKay awoke the lads and hurriedly explained\r\nthe nature of the threatened attack.\r\n\r\n\"We must quit this shelter and keep in the open as long as we possibly\r\ncan,\" said he.  \"A long-range fire may keep them at bay.  Only as a\r\nlast resource must we return to the cave.\"\r\n\r\nBarely had the defenders left the cavern than they were assailed from\r\nabove by a shower of stones and spears.  Several of the savages had\r\ntaken up a position on the summit of the cliff overhanging the mouth of\r\nthe white men's retreat, so as to make the advance of the main body\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nThrown into confusion by this unlooked-for attack, the four defenders\r\nfled headlong for the cave they had just left, narrowly escaping the\r\nfalling missiles.  Then, finding that the jutting rocks protected them\r\nso long as they kept close to the base of the cliff, the wearied men\r\nplucked up courage, and opened fire upon the dense masses of the\r\nnatives as they advanced rapidly with their burdens.\r\n\r\nMany of the savages fell, but others immediately took up their loads,\r\nand working from cover to cover with admirable cunning the natives came\r\nwithin throwing distance of their spears.\r\n\r\nThe rifle-fire, hot as it was, was unable to stop the fan-like\r\nformation of the crafty warriors, and, assailed by stones and spears,\r\nthe defenders were once more compelled to retire to the cave.\r\n\r\nRepeated repulses had taught the natives caution, and without risking\r\nthemselves by appearing in front of the death-dealing tunnel, they\r\nthrust their bundles of wood and grass into the mouth of the cave by\r\nmeans of long poles.  Then a torch was flung upon the heap of\r\ninflammable material, and the next instant it burst into flames.\r\n\r\n\"Throw some water on it,\" grasped Terence, as the heat began to take\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\"Useless,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"It would only cause more smoke,\" and\r\nlifting a case of ammunition he rushed towards the blazing pile.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down!\" he ordered sharply, as he regained his comrades.\r\n\r\nCrouched in the remotest part of the cave, they awaited the explosion.\r\nThen with a roar, followed by a series of minor reports, the cartridges\r\nexploded, filling the cave with pungent fumes.\r\n\r\nAs the last detonation ended, Mr. McKay leapt to his feet, and,\r\nrevolver in hand, dashed through the scattered and still burning\r\nembers.  His companions followed his example, and gained the open.\r\nEven as they drank in the deliciously cool air they were compelled to\r\nresume the unequal combat, though the savages, alarmed by the explosion\r\nand the sudden appearance of their foes, gave back in terror.\r\n\r\nEdging along the base of the cliff, for the darts and stones still\r\ndescended, regardless of friend or foe, the defenders blazed away at\r\ntheir enemies, till the latter recovered from their fright and returned\r\nto the attack.\r\n\r\nNot till they were in grave danger of being cut off did Mr. McKay and\r\nhis companions return to the cave once more to endure the torments of\r\nthe smoke-laden atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis time the savages did not leave them in peace.  With poised weapons\r\nthe wily warriors waited on either side of the entrance, while others\r\ndescended from the terrace and procured fresh fuel.\r\n\r\nSplashing their faces with water, and fanning the noxious fumes with\r\nportions of their clothes, the defenders strove to cool their parched\r\nand heated bodies, realising that another half-hour would doubtless see\r\nthe end of the unequal struggle.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to be smoked out like a rat in a hole,\" exclaimed\r\nEllerton.  \"I'll make a dash for it and die in the open.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the only way,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"If we are to die we must die\r\nlike Britons, fighting to the last.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the forlorn party made this desperate decision, when a sharp\r\near-splitting explosion, followed almost immediately by another, was\r\nheard without the cave.  Yells of terror and noisy surprise arose, and\r\nthe savages fled right and left.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the defenders were unable to grasp the meaning of the\r\ninterruption, till Andy shouted: \"Hurrah!  A rescue!\" and overcome by\r\nmental and bodily strain, he fell on the floor in a swoon.\r\n\r\nTerence and Ellerton were about to rush to the mouth of the cave, but\r\nMr. McKay restrained them.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down!\" he exclaimed.  \"They're firing with shell, and we shall be\r\nblown to atoms if we go outside.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, to a certain extent, unfortunate that the inhabitants of\r\nMcKay's Island were unable to observe the means by which they were so\r\nopportunely rescued from what appeared to be a terrible and remorseless\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nWhile the preparations for the smoking-out of the still-resisting white\r\nmen were in progress, H.M.S. _Blazer_ was steaming straight for the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nUnnoticed by the natives, she gained the entrance to the lagoon, the\r\nleadsmen in the chains, and the decks cleared for action.\r\n\r\nThe alert commander had already observed the smouldering ruins of what\r\nwas obviously at no remote time a civilised settlement, and the shouts\r\nof the desperate savages told him that resistance was still being made.\r\n\r\nH.M.S. _Blazer_ was but a third-class cruiser, mainly engaged in\r\nsurveying duties in the Pacific.  Her armament consisted of two\r\n4.7-inch guns, one mounted fore and aft, six twelve-pounders, and ten\r\nMaxims, and these were amply sufficient for the work in hand.\r\n\r\nRounding to in seven fathoms, and less than three hundred yards from\r\nthe scene of the desperate encounter, the _Blazer_ opened fire.  Her\r\ncommander had noted the actual locality of the defenders' retreat, and\r\ncarefully avoiding the spot for fear of harming friend as well as foe,\r\nhe had a couple of shells planted in the fringe of the attacking\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThose two shells were sufficient.  Madly the survivors fled along the\r\nterrace in the direction of the defile leading to the ulterior, and as\r\nthey ran they were subjected to a raking fire by the quick-firers and\r\nMaxims, till only a small remnant gained the shelter of the palm-groves.\r\n\r\n\"Man and arm boats!\" came the order.\r\n\r\nBut ere the landing-party gained the shore, not a living savage was to\r\nbe seen.  Panic-stricken they fled to the far side of the island, where\r\nthey embarked in their canoes.\r\n\r\n\"We're too late, it seems,\" remarked the lieutenant in charge, as he\r\ngazed upon the devastated scene.\r\n\r\n\"Those brutes were running from up yonder, sir,\" observed a\r\npetty-officer, pointing towards the upper terrace.  \"Maybe there's\r\nsomeone up there among the rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Party, fall in!\" ordered the officer, and giving the word to march, he\r\nled the way over the open ground, which was littered by the victims of\r\nthe _Blazer's_ fire.\r\n\r\n\"Strike me; wot's this?\" ejaculated the petty-officer, as four battered\r\nspecimens of humanity appeared above the crest of a rise of ground and\r\nfloundered painfully towards their rescuers, who gave them a hearty\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\n\"We were certainly in the nick of time,\" remarked Commander Bulwark,\r\nas, five hours later, Mr. McKay and the three lads were seated in the\r\n_Blazer's_ wardroom.  \"We received a telegraphic message from Tahiti\r\nwhile we were lying off Suva, to the effect that a French trader\r\nreported that she had communicated with British castaways; but was\r\nunable, owing to the high seas that were running, to render assistance.\r\nSo we came at full speed, and, I am glad to say, with fortunate\r\nresults.  We are leaving here to-morrow for Sydney.  I suppose you\r\ndon't object to being landed there?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied Mr. McKay.  \"I think we've had enough of the\r\nisland to last us a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words Mr. McKay told the commander of the finding of the\r\ntreasure, and how it was hidden under the floor of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Treasure, eh?  Well, you're lucky in more than one way.  There are\r\nplenty of islands in the Pacific where treasure is supposed to be\r\nhidden.  We usually regard these stories as a myth, but you've\r\nevidently proved that such things do exist.  Let me congratulate you\r\nonce again.  I'll send ashore at once.\"\r\n\r\nBefore nightfall the treasure chests were conveyed safely on board the\r\ncruiser.\r\n\r\nThe bluejackets also placed a pile of stones over the grave of the\r\nbrave mulatto, a simple inscription setting forth his name and the\r\nmanner of his death; while for the benefit of possible future\r\ncastaways, a paper giving particulars of the stores deposited in the\r\ntreasure cave was placed in an air-tight case and lashed to a post in a\r\nconspicuous position on the shore.\r\n\r\nShortly after daybreak on the following day Mr. McKay and the three\r\nlads watched from the poop of the _Blazer_ the rapidly receding land\r\nwhich for so many months had been their home; and in silence they stood\r\ngazing with wistful eyes till the summit of the peak of McKay's Island\r\nsank beneath the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mayflower Press, Plymouth, England_.
