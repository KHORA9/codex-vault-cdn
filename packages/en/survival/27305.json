submit in the following pages a proposition and a proposal--a\r\ndistinction which an old-country writer of English may, perhaps, be\r\npermitted to preserve. The proposition is that, in the United States, as\r\nin other English-speaking communities, the city has been developed to\r\nthe neglect of the country. I shall not have to labour the argument, as\r\nnobody seriously disputes the contention; but I shall trace the main\r\ncauses of the neglect, and indicate what, in my view, must be its\r\ninevitable consequences. If I make my case, it will appear that our\r\ncivilisation has thus become dangerously one-sided, and that, in the\r\ninterests of national well-being, it is high time for steps to be taken\r\nto counteract the townward tendency.\r\n\r\nMy definite proposal to those who accept these conclusions is that a\r\nCountry Life movement, upon lines which will be laid down, should be\r\ninitiated by existing associations, whose efforts should be supplemented\r\nby a new organisation which I shall call a Country Life Institute. There\r\nare in the United States a multiplicity of agencies, both public and\r\nvoluntary, available for this work. But the army of workers in this\r\nfield of social service needs two things: first, some definite plan for\r\ncoördinating their several activities, and, next, some recognised source\r\nof information collected from the experience of the Old and the New\r\nWorld. It is the purpose of these pages to show that these needs are\r\nreal and can be met.\r\n\r\nTwo obvious questions will here suggest themselves. Why should the\r\nUnited States--of all countries in the world--be chosen for such a theme\r\ninstead of a country like Ireland, where the population depends mainly\r\nupon agriculture? What qualifications has an Irishman, be he never so\r\ncompetent to advise upon the social and economic problems of his own\r\ncountry, to talk to Americans about the life of their rural population?\r\nI admit at once that, while I have made some study of American\r\nagriculture and rural economy, my actual work upon the problem of which\r\nI write has been restricted to Ireland. But I claim, with some pride,\r\nthat, in thought upon rural economy, Ireland is ahead of any\r\nEnglish-speaking country. She has troubles of her own, some inherent in\r\nthe adverse physical conditions, and others due to well-known historical\r\ncauses, that too often impede the action to which her best thoughts\r\nshould lead. But the very fact that those who grapple with Irish\r\nproblems have to work through failure to success will certainly not\r\nlessen the value to the social student of the experience gained. I\r\nrecognise, however, that I must give the reader so much of personal\r\nnarrative as is required to enable him to estimate the value of my\r\nfacts, and of the conclusions which I base upon them.\r\n\r\nTo have enjoyed an Irish-American existence, to have been profoundly\r\ninterested in, and more or less in touch with, public affairs in both\r\ncountries, to have been an unwilling politician in Ireland and not a\r\npolitician at all in America, is, to say the least, an unusual\r\nexperience for an Irishman. But such has been my record during the last\r\ntwenty years. Soon after graduating at Oxford, I was advised to live in\r\nmountain air for a while, and for the next decade I was a ranchman along\r\nthe foothills of the Rockies. To those who knew that my heart was in\r\nIreland, I used to explain that I might some day be in politics at home,\r\nand must take care of my lungs. In 1889 I returned to live and work in\r\nmy own country, but I retained business interests, including some\r\nfarming operations, in the Western States. Ever since then I have taken\r\nmy annual holiday across the Atlantic, and have studied rural\r\nconditions over a wider area in the United States than my business\r\ninterests demanded.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, commencing in 1892, I was a Member of Parliament. My\r\nlegislative ambition was to get something done for Irish industry, and\r\nespecially Irish agriculture. Having secured the assistance of an\r\nunprecedented combination of representative Irishmen, known as the\r\nRecess Committee (because it sat during the Parliamentary recess), we\r\nsucceeded in getting the addition we wanted to the machinery of Irish\r\nGovernment. The functions of the new institution are sufficiently\r\nindicated by its cumbrous Parliamentary title, \"The Department of\r\nAgriculture and other Industries and for Technical Instruction for\r\nIreland.\" I mention this official experience because it not only\r\nintensified my desire to study American conditions, but it also brought\r\nme frequently to Washington to study the working of those Federal\r\ninstitutions which are concerned for the welfare of the rural\r\npopulation. There I enjoyed the unfailing courtesy of American public\r\nservants to the foreign inquirer.\r\n\r\nOn one of these visits, in the winter of 1905-1906, I called upon\r\nPresident Roosevelt to pay him my respects, and to express to him my\r\nobligations to some members of his Administration. I wished especially\r\nto acknowledge my indebtedness to that veteran statesman, Secretary\r\nWilson, the value of whose long service to the American farmer it would\r\nbe hard to exaggerate. Mr. Roosevelt questioned me as to the exact\r\nobject of my inquiries, and asked me to come again and discuss with him\r\nmore fully than was possible at the moment certain economic and social\r\nquestions which had engaged much of his own thoughts. He was greatly\r\ninterested to learn that in Ireland we have been approaching many of\r\nthese questions from his own point of view. He made me tell him the\r\nstory of Irish land legislation, and of recent Irish movements for the\r\nimprovement of agricultural conditions. Ever since, his interest in\r\nthese Irish questions--to _the_ Irish Question we gave a wide berth--has\r\nbeen maintained on account of their bearing upon his Rural Life policy,\r\nfor I had shown him how the economic strengthening and social elevation\r\nof the Irish farmer had become a matter of urgent Irish concern. I\r\nrecall many things he said on that occasion, which show that his two\r\ngreat policies of Conservation and Country Life reform were maturing in\r\nhis mind. I need hardly say how deeply interesting these policies are to\r\nme, embracing as they do economic and social problems, the working out\r\nof which in my own country happens to be the task to which I have\r\ndevoted the best years of my life.\r\n\r\nI must now offer to the reader so much of the story of the Country Life\r\nmovement in my own country as will enable him to understand its\r\ninterest to Mr. Roosevelt and to many another worker upon the analogous\r\nproblems of the United States. Ireland is passing through an agrarian\r\nrevolution. There, as in many other European countries, the title to\r\nmost of the agricultural land rested upon conquest. The English attempt\r\nto colonise Ireland never completely succeeded nor completely failed;\r\nconsequently the Irish never ceased to repudiate the title of the alien\r\nlandlord. In 1881 Mr. Gladstone introduced one of the greatest agrarian\r\nreforms in history--rent-fixing by judicial authority--which was\r\ncertainly a bold attempt to put an end to a desolating conflict,\r\ncenturies old.\r\n\r\nThe scheme failed,--whether, as some hold, from its inherent defects, or\r\nfrom the circumstances of the time, is an open question. It is but fair\r\nto its author to point out that a rapidly increasing foreign\r\ncompetition, chiefly from the newly opened tracts of virgin soil in the\r\nNew World, led to a fall in agricultural prices, which made the first\r\nrents fixed appear too high. Quicker and cheaper transit, together with\r\nprocesses for keeping produce fresh over the longest routes, soon showed\r\nthat the new market conditions had come to stay. A bad land system on a\r\nrising market might succeed better than a good one on a falling. The\r\nland tenure reforms begun in 1881, having broken down under stress of\r\nforeign competition, and Purchase Acts on a smaller scale having been\r\ntentatively tried in the interval, in 1903 Parliament finally decreed\r\nthat sufficient money should be provided to buy out all the remaining\r\nagricultural land. In a not remote future, some two hundred million\r\npounds sterling--a billion dollars--will have been advanced by the\r\nBritish Government to enable the tenants to purchase their holdings, the\r\nmoney to be repaid in easy instalments during periods averaging over\r\nsixty years.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago this general course of events was foreseen, and a few\r\nIrishmen conceived and set to work upon what has come to be Ireland's\r\nRural Life policy. The position taken up was simple. What Parliament was\r\nabout to do would pull down the whole structure of Ireland's\r\nagricultural economy, and would clear away the chief hindrance to\r\neconomic and social progress. But upon the ground thus cleared the\r\nedifice of a new rural social economy would have to be built. This work,\r\nalthough it needs the fostering care of government, and liberal\r\nfacilities for a system of education intimately related to the people's\r\nworking lives, belongs mainly to the sphere of voluntary effort.\r\n\r\nThe new movement, which was started in 1889 to meet the circumstances I\r\nhave indicated, was thus a movement for the up-building of country life.\r\nIt anticipated the lines of the formula which Mr. Roosevelt adopted in\r\nhis Message transmitting to Congress the Report of the Country Life\r\nCommission--better farming, better business, better living: we began\r\nwith better business, which consisted in the introduction of\r\nagricultural coöperation into the farming industry, for several reasons\r\nwhich will appear later, and for one which I must mention here. We found\r\nthat we could not develop in unorganised farmers a political influence\r\nstrong enough to enable them to get the Government to do its part\r\ntowards better farming. Owing to the new agricultural opinion which had\r\nbeen developed indirectly by organising the farmer, we were able to win\r\nfrom Parliament the department I have named above. This institution was\r\nso framed and endowed that it is able to give to the Irish farmers all\r\nthe assistance which can be legitimately given by public agencies and at\r\npublic expense. The assistance consists chiefly of education. But\r\neducation is interpreted in the widest sense. Practical instruction to\r\nold and young, in schools, upon the farms, and at meetings, lectures,\r\nexperiments, and demonstrations, the circulation of useful information\r\nand advice, and all the usual methods known to progressive governments,\r\nare being introduced with the chief aim of enabling the farmer to apply\r\nto the practice of farming the teachings of modern science. Better\r\nliving, which includes making country life more interesting and\r\nattractive, is sought by using voluntary associations, some organised\r\nprimarily for business purposes, and others, having no business aim, for\r\nsocial and intellectual ends. But Irish rural reformers are agreed that\r\nby far the most important step towards a higher and a better rural life\r\nwould be a redirection of education in the country schools. To this I\r\nshall return in the proper place.\r\n\r\nI can now proceed with my American experiences without leaving any doubt\r\nas to the point of view from which I approach the problem of rural life\r\nin the United States. Having engaged in actual work upon that problem in\r\nIreland, where a combination of economic changes and political events\r\nhas made its solution imperative, and having been long in personal\r\ntouch with rural conditions in some Western States, my interest in\r\ncertain policies which were maturing at Washington may be easily\r\nsurmised. There I found that, with wholly different conditions to be\r\ndealt with, the thoughts of the President and of others in his\r\nconfidence were, as regards the main issue, moving in the same direction\r\nas my own. They too had come to feel that the welfare of the rural\r\npopulation had been too long neglected, and that it was high time to\r\nconsider how the neglect might be repaired. In his annual message to\r\nCongress in 1904, Mr. Roosevelt had made it clear that he was fully\r\nconscious of this necessity. \"Nearly half of the people of this\r\ncountry,\" he wrote, \"devote their energies to growing things from the\r\nsoil. Until a recent date little has been done to prepare these millions\r\nfor their life work.\" I did not realise at the time the full import of\r\nthese sentences. Nor did I foresee that the problem of rural life was\r\nto be forced to the front by the awakening of public opinion, upon\r\nanother issue differing from and yet closely related to the subject of\r\nthese pages. Mr. Roosevelt was thinking out the Conservation idea, which\r\nI believe will some day be recognised as the greatest of his policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LAUNCHING OF TWO ROOSEVELT POLICIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough somebody has already said something like it, I would say there\r\nis a tide in the thoughts of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to\r\naction. We make the general claim for our Western civilisation, that,\r\nwhatever the form of government, once public opinion is thoroughly\r\nstirred upon a great and vital issue, it is but a question of time for\r\nthe will to find the way. But in the life of the United States, the\r\npassage from thought to action is more rapid than in any country that I\r\nknow. Nowhere do we find such a combination of emotionalism with sanity.\r\nNo better illustration of these national qualities could be desired than\r\nthat afforded by the inception and early growth of the Conservation\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nI have already shown how my inquiries at Washington gave me access to\r\nthe most accessible of the world's statesmen. At the same time there\r\ncame into my life another remarkable personality. To the United States\r\nForester of that day I owe my earliest interest in the Conservation\r\npolicy. In counsel with him I came to regard the Conservation and Rural\r\nLife policies as one organic whole. So I must say here a word about the\r\nman who, more than any other, has inspired whatever in these pages may\r\nbe worth printing.\r\n\r\nI first met Gifford Pinchot in his office in Washington in 1905. I was\r\nnot especially interested in forestry, but the Forester was so\r\ninteresting that I listened with increasing delight to the story of his\r\nwork. I noticed that as an administrator he had a grasp of detail and a\r\nmastery of method which are not usually found in men who have had no\r\ntraining in large business affairs. I thought the secret of his success\r\nlay between love of work and sympathy with workers, which gained him\r\nthe devotion and enthusiastic coöperation of his staff. It is, however,\r\nas a statesman rather than as an administrator that his achievement is\r\nand will be known.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew the Forester, I found that already the conservation of\r\ntimber was but a small part of his material aims: every national\r\nresource must be husbanded. But over the whole scheme of Conservation a\r\ngreat moral issue reigned supreme. He clung affectionately to his task,\r\nbut it was not to him mere forestry administration. In his far vision he\r\nseemed to see men as trees walking. The saving of one great asset was\r\nbroadening out into insistence upon a new test of national efficiency:\r\nthe people of the United States were to be judged by the manner in which\r\nthey applied their physical and mental energies to the conservation and\r\ndevelopment of their country's natural resources. The acceptance of this\r\ntest would mean the success of a great policy for the initiation of\r\nwhich President Roosevelt gave almost the whole credit to Gifford\r\nPinchot.\r\n\r\nThere is one other name which will be ever honorably associated with the\r\ndawn of the Conservation idea which Mr. Roosevelt elevated to the status\r\nand dignity of a national policy. In September, 1906, Mr. James J. Hill\r\ndelivered (under the title of \"The Future of the United States\") what I\r\nthink was an epoch-making address. It is significant that this great\r\nrailway president opened his campaign for the economic salvation of the\r\nUnited States by addressing himself, not to politicians or professors,\r\nbut to a representative body of Minnesota farmers. This address\r\npresented for the first time in popular form a remarkable collection of\r\neconomic facts, which formed the basis of conclusions as startling as\r\nthey were new. Let me attempt a brief summary of its contents.\r\n\r\nThe natural resources, to which the Conservation policy relates, may be\r\ndivided into two classes: the minerals, which when used cannot be\r\nreplaced, and things that grow from the soil, which admit of\r\nindefinitely augmented reproduction. At the head of the former category\r\nstands the supply of coal and iron. This factor in the nation's industry\r\nand commerce was being exhausted at a rate which made it certain that,\r\nlong before the end of the century, the most important manufactures\r\nwould be handicapped by a higher cost of production. The supply of\r\nmerchantable timber was disappearing even more rapidly. But far more\r\nserious than all other forms of wastage was the reckless destruction of\r\nthe natural fertility of the soil. The final result, according to Mr.\r\nHill, must be that within a comparatively brief period--a period for\r\nwhich the present generation was bound to take thought--this veritable\r\nLand of Promise would be hard pressed to feed its own people, while the\r\nmanufactured exports to pay for imported food would not be forthcoming.\r\nIt should be added that this sensational forecast was no purposeless\r\njeremiad. Mr. Hill told his hearers that the danger which threatened the\r\nfuture of the Nation would be averted only by the intelligence and\r\nindustry of those who cultivated the farm lands, and that they had it in\r\ntheir power to provide a perfectly practicable and adequate remedy. This\r\nwas to be found--if such a condensation be permissible--in the\r\napplication of the physical sciences to the practice, and of economic\r\nscience to the business, of farming.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the immense burden of great undertakings which he carried,\r\nMr. Hill repeated the substance of this address on many occasions. Lord\r\nRosebery once said that speeches were the most ephemeral of all\r\nephemeral things, and for some time it looked as if one of the most\r\nimportant speeches ever delivered by a public man on a great public\r\nissue was going to illustrate the truth of this saying. It seems\r\nstrange that his facts and arguments should have remained unchallenged,\r\nand yet unsupported, by other public men. Perhaps the best explanation\r\nis to be found in a recent dictum of Mr. James Bryce. Speaking at the\r\nUniversity of California, the British Ambassador said: \"We can all think\r\nof the present, and are only too apt to think chiefly about the present.\r\nThe average man, be he educated or uneducated, seldom thinks of anything\r\nelse.\" There are, however, special circumstances in the history of the\r\nUnited States which account for the extraordinary unconcern about what\r\nis going to happen to the race in a period which may seem long to those\r\nwhose personal interest fixes a limit to their gaze, but which is indeed\r\nshort in the life of a nation. After the religious, political, and\r\nmilitary struggles through which the American nation was brought to\r\nbirth, there followed a century of no less strenuous wrestling with the\r\nforces of nature. That century stands divided by the greatest civil\r\nconflict in the world's history; but this only served to strengthen in a\r\nunited people those indomitable qualities to which the nation owes its\r\nleadership in the advancement of civilisation. The abundance (until now\r\nconsidered as virtual inexhaustibility) of natural resources, the call\r\nfor capital and men for their development, the rich reward of conquest\r\nin the field of industry, may explain, but can hardly excuse, a National\r\nattitude which seems to go against the strongest human instinct--one not\r\naltogether wanting in lower animal life--that of the preservation of the\r\nrace. It is an attitude which recalls the question said to have been\r\nasked by an Irishman: \"What has posterity done for me?\" But this was\r\nbefore Conservation was in the air.\r\n\r\nI have now told what I came by chance to know about the origin of the\r\nConservation idea. The story of its early growth was no less remarkable\r\nthan the suddenness of its appearance. In the spring of 1908 matters\r\nhad advanced so far that the governors of all the States and Territories\r\nmet to discuss it. Before the Conference broke up they were moved to\r\n\"declare the conviction that the great prosperity of our country rests\r\nupon the abundant resources of the land chosen by our forefathers for\r\ntheir homes,\" that these resources are \"a heritage to be made use of in\r\nestablishing and promoting the comfort, prosperity, and happiness of the\r\nAmerican people, but not to be wasted, deteriorated, or needlessly\r\ndestroyed; that this material basis is threatened with exhaustion\"; that\r\n\"conservation of our natural resources is a subject of transcendent\r\nimportance which should engage unremittingly the attention of the\r\nNation, the States, and the people in earnest coöperation\"; and that\r\n\"this coöperation should find expression in suitable action by the\r\nCongress and by the legislatures of the several States.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not with Conservation, but with Rural Life, that we\r\nare here directly concerned; but it should be borne in mind that the\r\nchief of all the nation's resources is the fertility of the soil. More\r\nthan one competent authority declared at the Conference of Governors\r\nthat this national asset was the subject of the greatest actual waste,\r\nand was at the same time capable of the greatest development and\r\nconservation. This interdependence of the two Roosevelt policies--the\r\nfact that neither of them can come to fruition without the success of\r\nthe other--makes those of us who work for rural progress rest our chief\r\nhopes upon the newly aroused public opinion in the American Republic.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge this view is shared by President Roosevelt, who always\r\nregarded his Conservation and Rural Life policies as complementary to\r\neach other. The last time I saw him--it was on Christmas Eve, 1908--he\r\ndwelt on this aspect of his public work and aims. I remember how he\r\nexpressed the hope that, when the more striking incidents of his\r\nAdministration were forgotten, public opinion would look kindly upon his\r\nConservation and Rural Life policies. I ventured upon the confident\r\nprediction that he would not be disappointed in this anticipation.\r\nAlready the authors of the Conservation policy have been rewarded by a\r\ngeneral acceptance of the principle for which they stand. The national\r\nconscience now demands that the present generation, while enjoying the\r\nmaterial blessings with which not only nature but also the labour and\r\nsacrifices of their forefathers have so bounteously endowed them, shall\r\nhave due regard for the welfare of those who are to come after them.\r\n\r\nAmericans, who are accustomed to rapid developments in public opinion,\r\nwill hardly appreciate the impression made by the story I have just told\r\nupon the mind of an observer from old countries, where action does not\r\ntread upon the heels of thought. But surely an amazing thing has\r\nhappened. In the life of one Administration a great idea seizes the mind\r\nof the American people. This leads to a stock-taking of natural\r\nresources and a searching of the national conscience. Then, suddenly,\r\nthere emerges a quite new national policy. Conceived during the last\r\nAdministration, when it brought Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Bryan on to the\r\nsame platform, Conservation at once rose above party, and will be the\r\naccepted policy of all future Administrations. It has already secured\r\nalmost Pan-American endorsement at its birthplace in Washington. The\r\nfathers of Conservation are now looking forward to a still larger sphere\r\nof influence for their offspring at an International Conference which it\r\nis hoped to assemble at the Hague.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that no such reception was accorded to Mr.\r\nRoosevelt's other policy, to which our attention must now be turned. The\r\nreasons for the comparative lack of interest in the problem of Rural\r\nLife are many and complex, but two of them may be noted in passing.\r\nConservation calls for legislative and administrative action, and this\r\nalways sets up a ferment in the political mind. The Rural Life idea, on\r\nthe other hand, though it will demand some governmental assistance, must\r\nrely mainly upon voluntary effort. The methods necessary for its\r\ndevelopment, and their probable results, are also less obvious, and thus\r\nless easily appreciated by the public. Whatever the reason, while\r\nConservation has rushed into the forefront of public interest and has\r\nwon the status and dignity of a policy, the sister idea is still\r\nstruggling for a platform, and its advocates must be content to see\r\ntheir efforts towards a higher and a better country life regarded as a\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of the relative positions of these two ideas in the public\r\nmind will, I think, be borne out when we contrast the quiet initiation\r\nof the movement with the dramatic début of the policy. For all the\r\nofficialism with which it was launched, President Roosevelt's Country\r\nLife Commission might as well have been appointed by some wealthy\r\nphilanthropist who would, at least, have paid its members' travelling\r\nexpenses,[1] and private initiation might also have spared us the\r\nridicule which greeted the alleged proposal to \"uplift\" a body of\r\ncitizens who were told that they were already adorning the heights of\r\nAmerican civilisation. The names of the men who volunteered for this\r\nunpaid service should have been a sufficient guarantee that theirs was\r\nno fool's errand.[2]\r\n\r\nHow real was the problem the commissioners were investigating was\r\nabundantly proved to those who were present when they got into touch\r\nwith working farmers and their wives, and discussed freely and\r\ninformally the conditions, human and material, to which the problem of\r\nRural Life relates. I shall refer again to their report. But I may here\r\nsay I am firmly convinced that a complete change in the whole attitude\r\nof public opinion towards the old question of town and country must\r\nprecede any large practical outcome to the labours of the Commission. It\r\nhas to be brought home to those who lead public opinion that for many\r\ndecades we, the English-speaking peoples, have been unconsciously guilty\r\nof having gravely neglected one side, and that perhaps the most\r\nimportant side, of Western civilisation.\r\n\r\nTo sustain this judgment I must now view the sequence of events which\r\nled to the subordination of rural to urban interests, and try to\r\nestimate its probable consequences. It will be seen that the neglect is\r\ncomparatively recent, and of English origin. I believe that the New\r\nWorld offers just now a rare opportunity for launching a movement which\r\nwill be directed to a reconstruction of rural life. It is this belief\r\nwhich has prompted an Irish advocate of rural reform to turn his\r\nthoughts away for a brief space from the poorer peasantry of his own\r\ncountry and to take counsel with his fellow-workers in the United States\r\nand Canada on a problem which affects them all.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] These, as a matter of fact, were defrayed by the trustees of the\r\nRussell Sage Foundation.\r\n\r\n[2] The Commission consisted of L. H. Bailey, of the New York State\r\nCollege of Agriculture at Cornell University (chairman); Henry Wallace,\r\neditor of _Wallace's Farmer_, Des Moines, Iowa; Kenyon L. Butterfield,\r\nPresident of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst,\r\nMassachusetts; Walter H. Page, editor of _The World's Work_, New York\r\nCity; Gifford Pinchot, United States Forester, and Chairman of the\r\nNational Conservation Commission; C. S. Barrett, President of the\r\nFarmers' Co-operative and Educational Union of America, Union City,\r\nGeorgia; W. A. Beard, of the _Great West Magazine_, Sacramento,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND CONSEQUENCES OF RURAL NEGLECT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most radical economic change which history records set in during the\r\nlast half of the eighteenth century in England, as the result of that\r\nremarkable achievement of modern civilisation, the Industrial\r\nRevolution. Mechanical inventions changed all industry, setting up the\r\nfactories of the town instead of the scattered home production of the\r\ncountry and its villages. In the wake of the new inventions economic\r\nscience stepped in, and, scrupulously obeying its own law of demand and\r\nsupply, told the then predominant middle classes just what they wished\r\nto be told. Adam Smith had made the wonderful discovery that money and\r\nwealth were not the same thing. Then Ricardo, and after him the\r\nManchester School of economists, made division of labour the cardinal\r\nvirtue in the new gospel of wealth. In order to give full play to this\r\neconomic principle all workers in mechanical industries were huddled\r\ntogether in the towns. There they were to be transformed from\r\ncapricious, undisciplined humans into mechanical attachments, and\r\nrestricted to such functions as steam-driven automata had not yet\r\nlearned to perform. That was the first stage of the Industrial\r\nRevolution, with its chief consequences, the rural exodus and urban\r\novercrowding. It is a hideous nightmare to look back upon from these\r\nmore enlightened days. Well might the angels weep over the flight of all\r\nthat was best from the God-made country to the man-made town.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the last century the clouds began to lift. For a\r\nwhile the good Lord Shaftesbury seemed to be crying in the wilderness of\r\nmiddle-class plutocracy, but it was not long before the crying of the\r\nchildren in their factories stirred the national conscience. The health\r\nof nations was allowed to be considered as well as their wealth. Social\r\nand political science rose up in protest against both the economists and\r\nthe manufacturers. There followed a period of beneficent social changes,\r\nno less radical than those which the new mechanical inventions had\r\nproduced in the economics of industry. The factory town of to-day\r\npresents a strange contrast to that which sacrificed humanity to\r\nmaterial aggrandisement. What with its shortened hours of labour,\r\nsuperior artisan dwellings, improved sanitation, parks, open spaces and\r\nplaygrounds, free instruction and cheap entertainment for old and young,\r\nhospitals and charities, rapid transportation, a popular Press, and full\r\npolitical freedom, the modern hive of industry stands as a monument of\r\nwhat, under liberal laws, can be done by education and organisation to\r\nrealise the higher aspirations of a people.\r\n\r\nDuring this second period, another economic development produced upon\r\nthe attitude of the urban mind towards the rural population an effect to\r\nwhich, I think, has not been given the consideration it deserves. Better\r\nand cheaper transportation, with the consequent establishment of what\r\nthe economists call the world-market, completely changed the\r\nrelationship between the townsman and the farmer. A sketch of their\r\nformer mutual relations will make my meaning clear. Within the last\r\ncentury every town relied largely for its food supply on the produce of\r\nthe fields around its walls. The countrymen coming into the weekly\r\nmarket were the chief customers for the wares of the town craftsmen. In\r\nthis primitive state of trade, townsmen could not but realise the\r\nimportance to themselves of a prosperous country population around them.\r\nBut this simple exchange, as we all know, has developed into the complex\r\ncommercial operations of modern times. To-day most large towns derive\r\ntheir household stuff from the food-growing tracts of the whole world,\r\nand I doubt whether any are dependent on the neighbouring farmers, or\r\nfeel themselves specially concerned for their welfare. I do not think\r\nthe general truth of this picture will be questioned, and I hope some\r\nconsideration may be given to the conclusions I now draw.\r\n\r\nIn the transition we are considering, the reciprocity between the\r\nproducers of food and the raw material of clothes on the one hand, and\r\nmanufacturers and general traders of the towns on the other, has not\r\nceased; it has actually increased since the days of steam and\r\nelectricity. But it has become national, and even international, rather\r\nthan local. Town consumers are still dependent upon agricultural\r\nproducers, who, in turn, are much larger consumers than formerly of all\r\nkinds of commodities made in towns. Forty-two per cent of materials used\r\nin manufacture in the United States are from the farm, which also\r\ncontributes seventy per cent of the country's exports. But in the\r\ncomplexity of these trade developments townsmen have been cut off more\r\nand more from personal contact with the country, and in this way have\r\nlost their sense of its importance. My point is that the shifting of the\r\ntrade relationship of town and country from its former local to its\r\npresent national and international basis in reality increases their\r\ninterdependence. And I hold most strongly that until in this matter the\r\nobligations of a common citizenship are realised by the town, we cannot\r\nhope for any lasting National progress.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the causes which have begotten the neglect of rural life, no\r\none will gainsay the wisdom of estimating the consequences. These are\r\neconomic, social, and political; and I will discuss them briefly under\r\nthese heads. There are three main economic reasons which suggest a\r\ncloser study of rural conditions. First, there is the interdependence of\r\ntown and country, less obvious than it was in the days of the local\r\nmarket, but no less real. Any fall in the number, or decline in the\r\nefficiency, of the farming community, will be accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding fall in the country sale of town products. This is\r\nespecially true of America, where the foreign commerce is unimportant in\r\ncomparison with internal trade. To nourish country life is the best way\r\nto help home trade. And quite as important as these considerations is\r\nthe effect which good or bad farming must have upon the cost of living\r\nto the whole population. Excessive middle profits between producer and\r\nconsumer may largely account for the very serious rise in the price of\r\nstaple articles of food. This is a fact of the utmost significance, but,\r\nas I shall show later, the remedy for too high a cost of production and\r\ndistribution lies with the farmer, the improvement of whose business\r\nmethods will be seen to be the chief factor in the reform which the\r\nRural Life movement must attempt to introduce.\r\n\r\nThe essential dependence of nations on agriculture is the second\r\neconomic consideration. The author of \"The Return to the Land,\" Senator\r\nJules Méline (successively Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Commerce\r\nand Premier of France), tells us that this remarkable book is \"merely an\r\nexpansion of a profound thought uttered long ago by a Chinese\r\nphilosopher: 'The well-being of a people is like a tree; agriculture is\r\nits root, manufacture and commerce are its branches and its life; if the\r\nroot is injured the leaves fall, the branches break away and the tree\r\ndies.'\"\r\n\r\nThis truth is not hard to apply to the conditions of to-day. The income\r\nof every country depends on its natural resources, and on the skill and\r\nenergy of its inhabitants; and the quickest way to increase the income\r\nis to concentrate on the production of those articles for which there is\r\nthe greatest demand throughout the commercial world. The relentless\r\napplication of this principle has been characteristic of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But the augmentation of income has in one special way been\r\npurchased by a diminution of capital. The industrial movement has been\r\nbased on an immense expenditure of coal and iron; and in America and\r\nGreat Britain the coal and iron which can be cheaply obtained are within\r\nmeasurable distance of exhaustion. As these supplies diminish, the\r\nindustrial leadership of America and Great Britain must disappear,\r\nunless they can employ their activities in other forms of industry.\r\nThose, therefore, who desire that the English-speaking countries should\r\nmaintain for many ages that high position which they now occupy, should\r\ndo all in their power to encourage a proper system of agriculture--the\r\none industry in which the fullest use can be made of natural resources\r\nwithout diminishing the inheritance of future generations--the industry\r\n\"about which,\" Mr. James J. Hill emphatically declares, \"all others\r\nrevolve, and by which future America shall stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nThe third economic reason will hardly be disputed. Agricultural\r\nprosperity is an important factor in financial stability. The\r\nfluctuations of commerce depend largely on the good and bad harvests of\r\nthe world, but, as they do not coincide with them in time, their\r\nviolence is, on the whole, likely to be less in a nation where\r\nagricultural and manufacturing interests balance each other, than in one\r\ndepending mainly or entirely on either. The small savings of numerous\r\nfarmers, amounting in the aggregate to very large sums, are a powerful\r\nmeans of steadying the money market; they are not liable to the\r\nvicissitudes nor attracted by the temptations which affect the larger\r\ninvestors. They remain a permanent national resource, which, as the\r\nexperience of France proves, may be confidently drawn upon in time of\r\nneed. I have often thought that, were it not for the thrift and industry\r\nof the French peasantry, financial crises would be as frequent in France\r\nas political upheavals.\r\n\r\nAs regards the social aspect of rural neglect, I suggest that the city\r\nmay be more seriously concerned than is generally imagined for the\r\nwell-being of the country. One cannot but admire the civic pride with\r\nwhich Americans contemplate their great centres of industry and\r\ncommerce, where, owing to the many and varied improvements, the townsman\r\nof the future is expected to unite the physical health and longevity of\r\nthe Boeotian with the mental superiority of the Athenian. But we may\r\nask whether this somewhat optimistic forecast does not ignore one\r\nimportant question. Has it been sufficiently considered how far the\r\nmoral and physical health of the modern city depends upon the constant\r\ninflux of fresh blood from the country, which has ever been the source\r\nfrom which the town draws its best citizenship? You cannot keep on\r\nindefinitely skimming the pan and have equally good milk left. In\r\nAmerica the drain may continue a while longer without the inevitable\r\nconsequences becoming plainly visible. But sooner or later, if the\r\nbalance of trade in this human traffic be not adjusted, the raw material\r\nout of which urban society is made will be seriously deteriorated, and\r\nthe symptoms of National degeneracy will be properly charged against\r\nthose who neglected to foresee the evil and treat the cause. It is\r\nenough for my present purpose if it be admitted that the people of every\r\nstate are largely bred in rural districts, and that the physical and\r\nmoral well-being of these districts must eventually influence the\r\nquality of the whole people.\r\n\r\nI come now to the political considerations which, I think, have not been\r\nsufficiently taken into account. In most countries political life\r\ndepends largely for its steadiness and sanity upon a strong infusion of\r\nrural opinion into the counsels of the nation. It is a truism that\r\ndemocracy requires for success a higher level of intelligence and\r\ncharacter in the mass of the people than other forms of government. But\r\nintelligence alone is not enough for the citizen of a democracy; he must\r\nhave experience as well, and the experience of a townsman is essentially\r\nimperfect. He has generally a wider theoretical knowledge than the\r\nrustic of the main processes by which the community lives; but the\r\nrustic's practical knowledge of the more fundamental of them is wider\r\nthan the townsman's. He knows actually and in detail how corn is grown\r\nand how beasts are bred, whereas the town artisan hardly knows how the\r\nwhole of any one article of commerce is made. The townsman sees and\r\ntakes part in the wonderful achievements of industrial science without\r\nany full understanding of its methods or of the relative importance and\r\nthe interaction of the forces engaged. To this one-sided experience may\r\nbe attributed in some measure that disregard of inconvenient facts, and\r\nthat impatience of the limits of practicability, which many observers\r\nnote as a characteristic defect of popular government.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, there is one symptom in modern politics of which\r\nthe gravity is generally acknowledged, while its special connection with\r\nthe towns is an easily ascertainable fact; I mean the growth of the\r\ncruder forms of Socialism. The town artisan or labourer, who sees\r\ndisplayed before him vast masses of property in which he has no share,\r\nand contrasts the smallness of his remuneration with the immense results\r\nof his labour, is easily attracted to remedies worse than the disease. A\r\nfuller and more exact understanding of the means by which the wealth of\r\nthe community is created is, for the townsman, the best antidote to\r\nmischievous agitation so far as it is not merely the result of poverty.\r\nBut the countryman, especially the proprietor of a piece of land,\r\nhowever small, is protected from this infection. The atmosphere in which\r\nSocialism of the predatory kind can grow up does not exist among a\r\nprosperous farming community--perhaps because in the country the\r\nquestion of the divorce of the worker from his raw material by\r\ncapitalism does not arise. The farm furnishes the raw material of the\r\nfarmer; yet he cannot be said to spend his life creating the alleged\r\n\"surplus value\" of Marxian doctrine. For these reasons I suggest that\r\nthe orderly and safe progress of democracy demands a strong agricultural\r\npopulation. It is as true now as when Aristotle said it that \"where\r\nhusbandmen and men of small fortune predominate government will be\r\nguided by law.\"\r\n\r\nI have now shown that for every reason the interests of the rural\r\npopulation ought no longer to be subordinated to those of the city. That\r\nsuch has been the tendency in English-speaking countries will hardly be\r\nquestioned. In Great Britain the rural exodus has gone on with a\r\nvengeance. The last census (1901) showed that seventy-seven per cent of\r\nthe population was urban, and only twenty-three per cent rural. A few\r\nyears ago there were derelict farms within easy walk of the outskirts\r\nof London. In Ireland the rural exodus took the form of emigration,\r\nmainly to American cities, and this has been the chief factor in the\r\nreduction of the population in sixty years from more than eight millions\r\nto a trifle above four. But it may be thought that in the United States\r\nno similar tendency is in operation. Certainly those who admit the\r\ntownward drift of country life may fairly say that it does not present\r\nso urgent a problem in the New World as in parts of the Old. Even\r\ngranting that this is so, the fact remains that the town population of\r\nAmerica is seriously outgrowing the rural population; for, while the\r\ntowns are growing hugely, the country stands still. Moreover, we must\r\nnot forget that, Australia apart, America is even still the most\r\nunderpopulated part of the globe. We are accustomed to think Ireland\r\nunderpopulated, owing to emigration, yet even to-day the scale of\r\npopulation is almost six times greater than that of the United States.\r\nIf the Union were peopled as thickly as Ireland even still is, the\r\npopulation would be nearly five hundred millions. There is still a vast\r\ndeal of filling-up to be done in America, mostly in the rural parts.\r\n\r\nBut the main consideration I wish to emphasise throughout is that the\r\nproblem under review is moral and social far more than economic, human\r\nrather than material. This is the natural view of an Irish worker, who\r\nknows that the solution of _his_ problem depends upon the possibility of\r\nendowing country life with such social improvements as will provide an\r\neffective compensation for a necessarily modest standard of comfort. But\r\nthe citizens of the United States may be pardoned for being physiocrats.\r\nThe statistical proof, annually furnished, of the growing agricultural\r\nwealth, is apt to obscure other essentials of progress. The astronomical\r\nproportions of the figures stagger the imagination, and engender the\r\nkind of pride a man feels when he is first told the number of red\r\ncorpuscles luxuriating in his blood. How can there be agricultural\r\ndepression in a country whose farm lands Secretary Wilson, in his\r\nnotable Annual Report for 1905, declared to have increased in value over\r\na period of five years at the astounding rate of $3,400,000 per day? Yet\r\nto the deeper insight, the same moral influence through which we in\r\nIreland are seeking to combat the evils of material poverty may in the\r\nUnited States be needed as a moral corrective to a too rapidly growing\r\nmaterial prosperity. The patriotic American, who thinks of the life of\r\nthe Nation rather than of the individual, will, if he looks beneath the\r\nsurface, discern in this God-prospered country symptoms of rural\r\ndecadence fraught with danger to National efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe reckless sacrifice of agricultural interests by the legislators of\r\nthe towns is condemned by the verdict of history. We need not now fear\r\nthat invading hordes of hardy barbarians will mar the destiny of the\r\ngreat Western Republic, as they ended the career of the Roman Empire.\r\nThere are, however, other clouds upon the horizon. Only a few years ago,\r\nthe American people could well treat with contempt the bogy of the\r\nYellow Peril. With a transformation unprecedented in history, the\r\nsituation has been changed. Japan is already devoting to the arts of\r\npeace qualities but yesterday displayed in war, to the amazement of the\r\nWestern world. In another Eastern empire there are vast\r\nresources--especially coal and iron in juxtaposition--awaiting only\r\nindustrial leadership to utilise a practically limitless labour supply\r\nfor their development. These are facts worthy of consideration for their\r\npotential bearing upon the industrial and commercial standing of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nTo the onlooker, it does seem a happy circumstance that there has just\r\nbeen, for seven critical years, at the head of American affairs the\r\nstrenuous advocate of the strenuous life. I read through his Messages\r\nthe warning that in the struggle for preëminence the ultimate victory\r\nwill lie with those nations who found their prosperity on the high\r\nphysical and ethical condition of the people. That is the oldest, as it\r\nis the latest, wisdom of the East. It is in this spirit that the\r\nneglected problem of Rural Life should now be given some share of the\r\nattention hitherto devoted to the life of the towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE INNER LIFE OF THE AMERICAN FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently asked a German economist if he could tell me the best books\r\nto read upon the problem of rural life in Germany. His reply was: \"There\r\nare no books, because there is no problem.\" It is generally true, no\r\ndoubt, that the Rural Life problem, in so far as it consists in the\r\nsubordination of the country to the town, is peculiar to the\r\nEnglish-speaking countries, where it seems to be mainly attributable to\r\nthree causes. The chief of these was no doubt the Industrial Revolution\r\nin England, of which enough has already been said. Secondly, in the\r\nUnited States and in some portions of the British Empire, the opening up\r\nof vast tracts of virgin soil led not unnaturally to the postponement of\r\nsocial development until the pioneer farmers had settled down to the\r\nnew life. The third cause was immunity from the danger of foreign\r\ninvasion, which eliminated the military reasons for maintaining a\r\nnumerous, virile, and progressive rural population.\r\n\r\nThere are many in England who regret that it should have been forgotten\r\nhow the English owed their commercial supremacy to the fighting\r\nqualities of the old yeoman class. In the United States it should be\r\nremembered that nowadays peace strength is quite as important as war\r\nstrength, and it may be questioned whether there can be any sustained\r\nindustrial efficiency where the great body of workers who conduct the\r\nchief--the only absolutely necessary--industry are wasting the resources\r\nat their command by bad husbandry. We may, however, concede that the\r\nneglect of rural life is much easier to explain and excuse in the United\r\nStates than in the older English-speaking countries. Quite apart from\r\nthe abundance of agricultural resources which the American farmers\r\nenjoy, it might well be thought that the rural communities are keeping\r\npace with the progress of urban civilisation. The citizens who now\r\noccupy the farm lands of the United States have been largely drawn from\r\nthe pick of the European peasantries. In the days of their coming, it\r\ntook courage and enterprise to face the now almost forgotten terrors of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean. These immigrants, and the migrants from the Eastern\r\nStates, have profited enormously by their change of residence. Their\r\nmaterial well-being has already been admitted, and, with rare\r\nexceptions, they have displayed no overt symptoms of agrarian\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be imagined that the apparent apathy of American\r\nfarmers is due to contentment. Like others of their calling, they keep a\r\nfull stock of grievances in their mental stores. They have very definite\r\nopinions as to what is wrong, but to these opinions no formal expression\r\nis given. They vaguely feel that they would like to remould \"the sorry\r\nscheme of things entire,\" but they lack the public spirit which is\r\nrequired before concerted action can be taken successfully. The Country\r\nLife Commission held a series of conferences throughout the United\r\nStates, which brought them into the closest touch with every type of\r\nAmerican farm life. They received written replies from some 125,000\r\nrural folk to whom they had sent a circular with a dozen questions\r\ncovering the essential heads of inquiry. The Commissioners say in their\r\nreport: \"We have found by the testimony, not only of the farmers\r\nthemselves, but of all persons in touch with farm life, more or less\r\nserious unrest in every part of the United States, even in the most\r\nprosperous regions.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that, while judged by the standard of living of European\r\npeasantries, the farmers of the United States are prosperous, in\r\ncomparison with the other citizens of the most progressive country in\r\nthe world they are not well-off. Their accumulation of material wealth\r\nis unnaturally and unnecessarily restricted; their social life is\r\nbarren; their political influence is relatively small. American farmers\r\nhave been used by politicians, but have still to learn how to use them.\r\nThis may be due to the fact that my countrymen elected to devote their\r\ngenius for organisation to the problems of city government. And in the\r\nsphere of private action they are, as will be seen when I discuss the\r\nneed for a reorganisation of their business, even less effective than in\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nIt will be conceded that any hopeful plan to put things right will have\r\nto rely upon the organised efforts of those immediately concerned. Both\r\nin the sphere of governmental action, and in the vastly more important\r\nfield of voluntary effort, the moving force will have to be public\r\nopinion. But the thought of the farming communities has long ago joined\r\nthe rural exodus; and before the country life idea can find expression\r\nin an effective country life movement, those who are thinking out the\r\nproblem will have to commend their arguments to the thought of the\r\ntowns. Therefore I address these pages, not to farmers only, but to the\r\ngeneral reader--who, I may observe, does not generally read if he\r\nhappens to live in the open country.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my own studies of American rural life I have found it\r\nconvenient to divide the United States into four sections, each of them\r\nmore or less homogeneous. As this method of treatment may help my\r\nreaders, I will give them a look at my map of American rural life. The\r\nfour sections may be called the North Eastern, the Middle Western, the\r\nSouthern, and the Far Western. The division has no pretensions to be\r\nscientific; the boundaries can be adjusted to fit in with the experience\r\nof each reader.\r\n\r\nIn my North Eastern section I include the New England States, New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and most of Pennsylvania. This is a section where\r\nmanufacturing communities have long been established, where migration\r\nfrom country to town has been most marked, and where the competition of\r\nthe newly settled Western farm lands has been followed by effects upon\r\nagricultural society very similar to those produced by the same causes\r\nin many a rural community on the Continent of Europe. Second comes the\r\nMiddle Western section, consisting mainly of the Mississippi Valley,\r\nwith its vast area of high average fertility, the greatest\r\nfood-producing tract on the continent. Third, I place the Southern\r\nsection, where the governing factors in rural economy are the climate,\r\nthe numerical strength of the colored population, the two staple\r\nindustrial crops--cotton and tobacco--the comparatively recent abolition\r\nof slavery, and the long-drawn-out effects of the Civil War. My fourth\r\ndivision, the Far Western section, includes the ranching lands of the\r\narid belt with their irrigation oases, and the fruit-growing and farming\r\nlands of the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nAs we are discussing the problem chiefly in its human aspect, which\r\naffects alike communities wealthy and impoverished, large and small,\r\nold-settled and newly established, it will not matter essentially where\r\nwe first direct our attention for the purpose of illustration. But if,\r\nas I hold, nothing less than a reconstruction of rural civilisation is\r\ncalled for, our inquiries will be more profitably directed to those\r\nsections where agricultural society is permanently established, or where\r\nthe rural population might abandon the migratory habit if the conditions\r\nwere more favorable to an advanced civilisation. At the present stage I\r\nfeel that the whole subject can be most profitably discussed in its\r\napplication to the Middle Western and the Southern sections. Here the\r\nintimate relationship of the Conservation and the Country Life ideas is\r\nbest illustrated. Here, too, we get into touch with the problem at its\r\ntwo extremes of prosperity and poverty, each in its own way retarding\r\nthe progress of rural civilisation. In both sections the conditions are\r\ntypical, and distinctively American.\r\n\r\nLet us then consider first the general course of rural civilisation in\r\nthe great food-producing tract of the Middle West. I have in my mind the\r\nportion I know best, the last-settled part of the corn belt. Thirty\r\nyears ago I saw something of the newcomers who settled in this section,\r\nwhere there was still much raw land. These settlers, knowing that the\r\nland must rise rapidly in value, almost invariably purchased much larger\r\nfarms than they could handle. They often sank their available working\r\ncapital in making the first payments for their land, and went heavily\r\ninto debt for the balance. They became \"land poor,\" and, in order to\r\nmeet the instalments of purchase and the high interest on their\r\nmortgages, they invented a system of farming unprecedented in its\r\nwastefulness. The farm was treated as a mine, or, to use Mr. James J.\r\nHill's metaphor, as a bank where the depositors are always taking out\r\nmore than they put in. A corn crop, year after year, without rotation or\r\nfertilisers, satisfied the new conception of husbandry--the easiest and\r\nleast costly extraction of the wealth in the soil. Land, labour,\r\ncapital, and ability I had been taught to regard as the essentials of\r\nproduction; but here capital was reduced to the minimum, and ability\r\nleft to nature. Many of the young men who took Horace Greeley's advice\r\nand went West knew nothing about farming. I remember writing home that I\r\nwas in a country where the rolling stone gathered most moss. Possibly\r\nthe method adopted was the quickest way to get rich; living on capital\r\nis all right provided somebody will replace the squandered resources.\r\nWhile there were ample unoccupied lands, Uncle Sam looked kindly upon\r\nthese enterprising pioneers. It was only in the second Roosevelt\r\nAdministration that it dawned upon the national conscience that the\r\nnation had some claim to be considered as well as the individual. Of\r\ncourse all this is changed now; although I am not sure that western\r\nCanada is not being educated in soil exhaustion by some of these\r\nextemporised husbandmen whose habits and temperament lead them to seek\r\n\"fresh fields and pastures new.\" \"We are not out here for our health,\"\r\nwas the reply I got when I showed that my old-fashioned economic sense\r\nwas shocked by this substitution of land speculation for farming.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this very uneconomic procedure is capable of some\r\nplausible explanations. The opening up of the vast new territory by the\r\nprovision of local traffic for transcontinental lines was an object of\r\nnational urgency and importance. Nevertheless, I think it must now be\r\nregretted that a little more thought was not given to the general\r\nproblem of rural economy, of which transit is but one factor. This may\r\nbe that irritating kind of wisdom which comes after the event, but I\r\ncannot help regarding the policy of rewarding railroad enterprises with\r\nunconditional grants of vast areas of agricultural land as one of the\r\nmany evidences of the urban domination over rural affairs.\r\n\r\nOf the earlier settled portions of this section I cannot speak from\r\npersonal knowledge. But a recent magazine article,[3] \"The Agrarian\r\nRevolution in the Middle West,\" follows closely the line of my own\r\nthoughts. In this article Mr. Joseph B. Ross, of Lafayette, Indiana, who\r\nis making a special study of the evolution of American rural life,\r\nconsiders it in three periods: from 1800 to 1835, from 1835 to 1890, and\r\nfrom 1890 to the present time. In the middle period he shows how the\r\nmost progressive families raised their standard of living steadily with\r\nthe growing prosperity of the country. They built themselves stately\r\nhomes with substantial barns. The farmer was developing into a citizen\r\nwith the solid virtues, the virile independence, the strong political\r\nopinions, religious interest, and social instincts which characterised\r\nthe English yeoman of the preceding century. The social life which these\r\ncommunities built up, as soon as their economic position was assured,\r\nwas a reflection of the best English traditions--it centred round the\r\nchurches and the Sunday-school. There was a growing distribution of\r\nliterature as well as organisation for intellectual, educational and\r\nsocial purposes. Mr. Ross notes the winter excursions to Florida and\r\nCalifornia, the adornment of the homes, and many other evidences of a\r\nsocial progress developing a character of its own. During this period\r\nthere was a migration from the country homes to the cities; but it was\r\nonly the natural outflow of the surplus members of the rural families\r\ninto the professional and business life of the growing centres of\r\ncommerce and industry.\r\n\r\nIn the period through which we are now passing a transformation is\r\ntaking place. The rural exodus is no longer that of individuals, but of\r\nwhole families. The farms thus vacated are let to tenants, generally on\r\na three years' lease, at a competition rent. The Country Life Commission\r\nsays that this tendency to move to the cities \"is not peculiar to any\r\nregion. In difficult farming regions, and where the competition with\r\nother farming sections is most severe, the young people may go to town\r\nto better their condition. In the best regions the older people retire\r\nto town because it is socially more attractive, and they see a prospect\r\nof living in comparative ease and comfort on the rental of their lands.\r\nNearly everywhere there is a townward movement for the purpose of\r\nsecuring school advantages for the children. All this tends to sterilize\r\nthe open country and to lower its social status.\" The Commission points\r\nout that the new addition of what is likely to be a stationary element,\r\nwhose economic interests lie elsewhere, to the citizenship of the town,\r\nmay create there a new social problem, while the tenant in the country\r\nwill not have that interest in building up rural society which might be\r\nexpected in the owners of land. Mr. Ross's studies lead him very\r\ndefinitely to the same conclusion. Churches and educational\r\ninstitutions, he tells us, are being starved, and rural society is fast\r\nreverting to the type which was prevalent from thirty to fifty years\r\nago. But there is one great difference between then and now. Then, rural\r\ncivilisation was passing through a stage of marked social advancement\r\nwhich was common throughout the country; now, there are distinct\r\nindications of social degeneration, which Mr. Ross regards as the\r\ninevitable consequence of the new landlord and tenant system. Many\r\nmembers of these communities must have left the Old World to escape from\r\nthe selfsame conditions which they are reproducing in the New.\r\n\r\nRural society in the Middle West, as it presents itself to the observer\r\nwhose authority I have cited, is obviously in a transitional stage. The\r\nlack of farm labourers, which is the common subject of complaint by\r\nfarmers in all parts of the United States, cannot fail to be aggravated\r\nby the change in the conditions of tenancy just noted. The man whose\r\nchief concern is to get the most out of the land, at the least expense,\r\nin two or three years, will not treat his labourers so well--nor the\r\nland so well--as will the man who means to spend his life on the farm;\r\nand therefore the labourers will not stay. This scarcity of labour may\r\nbe met to some extent by an increased use of machinery; but it is more\r\nlikely to lead to poorer cultivation, which means the depopulation of\r\nagricultural districts. England and Ireland furnish too many examples of\r\nthe rural decay immortalised in Goldsmith's \"Deserted Village.\" It would\r\nbe strange and sad if the experience were to be repeated on the richest\r\nsoil of America.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern section we find a wastefulness similar to that in the\r\ncorn belt, but due to wholly different causes. The communities are\r\nold-settled, but in many instances they are still abnormally depressed\r\nby the terrible effects of the great war, followed by a period of social\r\nand economic stagnation. Here there was little but agriculture for the\r\npeople to rely upon, and their methods have, until recent years, been\r\nvery backward. The growing of the same crops year after year upon the\r\nsame fields, the neglect of precaution against the washing away of the\r\nsoil surface, and the failure to use fertilisers, have made the profits\r\nof tillage disappointingly small. Billions of dollars have been lost by\r\nthese communities through persistent soil exhaustion and erosion. In the\r\nlast few years the Federal Department of Agriculture has maintained a\r\nmost efficient staff of agricultural experts under the direction of Dr.\r\nKnapp, one of the ablest organisers of farm improvement I have ever met.\r\nThe General Education Board, who administer large sums provided by Mr.\r\nRockefeller, recognising the educational value of Dr. Knapp's\r\noperations, are contributing about one hundred thousand dollars a year\r\nto his work. Dr. Knapp and his field agents have no difficulty at all in\r\ndemonstrating that the yield may be doubled, and the cost of production\r\ngreatly reduced, merely by the application of the most elementary\r\nscience to agriculture. I heard him tell of a farmer whom he had induced\r\nto allow his boy--still attending school--to cultivate one acre under\r\nhis instructions. In the result the boy quadrupled the number of bushels\r\nof corn to the acre that his father, following the traditional methods,\r\nwas able to raise. It would be easy to multiply such instances of\r\nthriftlessness and neglected opportunity, of poverty within easy reach\r\nof abundance, which have brought it about that the future of the nation\r\nis actually endangered by the failure of the food supply to keep pace\r\nwith the increase of its still relatively sparse population.\r\n\r\nThe Southern section furnishes two illustrations of long-standing\r\nneglect, both well worthy of consideration for their pregnant\r\nsuggestiveness. The Federal Department of Agriculture recently scored a\r\nnotable success in dealing with an insect pest which was threatening the\r\ncotton-growing industry with economic ruin. The boll-weevil, like the\r\nlegal and medical professions, thrives upon the follies of humanity. It\r\nattacks the cotton plants which have been weakened by bad husbandry. The\r\nscientists did not succeed in finding in the commonwealth of bugs the\r\nnatural enemy of the pest they were after, but Dr. Knapp, with the\r\nwisdom which prefers prevention to cure, seized the opportunity of\r\nteaching cotton-growers to diversify their cultivation. The consequence\r\nwas that the cotton crop itself is gradually responding to the\r\ntreatment. Many other crops are adding their quota to the produce of the\r\nSouthern farms, and an all-round improvement, moral as well as material,\r\nis accompanying the educational discipline through which this reformer\r\nis putting the communities with whom and for whom he is working.\r\n\r\nThere is another pest in the South which does not attack the farm crops,\r\nbut goes straight for the farmer. If the Country Life Commission had\r\ndone nothing more, they would have justified their appointment by the\r\nattention they called to the ravages of the hookworm, which have, no one\r\nknows how long, scourged the poor white communities in the Southern\r\nStates. The effect of the disease set up by the hookworm, which infests\r\nthe intestines, is a complete sapping of all energy, mental and\r\nphysical. Mr. Rockefeller has provided a million dollars for the\r\nnecessary research work and for such subsequent organisation of sanitary\r\neffort as may be required to extirpate this unquestionably preventable\r\nevil. I wonder how long such a state of affairs would have been\r\npermitted to interfere with the health and to paralyse the industry of\r\nurban communities. Had the hookworm, instead of lurking in country\r\nlanes, walked the streets, how would it have fared?\r\n\r\nThese two pests furnish a fine illustration of the length to which the\r\nneglect of rural life has been allowed to go in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nNeither the Eastern nor the Far Western section presents aspects of\r\nspecial interest to the foreign student of the Rural problem in the\r\nUnited States, but in both the constructive statesman and the social\r\nworker will find a rich field for their efforts. In the New England\r\nStates--more especially in the manufacturing districts--the competition\r\nbetween town and country for labour is as marked as in Industrial\r\nEngland. In this section, however, the lure of the city has a rival in\r\nthe call of the West, which still makes its appeal to the farmer's boy.\r\nSecretary Wilson has recently given it as his opinion that land-seekers\r\nwho pass by the farms now offered for sale in the western portions of\r\nNew York State often go further and fare worse. In these relatively\r\nlow-priced lands, it ought not to be difficult for agricultural\r\ncommunities to establish permanently a rural society worthy of American\r\nideas of progress. But to do this is to solve the problem we are\r\ndiscussing. We have some other aspects of that problem to consider\r\nbefore we can agree upon the essentials of a philosophic and\r\ncomprehensive scheme for the rehabilitation of rural life--before we can\r\nlay down the lines of a movement to give effect to our plan.\r\n\r\nThe Far Western section has hardly yet emerged from the frontier-pioneer\r\nstage, and its rural problem is still below the horizon. I may, however,\r\nnote in passing a few evidences that the people of this section have\r\nalready shown a very real concern for rural progress. The fruit-growers\r\nof the Pacific Coast have, in the coöperative marketing of their\r\nproduce, made an excellent beginning in a matter of first importance in\r\nany scheme of rural development. On irrigation farm lands there has\r\nbeen developed, in connection with the upkeep and control of the water\r\nsystems, a community spirit which will surely lead to many forms of\r\norganisation for mutual economic and social advantage. In the city of\r\nSpokane, Washington, the Chamber of Commerce has aroused a public\r\ninterest in the work of the Country Life Commission which, so far as my\r\ninformation goes, has not been equalled elsewhere in the United States.\r\nThe Chamber is republishing the Report of the Commission, for which no\r\nFederal appropriation appears to have been made. It would seem to be a\r\nnot wild speculation that the statesmen and social workers who will\r\nfirst solve the rural problem of the English-speaking peoples may be\r\nfound in the Far West of the New World as well as of the Old.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude the diagnosis of rural decadence by a consideration\r\nof what in my judgment is the chief cause of the malady, and so get to\r\na point where we can determine the nature of the remedy. It will then\r\nremain only to sketch the outlines of the movement which is to give\r\npractical effect to the agreed principles in the life of rural\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] _North American Review_, September, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE WEAK SPOT IN AMERICAN RURAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence of competent American witnesses proves that there is, in\r\nthe United States, notwithstanding its immense agricultural wealth, a\r\nRural Life problem. Here, as elsewhere, on a fuller analysis, the utmost\r\nvariety of race, soil, climate and market facilities serve but to\r\nemphasise the importance of the human factor. But this consideration\r\ndoes not lessen the need for a sternly practical treatment of the rural\r\nsocial economy under review. In this chapter, I propose to go right down\r\nto the roots of the rural problem, find what is wrong with the industry\r\nby which the country people live, and see how it can be righted. We\r\nshould then have clearly in our minds the essentials of prosperity in a\r\nrural community.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, the basis of a rural existence, must be regarded as a\r\nscience, as a business and as a life. I have already adverted to\r\nPresident Roosevelt's formula for solving the rural problem--\"better\r\nfarming, better business, better living.\" Better farming simply means\r\nthe application of modern science to the practice of agriculture. Better\r\nbusiness is the no less necessary application of modern commercial\r\nmethods to the business side of the farming industry. Better living is\r\nthe building up, in rural communities, of a domestic and social life\r\nwhich will withstand the growing attractions of the modern city.\r\n\r\nThis threefold scheme of reform covers the whole ground and will become\r\nthe basis of the Country Life movement to be suggested later. But in the\r\nworking out of the general scheme, there must be one important change in\r\nthe order of procedure--'better business' must come first. The dull\r\ncommercial details of agriculture have been sadly neglected, perhaps on\r\naccount of the more human interest of the scientific and social aspects\r\nof country life. Yet my own experience in working at the rural problem\r\nin Ireland has convinced me that our first step towards its solution is\r\nto be found in a better organisation of the farmer's business. It is\r\nstrange but true that the level of efficiency reached in many European\r\ncountries was due to American competition, which in the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century forced Continental farmers to reorganise their\r\nindustry alike in production, in distribution and in its finance. Both\r\nIrish experience and Continental study have convinced me that neither\r\ngood husbandry nor a worthy social life can be ensured unless\r\naccompanied by intelligent and efficient business methods. We must,\r\ntherefore, examine somewhat critically the agricultural system of the\r\nAmerican farmer, and see wherein its weakness lies.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the business methods of the town to those of the\r\ncountry is obvious, but I do not think the precise nature of that\r\nsuperiority is generally understood. What strikes the eye is the\r\nmaterial apparatus of business,--the street cars, the advertisements,\r\nthe exchange, the telephone, the typewriter; all these form an\r\nimpressive contrast with the slow, simple life of the farmer, who very\r\nlikely scratches his accounts on a shingle or keeps them in his head.\r\nBut most of this city apparatus is due merely to the necessity of swift\r\nmovement in the concentrated process of exchange and distribution. Such\r\nswiftness is neither necessary nor possible in the process of isolated\r\nproduction. But there is an economic law, applicable alike to rural and\r\nto urban pursuits, which is being more and more fully recognised and\r\nobeyed by the farmers of most European countries, including Ireland, but\r\nwhich has been too little heeded by the farmers of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain. Under modern economic conditions, things must be done in\r\na large way if they are to be done profitably; and this necessitates a\r\nresort to combination.\r\n\r\nThe advantage which combination gives to the town over the country was\r\nrecognised long before the recent economic changes forced men to\r\ncombine. In the old towns of Europe all trades began as strict and\r\nexclusive corporations. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries new\r\nscientific and economic forces broke up these combinations, which were\r\nfar too narrow for the growing volume of industrial activity, and an\r\nepoch of competition began. The great towns of America opened their\r\nbusiness career during this epoch, and have brought the arts of\r\ncompetition to a higher perfection than exists in Europe. But it has\r\nalways been known that competition did not exclude combination against\r\nthe consumer; and it is now beginning to be perceived that the fiercer\r\nthe competition, the more surely does it lead in the end to such\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nA trade combination has three principal objects: it aims, first, at\r\nimproving what I may call the internal business methods of the trade\r\nitself by eliminating the waste due to competition, by economising\r\nstaff, plant, etc., and by the ready circulation of intelligence, and in\r\nother ways. In the second place, it aims at strengthening the trade\r\nagainst outside interests. These may be of various kinds; but in the\r\ntypical case we are considering, namely, the combination of great\r\nmiddlemen who control exchange and distribution, the outside interests\r\nare those of the producer on one side and the consumer on the other; and\r\nthe trade combination, by its organised unity of action, succeeds in\r\nlowering the prices it pays to the unorganised producer and in raising\r\nthe prices it charges to the unorganised consumer. In the third place,\r\nthe trade combination seeks to favour its own interests in their\r\nrelation to other interests through political control--control not so\r\nmuch of the machinery of politics as of its products, legislation and\r\nadministration. I am not now arguing the question whether or how far\r\nthis action on the part of trade combinations is morally justifiable. My\r\npoint is simply that the towns have flourished at the expense of the\r\ncountry by the use of these methods, and that the countryman must adopt\r\nthem if he is to get his own again. Moreover, as organisation tends to\r\nincrease the volume and lower the cost of agricultural production and to\r\nmake possible large transactions between organised communities of\r\nfarmers and the trade, it will be seen that the organised combination of\r\nfarmers will simplify the whole commerce of those countries where it is\r\nadopted, and thus benefit alike the farmer and the trader.\r\n\r\nThis truth will be easily realised if we consider for a moment the\r\nsystem of distribution which the food demand of the modern market has\r\nevolved. Agricultural produce finds its chief market in the great\r\ncities. Their populations must have their food so sent in that it can\r\nbe rapidly distributed; and this requires that the consignments must be\r\ndelivered regularly, in large quantities, and of such uniform quality\r\nthat a sample will give a correct indication of the whole. These three\r\nconditions are essential to rapid distribution, but their fulfilment is\r\nnot within the power of isolated farmers, however large their\r\noperations. It is an open question whether farmers should themselves\r\nundertake the distribution of their produce through agencies of their\r\nown, thus saving the wholesale and possibly the retail profits. But\r\nunquestionably they should be so well organised at home that they can\r\ntake this course if they are unfairly treated by organised middlemen.\r\nThe Danish farmers, whose highly organised system of distribution has\r\nmade them the chief competitors of the Irish farmers, have established\r\n(with Government assistance which their organisation enabled them to\r\nsecure) very efficient machinery for distributing their butter, bacon\r\nand eggs in the British markets. Other European farming communities are\r\nbecoming equally well organised, and similarly control the marketing of\r\ntheir produce. But where, as in America and the United Kingdom, the town\r\ndominates the country, and the machinery of distribution is owned by the\r\nbusiness men of the towns, it is worked by them in their own interests.\r\nThey naturally take from the unorganised producers as well as from the\r\nunorganised consumers the full business value of the service they\r\nrender. With the growing cost of living, this has become a matter of\r\nurgent importance to the towns. In the cheaper-food campaign which began\r\nin the late fall of 1909, voices are heard calling the farmers to\r\naccount for their uneconomical methods, while here and there\r\norganisations of consumers are endeavouring to solve the problem to\r\ntheir own satisfaction by acquiring land and raising upon it the produce\r\nwhich they require.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such facts it is not easy to account for the\r\nbackwardness of American and British farmers in the obviously important\r\nmatter of organisation. The farmer, we know, is everywhere the most\r\nconservative and individualistic of human beings. He dislikes change in\r\nhis methods, and he venerates those which have come down to him from his\r\nfathers' fathers. Whatever else he may waste, these traditions he\r\nconserves. He does not wish to interfere with anybody else's business,\r\nand he is fixedly determined that others shall not interfere with his.\r\nThese estimable qualities make agricultural organisation more difficult\r\nin Anglo-Saxon communities than in those where clan or tribal instincts\r\nseem to survive.[4]\r\n\r\nNow it is fair to the farmer to admit that his calling does not lend\r\nitself readily to associative action. He lives apart; most of his time\r\nis spent in the open air, and in the evening of the working day physical\r\nrepose is more congenial to him than mental activity. But when all this\r\nis said, we have not a complete explanation of the fact that, by failing\r\nto combine, American and British farmers, persistently disobey an\r\naccepted law, and refuse to follow the almost universal practice of\r\nmodern business. I believe the true explanation to be one that has\r\nsomehow escaped the notice of the agricultural economist. Those who\r\naccept it will feel that they have found the weak spot in American\r\nfarming, and that the remedy is neither obscure nor difficult to apply.\r\n\r\nThe form of combination which the towns have invented for industrial and\r\ncommercial purposes is the Joint Stock Company. Here a number of persons\r\ncontribute their capital to a common fund and entrust the direction to\r\na single head or committee, taking no further part in the business\r\nexcept to change the management if the undertaking does not yield a\r\nsatisfactory dividend. Our urban way of looking at things has made us\r\nassume that this city system must be suitable to rural conditions. The\r\ncontrary is the fact. When farmers combine, it is a combination not of\r\nmoney only, but of personal effort in relation to the entire business.\r\nIn a coöperative creamery, for example, the chief contribution of a\r\nshareholder is in milk; in a coöperative elevator, corn; in other cases\r\nit may be fruit or vegetables, or a variety of material things rather\r\nthan cash. But it is, most of all, a combination of neighbours within an\r\narea small enough to allow of all the members meeting frequently at the\r\nbusiness centre. As the system develops, the local associations are\r\nfederated for larger business transactions, but these are governed by\r\ndelegates carefully chosen by the members of the constituent bodies.\r\n\r\nThe object of such associations is, primarily, not to declare a\r\ndividend, but rather to improve the conditions of the industry for the\r\nmembers. After an agreed interest has been paid upon the shares, the net\r\nprofits are divided between the participants in the undertaking, to each\r\nin proportion as he has contributed to them through the business he has\r\ndone with the institution. And the same idea is applied to the control\r\nof the management. It is recognised that the poor man's coöperation is\r\nas important as the rich man's subscription. 'One man, one vote,' is the\r\nalmost universal principle in coöperative bodies.[5]\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the capitalistic basis of joint stock\r\norganisation and the more human character of the coöperative system is\r\nfundamentally important. It is recognised by law in England, where the\r\ncoöperative trading societies are organised under _The Industrial and\r\nProvident Societies' Act_, and the coöperative credit associations under\r\n_The Friendly Societies' Act_. In the United States (I am told by\r\nfriends in the legal profession), the Articles of Association of an\r\nordinary limited liability company can be so drafted as to meet all the\r\nrequirements I have named. Most countries have enacted laws specially\r\ndevised to meet the requirements of coöperative societies. However it is\r\ndone, the essential of success in agricultural coöperation is that the\r\nterms and conditions upon which it is based shall be accepted by all\r\nconcerned as being equitable in the distribution of profits, risks and\r\ncontrol. It then becomes the interest of every member to give his\r\nwhole-hearted support and aid to the common undertaking. To accomplish\r\nthis, it is necessary to explain and secure the acceptance of a\r\nconstitution and procedure carefully thought out to suit each case. It\r\nwill be readily believed that associations of farmers which will meet\r\nthese conditions are not likely to be spontaneously generated; hence the\r\nnecessity for a plan and for the machinery to carry it through.\r\n\r\nIn this matter I am here speaking from practical experience in Ireland.\r\nTwenty years ago the pioneers of our rural life movement found it\r\nnecessary to concentrate their efforts upon the reorganisation of the\r\nfarmer's business. They saw that foreign competition was not, as was\r\ncommonly supposed, a visitation of Providence upon the farmers of the\r\nBritish Islands, but a natural economic revolution of permanent effect.\r\nOur message to Irish farmers was that they must imitate the methods of\r\ntheir Continental competitors, who were defeating them in their own\r\nmarkets simply by superior organisation. After five years of individual\r\npropagandism, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society was formed in\r\n1894 to meet the demand for instruction as to the formation and the\r\nworking of coöperative societies, a demand to which it was beyond the\r\nmeans of the few pioneers to respond.\r\n\r\nTwo decades of steady development have confirmed the soundness of the\r\noriginal scheme, and a brief account of agricultural coöperation in\r\nIreland will be of interest to any reader who has persevered so far. The\r\nconditions were in some respects favourable. The farms are small and\r\ntheir owners belong to the class to which coöperation brings most\r\nimmediate benefit. The Irish peasantry are highly intelligent. They lack\r\nthe strong individualism of the English, but they have highly developed\r\nassociative instincts. For this reason coöperation, an alternative to\r\ncommunism,--which they abhor,--comes naturally to them. On the other\r\nhand, the ease with which they can be organised makes them peculiarly\r\namenable to political influence. In backward rural communities the\r\ntrader is almost invariably the political boss. He is a leader of\r\nagrarian agitation, in which he can safely advocate principles he would\r\nnot like to see applied to the relations between himself and his\r\ncustomers. He bitterly opposes coöperation, which throws inconvenient\r\nlight upon those relations. We are able to persuade the more enlightened\r\nrural traders that economies effected in agricultural production will\r\nraise the standard of living of his customers and make them larger\r\nconsumers of general commodities and more punctual in their payments.\r\nBut in the majority of cases the agricultural organiser finds politics\r\nin sharp conflict with business, and has a hard row to hoe. So, while we\r\nhave advantages in organising Irish farmers, we have also, largely owing\r\nto well-known historical causes, to overcome difficulties which have no\r\ncounterpart in the United States or England.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we managed to make progress. We began with the dairying\r\nindustry, and already half the export of Irish butter comes from the\r\ncoöperative societies we established. Organised bodies of farmers are\r\nlearning to purchase their agricultural requirements intelligently and\r\neconomically. They are also beginning to adopt the methods of the\r\norganised foreign farmer in controlling the sale of their butter, eggs\r\nand poultry in the British markets. And they not only combine in\r\nagricultural production and distribution, but are also making a\r\npromising beginning in grappling with the problem of agricultural\r\nfinance. It is in this last portion of the Irish programme that by far\r\nthe most interesting study of the coöperative system can be made, on\r\naccount of its success in the poorest parts of the Island. Furthermore,\r\nthe attempt to enable the most embarrassed section of the Irish\r\npeasantry to procure working capital illustrates some features of\r\nagricultural coöperation which will have suggestive value for American\r\nfarmers. I will therefore give a brief description of our agricultural\r\ncoöperative credit associations.\r\n\r\nThe organisation was introduced in the middle of the last century by a\r\nGerman Burgomaster, the now famous Herr Raiffeisen. He set himself to\r\nprovide the means of escape from the degrading indebtedness to\r\nstorekeepers and usurers which is the almost invariable lot of poor\r\npeasantries. His scheme performs an apparent miracle. A body of very\r\npoor persons, individually--in the commercial sense of the\r\nterm--insolvent, manage to create a new basis of security which has been\r\nsomewhat grandiloquently and yet truthfully called the capitalisation of\r\ntheir honesty and industry. The way in which this is done is remarkably\r\ningenious. The credit society is organised in the usual democratic way\r\nexplained above, but its constitution is peculiar in one respect. The\r\nmembers have to become jointly and severally responsible for the debts\r\nof the association, which borrows on this unlimited liability from the\r\nordinary commercial bank, or, in some cases, from Government sources.\r\nAfter the initial stage, when the institution becomes firmly\r\nestablished, it attracts local deposits, and thus the savings of the\r\ncommunity, which are too often hoarded, are set free to fructify in the\r\ncommunity. The procedure by which the money borrowed is lent to the\r\nmembers of the association is the essential feature of the scheme. The\r\nmember requiring the loan must state what he is going to do with the\r\nmoney. He must satisfy the committee of the association, who know the\r\nman and his business, that the proposed investment is one which will\r\nenable him to repay both principal and interest. He must enter into a\r\nbond with two sureties for the repayment of the loan, and needless to\r\nsay the characters of both the borrower and his sureties are very\r\ncarefully considered. The period for which the loan is granted is\r\narranged to meet the needs of the case, as determined by the committee\r\nafter a full discussion with the borrower. Once the loan has been made,\r\nit becomes the concern of every member of the association to see that\r\nit is applied to the 'approved purpose'--as it is technically called.\r\nWhat is more important is that all the borrower's fellow-members become\r\ninterested in his business and anxious for its success.\r\n\r\nThe fact that nearly three hundred of these societies are at work in\r\nIreland, and that, although their transactions are on a very modest\r\nscale, the system is steadily growing both in the numbers of its\r\nadherents and in the business transacted is, I think, a remarkable\r\ntestimony to the value of the coöperative system. The details I have\r\ngiven illustrate the important distinction between coöperation, which\r\nenables the farmer to do his business in a way that suits him, and the\r\nurban form of combination, which is unsuited to his needs. The ordinary\r\nbanks lend money to agriculturists for a term (generally ninety days)\r\nwhich has been fixed to suit the needs of town business. Thus, a farmer\r\nborrowing money to sow a crop, or to purchase young cattle, is obliged\r\nto repay his loan, in the first instance, before the crop is harvested,\r\nand in the second, before the cattle mature and are marketable. Far more\r\nimportant, however, than these not inconsiderable economic advantages\r\nare the social benefits which are derived by bringing people together to\r\nachieve in a very definite and practical way the aim of all coöperative\r\neffort--self-help by mutual help.\r\n\r\nOur coöperative movement, taken as a whole, is to-day represented by\r\nnearly one thousand farmers' organisations, with an aggregate membership\r\nof some one hundred thousand persons, mostly heads of families. Its\r\nbusiness turnover last year was twelve and a half million dollars. In\r\nestimating the significance of these figures, American readers must not\r\n'think in continents,' and must give more weight to the moral than to\r\nthe material achievement. As I have explained, the coöperative system\r\nrequires for its success the exercise of higher moral qualities than\r\ndoes the joint stock company. Once a coöperative society becomes a\r\nsoulless corporation, its days are numbered. It requires also the\r\ndiffusion of a good deal of economic thought among its members, and\r\nthis, also, is no small matter in the conditions. The most striking fact\r\nabout this work in Ireland is that while in its earlier years\r\norganisation consisted mainly in expounding and commending to farmers\r\nthe coöperative principle, we now find that the principle is taken for\r\ngranted and the only question upon which advice is needed is how to\r\napply it. The progress of agricultural coöperation depends largely on\r\nthe character of the community; its commercial value may be measured by\r\nthe extent to which it develops in the community the mental and moral\r\nqualities essential to success.[6]\r\n\r\nIn agricultural coöperation, Ireland can claim to have shown the way to\r\nthe United Kingdom. Ten years ago, after the Irish movement had been\r\nlaunched, the English rural reformers started a movement on exactly the\r\nsame lines, even founding on the Irish model an English Agricultural\r\nOrganisation Society. An Irishman, who had studied coöperation at home,\r\nwas selected as its chief executive officer. Five years later, a\r\nScottish Agricultural Organisation Society took the field. Both in\r\nEngland and in Scotland the chief difficulty to be overcome is the\r\nintense individualism of the farmers, and perhaps some lack of altruism.\r\nThe large farmers did not feel the need of coöperation, and where the\r\nnatural leader of the rural community will not lead, the small\r\ncultivator cannot follow. Whether the same difficulties have prevented\r\nany considerable adoption of agricultural coöperation in the United\r\nStates, it is not necessary to inquire. It is certain that the\r\nunderlying principles approved by every progressive rural, community in\r\nEurope have not so far exercised more than an occasional and fitful\r\ninfluence upon the rural economy of the American Republic.\r\n\r\nIf I have given in these pages a true explanation of the deplorable\r\nbackwardness of American farmers in the matter of business combination\r\nwhen compared with all other American workers, those who take part in\r\nthe movement which is to provide the remedy will have set themselves a\r\ntask as hopeful as it is interesting. Americans as a people are addicted\r\nto associated action. I have seen the principle of coöperation developed\r\nto the highest point in the ranching industry in the days of the\r\nunfenced range. Our cattle used to roam at large, the only means of\r\nidentifying them being certain registered marks made by the\r\nbranding-iron and the knife. The individual owner would have had no more\r\nproperty in his herd than he would have had in so many fishes in the\r\nsea but for a very effective coöperative organisation. The Stock\r\nAssociation, with its 'round-ups' and its occasional resort to the\r\nSupreme Court of Judge Lynch, were an adequate substitute for the title\r\ndeeds to the lands, and for fences horse-high, bull-strong and\r\nhog-tight. But then we were in the Arid Belt and the frontier-pioneer\r\nstage; we had no politics and no politicians. I must return, however, to\r\nthe less exciting, but I suppose more important, life of the regular\r\nfarmer, and consider his efforts at organisation.\r\n\r\nInstances can be multiplied where the coöperative system has been\r\nadopted with immensely beneficial results; but in too many cases it has\r\nbeen abandoned. On the other hand, Granges, Institutes, Clubs, Leagues,\r\nAlliances and a multitude of miscellaneous farmers' associations have\r\nbeen organised for social, religious, political and economic objects.\r\nFrom my study of the work done by these bodies, the impression left is\r\nthat almost everything that can be done better by working together than\r\nby working separately has been at some time the subject of organised\r\neffort. But these manifestations of activity have been fitful and\r\nsporadic. They were commonly marked by some or all of the same\r\ndefects--mutual distrust, divided counsels, ignorance of what others\r\nwere doing, want of continuity and impatience of results. Many\r\norganisations, after winning some advantages,--over the railroads for\r\ninstance,--fell into abeyance or even out of existence; others lapsed\r\nunder the enervating influence of a little temporary prosperity, such as\r\na few years of better prices. The truth is, American farmers have had\r\nthe will to organise, but they have missed the way.[7]\r\n\r\nThe political influence of the farming community has for this reason\r\nnever been commensurate either with the numerical strength of its\r\nmembers or the magnitude of their share in the nation's work. It is\r\ntrue that the Federal Department of Agriculture, appropriations for\r\nAgricultural Colleges, some railway legislation and other boons to\r\nfarmers, are to be attributed to the efforts of their organisations.\r\nYet, as compared with the influence exercised upon National affairs by\r\nthe farmers of, say, France and Denmark, the American farmer has but a\r\nsmall influence upon legislation and administration affecting his\r\ninterests. What better proof of this could be given than the absence of\r\na Parcels Post in the United States? The whole farming community are\r\nagreed as to the need for this boon to the dwellers of the open country,\r\nand yet they have not succeeded in winning it against the opposition of\r\nthe Express Companies, because it is merely a farmers' and not a\r\ntownsmen's grievance. And not only political impotence, but political\r\ninertia, result from the lack of organisation. The state of the country\r\nroads--one of the greatest disabilities under which country life in the\r\nUnited States still suffers--is as good an instance as I know. Congress\r\nhas shown itself well disposed towards the farmer, but not always so the\r\nState governments, and the good intentions of Congress on the roads\r\nquestion are largely nullified owing to the failure of one-third of the\r\nStates to establish highway commissions, or make other provision for\r\nexpending such amounts as might be voted to them by Congress. Here, as\r\nin the cases of the transit and marketing problems, we see the need for\r\na strong, central, permanent organisation, fitted alike to direct local\r\nor promote National action; an association capable of securing the\r\nlegislative protection of the farmer's interests, and an organisation\r\nfitted to further the business side of his industry. In fact, this need\r\nis urgent, and a coöperative movement of National dimensions should be\r\nestablished to meet it. Had such a movement been started after the War,\r\nor even twenty years later, the American farmer would be in a far\r\nstronger position to-day, and much misdirected effort would have been\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nI have now tried to explain the weak spot in American rural economy. It\r\nmay be regarded from a more general point of view. If we were\r\nconsidering the life of some commercial or industrial community and\r\ntrying to forecast its future development, one of the first things we\r\nshould note would be its general business methods. No manufacturing\r\nconcern with a defective office administration and incompetent\r\ntravellers could survive, even if it had an Archimedes or an Edison in\r\nsupreme control. I cannot see any reason why an agricultural community\r\nshould expect to prosper while the industry by which its members live\r\nretains its present business organisation. I have urged that as things\r\nare, the farming interest is at a fatal disadvantage in the purchase of\r\nagricultural requirements, in the sale of agricultural produce, and in\r\nobtaining proper credit facilities. Whatever the cause--and I have set\r\ndown those which I regard as the chief among them--American farmers have\r\nstill to learn that they are subject to a law of modern business which\r\ngoverns all their country's industrial activities--the law that each\r\nbody of workers engaged in supplying the modern market must combine, or\r\nbe worsted at every turn in competition with those who do.\r\n\r\nI do not much fear that this general principle, overlooked, perhaps,\r\nbecause it was too obvious to be worth enforcing, will be disputed. I\r\nhope I may gain acceptance for my further contention that the inability\r\nof American farmers to sustain an effective business organisation has\r\nbeen due simply to the fact that the not obvious distinction between the\r\ncapitalistic and the coöperative basis of combination suitable to town\r\nand country respectively was missed. For it will then be clear why, in\r\nthe working out of Mr. Roosevelt's formula, better business must precede\r\nand form the basis of better farming and better living. The conviction\r\nthat in this general procedure lies the one hope of solving the problem\r\nunder review accounts for the otherwise disproportionate space given to\r\nthat aspect of rural life which is of the least interest to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nI shall now attempt to determine the principles which must be applied to\r\nthe solution of our problem. Those who have followed the arguments up to\r\nthis point will have a pretty clear idea of the general drift of my\r\nconclusions. The substitution in rural economy of the coöperative for\r\nthe competitive principle, which I have so far advocated as a matter of\r\nbusiness prudence, will be seen to have a wider import. This course will\r\nbe shown to have an important bearing upon the application of the new\r\nknowledge to the oldest industry and also upon the building of a new\r\nrural civilisation we must provide for the dwellers of the open country\r\na larger share of the intellectual and social pleasures for the want of\r\nwhich those most needed in the country are too often drawn to the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] I should expect the negroes in the Southern States to be very good\r\nsubjects for agricultural organisation. I have discussed this question\r\nwith the staff of the Hampton Institute in Virginia--a fine body of men,\r\ndoing noble work. The Principal, the Rev. H. B. Frissell, D.D., whose\r\njudgment in this matter is probably the weightiest in the United States,\r\nand his leading assistants, both white and coloured, are of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n[5] Where capital is, in rare instances, subscribed by persons other\r\nthan farmers, it is usually invested less as a commercial speculation\r\nthan as an act of friendship on the part of the investor, who in no case\r\nexercises more control than his one vote affords.\r\n\r\n[6] Readers who are sufficiently interested in the rural life movement\r\nin Ireland will find a full description of it in my book, \"Ireland in\r\nthe New Century,\" John Murray, London, and E. P. Dutton, New York.\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. John Lee Coulter contributed to the _Yale Review_ for November,\r\n1909, an article on Organization among the farmers of the United States\r\nwhich is a most valuable summary of the important facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WAY TO BETTER FARMING AND BETTER LIVING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no way is the contrast between rural and urban civilisation more\r\nmarked than in the application of the teachings of modern science to\r\ntheir respective industries. Even the most important mechanical\r\ninventions were rather forced upon the farmer by the efficient selling\r\norganisation of the city manufacturers than demanded by him as a result\r\nof good instruction in farming. On the mammoth wheat farms, where, as\r\nthe fable ran, the plough that started out one morning returned on the\r\nadjoining furrow the following day, mechanical science was indeed called\r\nin, but only to perpetrate the greatest soil robbery in agricultural\r\nhistory. Application of science to legitimate agriculture is\r\ncomparatively new. In my ranching and farming days I well remember how\r\ngeneral was the disbelief in its practical value throughout the Middle\r\nand Far West. In cowboy terminology, all scientists were classified as\r\n\"bug-hunters,\" and farmers generally had no use for the theorist. The\r\nnon-agricultural community had naturally no higher appreciation of the\r\nfarmer's calling than he himself displayed. When some Universities first\r\ndeveloped agricultural courses, the students who entered for them were\r\nnicknamed \"aggies,\" and were not regarded as adding much to the dignity\r\nof a seat of higher learning. The Department of Agriculture was looked\r\nupon as a source of jobs, graft being the nearest approach to any known\r\nagricultural operation.\r\n\r\nAll this is changing fast. The Federal Department of Agriculture is now\r\nperhaps the most popular and respected of the world's great\r\nadministrative institutions. In the Middle West, a newly awakened\r\npublic opinion has set up an honourable rivalry between such States as\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Minnesota, in developing the\r\nagricultural sides of their Universities and Colleges. None the less,\r\nMr. James J. Hill has recently given it as his opinion that not more\r\nthan one per cent of the farmers of these regions are working in direct\r\ntouch with any educational institution. It is probable that this\r\nestimate leaves out of account the indirect influence of the vast amount\r\nof extension work and itinerant instruction which is embraced in the\r\nactivities of the Universities and Colleges. I fear it cannot be denied\r\nthat in the application of the natural sciences to the practical, and of\r\neconomic science to the business of farming, the country folk are\r\ndecades behind their urban fellow-citizens. And again I say the\r\ndisparity is to be attributed to the difference in their respective\r\ndegrees of organisation for business purposes.\r\n\r\nThe relation between business organisation and economic progress ought,\r\nI submit, to be very seriously considered by the social workers who\r\nperceive that progress is mainly a question of education. Speaking from\r\nadministrative experience at home, and from a good deal of interested\r\nobservation in America, I am firmly convinced that the new rural\r\neducation is badly handicapped by the lack of organised bodies of\r\nfarmers to act as channels for the new knowledge now made available. In\r\nsome instances, I am aware, great good has been done by the formation of\r\nfarmers' institutes which have been established in order to interest\r\nrural communities in educational work and to make the local arrangements\r\nfor instruction by lectures, demonstrations and otherwise. But all\r\nEuropean experience proves the superiority for this purpose of the\r\nbusiness association to the organisation _ad hoc_, and has a much better\r\nchance of permanence.\r\n\r\nAgain, the influence upon rural life of the agricultural teaching of the\r\nColleges and Universities, as exercised by their pupils, may be too\r\neasily accepted as being of greater potential utility than any work\r\nwhich these institutions can do amongst adults. This is a mistake. The\r\nthousands of young men who are now being trained for advanced farming\r\ntoo often have to restrict the practical application of their theoretic\r\nknowledge to the home circle, which is not always responsive, for a man\r\nis not usually a prophet in his own family. It is here that the\r\neducational value of coöperative societies comes in; they act as\r\nagencies through which scientific teaching may become actual practice,\r\nnot in the uncertain future, but in the living present. A coöperative\r\nassociation has a quality which should commend it to the social\r\nreformer--the power of evoking character; it brings to the front a new\r\ntype of local leader, not the best talker, but the man whose knowledge\r\nenables him to make some solid contribution to the welfare of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI come now to the last part of the threefold scheme--that which aims at\r\na better life upon the farm. The coöperative association, in virtue of\r\nits non-capitalistic basis of constitution and procedure (which, as I\r\nhave explained, distinguishes it from the Joint Stock Company), demands\r\nas a condition of its business success the exercise of certain social\r\nqualities of inestimable value to the community life. It is for this\r\nreason, no doubt, that where men and women have learned to work together\r\nunder this system in the business of their lives, they are easily\r\ninduced to use their organisation for social and intellectual purposes\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe new organisation of the rural community for social as well as\r\neconomic purposes, which should follow from the acceptance of the\r\nopinion I have advanced, would bring with it the first effective\r\ncounter-attraction to the towns. Their material advantages the country\r\ncannot hope to rival; nor can any conceivable evolution of rural life\r\nfurnish a real counterpart to the cheap and garish entertainments of\r\nthe modern city. Take, for example, the extravagant use of electric\r\nlight for purposes of advertisement, which affords a nightly display of\r\nfireworks in any active business street of an American city far superior\r\nto the occasional exhibition at the Crystal Palace in London, which was\r\nthe rare treat of my childhood days. These delights--if such they\r\nbe--cannot be extended into remote villages in Kansas or Nebraska; but\r\ntheir enchantment must be reckoned with by those who would remould the\r\nlife of the open country and make it morally and mentally satisfying to\r\nthose who are born to it, or who, but for its social stagnation, would\r\nprefer a rural to an urban existence.\r\n\r\nIn one of his many public references to country life, President\r\nRoosevelt attributed the rural exodus to the desire of \"the more active\r\nand restless young men and women\" to escape from \"loneliness and lack of\r\nmental companionship.\"[8] He is hopeful that the rural free delivery,\r\nthe telephone, the bicycle and the trolley will do much towards\r\n\"lessening the isolation of farm life and making it brighter and more\r\nattractive.\" Many to whom I have spoken on this subject fear that the\r\nlinking of the country with the town by these applications of modern\r\nscience may, to some extent, operate in a direction the opposite of that\r\nwhich Mr. Roosevelt anticipates and desires. According to this view, the\r\nmore intimate knowledge of the modern city may increase the desire to be\r\nin personal touch with it; the telephone may fail to give through the\r\near the satisfaction which is demanded by the eye; among the \"more\r\nactive and restless young men and women\" the rural free delivery may\r\ncirculate the dime novel and the trolley make accessible the dime\r\nmuseum. In the total result the occasional visit may become more and\r\nmore frequent, until the duties of country life are first neglected and\r\nthen abandoned.\r\n\r\nI do not feel competent to decide between these two views, but I offer\r\none consideration with which I think many rural reformers will agree.\r\nThe attempt to bring the advantages of the city within the reach of the\r\ndwellers in the country cannot, of itself, counteract the townward\r\ntendency in so far as it is due to the causes summarised above. However\r\nrapidly, in this respect, the country may be improved, the city is sure\r\nto advance more rapidly and the gap between them to be widened. The new\r\nrural civilisation should aim at trying to develop in the country the\r\nthings of the country, the very existence of which seems to have been\r\nforgotten. But, after all, it is the world within us rather than the\r\nworld without us that matters in the making of society, and I must give\r\nto the social influence of the coöperative idea what I believe to be its\r\nreal importance.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, from which so much of my experience is drawn, we have found\r\na tendency growing among farmers whose combinations are successful, to\r\ngather into one strong local association all those varied objects and\r\nactivities which I have described as advocated by the Irish Agricultural\r\nOrganisation Society. These local associations are ceasing to have one\r\nspecial purpose or one object only. They absorb more and more of the\r\nbusiness of the district. One large, well-organised institution is being\r\nsubstituted for the numerous petty transactions of farmers with\r\nmiddlemen and small country traders. Gradually the Society becomes the\r\nmost important institution in the district, the most important in a\r\nsocial as well as in an economic sense. The members feel a pride in its\r\nmaterial expansion. They accumulate large profits, which in time become\r\na kind of communal fund. In some cases this is used for the erection of\r\nvillage halls where social entertainments, concerts and dances are held,\r\nlectures delivered and libraries stored. Finally, the association\r\nassumes the character of a rural commune, where, instead of the old\r\nbasis of the commune, the joint ownership of land, a new basis for union\r\nis found in the voluntary communism of effort.\r\n\r\nA true social organism is thus being created with common human and\r\neconomic interests, and the clan feeling, which was so powerful an\r\ninfluence in early and mediæval civilisations, with all its power of\r\ngenerating passionate loyalties, is born anew in the modern world. Our\r\nancient Irish records show little clans with a common ownership of land\r\nhardly larger than a parish, but with all the patriotic feeling of large\r\nnations held with an intensity rare in our modern states. The history of\r\nthese clans and of very small nations like the ancient Greek states\r\nshows that the social feeling assumes its most binding and powerful\r\ncharacter where the community is large enough to allow free play to the\r\nvarious interests of human life, but is not so large that it becomes an\r\nabstraction to the imagination. Most of us feel no greater thrill in\r\nbeing one of a State with fifty million inhabitants than we do in\r\nrecognising we are citizens of the solar system. The rural commune and\r\nthe very small States exhibit the feeling of human solidarity in its\r\nmost intense manifestations, working on itself, regenerating itself and\r\nseeking its own perfection. Combinations of agriculturists, when the\r\nrural organisation is complete, re-create in a new way the conditions\r\nwhere these social instincts germinate best, and it is only by this\r\ncomplete organisation of rural life that we can hope to build up a rural\r\ncivilisation, and create those counter-attractions to urban life which\r\nwill stay the exodus from the land.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to exaggerate the interest which the rural life of my own\r\nlittle island may have for those who are concerned for the vast and\r\nwealthy expanses of the American farm lands. But, even here there is a\r\ngenuine desire for the really simple life, which in its commonest\r\nmanifestation is a thing that rather simple people talk about. In a\r\nproperly organised rural neighbourhood could be developed that higher\r\nkind of attraction which is suggested by the very word _neighbourhood_.\r\nOnce get the farmers and their families all working together at\r\nsomething that concerns them all, and we have the beginning of a more\r\nstable and a more social community than is likely to exist amid the\r\nconstant change and bustle of the large towns, where indeed some\r\nthinkers tell us that not only the family, but also the social life, is\r\nbadly breaking down. When people are really interested in each\r\nother--and this interest comes of habitually working together--the\r\nsmallest personal traits or events affecting one are of interest to all.\r\nThe simplest piece of amateur acting or singing, done in the village\r\nhall by one of the villagers, will arouse more criticism and more\r\nenthusiasm among his friends and neighbours than can be excited by the\r\nmost consummate performance of a professional in a great city theatre,\r\nwhere no one in the audience knows or cares for the performer.\r\n\r\nBut if this attraction--the attraction of common work and social\r\nintercourse with a circle of friends--is to prevail in the long run over\r\nthe lure which the city offers to eye and ear and pocket, there must be\r\na change in rural education. At present country children are educated as\r\nif for the purpose of driving them into the towns. To the pleasure which\r\nthe cultured city man feels in the country--because he has been taught\r\nto feel it--the country child is insensible. The country offers\r\ncontinual interest to the mind which has been trained to be thoughtful\r\nand observant; the town offers continual distraction to the vacant eye\r\nand brain. Yet, the education given to country children has been\r\ninvented for them in the town, and it not only bears no relation to the\r\nlife they are to lead, but actually attracts them towards a town career.\r\nI am aware that I am here on ground where angels--even if specialised in\r\npedagogy--may well fear to tread. Upon the principles of a sound\r\nagricultural education pedagogues are in a normally violent state of\r\ndisagreement with each other. But whatever compromise between general\r\neducation and technical instruction be adopted, the resulting reform\r\nthat is needed has two sides. We want two changes in the rural\r\nmind--beginning with the rural teacher's mind. First, the interest which\r\nthe physical environment of the farmer provides to followers of almost\r\nevery branch of science must be communicated to the agricultural classes\r\naccording to their capacities. Second, that intimacy with and affection\r\nfor nature, to which Wordsworth has given the highest expression, must\r\nin some way be engendered in the rural mind. In this way alone will the\r\ncountryman come to realize the beauty of the life around him, as through\r\nthe teaching of science he will learn to realise its truth.\r\n\r\nUpon this reformed education, as a basis, the rural economy must be\r\nbuilt. It must, if my view be accepted, ensure, first and foremost, the\r\ncombination of farmers for business purposes in such a manner as will\r\nenable them to control their own marketing and make use of the many\r\nadvantages which a command of capital gives. In all European\r\ncountries--with the exception of the British Isles--statesmen have\r\nrecognised the national necessity for the good business organisation of\r\nthe farmer. In some cases, for example France, even Government officials\r\nexpound the coöperative principle. In Denmark, the most predominantly\r\nrural country in Europe, the education both in the common and in the\r\nhigh school has long been so admirably related to the working lives of\r\nthe agricultural classes that the people adopt spontaneously the methods\r\nof organisation which the commercial instinct they have acquired through\r\neducation tells them to be suitable to the conditions. The rural\r\nreformer knows that this is the better way; but our problem is not\r\nmerely the education of a rising, but the development of a grown-up\r\ngeneration. We cannot wait for the slow process of education to produce\r\nits effect upon the mind of the rural youth, even if there were any way\r\nof ensuring their proper training for a progressive rural life without\r\nfirst giving to their parents such education as they can assimilate.\r\nDirect action is called for; we have to work with adult farmers and\r\ninduce them to reorganise their business upon the lines which I have\r\nattempted to define. Moreover, this is essential to the future success\r\nof the work done in the schools, in order that the trained mind of youth\r\nmay not afterwards find itself baulked by the ignorant apathy or lazy\r\nconservatism of its elders.\r\n\r\nI hold, then, that the new economy will mean a more scientific mastery\r\nof the technical side of farming, for farmers will make a much larger\r\nuse of the advice, instruction and help which the Nation and the States\r\noffer them through the Department of Agriculture and the Colleges. It is\r\nequally certain that there will arise a more human social life in the\r\nrural districts, based upon the greater share of the products of the\r\nfarmer's industry, which the new business organisation will enable him\r\nto retain; stimulated by the closer business relations with his fellows\r\nwhich that organisation will bring about, and fostered by the closer\r\nneighbourhood which is implied in a more intensive cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe development of a more intensive cultivation must carry with it a\r\nmuch more careful consideration of the labour problem. The difficulty of\r\ngetting and keeping labour on the farm is a commonplace. I think farmers\r\nhave not faced the fact that this difficulty is due in the main to their\r\nown way of doing their business. Competent men will not stay at farm\r\nlabour unless it offers them continuous employment as part of a\r\nwell-ordered business concern; and this is not possible unless with a\r\ngreatly improved husbandry.\r\n\r\nTo-day agriculture has to compete in the labour market against other,\r\nand to many men more attractive, industries, and a marked elevation in\r\nthe whole standard of life in the rural world is the best insurance of a\r\nbetter supply of good farm labour. Only an intensive system of farming\r\ncan afford any large amount of permanent employment at decent wages to\r\nthe rural labourer, and only a good supply of competent labour can\r\nrender intensive farming on any large scale practicable. But the\r\nintensive system of farming not only gives regular employment and good\r\nwages; it also fits the labourer of to-day--in a country where a man can\r\nstrike out for himself--to be the successful farmer of to-morrow. Nor,\r\nin these days of impersonal industrial relations, should the fact be\r\noverlooked that under an intensive system of agriculture, we find still\r\npreserved the kindly personal relation between employer and employed\r\nwhich contributes both to the pleasantness of life and to economic\r\nprogress and security.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in a country where advanced farming is the rule, there is a\r\nremarkable, and, from the standpoint of national stability, most\r\nvaluable, steadiness in employment. Good farming, by fixing the labourer\r\non the soil, improves the general condition of rural life, by ridding\r\nthe countryside of the worst of its present pests. Those wandering\r\ndervishes of the industrial world, the hobo, the tramp--the entire\r\nfamily of Weary Willies and Tired Timothys--will no longer have even an\r\nimaginary excuse for their troubled and troublesome existence. But the\r\nfarmer who was the prey of these pests must, if he would be permanently\r\nrid of them, learn to respect his hired farm hand. He must provide him\r\nwith a comfortable cottage and a modest garden plot upon which his young\r\nfamily may employ themselves; otherwise, whatever the farmer may do to\r\nattract labour, he will never retain it. In short, the labourer, too,\r\nmust get his full and fair share of the prosperity of the coming good\r\ntime in the country.\r\n\r\nThere is one particular aspect of this improved social life which is so\r\nimportant that it ought properly to form the subject of a separate\r\nessay; I mean the position of women in rural life. In no country in the\r\nworld is the general position of woman better, or her influence greater,\r\nthan in the United States. But while woman has played a great part there\r\nin the social life and economic development of the town, I hold that the\r\npart she is destined to play in the future making of the country will be\r\neven greater.\r\n\r\nIn the more intelligent scheme of the new country life, the economic\r\nposition of woman is likely to be one of high importance. She enters\r\nlargely into all three parts of our programme,--better farming, better\r\nbusiness, better living. In the development of higher farming, for\r\ninstance, she is better fitted than the more muscular but less patient\r\nanimal, man, to carry on with care that work of milk records, egg\r\nrecords, etc., which underlies the selection on scientific lines of the\r\nmore productive strains of cattle and poultry. And this kind of work is\r\nwanted in the study not only of animal, but also of plant life.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the sphere of better business, the housekeeping faculty of\r\nwoman is an important asset, since a good system of farm accounts is one\r\nof the most valuable aids to successful farming. But it is, of course,\r\nin the third part of the programme,--better living,--that woman's\r\ngreatest opportunity lies. The woman makes the home life of the Nation.\r\nBut she desires also social life, and where she has the chance she\r\ndevelops it. Here it is that the establishment of the coöperative\r\nsociety, or union, gives an opening and a range of conditions in which\r\nthe social usefulness of woman makes itself quickly felt. I do not think\r\nthat I am laying too much stress on this matter, because the pleasures,\r\nthe interests and the duties of society, properly so called,--that is,\r\nthe state of living on friendly terms with our neighbours,--are always\r\nmore central and important in the life of a woman than of a man. The\r\nman needs them, too, for without them he becomes a mere machine for\r\nmaking money; but the woman, deprived of them, tends to become a mere\r\ndrudge. The new rural social economy (which implies a denser population\r\noccupying smaller holdings) must therefore include a generous provision\r\nfor all those forms of social intercourse which specially appeal to\r\nwomen. The Women's Sections of the Granges have done a great deal of\r\nuseful work in this direction; we need a more general and complete\r\napplication of the principles on which they act.\r\n\r\nI have now stated the broad principles which must govern any effective\r\nscheme for correcting the present harmful subordination of rural life to\r\na civilisation too exclusively urban. Before I bring forward my definite\r\nproposal for a remedy calculated to meet the needs of the situation, I\r\nmust anticipate a line of criticism which may occur to the mind of any\r\nsocial worker who does not happen to be very familiar with the\r\nconditions of country life.\r\n\r\nI can well imagine readers who have patiently followed my arguments\r\nwishing to interrogate me in some such terms as these: \"Assuming,\" they\r\nmay say, \"that we accept all you tell us about the neglect of the rural\r\npopulation, and agree as to the grave consequences which must follow if\r\nit be continued, what on earth can we do? Of course the welfare of the\r\nrural population is a matter of paramount importance to the city and to\r\nthe nation at large; but may we remind you that you said the evil and\r\nthe consequences can be removed and averted only by those immediately\r\nconcerned--the actual farmers--and that the remedy for the rural\r\nbackwardness was to be sought for in the rural mind? 'Canst thou\r\nminister to a mind diseased?' Must not the patient 'minister' to\r\nhimself?\"\r\n\r\nFair questions these, and altogether to the point. I answer at once that\r\nthe patient ought to minister to himself, but he won't. He has acquired\r\nthe habit of sending for the physician of the town, whose physic but\r\naggravates the disease. Dropping metaphor, the farmer does not think for\r\nhimself. In rural communities, there is as great a lack of collective\r\nthought as of coöperative action. All progress is conditional on public\r\nopinion, and this, even in the country, is a very much town-made thing.\r\n\r\nSo I am, then, in this difficulty. My subject is rural, my audience\r\nurban. I have to commend to the statesmen and the philanthropists of the\r\ntown the somewhat incongruous proposal that they should take the\r\ninitiative in rural reform. Neither the thought nor the influence which\r\ncan set in motion what in agricultural communities is no less than an\r\neconomic revolution are to be found in the open country. To the townsmen\r\nI now address my appeal and submit a plan.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] Message to the Fifty-eighth Congress (1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TWO THINGS NEEDFUL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my earlier chapters I traced to the Industrial Revolution in England\r\nthe origin of that subordination, in the English-speaking countries, of\r\nrural to urban interests which finds its expression to-day in the\r\nproblem of rural life. I have shown that the continuance of the tendency\r\nin America was natural if not inevitable, and have urged that, for\r\neconomic, social and political reasons, its further progress should now\r\nbe stayed. If my view as to the origin, present effects and probable\r\nconsequences of the evil be accepted, any serious proposals for a remedy\r\nwill be welcomed by all who realise that national well-being cannot\r\nendure if urban prosperity is accompanied by rural decay. In this belief\r\nI offer the scheme for a Country Life movement which has slowly matured\r\nin my own mind as the result of the experience described in the\r\npreceding pages.\r\n\r\nThe first aim of the movement should be to coördinate, and guide towards\r\na common end, the efforts of a large number of agencies--educational,\r\nreligious, social and philanthropic--which, in their several ways, are\r\nalready engaged upon some part of the work to be done. For such a\r\nmovement the United States offers advantages not to be found elsewhere\r\nin the area for which we are concerned. For here public-spirited\r\nindividuals and associations of the kind required exist in larger\r\nnumbers than can be known to any one who has not watched what is going\r\non in this field of social service. If I had not already devoted too\r\nmuch space to personal experiences, I could of my own knowledge testify\r\nto the remarkable growth of organised effort in American rural\r\ncommunities. Sometimes this is the outcome of a growing spirit of\r\nneighbourliness, sometimes it emanates from young Universities and\r\nColleges emulating the extension work with which nearly every big city\r\nis familiar. I have been much struck with the way in which, at\r\ngatherings of school teachers, pedagogic detail and questions affecting\r\ntheir status and emoluments have become less popular subjects for\r\ndiscussion than schemes of social progress.[9] Similarly, the\r\nagricultural Press is becoming less exclusively technical and\r\ncommercial, and more human. Even the syndicated stuff is getting less\r\ntownified. My correspondence, newspaper clippings sent to me, and many\r\nother indications, point in the same direction. They leave the\r\nimpression upon my mind that there is a vast, efficient and enthusiastic\r\narmy of social workers upon the farm lands of the United States badly in\r\nneed of a Headquarters Staff.\r\n\r\nIf I am right in believing that, of the English-speaking countries, the\r\nUnited States affords the best opportunity for such a consummation, most\r\nassuredly the present time is peculiarly auspicious. If Mr. Roosevelt's\r\nCountry Life policy has not been received with any marked enthusiasm,\r\nAmerican public opinion has been thoroughly aroused upon his\r\nConservation policy. The latter cannot possibly come to fruition--nor\r\neven go much further--until the Country Life problem is boldly faced. In\r\nthe Conference of Governors it was pointed out over and over again that\r\nthe farmer, now the chief waster, must become the chief conserver. As\r\nsuch he will himself become a supporter of the policy, and will bring to\r\nthe aid of those advocates of Conservation whose chief concern is for\r\nfuture generations, an interested public opinion which will go far to\r\noutweigh the influence of those who profit by the exhaustion of natural\r\nresources. To the country life reformer I would say that, as the one\r\nidea has caught on while the other lags, he will, if he is wise, hitch\r\nhis Country Life waggon to the Conservation star.\r\n\r\nWith every advantage of time and place, the promotion of the movement\r\nwhich is to counteract the townward tendency will have to reckon with\r\nthe psychological difficulty inherent in the conditions. They must\r\nrecognise the paradox of the situation already pointed out, the\r\nnecessity of interesting the town in the problems of the country. The\r\nurban attitude of mind which caused the evil, and now makes it difficult\r\nto interest public opinion in the remedy, is not new; it pervades the\r\nliterature of the Augustan age. I recall from my school days Virgil's\r\ngreat handbook on Italian agriculture, written with a mastery of\r\ntechnical detail unsurpassed by Kipling. But the farmers he had in mind\r\nwhen he indulged in his memorable rhapsody upon the happiness of their\r\nlot were out for pleasure rather than profit. While the suburban poet\r\nsang to the merchant princes, Rome was paying a bonus upon imported\r\ncorn, and entering generally upon that fatal disregard for the interest\r\nof the rural population which is one of the accepted causes of the\r\ndecline and fall.\r\n\r\nHow that Old World tragi-comedy comes back to me when I talk to New York\r\nfriends on the subject of these pages! I am not, so they tell me, up to\r\ndate in my information; there is a marked revulsion of feeling upon the\r\ntown _versus_ country question; the tide of the rural exodus has really\r\nturned, as I might have discerned without going far afield. At many a\r\nLong Island home I might see on Sundays, weather permitting, the\r\nhorny-handed son of week-day toil in Wall Street, rustically attired,\r\ninspecting his Jersey cows and aristocratic fowls. These supply a select\r\ncircle in New York with butter and eggs, at a price which leaves nothing\r\nto be desired--unless it be some information as to the cost of\r\nproduction. Full justice is done to the new country life when the\r\nFarmers' Club of New York fulfils its chief function, the annual dinner\r\nat Delmonico's. Then agriculture is extolled in fine Virgilian style,\r\nthe Hudson villa and the Newport 'cottage' being permitted to divide the\r\nhonours of the rural revival with the Long Island home. But to my\r\nbucolic intelligence, it would seem that against the 'back to the land'\r\nmovement of Saturday afternoon the captious critic might set the rural\r\nexodus of Monday morning.\r\n\r\nThese reflections are introduced in no unfriendly spirit, and with\r\nserious intent. To me this new rural life is associated with memories of\r\ncharacteristically American hospitality; but my interest in it is more\r\nthan personal. It is giving to those who cultivate it, among whom are\r\nthe helpers most needed at the moment, a point of view which will enable\r\nthem to grasp the real problem of the open country, as it exists, for\r\nexample, in the great food-producing and cotton-growing tracts of the\r\nWest and South. Both in the countries where the townward tendency of\r\nthe industrial age was foreseen and prevented, and in those in which the\r\nevil is being cured, the impulse and inspiration which will be required\r\nto initiate and sustain our Country Life movement came mainly from\r\nleaders who were not themselves agriculturists.[10] Proficiency in the\r\npractice or even in the business of farming is not necessary. What is\r\nneeded is a comprehensive knowledge of public affairs, political\r\nimagination, an understanding sympathy with and a philosophic insight\r\ninto the entire life of communities. Men who combine with the necessary\r\nexperience those gifts of heart and mind which go to make the higher\r\ncitizenship in the many, and the statesmanship in the few, will more\r\nlikely be found in the city than in the country. Yet they are, in the\r\nconditions, the natural leaders of the Country Life movement, which must\r\nnow be defined.\r\n\r\nThe situation demands two things; on the one hand an association,\r\npopular, propagandist, organising; on the other, an Institute,\r\nscientific, philosophic, research-making. These two things are distinct\r\nin character, but they are complementary to each other. One will require\r\npopular enthusiasm and business organisation. To the service of the\r\nother must be brought the patient spirit of scientific and philosophic\r\nanalysis and inquiry. These two bodies--the popular propagandist\r\nassociation and the scientific research-making Institute--must,\r\ntherefore, be created; and, for a reason to be explained when we\r\nconsider the work of the Institute, they should be independent of each\r\nother. This rough indication of the character of the work, which I will\r\ndescribe more in detail presently, will suffice for the moment. I feel\r\nthat the work will be so intensely human in its interest that it will be\r\nwell to say at once how the two central agencies can be established, and\r\nthe movement made, not a writer's fancy, but a living and doing agency\r\nof human progress.\r\n\r\nA body, in many respects ideally fitted to give the necessary impulse\r\nand direction to the work of organisation, is already in the field. The\r\nleaders of the Conservation idea, recognising that their policy, in\r\ncommon with other policies, will need an organised public opinion at its\r\nback, have founded a National Conservation Association. Mr. Gifford\r\nPinchot has now been selected as its President. Before he was available,\r\nthe task of organising and setting to work the new institution was\r\nunanimously entrusted to and accepted by President Eliot, of whose\r\nqualifications all I will say is that we foreign students of social\r\nproblems vie with his own countrymen in our appreciation of his public\r\nwork and aims. These two appointments are sufficient proof of the\r\nserious importance of the work, and bespeak public influence and support\r\nfor the Association. I have no doubt that this body would be fully\r\nqualified to formulate and initiate the Country Life movement, and act\r\nas the central agency for the active promotion of its objects. Its\r\nmembers, who, I am sure, agree with Mr. Roosevelt in regarding the\r\nmovement as a necessary complement to the Conservation policy, might\r\neven feel that for this very reason it was incumbent upon them to set\r\ntheir organisation to this work.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one consideration which will make Mr. Pinchot and his\r\nassociates hesitate to adopt this course. The doubt relates to the\r\ndistinction I have drawn between the Conservation policy and the Country\r\nLife movement, the one seeking to promote legislative and administrative\r\naction, and the other, while it may give birth to a policy, being\r\nchiefly concerned with voluntary effort.[11] Although the National\r\nConservation Association is founded for the purpose of educating public\r\nopinion upon the Conservation idea, it may decide to support the\r\nConservation policy of one party rather than that of another. It would\r\nthus become too much involved in party controversy to act as a central\r\nagency of a movement which must embrace men of all parties. Should this\r\nview prevail, the difficulty can be easily surmounted by following the\r\nIrish precedent, where we had a very similar and indeed far more\r\ndelicate situation to save from political trouble. An American\r\nAgricultural Organisation Society could be founded for the purpose in\r\nview, and as it is probable that leading advocates of the Conservation\r\npolicy would take a prominent part in the Country Life movement, the\r\ninterdependence of the two ideas would have practical recognition.\r\n\r\nApart from the possibility of political complications, there is one\r\nstrong reason to recommend this course. The movement will accomplish its\r\nbest and most permanent results as an advocate of self-reliance; it will\r\nseek to make self-help effective through organisation; it will concern\r\nitself much more for those things which the farmers can do for\r\nthemselves by coöperation than with those things which the Government\r\ncan do for them.[12] The selection, however, between the two alternative\r\ncourses is a question which the foreign critic cannot decide. The work\r\nto which I now return will be the same, whatever agency is charged with\r\nits execution.\r\n\r\nThe central body (which for brevity I will call the Association) will\r\nhave as its general aim the economic and social development of rural\r\ncommunities. The work will be mainly that of active organisation. For\r\nreasons explained in the earlier chapters, the organisation must be\r\ncoöperative in character, and will be concentrated upon the business\r\nmethods of the farmers. This will, it is believed, cure a radical defect\r\nin their system--a defect which, as I have argued, is responsible for a\r\nrestricted production, and for a course of distribution injurious alike\r\nto producer and consumer, besides exercising a depressing influence upon\r\nthe economic efficiency and social life of rural communities. It follows\r\nthat the first step towards a general reconstruction of country life,\r\nwhich has the promise of giving to the country a social attraction\r\nstrong enough to stem the tide of the townward migration, is\r\nagricultural coöperation.\r\n\r\nSuch being the general aim and the definite procedure, the first\r\npractical question that arises will be, how to apply this\r\nsolvent--agricultural coöperation. It will not suffice to throw these\r\ntwo long words at the hardy rustic; shorter and more emphatic words\r\nmight come back. Two equally necessary things must be done; the\r\nprinciple must be made clear, and the practical details of this rural\r\nequivalent of urban business combination must be explained in language\r\nunderstanded of the people. It is not difficult to draft a paper scheme\r\nfor this purpose, but the fitting of the plan to local conditions is a\r\nvery expert business. Hence the central agency should have at its\r\ndisposal a corps of experts in coöperative organisation for agricultural\r\npurposes. After a short visit to a likely district by a competent\r\nexponent of the theory and practice, local volunteers would be found to\r\ncarry on the work. Experience shows that once a well-organised\r\ncoöperative association of farmers is permanently established, similar\r\nassociations spring up spontaneously under the magic influence of\r\nproved success in known conditions. I should strongly recommend\r\nconcentration at first on a few selected districts, with the aim of\r\nmaking standard models to which other communities could work. I need\r\nhardly say that all this work would be done in coöperation with whatever\r\nother agencies would lend their aid. The Country Life movement would be\r\nextremely useful to the great educational foundations centred in New\r\nYork. I happen to know that the Trustees of the Rockefeller, Carnegie\r\nand Russell Sage endowments are keenly desirous to promote such a\r\nredirection of rural education as will bring it into a more helpful\r\nrelation with the working lives of the rural population. Then there are\r\nsuch bodies as the Y. M. C. A., whose leaders, I am told, are alive to\r\nthe value of the open air life, and are anxious to extend their country\r\nwork in the rural districts. The great army of rural teachers, the\r\nFarmers' Union, and other farmers' organisations I have already named\r\nwould gladly coöperate with schemes making for rural progress.\r\n\r\nMore important, I believe, than is generally realised, from an economic\r\nand social point of view, are the rural churches. In many European\r\ncountries, where agricultural coöperation has played a great part in the\r\npeople's lives, the clergy have ardently supported the system on account\r\nof its moral value. In Ireland, some of our very best volunteer\r\norganisers are clergymen. Some leaders of the rural church in the United\r\nStates have told me that a feeling is growing that an increased economic\r\nusefulness in the clergy would strengthen their position in the society\r\nwhich they serve in a higher capacity. I know that the suggestion of\r\nclerical intervention in secular affairs is open to misunderstanding.\r\nBut here is a body of educated citizens who would gladly take part in\r\nany real social service; and here is a situation where there is work of\r\nhigh moral and social value calling for volunteers. Nothing but good,\r\nit seems to me, could result if such men, who have more opportunity and\r\ninclination for general reading than the working farmer, would help in\r\nexplaining the intricacies of coöperative organisation and procedure\r\nwhich must be understood and practised in order that the system may be\r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its active propagandist work, the central Association\r\ncould exercise a powerful and helpful influence in other ways. It\r\nshould, of course, keep both the agricultural and the general press\r\ninformed of its plans and progress. It should also keep in touch with\r\nthe agricultural work of all important educational bodies, and more\r\nespecially urge upon them the necessity of spreading the coöperative\r\nidea. The Department of Agriculture would welcome and support the\r\nmovement; for I know many leading men in that service who thoroughly\r\nunderstand and recognise the immense importance, especially to backward\r\nrural communities, of the coöperative principle.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, at this stage, to go further into details. I feel\r\nconfident that the work of assisting all suitable agencies, such as\r\nthose I have named, and others which may be available, through\r\norganisers of agricultural coöperation and by the spreading of\r\ninformation, would soon enable the central body to render inestimable\r\nservice to the cause of rural progress. Such, at any rate, is the\r\noutline of my first proposal for giving to my American fellow-workers\r\nupon the rural problem the assistance which I feel they most need at the\r\npresent moment. I pass now to my second proposal.\r\n\r\nI suggest that an institution--which, as I have said, will be\r\nscientific, philosophic, research-making--should be founded. It would\r\nbe, in effect, a Bureau of research in rural social economy. Personally\r\nI know that, in my own experience as an administrator and organiser, I\r\nhave been constantly brought face to face with problems where we could\r\nturn to no guide--no patient band of investigators who had been\r\nmeasuring, analysing, determining the data. Yet in some directions much\r\nexcellent work is being done. Every social worker knows how the\r\nknowledge of what others are doing will help him. It is strange how\r\nlittle the problems of the rural population have entered into the\r\nstudies of economists and sociologists. At leading Universities I have\r\nsought in vain for light. At a recent anniversary in New York, which\r\nbrought together the foremost economists of the Old and New World, there\r\nwas an almost complete omission of the country side of things from a\r\nprogramme which I am sure was generally held to be almost exhaustive.\r\nThe fact is, the subject must be treated as a new one, and it is\r\nurgently necessary, if the work of the Country Life movement is to be\r\nbased on a solid foundation of fact, to make good the deficiency of\r\ninformation which has resulted from the general lack of interest in the\r\nsubject under review. An Institute is wanted to survey the field, to\r\ncollect, classify and coördinate information and to supplement and carry\r\nforward the work of research and inquiry. The rural social worker\r\nrequires as far as possible to carry exact statistical method into his\r\nwork so that he may no longer have to depend on general statements, but\r\nmay have at his command evidence, the validity of which can be trusted,\r\nwhile its significance can be measured. I may mention a few typical\r\nquestions on which useful light would be shed by the Institute's\r\nresearches:--\r\n\r\n1. The influence of coöperative methods (_a_) on the productive and\r\ndistributive efficiency of rural communities, and (_b_) on the\r\ndevelopment of a social country life.\r\n\r\n2. The systems of rural education, both general and technical, in\r\ndifferent countries, and the administrative and financial basis of each\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n3. The relation between agricultural economy and the cost of food.\r\n\r\n4. The changes (_a_) in the standard and cost of living, and (_b_) in\r\nthe economy, solvency and stability of rural communities.\r\n\r\n5. The economic interdependence of the agricultural producer and the\r\nurban consumer, and the extent and incidence of middle profits in the\r\ndistribution of agricultural produce.\r\n\r\n6. The action taken by different Governments to assist the development\r\nand secure the stability of the agricultural classes, and the\r\npossibilities and the dangers of such action, with special reference to\r\nthe delimitation of the respective spheres of State aid and voluntary\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n7. How far agricultural and rural employment can relieve the problems of\r\ncity unemployment, and assist the work of social reclamation.\r\n\r\nSome may think that I am assigning to two bodies work which could be as\r\nwell done by one. While all proposals for multiplying organisations in\r\nthe field of social service should be critically examined, there are\r\nstrong reasons in this case for the course I suggest. The two bodies,\r\nwhile working to a common end, will differ essentially in their scope\r\nand method. The propagandist agency will be executive and\r\nadministrative, and while its operations would have suggestive value to\r\nthe country social worker everywhere, it would be concerned directly\r\nonly with the United States. Furthermore, it need not necessarily have\r\nany lengthened existence as a national propagandist agency. It would be\r\nfounded mainly to introduce that method into American agricultural\r\neconomy which I have tried to show lies at the root of rural progress.\r\nAs soon as the soundness of the general scheme had been demonstrated in\r\nany State, the central body would promote an organisation to take over\r\nthe work within that State. The State organisation would, in its turn,\r\nsoon be able to devolve its propagandist work upon a federation of the\r\nbusiness associations which it had been the means of establishing. That\r\nis the contemplated evolution of my first proposal--the early delegation\r\nof the functions of the national to the State propagandist agency, which\r\nwould further devolve the work upon bodies of farmers organised\r\nprimarily for economic purposes, but with the ulterior aim of social\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe Country Life Institute would be on a wholly different footing. Its\r\nresearches, if only to subserve the Country Life movement in the United\r\nStates, would have to range over the civilised world, and to be\r\nhistorical as well as contemporary. It should be regarded as a\r\ncontribution to the welfare of the English-speaking peoples, one aspect\r\nof whose civilisation--if there be truth in what I have written--needs\r\nto be reconsidered in the light which the Institute is designed to\r\nafford. Its task will be of no ephemeral character. Its success will\r\nnot, as in the case of the active propagandist body, lessen the need for\r\nits services, but will rather stimulate the demand for them.\r\n\r\nThese differences will have to be taken into account in considering the\r\nimportant question of ways and means. Both bodies will, I hope, appeal\r\nsuccessfully to public-spirited philanthropists. The temporary body will\r\nneed only temporary support; perhaps provision for a five-years'\r\ncampaign would suffice. In the near future, local organisations would\r\nnaturally defray the cost of the services rendered to them by the\r\ncentral body; but the Country Life Institute would need a permanent\r\nendowment. The man fitted for its chief control will not be found idle,\r\nbut will have to be taken from other work. The scheme, as I have worked\r\nit out, will involve prolonged economic and social inquiry over a wide\r\nfield. This would be conducted mostly by postgraduate students. From\r\nthose who did this outside work with credit would be recruited the\r\nsmall staff which would be needed at the central office to get into the\r\nmost accessible form the facts and opinions which are needed for the\r\nguidance of those who are doing practical work in the field of rural\r\nregeneration. My estimate of the amount required to do the work well is\r\nfrom forty to fifty thousand dollars a year, or say a capital sum of\r\nfrom a million to a million and a quarter dollars. Whether the project\r\nis worthy of such an expenditure, depends upon the question whether I\r\nhave made good my case.\r\n\r\nLet me summarise this case. I have tried to show that modern\r\ncivilisation is one-sided to a dangerous degree--that it has\r\nconcentrated itself in the towns and left the country derelict. This\r\ntendency is peculiar to the English-speaking communities, where the\r\ngreat industrial movement has had as its consequence the rural problem I\r\nhave examined. If the townward tendency cannot be checked, it will\r\nultimately bring about the decay of the towns themselves, and of our\r\nwhole civilisation, for the towns draw their supply of population from\r\nthe country. Moreover, the waste of natural resources, and possibly the\r\nalarming increase in the price of food, which have lately attracted so\r\nmuch attention in America, are largely due to the fact that those who\r\ncultivate the land do not intend to spend their lives upon it; and\r\nwithout a rehabilitation of country life there can be no success for the\r\nConservation policy. Therefore, the Country Life movement deals with\r\nwhat is probably the most important problem before the English-speaking\r\npeoples at this time. Now the predominance of the towns which is\r\ndepressing the country is based partly on a fuller application of modern\r\nphysical science, partly on superior business organisation, partly on\r\nfacilities for occupation and amusement; and if the balance is to be\r\nredressed, the country must be improved in all three ways. There must be\r\nbetter farming, better business, and better living. These three are\r\nequally necessary, but better business must come first. For farmers, the\r\nway to better living is coöperation, and what coöperation means is the\r\nchief thing the American farmer has to learn.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] In the capital of Virginia, to take one notable example, I have\r\nwitnessed a perfect ferment of social activity at one of the gatherings.\r\nIt brought together such an ideal combination of the best spirits in\r\nboth rural and urban life that I anticipate some striking developments\r\nin rural civilization which will surely extend beyond the borders of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[10] I may mention Raiffeisen, Luzzati, Rocquigny, Bishop Grundtwig,\r\nHenry W. Wolff, the Rev. T. A. Finlay, S.J., and most of the leaders in\r\nagricultural organization in Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[11] See above, page 31.\r\n\r\n[12] It may seem a small matter even for a footnote, but an unambiguous\r\nterminology is so important to propagandist work that I must mention a\r\nsomewhat unfortunate use of the word 'coöperation' which prevails in\r\nofficial and pedagogic circles. We hear of coöperative demonstration\r\nwork, coöperative education, coöperative lectures, and so forth.\r\nWhenever a Government or State department, or an educational body works\r\nwith any other agency, and sometimes when they are only doing their own\r\nwork, they use the term, which is of course grammatically applicable\r\nwhenever two people work together--from matrimony down. If the word in\r\nconnection with agriculture could be retained for its technical sense,\r\nso long established and well understood in Europe, the proposed movement\r\nmight be saved a good deal of confused thinking. Might not Government\r\nand educational authorities substitute the word 'coördinated' so as to\r\npreserve the distinction?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrinted in the United States of America.",
