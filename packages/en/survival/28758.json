All for the Glory of God, the Honour\r\nand Advantage of these Kingdoms, and the Universal Good of Mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Accompt of the improvement of_ Optick Glasses.\r\n\r\nThere came lately from _Paris_ a Relation, concerning the Improvement of\r\n_Optick Glasses_, not long since attempted at _Rome_ by Signor _Giuseppe\r\nCampani_, and by him discoursed of, in a Book, Entituled, _Ragguaglio di\r\nnuoue Osservationi_, lately printed in the said City, but not yet\r\ntransmitted into these parts; wherein these following particulars,\r\naccording to the Intelligence, which was sent hither, are contained.\r\n\r\nThe _First_ regardeth the excellency of the long _Telescopes_, made by the\r\nsaid _Campani_, who pretends to have found a way to work great _Optick\r\nGlasses_ with a Turne-tool, without any Mould: And whereas hitherto it hath\r\nbeen found by Experience, that _small_ Glasses are in proportion better to\r\nsee with, upon the Earth, than the _great_ ones; that Author affirms, that\r\nhis are equally good for the Earth, and for making Observations in the\r\nHeavens. Besides, he useth three Eye-Glasses for his great _Telescopes_,\r\nwithout finding any _Iris_, or such Rain-bow colours, as do usually appear\r\nin ordinary Glasses, and prove an impediment to Observations.\r\n\r\nThe _Second_, concerns the _Circle of Saturn_, in which he hath observed\r\nnothing, but what confirms Monsieur _Christian Huygens de Zulichem_ his\r\nSysteme of that Planet, published by that worthy Gentleman in the year,\r\n1659. {3}\r\n\r\nThe _Third_, respects _Jupiter_, wherein _Campani_ affirms he hath observed\r\nby the goodness of his Glasses, certain _protuberancies_ and\r\n_inequalities_, much greater than those that have been seen therein\r\nhitherto. He addeth, that he is now observing, whether those sallies in the\r\nsaid _Planet_ do not change their scituation, which if they should be found\r\nto do, he judgeth, that _Jupiter_ might then be said to turn upon his\r\n_Axe_; which, in his opinion, would serve much to confirm the opinion of\r\n_Copernicus_. Besides this, he affirms, he hath remarked in the _Belts_ of\r\n_Jupiter_, the shaddows of his _satellites_, and followed them, and at\r\nlength seen them emerge out of his Disk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Spot in one of the Belts of Jupiter._\r\n\r\nThe Ingenious Mr. _Hook_ did, some moneths since, intimate to a friend of\r\nhis, that he had, with an excellent twelve foot Telescope, observed, some\r\ndays before, he than spoke of it, (_videl._ on the ninth of _May_, 1664,\r\nabout 9 of the clock at night) a small Spot in the biggest of the 3\r\nobscurer _Belts_ of _Jupiter_, and that, observing it from time to time, he\r\nfound, that within 2 hours after, the said Spot had moved from East to\r\nWest, about half the length of the Diameter of _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Motion of the late Comet prædicted._\r\n\r\nThere was lately sent to one of the _Secretaries_ of the _Royal Society_ a\r\nPacket, containing some Copies of a Printed Paper, Entituled, The\r\n_Ephemerides_ of the _Comet_, made by the same Person, that sent it, called\r\n_Monsieur Auzout_, a _French_ Gentleman of no ordinary Merit and Learning,\r\nwho desired, that a couple of them might be recommended to the said\r\n_Society_, and one to their _President_, and another to his Highness Prince\r\n_Rupert_, and the rest to some other Persons, nominated by him in a Letter\r\nthat accompanied this present, and known abroad for their singular\r\nabilities and knowledge in Philosophical Matters. The end of the\r\nCommunication of this Paper was, That, the motion of the _Comet_, that hath\r\nlately appeared, having been prædicted by the said _Monsieur {4} Auzout_,\r\nafter he had seen it (as himself affirms) but 4 or 5 times: the _Virtuosi_\r\nof _England_, among others, might compare also their Observations with his\r\n_Ephemerides_, either to confirm the _Hypothesis_, upon which the _Author_\r\nhad before hand calculated the way of this Star, or to undeceive him, if he\r\nbe in a mistake. The said Author Dedicateth these his conceptions to the\r\nmost Christian King, telling him, that he presents Him with a design, which\r\nnever yet was undertaken by any _Astronomer_, all the World having been\r\nhitherto perswaded, that the motions of _Comets_ were so irregular, that\r\nthey could not be reduced to any Laws, and men having contented themselves,\r\nto observe exactly the places, through which they did pass; but no man,\r\nthat he knows, having been so bold as to venture to foretel the places,\r\nthrough which they should pass, and where they should cease to appear:\r\nWhereas he exhibites here the _Ephemerides_, determining day by day, in\r\nwhat place of the Heavens this _Comet_ shall be, at what hour it shall be\r\nin its _Meridian_, and at what hour it shall set; untill its too great\r\nremoteness, or the approach of the Sun, hide it from our eyes. Descending\r\nto particulars, he saith, that this Star, being disengaged from the beams\r\nof the Sun might have been observed, if his conjectures be good, ever since\r\nit hath been of 17 or 18 degrees _Southern Latitude_, and that about the\r\nmiddle of _November_ last, and sooner, unless it have been too small: That\r\nhowever it hath been seen in _Holland_ ever since the _2d._ of _December_\r\nlast, at which time, according to his reckoning, the Diurnal motion of the\r\n_Comet_ should already amount to 17 or 18 minutes. He finds, that this Star\r\nmoveth _just enough_ in the Plan of a _Great Circle_, which inclineth to\r\nthe _Equinoctial_ about 30 degrees, and to the _Ecliptick_ about 49d. or\r\n49½ cutting the _Equator_ at about 45_d_½, and the _Ecliptick_ at the 28_d_\r\nof _Aries_, or a little more. He saith _just enough_, because he thinks,\r\nthere may perhaps be some _parallaxe_, which he wisheth could be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nHence, (_so he goes on_) every one who pleaseth, may see, in tracing the\r\n_Comet_ upon the _Globe_, through, or by which Stars it hath passed and\r\nshall pass; adding, that there will be neither cause to wonder, that having\r\ndescended to about 6. deg. beneath the _Tropick_ of _Capricorn_, he hath\r\nremounted afterwards, and shall go {5} on ascending so, as to pass the\r\n_Æquinoctial_, and perhaps proceed to 15. degrees _Northern Declination_,\r\nif it do not disappear before that time, by reason of its remoteness: Nor\r\nto believe, that there have been two _Comets_, upon its being seen again\r\nthe 31. of _December_; since, according to him, it ought to have been so,\r\nif it continue to move in a _Great Circle_.\r\n\r\nHaving hereupon shewed, how the motion is to be traced upon the _Globe_, he\r\nfinds, that, according to his Calculation, this _Comet_ was to pass the\r\n_Tropick_ of _Capricorn_ about the 16 of _December_, and being entred into\r\nthe Sign of _Virgo_ on the 20. of the same month, and having been in\r\n_Quadrat_ with the _Sun_, it should still descend, until the 26 of\r\n_December_ in the morning, and then enter into _Leo_; that having entred,\r\nthe 28. of the same month, into _Cancer_, and been, a little after that\r\ntime, in its greatest Inclination to the _Ecliptick_, vid in the 28. degree\r\nof _Leo_, it was to repass the _Southern Tropick_, over against the _little\r\nDogg_, on the 29. of _December_ about 9 or 10 of the clock in the morning,\r\nafter it had been opposite to the _Sun_ 2. or 3. hours before; and that on\r\nthe 29. of _December_ in the evening it should be in _Gemini_; and at the\r\nvery beginning of the New year, enter into _Taurus_.\r\n\r\nAfter this, our Author finds, that this _Comet_, according to his account,\r\nshould pass the _Æquator_, on the 4. of _January_ before noon, and that\r\nabout 5. or 6. of the clock in the evening of that day it was to come into\r\nthe jaw of the _Whale_, and the 9. of the same, at 6. of the clock it\r\nshould come close to the small Star of the _Whale_, which is in its way, a\r\nlittle below. At length he finds that it was to enter into _Aries_ on the\r\n12. of _January_, and to cut the _Ecliptick_ on the 16. of the same month\r\nabout noon, at which time it was to be again in _Quadrat_ with the _Sun_,\r\nwhence drawing a little to above the _Northern Line_ of _Pisces_, it should\r\nin his opinion cease to appear a little beyond that place, without going as\r\nfar as to the middle of _Aries_, if so be that its remoteness make it not\r\ndisappear sooner.\r\n\r\nHe continueth, and saith, that this _Comet_ shall not arrive to the place\r\nover against the _Line_ of _Pisces_ till the 10 of _February_, & that then\r\nits _Diurnal_ motion shall not exceed 8 minutes, and not 5 minutes about\r\nthe 20 of the same month: and that in the {6} beginning of _March_, if we\r\nsee it so long, the said motion shall not exceed 4 minutes, and so shall be\r\nstill diminishing; except the _Comet_ become _Retrograde_, which, as very\r\nimportant, he would have well observed; as also, whether its motion will be\r\nabout the end more or less swift, than he hath calculated it.\r\n\r\nHe subjoyneth, that the greatest way, which this Star could make in 24.\r\nhours, hath been 13. d. 25'; and in one houre, about 34'; and thinking it\r\nprobable, that about the time, when it made so much way, it should be\r\nnearest to the _Earth_, he concludeth that its motion in 24. hours must be,\r\nin its least distance from the _Earth_, as about 3. to 14, or 1. to 4-2/3,\r\nand that its motion in one hour was to be to the same least distance, as\r\nabout 1. to 102-1/7.\r\n\r\nBut that, which he judgeth most remarkable, is, that he found by his\r\nCalculation, that the said least distance should be on the 29. of\r\n_December_, when the _Comet_ was opposite to the Sun; which he does not\r\nknow whether it may not serve to decide the grand Question concerning the\r\n_Motion of the Earth_.\r\n\r\nHe taketh further notice, that the _Tayl_ of the _Comet_ was to turn\r\n_Westward_, with a point to the _North_, until the 29. of _December_, at\r\nwhich time it was to be opposite to the _Sun_, and that then the said\r\n_Tayl_ was to look directly _North_; but that, after that time, the _Tayl_\r\nwas to turn _Eastward_, and continue to do so, until it disappear; and that\r\nit shall draw a little towards the _North_, until the 8. or 10. of\r\n_February_, at which time the _Tayl_ is to be parallel to the _Æquator_, as\r\nif the _Comet_ be _yet_ seen for some time after, the _Tayl_ shall go a\r\nlittle lower towards the _South_, but grow smaller.\r\n\r\nHe finds by his _Hypothesis_, that on the 2. of _December_, which is the\r\nfirst observation, that he hath heard of, this Star was to be about 7.\r\ntimes more remote from the _Earth_, than when it was in its _Perigeum_; and\r\nthat it will be again in an equall remoteness from the _Earth_, on the 27.\r\nof _January_, so that he is of opinion, that in case this _Comet_ have not\r\nbeen seen before the 2. of _December_, it will not be seen any more after\r\nthe 27. of _January_.\r\n\r\nHe wishes above all things, that it might be very exactly observed, at what\r\nAngle the way of the _Comet_ cuts the _Æquator_, and, most of all, the\r\n_Ecliptick_, that so it may be seen, whether {7} there hath not been some\r\n_Parallaxe_ in the _Circle_ of his Motion; as also, that some observations\r\ncould be had of its greatest descent beneath the _Tropick of Capricorn_ in\r\nthe more _Southern_ parts, where he saith it would have been without\r\n_Refractions_; Moreover of the Time, when it hath been in _Quadrat_ with\r\nthe _Sun_ about the 20 of _December_; and that also very exact Observation\r\nmight be made of the time of its being again in _Quadrat_ with the _Sun_,\r\nwhich, according to him, was to be _January_ 16.\r\n\r\nHe wishes also, that some in _Madagascar_ may have observed this Star;\r\nSeeing that it began to appear over the middle of that _Island_, and passed\r\ntwice over their heads; he judgeth, that they have seen it before us. And\r\nhe wisheth lastly, that there were some intelligent person in _Guiana_ to\r\nobserve it there, seeing that within a few daies, according to his\r\nreckoning, it will pass over their Heads, and will not remove from thence\r\nbut 8 or 10 degrees Northward, where he saith, it will disappear; thinking\r\nit improbable, that it can still appear, after the _Sun_ shall have passed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis Account beareth date of the 2. _January_, new stile, 1665. and the\r\nAuthor thereof addeth this Note, That, seeing it could not be printed nor\r\ndistributed so soon as he desired, he hath had the opportunity to verifie\r\nit by some Observations, from which he affirms he hath found no sensible\r\ndifference; or, if there be, that it proceeds only from thence, that the\r\nStars have advanced, since his _Globe_ was made. He concludeth, that if\r\nthis continue, and the first Observations do likewise agree, or that the\r\ndifferences do arrive within the Times ghessed by him, that he hopes, he\r\nshall determine both the _Distance_ and the _Magnitude_ of this _Comet_;\r\nand that perhaps one may be enabled to decide the Question of the _Motion\r\nof the Earth_. In the interim, he assureth, that he hath not changed the\r\nleast number in his Calculations, and that _Monsieur Huygens_, and several\r\nFrench Gentlemen, to whom he saith, he hath given them long since, can bear\r\nhim witness that he hath done so; as also many other friends of his, who\r\nsaw upon his _Globe_, several daies before, the way of the _Comet_ from day\r\nto day.\r\n\r\nThus for the _Parisian_ Account of the Comet, which is here inserted at\r\nlarge, that the intelligent and curious in _England_ may {8} compare their\r\nObservations therewith, either to verifie these _Prædictions_, or to shew\r\nwherein they differ; which is (as was also hinted above) the design of this\r\n_Philosophical Prophet_ in dispersing his Conceptions, who declareth\r\nhimself ready, in case he be mistaken in his reckoning, to learn another\r\n_Hypothesis_, to explicate these admirable appearances by.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Experimental History of Cold._\r\n\r\nThere is in the Press, a New _Treatise_, entituled, _New Observations and\r\nExperiments in order to an Experimental History of Cold_, begun by that\r\nNoble Philosopher, Mr. _Robert Boyle_, and in great part already Printed;\r\nHe did lately very obligingly present several Copies of so much as was\r\nPrinted, to the _Royal Society_, with a desire that some of the Members\r\nthereof might be engaged to peruse the Book, and select out of it for\r\ntrial, the hints of such Experiments, as the _Author_ there wisheth might\r\nbe either yet made or prosecuted. The Heads thereof are,\r\n\r\n1. Experiments touching Bodies capable of Freezing others.\r\n\r\n2. Experiments and Observations touching Bodies Disposed to be Frozen.\r\n\r\n3. Experiments touching Bodies, Indisposed to be Frozen.\r\n\r\n4. Experiments and Observations touching the Degrees of Cold in several\r\nBodies.\r\n\r\n5.

Of the strange Effects of Cold.\r\n\r\n20. Experiments touching the weight of Bodies frozen and unfrozen.\r\n\r\n21. Promiscuous Experiments and Observations concerning Cold.\r\n\r\nThis Treatise will be dispatched within a very short time, and would have\r\nbeen so, ere this, if the extremity of the late Frost had not stopt the\r\nPress. It will be accompanied with some Discourses of the same _Author_,\r\nconcerning _New Thermometrical Experiments and Thoughts_, as also, with an\r\nExercitation about the _Doctrine of the Antiperistasis_: In the former\r\nwhereof is _first_ proposed this _Paradox_, That not only our Senses, but\r\ncommon Weather-glasses, may mis-inform us about Cold. _Next_, there are\r\ncontained in this part, New Observations about the deficiencies of\r\nWeather-glasses, together with some considerations touching the New or\r\n_Hermetrical_ Thermometers. _Lastly_, they deliver another _Paradox_,\r\ntouching the cause of the Condensation of the Air, and Ascent of water by\r\ncold in common Weather-glasses. The latter piece of this part contains an\r\nExamen of _Antiperistasis_, as it is wont to be _taught_ and _proved;_ Of\r\nall which there will, perhaps, a fuller account be given by the Next. {10}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of a very odd Monstrous Calf._\r\n\r\nBy the same Noble person was lately communicated to the _Royal Society_ an\r\naccount of a very Odd Monstrous Birth, produced at _Limmington_ in\r\n_Hampshire_, where a Butcher, having caused a Cow (which cast her Calf the\r\nyear before) to be covered, that she might the sooner be fatted, killed her\r\nwhen fat, and opening the Womb, which he found heavy to admiration, saw in\r\nit a Calf, which had begun to have hair, whose hinder Leggs had no Joynts,\r\nand whose Tongue was, _Cerberus_-like, triple, to each side of his Mouth\r\none, and one in the midst: Between the Fore-leggs and the Hinder-leggs was\r\na great Stone, on which the Calf rid: the _Sternum_, or that part of the\r\nBreast, where the Ribs lye, was also perfect Stone; and the Stone, on which\r\nit rid, weighed twenty pounds and a half; the outside of the Stone was of\r\nGrenish colour, but some small parts being broken off, it appeared a\r\nperfect Free-stone. The Stone, according to the Letter of Mr. _David\r\nThomas_, who sent this Account to Mr. _Boyle_, is with Doctor _Haughteyn_\r\nof _Salisbury_, to whom he also referreth for further Information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a peculiar Lead-Ore of _Germany_, and the Use thereof._\r\n\r\nThere was, not long since, sent hither out of _Germany_ from an inquisitive\r\nPhysician, a List of several _Minerals_ and _Earths_ of that Country, and\r\nof _Hungary_, together with a _Specimen_ of each of them: among which there\r\nwas a kind of _Lead-Ore_ which is more considerable than all the rest,\r\nbecause of its singular use for _Essays_ upon the _Coppell_, seeing that\r\nthere is not any other _Mettal_ mixed with it. 'Tis found in the _Upper\r\nPalatinate_, at a place called _Freyung_, and there are two sorts of it,\r\nwhereof one is a kind of Crystalline Stone, and almost all good Lead; the\r\nother not so rich, and more farinaceous. By the information, coming along\r\nwith it, they are fetcht, not from under the ground, but, the Mines of that\r\nplace having lain long neglected, by reason of the Wars of _Germany_ and\r\nthe increase of Waters, the people, living {11} there-about take it from\r\nwhat these Forefathers had thrown away, and had lain long in the open Air.\r\nThe use above mentioned being considerable, the person, who sent it, hath\r\nbeen intreated, to inform what quantities may be had of it, if there should\r\nbe occasion to send for some.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of an Hungarian Bolus, of the same Effect with the Bolus Armenus._\r\n\r\nThe same person gave notice also, that, besides the _Bolus Armenus_, and\r\nthe _Terra Silesiaca_, there is an Earth to be found in _Hungary_ about the\r\nRiver _Tockay_, thence called _Bolus Tockaviensis_, having as good effects\r\nin _Physick_, as either of the former two, and commended by experience in\r\nthose parts, as much as it is by _Sennertus_ out of _Crato_, for its\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the New _American_ Whale-fishing about the Bermudas._\r\n\r\nHere follows a Relation, somewhat more divertising, than the precedent\r\nAccounts, which is about the new _Whale fishing_ in the _West-Indies_ about\r\nthe _Bermudas_, as it was delivered by an understanding and hardy Sea-man,\r\nwho affirmed he had been at the killing work himself. His account, as far\r\nas remembred, was this; that though hitherto all Attempts of mastering the\r\nWhales of those Seas had been unsuccesful, by reason of the extraordinary\r\nfierceness and swiftness of these monstrous Animals; yet the enterprise\r\nbeing lately renewed, and such persons chosen and sent thither for the\r\nwork, as were resolved not to be baffled by a Sea-monster, they did prosper\r\nso far in this undertaking, that, having been out at Sea, near the said\r\nIsle of _Bermudas_, seventeen times, and fastned their Weapons a dozen\r\ntimes, they killed in these expeditions 2 old Female-Whales, and 3 Cubs,\r\nwhereof one of the old ones, from the head to the extremity of the Tayl,\r\nwas 88. Foot in length, by measure; its Tayl being 23. Foot broad, the\r\nswimming Finn 26. Foot long, and the Gills three Foot long: having great\r\nbends underneath from the Nose to the Navil; upon her after-part, a Finn on\r\nthe back; being within {12} paved (this was the plain Sea-man's phrase)\r\nwith fat, like the Cawl of a Hog.\r\n\r\nThe other old one, he said, was some 60. Foot long. Of the Cubs, one was\r\n33. the other two, much about 25 or 26. Foot long.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the Fish, he said, was very sharp behind, like the ridge of a\r\nhouse; the head pretty bluff, and full of bumps on both sides; the back\r\nperfectly black, and the belly white.\r\n\r\nTheir celerity and force he affirmed to be wonderful, insomuch that one of\r\nthose Creatures, which he struck himself, towed the boat wherein he was,\r\nafter him, for the space of six or seven Leagues, in ¾ of an hours time.\r\nBeing wounded, he saith, they make a hideous roaring, at which, all of that\r\nkind that are within hearing, come towards that place, where the Animal is,\r\nyet without striking, or doing any harm to the wary.\r\n\r\nHe added, that they struck one of a prodigious bigness, and by guess of\r\nabove 100 foot long. He is of opinion, that this Fish comes nearest to that\r\nsort of Whales, which they call the _Jubartes_; they are without teeth, and\r\nlonger than the _Greenland_-Whales, but not so thick.\r\n\r\nHe said further, that they fed much upon Grass, growing at the bottom of\r\nthe Sea; which, he affirmed, was seen by cutting up the great Bag of Maw,\r\nwherein he had found in one of them about two or three Hogsheads of a\r\ngreenish grassy matter.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity and nature of the Oyl which they yield, he thought, that\r\nthe largest sort of these Whales might afford seven or eight Tuns if well\r\nhusbanded, although they had lost much this first time, for want of a good\r\nCooper; having brought home but eleven Tuns. The Cubbs, by his relation, do\r\nyield but little, and that is but a kind of a Jelly. That which the old\r\nones render, doth candy like Porks Grease, yet burneth very well. He\r\nobserved, that the Oyl of the Blubber is as clear and fair as any Whey: but\r\nthat which is boyled out of the Lean, interlarded, becomes as hard as\r\nTallow, spattering in the burning and that which is made of the Cawl,\r\nresembleth Hoggs grease.\r\n\r\nOne, but scarce credible, quality of this Oyl, he affirms to be, that\r\nthough it be boiling, yet one may run ones hand into it without scalding;\r\nto which he adds, that it hath a very healing {13} Vertue for cuttings,\r\nlameness, &c., the part affected being anointed therewith. One thing more\r\nhe related, not to be omitted, which is, that having told, that the time of\r\ncatching these Fishes was from the beginning of _March_, to the end of\r\n_May_, after which time they appeared no more in that part of the Sea: he\r\ndid, when asked, whither they then retired, give this Answer, That it was\r\nthought, they went into the Weed-beds of the Gulf of _Florida_, it having\r\nbeen observed, that upon their Fins and Tails they have store of Clams or\r\nBarnacles, upon which, he said, Rock-weed or Sea-tangle did grow a hand\r\nlong; many of them having been taken of them, of the bigness of great\r\nOyster-shels, and hung upon the Governour of _Bermudas_ his Pales.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Narrative concerning the success of Pendulum-Watches at Sea for the\r\nLongitudes._\r\n\r\nThe Relation lately made by Major _Holmes_, concerning the success of the\r\n_Pendulum-Watches_ at Sea (two whereof were committed to his Care and\r\nObservation in his last voyage to _Guiny_ by some of our Eminent\r\n_Virtuosi_, and Grand Promoters of Navigation) is as followeth;\r\n\r\nThe said _Major_ having left that Coast, and being come to the Isle of St.\r\n_Thomas_ under the _Line_ accompanied with four Vessels, having there\r\nadjusted his Watches, put to Sea, and sailed Westward, seven or eight\r\nhundred Leagues, without changing his course; after which, finding the Wind\r\nfavourable, he steered towards the Coast of _Africk_, North-North-East. But\r\nhaving sailed upon that _Line_ a matter of two or three hundred Leagues,\r\nthe Masters of the other Ships, under his Conduct, apprehending that they\r\nshould want Water, before they could reach that Coast, did propose to him\r\nto steer their Course to the _Barbadoes_, to supply themselves with Water\r\nthere. Whereupon the said Major, having called the Master and Pilots\r\ntogether, and caused them to produce their Journals and Calculations, it\r\nwas found, that those Pilots did differ in their reckonings from that of\r\nthe Major, one of them eighty Leagues, another about an hundred, and the\r\nthird, more; but the Major judging by his _Pendulum-Watches_, that they\r\nwere only some thirty Leagues distant from {14} the Isle of _Fuego_, which\r\nis one of the Isles of _Cape Verde_, and that they might reach it next day,\r\nand having a great confidence in the said Watches, resolved to steer their\r\nCourse thither, and having given order so to do, they got the very next day\r\nabout Noon a sight of the said Isle of _Fuego_, finding themselves to sail\r\ndirectly upon it, and so arrived at it that Afternoon, as he had said.\r\nThese Watches having been first Invented by the Excellent Monsieur\r\n_Christian Hugens_ of _Zulichem_, and fitted to go at Sea, by the Right\r\nHonourable, the Earl of _Kincardin_, both Fellows of the _Royal Society_,\r\nare now brought by a New addition to a wonderful perfection. The said\r\nMonsieur _Hugens_, having been informed of the success of the Experiment,\r\nmade by _Major Holmes_, wrought to a friend at _Paris_ a Letter to this\r\neffect;\r\n\r\nMajor _Holmes_ at his return, hath made a relation concerning the\r\nusefulness of _Pendulums_, which surpasseth my expectation: I did not\r\nimagine that the Watches of this first Structure would succeed so well, and\r\nI had reserved my main hopes for the New ones. But seeing that those have\r\nalready served so succesfully, and that the other are yet more just and\r\nexact, I have the more reason to believe, that the Invention of\r\n_Longitudes_ will come to its perfection. In the mean time I shall tell\r\nyou, that the _States_ did receive my Proposition, when I desired of them a\r\nPatent for these new Watches, and the recompense set a-part for the\r\ninvention in case of success; and that without any difficulty they have\r\ngranted my request, commanding me to bring one of these Watches into their\r\nAssembly, to explicate unto them the Invention, and the application thereof\r\nto the _Longitudes_; which I have done to their contentment. I have this\r\nweek published, that the said Watches shall be exposed to sale, together\r\nwith an Information necessary to use them at Sea: and thus I have broken\r\nthe Ice. The same Objection, that hath been made in your parts against the\r\nexactness of these _Pendulums_, hath also been made here; to wit, that\r\nthough they should agree together, they might fail both of them, by reason\r\nthat the Air at one time might be thicker, than at another. But I have\r\nanswered, that this difference, if there be any, will not be at all\r\nperceived in the _Penduls_, seeing that the continuall Observations, made\r\nin Winter from day to day, until Summer, have shewed me that {15} they have\r\nalwaies agreed with the Sun. As to the Printing of the _Figure_ of my New\r\nWatch, I shall defer that yet a while: but it shall in time appear with all\r\nthe Demonstrations thereof, together with a _Treatise_ of _Pendulums_,\r\nwritten by me some daies since, which is of a very subtile Speculation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Character, lately published beyond the Seas, of an Eminent person, not\r\nlong since dead at _Tholouse_, where he was a Councellor of Parliament._\r\n\r\nIt is the deservedly famous _Mounsieur de Fermat_, who was, (saith the\r\nAuthor of the Letter) one of the most Excellent Men of this Age, a _Genius_\r\nso universal, and of so vast an extent, that if very knowing and learned\r\nMen had not given testimony of his extraordinary merit, what with truth can\r\nbe said of him, would hardly be believed. He entertained a constant\r\ncorrespondence with many of the most Illustrious Mathematicians of\r\n_Europe_, and did excel in all the parts of Mathematical Science: a\r\nTestimony whereof he hath left behind him in the following Books.\r\n\r\nA Method for the Quadrature of _Parabola's_ of all degrees.\r\n\r\nA Book _De Maximis & Minimis_, which serveth not only for the determination\r\nof Problems of _Plains_ and _Solids_, but also for the invention of\r\n_Tangents_ and _Curve Lines_, and of the _Centres_ of Gravity in Solids;\r\nand likewise for Numerical Questions.\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to the Doctrine of _Plains_ and _Solids_, which is an\r\n_Analytical_ Treatise, concerning the solution of _Plains_ and _Solids_,\r\nwhich has been seen (as the Advertiser affirms) before Monsieur _Des\r\nCartes_ had publish'd any thing upon this Subject.\r\n\r\nA Treatise _De Contactibus Sphæricis_, where he hath demonstrated in\r\n_Solids_, what Mr. _Viet_, Master of Requests, had but demonstrated in\r\n_Plains_.\r\n\r\nAnother Treatise, wherein he establisheth and demonstrateth the two Books\r\nof _Apollonius Pergæus_, of _Plains_.\r\n\r\nAnd a General Method for the dimension of _Curve Lines_, &c. Besides,\r\nhaving a perfect knowledge in Antiquity, he was consulted from all parts\r\nupon the difficulties that did emerg therein: he hath explained abundance\r\nof obscure places, that are {16} found in the Antients. There have been\r\nlately printed some of his Observations upon _Athenæus_; and he that hath\r\ninterpreted _Benedetto Castelli_, of the Measure of running waters, hath\r\nthence inserted in his Work a very handsome one upon an Epistle of\r\n_Synesius_, which was so difficult, that the Jesuit _Petavius_, who hath\r\ncommented upon this Author, acknowledges, that he could not understand it.\r\n\r\nHe hath also made many Observations upon _Theon of Smyrne_, and upon other\r\nAntient Authors: but most part of them are not found but scattered in his\r\nEpistles, because he did not write much upon these kinds of Subjects, but\r\nto satisfie the curiosity of his friends.\r\n\r\nAll these Mathematical Works, and all these curious searches in Antiquity,\r\ndid not hinder this great _Virtuoso_ from discharging the duties of his\r\nplace with much assiduity, and with so much ability, that he hath had the\r\nreputation of one of the greatest _Civilians_ of his Age.\r\n\r\nBut that, which is most of all surprizing to many, is, that with all that\r\nstrength of understanding, which was requisite to make good these rare\r\nqualities, lately mentioned, he had so polite and delicate parts, that he\r\ncomposed _Latin_, _French_, and _Spanish_ Verses with the same elegancy, as\r\nif he had lived in the time of _Augustus_, and passed the greatest part of\r\nhis life at the Courts of _France_ and _Spain_.\r\n\r\nMore particulars will perhaps be mention'd of the Works of this Rare\r\nperson, when all things, that he hath publish'd, shall be recovered, and\r\nwhen liberty shall be obtained of his Worthy Son, to impart unto the World\r\nthe rest of his Writings, hitherto unpublished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON,_\r\n\r\nPrinted with Licence, By _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to\r\nthe _Royal-Society_.\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 2.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _April_ 3. 1665.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _Extract of a Letter written from _Rome_, concerning the late _Comet_,\r\n    and a _New_ one.

I have\r\nwith the same method, whereby I find the motion of this Comet, easily found\r\nthe Principle of that Author's _Ephemerides_, which he then thought not fit\r\nto declare; and 'tis this, that this Comet moves about the _Great Dog_, in\r\nso great a Circle, that that portion, which is {18} described, is exceeding\r\nsmall in respect of the whole circumference thereof, and hardly\r\ndistinguishable by us from a streight line.\r\n\r\nConcerning the New Comet you mention, I saw it on the 11. of _February_,\r\nabout the 24. deg. of _Aries_, with a Northern latitude of 24. deg. 40.\r\nmin. The cloudy weather hath not yet permitted me to see it in _Andromeda_,\r\nas others affirm to have done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter, written from _Paris_, containing some Reflections on\r\npart of the precedent _Roman_ Letter._\r\n\r\nAs to the _Hypothesis_ of _Georg. Domenico Cassini_, touching the motion of\r\nthe _Comet_ about the _Great Dog_ in a Circle, whose Centre is in a\r\nstreight line drawn from the Earth through the said Star, I believe it will\r\nshortly be publish'd in print, as a thought I lighted upon in discoursing\r\nwith one of my Friends, who did maintain, that it turned about a Centre,\r\nbecause that its _Perigee_ had been over against the _Great Dog_, as I had\r\nnoted in my _Ephemerides_. This particular I did long since declare to many\r\nof my acquaintance, whereof some or other will certainly do me that right,\r\nas to let the world know it by the Press. I have added an Observation,\r\nwhich I find not, that Signior _Cassini_ hath made, _viz._ that there was\r\nground to think, that the _Comet_ of 1652. was the same with the present,\r\nseeing that besides the parity of the swiftness of its motion, the\r\n_Perigee_ thereof was also over against the _Great Dog_, if the\r\nObservations extant thereof, deceive not. But, to make it out, what ground\r\nI had for these thoughts, I said, that if they were true, the Comet must\r\nneeds acomplish its revolution from 10. to 12. years, or thereabout. But,\r\nseeing it appears not by History, that a Comet hath been seen at those\r\ndeterminate distances of time, nor that over against the _Perigee_ of all\r\nthe other Comets, whereof particular observations are recorded, are alwaies\r\nfound Stars of the first Magnitude, or such others, as are very notable,\r\nbesides other reasons, that might be alledged, I shall not pursue this\r\nspeculation; but rather {19} suggest what I have taken notice of in my\r\nreflexions upon former Comets, which is, that more of them enter inter our\r\nSysteme by the sign of _Libra_ and about _Spica virginis_, than by all the\r\nother parts of the Heavens. For, both the present Comet, and many others\r\nregistred in History, have entred that way, and consequently passed out of\r\nit by the sign _Aries_, by which also many have entred.\r\n\r\nI did found my _Hypothesis_ upon three Observations only, _viz._ those of\r\nthe 22, 26, and 31. of _December_. Nor have I done, as some have fancied of\r\nme, who having been able to observe the Comet, the 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.\r\nof _December_, and to see the diminution of its motion, have judged, that I\r\nhad only determined that diminution for the time to come, conform to the\r\naugmentation thereof in time passed until the 29. of _December_. For\r\n_January_ 1. (on which day I composed my _Ephemerides_) I knew not (nor any\r\nperson here) that the motion of the Comet did diminish; but on the\r\ncontrary, most men believed, it was not the same Comet. But Signior\r\n_Cassini_ knows very well, that that was not necessary, seeing that two\r\nportions of a _Tangent_ being given, and the _Angles_ answering thereunto,\r\n'tis easie to find the position and magnitude of its Circle. The reason,\r\nwhich I think the true one, of the diminution of its Motion in Longitude,\r\nand of its Retrogradation, by me conjectured in my _Ephemerides_, I began\r\nto be assured of, _Febr._ 10. For until the sixth, the Comet had alwaies\r\nadvanced, as Signior _Cassini_ also hath very well noted: but after that\r\nday, I found that it returned in augmenting alwaies its Latitude. And I\r\nhave constantly observed it, until _March_ 8. between many Stars, which\r\nmust be the same with these mentioned by _Cassini_, whereof the number was\r\nso great, that I think, I saw of them _March_ 6. with one _Aperture_ of my\r\nGlass, more than 40. or 50. and especially, above the head of _Aries_; but\r\nI did not particularly note the scituation of more than 12. or 15; amongst\r\nwhich I have observed the position of the Comet since _January_ 28. every\r\nday, when the weather did permit, _viz._ _January_ 29. _February_ 3, 6, 10,\r\n17, 19, 24, 26, 27. and _March_ 6, {20} 7, 8. I left it on _March_ 8. at\r\nthe 18. of the Horn of _Aries_, almost in the same latitude: and I am apt\r\nto believe, it will be Eclipsed, which I wish I may be able to observe this\r\nevening, if it be not already passed.\r\n\r\nIf Signior _Cassini_ hath observed it on those daies that I have, he will\r\nbe glad to find the conformity of our Observations. I shall only add, that\r\non _February_ 3. we were surprized, to see the Comet again much brighter\r\nthan ordinary, and with a considerable Train. Some did believe, that it\r\napproach'd again to us. But having beheld it with a _Telescope_, I soon\r\nsaid, that it was joyned with two small Stars, whereof one was pretty\r\nbright, which I had already seen, on _February_ 28. and 29. And this\r\nconjunction gave the _Comet_ that brightness, as it happens to most of the\r\nStars of the fifth and sixth magnitude, where 2. or 3. or more are\r\nconjoyned, which perhaps would shew but faintly single, though by reason of\r\ntheir proximity to one another, they appear but one Star. Hence it was,\r\nthat I assured my friends here, that the following daies we should no more\r\nsee it so bright, because I knew, that there were none such small bright\r\nStars in the way, which by my former observations I conjectured it was to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Observation imparted to the Noble Mr. _Boyle_, by Mr. _David Thomas_,\r\ntouching some particulars further considerable in the Monster mentioned in\r\nthe first Papers of these _Philosophical Transactions_._\r\n\r\nUpon the strictest inquiry, I find by one, that saw the Monstrous Calf and\r\nstone, within four hours after it was cut out of the Cows belly, that the\r\nBreast of the Calf was not stony (as I wrote) but that the skin of the\r\nBreast and between the Legs and of the Neck (which parts lay on the smaller\r\nend of the stone) was very much thicker, than on any other part, and that\r\nthe Feet of the Calf were so parted as to be like the Claws of a Dog. The\r\nstone I have since seen; it is bigger at one end {21} than the other; of no\r\nplain _Superficies_, but full of little cavities. The stone, when broken,\r\nis full of small peble stones of an Ovall figure: its colour is gray like\r\nfree-stone, but intermixt with veins of yellow and black. A part of it I\r\nhave begg'd of Dr. _Haughten_ for you, which I have sent to _Oxford_,\r\nwhither a more exact account will be conveyed by the same person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter, lately written from _Venice_ by the Learned Doctor\r\n_Walter Pope_, to the Reverend Dean of _Rippon_, Doctor _John Wilkins_,\r\nconcerning the Mines of Mercury in _Friuli_; and a way of producing _Wind_\r\nby the fall of _Water_._\r\n\r\nThe mines of _Mercury_ in _Friuli_, a Territory belonging to the\r\n_Venetians_, are about a days Journey and a half distant from _Goritia_\r\nNorthwards, at a place call'd _Idria_, scituated in a Valley of the _Julian\r\nAlps_. They have been, as I am inform'd, these 160. years in the possession\r\nof the Emperor, and all the Inhabitants speak the _Sclavonian_ Tongue. In\r\ngoing thither, we travell'd several hours in the best Wood I ever saw\r\nbefore or since, being very full of _Firrs_, _Oakes_, and _Beeches_, of an\r\nextraordinary thickness, straitness, and height. The Town is built, as\r\nusually Towns in the _Alps_ are, all of wood, the Church only excepted, and\r\nanother House wherein the Overseer liveth. When I was there, in _August_\r\nlast, the Valley, and the Mountains too, out of which the _Mercury_ was\r\ndug, were of as pleasant a verdure, as if it had been in the midst of\r\nSpring, which they there attribute to the moistness of the _Mercury_; how\r\ntruly, I dispute not. That Mine, which we went into, the best and greatest\r\nof them all, was dedicated to Saint _Barbara_, as the other Mines are to\r\nother Saints, the depth of it was 125. paces, every pace of that Country\r\nbeing, as they inform'd us, more than 5 of our Feet. There are two ways\r\ndown to it; the shortest perpendicular way is that, whereby they bring up\r\nthe Mineral in great Buckets, and {22} by which oftentimes some of the\r\nworkmen come up and down. The other, which is the usual way, is at the\r\nbeginning not difficult, the descent not being much; the greatest trouble\r\nis, that in several places you cannot stand upright: but this holds not\r\nlong, before you come to descend in earnest by perpendicular Ladders, where\r\nthe weight of on's body is found very sensible. At the end of each Ladder,\r\nthere are boards a-cross, where we may breath a little. The Ladders, as we\r\nsaid, are perpendicular, but being imagined produced, do not make one\r\nLadder, but several parallel ones. Being at the bottom, we saw no more than\r\nwe saw before, only the place, whence the Mineral came. All the way down,\r\nand the bottom, where there are several lanes cut out in the Mountain, is\r\nlined and propt with great pieces of Firr-trees, as thick as they can be\r\nset. They dig the Mineral with Pick-axes, following the veins: 'tis for the\r\nmost part hard as a stone, but more weighty; of a Liver-colour, or that of\r\n_Crocus Metallorum_. I hope shortly to shew you some of it. There is also\r\nsome soft Earth, in which you plainly see the _Mercury_ in little\r\nparticles. Besides this, there are oftentimes found in the Mines round\r\nstones like Flints, of several bignesses, very like those Globes of Hair,\r\nwhich I have often seen in _England_, taken out of Oxes bellies. There are\r\nalso several _Marcasites_ and stones, which seem to have specks of Gold in\r\nthem, but upon tryal they say, they find none in them. These round stones\r\nare some of them very ponderous, and well impregnated with _Mercury_;\r\nothers light, having little or none in them. The manner of getting the\r\n_Mercury_ is this: They take of the Earth, brought up in Buckets, and put\r\nit into a Sive, whose bottom is made of wires at so great a distance, that\r\nyou may put your finger betwixt them: 'tis carried to a stream of running\r\nwater, and wash'd as long as any thing will pass through the Sive. That\r\nEarth which passeth not, is laid aside upon another heap: that which\r\npasseth, reserved in the hole, G. in Fig. 1. and taken up again by the\r\nsecond Man, and so on, to about ten or twelve sives proportionably less. It\r\noften happens in the first hole, where the second Man takes up his {23}\r\nEarth, that there is _Mercury_ at the bottom; but towards the farther end,\r\nwhere the Intervals of the wires are less, 'tis found in very great\r\nproportion. The Earth laid aside is pounded, and the same operation\r\nrepeated. The fine small Earth, that remains after this, and out of which\r\nthey can wash no more _Mercury_, is put into Iron retorts and stopt,\r\nbecause it should not fall into the Receivers, to which they are luted. The\r\nfire forces the _Mercury_ into the Receivers: the Officer unluted several\r\nof them to shew us; I observed in all of them, that he first poured out\r\nperfect _Mercury_, and after that came a black dust, which being wetted\r\nwith water discover'd it self to be _Mercury_, as the other was. They take\r\nthe _Caput mortuum_ and pound it, and renew the operation as long as they\r\ncan get any _Mercury_ out of it.\r\n\r\nThis is the way of producing the _Mercury_, they call _Ordinary_, which\r\nexceeds that, which is got by washing, in a very great proportion, as you\r\nwill perceive by the account annext. All the _Mercury_ got without the use\r\nof Fire, whether by washing, or found in the Mines (for in the digging,\r\nsome little particles get together, so that in some places you might take\r\nup two or three spoonfuls of pure _Mercury_) is call'd by them _Virgin\r\nMercury_, and esteem'd above the rest. I inquir'd of the Officer what\r\nvertue that had more, than the other; he told me that making an _Amalgama_\r\nof Gold and _Virgin Mercury_, and putting it to the fire, that _Mercury_\r\nwould carry away all the Gold with it, which common _Mercury_ would not do.\r\n\r\nThe Engins, employed in these Mines, are admirable; the Wheels, the\r\ngreatest that ever I saw in my life; one would think as great as the matter\r\nwould bear: all moved by the dead force of the water, brought thither in no\r\nchargeable Aqueduct from a Mountain, 3 Miles distant: the water pumpt from\r\nthe bottom of the Mine by 52 pumps, 26 on a side, is contrived to move\r\nother wheels, for several other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Labourers work for a _Julio_ a day, which is not above 6 or 7 pence,\r\nand indure not long; for, although none stay {24} underground above 6\r\nhours; all of them in time (some later, some sooner) become _paralitick_,\r\nand dye _hectick_.\r\n\r\nWe saw there a man, who had not been in the Mines for above half a year\r\nbefore, so full of _Mercury_, that putting a piece of _Brass_ in his mouth,\r\nor rubbing it in his fingers, it immediately became white like Silver: I\r\nmean he did the same effect, as if he had rubb'd _Mercury_ upon it, and so\r\nparalitick, that he could not with both his hands carry a Glass, half full\r\nof Wine, to his mouth without spilling it, though he loved it too well to\r\nthrow it away.\r\n\r\nI have been since informed, that here in _Venice_, those that work on the\r\nback-side of Looking-glasses, are also very subject to the _Palsey_. I did\r\nnot observe, that they had black Teeth; it may be therefore, that we accuse\r\n_Mercury_ injustly for spoiling the Teeth, when given in _Venereal_\r\ndiseases. I confess, I did not think of it upon the place; but, black Teeth\r\nbeing so very rare in this Country, I think I could not but have markt it,\r\nhad all theirs been so.\r\n\r\nThey use exceeding great quantity of Wood, in making and repairing the\r\nEngins, and in the Furnaces (whereof there are 16. each of them carrying\r\n24. Retorts;) but principally in the Mines, which need continual\r\nreparation, the Fir-trees lasting but a small time under ground. They\r\nconvey their Wood thus: About four miles from the Mines, on the sides of\r\ntwo mountains, they cut down the Trees, and draw them into the interjacent\r\nValley, higher in the same Valley, so that the Trees, according to the\r\ndescent of the water lye betwixt it and _Idria_: with vast charges and\r\nquantities of Wood they made a Lock or Dam, that suffers not any water to\r\npass; they expect afterwards till there be water enough to float these\r\nTrees to _Idria_; for, if there be not a spring, (as generally there is,)\r\nRain, or the melting of the Snow, in a short time, afford so much water, as\r\nis ready to run over the Dam, and which (the Flood-gates being open'd)\r\ncarries all the Trees impetuously to _Idria_, where the Bridge is built\r\nvery strong, and at very oblique Angles to the stream, on purpose to stop\r\nthem, and throw them on shore neer the Mines. {25}\r\n\r\nThose Mines cost the _Emperour_ heretofore 70000. or 80000. _Florens_\r\nyearly, and yielded less _Mercury_ than at present, although it costs him\r\nbut 28000. _Florens_ now. You may see what his Imperial Majesty gets by the\r\nfollowing account, of what _Mercury_ the Mines of _Idria_ have produced\r\nthese last three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n          1661.            l.\r\n  Ordinary _Mercury_     198481\r\n  Virgin _Mercury_         6194\r\n                        --------\r\n                         204675\r\n                        --------\r\n\r\n          1662.            l.\r\n  Ordinary _Mercury_     225066\r\n  Virgin _Mercury_         9612\r\n                        --------\r\n                         234678\r\n                        --------\r\n\r\n          1663.            l.\r\n  Ordinary _Mercury_     244119\r\n  Virgin _Mercury_        11862\r\n                        --------\r\n                         255981\r\n                        --------\r\n\r\nThere are alwaies at work 280 persons, according to the relation I received\r\nfrom a very civil person, who informed me also of all the other particulars\r\nabove mentioned, whose name is _Achatio Kappenjagger_; his Office,\r\n_Contra-scrivano per sua Maestà Cesarea in Idria del Mercurio_.\r\n\r\nTo give some light to this Narrative, take this Diagramme: F. is the water,\r\nC. B. a vessel, into which it runs. DG. EH. FI. are streams perpetually\r\nissuing from that vessel; D. E. F. three sives, the distance of whose wires\r\nat bottom lessen proportionably. G. the place, wherein the Earth, that\r\npass'd through the sive D. is retained; from whence 'tis taken by the\r\nsecond man; and what passes through the sive E. is retained in H. and so of\r\nthe rest. K. L. M. wast water, which is so much impregnated with _Mercury_,\r\nthat it cureth Itches and sordid Ulcers. See Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI will trespass a little more upon you, in describing the contrivance of\r\nblowing the Fire in the _Brassworks_ of _Tivoli_ neer _Rome_ (it being new\r\nto me) where the Water blows the Fire, not by moving the Bellows, (which is\r\ncommon) but by affording the Wind.

Stopping the hole E, there is a perpetual strong wind,\r\nissuing forth at G: and G. being stopt, the wind comes out so vehemently at\r\nE, that it will, I believe, make a Ball play, like that at _Frescati_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Extract of a Letter, containing some Observations, made in the ordering\r\nof _Silk-worms_, communicated by that known _Vertuoso_, Mr. _Dudley\r\nPalmer_, from the ingenuous Mr. _Edward Digges_._\r\n\r\nI herewith offer to your _Society_ a small parcel of my _Virginian_ Silk.\r\nWhat I have observed in the ordering of Silk-worms, contrary to the\r\nreceived opinion, is:\r\n\r\n1. That I have kept leaves 24. hours after they are gathered, and flung\r\nwater upon them to keep them from withering; yet when (without wiping the\r\nleaves) I fed the worms, I observed, they did as well as those fresh\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\n2. I never observed, that the smell of _Tobacco_, or smels that are rank,\r\ndid any waies annoy the worm.\r\n\r\n3. Our country of _Virginia_ is very much subject to Thunders: and it hath\r\nthundered exceedingly when I have had worms of all sorts, some newly\r\nhatched; some half way in their feeding; others spinning their Silk; yet I\r\nfound none of them concern'd in the Thunder, but kept to their business, as\r\nif there had been no such thing.\r\n\r\n4. I have made many bottoms of the Brooms (wherein hundreds of worms spun)\r\nof _Holly_; and the prickles were so far from hurting them, that even from\r\nthose prickles they first began to make their bottoms.\r\n\r\nI did hope with this to have given you assurance, that by retarding the\r\nhatching of seed, two crops of silk or more {27} might be made in a Summer:\r\nbut my servants have been remiss in what was ordered, I must crave your\r\npatience till next year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An account of _Micrographia_, or the _Physiological Descriptions_ of\r\n_Minute Bodies_, made by _Magnifying Glasses_._\r\n\r\nThe Ingenious and knowing Author of this _Treatise_, Mr. _Robert Hook_,\r\nconsidering with himself, of what importance a faithful _History of Nature_\r\nis to the establishing of a solid Systeme of _Natural Philosophy_, and what\r\nadvantage _Experimental_ and _Mechanical_ knowledge hath over the\r\nPhilosophy of _discourse_ and _disputation_, and making it, upon that\r\naccount, his constant business to bring into that vast Treasury what\r\nportion he can, hath lately published a Specimen of his abilities in this\r\nkind of study, which certainly is very welcome to the Learned and\r\nInquisitive world, both for the _New discoveries_ in _Nature_, and the _New\r\nInventions_ of _Art_.\r\n\r\nAs to the _former_, the Attentive Reader of this Book will find, that there\r\nbeing hardly any thing so small, as by the help of _Microscopes_, to escape\r\nour enquiry, a new visible world is discovered by this means, and the Earth\r\nshews quite a new thing to us, so that in every _little particle_ of its\r\nmatter, we may now behold almost as great a variety of creatures, as we\r\nwere able before to reckon up in the whole _Universe_ it self. Here our\r\nAuthor maketh it not improbable, but that, by these helps the subtilty of\r\nthe composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various\r\ntexture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward\r\nmotions, and all the other appearances of things, may be more fully\r\ndiscovered; whence may emerge many admirable advantages towards the\r\nenlargement of the _Active_ and _Mechanick_ part of knowledge, because we\r\nmay perhaps be enabled to discern the secret {28} workings of _Nature_,\r\nalmost in the same manner, as we do those that are the productions of\r\n_Art_, and are managed by _Wheels_, and _Engines_, and _Springs_, that were\r\ndevised by Humane wit. To this end, he hath made a very curious _Survey_ of\r\nall kinds of bodies, beginning with the _Point of a Needle_, and proceeding\r\nto the _Microscopical_ view of the _Edges_ of _Rasors, Fine Lawn, Tabby,\r\nWatered Silks, Glass-canes, Glass-drops, Fiery Sparks, Fantastical Colours,\r\nMetalline Colours, the Figures of Sand, Gravel in Urine, Diamonds in\r\nFlints, Frozen Figures, the Kettering Stone, Charcoal, Wood and other\r\nBodies petrified, the Pores of Cork, and of other substances, Vegetables\r\ngrowing on blighted Leaves, Blew mould and Mushromes, Sponges, and other\r\nFibrous Bodies, Sea-weed, the Surfaces of some Leaves, the stinging points\r\nof a Nettle, Cowage, the Beard of a wild Oate, the seed of the Corn-violet,\r\nas also of Tyme, Poppy and Purslane._ He continues to describe _Hair, the\r\nscales of a Soal, the sting of a Bee, Feathers_ in general, and in\r\nparticular those of _Peacocks; the feet of Flies; and other Insects; the\r\nWings and Head of a Fly; the Teeth of a Snail; the Eggs of Silk-worms; the\r\nBlue Fly; a water Insect; the Tufted Gnat; a White Moth; the\r\nShepheards-spider; the Hunting Spider, the Ant; the wandring Mite; the\r\nCrab-like insect, the Book-worm, the Flea, the Louse, Mites, Vine mites._\r\nHe concludeth with taking occasion to discourse of two or three very\r\nconsiderable subjects, viz. _The inflexion of the Rays of Lights in the\r\nAir; the Fixt stars; the Moon._\r\n\r\nIn representing these particulars to the Readers view, the Author hath not\r\nonly given proof of his singular skil in delineating all sorts of Bodies\r\n(he having drawn all the _Schemes_ of these 60 _Microscopical_ objects with\r\nhis own hand) and of his extraordinary care of having them so curiously\r\nengraven by the Masters of that Art; but he hath also suggested in the\r\nseveral reflexions, made upon these Objects, such conjectures, as are\r\nlikely to excite and quicken the Philosophical heads to very noble\r\ncontemplations. Here are found inquiries concerning the _Propagation of\r\nLight_ through {29} differing mediums; concerning _Gravity_, concerning the\r\n_Roundness_ of Fruits, stones, and divers artificial bodies; concerning\r\n_Springiness_ and _Tenacity_; concerning the _Original_ of _Fountains_;\r\nconcerning the _dissolution of Bodies into Liquors_; concerning\r\n_Filtration_, and the ascent of Juices in Vegetables, and the use of their\r\n_Pores_. Here an attempt is made of solving the strange _Phænomena_ of\r\n_Glass-drops_; experiments are alleged to prove the _Expansion_ of _Glass_\r\nby heat, and the _Contraction_ of _heated-Glass_ upon cooling; _Des Cartes_\r\nhis _Hypothesis of Colours_ is examined: the _cause of Colours_, most\r\nlikely to the Author, is explained: Reasons are produced, that _Reflection_\r\nis not necessary to produce _colours_, nor a _double refraction_: some\r\nconsiderable _Hypotheses_ are _offered_, for the explication of Light by\r\nMotion; for the producing of all colours by Refraction; for reducing all\r\nsorts of colours to two only, _Yellow_ and _Blew_; for making the _Air_, a\r\ndissolvent of all _Combustible Bodies_: and for the explicating of all the\r\nregular figures of _Salt_, where he alleges many notable instances of the\r\n_Mathematicks_ of _Nature_, as having even in those things which we account\r\nvile, rude & course, shewed abundance of curiosity and excellent _Geometry_\r\nand _Mechanism_. And here he opens a large field for inquiries, and\r\nproposeth Models for prosecuting them, 1. By making a full collection of\r\nall the differing kinds of _Geometricall_ figur'd bodies; 2. By getting\r\nwith them an exact History of their places where they are generated or\r\nfound: 3. By making store of Tryals in Dissolutions and Coagulations of\r\nseveral Crystallizing Salts: 4. By making trials on metalls, Minerals and\r\nStones, by dissolving them in severall _Menstruums_, and Crystallizing\r\nthem, to see what Figures will arise from those several compositums: 5. By\r\ncompounding & coagulating several Salts together into the same mass, to\r\nobserve the Figure of that product: 6. By inquiring the closenes or rarity\r\nof the texture of those bodys by examining their gravity, and their\r\nrefraction, &c. 7. By examining what operations the fire hath upon several\r\nkinds of Salts, what changes it causes in their figures, Textures, or {30}\r\nVertues. 8. By examining their manner of dissolution, or acting upon those\r\nbodies dissoluble in them and the Texture of those bodies before and after\r\nthe process. 9. By considering, by what and how many means, such and such\r\nfigures, actions and effects could be produced, and which of them might be\r\nthe most likely, &c.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to offer his thoughts about the Pores of bodies, and a _kind_ of\r\n_Valves_ in wood; about spontaneous generation arising from the\r\nPutrefaction of bodies; about the nature of the Vegetation of mold,\r\nmushromes, moss, spunges; to the last of which he scarce finds any Body\r\nlike it in texture. He adds, from the naturall contrivance, that is found\r\nin the leaf of a Nettle, how the stinging pain is created, and thence takes\r\noccasion to discourse of the poysoning of Darts. He subjoyns a curious\r\ndescription of the shape, _Mechanism_ and use of the _sting_ of a _Bee_;\r\nand shews the admirable Providence of Nature in the contrivance and fabrick\r\nof _Feathers_ for Flying. He delivers those particulars about the Figure,\r\nparts and use of the head, feet, and wings of a Fly, that are not common.\r\nHe observes the various wayes of the generations of Insects, and discourses\r\nhandsomely of the means, by which they seem to act so prudently. He taketh\r\nnotice of the _Mechanical_ reason of the _Spider's_ Fabrick, and maketh\r\npretty Observations on the hunting Spider, and other Spiders and their\r\nWebs. And what he notes of a Flea, Louse, Mites, and Vinegar-worms, cannot\r\nbut exceedingly please the curious Reader.\r\n\r\nHaving dispatched these Matters, the Author offers his Thoughts for the\r\nexplicating of many _Phænomena_ of the Air, from the _Inflexion_, or from a\r\n_Multiplicate Refraction_ of the rays of Light within the Body of the\r\n_Atmosphere_, and not from a _Refraction_ caused by any terminating\r\n_superficies_ of the Air above, nor from any such exactly defin'd\r\n_superficies_ within the body of the _Atmosphere_; which conclusion he\r\ngrounds upon this, that a _medium_, whose parts are unequally _dense_, and\r\nmov'd by various motions and transpositions as to one another, will produce\r\nall these {31} visible effects upon the rays of Light, without any other\r\n_coefficient_ cause: and then, that there is in the Air or _Atmosphere,\r\nsuch_ a variety in the constituent parts of it, both as to their _density_\r\nand _rarity_, and as to their divers mutations and positions one to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nHe concludeth with two _Celestial Observations_; whereof the _one_ imports,\r\nwhat multitudes of Stars are discoverable by the _Telescope_, and the\r\nvariety of their magnitudes; intimating with all, that the longer the\r\nGlasses are, and the bigger apertures they will indure, the more fit they\r\nare for these discoveries: the _other_ affords a description of a _Vale_ in\r\nthe _Moon_, compared with that of _Hevelius_ and _Ricciolo_; where the\r\nReader will find several curious and pleasant Annotations, about the Pits\r\nof the _Moon_, and the Hills and Coverings of the same; as also about the\r\nvariations in the _Moon_, and its _gravitating_ principle, together with\r\nthe use, that may be made of this Instance of a gravity in the _Moon_.\r\n\r\nAs to the _Inventions of Art_, described in this Book, the curious Reader\r\nwill there find these following:\r\n\r\n1. A _Baroscope_, or an Instrument to shew all the Minute Variations in the\r\n_Pressure of the Air_; by which he affirms, that he finds, that before and\r\nduring the time of rainy weather, the Pressure of the Air is less; and in\r\ndry weather, but especially when an _Easterly_ Wind (which having past over\r\nvast Tracts of Land, is heavy with earthy particles) blows, it is much\r\nmore, though these changes be varied according to very odd Laws.\r\n\r\n2. A _Hygroscope_, or an Instrument, whereby the _Watery steams_, volatile\r\nin the Air, are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find.\r\nWhich is by him fully described in the Observation touching the _Beard of a\r\nwild Oate_, by the means whereof this Instrument is contrived.\r\n\r\n3. An Instrument for _graduating Thermometers_, to make them _Standards_ of\r\n_Heat_ and _Cold_.\r\n\r\n4. A _New Engine_ for _Grinding Optick Glasses_, by means of which he\r\nhopes, that any Spherical Glasses, of what length {32} soever, may be\r\nspeedily made: which seems to him most easie, because, if it succeeds, with\r\none and the same Tool may be ground an _Object Glass_ of any length or\r\nbreadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the\r\n_Engine_, and without much skill in the _Grinder_. He thinks it very exact,\r\nbecause to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and rectifie the\r\n_Tool_ to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the _Tool_ and _Glass_\r\nare wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of the desired\r\nFigure. He affirms further, that the motions of the Glass and Tool do so\r\ncross each other, that there is not one point of eithers surface, but hath\r\nthousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of\r\n_Rings_ or _Gutters_ made, either in the _Tool_ or _Glass_.\r\n\r\n5. A _New Instrument_, by which the _Refraction_ of all kinds of Liquors\r\nmay be exactly measured, thereby to give the Curious an opportunity of\r\nmaking Trials of that kind, to establish the _Laws_ of _Refraction_, to\r\nwit, whether the _Sines of the Angles of Refraction are respectively\r\nproportionable to the Sines of the Angles of Incidence:_ This Instrument\r\nbeing very proper to examine very accurately, and with little trouble, and\r\nin small quantities, the _Refraction_ of any Liquor, not only for _one_\r\ninclination, but for _all_; whereby he is enabled to make accurate\r\n_Tables_. By the same also he affirms to have found it true, that what\r\n_proportion_ the _Sine_ of the Angle of the one _inclination_ has to the\r\n_Sine_ of its Angle of _Refraction_, correspondent to it, the same\r\nproportion have all the other _Sines_ of Inclination to their respective\r\n_Sines_ of _Refractions_.\r\n\r\nLastly, this Author despairs not that there may be found many Mechanical\r\nInventions, to improve our Senses of _Hearing, Smelling, Tasting,\r\nTouching_, as well as we have improved that of _Seeing_ by _Optick\r\nGlasses_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon, Printed with Licence for _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_,\r\nPrinters to the _Royal Society_.\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numb._ 3.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _May_ 8. 1665.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _Some Observations and Experiments upon _May-dew_.

An Account of Mr. _Boyle's_\r\n    Experimental _History_ of_ Cold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations and Experiments upon _May-Dew_._\r\n\r\nThat ingenious and inquisitive Gentleman, Master _Thomas Henshaw_, having\r\nhad occasion to make use of a great quantity of _May-dew_, did, by several\r\ncasual Essayes on that Subject, make the following Observations and Tryals,\r\nand present them to the _Royal Society_. {34}\r\n\r\nThat _Dew_ newly gathered and filtred through a clean Linnen cloth, though\r\nit be not very clear, is of a yellowish Colour, somewhat approaching to\r\nthat of Urine.\r\n\r\nThat having endevoured to putrefy it by putting several proportions into\r\nGlass bodies with blind heads, and setting them in several heats, as of\r\ndung, and gentle baths, he quite failed of his intention: for heat, though\r\nnever so gentle, did rather clarify, and preserve it sweet, though\r\ncontinued for two moneths together, then cause any putrefaction or\r\nseparation of parts.\r\n\r\nThat exposing of it to the Sun for a whole Summer in Glasses, that hold\r\nabout two Gallons, with narrow mouths, that might be stopp'd with Cork, the\r\nonly considerable alteration, he observed to be produced in it, was, that\r\nStore of green stuff (such as is seen in Summer in ditches and standing\r\nwaters) floated on the top, and in some places, grew to the sides of the\r\nGlass.\r\n\r\nThat putting four or five Gallons of it into a half Tub, as they call it,\r\nof Wood, and straining a Canvas over it, to keep out Dust and Insects, and\r\nletting it stand in some shady room for three weeks or a month, it did of\r\nitself putrefy and stink exceedingly, and let fall to the bottom a black\r\nsediment like Mudd.\r\n\r\nThat, coming often to see, what Alterations appeared in the putrefaction,\r\nHe observed, that at the beginning, within twenty four hours, a slimy film\r\nfloated on the top of the water, which after a while falling to the bottom,\r\nthere came another such film in its place.\r\n\r\nThat if _Dew_ were put into a long narrow Vessel of Glass, such as formerly\r\nwere used for Receivers in distilling of _Aqua Fortis_, the slime would\r\nrise to that height, that He could take it off with a Spoon; and when he\r\nhad put a pretty quantity of it into a drinking Glass, and that it had\r\nstood all night, and the water dreined from it, if He had turned it out of\r\nhis hand, it would stand upright in figure of the Glass, in substance like\r\nboyled white Starch, though something more transparent, if his memory\r\n(_saith he_) fail him not.\r\n\r\nThat having once gotten a pretty quantity of this gelly, and put it into a\r\nGlass body and Blind-head, He set it into a gentle {35} Bath with an\r\nintention to have putrefied it, but after a few days He found, the head had\r\nnot been well luted on, and that some moisture exhaling, the gelly was\r\ngrown almost dry, and a large _Mushrom_ grown out of it within the Glass.\r\nIt was of a loose watrish contexture, such an one, as he had seen growing\r\nout of rotten wood.\r\n\r\nThat having several Tubs with good quantity of _Dew_ in them, set to\r\nputrefy in the manner abovesaid, and comming to pour out of one of them to\r\nmake use of it, He found in the water a great bunch, bigger than his fist,\r\nof those Insects commonly called _Hog-lice_ or _Millepedes_, tangled\r\ntogether by their long tailes, one of which came out of every one of their\r\nbodies, about the bigness of a Horsehair: The Insects did all live and move\r\nafter they were taken out.\r\n\r\nThat emptying another Tub, whereon the Sun, it seems, had used sometimes to\r\nshine, and finding, upon the straining it through a clean linnen cloth, two\r\nor three spoonfulls of green stuff, though not so thick nor so green as\r\nthat above mentioned, found in the Glasses _purposely_ exposed to the Sun,\r\nHe put this green stuff in a Glass, and tyed a paper over it, and coming\r\nsome dayes after to view it, He found the Glass almost filled with an\r\ninnumerable Company of small Flyes, almost all wings, such as are usually\r\nseen in great Swarms in the Aire in Summer Evenings.\r\n\r\nThat setting about a Gallon of this _Dew_ (which, he saith, if he\r\nmisremember not, had been first putrefied and strained) in an open\r\nJarre-Glass with a wide mouth, and leaving it for many weeks standing in a\r\nSouth-window, on which the Sun lay very much, but the Casements were kept\r\nclose shut; after some time coming to take account of his _Dew_, He found\r\nit very full of little Insects with great Heads and small tapering Bodies,\r\nsomewhat resembling Tadpoles, but very much less. These, on his approach to\r\nthe Glass, would sink down to the bottom, as it were to hide themselves,\r\nand upon his retreat wrigle themselves up to the top of the water again.\r\nLeaving it thus for some time longer, He afterwards found the room very\r\nfull of Gnats, though the Door and Windows were kept shut. He adds, that He\r\ndid not at first suspect, that those Gnats had any {36} relation to the\r\n_Dew_, but after finding the Gnats to be multiplied and the little watry\r\nAnimals to be much lessened in quantity, and finding great numbers of their\r\nempty skins floating on the face of his _Dew_, He thought, he had just\r\nreason to perswade himself, the Gnats were by a second Birth produced of\r\nthose little Animals.\r\n\r\nThat vapouring away great quantities of his putrefied _Dew_ in Glass\r\nBasons, and other Earthen glased Vessels, He did at last obtain, as he\r\nremembers, above two pound of _Grayish Earth_, which when he had washed\r\nwith more of the same _Dew_ out of all his Basons into one, and vapoured to\r\nsiccity, lay in leaves one above another, not unlike to some kind of brown\r\nPaper, but very friable.\r\n\r\nThat taking this Earth out, and after he had well ground it on a Marble,\r\nand given it a smart Fire, in a coated Retort of Glass, it soon melted and\r\nbecame a Cake in the bottom, when it was cold, and looked as if it had been\r\nSalt and Brimstone in a certain proportion melted together; but, as he\r\nremembers, was not at all inflamable. This ground again on a Marble, _he\r\nsaith_, did turn Spring water of a reddish purple Colour.\r\n\r\nThat by often calcining and filtring this Earth, He did at last extract\r\nabout two ounces of a fine small _white Salt_, which, looked on through a\r\ngood _Microscope_, seemed to have Sides and Angles in the same number and\r\nfigure, as _Rochpeeter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Motion of the _Second_ Comet predicted, by the same Gentleman, who\r\npredicted that of the _former_._\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Auzout_, the same Person, that not long since communicated to the\r\nWorld his _Ephemerides_ touching the course of the former _Comet_, and\r\nrecommended several Copies of them to the _Royal Society_, to compare their\r\nObservations with his Account, and thereby, either to verifie his\r\nPredictions, or to shew, wherein they differ, hath lately sent another\r\n_Ephemerides_ concerning the Motion of the Second _Comet_, to the same end,\r\nthat invited him to send the other. {37}\r\n\r\nIn that Tract he observes, first in _General_, that this second _Comet_ is\r\ncontrary to the precedent, almost in all particulars: seeing that the\r\n_former_ moved very swift, _this_, pretty slow; _that_ against the Order of\r\nthe signs from East to West, _this_, following them, from West to East:\r\n_that_, from South to North, _this_, from North to South, as far as it hath\r\nbeen hitherto, that we hear off, observed: _that_, on the side opposite to\r\nthe Sun, _this_, on the same side: _that_, having been in its _Perigee_ at\r\nthe time of its Opposition, _this_, having been there, out of the time of\r\nits Conjunction: where he taketh also notice, that this _Comet_ differs in\r\nbrightness from the other, as well in its Body, which is far more vivid and\r\ndistinct, as in its _Train_, whose splendor is much greater, since it may\r\nbe seen even with great _Telescopes_, which were useless in the former, by\r\nreason of its dimness. After this he descends to particulars, and informs\r\nus, that he began to observe this Comet _April_ the second, and continued\r\nfor some days following, and that as soon as he had made three or four\r\nObservations, he resolved to try again an _Ephemerides_; but that, having\r\nno instruments exact enough, and the Comet being in a place, destitute of\r\nStars, and subject to Refractions, he feared to venture too much upon\r\nObservations so neer one another, since in such matters a perfect exactness\r\nis necessary, and wished to see some precedent Observations to direct him:\r\nwhich having obtained, he thereby verified what he had begun, and resolved\r\nto carry on his intended _Ephemerides_, especially being urged by his\r\nFriends, and engaged by his former undertaking, that so it might not be\r\nthought a meer hazard, that made him hit in the former; as also, that he\r\nmight try, whether his Method would succeed as well in slower, as in\r\nswifter Comets, and in those, that are neer the Sun; as in such as are\r\nopposite thereunto, to the end, that men might be advertised of the\r\n_determination_ of its use, if it could not serve but in certain particular\r\nCases.\r\n\r\nHe relateth therefore, that he had finished this New _Ephemerides_ _April_\r\nthe sixth, and put it presently to the Press; in doing of which, he hopes,\r\nhe hath not disobliged the Publick: seeing that, though we should loose the\r\nsight of this Star within a few days, by reason of its approach to the Sun,\r\nyet having found, {38} that it is always to rise before the Sun, and that\r\nwe may again see it better, when it shall rise betimes, towards the end of\r\n_May_, and in the beginning of _June_, if the cleerness of the Day-break\r\nhinder us not; he thought it worth the while to try, whether the truth of\r\nthis _Ephemerides_ could be proved.\r\n\r\nHe affirms then, that the _Line_ described by this Star resembles hitherto\r\na _Great Circle_, as it is found in all other Comets in the midst of their\r\nCourse. He finds the said Circle inclined to the _Ecliptick_ about 26. d.\r\n30'. and the _Nodes_, where it cuts it, towards the beginning of _Gemini_\r\nand _Sagittary_; that it declines from the _Equator_ about 26. _d_ and cuts\r\nit towards the 11. d. and consequently, that its greatest _Latitude_ hath\r\nbeen towards _Pisces_, where it must have been _March_ 24. and its greatest\r\n_Declination_, towards the 25 d. of the _Equator_, where it was to have\r\nbeen _April_ 11.\r\n\r\nHe puts it in its _Perigee_ _March_ 27. about three of the Clock in the\r\nAfternoon, when it was about the 15 degrees of _Pisces_, a little more\r\n_Westerly_ then _Marshab_, or the _Wing_ of _Pegasus_, and that it was to\r\nbe in _Conjunction_ with the _Sun_, _April_ 9. Where yet he noteth, that\r\naccording to another Calculation, the _Perigee_ was _March_ 27. more\r\ntowards Night, so that the Comet advances a little more towards the _East_,\r\nand retards towards the _West_; which not being very sensible in the first\r\ndays, differs more about the end, and in the beginning; which he leaves to\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nHe calculateth, that the greatest Motion it could make in one day, hath\r\nbeen 4. d. and 8'. or 9'; in one hour, about 10'. and 25\". so that its\r\n_Diurnal Motion_ is to its last distance from the Earth a little more than\r\nas 1. to 14. and its _Hourly Motion_, as 1. to 330.\r\n\r\nHe wonders, that it hath not been seen sooner; the first Observations that\r\nhe hath seen, but made by others, being of _March_ 17. Whereas he finds,\r\nthat it might have been seen since _January_, at least in the Months of\r\n_February_ and _March_, when it rose at 2 of the Clock and before: because\r\nit is very likely, that, considering its bigness and brightness, when it\r\nwas towards its _Perigee_, it was visible, since that towards the end of\r\n_February_ it was not three times as much remote from the Earth, than when\r\nit was in its _Perigee_, and that towards the end of _January_ it was not\r\nfive times as much. {39}\r\n\r\nIn the interim, _saith he_, the other _Comet_ could be seen with the naked\r\neye until _January_ 31. when it was more than ten times further remote,\r\nthan in its _Perigee_, although it was not by far so bright, nor its\r\nstreamer shining as this hath appeared.\r\n\r\nHe wishes, that all the changes that shall fall out in this _Comet_, might\r\nbe exactly observ'd; because of its not being swift, and the Motion of the\r\nEarth very sensible, unless the _Comet_ be extreamly remote, we should find\r\nmuch more light from this, than the former Star, about the Grand Question,\r\nwhether the _Earth_ moves or not; this Author having all along entertained\r\nhimself with the hopes, that the Motion of _Comets_ would evince, whether\r\nthe _Earth_ did move or not; and this very _Comet_ seemed to him to have by\r\ndesign appeared for that end, if it had had more _Latitude_, and that\r\nconsequently we might have seen it before Day break. He wishes also, that,\r\nif possible, it may be accurately observed, whether it will not a little\r\ndecline from its great Circle towards the _South_; Judging, that some\r\nimportant truth may be thence deduced, as well as if its motion retarded\r\nmore, than the place of its _Perigee_ (which will be more exactly known\r\nwhen all the passed Observations shall have been obtained) and its greatest\r\nMotion do require.\r\n\r\nHe fears only, that it being then to rise at Break of Day, exact\r\nObservations cannot be made of it: but he would, at least have it sought\r\nwith _Telescopes_, his _Ephemerides_ directing whereabout it is to be.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10. it was to be over against the point of the _Triangle_, and from\r\nthence more _Southerly_ by more than two degrees; and _April_ 11. over\r\nagainst the bright Star of _Aries_, _April_ 17. over against the Stars of\r\nthe _Fly_, a little more _Southerly_, and _May_ 4 it is to be over against\r\nthe _Pleiades_, and about the fourth or fifth of the same Month, it is to\r\nbe once more in _Conjunction_ with the _Sun_; after which time, the _Sun_\r\nwill move from it _Eastward_, and leave it towards the _West_; which will\r\nenable us to see it again at a better hour, provided the cleerness of the\r\nDay-break be no impediment to us. He addeth, that this Star must have been\r\nthe third time in _Conjunction_ with the _Sun_, about the time when it\r\nfirst began to appear: and foresees, that from all these particulars many\r\nconsiderable consequences may be deduced. {40}\r\n\r\nIt will cut the _Ecliptick_ about the end of _July_, new Style, a little\r\nmore _Eastwards_ than the _Eye_ of _Taurus_; at which time there will be no\r\nseeing of it, except it be with a _Telescope_.\r\n\r\nIt will be towards the _End_ of _April_, new style, twice as far distant as\r\nit was in _Perigee_, thrice as far, _May_ the fourth, four times, _May_ the\r\neighteenth, and five times, _June_ the first, &c.\r\n\r\nHe would not have Men surprised, that there have been two _Comets_ within\r\nso short a time; seeing, _saith he_, there were four, at least three, in\r\nthe Year 1618. and in other Years there have been two and more at the same\r\ntime. What he adds about their signification, we leave to _Astrologers_ to\r\ndispute it with him. He concludeth with asking pardon, if he have committed\r\nmistakes, which he hopeth he shall obtain the sooner, because of the small\r\ntime he hath had for these calculations; and he wishes that he could have\r\nmade all the Observations himself, seeing that it is easie to fail, when\r\none must trust to the Observations of others, whereof we know not the\r\nexactness: where he instanceth, that according to his Observations, the way\r\nof the _Comet_ should go neerer the Ecliptick than he hath marked it, even\r\nwithout having any great regard to the Refractions: but since he would\r\nsubject himself to others, he hath made it pass a little higher, which, he\r\nsaith, was almost insensibly so, in those few days that he was observing\r\nand writing, but that this may perhaps become sensible hereafter; which if\r\nit be so, he affirms that it will cut the _Ecliptick_ and _Equator_ sooner,\r\nthan he hath marked it, &c. However, he thinks it convenient, to have given\r\naforehand a common Notion of what will become of a _Comet_, to prepare men\r\nfor all the Changes that may fall out concerning it: which he affirms he\r\nhath endeavoured to do; the rest being easie to correct, as soon as any\r\ngood Observations, somewhat distant, have been obtained, considering, that\r\nthere need but two very exact ones, a little distant when the Star is not\r\nswift, to trace its Way; although there must be at least three, to find out\r\nall the rest. But, then would he have it considered, that although his\r\nMethod should be very exact, if there be not at hand Instruments big\r\nenough, and Globes good enough to trust to, nothing can be done perfectly\r\nin these kind of Predictions. {41}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of the advice given by Monsieur _Petit_, Intendant of the\r\nFortifications of _Normandy_, touching the Conjunction of the _Ocean_ and\r\n_Mediterranean_._\r\n\r\nThis Intelligent Gentleman, Monsieur _Petit_, having been consulted with,\r\ntouching the Conjunction of the _Ocean_ and _Mediterranean_, delivers first\r\nthe Proposition, and then giveth his thoughts upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition is, That there being about two Leagues below _Castres_ in\r\n_Languedoc_ a Rivolet, called _Sor_, passing to _Revel_, there may by the\r\nmeans thereof be made a Communication of the two Seas, by joyning the\r\nWaters of this Rivolet by a Channel (to be kept full all the year long)\r\nwith those of St. _Papoul_, and others, which fall into _Fresqueil_\r\n(another small River) that runs into the _Aude_ below _Carcassone_, and go\r\ntogether to _Narbonne_, scituated upon the _Mediterranean_.\r\n\r\nHaving given the Proposition, he adds some particulars, to illustrate the\r\nsame, before he declares his judgment upon it. For he relateth, that there\r\nis but one way, after the division of the Waters, to pass to the\r\n_Mediterranean_, which is by a Rivolet, called _Fresqueil_, that is\r\nconjoyn'd with the _Aude_: But, to pass to the _Ocean_, there are three;\r\nOne, by _Riege_, entring into the _Caronne_ above _Tholouse_; the other, by\r\n_Lers_, passing on the side, and below the same Town; and the third, by\r\n_Sor_, falling into the River _Agoust_ under _Castres_, afterwards into the\r\n_Tarne_, and thence to _Montauban_, and lastly into the _Garonne_. And\r\nthat, to compass this design, all these Rivers and Rivolets are first to be\r\nmade Navigable unto their _Sluces_; that of _Aude_ and _Fresqueil_ for the\r\n_Mediterranean_, and one of the others, such as shall be chosen, for the\r\n_Ocean_. He addeth, that, as to the several Ways passing to the _Ocean_,\r\nall of them commended as proper and convenient, and the three Countries\r\nconcerned therein, speaking every one for their advantage: Those of\r\n_Castres_ and {42} _Montauban_, are for the River _Agoust_; those of\r\n_Tholouse_, for _Riege_; and the rest, for _Lers_.\r\n\r\nNow concerning his Opinion upon this Proposition, he thinks, that all that\r\nhath been represented touching this matter, can signifie very little,\r\nseeing that the main thing is wanting, which is the assurance, and certain\r\nand positive mensuration of the height and quantity of the Waters,\r\nnecessary to fall into both the Channels of the _Aude_ and _Caronne_: that\r\nthere must be plenty of that, to furnish at all times and alwayes the\r\nhighest and first _sluces_, since what once issues thence, doth never enter\r\nagain into them; and after some Boats are passed, if there should not be a\r\nsufficient supply for those that come after; either to go up, or to go\r\ndown, all would stand dry, and Merchants and their commodities would stay\r\nlong enough expecting the supply of Rains, to their great detriment. He\r\nconcludeth therefore, that no knowing and discreet Person is able, in\r\nmatters of this nature, to give a positive answer, without having before\r\nhim a large and exact Topographical Map of those places, and of the sources\r\nof all the Rivolets, that are to supply the Water to the Head of the\r\npretended Channel, together with a full account of the survey and\r\nmensuration of all the places, through which it is to pass; of the Nature\r\nof the Ground, whether it be stony, sandy, rocky, &c. of the exact level of\r\nall the places, where it is to be made, and of the several risings and\r\ndepressions thereof, to be assured that the Water may be conveyed to the\r\ngreatest rising, and to the highest _Sluce_; and lastly, of the quantity,\r\nthat may be had at high, middle, and low Water, to have enough for all\r\ntimes; that all these things being first made out, 'tis then time enough to\r\njudge of the possibility of the thing, and to calculate the charges\r\nnecessary for Execution.\r\n\r\nThis Artist having thus prudently waved this Proposition, diverts himself\r\nwith reflecting upon several others of the like nature, among which he\r\ninsists chiefly upon two, whereof one is that so much celebrated in\r\n_Egypt_; the other, of _Germany_. And he is of Opinion, that the most\r\nimportant of all is that, of conjoyning the _Red sea_ by the _Nile_ with\r\nthe _Mediterranean_, which he looks upon as the most excellent conveniency\r\nto go into the _East Indies_ without doubling the _Cape of Good Hope_; and\r\nyet it {43} could not be executed by those great Kings of _Egypt_, that\r\nraised so many stupendious _Pyramids_; although in his Opinion the reasons\r\nalleged by _Historians_ to justifie them for having abandoned that\r\nundertaking are of no validity, and that the _Red Sea_ cannot be, as they\r\nfeared, higher than the _Nile_, and therefore not indanger the inundation\r\nof _Egypt_.\r\n\r\nThe other Proposition was made to _Charles Magna_, _Anno_ 793. for joyning\r\nthe _Euxine_ Sea and the _Ocean_ together, by a Channel, which was begun\r\nfor that end, and designed to be 2000. paces long and 100. paces broad,\r\nbetwixt the River _Altmull_, falling into the _Danube_ above _Ratisbone_,\r\nand the River _Rott_, passing at _Nurenberg_, and thence running into the\r\n_Main_, and so into the _Rhine_. But yet this also proved abortive, though\r\nthere was great appearance of success at first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the Way of killing _Ratle-Snakes_._\r\n\r\nThere being not long since occasion given at a meeting of the _Royal\r\nSociety_ to discourse of _Ratle Snakes_, that worthy and inquisitive\r\nGentleman, Captain _Silas Taylor_, related the manner, how they were killed\r\nin _Virginia_, which he afterwards was pleased to give in writing, attested\r\nby two credible persons in whose presence it was done; which is, as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe Wild _Penny-royal_ or _Ditany_ of _Virginia_, groweth streight up about\r\none foot high, with the leaves like _Penny-royal_, with little blue tufts\r\nat the joyning of the branches to the Plant, the colour of the Leaves being\r\na reddish green, but the Water distilled, of the colour of Brandy, of a\r\nfair Yellow: the Leaves of it bruised are very hot biting upon the Tongue:\r\nand of these, so bruised, they took some, and having tyed them in the cleft\r\nof a long stick, they held them to the Nose of the _Ratle-Snake_, who by\r\nturning and wriggling laboured as much as she could to avoid it: but she\r\nwas killed with it, in less than half an hours time, and, as was supposed,\r\nby the scent thereof; which was done _Anno_ 1657. in the Month of _July_,\r\nat which season, they repute those creatures to be in the greatest vigour\r\nfor their poison. {44}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of Persons killed with subterraneous _Damps_._\r\n\r\nThis Relation was likewise made to the _Royal Society_, by that Eminent\r\n_Virtuoso_ Sir _R. Moray_, who was pleased, upon their desire, to give it\r\nthem in writing; as followeth.\r\n\r\nIn a Coal-pit, belonging to the Lord _Sinclair_ in _Scotland_, where the\r\nCoal is some 18 or 20 foot thick, and antiently wasted to a great depth:\r\nThe Colliers, some Weeks agoe, having wrought as deep as they could, and\r\nbeing to remove into new Rooms (as they call them) did, by taking off, as\r\nthey retired, part of the Coal that was left as Pillars to support the Roof\r\nand Earth over it, so much weaken them, that within a short space, after\r\nthey were gone out of the Pitt, the Pillars falling, the Earth above them\r\nfilled up the whole Space, where the Colliers had lately wrought, with its\r\nruins. The Colliers being here-by out of work, some of them adventured to\r\nwork upon old remains of Walls, so near the old wastes, that striking\r\nthrough the slender partition of the Coal-wall, that seperated between them\r\nand the place, where they used to work, they quickly perceived their\r\nErrour, and fearing to be stifled by the bad Air, that they knew, possessed\r\nthese old wastes, in regard not onely of the Damps, which such wastes do\r\nusually afford, but because there having for many years been a Fire in\r\nthose wastes, that filled them with stifling fumes and vapors, retired\r\nimmediately and saved themselves from the eruptions of the Damp. But next\r\nday some seven or eight of them came no sooner so farr down the staires,\r\nthat led them to the place where they had been the day before, as they\r\nintended, but upon their stepping into the place, where the Air was\r\ninfected, they fell down dead, as if they had been shott: And there being\r\namongst them one, whose Wife was informed he was stifled in that place, she\r\nwent down so far without inconvenience, that seeing her Husband near her,\r\nventured to go to him, but being choaked by the Damp, as soon as she came\r\nnear him, she fell down dead by him. {45}\r\n\r\nThis Story of Sir _R. Moray_ affirmed to have received from the _Earl_ of\r\n_Weymes_, Brother in Law to the Lord _Sinclair_, as it was written to him\r\nfrom _Scotland_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the _Mineral_ of _Liege_, yeilding both _Brimstone_ and _Vitriol_, and\r\nthe way of extracting them out of it, used at _Liege_._\r\n\r\nThe Account of this _Mineral_, and of the way of extracting both\r\n_Brimstone_ and _Vitriol_ out of it, was procured from _Liege_, by the\r\nlately mentioned Sir _Robert Moray_ and by him communicated to the _Royal\r\nSociety_, as follows.\r\n\r\nThe _Mineral_, out of which _Brimstone_ and _Vitriol_ are extracted, is one\r\nand the same, not much unlike Lead ore, having also oft times much Lead\r\nmingled with it, which is seperated from it by picking it out of the rest.\r\nThe Mines resemble our _English_ Coal Mines dugg according to the depth of\r\nthe _Mineral_, 15, 20, or more fathoms, as the Vein leads the Workmen, or\r\nthe subterranean waters will give them leave, which in Summer so overflow\r\nthe Mines, that the upper waters, by reason of the drought, not sufficing\r\nto make the Pumps goe, the Work ceases.\r\n\r\nTo make _Brimstone_, they break the Stone or Ore into small pieces, which\r\nthey put into Crucibles made of Earth, five foot long, square and\r\nPyramid-wise. The Entry is near a foot square. These Crucibles are laid\r\nsloaping, eight undermost, and seven above them, as it were betwixt them,\r\nthat the Fire may come at them all, each having its particular Furnace or\r\nOven. The _Brimstone_ being dissolved by the violence of the heat, drops\r\nout at the small end of the Crucible, and falls into a Leaden-Trough or\r\nReceptacle, common to all the said Crucibles, through which there runs a\r\ncontinual Rivolet of cold water, conveyed thither by Pipes for the cooling\r\nof the dissolved Sulphur, which is ordinarily four hours in melting. This\r\ndone, the Ashes are drawn out by a crooked Iron, and being put into an Iron\r\nWheel barrow, are carried out of the Hutt, and {46} being laid in a heap,\r\nare covered with other exiled or drained Ashes, the better to keep them\r\nwarm; which is reiterated, as long as they make _Brimstone_.\r\n\r\nTo make _Coperas_ or _Vitriol_, they take a quantity of the said Ashes, and\r\nthrowing them into a square planked pit in the Earth, some four foot deep,\r\nand eight foot square, they cover the same with ordinary water, and let it\r\nlye twenty four hours, or until an Egg will swim upon the liquor, which is\r\na sign, that it is strong enough. When they will boyl this, they let it run\r\nthrough Pipes into the Kettles, adding to it half as much Mother-water,\r\nwhich is that water, that remains after boyling of the hardned _Coperas_.\r\nThe Kettles are made of Lead, 4½ foot high, 6 foot long, and 3 foot broad,\r\nstanding upon thick Iron Barrs or Grates. In these the Liquor is boyled\r\nwith a strong Coal-fire, twenty four hours or more, according to the\r\nstrength or weakness of the Lee or Water. When it is come to a just\r\nconsistence, the fire is taken away, and the boyled liquor suffered to cool\r\nsomewhat, and then it is tapp'd out of the said Kettles, through holes\r\nbeneath in the sides of them, and conveyed through wooden Conduits into\r\nseveral Receptacles, three foot deep and four foot long (made and ranged\r\nnot unlike our Tan-pits) where it remains fourteen or fifteen dayes, or so\r\nlong till the _Coperas_ separate it self from the water, and becomes icy\r\nand hard. The remaining water is the above-mentioned Mother-water; and the\r\nelixed or drained Ashes are the Dregs, or _Caput mortuum_, which the Lee,\r\nwhereof the _Vitriol_ is made, leaves behind it in the planked Pits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A further Account of Mr. _Boyle_'s Experimental _History_ of _Cold_._\r\n\r\nIn the first Papers of these _Philosophical Transactions_, some promise was\r\nmade of a _fuller_ account, to be given by the next, of the _Experimental\r\nHistory of Cold_, composed by the Honourable Mr. _Robert Boyle_; it being\r\nthen supposed, that this _History_ would have been altogether printed off\r\nat the time of publishing the {47} _Second_ Papers of these _Transactions_;\r\nbut the Press, employed upon this Treatise, having been retarded somewhat\r\nlonger than was ghessed, the said promise could not be performed before\r\nthis time: wherein it now concerns the inquiring World to take notice, that\r\nthis subject, as it hath hitherto bin almost totally neglected, so it is\r\nnow, by this Excellent Author, in such a manner handled, and improved by\r\nnear _Two hundred_ choice _Experiments_ and _Observations_, that certainly\r\nthe _Curious_ and _Intelligent_ Reader will in the perusal thereof find\r\ncause to admire both the Fertility of a Subject, seemingly so barren, and\r\nthe Author's Abilities of improving the same to so high a Degree.\r\n\r\nBut to take a short view of some of the particulars of this _History_, and\r\nthereby to give occasion to _Philosophical_ men, to take this Subject more\r\ninto their consideration, than hitherto hath been done; the Ingenious\r\nReaders will here see,\r\n\r\n1, That not only all sorts of _Acid_ and _Alcalizate_ Salts, and Spirits,\r\neven Spirit of Wine, but also Sugar, and Sugar of Lead mixed with Snow, are\r\ncapable of freezing other Bodies, and upon what account they are so.\r\n\r\n2, That among the Substances capable of being frozen, there are not only\r\nall gross sorts of Saline Bodies, but such also as are freed from their\r\ngrosser parts, not excepting Spirit of Urine, the _Lixivium_ of Pot-ashes,\r\nnor Oyl of Tartar, _per deliquium_, it self.\r\n\r\n3, That many very spiritous liquors, freed from their aqueous parts, cannot\r\nbe brought to freeze, neither naturally, nor artificially: And here is\r\noccasionally mentioned a way of keeping _Moats_ unpassable in very cold\r\nCountries, recorded by _Olaus Magnus_.\r\n\r\n4, What are the ways proper to estimate the greater or lesser Coldness of\r\nBodies; and by what means we can measure the intensness of Cold produced by\r\nArt, beyond that, which Nature needs to employ for the freezing of Water;\r\nas also, in what proportion water of a moderate degree of Coldness will\r\n{48} be made to _shrink_ by Snow and Salt, before it begin by Congelation\r\nto _expand_ it self; and then, how to measure by the differing Weight and\r\nDensity of the same portion of Water, what change was produced in it,\r\nbetwixt the hottest time of Summer, and first glaciating degree of Cold,\r\nand then the highest, which our Author could produce by _Art_: Where an\r\nInquiry is annex'd, whether the making of these kind of Tryals with the\r\nwaters of the particular Rivers and Seas, men are to sail on, may afford\r\nany useful estimate, whether or not, and how much, ships may on those\r\nwaters be safely loaden more in Winter, than in Summer. To which is added\r\nthe way of making exact Discoveries of the differing degrees of Coldness in\r\ndiffering Regions, by such Thermometers, as are not subject to the\r\nalterations of the _Atmosphere's_ gravitation, nor to be frozen.\r\n\r\n5. Whether, in Cold, the diffusion from Cold Bodies be made more strongly\r\ndownwards, contrary to that of Hot Bodies: Where is delivered a way of\r\nfreezing Liquors without danger of breaking the Vessel, by making them\r\nbegin to freeze at the bottom, not the top.\r\n\r\n6. Whether that Tradition be true, that if frozen Apples or Eggs be thaw'd\r\nneer the Fire, they will be thereby spoil'd, but if immersed in cold water,\r\nthe Internal Cold will be drawn out, as is supposed, by the External Cold;\r\nand the frozen Bodies will be harmlesly thawed? _Item_, Whether Iron, or\r\nother Metals, Glass, Stone, Cheese, &c. expos'd to the freezing Air, or\r\nkept in Snow, or Salt, upon the immersing them in Water will produce any\r\nIce? _Item_, What use may be made of what happens in the different waies of\r\nthawing Eggs and Apples, by applying the Observation to other Bodies, and\r\neven to Men, dangerously nipp'd by excessive Cold. Where is added not only\r\na memorable Relation, how the whole Body of a Man was succesfully thawed\r\nand cased all over with Ice, by being handled, as frozen Eggs and Apples\r\nare; but also the Luciferousness of such Experiments, as these: and\r\nlikewise, what the effects of Cold may be, as to the Conservation or\r\nDestruction of the Textures of Bodies: and in particular, how Meat and\r\nDrink {49} may be kept good, in very Cold Countries, by keeping it under\r\nWater, without glaciation? as also, how in extreme Cold Countries, the\r\nBodies of Dead Men and other Animals may be preserved very many years\r\nentire and unputrified? And yet, how such Bodies, when unfrozen, will\r\nappear quite vitiated by the excessive Cold? Where it is further inquired\r\ninto, whether some Plants, and other Medicinal things, that have specifique\r\nVertues, will loose them by being throughly congealed and (several wayes)\r\nthawed? And also, whether frozen and thawed Harts-horn will yield the same\r\nquantity and strength of Salt and saline Spirit, as when unfrozen? _Item_,\r\nWhether the _Electrical_ faculty of _Amber_, and the _Attractive_ or\r\n_Directive_ Virtue of _Loadstones_ will be either impaired, or any wayes\r\naltered by intense Cold? This Head is concluded by some considerable\r\nremarks touching the operation of Cold upon Bones, Steel, Brass, Wood,\r\nBricks.\r\n\r\n7, What Bodies are expanded by being frozen, and how that expansion is\r\nevinced? And whether it is caused by the intrusion of Air? As also,\r\nwhether, what is contained in icy bubbles, is true and Springy Air, or not.\r\n\r\n8, What Bodies they are, that are contracted by Cold; and how that\r\nContraction is evinced? Where 'tis inquired, whether _Chymical Oyles_ will,\r\nby Congelation, be like expressed Oyls, contracted, or, like aqueous\r\nLiquors, expanded?\r\n\r\n9, What are the wayes of _Measuring_ the _Quantity_ of the Expansion and\r\nContraction of Liquors by Cold? And how the Author's account of this matter\r\nagrees with what Navigators into cold Climats, mention from experience,\r\ntouching pieces of Ice as high as the Masts of their Ships, and yet the\r\nDepth of these pieces seems not at all answerable to what it may be\r\nsupposed to be.\r\n\r\n10, How strong the Expansion of freezing water is? Where are enumerated the\r\nseveral sorts of Vessels, which being filled {50} with water, and exposed\r\nto the cold Air, do burst; and where also the weight is expressed, that\r\nwill be removed by the expansive force of Freezing? Whereunto an Inquiry is\r\nsubjoyned, whence this prodigious force, observed in water, expanded by\r\nGlaciation, should proceed? And whether this _Phænomenon_ may be solved,\r\neither by the _Cartesian_, or _Epicurean_ Hypothesis?\r\n\r\n11, What is the _Sphere of Activity_ of Cold, or the Space, to whose\r\nextremities every way the Action of a cold Body is able to reach: where the\r\ndifficulty of determining these limits, together with the causes thereof,\r\nbeing with much circumspection mentioned, it is observed, that the _Sphere\r\nof Activity_ of Cold is exceeding narrow, not only in comparison of that of\r\nHeat in Fire, but in comparison of, as it were, the _Atmosphere_ of many\r\nodorous Bodies; and even in comparison of the _Sphere of Activity_ of the\r\nmore vigorous Loadstones, insomuch, that the Author hath doubted, whether\r\nthe Sense could discern a Cold Body, otherwise then by immediate Contract.\r\nWhere several Experiments are delivered for the examining of this matter,\r\ntogether with a curious relation of the way used in _Persia_, though a very\r\nhot Climate, to furnish their _Conservatories_ with solid pieces of Ice of\r\na considerable thickness: To which is added an Observation, how far in\r\nEarth and Water the Frost will pierce downwards, and upon what accounts the\r\ndeepness of the Frost may vary. After which, the care is inculcated, that\r\nmust be had, in examining, whether Cold may be diffused through all\r\n_Mediums_ indefinitely, not to make the Trials with _Mediums_ of two great\r\nthickness: where it is made to appear, that Cold is able to operate through\r\nMetalline Vessels, which is confirmed by a very pretty Experiment of making\r\n_Icy Cups_ to drink in, whereof the way is accurately set down. Then are\r\nrelated the Trials, whether, or how, Cold will be diffused through a\r\n_Medium_, that _some_ would think a _Vacuum_, and which to _others_ would\r\nseem much less disposed to assist the diffusion of Cold, than Common Air it\r\nself. After which follows a curious Experiment, shewing whether a Cold Body\r\ncan operate through {51} a _Medium_ actually hot, and having its heat\r\ncontinually renewed by a fountain of heat.\r\n\r\n12, How to estimate the solidity of the Body of Ice, or how strong is the\r\nmutual adhesion of its parts? and whether differing Degrees of Cold may not\r\nvary the Degree of the compactness of Ice. And our Author having proceeded\r\nas far as he was able towards the bringing the strength of Ice to some\r\nEstimate by several experiments, he communicateth the information, he could\r\nget about this matter among the Descriptions that are given us of cold\r\nRegions: and then he relateth out of Sea-mens _Journals_, their\r\nObservations touching the insipidness of resolved Ice made of Sea-water;\r\nand the prodigious bigness of it, extending even to the height of two\r\nhundred and forty Foot above water, and the length of above eight Leagues.\r\nTo which he adds some promiscuous, but very notable Observations concerning\r\nIce, not so readily reducible to the foregoing Heads: _videlicet_, Of the\r\nblew colour of Rocky pieces of Ice; and the horrid noise made by the\r\nbreaking of Ice, like that of Thunder and Earthquakes, together with a\r\nConsideration of the cause, whence those loud Ruptures may proceed.\r\n\r\n13, How Ice and Snow may be made to last long; and what Liquor dissolves\r\nIce sooner than others, and in what proportion of quickness the Solutions\r\nin the several Liquors are made, where occasion is offered to the Author,\r\nto examine, whether Motion will impart a heat to Ice? After which he\r\nrelates an Experiment of _Heating_ a _Cold_ Liquor with Ice, made by\r\nhimself in the presence of a great and Learned Nobleman, and his Lady, who\r\nfound the Glass wherein the Liquor was, so hot that they could not endure\r\nto hold it in their Hands. Next it is examined, whether the effects of Cold\r\ndo continually depend upon the actual presence and influence of the\r\nmanifest Efficient causes, as the Light of the Air depends upon the Sun or\r\nFire, or other Luminous Bodies. To this is annexed an Account of the\r\n_Italian_ way of making _Conservatories_ of Ice and Snow, as the Author had\r\nreceived it from that Ingenious and Polite Gentleman, Master _J. Evelyn_.\r\n{52}\r\n\r\nBut want of time prohibiting the accomplishment of the intended account of\r\nthis Rich Piece: what remains, must be referred to the next Occasion. It\r\nshall only be intimated for a Conclusion, that the _Author_ hath annexed to\r\nthis _Treatise_, an Examen of Master _Hob_'s Doctrine touching _Cold_;\r\nwherein the _Grand_ Cause of _Cold_ and its Effects is assigned to _Wind_,\r\nin so much that 'tis affirmed, that almost any Ventilation and stirring of\r\nthe Air doth refrigerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON,_\r\n\r\nPrinted with Licence, By _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to\r\nthe _Royal-Society_, 1665\r\n\r\n{53}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numb._ 4.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _June_ 5. 1665.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _A Relation of some extraordinary Tydes in the _West Isles_ of\r\n    _Scotland_, by Sr. _Robert Moray_.

At the _East_ end of this _Island_, where I stayed some\r\n16. or 17. dayes, I _observed_ a very strange Reciprocation of the Flux and\r\nRe-flux of the Sea, and _heard_ of another, no less remarkable.\r\n\r\nUpon the _West_ side of the _Long Island_, the Tides, which came from the\r\n_South-west_, run along the Coast, _Northward_; so that during the ordinary\r\ncourse of the Tides, the Flood runs _East_ in the _Frith_, where _Berneray_\r\nlyes, and the Ebb _West_. And thus the Sea ebbs and flows orderly, some 4.\r\ndays before the _full Moon_, and _change_, and as long after (the ordinary\r\nSpring-tides rising some 14. or 15. foot upright, and all the rest\r\nproportionably, as in other places). But afterwards, some 4. days before\r\nthe _Quarter-moons_, and as long after, there is constantly a great and\r\nsingular _variation_. For _then_, (a _Southerly_ Moon making there the full\r\nSea) the course of the Tide being _Eastward_, when it begins to flow, which\r\nis about 9½ of the Clock, not onely continues so till about 3½ in the\r\nafternoon, that it be high water, but, after it begins to ebb, the Current\r\nruns on still _Eastward_, during the whole Ebb; so that it runs _Eastward_\r\n12 hours together, that is, all day long, from about 9½ in the morning, til\r\nabout 9½ at night. But then, when the night-Tide begins to flow, the\r\nCurrent turns, and runs _Westward_ all night, during both Floud & Ebb, for\r\nsome 12. hours more, as it did _Eastward_ the day before. And thus the\r\nReciprocations continue, one Floud and Ebb, running 12 hours _Eastward_,\r\nand another twelve hours _Westward_, till 4. days before the _New_ and\r\n_Full_ Moon; and then they resume their ordinary regular course as before,\r\nrunning _East_, during the six hours of Floud, and _West_, during the six\r\nof Ebb. And this I observed curiously, during my abode upon the place,\r\nwhich was in the Moneth of _August_, as I remember.\r\n\r\nBut the Gentleman, to whom the _Island_ belongs at present, and divers of\r\nhis Brothers and Friends, knowing and discreet persons, and expert in all\r\nsuch parts of Sea-matters, as other _Islanders_ commonly are, though I\r\nshrewdly suspected their skill in Tides, when I had not yet seen what they\r\ntold me, and I have now related of these irregular Courses of the Tides,\r\ndid most confidently assure me, and so did every body I spake with {55}\r\nabout it, that there is yet another irregularity in the Tides, which never\r\nfails, and is no less extraordinary, than what I have been mentioning:\r\nwhich is, That, whereas between the _Vernal_ and _Autumnal Equinoxes_, that\r\nis, for six Moneths together, the Course of irregular Tides about the\r\nQuartermoons, is, to run all day, that is, twelve hours, as from about 9½\r\nto 9½, 10¼ to 10¼ _&c. Eastward_, and all night, that is, twelve hours\r\nmore, _Westward_: during the other six Moneths, from the _Autumnal_ to the\r\n_Vernal Equinox_, the Current runs all day _Westward_, and all Night\r\n_Eastward_.\r\n\r\nOf this, though I had not the opportunity to be an Eye-witness, as of the\r\nother, yet I do not at all doubt, having received so credible Information\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nTo penetrate into the _Causes_ of these strange Reciprocations of the\r\nTides, would require exact descriptions of the Situation, Shape, and Extent\r\nof every piece of the adjacent Coasts of _Eust_ and _Herris_; the Rocks,\r\nSands, Shelves, Promontorys, Bays, Lakes, Depths, and other Circumstances\r\nwhich I cannot now set down with any certainty, or accurateness; seeing,\r\nthey are to be found in no _Map_, neither had I any opportunity to survey\r\nthem; nor do they now occur to my Memory, as they did some years ago, when\r\nupon occasion I ventured to make a _Map_ of this whole _Frith_ of\r\n_Berneray_, which not having copied, I cannot adventure to beat it out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n__Monsieur Auzout_'s Judgment touching the Apertures of _Object-Glasses_,\r\nand their _Proportions_, in respect of the several _Lengths_ of\r\n_Telescopes_._\r\n\r\nThis Author, observing in a small _French Tract_ lately written by him to a\r\nCountryman of his, Monsieur _L' Abbe Charles_; That great _Optick Glasses_\r\nhave almost never as great an _Aperture_ as the small ones, in proportion\r\nto what they Magnifie, and that therefore they must be more dim; takes\r\noccasion to inform {56} the _Reader_, that he hath found, that the\r\n_Apertures_, which _Optick-Glasses_ can bear with distinctness, are in\r\nabout a _subduplicate proportion_ to their _Lengths_; whereof he tells us\r\nhe intends to give the reason and demonstration in his _Diopticks_, which\r\nhe is now writing, and intends to finish, as soon as his Health will\r\npermit. In the mean time, he presents the _Reader_ with a _Table_ of such\r\n_Apertures_; which is here exhibited to the Consideration of the Ingenious,\r\nthere being of this _French_ Book but one Copy, that is known, in\r\n_England_.\r\n\r\nA _TABLE_ of the _Apertures_ of _Object-Glasses_.\r\n\r\n_The Points put to some of these Numbers denote Fractions._\r\n\r\n   Lengths of  |For excellent|  For good   |For ordinary |\r\n    Glasses.   |    ones.    |    ones.    |    ones.    |\r\n  Feet, Inches.|Inch,  Lines.|Inch,  Lines.|Inch,  Lines.|\r\n               |             |             |             |\r\n              4|           4.|            4|            3|\r\n              6|           5.|            5|            4|\r\n              9|            7|            6|            5|\r\n    1         0|           8.|            7|            6|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    1         6|            9|           8.|            7|\r\n    2         0|           11|           10|            8|\r\n    2         6|1           0|           11|            9|\r\n    3         0|1           1|1           0|           10|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    3         6|1          2.|1           1|           11|\r\n    4         0|1           4|1           2|1           0|\r\n    4         6|1           5|1           3|1           .|\r\n    5         0|1           6|1           4|1          1.|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    6          |1          7.|1           5|1           2|\r\n    7          |1           9|1           6|1           3|\r\n    8          |1          10|1           8|1           4|\r\n    9          |1         11.|1           9|1           5|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    10         |2           1|1          10|1           6|\r\n    12         |2           4|2           0|1           8|\r\n    14         |2           6|2           2|1          9.|\r\n    16         |2           8|2           4|1         11.|\r\n    18         |2          10|2           6|2           1|\r\n    20         |3           0|2           7|2          2.|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    25         |3           4|2          10|2          4.|\r\n    30         |3           8|3           2|2           7|\r\n    35         |4           0|3          4.|2          10|\r\n    40         |4           3|3           7|3           .|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    45         |4           6|3          10|3          2.|\r\n    50         |4           9|4           0|3          4.|\r\n    55         |5           0|4           3|3          6.|\r\n    60         |5           2|4           6|3          8.|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    65         |5           4|4           8|3          10|\r\n    70         |5           7|4          10|4           .|\r\n    75         |5           9|5           0|4          2.|\r\n    80         |5          11|5           2|4           5|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    90         |6           4|5           6|4          7.|\r\n    100        |6           8|5           9|4          10|\r\n    120        |7           5|6           5|5           3|\r\n    150        |8           0|7           0|5          11|\r\n  -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\r\n    200        |9           6|8           0|6           9|\r\n    250        |10          6|9           2|7          8.|\r\n    300        |11          6|10          0|8           5|\r\n    350        |12        *6.|10          9|9           0|\r\n    400        |13          4|11          6|9           8|\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{57}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Considerations of Monsieur _Auzout_ upon Mr. _Hook_'s New Instrument for\r\nGrinding of _Optick-Glasses_._\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned _French_ Tract, there are, besides several other\r\nparticulars, to be represented in due place, contained some\r\n_Considerations_ of Monsieur _Auzout_ upon Mr. _Hook_'s New _Engine_ for\r\ngrinding _Optick-Glasses_. Where he premises in _General_ his thoughts\r\ntouching the working of _Great_ Optick-Glasses, and that by the help of a\r\n_Turn lathe_; affirming first of all, that not only the _Engin_ is to be\r\nconsidered for giveing the _Figure_, but the _Matter_ also, which ought to\r\nbe brought to greater perfection, than it hath been hitherto. For, he finds\r\nit not so easie (as least, _where he is_) to procure _Great_ pieces of\r\nGlass without _Veins_, and other faults, nor to get such, as are thick\r\nenough without _Blebbs_; which, if they be not, they will yield to the\r\npressure and weight, either when they are fitted to the _Cement_, or\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\nSecondly, He finds it difficult to work these _Great_ Glasses of the _same_\r\nthickness, which yet is very necessary, because, that the least difference\r\nin _Figures_ so little _convex_, can put the _Center_ out of the _Midle_, 2\r\nor 3 _Inches_; and if they be wrought in _Moulds_, the length of time,\r\nwhich is required to wear and to smooth them, may spoil the best _Mould_,\r\nbefore they be finished. Besides, that the strength of Man is so limited,\r\nthat he is unable to work Glasses beyond a certain bigness, so as to finish\r\nand polish them all over so well, as _small_ Glasses; whereas yet, the\r\nbigger they are, the more compleat they ought to be: And if any weight or\r\nEngine be used to supply strength, there is then danger of an unequal\r\npressure, and of wearing away the Engine; In the mean time, the preciseness\r\nand delicateness is {58} greater than can easily be imagined. Wherefore he\r\ncould never, having some experience of this preciseness, conceive, that a\r\n_Turn-lathe_, wherein must be two different, and in some manner contrary\r\nmotions, can move with that exactness and steddiness, that is required,\r\nespecially, for any considerable length of time.\r\n\r\nHaving premised this, he discourses upon Mr. _Hook_ his _Turne_, intimating\r\nfirst of all, that he was impatient to know what kind of _Turne_ this was,\r\nimagining, that it had been tried, and had succeeded, as coming from a\r\nSociety that professeth, they publish nothing but what hath been maturely\r\nexamin'd. But that he was much surprised when he saw the _Micrography_ of\r\nMr. _Hook_, and found there, that his _Engine_ was published upon a _meer\r\nTheory_, without having made any Experiment, though that might have been\r\nmade with little charge and great speed; expence of Money and Time being\r\nthe onely thing, that can excuse those who in matter of _Engines_ impart\r\ntheir inventions to the publick, without having tried them, to excite\r\nothers to make trial thereof.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he proposes some difficulties, to give the _Inventor_ occasion to\r\nfind a way to remove them. He affirms therefore, that though it be true in\r\nthe _Theory_, that a _Circle_, whose _Plain_ is inclined to the _Axis_ of\r\nthe _Sphere_ by an _Angle_, whereof half the _Diameter_ is the _Sine_, and\r\nwhich touches the _Sphere_ in its _Pole_, will touch in all its parts a\r\n_spherical Surface_, that shall turn upon that _Axe_. But that it is true\r\nalso, that that must be but a _Mathematical Circle_, and without _Breadth_,\r\nand which precisely touches the Body in its middle: Whereas in the\r\npractice, a _Circle_ capable to keep Sand and Putty, must be of some\r\n_breadth_; and he knows not whether we can find such a dexterity of keeping\r\nso much of it, and for so long a time, as needs, upon the Brim of a _Ring_\r\nthat is half an Inch broad. He adds, that it is very difficult to contrive,\r\nthat the middle of the Glass do always precisely answer to the Brim of this\r\n_Ring_, seeing that the position of the Glass does always change a little\r\nin respect of the _Ring_, in proportion as 'tis worn, and as it must be\r\npressed because of its inclination. He believes it also very hard, to give\r\nto the _Axis_ or to the _Mandril_, which holds the Glass, that little {59}\r\n_Inclination_, that would be necessary for great Glasses, and to make the\r\ntwo _Mandrils_ to have one and the same _Plain_, as is necessary. And,\r\nhaving done all this, he persuades himself, that it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, for two contrary motions, where so many\r\npieces are, to rest for a long time steddy and firm, as is requisite for\r\nthe not swarving from it a hair's thickness, since less than that can\r\nchange all.\r\n\r\nHe goes on, and, seeing that this _Inventor_ speaks of Glasses of a\r\nthousand, & ten thousand foot, which he supposed not impossible to be made\r\nby this _Engine_, discourses of what is necessary for the making Glasses of\r\nsuch bignesses; which he believes this _Inventor_ may perhaps not have\r\nthought of. Wherefore he affirms, that if the _Table_, made by himself for\r\nthe _Apertures_ of Glasses (which is that, that is above delivered) be\r\ncontinued unto a thousand feet, by taking always the _Subduplicate\r\nproportion_ of _Lengths_, it will be found, that for pretty good ones, the\r\n_Aperture_ must be of 15. Inches; for good ones, more than 18. and for such\r\nas are excellent, more than 21. Inches: whence it may be judged, what piece\r\nof Glass, and of what thickness it must be, to endure the working. But he\r\nproceeds to speak of the _Inclination_, which the _Mandril_ must have upon\r\nthe _Plain_ of the _Ring_, when the _Ring_ should have 10. or 12 Inches;\r\nand finds, that it would make but 6 or 7. minutes of inclination, and that\r\na Glass would have less _Convexity_, and consequently, less difference from\r\na Glass perfectly plain, than the 7. or 8. part of a Line. And then he\r\nleaveth it to be judged, whether a Glass of such a Length being found, we\r\nought to hope, that a _Turn_ can be firm enough to keep such a piece of\r\nGlass in the same Inclination, so that a _Mandril_ do not recede some\r\nMinutes from it: and, though even the Glass could be fastned perfectly\r\nperpendicular to the _Mandril_, that those two _Mandrils_ could be put in\r\none and the same Plain, & that that little Inclination, which is requisite,\r\ncould be given, and the _Mandril_ be continued to be pressed in that same\r\n_Inclination_, according as the Glass is worn. All which particulars, he\r\nconceives to be very hard in the practice; not to mention, that the weight\r\nof the Glass, that should be inclined to the _Horizon_, as 'tis represented\r\nby Mr. _Hook_, would make it slide upon the _Cement_, and so {60} change\r\nthe _Center_; and that the Glass is not pressed at the same time by the\r\n_Ring_ but in one part on the side, _vid._ about a fourth; and that the\r\nparts of the Glass are not equally worn away, &c. What then, _saith he_,\r\nwould becom of a Glass of 10000 feet, which, according to the said Table,\r\nwould have more than four feet, or four feet and nine inches, or five feet,\r\nseven inches _Aperture_, and of which the _Ring_, though it were two feet\r\nnine inches, would have but one minut of _Inclination_, and the Glass of 5\r\nfeet _Aperture_ would have but 4 minuts, and the curvity of it would be\r\nless than the eight part of a Line.\r\n\r\nBut, _saith he_, let us consider, only a Glass of 300 foot, to see, what is\r\nto be hoped of that, and to know at least the difficulty, to be met with in\r\nmaking a Glass only of that Length. A Glass then of 300 foot, according to\r\nhis Table, must have more than 8 inches _Aperture_, which maketh but 16\r\nminuts of its _Circle_, and it should have more than 11 inches, if it be an\r\nexcellent one. If Mr. _Hook_ (adds he) did use but his _Ring_ of 6 inches,\r\nwhich he would use from twelve to an hundred foot Glass, the _Inclination_,\r\nwhich the _Axis_, or _Mandril_, that bears his Glass, should have, should\r\nbe but 16 minuts, and the _Curvity_ of the Glass would be less than the\r\neighth part of a Line, and if he should use a bigger, the _Inclination_\r\nwould be proportionable.\r\n\r\nWhence it may be judged (continues he) that we are yet very far from seeing\r\n_Animals &c._ in the _Moon_, as Monsieur _Des Cartes_ gave hope, and Mr.\r\n_Hook_ despairs not of. For, he believes by what he knows of _Telescopes_,\r\nthat we are not to look for any above 300 or 400 foot at most; and he\r\nfears, that neither _Matter_ nor _Art_ will go even so far.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore (_saith he_) a Glass of 300 foot should bear an Eye-glass of\r\n6 inches (which would appear wonderful) it would magnifie but 600. times in\r\n_Diameter_, that is, 360000 times in _Surface_: but suppose, that such\r\ncould be made, as would magnifie a 1000 times in _Diameter_, and 1000000.\r\nof times in _Surface_, admitting there were but 60000 leagues from the\r\n_Earth_ to the _Moon_, and that the smalness of the _Aperture_ of the\r\nGlasses (which yet would diminish the Light more than 36 times) and the\r\nobstacle of the Air were not considered, we should not {61} see the _Moon_,\r\nbut as if we were a 100, or at least, 60. leagues distant from her without\r\na Glass. He here wishes, that those, that promise to make us see _Animals_\r\nand _Plants_ in the Moon, had thought on what our naked Eyes can make us\r\ndiscern of such Objects, only at 10 or 12 leagues distance.\r\n\r\nBut this he would not have understood as a discouragement from searching\r\nwith all care and earnestness after the means of making long _Telescopes_,\r\nor of facilitating the working thereof; but only as an Advertisement to\r\nthose, who light upon the _Theory_ of any _Engine_, not to expose it\r\npresently as possible and useful, before they have tried it, or if it have\r\nsucceeded in small, not to endeavour to persuade, that it will also succeed\r\nin great.\r\n\r\nAs it may happen (_saith he_) that the Engin of Mr. _Hook_ may, by using\r\nall necessary precautions, succeed in the making of _Eye-Glasses_, or\r\n_small_ Optick-Glasses, but not in making _great_ ones; as we see, that an\r\ninstrument composed of two Rulers, wherewith are traced Portions of\r\nCircles, succeeds well enough in _small_, but when there is no more than\r\nhalf a Line, a quarter of a Line, or less convexity, it will be no longer\r\njust at all, as he tells us to have made the proof of it in Circles drawn\r\nby the means of one of these Instruments, made by one of the best Workmen\r\nin his time, who, whilst he lived, esteemed them above price, although they\r\nbe not just; as others and my self (_saith he_) have by tryal found, when\r\nwe endeavoured to make _Moulds_ by their means, & as those, who by the like\r\nInstrument laboured to trace portions of Circles of 80 or 100 foot, _&c.\r\nDiameter_, can attest.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all this, he hath thought upon two or three things,\r\nwhich he thinks may remedy some inconveniencies of Mr. _Hook_ his _Turn_.\r\nThe _first_ is, to invert the Glass, and to put it under the _Ring_, that\r\nso not only the Glass may be placed more _Horizontally_, and not slide upon\r\nthe _Cement_, but that the _Sand_ also, and the _Putty_ may stay upon the\r\nGlass.\r\n\r\nThe _other_ is, that there must be two _Poppetheads_, into which the\r\n_Mandril_ must pass, where the _Ring_ is to be fastned; and the _Mandril_\r\nmust be perfectly _Cylindrical_, that so it may advance upon the Glass as\r\nit wears away by the means of its weight, or by the means of a spring,\r\npressing it, without wrigling from one place to another, as it would\r\npresently happen in the fashion, {62} as the _Turn_ is composed. For, when\r\nthe Glasses do wear, especially when they are very _convex_, it cannot be\r\notherwise, but the _Mandril_ will play and wrigle, before the _Scrue_ be\r\nmade firm.\r\n\r\nBut he doubts, whether all can be remedied, which he leavs to the industry\r\nof Mr. _Hook_, considering what he saith in the _Preface_ of his\r\n_Micrography_, touching a Method, he knows, of finding out as much in\r\n_Mechanicks_, as can be found in _Geometry_ by _Algebra_.\r\n\r\nBesides this, he taketh notice, that most of those that medle with\r\n_Optick-Glasses_, give them not as much _Aperture_, nor charge them so deep\r\nas they ought. And he instances in the _Telescope_, which His _Majesty_ of\r\n_Great Britain_ presented the _Duke_ of _Orleans_ with, _videl._ that it\r\ndid bear but 2 inches, and 9 lines _French_, for its greatest _Aperture_,\r\nthough there be 5 or 6 lesser _Apertures_, of which it seems (_saith he_)\r\nthe Artificer would have those, that use it, serve themselves more\r\nordinarily, than of the greatest; which conveys but almost half as many\r\nRays as it should do, according to his Calculation, which is, as 9 to 16;\r\nWhereas, according to his _Table_ of _Apertures_, an excellent 35 foot\r\n_Telescope_ should bear 4 inches _Aperture_ in proportion to _excellent_\r\nsmall ones. He notes also, that the Eye-glass of the said _Telescope_,\r\ncomposed of 2 Glasses, hath no more effect, when it is most charged, than a\r\nGlass of 4½ inches; which makes it magnifie not a 100 times. And he finds\r\nby Mr. _Hook_, that he esteems a _Telescope_ made in _London_ of 60 feet,\r\n(which amount to about 57 feet of _France_, the foot of _France_ being to\r\nthat of _England_ as about 15 to 16) because it can bear at least 3\r\n_English_ inches _Aperture_, and that there are few of 30 feet, that can\r\nbear more than 2 inches, (which is but 22½ Lines _French_) although he (M.\r\n_Auzout_) gives no less _Aperture_ than so, to a 15 foot-_Telescope_, and\r\nhis of 21 feet hath ordinarily 2 Inches, 4 Lines, or 2 inches, 6 Lines\r\n_Aperture_.\r\n\r\nThis Discourse he Concludeth with exhorting those, that work\r\n_Optick-Glasses_, to endeavor to make them such, that they may bear great\r\n_Apertures_ and deep Eye-glasses; seeing it is not the length that gives\r\nesteem to _Telescopes_; but on the contrary renders them less estimable, by\r\nreason of the trouble {63} accompanying them, if they perform no more, than\r\nshorter ones. Where, by the by, he takes notice, that he knows not yet,\r\nwhat _Aperture_ Signor _Campani_ gives to his Glasses, seeing he hath as\r\nyet signified nothing of it; but that the small one, sent by him to\r\nCardinal _Antonio_, hath no more _Aperture_, than ordinary ones ought to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nHe promises withall, that he will explicate this way in his _Treatise of\r\nthe usefulness of Telescopes_, where he intends to assign the Bigness of\r\nthe _Diameter_ of all the _Planets_, and their proportion to that of the\r\n_Sun_; as also, that of the _Stars_, which he esteems yet much less, than\r\nall those have done, that have written of it hitherto; not believing, that\r\nthe _Great Dog_, which appears to be the fairest Star of the _Firmament_,\r\nhath 2 _Seconds_ in _Diameter_, nor that those, which are counted of the\r\nsixth Magnitude, have 20 _thirds_; nor thinking, that all the Stars, that\r\nare in the _Firmament_, do enlighten the Earth as much as a Luminous Body\r\nof 20 _seconds_ in _Diameter_ would do, or, because there is but one half\r\nof them at the same time above our _Horizon_, as a Body of 14 _seconds_ in\r\n_Diameter_; and as the 18432^{th} part of the _Sun_ would enlighten us, or\r\nas the _Sun_ would do, if we were 14 times more distant from it, than\r\n_Saturn_, and 137 times further, than the Earth: Which, _he saith_, would\r\nnot be credible, if he did not endeavor to evince it both by _Experience_\r\nand _Reason_. And he doubts not, but that _Venus_, although she sends us no\r\nLight but what is reflected, does sometimes enlighten the _Earth_ more,\r\nthan all the Stars together. Yet he would not have us imagine, from what he\r\nhath spoken of the smallness of the Stars, that _Telescopes_ do not\r\nmagnifie them by reason of their great distance, as they do _Planets_; for\r\nthis he judgeth a Vulgar Error, to be renounced. _Telescopes_ magnifie the\r\n_Stars_ (_saith he_) as much in proportion, as they do all other Bodies,\r\nseeing that the demonstration of their magnifying is made even upon\r\n_Parallel_ rays, which do suppose an infinite distance, though the Stars\r\nhave none such: And if the _Telescopes_ did not magnifie the Stars, how\r\ncould they make us see some of the _fiftieth_, and it may be some of the\r\n_hundreth_, and _twohundreth_ Magnitude, as they do, and as they would shew\r\nyet much lesser ones, if they did magnifie more? {64}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n__M^r. Hook_'s Answer to Monsieur _Auzout_'s Considerations, in a Letter to\r\nthe Publisher of these _Transactions_._\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nTogether with my most hearty thanks for the favour you were pleased to do\r\nme, in sending me an _Epitome_ of what had been by the ingenious Monsieur\r\n_Auzout_ animadverted on a description, I had made of an _Engine_ for\r\n_grinding spherical Glasses_, I thought my self obliged, both for your\r\nsatisfaction, and my own Vindication, to return you my present thoughts\r\nupon those Objections. The chief of which seems to be against the very\r\n_Proposition_ it self: For it appears, that the _Objector_ is somewhat\r\nunsatisfied, that I should propound a thing in _Theory_, without having\r\nfirst tried the _Practicableness_ of it. But first, I could wish that this\r\nworthy Person had rectified my mistakes, not by speculation, but by\r\nexperiments. Next, I have this to answer, that (though I did not tell the\r\n_Reader_ so much, to the end that he might have the more freedom to examine\r\nand judg of the contrivance, yet) it was not meer _Theory_ I propounded,\r\nbut somewhat of _History_ and _matter of Fact_: For, I had made trials, as\r\nmany as my leisure would permit, not without some good success; but not\r\nhaving time and opportunity enough to prosecute them, I thought it would\r\nnot be unacceptable to such, as enjoyed both, to have a description of a\r\nway altogether _New_, and _Geometrically_ true, and seemingly, not\r\nunpracticable, whereof they might make use, or not, as they should see\r\nreason. But nothing surprised me so much, as, that he is pleased (after he\r\nhad declared it a fault, to write this _Theory_, without having reduced it\r\nto practice) to lay it, as he seems to do, in one place of his book, _p._\r\n22 upon the _Royal Society_. Truly, _Sir_, I should think my self most\r\ninjurious to that _Noble Company_, had I not endeavoured, even in the\r\nbeginning of my Book, to prevent such a misconstruction. And therefore I\r\ncannot but make this interpretation of what Monsieur _Auzout_ saith in this\r\nparticular, that either he had not so {65} much of the Language wherein I\r\nhave written, as to understand all what was said by me, or, that he had not\r\nread my _Dedication_ to the _Royal Society_, which if he had done, he would\r\nhave found, how careful I was, that that _Illustrious Society_ should not\r\nbe prejudiced by my _Errors_, that could be so little advantaged by my\r\n_Actions_. And indeed, for any man to look upon the matters published by\r\ntheir Order or Licence, as if they were _Their_ Sense, and had _Their_\r\nApprobation, as _certain_ and _true_, 'tis extremely wide of their\r\nintentions, seeing they, in giving way to, or encouraging such\r\npublications, aim chiefly at this, that _ingenious conceptions_, and\r\nimportant _philosophical matter of Fact_ may be communicated to the learned\r\nand enquiring World, thereby to excite the minds of men to the examination\r\nand improvement thereof. But, to return; As to his _Objections_ against the\r\n_Matter_, I do find that they are no more against mine, than any other way\r\nof _Grinding Glasses_; nor is it more than I have taken notice of my self\r\nin this Passage of the same _Paragraph_, of which sort are also those\r\ndifficulties he raises about _Long Glasses_, which are commonly known to\r\nsuch, as are conversant in making them _It would be convenient also_ (these\r\nare my words) _and not very chargeable, to have four or five several Tools:\r\nOne,_ &c. _And, if curiosity shall ever proceed so farr, one for all\r\nlengths, between 1000. and 10000. foot long; for indeed, the _Principle_ is\r\nsuch, that supposing _the Mandrils well_ made, and of a good length, and\r\nsupposing _great care_ be used in working and polishing them, I see no\r\nreason, but that a Glass of 1000. nay, 10000. foot long may be made, as\r\nwell as one of 10. For, the reason is the same, supposing the _Mandrils_\r\nand _Tools_ be made sufficiently strong, so that they cannot bend; and\r\nsupposing also that the Glass out of which they are wrought, be capable of\r\nso great a regularity in its parts, as to its Refraction._ But next, I must\r\nsay that his _Objections_ to me, seem not so considerable, as perhaps he\r\nimagines them. For, as to the possibility of getting Plates of Glass thick\r\nand broad enough without veins, I think _that_ not now so difficult here in\r\n_England_, where I believe is made as good, if not much better Glass for\r\n_Optical Experiments_, than ever I saw come from _Venice_. Next, though it\r\nwere better, that the thickest part of a long _Object-Glass_ were exactly\r\nin the middle, yet I can assure Monsieur _Auzout_, that it may be a very\r\n{66} good one, when it is an Inch or two out of it. And I have a good one\r\nby me at present, of 36. foot, that will bare an _Aperture_, if _Saturn_ or\r\nthe _Moon_ in the _twilight_, be look'd on with it, of 3½ Inches over, and\r\nyet the thickest part of the Glass is a great way out of the middle. And I\r\nmust take the liberty to doubt, whether ever my _Animadversor_ saw a long\r\nGlass, that was otherwise; as he might presently satisfie himself by a way\r\nI could shew him (if he did not know it) whereby the difference of the\r\nthickness of the sides might be found to the hundreth part of a Line.\r\n\r\nAs to the exceeding exactness of the _Figure_ of Long _Object-Glasses_,\r\n'tis not doubted, but that it is a matter difficult enough to be attained\r\nany way: but yet, I think, much easier by _Engine_, than by _Hand_; and of\r\nall _Engines_, I conceive, none more plain and simple, than that of a\r\n_Mandril_. And for making _spherical Glasses_ by an _Engine_, I am apt to\r\nthink, there hardly can be any way more plain, and more exact, than that\r\nwhich I have described; wherein there is no other motion, than that of two\r\nsuch _Mandrils_, which may be made of sufficient strength, length, and\r\nexactness, to perform abundantly much more, than I can believe possible to\r\nbe done otherwise than by chance, by a man's hands or strength unassisted\r\nby an _Engine_, the motion and strength being much more certain and\r\nregular. I know very well, that in making a 60. foot Glass by the strength\r\nof the hand, in the common way, not one of ten that are wrought, will\r\nhappen to be good, as I have been assured by Mr. _Reeves_; who, I am apt to\r\nthink, was the first that made any good of that length. For the _Figure_ of\r\nthe _Tool_ in that way is presently vitiated by the working of the Glass,\r\nand without much _gaging_ will not do any thing considerable. Besides, the\r\nstrength of a man's hands, applied to it for the working and polishing of\r\nit, is very unequal, and the motions made, are very irregular; but in the\r\nway, I have ventured to propose, by _Mandrils_, the longer the _Glass_ and\r\n_Tool_ are wrought together, the more exact they seem to be and if all\r\nthings be ordered, as they should be, the very polishing of the Glass, does\r\nseem most of all rectifie the _Figure_.\r\n\r\nAs to what he objects, that the Tool does only touch the Glass in a\r\n_Mathematical Circle_; that is true, perhaps, at first, but before the\r\nGlass is wrought down to its true _Figure_, the _Edge_ of the _Tool_ {67}\r\nwill be worn or grownd away, so as that a Ring of an inch broad may be made\r\nto touch the _Spherical Surface_ of the Glass; nay, if it be necessary\r\n(without much trouble, especially in the grinding of longer Glasses) the\r\nwhole _Concave Surface_ of the _Tool_ may be made to touch a Glass.\r\nBesides, that as to the keeping a quantity of the same sand and Powders of\r\nseveral finesses, according as the glass wears, the same is possible to be\r\ndon, as with the same Sand wrought finer by working in the Ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe giving the _Inclination_ to the _Mandrils_, is not at all difficult;\r\nthough perhaps to determine the length exactly which the Glass so made\r\nshall draw, is not so easie: But 'tis no matter, what length the Glass be\r\noff, so it be made good, whether 60 or 80 foot, or the like. Nor is it so\r\nvery difficult, to lay them both in the same _Plain_. And to keep them\r\n_steddy_, when once fix'd, is most easie.\r\n\r\nAs to the Calculation of the propriety of a Glass of a thousand foot,\r\nperhaps for that particular Length, I had not, nor have as yet calculated,\r\nthat the Convexity of one of eighteen inches broad, will not be above a\r\nseventh part of a Line. But it does not thence follow, that I had not\r\nconsidered the difficulties, that would be in making of it. For, I must\r\ntell him, that I can make a _Plano convex_ Glass though its convexity be a\r\nsmaler sphere than is usual for such a length to be an _Object-Glass_ of\r\nabout 150 foot in Length, nay of 300 foot, and either longer or shorter,\r\n_without_ at all _altering the convexity_. So that, if he will by any\r\nContrivance he hath, give me a _Plano-convex_ Glass of 20, or 40 foot\r\n_Diameter_, without _Veins_, and truly wrought of that _Figure_, I will\r\npresently make a _Telescope_ with it, that with a single Ey-glass shall\r\ndraw a thousand foot: Which _Invention_, I shall shortly discover, there\r\nbeing, I think, nothing more easie and certain. And if a _Plano-convex_\r\nGlass can be made of any _Sphere_ between twenty and fourty foot _radius_,\r\nso as that both the _Convex_ and _Plain_ side of the Glass be exactly\r\npolish'd of a true _Figure_, I will shortly shew, how therewith may be made\r\na _Telescope_ of any Length, supposing the Glass free from all kind of\r\n_Veins_, or inequality of _Refraction_.\r\n\r\nAs for the sliding of the Glass upon the _Cement_, I see no reason at all\r\nfor it, at least in the _Cement_, I make use of, having never observed any\r\nsuch accident in hard _Cement_. {68}\r\n\r\nAnd for the Bearing of the _Ring_ against one side of the Glass only at a\r\ntime, I cannot see, why _that_ should produce any inequality, since all the\r\nsides of the Glass have successively the same pressure.\r\n\r\nHis ratiocination concerning a Glass of 300 foot, is much the same with the\r\nformer, about the difficulty of working a true surface of a convenient\r\nfigure; which how considerable both _that_ and his Conclusion thereupon\r\n(_videl. That we are not to expect Glasses of above 300 or 400 foot long at\r\nmost, and that neither _Matter_ nor _Art_ will go so far_) is, may be\r\njudged from what I have newly told you of making any _Object-Glass_ of any\r\nLength.\r\n\r\nAnd for his good wishes, that those, who promise to make him see _Plants_\r\nor _Animals_ in the _Moon_ (of which I know not any, that has done so,\r\nthough perhaps there may be some, notwithstanding his Objections, that do\r\nnot yet think it impossible to be done) had considered, what a Man is able\r\nto see with his _bare_ Eye at 60 Leagues distance: I cannot but return him\r\nmy wishes, that he would consider the difference between seeing a thing\r\nthrough the _Gross_ and _Vaporous_ Air neer the Earth, and through the Air\r\nover our heads: Which, if he observe the Moon in the _Horizon_, and neer\r\nthe _Zenith_ with a _Telescope_, he will experimentally find; and, having\r\ndone so, he will perhaps not be so dissident in this matter.\r\n\r\nConcerning his Advertisement to such, as publish _Theories_, I find not,\r\nthat he hath made use of it in his own case. For, in his _Theory_ about\r\n_Apertures_ he seems to be very positive, not at all doubting to rely upon\r\nit, _vid._ that the _Apertures_ must be _thus_ and _thus_ in _great_\r\nGlasses, because he had found them _so_ or _so_ in some _small_ ones.\r\n\r\nFor his Proposal of amendments of some inconveniencies in this way, I\r\nreturn him my thanks; but as to his first I believe, that the matter may be\r\nconteined as wel in the _Concave_ Tool, as on the _convex_ Glass. And as to\r\nthat of 2 _Poppet-heads_ I do not well understand it, if differing from\r\nmine; and the keeping of the Tool upon the Glass with a spring or weight,\r\nmust quickly spoyl the whole; since, if either of the _Mandrils_ will\r\neasily yield backwards, the _regularity_ of _all_ will be spoiled: and as\r\nto the wrigling and playing of the _Mandril_, I do not at all apprehend it.\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nHis _Theory_ of _Apertures_, though he seems to think it very authentick,\r\nyet to me it seems not so cleer. For, the same Glass will endure greater or\r\nlesser _Apertures_, according to the lesser or greater Light of the\r\n_Object_: If it be for the looking on the _Sun_ or _Venus_, or for seeing\r\nthe _Diameters_ of the _Fix'd Stars_, then smaller _Apertures_ do better;\r\nif for the _Moon_ in the _daylight_, or on _Saturn_, or _Jupiter_, or\r\n_Mars_, then the largest. Thus I have often made use of a 12 foot-Glass to\r\nlook on _Saturn_ with an _Aperture_ of almost 3 inches, and with a single\r\nEye-glass of 2 inches _double convex_: but, when with the same Glass I\r\nlooked on the _Sun_ or _Venus_, I used both a smaller _Aperture_, and\r\nshallower _Charge_. And though M. _Auzout_ seems to find fault with the\r\n_English_ Glass of 36 foot, that had an _Aperture_ of but 2¾ inches\r\n_French_; as also, with a 60 foot _Tube_, used but with an _Aperture_ of 3\r\ninches; yet I do not find, that he hath seen Glasses of that length, that\r\nwould bear greater _Apertures_, and 'tis not impossible, but his _Theory_\r\nof _Apertures_ may fail in longer Glasses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a means to illuminate an Object in what proportion one pleaseth; and of\r\nthe Distances requisite to burn Bodies by the _Sun_._\r\n\r\nOne of the means used by M. _Auzout_ to enlighten an Object, in what\r\nproportion one pleaseth, is by some great _Object-Glass_, by him called a\r\n_Planetary_ one, because that by it he shews the difference of Light, which\r\nall the _Planets_ receive from the _Sun_, by making use of several\r\n_Apertures_, proportionate to their distance from the _Sun_, provided that\r\nfor every 9 foot draught, or thereabout, one inch of _Aperture_ be given\r\nfor the _Earth_. Doing this, one sees (_saith he_) that the Light which\r\n_Mercury_ receives, is far enough from being able to burn Bodies, and yet\r\nthat the same Light is great enough in _Saturn_ to see cleer there, seeing\r\nthat (to him) it appears greater in _Saturn_, than it doth upon our\r\n_Earth_, when it is overcast with Clouds: Which (he adds) would scarce be\r\nbelieved, if by means of this Glass it did not sensibly appear so; Whereof\r\nhe promises to discourse more fully in his {70} _Treatise of the usefulness\r\nof great Optick-Glasses_, where he also intends to deliver several\r\nExperiments, by him made, 1. Touching the quantity of Light, which a Body,\r\nthat is 10, 15 and 20 times, &c. remoter than _Saturn_, would yet receive\r\nfrom the _Sun_. 2. Touching the quantity of Light, by which the _Earth_ is\r\nilluminated even in the _Eclipses_ of the _Sun_, in proportion of their\r\nbigness. 3. Touching the quantity of Light, which is necessary to burn\r\nBodies: he having found, that not abating the Light, which is reflected by\r\nthe Surfaces of the Glass (whereof he confesseth, he doth not yet exactly\r\nknow the quantity) there would be necessary about 50 times as much Light,\r\nas we have here, for the burning of _Black_ Bodies; and neer 9 times more\r\nfor the burning of _White_ Bodies, than for the burning of _Black_ ones:\r\nand so observing the immediate proportions between these two, for burning\r\nbodies of _other_ Colors. Whence (he tells us) he hath drawn some\r\nconsequences, touching the distance, at which we may hope, to burn Bodies\r\nhere, by the means of _great Glasses_ and great _Looking-glasses_. So that\r\n(_saith he_) we must yet be seven times neerer the _Sun_, than we are, to\r\nbe in danger of being burned by it. Where he mentions, that having given\r\n_Instructions_ to certain persons, gon to travel in _Hot Countries_, he\r\nhath among other particulars recommended to them, to try by means of great\r\n_Burning-glasses_, with how much less _Aperture_ they will burn _there_,\r\nthan _here_, to know from thence, whether there by more Light _there_ than\r\n_here_, and how much; since this perhaps may be the only means of trying\r\nit, supposing, the same matters be used: although the difference of the Air\r\nalready heated, both in _hot Countries_, and in the _Planets_, that are\r\nneerer than we, may alter, if not the quantity of Light, at least that of\r\nthe Heat, found there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A further Account, touching Signor _Campani_'s Book and Performances about\r\n_Optick-glasses_._\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned _French_ Tract there is also conteined M. _Auzout's_\r\nOpinion of what he had found New in the _Treatise_ of Signor _Campani_,\r\nwhich was spoken of in the first _Papers_ of these _Transactions_,\r\nconcerning both the Effect of the _Telescopes_, contrived after a peculiar\r\nway by the said _Campani_ at _Rome_, and {71} his New Observations of\r\n_Saturn_ and _Jupiter_, made by means thereof.\r\n\r\nFirst therefore, after that M _Auzout_ had raised some scruple against the\r\nContrivance of Signor _Campani_ for making _Great Optick-Glasses_ without\r\n_Moulds_, by the means of a _Turn-lath_, he examines the _Observations_,\r\nmade with such _Glasses_: Where, having commended _Campani_'s sincerity in\r\nrelating what he thought to have seen in _Saturn_, without accomodating it\r\nto M. _Hugens_'s _Hypothesis_, he affirms, that supposing, there be a\r\n_Ring_ about _Saturn_, Signor _Campani_ could not see in all those\r\ndifferent times, that he observed it, _the same Appearances_, which he\r\nnotes to have _actually_ seen. For, having seen it sometimes in _Trine\r\nAspect_ with the _Sun_, and _Oriental_; sometimes, in the same _Aspect_,\r\nbut _Occidental_; sometimes in _Sextil Aspect_, and _Occidental_; at\r\nanother time, again in _Trine_, and _Oriental_, this Author cannot\r\nconceive, how _Saturn_ could in all these different times have no\r\ndifference in its _Phasis_, or keep always the same _Shadow_; seeing that,\r\naccording to the _Hypothesis_ of the _Ring_, when it was _Oriental_, it\r\nmust cast the _Shadow_ upon the _left_ side of the _Ring_ beneath, without\r\ncasting any on the _right_ side: and when it was _Occidental_, it could not\r\nbut cast it on the _right_ side beneath, and nothing of it on the other.\r\n\r\nConcerning the _Shadow above_, which _Campani_ affirms to be made by the\r\n_Ring_ upon the Body of _Saturn_, M. _Auzout_ judges, that there could be\r\nno such _Phænomenon_, by reason of its _Northern Latitude_ at the times,\r\nwherein the _Observations_ were made, _vid._ in _April_ 1663; in the midst\r\nof _August_, and the beginning of _October_, next following, and in _April_\r\n1664, except it were in _October_, and the _Shadow_ strong enough to become\r\n_visible_.\r\n\r\nBut as to the _Shadow below_, he agrees with _Campani_, that it does\r\nappear, yet not as he notes it, seeing that it must be sometimes on the one\r\nside, sometimes on the other; and towards the _Quadrat_ with the _Sun_ it\r\nmust appear biggest, as _indeed_ he affirms to have seen it himself _this_\r\nyear, insomuch that sometimes it seemed to him, that it covered the whole\r\n_Ring_, and that the _Shadow_, joyning with the obscure space between both,\r\ndid interrupt the circumference of the _Ring_; but beholding it at other\r\ntimes in a cleer Sky, and when there was no Trepidation of the Air, {72} he\r\nthought, that he saw also the Light continued from without, although very\r\nslender. But he acknowledges, that he could never yet _precisely_\r\ndetermine, by how much the largeness of the _Ring_ was bigger than the\r\n_Diameter_ of _Saturn's_ Body. As for the proportion of the Length to the\r\nBreadth, he affirms, to have alwaies estimated it to be two and a half, or\r\nvery neer so; and to have found in his _Observations_, that in _January_\r\nlast, one time, the length of _Saturn_ was 12 _Lines_, and the breadth 5.\r\nAnother time, the length was 12. _Lines_, and the breadth 4. and this by a\r\npeculiar method of his own. But yet he acknowleges also, that sometimes he\r\nhath estimated it as 7. to 3. and at other times as 13. to 5. and that if\r\nthere do not happen a change in the magnitude of the _Ring_ (as it is not\r\nlikely there does) that must needs proceed from the Constitution of the\r\nair, or of the Glass's having more or less _Aperture_, or from the\r\ndifficulty of making an exact estimate of their proportions. However it is\r\nnot much wide (saith he) of two and a half, although _Campani_ make the\r\nlength of the _Ring_ but double to its breadth.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Auzout_ believes, that he was one of the first that have well\r\nobserved this shadow of _Saturn's_ Body upon its _Rings_ which he affirms\r\nhappened two years since; when, observing in _July_, for the first time,\r\nwith a _Telescope_ of 21. and then another of 27. foot, he perceived, that\r\nthe _Angle_ of the obscure space on the _right side_ beneath, was bigger\r\nand wider, than the three other _Angles_, and that some interruption\r\nappear'd _there_, between the _Ring_, and the _Body of Saturn_; of which he\r\nsaith to have given notice from that time to all his friends, and in\r\nparticular, as soon as conveniently he could, to Monsieur _Hugens_.\r\n\r\nHe confesseth, that he hath not had the opportunity of observing _Saturn_\r\nin his _Oriental Quadrat_; yet he doubts not, but that the _shadow_ appears\r\non the _Left-side_, considering, that the _Existence_ of the _Ring_ can be\r\nno longer doubted of, after so many _Observations_ of the _shadow_ cast by\r\n_Saturn's_ Body upon it, according as it must happen, following that\r\n_Hypothesis_; there being no reason, why it should cast the said _shadow_\r\non one side, and not on the other.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Observation of _Jupiter_ and its _satellites_, the famous\r\n_Astronomer_ of _Bononia_, _Cassinus_, having {73} published, that on the\r\n30. day of _July_, 1664. at 2½ of the clock in the morning, he had\r\nobserv'd, with _Campani_'s Glasses, that there passed through the broad\r\nobscure _Belt_ of _Jupiter_ two obscurer _spots_, by him esteemed to be the\r\n_shadows_ of the _Satellites_, moving between _Jupiter_ & the _Sun_, and\r\neclipsing him, and emerging from the Occidental Brim thereof: This\r\n_Authour_ did first conceive, that they were not _shadows_, but some\r\n_Sallies_, or _Prominencies_ in that _Belt_; which he was induced to\r\nbelieve, because he perceived not, that that _Prominency_, which he there\r\nsaw, was so black, nor so round as _Cassini_ had represented his _spots_;\r\nwherefore, seeing it but little differing in colour, from the _Belt_, and\r\nso not judging it round, because it did stand only about half its diameter\r\nout of the _Belt_, he persuaded himself, that it was rather a _Sally_, or\r\n_Prominency_ of the _Belt_, than a round _shadow_, as that of a _Satellite_\r\nof _Jupiter_ must have bin. But having been since informed of _all_ the\r\n_Observations_ made by _Cassini_ and _Campani_, with the _New_ Glasses, and\r\nseen his _Figure_, he candidly and publickly wisheth, that he had not\r\nspoken of that _Sally_, or _Prominency_; advowing that he can doubt no\r\nlonger, but that it was the _shadow_ of the _Satellit_ between _Jupiter_\r\nand the _Sun_, having seen the other emerge, as soon as with a 20. foot\r\nGlass he made the Observation, and having not perceiv'd these _shadows_\r\nwith a 12. foot Glass: But although he grants that they did ghess better\r\nthan he, yet he doth it with this _proviso_, _vid._ in case they made\r\n_that_ Observation on of _July_ 30. not with their 36. but 12. or 17. foot\r\n_Telescope_. If it be wondred at, that Monsieur _Auzout_ did not see this\r\n_shadow_ move, he allegeth his indisposition for making _long\r\nObservations_, and addeth, that it may be much more wondred at, that\r\nneither _Campani_ nor himself did see upon the obscure _Belt_ the Bodies of\r\nthe _Satellites_, as parts more Luminous than the _Belt_. For (saith he)\r\nalthough the _Latitude_ was _Meridional_, it being no more than of 9. or\r\n10. minutes, the Body of the _Satellites_ should, thinks he, pass between\r\n_us_ and the _Belt_, especially according to _Campani_, who maketh the\r\n_Belt_ so large, and puts the _shadows_ farr enough within the same. This\r\nmaketh him conclude, that either they have not observed well enough, or\r\nthat the motion of the _Satellites_ doth not exactly follow the _Belts_,\r\nand is inclin'd unto them. Whereupon he resolves, that when he shall know\r\nthat they are to pass between _Jupiter_ and _us_, and to be over against\r\nthe _Belt_, that {74} then he will observe, whether he can see them appear\r\nupon the _Belt_, as upon a darker ground, especially, the _third_ of them,\r\nwhich is sensibly greater, and more Luminous, than the rest. He hopeth\r\nalso, that in time, the _shadow_ of _Saturns Moon_ will be seen upon\r\n_Saturn_, although we are yet some years to stay for it, and to prepare\r\nalso for better Glasses.\r\n\r\nFrom this rare Observation, he inferrs the _Proportion_ of the _Diameter_\r\nof the _Satellites_ to that of _Jupiter_; and judgeth, that no longer doubt\r\ncan be made of the turning of these 4. _Satellites_, or _Moons_ about\r\n_Jupiter_, as our _Moon_ turns about the _Earth_, and after the same way as\r\nthe rest of the Celestial Bodies of our _Systeme_ do move: whence also a\r\nstrong conjecture may be made, that _Saturns_ Moon turns likewise about\r\n_Saturn_.\r\n\r\nHence he also taketh occasion to intimate, that we need not scruple to\r\nconclude, that if these two _Planets_ have _Moons_ wheeling about them, as\r\nour _Earth_ hath one that moves about it, the conformity of these _Moons_\r\nwith our _Moon_, does prove the conformity of our _Earth_ with those\r\n_Planets_, which carrying away their _Moons_ with themselves, do turn about\r\nthe _Sun_, and very probably make their _Moons_ turn about them in turning\r\nthemselves about their _Axis_; and also, that there is no cause to invent\r\nperplex'd and incredible _Hypotheses_, for the receding from this\r\n_Analogie_ since (saith he) if this be truth, the Prohibitions of\r\npublishing this doctrine, which formerly were caused by the offence of\r\nNovelty, will be laid aside, as one of the most zealous Doctors of the\r\ncontrary Opinion hath given cause to hope, witness _Eustachius de Divinis_,\r\nin his _Tract_ against Monsieur _Hugen_'s _Systeme_ of _Saturn_, _p._ 49.\r\nwhere we are inform'd, that that learned Jesuit, _P. Fabry_, Penitentiary\r\nof S _Peter_ in _Rome_, speaks to this purpose:\r\n\r\nEx vestris, iisque Coryphæis non semel quæsitum est, utrum aliquam haberent\r\ndemonstrationem pro _Terræ motu_ adstruendo. Nunquam ausi sunt id asserere\r\nNul igitur obstat quin loca illa in sensu literali Ecclesia intelligat, &\r\nintelligenda esse declaret, quamdiu nulla demonstratione contrarium\r\nevincitur; quæ si forte aliquando a vobis excogitetur (quod vix crediderim)\r\nin hoc casu nullo modo dubitabit Ecclesia declarare, loca illa in sensu\r\nfigurato & improprio intelligenda esse, ut illud Poetæ, _Terræque Urbesque\r\nrecedunt_.\r\n\r\n_It hath been more than once asked of your Chieftains, whether they had a\r\nDemonstration for asserting the motion of the Earth? They durst never yet\r\naffirm they had; wherefore nothing hinders, but that the Church may\r\nunderstand those Scripture-places, that speak of this matter, in a\r\n_literal_ sence, and declare they should be so understood, as long as the\r\ncontrary is not evinced by any demonstration; {75} which, if perhaps it\r\nshould be found out by you (which I can hardly believe it wil) in this case\r\nthe Church will not at all scruple to declare, that these places are to be\r\nunderstood in a figurative and improper sence, according to that of the\r\nPoet, _Terræque Urbesque recedunt_._\r\n\r\nWhence this Author concludes, that the said _Jesuite_ assuring us that the\r\n_inquisition_ hath not _absolutely_ declared, that those Scripture-places\r\nare to be understood _literally_, seeing that the _Church_ may make a\r\ncontrary declaration, no man ought to scruple to follow the _Hypothesis_ of\r\nthe _Earths motion_, but only forbear to maintain it in _publick_, till the\r\nprohibition be called in. But to return to the matter in hand, this Author,\r\nupon all these observations and relations of _Cassini_ and _Campani_, doth\r\nfind no reason to doubt any more of the excellency of the Glass used by\r\nthem, above his; except this difference may be imputed to that of the\r\n_Air_, or of the _Eys_. But yet he is rather inclined to ascribe it to the\r\ngoodness of their Glasses, and that the rather, because, he would not be\r\nthought to have the vanity of magnifying his own; of which, yet he\r\nintimates by the by, that he caused one to be wrought, of 150 _Parisian_\r\nfeet; which though it proved none of the best, yet he despairs not to make\r\ngood ones of _that_, and of far greater Length.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n__Signor Campani's_ Answer: and Monsieur _Auzout_'s Animadversions\r\nthereon._\r\n\r\nThe other part of this _French Tract_, conteining _Campani_'s Answer, and\r\nMr. _Auzout_ his _Reflections_ thereon, begins with the pretended _Shadows_\r\nof the _Ring_ upon _Saturn_, and of _Saturn_ upon the _Ring_. Concerning\r\nwhich, the said _Campani_ declareth, that he never believed them to be\r\n_shadows_, made by the _Ring_ upon the _Disk_ of _Saturn_, or by the body\r\nof _Saturn_ upon the _Ring_, but the _Rimms_ of these bodies, which being\r\n_unequally_ Luminous, did shew these appearances. In which Explication,\r\nforasmuch as it represents, that the said _Campani_ meant to note only the\r\n_Inequality of the Light_, which, _he saith_, his Glasses did discover, Mr.\r\n_Auzout_ does {76} so far acquiesce, that he only wishes, that his own\r\nGlasses would shew him those differences. Next to the Objection, made by\r\nMonsieur _Auzout_, against Signor _Campani_, touching the Proportion of the\r\nLength of the _Ring_ to its breadth, _Campani_ replyeth, that the Glasses\r\nof Monsieur _Auzout_, shew not all the particulars, that his do, and\r\ntherefore are unfit for determining the true Figure and breadth of the\r\napparent _Ellipsis_ of the _Ring_. To which M. _Auzout_ rejoyns, that he is\r\ndispleased at his being destitute of better Glasses, but that it will be\r\nvery hard for the future to convince _Campani_ touching the _Proportion_ of\r\nthe _Ring_, seing that the breadth of the _Ellipsis_ is always diminishing,\r\nalthough, if the declination of the _Ring_ remains always the same, one can\r\nat all times know, which may have been its greatest breadth. But he\r\nassures, that the breadth of the _Ring_ is not the half of its length, and\r\nthat it doth not spread out so much beyond _Saturn_'s Body, as he hath\r\nalleged. And withal desirs to know, what can be answered by Sig. _Campani_\r\nto M. _Hugens_, who being persuaded, that the Declination of the _Ring_ is\r\nnot above 23 deg. 30' having seen the _Ring_ to spread out above the Body\r\nof _Saturn_, concludes, in a Letter to M. _Auzout_, that the length of the\r\n_Ring_ is more than treble the _Diameter_ of _Saturn_'s body, which,\r\naccording to _Campani_, is only as about 67 to 31. Which difference yet dos\r\nnot appear to M. _Auzout_ to be so great; but that M. _Hugens_ perhaps will\r\nimpute it to the Optical reason, which he (_Auzout_) hath alleged of the\r\nAdvance of the light upon the obscure space; although he is of Opinion, he\r\nshould not have concluded so great a Length, if he had not seen the Breadth\r\nspread out more, than he hath done: for (_saith he_) if the Length of the\r\n_Ring_ be to the body of _Saturn_, 2½ to 1. and the _Inclination_ be 23\r\ndeg. 30' the _Ring_ will be just as large, as the body, without spreading\r\nout; but if the _Ring_ be bigger, it will a little spread out; and if it\r\nwere treble, it must needs spread out the half of its breadth, which hath\r\nnot so appeared to him.\r\n\r\nFurther, to M. _Auzout's_ change of Opinion, and believing, that the\r\n_Advance_ or _Sally_, seen by him in _Jupiter_, was the _Shadow_ of one of\r\nhis Moons, _Campani_ declares, that he would not have him guilty of that\r\nchange: Whereupon M. _Auzout_ wonders, why _Campani_ then hath not marked\r\nit in his _Figure_; and would {77} gladly know, whether that _Sally_ be\r\nmore easie to discover, than the _Shadows_ of the _Satellites_, which\r\n_Campani_ believs, _Auzout_ hath not seen; and whether he be assured, that\r\nthose obscure parts, which he there distinguishes, do not change: for if\r\nthey should not change, then _Jupiter_ would not turn about his _Axis_,\r\nwhich yet, he saith, it doth, according to the _Observation_ made by Mr.\r\n_Hook_, _May_ 9 1664. inserted in the first papers of these _Transactions_.\r\nThe full Discovery of which particular also he makes to be a part of\r\n_Cassini's_ and _Campani_'s work, seeing that they so distinctly see the\r\ninequalities in the _Belts_, and see also sometimes other _Spots_ besides\r\nthe _Shadows_ of the _Satellites_: where he exhorts all the Curious, that\r\nhave the conveniency of observing, to endeavor the discovery of a matter of\r\nthat importance, which would prove one of the greatest _Analogies_ for the\r\n_Earth's Motion_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of Mr. _Richard Lower_'s newly published _Vindication_ of\r\nDoctor _Willis_'s _Diatriba_ de _Febribus_._\r\n\r\nThe Title of this Curious piece, is _Diatribæ Thomæ Willisii Med.

How _Nutrition_ is performed, and the\r\nnourishing substance assimilated? Whether the Blood affords both the Matter\r\nfor the structure of the Body, and such parts also, as are fit for the\r\nnourishment of the same? Whether the Pulse of the Heart ceasing, there\r\nremains yet a certain Motion in the blood, arguing, that _Pulse_ and _Life_\r\ndo ultimately rest in the _Blood_? Whether the Umbilical Vessels convey the\r\nblood of the Mother to the Child, or whether the _Foetus_ be for the most\r\npart form'd and {78} acted by the circulating blood, before the existence\r\nof the Umbilical Vessels, or before the connecting of the _Foetus_ with the\r\n_Uterus_?

Aswel because\r\nof the expence of money, as of time also, in the _Ordinary_ way of\r\npreventing or remedying those inconveniences; which is, by letting down\r\n_shafts_ from the _day_ (as _Miners_ speak) to meet with the _Adit_; by\r\nwhich means the Air hath liberty to play through the whole work, and so\r\ntakes away bad vapours and furnishes good Air for Respiration. The Expence\r\nof which _shafts_, in regard of their vast depth, hardness of the Rock,\r\ndrawing of water, &c. doth sometimes equal, yea exceed the _ordinary_\r\ncharge of the whole _Adit_.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Expedients_ that have been devised to remedy this, there is\r\none practised in the _Coal-mines_, near the Town of _Liege_ (or _Luyck_)\r\nthat seems preferable to all others for Efficacy, Ease, and Cheapness: the\r\ndescription whereof followeth.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth or entry of the _Adit_ there is a structure raised of _Brick_,\r\nlike a _Chimney_, some 28. or 30. foot high in all: at the bottom, two\r\nopposite sides are (or may be) some 5½ foot broad; and the other two, 5.\r\nfoot: the wall 1½ _Brick_ thick. At the lower part of it, is a hole, some\r\n9. or 10. inches square, for taking out of the Ashes, which when it is\r\ndone, this Ash-hole is immediately stopt so close, as Air cannot possibly\r\nget in at any part of it. Then, some 3. foot above ground or more, there is\r\non that side, that is next to the _Adit_ or Pit, a square hole of 8. or 9.\r\ninches every way, by which the Air enters to make the Fire burn: Into this\r\nhole there is fixed a square _Tube_ or _Pipe_ of Wood, whereof the Joints\r\nand Chinks are so stopt with Parchment pasted or glewed upon them, that the\r\nAir can no where get in to the Pipe but at the end: And this Pipe is still\r\nlengthened, as the _Adit_ or Pit advanceth, by fitting the new Pipes so, as\r\none end is alwaies thrust into the other, and the Joints and Chinks still\r\ncarefully cemented and stopt as before. So the Pipe or Tube being still\r\ncarried on, as near as is necessary, to the wall or place, where fresh Air\r\nis requisite; the Fire within the Chimney doth still attract {81} (so to\r\nspeak) Air through the Tube, without which it cannot burn, which yet it\r\nwill do, as is obvious to conceive (all Illustrations and Philosophical\r\nExplications being here superfluous,) and so, while the Air is drawn by the\r\nfire from the farthest or most inward part of the _Mine_ or _Adit_, fresh\r\nAir must needs come in from without to supply the place of the other, which\r\nby its motion doth carry away with it all the ill vapors, that breath out\r\nof the ground; by which meanes the whole _Adit_ will be alwaies filled with\r\nfresh Air, so that men will there breath as surely as abroad, and not only\r\nCandles burn, but Fire, when upon occasion there is use for it for breaking\r\nof the Rock.\r\n\r\nNow that there may be no want of such fresh Air, the Fire must alwaies be\r\nkept burning in the Chimney, or at least as frequently as is necessary: For\r\nwhich purpose there must be two of the Iron Grates or Chimneys, that when\r\nany accident befals the one, the other may be ready to be in its place, the\r\nCoals being first well kindled in it: but when the fire is neer spent, the\r\nChimney or Grate being haled up to the dore, is to be supplied with fresh\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nThe Figure of the Fabrick, Chimney, and all the parts thereof being\r\nhereunto annexed, the rest will be easily understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Figure_ 1.\r\n\r\nA.

The manner is, as followeth.\r\n\r\nThe _Mine_ or _Adit_ is to be made seven or eight foot high, which though\r\nit seem to make more work downwards, yet will be found necessary for making\r\nthe better dispatch by rendring the Invention more effectual.\r\n\r\nThere is a _Tool_ or _Iron_ well steeled at the end, which cuts the Rock,\r\n(of the shape shewed by _Fig._ 2. here annexed,) 20. or 22. Inches long or\r\nmore, and some 2½ Inches _Diameter_ at the steeled end, the rest being\r\nsomewhat more slender. The steeled end is so shaped, as makes it most apt\r\nto pierce the Rock, the Angles at that end being still to be made the more\r\nobtuse, the harder the Rock is. This _Tool_ is to be first held by the\r\nhand, in the place, where the Hole, to be made for the use, which shall\r\nhere be shewed, is to be placed; that is, in the middle between the sides\r\nof the Rock, that is to be cut, but as near the bottom as may be. The\r\n_Tool_ being placed, is to be struck upon with an Hammer, the heavier the\r\nbetter, either suspended by a Shaft turning upon a Pin, or otherwise, so as\r\none man may manage the Hammer, while another holds the Tool or Piercer. If\r\nit be hung in a _Frame_, or other convenient way, he that manageth it hath\r\nno more to do, but to pull it up at first as high as he can, and let it\r\nfall again by its own weight, the motion being so directed, as to be sure\r\nto hit the Piercer right. After the stroke of the Hammer, he that holds the\r\nPiercer, is to turn it a little on its point; so that the Edges or Angles\r\nat the point may all strike upon a new place; and so it must still be\r\nshifted after every stroke, by which means small Chipps will at every\r\nstroke be broken off, which must from time to time be taken out, as need\r\nrequires. And thus the work must be continued, till the _Hole_ be 18. or\r\n20. Inches deep, the deeper the better. This _Hole_ being made as deep as\r\nis required, and kept as streight and smooth in the sides, as is possible,\r\nthere is then a kind of double _Wedge_ to be made, and {84} fitted exactly\r\nfor it; the shape whereof is to be seen in the annexed 3. Figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis double _Wedge_, being 12. or 13. Inches long, each piece of it, and so\r\nmade, as being placed in their due position they may make up a _Cylinder_,\r\nbut _Diagonal_-wise. The two flat sides that are contiguous, are to be\r\ngreased or oyled, that the one may slip the more easily upon the other; and\r\none of them, which is to be uppermost, having at the great end a hollow\r\n_Crease_ cut into it round about, for fastening a _Cartridge_, full of\r\n_Gunpowder_, to it with a thred, the round end of the _Wedge_ being pared\r\nas much as the thickness of the Paper or Pastboard, that holds the Powder,\r\nneeds to make the outside thereof _even_ with the rest of the _Wedge_. This\r\n_Wedge_ must have an Hole drilled through the longest side of it, to be\r\nfilled with _priming Powder_, for firing of the Powder in the _Cartridge_;\r\nwhich needs have no more, than half a pound of Powder, though upon occasion\r\na greater quantity may be used, as shall be found requisite.\r\n\r\nThen this _Wedge_, being first thrust into the Hole with the _Cartridge_,\r\nthe round side, whether the Priming-hole is, being uppermost, the other\r\n_Wedge_ is to be thrust in, home to the due position, care being taken,\r\nthat they fit the Hole in the Rock as exactly as may be. Then the end of\r\nthe lower _Wedge_ being about an Inch longer, than that of the upper\r\noutwardly, and flatned, priming Powder is to be laid upon it; and a piece\r\nof burning _Match_ or _Thread_ dipt in _Brimstone_ or other such prepared\r\ncombustible Matter, fastned to it, that may burn so long before it fire the\r\nPowder, as he, that orders it, may have time enough to retire quite out the\r\nPit or _Adit_, having first placed a piece of Wood or Iron so, as one end\r\nthereof, being set against the end of the lower Wedge, and the other\r\nagainst the side-wall, so as it cannot slip. Which being done, and the Man\r\nretired, when the Powder comes to take fire, it will first drive out the\r\nuppermost Wedge, as far as it will go, but the slaunting figure of it being\r\nso made, as the farther it goes backward, the thicker it grows, till at the\r\nlast it can go no farther, then the {85} fire tears the Rock to get forth,\r\nand so cracks and breaks it all about, that at one time a vast deal of it\r\nwill either be quite blown out, or so crackt and broken, as will make it\r\neasie to be remov'd: And according to the effect of one such _Cartridge_,\r\nmore may be afterwards made use of, as hath been said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Observables upon a _Monstrous Head_._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis was the Head of a _Colt_, represented in the annexed _Figure_ 4. first\r\nviewed by Mr. _Boyle_, who went into the Stable where the _Colt_ lay, and\r\ngot the Head hastily and rudely cut off, the _Body_ thereof appearing to\r\nhis Eye compleately formed, without any _Monstrosity_ to be taken notice of\r\nin it. Afterwards he caused it to be put into a Vessel, and covered with\r\n_Spirit of Wine_ thereby chiefly intending, to give good example, together\r\nwith a proof, that by the help of the said _Spirit_, (which he hath\r\nrecommended for such Properties in one of his _Essays_ of the _Usefulness_\r\nof _Natural Philosophy_) the parts of _Animals_, and even _Monsters_, may\r\nin _Summer_ it self be preserved long enough to afford _Anatomists_ the\r\nopportunities of examining them.\r\n\r\nThe Head being opened, and examined, it was found.\r\n\r\n_First_, That it had no sign of any _Nose_ in the usual place, nor had it\r\nany, in any other place of the Head, unless the double Bag CC, that grew\r\nout of the midst of the forehead, were some rudiment of it.\r\n\r\n_Next_, That the _two Eyes_ were united into one _Double Eye_, which was\r\nplaced just in the middle of the Brow, the Nose being wanting, which should\r\nhave separated them, whereby the two Eye-holes in the Scull were united\r\ninto one very large round hole, into the midst of which, from the Brain,\r\nentred one pretty large _Optik Nerve_, at the end of which grew a great\r\n_Double Eye_; that is, that _Membrane_, called _Sclerotis_, which contained\r\nboth, was one and the same, but seemed to have a _Seam_, {86} by which they\r\nwere joined, to go quite round it, and the fore or pellucid part was\r\ndistinctly separated into two _Cornea_'s by a white _Seam_ that divided\r\nthem. Each _Cornea_ seemed to have its _Iris_, (or Rain-bow-like Circle)\r\nand Apertures or Pupils distinct; and upon opening the _Cornea_, there was\r\nfound within it two _Balls_, or _Crystalline Humours_, very well shaped;\r\nbut the other parts of it could not be so well distinguished, because the\r\neye had been much bruised by the handling, and the inner parts confused and\r\ndislocated. It had four Eye-browes, placed in the manner exprest in Figure\r\n4. by a a, b b; a a representing the _lower_, and b b, the _upper_\r\nEye-lids.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, That just above the Eyes, as it were in the midst of the\r\nForehead, was a very deep depression, and out of the midst of that grew a\r\nkind of double _Purse_ or _Bagg_, C C, containing little or nothing in it;\r\nbut to some it seemed to be a production of the matter designed for the\r\nNose, but diverted by this Monstrous Conception; perhaps the _Processus\r\nmammillares_ joyned into one, and covered with a thin hairy skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Observables in the Body of the _Earl_ of _Balcarres_._\r\n\r\nThese following Observations, were a while since sent out of _Scotland_ by\r\nan ingenious person, an Eye-witness, to Sir _Robert Moray_.\r\n\r\n1. That the Belly of this Nobleman being opened, the _Omentum_ or _Net_ was\r\nfound lean and small: his _Liver_ very big; the _Spleen_ big also, filled\r\nwith a black and thick humour. His _Stomack_ and _Entralls_ all empty, of a\r\nSaffron-colour, distended with wind only. The _Bladder_ of _Gall_ swelled\r\nwith a black humour: The _Kidneys_ filled with a kind of _grumous blood_.\r\n\r\n2. That in the _Thorax_ or _Chest_, the _Lobes_ of the _Lungs_ were all\r\nentire, but of a bad colour; on the left side somewhat black and blue, and\r\non the right, whitish; with a yellowish knob under one of the _Lobes_. {87}\r\n\r\n3. That the _Pericardium_ or the _Case_ of the _Heart_ being opened, there\r\nappeared none of that water, in which the _Heart_ uses to swim; and the\r\nexternal Surface of it, from the _Base_ to the _Tipp_, was not smooth, but\r\nvery rough. It being cut asunder, a quantity of white and inspissate\r\nliquour run out, and beneath the _Base_, between the right and left\r\nVentricle, _two stones_ were found, whereof the one was as bigg as an\r\n_Almond_, the other, _two_ Inches long and _one_ broad, having three\r\n_Auricles_ or crisped _Angles_: And in the Orifice of the right Ventricle,\r\nthere was a fleshy fattish Matter.\r\n\r\n4. That the whole Body was bloudless, thin, and emaciated, of a black and\r\nbluish Colour.\r\n\r\n5. The _Scull_ being opened, both the _Cerebrum_ and _Cerebellum_ were bigg\r\nin proportion to the Body; and out of it run much more Bloud, than was seen\r\nin both the other Regions together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the designed Progress to be made in the _Breeding of Silkworms_, and\r\nthe _Making_ of _Silk_, in _France_._\r\n\r\nThe _French_ King _Henry the Fourth_, having made a general Establishment\r\nall over _France_, of planting and propagating of _Mulberry-trees_, and\r\n_Breeding of Silkworms_, in order to set up and entertain a _Silk-trade_\r\nthere; and having prospered so well in that Design, that in many parts of\r\nhis Dominions great store of such Trees were raised, and Multitudes of\r\nSilk-works propagated, to the great benefit of the _French_ people,\r\nforasmuch as it was a considerable beginning to avoid the transport of\r\nseveral Millions abroad for buying of Silks, and withall an excellent means\r\nof well-imploying abundance of poor Orphans and Widows, and many old, lame,\r\nand other indigent and helpless people; The present _French King_, hath\r\nlately revived and seconded that Undertaking by giving express order that\r\nit should be promoted by all possible means, and particularly in the\r\n_Metropolis_ of that Kingdom, and round about it; and that for that end the\r\nwhole way concerning that Work and {88} Trade should be fully and\r\npunctually communicated in Print; which hath also been executed by one\r\n_Monsieur Isnard_, in a Treatise published at _Paris_, in _French_,\r\nIntituled, _Instructions for the Planting of White Mulberryes, the Breeding\r\nof Silkworms, and the Ordering of Silk in _Paris_, and the circumjacent\r\nPlaces_, In which Book, the Method being represented, which that Great\r\nPrince _Henry_ IV used in establishing the said Work and Trade, together\r\nwith the success thereof, and the advantages thence derived to his\r\nSubjects, the _Author_, from his own _Experience_, and long _Practice_,\r\ndelivers (and seems to do it candidly) all what belongs in this business in\r\nfour main heads. _First_, he teaches the Means of sowing, planting, and\r\nraising _White Mulberryes_ (as the Foundation of Silkworks) shewing how\r\nmany several wayes _that_ may be done. _Secondly_, The Breeding of\r\n_Silkworms_, the choosing of good Eggs, and their hatching, as also the\r\nFeeding of the _Worms_, and preserving them from sickness, and Curing them\r\nof it, together with the way of making them spin to best advantage.\r\n_Thirdly_, The manner of winding their Silk from their Bottoms, adding the\r\n_Scheme_ of the _Instrument_ serving for that purpose. _Fourthly_, The way\r\nof _keeping_ _Silkworms_ Eggs for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole Book are scattered many not inconsiderable particulars,\r\nthough perhaps known to most. The _White Mulberry Tree_, as it is in other\r\nqualities preferable to the _Black_, so this _Author_ esteems it the best,\r\nnot only for the durableness of the wood, and its large extent of\r\nusefulness in Carpentry and Joyners work; but also for the fitness of its\r\nleaves (besides their principal use for the food of _Silkworms_) to fatten\r\nSheep, Goats, Cowes, and Hoggs, only by boyling and mingling them with\r\nBran. The Berryes themselves he commends as very excellent to fatten\r\nPoultry, and to make them lay Eggs plentifully. In the _Changes_,\r\n_Working_, and _Generation_ of this _Insect_, he is very curious to observe\r\nmany things. Their _Metamorphoses_, as is known, are four, whereof the form\r\nof the one hath no conformity with any of the rest. The first from an Egge\r\n(of the bigness of a Mustard-seed, and of a darkish Gray Colour, when good)\r\nto a _Worm_ or _Caterpillar_, but of a domestick, noble, and profitable\r\nkind, _Black_, when it first comes {89} forth, but growing _white_ at last;\r\nhaving 24. feet, 8. on each side of the body, and 4. besides, close to each\r\nside of the head. During this form, they undergo constantly 4. Sicknesses,\r\nin which they cast their Skins, each sickness lasting about 4. days,\r\nwherein they feed not at all; but grow clearer, shorter, and thicker. The\r\nsecond from a _Worm_ to an _Aurelia_ or _Chrysalis_, having the shape of a\r\nsmall Plum, whereunto it is transformed after its spinning time is past; in\r\nwhich state it lies shut up, in hot Countries, for 14. or 15. dayes; in\r\nmore temperate ones, 18. or 20. without any Food or Air, known to us.\r\nDuring which time this _Insect_ leaves two Coats, both that of a _Worm_,\r\nwhence 'tis changed into an _Aurelia_, and that of an _Aurelia_, whence it\r\nbecomes a _Papilio_ or _Butterfly_, in the _Theca_ or _Case_. The third is,\r\nfrom an _Aurelia_ to a _Butterfly_, coming out of the _Theca_ with a head,\r\nleggs, and horns; for which passage it makes way by a whitish water, it\r\ncasts upon the Silk, which moistning, and thereby in a manner putrefying\r\nit, the new creature thrusts out its head through the sharp end of the\r\n_Case_, by a Hole as big as its self. There is found no Excrement in the\r\n_Case_, but the two Skins only, just now mentioned.\r\n\r\nBefore they begin to spin, and about the latter end of their feeding, they\r\nmust, saith the _Author_, be often changed, and have Air enough, by opening\r\nthe Windows of the Room, they are in, if it be not too ill Weather; else,\r\nsaith he, the Silk that is in their Belly, will cause so extraordinary a\r\nheat in them, that it burns their gutts, and sometimes bursts them; and the\r\nsame (being a substance that resembleth Gum or Burgundy Pitch) will putrefy\r\nand turn into a yellowish matter.\r\n\r\nHe maketh the best marks of their maturity for spinning to be, when they\r\nbegin to quit their white Colour, & their green and yellow Circles, and\r\ngrow of the Colour of Flesh, especially upon the tail; having a kind of\r\n_consistent_ softness shewing that they have something substantial in their\r\nStomachs.\r\n\r\nAs for their _Working_, he gives this account of it, that the first day\r\nthey make only a _Webb_; the second, they form in this _Webb_ their\r\n_Cases_, and cover themselves all over with Silk; the third day, they are\r\nno longer seen, and the dayes following they thicken their _Cases_, alwayes\r\nby one _end_ or _thread_, which they {90} never break off, themselves.\r\nThis, he affirms, they put out with so much quickness, and draw it so\r\nsubtle and so long, that without an _Hyperbole_, the _end_ or _thread_ of\r\nevery _Case_ may have two Leagues in length. He advertiseth, that they must\r\nbe by no means interrupted in their work, to the end, that all the Silk,\r\nthey have in their bellyes, may come out.\r\n\r\nSome eight dayes after they have finished their Work, as many of the best\r\n_Cases_, as are to serve for _seed_, _viz._ the first done the hardest, the\r\nreddest and best coloured, must be chosen, and put a-part; and all\r\ndiligence is to be used to winde off the silk with as much speed, as may\r\nbe, especially if the _Worms_ have nimbly dispatched their work.\r\n\r\nHere he spends a good part of his Book, in giving very particular\r\nInstructions, concerning the way of winding off the silk, setting also down\r\nthe form of the Oven and Instruments necessary for that work, which is the\r\npainfullest and nicest of all the rest.\r\n\r\nTouching their _Generation_, he prescribeth that there be chosen as many\r\nmale as female _Cases_ (which are discerned by this, that the males are\r\nmore pointed at both ends of the _Cases_, and the females more obtuse on\r\nthe ends, and bigger-bellyed) and that care be had, that no _Cases_ be\r\ntaken, but such wherein the _Worms_ are heard rolling; which done, and they\r\nbeing come forth in the form of _Butterflies_, having four wings, six feet,\r\ntwo horns, and two very black eyes, and put in a convenient place, the\r\nmales fluttering with their wings, will joyn and couple with the females,\r\nafter that these have first purged themselves of a kind of reddish humour\r\nby the fundament: in which posture they are to be left from Morning (which\r\nis the ordinary time of their coming forth) till evening, and then the\r\nfemales are to be gently pulled away, whereupon they will lay their eggs,\r\nhaving first let fall by the Fundament another humour, esteemed to proceed\r\nfrom the seed of the males; but the males are then thrown away as useless.\r\nHe advertiseth, that if they be coupled longer than 9. or 10. hours, (which\r\nthey will be, and that sometimes for 24. hours together, if they be let\r\nalone) either the female will receive very great hurt by it, or much seed\r\nwill remain in her belly. {91}\r\n\r\nThe seed at first coming out is very white, but within a day it becoms\r\ngreenish, then red, at last by little and little gray, which colour it\r\nretains alwaies, the most coloured of an obscure gray, being the best;\r\nthose grains which never quit their whiteness, having no fecundity in them.\r\n\r\nEach female emits ordinarily some 300 grains, more or less, some of them\r\nnot being able to render them all, and dying with them in their belly. One\r\nounce of seed will require an hundred pair of _Cases_, of as many Males as\r\nFemales.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken, that no Rats, Mice, Ants, or other Vermin, nor any\r\nHens, or Birds, come near the Seed, they being very greedy to eat them.\r\n\r\nThis is the substance of what is contained in this _French_ Author,\r\npublished at _Paris_ on purpose to promote the _Making_ of _Silk_ there, as\r\nwell as it is practised already in other parts of that Kingdom; which is\r\nrepresented here, to the end, that from this occasion the design, which the\r\nEnglish Nation once did entertain of the _increasing of Mulberry trees_,\r\nand the _Breeding of Silk-worms_, for the _Making of Silk_ within\r\nthemselves, may be renewed, and _that_ encouragement given by King _James_\r\nof Glorious memory for that purpose (witness that _Letter_ which he\r\ndirected to the Lords Lievtenants of the several shires of _England_) and\r\nseconded by his _Most Excellent Majesty_, that now is, be made use of, for\r\nthe honour of _England_ and _Virginia_, and the increase of wealth to the\r\npeople thereof; especially since there is cause of hope, that a _double\r\nSilk harvest_ may be made in _one_ Summer in _Virginia_, without hindring\r\nin the least the _Tobacco_-Trade of that Countrey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Enquiries concerning _Agriculture_._\r\n\r\nWhereas the _Royal Society_, in prosecuting the _Improvements of Natural\r\nknowledge_, have it in design, to collect _Histories of Nature and Arts_,\r\nand for that purpose have already, according to the several Inclinations\r\nand Studies of their Members, divided themselves into divers _Commitees_,\r\nto execute the said design: Those Gentlemen, which do constitute the\r\n_Commitee_ for considering of _Agriculture_, and the _History_ and\r\n_Improvement_ thereof, have begun their work with drawing up certain {92}\r\nHeads of _Enquiries_, to be distributed to persons _Experienced in\r\nHusbandry_ all over _England_, _Scotland_, and _Ireland_, for the procuring\r\na _faithful_ and _solid_ information of the _knowledge_ and _practice_\r\nalready obtained and used in these Kingdoms; whereby, besides the aid which\r\nby this means will be given to the general End of collecting the\r\naforementioned _History_, every place will be advantaged by the helps, that\r\nare found in any, and occasion ministred to consider, what improvements may\r\nbe further made in this whole matter. Now to the End, that those\r\n_Enquiries_ may be the more universally known, and those who are skilful in\r\nHusbandry, publickly invited to impart their knowledge herein, for the\r\n_common_ benefit of their Countrey, it hath been thought fit to publish the\r\n_effect_ of them in Print, and withal to desire that what such persons\r\nshall think good from their own _Knowledge_ and _Experience_ to communicate\r\nhereupon, they would be pleased to send it to the Printers of the _Royal\r\nSociety_, to be delivered to either of the _Secretaries_ of same. The\r\nEnquiries follow.\r\n\r\n1. For _Arable_.\r\n\r\n1.

Bertet_ hath written of it, is true. We have seen the effects\r\nof it repeated over and over again, in the Morning, at Noon, and in the\r\nAfternoon, alwaies performing very powerfully; burning or melting any\r\nMatter, very few excepted. The _Figure_ of it is round, being thirty\r\nInches, and somewhat better in _Diameter_. On one side it hath a Frame of a\r\nCircle of Steel, to the end that it may keep its just Measure: 'Tis easie\r\nto remove it from place to place, though it be above an hundred weight, and\r\n'tis easily put in all sorts of postures. The _burning Point_ is distant\r\nfrom the Centre of the Glass, about three Feet. The _Focus_ is about half a\r\n_Louys d'or_ large. One may pass ones hand through it, if it be done\r\nnimbly; for if it stay there the time of a second Minute, there is danger\r\nof receiving much hurt.\r\n\r\n_Green wood_ takes fire in it, in an instant, as do also many other Bodies.\r\n\r\n  A small peice of _Pot-Iron_ was melted, and                _Seconds_\r\n    ready to drop down, in                                      40.\r\n  A _Silver Peice_ of 15 _Pence_ was pierced, in                24.\r\n  A _gross Nail_ (called _le Claude paisan_) was melted, in     30.\r\n  The end of a _Sword-blade_ of _Olinde_, was burn'd, in        43.\r\n  A _Brass Counter_ was pierced, in                             06.\r\n  A piece of _red Copper_ was melted ready to drop down, in     42.\r\n  {97}\r\n  A peice of a _Chamber Quarry-stone_ was vitrified,\r\n    and put into a Glass-drop, in                               45.\r\n  _Steel_, whereof Watch-makers make their springs,\r\n    was found melted, in                                        09.\r\n  A _Mineral-Stone_, such as is used in Harquebusses\r\n    _à rovët_, was calcin'd and vitrified, in                   1. _just._\r\n  A peice of _Morter_ was vitrified, in                         52.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is hardly any Body, which is not destroyed by this Fire. If\r\none would melt it by it any great quantity of Mettal, that would require\r\nmuch time, the Action of Burning not being perform'd but within the bigness\r\nof the _Focus_, so that ordinarily none but small pieces are exposed to it.\r\nOne Mounsieur _de Alibert_ buys it, paying for it Fifteen hundred Livers.\r\n\r\nSince this Information, there were, upon occasion given from thence, upon\r\nthe same subject, further communicated from _Paris_ the following\r\nParticulars.\r\n\r\nI see by two of the Letters, that you incline to believe, the Glasses of\r\n_Maginus_ and _Septalius_ do approach to that of _Lyons_: But I can assure\r\nyou, they come very far short of it. You may consult _Maginus_ his Book,\r\nwhere he describes his; and there are some persons here that have seen one\r\nof his best, which had but about twenty Inches Diameter; so that this of\r\n_Lyons_ must perform at least twice as much. As to _Septalius_, we expect\r\nthe Relations of it from Intelligent and Impartial men. It cannot well be\r\ncompared to that of _Lyons_: but in bigness; and in this case, if it have\r\nfive _Palms_ (as you say) that would be about 3½ feet _French_, and so it\r\nwere a Foot bigger, which would make it half as much greater in surface:\r\nBut as to the Effects, seeing it burns so far off, they cannot be very\r\nviolent. And I have heard one say, that had seen it, that it did not set\r\nWood on Fire but after the time of saying a _Miserere_. You may judge of\r\nthe difference of the Effects, since that of _Lyons_ gathers its Beams\r\ntogether within the space of seven or eight _Lines_; {98} and that of\r\n_Septalius_ must scatter them in the compass of three Inches. Some here do\r\nintend to make of them yea and bigger ones; but we must stay till they be\r\ndone, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf _Monsieur _Hevelius_'s Promise of imparting to the World his Invention\r\nof making _Optick Glasses_; and of the hopes given by Monsieur _Hugens_ of\r\n_Zulichem_, to perform something of the like nature; as also of the\r\nExpectations, conceived of some Ingenious Persons in _England_ to improve_\r\nTelescopes.\r\n\r\nThat eminent Astronomer of _Dantzick_, Monsieur _Hevelius_, writes to his\r\nCorrespondent in _London_, as followeth:\r\n\r\nWhat hath been done in the grinding of Optick-glasses in your parts, and\r\nhow those beginnings, mentioned by you formerly, do continue and succeed, I\r\nvery much covet to hear, 'Tis now above Ten Years, since I my self invented\r\na peculiar way of grinding such Glasses, and reduced it also into practice;\r\nby which 'tis easie, without any considerable danger of failing, to make\r\nand polish Optick-glasses of any _Conick_ Section, and that (which is most\r\nnotable) in any dish of any Section of a _Sphere_: which Invention I have\r\nas yet discovered to none, my purpose being, for the Improvement of Natural\r\nKnowledge, to describe the whole method thereof in my _Celestial Machine_,\r\nand to propose it to the Examination and Judgment of the _Royal Society_;\r\nnot doubting at all, but they will find the way true and practicable, my\r\nself having already made several Glasses by it, which many Learned Men have\r\nseen and tryed.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Hugens_, inquiring also in a Letter, newly written by him to a\r\nFriend of his in _England_, of the success of the attempts made by an\r\ningenious _English_ Man for perfecting such Glasses, and urging the\r\nprosecution of the same, {99} so as to shew by the effects the\r\npracticableness of the Invention, mentions thereupon, That he intends very\r\nshortly to try something in that kind, of the success whereof he declares\r\nto have good hopes.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _du Son_, that excellent Mechanician, doth also at this very\r\npresent employ himself in _London_, to bring _Telescopes_ to perfection, by\r\ngrinding Glasses of a _Parabolical_ Figure, by the means whereof he hopes\r\nto enable the Curious to discover more by a Tube of one Foot long, or\r\nthereabouts, furnished with Glasses thus figured, then can be done by any\r\nother Tubes of very many times more that length: The success hereof will\r\n('tis thought) shortly appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Advertisement of a way of making more lively Counterfeits of Nature in\r\n_Wax_, then are extant in _Painting_: And of a new kind of _Maps_ in a low\r\n_Relievo_. Both practised in_ France.\r\n\r\nThis was communicated by the Ingenious Mr. _John Evelyn_, to whom it was\r\nsent from _Paris_ is a Letter, as followeth.\r\n\r\nHere is in our Neighbourhood a _French-man_, who makes more lively\r\nCounterfeits of Nature in _Wax_, then ever I yet saw in _Painting_, haveing\r\nan extraordinary address in modelling the Figures, and mixing the Colours\r\nand Shadows; making the Eyes so lively, that they kill all things of this\r\nArt I ever beheld; He pretends to make a visit into _England_ with some of\r\nhis Peices.\r\n\r\nI have also seen a new kind of _Maps_ in low _Relievo_, or Sculpture; For\r\nexample the Isle of _Antibe_, upon a square of about eight Foot, made of\r\nBoards, with a Frame like a Picture: There is represented the Sea, with\r\nShips and other Vessels Artificially made, with their _Canons_ and Tackle\r\nof Wood fixed upon the surface, after a new and most admirable manner. The\r\nRocks about the Island exactly form'd, {100} as they are upon the Natural\r\nPlace; and the Island it self, with all its Inequalities, and Hills and\r\nDales; the Town, the Forts, the little Houses, Platform, and Canons\r\nmounted; and even the Gardens and Platforms of Trees, with their green\r\nleaves standing upright, at if they were growing in their Natural Colours:\r\nin _fine_, Men, Beasts, and whatever you may imagine to have any\r\nprotuberancy above the level of the Sea. This new, delightful, and most\r\ninstructive form of _Map_, or _Wooden Country_, you are to look upon either\r\n_Horizontally_, or _side-long_, and it affords equally a very pleasant\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some _Anatomical_ Observations of Milk found in Veins, instead of Blood;\r\nand of Grass, found in the Wind-pipes of some _Animals_._\r\n\r\nA curious Person wrote not long since from _Paris_, that there they had, in\r\nthe house of a Physitian, newly open'd a Mans Vein, wherein they found\r\n_Milk_, instead of _Blood_. This being imparted to Mr. _Boyle_ at _Oxford_,\r\nhis Answer was, That the like Observation about _White Blood_, had been\r\nmade by a Learned Physitian of his acquaintance, and the thing being by him\r\nlook'd upon as remarkable, he was desirous to have it very circumstantially\r\nfrom the said Physitian himself, before he would say more of it. The next\r\nMoneth may bring us in this Account.\r\n\r\nThe other Particular, mention'd in the Title of this Head, came in a Letter\r\nsent also by Mr. _Boyle_, in these words:\r\n\r\nI shall acquaint you, That Two very Ingenious Men, Dr. _Clark_, and Dr.\r\n_Lower_, were pleased to give me an account of a pretty odd kind of\r\nObservation: One of them assuring me, That he had several times, in the\r\n_Lungs_ of _Sheep_, found considerable quantity of Grass in the very\r\nBranches of the _Aspera Arteria_: And the other relating to me, That a few\r\nWeeks since, he, and a couple of {101} Physitians, were invited to look\r\nupon an Ox, that had for two or three daies almost continually held his\r\nNeck streight up, and was dead of a Disease, the owner could not conjecture\r\nat; whereupon the parts belonging to the Neck and Throat, being open'd,\r\nthey found, to their wounder, the _Aspera Arteria_ in its very Trunk all\r\nstuff'd with Grass as if it had been thrust there by main force: which\r\ngives us a just cause of marvelling and inquiring, both how such a quantity\r\nof Grass should get in there; and how, being there, such an Animal could\r\nlive with it so long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a place in _England_, where, without petrifying Water, Wood is turned\r\ninto Stone._\r\n\r\nThe same Searcher of Nature, that was alledged in the immediately precedent\r\nObservations, did impart also the following, in another Letter from\r\n_Oxford_, where he saith,\r\n\r\nI was a while since visited by a Gentleman, who tells me, That he met with\r\na place in these parts of _England_, where, though there be no petrifying\r\nSpring (for that I particularly asked) Wood is turned into Stone in the\r\n_Sandy Earth_ it self, after a better manner then by any Water I have yet\r\nseen: For I had the Curiosity to go to look upon peices of Wood, he brought\r\nthence, and hope for the opportunity of making some tryals to examine the\r\nmatter a little further, then I have yet been able to do. _Thus far that\r\nLetter._\r\n\r\nSince which time, He was pleased to give this further Information of the\r\nsame matter, with a _Mantissa_ of some other Particulars, belonging to this\r\nSubject, in these Words.\r\n\r\nI was lately making some Tryals with the Petrifyed Wood I told you off,\r\nwhich I find to be a very odde substance, wonderfully hard and fixed. If I\r\nhad opportunity to Re-print the _History of Fluidity_ and _Firmness_, I\r\ncould add divers things about _Stones_, that perhaps would not be disliked;\r\nand I hope, if God vouchsafe me a little leisure, {102} to insert several\r\nof them in fit places of that _History_, against the next Edition. Here is\r\na certain Stone, that is thought to be Petrifyed Bone, being in shap'd like\r\na Bone, with the Marrow taken out; but with a fit _Menstruum_, I found that\r\nI could easily dissolve it, like other soft Stones: and possibly it may\r\nprove as fit as _Osteocolla_, for the same Medicinal uses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the nature of a certain Stone, found in the _Indies_, in the head of a\r\n_Serpent_._\r\n\r\nThere was, some while ago, sent by Sir _Philiberto Vernatti_, from _Java\r\nmajor_, where he resides, to Sir _Robert Moray_, for the Repository of the\r\n_Royal Society_, a certain Stone, affirmed by the presenter to be found in\r\nthe Head of a _Snake_, which laid upon any Wound, made by any venomous\r\nCreature, is said to stick to it, and to draw away all Poyson: and then,\r\nbeing put in Milk, to void its Poyson therein, and to make the Milk turn\r\nblew; in which manner it must be used, till the Wound be cleansed.\r\n\r\nThe like Relations having been made, by several others, of such a Stone,\r\nand some also in this City affirming, to have made the Experiment with\r\nsuccess, it was thought worth while, to inquire further into the truth of\r\nthis Matter: since which time, nothing hath been met with but an\r\nInformation, delivered by that Ingenious _Parisian_, Monsieur _Thevenot_,\r\nin his second _Tome_, of the _Relations of divers considerable Voyages_,\r\nwhereof he lately presented some Exemplars to his Friends in _England_. The\r\nBook being in French, and not common, 'tis conceived it will not be amiss\r\nto insert here the said Information, which is to this effect:\r\n\r\nIn the _East Indies_ and in the Kingdom of _Quamsy_ in _China_, there is\r\nfound a Stone in the Head of a certain _Serpent_ (which they call by a name\r\nsignifying _Hairy Serpents_) which heals the bitings of the same Serpent,\r\nthat else would kill in 24 hours. This Stone is round, white in the middle\r\nand about the {103} edges blew or greenish. Being applyed to the Wound, it\r\nadheres to it of it self, and falls not off, but after it hath sucked the\r\nPoyson, then they wash it in Milk, wherein 'tis left awhile, till it return\r\nto its natural condition. It is a rare Stone, for if it be put the second\r\ntime upon the Wound, and stick to it, 'tis a sign it had not suck'd all the\r\nVenome during its first application, but if it stick not, 'tis a mark that\r\nall the Poyson was drawn out at first. So far our _French_ Author: wherein\r\nappears no considerable difference from the written Relation before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the way, used in the _Mogol_'s Dominions, to make _Saltpetre_._\r\n\r\nThis is delivered in the same Book of Monsieur _Thevenot_, and the manner\r\nof it having been inquired after, by several curious Persons, to compare it\r\nwith that which is used in _Europe_, 'tis presum'd, they will not be\r\ndispleased to find it inserted here in _English_, which is as followeth:\r\n\r\n_Saltpetre_ is found in many places of the _East-Indies_, but cheifly about\r\n_Agra_, and in the Villages, that heretofore have been numerously\r\ninhabited, but are now deserted. They draw it out of three sorts of Earth,\r\nblack, yellow, and white: the best is that which is drawn out of the black,\r\nfor it is free from _common_ Salt. They work it in this manner: They make\r\ntwo Pits, flat at the bottom, like those wherein common Salt is made; one\r\nof them having much more compass than the other, they fill _that_ with\r\nEarth, upon which they let run Water, and by the feet of People they tread\r\nit, and reduce it to the consistency of a Pap, and so they let it stand for\r\ntwo daies, that the Water may extract all the Salt that is in the Earth:\r\nThen they pass this Water into another Pit, in which it christallizes into\r\n_Saltpetre_, They let it boil once or twice in a Caldron, according as they\r\nwill have it whiter and purer. Whilest it is over the Fire, they scum it\r\ncontinually, and fill it out into great Earthen Pots, which {104} hold each\r\n25 or 30 pounds, and these they expose to clear Nights; and if there be any\r\nimpurity remaining, it will fall to the bottom: Afterwards they break the\r\nPots, and dry the Salt in the Sun. One might make vast quantities of\r\nSaltpetre in these parts; but the Country people feeling that _We_ buy of\r\nit, and that the _English_ begin to do the same, they now sell us a _Maon_\r\nof 6 pounds for two _Rupias_ and a half, which we had formerly for half\r\nthat price.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An account of _Hevelius_ his _Prodromus Cometicus_, together with some\r\nAnimadversions made upon it by a _French_ Philosopher._\r\n\r\nThis excellent _Dantiscan_ Astronomer, _Hevelius_, in his _Prodromus_ (by\r\nhim so call'd, because it is as a Harbinger to his _Cometography_, which\r\nhath already so far passed the Press, that of twelve Books there are but\r\nthree remaining to be Printed) gives an account of the Observations he hath\r\nmade of the _First_ of the two late Comets; reserving those he hath made of\r\nthe _second_, for that great Treatise, where he also intends to deliver the\r\nMatter of this _first_ more particularly, and more fully than he hath done\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn this Account he represents the Rise, Place, Course, Swiftness, Faces and\r\nTrain of this Comet, interweaving his Conceptions both about the Region of\r\nComets in general (whether in the _Air_, or the _Æther_?) and the Causes of\r\ntheir Generation: In the search of which latter, he intimates to have\r\nreceived much assistance from his _Telescope_.\r\n\r\nHe observes this Comet not before _Decemb._ 4/14, (though he conceives it\r\nmight have been seen since _Novemb._ 23 _st. n._) & he saw it no longer\r\nthen _Feb._ 3/13: though several others have seen it both sooner, and\r\nlater: and though himself continued to look out for it till _March_ 7. _st.\r\nn._ but fruitlesly, whereof he thinks the reason to have been its too great\r\ndistance and tenuity.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\nHe finds, its apparent Motion was not made in a _Just_ great Circle, but\r\ndeviated considerably from it; and conceives, that every Comet falls to\r\nthis deviation, when this apparent Motion grows slow, and the Star becomes\r\nStationary (which, as he saith, it doth in respect of the _Ecliptick_, not\r\nits own _Orbite_,) Here he observes, That from _Decemb._ 8/18, to _Decem._\r\n30. _Jan._ 9. its course was almost a great Circle: but that _then_ it\r\nbegan to deflect from that Circle towards the _North_; so that afterwards,\r\nwith a very notable and conspicuous Curvity, it directed its course towards\r\n_Primam Arietis_: Of which deflection, he ventures to assign the cause from\r\nthe Cometical Matter, the various position and the distance of the Comet\r\nfrom the Earth and the Sun, the annual Motion of the Earth, and the\r\nimpressed Motion, and the inclination of the _discus_ of the Cometical\r\nBody.\r\n\r\nHe is pretty positive, that without the _annual Motion_ of the _Earth_, no\r\nrational Account can be given of any Comet, but that all is involved with\r\nperplexities, and deform'd by absurdities.\r\n\r\nHe inquires, since all Comets have the peculiar _Ingenite_ Motion, what\r\nkind of Line it is, they describe by that Motion of their own? whether\r\ncircular, or streight, or curve, or partly streight and partly curve? And\r\nif curve, whether regular or irregular? if regular, whether Elliptick, or\r\nParabolar, or Hyperbolical? He answers, That this Motion is _Conical_; and\r\njudgeth, that by the _Conick_ path all the _Phænomena_ of Comets can,\r\nwithout any inconveniency, be ready solved; even of that, which (by\r\nHistory) in fifty daies, passed through more then the 12 Signs in the\r\n_Zodiack_: And of that, which in two daies ran through eight Signs: and of\r\nanother, which in 48 daies posted through all the Signs, _contra seriem_.\r\nWhich how it can be explicated upon the supposition of the Earths standing\r\nstill, and upon the denying of the annual Motion thereof, he understands\r\nnot at all. {106}\r\n\r\nHe refers to his _Cometography_ these Disquisitions: whether all Comets (in\r\ntheir innate Motion) move equal _spaces_ in equal _Times_? which is the\r\nswiftest, and which the slowest Motion they are capable of? what the cause\r\nof this acceleration and retardation of their true Motion?\r\n\r\nHe puts it out of doubt, that they are in the _Sky_ it self, producing\r\nreasons for it that are very considerable, and alledging amongst others,\r\nThat the _Parallaxes_ doe clearly evince it, which he finds far less in\r\nComets, then in the _Moon_, yea then sometimes in the _Sun_ it self. Where\r\nhe also represents, That he hath deduced the _Horizontal Parallax_ of this\r\nvery Comet from one onely Observation, made _Feb._ 4. _st. n._ by which he\r\nfound, That then it was distant from the Earth 5000 Semidiameters of the\r\nsame, or 4300000 _German_ miles. From this distance from the earth, he\r\ndeduces, That on that Day when it was so remote from the Earth, its true\r\n_Diameter_ was 2560 _German_ miles, which is three times bigger then the\r\nDiameter of the Earth, and almost six times bigger then that of the Moon,\r\nwhose Diameter, according to his _Theory_, is 442 _German_ miles.\r\n\r\nHe finds the _Matter_ of Comets to be in the _Æther_ it self, making the\r\n_Æther_ and the _Air_ to differ only in purity, and esteeming, That the\r\n_Planets_ do emit their Exhalations, and have their _Atmospheres_ like unto\r\nour Earth. Where he affirms, That the Sun alone may cast out so much Matter\r\nat any time in one year, as that thence shall be produced not one or two\r\nComets, equallizing the Moon in Diamiter, but very many; which if so, what\r\ncontribution may not be expected from the other Planets?\r\n\r\nOf this Cometical Matter, he thinks, That first it is by little and little\r\ngathered together, then coagulated and condensed, and thereby reduced to a\r\nless Diameter; but then, after a while it resolves again, and grows dilute\r\nand pale, and at last is dissipated. And accordingly he affirms, That he\r\nhath observed the Head of this Comet at first more confused, thin and pale,\r\nafterwards clearer and clearer. {107}\r\n\r\nHe conceives, That all Comets do respect the _Sun_ as their _King_ and\r\n_Centre_, as _Planets_ do, making them a kind of _Spurious Planets_, that\r\nemulate the _true_ ones in their Motion almost in all things.\r\n\r\nThe _Train_, he makes nothing else but the Beams of the Sun, falling on the\r\nhead of the Comet, and passing through the same, refracted and reflected.\r\nAnd amongst his _Observations_ and _Schemes_ of this Comet, there occurs\r\none, wherein the Tail is _curve_, so seen by him _Decemb._ 11/21. He\r\nassigns the causes why the Trains do so much vary, and shews also, on what\r\ndepends their length.\r\n\r\nWhether the _same_ Comet returns again, as the Spots in the Sun? and,\r\nwhether in the time of great _Conjunctions_ they are more easily generated?\r\nand whether they can be certainly foretold? with several other Inquiries,\r\nhe refers for to his _great Book_.\r\n\r\nAs to _Prognostications_, he somewhat complains, That men do more inquire\r\nwhat Comets _signifie_, then what they _are_, or how they are generated and\r\nmoved; professing himself to be of the mind of those that would have Comets\r\nrather _admired_ then _feared_; there appearing indeed no cogent reason,\r\nwhy the Author of Nature may not intend them rather as Monitors of his\r\n_Glory_ and _Greatness_, then of his _Anger_ or _Displeasure_; especially\r\nseeing that some very diligent Men (among whom is _Gemma Frisius_) take\r\nnotice of as great a number of _good_ as _bad_ Events, consequent to\r\nComets. _Seneca_ also relating, That that Comet which appeared in his time,\r\nwas so happy, that it did _Cometis detrahere infamiam_, it cleared the\r\ncredit of Comets, and made People have good thoughts of them.\r\n\r\nHaving given some Account of what may be look'd for in this _Prodromus_, it\r\nfollows, That some also should be rendred of the _Animadversions_ mention'd\r\nto have been made upon the same. This was done by that _Parisian_\r\nPhilosopher Monsieur _Auzout_, in a Letter of his to his Country-man\r\nMonsieur _Petit_; in which he strongly conceives, That this {108}\r\n_Prodromus_ contains some mistakes, of which he chiefly singles out one, as\r\nmost considerable, in _Hevelius_'s Observation of _Feb._ 8/18, and declares\r\nthereupon, That he, and several very intilligent Astronomers of _France_\r\nand _Italy_ concurring with him therein, (whereas M. _Hevelius_ to him\r\nseems to stand single, as to this particular) found by their Observations,\r\nThat this Comet could not, on that day of _February_, be there where M.\r\n_Hevelius_ placeth it, _viz._ In _Prima Arietis_; unless it be said, That\r\nit visited that Star of _Aries_ on the 18, and returned thence the 19^{th},\r\ninto its ordinary course; in which, according to his, and his several\r\nCorrespondents Observations the Comet on _Feb._ 17. was distant from that\r\n_first Star_ of _Aries_ at least 1 degree and 17 minutes; and on _February_\r\n19. (he having missed, as well as his other Friends, the Observation on\r\n_Febr._ 18) was advanced in its way 12 or 13 minutes, but yet distant from\r\nthe said Star _some minutes_ above a _whole degree_, and consequently far\r\nfrom having then passed it. After which time M. _Auzout_ affirms to have\r\nseen it as well as several others, for many daies, and that until _March_\r\n7/17, observing, That about _Feb._ 26. or 27, when the Comet was nearest to\r\nthe often-mentioned _first_ of _Aries_, it approached not nearer thereunto,\r\nthen the distance of 50. minutes.\r\n\r\nThis important Difference between two very Learned, and very deserving\r\nPersons, being come to the knowledge of some of the ablest _Philosophers_ &\r\n_Astronomers_ of _England_, hath been by them thought worthy their\r\nExamination: and they being at this very present employed in the discussion\r\nthereof, by comparing what hath been done and published by the Dissenters,\r\nand by confronting with them their own Domestick Observations, are very\r\nlikely to discern where the mistake lies; and having discern'd it, will\r\ncertainly be found hightly impartial and ingenuous in giving their sense of\r\nthe same. {109}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the _Mundus Subterraneus_ of _Athanasius Kircher_._\r\n\r\nThis long expected _Subterraneous World_, is now come to light, dedicated\r\n(at least the _Exemplar_, that hath been perused by the _Publisher_ of\r\nthese _Papers_, who hears, That other _Copies_ bear Dedication to other\r\n_Great Princes_) both to the present Pope, as being esteemed by the author\r\nto have a part of his _Apostolical Kingdom_ there; and to the _Roman\r\nEmperor_ now Regent, who indeed in his Kingdom of _Hungary_, and in several\r\nProvinces of _Germany_, hath very many and very considerable things, worthy\r\nto be observed, under _Ground_.\r\n\r\nTo give the Curious a taste of the _Contents_ of this _Volume_, and thereby\r\nto excite them to a farther search into the recesses of Nature, for the\r\ncomposure of a good _Natural History_; they may first take notice, That the\r\nAuthor, having given an account in the _Preface_, what encouragement he\r\nreceived, for writing this Book, from the opportunity of Travelling with\r\nthe _Cardinal_ of _Hassia_ into _Sicily_ (in which Voyage, he saith, He met\r\nwith, as it were, an _Epitome_ of what may be observable in the\r\nSubterraneous parts of the Earth; and in particular, with an Earth-quake of\r\n14 daies duration, very instructive to him concerning several great Secrets\r\nof Nature:) having I say, thus Prefaced, he divided his Work into 12\r\n_Books_, wherein he affirms not only to have explicated the Divine\r\nStructure of the under-ground World, and the wondrous distribution of the\r\nWork-houses of Nature, and her Majesty and Riches therein; but also to have\r\nopened the Causes of her Effects and Productions; whence, by the Marriage\r\nof Nature and Art, a happy Issue may follow for the use and benefit of\r\nHumane Life.\r\n\r\nIn the _First_ Book, he considers the nature of the Centre of the Earth,\r\nwhere he delivers several _Paradoxes_ touching the same, and Discourses of\r\nthe Motion of heavy Bodies, of Pendulems, of Projectils. {110}\r\n\r\nIn the _second_ he treats of the Fabrick of the _Terrestrial Globe_, of the\r\nInfluences it receives from the Coelestial Bodies, especially the _Sun_ and\r\n_Moon_, of both which _Luminaries_ he gives a _Scheme_; of the proportion\r\nof the Earth to the Sun and Moon; of the external conformation of the\r\nEarth, its Mountains, and their concatenations, decrease and increase,\r\ntogether with the strange transformation thereof.

Where are delivered the\r\nseveral Processes of the reputed _Adepti, Raymund Lulle, Azoth, Arnold de\r\nVillanova, Paracelsus, Sendivogius, &c._ but all exploded as fals and\r\ndeceitful. Thirdly, {113} of the decisions in Law concerning Chimical Gold,\r\ntrue or fals. Fourthly, what the celebrated _Philosophers Stone_ was among\r\nthe Ancients, and what they understood by the same?\r\n\r\nIn the _twelfth_: First, Of the _Seminal Principle_ of all things, its\r\norigine, nature and property; of the way how Nature proceeds in the\r\nGeneration of _Minerals, Vegetables, Animals_; of Spontaneous Generation;\r\nof _Zeophyts, Insects_ of all sorts, and particularly of the Worms bred in\r\nMen; together with the causes why Nature would produce such swarms of\r\ninfinite sorts of Insects.

The Relation, though\r\nshort, comprizing the main Particulats of what he had more fully told me in\r\nDiscourse, I shall give it you with little or no variation from his own\r\nwords. {118}\r\n\r\nA Maid, after eating a good Break-fast, about seven in the Morning, was let\r\nBlood about eleven the same day in her Foot; the first Blood was receiv'd\r\nin a Porringer, and within a little while it turn'd very white; the last\r\nBlood was received in a Sawcer, which turn'd white immediately, like the\r\nwhite of a Custard. Within five or six hours after, he (the Physitian)\r\nchanced to see both, and that in the Porringer was half Blood and half\r\nChyle, swimming upon it like a Serum as white as Milk, and that in the\r\nSawcer all Chyle without the least appearance of a drop of Blood; and when\r\nhe heated them distinctly over a gentle fire, they both harden'd: As the\r\nwhite of an Egge when 'tis heated, or just as the _Serum_ of Blood doth\r\nwith heating, but far more white.

And certainly it will be wondred at by those,\r\n{120} who shall see these Glasses, how they could be truly wrought to such\r\na Figure, with such a Cavity; & yet more, when they shall hear the Author\r\nundertake to excavate other such _Eye-Glasses_ to above two inches, and\r\n_Object-glasses_ of five inches _Diameter_. He hath likewise already begun\r\nhis _Object-glasses_ for the mentioned two _Ocular_ ones, of the same\r\nFigure of about two inches _Diameter_, which are to be left all open, yet\r\nwithout causing any colours. Of all which 'tis hoped, that shortly a fuller\r\nand more particular accompt will be given.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Monsieur _Auzout's_ Speculations of the Changes, likely to be discovered\r\nin the _Earth_ and _Moon_, by their respective Inhabitants._\r\n\r\nThis Inquisitive _Philosopher_ in a letter of his, lately written to his\r\ncorrespondent in _London_, takes occasion to discourse of his\r\nconsiderations concerning those Changes, mentioned in the _Title_, as\r\nfollowes;\r\n\r\nI have (saith he) sometimes thought upon the _Changes_, which 'tis likely,\r\nthe supposed Inhabitants of the _Moon_ might discover in our _Earth_, to\r\nsee, whither reciprocally I could observe any such in the _Moon_. For\r\nexample, methinks, that the _Earth_ would to the people of the _Moon_\r\nappear to have a different face in the several seasons of the year; and to\r\nhave another appearance in _Winter_, when there is almost nothing green in\r\na very great part of the _Earth_; when there are Countries all covered with\r\nsnow, others, all covered with water, others, all obscured with Clouds, and\r\nthat for many weeks together: _Another_ in _Spring_, when the Forrests and\r\nFields are green. _Another_ in _Summer_, when whole Fields are yellow &c.\r\nMe thinks, I say, that _these_ changes are considerable enough in the force\r\nof the reflexions of Light to be observed, since we see so many differences\r\nof Lights in the _Moon_. We have _Rivers_ considerable enough to be seen,\r\nand they enter far enough {121} into the Land, and have a bredth capable to\r\nbe observed. There are _Fluxes_ in certain places, that reach into large\r\nCountries, enough to make there some apparent change; & in some of our Seas\r\nthere float sometimes such bulky masses of Ice, that are far greater, than\r\nthe Objects, which we are assured, we can see in the _Moon_. Again, we cut\r\ndown whole Forrests, and drain Marishes, of an extent large enough to cause\r\na notable alteration: And men have made such works, as have produced\r\nChanges great enough to be perceived. In many places also are _Vulcans_,\r\nthat seem big enough to be distinguish't, especially in the shadow: And\r\nwhen Fire lights upon Forrests of great extent, or upon Towns, it can\r\nhardly be doubted, but these Luminous Objects would appear either in an\r\nEcclipse of the Earth, or when such parts of the Earth are not illuminated\r\nby the Sun. But yet, I know no man, who hath observed such things in the\r\n_Moon_; and one may be rationally assured that no _Vulcans_ are there, or\r\nthat none of them burn at this time. This it is (_so he goes on_) which all\r\nCurious men, that have good _Telescopes_, ought well to attend; and I doubt\r\nnot; but, if we had a very particular _Map_ of the _Moon_, as I had\r\ndesigned to make one with a _Topography_, as it were, of all the\r\nconsiderable places therein, that We or our Posterity would find some\r\nchanges in Her. And if the _Mapps_ of the _Moon_ of _Hevelius_, _Divini_,\r\nand _Riccioli_ are exact, I can say, that I have seen there some places\r\nconsiderable enough, where _they_ put _parts that are clear_, whereas _I_\r\nthere see _dark ones_. 'Tis true that if there be _Seas_ in the _Moon_, it\r\ncan hardly fall out otherwise, than it doth upon our _Earth_, where\r\n_Alluvium's_ are made in some places, and the Sea gains upon the Land in\r\nothers. _I say_, if those Spots we see in the _Moon_, are Seas, as most\r\nbelieve them to be; whereas I have many reasons, that make me doubt,\r\nwhether they be so; of which I shall speak elsewhere. And I have sometimes\r\nthought, whether it might not be, that all the Seas of the _Moon_, if there\r\nmust be Seas, were on the side of the other _Hemisphere_, and that for this\r\ncause it might be that the _Moon_ turns not upon its _Axis_, as our\r\n_Earth_, {122} wherein the Lands and Seas are, as it were, ballanced: That\r\nthence also may proceed the non-appearance of any Clouds raised there, or\r\nof any Vapors considerable enough to be seen, as there are raised upon this\r\nEarth; and that this absence of Vapors is perhaps the cause, that no\r\n_Crepuscle_ is there, as it seems there is none, my selfe at least not\r\nhaving hitherto been able to discerne any mark thereof: For, me thinks, it\r\nis not to be doubted, but that the reputed Citizens of the _Moon_ might see\r\nour _Crepuscle_, since we see, that the same is without comparison\r\nstronger, than the _Light_ afforded us by the _Moon_, even when she is\r\n_full_; for, a little after Sun-set, when we receive no more than the\r\n_first_ Light of the _Sun_, the sky is far clearer, than it is in the\r\nfairest night of the _full Moon_. Mean while, since we see in _the Moon_,\r\nwhen she is increasing or decreasing, the Light she receives from the\r\nEarth, we cannot doubt, but that the People of the _Moon_ should likewise\r\nsee in the _Earth_ that Light, wherewith the _Moon_ illuminates it, with\r\nperhaps the difference, there is betwixt their bigness. Much rather\r\ntherefore should they see the Light of the _Crepuscle_, being, as we have\r\nsaid, incomparably greater. In the mean time we see not any faint Light\r\nbeyond the _Section_ of the Light, which is every where almost equaly\r\nstrong, and we there distinguish nothing at all, not so much that cleerest\r\npart, which is called _Aristarchus_, or _Porphyrites_, as I have often\r\ntryed; although one may there see the Light, which the _Earth_ sends\r\nthither, which is sometimes so strong, that in the _Moon's_ decrease I have\r\noften _distinctly_ seen _all_ the parts of the _Moon_, that were _not\r\nenlightned_ by the _Sun_, together with the difference of the clear parts,\r\nand the Spots, so far as to be able to discern them all. The _Shaddows_\r\nalso of all the _Cavities_ of the _Moon_ seem to be stronger, than they\r\nwould be, if there were a _Second_ Light. For, although a far off, the\r\nshaddows of our Bodies, environed with Light, seem to Us almost dark; yet\r\nthey doe not so appear so much, as the Shaddows of the _Moon_ doe; and\r\nthose that are upon the _Edge_ of the _Section_, {123} should not appear in\r\nthe like manner. But, I will determine nothing of any of these things. When\r\nI shall hereafter have made more frequent Observations of the Moon with my\r\n_great Telescopes_, in convenient time, I shall then perhaps learn more of\r\nit, than I know at present, at least it will excite the _Curious_ to\r\nendeavor to make the like Observations; and it may be, others, that I have\r\nnot thought of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Instance of the _same Person_ to Mr. _Hook_, for communicating his\r\nContrivance of making, with a Glass of a Sphere of 20 or 40 foot\r\n_diameter_, a _Telescope_ drawing several hundred foot; and his offer of\r\nrecompensing that Secret with another, teaching To measure with a\r\n_Telescope_ the _Distances of Objects_ upon the Earth._\r\n\r\nIn _Numb._ 4. Of these _Papers_, pag. 67. Mr. _Hook_ had intimated, that he\r\nwould shortly discover a way of his, with a _Plane-convex_ Glasse of a\r\nSphære of 20. or 40. feet _Diameter_, without _Veines_, and truly wrought\r\nof that _Figure_, to make a _Telescope_, that with a single _Eye-glass_\r\nshould draw 300, 400, yea 1000 feet, _without_ at all _altering the\r\nConvexity_: Monsieur _Auzout_ returns this consideration, and offer upon\r\nit, which follows:\r\n\r\nTo perform (_saith he_) with a _lesser Object-glass_ the effect of a _great\r\nTelescope_, we must find out a way to make such an _Object-glass_ to\r\nreceive as many Rayes as one will, without their being sensibly distant\r\nfrom one another; to the end, that by applying to it a _stronger\r\nEye-glass_, there may be still Beams enough to see the Object, and to\r\nobliterate the small specks and imperfections of the _Eye-glass_. And if\r\nMr. _Hook_ hath this Invention, I esteem it one of the greatest, that can\r\nbe found in the matter of _Telescopes_. If he please to impart it to us, we\r\nshall be obliged to him; and {124} I wish, I had a secret in _Opticks_ to\r\nencourage him to that communication. If I did believe, that this would be\r\nesteemed one, To measure with a _great Telescope_ the _distance of Objects_\r\nupon the _Earth_; which I have found long since, and proposed to some by\r\nway of Paradox; _Locorum distantias ex unica statione, absque ullo\r\nInstrumento Mathematico, metiri_; I doe here promise to discover it to him,\r\nwith the necessary Tables, as soon as He shall have imparted his to me;\r\nwhich I will use, as he shall order me. For, although the _Practise_ doe\r\nnot altogether answer the _Theory_ of my Invention, because that the length\r\nof the _Telescopes_ admits of some Latitude; yet one comes near enough, and\r\nperhaps as Just, as by most of the wayes, ordinarily used with Instruments.\r\nThat, which I am proposing, I doubt not but M. _Hook_ will soon understand,\r\nand see the determination of all Cases possible. I shall only say, that if\r\nwe look upon the sole _Theory_, we make use of an ordinary _Telescope_,\r\nwhereof the _Eye-glass_ is to be _Convexe_: for, by putting the Glasses at\r\na little greater distance, than they are, proportionably to the distance\r\nfor which it is to serve, and by adding to it a _new Eye-glass_, the Object\r\nwill be seen distinct, though obscure; and if the _Eye-glass_ be _Convexe_,\r\nthe Object will appear erect. They may be done two manner of ways; either\r\nby leaving the _Telescope_ in its ordinary situation, the _Object-glass_\r\nbefore the _Eye-glass_; or by inverting it, and putting _this_ before\r\n_that_. But if any will make use of two _Object-glasses_, whereof the\r\n_Focus's_ are known, the distance of them will be known. If it be supposed,\r\nthat the _Focus_ of the _first_ be B. and _that_ of the _second_ C, and the\r\ndistance given, B + 2D, and that D _minus_ C, be _equal_ to F; for, this\r\ndistance will be _equal_ to B + C + F - rF² - C². And if you have the\r\n_Focus_ of the _first Object-glass_, equal to B, the distance, where you\r\nwill put the _second_ Glass equal to B + C + D, the _focus_ of the 2d\r\nGlasse will be found equal to CD/{C+D}. And if you will that the Object\r\nshall be magnified as much with these two Glasses, as it would be with a\r\nsingle one, whereof the _Focus_ {125} should be of the distance given,\r\nhaving the _Focus_ of the _Object-glass_ given equal to B, and the distance\r\nto B + D; the distance between the first and the second Glass will be equal\r\nto {2B² + 2BD}/{2B + D}, whence subducting B (the _Focus_ of the\r\n_Object-glass_ given) there remains BD/{2B + D}; and if this sum be\r\nsupposed equal to C, we shall easily know, by the preceding Rule, the\r\n_Focus_ of the _second_ Glass.\r\n\r\nSo far M. _Auzout_, who, I trust, will receive due satisfaction to his\r\ndesire, as soon as the happy end of the present Contagion shall give a\r\nbeginning and life again to the Studies and Actions of our retired\r\n_Philosophers_.\r\n\r\nI shall onely here adde, That the Secret he mentions [_Of measuring the\r\ndistance of Places by a Telescope (fitted for that purpose) and from one\r\nStation_] is a thing already known (if I am not mis-informed) to some\r\nMembers of our Society; who have been a good while since considering of it,\r\nand have contrived ways for the doing of it: Whether the same with those of\r\nMr. _Auzout_, I know not. Nor have I (at the distance that I am now from\r\nthem) opportunity of particular Information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Experiment of a way of preparing a Liquor, that shall sink into, and\r\ncolour the whole Body of _Marble_, causing a _Picture_, drawn on a surface,\r\nto appear also in the _inmost_ parts of the Stone._\r\n\r\nThis _Experiment_, having been hinted at in the next foregoing _Papers_,\r\nout of the _Mundus Subterraneus_ of _Athanasius Kircher_, and several\r\nCurious Persons, who either have not the leisure to read Voluminous\r\nAuthors, or are not readily skilled in that Learned Tongue wherein the said\r\nBook is written, being very desirous to have it transferred hither, it was\r\nthought fit to comply with their desire herein.\r\n\r\nThe Author therefore of the _Mundus_, &c, having seen {126} some stones\r\nreputed to be _natural_ that had most lively Pictures, not only upon them,\r\nbut passing _thorow_ their whole substance, and thereupon finding an\r\n_Artist_; skilful to perform such rare workmanship, did not only pronounce\r\nsuch stones to be _artificial_, but when that _Artist_ was unwilling to\r\ncommunicate unto him his Secret, did joyn his study and endeavors with\r\nthose of one _Albertus Gunter_ a _Saxon_, to find it out themselves:\r\nwherein having succeeded, it seems, they made the Experiments which this\r\nIndustrious and communicative _Jesuit_ delivers in this manner:\r\n\r\nThe Colours, saith he, are thus prepared; I take of _Aqua fortis_ and _Aqua\r\nRegis_, two ounces _ana_; of _Sal Armoniack_ one ounce; of the best _Spirit\r\nof Wine_, two drachms; as much _Gold_ as can be had for nine _Julio_'s (a\r\n_Julio_ being about six pence English) of pure _Silver_, two drachmes.\r\nThese things being provided, let the Silver, when calcined, be put into a\r\nVial; and having powred upon it the two drachmes of _Aqua fortis_, let it\r\nevaporate, and you shall have a Water yielding first a _blew_ Colour, and\r\nafterwards a _black_. Likewise put the Gold, when calcin'd, into a Vial,\r\nand having powred the _Aqua Regis_ upon it, set it by to evaporate: then\r\nput the _Spirit of Wine_ upon the _Sal Armoniack_, leaving it also till it\r\nbe evaporated; and you will have a Golden coloured Water, which will afford\r\nyou divers Colours. And, after this manner, you may extract many\r\n_Tinctures_ of Colours out of other Mettals. This done, you may, by the\r\nmeans of these two Waters, paint what Picture you please upon white Marble,\r\nof the _softer_ kind, renewing the Figure every day for several days with\r\nsome fresh superadded Liquor, and you shall find in time, that the Picture\r\nhath penetrated the _whole_ solidity of the Stone, so that cutting it into\r\nas many parts as you will, it will always represent unto you the same\r\nFigure on both sides.\r\n\r\n_So far he_, which how far it answers expectation, is referred to the Tryal\r\nof Ingenious Artists. In the mean time there are not wanting Experienced\r\nMen that scruple the Effect, but {127} yet are far from pronouncing any\r\nthing positively against it, so that they doe not discourage any that have\r\nconveniencies, from trying.\r\n\r\nBut whether the way there mentioned will succeed, or not, according to\r\nexpectation: Sure it is that a Stone-cutter in _Oxford_, Mr. _Bird_, hath\r\nmany years since found out a way of doing the same thing, in effect, that\r\nis here mentioned; and hath practised it for many years. That is, he is\r\nable so to apply a colour to the outside of polished Marble, as that it\r\nshall sink a considerable depth into the body of the stone; and there\r\nrepresent like figures or images as those are on the outside; (deeper or\r\nshallower according as he continues the application, a longer, or lesser\r\nwhile.) Of which kind there be divers pieces to be seen in _Oxford_,\r\n_London_, and elsewhere. And some of them being shewed to his Majesty, soon\r\nafter his happy restauration, they were broken in his presence, and found\r\nto answer expectation. And others may be dayly seen, by any who is curious,\r\nor desirous to see it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Intimation of a Way, found in _Europe_ to make _China-dishes_._\r\n\r\nNotice was lately given by an inquisitive _Parisian_ to a friend of his in\r\n_London_, that by an Acquaintance he had been informed, that Signor\r\n_Septalio_, a Canon in _Millan_, had the Secret of making as good\r\n_Porcelane_ as is made in _China_ it self, and transparent; adding that he\r\nhad seen him make some.\r\n\r\nThis as it deserves, so it will be further inquired after, if God permit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of an odd _Spring_ in _Westphalia_, together with an\r\nInformation touching _Salt-Springs_ and the straining of salt-water._\r\n\r\nAn observing Gentleman did lately write out of _Germany_, that in\r\n_Westphalia_ in the Diocess of _Paderborn_, is a Spring, which looses it\r\nself twice in 24 houres; coming always, after 6 houres, back again with a\r\ngreat noise, and so forcibly, as {128} to drive 3 Mills not far from its\r\nsource. The Inhabitants call it the _Bolderborn_, as if you should say, the\r\n_Boysterous Spring_.\r\n\r\n_The same Person_, having mentioned the many _Salt-Springs_ in _Germany_,\r\nas those at _Lunenburg_, at _Hall_ in _Saxony_, at _Saltzwedel_ in\r\n_Brandenburger Mark_, in _Tyrol_, &c. observes, that no Salt-water, which\r\ncontains any Metal with it, can well be sodden to Salt in a Vessel of the\r\nsame Metal, which it self contains, except _Vitriol_ in Copper Vessels.\r\n\r\n_He adds_, that, to separate Salt from Salt-water, without Fire, if you\r\ntake a Vessel of Wax, hollow within, and every where tight; and plunge it\r\ninto the Sea, or into other Salt-water, there will be made such a\r\nseparation, that the vessel shall be full of sweet water, the Salt staying\r\nbehind: but, though this water have no saltish taste, yet, _he saith_,\r\nthere will be found a Salt in the Essay, which is the Spirit of Salt,\r\nsubtile enough with the water to penetrate the Wax.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Rise and Attempts, of a Way to conveigh Liquors\r\nimmediately into the Mass of Blood._\r\n\r\nWhereas there have lately appeared in publick some _Books_, printed beyond\r\nthe Seas, treating of the Way of _Injecting liquors into Veines_; in which\r\nBooks the _Original_ of the _Invention_ seems to be adscribed to others,\r\nbesides him, to whom it really belongs; It will surely not be thought\r\namiss, if something be said, whereby the true _Inventor's_ right may beyond\r\nexception be asserted & preserved; To which end, there will need no more,\r\nthan barely to represent the _Time_ when, and the _Place_ where, & among\r\nwhom it was first started and put to tryal. To joyn all these circumstances\r\ntogether, 'Tis notorious, that at least six years since (a good while\r\nbefore it was heard off, that any one did pretend to have so much as\r\nthought of it) the Learned and Ingenious Dr. _Christopher Wren_ did propose\r\nin the _University_ of _Oxford_ (where he now is the Worthy Savilian\r\nProfessor of _Astronomy_, and where very many Curious Persons are ready to\r\n{129} attest this relation) to that Noble Benefactor to Experimental\r\nPhilosophy, Mr. _Robert Boyle_, Dr. _Wilkins_, and other deserving Persons,\r\nThat he thought, he could easily contrive a Way to conveigh any liquid\r\nthing immediately into the Mass of Blood; _videl_: By making Ligatures on\r\nthe Veines, and then opening them on the side of the Ligature towards the\r\nHeart, and by putting into them slender Syringes or Quills, fastened to\r\nBladders (in the manner of Clyster-pipes) containing the matter to be\r\ninjected; performing that Operation upon pretty big and lean doggs, that\r\nthe Vessels might be large enough and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThis Proposition being made, M. _Boyle_ soon gave order for an _Apparatus_,\r\nto put it to Experiment; wherein at several times, upon several Doggs,\r\n_Opium_ & the Infusion of _Crocus Metallorum_ were injected into that part\r\nof the hind-legs of those Animals, whence the larger Vessels, that carry\r\nthe Blood, are most easy to be taken hold of: whereof the success was, that\r\nthe _Opium_, being soon circulated into the Brain, did within a short time\r\nstupify, though not kill the Dog; but a large Dose of the _Crocus\r\nMetallorum_, made another Dog vomit up Life and all: All which is more\r\namply and circumstantially delivered by Mr. _Boyle_ in his Excellent Book\r\nof the _Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy_, Part 2. Essay 2. pag. 53.\r\n54. 55. Where 'tis also mention'd, that the fame of this Invention and of\r\nthe succeeding Tryals being spread, and particularly coming to the\r\nknowledge of a foreign _Ambassadour_, that was Curious, and then resided in\r\n_London_, it was by him tryed with some _Crocus Metallorum_, upon a\r\nMalefactor, that was an inferiour Servant of his; with this success, that\r\nthe Fellow, as soon as ever the Injection began to be made, did, either\r\nreally or craftily, fall into a swoon; whereby, being unwilling to\r\nprosecute so hazardous an Experiment, they desisted, without seeing any\r\nother effect of it, save that it was told the Ambassadour, that it wrought\r\nonce downwards with him: Since which time, it hath been frequently\r\npractised both in _Oxford_ & _London_; as well before the _Royal Society_,\r\nas elsewhere. And particularly that Learned {130} Physitian, Dr. _Timothy\r\nClerk_, hath made it part of his business, to pursue those Experiments with\r\nmuch industry, great accurateness, and considerable observations thereon;\r\nwhich above two years since, were by him produced and read before the\r\n_Royal Society_, who thereupon desired him, as one of their Members, to\r\ncompleat, what he had proposed to himself upon that subject, and then to\r\npublish the same: the Effect whereof 'tis hoped, will now shortly appear,\r\nand not prove unwelcome to the Curious.\r\n\r\nSome whereof, though they may conceive, that liquors thus injected into\r\nVeines without preparation and digestion, will make odde, commotions in the\r\nBlood, disturb Nature, and cause strange Symptoms in the Body, yet they\r\nhave other thoughts on Liquors, that are prepared of such things, as have\r\npassed the Digestion of the Stomach; for example, of Spirit of Urine, of\r\nHarts-horne, of Blood &c. And they hope likewise, that besides the\r\n_Medical_ Uses, that may be made of this _Invention_, it may also serve for\r\n_Anatomical_ purposes, by filling, after this way, the vessels of an Animal\r\nas full, as they can hold, and by exceedingly distending them, discover\r\n_New_ Vessels, &c: But not now to enlarge upon the Uses, the Reader may\r\nsecurely take this Narrative, as the naked real Matter of Fact, whereby\r\n'tis as clear, as Noon day (both from the Time, and irrefragable Testimony\r\nof very many considerable Persons in that University, who can jointly\r\nattest it; as well as from that particular unquestionable one of Mr.\r\n_Boyle_ and his worthy Company, who were the first Eye-witnesses of the\r\nTryals made,) that to _Oxford_, and in it, to Dr. _Christopher Wren_, this\r\nInvention is due; and consequently, that all others, who discourse or write\r\nof it, doe either derive it from Him, or are fallen upon the same Devise\r\nseveral years after Him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Published with License._\r\n\r\nOxford, Printed by _A: & L: Lichfield_, for _Ric: Davis_. 1665.\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 8.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMunday, _Januar._ 8. 1665/6.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _An Account of the Tryals, made in _Italy_ of _Campani's_ new Optick\r\n    Glasses.

Of some Philosophical and Curious Books, that are shortly to\r\n    come abroad._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Tryalls, made in _Italy_ of _Campani's_ new _Optick\r\nGlasses_._\r\n\r\nAn Inquisitive _Parisian_ writes to his Correspondent in _London_, as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\nWe received lately news from _Rome_, from a very Curious Person of our\r\nacquaintance, importing, that _Campani_ hath had the advantage of _Divini_.\r\nThe Great Duke of _Toskany_, and Prince _Leopold_, his Brother, upon Tryal,\r\nmade of both their Glasses, have found those of _Campani_ excel the other,\r\nand with them they have been able, easily to distinguish people {132} at 4\r\nLeagues distance: Of which I intend you more particulars hereafter.\r\n\r\nAmong them are expected the _Length_ of these _Telescopes_, and the\r\nLargeness of the _Aperture_ of their _Object-glasses_. In the mean time,\r\nthe _Parabolical-glasses_, formerly mentioned to be in hand here at\r\n_London_, are finishing with all possible care and industry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Further Relation of the _Whale-fishing_ about the _Bermudas_, and on the\r\nCoast of _New-England_ and _New-Netherland_._\r\n\r\nThe same Person, that communicated the particulars about the new\r\nWhale-fishing near the _Bermudas_, mentioned in the first of these\r\n_Tracts_, gives this further Information; That there have been since taken\r\nby order of the _Bermudas_ Company, sixteen of those Whales, the Oyle\r\nwhereof, to the quantity of 50 or 60 Tuns arrived in _Ireland_ at\r\n_Limrick_, some few months agoe.\r\n\r\nHe adds, that about two years since, there stranded upon the Coast of\r\n_New-England_ a dead Whale, of that sort, which they call _Trumpo_, having\r\nTeeth resembling those of a Mill, and its mouth at a good distance from,\r\nand under the Nose or Trunk, and several boxes or partitions in the Nose,\r\nlike those of the Tailes in Lobsters; and that that being open'd there run\r\nout of it a thin oily substance, which would candy in time; after which,\r\nthe remainder, being a thick fatty substance, was taken out of the same\r\npart, with a scoope. And this substance he affirmed to be the _Sperma\r\nCeti_; adding further, that the _Blubber_, as they call it, it self, of the\r\nsame sort of Whales, when stewed, yields on the top a creamy substance,\r\nwhich taken off, and thrown upon white wine, lets fall a dirty\r\nheterogeneous sediment, but what remains aloft, affords a\r\n_Sperma-Ceti_-like matter. {133}\r\n\r\nHe concluded his relation with observing, that these whales were to be met\r\nwith, between the Coast of _New-England_, and _New-Netherland_, where they\r\nmight be caught eight or nine months in the year, whereas those about the\r\n_Bermudas_ are to be found there only in the Months of _February_, _March_\r\nand _April_.\r\n\r\nConcerning the death of the Whale, which hath been related to have stranded\r\nupon _New-England_, it is not very improbable, but, (that Fish having also\r\nmore than one Enemy, whereof a small Fish called the _Thresher_ is one,\r\nwho, by Mr. _Terry's_ Relation in his _East-Indian_ Voyage, with his\r\nnimbleness vexes him as much, as a Bee does a great Beast on the land; and\r\na certain horny Fish another, who runs its horn into the Whal's belly) it\r\nmay have been kill'd by the latter of these two; which kind of Fish is\r\nknown, sometimes to run its horn into Ships (perhaps taking them for\r\nWhales) and there snapping it asunder; as hapned not long since to an\r\nEnglish Vessel in the _West-Indian_ Seas; the broken piece of that Horn\r\nbeing by the Master of that ship presented to the King, and now kept in His\r\nMajesties Repository: the like whereof befel a _French_ Vessel, sailing\r\ntowards the _East-Indies_, according to the Relation, made by Monsieur\r\n_Thevenot_ in his second _Tome_ of _Curious Voyages_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a remarkable Spring, about _Paderborn_ in _Germany_._\r\n\r\nAn inquiring Gentleman of those parts writes to his Friend in _London_, as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\nIn this Diocess of _Paderborn_, about 2 leagues from that Town, is a treble\r\nSpring call'd _Metborn_, which has three streams, two wherof are not above\r\none foot and a half distant from one another, and yet of so differing\r\nqualities, that whereas one of them is limpid, blewish, lukewarm, bubling,\r\nand holding Sal-armoniack, Ochra, Iron, Vitriol, {134} Allum, Sulphur,\r\nNiter, Orpiment, used against Epilepsie, bad Spleens, and the Wormes; the\r\nother is Ice-cold, turbid and whitish, much stronger in tast, and heavier\r\nthan the former, holding much Orpiment, Salt, Iron, Niter, and some\r\nSal-Armoniack, Allum and Vitriol; Of this all Birds, observed to drink of\r\nit, doe dye; which I have also privately experimented by taking some of it\r\nhome, and giving it to Hens, after I had given them Oates, Barly and\r\nBread-crums; For, soon after they had drunk of it, they became giddy,\r\nreeled, and tumbled upon their backs, with convulsion-fitts, and so dyed\r\nwith a great extention of their leggs. Giving them common-salt immediatly\r\nafter they had drunk; they dyed not so soon; giving them vineger, they dyed\r\nnot at all, but seven or eight days after were troubled with the _Pipp_.\r\nThose that dyed, being open'd, their Lungs were found quite shrivelled\r\ntogether. Yet some men, that are troubled with Worms, taking a litle\r\nquantity of it, and diluting it in common water, have been observed by this\r\nmeans to kill the Worms in their bellies, so that a great number of worms\r\ncome from them; whereupon though they are sick, yet they dye not. As to the\r\nthird stream, that lyes lower than the other two, about 20 paces distant\r\nfrom them, it is of a greenish colour, very clear, and of a sowre sweet\r\ntast, pleasing enough. It hath about a middle weight between the other two;\r\nwhence wee guess, that it is mixed of them both, meeting there together: to\r\nconfirm which, we have mixed equal quantities, of those two, with an\r\naddition of a litle common well-water, and have found that they, being\r\nstirred together and permitted to setle, made just a water of the same\r\ncolour and tast of this third stream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of some other not-common Springs at _Basel_ and in _Alsatia_._\r\n\r\nA Curious Person writes from those Places in manner following; {135}\r\n\r\nAt _Basel_ the Spring, running in the _Gerbergasse_ (or _Tanners-street_)\r\nfrom St. _Leonard's_ Hill, is of a Blewish colour, and somewhat troubled,\r\nholding Copper, Bitumen, and Antimony, about 3 parts of the first, one of\r\nthe second, and two of the last, as has been examined by skilful Persons.\r\nOur Tanners do water their Skins in it; and being a well-tasted and\r\nwholesome Water, it is both much drunk, and used to Bath in. It mingles\r\nwith another Spring water, call'd the _Birsick_, and with it, between the\r\n_Salt-tower_ and the _Rhine-gate_ runs into the _Rhine_.\r\n\r\nIn the same Town (which abounds with Spring-waters) there are two, among\r\nthe rest, called _Bandulph's-well_, and _Brun Zum Brunnen_, that are more\r\nobservable then the other; the former of them having a _Camphory_ and\r\ndrying Quality, and used against Hydropical Distempers; the latter\r\ncontaining some Sulphur, Saltpeter and Gold, and being an excellent Water\r\nto drink, much used in the principal Tavern of the City, where the chief of\r\nthe Town do resort, and near which it runs.\r\n\r\nIn _Alsatia_ in the Valley, called _Leberthal_, near _Geesbach_ (an ancient\r\nMine-work) there runs out of a _Cavern_ a foul, fattish, oily Liquor,\r\nwhich, though the Country-men of that place employ to the vile use of\r\ngreasing their Wheels, instead of ordinary Wheel-grease; yet doth it afford\r\nan excellent Balsom, by taking a quantity of it, and putting it in an\r\nEarthen Pot well luted, that no steam may exhale; and then with a gentle\r\nFire at first, but a stronger afterwards, boyling it for three hours\r\ntogether; in which space it will boyl in a fourth part, and an Earthen\r\nMatter, like Pitch, will settle it self at the bottom: but on the top\r\nthereof, when cold, there will swim a fatty Substance, like Lyne-Oyl,\r\nlimped and somewhat yellowish, which is to be decanted from the thick\r\nSediment, and then gently distilled in an Alembick in _Arena_, by which\r\nmeans, there will come over two differing Liquors, one Phlegmatick, the\r\nother Oily, {136} which latter swimming on the Phlegm, is to be severed\r\nfrom it. The Phlegm is used as an excellent Resister and Curer of all the\r\nPutrefactions of the Lungs and Liver, and it heals all foul Wounds and\r\nUlcers. The Oily part, being diluted with double its quantity of distilled\r\nVineger, and brought three times over the Helm, yields a rare Balsom,\r\nagainst all inward and outward Corruptions, stinking Ulcers, hereditary\r\nScurfs and Scabs: 'Tis also much used against Apoplexies, Palsies,\r\nConsumptions, Giddinesses, and Head-aches. Inwardly they take it with\r\nSuccory-water against all corruptions of the Lungs. It is a kind of\r\n_Petroleum_, and contains no other Mineral Juice, but that of _Sulphur_,\r\nwhich seems to be thus distilled by _Nature_ under ground; the distillation\r\nof an Oyl out of _Sulphur_ by Art, being not so easie to perform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the richest _Salt-Springs_ in _Germany_._\r\n\r\nAn Account having been desired of those two chief _Salt-Springs_ in\r\n_Germany_, at _Hall_ and _Lunenburg_, it was lately transmitted thus:\r\n\r\nThe _Salt-Springs_ at _Hall_ in _Saxony_ are four, called _Gutiaar_, the\r\n_Dutch-Spring_, the _Mettritz_, and the _Hackel-dorn_; whereof the three\r\nfirst hold near the same proportion of Salt; the last hold less, but yields\r\nthe purest Salt. The three first hold about seven parts of Salt, three of\r\nMarcasit, and fourteen of water: They are, besides their Oeconomical use,\r\nemployed Medicinally to Bath in, and to draw a Spirit out of it, exhibited\r\nwith good success against Venom, and the putrefaction of the Lungs, Liver,\r\nReins, and the Spleen.\r\n\r\nThe _Salt Water_ at _Lunenburgh_, being more greenish then white, and not\r\nvery transparent, is about the same nature and hold with that of _Hall_. It\r\nhath a mixture of Lead with it, whence also it will not be sod in Leaden\r\nPans, and if it held no Lead at all, it would not be so good, that Metal\r\nbeing judged to _purifie_ the Water: whence also the Salt of {137}\r\n_Lunenburg_ is preferred before all others, that are made of Salt Springs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations of swarms of strange Insects, and the Mischiefs done by\r\nthem._\r\n\r\nA great Observer, who hath lived long in _New England_, did upon occasion,\r\nrelate to a Friend of his in _London_, where he lately was, That some few\r\nYears since there was such a swarm of a certain sort of Insects in that\r\n_English_ Colony, that for the space of of 200 Miles they poyson'd and\r\ndestroyed all the Trees of that Country; there being found innumerable\r\nlittle holes in the ground, out of which those Insects broke forth in the\r\nform of _Maggots_, which turned into _Flyes_ that had a kind of taile or\r\nsting, which they struck into the Tree, and thereby envenomed and killed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe like Plague is said to happen frequently in the Country of the\r\n_Cosacks_ or _Ukrani_, where in dry Summers they are infested with such\r\nswarms of _Locusts_, driven thither by an _East_, or _South-East_ Wind,\r\nthat they darken the Air in the fairest weather, and devour all the Corn of\r\nthat Country; laying their Eggs in _Autumn_, and then dying; but the Eggs,\r\nof which every one layeth two or three hundred, hatching the next Spring,\r\nproduce again such a number of Locusts, that then they do far more mischief\r\nthan afore, unless Rains do fall, which kill both Eggs and the Insects\r\nthemselves, or unless a strong _North_ or _North-West_ Wind arise, which\r\ndrives them into the _Euxin_ Sea: The Hogs of that Country loving these\r\nEggs, devour also great quantities of them, and thereby help to purge the\r\nLand of them; which is often so molested by this Vermine, that they enter\r\ninto their Houses and Beds, fall upon their Tables and into their Meat,\r\ninsomuch that they can hardly eat without taking down some of them; in the\r\nNight when they repose themselves upon the ground, they cover it three, or\r\nfour Inches thick, and if a Wheel pass {138} over them, they emit a stench\r\nhardly to be endured: All which, and much more may be fully seen in the\r\n_French_ Description of the Countries of _Poland_, made by _Monsieur de\r\nBeauplan_, and by _Monsieur Thevenot_, in his Relation of the _Cosacks_,\r\ncontained in the First part of his _Curious Voyages_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Observation touching the Bodies of Snakes and Vipers._\r\n\r\nSeveral have taken notice, that there is a difference between the brooding\r\nof Snakes and Vipers, those laying their Eggs in Dung-hills, by whose\r\nwarmth they are hatched; but these (Vipers) brooding their Eggs within\r\ntheir Bellies, and bringing forth live Vipers. To which may be added, That\r\nsome affirm to have seen Snakes lye upon their Eggs, as Hens sit upon\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations of odde Constitutions of Bodies._\r\n\r\nA very curious Person, studying Physick at _Leyden_, to whom had been\r\nimparted those Relations about a Milky Substance in Veins, heretofore\r\nalledged in _Numb._ 6. returns, by way of gratitude, the following\r\nObservations.\r\n\r\nThere was (saith he) not many Years since, in this Country a Student, who\r\nbeing much addicted to the study of _Astronomy_, and spending very many\r\nNights in Star-gazing, had, by the Nocturnal wet and cold temper of the\r\nAir, in such a manner obstructed the pores of his skin, that little or\r\nnothing exhaled from his Body; which appeared hence, because that the\r\nshirt, he had worn five or six weeks, was then as white as if he had worn\r\nit but one day. In the mean while he gathered a subcutaneous Water, of\r\nwhich yet he was afterwards well cured.\r\n\r\nWe have also (_saith the same_) seen here a young Maid, of about thirteen\r\nYears of age, which from the time that she was but six Years old, and began\r\nto be about her Mother in {139} the Kitchin, would, as often as she was bid\r\nto bring her Salt, or could else come at it, fill her Pockets therewith,\r\nand eat it, as other children doe Sugar: whence she was so dried up, and\r\ngrown so stiff, that she could not stirre her limbs, and was thereby\r\nstarved to death.\r\n\r\nThat Learned and Observing Doctor _John Beal_, upon the perusal of the\r\nforementioned _Numb._ 6. was pleased to communicate this Note:\r\n\r\nTo your Observation, of Milk in Veines, I can add a _Phænomenon_ of some\r\nresemblance to it, which I received above 20 years agoe from _Thomas Day_,\r\nan Apothecary in _Cambridg_; _vid._ That himself let a man bloud in the\r\narme, by order of Doctor _Eade_, a Physitian there. The mans bloud was\r\nwhite as Milk, as it run out of his arme, it had a little dilute redness,\r\nbut immediately, as it fell into the Vessel, it was presently white; and it\r\ncontinued like drops of Milk on the pavement, where ever it fell. The\r\nconjecture which the said Physitian had of the cause of this appearance,\r\nwas, that the Patient had much fed on Fish; affirming withall, that he had\r\nsoon been a Leper, if not prevented by Physick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A way of preserving Ice and Snow by Chaffe._\r\n\r\nThe Ingenious Mr. _William Ball_ did communicate the relation hereof, as he\r\nhad received it from his Brother, now residing at _Livorne_, as follows;\r\n\r\nThe Snow, or Ice-houses are here commonly built on the side of a steep\r\nhill, being only a deep hole in the ground, by which meanes, they easily\r\nmake a passage out from the bottom of it, to carry away all the water,\r\nwhich, if it should remain stagnating therein, would melt the Ice and Snow:\r\nbut they thatch it with straw, in the shape of a Saucepan-cover, that the\r\nrain may not come at it. The sides (supposing it dry) they line not with\r\nany thing, as is done in St. _Jeames_'s Park, by reason of the moistness of\r\nthe ground. This Pit they fill {140} full of Snow or Ice (taking care that\r\nthe Ice be made of the purest water, because they put it into their wine)\r\nover-spreading first the bottom very well with _Chaffe_; by which I mean\r\nnot any part of the straw, but what remains upon the winnowing of the Corn;\r\nand I think, they here use Barley-chaffe. This done, they further, as they\r\nput in the Ice, or the Snow, (which latter they ram down,) line it thick by\r\nthe sides with such Chaffe, and afterwards cover it well with the same; and\r\nin half a years lying so, 'tis found not to want above an eight part of\r\nwhat it weighed, when first put in. When ever they take it out into the\r\nAire, they wrap it in this Chaffe, and it keeps to admiration. The use of\r\nit in _England_ would not be so much for cooling of drinks, as 'tis here\r\ngenerally used; but for cooling of fruits, sweetmeats &c. _So far this\r\nAuthor._\r\n\r\nThe other usual way both in _Italy_ and other Countries, to conserve Snow\r\nand Ice with _Straw_ or _Reed_, is set down so punctually by Mr. _Boyle_ in\r\nhis _Experimental History of Cold_, pag. 408. 409. that nothing is to be\r\nadded. It seems _Pliny_ could not pass by these _Conservatories_, and the\r\ncooling of drinks with Ice, without passing this severe, though elegant and\r\nwitty, Animadversion upon them: _Hi Nives, illi glaciem potant, poenásque\r\nmontium in voluptatem gulæ vertunt: Servatur algor æstibus, excogitatúrque\r\nut alienis mensibus nix algeat_, lib. 19. cap. 4. But the _Epigrammatist_\r\nsports with it thus;\r\n\r\n  _Non potare nivem, sed aquam potare rigentem_\r\n  _De nive, commenta est ingeniosa sitis._ Martial. 14. _Ep._ 117.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Directions for Sea-men, bound for far Voyages._\r\n\r\nIt being the Design of the _R. Society_, for the better attaining the End\r\nof their Institution, to study _Nature_ rather than _Books_, and from the\r\nObservations, made of the _Phænomena_ and Effects she presents, to compose\r\nsuch a {141} History of Her, as may hereafter serve to build a Solid and\r\nUseful Philosophy upon; They have from time to time given order to several\r\nof their Members to draw up both _Inquiries_ of things Observable in\r\nforrain Countries, and _Directions_ for the Particulars, they desire\r\nchiefly to be informed about. And considering with themselves, how much\r\nthey may increase their _Philosophical_ stock by the advantage, which\r\n_England_ injoyes of making Voyages into all parts of the World, they\r\nformerly appointed that Eminent Mathematician and Philosopher Master\r\n_Rooke_, one of their Fellowes, and _Geometry_ Professor of _Gresham\r\nColledge_ (now deceased to the great detriment of the Common-wealth of\r\nLearning) to think upon and set down some _Directions_ for _Sea-men_ going\r\ninto the _East_ & _West-Indies_, the better to capacitate them for making\r\nsuch observations abroad, as may be pertinent and suitable for their\r\npurpose; of which the said Sea-men should be desired to keep an exact\r\n_Diary_, delivering at their return a fair Copy thereof to the _Lord High\r\nAdmiral_ of _England_, his Royal Highness the _Duke_ of _York_, and another\r\nto _Trinity-house_ to be perused by the _R. Society_. Which _Catalogue_ of\r\n_Directions_ having been drawn up accordingly by the said Mr. _Rook_, and\r\nby him presented to those, who appointed him to expedite such an one, it\r\nwas thought not to be unseasonable at this time to make it publique, the\r\nmore conveniently to furnish Navigators with Copies thereof. They are such,\r\nas follow;\r\n\r\n1. To observe the Declination of the _Compass_, or its Variation from the\r\n_Meridian_ of the place, frequently; marking withal, the _Latitude_ and\r\n_Longitude_ of the place, wherever such Observation is made, as exactly as\r\nmay be, and setting down the _Method_, by which they made them.\r\n\r\n2. To carry _Dipping Needles_ with them, and observe the Inclination of the\r\nNeedle in like manner.\r\n\r\n3. To remark carefully the Ebbings and Flowings of the Sea, in as many\r\nplaces as they can, together with all the Accidents, {142} Ordinary and\r\nExtraordinary, of the Tides; as, their precise time of Ebbing and Flowing\r\nin Rivers, at _Promontories_ or _Capes_; which way their Current runs, what\r\nPerpendicular distance there is between the highest Tide and lowest Ebb,\r\nduring the Spring-Tides and Neap-Tides; what day of the _Moons_ age, and at\r\ntimes of the year, the highest and lowest Tides fall out: And all other\r\nconsiderable Accidents, they can observe in the Tides, cheifly neer Ports,\r\nand about Ilands, as in St. _Helena_'s Iland, and the three Rivers there,\r\nat the _Bermodas_ &c.\r\n\r\n4. To make Plotts and Draughts of prospect of Coasts, Promontories, Islands\r\nand Ports, marking the Bearings and Distances, as neer as they can.\r\n\r\n5. To sound and marke the Depths of Coasts and Ports, and such other places\r\nnere the shoar, as they shall think fit.\r\n\r\n6. To take notice of the Nature of the Ground at the bottom of the Sea, in\r\nall Soundings, whether it be Clay, Sand, Rock, &c.\r\n\r\n7. To keep a Register of all changes of Wind and Weather at all houres, by\r\nnight and by day, shewing the point the Wind blows from, whether strong or\r\nweak: The Rains, Hail, Snow and the like, the precise times of their\r\nbeginnings and continuance, especiall _Hurricans_ and _Spouts_; but above\r\nall to take exact care to observe the _Trade-Winds_, about what degree of\r\n_Latitude_ and _Longitude_ they first begin, _where_ and _when_ they cease,\r\nor change, or grow stronger or weaker, and how much; as near and exact as\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n8. To observe and record all Extraordinary _Meteors_, Lightnings, Thunders,\r\n_Ignes fatui_, Comets, &c. marking still the places and times of their\r\nappearing, continuance. &c.\r\n\r\n9. To carry with them good Scales, and Glasse-Violls of a pint or so, with\r\nvery narrow mouths, which are to be fill'd with Sea-water in different\r\ndegrees of _Latitude_, as often as {143} they please, and the weight of the\r\nVial full of water taken exactly at every time, and recorded, marking\r\nwithall the degree of _Latitude_, and the day of the Month: And that as\r\nwell of water near the Top; as at a greater Depth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations concerning _Jupiter_. Of the shadow of one of his\r\n_Satellites_ seen, by a Telescope passing over the Body of _Jupiter_._\r\n\r\nI have received an Account from very good hands, That on the 26^{th.} of\r\n_September_ last, at half hour after seven of the Clock, was seen, both in\r\n_Holland_ and in _France_ (by curious Observers, with very good Telescopes)\r\nthe shadow of one of the _Satellites_ of _Jupiter_, passing over his Body.\r\nOne of those small Stars moving about his Body (which are therefore called\r\nhis _Satellites_) coming between the Sun and it, made a small Eclipse,\r\nappearing in the Face of _Jupiter_ as a little round black Spot. The\r\nParticulars of those Observations, when they shall come to our Hands, we\r\nmay (if need be) make them publik: Which Observations, as they are in\r\nthemselves very remarkable, and argue the Excellency of the Glasses by\r\nwhich they were discovered; So are we, in part, beholding to Monsieur\r\n_Cassini_ for them, who giving notice before hand of such Appearances to be\r\nexpected, gave occasion to those Curious Observers to look for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a permanent Spot in _Jupiter_: by which is manifested the conversion of\r\n_Jupiter_ about his own Axis._\r\n\r\nBesides that Transient Shadow last mentioned, there hath been observed, by\r\nMonsieur _Cassini_, a permanent Spot in the Disque of _Jupiter_; by the\r\nhelp whereof, he hath been able to observe, not onely that _Jupiter_ turns\r\nabout upon his own Axis, but also the Time of such conversion; which he\r\n{144} estimates to be, 9 hours and 56 minutes.\r\n\r\nFor as _Kepler_ did before conjecture, from the motion of the Primitive\r\nPlanets about the Sun as their Center, that the Sun moved about its own\r\nAxis, but could not prove it, till by _Galileo_ and _Shiner_ the Spots in\r\nthe Sun were discovered; so it hath been thought reasonable, from the\r\nSecundary Planets moving about _Jupiter_, that _Jupiter_ is also moved\r\nabout his Axis; yet, till now, it hath not been evinced by Observation,\r\nThat it doth so move; much less, in what Period of Time. And the like\r\nreason there is to judge so of _Saturn_, because of the Secundary Planet\r\ndiscovered by Monsieur _Hugens de Zulichem_ to move about it; (though such\r\nmotion be not yet evinced from Observation:) as well as that of the\r\n_Earth_, from its Attendant the _Moon_.\r\n\r\nWhether the same may be also concluded of the other Planets, _Mars_,\r\n_Venus_, and _Mercury_, (about whom have not yet been observed any\r\nSecondary Planets to move,) is not so evident. Yet there may be somewhat of\r\nlike probability in those. Not onely, because it is possible they may have\r\nSecundary Planets about them, though not yet discovered; (For, we know, it\r\nwas long after those of _Jupiter_, before that about _Saturn_ was\r\ndiscovered; and who knows, what after times may discover about the rest?)\r\nBut because the Primary Planets being all in like manner inlightned by the\r\nSun, and (in all likely hood) moved by it; it is likely that they be moved\r\nby the same Laws and Methods; and therefore, turn'd about their own Axis,\r\nas it is manifest that some of them are.\r\n\r\nBut, as for the Secundary Planets, as well those about _Jupiter_, as that\r\nabout _Saturn_; it is most likely that they have no such Rotation upon\r\ntheir Axis. Not so much because, by reason of their smalness, no such thing\r\nhath been yet observed, (or, indeed, could be, though it were true;) But\r\nbecause they being Analogical to our _Moon_, it is most likely that they\r\nare moved in like manner. Now, though it be {145} true, that there is some\r\nkind of _Libration_ of the Moon's body, so that we have not precisely just\r\nthe same part of it looking towards us; (as is evident by _Hevelius_\r\nobservations, and others;) yet is there no Revolution upon its Axis; the\r\nsame part of it, with very little alteration, always respecting us, as is\r\nto be seen in _Hevelius_ his Tratise _de Motu Lunæ Libratorio_, and indeed,\r\nby all those who have written particularly of the spots on the Moon; and is\r\nuniversally known to all that have with any curiosity viewed it with\r\nTelescopes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of some Philosophical and curious Books, that are shortly to come abroad._\r\n\r\n1.

And, by observing the time of the\r\nBall's stay under water (which may be done by a Watch, having minuts and\r\nseconds, or by a good Minut-glass, or best of all, by a Pendulum vibrating\r\nseconds) you will by this way, with the help of some _Tables_, come to know\r\nany depth of the sea.\r\n\r\nNote, that care must be had of proportioning the weight and shape of the\r\nLead, to the bulk, weight, and figure of the Globe, after such a manner, as\r\nupon experience shall be found most convenient.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Tryals already made with this Instrument, the Globe being of\r\nMaple-wood, well covered with Pitch to hinder soaking in, was 5-13/16\r\ninches in diameter, and weighed 2½ pounds: the Lead of 4½ pounds weight,\r\nwas of a _Conical_ figure, 11. inches long, with the sharper end downwards,\r\n1-9/16 inches at the top, and 1/16 at the bottom in diameter. And in those\r\nExperiments, made in the _Thames_, in the depth of 19. foot water, there\r\npassed between the Immersion and Emersion of the Globe, 6. seconds of an\r\nhour; and in the depth of 10. foot water, there passed 3½ seconds or\r\nthereabout: From many of which kind of Experiments it will likely not be\r\nhard to finde {149} out a method to calculate, what depth is to be\r\nconcluded from any other time of the like Globes stay under water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the same Tryals, made with this Instrument in the said River of\r\n_Thames_, it has been found, that there is no difference in time, between\r\nthe submersions of the Ball at the greatest depth, when it rose two\r\nWherries length from the place where it was let fall (being carried by the\r\nCurrent of the _Tide_) and when it rose within a yard or so of the same\r\nplace where it was let down.\r\n\r\nThe _other_ Instrument, for Fetching up water from the depth of the sea, is\r\n(as appears by _Figure_ 2.) a square woodden _Bucket_ C, whose bottoms\r\n_EE_, are so contrived, that as the weight A, sinks the Iron B, (to which\r\nthe Bucket C, is fastned by two handles DD, on the ends of which are the\r\nmoveable bottoms or Valves EE,) and thereby draws down the Bucket, the\r\nresistance of the water keeps up the Bucket in the posture C; whereby the\r\nwater hath, all the while it is descending, a clear passage through;\r\nwhereas, as soon as the Bucket is pulled upwards by the Line F, the\r\nresistance of the water to that motion beats the Bucket downward, and keeps\r\nit in the posture G, whereby the Included water is preserved from getting\r\nout, and the Ambient water kept from getting in.\r\n\r\nBy the advantage of which Vessel, it may be known, whether sea water be\r\nSalter at and towards the bottom, then at or near the top: Likewise,\r\nwhether in some places of the sea, any sweet water is to be found at the\r\nbottom; the _Affirmative_ whereof is to be met with in the _East Indian_\r\nVoyages of the industrious _John Hugh Van Linsckoten_, who page 16 of that\r\nBook, as 'tis _Englished_, records, that in the _Persian Gulph_, about the\r\nIsland _Barem_, or _Baharem_, they fetch up with certain Vessels (which he\r\ndescribes not) water out of the sea, from under the salt-water, four or\r\nfive fathom deep, as sweet, as any Fountain water. {150}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the Judgement of some of the _English_ Astronomers, touching the\r\ndifference between two learned men, about an Observation made of the First\r\nof the two late _Comets_._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _By _Telescopical_ Stars are understood such, as are not seen,\r\nbut by the help of a Telescope._]\r\n\r\nWhereas notice has been taken in _Num._ 6. of these _Transactions_, that\r\nthere was some difference between those two deservedly celebrated\r\nPhilosophers, _Monsieur Hevelius_ and _Monsieur Auzout_, concerning an\r\nObservation, made by the former of them, on the 8/18 of _February_ 1665. &\r\nthat thereupon some Eminent _English_ Astronomers, considering the\r\nimportance of the dispute, had undertaken the examination thereof; it will,\r\n'tis conceived, not be unacceptable to such, as saw those Papers, to be\r\ninformed, what has been done and discerned by them in that matter. They\r\nhaving therefore compared the Printed Writings of the two Dissenters, and\r\nwithall consulted the observations made with _Telescopes_ at home, by some\r\nof the most intelligent Astronomers amongst them, who have attentively\r\nobserved the Position of that _Comet_ to the _Telescopical_ stars, that lay\r\nin its way; Do thereupon Joyntly conclude, that, whatever that Appearance\r\nwas, which was seen near the _First Star_ of _Aries_, by _Monsieur\r\nHevelius_ (the truth of whose relation concerning the same, they do in no\r\nwise question) the said _Comet_ did not come neer that _Star_ in the left\r\n_Ear_ of _Aries_, where the said M. _Hevelius_ supposes it to have passed,\r\nbut took its course neer the _Bright Star_ in its _Left Horn_, according to\r\n_Bayers_ Tables. And since that the Observations of judicious both _French,\r\nItalian, & Dutch_ Astronomers (as many of them, as are come to the\r\nknowledge of the _English_) do in the main fully agree with theirs, they do\r\nnot at all doubt, but that, there being such an unanimous {151} consent in\r\nwhat has been just now declared, & the Controversie being about _Matter of\r\nfact_, wherein Authority, Number, and Reputation must cast the Ballance,\r\nMons. _Hevelius_, who is as well known for his Ingenuity, as Learning, will\r\njoyn and acquiesce in that sentiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of a correspondency, to be procured, for the Finding out the _True_\r\ndistance of the _Sun_ and _Moon_ from the Earth, by the _Paralax_, observed\r\nunder (or neer) the same _Meridian_._\r\n\r\nSeeing that the knowledge of this distance may prove of important Use, for\r\nthe Perfecting of Astronomy, and for the better establishing the doctrine\r\nof _Refractions_, it is in the thoughts of some very curious Persons in\r\n_England_, for the finding out the same, to settle a Correspondency with\r\nsome others abroad, that are understanding in Astronomical matters, and\r\nlive in places farr distant in _Latitude_, and under (or near) the same\r\n_Meridian_.\r\n\r\nTo perform which, the following Method is proposed to be observed; _viz._\r\nThat at certain times agreed on by two Observatours, making use of\r\n_Telescopes_, large, good and well fitted for this purpose, by a measuring\r\nrod, placed within the Eye glass at a convenient distance, that it may be\r\ndistinctly seen, and serve for measuring small distances by minuts and\r\nseconds (which is easie enough in large _Telescopes_) that, I say, each of\r\nsuch observers, thus furnish't shall observe the visible way of the _Moon_\r\namong the _Fixt Stars_, (by taking her exact distance from any _Fixt\r\nStarr_, that lyes in or very near her way, together with the exact time of\r\nher so appearing) and the then apparent Diameter of her Disk; continuing\r\nthese Observations every time for two or three hours; that so, {152} if\r\npossible, two exact observations of her _Apparent_ place among the _Fixt\r\nStars_ being made, at two places thus distant in _Latitude_, and as near as\r\nmay be under the same _Meridian_, by these Observators concurring at the\r\nsame time, her true and exact distance may be hence collected, not onely\r\nfor that time, but at all other times, by any single Observator's viewing\r\nher with a _Telescope_, and measuring exactly her _Apparent_ Diameter. It\r\nwere likewise desirable, that as often as there happens any considerable\r\n_Eclipse_ of the _Sun_, that this also might be observed by them, noting\r\ntherein the exact measure of the greatest Obscuration compared with the\r\nthen _Apparent_ Diameter of his Disk. For by this means, after the distance\r\nof the _Moon_ hath been exactly found, the distance of the _Sun_ will\r\neasily be deduced.\r\n\r\nAs for the time, fittest for making Observations of the _Moon_, that will\r\nbe, when she is about a Quarter or somewhat less illuminated, because then\r\nher light is not so bright, but that with a good _Telescope_ she may be\r\nobserv'd to pass close by, and sometimes over several _Fixt Stars_; which\r\nis about four or five days before or after her Change: Or else at any other\r\ntime, when the _Moon_ passes near or over some of the bigger sort of _Fixt\r\nStars_, such as of the first or second _Magnitude_; which may be easily\r\ncalculated and foreseen: Or best of all, when there is any _Totall Eclipse_\r\nof the _Moon_; for then the smallest _Telescopical Stars_ may be seen close\r\nadjoyning to the very body of the _Moon_. Of all which particulars the two\r\nCorrespondents are to agree, as soon as he, that is to joyn abroad, shall\r\nbe found out; whereupon they are mutually to communicate to each other,\r\nwhat they shall have thus observed in each place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of an Observation, not long since made in _England_, of _Saturn_._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis Observation was made by Mr. _William Ball_, {153} accompanied by his\r\nbrother, Dr. _Ball_, _October_ 13. 1665. at six of the Clock, at _Mainhead_\r\nnear _Exeter_ in _Devonshire_, with a very good _Telescope_ near 38 foot\r\nlong, and a double Eye-glass, as the observer himself takes notice, adding,\r\nthat he never saw that _Planet_ more distinct. The observation is\r\nrepresented by _Figure_ 3. concerning which, the Author saith in his letter\r\nto a friend, as follows; This appear'd to me the present figure of\r\n_Saturn_, somewhat otherwise, than I expected, thinking it would have been\r\ndecreasing, but I found it full as ever, and a little hollow above and\r\nbelow. Whereupon the Person, to whom notice was sent hereof, examining this\r\nshape, hath by Letters desired the worthy Author of the _Systeme of this\r\nPlanet_, that he would now attentively consider the present _Figure_ of his\r\n_Anses_ or _Ring_, to see whether the appearance be to him, as in this\r\n_Figure_, and consequently whether he there meets with nothing, that may\r\nmake him think, that it is not _one_ body of a Circular Figure, that\r\nembraces his _Diske_, but _two_.\r\n\r\nAnd to the end that other Curious men, in other places might be engaged, to\r\njoyn their Observations with him, to see, whether they can find the like\r\nappearance to that, represented here, especially such Notches or\r\nHollownesses, as at A and B, it was thought fit to insert here the newly\r\nrelated Account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of some _Mercurial_ Observations, and their Results._\r\n\r\nModern _Philosophers_, to avoyd Circumlocutions, call that Instrument,\r\nwherein a Cylinder of Quicksilver, of between 28. and 31. Inches in\r\nAltitude, is kept suspended after the manner of the _Torricellian_\r\nExperiment, a _Barometer_ or _Baroscope_, first made publick by that Noble\r\nSearcher of Nature, Mr. _Boyle_, and imployed by Him and others, to detect\r\nall the minut variations in the Pressure and weight of the Air. For the\r\nmore {154} curious and nice distinguishing of which small changes, Mr.\r\n_Hook_ in the _Preface_ to his _Micrography_, has described such an\r\nInstrument with a _Wheel_, contrived by himself, and, by these two last\r\nyears trials of it, constantly found most exact for that purpose: which\r\nbeing so accurate, and not difficult to be made, it were desirable, that\r\nthose who have a Genius and opportunities of making Observations of this\r\nkind, would furnish themselves with such of these Instruments, as were\r\nexactly made and adjusted according to the Method, delivered in the newly\r\nmentioned place.\r\n\r\nTo say something of the Observations, made by this Instrument, and withal\r\nto excite studious _Naturalists_ to a sedulous prosecution of the same, the\r\n_Reader_ may _first_ take notice, that the lately named Mr. _Boyle_ hath\r\n(as himself not long since did intimate to the Author of these _Tracts_)\r\nalready made divers Observations of this kind in the year 1659. and 1660.\r\nbefore any others were publick, or by him so much as heard of; though he\r\nhas hitherto forborn to divulge them, because of some other Papers (in\r\nwhose Company they were to appear) which being hindred by other studies and\r\nemployments, he hath not as yet finished.\r\n\r\n_Next_, that, besides several others, who, since have had the curiosity of\r\nmaking such observations, the Worthy and Inquisitive Dr. _John Beal_, is\r\ndoing his part with much assiduity (of which he hath by several Letters\r\nacquainted his Friends in _London_) both by observing himself, and by\r\nprocuring many Correspondents in several places in _England_ for the same\r\npurpose; judging it of great importance, that Observations of this kind be\r\nmade in parts somewhat distant from one another, that so from many of\r\nthose, accurately made and then compared, it may be discovered, whether the\r\nAire gravitates more in the parts of the Earth lying more _East_ or _West_,\r\n_North_ or _South_? whether on such as lie neerer to the _Sea_, or further\r\nup into the _Mainland_? in hotter or colder weather? whether in {155} high\r\nWinds or Calms? whether in wet weather or dry? whether most when a North,\r\nor when a South, when an East or a West wind blows? and whether it keeps\r\nthe same seasons of Changes? and whether the seasons and changes of the Air\r\nand Weather can be thereby discover'd, and the now hidden causes of many\r\nother _Phænomena_ detected?\r\n\r\nThe said _Doctor_ is so much pleased with the discovery already made by the\r\nhelp of this Instrument, that he thinks it to be one of the most wonderful\r\nthat ever was in the World, if we speak of strangeness, and just wonder,\r\nand of Philosophical importance, separate from the interest of lucre. For\r\n(_saith he in one of his Letters_) who could ever expect, that we men\r\nshould find an Art, to weigh all the Air that hangs over our heads, in all\r\nthe changes of it, and, as it were, to weigh, and to distinguish by weight,\r\nthe Winds and the Clouds? Or, who did believe, that by palpable evidence we\r\nshould be able to prove, the _serenest_ Air to be most heavy, and the\r\n_thickest_ Air, and when darkest Clouds hang neerest to us, ready to\r\ndissolve, or dropping, _then_ to be lightest. And though (_so he goes on_)\r\nwe cannot yet reach to all the Uses and Applications of it, yet we should\r\nbe entertain'd for a while, by the truly Honourable Mr. _Boyle_, as the\r\nleading person herein, upon the delight and wonder. The _Magnet_ was known\r\nmany hundreds of years before it was applied to find out _New Worlds_. To\r\nme (_saith he_) tis a wonderful delight, that I have alwaies in my Study\r\nbefore my eye such a _Curious Ballance_.\r\n\r\nHaving thus in _General_ expressed his thoughts about this Invention, and\r\nthe singular pleasure, he takes in the Observations made therewith, he\r\ndescends to particulars, and in several Letters communicates them to his\r\nCorrespondent, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Exclusion of _all_ Air is here necessary, because Air being\r\nsubject to the operation of Heat and Cold, if any of it remain in the\r\n_Barometer_, it will cause it to vary from shewing the true Pressure of the\r\nAir._]\r\n\r\n1. My _Wheel-barometer_ I could never fill so exactly with _Mercury_ as to\r\nexclude _all_ Air; and therefore I trust more {156} to a _Mercurial_ Cane,\r\nand take all my Notes from it. This Cane is but 35. Inches long, of a very\r\nslender Cavity, and thick Glass. This may easily be conveyed to any place,\r\nfor Trials. The Vessel for the stagnating _Mercury_, into which the said\r\nCane is immersed, is about two _Inches_ wide. The _Mercury_ so well fill'd,\r\nthat for some daies it would not subside, but hung to the top of the\r\nGlass-cane. I keep it in a Closet pretty close, 9. foot high, 8. foot\r\nbroad, 15. foot long; neer a Window. This I note, because possibly the\r\ncloseness of the room may hinder, that it gives not the full of all\r\nChanges, as it might in a more passable Air.\r\n\r\n2. In all my Observations from _May_ 28. 1664 to this present (_December_\r\n9. 1665.) the Quicksilver never ascended but very little above 30¼ Inches.\r\n\r\n3. It ascended very seldom so high (_videl._ to 30¼ Inches) chiefly\r\n_Decemb._ 13. 1664. the weather being fickle-fair, Evening.\r\n\r\n4. I find by my _Calender_ of _June_ 22. 1664. at 5. in the Morning, in a\r\ntime of long setled fair weather, that the _Mercury_ had ascended about\r\nhalf an Inch higher then 30: but I fear some mistake, because I then took\r\nno impression of _wonder_ at it; yet for 3. or 4. daies, at that time it\r\ncontinued high, in well-setled, fair and warm weather; most part above 30.\r\nInches. So that I may note, the _Mercury_ to rise as high in the hottest\r\n_Summer_, as in the coldest _Winter-weather_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Perhaps this is from some included Air._]\r\n\r\n5. Yet surely I have noted it ascend a little higher for the Coldness of\r\nthe Weather; and very frequently, both in {157} Winter and Summer to be\r\nhigher in the cold Mornings and Evenings, then in the warmer Mid-day.\r\n\r\n6. Generally in setled and fair weather both of Winter and Summer, the\r\n_Mercury_ is higher, than a little _before_ or _after_, or _in_ Rainy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n7. Again, generally it descended lower after Rain, than it was before Rain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _It seems these were _Easterly_ winds._]\r\n\r\n8. Generally also it falls in great winds; and somewhat it seem'd to sink,\r\nwhen I open'd a wide door to it, to let in stormy winds; yet I have found\r\nit to continue very high, in a long stormy wind of 3. or 4. daies.\r\n\r\n9. Again, generally it is higher in an _East_ and _North_-wind. (_Cæteris\r\nparibus_) than in a _South_ and _West_-wind.\r\n\r\n10. I tryed several times, by strong fumes and thick smoaks to alter the\r\nAir in my Closet; but I cannot affirm, that the _Mercury_ yielded any more,\r\nthen might be expected from some increase of heat. Such as have exact\r\n_Wheel-Barometers_, may try whether Odors or Fumes do alleviate the Air.\r\n\r\n11. In this Closet I have not in all this time found the extreamest changes\r\nof the Quicksilver to amount to more, than to 2¾, or to 2-7/8. inches, at\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n12. Very often I have found great changes in the Air, without any\r\nperceptible change in the _Barometer_; as in the dewy nights, when the\r\nmoisture descends in a great quantity, and the thickness sometimes seems to\r\nhide the Stars from us: In the days foregoing, and following, the Vapors\r\nhave been {158} drawn up so _Invisibly_, that the Air and Sky seem'd very\r\nclear all day long. This I account a great change between ascending and\r\ndescending Dews and Vapors (which import Levity and Weight,) and between\r\nthick Air and clear Air: which changes do sometimes continue in the\r\nAlternative course of day and night, for a week or fortnight together; and\r\nyet the _Baroscope_ holding the same.\r\n\r\n13. Sometimes (I say not often) the _Baroscope_ yields not to other very\r\ngreat changes of the Air. As lately (_December_ 18.) an extraordinary\r\nbright and clear day; and the next following quite darkened, some Rain and\r\nSnow falling; but the _Mercury_ the same: so in high winds and calms the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n14. I do conceive, that such as converse much _Sub dio_, and walk much\r\nabroad, may find many particulars much more exactly, then I, who have no\r\nleisure for it, can undertake. To instance in one of many, _December_ 16.\r\nlast, was a clear cold day, very sharp and strong _East_ wind, the\r\n_Mercury_ very near 30. inches high, about three in the afternoon, I saw a\r\nlarge black cloud, drawing near us from the _East_ and _South-East_, with\r\nthe _East-wind_. The _Mercury_ changed not that day nor the day following;\r\nthe Stars and most of the sky were very bright and clear till Nine of the\r\nClock; and then suddenly all the sky was darkned, yet no change of weather\r\nhappened; _December_ 17. the frost held, and 'twas a clear day, till about\r\ntwo of the clock in the afternoon; and then many thick clouds appear'd low\r\nin the _West_; yet no change of the weather here; the Wind, Frost, and\r\nQuick-silver, the same, _December_ 18. the _Mercury_ fell almost ¼ of an\r\ninch, and the sky and Air so clear and bright and cold with an _East-wind_,\r\nthat I wondred what could cause the _Mercury_ to descend. I Expected, it\r\nshould have ascended, as usually it does in such clear skys. Casually I\r\nsent my servant abroad, and he discovered the remote Hills, about 20. miles\r\noff, cover'd with {159} snow, This seem'd to manifest, that the Air, being\r\ndischarged of the clouds by snow, became lighter.\r\n\r\n15. I have seldom seen the change to be very great, at any one time. For,\r\nthough I do not now take a deliberate view of my Notes, yet I wonder'd once\r\nto see, that in one day it subsided about ¾ of an inch.\r\n\r\n16. Of late I have altered my Method upon the _Barometer_, observing it, as\r\nit is before my Eyes, all day long, and much of the night, being watchful\r\nfor the moments of every particular change, to examine, what cause in the\r\nAir and Heavens may appear for such changes. And now my wonder is, to see,\r\nhow slow it is, it holding most between the nine and twentieth and\r\nthirtieth inch of late.\r\n\r\n17. I must now (_January_ 13. 1665/6) tell you, that the _Mercury_ stands\r\nat this time (as it did also yesterday) a quarter above 30. inches; yet\r\nboth days very dark and cloudy, sometimes very thick and misty Air; which\r\nseldom falls out. For, for the most part, I see it higher in clearest\r\nsetled weather, than in such cloudy and misty Foggs. This thick Air and\r\ndarkness hath lasted above a week; lately more Cold, and _East_ and\r\n_North-East_ wind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _This seems to be wished, because the motion of the _Mercury_\r\nmay be more free in a wider Cane._]\r\n\r\n_Thus far_ the Notes of this Observing _Divine_; of which Mr. _Boyle_, to\r\nwhom they were also communicated, entertains these thoughts, that they seem\r\nto him very faithfully made, and do for the main, agree well enough with\r\nhis observations, as far as he remembers, not having them, it seems, at\r\nthat time, when he wrote this, at hand; and though it be wished by him,\r\nthat the Observer's Glass-Cane had been somewhat bigger; yet his diligence\r\nin fitting it so carefully, or rather so skilfully, as is above-mentioned,\r\nis much by him commended. {160}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations of _Vipers_._\r\n\r\nA curious _Italian_, called _Francesco Redi_, having lately had an\r\nopportunity, by the great number of Vipers, brought to the _Grand Duke_ of\r\n_Toscany_ for the composing of _Theriac_ or _Treacle_, to examine what is\r\nvulgarly delivered and believed concerning the Poyson of those Creatures,\r\nhath, (according to the account, given of it in the French _Journal des\r\nScavans_, printed _January_ 4. 1665/6) performed his undertaking with much\r\nexactness, and published in an Italian tract, not yet come into _England_,\r\nthese Observations.\r\n\r\n1. He hath observed, that the poyson of Vipers is neither in their _Teeth_,\r\nnor in their _Tayle_, nor in their _Gall_: but in the two _Vesicles_ or\r\n_Bladders_, which cover their teeth, and which coming to be compressed,\r\nwhen the Vipers bite, do emit a certain yellowish Liquor, that runs along\r\nthe teeth and poysons the wound. Whereof he gives this proof, that he hath\r\nrub'd the wounds of many Animals with the _Gall_ of Vipers, and pricked\r\nthem with their _Teeth_, and yet no considerable ill accident follow'd upon\r\nit, but that as often as he rubbed the wounds with the said yellow Liquor,\r\nnot one of them escaped.\r\n\r\n2. Whereas commonly it hath hitherto been believed, that the poyson of\r\nVipers being swallowed, was present death; this _Author_, after many\r\nreiterated Experiments, is said to have observed, that in Vipers there is\r\nneither Humour, nor Excrement, nor any part, not the _Gall_ it self, that,\r\nbeing taken into the Body, kills. And he assures, that he hath seen men\r\neat, and hath often made Bruit Animals swallow all that is esteem'd most\r\npoysonous in a Viper, yet without the least mischief to them. Whence he\r\nshews, that it needs not so much to be wondred at, that certain _Empiricks_\r\nswallow the juyce of the {161} most venomous Animals without receiving any\r\nharm thereby; adding, that, which is ascribed to the vertue of their\r\n_Antidote_, ought to be attributed to the nature of those kinds of Poysons,\r\nwhich are no poysons, when they are swallow'd, (for which Doctrine he also\r\nalledges _Celsus_) but onely when they are put into wounds. Which also has\r\nbeen noted by _Lucan_, who introduces _Cato_ thus speaking;\r\n\r\n  _Noxia serpentum est admisto sanguine pestis,_\r\n  __Morsu_ virus habent, & fatum _dente_ minantur;_\r\n  __Pocula_ morte carent._\r\n\r\nAnd what also some Authors have affirm'd, _videl._ That it is mortal, to\r\neat of the Flesh of creatures killed by Vipers; or to drink of the Wine\r\nwherein Vipers have been drowned; or to suck the wounds that have been made\r\nby them, is by this Authour observed to be wide of truth. For he assures,\r\nthat many persons have eaten Pullets and Pigeons, bitten by Vipers, without\r\nfinding any alteration from it in their health. On the contrary, he\r\ndeclares, That it is a soveraign Remedy against the biting of Vipers, to\r\nsuck the wound; alledging an Experiment, made upon a Dog, which he caused\r\nto be bitten by a Viper at the nose, who by licking his own wound saved his\r\nlife. Which he confirms by the example of those people, celebrated in\r\n_History_ by the name of _Marsi_ and _Psilli_, whose Employment it was, to\r\nheal those, that had been bitten by Serpents, by sucking their wounds.\r\n\r\n3. He adds, that although _Galen_ and many modern _Physitians_ do affirm,\r\nthat there is nothing, which causeth so much thirst, as Vipers-flesh, yet\r\nhe hath experimented the contrary and knows divers persons, who did eat the\r\nflesh of Vipers at all their meals, and yet did assure him, they never were\r\nless dry, then when they observed that kind of Diet.\r\n\r\n4. As for the Salt of Vipers, whereof some _Chymists_ have {162} so great\r\nesteem, he saith, that it hath no _Purging_ vertue at all in it; adding\r\nthat even of _All Salts_, none hath more vertue than another, as he\r\npretends to have shew'd in an other _Book_ of his, _De natura salium_;\r\nwhich also hath not been yet transmitted into these parts.\r\n\r\n5. He denies, what _Aristotle_ assures, and what _Galen_ saith to have\r\noften tryed, that the _Spittle_ of a _Fasting_ person kills Vipers; and he\r\nlaughs at many other particulars, that have been delivered concerning the\r\n_Antipathy_ of Vipers unto certain things; and their manner of Conception\r\nand Generation, and several other properties, commonly ascribed to them;\r\nwhich the alledged French Author affirms to be refuted by so many\r\nexperiments made by this _Italian_ Philosopher, that it seems to him, there\r\nis no place left for doubting, after so authentick a testimony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Advertisement._\r\n\r\nThe _Reader_ of these _Transactions_ is desired to correct these _Errata_\r\nin _Number_ 8. _viz._ page. 132. line penult. read _Wine_ for _Lime_; and\r\npage 133. line 10. read _Thresher_ for _Trepher_, as some _Copies_ have it;\r\nand page 136. line ult. read _purifie_ for _putrifie_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON,_\r\n\r\nPrinted for _John Martyn_ and _James Allestree_, Printers to the Royal\r\nSociety. 1666.\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 10.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _March_ 12. 1665/6.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _Observations continued upon the _Barometer_, or _Ballance of the Air_.\r\n    A Relation concerning the _Earth-quake_ neer _Oxford_; together with\r\n    some Observations of the sealed _Weatherglass_ and _Barometer_\r\n    thereupon by _Dr. Wallis_.

As I have fitted and filled the _Single Cane_, I can say in the general,\r\nThat I have not yet found any such infallible Prognostick of these changes\r\nof weather, which do follow a long serenity, or setled weather. And\r\nperchance in brighter Climats it may be constantly infallible. In these\r\n_Northern Islands_, the Clouds are so short, and narrow, and by fickle\r\nchanges are sometimes emptied upon us, sometimes so neer, as may make so\r\nlittle variation in the weight of the whole Atmosphere of Air, as may\r\nsometimes deceive us, or smother and hide from us the causes of fixedness,\r\nor of changes. I wish I could see a good _Calendar_ or _Journal_ taken in\r\ntaken in _Tangier_, and in some of our _Northern_ and most _Southern_ parts\r\nof _America_. I have store of _Hygroscopes_ of divers kinds; and I do\r\nremark them, and the sweatings of Marble, and as many other famed\r\nPrognosticks, as I can hear off; but can find nothing so neerly indicative\r\nof the change of weather, as this _Ballance_. Those others are often\r\nchanged by Dews, which do not at all alter the _Ballance_, nor alter the\r\nstate of the weather: And the open Weather-glass is known to signifie\r\nnothing at certainty, having a double obedience to two Masters, sometimes\r\nto the _Weight of the Air_, sometimes to _Heat_, as the service is\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n2. And in further confirmation of this Note, I may adde to the former, That\r\nin _January_ last 1665/6, from the _fourth_, and more especially from the\r\n_seventh_ day, for many daies it continued very dark, so that all men\r\nexpected daily great rain; yet the _Mercury_ held very high, neer to the\r\ngreatest height; And though in those daies sometimes thick mists arose, and\r\nsome small rain fell, yet the _Quick-silver_ held at a great height: which\r\ndid indicate to me, there could _then_ be no great change of weather. As\r\nthe small rain fell, it yeilded somewhat, not much; and that does more\r\n{165} confirm the indication. And more lately, in very dark daies, I had\r\nthe same confidence upon the same ground, and I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\n3. Again, if the _Mercury_ ascends to a good height after the fall of rain\r\n(as sometimes, but less often it does) then I look for a setled serenity;\r\nbut if it proceeds after rain in a descending motion, then I expect a\r\ncontinuance of broken and showry weather. But in all, as I only say, _For\r\nthe most part_, so I dare not positively declare it an affirmative result,\r\nbut do refer it to the remarks of others. And this may explicate the Notes\r\n6. and 14 of _Num._ 9. into more clearness.\r\n\r\n4. That we find the Weather and our Bodies more chill, cold, and drooping,\r\nwhen the _Mercury_ is lowest, and the Air lightest, besides other causes, I\r\nguess, That as Air is to us the breath of life, as water is to Fishes; so,\r\nwhen we are deprived of the usual measure of this our food, 'tis the same\r\nto us, as when the water is drawn ebb from Fishes. But I would much rather\r\nbe instructed by others, then offer much in this kind.\r\n\r\n5. The lowest descent of the _Mercury_ in all the time, since I have\r\nobserved it, was _Octob._ 26. 1665. in the Evening, when it was very near\r\nat 27½ Inches. Which I find thus circumstanced with the weather in my\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n    _Oct._ 25. Morning; _Mercury_ at 28½ Inch. Great storms and much rain.\r\n\r\n    _Oct._ 26. Morning; _Merc._ at 28. winds quiet, thick dark clouds.\r\n\r\n    _Oct._ 26. Evening; _Merc._ at 27½. That day, and some daies following,\r\n    the weather was variable, frequent rain, and as you see, the _Mercury_\r\n    lower, than usual.\r\n\r\n6. Over the place, where this _Mercurial Cane_ stands, I have set a _Wind\r\nvane_, with purpose of exactness, of a Streamer in Brass so large, and\r\npointing to a Board indented in the Margin, that I can at a sure Level upon\r\nthe _Vane_, take every of the 32. points of the Wind, half points, and\r\nquarter points, at good distance. Otherwise we may find our guesses much\r\ndeceived, as the best guessers, upon trial, do acknowledge. And this\r\nexactness may become the _Wheel-ballance_, which shews the minutest\r\nvariations almost beyond imagination. And thus any servant, at the approach\r\nof a thick Cloud, or other _Meteor_, higher or lower, or at the rising of a\r\nstorm or fresh wind in the night, or day, may bring a report of the Weight\r\nof the Air, as certainly and almost as {166} easily, as of the Sun from the\r\n_Dial_ in a Sunshine. It were good to have an _Index_ of Winds, that\r\ndiscover'd as well their Ascent and Descent, as their Side-coastings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation concerning the late _Earthquake_ neer _Oxford_; together with\r\nsome Observations of the sealed Weatherglass, and the Barometer both upon\r\nthat _Phænomenon_, and in _General_._\r\n\r\nThis Relation was communicated by the excellently learned Dr. _Wallis_, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOn the 19. of _January_ 1665. _Stylo Angliæ_ (or _Jan._ 29. 1666. _stylo\r\nnovo_) at divers places neer _Oxford_, was observed a small _Earthquake_\r\n(as at _Blechington, Stanton-St. Johns, Bril_, &c.) towards evening. In\r\n_Oxford_ it self, I doe not hear, that it was observ'd to be an Earthquake;\r\nyet I remember about that time (whether precisely then or not; I cannot\r\nsay) I took notice of some kind of odde shaking or heaving I observed in my\r\nstudy, but did impute it to the going of Carts or Coaches, supposed to be\r\nnot far off; though yet I did take notice of it, as a little differing from\r\nwhat is usual on such occasions; (and wondered the more, that I did not\r\nhear any:) But not knowing, what else to refer it to, I thought no more of\r\nit. And the like account I have had from some others in _Oxford_, who yet\r\ndid not think of an Earth-quake; it being a rare thing with us. Hearing\r\nafterwards of an Earthquake observed by others; I looked on my Notes\r\nconcerning my _Thermoscope_ and _Baroscope_, to see if any alteration\r\nconsiderable had then happened.\r\n\r\nMy _Thermoscope_ consists of a round large Glass, containing about half a\r\npint or more; from whence issues a long Cylindrical neck of Glass, about\r\ntwo foot and a half in length, and less than a quarter of an inch diameter;\r\nwhich neck was _hermetically_ sealed at the top, to exclude communication\r\nwith the External Air; but before the sealing of it, the whole Glass was\r\nfilled with _Spirit of Wine_ (tinged with _Cochineel_, to make it the more\r\ndiscernable to the Eye) so warmed, that it filled the whole content of the\r\nGlass; but afterwards, as it cooled, did so subside, as to leave a void\r\nspace in the upper part of the Neck. Which Instrument, so prepared, doth by\r\nthe rising or falling of the tinged liquor in the neck (consequent upon the\r\nexpanding or contracting of the whole liquor contained in it and the Ball\r\nbelow) give a very nice account of the Temperature of the Air, {167} as to\r\n_Heat_ or _Cold_: Even so nice, as that my being or not being in my Study I\r\nfind to vary its hight sometimes almost a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nMy _Baroscope_, I call another Instrument for estimating the _Weight_ or\r\n_Pressure_ of the Incumbent Air, consisting of a long _Glass-tube_ of about\r\n4. foot in length, and about a quarter of an inch Bore: which tube\r\n(_hermetically_ sealed at the one end) being filled with Quicksilver\r\n(according to the _Torricellian_ Experiment) is inverted, so as to have the\r\nopen end of it immersed in Stagnant Quicksilver, contained in a larger\r\nGlass under it, exposed to the pressure of the outward Air: Out of which\r\nopen end (after such immersion) the Quicksilver in the Tube being suffered\r\nto run out, as much as it will, into the Stagnant Quicksilver, in which\r\nthat mouth or open end is immersed, there is wont to remain (as is commonly\r\nknown to those acquainted with this Experiment) a Cylinder of Quicksilver\r\nsuspended in the Tube, about 28, 29, or 30. inches high; measuring from the\r\nsurface of the Stagnant Quicksilver perpendicularly; (but more or less,\r\nwithin such limits, according as the Weight or Pressure of the Air\r\nincumbent on the External Stagnant Quicksilver exposed to it, is greater or\r\nless:) leaving the upper part of the Tube void. (Both which Instruments\r\nbeing the contrivance of the Honourable _Robert Boyle_, they are by him\r\nmore particularly described in his _Physico-Mechanical Experiments touching\r\nthe Air, Exper._ 17. and 18. and in his _Thermometrical Discourses_,\r\npremised to his _History of Cold_.)\r\n\r\nNow, according to both these Instruments, having kept a daily _Register_ of\r\nObservations for more than a whole year (saving when I have been for some\r\nshort time absent from home) I find my Notes for that day to be these.\r\n\r\n    _January._  |_Thermoscope._|_Baroscope._        1665/6.\r\n    Day.  Hour. |   inches.    | inches.\r\n   19. 8. Morn. |   14-1/16.   | 29-1/2.       Hard frost. Close.\r\n       4. Even. |   14-3/8.    | 29-1/4.       Hard frost. Cloudy.\r\n       9.

Wind.\r\n\r\nSo that, there being in the morning (_January_ 19.) a hard frost (which\r\nbegan the day before about 4. of the Clock in the {168} afternoon (_Jan._\r\n18.) and continued (with us) till about 5. of the Clock in the afternoon of\r\nthat day, _Jan_ 19. with some fierceness) and the weather, _Jan._ 19. being\r\nin the morning, close; and cloudy all the day, with little of Sun-shine;\r\nthe Liquor in the _Thermoscope_ was very little raised, by 4. of the Clock\r\nafternoon, that is, but 5/16 of an inch (which, had the Sun shone, would,\r\nit's likely, have been near an Inch:) and after that time (or somewhat\r\nbefore) had there been no considerable change of weather, it would upon the\r\nSun's setting have fallen (and probably so it did, till about 5. of the\r\nClock, though I took no Observation in the interim.) But, contrary to what\r\nwould have been expected, it was at 9. of the Clock at night, higher by 1/8\r\nof an inch, than it had been at 4. occasioned by the change of weather, the\r\nFrost suddenly breaking, with us, between 5. and 6. of the Clock; about\r\nwhich time also it began to rain, and continued raining that Evening and\r\ngood part of the Night. And the next morning I found the Liquor yet higher\r\nby half an inch, _vid._ 15¼ inches: (by reason of the Air that night being\r\nso much warmer, than it had been the day before;) whereas commonly it is\r\nconsiderably lower in the morning, than over night.\r\n\r\nAs to the _Baroscope_, for the Weight or Pressure of the Air; I find, that\r\nfor the 11, l2, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. dayes, the _Mercury_ in the Tube,\r\nwas (by the ballancing Pressure of the incumbent Air on the stagnant\r\nQuicksilver, exposed to it) kept up to the height of near 30. Inches above\r\nthe surface of the External Quicksilver, (though with some little\r\nvariation, as 30, 29-15/16, 29-7/8, 29-13/16 but never so low, all that\r\ntime, as 29¾;) which is the greatest height I have know it at, (for I do\r\nnot find that I have ever, till then, observed it to be, in my Glasses,\r\nfull 30. Inches, though it have been very near it:) the Weather having been\r\nalmost continually Foggy, or very thick Mists, all that time. _January_ 18.\r\nit came down to 29¾, in the forenoon; and afternoon, to 29-11/16. about the\r\ntime the frost began: And _Jan._ 19. it was, at 8. in the morning, come\r\ndown to 29½; at 4. in the afternoon, to 29¼. But at 9. in the evening (when\r\nthe Earth quake had intervened) it was risen half an inch, _vid._ to 29¾.\r\nAnd, by the next morning, fallen again a whole inch, _vid._ to 28¾; which\r\nfall I attribute (at least in part) to the rain that fell in the night.\r\n\r\nThis being what I observed out of my _Register_ of these Instruments,\r\n(which, if I had then thought of an Earthquake, I {169} should have more\r\nnicely watched) what I have further gathered from Reports, is to this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nI hear, it was observed at _Blechington_, above 5. miles to the _North_ of\r\n_Oxford_, and so along by _Bostol_, _Horton_, _Stanton-St. Johns_, and so\r\ntowards _Whately_, which is about 4. miles _Eastward_ from _Oxford_. Not at\r\nall these places at the same time, but moving forward from _Blechington_\r\ntowards _Whately_. For it was at _Stanton_ about 6. of the Clock or later\r\n(as I understand from Mr. _Boyle_, who was there at that time;) but had\r\nbeen at _Blechington_ a good while sooner. And I am told, that it was taken\r\nnotice of by Doctor _Holder_ (a Member of our _Society_) who was then at\r\n_Blechington_, to be observed by those in the further part of the Garden,\r\nsome very discernable time before it was observed by those in the House;\r\ncreeping forward from the one place to the other. What other places in the\r\nCountry it was observed at, I have not been informed: but at _Oxford_\r\n(which, it seems, was about the skirts of it) it was so small, as would\r\nhave been hardly noted at all, had not the notice, taken of it abroad,\r\ninformed us of it.\r\n\r\nUpon this Occasion, it will not be unseasonable to give some General\r\naccounts of what I have in my _Thermoscope_ and _Baroscope_ observed.\r\n\r\nMy _Thermoscope_, being fitted somewhat at adventures, I have found at the\r\nlowest to be somewhat more than 12. inches high, in the fiercest time of\r\nthe long Frost in the beginning of the last year 1665. and about 27. Inches\r\nhigh, at the highest, in the hottest time of the last Summer: (which I\r\nmention, that it may appear at what temperature in proportion, the Air was\r\nat the time above-mentioned.) But I must add withall, that this standing\r\nso, as never to be exposed to the Sun, but in a room, that has a window\r\nonly to the North, it would have been raised much higher than 27. inches,\r\nif it were put in the hot Sun-shine in Summer; this, as it is placed,\r\ngiving therefore an account onely of the Temperature of the Air in\r\n_general_, not of the immediate heat of the Sun-shine.\r\n\r\nThis Instrument, thus situated, when it is about 15. inches, or lower, is\r\nfor the most part hard frost; but seldom a frost, if higher than 16. Yet\r\nthis I have often observed, that the Air by the _Thermoscope_ has appeared\r\nconsiderably colder (and the liquor lower) at sometimes when there is no\r\nFrost, than at some other times, when the Frost hath been considerably\r\nhard. {170}\r\n\r\nIn my _Baroscope_, I have never found the Quicksilver higher than 30.\r\ninches, nor lower than 28. (at least, scarce discernably, not 1/16 of an\r\ninch higher than _that_, or lower than _this_;) which I mention, not only\r\nto shew the limits, within which I have observed mine to keep, _vid._ full\r\n2 inches, but likewise as an Estimate of the Clearness of the Quicksilver\r\nfrom Air. For, though my Quicksilver were with good care cleansed from the\r\nAir; yet I find that which Mr. _Boyle_ useth, much better: for, comparing\r\nhis with mine at the same times, and both in _Oxford_, at no great\r\ndistance; I find his Quicksilver to stand alwaies somewhat higher than mine\r\n(sometimes neer a quarter of an Inch;) which I know now how to give a more\r\nprobable account off, than that my Quicksilver is either heavier than his;\r\nor else, that his is better cleansed from Air, (unless, possibly, the\r\ndifference of the Bore, or other circumstances of the Tube, may cause the\r\nalteration; mine being a taller Tube, and a bigger Bore, than his.) And\r\nupon like reason, as his stands higher than mine; so another less cleansed\r\nfrom Air, may at the same time be considerably lower, and consequently\r\nunder 28. Inches at the lowest.\r\n\r\nIn _thick foggy_ weather, I find my Quicksilver to rise; which I adscribe\r\nto the heaviness of the Vapours in the Air. And I have never found it\r\nhigher, than in the foggy weather above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn _Sunshiny_ weather it riseth also (and commonly the clearer, the more;)\r\nwhich, I think, may be imputed _partly_ to the Vapors raised by the Sun,\r\nand making the Air heavier; and _partly_ to the Heat, increasing the\r\nElastick or Springy power of the Air. Which latter I the rather add,\r\nbecause I have sometimes observed in Sunshiny weather, when there have come\r\nClouds for some considerable time (suppose an hour or two) the Quicksilver\r\nhas fallen; and then, upon the Suns breaking out again, it has risen as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIn _Rainy_ weather, it useth to fall (of which the reason is obvious,\r\nbecause the Air is lightned, by so much as falls:) In _Snowy_ weather,\r\nlikewise, but not so much as in _Rain_. And sometimes I have observed it,\r\nupon a _Hoar-frost_, falling in the night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _The Author of these Observations intends hereafter more\r\nparticularly to observe, _from what points_ those Winds blow, that make the\r\nQuicksilver thus subside._]\r\n\r\nFor _Windy_ weather, I find it _generally_ to fall; and that more\r\nuniversally, and more discernably, than upon Rain: (which I attribute to\r\nthe Winds moving the Air _collaterally_, and thereby not suffering it to\r\npress so much _directly_ downwards: the like of {171} which we see in\r\nswimming, &c.) And I have never found it lower than in high Winds.*\r\n\r\nI have divers times, upon discerning my Quicksilver to fall without any\r\nvisible cause at home, looked abroad; and found (by the appearance of\r\nbroken Clouds, or otherwise) that it had rained not far off, though not\r\nwith us: Whereupon, the Air being then lightened, our heavier Air (where it\r\nrained not) may have, in part, discharged it self on that lighter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A more particular Account of those Observations about _Jupiter_, that were\r\nmentioned in _Numb. 8_._\r\n\r\nSince the publishing of _Numb._ 8. of these _Transactions_, where, among\r\nother particulars, some short Observations were set down touching both the\r\n_shadow_ of one of _Jupiter's Satellits_, passing over his Body, and that\r\n_Permanent Spot_, which manifests the Conversion of that Planet about his\r\nown _Axis_; there is come to hand an _Extract_ of that Letter, which was\r\nwritten from _Rome_, about those Discoveries, containing an ample and\r\nparticular Relation of them, as they were made by the Learned _Cassini_,\r\nProfessor of _Astronomy_ in the University of _Bononia_. That _Extract_, as\r\nit is found in the _French Journal des Scavans_ of _Febr._ 22. 1666. we\r\nthus _English_.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Cassini_, after he had discovered (by the means of those\r\nExcellent Glasses of 50. _palmes_, or 35. _feet_, made by M. _Campani_) the\r\n_Shadows_, cast by the 4 Moons or _Satellits_ of _Jupiter_ upon his Diske,\r\nwhen they happen to be between the Sun and Him; after he had also\r\ndistinguished their Bodies _upon_ the Diske of _Jupiter_; made the last\r\nyear some Prædictions for the Months of _August_ and _September_, noting\r\nthe dayes and hours, when the Bodies of the said _satellits_ and their\r\n_Shadows_ should appear upon _Jupiter_, to the end that the Curious might\r\nbe convinced of this matter by their own Observations.\r\n\r\nSome of these Prædictions have been verified not only at _Rome_, and in\r\nother places of _Italy_, but also at _Paris_ by M. _Auzout_, the most\r\nCelebrated and the most Exact of our _Astronomers_; and in _Holland_, by M.\r\n_Hugens_. And we can now doubt no longer, of the rotation of the\r\n_Satellits_ about _Jupiter_, as the Moon turns about the Earth; nor\r\nbelieve, that _Jupiter_ or his _Attendants_ have any other Light, than\r\nthat, which they receive from the Sun; as some did {172} assure before\r\nthese Observations. There remained to find by Experience, whether _Jupiter_\r\ndid turn about his _Axis_, as many believe, that the _Earth_ turns about\r\nher's. And although most _Astronomers_ had conjectur'd, it did so, either\r\nby this Analogy, or by other Congruities, yet it was much wish'd, that we\r\nmight be assured thereof by Observations. And this it is, for which we are\r\nobliged to M. _Cassini_, who, having by the advantage of the same Glasses\r\ndiscover'd several changes, as well in the three obscure _Belts_, commonly\r\nseen in _Jupiter_, as in the rest of his _Diske_, and having also observed\r\nSpots in the midst of that _Planet_, and sometimes _Brightnesses_, such as\r\nhave bin formerly seen in the _Sun_, hath at length discover'd a _Permanent\r\nSpot_ in the _Northern_ part of the most _Southern_ Belt; by the means\r\nwhereof, he hath concluded, that _Jupiter_ turns about his _Axis_ in 9.\r\nhours, 56. minutes, and makes 29. whole circumvolutions in 12 dayes 4.\r\nminutes of ours, and 360 in 149. dayes. For he has found, that this _Spot_\r\nwas not caused by the Shadow of any _Satellit_, as well by reason of its\r\nSituation, as because it appeared, when there could be no Shadow. Besides,\r\nthat its motion differed from that of the Shadows, which is almost equal,\r\nas well towards the Edges as towards the Middle of _Jupiter_: Whereas, on\r\nthe contrary, this _Spot_ hath all the accidents, that must happen to a\r\nthing, which is upon the surface of a round Body moving; for example, to\r\nmove much more slowly towards the Edges, than towards the Middle, and to\r\npass over that part, which is in the middle of the Diske, equal to the half\r\nof the _Diameter_, in the sixth part of the time, it takes to make the\r\nwhole revolution: he having seen this half pass'd over, in 99 or 100\r\nminutes just, as it must happen, supposing the whole circumrotation is made\r\nin 9. hours 56. minutes.\r\n\r\nHe hath not yet been able to determine the Situation of the _Axis_, upon\r\nwhich this motion is made, because the _Belts_, according to which it is\r\nmade, have for some years appeared streight, though in the precedent years,\r\nother _Astronomers_ have seen them a little crooked: Which sheweth, that\r\nthe _Axis_ of the diurnal motion of _Jupiter_ is a little inclined to the\r\nplain of the _Ecliptick_. But in time we may discover, what certainty there\r\nis in this matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _These _Tables_ are not yet sent over, but, 'tis hoped, will be,\r\nere long._]\r\n\r\nAfter this excellent Discovery, he hath calculated many _Tables_, whereof\r\nhe gives the Explication and Use in the Letters by him addressed to the\r\nAbbot _Falconieri_. By the means of them, one may know, _when_ this _Spot_\r\nmay be seen by us. For, having first {173} considered it in relation to the\r\n_Sun_, in respect whereof, its motion is regular, he considers the same in\r\nrelation to the _Earth_, where _We_ observe it; and shews by the means of\r\nhis _Tables_, what is to be added or subtracted, to know, at what time the\r\nsaid _Spot_ is to come into the middle of _Jupiter_'s Diske, according as\r\nhe is Oriental or Occidental. He hath also considered it in relation to an\r\nunmovable point, which he has supposed to be the first point of _Aries_,\r\nbecause we thither refer here upon Earth the beginning of all the Celestial\r\nmotions, and _there_ is the _Primum mobile_, that one would imagine, if we\r\nwere in _Jupiter_, as we do here imagine Ours of 24. hours.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery is one of the best, that have been yet made in the Heavens;\r\nand those, that hold the Motion of the earth, find in it a full Analogy.\r\nFor, _Jupiter_ turning about the Sun, does nevertheless turn about his\r\n_Axis_; and although he be much bigger than the Earth, he does nevertheless\r\nturn much more swiftly than it, since he makes more than two Turns, and a\r\nthird part, for its one; and carries with him 4. Moons, as the Earth does\r\none.\r\n\r\nThis Observation ought to excite all Curious persons to endeavour the\r\nperfecting of _Optick Glasses_, to the end that it may be discovered,\r\nwhether the other _Planets_, as _Mars_, _Venus_ and _Mercury_, about whom\r\nno Moon hath as yet been discovered, do yet turn about their _Axes_, and in\r\nhow much time they do so; especially _Mars_, in whom some _Spot_ is\r\ndiscover'd, and _Venus_, wherein M._Burattini_ hath signified from\r\n_Poland_, he has observ'd Inequalities, as in the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt will be worth while, to watch for the seeing of _Jupiter_ again this\r\nSpring, that this happy Observation may be confirmed in divers places, and\r\nendeavours used to make new ones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of some Books, lately published._\r\n\r\nI. _Hydrostatical Paradoxes, made out by New Experiments (for the most part\r\nPhysical, and Easie) by the Honourable Robert Boyle._ This Treatise,\r\npromised in _Numb._ 8. of these Papers, is now come forth: And was\r\noccasioned by the perusal of the Learned Monsieur _Paschalls_ Tract, _Of\r\nthe Æquilibrium of Liquors_, and of the _Weight of the Air_: Of which two\r\nSubjects, the _latter_ having been more clearly made out in _England_ by\r\nExperiments, which could not be made by Monsieur _Paschal_ and others, that\r\nwanted the advantage of such Engines and Instruments, as have here been\r\nfrequently made use {174} off; Our Noble Author insists most upon giving us\r\nhis thoughts of the former, _videl._ the _Æquilibrium of Liquors_: Which\r\nDiscourse consisting partly of _Conclusions_, and partly of _Experiments_,\r\nthe _former_ seem to Him to be almost all of them consonant to the\r\nPrinciples and Laws of the _Hydrostaticks_; but as for the _latter_, the\r\nExperimental proofs, offered by M. _Paschall_ for his Opinions, are by our\r\nAuthor esteemed such, that he confesses, he hath no mind to make use of\r\nthem: for which he alledges more reasons than one; which, doubtless, will\r\nappear very satisfactory to Intelligent _Readers_.\r\n\r\nWherefore, instead of the those _Paschalian_ Experiments, there is in this\r\n_Treatise_ deliver'd a far more Expeditious way, to make out, _not only_\r\nmost of the _Conclusions_, agreed on these two Authors, _but_ others also,\r\nthat M _Paschall_ mentions not: and that with so much more ease and\r\nclearness, that persons, but ordinarily versed in the common principles of\r\n_Hydrostaticks_, may readily apprehend, what is deliver'd, if they will but\r\nbring with them a due Attention, and Minds disposed to prefer Reason and\r\nExperience to Vulgar opinions and Authors.\r\n\r\nIt not being our _Authors_ present Task, to deliver a Body of\r\n_Hydrostaticks_, but only some _Paradoxes_, which he conceives to be\r\nproveable by his New way of making them out, he delivers them in as many\r\ndistinct Propositions; after each of which, he endeavours, in a Proof, or\r\nan Explication, to show, both that it is true, and why it ought to be so.\r\n\r\nThe _Paradoxes_ themselves (after a premised _Postulatum_) are these:\r\n\r\n1. That in Water, and other Fluids, the Lower parts are pressed by the\r\nUpper.\r\n\r\n2. That a lighter Fluid may gravitate or weigh upon a heavier.\r\n\r\n3. That, if a Body, contiguous to the Water, be altogether, or in part,\r\nlower than the highest level of the said Water, the lower part of the Body\r\nwill be pressed upward by the Water, that touches it beneath.\r\n\r\n4. That in the Ascension of Water in Pumps, &c. there needs nothing to\r\nraise the Water, but a Competent weight of an External Fluid.\r\n\r\n5. That the pressure of an External Fluid is able to keep an Heterogeneous\r\nLiquor suspended at the same height in several Pipes, though these Pipes be\r\nof very different Diameters.\r\n\r\n{175}\r\n\r\n6. If a Body be placed under Water, with its uppermost Surface parallel to\r\nthe Horizon; how much Water soever there may be on this or that side above\r\nthe Body, the direct pressure susteined by the Body (for we now consider\r\nnot the Lateral nor the Recoyling pressure, to which the Body may be\r\nexposed, if quite environed with Water) is no more, than that of a Column\r\nof water, having Horizontal Superficies of the Body for its Basis, and the\r\nPerpendicular depth of the Water for its height.\r\n\r\n    And so likewise,\r\n\r\nIf the Water, that leans upon the Body, be contained in Pipes open at both\r\nends, the pressure of the Water is to be estimated by the weight of a\r\npillar of Water, whose Basis is equal to the lower Orifice of the Pipe\r\n(which we suppose to be parallel to the Horizon) and its height equal to a\r\nperpendicular, reaching thence to the top of the Water; though the Pipe be\r\nmuch inclined towards the Horizon, or though it be irregularly shap'd, and\r\nmuch broader in some parts, than the said Orifice.\r\n\r\n7. That a Body, immersed in a Fluid, sustains a Lateral pressure from the\r\nFluid; and that increased, as the depth of the immersed Body, beneath the\r\nSurface of the Fluid, increaseth.\r\n\r\n8. That Water may be made as well to depress a Body lighter than it self,\r\nas to buoy it up.\r\n\r\n9. That, whatever is said of Positive Levity, a parcel of Oyl lighter than\r\nWater, may be kept in Water without ascending in it.\r\n\r\n10. That the cause of the Ascension of Water in Syphons, and of its flowing\r\nthrough them, may be explicated without having a recourse to Nature's\r\nabhorrency of a _Vacuum_.\r\n\r\n11. That a Solid Body, as ponderous as any yet known, though near the Top\r\nof the water it will sink by its own weight; yet if it be placed at a\r\ngreater depth, than that of twenty times its own thickness; it will not\r\nsink, if its descent be not assisted by the weight of the incumbent Water.\r\n\r\nThese are the _Paradoxes_, evinced by our Authour with much evidence and\r\nexactness, and very likely to invite Ingenious men to cultivate and to make\r\nfurther disquisitions in so excellent a part of Philosophy, as are the\r\n_Hydrostaticks_; and Art deserving great _Elogiums_, not only, upon the\r\naccount of the _Theorems_ and _Problems_, which are most of them pure and\r\nhandsome productions of Reason, very delightful and divers of them\r\nsurprising, and besides, much conducing to the clear explication and {176}\r\nthorow-understanding of many both familiar and abstruse _Phænomena_ of\r\nNature; but also, upon the score of its _Practical_ use, since the\r\nPropositions, it teaches, may be of great importance to Navigation, and to\r\nthose that inquire into the Magnitudes and Gravities of Bodies, as also to\r\nthem, that deal in Salt-works: Besides, that the _Hydrostaticks_ may be\r\nmade divers waies serviceable to _Chymists_, as the Author intimates, and\r\nintends to make manifest, upon several occasions, in his yet unpublisht\r\npart of the _Usefulness of Natural and Experimental Philosophy_.\r\n\r\nThese Propositions are shut up by two important _Appendixes_, whereof the\r\n_one_ contains an Answer to seven Objections by a late learned Writer, to\r\nevince, that the upper parts of water press not upon the lower; the\r\n_other_, solves that difficult _problem_, why _Urinators_ or _Divers_, and\r\nothers, who descend to the bottom of the Sea, are not oppressed with the\r\nweight of the incumbent water? where, among other solutions, _that_ is\r\nexamined, which occurs in a printed Letter of Monsieur _des Cartes_, but is\r\nfound unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nII. _Nicolai Stenonis de Musculis & Glandulis Observationum Specimen; cum\r\nduabus Epistolis Anatomicis_. In the _Specimen_ it self, the Author, having\r\ndescribed in _general_, both the _Structure_ and the _Function_ of the\r\n_Muscles_, applies that description to the _Heart_, to demonstrate that\r\n_that_ is also a _true Muscle_: Observing _first_, that in the substance of\r\nthe _Heart_ there appears nothing but _Arteries, Veins, Nerves, Fibres,\r\nMembrans_; and that that, & nothing else is found in a _Muscle_; affirming\r\nwithall, that which is commonly taught of the _Muscles_, and particularly\r\nof the _Heart's Parenchyma_, as distinct from _Fibres_, is due, not to the\r\n_Senses_, but the _Wit_ of _Anatomists_: so that he will not have the\r\n_Heart_ made up of a substance peculiar to it self, nor considered as the\r\nprinciple of _Innate heat_, or of _Sanguification_, or of _vital spirits_.\r\nHe observes _next_, that the _Heart_ performs the like _operation_ with the\r\n_Muscles_, to wit, to contract the Flesh; which action how it can have a\r\ndifferent cause from that of the Contraction made in the _Muscles_, where\r\nthere is so great a parity and agreement in the _Vessels_, he sees not. And\r\nas for the _Phænomena_, that occur, of the _Motion_ of the Heart, he\r\nundertakes to explicate them all, from the _Ductus_ or _Position_ of the\r\n_Fibres_; but refers for the performance of this undertaking to another\r\n_Treatise_, he intends to publish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: __Conglobate_ Glanduls are called those, that do consist, as it\r\nwere, of one continued substance, having an _even_ superficies; whereof\r\nthere are many in the _Mesentery_, and in other places: contra distinguisht\r\nto those, that bear the name of _Conglomerate_ Glanduls, which are made up\r\nof several small Kernels, such as the _Pancreas_, the _Salivating\r\nGlanduls_, &c._]\r\n\r\nAs to his Observations about _Glanduls_, he affirms, that he has been the\r\nFirst, that has discover'd that Vessel, which by him is call'd {177}\r\n_Salivare Exterius_, passing from the _Parotides_ (or the two chief\r\nArteries that are on the right and left side neer the Throat) into the\r\nMouth, and conveying the _Spittle_: Where he also gives an account of\r\nseveral other Vessels and Glanduls, some about the _Lips_; others under the\r\n_Tongue_; others in the _Pallate_ &c. To which he adds the Vessels of the\r\n_Eye-lids_, which have their root in the _Glanduls_ that are about the\r\nEyes, and serve for the _shedding of Tears_. He mentions also several\r\nthings about the _Lymphatick vessels_, and is of opinion, that the\r\nknowledge thereof may be much illustrated by that kind of _Glanduls_ that\r\nare called _Conglobatæ_, and by their _true_ insertion into the veins; the\r\nmistake of the latter whereof, he conceives to have very much misled the\r\nNoble _Ludovicus de Bills_, notwithstanding his excellent method of\r\n_dissection_. And here he observes _first_, that all the _Lymphatick\r\nvessels_ have such a commerce with the _Glanduls_, that none of them is\r\nfound in the body, which either has not its origine _from_, or is inserted\r\n_into_ a _Glandule_: And _then_, that _Glanduls_ are a kind of _Strainers_,\r\nso form'd, that whilst the Blood passes out of the Arteries into the Veins\r\nthrough the small _Capillary_ vessels, the _Serous_ parts thereof, being\r\nfreed from the _Sanguineous_, are by vertue of the beat expell'd through\r\nfit pores into the _Capilaries_ of the _Lymphaticks_, the direction of the\r\n_Nerves_ concurring.\r\n\r\nOf the two annex'd _Epistles_, the _First_ gives an account of the\r\ndissection of two _Raja's_ or _Skates_, and relates that the Author found\r\nin the bellies of these Fishes a _Haddock_ of 1½ span long, and a _Sole_, a\r\n_Plaise_, and nine middle-sized _Sea crafishes_; whereof not only the three\r\nformer had their flesh, in the fishes stomack, turn'd into a _fluid_, and\r\nthe Gristles or Bones into a _soft_ substance, but the _Crafishes_ had\r\ntheir shels comminuted into very small particles, tinging here and there\r\nthe _Chyle_ near the _Pylorus_; which he judges to be done not so much by\r\nthe heat of the Fishes stomack, as by the help of some digesting juyce.\r\nComing to the _Uterus_ of these Fishes, he takes occasion to examine, with\r\nwhat ground several famous _Naturalists_ and _Anatomists_ have affirm'd,\r\nthat Eggs are the _uterus_ exposed or ejected out of the body of the\r\nAnimal. Taking a view of their _Heart_, he there finds but _one_ ventricle,\r\nand discourses of the difficulty arising from thence. As for the _Lungs_,\r\nhe saw no clearer footsteps of them in these, than he had done in other\r\nFishes: but within the mouth he trac'd several _gaping fissures_, and found\r\nthe recesses of the _Gills_ so form'd, that the water taken in at the\r\nmouth, being let out by these dores, cannot by them re-enter, by reason of\r\na skin outwardly passing over every hole, and covering it. Where he\r\nintimates, that though Fishes have not _true_ Lungs, yet they want not a\r\n_Succedaneum_ thereto, to wit, the _Gills_; and if _water_ may be to\r\nFishes, what _Air_ is to terrestrial Animals, for Respiration: affecting,\r\nthat whereas nothing is so necessary for the conservation of Animal life as\r\na reciprocal Access and Recess of the _Ambient_ to the sanguineous vessels,\r\ntis all one, whether that be done by receiving the Ambient _within_ the\r\nbody, or by its gentle passing _by_ the _Prominent_ vessels of the _Gills_.\r\n\r\nThe other _Epistle_, contains some Ingenious Observations, touching the\r\nway, by which the Chicken, yet in the shell, is nourish't, _videl._ not by\r\nthe conveyance of the _Yolk_ into the _Liver_ by the _Umbilical_ vessels,\r\nnor into the _Stomack_ by the {178} _Mouth_, but by a Peculiar _ductus_, by\r\nhim described, into the _Intestins_, where, according to his alledged\r\nexperience, it is turn'd into _Chyle_: which he affirms, he hath\r\ndiscover'd, by taking an Egge from under a brooding Hen, when the Chicken\r\nwas ready to break forth, and when he was looking for the passage of the\r\n_Yolk_, out of its integument into the _Liver_, by finding it pass thence\r\ninto the _Intestins_, as he found the _White_ to do by the _mouth_ into the\r\n_belly_. Whence he inclines to infer, that, since every _fætus_ takes in at\r\nthe mouth the liquor it swims in, and since the Chicken receives the\r\n_white_ of the Egge into the _mouth_, and the _yolk_ by the new discover'd\r\n_ductus_ into the _Intestins_, it cannot be certainly made out, that a\r\n_part_ of the _Chyle_ is conveyed into the _Liver_, before it passes into\r\nthe _Heart_; Exhorting in the mean time the _Patrons_ of the _Liver_, that\r\nthey would produce Experiments to evince their Ratiocinations.\r\n\r\nIII. _Regneri de Graeff, de Succi Pancreatici Natura & usu, Exercitatio\r\nAnatomico-medica._ In this Tract, the Industrious Author, after he has\r\nenumerated the various opinions of _Anatomists_ concerning the use of that\r\nkernelly substance; call'd _Pancreas_ (in _English_, the _Sweetbred_)\r\nendeavours to prove experimentally that this _Glandule_ was not form'd by\r\nNature, to separate any _Excrementitious_ humor, and to convey it into the\r\n_Intestins_, but to prepare an _useful_ juyce out of the Blood and Animal\r\nSpirits, of a somewhat _Acid_ taste, and to carry the same into the Gut,\r\ncall'd _Duodenum_, to be there mixt with the Aliment, that has been in some\r\ndegree already fermented in the Stomack, for a further fermentation, to be\r\nproduced by the conflux of the said acid _Pancreatick_ juyce and some\r\n_Bilious_ matter, abounding with volatile Salt, causing an Effervescence;\r\nwhich done, that juyce is, together with the purer part of the nourishment,\r\ncarried into the _Milkie_ veins, thence into the _common receptacle_ of the\r\n_Chyle_ and _Lymphatick liquor_, and so through the _ductus Thoracicus_\r\ninto the right Ventricle of the Heart.\r\n\r\nThis Assertion, first advanced (saith the _Author_) partly by _Gothofredus\r\nMobius_, partly by _Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius_, he undertakes to prove\r\nby experiments; which, indeed, he has with much industry, tried upon\r\nseveral Animals, to the end that he might collect some of this juyce of the\r\n_Pancreas_ for a taste: which having at last obtained, and found it\r\nsomewhat _acid_, he thereupon proceeds to deliver his opinion both of the\r\n_constitution_ and quantity of this _Succus_ in _healthy_ Animals, and the\r\nvices thereof, in the _unhealthy_: deriving most diseases _partly_ from its\r\ntoo great Acidity, or from its saltness, or harshness; _partly_ from its\r\npaucity or redundancy: but especially, endeavouring to reduce from thence,\r\nas all _intermittent Feavers_ (of all the _Phænomena_ whereof he ventures\r\nto assign the causes from this _Hypothesis_) so also the _Gout, Syncope's,\r\nStranguries, Oppilations, Diarrhæas, Dysenteries, Hysterical_ and _Colick\r\npassions_, &c. All which he concludes with mentioning the waies and\r\nremedies to cure the manifold peccancy of this juyce by Evacuations and\r\nAlterations.\r\n\r\nThis seeming to be a _new_ as well as a _considerable_ discovery, it is\r\nhop'd, that others will by this intimation be invited to prosecute the same\r\nby further experiments, either to confirm what this Author has started, if\r\ntrue, or to rectifie it, if he be mistaken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOTE._\r\n\r\nIn _Fig._ 1. of _Num._ 9 of these Tracts the Graver hath placed the bended\r\n_end_ of the _Springing Wire_ C F, above the _Wire-staple_ B, between it\r\nand the _Ring_ E, of the _Weight_ D; whereas _that_ end should have been so\r\nexpressed, as to pass _under_ the _Wire-staple_, betwixt its two Wires,\r\ninto the said _Ring_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to the\r\nRoyal Society. 1666.\r\n\r\n{179}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 11.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _April._ 2. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _A Confirmation of the former Account, touching the late _Earth-quake_\r\n    near _Oxford_, and the Concomitants thereof, by Mr. _Boyle_.

Phil. Transactions p. 166-171; _at the time of\r\nthe printing whereof, this Relation of Mr._ Boyle _was not yet come to\r\nhand._]\r\n\r\nAs to the _Earth-quake_, your curiosity about it makes me sorry, that,\r\nthough I think, I was the first, that gave notice of it to several of the\r\n_Virtuosi_ at _Oxford_; yet the Account, that I can send you about it, is\r\nnot so much of the _Thing_ it self, {180} as of the _Changes of the Air_,\r\nthat accompanied it. To inform you of which, I must relate to you, that\r\nriding one Evening somewhat late betwixt _Oxford_ & a Lodging, I have at a\r\nplace, 4 miles distant from it, the weather having been for a pretty while\r\nFrosty, I found the Wind so very cold, that it reduced me to put on some\r\ndefensives against it, which I never since, nor, if I forget not, all the\r\nforegoing part of the Winter was obliged to make use off. My unwillingness\r\nto stay long in so troublesome a Cold, which continued very piercing, till\r\nI had got half way home-ward, did put me upon galloping at no very lasy\r\nrate; and yet, before I could get to my Lodgings, I found the Wind turned,\r\nand felt the Rain falling; which, considering the shortness of the time,\r\nand that this Accident was preceded by a setled Frost, was surprising to\r\nme, and induced me to mention it at my return, as one of the greatest and\r\nsuddainest Alterations of Air, I have ever observ'd: And what changes I\r\nfound, have been taken notice of in the _Gravity_ of the _Atmosphere_ at\r\nthe same time by that Accurate Observer * Dr. _Wallis_, who then suspected\r\nnothing of what follow'd; as I suppose, he has ere this told you himself.\r\nSoon after, by my guess about an hour, there was a manifest _Trembling_ in\r\nthe House where I was (which stands high in comparison of _Oxford_.) But it\r\nwas not there so great, but that I, who chanced to have my thoughts busied\r\nenough on other matters, than the weather, should not have taken notice of\r\nit as an _Earth-quake_, but have imputed it to some other cause, if one,\r\nthat you know, whose hand is employed in this Paper, and begins to be a\r\ndiligent observer of Natural things, had not advertis'd me of it; as being\r\ntaken notice of by him and the rest of the people of the House. And soon\r\nafter there hapned a brisk Storm: whereupon I sent to make inquiry at a\r\nplace call'd _Brill_, which standing upon a much higher ground, I supposed\r\nmight be more obnoxious to the effects of the _Earth-quake_ (of which, had\r\nI had any suspition of it, my having formerly been in one neer the _Lacus\r\nLemanus_, would have made me the more observant:) But the person I sent to,\r\nbeing {181} disabled by sickness to come over to me (which he promis'd to\r\ndo, as soon as he could) writ me only a _Ticket_, whose substance was, That\r\nthe _Earth-quake_ was there much more considerable, than where I lodged,\r\nand that at a Gentlemans house, whom he names (the most noted Person, it\r\nseems, of the neighbourhood) the House trembled very much, so as to make\r\nthe Stones manifestly to move to and fro in the Parlour, to the great\r\namazement and fright of all the Family. The Hill, whereon this _Brill_\r\nstands, I have observ'd to be very well stor'd with Mineral substances of\r\nseveral kinds; and from thence I have been inform'd by others, that this\r\nEarth-quake reach'd a good many miles; but I have neither leasure, nor\r\ninclination to entertain you with uncertain reports of the Extent and other\r\nCircumstances, especially since a little further time an inquiry may enable\r\nme to give you a better warranted account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations and Directions about the _Barometer_, communicated by\r\nthe same Hand, to the _Author_ of this _Tract_._\r\n\r\nThese shall be set down, as they came to hand in another Letter; _videl._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _See _Num. 9_. of the _Phil. Transact_. p. 159 the last\r\n_paragraph_._]\r\n\r\nAs to the _Barometrical_ Observations (as for brevities sake I use to call\r\nthem) though you * guessed aright, that, when I saw those of the Learned\r\nand Inquisitive Dr. _Beale_, I had not Mine by me, (for I left them, some\r\nyears since, in the hands of a _Virtuoso_, nor have I now the leasure to\r\nlook after those Papers;) yet since by the Communication, you have made\r\npublick, 'tis probable, that divers Ingenious men will be invited to\r\nattempt the like Observations, I shall (notwithstanding my present haste)\r\nmention to you some particulars, which perhaps will not appear\r\nunseasonable, that came into my mind upon the reading of what you have\r\npresented the Curious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _Some whereof have been since invited by the _Publisher_, to\r\ngive their concurrence herein_.]\r\n\r\nWhen I did, as you may remember, some years agoe, publickly express and\r\ndesire that some Inquisitive men would {182} make _Baroscopical_\r\nObservations in several parts of _England_ (if not in forrain Countries *\r\nalso;) and to assist them, to do so, presented some of my Friends with the\r\nnecessary Instruments: The declared reason of my desiring this\r\nCorrespondence was (among other things) that by comparing Notes, _the\r\nExtent of the Atmospherical Changes, in point of Weight, might be the\r\nbetter estimated_. But not having hitherto received some account, that I\r\nhoped for, I shall now, without staying for them, intimate thus much to\r\nyou: That it will be very convenient, that the Observers take notice not\r\nonly of the _day_, but as near as they can, of the _Houre_ wherein the\r\nheight of the _Mercurial Cylinder_ is observ'd: For I have often found,\r\nthat within less than the compass of one day, or perhaps half a day, the\r\nAltitude of it has so considerably vary'd, as to make it in many cases\r\ndifficult, to conclude any thing certainly from Observations, that agree\r\nbut in the day.\r\n\r\nIt will be requisite also, that the Observers give notice of the\r\n_Scituation of the place_, where their _Barometers_ stand, not only,\r\nbecause it will assist men to Judge, whether the Instruments were duely\r\nperfected, but principally, because, that though the _Baroscope_ be good\r\n(nay, because it is so) the Observations will much disagree, even when the\r\n_Atmosphere_ is in the same state, as to Weight, if one of the Instruments\r\nstand in a considerably higher part of the Countrey, than the other.\r\n\r\nTo confirm _both_ the foregoing admonitions, I must now inform you, that,\r\nhaving in these parts two Lodgings, the one at _Oxford_, which you know\r\nstands in a bottom by the _Thames_ side, and the other at a place four\r\nmiles thence, seated upon a moderate _Hill_, I found, by comparing two\r\n_Baroscopes_, that I made, the one at _Oxford_, the other at _Stanton St.\r\nJohns_, that, though the former be very good, and have been noted for such,\r\nduring some years, and the latter was very carefully fill'd; yet by reason,\r\nthat in the _Higher_ place, the incumbent part of the _Atmosphere_ must be\r\nlighter, than in the _Lower_, there is almost {183} always between 2 and 3\r\nEights of an Inch difference betwixt them: And having sometimes order'd my\r\nservants to take notice of the Disparity, and divers times carefully\r\nobserv'd it my self, when I pass'd to and fro between _Oxford_ and\r\n_Stanton_, I generally found, that the _Oxford Barometer_ and the _other_,\r\ndid, as it were by common consent, rise and fall together so, as that in\r\nthe former the _Mercury_ was usually 3/8 higher, than in the latter.\r\n\r\nWhich Observations may teach us, that the Subterraneous steams, which\r\nascend into the Air, or the other Causes of the varying Weight of the\r\n_Atmosphere_, do, many times, and at least in some places, uniformly enough\r\naffect the Air to a greater height, than, till I had made this tryall, I\r\ndurst conclude.\r\n\r\nBut, as most of the _Barometricall_ observations are subject to exception,\r\nso I found the formerly mentioned to be. For (to omit lesser variations)\r\nriding one evening from _Oxford_ to _Stanton_, and having, before I took\r\nhorse, look't on the _Baroscope_ in the former of these 2. places, I was\r\nsomewhat surprised, to find at my comming to the latter, that in places no\r\nfarther distant, and notwithstanding the shortness of the time (which was\r\nbut an hour and a half, if so much) the _Barometer_ at _Stanton_ was short\r\nof its usual distance from the _other_, near a quarter of an _Inch_,\r\nthough, the weather being fair and calm, there appear'd nothing of manifest\r\nchange in the Air, to which I could adscribe so great a Variation; and\r\nthough also, since that time, the _Mercury_ in the two Instruments hath,\r\nfor the most part, proceeded to rise and fall as before.\r\n\r\nAnd these being the only Observations, I have yet met with, wherein\r\n_Baroscopes_, at some _Distance of Place_, and _Difference of Height_, have\r\nbeen compar'd (though I cannot now send you the Reflexions, I have else\r\nwhere made upon them;) as the opportunity I had to make them my self,\r\nrendred them not unpleasant to me, so perhaps the Novelty will keep them\r\nfrom being unwelcome to you. And I confess, I have had some flying\r\nsuspicions, that the odd _Phænomena_ of the _Baroscope_, which have\r\nhitherto more pos'd, than instructed us, may in time, if a {184} competent\r\nnumber of Correspondents do diligently prosecute the Inquiries (especially\r\nwith _Baroscopes_, accommodated with Mr. _Hooks_ ingenious additions) make\r\nmen some _Luciferous_ discoveries, that possibly we do not yet dream off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _This hath been inquired into, and is found, that several\r\nAccurate and Curious persons (as the Most Noble _President of the Royal\r\nSociety_, the Lord Viscount _Brounker_, _Doctor Beale_, _Mr. Hook_ _&c._)\r\nhave observed the same._]\r\n\r\nI know not, whether it will be worth while to add, that since I was oblig'd\r\nto leave _London_, I have been put upon so many lesser removes, that I have\r\nnot been able to make _Baroscopical_ Observations with such a constancy, as\r\nI have wished, but, as far as I remember, the _Quick-silver_ has been for\r\nthe most part, so high, as to invite me to take notice of it; and to desire\r\nyou to do me the favour to inquire among your correspondents whether they\r\nhave observ'd the same thing. * For, if they have, this lasting (though not\r\nuninterrupted) Altitude of the _Quick-silver_, happening, when the Seasons\r\nof the year have been extraordinary dry (so much as to become a grievance,\r\nand to dry up, as one of the late _Gazettes_ informs us, some springs near\r\n_Waymouth_, that used to run constantly) it may be worth inquiry, whether\r\nthese obstinate Droughts, may not be cleaving of the ground too deep, and\r\nmaking it also in some places more porous and as it were, spungy, give a\r\nmore copious Vent, than is usual, to subterraneal steams, which adscending\r\ninto the Air, increase the gravity of it. The inducements I have to propose\r\nthis inquiry, I must not now stay to mention. But perhaps, if the\r\nObservation holds, it may prove not useless in reference to some Diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _See Number 9. _Phil. Transact._ p. 157. 5. 8 & 9. where the\r\nWord, _Generally_, signifies no more, than _for the most part_._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be needless to put you in mind of directing those\r\n_Virtuosi_, that may desire your Instructions about _Baroscopes_, to set\r\ndown in their Diarys not only the day of the month, and the hour of the\r\nday, when the _Mercuries_ height is taken, but (in a distinct _Columne_)\r\nthe weather, especially the Winds, both as to the Quarters, whence they\r\nblow (though that be not always so easy nor necessary,) and as to the\r\nViolence or Remisness, wherewith they blow. For, though it be more\r\ndifficult, {185} than one would think, to settle any general rule about the\r\nrising and falling of the _Quick-silver_; yet in these parts one of those,\r\nthat seem to hold oftnest, is, * that when high winds blow, the _Mercury_\r\nis the lower; and yet that it self does sometimes fail: For, this very day\r\n(_March_ 3.) though on that hill, where I am, the somewhat Westerly Winds\r\nhave been blustering enough, yet ever since morning the _Quick-silver_ has\r\nbeen rising, and is now risen near 3/8 of an _Inch_.\r\n\r\nI had thoughts to add something about another kind of _Baroscope_ (but\r\ninferiour to that in use) whereof I have given some intimation in one of\r\nthe _Præliminaries_ to the _History of Cold_. But you have already too much\r\nof a letter, and my occasions, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _Dr. _Beale_ concurs with this Observation, when he saith, in\r\na late _Letter_ of _March 19_. to his Correspondent in _London_;_ By change\r\nof Weather and Wind, the _Mercury_ is sunk more than an Inch, since I wrote\r\nto you on _Munday_ last. _March_ 12. This last night, by Rain and South\r\nwind, 'tis sunk _half an Inch_.]\r\n\r\n_So far that Letter._ Since which time, another from the same Noble\r\nObserver intimates, That, as for that cause of the height of the\r\n_Quick-silver_ in Droughts, which by him is suspected to be the elevation\r\nof steams from the _Crust_ or Superficial parts of the Earth, which by\r\nlittle and little may add to the Weight of the _Atmosphere_, being not, as\r\nin other seasons, carried down from time to time by the falling Rain, it\r\nagrees not ill with what he has had since occasion to observe. For, whereas\r\nabout _March_ 12^{th}, at _Oxford_, The _Quick-silver_ was higher, than,\r\nfor ought he knew, had been yet observ'd in _England_, viz. above 5/16\r\nabove 30. _Inches_, upon the first considerable showers, that have\r\ninterrupted our long Drought, as he affirms, he foretold divers hours\r\nbefore that the _Quick-silver_ would be very low, (a blustering Wind\r\nconcurring with the Rain) so he found it at _Stanton_ to fall 3/8 beneath\r\n29. _Inches_.*\r\n\r\n{186}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_General Heads for a _Natural History of a Countrey_, Great or Small,\r\nimparted likewise by Mr. _Boyle_._\r\n\r\nIt having been already intimated (_Num. 8 of Phil. Transact._ p. 140. 141.)\r\nthat divers _Philosophers_ aime, among other things, at the Composing of a\r\ngood Natural History, to superstruct, in time, a _Solid_ and _Useful_\r\nPhilosophy upon; and it being of no slight importance, to be furnisht with\r\npertinent Heads, for the direction of Inquirers; that lately named\r\n_Benefactour to Experimental Philosophy_, has been pleased to communicate,\r\nfor the ends abovesaid, the following _Articles_, which (as himself did\r\nsignifie) belong to one of his _Essays_ of the unpublisht part of the\r\n_Usefulness of Nat. and Experimen. Philosophy_.\r\n\r\nBut first he premises, that what follows, is design'd only to point at the\r\nmore _General_ heads of Inquiry, which the proposer ignores not to be\r\nDivers of them very comprehensive, in so much, that about some of the\r\n_Subordinate_ subjects, perhaps too, not the most fertile, he has drawn up\r\n_Articles_ of inquisition about particulars, that take up near as much\r\nroom, as what is here to be deliver'd of this matter.\r\n\r\nThe _Heads_ themselves follow;\r\n\r\nThe things, to be observ'd in such a History, may be variously (and almost\r\nat pleasure) divided: As, into _Supraterraneous, Terrestrial_, and\r\n_Subterraneous_; and otherwise: but we will at present distinguish them\r\ninto those things, that respect the _Heavens_, or concern the _Air_, the\r\n_Water_, or the _Earth_.\r\n\r\n1. To the _First_ sort of Particulars, belong the Longitude and Latitude of\r\nthe Place (that being of moment in reference to the observations about the\r\nAir &c.) and consequently the length of the longest and shortest days and\r\nnights, the Climate, parallels &c. what fixt starrs are and what not seen\r\nthere: What Constellations 'tis said to be subject to? Whereunto may be\r\nadded other Astrological matters, if they be thought worth mentioning.\r\n{187}\r\n\r\n2. About the _Air_ may be observ'd, its Temperature, as to the first four\r\nQualities (commonly so call'd) and the Measures of them: its Weight,\r\nClearness, Refractive power: its Sublety or Grossness: its abounding with,\r\nor wanting an _Esurine_ Salt: its variations according to the seasons of\r\nthe year, and the times of the day; What duration the several kinds of\r\nWeather usually have: What _Meteors_ it is most or least wont to breed; and\r\nin what order they are generated; and how long they usually last:\r\nEspecially, what Winds it is subject to; whether any of them be stated and\r\nordinary, &c. What diseases are Epidemical, that are supposed to flow from\r\nthe Air: What other diseases, wherein _that_ hath a share, the Countrey is\r\nsubject to; the Plague and Contagious sicknesses: What is the usual\r\nsalubrity or insalubrity of the Air; and with what Constitutions it agrees\r\nbetter or worse, than others.\r\n\r\n3. About the _Water_, may be observ'd, the Sea, its Depth, degree of\r\nSaltness, Tydes, Currents, &c. _Next_, Rivers, their Bigness, Length,\r\nCourse, Inundations, Goodness, Levity (or their Contraries) of Waters, &c.\r\n_Then_, Lakes, Ponds, Springs, and especially Mineral waters, their Kinds,\r\nQualities, Vertues, and how examined. To the _Waters_ belong also _Fishes_,\r\nwhat kinds of them (whether Salt or Fresh-water fish) are to be found in\r\nthe Country; their Store, Bigness, Goodness, Seasons, Haunts, Peculiarities\r\nof any kind, and the wayes of taking them, especially those that are not\r\npurely _Mechanical_.\r\n\r\n4. In the _Earth_, may be observed,\r\n\r\n    1. _It self._\r\n\r\n    2. Its _Inhabitants_, and its _Productions_, and these _External_, and\r\n    _Internal_.\r\n\r\n_First_, in the Earth _it self_, may be observ'd, its dimensions,\r\nscituation, East, West, North, and South: its Figure, its Plains, and\r\nValleys, and their Extent; its Hills and Mountains, and the height of the\r\ntallest, both in reference to the neighbouring Valleys or Plains, and in\r\nreference to the Level of the Sea: As {188} also, whether the Mountains lye\r\nscattered, or in ridges, and whether those run North and South, or East and\r\nWest, &c. What Promontories, fiery or smoaking Hills, &c. the Country has,\r\nor hath not: Whether the Country be coherent, or much broken into Ilands.\r\nWhat the Magnetical Declination is in several places, and the Variations of\r\nthat Declination in the same place (and, if either of those be very\r\nconsiderable, then, what circumstances may assist one to guess at the\r\nReason as Subterraneal fires, the Vicinity of Iron-mines, &c.) what the\r\nNature of the Soyle is, whether Clays, Sandy, &c. or good Mould; and what\r\nGrains, Fruits, and other Vegetables, do the most naturally agree with it:\r\nAs also, by what particular Arts and Industries the Inhabitants improve the\r\nAdvantages, and remedy the Inconveniences of their Soyl: What hidden\r\nqualities the Soyl may have (as that of _Ireland_, against Venemous Beasts,\r\n&c.)\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, above the ignobler _Productions_ of the Earth, there must be a\r\ncareful account given of the _Inhabitants_ themselves, both _Natives_ and\r\n_Strangers_, that have been long settled there: And in particular, their\r\nStature, Shape, Colour, Features, Strength, Agility, Beauty (or the want of\r\nit) Complexions, Hair, Dyet, Inclinations, and Customs that seem not due to\r\nEducation. As to their Women (besides the other things) may be observed\r\ntheir Fruitfulness or Barrenness; their hard or easy Labour, &c. And both\r\nin Women and Men must be taken notice of what diseases they are subject to,\r\nand in these whether there be any symptome, or any other Circumstance, that\r\nis unusual and remarkable.\r\n\r\nAs to the _External_ Productions of the Earth, the Inquiries may be such as\r\nthese: What Grasses, Grains, Herbs, (Garden and Wild) Flowers, Fruit-trees,\r\nTimber-trees (especially any Trees, whose wood is considerable) Coppices,\r\nGroves, Woods, Forrests, &c. the Country has or wants: What peculiarities\r\nare observable in any of them: What Soyles they most like or dislike; and\r\nwith what Culture they thrive best. What _Animals_ the Country has or\r\nwants, both as to wild Beasts, Hawks, and other Birds of Prey; and as to\r\nPoultrey, and {189} Cattle of all sorts, and particularly, whether it have\r\nany _Animals_, that are not common, or any thing, that is peculiar in\r\nthose, that are so.\r\n\r\nThe _Internal_ Productions or Concealments of the Earth are here understood\r\nto be, the riches that ly hid under the Ground, and are not already\r\nreferr'd to other Inquiries.\r\n\r\nAmong these _Subterraneal_ observations may be taken notice of, what sorts\r\nof Minerals of any kind they want, as well as what they have; _Then_, what\r\nQuarries the Country affords, and the particular conditions both of the\r\nQuarries and the Stones: As also, how the Beds of Stone lye, in reference\r\nto North and South, &c. What Clays and Earths it affords, as\r\nTobacco-pipe-clay, Marles, Fullers-earths, Earths for Potters wares,\r\nBolus's and other medicated Earths: What other Minerals it yields, as\r\nCoals, Salt-Mines, or Salt-springs, Allom, Vitrial, Sulphur, &c. What\r\nMettals the Country yields; and a description of the Mines, their number,\r\nscituation, depth, signs, waters, damps, quantities of ore, goodness of\r\nore, extraneous things and ways of reducing their ores into Mettals, &c.\r\n\r\nTo these General Articles of inquiries (saith their _Proposer_) should be\r\nadded; 1 _Inquiries_ about _Traditions_ concerning all particular things,\r\nrelating to that Country, as either peculiar to it, or at least, uncommon\r\nelsewhere, 2 _Inquiries_, that require _Learning_ or _Skill_ in the\r\nAnswerer: to which should be subjoyned _Proposals_ of ways, to enable men\r\nto give Answers to these more difficult inquiries.\r\n\r\n_Thus far_ our Author, who, as he has been pleased to impart these\r\n_General_ (but yet very _Comprehensive_ and greatly _Directive_) Articles;\r\nso, 'tis hoped from his own late intimation, that he will shortly enlarge\r\nthem with _Particular_ and _Subordinate_ ones. These, in the mean time,\r\nwere thought fit to be publisht, that the Inquisitive and Curious, might,\r\nby such an Assistance, be invited not to delay their searches of matters,\r\nthat are so highly conducive to the improvement of _True Philosophy_, and\r\nthe wellfare of _Mankind_. {190}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Extract of a Letter, Written from _Holland_, about _Preserving of Ships\r\nfrom being Worm-eaten_._\r\n\r\nThis _Extract_ is borrowed from the _French journal des Scavans_ of _Febr._\r\n15. 1666. and is here inserted, to excite Inventive heads _here_, to\r\novertake the Proposer in _Holland_. The letter runs thus:\r\n\r\nAlthough you have visited our Port (_Amsterdam_) I know not whether you\r\nhave noted the ill condition, our ships are in, that return from the\r\n_Indies_. There is in those Seas a kind of small worms, that fasten\r\nthemselves to the Timber of the ships, and so pierce them, that they take\r\nwater every where; or if they do not altogether pierce them thorow, they so\r\nweaken the wood, that it is almost impossible to repair them. We have at\r\npresent a Man here, that pretends to have found an admirable secret to\r\nremedy this evil. That, which would render this secret the more important,\r\nis, that hitherto very many ways have been used to effect it, but without\r\nsuccess. Some have imployed Deal, Hair and Lime, &c. and therewith lined\r\ntheir ships; but, besides that this does not altogether affright the worms,\r\nit retards much the ship's Course. The _Portugals_ scorch their ships,\r\ninsomuch that in the quick works there is made a coaly crust of about an\r\n_Inch_ thick. But as this is dangerous, it happening not seldom, that the\r\nwhole vessel is burnt; so the reason why worms eat not thorow _Portugal_\r\nships, is conceived to be the exceeding hardness of the Timber, employed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe expect with impatience the nature and effect of this Proposition. Many\r\nhave already ventur'd to give their thoughts concerning it. Some say, there\r\nneeds no more, but to build Ships of a harder kind of Wood, than the usual.\r\nOthers having observed, that these Worms fasten not to a kind of wild\r\n_Indian_ Pear-tree, which is highly bitter, do thereupon {191} suggest,\r\nthat the best Expedient would be, to find out a Wood having that quality.\r\nBut certainly there being now no Timber, fit for Ships, that is not known,\r\n'tis not likely that any will be found either more hard, or more bitter,\r\nthan that, which has been hitherto employed. Some do imagine, that the\r\nProposer will, by certain _Lixiviums_, give to the ordinary Wood such a\r\nquality and bitterness, as is found in the already mention'd _Indian_\r\nPear-tree. But this also will hardly succeed, since it will be requisite\r\nnot only to make _Lixiviums_, in great quantities at an easie rate, and\r\nstrong enough to penetrate the thick sides of a Ship, but also to make them\r\ndurable enough, not to be wash't out by the Sea. Yet notwithstanding, in\r\nthese matters one ought to suspend on's judgement, untill experience do\r\nshew, what is to be believed of them.\r\n\r\n_So far the Extract._ To which it may perhaps not be unseasonable to add,\r\nthat a very worthy person in _London_, suggests the Pitch, drawn out of Sea\r\ncoles, for a good Remedy to scare away these noysome insects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of a Book, very lately publish't, entituled, _The Origine of\r\nForms and Qualities_, illustrated by Considerations and Experiments, by the\r\nHonourable _Robert Boyle_._\r\n\r\nThis Curious and Excellent Piece, is a kind of _Introduction_ to the\r\n_Principles_ of the _Mechanical Philosophy_, explicating, by very\r\nConsiderable Observations and Experiments, what may be, according to such\r\nPrinciples, conceived of the _Nature and Origine of Qualities and Forms_;\r\nthe knowledge whereof, either makes or supposes the Fundamental and Useful\r\npart of _Natural Philosophy_. In doing of which, the Author, to have his\r\nway the clearer, writes rather for the _Corpuscularian_ Philosophers (as he\r\nis pleased to call them) in _General_, than any {192} _Party_ of them,\r\nkeeping himself thereby disengaged from adopting an _Hypothesis_, in which\r\nperhaps he is not so throughly satisfied, and of which he does not conceive\r\nhimself to be necessitated to make use here; and accordingly forbearing to\r\nemploy Arguments, that are either grounded on, _or_ suppose _Atoms_, _or_\r\nany _Innate Motion_ belonging to them; _or_ that the Essence of Bodies\r\nconsists in Extension; _or_ that a _Vacuum_ is impossible; _or_ that there\r\nare such _Globuli Cælestes, or_ such a _Materia Subtilis_, as the\r\n_Cartesians_ imploy to explicate most of the _Phænomena_ of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe _Treatise_ consisting of a _Speculative_, and an _Historical_ part, the\r\nAuthor, with great modesty leaves the _Reader_ to judge; _Whether_ in the\r\n_First_ part he hath treated of the _Nature_ and _Origine of Forms and\r\nQualities_ in a more Comprehensive way, than others; _Whether_ he has by\r\nfit Examples, and other means, rendred it more intelligible, than they have\r\ndone: _Whether_ he has added any considerable number of Notions and\r\nArguments towards the compleating and confirming of the proposed\r\n_Hypothesis_: _Whether_ he has with reason dismissed Arguments unfit to be\r\nrelied on; and _Whether_ he has proposed some Notions and Arguments so\r\nwarily, as to keep them from being liable to Exceptions and Evasions,\r\nwhereto they were obnoxious, as others have proposed them. And, as to the\r\n_Second_ and _Historical_ part, he is enclin'd to believe that the _Reader_\r\nwill grant, he hath done that part of _Physicks_, he is treating of, some\r\nservice, by strengthning the doctrines of the _New Philosophy_ (as 'tis\r\ncall'd) by such particular Experiments, whose Nature and Novelty will\r\nrender them as well Acceptable as Instructive.\r\n\r\nThe _summe_ of the _Hypothesis_, fully and clearly explicated in the\r\n_First_ Part, is this;\r\n\r\nThat all Bodies are made of _one Catholick matter_, common to them all, and\r\ndiffer but in _Shape, Size, Motion_ or _Rest_, and _Texture_ of the small\r\nparts, they consist off; from which {193} Affections of Matter, the\r\n_Qualites_, that difference particular Bodies, result: whence it may be\r\nrationally concluded, that one kind of Bodies may be transmuted into\r\nanother; _that_ being in effect no more, than that one Parcel of the\r\nUniversal Matter, wherein all Bodies agree, may have a _Texture_ produced\r\nin it, like the _Texture_ of some other Parcel of Matter, common to them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nTo this _Hypothesis_, is subjoin'd an Examination of the _Scholastick_\r\nopinion of _Substantial Forms_; where the Author, _first_, States the\r\nControversie; _next_, gives the Principal reasons, that move him to oppose\r\nthat Opinion; _then_, answers the Main arguments employed to evince it;\r\n_further_, assigns both the _First_ Cause of Forms (_God_;) and the Grand\r\n_Second_ Cause thereof (_Local Motion_:) and _lastly_, proves the\r\n_Mechanical_ Production of _Forms_; grounding his proof, _partly_ upon the\r\nManner, by which such a _Convention of Accidents_, as deserve to pass for a\r\n_Form_, may be _produced_; as that the Curious Shapes of _Salts_ (believed\r\nto be the admirablest Effects and strongest Proofs of _Substantial Forms_)\r\nmay be the Results of _Texture_; _Art_ being able to produce Vitriol, as\r\nwell as _Nature_: _partly_, upon the possibility of _Reproducing_ Bodies by\r\nskill, that have been deprived of their reputed _Substantial Forms_: Where\r\nhe alledges the _Redintegration of Saltpetre_, successfully performed by\r\nhimself; though his Attempts, made upon the dissipation and re-union of\r\n_Amber_, _Allum_, _Sea-Salt_, and _Vitriol_, proved (by reason of\r\n_accidental_ hindrances rather, than of any impossibility in the Nature of\r\nthe Thing) less successful.\r\n\r\nIn the _Second_ and _Historical_ Part, the Author, appealing to the\r\nTestimony of Nature, to verifie his Doctrine, sets down, _both_ some\r\n_Observations_, of what Nature does without being over-ruled by the power\r\nand skill of man; and some _Experiments_, wherein Nature is guided, and as\r\nit were, mastered by Art.\r\n\r\nThe _Observations_ are four.\r\n\r\n1. The _First_ is taken from what happens in the _Hatching of_ {194} _an\r\nEgge_; out of the _White_ whereof, which is a substance Similar, insipid,\r\nsoft, diaphanous, colourless, and readily dissoluble in cold water, there\r\nis by the _New_ and _Various_ contrivement of its small parts, caused by\r\nthe Incubation of the Hen, an Animal produced, some of whose parts are\r\nopacous, some red, some yellow, some white, some fluid, some consistent,\r\nsome solid and frangible, others tough and flexible, some well, some\r\nill-tasted, some with springs, some without springs, &c.\r\n\r\n2. The _Second_ is fetcht from _Water_, which being fluid, tastless,\r\ninodorous, diaphanous, colourless, volatile, &c. may by a _Differing\r\nTexture_ of its parts, be brought to constitute Bodies, having qualities\r\nvery distant from these, as _Vegetables_, that have firmeness, opacity,\r\nodors, tasts, colours, Medicinal vertues; yielding also a true _Oyle_, that\r\nrefuses to mingle with _Water_, &c.\r\n\r\n3. The _Third_, from _Inoculation_; wherein, a small _Bud_ is able to\r\ntransmute all the sap, that arrives at it, as to make it constitute a Fruit\r\nquite otherwise qualified, then that, which is the _genuine_ production of\r\nthe Tree, so that the same sap, that in one part of the Branch constitutes\r\n(for Instance) a _Cluster of Haws_, in another part of the same Branch, may\r\nmake a _Pear_. Where the Author mentions divers other very considerable\r\nEffects of Inoculations, and inserts several Histories, all countenancing\r\nhis doctrine.\r\n\r\n4. The _Fourth_, from _Putrified Cheese_; wherein, the _rotten_ part, by\r\nthe alteration of its Texture, will differ from the _Sound_, in colour,\r\nodor, taste, consistence, vermination, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Experiments are ten.\r\n\r\n1. _A Solution of Vitriol and Camphire_; in which by a change of Texture,\r\nappear'd the Production of a deep colour from a {195} white Body, and a\r\nclear Liquor without any external heat: The destruction of this Colour, by\r\nadding only some fair water: The change of an Odorous Body, _as Camphire_,\r\ninto an Inodorous, by mixing it with a Body, that has scarce any sensible\r\nodour of its own: The sudden restauration of the _Camphire_ to its native\r\nscent and other qualities, by common water, &c.\r\n\r\n2. _Sublimate, distill'd from Copper and Silver_, which both did wholly\r\nloose their Metalline forms, and were melted into brittle lumps, with\r\ncolours quite differing from their own; both apt to imbibe the moisture of\r\nthe Air, &c.\r\n\r\n3. _A solution of silver into Luna Cornea_: Whereby the opacous, malleable\r\nand hardly fusible Body of _Silver_, was, by the addition of a little\r\nspirit of salt, reduced into Chrystals, differing from those of other\r\nMettals; diaphanous also, and brittle, and far more easily fusible, than\r\nSilver; wholly unlike either a Salt or a Mettal, but very like to a piece\r\nof _Horn_, and withall insipid, though the Solution of Silver, be very\r\nbitter, and the spirit of salt, highly sowre, &c.\r\n\r\n4. _An Anomalous Salt_; (which the Author had not, it seems the liberty to\r\nteach the Preparation off) whose Ingredients were purely Saline, and yet\r\nthe Compound, made up only of salt, sowre, and strongly tasted Bodies, was\r\nrather _really_ sweet, than of any other taste , and when a little urged\r\nwith heat, its odour became stronger, and more insupportable than that of\r\n_Aqua fortis_, _distilled Urine_ and even _spirit of salt Ammoniack_; but\r\nyet when these Fumes settled again into salt, their odour would again prove\r\ninoffensive, if not pleasant &c.\r\n\r\n5. _A Sea-salt, whence Aqua fortis had been distilled_: Where the Liquor,\r\nthat came over, proved an _Aqua Regis_: the substance in the bottom, had\r\nnot onely a mild taste, and {196} affected the Pallat much more like\r\nsalt-peter, than Common salt; but was also very fusible, and inflammable,\r\nthough produced of two un-inflammable bodies: and the same substance,\r\nconsisting of _Acid_ salts, by a certain way of the Author, produced a\r\n_Fixt_ salt.\r\n\r\n6. _Oyle of Vitriol poured upon a Solution of Bay-salt:_ whence was\r\nabstracted a liquor, that by the smell and Taste appeared to be a spirit of\r\nsalt. In which operation, the mixture, by working a great change of\r\nTexture, did so alter the nature of the compounding Bodies, that the\r\nsea-salt, though a considerably fixt Body, was distill'd over in a moderate\r\nFire of sand, whilst the Oyl of Vitriol, though no such gross salt, was by\r\nthe same operation so fixt, as to stay behind: Besides that the same, by a\r\ncompetent heat yeilded a substance, though not insipid, yet not at all of\r\nthe taste of Sea-salt, or of any other pungent one, much less having the\r\nhighly corrosive acidity of oyl of Vitriol, &c.\r\n\r\n7. _A dissolvent, made by pouring a strong spirit of Nitre on the rectified\r\nOyl of the Butter of Antimony, and then distilling off all the liquor, that\r\nwould come over, &c._ This _Menstruum_ (called by the Author _Peracutum_)\r\nbeing put to highly refined Gold, destroyed its Texture, and produced,\r\nafter the method prescribed in the book, a _true Silver_, as its whiteness\r\nin colour, dissolublenes in _Aqua fortis_, and odious Bitterness, did\r\nmanifest: which change of a Mettal, commonly esteemed to be absolutely\r\nindestructible by Art, though it be far from being _Lucriferous_, is yet\r\nexceedingly _Instructive_; as is also the way, the Author here adds, of\r\n_Volatilizing_ Gold, by the power of the same _Dissolvent_.\r\n\r\n8. _Aqua fortis, concoagulated with differing Bodies_, produced very\r\ndiffering Concretes: And the same Numeral Saline Corpuscles, that being\r\nassociated with those of one Mettal, had already produced a Body eminent in\r\none Taste, did {197} afterwards, being freed from that Body, compose a\r\nLiquor of a very differing taste; and after _that_ too, being combin'd with\r\nthe parties of another Mettal, did with them constitute a Body of a very\r\neminent Taste, as opposite as any one can be to both the other Tasts; and\r\nyet these Saline Corpuscles, being instead of this second Mettal,\r\nassociated with such a one as that, they are driven from, did therewith\r\nexhibite again the first of the three mention'd Tasts.\r\n\r\n9. _Water transmuted into Earth_, though the Author saith of this\r\nTransmutation, that it was not so perfect, as he wish'd, and as he hopes to\r\nmake it.\r\n\r\n10. _A mixture of Oyle of Vitriol and Spirit of Wine._ These two Liquors,\r\nbeing of odd Textures in reference to each other, their conjunction and\r\ndistillation made them exhibite these _Phænomena_: _vid._ That, whereas\r\nSpirit of Wine has no great, nor good scent, and moderately dephlegm'd Oyl\r\nof Vitriol is wont to be inodorous; the Spirit, that first came over from\r\ntheir mixture, had a scent not only very differing from Spirit of Wine, but\r\nfrom all things else, that the Author ever smelt; the Odor being very\r\nfragrant & pleasant, and so subtle, that in spight of the care taken in\r\nluting the Glasses exactly together, it would perfume the neighbouring\r\nparts of the _Laboratory_, and afterwards smell strongly at some distance\r\nfrom the Viol, wherein it was put, though stopt with a close Cork covered\r\nwith two or three several Bladders. But, after this volatile and\r\nodoriferous Spirit was come over, and had been follow'd by an Acid Spirit,\r\nit was at last succeeded by a strongly stinking Liquor, &c.\r\n\r\nBut _Manum de Tabula_: the Book it self will certainly give a satisfaction\r\nfar beyond what here can be said of it. {198}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some New observations about the Planet _Mars_, communicated since the\r\nPrinting of the former sheets._\r\n\r\nThere was very lately produced a Paper, containing some observations, made\r\nby Mr. _Hook_, about the Planet _Mars_; in the _Face_ whereof he affirmed\r\nto have discovered, in the late months of _February_ and _March_, that\r\nthere are several _Maculæ_ or _Spotted parts_, changing their place, and\r\nnot returning to the same Position, till the next ensuing night near about\r\nthe same time. Whence it may be collected, that _Mars_ (as well as\r\n_Jupiter_, and the _Earth_, &c.) does move about his own _Axis_, of which a\r\nfuller account will be given hereafter, God permitting.

How long the tender _Embryo_ of the Chick\r\nsoon after the _Punctum saliens_ is discoverable, _and_ whilst the Body\r\nseems but a little Organized Gelly, _and_ some while after _That_, will be\r\nthis way preserv'd, without being too much shrivel'd up, I was hindred by\r\nsome mischances to satisfie my self: but when the _Fætus's_, I took out,\r\nwere so perfectly formed as they were wont to be about the seventh day, and\r\nafter, they so well retain'd their shape and bulk, as to make me not repent\r\nof my curiosity: And some of those, which I did very early this Spring, I\r\ncan yet shew you. I know I have mention'd to you an easie application of\r\nwhat I, some year since, made publick enough; but not finding it to have\r\nbeen yet made by any other, and being perswaded by Experience, that it may\r\nbe extended to other _Fætus's_, which this season (the _Spring_) is time to\r\nmake provision off, I think the _Advertisement_ will not seem unseasonable\r\nto some of our Friends; though being now in haste, and having in my\r\nthoughts divers particulars, relating to this way of Preserving Birds taken\r\nout of the Egge, and other small _Fætus's_, I must content my self to have\r\nmention'd that, which is _Essential_, leaving divers other things, which a\r\nlittle practise may teach the Curious, unmention'd. Notwithstanding which,\r\nI must not omit these two Circumstances; the _one_, that when the Chick was\r\ngrown big, before I took it out of the Egge, I have (but not constantly)\r\n{201} mingled with the _Spirit of Wine_, a little Spirit of _Sal\r\nArmoniack_, made (as I have elsewhere delivered) * by the help of\r\n_Quick-lime_: which Spirit I choose, because, though it abounds in a Salt\r\nnot Sowre, but Urinous, yet I never observed it (how strong soever I made\r\nit) to coagulate Spirit of Wine. The _other_ circumstance is, that I\r\nusually found it convenient, to let the little _Animals_, I meant to\r\nimbalme, lie for a little while in ordinary Spirit of Wine, to wash off the\r\nlooser filth, that is wont to adhere to the Chick, when taken out of the\r\nEgge; and then, having put either the same kind of Spirit, or better upon\r\nthe same Bird, I suffer'd it to soak some hours (perhaps some daies, _pro\r\nre nata_) therein, that the Liquor, having drawn as it were what Tincture\r\nit could, the _Fætus_ being remov'd into more pure and well dephlegm'd\r\nSpirit of Wine, might not discolour it, but leave it almost as limpid, as\r\nbefore it was put in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Extract of a Letter, sent lately to Sir _Robert Moray_ out of\r\n_Virginia_, concerning an _unusual_ way of propagating _Mulberry trees_\r\nthere, for the better improvement of the _Silk-Work_; together with some\r\nother particulars, tending to the good of that _Plantation_._\r\n\r\nI am disappointed at this time of some Rarities of Minerals, Mettals, and\r\nStones; but you may have them any other time, as conveniently, &c. I have\r\nplanted here already ten thousand _Mulberry trees_; and hope, within two or\r\nthree years, to reap good silk of them. I have planted them in a way\r\nunusual here, which advances them two or three years growth, in respect of\r\ntheir being sown in seed: And they are now, at writing hereof all holding\r\ngood, although this has been a very long and bitter winter with us, much\r\nlonger and colder, than ever I did find it in _Scotland_ or _England_. I\r\nintend likewise to plant {202} them all, as if they were _Currants_ or\r\n_Goos-berries_, so thick as hedges; whereby one man may gather as many of\r\nthem, as otherwise, when they are planted in trees at distance, four\r\npersons my do. Expedient is the benefit of this Trade. Having discoursed of\r\nthis new way to all here; they are generally inclinable to it; considering\r\nthat the Planting their Trees, as before, at distance, and letting them\r\ngrow high, has been the main obstruction of that work hitherto, and the\r\nloss of their time and gain: but being in hedges, they will be always young\r\ntender plants; and consequently will be easily cut in great quantities with\r\na pair of Garden Sizzers. But there may be suggested yet another, and\r\nperhaps a better way; which is, to sowe some Acres with _Mulberry seed_,\r\nand to cut it with a sith, and ever to keep it under. I have also bethought\r\nmy self of a new way, for a few hands to serve many Worms, and that more\r\ncleanly than before: which also will be a means, without more trouble or\r\npains, to separate unhealthy worms from healthful; and by which a great\r\nmany more may be kept in a room, than otherwise upon shelves, as is usual\r\nhere. Besides this, I have sown a little _French Barley_ and _Rice seed_,\r\nand am thinking on a way of un-husking them with expedition, and so\r\npreparing them for the Merchant, as they use to be: But if you can inform\r\nme, how they are prepared, you may save me some labour. If I had any\r\n_Coffee_ in husks, or any other vegetable commodity, from the Streights to\r\ntry, I would here make tryal with them. Its like, that some of those\r\nMerchants that are of your _Society_, and keep a Correspondency there, may\r\nassist in procuring them. By the latter ships I intend to send you a New\r\nsort of sweet sented _Tobacco_, which I have not yet had time to improve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Method, by which a Glass of a small Plano-convex Sphere may be made to\r\nrefract the Rayes of light to a _Focus_ of a far greater distance, than is\r\nusual._\r\n\r\nThis is proposed by Mr. _Hook_, in consequence of what was {203} mention'd\r\nfrom him in _Numb._ 4 _pag._ 67, of these _Transactions_.\r\n\r\nPrepare (_saith he_) two Glasses, the one exactly flat on both sides, the\r\nother flat on the one side, and convex on the other, of what Sphere you\r\nplease. Let the flat Glass be a little broader than the other. Then let\r\nthere be made a Cell or Ring of Brass, very exactly turn'd, into which\r\nthese two Glasses may be so fastened with Cement, that the plain surfaces\r\nof them may lye exactly paralell, and that the Convex-side of the\r\nPlano-convex-Glass may lye inward; but so, as not to touch the flat of the\r\nother Glass. These being cemented into the Ring very closely about the\r\nedges, by a small hole in the side of the Brass-ring or Cell, fill the\r\ninterposed space between these two with _Water_, _Oyl of Turpentine_,\r\n_Spirit of Wine_, _Saline Liquors_, _&c;_ then stop the hole with a screw:\r\nand according to the differing refraction of the interposed Liquors, so\r\nshall the _Focus_ of the compound Glass be longer or shorter.\r\n\r\nBut this (adds the _Proposer_) I would only have look't upon, as one\r\ninstance of many (for there may be others) of the _Possibility_ of making a\r\nGlass, ground in a smaller Sphere, to constitute a Telescope of a much\r\ngreater length: Though (not to raise too great exspectation) I must add,\r\nThat of _Spherical_ object glasses, those are the best, which are made of\r\nthe greatest Sphere, and whose substance hath the greatest refraction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Observations about _Shining Worms_ in Oysters._\r\n\r\nThese Observations occur in the _French journal_ of _April_ 12. 1666. in\r\ntwo letters, written by M. _Auzout_ to M. _Dela Voye_; whereof the\r\nsubstance may be reduced to the following particulars.\r\n\r\n1. That M. _Dela Voye_ having observed, as he thought, {204} some shining\r\nWorms in Oysters; M. _Auzout_, being made acquainted with it, did first\r\nconceive, they were not Worms (unless they were crushed ones) that shin'd,\r\nas having not been able then to discern any parts of a Worm; but only some\r\nshining clammy moysture; which appeared indeed like a little Star of a\r\nblewish colour, and stuck to the Oyster-shell; being drawn out, shone in\r\nthe Air its whole length (which was about four or five lines,) and when put\r\nupon the _Observers_ hand, continued to shine there for some time.\r\n\r\n2. That M. _Auzout_ afterwards, causing more than 20. douzen of Oysters to\r\nbe open'd at Candle-light, really saw, in the dark, such shining worms in\r\nthem; and those of three sorts. _One_ sort was whitish, having 24. or 25.\r\nfeet on each side, forked; a black speck on one side of the head (taken by\r\nhim for a _Chrystallin_) & the back like an Eele, stript off her skin. The\r\n_second_, red, and resembling the common _Glow-worms_, found at Land, with\r\nfolds upon their backs, and feet like the former; and with a nose like that\r\nof a dog, and one eye in the head. The _third_ sort was speckled, having a\r\nhead like that of a Sole, with many tufts of whitish hair on the sides of\r\nit,\r\n\r\n3. That, besides these, the _Observer_ saw some much bigger, that were\r\ngrayish, with a big head, and two horns on it, like those of a Snayl, and\r\nwith 7. or 8. whitish feet, but these, though kept by him in the night,\r\nshin'd not.\r\n\r\n4. That the two first sorts are made of a matter easily resoluble, the\r\nleast shaking or touch turning them in into a viscous and aqueous matter;\r\nwhich falling from the shell, stuck to the _Observers_ fingers, and shone\r\nthere for the space of 20. seconds: and if any little part of this matter,\r\nby strongly shaking the shell, did fall to the ground, it appear'd like a\r\nlittle piece of a flaming Brimstone; and when shaken off nimbly, it became\r\nlike a small shining Line, which was dissipated before it came to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n{205} 5. That this shining matter was of different colour; some, whitish,\r\nsome, reddish; but yet that they afforded both, a light which appear'd a\r\nviolet to his eye.\r\n\r\n6. That it is very hard to examine these worms entire (especially the white\r\nones) because that at the least touch they doe burst, and resolve into a\r\nglutinous moysture; whence also if it were not for their feet, that are\r\ndiscover'd in their matter, none would judge them to be Worms.\r\n\r\n7. That among those, which he observed, he saw two more firm, than the\r\nrest, which shone all over; and when they fell from the Oyster, twinkled\r\nlike a great star, shining strongly, and emitting rays of a violet-light by\r\nturns, for the space, (as touch't above) of 20. seconds. Which\r\nScintillation the _Observer_ imputes to this, that those worms being alive,\r\nand sometimes raising their head, sometimes their tayle, like a Carpe, the\r\nlight increased and lessened accordingly; seeing that, when they shone not,\r\nhe did, viewing them by a Candle, find them dead.\r\n\r\n8. That forcibly shaking the Oyster-shells in the dark, he sometimes saw\r\nthe whole shell full of lights, now and then as big as a fingers end; and\r\nabundance of this clammy matter, both red and white, (which he judges to\r\nhave been Worms) burst in their holes.\r\n\r\n9. That in the shaking he saw all the Communications of these little\r\nVerminulous holes, like to the hole of Worms in Wood.\r\n\r\n10. That in more than 20 douzen of Oysters he shook no shell (10. or 12.\r\nexcepted) but it emitted light: And found some of this light in sixteen of\r\nthe Oysters themselves.\r\n\r\n11. That this light occurs more frequently in big, than small Oysters; in\r\nthose that are pierced by the Worm, oftner, than {206} in those that are\r\nnot, and rather upon the Convex-side, than the other; and more in fresh\r\nones; than in the stale.\r\n\r\n12. That having somewhat scaled the Convex-side of the shell, and\r\ndiscover'd the Communication of the holes, wherein the often-mention'd\r\nviscous moysture, that has any form of insects, is found; he smelt a scent,\r\nthat was like the water of a squeesed Oyster.\r\n\r\n13. That the Worms give no light, when irritated, but if they do, the light\r\nlasts but a very little time, whereas that which appears in those, that\r\nwere not angred before, continues a great while; the _Observer_ affirming\r\nto have kept of it above 2 hours.\r\n\r\nSo far the _Journal des Scavans_; which intimates withal, that if the\r\n_Observers_ had had better _Microscopes_, they could have better examin'd\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nBut since the curious here in _England_ are so well furnish with good ones,\r\n'tis hoped, that they will employ some of them for further and more minute\r\nObservations of these Worms; it being a matter, which, joyned with other\r\nObservations, already made by some excellent persons here, (especially Mr.\r\n_Boyle_) upon this subject of Light, may prove very luciferous to the\r\ndoctrine of it, so much yet in the dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations of the Effects of _Touch_ and _Friction_._\r\n\r\nThe Operations and Effects of _Touch_ and _Friction_ having been lately\r\nmuch taken notice off, and being lookt upon by some, as a great _Medical_\r\nBranch, for the curing of many diseases and infirmities; it will perhaps\r\nnot be unseasonable to mention (here also) some Observations relating\r\nthereunto; which may give an occasion to others, to consider this subject\r\nmore, than has been done heretofore, and to make {207} further Observations\r\nand Tryals concerning the power of the same.\r\n\r\nAnd _First_, the Illustrious Lord of _Verulam_, in his _History of Life and\r\nDeath_, Histor. 6. §. 3. observes, That _Motion_ and _Warmth_ (of which\r\ntwo, _Friction_ consists) draws forth, into the parts, New Juyce and\r\nVigour. And _Canon._ XIII. he affirms, That _Frictions_ conduce much to\r\n_Longevity_. See the same, _Connex._ ix. §. 26. &c.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, The Honourable _Robert Boyle_, in his _Usefulness of\r\nExperimental Philosophy_, _sect_ 2. _ch._ 15. considering the Body of a\r\nLiving man or any Animal, as an Engine, so composed, that there is a\r\nconspiring communication betwixt its parts, by vertue whereof a very slight\r\nimpression of adventitious matter upon some one part, may be able to work,\r\non some other distant part, or perhaps on the whole Engine, a change far\r\nexceeding, what the same adventitious matter could do upon a Body not so\r\ncontrived: Representing, I say, an Animal in this manner, and thence\r\ninferring, how it may be alter'd for the better or worse by motions or\r\nimpulses, confessedly _Mechanicall_, observes, How some are recover'd from\r\nswouning fits by pricking; others grow faint and do vomit by the bare\r\nmotion of a Coach; others fall into a troublesome sickness by the agitation\r\nof a Ship, and by the Sea-air (whence they recover by rest, and by going a\r\nshore.) Again, how in our Stables a Horse well-curried is half-fed: How\r\nsome can tell by the Milk of their Asses, whether that day they have been\r\nwell curried or not: Arguing hence, that if in _Milk_ the alteration is so\r\nconsiderable, it should be so likewise in the _Blood_, or other Juyces, of\r\nwhich the Blood is elaborated, and consequently in divers of the principal\r\nparts of the Body. Where also (upon the authority of _Piso_) he refers the\r\nReader to the _Brasilian_ Empiricks, whose {208} wild _Frictions_, as\r\nunskilfully as they order them, do strange things, both in _preserving\r\nhealth_, and _curing diseases_; curing Cold and _Chronical_ ones by\r\n_Friction_, as they do _Acute_ ones, by _Unction_.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, The learned Dr. _John Beale_, did not long since communicate by\r\nsome Letters; _First_, that he could make good proof of the curing or\r\nkilling a very great and dangerous _Wen_ (that had been very troublesome\r\nfor two or three years,) by the application of a dead mans hand, whence the\r\nPatient felt such a cold stream pass to the Heart, that it did almost cause\r\nin him a fit of swouning. _Secondly_, that, upon his brothers knowledge, a\r\ncertain Cook in a Noble Family of _England_ (wherein that brother of his\r\nthen lived) having been reproached for the ugliness of his _Warty_ hands,\r\nand return'd for answer, that he had tried many remedies, but found none,\r\nwas bid by his Lord, to rub his hand with that of a dead man; and that this\r\nLord dying soon after, the Cook made use both of his Lords advise and hand,\r\nand speedily found good effect. (Which is also confirm'd by what Mr.\r\n_Boyle_ relates in his lately mentioned _Book_, of Dr. _Harvey's_\r\nfrequently succesfull triall, of curing some Tumors or Excrescencies, by\r\nholding on them such a Hand.) Here is _Friction_ or _Touch_, to mortifie\r\nWens, to drive away swellings and Excrescencies: And why not to repell or\r\ndissipate Spirits, that may have a dangerous influence upon the Brain, or\r\nother parts; as well as to call forth the retired ones into the habit of\r\nthe Body, for Invigoration? _Thirdly_, that a Gentleman, who came lately\r\nout of _Ireland_, lay at his House, and inform'd him of an aged Knight\r\nthere, who having great pain in his feet, insomuch that he was unable to\r\nuse them, suffered, as he was going to bed, a loving _Spaniell_ to lick his\r\nfeet; which was for the present very pleasing to him, so that he used it\r\nmornings and evenings, till he found the pain appeased, and the use of his\r\nfeet restored. This, saith {209} the _Relater_, was a gentle touch, and\r\ntranspiration; for he found the Spirits transpire with a pleasing Kind of\r\nTitillation. _Fourthly_, that he can assure of an honest Blacksmith, who by\r\nhis healing hand converted his Barrs of Iron into Plates of Silver; and had\r\nthis particular faculty, that he caused Vomitings by stroaking the Stomack;\r\ngave the Stool by stroaking the Belly; appeased the Gout, and other paines,\r\nby stroaking the parts affected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some particulars, communicated from forraign parts, concerning the\r\nPermanent _Spott_ in _Jupiter_; and a Contest between two Artists about\r\n_Optick Glasses_, &c._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _See _Numb. 1_. of these _Transactions_; by the date whereof it\r\nwill appeare, that that _Spot_ was observed in _England_, a good while\r\nbefore any such thing was so much as heard of._]\r\n\r\n_Eustachio de Divinis_ (saith the _Informer_,) has written a large Letter,\r\nwherein he pretends, that the Permanent Spot in _Jupiter_ hath been first\r\nof all discovered with _his_ Glasses; and that the P. _Gotignies_ is the\r\nfirst that hath thence deduced the Motion of _Jupiter_ about his _Axis_;\r\nand that Signior _Cassini_ opposed it at first; to whom the said\r\n_Gotignies_ wrote a letter of complaint thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe same _Eustachio_ pretends likewise, that his great Glasses excell those\r\nof _Campani_; and that in all the tryals, made with them, they have\r\nperformed better; and that _Campani_ was not willing to do, what was\r\nnecessary for well comparing the one with the other. _viz._ To put equall\r\n_Eye-glasses_ in them, or to exchange the same Glasses.\r\n\r\nThe said _Divini_ affirms also, that he hath found a way to {210} know,\r\nwhether an Object glass be good or not, onely by looking upon it, without\r\ntrying. This would be of good use, especially if it should extend so far as\r\nto discerne the goodness of such a glass, whilst it is yet on the Cement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of Dr. _Sydenham's_ Book, entituled, _Methodus Curandi Febres,\r\nPropriis observationibus superstructa_._\r\n\r\nThis _Book_ undertakes to deliver a more certain and more genuine Method of\r\ncuring Feavers and Agues, than has obtained hitherto: And it being\r\npremised, _First_, that a Fever is Natures Engine, she brings into the\r\nfield, to remove her enemy; or her handmaid, either for evacuating the\r\nimpurities of the blood, or for reducing it into a New State: _Secondly_,\r\nthat the true and genuine cure of this sickness consists in such a\r\ntempering of the Commotion of the Blood, that it may neither exceed, nor be\r\ntoo languide: This, I say, being premised by the Author, he informs the\r\nReader;\r\n\r\nIn the _First Section_, of the different Method, to be employed in the cure\r\nof Feavers, not only in respect of the differing constitutions and ages of\r\nthe patients, but also in regard of the differing seasons of one and the\r\nsame year, and of the difference of one year from another. As to the\r\n_Former_, he shews, in what sorts of _Patients_, and at what time of the\r\nFeaver, Phlebotomy, or Vomiting, or both, are to be used; and when and\r\nwhere not: In what space of time the _Depuration_ if nature be not\r\ndisturbed or hindred in her work, will be perform'd: When _Purgatives_ are\r\nto be administred: How that _Diarrhea's_ happen, if the _Patient_ had in\r\nthe {211} beginning of the Feaver an inclination to vomit, but no vomit was\r\ngiven; and that those symptoms, which commonly are imputed to a malignity,\r\ndo, for the most part, proceed from the Relaxation of the tone of the\r\nBloud, caused by Medicines too refrigerating, or by the unseasonable use of\r\nGlisters in the declination of the disease. As to the _Latter_, he\r\nobserves, that one of the chief causes, rendring the Cure of Feavers so\r\nuncertain and unsuccessfull, is, that _Practitioners_ do accommodate their\r\nobservations, they take from the successful cure of some Feavers in one\r\nseason or the year, or in some one year, to that of all Feavers in any\r\nseason, or in any year whatsoever. And here he observes, _first_, how\r\nvigorous the blood is in the _Spring_, and how dispirited in _Autumn_; and\r\nthence regulates the letting of bloud, and Vomiting, and the giving of\r\nGlisters. _Next_, how difficult it is, to assign the cause of the\r\ndifference between the Feavers of _Several years_; and to prognosticate of\r\nthe salubrity or insalubrity of the following part of the year: where yet\r\nhe insinuates, that, when _Insects_ do swarm extraordinarily, and when\r\nFeavers and Agues (especially _Quartans_) appear very early, as about\r\n_Midsummer_, then _Autumn_ commonly proves very sickly. _Lastly_, what\r\nmethod and Cautions are to be used in the Cure of _Epidemical_ Feavers.\r\n\r\nIn the _Second Section_, he treats of the _Symptoms_, accompanying\r\n_Continued_ Feavers; as _Phrensies_, _Pleurisies_, _Coughs_, _Hicoughs_,\r\n_Fluxes_, &c. Shewing, both whence they are caused, and how they are to be\r\ncured: Where having inserted a considerable _Paragraph_, touching a certain\r\n_Symptomatical_ Feaver in the _Spring_, to be cured like Plurisies; he\r\nmentions among many Observables, this, as a chief one, that _Laudanum_, or\r\nany other _Narcotick_ given against the _Phrensy_, in the beginning,\r\nprogress, or height of a Feaver, does rather hurt, than good, but in the\r\ndeclination thereof, is used with good success. To all which he subjoins a\r\nparticular {212} accompt of the _Iliac Passion_ (esteem'd by him to be\r\nsometimes a _Symptome_ also of Feavers;) not only discoursing of its cause\r\n(a preposterous inversion of the Intestins, proceeding either from\r\nObstruction, or Irritation,) but adding also a very plain way of Curing the\r\nsame; and that not by the use of _Quick-silver_ or _Bullets_ (by him judged\r\nto be frequently noxious) but only by _Mint-water_; and the application of\r\na Whelp to the Patients stomach; to strengthen the same, and to reduce it\r\nagain to its natural motion.\r\n\r\nIn the _Third Section_, he treats of _Intermittent_ Feavers, or of _Agues_:\r\nWhere he discourses of the times of the _Cold_ and _Hot_ fits, and of\r\n_that_ of the _Separation_ of the subdued aguish matter: Finds difficulty\r\nin giving a satisfactory accompt of the _return of Fits_: distinguishes\r\nAgues into _Vernal_ and _Autumnal_: Takes notice, that as there are few\r\n_Continued_ Feavers, so generally there are only _Quotidians_ and\r\n_Tertians_, in the _Spring_; and only _Tertians_ and _Quartans_ in\r\n_Autumn_; Of which having offered Reasons, that seem considerable, he\r\nproceeds to his Method of curing them; and, laying much weight upon the\r\nsaid difference, he prescribes and urges different ways to be used in that\r\ncure: Interserting among other things these notes; _First_, that the Period\r\nof Fermentation in Feavers, both _Continued_ and _Intermittent_, is (if\r\nleft to Natures own conduct, and well regulated, if need be, by Art)\r\nperform'd in about 336. hours or 14 dayes, subducting in _Intermittent_\r\nones, the hours of intermission, and counting 5½ hours for every Paroxism;\r\nand imputing the excursion beyond that time to the disturbance given to\r\nnature by the error of Practitioners. _Secondly_, that whoever hath had a\r\n_Quartan_ formerly, though many years be pass'd, shall, if he chance to\r\nhave another, be _soon_ freed from it; and that a Physician knowing _that_,\r\nmay confidently predict _this_. {213}\r\n\r\nIn the _Fourth Section_, the Author, in conformity to the Custom of those\r\nthat write of Feavers, discourses of the _Small-pox_; and _First_,\r\nexamining the cause of this sickness and its universality, delivers his\r\npeculiar opinion of the bloud's endeavouring a Renovation or a New Texture\r\n(once at least in a Mans life) and is inclin'd to preferr the same to the\r\nreceived doctrine of its malignity. _Then_, having laid down, for a\r\nfoundation of the Cure, the two times, of _Separation_ and _Expulsion_, he\r\nargues as well against too high an Ebullition or too hasty a separation (by\r\na hot diet or high Cordials) as against too languid a one (by Blooding,\r\nPurges, and Cooling medicines.) The like he does to the Time of\r\n_Expulsion_, forbidding _both_ immoderate Heat (whereby Nature's expelling\r\noperation is disturbed by a precipitated and too thick a crowd of the\r\nprotruded pustuls,) _and_ too much Cooling, whereby due Expulsion is\r\nhindred. In short, he advises, to permit Nature to do her own work,\r\nrequiring nothing of the Physician, but to regulate her, when she is\r\nexorbitant, and to fortifie her, when she is too weak.

But the Table of\r\n_Meridional_ degrees being calculated only to every _Sexagesimal_ minute of\r\na degree, shews some small difference from the said _Logarithmical\r\nTangent-line_. Hence it may be doubted, whether that difference do not\r\narise from that little errour, which is committed by calculating the Table\r\nof _Meridional_ degrees _only_ to every minute. {216}\r\n\r\nMr. _Oughtred_ in the VI. _Chap._ of his _Navigation_, annexed to the Book,\r\nentituled, _The Circles of Proportion, and the Horizontal Instrument_ &c.\r\nmentions an Artifice, by himself discover'd, by which it may be effected,\r\nthat the small Parts of the _Meridian_ be not _one_ minute (which on the\r\nface of the _Earth_ answers to above an _English_ Mile) but the\r\nhundred-thousanth, or, if need be, the millioneth part of a minute, scarce\r\nexceeding one fifteenth part of an Inch: Which thing, _he saith_, he is\r\nable to perform in _Tables_ unto the _Radius_ 10000000; yet nothing at all\r\ndiffering either in their form or manner of working from those that are now\r\ncommonly in use.\r\n\r\nBut which way this is to be done, this _Author_ hath not made known to the\r\nPublick. And, though such _Tables_ unto the _Radius_ 10000000, had been\r\nbrought to light, yet would they not be sufficient to prove the identity or\r\nsameness of the said two Lines, as to continue the comparison between them\r\nas far, as the one of them, _videl._ the _Logarithmicall Tangent-line_, is\r\nalready calculated, that is; to Ten places, besides the _Charactoristick_.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, if a certain Rule could be produced, by which the Agreement\r\nor Disagreement of the said two Lines might be shew'd, not only to that\r\nExtent of places, to which that _Tangent Line_ is already calculated, but\r\nalso to as many more, as the same may be yet further extended unto, in\r\n_infinitum usque_; surely that rule would not only save us the labour of\r\nmaking _Tables_ unto the _Radius_ 10000000; but also the _Helix_ or Spiral\r\nLine of the Ships Course would be reduced to a more precise exactness, than\r\never was pretended by Him: and this most Noble and Useful Science (as He\r\njustly calls it) which is the Bond of most disjunct Countries, and the\r\nConsociation of Nations farthest remote, would attain its full lustre and\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nBesides, that the same Rule would also discover a far easier way of making\r\n_Logarithmes_, than ever was practised or known; and therefore might serve,\r\nwhen ever there should be occasion, to extend the _Logarithmes_ beyond that\r\nnumber of places, that is already extant.\r\n\r\nMoreover such a rule would enable men to draw the _Meridian_ line\r\n_geometrically_, that is, without _Tables_ or _Scales_: which indeed {217}\r\nmight also be done, by setting of the _Secants_ of every whole or half\r\ndegree, if there were not this Inconveniency in it (which is not in my\r\nRule:) That a Line composed of so many small parts, would be subject to\r\nmany errours, especially in a small compass.\r\n\r\nThe same Rule also will serve, to find the Course and Distance between two\r\nPlaces assigned, as far, as practice shall require it; and that, without\r\nany Table of _Meridional_ parts, and yet with as much ease and exactness.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing all these things do depend on the solution of this Question,\r\n_Whether the Artificial Tangent-line be the true Meridian-line?_ It is\r\ntherefore, that I undertake, by God's assistance, to resolve the said\r\nQuestion. And to let the world know the readiness and confidence, I have to\r\nmake good this undertaking, I am willing to lay a _Wager_ against any one\r\nor more persons that have a mind to engage, for so much as _another\r\nInvention_ of mine (which is of less subtlety, but of far greater benefit\r\nto the publick) may be worth to the Inventor.\r\n\r\nFor, the great advantage, that all Merchants, Mariners, and consequently\r\nthe Common-wealth, may receive from this _other Invention_, is, in my\r\njudgment, highly valuable; seeing it will oftentimes make a ship sail,\r\nthough, according to the common way of sailing, the wind be quite contrary,\r\nand yet as near to the place intended, as if the wind had been favourable:\r\nOr, if you will, it will enable one to gain something in the intended way,\r\nwhether the wind be good or no (except only when you go directly South or\r\nNorth) but the advantage will be most, where there is most need of it, that\r\nis, when the Wind is contrary: So that one may very often gain a fifth,\r\nfourth, third part, or more of the intended voyage; according as it is\r\nlonger or shorter, _viz._ always more in a longer Voyage, where the gain is\r\nmore considerable, and more welcome; not only by saving Time, but also\r\nVictuals, Water, Fuel, Mens health, and so much Room in the ship.\r\n\r\nAll this, which is here pretended, the Proposer is to make good by the\r\nVerdict of some able Men, who also may give a guess, what this latter\r\nInvention may be worth to the owner: And for so much, and no more, he will\r\nstand engaged against {218} any one or more Persons, that he will and shall\r\nresolve the _Question_ above-mention'd, _viz. Whether the Artificial\r\nTangent-line be the true Meridian-line, yea or no?_ And if he do not, that\r\nthen he will loose, and transport to the other Party the whole benefit of\r\nthe last mentioned invention. But if, on the contrary, he do prove or\r\ndisprove the Identity of the said two lines, to the Judgment of some able\r\n_Mathematicians_, That then so much money be paid him by the other Party,\r\nas the said Invention was valued.\r\n\r\nAnd, whereas there are often Wagers laid about things that concern the\r\nEngagers little or nothing; 'tis thought, that it would concern all\r\nMerchants, Mariners, and all Lovers of the common good, rather to lay\r\nwagers against one another about Things of this nature, where the Gainer\r\ndoth gain as well, as if he had laid his wager about something else, and\r\nthe Looser hath so far the benefit as well as the Gaine, That he seeth\r\nthereby promoted the thing, that concerns them both alike.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, to the end, that the Looser may have his benefit by it, as\r\nwell as the Gainer, it would not be amiss, that the condition were made\r\nthus, that the latter should grant the moity of his gain to the Proposer;\r\nthat thereby he might be enabled to bring to light both those, and some\r\nother useful inventions, for the Service of Mankind. And to manifest, that\r\nit is not for his own interest only, that the _Proposer_ mentions this; he\r\nis willing to impart from that moity, so received, the full moity again to\r\nany other person within his Majesty's Dominions, who shall first of all\r\ngive notice of his Undertaking to prove or disprove the said Identity, and\r\nperform it accordingly within the space of two Months, to be computed from\r\nthe present Date. Those that have a mind to engage, may repair to the\r\nPrinters of these _Tracts_, where they may know further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A new Contrivance of _Wheel-Barometer_, much more easy to be prepared,\r\nthan that, which is described in the _Micrography_; imparted by the Author\r\nof that Book._\r\n\r\nThis is only an easy way of applying an _Index_ to any _Common Barascope_,\r\nwhether the Glass be only a Single Cane, or have a round Bolthead at the\r\ntop. And by the means thereof, the {219} Variation of the Altitude of the\r\n_Mercurial_ Cylinder, which at most is hardly three Inches, may be made as\r\ndistinguishable, as if it were three Foot, or three Yards, or as much more,\r\nas is desired.\r\n\r\nThe manner hereof is visible enough by _Figure_ I: where A B C represents\r\nthe Tube, which may be either Blunt, or with a Head, as A B C (by which\r\nlatter shape, more room is allow'd for any remainder of Air, to expand the\r\nbetter.) This is to be filled with Quick-silver, and inverted as commonly;\r\nbut into a Vessel of Stagnant Mercury, made after the fashion of I K, that\r\nis, having its sides about 3 or 4 inches high, and the Cavity of it equally\r\nbig both above and below; and if it can be (besides that part, which is\r\nfill'd by the end of the _Mercurial_ Tube, that stands in it) of equal\r\ncapacity with the hollow of the Cane about B: For then the Quicksilver\r\nrising as much in the hollow of I, as it descends at B, the difference of\r\nthe height in the Receiver I, will be just half the usual difference, And\r\nif the receiving Vessel I K have a bigger Cavity, the difference will be\r\nless, but if less, the difference will be greater: But, whether the\r\ndifference be hereby made bigger or less, 'tis no great matter, since by\r\nthe contrivance of the _Wheel_ and _Index_ (which is more fully described\r\nin the _Preface_ to the _Micrography_) the least variation may be made as\r\nsensible as is desired, by diminishing the bigness of the Cylinder E, and\r\nlengthening the _Index_ F G, according to the Proportion requisite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of _Four Suns_, which very lately appear'd in _France_, and of\r\ntwo _Raine-bows_, unusually posited, seen in the same Kingdom, somewhat\r\nlonger agoe._\r\n\r\nThese _Phænomena_ are thought worthy to be inserted here, for the\r\nSpeculation of the Curious in those Kingdoms; as they were publisht in the\r\nFrench _Journal des Scavans_, of May 10, 1666. _viz._\r\n\r\nThe 9th of _April_ of this present year, about half an hour past nine,\r\nthere appear'd three Circles in the Sky. _One_ of them was very great, a\r\nlittle interrupted, and white every where, without {220} the mixture of any\r\nother colour. It passed through the midst of the Sun's _Disk_, and was\r\nparallel to the _Horizon_. Its _Diameter_ was above a hundred degrees, and\r\nits _Center_ not far from the _Zenith_.\r\n\r\nThe _Second_ was much less and defective in some places, having the Colours\r\nof a Rainbow, especially in that part, which was within the great Circle.\r\nIt had the true Sun for its Center.\r\n\r\nThe _Third_ was less, than the first, but greater than the second; it was\r\nnot entire, but only an Arch or Portion of a Circle, whose Center was far\r\ndistant from that of the Sun, and whose circumference did, by its middle,\r\njoin to that of the least Circle, intersecting the greatest Circle by its\r\ntwo extreams. In this Circle were discerned also the Colours of a Rainbow,\r\nbut they were not so strong, as those of the _Second_.\r\n\r\nAt the place, where the circumference of this _Third_ Circle did close with\r\nthat of the _Second_, there was a great brightness of Rainbow-Colours, mixt\r\ntogether: And at the two extremities, where this _Second_ Circle\r\nintersected the _First_, appear'd two _Parhelia's_ or Mock-suns; which\r\nshone very bright, but not so bright, nor were so well defined, as the true\r\nSun. The False Sun, that was towards the _South_, was bigger, and far more\r\nluminous, than that towards the _East_. Besides those two _Parhelia's_,\r\nwhich were on the two sides of the true Sun, in the intersection of the\r\n_First_ and _Third_ Circle, there was also upon the _First_ great Circle, a\r\n_third_ Mock-sun, situated to the _North_, which was less and less bright,\r\nthan the two others. So that at the same time there were seen _Four_ Suns\r\nin the Heavens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Figure_ II. will illustrate the Position of this _Phænomenon_.\r\n\r\nA. _The Zenith or the Point Vertical to the place of Observation._\r\n\r\nB. _The true Sun._\r\n\r\nS C H N. _The great Circle, altogether White, almost parallel to the\r\nHorizon, which pass'd through the true Sun's Diske, and upon which were the\r\nfalse Suns._\r\n\r\nD E B O. _A Rain-bow about the Sun, forming an entire Circle, but\r\ninterrupted in some places._\r\n\r\nH D N. _A portion of a Circle, that was Excentrick to the Sun, and greater\r\nthan the Circle_ D E B O, _which touch'd_ D E B O, _and was confounded with\r\nit in the point_ D. {221} H N. _The two Mock-Suns, in the intersection of\r\nthe Semicircle_ H D N, _and the Circle_ S C H N: _The midst of which two\r\nFalse-Suns was white and very luminous; and their Extremities towards_ D I\r\n_were tinged with the Colours of a Rainbow.

X._]\r\n\r\nThis Appearance is look't upon as one of the notablest, that can be seen,\r\nby reason of the _Excentricity_ of the Circle H D N, and because that the\r\n_Parhelia_ * were not in the Intersection of the Circle D E B O with the\r\ngreat Circle S C H N, but in that of the Semi-circle H D N.\r\n\r\nAs for the two odd _Rainbows_; they appear'd at _Chartres_ the 10. of\r\n_August_, 1665. about half an hour past six in the Evening; and did cross\r\none another almost at right Angles, as may be seen by _Fig._ IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Rainbow, which was opposite to the Sun, in the usual manner, was more\r\ndeeply colour'd, than that, which cross'd it; though even the Colours of\r\nthe first _Iris_ were not so strong, as they are now and then seen at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest height of the stronger Rainbow, was about 45. degrees; the\r\nfeebler Rainbow lost one of its Legs, by growing fainter, about 20 degrees\r\nabove the stronger; and the Leg below appear'd continued to the _Horizon_.\r\n\r\nThese Rainbows did not _Just_ decussate one another at right Angles; there\r\nwas some 6 or 7 degrees difference. The fainter, seem'd to be a Portion of\r\na great Circle; and the stronger was but a Portion of a small Circle, as\r\nusually.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, at their appearance, was about 6 degrees high above the _Horizon_,\r\nand towards the 17 _Azimuth_ of the West, Northward.\r\n\r\n{222}\r\n\r\nThe Observer, M. _Estienne_, notes, that, when he made this Observation,\r\nthe River of _Chartres_, which runs very near from _South_ to _North_, was\r\nbetwixt him and the Rainbow; and that he stood Level with this River,\r\nwhence he was distant not above 150 paces: which he adds, that the Curious\r\nmay the better judge of this Observation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of an Accident by Thunder and Lightning, at _Oxford_._\r\n\r\nThis was imparted by Dr. _Wallis_ in a Letter, written at _Oxford_, May 12,\r\n1666. to the _Publisher_, as follows:\r\n\r\nI should scarce have given you so soon the trouble of another Letter, were\r\nit not for an Accident which hapn'd here _May_ 10. I had that afternoon,\r\nabout 4 of the clock heard it thunder at some distance. About 5 of the\r\nclock the Thunder coming nearer to us; it began to rain, and soon after\r\n(the rain withal increasing) the Thunder grew very loud, and frequent, and\r\nwith long ratling Claps (though not altogether so great, as I have some\r\nother times heard:) and the Lightning with flashes very bright\r\n(notwithstanding the clear day-light) and very frequent, (when at the\r\nfastest, scarce a full minute between one flash and another; many times not\r\nso much, but a second flash before the Thunder of the former was heard:)\r\nThe Thunder for the most part began to be heard about 8 or 10 second\r\nminutes after the flash; as I observ'd for a great part of the time by my\r\nMinute-Watch: but once or twice I observ'd it to follow (in a manner)\r\nimmediately upon it, as it were in the same moment; and the lightning\r\nextream red and fiery. I do not use to be much apprehensive of Thunder and\r\nLightning, but I was at this time (I know not well, why?) very\r\napprehensive, more than ordinary, of mischief to be done by it, for it\r\nseem'd to me to be very low and near us (which made me so particular, as to\r\nobserve the distance of the flash by the noise) and very frequent, and\r\nbright, so that, had it been by night as it was by day, it would have been\r\nvery terrible. And, though I kept within doors, yet I sensibly discover'd a\r\nstinking sulphureous smell in the Air. About 7 of the clock it ended,\r\nbefore which time I had news brought me of a Sad Accident upon the {223}\r\nwater at _Medley_ about a Mile or somewhat more distant from hence. Two\r\nSchollars of _Wadham_-Colledge, being alone in a Boat (without a Water-man)\r\nhaving newly thrust off from shore, at _Medley_, to come homewards,\r\nstanding near the Head of the Boat, were presently with a stroke of Thunder\r\nor Lightning, both struck off out of the Boat into the Water, the one of\r\nthem stark dead, in whom, though presently taken out of the Water (having\r\nbeen by relation, scarce a minute in it) there was not discerned any\r\nappearance of life, sense, or motion: the other was stuck fast in the Mud\r\n(with his Feet downwards, and his upper parts above water) like a post not\r\nable to help himself out; but, besides a present stonying or numness, had\r\nno other hurt; but was for the present so disturb'd in his senses, as that\r\nhe knew not, how he came there out of the Boat, nor could remember either\r\nThunder or Lightning, that did effect it: and was very feeble and faint\r\nupon it; which (though presently put into a warm Bed) he had not thoroughly\r\nrecover'd by the next Night; and whether since he have or no, I know not.\r\n\r\nOthers in another Boat, about 10 or 20 yards from these (as by their\r\ndescription I estimate) felt a disturbance and shaking in their Boat, and\r\none of them had his Chair struck from under him, and thrown upon him; but\r\nhad no hurt. Those immediately made up to the others, and (some leaping\r\ninto the Water to them) presently drew them either into the Boat or on\r\nShore; yet none of them saw these two fall into the Water (not looking that\r\nway) but heard one of them cry out for help presently upon the stroke, and\r\nsmelt a strange stinking smell in the Air; which, when I asked him, that\r\ntold it me, what kind of stink? he said, like such a smell, as is perceived\r\nupon the stricking of Flints together.\r\n\r\nHe that was dead (when by putting into a warm Bed, and rubbing, and putting\r\nstrong waters into his Mouth, &c. no life could be brought into him) was\r\nthe next morning brought to town; where, among the multitudes of others,\r\nwho came to see, Dr. _Willis_, Dr. _Mellington_, Dr. _Lower_, and my self,\r\nwith some others, went to view the Corps: where we found no wound at all in\r\nthe skin, the face and neck swart and black, but not more, than might be\r\nordinary, by the settling of the blood: On the right side of the neck was a\r\nlittle blackish spot about an inch long, and {224} about a quarter of an\r\ninch broad at the broadest, and was, as if it had been sear'd with a hot\r\niron; and, as I remember, one somewhat bigger on the left side of the neck,\r\nbelow the Ear. Streight down the breast, but towards the left side of it,\r\nwas a large place about three quarters of a Foot in length, and about two\r\ninches in breadth, in some places more, in some less, which was burnt and\r\nhard, like Leather burnt with the fire, of a deep blackish red Colour, not\r\nmuch unlike the scorch'd skin of a rosted Pig. And on the fore-part of the\r\nleft Shoulder such another spot about as big as a Shilling; but that in the\r\nneck was blacker and seem'd more sear'd. From the top of the right\r\nshoulder, sloping downwards towards that place in his Breast, was a narrow\r\nLine of the like scorched skin; as if somewhat had come in there at the\r\nneck, and had run down to the breast, and there spread broader.\r\n\r\nThe buttons of his _Doublet_ were most of them off; which, some thought\r\nmight have been torn off with the blast, getting in at the neck, and then\r\nbursting its way out: for which the greatest presumption was (to me) that,\r\nbesides 4 or 5 buttons wanting towards the bottom of the Breast, there were\r\nabout half a dozen together clear off from the bottom of the collar\r\ndownwards, and I do not remember, that the rest of the buttons seem to be\r\nnear worn out, but almost new. The collar of his doublet just over the\r\nfore-part of the left shoulder was quit broken asunder, cloth and\r\nstiffening, streight downwards, as if cut or chop'd asunder, but with a\r\n_Blunt_ tool; only the inward linnen or fustian lineing of it was whole, by\r\nwhich, and by the view of the ragged Edges, it seem'd manifest to me, that\r\nit was by the stroak inward (from without) not outwards from within.\r\n\r\nHis _Hat_ was strangely torn, not just on the Crown, but on the side of the\r\nhat, and on the brim. On the side of it was a great hole, more than to put\r\nin ones fist through it: some part of it being quite struck away, and from\r\nthence divers gashes every way, as if torn, or cut with a _Dull_ tool, and\r\nsome of them of a good length, almost quite to the edges of the brim. And,\r\nbeside these, one or two gashes more, which did not communicate with the\r\nhole in the side. This also I judged by a stroke inwards; not so much from\r\nthe view of the edges of those gashes (from which there was scarce any\r\njudgement to be made either way) but {225} because the lining was not torn,\r\nonly ript off from the edge of the hat (where it was sow'd on) on that\r\nside, where the hole was made. But his hat not being found upon his head,\r\nbut at some distance from him, it did not appear, against what part of the\r\nhead that hole was made.\r\n\r\nUpon the rest of his Cloaths, I do not know of any further effect, nor did\r\nwe smell any sulphurous scent about them: which might be, _Partly_ because\r\nit was now a good while after the time, and _Partly_ by reason of their\r\nbeing presently drenched in the water into which he fell.\r\n\r\nThe night following, the three _Doctors_ above mentioned, and my self, with\r\nsome Chirurgions (besides a multitude of others) were present at the\r\nopening of the head, to see if any thing could be there discover'd; but\r\nthere appear'd no sign of contusion; the brain full and in good order; the\r\nnerves whole and sound, the vessels of the brain pretty full of Blood. But\r\nnothing was by any of them discern'd to be at all amiss. But it was by\r\ncandle-light, and they had not time to make very nice Observations of it\r\n(the Body being to be buried by and by) and the croud of People was a\r\nfurther hindrance. But if any thing had been considerably out of order to\r\nthe view, it would surely have been by some of them discover'd. Some of\r\nthem thought, they discern'd a small fissure or crack in the skull; and\r\nsome who held it, while it was sawing off, said, they felt it Jarring in\r\ntheir hands, and there seem'd to the eye something like it, but it was so\r\nsmall, as that by candle-light we could not agree it certainly so to be.\r\n\r\nSome of the _Hair_ on the right Temple was manifestly singed, or burnt; and\r\nthe lower part of that Ear blacker, than the parts about it, but soft; and\r\nit might be only the settling of the Blood. The upper part of the left\r\nshoulder, and that side of the neck, were also somewhat blacker than the\r\nrest of the Body, but whether it were by the blow, which broke the collar,\r\nand scorch'd the round red spot thereupon, or only by settling of the\r\nBlood, I cannot say; yet I think, it might very well be, that both on the\r\nhead, and on this side of the neck, there might be a very great blow, and a\r\ncontusion upon it (and seems to have been so, by the tearing of the hat,\r\nand breaking the collar, if not also cracking of the skull) and yet no sign\r\nof such contusion, because dying so immediately, there was not time for the\r\nBlood to gather {226} to the part and stagnate there (which in bruises is\r\nthe cause of blackness) and it was but as if such a blow had been given on\r\na Body newly dead; which does not use to cause such a symptom of a bruise,\r\nafter the Blood ceases to circulate.\r\n\r\nHaving done with, the Head, they open'd the _Breast_, and found that\r\nburning to reach quite through the skin, which was in those scorch'd places\r\nhard and horney, and shrunk up, so as it was not so thick as the soft skin\r\nabout it: but no appearance of any thing deeper than the skin; the Muscles\r\nnot at all disorder'd or discolour'd (perhaps, upon the reason, that was\r\nbut now said of the Head, Neck and Shoulder). Having then taken off the\r\n_Sternum_, the Lungs and Heart appear'd all well, and well-colour'd without\r\nany disorder.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of what was observ'd; only that the whole Body was, by\r\nnight, very much swell'd, more than in the morning; and smelt very strong\r\nand offensively: Which might be by the hotness of the weather, and by the\r\nheat of the place occasion'd by the multitude of People.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Experiment to examine, what _Figure_, and _Celerity_ of _Motion_\r\nbegetteth, or encreaseth _Light_ and _Flame_._\r\n\r\nThis was communicated by Dr. _Beale_, as follows;\r\n\r\n_May_ 5. 1665. fresh Mackrels were boyl'd in Water, with salt and sweet\r\nherbs; and, when the Water was perfectly cold, the next morning, the\r\nMackrels were left in the Water for pickle.\r\n\r\n_May_ 6. more fresh Mackrels were boyl'd in like Water; and _May_ 7. both\r\nWater and Mackrels were put into the former Water, together with the former\r\nMackrels. (Which circumstances I do particularize, because, whether, the\r\nmixture of the pickle of several ages, and a certain space of time, or\r\nwhatever else was necessary, and wanting, the trial did not succeed with\r\nlike effect at other times).\r\n\r\nBut now on the next _Munday_ (_May_ 8). evening, the Cook stirring the\r\nWater, to take out some of the Mackrels, found the Water at the first\r\nmotion become very luminous, and the Fish shining through the Water, as\r\nadding much to the Light, which the water yielded. The water by the mixture\r\nof Salt and Herbs, {227} in the boyling, was of it self thick and rather\r\nblackish, than of any other clear colour: yet being stirr'd, it shin'd, and\r\nall the fish appear'd, more brightly luminous in their own shapes.\r\n\r\nWherever the drops of this water (after it was stirr'd) fell on the Ground,\r\nor Benches, they shin'd: And the Children took drops in their hands, as\r\nbroad as a penny, running with them about the house, and each drop, both\r\nnear and at distance, seem'd by their shining as broad as a six pence, or a\r\nshilling, or broader.\r\n\r\nThe Cook turn'd up the side of the Fish, which was lowest, and thence came\r\nno shining: and after the water was for some good time settled, and fully\r\nat rest, it did not shine at all.\r\n\r\nOn _Tuesday_ night (_May_ 9). we repeated the same Trial, and found the\r\nsame effects. The water, till it was stirr'd, gave no light, but was thick\r\nand dark, as we saw by day-light, and by candle-light. As soon as the\r\nCook's hand was thrust into the water, it began to have a glimmering; but\r\nbeing gently stirr'd by the hand moving round (as the Dairy-maid do to\r\ngather the Curds for Cheese) it did so shine, that they, who look'd on it\r\nat some distance, from the farther end of another room, thought verily, it\r\nwas the shining of the Moon through a Window upon a Vessel of Milk; and by\r\nbrisker Circulation it seem'd to flame.\r\n\r\nThe Fish did then shine as well from the Inside, as the Outside, and\r\nchiefly from the Throat, and such places, as seem'd a little broken in the\r\nboyling.\r\n\r\nI took a piece that shin'd most, and fitted it as well as I could devise in\r\nthe night, both to my great _Microscope_, and afterwards to my little one;\r\nbut I could discern no light by any of these Glasses; nor from any drops of\r\nthe shining water, when put into the Glasses. And _May_ 10. in the\r\nbrightest rayes of the Sun, I examin'd, in my great _Microscope_, a small\r\nbroken piece of the Fish, which shin'd most the night before. We could find\r\nnothing on the surface of the Fish very remarkable. It seem'd whitish, and\r\nin a manner dried, with deep inequalities. And others, as well as my self,\r\nthought, we saw a stream, rather darkish, than luminous, arising like a\r\nvery small dust from the Fish: And rarely here and there, a very small; and\r\nalmost imperceptible sparkle in the Fish. Yet of these _sparkles_ we are\r\n_certain_; we numbered them, and agreed in the number, order and place. Of\r\nthe _steam_ I am not confident, but do suspect our Eyes in the {228} bright\r\nSun, or that it might be some dust in the Aire.\r\n\r\nThe great _Microscope_ being fitted in the day-light for this piece of\r\nFish, we examin'd it that night, and it yielded no light at all, either by\r\nthe view of the Glass, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nFinding it dry, I thought that the moisture of Spittle, and touching of it,\r\nmight cause it to shine: and so it did, though but a very little, in a few\r\nsmall sparks, which soon extinguish'd. This we saw with the bare eye; not\r\nin the Glass.\r\n\r\nThe Fish were not yet fetide, nor insipid to the best discerning palats:\r\nAnd I caused two Fish to be kept for further Tryal, two or three days\r\nlonger, till they were fetide in very hot weather; and then I expected more\r\nbrightness, but could find none, either in the water, by stirring it, or in\r\nthe Fish, taken out of the water.\r\n\r\nAnd some Trials I made afterwards with other boyl'd Mackrels (as is above\r\nsaid) with like pickle, but failed of the like success.\r\n\r\nThis season serves for many Trials in this kind, and by better\r\n_Microscopes_, or better ordered. And in these Vulgarities we may perhaps\r\nas well trace out the cause and nature of Light, as in Jewels of greatest\r\nvalue, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Considerations touching a Letter in the _Journal des Scavans_ of _May\r\n24. 1666_._\r\n\r\nIn _Num._ 9. of these _Transactions_ were publish'd the _Schemes_ and\r\n_Descriptions_ of certain Ways of _Sounding the Depth of the Sea without a\r\nLine_; and of _Fetching up Water from the bottom of it_; together with some\r\nExperiments already made with the former of these two Contrivances. The\r\nAuthor of the French _Journal des Scavans_ found good, to insert them both\r\nin his _Journal_ of _May_ 3. but in another of _May_ 24. intimates, that\r\nthe said _Schemes_ and their _Descriptions_ are not very clear and\r\nintelligible (he means, that they were not well understood by _French_\r\nReaders) proposing also some Difficulties, relating to that Subject, and\r\nesteemed by him necessary to be satisfied, before any use could be made of\r\nthe said Instruments.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion, the Author of these _Tracts_ thinks fit, here to\r\nrepresent, {229}\r\n\r\n_First_, That _Englishmen_ and such others, as are well versed in the\r\n_English_ tongue, find no difficulty in understanding the descriptions of\r\nthese _Engines_, nor in apprehending their structure, exhibited by the\r\n_Figures_, especially if notice be taken of the Emendation, expressed at\r\nthe end of _Num._ 10. about the misgraving the _Bended end_ of the\r\n_Springing Wire_ (which it seems has not been noted in _France_, tho' the\r\nsaid _Num._ 10 is known to have been seen there a pretty while before their\r\n_Journal_ of _May_ 24. was publish'd). And as for the particular of the\r\n_Bucket_, fetching water from the bottom of the Sea, both the _Figure_ and\r\nthe annexed _Description_ thereof are so plain and clear, that 'tis some\r\nwonder here, that any difficulty of understanding them is pretended by any,\r\nthat hath but ordinary skill in _Cutts_ and the _English_ language. Mean\r\nwhile, that way, which the _French_ Author recommends for this purpose as\r\nmore simple, _Videl. a Brass-Pump with double Valves_, is not at all\r\nunknown in _England_, nor has bin left untried there; but was found\r\ninconvenient, in respect that the Valves in descending did not fully open,\r\nand give the water a free passage through the Cavity of the Vessel, nor in\r\nascending shut so close, as to hinder the water from coming in at the top:\r\nWhereas by the way proposed in _Num._ 9. both is perform'd with great ease\r\nand security.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, Whereas the _French_ Author is of opinion, that 'tis unknown,\r\nhow much time a Heavy Body requires to sink in water, according to a\r\ncertain depth; he may please to take notice, that that hath been made out\r\nin _England_ by frequent Experiments; by which, several Depths, found by\r\nthis Method of sounding _without_ a Line, were examin'd by trying them over\r\nagain in _the same_ place _with_ a Line, after the common way. And as to\r\nthat _Quære_ of his, Whether a heavy Body descends in the same _Proportion_\r\nof swiftness in _Water_, that it would do in _Air_? The Answer is, that it\r\ndoes not; but that, after it is sunk one or two fathoms into the Water, it\r\nhas there arrived to its greatest swiftness, and keeps, after that, an\r\nequal degree of velocity; the _Resistance_ of the water being then found\r\nequal to the _Endeavour_ of the heavy Body downwards.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, When the same _Author_ alledges that it must be known, when a\r\nLight Body reascends from the bottom of the water to {230} the top, in what\r\nproportion of time and swiftness it rises. He seems not to have considered,\r\nthat in this Experiment, the times of the descent and assent are both taken\r\nand computed together; so that for this purpose, there needs not that\r\nnicety, he discourses of.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, Whereas it is further excepted, That this way of Sounding\r\nDepths is no new Invention; The answer is ready, that neither is it\r\npretended to be so, in the often quoted _Tract_; it being only intimated\r\nthere, that the manner of performing it, as it is in that place represented\r\nand described, is new.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, To rectifie the said Author's mistake, as if the instrument of\r\nfetching up Water from the bottom of the Sea, were chiefly contriv'd, to\r\nfind out, Whether in some places of the Sea any _Sweet_ Water is to be met\r\nwith at the bottom: There will need no more, than to direct him to the Book\r\nit self _Num._ 9. where p. 149. towards the end, the _First_ use of this\r\n_Bucket_ is express'd to be, to know the _degrees of Saltness_ of the Water\r\naccording to its nearness to the top or bottom; or rather to know the\r\nconstitution of the Sea-water in several depths of several _Climates_,\r\nwhich is a matter, much better to be found out by _Trial_, than\r\n_Discourse_. Neither is it any where argued in that Book (as the _French\r\nJournal_ insinuates) that, because sweet water is found at the Bottom of\r\nthe Sea of _Baharem_, therefore it _must_, but only that it _may_, be found\r\nso elsewhere. And since the same _Journal_ admits, that those Sweet\r\nwater-springs, which yield the sweet water, that is found at the said\r\nplace, have been formerly on the _Continent_, far enough from the Sea,\r\nwhich hath afterwards covered them. It will be, it is presumed, lawful to\r\nask, Why in many other places there may not be found the like? And besides,\r\nhow we do know, but that there may be in other parts, Eruptious of large\r\nSprings at the bottom of the Sea, as well as there?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted with Licence for _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to\r\nthe Royal-Society. 1666.\r\n\r\n{231}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 14.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _July_ 2. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _An Account of a _New_ kind of _Baroscope_, which may be call'd\r\n    _Statical_; and of some Advantages and Conveniencies it hath above the\r\n    _Mercurial_; communicated by Mr. _Boyle_.

Phil. Transactions._]\r\n\r\nAs for the _New_ kind of _Baroscopes_, which, not long agoe, * I intimated\r\nto you, that my haste would not permit me to give you an account off; since\r\nyour Letters acquaint me, that you still design a Communicating to the\r\n{232} Curious as much Information, as may be, in reference to _Baroscopes_;\r\nI shall venture to send you some Account of what I did but name (in my\r\nformer Letter) to you.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _The Scales here meant were before competent Eyewitnesses made\r\nto turn manifestly with the thousandth part of a grain._]\r\n\r\nThough by a Passage, you may meet with in the 19th and 20th Pages of my\r\n_Thermometrical Experiments and Thoughts_, you may find, that I did some\r\nyears agoe think upon this New kind of Baroscope; yet the Changes of the\r\nAtmosphere's Weight not happening to be then such, as I wish'd, and being\r\nunwilling to deprive my self of all other use of the exactest Ballance *,\r\nthat I (or perhaps any man) ever had, I confess to you, that successive\r\navocations put this attempt for two or three years out of my thoughts; till\r\nafterwards returning to a place, where I chanc'd to find two or three pairs\r\nof Scales, I had left there, the sight of them brought it into my mind; and\r\nthough I were then unable to procure exacter, yet my desire to make the\r\nExperiment some amends for so long a neglect, put me upon considering, that\r\nif I provided a _Glass-buble_, more than ordinary large and light, even\r\nsuch Ballances, as those, might in some measure perform, what I had tried\r\nwith the strangely nice ones above-mention'd.\r\n\r\nI caused then to be blown at the Flame of a Lamp some _Glass-bubles_ as\r\nlarge, thin and light, as I could then procure, and choosing among them,\r\none, that seem'd the least unfit for my turn, I counterpoised it in a pair\r\nof Scales, that would loose their _Æquilibrium_ with about the 30th part of\r\na Grain, and were suspended at a Frame. I placed both the Ballance and the\r\nFrame by a good Baroscope, from whence I might learn the present weight of\r\nthe Atmosphere. Then leaving these Instruments together; though the Scales,\r\nbeing no nicer than I have express'd, were not able to shew me all the\r\nVariations of the Air's weight that appear'd in the _Mercurial_ Baroscope,\r\nyet they did what I expected, by shewing me variations no greater, than\r\nalter'd the height of Quicksilver half a quarter of an Inch, and perhaps\r\nmuch smaller than those: Nor did I doubt, that, if I had had either tender\r\nScales, or the means of supplying the experiment with convenient\r\naccommodations, I should have {233} discerned far smaller Alterations of\r\nthe Weight of the Air, since I had the pleasure to see the Buble sometimes\r\nin an _æquilibrium_ with the counterpoise; sometimes, when the Atmosphere\r\nwas high, preponderate so manifestly, that the Scales being gently stirr'd,\r\nthe Cock would play altogether on that side, at which the Buble was hung;\r\nand at other times (when the Air was heavier) that, which was at the first\r\nbut the Counterpoise, would preponderate, and, upon the motion or the\r\nBallance, make the Cock vibrate altogether on its side. And this would\r\ncontinue sometimes many daies together, if the Air so long retain'd the\r\nsame measure of gravity; and then (upon other changes) the Buble would\r\nregain an _æquilibrium_, or a preponderance; so that I had oftentimes the\r\nsatisfaction, by looking first upon the _Statical_ Baroscope (as for\r\ndistinctions sake it may be call'd) to foretell, whether in the _Mercurial_\r\nBaroscope the Liquor were high or low. Which Observations though they hold\r\nas well in Winter, and several times in Summer (for I was often absent\r\nduring that season) as the Spring, yet the frequency of their Vicissitudes\r\n(which perhaps was but accidental) made them more pleasant in the latter of\r\nthese seasons.\r\n\r\nSo that, the matter of Fact having been made out by variety of repeated\r\nObservations, and by sometimes comparing severall of those new _Baroscopes_\r\ntogether, I shall add some of those Notes about this Instrument, which\r\nreadily occur to my memory, reserving the rest till another opportunity.\r\n\r\nAnd _First_, if the ground, on which I went in framing this _Baroscope_, be\r\ndemanded, the answer in short may be; 1. That, though the Glass-buble, and\r\nthe Glass-counterpoise, at the time of their first being weigh'd, be in the\r\nAir, wherein they both are weigh'd, exactly of the same weight; yet they\r\nare nothing near of the same bulk; the Buble, by reason of its capacious\r\ncavity (which contains nothing but Air, or something that weighs less than\r\nAir) being perhaps a hundred or two hundred times (for I have not\r\nconveniency to measure them) bigger than the Metalline counterpoise. 2.\r\nThat according to a _Hydrostatical_ Law (which you know I have lately had\r\noccasion to make out) If two Bodies of equal gravity, but unequal bulk come\r\nto be weigh'd in another _Medium_, they will be no longer {234}\r\nequiponderant; but if the new _Medium_ be heavier, the greater Body, as\r\nbeing lighter in _Specie_, will loose more of its weight, than the lesser\r\nand more compact; but if the new _Medium_ be lighter than the first, then\r\nthe bigger Body will outweigh the lesser; And this disparity, arising from\r\nthe change of _Medium's_, will be so much the greater, by how much the\r\ngreater inequality of bulk there is between the Bodies formerly\r\nequiponderant. 3. That, laying these two together, I consider'd, that\r\n'twould be all one, as to the effect to be produced, whether the Bodies\r\nwere weighed in _Mediums_ of differing gravity, or in the same _Medium_, in\r\ncase its (_specifick_) gravity were considerably alter'd: And consequently,\r\nthat since it appear'd by the _Baroscope_, that the weight of the Air was\r\nsometimes heavier, and sometimes lighter, the alterations of it, in point\r\nof gravity, from the weight, it was off at first counterpoising of the\r\nBuble of it, would _unequally_ affect so large and hollow a Body, as the\r\nBuble, and so small and dense a one, as a Metallin weight: And when the Air\r\nby an increase of gravity should become a heavier _Medium_, than before, it\r\nwould buoy up the Glass more than the Counterpoise; and if it grew lighter,\r\nthan it was at first, would suffer the former to preponderate: (The\r\nIllustrations and Proof can scarce be added in few words; but, if it be\r\ndesired, I may, God permitting, send you them at my next leasure:) And\r\nthough our English Air be about a thousand times lighter, than water, the\r\ndifference in weight of so little Air, as is but equal in bulk to a Buble,\r\nseem'd to give small hopes, that it would be sensible upon a Ballance; yet,\r\nby making the Buble very large and light, I supposed and found the Event, I\r\nhave already related.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, The hermetically seal'd Glass-buble, I employed, was of the\r\nbigness of a somewhat large _Orange_, and weigh'd about 1. drachme and 10.\r\ngrains. But I thought it very possible, if I had been better furnish'd with\r\nconveniencies (wherein I afterwards found, I was not mistaken) to make\r\n(among many, that might be expected to miscarry) some, that might be\r\npreferable to this, either for capacity or lightness, or both; especially\r\nif care be taken, that they be not seal'd up, whilst they are too hot. For,\r\nthough one would think, that it were {235} advantagious to rarify and drive\r\nout the Air as much as is possible, because in such seal'd Bubles the Air\r\nit self (as I have elsewhere shewn) has a weight; yet this advantage\r\ncountervails not the inconvenience of being obliged to increase the weight\r\nof the Glass, which when it includes highly rarified Air, if it be not\r\nsomewhat strong, will be broken by the pressure of the External Air, as I\r\nhave sufficiently tryed.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, I would have tryed, whether the _Dryness_ and _Moisture_ of the\r\nAir would in any measure have alter'd the weight of the Buble, as well as\r\nthe Variation of Gravity produced in the _Atmosphere_ by other causes; but\r\nthe extraordinarily constant absence of Fogs, kept me from making\r\nObservations of this kind; save that one morning early, being told of a\r\nmist, I sent to see (being my self in bed) whether it made the Air so heavy\r\nas to buoy up the Buble; but did not learn, that that mist had any sensible\r\noperation on it.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, By reason of the difficulties and casualties, that may happen\r\nabout the procuring and preserving such large and light Bubles, as I have\r\nbeen lately mentioning; it may in some cases prove a convenience to be\r\ninform'd, That I have sometimes, instead of one sufficiently large Buble,\r\nmade use of two, that were smaller. And, though a single Buble of competent\r\nbignes be much preferable, by reason that a far less quantity and weight of\r\nGlass is requisite to comprise an equal capacity, when the Glass is blown\r\ninto a single Buble, than when it is divided into two; yet I found, that\r\nthe employing of two instead of one, did not so ill answer my\r\nexspectations, but that they may for a need serve the turn instead of the\r\nother; than which they are more easier to be procured; And if the Ballance\r\nbe strong enough to bear so much Glass, without being injur'd: by employing\r\ntwo or a greater number of large Bubles, the effect may be more\r\nconspicuous, than if only a single Buble (though a very good one) were\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThis instrument may be much improved by divers Accommodations, As\r\n\r\n_First_, There may be fitted to the _Ansa_ (or Checks of the Ballance) an\r\nArch (of a Circle) divided into 15. or 20. deg. (more or less, according to\r\nthe goodness of the Ballance) that the Cock resting over against these\r\nDivisions, may readily {236} and without Calculation shew the quantity of\r\nthe Angle, by which, when the scales propend either way, the Cock declines\r\nfrom the Perpendicular, and the beam from its Horizontall parallelism.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, Those, that will be so curious, may, instead of the Ordinary\r\nCounterpoise (of Brass) employ one of Gold, or at least of Lead, whereof\r\nthe _latter_ being of equal weight with Brass, is much less in Bulk, and\r\nthe _former_ amounts not to half its bigness.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, These parts of the Ballance, that may be made of Copper or\r\nBrass, without any prejudice to the exactness, will, by being made of one\r\nof those Mettals, be less subject, than Steel, (which yet, if well hardned\r\nand polish'd, may last good a great while) to rust with long standing.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, Instead of the scales, the Buble may be hung at one end of the\r\nBeam, and only a Counterpoise to it at the other, that the Beam may not be\r\nburthen'd with unnecessary weight.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, The whole instrument, if placed in a small Frame, like a square\r\nLanthorn with Glass-windows, and a hole at the top for the Commerce of the\r\ninternal and external Air, will be more free from dust, and irregular\r\nagitations; to the latter of which, it will otherwise be sometimes\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly_, This instrument being accommodated with a light Wheele and an\r\nIndex (such as have been applyed by the excellent Dr. _Chr. Wren_ to open\r\nWeather glasses, and by the ingenious Mr. _Hook_ to _Baroscopes_) may be\r\nmade to shew much more minute variations, than otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Seventhly_, And the length of the Beam, and exquisitness of the Ballance,\r\nmay easily, _without_ any of the foregoing helps (and much more _with_\r\nthem) make the instrument far exacter, than any of those, I was reduced to\r\nemploy. And to these Accommodations divers others may be suggested by a\r\nfarther consideration of the nature of the thing, and a longer practice.\r\n\r\nThough in some respects this _Statical_ Baroscope be inferior to the\r\n_Mercurial_; yet in others it has its own advantages and conveniencies\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nAnd 1: It confirms _ad oculum_ our former Doctrine, that the falling and\r\nrising of the _Mercury_ depends upon the varying weight of the Atmosphere;\r\nsince in this Baroscope it cannot {237} be pretended, that a _Fuga vacui_,\r\nor a _Funiculus_, is the cause of the changes, we observe. 2. It shews,\r\nthat not only the Air has weight, but a more considerable one, than some\r\nLearned men, who will allow me to have prov'd, it has some weight, will\r\nadmit; since even the variation of weight in so small a quantity of Air, as\r\nis but equal in bulk to an _Orange_, is manifestly discoverable upon such\r\nBalances, as are none of the nicest. 3. This _Statical_ Baroscope will\r\noftentimes be more parable, than the other: For many will finde it more\r\neasie, to procure a good pair of Gold-scales, and a Buble or two, than a\r\nlong Cane seal'd, a quantity of _Quick-silver_, and all the other requisits\r\nof the _Mercurial_ Baroscope; especially if we comprise the trouble and\r\nskill, that is requisite to free the deserted part of the Tube from Air. 4.\r\nAnd whereas the difficulty of removing the _Mercurial_ Instrument has kept\r\nmen from so much as attempting to do it, even to neighbouring places; the\r\nEssential parts of the _Scale_-Baroscope (for the Frame is none of them)\r\nmay very easily in a little room be carried, whither one will, without the\r\nhazard of being spoil'd or injur'd. 5. There is not in _Statical_\r\nBaroscopes, as in the other, a danger of uncertainty, as to the goodness of\r\nthe Instruments, by reason, that in _these_ the Air is, in some more, and\r\nin some less perfectly excluded; whereas in _those_, that consideration has\r\nno place. (And by the way, I have sometimes, upon this account, been able\r\nto discover by our new Baroscope, that an esteem'd _Mercurial_ one, to\r\nwhich I compared it, was not well freed from Air.) 6. It being, as I\r\nformerly intimated, very possible to discover _Hydrostatically_, both the\r\nbigness of the Buble, and the Contents of the cavity, and the weight and\r\ndimensions of the Glassie substance (which together with the included Air\r\nmake up the Buble,) much may be discover'd by this Instrument, as to the\r\nWeight of the Air, _absolute_ or _respective_. For, when the _Quick-silver_\r\nin the _Mercurial_ Baroscope is either very high, or very low, or at a\r\nmiddle station between its greatest and least height, bringing the\r\n_Scale_-Barometer to an exact _Æquilibrium_ (1 with very minute divisions\r\nof a Graine,) you may, by watchfully observing, when the _Mercury_ is risen\r\nor faln just an inch, or a fourth, of half an inch &c. and putting in the\r\nlike minute divisions of a Grain to the lighter Scale, till you have again\r\nbrought the Ballance to an {238} exquisit _Æquilibrium_; you may, I say,\r\ndetermine, What known weight in the _Statical_ Baroscope answers such\r\ndeterminate Altitudes of the ascending and descending Quick-silver in the\r\n_Mercurial_. And if the Ballance be accommodated with a divided Arch, or a\r\nWheel and Index, these Observations will assist you for the future to\r\ndetermine readily, by seeing the inclination of the Cock or the degree\r\nmark'd by the Index, what pollency the Buble hath, by the change of the\r\n_Atmospheres_ weight, acquired or lost. Some Observations of this nature I\r\nwatchfully made, sometimes putting in a 64^{th.} sometimes a 32^{th.}\r\nsometimes a 16^{th.} and sometimes heavier parts of a Grain, to the lighter\r\nScale. But one, that knew not, for what uses those little papers were,\r\ncoming to a window, where my Baroscopes stood, so unluckily shook them out\r\nof the Scales, and confounded them, that he robb'd me of the opportunity of\r\nmaking the nice Observations I intended, though I had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing, that they were to be made. 7. By this _Statical_ Instrument we may\r\nbe assisted to compare the _Mercurial_ Baroscopes of _several_ places\r\n(though never so distant) and to make some Estimates of the Gravities of\r\nthe Air therein. As if, for instance, I have found by Observation, that the\r\nBuble, I employ, (and one may have divers Bubles of several sizes, that the\r\none may repaire any mischance, that may happen to another) weigh'd just a\r\nDrachme, when the _Mercurial_ Cylinder was at the height of 29½ inches\r\n(which in some places I have found a _moderate_ altitude;) and that the\r\nAddition of the 16th part of a gr. is requisite to keep the Buble in an\r\n_Æquilibrium_, when the _Mercury_ is risen an 8th, or any determinate part\r\nof an inch above the former station: When I come to another place, where\r\nthere is a _Mercurial_ Barometer, as well freed from Air as mine (for that\r\nmust be supposed) if taking out my _Scale_ instrument, it appeare to weigh\r\nprecisely a Drachme, and the _Mercury_ in the Baroscope there stand at just\r\n29½ inches, we may conclude the Gravity of the Atmosphere not to be\r\nsensibly unequal in both those two places, though very distant. And though\r\nthere be no Baroscope there, yet if there be an additional weight, as for\r\ninstance, the 16th part of a Grain requisite to be added to the Buble, to\r\nbring the scales to an _Æquilibrium_, it will appear that the Air at this\r\nsecond place is, at that time {239} so much heavier, than the Air of the\r\nformer place was, when the _Mercury_ stood at 29½ inches.\r\n\r\nBut in making such comparisons, we must not forget to consider the\r\nSituation of the several places, if we mean to make Estimates not only of\r\nthe weight of the Atmosphere, but of the weight and density of the Air.\r\nFor, though the Scales wil shew (as has been said) whether there be a\r\ndifference of weight in the Atmosphere at the two places; yet, if one of\r\nthem be in a Vale or bottom, and the other on the top or some elevated part\r\nof a Hill, it is not to be exspected, that the Atmosphere, in this latter\r\nplace, should gravitate as much, as the Atmosphere in the former, on which\r\na longer Pillar of Air does lean or weigh.\r\n\r\nAnd the mention, I have made of the differing Situation of Places, puts me\r\nin mind of something, that may prove another use of our _Statical_\r\nBaroscope, and which I had thoughts of making tryal off, but was\r\nAccidentally hindred from the opportunity of doing it. Namely, that by\r\nexactly poysing the Buble at the foot of a high Steeple or Hill, and\r\ncarrying it in its close Frame to the top, one may, by the weight requisite\r\nto be added to Counterpoise there to bring the Beam to its Horizontal\r\nposition, observe the difference of the weight of the Air at the bottom,\r\nand at the top; and, in case the Hill be high enough, at some intermediate\r\nStations. But how far this may assist men, to estimate the _Absolute_ or\r\n_Comparative_ height of Mountains, and other elevated Places; and what\r\nother Uses the Instrument may be put to, when it is duly improved; and the\r\nCautions, that may be requisite in the several cases, that shall be\r\nproposed, I must leave to more leasure, and farther Consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Particulars of those Observations of the Planet _Mars_, formerly\r\nintimated to have been made at _London_ in the Months of _February_ and\r\n_March_ A._ 1665/6.\r\n\r\nTo perform, what was promised _Num._ 11. of these Papers, _pag._ 198; 'tis\r\nthought fit now to publish the Particular Observations, concerning the\r\nspots in _Mars_, and their motion, as they were made with a 36 foot\r\nTelescope, and produced in {240} writing before the _Royal Society_, the 28\r\n_March_ 1666. by Mr. _Hook_, as follows;\r\n\r\nHaving a great desire (saith he) to observe the Body of _Mars_, whilst\r\n_Acronycal_ and _Retrograde_ (having formerly with a Glass of about 12.\r\nfoot long, observ'd some kind of Spots in the Face of it,) though it be not\r\nat present in the _Perihelium_ of its Orbe, but nearer its _Aphelium_, yet\r\nI found, that the Face of it, when neer its Opposition to the Sun (with a\r\nCharge, the 36. foot-glass, I made use off, would well bear) appear'd very\r\nnear as big, as that of the Moon to the _naked_ eye; which I found, by\r\ncomparing it with the Full Moon, near adjoyning to it, _March_ 10.\r\n\r\nBut such had been the ill disposition of the Air for several nights, that\r\nfrom more than 20. Observations of it, which I had made since its being\r\n_Retrograde_, I could find nothing of satisfaction, though I often\r\nimagin'd, I saw Spots, yet the _Inflective veins_ of the Air (if I may so\r\ncall those parts, which, being interspers'd up and down in it, have a\r\ngreater or less Refractive power, than the Air next adjoyning, with which\r\nthey are mixt) did make it so confus'd and glaring, that I could not\r\nconclude upon any thing.\r\n\r\nOn the third of _March_, though the Air were still bad enough yet I could\r\nsee now and then the Body of _Mars_ appearing of the form A: which I\r\npresently described by a _Scheme_; and about 10. minutes after, as exactly\r\nrepresenting what I saw through the Glass, as I could, I drew the _Scheme_\r\nB. This I was sufficiently satisfied (by very often observing it through\r\nthe Tube, and changing my Eye into various positions, that so there might\r\nbe no kind of Fallacy in it) could be nothing else, but some more _Dusky_\r\nand _Spotted_ parts of the Face of this Planet.\r\n\r\n_March_ 10. finding the Air very bad, I made use of a very shallow\r\nEye-glass, as finding nothing _Distinct_ with the greater _Charge_; and saw\r\nthe appearance of it as in C, which I imagin'd, might be the Representation\r\nof the former Spots by a lesser charge. About 3 of the Clock the same\r\nmorning, the Air being _very bad_ (though to appearance _exceeding clear_,\r\nand causing all the Stars to twinckle, and the minute Stars to appear very\r\nthick) the body seem'd like _D_; which I still suppos'd to be {241} the\r\nRepresentation of the same Spots through a more confused and glaring Air.\r\n\r\nBut observing _March_ 21. I was surprised to find the Air (though not so\r\nclear, as to the appearance of small Stars) so _exceeding transparent_, and\r\nthe Face of _Mars_ so very well _defined_, and round, and distinct, that I\r\ncould manifestly see it of the shape in E. about half an hour after Nine at\r\nnight. The _Triangular_ spot on the right side (as it was inverted by the\r\nTelescope, according to the appearances, through with all the preceeding\r\n_Figures_ are drawn) appear'd very black and distinct, the other towards\r\nthe left more dim; but both of them sufficiently plain and defin'd. About a\r\nquarter before 12. of the Clock the same night, I observ'd it again with\r\nthe same Glass, and found the appearance exactly, as in F; which I imagin'd\r\nto shew me a _Motion_ of the former triangular spot: But designing to\r\nobserve it again about 3. of the Clock the same Morning, I was hindred by\r\ncloudy weather.\r\n\r\nBut _March_ 22. about half an hour after 8. at night, finding the same\r\nSpots in the same posture, I concluded, that the preceeding Observation was\r\nonly the appearance of the same Spots at another height and thickness of\r\nthe Air: And thought my self confirm'd in this Opinion, by finding them in\r\nmuch the same posture, _March_ 23. about half an hour after 9. though the\r\nAir was nothing so good as before.\r\n\r\nAnd though I desired to make Observations, about 3. of the Clock those\r\nmornings; yet something or other interven'd, that hindred me, till _March_\r\n28. about 3 of the Clock, the Air being light (in weight) though moist and\r\na little hazy; when I plainly saw it, to have the form, represented in I;\r\nwhich is not reconcileable with the other Appearances, unless we allow a\r\n_Turbinated_ motion of _Mars_ upon its Center: Which, if such there be,\r\nfrom the Observations made _March_ 21. 22. and 23. we may guess it to be\r\nonce or twice in about 24. hours unless it may have some kind of\r\n_Librating_ motion; which seems not so likely. Now, whether certainly so or\r\nnot, I shall endeavour, as oft as I have opportunity, further to observe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA particular direction to the _Figures_ mentioned in the precedent\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nA. _March _3^{d.} 00^{h.} 20^{m.}_ in the morning: the Air having many\r\n{242} inflecting parts dispersed up and down in it; by the _Wheel\r\nBarometer_, heavy,_\r\n\r\nB. _Another Scheme, which I drew from my Observation, about 10. minutes\r\nafter, the same morning.

DOMINICO CASSINO\r\nhabitæ;_ come to hand _June_ 3. 1666.\r\n\r\nIn these Papers the Excellent _Cassini_ affirms;\r\n\r\n1. That with a _Telescope_ of 24. _Palmes_, or of about 16 _Foot_, wrought\r\nafter S. _Campani's_ way, he began to observe _February_ 6. 1666 (st.n.) in\r\nthe morning, and saw two dark Spots in the _first_ Face of _Mars._ {243}\r\n\r\n2. That with the same Glass he observ'd _Febr._ 14/24. in the Evening, in\r\nthe _other_ Face of this Planet, two other Spots, like those of the first,\r\nbut bigger.\r\n\r\n3. That afterwards continuing the Observations, he found the Spots of these\r\ntwo Faces to turn by little and little from _East_ to _West_, and to return\r\nat last to the same situation, wherein he had seen them first.\r\n\r\n4. That S. _Campani_, having also observ'd at _Rome_ with Glasses of 50.\r\n_Palmes_ or about 35 _Foot_, likewise of his own contrivance, had seen in\r\nthe same Planet the same _Phenomena_.\r\n\r\n5. That sometimes he hath seen, during the same night, the two Faces of\r\n_Mars_, one, in the Evening, the other in the Morning.\r\n\r\n6. That the Motion of these Spots in the inferior part of the apparent\r\nHemisphere of _Mars_, is made from _East_ to _West_, as that of all the\r\nother Celestial Bodies, and is peform'd by Parallels, that decline _much_\r\nfrom the _Equator_, and _little_ from the _Ecliptick_.\r\n\r\n7. That the Spots return the next day to the same situation, 40. minuts\r\nlater, than the day before; so that in every 36. or 37. daies, about the\r\nsame hour, they come again to the same place.\r\n\r\n8. He promises shortly to give us the particular _Tables_ of this Motion\r\nand of its Inequalities, together with the _Ephemerides_ themselves.\r\n\r\n9. He represents, that some other _Astronomers_ have also made at _Rome_\r\nseveral Observations of these Spots of _Mars_, from _March 14/24._ to\r\n_March 20/30._ with Glasses, wrought by _Eustachio Divini_, of 25. and 45.\r\nPalmes; Which Spots he makes little differing from his own, of the first\r\nFace; as will by and by appear, by the direction to the _Schemes_.\r\n\r\n10. But he adds, that those other _Roman_ Astronomers, that have observ'd\r\nwith _Divini's_ Glasses, will have the Conversion of _Mars_ to be\r\nperformed, not in 24 h, 40 m. (as he maintains it is) but in about 13 h.\r\n\r\n11. And to evince, that they are mistaken in these Observations of theirs;\r\nhe alledges, That they assure that the Spots, which they have seen in this\r\nPlanet, (by an _Eustachian_ Telescope) the 20/30 of _March_, were small,\r\nvery distant from one another, remote from the middle of the Disk, and the\r\n_Oriental_ Spot was less, than the _Occidental_ (as is represented by the\r\nFig. O; like that of the first Face of _Mars_.) whereas, on the contrary,\r\n{244} He (_Cassini_) pretends to evidence by his Observations, made at the\r\nsame time at _Bononia_, that, the same day and hour, those Spots were very\r\nlarge, neer one another, in the midst of the Disk, the Oriental bigger than\r\nthe Occidental (as appears by _Fig._ P, which is that of the second Face of\r\n_Mars_.)\r\n\r\n12. Besides, he declares, that those _Astronomers_ were too hasty, in\r\ndetermining, after 5 or 6 Observations only, in how much time _Mars_\r\nfinish's his Revolution; and denies it to be perform'd in 13 hours: adding,\r\nthat, though Himself had observ'd for a much longer time, than they; yet he\r\ndurst not for a great while define, Whether _Mars_ made but _one_ Turn in\r\n24 hours 40 minuts or _two_; and that all, that he could, for a long time\r\naffirm, was onely this, that after 24 h. 40 m. this Planet appear'd in the\r\nsame manner he did before.\r\n\r\n13. But since those first Observations, He affirms to have found cause to\r\ndetermine, that the Period of this Conversion is made in the said space of\r\n24 h. 40 m; and not oftner than once within that time; Alledging for proof;\r\n\r\n1. That, whereas _Febr._ 6. (st.n.) he saw the Spots of the first Face of\r\n_Mars_, moving from eleven of the Clock in the night, until break of day,\r\nthey appear'd not afterwards in the Evening after the rising of that Planet\r\n(witness several intelligent persons, which he names, that were present at\r\nthe Observations) Whence he infers, that after 12 hours and 20 minuts, the\r\nsame Spots did not come about; since that the same, which in the morning\r\nwere seen in the middle, upon the rising of _Mars_; after 13 or 14 hours,\r\nmight have appear'd neer the Occidental Limb. But, because he might be\r\nimposed upon by Vapors, whilst _Mars_ was yet so neer the _Horizon_, he\r\ngives this other determination, _vid._\r\n\r\n2. Whereas he saw the first Face of _Mars_ the 6 of _February_ at 11 of the\r\nclock of the night following; he did not see the same after 18 daies at the\r\nsame hour; as he ought to have done, if the Period were absolved in the\r\nspace of 12 h. 20 m.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3. Again, whereas he saw _Febr._ 24. in the Evening, the other Face of\r\n_Mars_, he could not see the same, the 13. and 15. day of _March_, to wit\r\nafter 17 and 19 days; as he should have done, if the Revolution were made\r\nin the newly mention'd time.\r\n\r\n4. Again, whereas the 27. of _March_ in the Evening he saw {245} the second\r\nFace of _Mars_, he could not see it the 14. and 16. of _April_.\r\n\r\nFrom all which Observations he Judges it to be evident, that the Period of\r\nthis Planets Revolution is not perform'd in the space of 12. hours 20,\r\nminutes, but in about 24 hours 40 minutes; more exactly to be determin'd by\r\ncomparing distant Observations: And that those who affirm the former, must\r\nhave been deceived by not well distinguishing the two Faces, but that\r\nhaving seen the second, taken it for the first.\r\n\r\nAll which he concludes with this Advertisement, that, when he defines the\r\ntime of the Revolution of _Mars_, he does not speak of its _Mean_\r\nRevolution, but onely of that, which he observ'd, whilst _Mars_ was\r\nopposite to the Sun; which is the shortest of all.\r\n\r\n    _The Figures of the _Principal_ Observations, represented in the Book\r\n    here discoursed of, may be seen in the annexed _Scheme_; _videl.__\r\n\r\nK. _One of the Faces of _Mars_, as S. _Cassini_ observed it _March 3.\r\n(_st.n._) 1666_ in the Evening, with a Glass of 24 Palmes._\r\n\r\nL. _The other Face, as he saw it _Febr. 14/24_ in the Evening._\r\n\r\nM. _The first Face, as S. _Campani_ saw at Rome, _March 3. 1666_. in the\r\nEvening, with a Glass of 50 Palmes._\r\n\r\nN. _The second Face, as the same _Campani_ observed it _March 18/28_. in\r\nthe Evening._\r\n\r\nO. _The figure of _Mars_ as it was seen at _Rome_ by a Telescope of\r\n_Divini_ of 45 Palmes, _March 20/30_._\r\n\r\nP. _The Figure of the said Planet, as it was seen the same day and hour at\r\nBononia by _Cassini_; being that of the second Face._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Observations lately made at _London_ concerning the Planet\r\n_Jupiter_._\r\n\r\nThese, as they were made, so they were imparted, by Mr. _Hook_, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA. 1666, _June_ 26. between 3. and 4. of the Clock in the morning, I\r\nobserved the Body of _Jupiter_ through a 60 foot-glass, and found the\r\napparent Diameter of it through the Tube, to be somewhat more than 2.\r\ndegrees, that is, about four {246} times as big, as the Diameter of the\r\n_Moon_ appears to the _naked_ Eye. I saw the Limb pretty round, and very\r\nwell defin'd without radiation. The parts of the _Phasis_ of it had various\r\ndegrees of Light. About a and f, the _North_ and _South_ poles of it (in\r\nthe _Fig Q._) 'twas somewhat darker, and by degrees it grew brighter\r\ntowards b. and e, two Belts or Zones; the one of which (b) was a small dark\r\n_Belt_ crossing the Body Southward; Adjoyning to which was a smal Line of a\r\nsomewhat lighter part; and below that again, Southwards, was the great\r\nblack _Belt c_. Between that, and e, the other smaller black Belt, was a\r\npretty large and bright _Zone_; but the middle d, was somewhat darker than\r\nthe edges. I perceiv'd about 3^{h.} 15^{m.} near the middle of this, a very\r\n_dark round Spot_, like that represented at g, which was not to be\r\nperceiv'd about half an hour before: And I observed it, in about 10.\r\nminutes time to be gotten almost to d, keeping equal distance from the\r\n_Satelles h_, which moved also Westwardly, and was joyn'd to the Disk at i,\r\nat 3^{h.} 25^{m.} After which, the Air growing very hazy, and (as appeared\r\nby the _Baroscope_) very light also (in weight) I could not observe it: So\r\nthat it was sufficiently evident, that this black Spot was nothing else,\r\nsave the shadow of the _Satelles h_, Eclipsing a part of the Face of\r\nJupiter. About two hours before, I had observed a large darker spot in the\r\nbigger _Belt_ about k, which in about an hour or little more (for I did not\r\nexactly observe the time, nor draw the _Figure_ of it) moving Westwards,\r\ndisappear'd. About a week before, I discover'd also, together with a Spot\r\nin the _Belt c_, another Spot in the _Belt e_, which kept the same way and\r\nvelocity with that of the _Belt c_. The other three _Satellites_ in the\r\ntime of this Eclipse, made by the _Satelles_, were Westwards of the Body of\r\n_Jupiter_; appearing as bright through the Tube, as the Body of _Jupiter_\r\ndid to the naked Eye, and I was able to see them longer through the Tube,\r\nafter the day-light came on, than I was able to see the Body of _Jupiter_\r\nwith my naked eye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A late Observation about Saturn made by the same._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_June_ 29 1666. between 11. and 12. at night I observed the Body of\r\n_Saturn_ through a 60. foot Telescope, and found it {247} exactly of the\r\nshape represented in the _Figure_ R. The _Ring_ appear'd of a somewhat\r\nbrighter Light than the _Body_; and the black lines a a, crossing the Ring,\r\nand b b crossing the Body (whether Shadows or not, I dispute not) were\r\nplainly visible: whence I could manifestly see, that the _Souther_-most\r\npart of the Ring was on _this_ side of the Body, and the _Northern_ part,\r\nbehind, or covered by the Body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of a sad effect of Thunder and Lightning:_\r\n\r\nThis Relation was written by that worthy Gentleman, _Thomas Neale_ Esquire,\r\n(the then _High Sheriff_ of the County of _Hampshire_, when this disaster\r\nhapned) to a Friend of his in _London_, as follows;\r\n\r\nOn the 24 of _January_ 1665/6, one Mr. _Brooks_ of _Hampshire_, going from\r\n_Winchester_ towards his house near _Andover_ in very bad Weather, was\r\nhimself slain by Lightning, and the Horse, he rode on, under him. For about\r\na mile from _Winchester_ he was found with his Face beaten into the ground,\r\none leg in the stirrup, the other in the Horses mane; his Cloaths all burnt\r\noff his back, not a piece as big as a handkerchief left intire, and his\r\nhair and all his body singed. With the force, that struck him down, his\r\nnose was beaten into his face, and his Chin into his Breast; where was a\r\nwound cut almost as low, as to his Navil; and his cloaths being, as\r\naforesaid, torn, the pieces were so scatter'd and consum'd, that not enough\r\nto fill the crown of a hat could be found. His gloves were whole, but his\r\nhands in them sing'd to the bone. The hip-bone and shoulder of his Horse\r\nburn't and bruised; and his saddle torn in little pieces. This was what\r\nappear'd to the Coroners inquest, and so is likely to be as near truth, as\r\nany is to be had.\r\n\r\n_So far this Letter_: Which, if it had come soon enough to the hands of the\r\n_Publisher_, would have been joyned to a like _Relation_, inserted in the\r\nnext foregoing Papers (_Num._ 13.) of an accident hapn'd at a later time.\r\nWith both which may be compared the Account, formerly published in Latin by\r\nthe Learned Dr. _Charleton_, concerning the Boy, that was {248}\r\nThunder-struck near _Nantwich in Cheshire;_ the Title of the Book being\r\n_Anatome Pueride Cælo tacti_: such Relations, when truly made, well\r\ndeserving to be carefully recorded for farther consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of some Books lately publish't._\r\n\r\n_RELATIONS OF DIVERS CURIOUS VOYAGES_, by _Mons. Thevenot_, the third\r\n_Tome_, in _French_. This Book contains chiefly, the Ambassie of the\r\n_Dutch_ into _China_, translated out of the Dutch manuscript: A\r\nGeographical description of _China_, translated out of a Chinese Author by\r\n_Martinius_: And the Account, which the Directors of the Dutch East-India\r\nCompany made to the States General, touching the state of affairs in the\r\nEast-Indies, when their late Fleet parted from thence. To touch some things\r\nof a _Geographical_ and _Philosophical_ nature, contained therein, we shall\r\ntake notice;\r\n\r\n1. How the Kingdom of _China_ is peopled; there being according to the best\r\ncomputation (which is there made with singular care) above 58 millions of\r\nMen, not counting Magistrates, Soldiers, Priests, Eunuchs, Women and\r\nChildren; so that it may not be altogether strange, if one should affirm,\r\nthere were 200 millions of people, of all sorts, in that Kingdom.\r\n\r\n2. That _Catay_ is nothing else, but the _Six_ Northern Provinces of\r\n_China_, separated from the other _Nine_, by the great River _KIANG_; and\r\nthat the City _Cambalu_ is the same with that of _Peking_; the _Tartars_,\r\nwho carry every three years their Tribute to the Emperor of _China_,\r\nconstantly calling the said Provinces and City by those names of _Catay_,\r\nand _Cambalu_.\r\n\r\n3. That _China_ is so well furnisht with Rivers, and cut Channels, that men\r\nmay go from the most Southern to the most Northern part thereof by water,\r\nexcept one daies journey; as the Dutch Ambassadours did, embarking at\r\n_Canton_, which is 23d. 48m. Northern Latitude, and landing at _Peking_,\r\nwhich is about 40d; having only travell'd one daies journey over some\r\nMountains of the Province _Kiamsi_.\r\n\r\n4. That the people of _China_ are exceeding industrious {249} Husbandmen\r\nmaking, among other waies of improving their soile, great use of Flouding.\r\n\r\n5. That the _Physicians_ of _China_ do cure Sicknesses with much ease, and\r\nin a short time: That they have very ancient Books of the nature and\r\nvertues of Herbs, Trees and Stones: That their Modern Physicians (as well\r\nas their Ancient ones did) write of the Prognosticks, Causes, Effects, &c.\r\nof Diseases. That their Remedies consist for the most part of _Simples_ and\r\n_Decoctions_, _Cauteries_, _Frictions_; without the use of _Bloud letting:_\r\nThat they have such an excellent skill and method in feeling the _Pulse_,\r\nthat by the means thereof they discover even the most latent causes of\r\nDiseases; taking a good half hour, when they visit a Patient, in feeling\r\nand examining his Pulse: That they prescribe much the use of _The_; and the\r\ndrinking alwayes warme, whatever they drink: To the custome of both which\r\nit's imputed, that the inhabitants of _China_ do spit very little, nor are\r\nsubject to the Stone or Gout: That they prise highly the Root _Ginseng_, as\r\nan extraordinary Restorative and Cordiall, recovering frequently with it\r\nagonizing persons; one pound of it being paid with 3 pounds of silver. As\r\nfor their _Chymists_, (of which they have also good store) they go beyond\r\nours, promising not only to make Gold, but to give Immortality.\r\n\r\n6. That their _Nobility_ is raised from Learning and Knowledge, without\r\nregard to Bloud or Parentage, excepting the Royall Family.\r\n\r\n7. That in _CHEKIAN_, a maritime Province, whence is the shortest cut of\r\n_China_ to _Japan_, is the best and plentifullest _Silk-trade_ in the\r\nworld: And that there every year the Mulberries are cutt, and kept down,\r\nthat they grow not into Trees for the easier gathering of the Leaves, there\r\nbeing a _double_ Silk-harvest in that Country, as there is in severall\r\nother parts of the East-indies; (both which there is hope, will shortly be\r\nimitated in _Virginia_.)\r\n\r\n8. That the way of making _Porcelane_ is this: (_Which is the rather\r\ninserted here, because it agrees so well with an Account, we received a\r\nwhile since from a very Curious and intelligent Person of Amsterdam._)\r\nThere is in the Province of _Nankin_ a Town, call'd {250} _Goesifols_\r\nwhence they draw the Earth for _Porcelaine_, which is found between the\r\nRocks of Mountains. This Earth they beat very small, and stamp it to a very\r\nfine Powder, and then put it into Tubs fill'd with water; where the finest\r\npart sinks to the bottom. Afterwards 'tis kneaded in the form of small\r\nCubes, of the weight of about 3. _Catti_ (a _Catti_ being 20 Ounces.) These\r\npieces thus wrought are sold to the people, that commonly in great numbers\r\nfetch them, coming from the Town _Sintesimo_ (otherwise _Jontiou_) in the\r\nProvince of _Kiansy_, being about 50 miles distant from _Wotsing_, neer the\r\nCity _KIANSY_; which people transport them to their homes, and there bake\r\nthem in this manner: They heat their Ovens well, for the space of 15 daies\r\nsuccessively, and then keep them so close, that no Air may get in; and\r\nafter 15 _other_ daies are pass'd, they open the Oven in the presence of an\r\nOfficer, who takes every fifth vessel of each fashion for the service of\r\nthe Emperor: Which done, the rest is sold to those of _Ucienien_, whence it\r\nis transported all over the Country. So that the Earth is not prepared, in\r\n_Nankin_, where 'tis found, because the people of that Province have not\r\nthe skill of working it, as the other above-mention'd; who also alone have\r\nthe Art of coloring it, which they keep as a great Secret, not teaching it\r\nto any, but their Children and next Kindred.\r\n\r\n9. That _Musk_ is nothing else, but the Testicles of a Beast like a Dear,\r\nfound in the Province of _Honan_; and that, when tis good and unmixt, as it\r\ncomes from the Animal, they sell it even in _Nankin_ and _Pekin_, for 30.\r\nor 35. _Teyls_ (that is, about so many Crowns) the _Catti_.\r\n\r\nMany other curious informations might be borrow'd from this Author,\r\nconcerning the Customs, Studies, Exercises of the _Chinese_; of the number\r\nof the people of each Province; of the Natural productions of the Earth and\r\nRivers there; of the Structure and Antiquity of their Wall; of the\r\nMagnificence of their Porcelain Tower &c.; but, remitting for these things\r\nto the Book it self, we shal only add a piece of Oeconomy, used by the\r\n_Holland_-Merchants in their Commerce with _China_, which is, that they dry\r\nabundance of Sage-leaves, role them up, and {251} prepare them like _The_,\r\nand carrying it to _China_, as a rare drogue, get for one pound of it,\r\nfourtimes as much _The_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A DISCOURSE ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THE INUNDATION OF THE NILE_, in _French_.\r\nThe Author of this Book is Monseiur _dela Chambre_, who being perswaded\r\nfrom several Circumstances, that accompany the Overflowing of this River,\r\nthat it cannot proceed from Rain, ventures to assign for a Cause of _it_,\r\nand of all the other effects that happen at the time of its swelling, the\r\n_Niter_, wherewith that water abounds.\r\n\r\nThe discourse having six parts, the Author endeavours to shew in the\r\n\r\n_First_, that the Waters of the _Nile_ are Nitrous, explicating the Nature\r\nof Salt, and Saltpeter, and imputing the fertility of the Earth, as well us\r\nthe fecundity of Animals, to Salt. Where he shews, that all things, that\r\nserve to improve Land, are full of Salt; and that 'tis observ'd, that grain\r\nsteep'd in Vrine, before sowing, rises sooner, and becomes fuller and\r\nstronger, than else. Adding, that that, which renders the Seed of Animals\r\nprolifick, is, that one of the _Spermatick_ veins hath its Origine from the\r\n_Emulgent_, through which the Nitrous and Saline Serosities, that discharge\r\nthemselves into the Kidneys and Bladder, do pass.\r\n\r\nIn the _Second_, he examins, what is Fermentation, and how 'tis perform'd;\r\naffirming, that, what thrusts forth Plants in the Spring, is, that the\r\nEarth being fermented by the _Niter_, it harbours, the Nitrous spirits\r\ninsinuate themselves into their Pores.\r\n\r\nIn the _Third_ he treats of all the Circumstances, observable in the\r\nInundation of the Nile. 'Tis affirm'd, that 3 or 4 days before that River\r\nbegins to overflow, all its water is troubled: that then there falls a\r\ncertain Dew, which hath a fermenting vertue, and leavens a Paste exposed to\r\nthe Air: that the Mud, which has been drawn out of the water, grows\r\nheavier, when the overflowing begins, then it was before, and that by the\r\nincrease of the weight of that Mud, they judge of the greatness of the\r\napproaching inundation. The Author pretends, that {252} the Niter, which\r\nthe _Nile_ is stored with, is the cause of all these strange effects, and\r\nof many others, by him alledged. For, _saith he_, when the Nitre is heated\r\nby the heat of the Sun, it ferments, and mingling with the water, troubles\r\nit, and swells it, and makes it pass beyond its banks; after the same\r\nmanner, as the Spirits in new Wine render it troubled, and make it boyle in\r\nthe vessel. And it seems not likely to him, that the Mud, found in the\r\n_Nile_, should come a far off; for then it would at last so raise the banks\r\nof this River, that it would not be able to overflow them any longer.\r\nWhereas 'tis more than 2000 years, that the banks thereof are not grown\r\nhigher, there being now requisite but 16. cubits for overflowing the Land,\r\nno more than there was in the time of _Herodotus_. Which shews, _saith he_,\r\nthat this Mud is nothing but a volatil _Niter_, which exhaling, doth not\r\nincrease the Earth. As for the _Ægyptian_ Dew, and the increase of the\r\nweight of the Mud, he adscribes them to the same Cause. For the spirits of\r\nNitre abounding in the _Nile_, when raised into the Air with the vapors,\r\nthat exhale continually from this River, there is made out of their\r\nmixture, a Dew, that refreshes the Air, makes sickness to cease, and\r\nproduces all those admirable effects, that make the _Ægyptians_ wish for it\r\nso passionately. And the same spirits of Niter, being joyned to the Paste,\r\nand to the Mud, raise the one, and augment the weight of the other. That,\r\nwhich Mr. _Buratini_ observes, that at the time of this inundation, the\r\nNiter-pits of the neighboring places vomit out liquid Niter, and that one\r\nmay see issue out of the Earth abundance of Chrystals of Nitre, is alledged\r\nto fortify this conjecture; Which is yet more confirm'd by the Fertility,\r\ncommunicated to the Earth by the Mud of this River. For, plants do grow\r\nthere in such abundance, that they would choak one another, if it were not\r\nremedied by throwing Sand upon the Fields; insomuch that the _Ægyptians_\r\nmust take as much pains to spread Sand to lessen the fatness of their Land,\r\nas other Nations do, to spread dung or other manure upon theirs to increase\r\nthe fatness.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fourth_ and _Fifth_, the Author undertakes to prove, that all those\r\nstrange effects cannot be attributed to Rain or Snow, {253} and that the\r\noverflowing of the _Nile_ always happens at a certain day.\r\n\r\nIn the _Last_, he alledges some Relations, serving to confirm his Opinion;\r\nWhich are too long here to insist upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DE PRINCIPIIS ET RATIOCINATIONE GEOMETRARUM, Contra Fastum Professorum\r\nGeometriæ;_ Authore _Thoma Hobbes_. It seems, that this Author is angry\r\nwith all Geometricians, but himself; yea he plainly saith in the dedication\r\nof his Book, that _he invades the whole Nation of them_; and unwilling, it\r\nseems, to be call'd to an account for doing so; He will acknowledge no\r\njudge of _this_ Age; but is full of hopes, that posterity will pronounce\r\nfor him. Mean while he ventures to advance this _Dilemma_; _Eorum qui de\r\niisdem rebus mecum aliquid ediderunt, aut solus insanio Ego, aut solus non\r\ninsanio; tertium enim non est, nisi (quod dicet forte aliquis) insaniamus\r\nomnes._ Doubtless, one of these will be granted him.\r\n\r\nAs to the Book it self, he professes, that he doth not write it against\r\n_Geometry_, but _Geometers_; and that his design in it is, to shew, That\r\nthere is no less uncertainty and falsity in the writings of\r\n_Mathematicians_, than there is in those of _Naturalists_, _Moralists_,\r\n&c., though he judges, that _Physicks_, _Ethicks_, _Politicks_, if they\r\nwere well demonstrated, would be as certain as the _Mathematicks_.\r\n\r\nAttacking the Mathematical Principles as they are found in Books, and\r\nwithall some Demonstrations, he takes to task _Euclid_ himself, instead of\r\nall, as the Master of all Geometricians, and with him his best interpreter,\r\n_Clavius_, examining in the _First_ place, the _Principles_ of _Euclid_:\r\n_Secondly_, Declaring false, what is superstructed upon them, whether by\r\n_Euclid_, or _Clavius_, or any _Geometer_ whatsoever that hath made use of\r\nthose or other (as he is pleased to entitle them) _false_ Principles.\r\n_Thirdly_, Pretending, that he means so to combat all, both Principles and\r\nDemonstrations, undertaken by him, as that he will substitute better in\r\ntheir room, least he should seem to undermine the Science it selfe. {254}\r\n\r\nThe particulars, which he undertakes to reform, are,\r\n\r\n  _Punctum._\r\n  _Linea._\r\n  _Terminus._\r\n  _Linea Recta._\r\n  _Superficies._\r\n  _Superficiei Termini._\r\n  _Superficies Plana,_\r\n  _Angulus_ (Where he is large upon the _Angulus Contactus._)\r\n  _Petitio prima Elem. 1.

And there being one given him, before another Month\r\nis come in, he does without any scruple or delay comply therewith,\r\npresenting the Curious with an Experiment which he thinks is both\r\nseasonable, and will not be unwellcome to them; furnish't out of the Ample\r\nMagazin of that Philosophical Benefactor, the Noble Mr. _Boyle_; Concerning\r\nwhich, thus much is further thought requisite to intimate on this occasion,\r\nthat it, and some others of the same Gentlemans, that have been, and may\r\nbe, mentioned in the _Transactions_, belong to certain Treatises, the\r\nAuthor hath lying by him; but that yet he denys not {256} to communicate\r\nthem to his Friends, and to allow them to dispose thereof, upon a hope,\r\nthat equitable Readers will be ready to excuse, if hereafter they should\r\nappear also in the Treatises they belong to, since he consents to this\r\nAnticipation, but to comply with those, that think the imparting of real\r\nand practical Experiments, may do the Publick some Service, by exciteing\r\nand assisting mens Curiosity in the interim.\r\n\r\nAs for the Experiment, you saw the other day at my Lodgings, though it\r\nbelongs to some Papers about _Cold_, that (you know) could not be\r\nPublish't, when the rest of the _History_ came forth, and therefore was\r\nreserved for the next _Edition_ of that Book; yet the Weather having been\r\nof late very hot, and threatning to continue so, I presume, that to give\r\nyou here in compliance with your Curiosity an Account of the Main and\r\nPractical part of the Experiment, may enable you to gratify not onely the\r\nCurious among your Friends, but those of the Delicate, that are content to\r\npurchase a Coolness of Drinks at a somewhat chargeable rate.\r\n\r\nYou may remember, that the Spring before the last, I shew'd you a\r\nparticular Account of a way, wherein by a certain substance obtain'd from\r\n_Sal Armoniack_, I could presently produce a considerable degree of _Cold_,\r\nand that with odd Circumstances, without the help of _Snow_, _Ice_, _Niter_\r\n&c. But that Experiment being difficult and costly enough, and design'd to\r\nafford men _Information_, not _Accomodations_, I afterwards tryed, what\r\nsome more cheap and facile mixtures of likely Bodies with _Sal Armoniack_\r\nwould do towards the Production of Cold, and afterwards I began to\r\nconsider, whether to that purpose alone (for my first experiment was\r\ndesign'd to exhibite other _Phænomena_ too) those mixtures might not\r\nwithout inconvenience be omitted: and I was much confirm'd in my\r\nconjecture, by an accident, which was casually related to me by a very\r\nIngenious Physician of my acquaintance, but not to be repeated to you in\r\nfew words, though he complain'd, he knew not what to make of it.\r\n\r\nAmong the several ways, by which I have made infrigidating Mixtures with\r\n_Sal Armoniack_, the most simple and facile is this; Take one pound of\r\npowder'd _Sal Armoniack_ and about three Pints (or pounds) of Water, put\r\nthe Salt into the Liquor, _either_ altogether, if your design be to produce\r\nan intense, though {257} but a short coldness; _or_ at two, three, or four\r\nseveral times, if you desire, that the produced coldness should rather last\r\nsomewhat longer than be so great. Stirre the powder in the Liquor with a\r\nstick or whalebone (or some other thing that will not be injur'd by the\r\nfretting Brine, that will be made) to hasten the dissolution of the Salt;\r\nupon the quickness of which depends very much the intensity of the Cold,\r\nthat will ensue upon this Experiment. For the clearing up whereof, I shall\r\nannex the following particulars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _In the History of Cold._]\r\n\r\n1. That a considerable degree of Cold is really produced by this operation,\r\nis very evident: _First_ to the touch; _Secondly_, by this, that if you\r\nmake the Experiment (as for this reason I sometimes chuse to do) in a\r\nGlass-Body or a Tankard, you may observe, that, whilst the Solution of the\r\nSalt is making, the outside of the Metalline Vessel will, as high as the\r\nmixture reaches within, be bedew'd (if I may so speak) with a multitude of\r\nlittle Drops of Water as I have * elsewhere shown that it happens, when\r\nmixtures of Snow and Salt, being put into Glasses or other Vessels, the\r\naqueous vapors that swim to and fro in the Air, and chance to glide along\r\nthe sides of the Vessels, are by the coldness thereof condens'd into Water.\r\nAnd in our Armoniack Solution you may observe, that if you wipe off the Dew\r\nfrom any particular part of the outside of the Vessel, whilst the solution\r\ndoes yet vigorously goe on, it will quickly collect fresh Dew, which may be\r\nsometimes copious enough to run down the sides of the Vessel. But\r\n_Thirdly_, the best and surest way of finding out the Coldness of our\r\nMixture is that, which I shew'd you by plunging into it a good seal'd\r\nWeatherglass furnish't with tincted Spirit of Wine. For the Ball of this\r\nbeing put into our frigorifick mixture, the Crimson Liquor will nimbly\r\nenough descend much lower, than when it was kept either in the open Air, in\r\ncommon Water, of the same temper with that, wherein the _Sal Armoniack_ was\r\nput to dissolve. And if you remove the Glass out of our Mixture into common\r\nwater, the tincted Spirit will, (as you may remember, it did) hastily\r\nenough reascend for a pretty while, according to the greater or lesser\r\ntime, that it continued in the _Armoniack_ Solution. And this has succeeded\r\nwith me, when instead of removing the Mixture into _Common_ Water, I\r\nremoved it into water newly impregnated with _Salt-peter_.\r\n\r\n{258}\r\n\r\n2. The _Duration_ of the Cold, produc'd by this Experiment, depends upon\r\nseveral Circumstances; as _First_, upon the Season of the year, and present\r\ntemperature of the Air; For, in Summer and Hot weather the Cold will sooner\r\ndecay and expire. _Secondly_, upon the Quantity of Salt and Water: For, if\r\nboth these be great, the effect will be as well more lasting, as more\r\nconsiderable. _Thirdly_, for ought I yet know, we may here add the Goodness\r\n& Fitness of the particular parcel of Salt, that is imploy'd; for, though\r\nit be hard to discern beforehand, which will be the more, and which the\r\nless proper; yet some trials have tempted me to suspect, that there may be\r\na considerable disparity, as to their fitness to produce Cold, betwixt\r\nparcels of Salt, that are without scruple look't upon as Sal Armoniack: Of\r\nwhich difference it were not perhaps very difficult to asign probable\r\nreasons from the Nature of the Ingredients of this compound Concrete, and\r\nthe wayes of preparing it. But the Duration of the Cold may be conceived to\r\ndepend also. _Fourthly_, upon the Way of putting in the Salt into the\r\nWater. For, if you cast it in all at once, the Water will sooner acquire an\r\nintense degree of Coldness, but it will also the sooner return to its\r\nformer temper; Whereas, if you desire but an inferiour degree of that\r\nQuality, but that may last longer (which wil usually be the most convenient\r\nfor the Cooling of Drinks), then you may put in the Salt by little and\r\nlittle. For, keeping a long Weather-glass for a good while in our\r\nimpregnated Mixture, I often purposely try'd, that, when the tincted liquor\r\nsubsided but slowly, or was at a stand, by putting in, from time to time, 2\r\nor 3. spoonfuls of fresh Salt, and stirring the Water to quicken the\r\nDissolution, the Spirit of Wine would begin again to descend, if it were at\r\na stand or rising, or subside much more swiftly than it did before. And if\r\nyou would lengthen the Experiment, it may not be amiss, that part of the\r\nSal Armoniack be but grosly beaten, that it may be the longer in\r\ndissolving, and consequently in Cooling the Water. Whilst there are dewy\r\ndrops produced on the outside of the Vessel, 'tis a sign, that the Cold\r\nwithin continues pretty strong; for when it ceases, these drops especially\r\nin warm weather, will by degrees vanish. But a _surer_ way of measuring the\r\nduration of the Cold, is, by removing from time to time the Seal'd\r\nWeather-glass out of the Saline Mixture into the same common Water, with\r\npart of which it was made. And though it be not easie to determin any thing\r\nparticularly about this matter; yet it may somewhat assist you in your\r\nEstimates, to be inform'd, That I have in the Spring by a good\r\nWeather-glass found a sensible adventitious Cold made by a pound of Sal\r\nArmoniack at the utmost, to last about 2 or 3 hours.\r\n\r\n3. To cool Drinks with this Mixture, you may put them in _thin_ Glasses,\r\nthe thinner the better; which (their orifices being stopp'd, and still kept\r\nabove the Mixture) may be moved to and fro in it, and then be immediately\r\npour'd out to be drunk: Though when in the Glass, I imployed, was\r\nconveniently shap'd as, like a Sugar-loaf, or with a long Neck, I found it\r\nnot amiss to drink it out of that, without pouring it into any other; which\r\ncan scarce be done without lessning the Coolness. The refrigeration, if the\r\nGlass viall be convenient, is quickly perform'd: And if one have a mind to\r\ncool his hands, he may readily do it by applying them to the outside of the\r\nVessel, that contains the refrigerating Mixture; by whose help, pieces of\r\nChrystal, or Bullet for the cooling of {259} the Mouths or Hands of those\r\npatients, to whom it may be allow'd, may be potently cool'd, and other such\r\nrefreshments may be easily procur'd.\r\n\r\n4. How far Sal Armoniack, mingl'd with Sand or Earth, and not dissolv'd,\r\nbut only moistn'd with a little Water sprinkl'd on it, will keep Bottles of\r\nWine or other liquors more coole, than the Earth or that Sand alone will\r\ndo, I have not yet had opportunity by sufficient trials fully to satisfie\r\nmy self, and therefore resign that Enquiry to the Curious.\r\n\r\n5. For the cooling of Air, and Liquors, to adjust Weather-glasses (to be\r\nable to do which at all times of the year, was one of the chief aimes, that\r\nmade me bethink my self of this Experiment;) or to give a small quantity of\r\nBeer &c. a moderate degree of coolness, it will not be requisite, to employ\r\nneer so much as a whole pound of Sal Armoniack at a time. For, you may\r\neasily observe by a seal'd Weather-glass, that a very few ounces, well\r\npouder'd and nimbly dissolv'd in about 4. times the weight of Water, will\r\nserve well enough for many purposes.\r\n\r\n6. And that you may the less, scruple at this, I shall tell you, that even\r\nbefore and after Midsummer, I have found the Cold producible by our\r\nExperiment to be considerable and useful for refrigerating of Drinks, &c.\r\nbut if the Sal Armoniack be of the fittest sort (for I intimated above,\r\nthat I suspected, 'tis not equally good) and if the season of the year do\r\nmake no disadvantagious difference, the degree of Cold, that may be\r\nproduced by no more than one pound (if not by less) of Sal Armoniack, may,\r\nwithin its own Sphere of Activity, be much more vehement, than, I presume,\r\nyou yet imagine, and may afford us excellent Standards to adjust seal'd\r\nWeather glasses by; and for several other purposes, For I remember that in\r\nthe Spring, about the end of _March_, or beginning of _April_, I was able\r\nwith one pound of Sal Armoniack, and a requisite proportion of Water, to\r\nproduce a degree of Cold much greater, than was necessary the preceding\r\nWinter, to make it frosty Weather abroad; nay I was able to produce real\r\nIce in a space of time, almost incredibly short. To confirm which\r\nparticulars, because they will probably seem strange to you, I will here\r\nannex the Transcript of an entry, that I find in a Note book of the\r\n_Phænomena_ and success of one of those Experiments, as I then tryed it;\r\nthough I should be asham'd to expose to your perusal a thing so rudely\r\npen'd; if I did not hope, you would consider, that 'twas hastily written\r\nonely for my own Remembrance. And that you may not stop at any thing in the\r\nimmediately annext Note, or the two, that follow, it will be requisite to\r\npremise this Account of the seal'd Thermoscope; (which was a good one)\r\nwherewith these Observations were made; That the length of the Cylindrical\r\npipe was 16. Inches; the Ball, about the bigness of a somewhat large\r\nWalnut, and the Cavity of the Pipe by guess about an eight or ninth part of\r\nan inch Diameter.\r\n\r\nThe First Experiment is thus registered. _March_ the 27th, in the Seal'd\r\nWeather glass, when first put into the Water, the tincted Spirit rested at\r\n8-5/8 inches; being suffered to stay there a good while, and now and then\r\nstirr'd to and fro in the Water; it descended at length a little beneath\r\n7-5/8 inches; then the _Sal Armoniack_ being put in, within about a quarter\r\nof an hour or a little more it descended to 2-11/16 inches, but before that\r\ntime, in half a {260} quarter of an hour it began manifestly to freeze the\r\nvapours and drops of water on the outside of the Glass. And when the\r\nfrigorifick power was arriv'd at the height, I several times found, that\r\nwater, thinly plac'd on the outside, whilst the mixture within was nimbly\r\nstirr'd up and down, would freeze in a quarter of a minute (by a\r\nMinute-watch.) At about ¾ of an hour after the infrigidating Body was put\r\nin, the Thermoscope, that had been taken out a while before, and yet was\r\nrisen but to the lowest freezing mark, being again put in the liquor, fell\r\nan inch beneath the mark. At about 2½ houres from the first Solution of the\r\nSalt I found the tincted liquor to be in the midst between the freezing\r\nmarks, whereof the one was at 5½ inches (at which height when the Tincture\r\nrested, it would usually be, some, though but a small, frost abroad;) and\r\nthe other at 4¾ inches; which was the height, to which strong and durable\r\nFrosts had reduced the liquor in the Winter. At 3 hours after the beginning\r\nof the Operation, I found not the Crimson liquor higher than the upper\r\nFreezing mark newly mention'd; after which, it continued to rise very\r\nslowly for about an hour longer; beyond which time I had not occasion to\r\nobserve it.\r\n\r\nThus far the _Note-book_; wherein there is mention made of a Circumstance\r\nof some former Experiments of the like kind, which I remember was very\r\nconspicuous in this newly recited. For, the frigorifick mixture having been\r\nmade in a Glass body (as they call it) with a large and flattish bottom, a\r\nquantity of water, which I (purposely) spilt upon the Table, was by the\r\noperation of the mixture within the Glass, made to freeze, and that\r\nstrongly enough, the bottom of the Cucurbite to the Table; that stagnant\r\nliquor being turn'd into solid ice, that continued a considerable while\r\nunthaw'd away, and was in some places about the thickness of a half Crown\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nAnother Observation, made the same Spring, but less solemn, as meant\r\nchiefly to shew the Duration of Cold in a high degree, is recorded in these\r\nterms: The first time, the Seal'd Weather-glass was put in, before it\r\ntouch'd the common water, it stood at 8-1/8, having been left there a\r\nconsiderable while, and once or twice agitated the water, the tincted\r\nliquor sunk but to 7-7/8, or at furthest, 7-6/8; then the frigorifick\r\nliquor being put into the water with circumstances disadvantagious enough\r\nin (about) half a quarter of an hour the tincted liquor fell beneath 3¾,\r\nand the Thermoscope, being taken out, and then put in again, an hour after\r\nthe water had been first infrigidated subsided beneath 5 inches, and\r\nconsequently within ¼ of an inch of the mark of the strongly freezing\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n7. Whereas the grand thing, that is like to keep this Experiment from being\r\nas generally _Useful_, as perhaps it will prove _Luciferous_, is the\r\nDearness of Sal Armoniack, two things may be offered to lessen this\r\nInconvenience. For _first_, Sal Armoniack might be made much cheaper, if\r\ninstead of fetching it beyond-sea, our Country-men made it here at home;\r\n(which it may easily be and I am ready to give you the Receipt, which is no\r\ngreat Secret.) But _next_, I considered, that probably the infrigidating\r\nvertue of our mixture might depend upon the peculiar Texture of the Sal\r\nArmoniack whereby, whilest the Water is dissolving it, either some\r\nFrigorifick particles are extricated and excited or (rather) some particles\r\nwhich did before more agitate the minute parts of the water, are expell'd\r\n(or invited out by the ambient Bodies) or {261} come to be clogg'd in their\r\nmotion: Whence it seem'd reasonable to expect that upon the Reunion of the\r\nSaline particles into such a Body, as they had constituted before, the\r\nredintegrated Sal Armoniack having, neer upon, the same Texture, would,\r\nupon its being redissolv'd, produce the same, or a not much inferior degree\r\nof Coldness: And hereupon, though I well enough foresaw that an Armoniack\r\nsolution, being boyl'd up in Earthen vessels (for Glass ones are too\r\nchargeable) would, by piercing them, both lose some of the more subtle\r\nparts, and thereby somewhat impaire the texture of the rest; yet I was not\r\ndeceiv'd in Expecting, that the dry Salt, remaining in the pipkins, being\r\nredissolv'd in a due proportion of water, would very considerably\r\ninfrigidate it; as may further appear by the Notes, which for your greater\r\nsatisfaction you will find here subjoyn'd, as soon as I have told you,\r\nthat, though for want of other vessels I was first reduc'd to make use of\r\nEarthen ones, and the rather, because some Metallin Vessels will be injur'd\r\nby the dissolv'd Sal Armoniack, if it be boyl'd in them; yet I afterwards\r\nfound some conveniencies in Vessels of other Mettall, as of Iron; whereof\r\nyou may command a further Account.\r\n\r\n_March_ the 29th, the Thermoscope in the Air was at 8-7/8 inches; being put\r\ninto a somewhat large evaporating glass, fill'd with water, it fell (after\r\nit staid a pretty while, and had been agitated in the liquor) to 8. inches:\r\nthen about half the Salt, or less, that had been used _twice_ before, and\r\nfelt much less cold than the water, being put in and stirr'd about, the\r\ntincted Spirit subsided with a visible progress, till it was faln\r\nmanifestly beneath 4. inches; and then, having caused some water to be\r\nfreshly pump'd and brought in; though the newly mention'd Solution were\r\nmixt with it, yet it presently made the Spirit of Wine manifestly to ascend\r\nin the Instrument, much faster, than one would have expected, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd this much may suffice for this time concerning our _Frigorifick_\r\nExperiment; which I scarce doubt but the _Cartesians_ will lay hold on as\r\nvery favourable to some of their Tenents; which you will easily believe, it\r\nis _not_ to the Opinion, I have elsewhere oppos'd, of those Modern\r\nPhilosophers, that would have _Salt-petre_ to be the _Primum Frigidum_:\r\n(though I found by trial, that, whilst 'tis actually dissolving, it gives a\r\nmuch considerabler degree of Cold, than otherwise.) But about the\r\nReflexions, that may be made on this Experiment, and the Variations, and\r\nImprovements & Uses of it, though I have divers things lying by me; yet,\r\nsince you have seen several of them already, and may command a sight of the\r\nrest, I shall forbear the mention of them here, not thinking it proper, to\r\nswell the bulk of this Letter with them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of two Books lately printed in London._\r\n\r\nI. _EUCLIDIS ELEMENTA GEOMETRICA, novo ordine ac methodo demonstrata._ In\r\nthis compendious and pretty Edition, the Anonymous Author pretends to have\r\nrendred these Elements more expeditious; by bringing all together into one\r\nplace, what belongs to one and the same subject: Comprising 1. what\r\n_Euclid_ hath said of _Lines_, Streight, Intersecting one another, and\r\nParallel. 2.

Of the _severall sorts_ of _Vines_, and what\r\n_Grapes_ are most sutable to the _Climate_ of _England_; where he chiefly\r\ncommends the small _Black-grape_, or _Cluster-grape_; the _Parsley-grape_;\r\nthe White _Muscadine_; the _Frontiniack_; and a new _White-grape_, with a\r\nred Wood and a dark green Leaf: All these being early ripe fruit. 2. Of the\r\n_Soyle_, and _Scituation_ of a Vine-yard in _England_: Where, as to the\r\n_First_, he pitches upon a _Light Soile_, having a bottom of _Chalk_ or\r\n_Gravel_, and given to _Brambles_ observing, that no Plant whatsoever is so\r\nconnatural to the Vine for Soyl, as the _Bramble_. As for the _Scituation_\r\nhe chooses that side or declivity of a Hill, that lies to the _South_ or\r\n_Southwest_; and is favoured with _other Hills_ somewhat higher, or _Woods_\r\non the _North_ and _East_, to break the rigour of those quarters. This\r\ndirection he thinks of that importance, that he affirms, that the\r\ndiscouragement of the Culture of Vines in _England_ has only proceeded from\r\nmen's misinformation on this material article of _Choice_ of _Soyle_ and\r\n_Scituation_. 3. How to _prepare_ the Ground for the Plantation, _vid._ by\r\nplowing up the _Swarth_ in _July_, and by disposing the _Turf_ in _small_\r\nheaps, and so burning them, and spreading the ashes over the Land; care\r\nbeing taken, that by heaping too much materials together, the Earth be not\r\nover-burnt by the excessive heat and fire, which they require to reduce\r\nthem to ashes.\r\n\r\nWhat is added, of the Manner of planting the _Sets_; of Dressing, Pruning,\r\nand Governing the Plantation; of the Ordering and Cultivating the Vine-yard\r\nafter the first four years, till it needs renewing; as also of the _manner_\r\nand _time_, how and when to manure the Vine-yard, with Compost, will be\r\nbetter understood from the Book it self, than can be here described; the\r\nAuthor pretending, that, those few observations of his, as the native\r\nproduction of his own Experience, being practised with care, the Vine-yards\r\nin _England_ may be planted, govern'd and perpetuated with undoubted\r\nsuccess; and offering withall to furnish those, that have a desire to renew\r\nthis Culture, and to store their grounds with _Sets_ and _Plants_ of all\r\nthose sorts, which he recommends; he having a plentiful _stock_ of them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted with Licence for _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to\r\nthe Royal Society. 1666.\r\n\r\n{263}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 16.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _August_ 6. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _An essay of Dr. _John Wallis_, exhibiting his _Hypothesis_ about the\r\n    _Flux and Reflux of the Sea_, taken from the consideration of the\r\n    _Common Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon_; together with an\r\n    _Appendix_ of the same, containing an _Answer_ to some _Objections_,\r\n    made by severall Persons against that _Hypothesis_.

It may perhaps\r\nbe to more purpose, to take notice, that all the deficiencies, found in the\r\n_Theories_ or _Hypotheses_, formerly invented for that End, have not been\r\nable to deterre the Ingenious of _this_ Age from making farther search into\r\nthat Matter: Among whom that Eminent Mathematician Dr. _John Wallis_,\r\nfollowing his happy _Genius_ for advancing reall Philosophy, hath made it a\r\npart of his later Inquiries and Studies, to contrive and deduce a certain\r\nHypothesis concerning that _Phænomenon_, taken {264} from the Consideration\r\nof the _Common Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon_, This being by\r\nseveral Learned Men lookt upon, as a very rational Notion, it was thought\r\nfit to offer it by the Press to the Publick, that other Intelligent Persons\r\nalso might the more conveniently and at their leisure examine the\r\n_Conjecture_ (the Author, such is his Modesty, presenting it no otherwise)\r\nand thereupon give in their sense, and what Difficulties may occur to them\r\nabout it, that so it may be either confirm'd or laid aside accordingly; As\r\nthe _Proposer_ himself expressly desires in the Discourse, we now, without\r\nany more _Preamble_, are going to subjoyn, as it was by him addressed, by\r\nway of Letter, from _Oxford_ to Mr. _Boyle, April_ 25. 1666. and afterwards\r\ncommunicated to the _R. Society_, as follows:\r\n\r\nYou were earnest with me, when you last went from hence, that I would put\r\nin writing somewhat of that, which at divers times, these three or four\r\nyears last past, I have been discoursing with your self and others\r\nconcerning the _Common Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon_, in order\r\nto salving the _Phænomena_ as well of the _Seas Ebbing and Flowing_; as of\r\nsome perplexities in _Astronomical Observations_ of the _Places_ of the\r\nCelestial Bodies.\r\n\r\nHow much the World, and the great Bodies therein, are manag'd according to\r\nthe _Laws of Motion_, and _Statick Principles_, and with how much more of\r\nclearness and satisfaction, many of the more abstruse _Phænomena_ have been\r\nsalved on such Principles, within this last Century of years, than formerly\r\nthey had been; I need not discourse to you, who are well versed in it. For,\r\nsince that _Galilæo_ and (after him) _Torricellio_, and others, have\r\napplied _Mechanick_ Principles to the salving of _Philosophical_\r\nDifficulties; _Natural Philosophy_ is well known to have been rendered more\r\nintelligible, and to have made a much greater progress in less than an\r\nhundred years, than before for many ages.\r\n\r\nThe _Seas Ebbing and Flowing_, hath so great a connexion with the _Moons_\r\nmotion, that in a manner all Philosophers (whatever other Causes they have\r\njoyned with it), have attributed much of its cause to the _Moon_, which\r\neither by some _occult quality_, {265} or _particular influence_, which it\r\nhath on moyst Bodies, or by some _Magnetick vertue_, drawing the water\r\ntowards it, (which should therefore make the Water there _highest_, where\r\nthe Moon is _vertical_) or by its gravity and pressure downwards upon the\r\nTerraqueous Globe (which would make it _lowest_ where the Moon is\r\n_vertical_) or by whatever other means (according to the several\r\nConjectures of inquisitive persons,) hath so great an influence on, or at\r\nleast a connexion with, the Sea's Flux and Reflux, that it would seem very\r\nunreasonable, to seclude the consideration of the Moons motion from that of\r\nthe Sea: The _Periods of Tides_ (to say nothing of the greatness of them\r\nnear the New moon and Full moon) so constantly waiting on the Moon's\r\nmotion, that it may be well presumed, that either the one is governed by\r\nthe other, or at least both from some common cause.\r\n\r\nBut the first that I know of, who took in the consideration of the\r\n_Earth's_ motion, (_Diurnal_ and _Annual_) was _Galilæo_; who in his\r\n_Systeme of the World_, hath a particular discourse on this subject: Which,\r\nfrom the first time I ever read it, seemed to me so very rational, that I\r\ncould never be of other opinion, but that the true Account of this great\r\n_Phænomenon_ was to be referred to the Earths motion, as the _Principal_\r\ncause of it: Yet that of the Moon (for the reasons above mentioned) not to\r\nbe excluded, as to the determining the _Periods of Tides_, and other\r\ncircumstances concerning them. And though it be manifest enough, that\r\n_Galilæo_, as to some particulars, was mistaken in the account which there\r\nhe gives of it; yet that may be very well allowed, without any blemish to\r\nso deserving a person, or prejudice to the _main Hypothesis_: For that\r\nDiscourse is to be looked upon onely as an _Essay_ of the _general\r\nHypothesis_; which as to _particulars_ was to afterwards adjusted, from a\r\ngood _General History of Tides_; which it's manifest enough that he had\r\nnot; and which is in a great measure yet wanting. For were the matter of\r\nFact well agreed on, it is not likely, that several Hypotheses should so\r\nfar differ, as that one should make the Water _then_ and _there_ at the\r\nHighest, _where_ and _when_ the other makes it at the Lowest; as when the\r\nMoon is Vertical to the place. {266}\r\n\r\nAnd what I say of _Galilæo_, I must in like manner desire to be understood\r\nof what I am now ready to say to you. For I do not profess to be so well\r\nskilled in the History of Tides, as that I will undertake presently to\r\naccommodate my _general Hypothesis_ to the _particular cases_; or that I\r\nwill indeed undertake for the certainty of it, but onely as an _Essay_\r\npropose it to further consideration; to stand or fall, as it shall be found\r\nto answer matter of Fact. And truly had not your importunity (which is to\r\nme a great Command) required me to do it, I should not so easily have drawn\r\nup any thing about it, till I had first satisfied my selfe, how well the\r\nHypothesis would answer Observation: Having for divers years neglected to\r\ndo it, waiting a time when I might be at leisure throughly to prosecute\r\nthis design.\r\n\r\nBut there be two reasons, by which you have prevailed with me, at least to\r\ndo something. _First_, because it is the common Fate of the _English_, that\r\nout of a modesty, they forbear to publish their Discoveries, till\r\nprosecuted to some good degree of certainty and perfection; yet are not so\r\nwary, but that they discourse of them freely enough to one another, and\r\neven to Strangers upon occasion; whereby others, who are more hasty and\r\nventurous, comming to hear of the notion, presently publish something of\r\nit, and would be reputed thereupon, to be the first Inventers thereof:\r\nthough even that little, which they can then say of it, be perhaps much\r\nless, and more imperfect, than what the true Authors could have published\r\nlong before, and what they had really made known (publikely enough, though\r\nnot in print) to many others. As is well known amongst us as to the\r\nbusiness of the _Lymphatick Vessels_ in _Anatomy_; the _Injection of\r\nLiquors into the veins of Living animals_; the _Exhibiting of a straight\r\nline equal to a crooked_; the _spot in Jupiter_, whence his motion about\r\nhis own Axis may be demonstrated; and many other the like considerable\r\nInventions.\r\n\r\nThe _other_ Reason (which, with me, is more really of weight, though even\r\nthe former be not cotemptible) is, because, as I have been already for at\r\nleast three or four years last past diverted from prosecuting the inquiry\r\nor perfecting the Hypothesis, as I had thoughts to do; so I do not know,\r\nbut like Emergencies may divert me longer; and whether I shall ever so\r\n{267} do it, as to bring it to perfection, I cannot determine. And\r\ntherefore, if as to my self any thing should _humanitus accidere_; yet\r\npossibly the notion may prove worth the preserving to be prosecuted by\r\nothers, if I do it not. And therefore I shall, at least to your self, give\r\nsome general account of my present imperfect and undigested thoughts.\r\n\r\nI consider therefore, that in the Tides, or the Flux and Reflux of the Sea,\r\nbesides extraordinary Extravagancies or Irregularities, whence great\r\nInundations or strangly high Tides do follow, (which yet perhaps may prove\r\nnot to be so meerly accidental as they have been thought to be, but might\r\nfrom the regular Laws of Motion, if well considered, be both well accounted\r\nfor and even foretold;) There are these _three_ notorious Observations made\r\nof the Reciprocation of Tides. _First_, the _Diurnal_ Reciprocation;\r\nwhereby twice in somewhat more than 24. hours, we have a Floud and an Ebbe;\r\nor a High-water and Low-water. _Secondly_, the _Menstrual_; whereby in one\r\n_Synodical_ period of the Moon, suppose from Full-moon to Full-moon, the\r\nTime of those Diurnal Vicissitudes doth move round through the whole\r\ncompass of the [Greek: Nuchthêmeron], or Natural day of twenty four hours:\r\nAs for instance, if at the Full-moon the full Sea be at such or such a\r\nplace just at Noon, it shall be the next day (at the same place) somewhat\r\nbefore One of the clock; the day following, between One and Two; and so\r\nonward, till at the New moon it shall be at midnight; (the other Tide,\r\nwhich in the Full moon was at midnight, now at the New-moon coming to be at\r\nnoon;) And so forward till at the next Full-moon, the Full sea shall (at\r\nthe same place) come to be at Noon again: Again, That of the Spring-tides\r\nand Neap-tides (as they are called;) about the Full-moon and New-moon the\r\nTides are at the Highest, at the Quadratures the Tides are at the Lowest:\r\nAnd at the times intermediate, proportionably. _Thirdly_, the _Annual_;\r\nwhereby it is observed, that at sometimes of the year, the Spring-tides are\r\nyet much higher than the Spring-tides at other times of the year: Which\r\nTimes are usually taken to be at the Spring and Autumne; or the two\r\nÆquinoxes; but I have reason to believe (as well from my own Observations,\r\nfor many years, as of others who have been {268} much concerned to heed it,\r\nwhereof more will be said by and by;) that we should rather assign the\r\nbeginnings of _February_ and _November_, than the two _Æquinoxes_.\r\n\r\nNow in order to the giving account of these three Periods, according to the\r\n_Laws of Motion_ and _Mechanick Principles_; We shall _first_ take for\r\ngranted, what is now adayes pretty commonly entertained by those, who treat\r\nof such matters; _That a Body in motion is apt to continue its motion, and\r\nthat in the same degree of celerity, unless hindred by some contrary\r\nImpediment_; (like as a Body at rest, to continue so, unless by some\r\nsufficient mover, put into motion:) And accordingly (which daily experience\r\ntestifies) if on a Board or Table, some loose incumbent weight, be for some\r\ntime moved, & have thereby contracted an _Impetus_ to motion at such a\r\nrate; if that Board or Table chance by some external obstacle, or\r\notherwise, to be stopped or considerably retarded in its motion, the\r\nincumbent loose Body will shoot forward upon it: And contrarywise, in case\r\nthat Board or Table chance to be accelerated or put forward with a\r\nconsiderably greater speed than before, the loose incumbent Body, (not\r\nhaving yet obtained an equal _Impetus_ with it) will be left behind, or\r\nseem to fly backward upon it. Or, (which is _Galilæo_'s instance,) if a\r\nbroad Vessel of Water, for some time evenly carried forward with the water\r\nin it, chance to meet with a stop, or to slack its motion, the Water will\r\ndash forward and rise higher at the fore part of the Vessel: And,\r\ncontrarywise, if the Vessel be suddenly put forward faster than before; the\r\nWater will dash backwards, and rise at the hinder part of the Vessel. So\r\nthat an Acceleration or Retardation of the Vessel, which carries it, will\r\ncause a rising of the Water in one part, and a falling in another: (which\r\nyet, by its own weight, will again be reduced to a Level as it was before.)\r\nAnd consequently, supposing the Sea to be but as a loose Body, carried\r\nabout with the Earth, but not so united with it, as necessarily to receive\r\nthe same degree of _Impetus_ with it, as its fixed parts do: The\r\nacceleration or retardation in the motion of this or that part of the\r\nEarth, will cause (more or less, according to the proportion of it) such a\r\ndashing of the Water, or rising at one part, with a Falling at another, as\r\nis that, which we call the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. {269}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow this premised, We are next, with him, to suppose the Earth carried\r\nabout with a double motion; The one _Annual_, as (_Fig._ 1.) in B E C the\r\ngreat Orb, in which the Center of the Earth B, is supposed to move about\r\nthe Sun A.\r\n\r\nThe other _Diurnal_, whereby the whole moves upon its own _Axis_, and each\r\npoint in its surface describes a Circle, as D E F G.\r\n\r\nIt is then manifest, that if we suppose, that the Earth moved but by any\r\none of these motions, and that regularly, (with an equal swiftness;) the\r\nWater, having once attained an equal _Impetus_ thereunto, would still hold\r\nequal pace with it; there being no occasion, from the Quickening or\r\nSlackening of the Earths motion, (in that part where the Water lyeth) for\r\nthe Water thereon either to be cast Forward or fall Backward; and thereby\r\nto accumulate on the other parts of the Water: But the true motion of each\r\npart of the Earths surface being compounded of those two motions, the\r\n_Annual_ and _Diurnal_; (the _Annual_ in B E C being, as _Galilæo_ there\r\nsupposeth, about three times as fast as a _diurnal_ motion in a great\r\nCircle, as D E F;) while a Point in the Earths surface moves about its\r\nCenter B. from G. to D. and E. and at the same time, its Center B. be\r\ncarried forwards to C; the true motion of that Point forwards, is made up\r\nof both those motions; to wit, of B to C, and of G to E; but while G moves\r\nby D to E, E moves backward by F to G, contrary to the motion of B to C; so\r\nthat the true motion of E, is but the difference of B C, and E G: (for,\r\nbeside the motion of B above the Center; G. is also put forward as much as\r\nfrom G to E; and E put backward as much as from E to G:) so that the\r\n_Diurnal_ motion, in that part of the Earth, which is next the Sun, as E F\r\nG, doth abate the progress of the _Annual_, (and most of all at F;) and in\r\nthe other part, which is from the Sun, as G D E, it doth increase it, (and\r\nmost of all at D.) that is, in the day time there is abated, in the night\r\ntime is added to the _Annual_ motion, about as much as is G E, the Earths\r\n_Diameter_. Which would afford us a Cause of two Tides in twenty four\r\nhours; the One upon the greatest Acceleration of motion, the Other upon its\r\ngreatest Retardation.\r\n\r\nAnd thus far _Galilæo_'s Discourse holds well enough; But then {270} in\r\nthis it comes short; that as it gives an Account of two Tides; so those two\r\nTides are alwayes to be at F and D; that is, at _Noon_ and _Midnight_;\r\nwhereas Experience tells us, that the Time of Tides, moves in a _moneths\r\nspace_ through all the 24. hours. Of which he gives us no account. For\r\nthough he do take notice of a Menstrual Period; yet he doth it onely as to\r\nthe _Quantity_ of the Tides; greater or less; not as to the _Time_ of the\r\n_Tides_, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _Vid. Riccioli Almagest. novum_, Tom. 1, lib. 4. cap. 10. n.\r\n111. pag. 216. 2.]\r\n\r\nTo help this, there is one (_Vid.* Jo. Baptista Balianus_) who makes the\r\n_Earth_ to be but a _secondary_ Planet; and to move, not directly about the\r\nSun, but about the Moon, the Moon meanwhile moving about the Sun; in like\r\nmanner as we suppose the Earth to move about the Sun, and the Moon about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut this, though it might furnish us with the foundation of a _Menstrual_\r\nPeriod of Accelerations and Retardations in the compound motion of several\r\nparts of the Earths surface; yet I am not at all inclined to admit this as\r\na _true Hypothesis_, for divers Reasons, which if not demonstrative, are\r\nyet so consonant to the general Systeme of the World, as that we have no\r\ngood ground to disbelieve them. For 1. The Earth being undeniably the\r\ngreater Body of the two (whereof there is no doubt to be made) it cannot be\r\nthought probable, that this should be carried about by the Moon, lesser\r\nthan it self: The contrary being seen, not onely in the _Sun_, which is\r\nbigger than any of the Planets, which it carryes about; but in _Jupiter_,\r\nbigger than any of his _Satellites_; and _Saturne_, bigger than his. 2. As\r\nthe _Sun_ by it's motion about it's own Axis, is with good reason judged to\r\nbe the _Physical_ cause of the _Primary_ Planets moving about it; So there\r\nis the like reason to believe, that _Jupiter_ and _Saturne_ moving about\r\ntheir Axes, are the Physical cause of their _Satellites_ moving about them,\r\nwhich motion of _Jupiter_ hath been of late discover'd, by the help of a\r\n_fixed_ Spot discern'd in him; and we have reason to believe the like of\r\n_Saturne:_ Whether _Venus_ and _Mercury_ (about whom no _Satellites_ have\r\nbeen yet observed) be likewise so moved; we have not yet the like ground to\r\ndetermine: But we have of _Mars_; from {271} the Observations of Mr. _Hook_\r\nmade in _February_ and _March_ last, and by him communicated to the _Royal\r\nSociety_, and since Printed in the _Transactions_, published _Apr._ 2.\r\n1666. consonant to the like observations of _Jupiter_, made by him in\r\n_May._ 1664, and since communicated to the same _Society_; and then\r\npublished in the _Transactions_, of _March._ 6. then next following. Now\r\nthat the Earth hath such a motion about its own _Axis_ (whereby it might be\r\nfitted to carry about the Moon) is evident by its _Diurnal_ motion. And it\r\nseems as evident that the Moon hath not; because of the same side of the\r\nMoon alwaies turned towards us; which could not be, if the Moon carried the\r\nEarth about: Unlesse we should say, that it carries about the Earth in just\r\nthe same Period, in which it turnes upon its own Axis: Which is contrary to\r\nthat of the Sun carrying about the Planets: the shortest of whose Periods,\r\nis yet longer than that of the Suns moving about its own Axis. And the like\r\nof _Jupiter_, shorter than the Period of any of his _Satellites_; if at\r\nleast the Period of his conversion about his Axis, lately said to be\r\nobserved, prove true. (Of _Saturn_ we have not yet any Period assigned; but\r\nit's likely to be shorter, than that of his _Satelles_.) And therefore we\r\nhave reason to believe, not that by the Moons motion about its Axis the\r\nEarth should be carried by a contemporary Period (whereby the same face of\r\nthe Moon should be ever towards us;) but that by the Earths revolution\r\nabout its Axis in 24. hours, the Moon should be carried about it in about\r\n29. dayes, without any motion on its own Axis: And accordingly, that the\r\n_Secondary_ Planets about _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_, are not (like their\r\n_Principals_) turned about their own Axis. And therefore I am not at all\r\ninclined to believe, that the _Menstrual_ Period of the Tides with us, is\r\nto be salved by such an Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn stead of this, that _Surmise_ of mine, (for I dare not yet, with\r\nconfidence give it any better name,) of what I have spoken to you\r\nheretofore, (and which hath occasioned this present account which I am now\r\ngiving you,) is to this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Earth and Moon being known to be Bodies of so great connexion (whether\r\nby any Magnetick, or what other Tye, I will not determine; nor need I, as\r\nto this purpose;) as that {272} the motion of the one follows that of the\r\nother; (The Moon observing the Earth as the Center of its _periodick_\r\nmotion:) may well enough be looked upon as _one Body_, or rather _one\r\nAggregate of Bodies_, which have _one common center of Gravity_; which\r\nCenter (according to the known Laws of _Staticks_) is in a streight Line\r\nconnecting their respective Centers, so divided as that its parts be in\r\nreciprocal proportion to the Gravities of the two Bodies. As for Example;\r\nSuppose the Magnitude (and therefore probably, the Gravity) of the Moon to\r\nbe about an _One and fourtieth part_ of that of the Earth; (and thereabouts\r\n_Hevelius_ in his _Selenography_ page 203. doth out of _Tycho_, estimate\r\nthe proportion; and an exact certainty is not necessary to our present\r\nbusinesse.) And the distance of the Moons Center from the Center of the\r\nEarth, to be about _fifty six Semidiameters_ of the Earth, (as thereabouts\r\nhe doth there estimate it, in its middle distance; and we need not be now\r\nvery accurate in determining the numbers; wherein Astronomers are not yet\r\nvery well agreed.) The distance of the Common Center of Gravity of the two\r\nBodies, will be from that of the Earth, about a two and fourtieth part of\r\nfifty six Semidiameters; that is, about 56/42 or 4/3 of a Semidiameter;\r\nthat is about 1/3 of a Semidiameter of the Earth, above its surface, in the\r\nAir, directly between the Earth and Moon.\r\n\r\nNow supposing the Earth and Moon, joyntly as one Body, carried about by the\r\nSun in the great Orb of the _Annual_ motion; this motion is to be\r\nestimated, (according to the Laws of _Staticks_, in other cases,) by the\r\nmotion of the common Center of Gravity of both Bodies. For we use in\r\n_Staticks_, to estimate a Body, or Aggregate of Bodies, to be moved\r\nupwards, downwards, or otherwise, so much as its Common Center of Gravity\r\nis so moved, howsoever the parts may change places amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly, the Line of the _Annual_ motion, (whether _Circular_ or\r\n_Elliptical_; of which I am not here to dispute,) will be described, not by\r\nthe Center of the Earth (as we commonly estimate it, making the Earth a\r\nPrimary and the Moon a Secondary Planet,) nor by the Center of the Moon,\r\n(as they would do, who make the Moon the Primary and the Earth a {273}\r\nSecondary Planet, against which we were before disputing:) But by the\r\n_Common Center of Gravity of the Bodies, Earth and Moon_, as one Aggregate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: See Fig. 2. and 3.]\r\n\r\nNow supposing A B C D E to be a part of the great Orb of the _Annual_\r\nmotion, described by the Common Center of Gravity, in so long time as from\r\na _Full-Moon_ at A to the next _New-Moon_ at E; (which, though an Arch of a\r\n_Circle_ or _Ellipse_, whose Center we suppose at a due distance below it;\r\nyet being put about 1/25 of the whole, may well enough be here represented\r\nby a streight Line:) the Center of the Earth at T, and that of the Moon at\r\nL, must each of them (supposing their common Center of Gravity to keep the\r\nLine A E) be supposed to describe a _Periphery_ about that Common Center,\r\nas the Moon describes her Line of _Menstrual_ motion (Of which I have (in\r\nthe _Scheme_) onely drawn that of the _Earth_; as being sufficient to our\r\npresent purpose; parallel to which, if need be, we may suppose one\r\ndescribed by the Moon; whose distance is also to be supposed much greater\r\nfrom T than in the _figure_ is expressed, or was necessary to expresse.)\r\nAnd in like manner E F G H I, from that _New moon_ at E, to the next\r\n_Full-moon_ at I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom A to E (from Full moon to New moon,) T moves (in its own _Epicycle_)\r\nupwards from the Sun: And from E to I, (from New moon to Full moon) it\r\nmoves downwards, toward the Sun. Again, from C to G, (from last quarter to\r\nthe following first quarter,) it moves _forwards according_ to the _Annual_\r\nmotion; But from G forward to C, (from the first Quarter to the ensuing\r\nlast Quarter,) it moves _contrary_ to the _Annual_ motion.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest therefore, according to this Hypothesis, that from Last\r\nquarter to First quarter (from C to G, while T is above the Line of the\r\n_Annual_ motion) its _Menstrual_ motion in its Epicycle _adds_ somewhat of\r\nAcceleration to the _Annual_ motion, and most of all at E, the New-moon:\r\nAnd from the first to the last quarter (from G forward to C, while T is\r\nbelow the Line of the _Annual_ motion,) it _abates_ of the _Annual_ motion;\r\nand most of all at I, or A the Full-moon.\r\n\r\nSo that in pursuance of _Galilæo's_ Notion, the _Menstrual_ {274} adding to\r\nor detracting from the _Annual_ motion, should either leave behinde, or\r\ncast forward, the loose waters incumbent on the Earth, (and thereby cause a\r\nTide, or accumulation of Waters) and most of all at the Full Moon and\r\nNew-moon, where those Accelerations or Retardations are greatest.\r\n\r\nNow this _Menstrual_ motion, if nothing else were superadded to the\r\n_Annual_, would give us two Tides in a moneth, and no more; (the one upon\r\nthe Acceleration, the other on the Retardation;) at New moon and Full-moon;\r\nand two Ebbs, at the two Quarters; and in the Intervals, Rising and Falling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut the _Diurnal_ motion superadded, doth the same to this _Menstrual_,\r\nwhich _Galilæo_ supposeth it to do to the _Annual_; that is, doth _Add_ to,\r\nor _Subtract_ from, the _Menstrual_ Acceleration or Retardation; and so\r\ngives us Tide upon Tide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor in whatsoever part of its Epicycle, we suppose T to be; yet because,\r\nwhile by its _Menstrual_ motion the Center moves in the Circle L T N; each\r\npoint in its surface, by its diurnal motion moves in the Circle L M N:\r\nwhatever effect (accelerative or tardative) the _Menstrual_ would give,\r\nthat effect by the _Diurnal_ is increased in the parts L M N (or rather l M\r\nn. the Semicircle) and most of all at M: but diminished in the parts N O L\r\n(or rather n O l) and most of all at O. So that at M, and O, (that is when\r\nthe Moon is in the _Meridian_ below or above the _Horizon_,) we are to have\r\nthe Diurnal Tide or High-water, occasioned by the greatest Acceleration or\r\nRetardation, which the _Diurnal_ Arch gives to that of the _Menstrual_:\r\nwhich seems to be the true cause of the _Daily Tides_. And withall gives an\r\naccount, not onely why it should be _every_ day; but like wise, why at\r\n_such a time_ of the day; and why this time should in a moneth run through\r\nthe whole 24 hours; _viz._ because the Moons coming to the _Meridian_ above\r\nand below the _Horizon_, (or as the Seamen call it, the _Moons Southing_,\r\nand _Northing_,) doth so: As likewise of the _Spring tides_ and\r\n_Neap-tides_. For, when it so happens, that the _Menstrual_ and _Diurnal_\r\nAccelerations or Retardations, be coincident, (as at New moons and\r\nFull-moons they are,) the effect must needs be the greater. And although\r\n(which is not to be dissembled) this happen {275} but to one of the two\r\nTides; that is, the Night-tide at the New-moon (when both motions do most\r\nof all Accelerate,) and the Day-tide at Full-moon (when both do most Retard\r\nthe _Annual_ motion;) Yet, this tide being thus raised by two concurrent\r\ncauses; though the next Tide have not the same cause also, the _Impetus_\r\ncontracted will have influence upon the next Tide; Upon a like reason, as a\r\n_Pendulum_ let fall from a higher Arch, will (though there be no new cause\r\nto occasion it) make the Vibration on the other side (beyond the\r\nPerpendicular) to be also greater: Or, of water in a broad Vessel, if it be\r\nso jogged, as to be cast forward to a good height above its Levell, will\r\nupon its recoyling, by its own gravity, (without any additional cause)\r\nmount so much the higher on the hinder part.\r\n\r\nBut here also we are to take notice, that though all parts of the Earth by\r\nits _Diurnal_ motion do turn about its Axis, and describe _parallel_\r\nCircles; yet not _equal_ Circles; but _greater_ neer the _Æquinoctial_, and\r\n_lesser_ near the _Poles_, which may be a cause why the Tides in some parts\r\nmay be much greater than in others. But this belongs to the _particular_\r\nconsiderations, (of which we are not now giving an Account:) not to the\r\n_general_ Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to give an account of the _Diurnal_ and _Menstrual_\r\nPeriods of Tides; It remains that I endeavour the like as to the _Annual_.\r\nOf which there is, at least, thus much agreed; That, at some times of the\r\nyear, the Tides are noted to be much higher, than at other times.\r\n\r\nBut here I have a double task; _First_, to rectify the Observation; and\r\n_then_, to give an account of it.\r\n\r\nAs to the _First_; It having been observed (grosly) that those high Tides\r\nhave used to happen about the _Spring_ and _Autumn_; it hath been generally\r\ntaken for granted (without any more nice observation) that the _two\r\nÆquinoxes_ are the proper times, to which these _Annual high Tides_ are to\r\nbe referred; And such causes sought for, as might best sute with such a\r\nSupposition.\r\n\r\nBut it is now, the best part of twenty years, since I have had frequent\r\noccasions to converse with some Inhabitants of _Rumney-marsh_ in _Kent_;\r\nwhere the Sea being kept out with great Earthen walls, that it do not at\r\nhigh water overflow the Levell; {276} and the Inhabitants livelyhood\r\ndepending most on grazing, or feeding Sheep; they are (as you may believe\r\nthey have reason to be) very vigilant and observant, at what times they are\r\nmost in danger of having their Lands drowned. And I find them generally\r\nagreed, by their constant Observations, (and Experience dearly bought) that\r\ntheir times of danger are about the beginning of _February_ and of\r\n_November_; that is, at those Spring Tides which happen near those times;\r\nto which they give the names of _Candlemass-stream_ and\r\n_Allhallond-stream_; And if they scape those Spring-tides, they apprehend\r\nthemselves out of Danger for the rest of the year. And as for _March_ and\r\n_September_ (the two _Æquinoxes_) they are as little solicitous of them, as\r\nof any other part of the year.\r\n\r\nThis, I confess, I much wondred at, when I first heard it; and suspected it\r\nto be but a mistake of him, that first told me, though he were indeed a\r\nperson not likely so to be mistaken, in a thing wherein he was so much\r\nconcerned: But I soon found, that it was not onely his, but a general\r\nobservation of others too; both there, and elsewhere along the Sea coast.\r\nAnd though they did not pretend to know any reason of it, (nor so much as\r\nto enquire after it;) Yet none made doubt of it; but would rather laugh at\r\nany that should talk of _March_ and _September_, as being the dangerous\r\ntimes. And since that time, I have my self very frequently observed (both\r\nat _London_ and elsewhere, as I have had occasion), that in those months of\r\n_February_ and _November,_ (especially _November_), the Tides have run much\r\nhigher, than at other times: Though I confess, I have not been so diligent\r\nto set down those Observations, as I should have done. Yet this I do\r\nparticularly very well remember, that in _November_ 1660. (the same year\r\nthat his Majesty returned) having occasion to go by Coach from the _Strand_\r\nto _Westminster_, I found the Water so high in the middle of _King-street_,\r\nthat it came up, not onely to the Boots, but into the Body of the Coach;\r\nand the _Pallace-yard_ (all save a little place near the _West-End_)\r\noverflow'd; as likewise the Market-place; and many other places; and their\r\nCellars generally filled up with Water. And in _November_ last, 1665. it\r\nmay yet be very well remembred, what very high Tides there were, not onely\r\non the Coasts of _England_, (where much hurt was {277} done by it) but much\r\nmore, in _Holland_, where by reason of those Inundations, many Villages and\r\nTowns were overflow'd. And though I cannot so particularly name other\r\nyears, yet I can very safely say, that I very often observed Tides\r\nstrangely high about those times of the year.\r\n\r\nThis Observation did for divers years cause me much to wonder, not only\r\nbecause it is so contrary to the received opinion of the two _Æquinoxes_;\r\nbut because I could not think of any thing signal at those times of the\r\nyear: as being neither the two _Æquinoxes_, nor the two _Solstices_, nor\r\nthe Sun's _Apogæum_ and _Perigæum_: (or Earths _Aphelium_ and\r\n_Perihelium_;) nor indeed, at contrary times of the year, which at least,\r\nwould seem to be expected. From _Alhollandtide_ to _Candlemass_ being but\r\nthree months; and from thence to _Alhollandtide_ again nine months.\r\n\r\nAt length it came into my mind, about four years since, that though there\r\ndo not about these times happen any _single_ signal Accident, which might\r\ncast it on these times, yet there is a _compound of two_ that may do it;\r\nWhich is the _Inequality_ of the _Natural day_ (I mean that of 24. hours,\r\nfrom noon to noon) arising at least from a double cause; either of which\r\nsingly would cast it upon other times, but both joyntly on those.\r\n\r\nIt's commonly thought, how unequal soever the length be of the _Artificial_\r\ndayes as contradistinguished to nights, yet that the _Natural_ Days,\r\nreckoning from noon to noon, are all _equal_: But _Astronomers_ know well,\r\nthat even these dayes are _unequal_.\r\n\r\nFor, this _Natural_ Day is measured _not onely_ by one intire conversion of\r\nthe _Æquinoctial_, or 24. _Æquinoctial_ hours, (which is indeed taken to be\r\nperformed in equal times,) _but_ increases by so much, as answers to that\r\npart of the _Sun's_ (or _Earths_,) Annual motion as is performed in that\r\ntime. For, when that part of the _Æquinoctial_, which (with the _Sun_) was\r\nthe _Meridian_ yesterday at noon, is come thither again to day, it is not\r\nyet _Noon_ (because the Sun is not now at the place where yesterday he was,\r\nbut is gone forward about one degree, more or less) but we must stay till\r\nthat place, where the _Sun_ now is, comes to the _Meridian_ before it be\r\nnow _Noon_.\r\n\r\nNow this Additament (above the 24 _Æquinoctial_ hours, or intire conversion\r\nof the _Æquinoctial_) is upon a double account {278} unequal. _First_,\r\nbecause the Sun, by reason of its _Apogæum_ and _Perigæum_, doth not at all\r\ntimes of the year dispatch in one day an equal Arch of the _Ecliptick_; but\r\ngreater Arches neer the _Perigæum_, which is about the middle of\r\n_December_; and lesser neer the _Apogæum_, which is about the middle of\r\n_June_: As will appear sufficiently by the _Tables_ of the Sun's Annual\r\nmotion. _Secondly_, though the Sun should in the _Ecliptick_ move alwaies\r\nat the same rate; yet equal Arches of the _Ecliptick_ do not in all parts\r\nof the _Zodiack_ answer to equal Arches of the _Æquinoctial_, by which we\r\nare to estimate time: Because some parts of it, as about the two\r\n_Solsticial_ Points, lie nearer to a _parallel_ position to the\r\n_Æquinoctial_, than others, as those about the two _Æquinoctial_ points,\r\nwhere the _Ecliptick_ and _Æquinoctial_ do intersect; whereupon an Arch of\r\nthe _Ecliptick_, neer the _Solsticial_ points answers to a greater Arch of\r\nthe _Æquinoctial_, than an Arch equal thereunto neer the _Æquinoctial_\r\npoints: As doth sufficiently appear by the _Tables_ of the Suns _right\r\nAscension_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _first_ of these causes, we should have the longest\r\n_natural_ daies in _December_, and the shortest in _June_, which if it did\r\noperate alone, would give us at those times two _Annual_ High-waters.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _second_ cause, if operating singly, we should have the\r\nlongest daies at the two Solstices in _June_ and _December_, and the two\r\nshortest at the _Æquinoxes_ in _March_ and _September_; which would at\r\nthose times give occasion of four _Annual_ High-waters.\r\n\r\nBut the true _Inequality_ of the Natural Days, arising from a _Complication\r\nof those two causes_, sometimes crossing and sometimes promoting each each\r\nother: though we should find some increases or decreases of the _Natural_\r\ndaies at all those seasons answerable to the respective causes (and perhaps\r\nof Tides proportionably thereunto:) yet the longest and shortest _natural\r\ndaies_ absolutely of the whole year (arising from this complication of\r\nCauses) are about those times of _Allhallontide_ and _Candlemas_; (or not\r\nfar from them) about which those _Annual_ High-tides are found to be: As\r\nwill appear by the _Tables of Æquation_ of _Natural_ daies. And therefore I\r\nthink, we may with very good reason cast this _Annual_ Period upon that\r\ncause, or rather {279} complication of causes. For (as we before shewed in\r\nthe _Menstrual_ and _Diurnal_) there will, by this inequality of Natural\r\ndaies, arise a _Physical_ Acceleration and Retardation of the Earths _Mean_\r\nmotion, and accordingly a casting of the Waters backward or forward; either\r\nof which, will cause an Accumulation or High-water.\r\n\r\n'Tis true, that these longest and shortest daies, do (according to the\r\n_Tables_, some at least) fall rather before, than after _Alhallontide_ and\r\n_Candlemas_ (to wit the ends of _October_ and _January_;) but so do also\r\n(sometimes) those high Tydes: And it is not yet so well agreed amongst\r\n_Astronomers_, what are all the Causes (and in what degrees) of the\r\nInequality of Natural daies; but that there be diversities among them,\r\nabout the true time: And whether the introducing of this New Motion of the\r\nEarth in its _Epicycle_ about this Common Center of _Gravity_, ought not\r\ntherein also to be accounted for, I will not now determine: Having already\r\nsaid enough, if not too much, for the explaining of this general\r\nHypothesis, leaving the particularities of it to be adjusted according to\r\nthe true measures of the motions; if the General Hypothesis be found fit to\r\nbe admitted.\r\n\r\nYet this I must add, (that I be not mistaken) that whereas I cast the time\r\nof the daily Tydes to be at all places, when the Moon is there in the\r\n_Meridian_; it must be understood of _open_ Seas, where the water hath such\r\nfree scope for its motions, as if the whole Globe of Earth were equally\r\ncovered with water: Well knowing, that in _Bayes_ and _In land-Channels_,\r\nthe position of the Banks and other like causes must needs make the times\r\nto be much different from what we suppose in the open Seas: And likewise,\r\nthat even in the Open Seas, _Islands_, and _Currents_, _Gulfs_ and\r\n_Shallows_, may have some influence, though not comparable to that of\r\n_Bays_ and _Channels_. And moreover, though I think, that Seamen do\r\ncommonly reckon the time of High-water in the _Open Seas_, to be then, when\r\nthe Moon is there in the _Meridian_ (as this Hypothesis would cast it:) Yet\r\nI do not take my self to be so well furnished with a _History of Tides_, as\r\nto assure my self of it; much less to accommodate it to particular places\r\nand cases.\r\n\r\nHaving thus dispatched the main of what I had to say {280} concerning the\r\nSeas Ebbing and Flowing: Had I not been already too tedious, I should now\r\nproceed to give a further reason, why I do introduce this consideration of\r\nthe _Common Center of Gravity_ in reference to _Astronomical Accounts_. For\r\nindeed, that which may possibly seem at first to be an Objection _against_\r\nit, is with me one reason _for_ it.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought perhaps, that if the Earth should thus describe an\r\n_Epicycle_ about the Common Center of Gravity, it would (by this its change\r\nof place) disturbe the _Cælestial_ motions; and make the _apparent_ places\r\nof the Planets, especially some of them, different from what they would\r\notherwise be. For though so small a removal of the Earth, as the _Epicycle_\r\nwould cause (especially if its _Semidiameter_ should not be above 1-1/3 of\r\nthe Earths Semidiameter) would scarce be sensible (if at all) to the\r\nremoter Planets; yet as to the nearer it might.\r\n\r\nNow though what _Galilæo_ answers to a like Objection in his _Hypothesis_;\r\n(that its possible there may be some small difference, which _Astronomers_\r\nhave not yet been so accurate, as to observe) might here perhaps serve the\r\nturn; Yet my answer is much otherwise; to wit, that such difference hath\r\nbeen observed and hath very much puzzeled _Astronomers_ to give an account\r\nof. About which you will find Mr. _Horrocks_ (in some of his Letters,\r\nwhereof I did formerly, upon the Command of the _Royal Society_, make an\r\n_Extract_) was very much perplexed; and was fain, for want of other relief,\r\nto have recourse to somewhat like _Keplers_ amicable _Fibres_, which did\r\naccording to the several positions of the Moon, accelerate or retard the\r\nMoon's motion; which _amicable Fibres_ he had no affection to at all (as\r\nthere appears) if he could any other waies give account of those little\r\ninequalities; and would much rather (I doubt not) have embraced this Notion\r\nof the Common Center of Gravity, to salve the _Phænomenon_, had it come to\r\nhis mind, or been suggested to him. And you find, that other _Astronomers_\r\nhave been seen to bring in (some upon one supposition, some upon another)\r\nsome kind of _Menstrual Æquation_, to solve the inequalities of the Moon's\r\nmotion, according to her _Synodical_ Revolution, or different Aspects (of\r\nNew-moon, Full Moon, &c.) beside what concerns her own _Periodical_ motion.\r\n{281}\r\n\r\nFor which, this consideration of the _Common Center of Gravity of the Earth\r\nand Moon_, is so proper a remedy (especially if it shall be found precisely\r\nto answer those _Phænomena_, which I have not Examined, but am very apt to\r\nbelieve) that it is so far from being, with me, an Objection against it,\r\nthat it is one of the reasons, which make me inclinable to introduce it.\r\n\r\nI must before I leave this, add one Consideration more, That if we shall\r\nupon these Considerations think it reasonable, thus to consider the _Common\r\nCenter of Gravity of the Earth and Moon_; it may as well be thought\r\nreasonable, that the like Consideration should be had of _Jupiter_ and his\r\nfour _Satellites_, which according to the Complication of their several\r\nmotions, will somewhat change the position of _Jupiter_, as to that _Common\r\ncenter of Gravity_ of all these Bodies; which yet, because of their\r\nsmallness, may chance to be so little, as that, at this distance, the\r\nchange of his apparent place may not be discernable. And what is said of\r\n_Jupiter_, is in the like manner to be understood of _Saturne_ and his\r\n_Satelles_, discovered by _Hugenius_: For all these _Satellites_ are to\r\ntheir _Principals_, as so many Moons to the Earth. And I do very well\r\nremember, in the Letters forecited, Mr. _Horrocks_ expresseth some such\r\nlittle inequalities in _Saturnes_ motion, of which he could not imagine\r\nwhat account to give, as if (to use his Expression) this crabbed _Old\r\nSaturn_ had despised his _Youth_. Which, for ought I know, might well\r\nenough have been accounted for, if at that time the _Satelles_ of _Saturn_\r\nhad been discovered, and that Mr. _Horrocks_ had thought of such a notion\r\nas the _Common Center of Gravity_ of _Saturn_ and his _Companion_, to be\r\nconsiderable, as to the guiding of his motion.\r\n\r\nYou have now, in obedience to your Commands, an Account of my thoughts, as\r\nto this matter, though yet immature and unpolished: What use you will\r\nplease to make of them, I shall leave to your prudence, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An _APPENDIX_, written by way of Letter to the _Publisher_; Being an\r\nanswer to some Objections, made by several Persons, to the precedent\r\nDiscourse._\r\n\r\nI Received yours; and am very well contented, that _objections_ be made\r\nagainst my _Hypothesis_ concerning _Tydes_: being {282} proposed but as a\r\nconjecture to be examined; and, upon that Examination, rectified, if there\r\nbe occasion; or rejected, if it will not hold water.\r\n\r\n1. To the first objection of those you mention; _That it appears not how\r\ntwo Bodies, that have no tye, can have one common Center of Gravity:_ that\r\nis (for so I understand the intendment of the objection) can act or be\r\nacted in the same manner, as if they were connected: I shall onely answer,\r\nthat it is harder to shew _How_ they have, than _That_ they have it. That\r\nthe Load-stone and Iron have somewhat equivalent to a Tye; though we see it\r\nnot, yet by the effects we know. And it would be easy to shew, that two\r\nLoad-stones, at once applyed, in different positions, to the same Needle,\r\nat some convenient distance, will draw it, not to point directly to either\r\nof them, but to some point between both; which point is, as to those two,\r\nthe _common Center of Attraction;_ and it is the same, as if some _one_\r\nLoad-stone were in that point. Yet have these two Load stones no connection\r\nor tye, though a _Common Center of Virtue_ according to which they joyntly\r\nact. And as to the present case, _How_ the Earth and Moon are connected; I\r\nwill not now undertake to shew (nor is it necessary to my purpose;) but,\r\nThat there is somewhat, that doth connect them, (as much as what connects\r\nthe Load-stone, and the Iron, which it draws,) is past doubt to those, who\r\nallow them to be carryed about by the Sun, as one Aggregate or Body, whose\r\nparts keep a respective position to one another: Like as _Jupiter_ with his\r\n_four Satellites_, and _Saturn_ with his _one_. Some Tye there is, that\r\nmakes those _Satellites_ attend their _Lords_, and move in a Body; though\r\nwe do not _See_ that Tye; nor _Hear_ the Words of Command. And so here.\r\n\r\n2. To the second objection; _That, at Chatham and in the Thames, the Annual\r\nSpring-tydes, happen about the Æquinoxes; not (as this Hypothesis doth\r\nsuppose elsewhere to have been observed) about the beginning of February\r\nand November._ If their meaning be, that Annual High Tydes, do then happen,\r\nand then onely: If this prove true, it will ease me of half my work. For it\r\nis then easily answered, that it depends upon the _Obliquity of the\r\nZodiack_; the parts of the Æquinoctial answering to equal parts of the\r\n{283} _Zodiack_, being neer the Solstitial points greatest, and near the\r\nÆquinoctial points least of all. But beside this _Annual Vicissitude of the\r\nÆquinoxes_, not to say, of the 4. Cardinal Points (which my Hypothesis doth\r\nallow and assert;) I believe it will be found, that there is _another\r\nAnnual vicissitude_ answering to the Suns _Apogæum_ and _Perigæum_. And\r\nthat the greatest Tydes of all, will be found to be upon a result of these\r\ntwo causes Cooperating: which (as doth the Inequality of Natural dayes,\r\ndepending on these same causes) will light nearer the times, I mention. To\r\nwhat is said to be observed at _Chatham_ and in the _Thames_, contrary to\r\nthat I allege as observed in _Rumney marsh_: I must at present [Greek:\r\napechein], and refer to a _melius inquirendum_. If those who object this\r\ncontrary observation, shall, after this notice, find, upon new Observations\r\nheedfully taken, that the _Spring-tydes_ in _February_ and _November_, are\r\nnot so high, as those in _March_ and _September_; I shall then think the\r\nobjection very considerable. But I do very well remember, that I have seen\r\nin _November_, very high Tydes at _London_, as well as in _Rumney Marsh_.\r\nAnd, the time is not yet so far past, but that it may be remembered (by\r\nyour self or others then in _London_) whether in _November_ last when the\r\nTydes were so high at _Dover_, at _Deal_, at _Margate_, and all along the\r\nCoast from thence to _Rumney Marsh_, as to do in some of those places much\r\nhurt, (and, in _Holland_, much more;) whether, I say, there were not also\r\nat the same time, at _London_, (upon the _Thames_) very high Tydes. But a\r\ngood _Diary_ of the Height and time both of High-water, and Low-water, for\r\na year or two together, even at _Chatham_, or _Greenwich_; but rather at\r\nsome place in the _open_ Sea, or at the _Lands end_ in _Cornwal_, or on the\r\n_West parts of Ireland_; or at St. _Hellens_, or the _Bermodas_, &c. would\r\ndo more to the resolving of this point, than any verbal discourse without\r\nit.\r\n\r\n3. To the third Objection, _That supposing the Earth and Moon to move about\r\na Common center of gravity; if that the highest Tydes be at the New-moon,\r\nwhen the moon being nearest to the Sun, the Earth is farthest from it, and\r\nits compound motion at the swiftest; and that the Tydes abate as the Earth\r\napproacheth nearer; till it comes into the supposed Circle of her Annual\r\nmotion: It may be demanded, why do they not still abate as the Earth comes\r\nyet nearer to the Sun; and the_ {284} _swiftnesse of its compound motion\r\nstill slackens? And so, why have we not Spring tides at the New Moon (when\r\nthe motion is swiftest) and Neap tides at Full Moon (when the motion is\r\nslowest) but Spring tides at both?_ The answer (if observed) is already\r\ngiven in my _Hypothesis_ it self. Because the effect is indifferently to\r\nfollow, either upon a suddain Acceleration, or a suddain Retardation. (Like\r\nas a loose thing, lying on a moving body; if the body be thrust suddainly\r\nforward, that loose thing is cast back, or rather left behind, not having\r\nyet obtained an equal _impetus_ with that of the body, on which it lyes;\r\nbut if stopped, or notably retarded, that loose incumbent is thrown\r\nforward, by its formerly contracted _impetus_ not yet qualified or\r\naccomodated to the slowness of the Body, on which it lyes.) Now both of\r\nthese happening, the one at the New Moon, the other at the Full Moon, do\r\ncause high Tides at both.\r\n\r\n4. To the fourth Objection, _That the highest Tydes are not at all places,\r\nabout the New Moon and Full Moon; and particularly, that, in some places of\r\nthe East Indies, the Highest Tydes are at the Quadratures_: I must first\r\nanswer in _general_; That as to the particular varieties of Tydes in\r\nseveral parts of the World, I cannot pretend to give a satisfactory\r\naccount, for want of a competent History of Tydes, &c. Because (as is\r\nintimated in what I wrote in the _general_) the various positions of\r\nChanels, Bays, Promontories, Gulfs, Shallows, Currents, Trade-winds, &c.\r\nmust needs make an innumerable variety of Accidents in particular places,\r\nof which no satisfactory account is to be given from the general\r\n_Hypothesis_ (though never so true) without a due consideration of all\r\nthose. Which is a task too great for me to undertake, being so ill\r\nfurnished with materials for it. And then as to the particular instance of\r\nsome places in the _East Indies_, where the highest Tydes are at the\r\n_Quadratures_: I suppose, it may be chiefly intended of those about\r\n_Cambaia_, and _Pegu_. At which places, beside that they are situate at the\r\ninmost parts of Vast Bayes, or Gulfs (as they are called) they have also\r\nvast In-draughts of some hundred Miles within Land; which when the Tydes\r\nare out, do lye (in a manner) quite dry: And may therefore very well be\r\nsupposed to participate the effect of the Menstrual Tydes many dayes after\r\nthe {285} cause of them happens in the open Sea, upon a like ground as in\r\nStraights and narrow Channels the Diurnall Tydes happen some hours later\r\nthan in the Ocean. And a like account must be given of particular accidents\r\nin other places, from the particular situation of those places, as _Bays_,\r\n_Chanels_, _Currents_, &c.\r\n\r\n5. To the 5. Objection, _That the Spring-Tydes happen not, with us, just at\r\nthe Full and Change, but two or three daies after_. I should with the more\r\nconfidence attempt an Answer, were I certain, whether it be so in the\r\n_Open_ Seas, or onely in our Channels. For the Answers will not be the same\r\nin both cases. If onely in our Channels, where the Tydes find a large\r\nin-draught; but not in the Open Seas: we must seek the reason of it from\r\nthe particular position of these places. But if it be so generally in the\r\nwide Open Seas: We must then seek a reason of it from the general\r\nHypothesis. And, till I know the matter of Fact, I know not well, which to\r\noffer at; lest whilst I attempt to salve one, I should fall foul of the\r\nother. I know that Marriners use to speak of Spring-Tydes at the New and\r\nFull of the Moon; though I have still had a suspition that it might be some\r\ndaies after, as well in the open Seas, as in our narrower Channels; (and\r\ntherefore I have chosen to say, in my Papers, _About_ the New and Full,\r\nrather than _At_ the New and Full; and even when I do say _At_, I intend it\r\nin that laxer sense in which I suppose the Marriners are to be understood,\r\nfor _Neer_ that time:) Of which suspition you will find some intimations\r\neven in my first Papers: But this though I can admit; yet, because I was\r\nnot sure of it, I durst not build upon it. The truth is, the Flux and\r\nReflux of water in a vessel, by reason of the jogging of it, though it\r\nfollow thereupon; yet is, for the most part, discernable some time after.\r\nFor there must, upon that jog, be some time for Motion, before the\r\nAccumulation can have made a Tyde. And so I do not know but that we must\r\nallow it in all the Periods. For as the _menstrual_ High Tyde, is not (at\r\nleast with us) till some Daies after the Full and Change; so is the\r\n_Diurnal_ High water, about as many Hours, after the Moons comming to\r\nSouth; (I mean, At Sea: for in Chanels it varies to all Hours, according as\r\nthey are neerer or further from the open Sea:) And the _Annual_ High-Tydes\r\nof _November_ and _February_; somewhat later than {286} (what I conjecture\r\nto be from the same causes) the greatest Inequalities of the natural Days,\r\nhappening in _January_ and _October_. But this though I can admit, yet\r\n(till I am sure of the matter of Fact) I do not build upon. And since it\r\nhath hitherto been the custome to speak with that laxness of expression;\r\nassigning the times of New-moon, Full-moon, and Quadratures, with the Moons\r\ncomming to South, for, what is neer those times: I did not think myself\r\nobliged in my conjectural Hypothesis (while it is yet but a _Candidate_) to\r\nspeak more nicely. If the Hypothesis for the maine of it be found Rational;\r\nthe Niceties of it are to be adjusted, in time, from particular\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given you some Answers to the Objections you signifie to have\r\nbeen made by several persons to my Hypothesis, and that in the same order\r\nyour Paper presents them to me; I shall next give you some account of the\r\ntwo _Books_, which you advised me to consult; so far as seems necessary to\r\nthis business; Which, upon your intimation, I have since perused, though\r\nbefore I had not.\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to that of _Isaac Vossius, De motu Marium & Ventorum_; Though\r\nI do not concur with him in his Hypothesis; That all the _Great motions of\r\nthe Seas_, &c. should arise onely from _so small a warming of the water_ as\r\nto raise it (where most of all) _not a Foot_ in perpendicular, (as in his\r\n12_th_ Chapter.) Or that there is no other connexion between the Moons\r\nmotion, and the Tydes _menstrual_ period, than a _casual Synchronism_\r\n(which seems to be the doctrine of his 16_th_ and 18_th_ Chapters;) Beside\r\nmany other things in his Philosophy, which I cannot allow: Yet I am well\r\nenough pleased with what is Historical in it, of the matter of Fact:\r\nEspecially if I may be secure, that he is therein accurate and candid, not\r\nwresting the _Phænomena_ to his own purpose. But I find nothing in it,\r\nwhich doth induce me to vary from my Hypothesis. For, granting his\r\nHistoricals to be all true; the account of the constant Current of the Sea\r\nWestward, and of the constant Eastern Blasts, &c. within the _Tropicks_, is\r\nmuch more plausibly, and (I suppose) truly rendered by _Galilæo_ long\r\nsince, from the Earths _Diurnal_ motion: (which, neare the _Æquator_,\r\ndescribing a greater Circle, than nearer the {287} _Poles_, makes the\r\nCurrent to be there more conspicuous and swift, and consequently, the Eddy,\r\nor recurrent motion, nearer the Poles, where this is, more remiss:) than\r\ncan easily be rendered by so small a Tumor, as he supposeth. Not to adde;\r\nthat his account of the Progressive motion, which he fansieth to follow\r\nupon this Tumefaction, and by Acceleration to grow to so great a height\r\nnear the Shoar (as in Chap. 13. and 14.) is a Notion, which seems to me too\r\nextravagant to be salved by any laws of _Staticks_. And that of the Moons\r\nmotion onely Synchronizing with the Tydes, casually, without any _Physical_\r\nconnexion; I can very hardly assent to. For it can hardly be imagined, that\r\nany such constant _Synchronisme_ should be in Nature; but where, either the\r\none is the cause of the other, or both depend upon some _Common_ cause. And\r\nwhere we see so fair a foundation for a _Physical_ connection. I am not\r\nprone to ascribe it to an Independent Sychronism. In sum; His History doth\r\nwell enough agree with my Hypothesis; and I think, the Phænomena are much\r\nbetter salved by mine, than his.\r\n\r\nAnd then as to _Gassendus_, in his discourse _De Æstu Maris_; I find him,\r\nafter the relating of many other Opinions concerning the Cause of it,\r\ninclining to that of _Galilæo_, ascribing it to the Acceleration &\r\nRetardation of the Earths motion, compounded of the Annual and Diurnal; And\r\nmoreover attempting to give an account of the _Menstrual Periods_ from the\r\nEarths carrying the Moon about it self, as _Jupiter_ doth his _Satellites_;\r\nwhich together with them is carryed about by the _Sun_, as one Aggregate;\r\n(and that the Earth with its Moon is to be supposed in like manner to be\r\ncarried about by the Sun, as one Aggregate, cannot be reasonably doubted,\r\nby those who entertain the _Copernican Hypothesis_, and do allow the same\r\nof _Jupiter_ and his _Satellites_.) But though he would thus have the Earth\r\nand Moon looked upon as two parts of the same moved Aggregate, yet he doth\r\nstill suppose (as _Galilæo_ had done before him) that the line of the Mean\r\nMotion of this Aggregate (or, as he calls, _motus æquabilis et veluti\r\nmedius_) is described by the _Center_ of the _Earth_ (about which Center he\r\nsupposeth both its own revolution to be made, and an Epicycle described by\r\nthe Moons motion;) not by another Point, distinct from the Centers of both,\r\nabout which, as the {288} common Center of Gravity, as well that of the\r\nEarth, as that of the Moon, are to describe several Epicycles. And, for\r\nthat Reason fails of giving any clear account of this _Menstrual_ Period.\r\n(And in like manner, he proposeth the Consideration as well of the Earths\r\n_Aphelium_ and _Perihelium_ as of the _Æquinoctial_ and _Solstitial_\r\nPoints, in order to the finding a Reason of the _Annual_ Vicissitudes; but\r\ndoth not fix upon any thing, in which himself can Acquiesce: And therefore\r\nleaves it _in medio_ as he found it.)\r\n\r\nIt had been more agreeable to the Laws of _Staticks_, if he had, (as I do,)\r\nso considered the _Earth_ and _Moon_ as two parts of the same movable, (not\r\nso, as he doth, _aliam in Centro et sequentem præcise revolutionem axis,\r\naliam remotius ac velut in circumferentia_, but,) so, as to make neither of\r\nthem the Center, but both out of it, describing Epicycles about it: Like\r\nas, when a long stick thrown in the Air, whose one end is heavyer than the\r\nother, is whirled about, so as that the End, which did first fly foremost,\r\nbecomes hindmost; the proper line of motion of this whole Body is not that,\r\nwhich is described by either End, but that, which is described by a middle\r\npoint between them; about which point each end, in whirling, describes an\r\nEpicycle. And indeed, in the present case, it is not the Epicycle described\r\nby the Moon, but that, described by the Earth, which gives the _Menstrual_\r\nVicissitudes of motion to the Water; which would, as to this, be the same,\r\nif the Earth so move, whether there were any Moon to move or not; nor would\r\nthe Moons Motion, supposing the Earth to hold on its own course, any whit\r\nconcern the motion of the Water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut now, (after all our Physical, or Statical Considerations) the clearest\r\nEvidence for this Hypothesis (if it can be had) will be from Celestial\r\nObservations. As for instance; (see _Fig._ 5.) Supposing the Sun at S; the\r\nEarths place in its Annual Orb at T; and _Mars_ (in opposition to the Sun,\r\nor near it) at M: From whence _Mars_ should appear in the Zodiack at\r\n[gamma], and will at Full moon be seen there to be; the Moon being at C and\r\nthe Earth at c; (and the like at the New-moon.) But if the Moon be in the\r\nFirst quarter at A, and the Earth at a: _Mars_ will be seen, not at\r\n[gamma], but at [alpha]; too slow: And when the Moon is at B, and the Earth\r\nat b, _Mars_ will be seen at [beta]; yet too slow: till at the {289}\r\nFull-moon, the Moon at C, the Earth at c, _Mars_ will be seen at [gamma],\r\nits true place, as if the Earth were at T. But then, after the Full, the\r\nMoon at D, the Earth at d; _Mars_ will be seen, not at [gamma], but at\r\n[delta], too forward: and yet more, when the Moon (at the last Quarter) is\r\nat E, the Earth at e, and _Mars_ seen at [epsilon]. If therefore _Mars_\r\n(when in opposition to the Sun) be found (all other allowances being made)\r\nsomewhat too backward before the Full moon, and somewhat too forward after\r\nthe Full-moon, (and most of all, at the Quadratures:) it will be the best\r\nconfirmation of the Hypothesis. (The like may be fitted to _Mars_ in other\r\npositions, _mutatis mutandis_; and so for the other Planets.)\r\n\r\nBut this proof, is of like nature as that of the Parallaxis of the Earths\r\nAnnual Orb to prove the Copernican Hypothesis. If it can be observed, it\r\nproves the Affirmative; but if it cannot be observed, it doth not convince\r\nthe Negative, but only proves that the Semidiameter of the Earths Epicycle\r\nis so small as not to make any discernable Parallax. And indeed, I doubt,\r\nthat will be the issue. For the Semidiameter of this Epicycle, being little\r\nmore than the Semidiameter of the Earth it self, or about 1-1/3 thereof (as\r\nis conjectured, in the _Hypothesis_, from the Magnitudes and Distances of\r\nthe Earth and Moon compared;) and there having not as yet been observed any\r\ndiscernable _Parallax_ of _Mars_, even in his neerest position to the\r\nEarth; it is very suspicious, that here it may prove so too. And whether\r\nany of the other Planets will be more favourable in this point, I cannot\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_ANIMADVERSIONS of Dr. _Wallis_, upon Mr. _Hobs_'s late Book, _De\r\nPrincipiis & Ratiocinatione Geometrarum_._\r\n\r\nThese were communicated by way of Letter, written in _Oxford_, July 24.\r\n1666. to an Acquaintance of the _Author_, as follows:\r\n\r\nSince I saw you last, I have read over Mr. _Hobs_'s Book _Contra Geometras_\r\n(or _De Principiis & Ratiocinatione Geometrarum_) which you then shewed me.\r\nA New Book of _Old_ matter: Containing but a _Repetition_ of what he had\r\nbefore told us, more than once; and which hath been Answered long agoe.\r\n\r\nIn which, though there be Faults enough to offer ample {290} matter for a\r\nlarge Confutation; yet I am scarce inclined to believe, that any will\r\nbestow so much pains upon it. For, if that be true, which (in his\r\n_Preface_) he saith of himself, _Aut solus insanio Ego, aut solus non\r\ninsanio_: it would either be _Needless_, or _to no Purpose_. For, by his\r\nown confession, _All others_, if they be not mad themselves, ought to think\r\n_Him_ so: And therefore, as to _Them_ a Confutation would be _needless_;\r\nwho, its like, are well enough satisfied already: at least out of danger of\r\nbeing seduced. And, as to himself, it would be _to no purpose_. For, if\r\n_He_ be the Mad man, it is not to be hoped that he will be convinced by\r\nReason: Or, if _All We_ be so; we are in no capacity to attempt it.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another Reason, why I think it not to need a Confutation.\r\nBecause what is in it, hath been sufficiently confuted already; (and, so\r\nEffectually; as that he professeth himself not to Hope, that _This Age_ is\r\nlike to give sentence for him; what ever _Nondum imbuta Posteritas_ may\r\ndo.) Nor doth there appear any Reason, why he should again Repeat it,\r\nunless he can hope, That, what was at first False, may by oft Repeating,\r\nbecome True.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore, instead of a large Answer, onely give you a brief\r\nAccount, _what is in it_; &, _where it hath been already Answered_.\r\n\r\nThe chief of what he hath to say, in his first 10 Chapters, against\r\n_Euclids_ Definitions, amounts but to this, That he thinks, _Euclide_ ought\r\nto have allowed his _Point_ some _Bigness_; his _Line_, some _Breadth_; and\r\nhis _Surface_, some _Thickness_.\r\n\r\nBut where in his _Dialogues_, pag. 151, 152. he solemnly undertakes to\r\nDemonstrate it; (for it is there, his 41th _Proposition_:) his\r\nDemonstration amounts to no more but this; That, _unless a Line be allowed\r\nsome Latitude; it is not possible that his Quadratures can be True_. For\r\nfinding himself reduced to these inconveniences; 1. That his _Geometrical\r\nConstructions_, would not consist with _Arithmetical calculations_, nor\r\nwith what _Archimedes_ and others have long since demonstrated: 2. That the\r\n_Arch_ of a Circle must be allowed to be sometimes _Shorter_ than its\r\n_Chord_, and sometimes _longer_ than its _Tangent_: 3. That the same\r\nStraight Line must be allowed, at one place onely to _Touch_, and at\r\nanother place to _Cut_ the same Circle: (with others of like nature;) He\r\nfindes it necessary, that these things may not seem Absurd, to allow his\r\n_Lines_ some _Breadth_, (that so, as he speaks, _While a Straight Line with\r\nits Out-side doth at one place {291} Touch the Circle, it may with its\r\nIn-side at another place Cut it_, &c.) But I shou'd sooner take this to be\r\na _Confutation of His Quadratures_, than a _demonstration of the Breadth of\r\na _(Mathematical)_ Line_. Of which, see my _Hobbius Heauton-timorumenus_,\r\nfrom _pag._ 114. to p. 119.\r\n\r\nAnd what he now Adds, being to this purpose; That though _Euclid_'s [Greek:\r\nSêmeion], which we translate, _a Point_, be not indeed _Nomen Quanti_; yet\r\ncannot this be actually represented by any thing, but what will have some\r\nMagnitude; nor can _a Painter_, no not _Apelles_ himself, draw a _Line_ so\r\nsmall, but that it will have some Breadth; nor can _Thread_ be spun so\r\nFine, but that it will have some Bigness; (_pag._ 2, 3, 19, 21.) is nothing\r\nto the Business; For _Euclide_ doth not speak either of such _Points_, or\r\nof such _Lines_.\r\n\r\nHe should rather have considered of his own Expedient, _pag._ 11. That,\r\nwhen one of his (_broad_) Lines, passing through one of his (_great_)\r\nPoints, is supposed to cut another Line proposed, into two equal parts; we\r\nare to understand, the _Middle of the breadth_ of that Line, passing\r\nthrough the _middle_ of that Point, to distinguish the Line given into two\r\nequal parts. And he should then have considered further, that _Euclide_, by\r\na _Line_, means no more than what Mr. _Hobs_ would call _the middle of the\r\nbreadth_ of his; and _Euclide_'s _Point_, is but the _Middle_ of Mr.\r\n_Hobs_'s. And then, for the same reason, that Mr. _Hobs_'s _Middle_ must be\r\nsaid to have no _Magnitude_; (For else, not the _whole Middle_, but the\r\n_Middle of the Middle_, will be _in the Middle_: And, the _Whole_ will not\r\nbe equal to its _Two Halves_; but Bigger than _Both_, by so much as the\r\n_Middle_ comes to:) _Euclide_'s _Lines_ must as well be said to have no\r\nBreadth; and his _Points_ no Bigness.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, When _Euclide_ and others do make the _Terme_ or _End_ of a\r\nLine, a _Point_: If this _Point_ have _Parts_ or _Greatness_, then not the\r\n_Point_, but the _Outer-Half_ of this Point ends the Line, (for, that the\r\n_Inner-Half_ of that Point is not at the End, is manifest, because the\r\n_Outer-Half_ is beyond it:) And again, if that _Outer Half_ have _Parts_\r\nalso; not this, but the _Outer_ part of it, and again the _Outer part_ of\r\nthat _Outer part_, (and so in _infinitum_.) So that, as long as _Any thing\r\nof Line_ remains, we are not yet at the _End_: And consequently, if we must\r\nhave passed the _whole Length_, before we be at the _End_; then that _End_\r\n(or _Punctum terminans_) has _nothing of Length_; (for, when the _whole\r\nLength_ is past, there is nothing of it left.) And if Mr. _Hobs_ tells us\r\n(as _pag._ 3.) that this {292} _End_ is not _Punctum_, but only _Signum_\r\n(which he does allow _non esse nomen Quanti_) even _this_ will serve our\r\nturn well enough. _Euclid_'s [Greek: Sêmeion], which some Interpreters\r\nrender by _Signum_, others have thought fit (with _Tully_) to call\r\n_Punctum_: But if Mr. _Hobs_ like not that name, we will not contend about\r\nit. Let it be _Punctum_, or let it be _Signum_ (or, if he please, he may\r\ncall it _Vexillum_.) But then he is to remember, that this is only a\r\nControversie in _Grammar_, not in _Mathematicks_: And his Book should have\r\nbeen intitled _Contra Grammaticos_, not, _Contra Geometras_. Nor is it\r\n_Euclide_, but _Cicero_, that is concern'd, in rendring the Greek [Greek:\r\nSêmeion] by the Latine _Punctum_, not by Mr. _Hobs_'s _Signum_. The\r\nMathematician is equally content with either word.\r\n\r\nWhat he saith here, _Chap._ 8. & 19. (and in his fifth _Dial._ p. 105. &c.)\r\nconcerning the _Angle of Contact_; amounts but to thus much, That, by the\r\n_Angle of Contact_, he doth not mean either what _Euclide_ calls an\r\n_Angle_, or any thing of that kind; (and therefore says nothing to the\r\npurpose of what was in controversie between _Clavius_ and _Peletarius_,\r\nwhen he says, that _An Angle of Contact hath some magnitude_:) But, that by\r\nthe _Angle of Contact_, he understands the _Crookedness of the Arch_; and\r\nin saying, the _Angle of Contact hath some magnitude_, his meaning is, that\r\nthe _Arch of a Circle hath some crookedness_, or, is a _crooked line_: and\r\nthat, of equal Arches, That is the more crooked, whose chord is shortest:\r\nwhich I think none will deny; (for who ever doubted, but that a _circular\r\nArch is crooked_? or, that, of such Arches, equal in length, _That is the\r\nmore crooked, whose ends by bowing are brought nearest together_?) But, why\r\nthe _Crookedness of an Arch_, should be called an _Angle of Contact_, I\r\nknow no other reason, but, because Mr. _Hobs_ loves to call that _Chalk_,\r\nwhich others call _Cheese_. Of this see my _Hobbius Heauton-timorumenus_,\r\nfrom _pag._ 88. to p. 100.\r\n\r\nWhat he saith here of _Rations_ or _Proportions_, and their _Calculus_; for\r\n8. Chapters together, (_Chap._ 11. _&c,_) is but the same for substance,\r\nwhat he had formerly said in his 4th. Dialogue, and elsewhere. To which you\r\nmay see a full Answer, in my _Hobbius Heauton-tim._ from _pag._ 49. to p.\r\n88. which I need not here repeat.\r\n\r\nOnely (as a _Specimen_ of Mr. _Hobs_'s Candour, in Falsifications) you may\r\nby the way observe, how he deals a Demonstration of Mr. _Rook_'s, in\r\nconfutation of Mr. _Hobs_'s Duplication of the Cube. Which when he had\r\nrepeated, _pag._ 43. He doth then (that it might seem absurd) change those\r\nwords, _æquales {293} quatuor cubis_ DV; (_pag._ 43. _line_ 33.) into these\r\n(p. 44. l. 5.) _æqualia quatuor Lineis, nempe quadruplus Recta_ DV: And\r\nwould thence perswade you, that Mr. _Rook_ had assigned a _Solide_, equal\r\nto a _Line_. But Mr. _Rook's_ Demonstration was clear enough without Mr.\r\n_Hobse's_ Comment. Nor do I know any Mathematician (unless you take _Mr.\r\nHobs_ to be one) who thinks that _a Line multiplyed by a Number will make a\r\nSquare_; (what ever _Mr. Hobs_ is pleased to teach us.) But, That _a Number\r\nmultiplyed by a Number, may make a Square Number_; and, That _a Line drawn\r\ninto a Line may make a Square Figure_, _Mr. Hobs_ (if he were, what he\r\nwould be thought to be) might have known before now. Or, (if he had not\r\nbefore known it) he might have learned, (by what I shew him upon a like\r\noccasion, in my _Hob. Heaut._ _pag._ 142. 143. 144.) _How_ to understand\r\nthat language, without an Absurdity.\r\n\r\nJust in the same manner he doth, in the next page, deal with _Clavius_, for\r\nhaving given us his words, pag. 45 l. 3. 4. _Dico hanc Lineam\r\nPerpendicularem extra circulum cadere_ (because neither _intra Circulum_,\r\nnor in _Peripherea_;) He doth, when he would shew an errour, first make\r\none, by falsifying his word, _line_ 15. where instead of _Lineam\r\nPerpendicularem_, he substitutes _Punctum A._ As if _Euclide_ or _Clavius_\r\nhad denyed the _Point A._ (the utmost point of the _Radius_,) to be in the\r\nCircumference: Or, as if Mr. _Hobs_, by proving the _Point A._ to be in the\r\nCircumference, had thereby proved, that the _Perpendicular Tangent A E_ had\r\nalso lyen in the Circumference of the Circle. But this is a Trade, which\r\nMr. _Hobs_ doth drive so often, as if he were as well faulty in his\r\n_Morals_, as in his _Mathematicks_.\r\n\r\nThe _Quadrature of a Circle_, which here he gives us, _Chap._ 20. 21. 23.\r\nis one of those _Twelve_ of his, which in my _Hobbius Heauton-timorumenus_\r\n(from _pag._ 104. to _pag._ 119) are already confuted: And is the _Ninth_\r\nin order (as I there rank them) which is particularly considered, _pag._\r\n106. 107. 108. I call it _One_, because he takes it so to be; though it\r\nmight as well be called _Two_. For, as there, so here, it consisteth of\r\n_Two branches_, which are Both false; and each overthrow the other. For if\r\nthe _Arch of a Quadrant_ be equal to the _Aggregate of the Semidiameter and\r\nof the Tangent of 30. Degrees_, (as he would _Here_ have it, in _Chap._ 20.\r\nand _There_, in the close of _Prop._ 27;) Then is it not equal to _that\r\nLine, Whose Square is equal to Ten squares of the Semiradius_, (as,\r\n_There_, he would have it, in _Prop._ 28. and, _Here_, in _Chap. 23._) And\r\nif it be equal to _This_, then not to _That_. For _This_, and _That_, are\r\nnot equal: As I then demonstrated; and need not now repeat it.\r\n\r\nThe grand Fault of his Demonstration (_Chap._ 20.) wherewith he would now\r\nNew vamp his old false quadrature, lyes in those Words _Page_ 49. _line_\r\n30, 31. _Quod Impossibile est nisi _ba_ transeat per _c_._ which is no\r\nimpossibility at all. For though he first bid us _draw the Line R c_, and\r\nafterwards the _Line R d_; Yet, Because he hath no where proved (nor is it\r\ntrue) that _these two are the same Line_; (that is, that the point _d_ lyes\r\nin the _Line R c_, or that _R c_ passeth through _d_:) His proving that _R\r\nd cuts off from _ab_ a Line equal to the Sine of R c_, doth not prove, that\r\n_ab_ passeth through _c_: For this it may well do though _ab_ lye _under\r\nc._ (vid. in case _d_ lye beyond the line _R c._ that is, further from\r\n_A_:) And therefore, unless he first prove (which he cannot do) that _A c_\r\n( a sixth part of _A D_) doth just reach to the line _R c_ and no further,\r\nhe only proves {294} that a sixth part of _ab_ is _equal_ to the Sine of\r\n_B c_. But, whether it _lye above it_, or _below_ it, or (as Mr. _Hobs_\r\nwould have it) just _upon_ it; this argument doth not conclude. (And\r\ntherefore _Hugenius's_ assertion, which Mr. _Hobs_, _Chap._ 21. would have\r\ngive way to this Demonstration, doth, notwithstanding this, remain safe\r\nenough.)\r\n\r\nHis demonstration of _Chap._ 23. (where he would prove, that _the aggregate\r\nof the Radius and of the Tangent of 30. Degrees_ is equal to _a Line, whose\r\nsquare is equal to 10 Squares of the Semiradius_;) is confuted not only by\r\nme, (in the place forecited, where this is proved to be impossible;) but by\r\nhimself also, in this same Chap. _pag._ 59. (where he proves sufficiently\r\nand doth confesse, that this demonstration, and the 47. _Prop._ of the\r\nfirst of _Euclide_, cannot be both true.) But, (which is worst of all;)\r\nwhether _Euclid's_ Proposition be False or True, his demonstration must\r\nneeds be False. for he is in this Dilemma: If that Proposition be _True_,\r\nhis demonstration is _False_, for he grants that they cannot be both True,\r\n_page_ 59 _line_ 21. 22. And again, if that Proposition be False, his\r\nDemonstration is so too; for _This_ depends upon _That_, _page_ 55. _line_\r\n22. and therefore must fall with it.\r\n\r\nBut the Fault is obvious in _His Demonstration_ (not in _Euclid's\r\nProposition_:) the grand Fault of it (though there are more) lyes in those\r\nwords, _page_ 56. _line_ 26. _Erit ergo M O minus quam M R_ Where, instead\r\nof _minus_, he should have said _majus_. And when he hath mended that\r\nError, he will find, that the _major_ in _page_ 56. _line penult_, will\r\nvery well agree with _majorem_ in _page_ 57. _line_ 4 (where the _Printer_\r\nhath already mended the Fault to his hand) and then the _Falsum ergo_ will\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nHis Section of an Angle _in ratione data_, _Chap._ 22 hath no other\r\nfoundation, than his supposed _Quadrature_ of _Chap._ 20. And therefore,\r\nthat being false, this must fall with it. It is just the same with that of\r\nhis 6. Dialogue, _Prop._ 46. which (besides that it wants a foundation) how\r\nabsurd it is, I have already shewed, in my _Hobbius Heauton-timor._ _page_\r\n119. 120.\r\n\r\nHis _Appendix_, wherein he undertakes to shew a Method of finding _any\r\nnumber of mean Proportionals, between two Lines given_: Depends upon the\r\nsupposed Truth of his 22. Chapter; about _Dividing an Arch in any\r\nproportion given_: (As himself professeth: and as is evident by the\r\nConstruction; which supposeth such a Section.) And therefore, that failing,\r\nthis falls with it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this is other wise faulty, though _that_ should be supposed True.\r\nFor, In the first Demonstration; _page_ 67. _line_ 12. _Producta L f\r\nincidet in I_; is not proved, nor doth it follow from his _Quoniam igitur_.\r\n\r\nIn the second Demonstration; _page_ 68. _line_ 34. 35. _Recta L f incidit\r\nin x_; is not proved; nor doth it follow from his _Quare_.\r\n\r\nIn his third Demonstration; _page_ 71: _line_ 7. _Producta _Y P_ transibit\r\nper _M_;_ is said _gratis_; nor is any proof offered for it. And so this\r\nwhole structure falls to the ground. And withall, the _Prop._ 47. _El._ 1\r\ndoth still stand fast (which he tells us, _page_ 59, 61, 78. must have\r\nFallen, if his Demonstrations had stood:) And so, _Geometry_ and\r\n_Arithmetick_ do still agree, which (he tells us, _page_ 78: _line_ 10.)\r\nhad otherwise been at odds.\r\n\r\nAnd this (though much more might have been said,) is as much as need to be\r\nsaid against that Piece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted with Licence for _John Martyn_, and _James Allestry_, Printers to\r\nthe Royal Society.\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Num._ 17.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _Septemb._ 9. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _Observations made in several places (at _London_, _Madrid_ and\r\n    _Paris_,) of the late _Eclipse of the Sun_, which hapned _June_ 22.\r\n    1666.

'\r\n           { 3/11 diam.        at 6.  00     | 5 dig.     at 7. 06\r\n           {    4 digits       at 6.  07     | 4 dig.     at 7. 13\r\n   It was  {    5 dig.         at 6.  13     | 3 dig.     at 7. 20\r\n   darkned,{    6 dig.         at 6.  21     | 2 dig.     at 7. 26\r\n           {    7 dig.         at 6.  39½    | 1 dig.     at 7. 32\r\n           {    6 dig.         at 6.  57     | 0 dig.     at 7. 37\r\n\r\nIts _Duration_ hence appears to have been one hour and 54 m. Its _greatest\r\nObscurity_ somewhat more than 7. digits. About the middle, between the\r\nPerpendicular and Westward Horizontal _Radius_ the Sun, viewing it through\r\nMr. _Boyle_'s 60. foot-_Telescope_, there was perceived a little of the\r\nLimb of the Moon without the Diske of the Sun: which seemed to some of the\r\nObservers to come from some shining _Atmosphere_ about the Body either of\r\nthe Sun or Moon.\r\n\r\nThey affirm to have observ'd the _Figure_ of this _Eclipse_, and measured\r\nthe {296} _Digits_, by casting the _Figure_ through a 5 foot _Telescope_,\r\non an extended paper, fix't at a certain distance from the Eye-glasse, and\r\nhaving a round figure; all whose _Diameters_ were divided, by 6\r\n_Concentrick_ Circles, into 12 _Digits_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Observations made at _Madrid_ by a Noble Member of the _Royal Society_,\r\nHis Excellence the Earle of _Sandwich_, as they were sent to the Right\r\nHonourable, the Lord Vice-Count _Brounker_, are these;\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse _began_ at _Madrid_ about 5 of the Clock in the morning, at 5\r\nh. 15', the Suns _Altitude_ was 6 deg. 55'.\r\n\r\nThe _Middle_ of it was at 6 h. 2', the Suns _Altitude_, 15. deg. 5'.\r\n\r\nThe _End_ was exactly at 7 h. 5'; the Suns _Altitude_, 25. deg. 24'.\r\n\r\nThe _Duration_, 2h. 4'.\r\n\r\n37. Parts of the Suns diameter remained light.\r\n\r\n63. Parts of the same were darkened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Observations made at _Paris_ by Monsieur _Payen_, assisted by several\r\n_Astronomers_, as they were printed in _French_, and addressed to Monsieur\r\nde _Montmor_, are these;\r\n\r\nThe _Eclipse_ began there, at 5 h. 44'. 52\". _mane_. It ended at 7 h. 43'.\r\n6\". So that its _whole Duration_ was 1 h. 58'. 14\". The _greatest\r\nObscuration_ they assign to have been 7. dig. 50. m. but they adde, that it\r\nseem'd to have been greater by 3 minuts; which M. _Payen_ imputes to a\r\nparticular motion of _libration_ of the Suns Globe, which entertain'd that\r\nLuminary in the same _Phasis_ for the space of 8. _min._ and some\r\n_seconds_, as if it had been stopped in the midst of its Course; rather\r\nthan to a tremulous Motion of the _Atmosphere_, as _Scheiner_ would have\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThey intimate that they took the time of each _Phasis_ from half _digit_ to\r\nhalf _digit_, as well by a _Pendulum_, as by the _Altitudes_ of the _Suns\r\nCenter_ above the _Horizon_, corrected by the _Verticall Paralaxes_ and\r\n_Æstivall Refractions_, by which they judged, that though the Time by the\r\n_Pendulum_ may be sufficient for _Mechanicall_ Operations, yet 'tis not\r\nexact enough for establishing the _Grounds of true Astronomy_.\r\n\r\nThey further conceive that the apparent _Diameters_ were almost equal;\r\nseeing that in the _Phasis_ of 6. _Digits_, the _Circumference_ of the\r\n_Moons disk_ passed through the _Center_ of that of the _Sun_, so as that\r\ntwo Lines drawn through the two _Horns_ of the Sun, made with the _Common\r\nSemi-diameter_ two _Equilateral Triangles_.\r\n\r\nNext, they affirm, That there was so great a Variation in the _Parallaxes_,\r\nby reason as well of the Refractions of the Air, which environs the Earth,\r\nas of the Alteration of the Air, which encompasses the Moon, that the\r\n_Horns_ of the Sun, there formed by the Shaddow of the Moon, appeared in\r\nall kinds of _Figures_; Sometimes inclined to the _Vertical_, sometimes\r\n_Perpendicular_ to the _Horizon_, and at last _Parallel_; the _Convexe_\r\npart respecting the _Heaven_, and the _Concave_, the _Horizon_. By the\r\ncrossing (_so they go on_) of the {297} _Horns_ with the _Angles of\r\nInclination_, it will be easie to those, that have exactly observed them,\r\nand that are skill'd in the higher _Astronomical_ Calculations, to compute\r\nthe _true Place_ of the _Moon_ in her _Orbite_, that so it may be compared\r\nwith that of the _Tables_, and with that, which has been observ'd in other\r\nplaces, for the more precise determinating of the _Difference_ of\r\n_Meridians_ (that being the way, esteem'd by _Kepler_ the most certain) and\r\nfor making a good Judgment of the defect or exactnesse of the Celestial\r\n_Tables_.\r\n\r\nThen they observe, That the _Beginning_ and the _Middle_ of this _Eclipse_\r\nhapned to be in the _North Eastern Hemisphere_, and the _End_, in the\r\n_South-Eastern_. The _first Contact_ (as 'twere) of the two Disks was\r\nobserv'd in the _Superior Limb_ of the _Suns Disk_ in respect to the\r\n_Vertical Line_, and in the _Inferior_ in respect to the _Ecliptick_: But\r\nthe _Middle_, and the _End_ were seen in the _Superior Limb_, in respect\r\nboth to the _Vertical_ and the _Ecliptick_: And (what to this Author seems\r\nextraordinary) both the _Beginning_ and the _End_ of this _Eclipse_ hapned\r\nto be in the _Oriental_ part of the Suns Disk.\r\n\r\nLastly, they take notice, that by their Observations it appears, that there\r\nis but little exactness in all the _Astronomical Tables_, predicting the\r\n_Quantity_, _Beginning_ and _Duration_ of this Eclipse; Those of\r\n_Lansbergius_ importing, That the Obscuration should be of 10. dig. 48';\r\nthose of _Ricciolo_, of 9. dig. 1'; and those of _Kepler_, of 7. dig. 30'.\r\n16\": Again, that the _Duration_ should be of 2h. 2'. Lastly, The\r\n_Beginning_ did anticipate the _Ricciolan Tables_ by 5 _minuts_, the _End_\r\nby 23; and the _Middle_, almost by 11. In the mean time the Author notes,\r\nthat the _Rudolphin Tables_ come nearest to the Truth; and withal assures\r\nthe _Reader_ of the goodnesse of the _Instruments_ employed in his\r\n_Observations_, and of the singular care, he, together with his skilful\r\nAssistants, took in making them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Inquiries and Directions concerning _Tides_, proposed by Dr.\r\n_Wallis_, for the proving, or disproving of his lately publish't\r\n_Discourse_ concerning them_.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisitive Dr. _Wallis_, having in his lately printed _Hypothesis_ of\r\nTides intimated, that he had reason to believe, that the _Annual\r\nSpring-tides_ happen to be rather about the beginnings of _Febr._ and\r\n_Nov._ than the two _Æquinoxes_, doth in a late Letter to the _Publisher_,\r\nwritten from _Oxford_ in _Aug._ last, desire, that some understanding\r\nPersons at _London_, or _Greenwich_, but rather nearer the Sea, or upon the\r\nSea-shore, would make _particular_ Observation of all the _Spring-Tides_\r\n(_New-Moon_ and _Full-Moon_) between this and the End of _November_; and\r\ntake account of the _Hour_, and of the _Perpendicular height_: that we may\r\nsee, whether those in _September_, or those of _November_ be highest: And\r\nit were not amiss, the Low waters were observed too. Which may be easily\r\ndone by a mark made upon any standing Post in the Water, by any {298}\r\nWater-man, or other understanding Person, who dwells by the Water-side.\r\n\r\nIt would also deserve (thinks he) to be inquired into, whether, when the\r\nTides be highest, the Ebbs be ever lowest, & _contra_; (which is generally\r\naffirmed, and almost put out of question) or rather (which sutes best with\r\nthis _Hypothesis_) whether, when the Tides are highest, both in the\r\n_Annual_ and _Menstrual_ Periods, the Low waters be not also highest; and\r\nat Neap Tides, the Ebbes also very low.\r\n\r\nHe adds, that he should expect, that the Spring Tides now coming, and those\r\nat the beginning of _September_, should not be so high, as those at the\r\n_middle_ of _September_; and then lower again at the _beginning_ of\r\n_October_, and after that, higher at the _middle_ of _October_, and higher\r\nyet about the _beginning_ of _November_ (at the usual times of\r\n_Spring-tides_ after the _New_ and _Full_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Considerations and Enquiries concerning _Tides_, by Sir _Robert Moray_;\r\nlikewise for a further search into Dr. _Wallis's_ newly publish't\r\n_Hypothesis_._\r\n\r\nIn regard that the High and Low waters are observed to increase, and\r\ndecrease regularly at several seasons, according to the Moons age, so as,\r\nabout the _New_ and _Full Moon_, or within two or three daies after, in the\r\nWestern parts of _Europe_, the _Tides_ are at the _highest_, and about the\r\n_Quarter-Moons_, at the _lowest_, (the former call'd _Spring-tides_, the\r\nother _Neap-tides_;) and that according to the height and excesses of the\r\n_Tides_, the _Ebbes_ in opposition are answerable to them, the heighest\r\nTide having the lowest Ebbe, and the lowest Ebbe, the highest Tide; the\r\nTides from the _Quarter_ to the _highest Spring-tide_ increasing in a\r\ncertain proportion; and from the _Spring tide_ to the _Quarter-tide_\r\ndecreasing in like proportion, as is supposed: And also the _Ebbes_ rising\r\nand falling constantly after the same manner: It is wished, that it may be\r\ninquired, in what proportion these Increases and Decreases, Risings and\r\nFallings happen to be in regard of one another?\r\n\r\nAnd 'tis supposed, upon some Observations, made in fit places, by the\r\nabove-mentioned Gentleman, though, (as himself acknowledges) not thoroughly\r\nand exactly performed, that the Increase of the Tides is made in the\r\n_Proportion_ of _Sines_; the first Increase exceeding the lowest in a small\r\nproportion; the next in a greater; the third greater than that; and so on\r\nto the mid-most, whereof the excess is greatest, diminishing again from\r\nthat, to the highest Spring-Tide; so as the proportions, before and after\r\nthe _Middle_, do greatly answer one another, or seem to do so. And\r\nlikewise, from the _highest Spring-tide_, to the _lowest Neap-tide_, the\r\n_Decreases_ seem to keep the like proportions; the _Ebbes_ rising and\r\nfalling in like manner and in like proportions. All which is supposed to\r\nfall out, when no Wind or other Accident causes an alteration. {299}\r\n\r\nAnd whereas 'tis observed, that upon the main Sea-shore the Current of the\r\nEbbings and Flowings is sometimes swifter, and sometimes slacker, than at\r\nothers, so as in the beginning of the Floud the Tide moves faster but in a\r\nsmall degree, increasing its swiftness constantly till towards the _Middle_\r\nof the Floud; and then decreasing in velocity again from the _Middle_ till\r\nto the top of the High water; it is supposed, that in Equal spaces of Time,\r\nthe Increase and Decrease of velocity, and consequently the degrees of the\r\nRisings and Fallings of the same, in Equal spaces of time, are performed\r\naccording to the _Proportion_ of _Sines_.\r\n\r\nBut 'tis withall conceived, that the said _Proportion_ cannot hold\r\n_exactly_ and _precisely_, in regard of the _Inequalities_, that fall out\r\nin the _Periods_ of the _Tides_, which are commonly observed and believed\r\nto follow certain _Positions_ of the _Moon_ in regard of the _Equinox_,\r\nwhich are known not to keep a _precise_ and _constant_ Course: so that,\r\nthere not intervening equal portions of Time between one New Moon and\r\nanother, the Moons return to the same _Meridian_, cannot be alwaies\r\nperform'd in the same Time; and consequently there must be a like Variation\r\nof the Tides in the Velocity, and in the Risings and Fallings of the Tides,\r\nas to equal spaces of time. And the Tides from New-moon to New-moon being\r\nnot alwaies the same in number, as sometimes but 57, sometimes 58, and\r\nsometimes 59, (without any certain order of succession) is another evidence\r\nof the difficulty of reducing this to any great exactness. Yet, because\r\n'tis worth while, to learn as much of it, as may be, the _Proposer_ and\r\nmany others do desire, That Observations be constantly made of all these\r\nParticulars for some Months, and, if it may be, years together. And because\r\nsuch Observations will be the more easily and exactly made, where the Tides\r\nrise highest, it is presumed, that a fit _Apparatus_ being made for the\r\npurpose, they may be made about _Bristol_ or _Cheap-stow_, best of any\r\nplaces in _England_, because the Tides are said thereabout to rise to ten\r\nor twelve fathoms; as upon the coast of _Britanny_ in _France_, they do to\r\nthirteen and fourteen.\r\n\r\nIn order to which, this following _Apparatus_ is proposed to be made use\r\nof. In some convenient place upon a Wall, Rock, or Bridge, &c. let there be\r\nan _Observatory_ standing, as neer as may be to the brink of the Sea, or\r\nupon some wall; and if it cannot be well placed just where the Low water\r\nis, there may be a Channel cut from the Low water to the bottom of the\r\nWall, Rock, &c. The Observatory is to be raised above the High water 18. or\r\n20. foot; and a Pump, of any reasonable dimension, placed perpendicularly\r\nby the Wall, reaching above the High water as high as conveniently may be.\r\nUpon the top of the Pump a Pulley is to be fastned, for letting down into\r\nthe Pump a piece of floating wood, which, as the water comes in, may rise\r\nand fall with it. And because the rising and falling of the water amounts\r\nto 60. or 70. foot, the Counterpoise of the weight, that goes into the\r\nPump, is to hang upon as many Pulleys, as may serve to make it rise & fall\r\nwithin the space, by which the height of the Pump exceeds the height of the\r\nWater. And because by {300} this means the Counterpoise will rise and fall\r\nslower; and consequently by less proportions, than the weight it self, the\r\nfirst Pulley may have upon it a Wheele or two, to turn _Indexes_ at any\r\nproportion required, so as to give the minute parts of the motion, and\r\ndegrees of risings and fallings. All which is to be observed by\r\n_Pendulum-watches_, that have _Minutes_ and _Seconds_, with _Checks_,\r\naccording to Mr. _Hugens's_ way.\r\n\r\nAnd because if the Hole, by which the water is let into the Pump, be as\r\nlarge as the Bore of the Pump it self, the weight that is raised by the\r\nwater, will rise and fall with an Undulalation, according to the inequality\r\nof the Sea's Surface, 'twill therefore be fit, that the Hole, by which the\r\nwater enters, be less than half as bigg as the Bore of the Pump; any\r\ninconvenience that may follow thereupon, as to the Periods and Stations of\r\nthe Floud and Ebb, not being considerable.\r\n\r\nAnd to the end, that it may appear the better; what are the _particular_\r\nObservations, desired to be made, near _Bristol_ or _Cheap-stow_ bridg, it\r\nwas thought not amiss, to set them down distinctly by themselves.\r\n\r\n1. The degrees of the Rising and Falling of the water every quarter of an\r\nhour (or as often as conveniently may be) from the Periods of the Tides and\r\nEbbs; to be observed night and day, for 2 or 3 months.\r\n\r\n2. The degrees of the velocity of the Motion of the Water every quarter of\r\nan hour for some whole Tides together; to be observed by a second\r\n_Pendul_-watch: and a logg fastened to a line of some 50 fathoms, wound\r\nabout a wheel.\r\n\r\n3. The exact measures of the Heights of every utmost High-water and\r\nLow-water, from one Spring-tide to another, for some Months or rather\r\nYears.\r\n\r\n4. The exact Heights of Spring-tides and Spring-Ebbs for some Years\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n5. The Position of the Wind at every observation of the Tides; and the\r\ntimes of its Changes; and the degrees of its Strength.\r\n\r\n6. The State of the Weather, as to Rain, Hail, Mist, Haziness, &c, and the\r\ntimes of its Changes.\r\n\r\n7. At the times of observation of the Tides, the height of the\r\n_Thermometer_; the height of the _Baroscope_; the height of the\r\n_Hygroscope_; the Age of the Moon, and her _Azimuths_; and her place in all\r\nrespects; And lastly the _Sun's_ place; all these to _minutes_.\r\n\r\nAnd it would be convenient, to keep _Journal Tables_, for all these\r\nObservations, each answering to its day of the Month.\r\n\r\nFor the _Apparatus_ of all these observations, there will be particularly\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nA good _Pendulum_-watch.\r\n\r\nA _Vane_ shewing _Azimuths_ to minute parts.\r\n\r\nAn _Intrument_ to measure the Strength of the Winde.\r\n\r\nA large and good _needle_ shewing _Azimuths_ to degrees. {301}\r\n\r\n_Thermometers_, _Barometers_, _Hygroscopes_.\r\n\r\nThese Observations being thought very considerable as well as curious, 'tis\r\nhoped, that those who have conveniency, will give encouragement and\r\nassistance for the making of them; and withall oblige the publick by\r\nimparting, what they shall have observed of this kind: The _Publisher_\r\nintending, that when ever such observations shall be communicated to him,\r\nhe will give notice of it to the _publick_, and take care of the\r\nimprovement thereof to the best use and advantage. A _Pattern_ of the\r\n_Table_, proposed to be made for observing the _Tides_, is intended to be\r\npublished the next opportunity, God permitting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of Several Books lately published_\r\n\r\nI. _Johannis Hevelii DESCRIPTIO COMETÆ, Anno Æræ Christianæ MDCLXV. exorti;\r\nunà cum MANTISSA Prodromi Cometici, Observationes omnes prioris COMETÆ\r\nMDCLIV, ex iisque genuinum motum accuratè deductum, cum Notis &\r\nAnimadversionibus, exhibens._\r\n\r\nThis Book (as the Title it self intimates) undertakes two things. _First_,\r\nTo give an Account of the _Second_ of the two late Comets, which appeared,\r\nwhen the _other_ was scarce extinct; Concerning which, the Author doth,\r\nfrom the Observations made by himself with a _Sextant_ of 6 foot, and\r\ndivided into _minutes_ and _seconds_, assign _both_ its true place (as well\r\nin respect of the _Ecliptick_ as the _Æquator_) _and_ its proper motion;\r\nAdding a fair Delineation of its Course, together with the genuine\r\nRepresentations of its _Head_ and _Train_, in each day of its apparition;\r\nand subjoyning a General Description and Discourse of some of the more\r\nnotable _Phenomena_ thereof. It was first seen at _Dantzick_ by the\r\nWatchmen, the 5th of _April_ st. n. 1665. and then observed by the _Author_\r\nfrom _April_ 6, about 1½ of the Clock in the morning, till _April_ 20 at 3.\r\nin the morning. During which time, it went with a reasonable velocity;\r\nmaking 46 deg. in its Orb, _according to the Order of the Signs_, moving\r\nfrom the _Breast_ of _Pegasus_, towards the _Head_ of _Andromeda_, and the\r\n_Left Horn_ of _Aries_; having, as 'tis presumed, taken its rise from above\r\n_Sagittary_, and run through the _Breast_ of _Antinous_, under _Aquila_ and\r\nthe _Dolphin_, to the said _Pegasus_; and so on, as is already expressed.\r\n\r\nThe _Head_ of it is in the Book described of a Colour like that of\r\n_Jupiter_, all along much brighter than that of the former Comet, though of\r\na somewhat less magnitude; having in its middle onely _one_ round, but very\r\nbright and big _Kernel_ or Speck, resplendent like Gold, and encompassed\r\nwith another more dilute and seemingly uniform matter: its _Tail_ being at\r\nfirst, about 17. deg. and afterwards 20. and sometimes 25 deg. long, and\r\ndivaricated towards the End.\r\n\r\n_Next_, it is observed, that though this Star did afterwards slacken its\r\npace, yet it retained the vividness of its Colour, both of the _Head_ and\r\n_Train_; the _Head_ especially, keeping at the time as well of the last\r\nobservations, as of the {302} first, the brightness of its single _kernel_,\r\nthough the environing more dilute matter were then almost all lost; it\r\nbeing, according to the Author, more and more attenuated, and grown narrow,\r\nthe nearer the Star approached to the Sun.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, 'tis noted, That this _Comet_ did very much digress from the\r\n_Hypothesis_, delivered by _M. Auzout_, in regard that, whereas according\r\nto that _Hypothesis_, this Star should not arrive to the _Ecliptick_ till\r\nafter the space of 3 months, it arrived there the 28 of _April_. And then,\r\nthat its first Conjunction with the Sun hapned between the 19 and 20 of\r\n_April_, and the second, the last of _April_, not (as _M. Auzout_, would\r\nhave it) the 15 of _May_. So that he concludes, that this Comet never came\r\ndown to the _Pleiads_ and the _Eye of Taurus_, as the Hypothesis of _M.\r\nAuzout_ requires, but that from _April_ 20. it did immediately take its\r\ncourse towards the Ecliptick, deflecting every day more and more from the\r\n_Section_ of a _Great Circle_, to the _Lucida_ of _Aries_, arriving at the\r\n_Ecliptick_ the last of _April_, about the 8th or 10th deg. of _Taurus_;\r\nnot in _July_ about the 8th of _Gemini_, and the _Eye of Taurus_.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, He intimates, that if this Comet had appeared some weeks\r\nsooner, it would have confronted the former Comet, being yet in its vigour\r\nand of a conspicuous bigness, in the same place, where that was, viz. the\r\n_Head of Aries_.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, He observes, that this Star in progress of time became\r\n_Retrograde_, whence it came to pass, that in the Months of _June_ and\r\n_July_ it did not appear again before the Rising of the Sun, though the Sun\r\nleft it far behind: whereas, if it had proceeded toward the _Eye of\r\nTaurus_, it would have appeared again in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly_, He maintains, that this Comet was not the same with the former;\r\nwhich he thinks may be demonstrated, onely by a due Delineation of both\r\ntheir Course upon the _Globe_; where he saith it to be evident, that the\r\nformer could never come to the _Head_ of _Pegasus_, as moving already in\r\n_February_ in a streight Course about the _Head_ of _Aries_; Besides, that\r\nthe _former_ went in the very beginning in a _Retrograde_ motion; but\r\n_this_ perpetually in a direct one: _that_, about the end, very slow, its\r\nHead lessning and growing dark; _this_ swift enough, with its head\r\nconspicuous and bright. To which he adds, that the whole Course of the\r\nformer was made under a quite different _Angle_ of the _Orbite_ and\r\n_Ecliptick_, and a different Motion of the _Nodes_ from the latter: As also\r\nthat their _Faces_ differed very much from one another; the _first_\r\nexhibiting all along a matter, which as to its density and rarity, altered\r\nfrom day to day exceedingly, whereas the _second_ retained (to the Authors\r\nadmiration, who affirms, never to have observed the like) all the time he\r\nsaw it, one and the same round, dense and bright Speck or Kernel.\r\n\r\nAll which he concludes 1, With an Intimation of his sense concerning two\r\nother Comets, pretended to have been lately seen, _One_ at _Rome_, about\r\nthe {303} _Girdle of Andromeda_, in the Months of _February_ and _March_,\r\n1664. the other in _Germany_ in _Capricorne_, about _Saturne_ in the head\r\nof _Sagittary_, during the Months of _September_ and _October_, 1665. 2ly,\r\nWith an Advertisement of what he has done in that important Work for the\r\nAdvancement of _Astronomy_, the due _Restitution of the Fixt Stars, vid._\r\nThat he has almost finish't it; himself alone, without trusting to any\r\nother mans labour, that was not directed by him.\r\n\r\nThe _Second_ Part of this Book (the _Mantissa_ to the _Prodromus\r\nCometicus_) endeavours to justifie the Authors Observations touching the\r\nformer Comet, excepted against by M. _Auzout_, in several particulars; as\r\n1. That it had not pass'd to the _First_, but _Second_ Star in _Aries_, and\r\nhad mov'd in quite another Line, than He had described. 2. That its _proper\r\nmotion_ about the end of _January_ and the beginning of _February_, 1665.\r\nhad not been rightly assigned. 3. That the _Bignesse_ of its _Diameter_ had\r\nnot been truly delivered; Nor 4. The _Faces_ of its _Head_ in due manner\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nTo all which the Author endeavors to answer: 1. By delivering all his\r\nObservations of that Comet, thereby to shew, what care and diligence he had\r\nused, _particularly_ to make out, how great its _Diurnal motion_ had been;\r\nin what proportion, and how far, it decreased, and where and in what degree\r\nit increased again: Which being, as he conceives, duly and exactly deduced,\r\nand demonstrated, he esteems it afterwards to be easie for every one,\r\nversed in these matters, certainly to collect and to judge, what way the\r\nComet, after it became invisible to the naked Eye, and could be no longer\r\nobserved with _Sextants_ and _Quadrants_, had taken, and what Line it had\r\ndescribed. 2, By subjecting all those Observations, with great diligence\r\nand labour, to a rigid _Calculus_, thereby to obtain, for every day, the\r\n_Longitudes_, _Latitudes_, _Right Ascensions, Declinations_, _Proper\r\nmotion_, _Angle_ of the _Ecliptick_ and the _Æquator_, and the _Nodes_ of\r\nthat Comet; for the construction of an _Ephemerides_ of its whole Motion.\r\nFrom all which he pretends to prove, that he has not erred in his\r\nObservation of _February_ 18, nor been prepossest by any _Hypothesis_, nor\r\ndeluded by any _Fixt Star_, as M. _Auzout_ thinketh; but that near the\r\n_First Star_ of _Aries_ there _then_ appear'd a _Phænomenon_, most like to\r\nthat Comet, that was seen some dayes before, if compared with the\r\nObservations make thereof _Febr._ 12, 13, 14. Though he will not hitherto\r\npositively determine, whether that _Phænomenon_, which appear'd to him\r\n_February_ 18. was {304} indeed that very Comet, which he saw with his\r\nnaked Eye, and observed with his Geometrical Instruments, the said 12, 13,\r\nand 14. dayes of _February_; or whether it was another, and whether he had\r\nlost that Comet, which moved towards the _Second Star_ in _Aries_: but\r\nleaves it to the Learned World, and particularly to the _Royal Society_,\r\nafter they shall have well examined and considered all his Observations,\r\nand the _Calculus_ raised therefrom, to judge of this, and the other\r\nparticulars in controversie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Isaacus Vossius de NILI et ALIORUM FLUMINUM ORIGINE_. It was _Numb._\r\n14. of these _Transactions_, that gave an account of the _Cause_ of the\r\n_Inundation of the Nile_, as it was rendred by Monsieur _de la Chambre_:\r\n_This_ is to give you another, not only of the _Inundation_, but also of\r\nthe _Origine_ of that, and of _other Rivers_, as it is delivered by\r\nMonsieur _Isaac Vossius_, who undertakes in this Book to shew;\r\n\r\n1. That those _Subterraneous Channels_, through which several\r\n_Philosophers_ teach, that the Sea discharges it self into the Rivers, are\r\nnot only imaginary, but useless, in regard 'tis impossible for the water to\r\nrise from the Subterraneous places up to the Mountains, where commonly the\r\nSources of Rivers are.\r\n\r\n2. He explicates, why, if a Pipe be put into a Bason full of Water, the\r\nwater is seen more raised in the Pipe, than in the Bason, and rises higher\r\naccording as the Pipe is narrower; On the contrary, if the same Pipe be put\r\ninto a Bason full of Quicksilver, the Quicksilver stayes lower in the Pipe,\r\nthan in the Bason. The reason, which he renders hereof, is, That as the\r\nWater sticks easily to all it touches, it is sustain'd by the sides of the\r\nnarrow Pipe wherein it is included: And indeed, if the Pipe be quite drawn\r\nout of the Water, the Water doth not all fall out, but so much of it\r\nremains, as the sides of the Pipe could sustaine: Whence it is, that the\r\nWater which is kept up by the Walls of the Tube, weighing no longer upon\r\nthat which is in the Bason, is thrust upwards, and keeps it self raised\r\nabove its Levell; but the Quicksilver not adhering so easily, as Water, to\r\nBodies it touches, is not sustained by the sides of the Tube, and so mounts\r\nnot above its Levell, but rather descends below it, because the Pipe, which\r\nis streight, hinders the endeavor that is in the _Mercury_ to rise to its\r\nLevel. He adds, that this Observation makes nothing for the Explication of\r\nthe _Origine of Rivers_; because, though it be true, that the Water {305}\r\nby this means rises above its Levell, yet it does never run out at the top\r\nof the Pipe. Having said this, he answers to the other Arguments, commonly\r\nalledged to maintain this Opinion.\r\n\r\n3. He pretends, that all Rivers proceed from a _Colluvies_ or _Rendevous_\r\nof Rain-waters, and that, as the Water, that falls upon _Hills_, gathers\r\nmore easily together, than that which falls in _Plaines_, therefore it is,\r\nthat Rivers ordinarily take their Source from _Hills_. Thence also comes it\r\n(saies he) that there are more _Rivers_, than _Torrents_, in the _Temperate\r\nZones_; and, on the contrary, more _Torrents_, than _Rivers_, in the\r\n_Torrid Zone_: For, as in hot Climats the Mountains are far higher, the\r\nWater, that descends from them with impetuosity, runs away in a little\r\nwhile, and formes such Collections of Water, as soon dry up, but in cold\r\nClimats, the Waters do not run away but slowly, and are renew'd and\r\nrecruited by Rain, before they are quite dryed up; because the Hills are\r\nthere lower, and so the Bed of Rivers hath lesse declivity.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discoursed of _Rivers_ in _General_, he treats of the _Nile_ in\r\n_particular_; and there\r\n\r\n1. Observes, That the Order of the Seasons of the Year is quite inverted\r\nunder the _Torrid Zone_. For, whereas it should be then Summer, when the\r\nSun is near; and Winter, when the Sun is farther off: Under the _Torrid\r\nZone_ 'tis never lesse hot, than when the Sun is nearest; nor more hot,\r\nthan when the Sun is farthest off: So that to the people that live between\r\nthe _Æquinoctial_ and the _Tropicks_, Summer begins about _Christmass_, and\r\ntheir Winter, about St. _Johns_ day. The reason whereof is, (_saith he_)\r\nthat when the Sun is directly over their Heads, it raises abundance of\r\nvapors, and draws them so high, that they are presently converted into\r\nWater by the coldnesse of the Air; whence it comes to passe, that then it\r\nrains continually, which does refresh the Air; but when the Sun is farther\r\noff, there falls no more rain, and so the Heat becomes insupportable.\r\n\r\n2. He proves by many recent Relations, that the _Sources_ of the _Nile_ are\r\non this side of the _Æquinoctial_ in _Æthiopia_, of which he gives a very\r\naccurate _Mappe_, correcting many faults which _Geographers_ are wont to\r\ncommit in the Description of the Kingdom of the _Abyssins_, which they\r\nbelieve to be much greater than indeed it is. {306}\r\n\r\n3. This supposed, he easily gives an account, why the _Nile_ yearly\r\noverflows about the end of _June_: For, as at that time there falls much\r\nrain in _Æthiopia_, it must needs be, that the _Nile_, whose source is in\r\nthat Country, should then overflow, when those rains begin, and subside,\r\nwhen they cease.\r\n\r\nThere are besides, in this Book, two other _Tracts_. In the _first_, M.\r\n_Vossins_ endeavours to maintain the Doctrine, he had deliver'd in his Book\r\n_De Lumine_, and to shew, that the _Soul_ of Animals is nothing but _Fire_,\r\nthat there are no invisible Atoms; nor so much as any Pores, even in the\r\nSkin of man. Here he treats also of _Refractions_, and alledges the\r\nExamples of several persons, who have then seen the Sun by the means of\r\nRefraction, when really He was under the _Horizon_.\r\n\r\nIn the _second_, He discourses of some points of the _Mechanicks_; and\r\nrelates among other things, that the _Arrows_ and _battering Rams (Aries)_\r\nof the Antients did as much execution, as our _Muskets_ and _Canons_; and\r\nthen, that the Vehemence of the percussion depends as much upon the Length\r\nof the percutient Body, as upon the velocity of the Motion. He adds, that\r\nthe Length of a Canon ought not to exceed 13 foot, and that a greater\r\nlength is not onely useless, but hinders also the effect of the Gun, not\r\nbecause the Bullet is thrown out of the Gun, before all the powder is fired\r\n(as some believe;) but because the Bullet is then beaten back into the Gun\r\nby the Air, re-entring into it with impetuosity, when the flame is extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _LE DISCERNEMENT DU CORPS ET DE L'AME_, par M. _de Cordemoy_.\r\n\r\nThis _French_ Treatise (but very lately come to the _Publisher's_ hands)\r\nexamines the different Operations of the Soul and Body, and the Secret of\r\ntheir Union, pretending to discover to every one, what he is, and what is\r\ntransacting within him. It consists of six Discourses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _It sounds hard, To say, An _extended_ substance is\r\n_indivisible_._]\r\n\r\n1. In the _first_, the Author examines the Notions, we have in _general_ of\r\n_Bodies_ and _Matter_; of _Quantity_; of _Qualities_; of _Place_; of\r\n_Rest_; of _Motion_; of _Vacuity_; of _Forms_: to shew what is to be\r\nunderstood by these Terms, which cause all the perplexity that is in the\r\nordinary _Physicks_. He begins with taking notice, that hitherto\r\n_Philosophers_ have had no _distinct_ notions of _Bodies_ and _Matter_,\r\nfrom the want whereof he conceives, that almost all the Errors in Common\r\n_Physiology_ have {307} sprung. To rectify which, he defines _Bodies_ to be\r\n* _Extended Substances_, and _Matter_ an _Aggregate of Bodies_. Whence he\r\ninferrs, that _Bodies_ are Indivisible and _Matter_ divisible; a _Body_\r\nbeing nothing but _one_ and the _same_ substance, whose different\r\nextremities are inseparable, because they are the extremities of one and\r\nthe same Extension, and, in a word, of one and the same Substance; but\r\n_Matter_ being nothing but an Association or Collection of Bodies, 'tis\r\nevident, (_saith he_) it must be divisible. This doctrine he so much\r\ninsists upon, that he conceives, Nature cannot subsist, if a Body in the\r\nsence he takes it, be divisible; and that _Motion_ and _Rest_ cannot be\r\nexplicated without it. As for _Quantity_, he makes that to be nothing but\r\nMore or Less Bodies; not allowing, that each Body should be a Quantity,\r\nthough it be a part of Quantity; no more than an _Unite_ is a Number,\r\nthough it make part of a Number: so that _Quantity_ and _Extension_ are two\r\ndistinct things with him, the _first_ belonging properly to _Matter_, the\r\nlast to a _Body_. Touching _Vacuity_, he conceives, that the Bodies, which\r\ncompose a mass, are not every where so near one another, as not to leave\r\nsome interval in several places. Neither does he think it necessary, that\r\nthose intervals should be fill'd up; nor unconceivable, that there should\r\nbe no Body between two Bodies; which touch not one another. And when 'tis\r\nsaid, that those intervals cannot be conceived without Extension, and that\r\nconsequently there are Bodies that replenish them, he frankly pronounces\r\nthat not to be true; and affirms, that though it may be said, that between\r\ntwo Bodies, which touch not one another, other Bodies may be placed of so\r\nor so many feet, &c: yet ought it not to be inferred, that therefore they\r\n_are_ there, but onely, that they are thus placed, that there _may_ be put\r\nbetween them so many Bodies, as joyned together would compose an Extension\r\nof so many feet. So that one conceives onely, that Bodies _may_ be placed\r\nthere, but not that they _are_ there: and as we can have an _Idea_ of many\r\nBodies, though none of them be in being; so we can conceive, that some\r\nBodies _may_ be put between others, where really there are none. And when\r\n'tis alledged, that if all the Bodies, that fill a vessel full, were\r\ndestroyed, the sides of the vessel would be closed together; He professes,\r\nhe understands not that ratiocination, nor can conceive, what one Body does\r\nto the subsistence of another, more than to sustain themselves mutually,\r\nwhen they are thrust by the neighbouring ones: and therefore sees not, why\r\nthe sides of the vessel should close, if nothing did thrust them together;\r\nbut understands clearly, that two Bodies may well subsist so far from one\r\nanother, that one might place a great many Bodies between them, or none at\r\nall, and yet they neither approach to, not recoil from one another. {308}\r\n\r\n2. In the _Second_, he examines the _Changes_, which he knows in Matter,\r\nand makes it his business to explicate all those that respect _Quantity_,\r\n_Qualities_ and _Forms_, by _Local Motion_, esteeming that needs no other.\r\n\r\n3. In the _third_, he explains the Motion of _Artificial_ Engins, and that\r\nof _Natural_ ones, by one and the same Cause; endeavouring among other\r\nthings to shew, that the Body of an Animal is moved after the same manner\r\nwith a Watch. That cause of motion he makes the _Materia Subtilis_; and the\r\nfiner or subtiler that is, the better and fitter he conceives it to be to\r\npreserve Motion.\r\n\r\n4. In the _Fourth_, he teaches, that though Experience seems to evince,\r\nthat the Soul moves the Body, and that one Body moves an other; yet there\r\nis nothing but God, that can produce any notion in the World, and all other\r\nAgents, which we believe to be the _Cause_ of this or that Motion, are no\r\nmore but the _Occasion_ thereof. In doing this, he advances certain\r\n_Axioms_, and Conclusions, which are in short,\r\n\r\na. The _Axioms_: That no substance has that of it self, which it can loose,\r\nwithout ceasing to be, what it is: That every body may loose of its motion,\r\ntill it have no more left, without ceasing to be a Body: That we cannot\r\nconceive but two sorts of substances, _vid._ a _Spirit_ (or _That which\r\nthinketh_) and a _Body_, wherefore they must be considered as the Causes of\r\nall, that happens, and what cannot proceed from the one, must necessarily\r\nbe adscribed to the other: That to _Move_, or to cause motion, is an\r\nAction: That an Action cannot be continued but by the Agent, who began it.\r\n\r\nb. The _Conclusions_: That no _Body_ hath Motion of it self: That the First\r\nMover of Bodies not a Body: That it cannot be but a _Spirit_, that is the\r\nFirst Mover: That it cannot be but the same Spirit, who has begun to move\r\nBodies, that continues to move.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fifth_, He treats of the Union of the Body and Soul, and the\r\nmanner, how they act one upon the other; and esteems it not more difficult\r\nto conceive the Action of Spirits upon Bodies, and of Bodies upon Spirits,\r\nthan to conceive the Action of Bodies upon Bodies: the cause of the great\r\ndifficulty in understanding the two former, arising (according to him) from\r\nthence, that we will conceive the one by the other, not considering, that\r\nevery thing acting according to its own nature, we shall never know the\r\naction of one Agent, if we will examine it by the notions we have of\r\nanother, that is of a quite differing nature. Here he notes, that the\r\nAction of Bodies upon Bodies is not {309} more known to us; than that of\r\nSpirits upon Bodies, or of Bodies upon Spirits; and yet most men admire\r\nnothing but _this_, believing to know the _other_; whereas he Judges, that\r\nall things being well examin'd, the Action of Bodies upon Bodies is no more\r\nconceivable, than that of Spirits upon Bodies. Mean while the opinion of\r\nthe Authour touching this subject, is, That the union of Soul and Body\r\nconsists onely in this, that certain motions of the Body are followed by\r\ncertain _Cogitations_ of the Soul, and, on the contrary, that certain\r\nThoughts of the Soul are follow'd by certain _Motions_ of the Body. And,\r\nhaving supposed, that Bodies are said to act upon one another, when they\r\ncause some change suitable to Extension; and Spirits to act upon one\r\nanother, when they cause some change suitable to a Thought; he infers, that\r\nwhen a Body acts upon a Spirit, that cannot be by causing any change of\r\nmotion, of figure, or parts, as having none of all these; nor when a Spirit\r\nacts upon a Body, that cannot be by producing any change of Thought, as\r\nhaving none: But, when this Body, or its motion, or figure, or other thing,\r\ndepending upon its nature, can be perceived by a Spirit, so as, upon that\r\noccasion, this Spirit has thoughts, it had not before, it may be said, that\r\nthe Body has acted upon this Spirit, for as much as it has caused all the\r\nchange in it, whereof it was capable according to its nature.\r\n\r\nIn the _Sixth_, After he hath shew'd, what is to be understood by what we\r\ncall _Soul_, and by what we call _Body_, he labours to make it out, that we\r\nare much more assured of the Existence of the Soul, than of that of the\r\nBody, which he conceives he can prove from hence, that we cannot doubt,\r\nthat we think, because even doubting is thinking; but one may doubt,\r\nwhether one has a body, for several reasons, which he alledges, and thinks\r\nso cogent, that he concludes, it is not evident to him by the light of\r\nreason, that he has a Body. But supposing, there be Bodies, he examines,\r\nwhat are the Operations, that belong to the Soul, and what those, that\r\nbelong to the Body; and lastly, what those, that result from the Union of\r\nboth: And then explains, how all those operations are perform'd, and\r\nparticularly, _Sensation_; where he shews, that the Nerves, holding at one\r\nend to the Brain, whereof they are but Allongations, and being at the other\r\nend extended to the extremities of the Body; when an Object comes to touch\r\nthose exterior ends of the Nerves, the interior ones in the Brain are\r\npresently shaken; and cause different sensations according to the\r\ndiversitie of Nerves, and the differing manner, in which they are shaken.\r\nAnd to shew, that 'tis this shaking, that causes Sensation, he notes, that\r\nif any thing shakes the interior parts of the Nerves, though the object be\r\nabsent, the Soul has presently the same {310} sensations, as it would have,\r\nif it were present. As, if one should knock on's head forcibly against a\r\nwall, the shaking, which the blow gives to the Brain, moving the interior\r\nextremities of the Nerve, which causes the sensation of Light, the Soul has\r\nthe same sensation, which it would have, if it saw a thousand Candles: On\r\nthe contrary, if the interior extremities of the nerves are not shaken,\r\nthough the object be present, it causes no sensation; whence it comes, that\r\nif a strong Ligature be made upon the middle of the Arm, and the hand be\r\nthen prickt, no pain is felt, because the shaking of the nerves that are\r\npricked, being stopped by the Ligature, cannot reach to the extremities of\r\nthe Nerves, that are within the Brain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advertisement._\r\n\r\nThe following _Errata_, left by the _Press_ in _Num._ 16, the _Reader_ is\r\ndesired thus to correct.\r\n\r\nPage 269. lin 27. read, _motion of B above the Center; G. is also_, with a\r\n_Semi-colon_ after the word _Center_. p. 274. l. 13, r. _it to do to the_.\r\np. 277. l. 24. r. _natural days_. p. 281. l. 16. r. _of his_. ib. l. 27. r.\r\n_a notion_. p. 293. l. 4. r. _enough without_. ib. l. 43. r. _to the Sine\r\nof_. p. 294. l. 1. r. _to the Sine of_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON_,\r\n\r\nPrinted for _John Martin_ and _James Alestry_, Printers to the Royal\r\nSociety. 1666.\r\n\r\n{311}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numb._ 18.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _October_ 22. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    __Patterns_ of the _Tables_ proposed to be made for _Observing of\r\n    Tides_; promised in the next foregoing _Transactions_.

Moray_._\r\n\r\nIn performance of what was promised in the last of these _Papers_ for\r\nObserving the _Tides_, here are subjoyned _Patterns_ of the _Tables_ there\r\nmentioned; _One_, for marking the _precise Time_ of the High waters and\r\nLow-waters during one Month; that is, between _New_ and _New_ Moon, or\r\n_Full_ and _Full_ Moon. The _other_, for marking the _Degrees_ of the\r\nRisings and Fallings of the Water in _Equal_ spaces of Time, and the\r\n_Velocity_ of its motion at _several_ heights: The _Degrees_ of _Heat_ and\r\n_Cold, &c._\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, assigned in the _first_, to the High waters and Lowest Ebbs,\r\nare taken out of Mr. _Wing_'s Almanack, for this present year 1666, as he\r\ncalculates them for the Month of _September_ for _London Bridge_. Only,\r\nwhereas he takes notice but of _one_ High-water for every day, _Here_ are\r\nset {312} down the Times of the other, and the two Ebbs intervening, by\r\nsubdividing the _Differences_, he assignes between two Tides, equally\r\namongst them. In all which, though there may be Errors, that is not to be\r\nconsidered, seeing the Dissein is to Correct and State the _Times_ of the\r\n_Tides exactly_ by _Experiments_, after this method. Mr. _Wing_ states the\r\nHigh waters to fall out at _London-Bridge_ constantly, when the Moon is 46.\r\ndeg. 30. min. to the _West-ward_ of the _Meridian_. For the Times, he marks\r\nfor them, are made up by adding every day 3. hours, 6 minutes, to those in\r\nhis _Table_ for knowing the Time of the Moons coming to the South.\r\n\r\nThe _First Table_ consists of _two_ Parts, and each part of _four Columns_.\r\nThe _first_ part marks the Tides and Ebbs from the day of the _New_-Moon to\r\nits _Full_: The _other_, from the _Full_ to the next _New_. The _first\r\nColumn_ in both parts hath the day of the Month and Week; _M._ standing\r\nevery where for _Morning_ and _A._ for _Afternoon_. The _third_ column hath\r\nthe _Character_ of the day of the Week prefixt to the Hour and Minute of\r\nthe High-water, and answering to the day of the Month. The _last_ Column\r\nhath the same for the time of Low-water, varying the _Character_ of the\r\nday, as often as the low-water falls out more early than the High-water. In\r\nthis _Example_ between the said _New_ Moons there falls out in all just 57.\r\nperiods of the Tide or Flowing water, and 58. of the Ebb or Low water;\r\nwhich numbers vary according to the Intervals of the Moons changes, but\r\nwith what constancy and exactness, is to be inquired after: Which whosoever\r\nundertakes to do, may keep such a _Table_, as is here proposed, in a Book\r\nby it self.\r\n\r\nThe _other_ Table doth in 9. _Columns_ comprehend the particular\r\nObservations of the _Degrees_ of the Rising and falling of the Tides, and\r\nthe other things specified at the Tops of them: The _first_ Column marking\r\nthe Hour and Minut common to all the several Observations. Each hour is\r\ndivided in 3. equal Parts, that number of Observations being only pitch't\r\nupon by way of _Example_: The numbers may else be varied at pleasure, when\r\nother more frequent Observations are thought fit to be made, or when they\r\nprove too frequent and laborious; though the most frequent are most\r\ndesirable, till competent information of all particulars be attained.\r\n\r\nThe _Rising_ of the Tide from Low-water to the highest pitcht of the full\r\nSea, is here supposed to be 60. foot: And the Degrees of its rising every\r\n20. Minuts, to be in the _Proportion_ of _Sines_, The whole time of Flowing\r\nsupposed to be 6. hours. But this _Example_ will serve for marking the\r\n_Spaces_ of the Increasing or Rising, as well as of the falling of the\r\nwater, in order to the investigation of their _Proportions_ to one another,\r\nwhen the _Duration_ of the Tide exceeds 6. hours by any number of _minuts_,\r\nas well as for just 6. hours; seeing they may be easily collected from any\r\nNumber of Observations; their precise Time and that of the Duration of the\r\nwaters Rising and Falling (that is, the just interval between the\r\nHigh-Water and Low-water) being known: This Calculation by _Sines_, being\r\nonly set down as a _Conjecture_, flowing from Observations of the Motion of\r\nthe water in its Rising and Falling, {313} which seems to observe this or\r\nsome such like Proportion; which is supposed still to hold in _all_ Tides,\r\nbe the _Duration_ what it will; the Increase still continuing\r\nproportionably till the very midle of the Hight and Duration, and\r\nDecreasing afterwards in the same manner: Which whether it be so indeed or\r\nnot, is that, which is desired to be known.\r\n\r\nThere is the like Proportion here supposed to be in the _different degrees_\r\nof the _Velocity_ of the Current of the Water after _Equal_ spaces of\r\nTimes, as in its Rising and Falling: And so it is markt in the _Third_\r\nColumn. But because the _true Velocity_ of the Current of the Water, raised\r\nabove the Levell 456/1000 of a foot, is unknown, it is by way of\r\nSupposition set at Ten feet in one Minute of an Hour, which being once\r\nstated, the rest distant from each other by the space of 20. Minutes of an\r\nHour, are set down according to the same _Proportions_ of _Sines_ before\r\nsuggested. It being supposed, that of the _Velocity_ of the Current of the\r\nTide, after it hath flowed 20 minuts of an hour, be such, as a Log of Wood\r\nplaced in the Water will move 10 foot in the space of one minute of time,\r\nat the middle of the Tide it will in the like space of Time move 114 f.\r\n276/1000, and so proportionably at other times: Which, howsoever these\r\nProportions shall be found by Experiments to fall out, may be not unworthy\r\nof the pains and charges requisite to acquire the knowledge of it. For,\r\nbesides the satisfaction it may afford upon other accounts, it may possibly\r\nbe of no small use to those, who need an exact reckoning of their Ships\r\nrunning, when the Velocity of the Current of the Tide may be necessary to\r\nbe known; lest through the defect of the knowledge of that, especially when\r\nit is reckoned less than indeed it is, the Ship be thrown in the night upon\r\nShores, Rocks or Sands, when they reckon themselves to be far from them.\r\n\r\nThe Numbers in the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. _Columns_ are set down at random,\r\nonly for _Examples_ sake; there being no difficulty in the apprehension of\r\nit, and imitating of it in setting down the true Hights and Variations of\r\nthe _Thermometer_, _Baroscope_, &c. The Use whereof is so vulgarly known,\r\nthat there needs no further Direction concerning them. But if any person\r\nwho would make these Experiments, do not know the fabrick or use of any of\r\nthe Instruments requisite for some of these Observations, nor where to have\r\nthem, he may address himself to Mr. _Shortgrave_, one of the _Operators_ of\r\nthe _Royal Society_, lodged in _Gresham Colledge_, from whom he will\r\nreceive full satisfaction about these things.\r\n\r\nBut the labour employed in the Observations of the Heat, Cold, &c. required\r\nto be taken notice of in order to the Ends proposed in the former _Tract_,\r\nand others that may be of no less delight than advantage, will be much\r\nretrenched, when Dr. _Christopher Wren_ puts in practice, what he some\r\nyears ago proposed to the _Royal Society_ concerning an _Engine_ with a\r\n_Clockwork_, which may perform these Observations in the last enumerate\r\n_Columns_, without being toucht or lookt after but once or twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe Tables themselves follow,\r\n\r\n{314}\r\n\r\n_A Perpendicular Line divided into _Signes_, supposed to be the _Periods_\r\nof the Risings and Fallings of the Tides, as is in the other Table\r\nrepresented._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  1666.

And if it be not, how much\r\nit differs?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _This last Clause containing difficult _Quaere_ and that may\r\nseem something odd, Mr. _Boyl_ thinks fit to note, That having recommended\r\nthis matter, among others, to a learned Physician, that was sailing into\r\n_America_, and furnished him with a small _Hydrostaticall_ Instrument, to\r\nobserve from time to time the Differences of Gravity he might meet with;\r\nThis account was returned him, That he found by the Glass, the Sea-water to\r\nincrease in weight, the nearer he came to the _Line_, till he arrived at a\r\ncertain Degree of _Latitude_; as he remembers, it was about the 30th; after\r\nwhich, the Water seemed to retain the same specifick gravity, till he came\r\nto the _Barbadoes_, or _Jamaica_._]\r\n\r\nWhat is the Gravity of Sea-waters in reference to Fresh Waters and to one\r\nanother: Whether it vary not in Summer and Winter, and on other Scores? And\r\nwhether in the same Season its Gravity proceed _only_ from the greater or\r\nlesser Proportion of Salt, that is in it, and not sometimes from other\r\nCauses? And what are the differing Gravities of the Sea-water, according to\r\nthe Climats. *\r\n\r\nWhat are the Odors, Colours and Tasts, observable in Sea-water?\r\n\r\nWhat is the depth of the sea in several places, and the Order of its\r\nincrease and Decrements?

(not to name the _Placenta\r\nUteri_, which seems to be _Parenchymous_ too;) and being very desirous to\r\nmake a _Scheme_ of the Vessels of any of these, what ever they were, I fixt\r\nupon; I found, notwithstanding all my care to preserve the Vessels, when I\r\nwas freeing them, as heedfully as I could, from the supposed _Parenchyma_,\r\nthat in every breach, I made, either with my fingers or otherwise, all my\r\nendeavors were destructive to my purpose: and that, upon examination of\r\nthose bits, much of which is called _Parenchyma_, I met in them more\r\nVessels, than I had preserved in the parts whence they came: And though the\r\nportion were never so small, yet my bare eye could make this discovery;\r\nmuch more could I, when assisted by a _Microscope_, perceive, I had\r\ndestroyed more Vessels than preserved, in despite of the exactest care, I\r\nwas capable to use. And being not a little concern'd, that I should\r\nundertake to preserve the Vessels by such a Cause, as I saw plainly to be\r\ntheir definition (were the part never so big, or never so small) I was both\r\nconfounded and tired. For I saw (and so must any, that will attempt this\r\nwork) in my endeavouring to preserve one Vessel of a traceable magnitude, I\r\nspoiled an infinite number of others less discernable, which were as truly\r\nVessels, as the other, differing only in size and figure (as to\r\nappearance.) Then reviewing what mischief I had done in every place, quite\r\nthrough the whole Tract of my Fingers, Knife, &c. I begin to think with my\r\nself, That it was not impossible for these parts to consist wholly of\r\nVessels curiously wrought and interwoven (probably for more Uses, than is\r\nyet known;) And the {317} consideration, which came into my mind, of a\r\npiece of fine Cloth (which consists of so many several minute Hairs, call'd\r\n_Wool_) was no discouragement to this opinion. Yet I durst not be\r\npresumptuous as to indulge my self too much in it; much less to venter\r\npresently to speak of such a thing, which seem'd to contradict so many\r\nLearned Men's belief. But being restless, till I might receive more\r\nsatisfaction in the thing, I iterated experiments over and over; some of\r\nwhich prov'd so successful to my apprehension, that I was encouraged in the\r\nyear 1663. and 1664 to discourse of it to several very worthy Persons, as\r\nMr. _Boyl_, Sir _William Petty_, Dr. _Williams_, Dr. _Lenthal_, Dr. _Jaspar\r\nNeedham_, Dr. _Samson_, (who afterwards sent me a Letter from _France_,\r\nintimating the acquaintance he had made with the learned _Steno_, who hath\r\nsince published something of the same Discovery) Mr. _Daniel Cox_, and Dr.\r\n_Samuel Parker_, &c, who doubtless cannot but remember, that then I related\r\nto them, I found much cause to believe, that that substance commonly called\r\n_Parenchyma_, was in most, if not in all its _Parenchymous_ parts, full of\r\nVessels; however it had been imagin'd by all, I could ever meet with, to\r\nconsist in great part of a substance, in many places void of Vessels,\r\ndesigned for such uses, as are above mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgainst which I have now further to alledge, 1. That I observe in a piece\r\nof _Musculous_ flesh (so call'd) either raw, rosted, or boiled, &c. that if\r\nI so far extend it as to make it to be seen through, I can (assisting my\r\nEye) perceive it full of Vessels placed as thick as is possible to be\r\nimagin'd, (the fat if there be any, being first removed) there appearing\r\nthen nothing but vessels, yet so as with a _Microscope_ may be seen\r\nthrough, when they are extended. 2. That, if any one, as he is at dinner,\r\ntake a piece of flesh, and begin either at the head or tail of a _Muscle_,\r\nhe may divide it _in infinitum_ all along from head to tail, without\r\nbreaking any thing of that, called Flesh, only these transverse _Fibres_,\r\nthat seem to stitch them together, and (as I am apt to think) pass through\r\nthe very Bodies of the smallest of them, and quite through the whole Muscle\r\nup the Cutaneous porosities; so that there is not one of these small\r\n_ducts_, that run _per longitudinem_, but 'tis furnisht with a sufficient\r\nnumber of outlets, when need requires, though too minute to suffer any\r\n_alimentary_ juice to pass transversly (in a living Body) or any other\r\nliquor, when the Body is dead and cold. But to wave their use at present,\r\nand to return to what I was saying. Compress between the fingers this bit\r\nof flesh, and you shall find the Juice, especially if the Meat be Hot, to\r\ngo before your fingers toward either end you please; but if you compress\r\nboth ends, you shall see it swell into the middle; and again, if you press\r\nthe middle, it will run out at both ends. But further, suppose a piece of\r\nflesh, called _Parenchyma_, as big, or as little as you please, in any part\r\nof the Body, and let me prick it with a Needle, where you shall appoint; if\r\nyou feel it, I presume you will acknowledge, a _Nerve_, or a _Fibrilla_,\r\nrelated to it, is touch'd; If you feel it not, I am sure some liquor either\r\nsanguineous or other, will follow the Needle; And from whence can that\r\ncome, but out of Vessels? unless {318} accidentally, as by a _Contusion_,\r\n&c., it be extravased, in which case my Argument will not be injured,\r\nbecause the part is depraved, whereas I speak of the parts, as they are in\r\ntheir natural State.\r\n\r\nTo confirm and illustrate all which, I desire, that the following\r\n_familiar_ Observations may be considered:\r\n\r\n1. If a Horse, fat and fair to look on, without a hollow to be seen between\r\nhis Muscles, be rid extreme hard, and into a great sweat, and then kept one\r\nday without water or moist meat, you shall see him took so thin in many\r\nplaces as in the _musculous_ parts, that you will hardly believe it to be\r\nthe same Horse, especially if he be (as the Phrase is among Horse-masters)\r\na _Nash_ or _Wash-Horse_. The cause of which thinness will easily be\r\ngranted to be only an exhaustion of Juice, expended out of the Blood, which\r\ndid stuff out these Vessels. And whoever, that is used to ride hard, shall\r\nobserve, how thick this foul Horse breaths, and at what a rate he will reek\r\nand sweat, will not much wonder at the alteration. But if the Horse be a\r\nhardy one, and used to be hard ridden, then you will see, that one days\r\nrest, and his belly full of good meat and drink, will in one day or two\r\nalmost restore him to his former plight, the food being within that short\r\nspace of time so distributed, that all the Vessels will be replenish'd\r\nagain, as before. And the cleaner the Horse is, the sooner recruited, and\r\nthe less sign of hard riding will appear. This seems to shew the facility,\r\nwith which the Juice, called Blood, passeth; Which surely, if there were\r\nsuch a thing as a _Parenchyma_ might by several accidents (not difficult to\r\nmention) be so deprav'd in several parts of it, that it might lose its\r\nreceptive faculty; than which it may be thought to have none of greater\r\nuse, being supposed to be without Vessels.\r\n\r\n2. Discoursing sometimes with _Grasiers_ in the Country, about the Pasture\r\nof Cattle, I have been informed by them, that, if they buy any Old Beasts,\r\nOxen, or Cows to feed, they choose rather those that are as poor as can be,\r\nso they be sound; because that, if they are pretty well in flesh, what they\r\nthen add to them by a good pasture, though it make them both look and sell\r\nwell, yet it will not make them eat so well, their flesh proving hard and\r\nvery tough: Which some may suppose to be the age of _Parenchyma_; and so it\r\nis of that so called. But if those Beasts be old and extremely poor, then\r\nthey feed very kindly, and will be not only very fat but spend well, like\r\nyoung ones, and eat very tender.\r\n\r\nOf which I take the reason (excluding a _Parenchyma_ now) to be this. When\r\nan Oxe or a Cow is grown old, and in an indifferent plight as to his\r\n_flesh_ (for so it is called) all those Vessels having been kept at that\r\nsize for the most part, have contracted a tenseness and firmness, and their\r\n_fibers_ less extensive, nor so fitted for the reception of more unctuous\r\nparticles to relaxe them; and that additional unctuous matter, which\r\noccasions fatness, is forced to seek new quarter any where (often remote\r\nfrom Muscles) where it can be with least difficulty received; sometimes to\r\none place, sometimes to {319} another, as may be seen in Shambles. Whereas,\r\nif there were such a thing as a _Parenchyma_, that certainly would, like a\r\nhungry Sponge, immediately swell up in several parts, (which without much\r\ndifficulty might be discover'd in the dissection) and more eminently, where\r\nit should find the pores most potent: And in the dissection of such Muscles\r\nit would be very strange, not to find some, if not many, pieces of them in\r\nvarious shapes, to the great inconvenience of the parts, in which they are\r\nseated: Which yet I confess I could never find in any Muscle unless it were\r\nwhere there had been a _Contusion_, or an _Impostume_, or the like. But\r\naccording to my opinion of the _Parenchymous_ parts, the reason, why the\r\nFlesh of a very lean Ox or Cow, that hath got new Flesh in a good pasture,\r\neats tenderer, seems to be this: That in a very lean Beast the Vessels\r\ndesigned for admitting and distributing the nourishing Juice, are so near\r\ncontracted, and lye so close together; that, when once they are relax'd; by\r\nfresh and unctuous nourishment, they extend every way in all _extensive_\r\nparts, until in a short time the whole Creature is, as it were, created a\r\nnew, having got new flesh upon old bones. And the necessity of extreme\r\nextension makes all those parts, that are, as has been said, for the\r\nadmission of nourishment, so thin and fine, that it will make the lean\r\nBeast, put into a rich pasture, eat young and tender: Whereas one of the\r\nsame Age, that never was very poor, fed in the same pasture, shall eat hard\r\nand tough.\r\n\r\n3. It has been observed, that Corpulent Persons in some Diseases, that\r\nseize on them, do fall away to wonder, not only in the Wast, but in the\r\nArms, Legs, and Thighs; and the very Calves of the Legs have been observed\r\nso flaccid and loose, that one might wrap the skin about the bones. The\r\nreason whereof, according to the opinion deliver'd, may be easily rendred\r\nto be, A great Consumption of the Stock of Liquors, that in Health kept the\r\nVessels turgid; Which Vessels I suppose to make up those Muscles. But when\r\nthe Pores are obstructed, that the nourishment is hindred (which then also\r\nuses to be but sparingly administred) and sweats, either spontaneous, or\r\nforced, are large, there must needs be a great expence of those Liquors,\r\nthe supply being but inconsiderable: which cannot but contract all these\r\nducts of all sorts nearer together, and make them much less in themselves,\r\nmeerly from Exhaustion: Or, if there should be no sweats, the internal Heat\r\nspends the spirits, and dries up the Liquors; the consequence whereof may\r\nreasonably be presumed to be this Flaccidity of parts, and great and sudden\r\nChange, made in them; not that there is need of any _Parenchyma_ to fill up\r\nthese Muscles considering what hath been said. Mean while, I humbly\r\nconceive, that if it be in any part of a Muscle, their Ingenuity, that\r\nplead for it, will put them upon some experiments, to bring it to Ocular\r\nDemonstration, either in Living or Dead Muscle, any kind of flesh, raw,\r\nrosted, boyl'd, or in what they can best make it out. And when I shall be\r\nconvinc'd of an Errour in what I have discoursed, I shall beg pardon for\r\ngiving the Occasion of the trouble of that Experiment, which shall prove a\r\n{320} _Parenchyma_ in any Muscle; and think my time well spent in receiving\r\na full satisfaction of the ungroundedness of my opinion; and readily submit\r\nto the Author, with a grateful acknowledgement of my Obligation to any one\r\nthat shall rectifie me in my mistake, if it be one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Observables touching _Petrification_._\r\n\r\nThough much hath been already said and written of _Petrification_, yet 'tis\r\nconceived, that all that comes so far short of a competent stock for the\r\ncomposing of a perfect _History of Petrification_, that the incompleatness\r\nthereof ought to awaken the more diligent attention of the Curious, and to\r\ncall in their aid for Additions, thereby so to encrease and to complete the\r\n_Materials_ for that work, that it may the better serve to clear and make\r\nout the Cause of that Transmutation. And that the rather, because if it lay\r\nin the power of humane Skill (by the knowledge of _Nature_'s works) to\r\nraise _Petrification_, or to allay, or prevent it, or to order and direct\r\nit (which perchance in time might be attained the said way) much use might\r\nbe made of this Art; especially if it could be made applicable to hinder\r\nthe Generation of the Stone and Gravel in humane Bodies, or to dissolve the\r\nStone, where 'tis formed; besides other valuable Uses, that might be\r\nexcogitated.\r\n\r\nUpon this Consideration, care is, and further _will be_ taken in these\r\nPapers, to record, among other Observables of Nature, what shall be\r\ncommunicated of this kind of _Change_.\r\n\r\nIn _Num._ 1. 2. and 5. several Relations have been made belonging to this\r\nArgument. Much of it, together with considerable Reflections may be seen in\r\nMr. _Boyle_'s _Essay of Firmness_: In _Helmont de Lithiase_, where, among\r\nother remarques, is recited the Testimony of _Paræus_ of a _Petrified\r\nChild_ seen at _Paris_, and by the Owner used for a _Whetstone_: In\r\n_Densingius_'s Historia _Infantis in Abdomine inventi, & in duritiem\r\nlapideam conversi_: In Mr. _Hook_'s _Micrography_, and in others. To omit\r\nnow, what has been related (but perhaps not well enough attested) by\r\nAuthors, concerning the stupendious Petrifications of whole Companies of\r\nMen, and Troops of Cattle; by _Aventinus_, lib. 7. _Annal. Bojorum_; by\r\n_Purchas_ in his _Pilgrimage_ p. 416. in fol. printed at _London_ 1614,\r\nand, (of a Troop of _Spanish_ Horsemen) by _Jos. Acosta_ lib. 3. c. 9.\r\n\r\nTo all which, the curious Dr. _Beale_ now adds a Narrative of a Stone, not\r\nlong since taken out of the Womb of a Woman of his neighbourhood neer\r\n_Trent_ in _Somersetshire_, by incision, and afterwards perfectly cured,\r\nthough she had born the Stone with extreme torments for. 8. or 9. years.\r\nThe operation he relates to have been made in _Easter_ last; after which\r\ntime, he affirms to have seen the Stone, and weigh'd it in Gold Scales,\r\nwhere it wanted somewhat of four Ounces, but had lost of the weight, it\r\nformerly had, {321} being very light for a Stone of that Bulk. He further\r\ndescribes to be of a whitish colour, lighter than Ash-colour; perchance\r\n(_saith he_) not unlike to that recited out of _Scaliger_ by Mr. _Boyle_ in\r\nhis _Essay of Firmness_ pag. 238. _qui aëris contactis postea in gypseam\r\ntum speciem tum firmitatem concreverat_. It had no deep asperities, and had\r\nsomewhat of an Oval figure, but less at one end, than a Hen-Egge, and\r\nbigger and blunter at the other end, than a Goose egge.\r\n\r\nThis Stone, (so he concludes) is intended for the _Royal Society_, with the\r\nTestimony of the _Chirurgion_, that perform'd the Operation, and other\r\nWitnesses of special credit; where also will be annexed the _manner_ of\r\nOperation.\r\n\r\nIt appears by this last clause (to add that on this occasion) that this\r\nWell-wisher to the Improvement of all usefull knowledge, has taken notice\r\nof that considerable _Collection of Curiosities_, lately presented to the\r\nlately nam'd Society for their _Repository_, by the Publick-minded\r\nGentleman Mr. _Daniel Colwall_, a very worthy and useful Member of that\r\nBody: To which Repository whatsoever is presented as rare and curious, will\r\nbe with great care, together with the _Donors names_ and their\r\n_Beneficence_ recorded, and the things preserved for After-ages, (probably\r\nmuch better and safer, than in their own private Cabinets;) and in progress\r\nof Time will be employed for considerable Philosophical and Usefull\r\npurposes; of which perhaps more largely in another place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of a kind of _Worms_ that eat out Stones._\r\n\r\n    This is taken out of a Letter, written by one _M. de la Voye_ to _M.\r\n    Auzout_, to be found in the 32. _Journal des Scavans_; as follows.\r\n\r\nIn a great and very ancient Wall of Free-Stone in the _Benedictins Abby_ at\r\n_Caen_ in _Normandy_, facing Southward, there are to be found many Stones\r\nso eaten by Worms, that one may run his hand into most of the Cavities\r\nwhich are variously fashion'd, like the Stones, which I have seen wrought\r\nwith so much Art in the _Louvre_: In these cavities there is abundance of\r\nlive-Worms, their excrement, and of that Stone-dust, they eat. Between many\r\nof the Cavities there remain but leaves, as it were, of Stone, very thin,\r\nwhich part them. I have taken some of these living Worms, which I found in\r\nthe eaten Stone, and put them into a Box with several bits of the Stone;\r\nleaving them there together for the space of eight days; and then opening\r\nthe Box, the Stone seem'd to me eaten so sensibly, that I could no longer\r\ndoubt of it, I send you the Box and the Stones in it, together with the\r\nliving Worms: and to satisfie your Curiosity, I shall relate to you, what I\r\nhave observed of them both _with_ and _without_ a _Microscope_. {322}\r\n\r\nThese Worms are inclosed in a Shell, which is grayish and of the bigness of\r\na Barly-corn, sharper at one end, than the other. By the means of an\r\nexcellent _Microscope_ I have observ'd, that 'tis all overspread with\r\nlittle Stones and little greenish Eggs; and that there is at the sharpest\r\nend a little hole by which these Creatures cast out their excrement, and at\r\nthe other end, a somewhat bigger hole, through which they put out their\r\nheads and fasten themselves to the Stones, they gnaw. They are not so shut\r\nup, but that sometimes they come out, and walk abroad. They are all black,\r\nabout two _Lines_ of an inch long and three quarters of a _Line_ large.\r\nTheir Body is distinguish't into several plyes, and near their head they\r\nhave three feet on each side, which have but two Joynts resembling those of\r\na Lowse. When they move, their Body is commonly upwards, with their mouth\r\nagainst the Stone. They have a big head, somewhat flat, and even, of the\r\ncolour of a Tortoise-Shell, braunish, with some small white hair. Their\r\nmouth is also big; where may be seen four kinds of Jaw-bones, lying\r\ncrossewise, which they move continually, opening and shutting them like a\r\npair of _Compasses_, with four branches. The Jaws on both sides of the\r\nmouth are all black, the nether Jaw hath a point like the Sting of a Bee,\r\nbut uniform. They draw threds out of their mouth with their fore-feet,\r\nusing that point to range them, and to form their Shells of them. They have\r\nTen Eyes, very black and round, which appear to be bigger than a Pins head.\r\nThere are five of them on each side of the head, standing after this\r\nmanner,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut besides these Worms, I have found, that _Mortar_ is eaten by an\r\ninfinite number of small Creatures, of the bigness of Chees-Mites. These\r\nhave but two Eyes, and are blackish. They have four feet on each side\r\npretty long. The point of their Muzzle is very sharp, as that of a Spider.\r\nI send you but one of them, though I had abundance, but they are dead and\r\nlost. It may be, you'l find some at _Paris_, seeing that in the old Mortar\r\nbetwixt Stones, that is found in Walls made with rubbish, there is great\r\nstore of them, together with great plenty of their little Eggs. I have not\r\nyet examined, whether these be those, that in the surfaces of all the\r\nStones, where they are met with, make little round holes, and small traces\r\nand impressions, which make them look like _Worm-eaten Wood_. But 'tis\r\nprobable, they are such. It should be observed, whether these Worms do not\r\ntake Wings, and all the other appearances of Caterpillars; and whether they\r\nare not to be found in plaister that is full of holes, in Bricks, in Greety\r\nStones, and in Rocks.\r\n\r\nYou may observe more of them in Walls exposed to the _South_, than in\r\nothers; and that the Worms, that eat the Stone, live longer, then those,\r\n{323} that eat the Mortar, which keep not above eight days alive. I have\r\nobserved all their parts with a very good _Microscope_, without which, and\r\na great deal of attention, 'tis difficult to see them well.\r\n\r\nI have seen other very old Walls altogether eaten, as those of the _Temple_\r\nat _Paris_, where I could find no Worms, but the Cavities were full of\r\nShells of various kinds, diversly figur'd and turn'd: all which I believe\r\nto be little Animals petrified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some promiscuous Observations, made in _Somerset shire_, and imparted by\r\nthe above-mentioned Dr. _Beale_._\r\n\r\nHis words are these, in a Letter to the _Publisher_, of the 24. _Septemb._\r\n1666 at _Yeovill_ in _Somersetshire_;\r\n\r\nI have two or three remarks, perhaps not unworthy to be recorded for\r\nfurther application in like cases of time and place\r\n\r\n1. In the Moores from hence towards _Bridgewater_, in the extreme drought,\r\nwe have endured this Summer, some lengths of pasture grew much sooner\r\nwhithered and parched, than the other pasture. And this Parched part seem'd\r\nto bear the length and shape (in gross) of Trees. They digg'd, and found,\r\nin the place, _Oakes_ indeed, as black as Ebony. And hence they have been\r\ninstructed to find and take up many hundreds of Oakes, as a neighbour of\r\ngood credit assures me. This advertisement may be instructive for other\r\nparts, as _Kent_, _Essex_, _Lincoln_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _This had somewhat of a Vitriolate taste. But the Experiment\r\nbeing made with greater quantities of this water, which questionless will\r\nbe done, the nature and kind of it may be better known._]\r\n\r\n2. My Cosen _Philips_ of _Montague_ has in his pastures of _Socke_, about\r\nthree miles off, a large Pool, to which Pigeons resort; but the Cattle will\r\nnot drink of it, no not in the extream want of water in this drought. To\r\nthe taste it is not only brackish, but hath other loathsome tasts. In a\r\nVenice-glass it looked greenish and clear, just like the most greenish\r\nCider as soon as it is perfectly clarified. I boyl'd a Pint of it in a\r\nPosnet of Bell-Mettall (commonly used to preserve Sweatmeats:) suddenly it\r\nyeilded a thick froth, whence I scumm'd half a score Spoonfulls; of which\r\nthe inclosed is a part, * Suffering the water to be boyl'd all away, it\r\nleft much of the same on the sides and bottom of the Posnet.\r\n\r\n3. From _Lamport_, towards _Bridge water_, Eeles are so cheap in the frosts\r\nof Winter, that they vend them for little. Their abundance is from hence,\r\nthat as the people walk, in the frosty Mornings, on the banks of river,\r\nthey discern, towards the edges of the banks, some parts _not hoar_, as the\r\nrest, but _green_; where searching the holes of the banks they find heaps\r\nof Eeles.\r\n\r\n{324}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Problem for finding the Year of the _Julian Period_ by a new and very\r\neasie Method._\r\n\r\nThis occurs in the _Journal des Scavans_ n^o. 96. as it had been proposed\r\ncommunicated to the Learned _Jesuit DE BILLY_. viz.\r\n\r\nMultiply the _Solar_ Cycle by 4845. and the _Lunar_, by 4200. and that of\r\nthe _Indiction_, by 6916.

M.\r\n\r\nThis Treatise, published the last year, would sooner have been taken notice\r\nof in these _Tracts_, had it not escaped the _Publishers_ view till of\r\nlate, when he, upon serious perusal, found it very worthy the recommending\r\nit to all sorts of persons; and particularly to those who either please\r\nthemselves with that fond opinion, _That Philosophy is the Apprentiship of\r\nAtheisme_; or hearken to the aspersions, that are generally laid upon the\r\n_Reformation_ of _Philosophy_.\r\n\r\nThis excellent piece removes both these; and being joyned and compared with\r\nthe truly Noble Mr. _Boyle_'s Considerations in his _First part_ of the\r\n{325} _Usefulness of Experimental-Natural Philosophy_, will strongly\r\nevince, How Much that Philosophy, which searches out the real Productions\r\nof Nature (the true Works of God) does manifest the Divine Glory more, than\r\nthe Notionals of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nThis Author (now a Fellow of the _Royal Society_) delivers his Matter in\r\ntwo Books.\r\n\r\nLib. 1. Cap. 1. Atheists are disappointed of the Authority of _Epicurus_,\r\nand of other Antient Philosophers, for their gross Atheisme.\r\n\r\nCap. 2. The beautiful Frame of the World evinceth the Architectonical\r\nAuthor and Governor.\r\n\r\nCap. 3. The admirable Contrivance in the Structure of Mankind, and of\r\nAnimals, does more conspicuously shew the Deity.\r\n\r\nCap. 4. The Atheist caught in his own Net, or convinced by the true force\r\nof his own Arguments.\r\n\r\nCap. 5. The Arguments devised against Atheists by _Des Cartes_, and drawn\r\nfrom the _Idea's_ of our Mind, examin'd and found imperfect and invalid.\r\n\r\nLib. 2. Cap. 1. The opinions of the Gentiles concerning God, unduly applied\r\nto the _Deity_, which we worship: but properly to be understood by them of\r\nthe _Sun_, or of the _Soul of the World_.\r\n\r\nCap. 2. More expresly proved, that the Antient Philosophers conceived, the\r\n_Soul of the World_ to be God.\r\n\r\nCap. 3.

The Divine Substance, Immensity, Incomprehensibility, Invisibility,\r\nexplicated, as far as our weak reason does teach.\r\n\r\nCap. 5. The Divine Perfections, and other Attributes and Affections, how\r\nfar explicable.\r\n\r\nCap. 6. The Eternity of God, how apprehended.\r\n\r\nThese are in short the Heads of the Book, which is yet but in Latin. It\r\nwere to be wisht, the Author would make it speak his own lively _English_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HONORATI FABRI _Soc. Jesu Theologi, Tractatus duo; quorum Prior est de\r\nPlantis & de Generatione Animalium; Posterior de Homine._\r\n\r\nAs the Matter of this Book is considerable, so is the order and dependence\r\nof all its parts excellent; in regard that all the Propositions are ranged\r\naccording to a Geometrical method, and so well disposed, that the latter do\r\nalways suppose the former, and seem to depend all of them upon certain\r\nevident principles, whence they flow by a natural consequence.\r\n\r\nThis _Volume_ contains two Treatises.\r\n\r\nThe _First_ is divided into 5. Books. In the _four first_, he treats of\r\n_Plants_, and distributes them into three _Classes_; some growing _in the\r\nEarth_, as _Trees_; others, growing upon _Plants_, as _Mosse_; and a third\r\nsort growing upon _Animals_, as _Hair_, _Horns_, and _Feathers_. He examins\r\nand considers the {326} Parts of all these Plants and their Use, the\r\nmanner, how they are produced, and nourished; and their different\r\nQualities. He discourses also of Bread, Wine, Oyle, and the other Mixtures,\r\nthat are made of Plants.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fifth Book_, he treats of the _Generation of Animals_, where he\r\ndelivers many curious matters, explicating in a very easie and familiar way\r\nthat Argument, which hath always been lookt upon, as one of the obscurest\r\nin Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe _Second_ Treatise consists of 7. Books; wherein the Author considers,\r\nwhat appertains to _Man_. He discourses _first_, of Digestion, of the\r\nCirculation of the Bloud, and of the Use of the principal parts of the\r\nHumane Body. _Next_, he treats of the Senses, External and Internal; of all\r\nthe Motions of the Body, both Natural and Voluntary, of the sensitive\r\nAppetite, and the Passions; _Thence_ he proceeds to the Temperaments,\r\nHabits, Instinct, Sleep, Sickness, &c. _Lastly_, passing to the _Rational\r\nSoul_, he endeavours to demonstrate the Immortality thereof, and to explain\r\nalso the Manner, how it worketh upon the Body, and is united with the Body;\r\nwhere he omits not to reason of all the Powers of the Soul, of Liberty, and\r\nof the Operations of the Understanding and Will.\r\n\r\nIn _general_, the Author makes it his study, for the explicating of the\r\nmost perplext Difficulties, to shew, that Nature works not but by very\r\nsimple and easie wayes.\r\n\r\nIn _particular_ he intersperses several curious remarks. _E.g._ He teaches\r\nhow to make _Perspectives_, that magnifie Objects, without Glass; telling\r\nus, that when an Object is look't upon through a small hole, it appears\r\nmuch greater than it is; and that therefore, if instead of Glasses one did\r\ncast before ones eyes two _Plates_ having little holes in them, it would\r\nfurnish us with a new kind of _Perspectives_, more commodious than those of\r\nGlasses, which spoil the Sight by reason of the refraction of the Rayes,\r\ncaused thereby. _Again_, He renders the cause of that common, but\r\nsurprising, effect of Painters, drawing certain Pourtraictures, which seem\r\nto look directly upon all their Beholders, on what side soever they place\r\nthemselves: _Videl._ That in those Pictures, the Nose it a little turned to\r\none side, and the eyes to the other. Whence it comes, that such pictures\r\nseem to look to the right side, because the Eyes are indeed turned that\r\nway; but they appear also to look to the left, because the point of the\r\nNose is turned that way, and the Table, whereon the Picture is drawn, being\r\nflat the Looker on perceives not, that the Eyes are turned th'other way;\r\nwhich he would do, if the Eyes of the Pourtrait were convex: Whence it\r\ncomes, that no Figure can be made embossed, which looks every way.\r\n\r\nThe art, which he teaches of making _Parsley_ shoot out of the ground in a\r\nfew hours, is this. Infuse the seed of it in Vinegar; and having sown it in\r\ngood ground cast on it a good quantity of the Ashes of Bean-Cods, and\r\nsprinkle it with Spirit of Wine, and then cover it with some linnen. He\r\nmentions also; that if you calcine Earth, and then water it well, it will\r\n{327} produce a great variety of different Herbs, and that the Ashes of\r\nCorn burnt, being sown, have sometimes produced other Corn.\r\n\r\nTo add that by the by, this Author is not so addicted to _Aristotle_, as to\r\nbe on his side, when he thinks Truth is not. He hath emancipated himself\r\nconsiderably from the _Scholastick_ way of Philosophing. He dares maintain,\r\nthat the Vegetative and Sensitive Souls are not _Substantial_ Forms; and\r\nthat it is with Plants and Animals, as with Artificial things, the Form\r\nwhereof results from the Union and Disposition of the parts. According to\r\nthis _Hypothesis_ he explicates all the Operations of Plants and Animals,\r\nwithout having any recourse to the Soul. He avers also, that there are no\r\n_Species Intentionales_, and no Habitudes, and that the Animal Spirits,\r\nwhich Philosophers commonly believe to be necessary for all the Operations\r\nof Life, are useless.\r\n\r\nIt might also be observed out of this Author, what he discourses of the\r\nGeneration of Animals by Putrefaction; of the Cause of intermittent\r\n_Feavers_, and of the Animal Instinct, and of many other particulars; were\r\nit not better to refer the curious to the Book it self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _RELATION DU VOYAGE de l' Evesque de Beryte, par la Turquie, la Perse,\r\nles Indes, _&c._ jusques au Royaume de Siam, & autres lieux_; par M. _de\r\nBourges, Prestre_ &c.\r\n\r\nThis Author imploying his Pen chiefly, according to his design, to give an\r\nAccompt of the Success, the Undertakers of this Voyage had, in propagating\r\nthe Christian Faith in the remoter parts of the World, and relating on that\r\noccasion, What number of Churches they have founded in _Cochin_, _China_,\r\nand the Kingdom of _Tonquin_, (in which latter alone he affirms, that there\r\nare more than three hundred thousand Christians;) being I say principally\r\nintent upon that Subject, he seems not to have made many Philosophical\r\nobservations in those places. Mean while he does good service to those that\r\nhave occasion to travel into the _East-Indies_ mostly by Land, by\r\ndescribing the passage, they took thither; which was, That they embarqued\r\nat _Marseilles_, in _September_, the most convenient and favourable season\r\nfor that Voyage; whence Ships do ordinarily pass every Month from _Syria_,\r\nreckoning one Month for the time of Sayling, to _Alexandretta_. Thence to\r\n_Aleppo_, counting one Month more for the Stay, to be made there to meet\r\nthe _Caravane_ for _Babylon_, and six weeks more for the march from\r\n_Aleppo_ to _Babylon_, where a fortnight will pass before an opportunity\r\nhappen to embarque upon the _Tyger_ for _Balsora_; which Journey will\r\nrequire a fortnight more: And about this time it will be about the end of\r\n_January_. Thence is always conveniency to pass from _Congo_, 4 days\r\nJourney from _Comoron_ or _Gombroun_, to which latter part there is also\r\nfrequent occasion to pass by Sea from _Balsora_, which will take up some 15\r\nor 16. days Sail. There (vid. at _Comoron_) you will every year meet with\r\n_English_, _Portugal_, _Dutch_, and _Moorish_ Vessels, from _Surat_, from\r\n_October_ till the end of _April_, for they are obliged to be at _Surate_,\r\nbefore the end of _May_, because all the ports of those {328} _Indies_ are\r\nshut the 4. ensuing months, by reason of the danger of that _Sea_.\r\n\r\nBut besides this Direction, the Book is not quite destitute of _Natural_\r\nObservations. It relates, 1. How Diamonds are found and separated in\r\n_Golconda_; They take of the Earth, held to be proper to form them, which\r\nis reddish, and distinguish'd with white veins, and full of flints and hard\r\nlumps. Then they put near the places, which they will digge, a close and\r\neven Earth; and to it they carry those Earths, they have digg'd out of the\r\nMine, and gently spread it abroad, and leave it exposed to the Sun for two\r\ndays. Then being dryed enough they beat it, and sifting this Earth, they\r\nfind the Diamonds in ashes of Flints, in which Nature hath set them. Here\r\nhe adds, that the King of that Country farms out these Diamond-Mines for\r\n600000. Crowns _per annum_, reserving to himself the right of all the\r\nDiamonds, that exceed ten _Carats_ in weight. There are Diamonds, that\r\nmount to 35. and 40. _Carats_. And this is the great Treasure of that\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n2. That the most esteemed fruit in those parts; the _Durion_ (of the\r\nbigness and shape of an ordinary _Melon_) has a very unpleasing and uneven\r\nuntollerable smell, like to that of a rotten _Apple_.\r\n\r\n3. That _Rice_ prospers most in waterish grounds; and that the fields,\r\nwhere it grows best, resembles rather to Marshes, than to any ploughed\r\nSoyle: Yea, that that Grain has the force, though 6. or 7. foot water stand\r\nover it, to shoot its Stalk above it; and that the Stem, which bears it,\r\nrises and grows proportionably to the height of the water, that drowns the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n4. That the way of keeping ones self harmless from a wild _Elephant_, when\r\nhe runs directly upon one, is, to hold something to him; as a Hat, a Coat,\r\na piece of Linnen, which he seises on with his Trunk; and playes with it,\r\nas if he were pleased with this apparent homage, done to him; and so passes\r\non. If he be in a rage, that then the only remedy is, to turn incessantly\r\nbehind him to the left side, in regard that naturally (_saith this Author_)\r\nhe never turns himself that way, but to the right: And the time, there is\r\nto turn, because of the Beasts unweildiness, affords leisure enough to\r\nclimbe up some high Tree, or to mount some steep ground: all which if it\r\nfail, by holding always his tail, and turning with him, the Animal will be\r\ntired, and give opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed by _T.

From\r\nthe But of the same Tree, one of the spreading Clawes having been formerly\r\ncut off with an Axe, that part of the But, from whence the same was\r\nsever'd, being about 1½ foot above ground, and inward within the trunk\r\n{330} of the Tree, hath contracted a petrfied Crust, about the thickness of\r\na _shilling_, all over the woody part within the Bark; the Marks of the Axe\r\nalso remaining very conspicuous, with this petrified crust upon it. By what\r\nmeans it should thus happen, cannot well be conceived, in regard there is\r\nno water neer it; the part, above the ground and out of the weather; the\r\nTree yet growing: unless being cut at some season, when the sap was\r\nflowing, the owsing of the sap might become petrified by the Air, and the\r\nTree grow rotten and hollow inward since that time; which how long since,\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\nA piece of that part cut, was presented, together with this Account, to the\r\nsaid _Society_, for their _Repository_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Articles of Inquiries touching _Mines_._\r\n\r\nWhat the Honourable _Robert Boyle_ gave the Reader cause to hope for, in\r\n_Numb_. 11. when he was pleased to impart those _General Heads_ for a\r\nNatural History of a Country, _there_ publish'd; He is not un-mindful to\r\nperform, by enlarging them as occasion serves, with _Particular_ and\r\n_Subordinate_ Inquiries. Here he gratifies the Curious with a considerable\r\nSet of Inquiries about _Mines_: which though unfinish'd, yet the\r\n_Publisher_, was instant to obtain their present Publication, to the end,\r\nthat he might the more conveniently recommend them to several Forreigners\r\nof his Acquaintance, now ready to return to their several Countryes, which\r\nhe understands to abound in Mines; and from the Curious Inhabitants\r\nwhereof, he expects to receive a good Accompt upon some at least of these\r\nInquiries; which also by several of them have been earnestly desired, as\r\nInstructions, to direct them, what Particulars to inquire after upon this\r\nSubject.\r\n\r\nThese Quæries are reduced by the _Author_ to six Heads:\r\n\r\nThe _first_, The neighbouring Country about the Mines.\r\n\r\nThe _second_, The Soyl where the Mines are.\r\n\r\nThe _third_, The Signs of Mines.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_, The Structure and other particulars belonging to the Mines\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_, The Nature and Circumstances of the Ore.\r\n\r\nThe _sixth_, the Reduction of the Ore into Metal. {331}\r\n\r\n_QUÆRIES_\r\n\r\n_About the first Title._\r\n\r\n1.

What Cattle it nourishes, and whether they have any such thing peculiar\r\nin point of bigness, colour, shape, longævity, fitness or unfitness to make\r\ngood meat, &c. as may be rather adscribed to the peculiar nature of the\r\nplace, than to the barrenness of the Soyl, or other manifest causes?\r\n\r\n4. Whether the Natives, and other Inhabitants, live longer or shorter than\r\nordinary? Whether they live more or less healthy? Whether they be subject\r\nto any _Epidemical_ Diseases, that may very probably be imputed to the\r\nMines; and what these Diseases are; and what Remedies are found successful?\r\n\r\n5.

Whether the Air be dry or moist; hot or cold; clear or foggy; thick or\r\nthin; heavy or light; and especially, whether the Weather be more or less\r\nvariable than ordinarily; or whether it be subject to great and sudden\r\nchanges, that may probably be imputed to the Mineral and Subterraneous\r\nSteams; and what they are? {332}\r\n\r\n_About the second Title._\r\n\r\n7. Whether the _Soyle_ that is neer the Surface of the Earth, be Stony;\r\nand, if it be, what kind of Stones it abounds with? Whether it be Clayie,\r\nMarley, Chalkye, &c. And, if it be of several kinds, how many they are; and\r\nby what properties they are distinguish'd?\r\n\r\n_About the third Title._\r\n\r\n8. By what _Signs_ they know or guess, that there is a Mine in such a\r\nplace?\r\n\r\n9. These Signs are _either_ upon the Surface of the Earth, _or beneath_ it.\r\n\r\nTo the _former_ belong these _Quæries_.\r\n\r\n10. Whether the Ground be made barren by Metalline or Mineral Effluviums?\r\n\r\n11. Whether it be observed, that Trees and other greater Plants seem to\r\nhave their tops burnt, or other leaves or outsides discoloured? or whether\r\nthere be any Plants, that do affect to grow over such Mines; and whether it\r\nhave been tryed, that other Plants, that would prosper in the adjacent\r\nplaces, will not be made to grow and thrive there?\r\n\r\n12. Whether the Stones and Pebles, that are wash'd by the Brooks, Springs,\r\nor other Waters, have any colour'd substance left upon them; and if they\r\nhave, of what colour, weight, &c. these adherences are?\r\n\r\n13. Whether the Waters of the place proposed, do by their tast, smell,\r\nponderousness, &c. disclose themselves to contain Minerals? And, if they\r\ndo, what Minerals they or their residences, when they are evapourated away,\r\ndo appear to abound with, or to participate of?\r\n\r\n14. Whether _Snow_ will not lye, or _Frost_ continue so long, or _Dew_ be\r\ngenerated or stay upon the ground in the place proposed, as on other\r\nneighbouring grounds?\r\n\r\n15. Whether the _Dew_ that falls on that ground, will discolour white\r\nLinnen or Woollen-Cloths, spred overnight on the {333} surface of the\r\nground, and employed to collect the Dew? And whether the _Rain_ that falls\r\nthere, and may be supposed to come thither from elsewhere, will discolour\r\nsuch Clothes, or afford any residence of a Mineral Nature?\r\n\r\n16. Whether the Place be more than ordinarily subject to Thunder and\r\nLightning, and to sudden Storms or Earthquakes; as likewise to Nocturnal\r\nLights and fiery Meteors.\r\n\r\n17. Whether Mists use to rise from Grounds stored with Minerals? What is\r\nobservable in them, and what Minerals they signify, and may be supposed to\r\nbe produced by?\r\n\r\n18. Whether the _Virgula Divinatoria_ be used to find out the Veins of\r\nproposed Mines; and, if it be, with what success?\r\n\r\n19. What other Signs above ground afford probability of Mines, or Direction\r\nfor following a Vein over Hills, Valleys, Lakes, Rivers, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ sort of _Signs_ belonging to these _Quæries_, are such as\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n20. Whether there be any Clayes, Marles, or other Mineral Earths, yellow or\r\nliquid matters, that usually give notice of the Ore? And if there be more\r\nthan one, how and at what depths they are wont to lye respectively? Of what\r\nthickness and consistence they are; and in what Order the Diggers meet with\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n21. Whether there be any Stones or _Marchasites_ to be found neer, or not\r\nvery far from the surface of the ground, by which one may have ground to\r\nexpect a Mine? As is often observed in the Tin-Mines of _Cornwall_, over\r\nwhich such kind of Stones are divers times found lying above ground?\r\n\r\n22. Whether all Stones of that kind do equally signify that Mine? And, if\r\nnot, how the significant Stones are to be known, as by Colour, Bigness,\r\nShape, Weight, Depth under ground, &c.\r\n\r\n23. Whether there be any Earths of peculiar kinds, as to Colour,\r\nConsistence, &c. that indicate a Mine beneath or near them; and, if there\r\nbe, what they are, and what is their consecution, if they have any?\r\n\r\n24. Whether Heat or Damps give any assurance or a probability of finding a\r\nMine? {334}\r\n\r\n25. Whether Water of any kind, met with in Digging, especially at this or\r\nthat depth, do betoken a Mine?\r\n\r\n26. Whether there be any Signs of the neerness of the Mine, and what they\r\nare?\r\n\r\n27. Whether there be any Signs of ones having miss'd the Mine, either by\r\nbeing past above, or beneath, or having left it on either hand; and what\r\nthey are?\r\n\r\n28. Whether there be any Signs not only of the distinct and determinate\r\nkind of Metals or Minerals; but of the Plenty and Goodness of the Vein; and\r\nwhat they are?\r\n\r\n29. Whether there be any Signs of the depth of the Vein beneath the surface\r\nof the Earth; and what they are?\r\n\r\n30. Whether there be any proper or peculiar Signs, that show it to be\r\nhopeless, or at least unlikely, to find a Vein in the place where it is\r\ndigg'd for; and what those are?\r\n\r\n_About the fourth Title._\r\n\r\n31. What is the depth of the Shaft or Groove (which though named in the\r\n_singular_ Number; the Questions about it are _generally_ applicable) till\r\nyou come at the Vein or Ore?\r\n\r\n32. Whether the Vein run or lye Horizontal, or dippe? And if it dippe, what\r\n_inclination_ it hath, how deep the lowest part lies; and consequently how\r\nmuch deeper than the uppermost? As also, what it's Flexures, if it have\r\nany, are? And whether it runs directly _North_ or _South_, _East_ or\r\n_West_; or seem rather to have a Casual tendency, than any determinate one\r\nby Nature? and how far it reaches in all?\r\n\r\n33. What is the Wideness of the Groove at the Top, and elsewhere? Whether\r\nthe Groove be perpendicular or crooked; and if crooked, after what manner,\r\nand with what distance it winds?\r\n\r\n34. How the Groove is supported? What are the kinds, length, bigness, and\r\nway of placing the Timber, Poles, &c. that are employed to support it? And\r\nhow long the Wood will last, without being spoyled with the subterraneous\r\nfumes and waters? and what wood lasts longest? {335}\r\n\r\n35. What Air-shaft belongs to the Mine? Whether it be _single_, or more\r\nthan One? Of what breadth the Air-shaft is at the Orifice? Whether it be\r\nconvenient enough, or not? How neer it is placed to the Groove; and in what\r\nposition? And if there be _several_ Air-shafts, what their Distances and\r\nscituation are in reference to the Groove, and to each other? Or how Air is\r\nsupplied, if there be no Air-shafts?\r\n\r\n36. Whether they meet with any Waters in the Mine? And, if they do, how\r\ncopious they are; at what depths they occur; how they are qualified; and\r\nwhat way they Spring, &c.\r\n\r\n37. Whether they are constant or temporary? whether they increase or\r\ndiminish notably in Summer or Winter, or at any other time of the year; and\r\nif they do, at what season that is; how long it is wont to last; and the\r\nproportions of Increase and Decrease?\r\n\r\n38. What Expedients and Engines are employed to free the Mines from Water?\r\nThe materials, the parts, the bigness, the shapes, the coaptation; and, in\r\nshort, the whole structure, number, and way of applying the Instruments,\r\nthat are made use off to free the Mines from Water?\r\n\r\n39. What are the Conditions, Number, &c. of the _Adits_?\r\n\r\n40. Whether the Mine be troubled with _Damps_, and of what kind they are?\r\nwhether they come often or seldom at any set time, or altogether\r\nirregularly? what Signs fore-run them? what mischief they do? what remedies\r\nare the most successfully imployed against them, aswell in reference to the\r\nCleering of the Mine, as to the Preservation and Recovery of the Workmen?\r\n\r\n41. What Methods the Mine-men use in following the Vein, and tracing their\r\npassages under ground (which they call _Plumming_ and _Dyalling_) according\r\nto the several exigencies? And whether they employ the Instruments, made\r\nwith the help of the Load-stone, the same way that is usual; and if not,\r\nwherein they differ in the use of the same Instruments; or what Instruments\r\nthey substitute in their place?\r\n\r\n42. What ways they take to secure themselves from the uncertainty, incident\r\nto the guidance of _Magnetick_ Needles from the _Iron-Stone_ or Ore, that\r\nthey may meet with under ground? {336} (of which yet perhaps there is not\r\nso great danger, as one may imagine; as far as I could find by a Trial, I\r\npurposely made in a Groove, where I was sure, there wanted not Iron-Ore.)\r\nAnd what other wayes may be used to direct Miners without the help of a\r\nLoad-stone?\r\n\r\n43. How the Miners deal with the Rocks and Sparrs, they often meet with,\r\nbefore they come at the Ore? Whether they use Fire to soften, calcine, or\r\ncrack them? How they employ it, and with what measure of success?\r\n\r\n44. What wayes and cautions they use, to free the Mine and secure the\r\nWork-men from the inconveniencies and danger accruing from the use of much\r\nfire in it?\r\n\r\n45. What Instruments they use to break the Rock &c? And how those\r\nInstruments are conducive; and how long they last?\r\n\r\n46. How the Mine-men work; whether naked or cloathed? And what Lights they\r\nuse to work by; what materials they are made of, what measure of light they\r\ngive; how long they last; and by what wayes they are kept burning in that\r\nthick and foggy air?\r\n\r\n47. How Veins are follow'd, lost, and recover'd? And how several Miners\r\nwork on the same Vein? And what is the best way of getting all the Ore in a\r\nVein, and most conveniently?\r\n\r\n48. How they convey out their Ore, and other things, that are to be carried\r\nout of the Mine? Whether they do it in Baskets drawn up by Ropes, or upon\r\nMens backs; and if this last-named way; what kind of Vessels they use for\r\nmatter, shape, and capacity? And whether the Work-men deliver them one to\r\nanother; or the same Work-men carry them all the way? And whether the\r\nDiggers descend and ascend by Ladders of Wood, or of Ropes, &c.\r\n\r\n_About the Fifth Title._\r\n\r\n49. Whether the Ore runs in a Vein; or lie dispers'd in scatter'd pieces;\r\nor be divided partly into a Vein, and partly into loose masses; or like a\r\nWall between two Rocks, as it were in a Cleft; or be interspers'd in the\r\nfirm Rock, like speckled Marble? Or be found in _Grains_ like _Sand_ or\r\n_Gravel_; as store {337} of excellent _Tin_ is said to be found in some\r\nparts of _Cornwall_ at the Sides and in the Channels of running Waters,\r\nwhich they call ...; or whether the Ore be of a softer consistence, like\r\n_Earth_ or _Lome_, as there is Lead-ore in _Ireland_ holding store of\r\nSilver, and Iron-ore in the North parts of _Scotland_ and elsewhere? And\r\nwhat is observable in it as to Weight, Colour, Mixture, &c?\r\n\r\n50. Whether any part of the Metal be found in the Mine perfect and\r\ncomplete? (As I have had presented me good valuable _Copper_, and pieces of\r\nperfect _Lead_, that were taken up, the one at _Jamaica_, and the other by\r\nan acquaintance of mine, that took them out of the ground himself in _New\r\nEngland_.)\r\n\r\n51. Whether the Mine affords any parcels of Metal, that seem to grow like\r\n_Plants_ (as I have sometimes seen Silver growing, as it seemed, out of\r\nStone, or _Sparre_ almost like blades of Grass; as also great Grains of a\r\nMetal, which appear'd to me, and which those, that tryed some of it,\r\naffirmed to be Gold, abounding in a stony lump, that seem'd to consist\r\nchiefly of a peculiar kind of _Sparre_.)\r\n\r\n52. Whether the Vein lie near, or much beneath the surface of the Earth,\r\nand at what depth?\r\n\r\n53. Whether the Vein have or have not any particular Concomitants, or Coats\r\n(if I may so call them;) and, if any, what they are, and in what order they\r\nlie? (As the Veins of _Lead-ore_, with us, have frequently annnext to them\r\na Substance call'd _Sparre_, and next to that another, call'd _Caulk_.)\r\n\r\n54. Whether (besides these Coats) the Vein have belonging to it any other\r\n_Heterogeneous_ substance? (As in _Tin-mines_ we often find that yellow\r\nsubstance, which they call _Mundick_.)\r\n\r\n55. What are the principal Qualities of these Extraneous substances? (As\r\nthat _Sparre _ is white, but transparent, almost like course Crystall,\r\nheavy, britle, easily divisible into flakes, &c. _Caulk_ is of a different\r\ntexture, white, opacous, and like a Stone, but much more ponderous.\r\n_Mundick_ I have had of a fine golden colour; but, though it be affirm'd to\r\nhold no Metal; yet I found it in weight, and otherwise, to differ from\r\n_Marchasites_; and the Mine-men think it of a poisonous nature.) {338}\r\n\r\n56. Whether the Vein be inclosed every way in its Coats; or whether it only\r\nlye between them?\r\n\r\n57. Whether the Vein be every way of an uniform breadth, and thickness;\r\nand, if it be, what these Dimensions are; and if not, in what places it\r\nvaries, and in what measures? (The like Questions are to be made concerning\r\nthe _sparre_, _Caulk_, and other Teguments or mixtures of the Ore?)\r\n\r\n58. Whether the Vein be un-interrupted, or in some places broken off; and\r\nwhether it be abruptly, or not; and whether it be by Vales, Brooks,\r\nGullets, &c?\r\n\r\n59. How wide the Interruptions are? what Signs, whereby to find the Vein\r\nagain? whether the ulteriour part or division of the Vein be of the same\r\nNature, and hold on in the same Course, as to its tendency upwards or\r\ndownwards, or Horizontally, Norward, Southward, &c. with the Vein, from\r\nwhich it is cut off?\r\n\r\n60. Whether, in case the last end of the Vein be found, it terminate\r\nabruptly, or else end in some peculiar kind of Rock or Earth, which does,\r\nas it were, close or Seal it up, without leaving any crack or cranny, or\r\notherwise? And whether the terminating part of the Vein tend upwards,\r\ndownwards, or neither? And whether in the places, where the Vein is\r\ninterrupted, there be any peculiar Stone or Earth, that does, as it were,\r\nseal up the Extremity of it?\r\n\r\n61. Whether it be observed; that the Ore in Tract of time may be brought to\r\nafford any Silver or Gold, which it doth not afford, or more than it would\r\nafford, if it were not so ripe? And whether it have been found, that the\r\nMetalline part of the Vein grows so, that some part of the Mine will afford\r\nOre or Metal in tract of time, that did not so before? And whether to this\r\nMaturation of the Mine, the being exposed to the free Air be necessary; or,\r\nwhether at least it conduce to the Acceleration of it; or otherwise?\r\n\r\n62. Whether all the Ore, contained in the Mine, be of the self-same nature\r\nand goodness; and, if not, what are the differing kinds; and how to be\r\ndiscriminated and estimated?\r\n\r\n63. What is the fineness and goodness of the Ore, by which the Mine is wont\r\nto be estimated? And what are the marks and {339} characters, that\r\ndistinguish one sort from another?\r\n\r\n64. What proportion of Metal it affords? (As in our _Iron-mines_ 'tis\r\nobserved, that about three Tuns of Iron-stone will afford one Tun of Metal:\r\nAnd I have had _Lead-Ore_, which an Ingenious man, to whom I recommended\r\nsuch Tryals, affirm'd to me to afford three parts in four of good Lead.)\r\n\r\n65. Whether the Ore be pure in its kind from other Metals, and, if not, of\r\nwhat Metals it participates; and in what proportion? Which is especially to\r\nbe Inquired into, in case the Mine be of a _base_ metal, that holds a\r\n_noble_ metal: (As I have known it observ'd, that _Lead-Ore_, that is poor\r\nin its own metal; affords more Silver, than other; and I remember, that the\r\n_Ore_ lately mention'd, being rich in Lead, scarce afforded us upon the\r\n_Cuppel_, an Atome of Silver. And _Matthesius_ informs us, that a little\r\nGold is not unfrequently found in _Iron-Ore_. And I have by me some Gold,\r\nthat never endur'd the Fire, taken out of a Lump of Tin-Ore.)\r\n\r\n_About the sixth Title._\r\n\r\n66. What are the mechanick and prævious Operations, as Beating, Grinding,\r\nWashing, &c. that are used to separate the Ore from the Heterogeneous\r\nBodies, and prepare it for the Fire? Or whether the Ore requires no such\r\npreparation? (as it often happens in Lead, and sometimes in Iron, &c.)\r\n\r\n67. Whether _Mercury_ be made use off, to extract the nobler from the baser\r\nmetals? (as is their practice in _Peru_, and other parts of the\r\n_West-Indies_.)\r\n\r\n68. Whether the leaving the Ore expos'd to the open Air and Rain for a good\r\nwhile, be used as a Præparative? (as I have seen done in _Iron-stone_.)\r\n\r\n69. Whether the Burning and Beating of the Ore be used to prepare it for\r\nthe Furnace? (as is practised in _Iron_, and almost always in _Copper_:)\r\nAnd, in case they use it more than once, how often they do it; (for,\r\n_Copper-Ore_ is in some places washed 8. or 10. times, and in others, 12.\r\nor 14.) and with what circumstances; as, how long the Ignition lasts at a\r\ntime, whether the Ore be suffer'd to cool of it self, or be quench'd?\r\nwhether it be washed betwixt each Ignition?\r\n\r\n70. What Flux-powders, and other ways they have to try {340} and examine\r\nthe goodness of the Ore in small quantities?\r\n\r\n71. Whether, when they work in _great_, they use to melt the Ore with any\r\nFlux or Additaments, or only by the force of the Fire, or in any way\r\nbetween both? (As throwing in of Charcoals when they melt Iron-stone does\r\nnot only serve to feed the Fire, but perhaps by the _Alchaly_ of its Ashes\r\nto promote the fusior: so Lime-stone, &c.)\r\n\r\n72. What kind of Furnaces they use, to melt the Ore in? Whether they be all\r\nof one sort and bigness, or of differing?\r\n\r\n73. What are, the Situation, Materials, Dimensions, Shape, Bigness, and in\r\nshort what is the whole structure and Contrivance of the Furnace? If there\r\nbe any thing peculiar and remarkable? What Tools are used in Smelting,\r\ntheir Figures, use, &c. And the whole manner of working?\r\n\r\n74. What kinds of Fewel, and what quantities of it, are wont to be employed\r\nin the Furnace, within the compass of a day, or week? How much is put in at\r\na time? How often it is renewed? And how much Ore in a determinate time, as\r\na week or a day, is wont to be reduced to Metal?\r\n\r\n75. In case an Additament be employed, what that is, and in what proportion\r\nit is added? Whether it be mingled with the Ore, before that be put into\r\nthe Fire, or cast in afterwards; and, if so, at what time, &c?\r\n\r\n78. Whether the Ore be melted by a Wind, excited by the Fire it self; as in\r\nWind-ovens? Ore by the course of Waters? Or acuated by the blast of\r\nBellows; and, if so, whether these Bellows be mov'd by a Wheel, turn'd by\r\nWater running under it, or falling on it? And what are, the Dimensions,\r\nSituation, &c. of the Bellows?\r\n\r\n79. What contrivance they have, to let or take out the Metal, that is in\r\nfusion; and cast it into Barrs, Sows, Pigs, &c?\r\n\r\n80. What Clay, Sand, or Mould they let it run or pour it through? And after\r\nwhat manner they refrigerate it?\r\n\r\n8l. Whether or no they do, either to facilitate the fusion, or to obtain\r\nthe more or better Metal, mingle differing sorts or degrees of Ore of the\r\nsame metal? (As in some places 'tis usual, to mingle poor and rich Ore; and\r\nat _Mendip_ they mix two or more of these differing kinds of _Lead-ore_\r\nthat they call _Frim-ore_, _Steel-ore_, _Potern-ore_, &c.) {341}\r\n\r\n82. Whether or no, having once brought the Ore to fusion, they melt all the\r\nMetal it self, to have it the more pure? And, if they do, with what\r\ncircumstances they make the fusion?\r\n\r\n83. Whether they have any Signs, whereby to know whether the Fusion have\r\nbeen well or ill perform'd; and the Metal have obtain'd the perfection, to\r\nbe expected from such Ore, melted in such a Furnace?\r\n\r\n84. Whether they observe any great difference in the goodness of the Metal,\r\nthat first melts, from that of the rest of the Metal which comes afterwards\r\nin the same or another operation? And whether the Rule holds constantly?\r\n(For, though they observe in _Tin-Mines_, the best Metal comes first, yet\r\nin the works of an Industrious friend of mine, he informs me, that the best\r\nMetal comes last.)\r\n\r\n85. Whether the produced Metal be all of the same goodness? And if it be,\r\nhow good it is in reference to the Metal of other Mines, or other parts of\r\nthe same Mine or Vein? And if it be not, what differences are observ'd\r\nbetween the produced portions of Metal; and what disparity that amounts to\r\nin the price?\r\n\r\n86. What are the Wayes of distinguishing them, and estimating their\r\ngoodness?\r\n\r\n87. Whether they do any thing to the Metal, after it is once brought to\r\nFusion, and, if need be, melt it over again, to give it a melioration? (As\r\nwhen _Iron_ is refined, and turn'd into Steel;) And what distinct Furnaces,\r\nand peculiar Ways of ordering the Metals are employ'd to effect this\r\nimprovement? With a full description of them and the Tools in all\r\nCircumstances, observ'd in the refining of Metals.\r\n\r\n88. Whether in those places, where the Metal is melted, there be not\r\nelevated some Corpuscles, that stick to the upper parts of the Furnace, or\r\nBuilding? And, if there be, whether they be barely fuliginous and\r\nrecrementitious exhalations, or, at least in part, Metallin Flowers? (As in\r\nthe _Cornish_ Tin-mines, after some years they usually destroy the thatch'd\r\nHouses, where the Ore hath been melted, to get the stuff, that adhears to\r\nthe insides of the Roofs, out of which they melt store of excellent Tin.)\r\n\r\n89. Whether the Metal, being brought to fusion, affords {342} any\r\nRecrements? (As _Iron-stone_ affords store of a dark Glass or Slagg) And,\r\nif it do, what those Recrements are? How they are separated from the Metal;\r\nand to what Uses they are employed?\r\n\r\n90. Whether, after the Metal has been once melted, the remaining part of\r\nthe Ore being exposed to the Air, will in tract of time be impregnated, or\r\nripen'd, so as to afford more Metal? (For, this is affirm'd to me of the\r\n_Cornish_ Tin-Ore; and what remained after the fusion of _Iron-ore_ in the\r\n_Forest of Dean_, is so rich in Metal, that a Tenant of mine in _Ireland_,\r\nthough he had on the Land, he held from me, an Iron-Mine, found it less\r\nprofit to work it, than to send cross the Sea to the _Forest of Dean_ for\r\nthis already us'd Ore, which having lain for some ages, since it was thrown\r\naside in great heaps expos'd to the Air, he affirm'd to yield as well great\r\ngreat store of Iron, as very good: though I somewhat doubt, whether this be\r\n_totally_ to be ascribed to the Aire, and length of time; or to the leaving\r\nof Metal in the Slaggs in old times, before great Furnaces were in use.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Promiscuous Inquiries about Mines, from the same Author._\r\n\r\n1. Whether the Territorie, that bears the Mine, abounds with no other Kind\r\nof Mineral in some distinct part of it? (As in _Kent_ near _Tunbridge_, one\r\npart of the Country which is Hilly, abounds all along with _Iron-Mines_;\r\nthe other, which is also Hilly, and divided from it but by a small Valley,\r\nabounds exceedingly (as the Diggers and Inhabitants told me upon the place)\r\nin _Quarry's_, which the Metallin-Country wants, but is quite destitute of\r\nIron-stone. And so at _Mendip_, in one part of the Hill, I saw store of\r\n_Lead-Mines_, containing several Kinds of Ore of that Metal; another part\r\nof the Hill I found to be full of _Cole-pits_, which had some\r\n_Marchasites_, but no Metal; and in another place, _Iron-ore_, and mixt\r\nOres, which yet they did not think fit to work.)\r\n\r\n2. Whether the Air appear to be really cold in Summer, {343} and hot in\r\nWinter at the bottom of the Mines, by surer proofs than the Testimony of\r\nour Touch?\r\n\r\n3. Whether they ever meet with places and Stones actually very hot, as\r\n_Matthesius_ relates? And whether that spring not from the quenching of\r\n_Marchasites_?\r\n\r\n4. Whether they find in the Mines any Mineral Gelly, such as the _German_\r\nNaturalists call _Ghur_? And whether in process of time it will harden into\r\na metal, or Mineral Concretion?\r\n\r\n5. What are the Laws, Constitutions, and Customs, _Oeconomical_,\r\n_Political_, _Ethical_, that are receiv'd and practis'd among the Mine-men?\r\n\r\n6. Whether the Diggers do ever really meet with any subterraneous _Demons_;\r\nand if they do, in what shape and manner they appear; what they portend;\r\nand what they do, &c?\r\n\r\n7. Whether they observe in the Trees and other Plants, growing over or neer\r\nthe Mine, not only, (as hath been already intimated) that the Leaves are\r\nany whit gilded or silver'd by the ascending Mineral Exhalations, but also,\r\nthat the Trees or other Plants are more solid and ponderous? And if they\r\nhave not also some discernable Metalline or Mineral Concretes, to be met\r\nwithin the small Cavities and Pores of their substance?\r\n\r\n8. Whether there be not Springs, and also greater Streams of Water neer the\r\nMine, that rise, and run their whole course under ground, without ever\r\nappearing above it?\r\n\r\n9. Whether the Subterraneous Springs do rise with any wind or determinate\r\nchange of weather?\r\n\r\n10. How much heavier the _Atmosphere_ is at the bottom of the Mine, than at\r\nthe top? And whether Damps considerably increase the weight of it?\r\n\r\n11. Whether they find any strange substances in the Mines, as Vessels,\r\nAnchors, Fishes inclos'd in Sparr or Metal, &c.? {344}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n__Promiscuous Inquiries_, chiefly about _Cold_, formerly sent and\r\nrecommended to Monsieur _Heuelius_; together with his Answer return'd to\r\nsome of them._\r\n\r\nA considerable piece of the grand Design of the Modern _Experimental_\r\nPhilosophers being, to procure and accumulate Materials for a good Natural\r\nHistory, whence to raise in progress of time a solid Structure of\r\nPhilosophy; all possible Endevours are used in _England_, to send abroad\r\nand recommend to as many of Forreign parts, as there is opportunity,\r\n_Directions_ for searching into the Operations of Nature, and for observing\r\nwhat occurs therein, aswell as in Mechanical operations and practices.\r\n\r\nSeveral Heads of that kind have been already publish'd for this purpose in\r\nseveral of the former Tracts; to which, as we have added, in this, the\r\n_Quæries_ about _Mines_, so we shall subjoyn those, that were not long\r\nsince committed to the care of that Excellent Promoter of Astronomy and\r\nPhilosophy, Monsieur _Heuelius_, Consul of _Dantzick_; who demonstrates so\r\nmuch zeal for the advancement of real knowledge, that he not only improves\r\nand promotes it by his own Studies, but labours also to incite others to do\r\nthe like; having already warmed many of the Northern Climate, particularly\r\n_Poland_, _Prusse_, _Livonia_, _Sweden_ and _Denmark_, into a disposition\r\nto be studious and active in inquiring after such particulars concerning\r\nPhilosophy, as are recommended from hence, and rendred them, very willing\r\nto employ themselves in things of that nature.\r\n\r\n_The Inquiries sent to _Dantzick_, are these;_\r\n\r\n1. What Signior _Burattini_ (an _Italian_ Gentleman, Master of the Mint to\r\nthe King of _Poland_, and reputed a great Master in the _Mechanicks_) hath\r\nperform'd in _Diopticks_? Whether at present he employs himself, as is\r\nrelated, in grinding a _Telescope_ of 120 foot long? And, if so, what way\r\nhe means to make use {345} of, commodiously to handle a Tube of that\r\nlength?\r\n\r\n2. Whether the same have the Art (as has been written from _Paris_) to make\r\nsuch Glass, as is not at all inferiour to _Venice_-glass, and exceeds any\r\nplate of Glass, hitherto made there, twice or thrice in bigness?\r\n\r\n3. What is the way of making Pot-ashes in _Poland_?\r\n\r\n4. What is to be observed about _Succinum_ or Amber? whether it be an\r\nExsudation of the Sea? whether it be seen to float upon the surface of the\r\nSea? whether it be soft, when 'tis first cast on shore?

Whether there be in the _Bodnick Bay_ a Whirl-pool, as is related to be\r\nin the Sea of _Norway_, which is commonly call'd the _Maal-stroom_?

Item, _Canary_ Wine; the _Lixiviums_ of Soap-boylers, and\r\nsuch as are prepared of other Salts; as also, the Spirits extracted out of\r\nSalts, as Spirit of _Vitriol_, _Nitre_, &c?\r\n\r\n13. Whether an intense and lasting Frost makes any alteration in\r\n_Quick-silver_, exposed very shallow in a flat Vessel.\r\n\r\n14. Whether the Purgative virtue of _Catharticks_ be increased or lessened,\r\nor even totally destroy'd by a strong and continued Cold? {346}\r\n\r\n15. Whether Harts-horn thaw'd, and such like substances, using the same\r\nmethod of Distilling, yield the same quantity of Liquor, which they use to\r\nyield, when not frozen?\r\n\r\n16. What Cold operates in the Fermentation of Liquors?\r\n\r\n17. Whether Birds and Wilde Beasts grow white there in Winter, and recover\r\ntheir native colour in Summer?\r\n\r\n18. Whether Colours may be concentred by a sharp cold? _E.g._ A strong\r\nDecoction of Cocheneel in a fit Glass?\r\n\r\n19. Whether the _Electrical_ virtue of _Amber_, and the _Attractive_ and\r\n_Directive_ force of the _Magnet_, be changed by a vehement Cold?\r\n\r\n20. Whether pieces of Iron and Steel, even thick ones, be made britle by\r\nintense frosts; and therefore Smiths are obliged for prevention, to give\r\ntheir Iron and Steel-tools a softer temper?\r\n\r\n21. Whether accurate Observations evince, that all Fishes dye in frozen\r\nWaters, if the Ice be not broken? Where it is to be diligently inquired\r\ninto, whether the Cold it self, or the want of changing or ventilating the\r\nwater, or the privation of Air, be the cause of the death of Fishes?\r\n\r\n22. Whether any Physicians or Anatomists have inquired, by freezing to\r\ndeath some Animals (as Rabits, Pullets, Dogs, Cats, &c.) after what manner\r\nit is, that Intense Cold kills men? whether they have found any Ice in the\r\nInner parts; and if so, in which of them; Whether in the Ventricles of the\r\nBrain and Heart; and in the greater Vessels?\r\n\r\n_These were the Queries_ recommended about a Twelve-month ago. Monsieur\r\n_Heuelius_ in a late Letter of his, accompanied with several papers from\r\nothers, returns this Accompt.\r\n\r\nThe Inquiries you proposed to me, I did impart to several of my Learned\r\nfriends: But hitherto I have attained an Answer but to few particulars.\r\nAmong the rest you'l find a Letter of the Learned _Johannes Schefferus_,\r\nProfessor in the _Swedish_ University at _Vpsall_, wherein he discourses\r\nhandsomly of several things, being ready to entertain a Literary Commerce\r\nwith you about such matters. Touching _Amber_, I am almost of the same mind\r\nwith him, that it is a kind of _Fossil Pitch_ or _Bitumen_, seeing it is\r\nnot only found on the Shore of the _Borussian_ Sea, but also digg'd up in\r\nsubterraneous places, some _German_ miles distant from the {347} and that\r\nnot only in Sandy, but also in other Hills of firmer Earth; of which I have\r\nseen my self pretty big pieces. Concerning _Swallows_, I have frequently\r\nheard Fisher-men affirm, that they have here often fish'd them out of the\r\nLakes, in the Winter; but I never have seen it my self. Whilst I am writing\r\nthis, I receive Letters out of _Denmark_, advertising me, that those two\r\nLearned men, _Thomas_ and _Erasmus Bartholin_, do intend shortly to answer\r\nthe same _Quæries_. Next Winter, if God vouchsafe me life and health, I\r\npurpose to make a Journey to _Konigs-berg_, where I hope to learn many\r\nthings, especially about _Amber_.\r\n\r\n    _Thus far in answer to those Inquiries for the present._\r\n\r\nTo this he subjoyns other things, no less fit to be communicated to the\r\nCurious, in these words;\r\n\r\nThe Books you have sent me over sea, I have not yet received: I wish, they\r\nwere all translated into Latin; for I have not _English_ enough, to\r\nunderstand all particulars perfectly. For the rest, you have obliged me, by\r\ncommunicating the Observations of the last _Eclipse_ of the _Sun_, aswell\r\nthose made in _England_, as those of _Paris_ and _Madrid_. That I may\r\nrequite you in some measure, I send you my Observations both of _that_, and\r\nthe _Moons_ last _Eclipse_. In the _Sun's Eclipse_, this is chiefly\r\nobservable, That the _Semidiameter_ of the _Moon_ from the very beginning,\r\nto about 5. or 6. digits of the increasing _Phasis_ was much less than the\r\n_Rudolphin_ Account imports. For it was then almost equal to the\r\n_Semidiameter_ of the _Sun_: but, after the greatest Obscuration, when I\r\nagain contemplated the _Moons Semidiameter_, I found it 8\" or 9\" bigger\r\nthan that of the _Sun_; so that the _Semidiameter_ of the _Moon_ was not\r\nalways, during this Eclipse, constant to it self. It will therefore be\r\nworth while, to be hereafter more diligent and curious in this particular,\r\nand accurately to observe in the _Phasis_ of each _Digit_ the _Proportion_\r\nof the _Semidiameters_ of both Luminaries; to the end, that _first_ it may\r\nbe made manifest, Whether in all the _Eclipses_ of the _Sun_, or in some\r\nonly, that variation happens; _next_, that the Causes of such a\r\n_Phænomenon_ may be diligently inquired into. Of this Variation, the\r\nExcellent _Ismael Bullialdus_ hath also observed something at _Paris_. For\r\nhe has written to me, That in the same Eclipse the _Semidiam._ of the _Sun_\r\nto the _Semid._ of the _Moon_ was, as 16'. 9\". to 16'. 22\"; but that in\r\nanother {348} _Phasis_ of 6 _digits_, the Semidiameters appear'd equal.\r\nThese my Observations, if you think them worthy, you may communicate to\r\nother Mathematicians. The last year 1665. _July_ 27. (_st. n._) the\r\n_Tables_ did also indicate an Eclipse of the _Moon_: but though the Sky\r\nhere was very cleer, yet the Moon was not at all obscured by the _true\r\nshadow_, but entred only a little into the _Penumbra_, wherein it continued\r\n50'. The beginning of its touching the _Penumbra_ did then almost happen,\r\nwhen _Aquila_ was elevated 36° 18'; which is an Example worthy to be noted.\r\nI have many Observations of the _Eclipses_ of former years by me, which I\r\ncould not yet make publick, by reason of the multitude of my business,\r\nwhich do almost over-whelm me. The Eclipse of the Moon of this Year 1666.\r\n_June_ 16. (_st. n._) was observed from a Hill neer my Garden, to the end,\r\nthat we might see both together the _Suns setting_, and the _Moon rising_.\r\nBut I was disappointed of my hopes: For very thick Exhalations, besieging\r\nthe _Horizon_, where the Moon was to rise, unto 2°. 30', hindred me from\r\nseeing the _Moon rise_, in the Article of the _setting_ of the _Sun_.\r\nWherefore the first _Phasis_ of 1. _dig_. 45'. did not appear but in the\r\n_Moons Altitude_ of 2°. 30'; when the greatest Obscuration was already\r\npast. The _End_ fell out hor. 9. 27'. about 128° from the _Zenith_\r\nWestward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * A Letter, written since from _Paris_, advertises, that some of\r\nthe Curious there have received one of these Glasses of _Sr. Burattini_,\r\nand do esteem it to be good without mentioning the Dimension of it: which\r\nyet is look'd for by the next.]\r\n\r\nI am very glad to understand, that you have so good _Telescopes_, as to\r\nmake such considerable Observations in _Jupiter_ and _Mars_, as you have\r\nlately done in _England_. I have no leasure now, by reason of the\r\nObservations of the Fixt Stars, which I now almost constantly am employ'd\r\nabout, to do any thing in the advancing of _Telescopes_. I am obliged to\r\nfinish the _Catalogue_ of the _Fixt Stars_; having mean while the\r\ncontentment to find, that many excellent persons labour about the\r\nImprovement of _Optick Glasses_. If I could get a good one of those of 60.\r\nfoot, you mention, at a reasonable rate, you would oblige me in sending me\r\none; perhaps may I be so happy, as to make likewise some good discovery or\r\nother, by the help thereof. In the mean time, let me know, I pray, the\r\nDimensions of those Glasses, and how they are to be managed. The ingenious\r\n_Burattini_ has not yet finisht his _Telescope_; as soon {349} as he hath,\r\nI shall acquaint you with it. * Before I conclude, I must give notice to\r\nthe Lovers of _Astronomy_, that on the 24. of _September_ (st. n) of this\r\nyear, I have observ'd that _New Star_ in _Pectore Cygni_ (which from the\r\nyear 1662. untill this time hath been almost altogether hid) not only with\r\nmy naked Eye, like a Star of the sixth or seventh Magnitude, but also with\r\na very great _Sextant_. It is still in the very same place of the Heavens,\r\nwhere it was formerly from _A._ 1601. to almost 1662. For, its Distance\r\nfrom _Scheat Pegasi_ hath been by me found 35°. 51'. 20\". and from\r\n_Marcab_, 43°. 10'. 50\"; which Distances (as I have found in my _Journal_)\r\nare altogether equal to those, which I observ'd _A._ 1658. the 1. of\r\n_November_. For the Distance from _Scheat_ at that time was 35°. 51'. 20\".\r\nand from _Marcab_, 43°. 10'. 25\": where that former from _Scheat_ exactly\r\nanswers to the recent; and that from _Marcab_, 'tis true, differs in a very\r\nfew _Seconds_, but that disparity is of no moment, since it only proceeded\r\nfrom thence, that this _New Star_ is not yet so distinctly to be seen, as\r\nat that time, when it was of the _third Magnitude_. It is therefore\r\ncertain, that it is the self same Star, which _Kepler_ did first see _A._\r\n1601. and continued untill _A._ 1662. But whether in time it will grow\r\nbigger and bigger, or be lost again, time will shew. He that will observe\r\nthis Star, must take care, lest he mistake those three more _Southern_\r\nones, of the _Sixth Magnitude_, and now in a manner somewhat brighter\r\n(though not extant on the _Globe_) than the _New Star_ in _Collo Cygni_.\r\nThe highest of those three, is distant from _Scheat Pegasi_ 36°. 25'. 45\";\r\nthe middlemost from the same, 37°. 25'. 20\". and the lowest, 38°. 4'. 30\".\r\nFarewell, and assure the Most Illustrious _Royal Society_ of my humblest\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n_So far Monsieur Heuelius_, whose accurate Calcul. of the _Solar Eclipses_\r\nDuration, Quantity, &c. is intended to be fully represented the next Month,\r\nsince it could not be conveniently done this time. The _annexed_ Papers\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n_One_ is from Monsieur _Joh. Schefferus_, to this purpose.\r\n\r\n1. That he is confident, the _Royal Society_ of _England_ will do much good\r\nfor the advancement of usefull Knowledge.\r\n\r\n{350}\r\n\r\n2. That he conceives _Amber_ to be a kind of _Fossil Pitch_, whole Veins\r\nlie at the bottom of the Sea; believing that it is hardned in tract of\r\ntime, and by the motion of the Sea cast on shore: _He adds_, that hitherto\r\nit hath been believed, not to be found but in _Borussia_; but he assures,\r\nthat it is also found in _Sueden_, on the shores of the Isle _Biorkóó_, in\r\nthe Lake _Melero_, whose water is _sweet_. Of this, _he saith_, he hath a\r\nfine piece by him, two inches large and thick, presented him by one, that\r\nhimself with his own hands had gathered it and several other pieces, on the\r\nshore of the said Island; affirming withall from the mouth of a Shepherd of\r\nthat place, that it is thrown out by a strong Wind, bearing upon the shore.\r\n\r\n3. That it is most certain, that _Swallows_ sink themselves towards Autumne\r\ninto Lakes, no otherwise than _Frogs_; and that many have assured him of\r\nit, who had seen them drawn out with a Net together with Fishes, and put to\r\nthe fire, and thereby revived.\r\n\r\n4. That 'tis also very true, that many _Animals_ there grow white in\r\nWinter, and recover their own Colour in Summer. That himself hath seen and\r\nhad _Hares_, which about the beginning of Winter and Spring were half\r\nwhite, and half of their native colour: that in the midst of winter he\r\nnever saw any but all white. That _Foxes_ also are white in Winter; and\r\n_Squirrels_ grayish, mixt of dark and white colour.\r\n\r\n5. That 'tis known there generally, that _Fishes_ are killed, by reason of\r\nthe Ice not being broken: but _first_, in ponds only or narrow Lakes;\r\n_next_, in such Lakes only, where the Ice is pretty thick; for, where 'tis\r\nthin, they dye not so easily. _Lastly_, that those Fishes that lie in slimy\r\nor clayie ground, dye not so soon as others. But, _he adds_, that even in\r\ngreat Lakes, when 'tis a very bitter Frost, Ice is wont to be broken,\r\neither by the force of the Waves, or of the Imprisoned Vapors, raised by\r\nthe agitation of the Water, and then bursting out with an impetuosity;\r\nwitness the noise made by the rupture of the Ice through the whole length\r\nof such Lakes, which _he affirms_ to be not less terrible than if many guns\r\nwent off together. Whereby it falls out, that Fishes are seldom found dead\r\nin great Lakes.\r\n\r\n6. That neither Oyle, nor a strong Brine of Bay-Salt, is truly {351}\r\ncongeal'd into Ice, in those parts, _Viz._ at _Upsall_ in _Sueden_.\r\n\r\n7. That the Frost pierces into the Earth, two Cubits or _Swedish_ Ells; and\r\nwhat moisture is found in it, is white, like Ice: That Waters, if standing,\r\nfreeze to a greater depth, even to three such Ells or more; but those that\r\nhave a Current, less: That rapid Rivers freeze not at all; nor ever-bubling\r\nSprings; and that these latter seem even to be warmer in Winter, than\r\nSummer.\r\n\r\n_So far this Observer_; who likewise offers his Services in giving an\r\nanswer to the remaining _Queries_, and in entertaining a commerce in such\r\nother Philosophical matters, as he is conversant in.\r\n\r\n_Another_ Paper written by Monsieur _Febre_, chief Secretary to Prince\r\n_Ratzivil_, contains these particulars;\r\n\r\n1. That the College of the Learned in _Borussia_, finds it not so easie to\r\nresolve all those _Queries_ sent from _England_ to M. _Heuelius:_ but yet\r\nthat they will try what may be done upon it.\r\n\r\n2. That as for himself, he can assure from his own Experience concerning\r\nthe Effects of Cold; _First_, That in the War against the _Muscovites_ and\r\n_Cosacks_, _A._ 1655. in _January_, in _White Russia_, at the Siege of\r\n_Biskow_, 30. Leagues from _Smolensko_, and three from _Morhilo_, near the\r\nRiver _Boristhenes_, when they had Quarter in a Village call'd _Bikau_,\r\nthey were seized on with such a Frost, that all their Provisions of\r\n_Spanish_ Wines or _Petersimen_, and _Beere_, were in one Night frozen upon\r\nthe Sleds, notwithstanding they were cover'd with Straw; in so much, that\r\nwhen next morning they would have drawn of those Liquors, they found all\r\ndry, and were constrain'd to carry them into a Stove, to thaw them; which\r\nthey could not do in two whole days, and were obliged to break the Vessels,\r\nand put pieces of the Icy Wine into Kettles to thaw them over the Fire, for\r\nDrink: That they asked not for a Draught, but a _Morsel_ of Wine or Beer:\r\nThat their Horses had no better cheer than themselves, as to matter of\r\nDrink; the Pond of the Village being so thoroughly frozen, that there was\r\nbut very little Water left between the Ice and the bottom of the Pool;\r\nwhereby the poor Beasts were forced to drink with great reverence, kneeling\r\non the forefeet to thrust their heads into the holes, made for them in the\r\nIce, and to suck thence some drops of Water; and that, if they had not had\r\nSnow to eat, there would have dyed a far greater {352} number of them, than\r\nthere did. Moreover, that he observed, that the _Hungarian Wine_, of which\r\nthey had a Tun, resisted the Cold better, than the _Peter Simen_; for it\r\nwas not so much frozen; unless it be, that the Butler had more care of\r\nthat, than the rest, by transporting it sooner into the Stove, when he\r\nfound the excess of Cold. Again, that one presenting him in the March with\r\nsome _Aqua-vitæ_, the Scrue of the Flagon, put to his Mouth, stuck so close\r\nto his Lips, that he could not draw it off, without drawing bloud,\r\n\r\nIn a _third_ Paper, I find these particulars from the same M. _Febre_.\r\n\r\n1. That a considerable person, one Dr. _Becker_, a great Lover of Curious\r\nInquiries, has given him hopes to entertain this Philosophical Commerce.\r\n\r\n2. That he hath seen men dye in _Poland_ and _Lithuania_ both of _Heat_ and\r\n_Cold_. And _first_, that _A._ 1653. in _July_, being with this present\r\nKing of _Poland_ in march from _Leopoli_ to the Camp of _Glignani_, it was\r\nso furiously hot that day of their march, that it caused such an alteration\r\nin that Regiment of Foot, which was the Kings Guard, marching most of them\r\nbare-foot upon Sands, that more than an hundred of them fell down\r\naltogether disabled, whereof a dozen dyed out-right, without any other\r\nSickness. _Secondly_, as to the Cold, that the frost was so bitter, that 3\r\nSouldiers dyed of it, _A._ 1665. the 2. of _January_, in passing a long\r\nDitch: besides, that divers persons lost some of their Lims.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Success of the Experiment of Transfusing the Bloud of one Animal into\r\nanother._\r\n\r\nThis experiment, hitherto look'd upon to be of an almost unsurmountable\r\ndifficulty, hath been of late very successfully perform'd not only at\r\n_Oxford_, by the directions of that expert Anatomist Dr. _Lower_, but also\r\nin _London_, by order of the _R.

It was first\r\npracticed by Dr. _Lower_ in _Oxford_, and by him communicated to the\r\nHonourable _Robert Boyl_, who imparted it to the _Royal Society_, as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\nFirst, Take up the _Carotidal_ Artery of the Dog or other Animal, whose\r\nBloud is to be transfused into another of the {354} same or a different\r\nkind, and separate it from the Nerve of the _Eighth pair_, and lay it bare\r\nabove an inch. Then make a strong Ligature on the _upper_ part of the\r\nArterie, not to be untied again: but an inch below, _videl._ towards the\r\nHeart, make another Ligature of a _running_ knot, which may be loosen'd or\r\nfastned as there shall be occasion. Having made these two knots, draw two\r\nthreds under the Artery between the Ligatures; and then open the Artery,\r\nand put in a Quil, and tie the Artery upon the Quill very fast by those two\r\nthreds, and stop the Quill with a stick. After this, make bare the\r\n_Jugular_ Vein in the other Dog about an inch and a half long; and at each\r\nend make a Ligature with a running knot, and in the space betwixt the two\r\nrunning knots drawn under the Vein two threds, as in the other: then make\r\nan Incision in the Vein, and put into it two Quills, one into the\r\n_descendent_ part of the Vein, to receive the bloud from the other Dog and\r\ncarry it to the Heart; and the other Quill put into the other part of the\r\n_Jugular_ Vein, which comes from the Head (out of which, the second Dogs\r\nown bloud must run into Dishes.) These two Quills being put in and tied\r\nfast, stop them with a stick, till there be occasion to open them.\r\n\r\nAll things being thus prepar'd, the Dogs on their sides towards one another\r\nso conveniently, that the Quill may go into each other, (for the Dogs necks\r\ncannot be brought so near, but that you must put two or three several\r\nQuills more into the first two, to convey the bloud from one to another.)\r\nAfter that unstop the Quill that goes down into the first Dog's _Jugular_\r\nVein, and the other Quill coming out of the other Dog's Artery; and by the\r\nhelp of two or three other Quills, put into each other, according as there\r\nshall be occasion, insert them into one another. Then flip the running\r\nknots, and immediatly the bloud runs through the Quills, as through an\r\nArtery, very impetuosly. And immediately, as the bloud runs into the Dog,\r\nunstop the other Quill, coming out of the _upper_ part of his _Jugular_\r\nVein (a Ligature being first made about his Neck, or else his other\r\n_Jugular_ Vein being compress'd by ones Finger;) and let his own bloud run\r\nout at the same time into Dishes (yet not constantly, but according as you\r\nperceive him able to bear it) {355} till the other Dog begin to cry, and\r\nfaint, and fall into Convulsions, and at last dye by his side.\r\n\r\nThen take out both the Quills out of the Dogs _Jugular_ Vein, and tye the\r\nrunning knot fast, and cut the Vein asunder, (which you may doe without any\r\nharm to the Dog, one _Jugular_ Vein being sufficient to convey all the\r\nbloud from the Head and upper parts, by reason of a large _Anatomosis_,\r\nwhereby both the _Jugular_ Veins meet about the _Larinx_.) This done, sow\r\nup the skin and dis-miss him, and the Dog will leap from the Table and\r\nshake himself and run away, as if nothing ailed him.\r\n\r\nAnd this I have tryed several times, before several in the _Universities_,\r\nbut never yet upon more than one Dog at a time, for want of leisure, and\r\nconvenient supplyes of several Dogs at once. But when I return, I doubt not\r\nbut to give you a fuller account, not only by bleeding several Dogs into\r\none, but several other creatures into one another, as you did propose to\r\nme, before you left _Oxford_; which will be very easie to perform; and will\r\nafford many pleasant and perhaps not unuseful Experiments.\r\n\r\nBut because there are many Circumstances necessary to be observ'd in the\r\nperforming of this Experiment, and that you may better direct any one to\r\ndoe it, without any danger of killing the other Dog, that is to receive the\r\nothers bloud, I will mention two or three.\r\n\r\n_First_, that you fasten the Dogs at such a convenient distance, that the\r\nVein nor Artery be not stretched; for then, being contracted, they will not\r\nadmit or convey so much bloud.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, that you constantly observe the Pulse beyond the Quill in the\r\nDogs _Jugular_ Vein (which it acquires from the impulse of the _Arterious_\r\nbloud:) For if that fails, then 'tis a sign the Quil is stopt by some\r\ncongealed bloud, so that you must draw out the _Arterial_ Quill from the\r\nother, and with a _Probe_ open the passage again in both of them, that the\r\nbloud may have its free course again. For, this must be expected, when the\r\nDog, that bleeds into the other, hath lost much bloud, his heart will beat\r\nvery faintly, and then the impulse {356} of bloud being weaker, it will be\r\napt to congeal the sooner, so that at the latter end of the work you must\r\ndraw out the Quill ofter, and clear the passage; if the Dog be\r\nfaint-hearted, as many are, though some stout fierce Dogs will bleed freely\r\nand uninterruptedly, till they are convuls'd and dye. But to prevent this\r\ntrouble, and make the experiment certain, you must bleed a great Dog into a\r\nlittle one, or a _Mastive_ into a _Curr_, as I once try'd, and the little\r\nDog bled out at least double the quantity of his own bloud, and left the\r\n_Mastive_ dead upon the Table, and after he was untyed, he ran away and\r\nshak'd himself, as if he had been only thrown into water. Or else you may\r\nget three or four several Dogs prepared in the same manner; and when one\r\nbegins to fail and leave off bleeding, administer another, and I am\r\nconfident one Dog will receive all their bloud, (and perhaps more) as long\r\nas it runs freely, till they are left almost dead by turns: provided that\r\nyou let out the bloud proportionably, as you let it goe into the Dog, that\r\nis to live.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, I suppose the Dog that is to bleed out into dishes will endure\r\nit the better, if the Dogs that are to be administred to supply his bloud,\r\nbe of near an equal age, and fed alike the day before, that both their\r\nblouds may be of a neer strength and temper.\r\n\r\nThere are many things I have observed upon bleeding Dogs to death, which I\r\nhave seen since your departure from _Oxford_, whereof I shall give you a\r\nrelation hereafter; in the mean time since you were pleased to mention it\r\nto the _Royal Society_, with a promise to give them an account of this\r\nexperiment, I could not but take the first opportunity to clear you from\r\nthat obligation, &c.\r\n\r\n_So far this Letter;_ the prescriptions whereof having been carefully\r\nobserv'd by those who were imployed to make the Experiment, have hitherto\r\nbeen attended with good success; and that not only upon Animals of the same\r\n_Species_ (as two Dogs first, and then two Sheep) but also upon some of\r\nvery differing _Species_ (as a Sheep and a Dog; the former _Emitting_, the\r\nother _Receiving_)\r\n\r\n_Note_ only, that instead of a Quill, a small crooked thin {357} Pipe of\r\nSilver or Brass, so slender that the one end may enter into a Quill, and\r\nhaving at the other end, that is to enter into the Vein and Arterie, a\r\nsmall knob, for the better fastening them to it with a thread, will be much\r\nfitter than a strait Pipe or Quill, for this Operation: for so they are\r\nmuch more easie to be managed.\r\n\r\n'Tis intended, that these tryals shall be prosecuted to the utmost variety\r\nthe subject will bear: As by exchanging the bloud of Old and Young, Sick\r\nand Healthy, Hot and Cold, Fierce and Fearful, Lame and Wild Animals, &c.,\r\nand, that not only the same, but also of differing kinds. For which end,\r\nand to improve this noble Experiment, either for knowledge, or use, or\r\nboth, some Ingenious men have already proposed considerable tryals and\r\nInquiries; of which perhaps an account will be given hereafter. For the\r\npresent we shall only subjoyn some.\r\n\r\n_Considerations about this kind of Experiments._\r\n\r\n1. It may be consider'd in them, that the bloud of the _Emittent_ Animal,\r\nmay after a few minuts of time, by its circulation, mix and run out with\r\nthat of the _Recipient_. Wherefore to be assured in these Tryals, that all\r\nthe bloud of the _Recipient_ is run out, and none left in him but the\r\nadventitious bloud of the _Emittent_, two or three or more Animals (which\r\nwas also hinted in the _method_ above) may be prepared and administred, to\r\nbleed them all out into one.\r\n\r\n2. It seems not irrational to guess afore hand, that the exchange of bloud\r\nwill not alter the nature or disposition of the Animals, upon which it\r\nshall be practised; though it may be thought worth while for satisfaction\r\nand certainty, to determine that point by Experiments. The case of\r\nexchanging the bloud of Animals seems not like that of _Graffing_, where\r\nthe _Cyons_ turns the Sap of the _Stock_, graffed upon, into its nature;\r\nthe _Fibres_ of the Cyons so straining the juice, which passes from the\r\nstem to it, as thereby to change it into that of the Cyons, whereas in this\r\ntransfusion there seems to be no such {358} Percolation of the bloud of\r\nAnimals, whereby that of the one should be changed into the nature of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. The most probable use of this Experiment may be conjectured to be that\r\none Animal may live with the bloud of another; and consequently, that those\r\nAnimals, that want bloud, or have corrupt bloud, may be supplyed from other\r\nwith a sufficient quantity, and of such as is good, provided the\r\nTransfusion be often repeated, by reason of the quick expence that is made\r\nof the bloud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNote.\r\n\r\n_In the last _Transactions_ was also promised an Accompt by the next, of\r\nMonsieur _Hevelius_ his accurate Calcul. of the late _Solar Eclipses_,\r\nDuration, Quantity, &c. But this being to be accompanyed with _Scheme_, the\r\n_Graving_ whereof met with a disappointment, it must be still referred to\r\nanother Opportunity._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Accompt of some Sanative-waters in _Herefordshire_._\r\n\r\nThis account was communicated by Dr. _B._ in these words.\r\n\r\nThere are two Springs in _Herefordshire_, whereof one is within a Bolt, or\r\nat least Bow-shoot of the top of the near adjoyning loftie Hill of\r\n_Malvern_, and at great distance from the Foot of the Hill; and hath had a\r\nlong and old fame for healing of eyes. When I was for some years molested\r\nwith Tetters on the back of one and sometimes of both my hands,\r\nnotwithstanding all endeavors of my very friendly and skilful Physitians I\r\nhad speedy healing from a neighbouring Spring of far less fame. Yet this\r\nSpring healed very old and Ulcerous sores on the Legs of a poor Fellow,\r\nwhich had been poyson'd by Irons in the Gaol, after other Chirurgery had\r\nbeen hopeless. And by many tryals upon my hands, and the Tetters; I was\r\nperswaded, that in long droughts, and lasting dry Frosts, those waters were\r\nmore effectually and more speedily healing, than at other times. And not to\r\nomit this circumstance, I did hold this water in my mouth, till it was\r\nwarm, perchance somewhat intermingled with fasting Spittle, {359} and so\r\ndropping it upon the Tetter, I there could see it immediately gather a very\r\nthin skin upon the raw flesh, not unlike that which is seen to gather upon\r\nMilk over a gentle fire. This skin would have small holes in it, through\r\nwhich a moisture did issue in small drops, which being wip'd away, and the\r\nwater continued to be dropp'd warm out of the mouth, the holes would\r\ndiminish, and at last be all quite healed up.\r\n\r\nFor the _Eye-waters_, I conceived them more strongly tersive, and clearing\r\nthe Eyes; and they had a rough smartness, as if they carryed Sand or Gravel\r\ninto the Eye.\r\n\r\nI have known and try'd three or four healing Fountains of late discovery,\r\nor of no old fame that I could hear of.\r\n\r\nI did once put rich _Marle_ for some days in a vessel of water, to try\r\nwhether the water would acquire a healing vertue, but my Experiments were\r\ninterrupted. I had in my thoughts many other ways of Tryal; which I may\r\nresume hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A farther Accompt of the _Vitriolate-water_, mention'd _Num. 18 p. 323_.\r\nTogether with some other particulars touching waters._\r\n\r\nThis comes from the same hand as follows;\r\n\r\nI formerly mentioned to you, that, if that Pool of Mr. _Phillip's_, which\r\nseems to be of Vitriolate-water, were on my ground, I would drain it, and\r\nsearch the head of the Spring, pursuing the source, till I could well\r\ndiscern, through what lay of Earth or Gravel it does pass. Now I shall tell\r\nyou, that I have taken order for the further tryal of the said Water, by\r\nboiling a greater quantity in a Furnace, &c. But just as we were in\r\nreadiness for the tryal, a stream of Rain-water fell into the Pool, and so\r\ndiscourag'd us for the present. I have also taken a course to turn the\r\nfalling Waters aside, and to drain the Pool, that we may see, what the\r\nNative Springs (whether one or more) may be. Of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\nI wish (_so he goes on_) we had a full Accompt of our _Salt-Springs_ at\r\n_Droyt-wych_ near _Worcester_, and at _Nant-wych_ in _Cheshire_ (what other\r\nSalt-Springs we have in _England_, I know not:) {360} It should be\r\ninquired, at what distance they are from the Seas, or from Salt-fluxes,\r\nfrom Hills, and how deep in the Vales? What the weight? Whether in droughts\r\nor long Frosts the proportion of Salt or weight increaseth? Whether the\r\nEarth near the Springs, or in their passage hath any peculiar ferment, or\r\nproduceth a blackishness, if it rests, after it is well drained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Inquiries for _Turky_._\r\n\r\nThough many Relations and Descriptions of _Turky_ be extant in Print, yet\r\nthey leave in many a desire of a fuller information in the following\r\nparticulars, lately drawn up, for the most part by Mr. _H._ and recommended\r\nto an Ingenious Gentleman, bound for that Country; and desired also to be\r\ntaken notice of by others, that may have occasion to visit the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * _Rusma_ is a kind of Earth, used in _Turky_ to take away\r\nhair.]\r\n\r\n1.

Journal des Scavans_ extracts it, _vid._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * It may be queried whether those were true Veins, or only\r\nSuperficial Strictures, and slight scratches.]\r\n\r\nThough it be commonly believed, that _Rock-Christal_ is not fit for\r\nOptick-Glasses, because there are many Veins in it; yet _Eustachio Divini_\r\nmade one of it, which _he saith_ proved an excellent one, though full of\r\nVeins. *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Accompt of the Use of the Grain of _Kermes_ for Coloration._\r\n\r\nThis was communicated by the Ingenious Dr. _Croon_, as he received it from\r\none Monsieur _Verny_, a _French_ Apothecary at _Montpelier_; who having\r\ndescribed the Grain of _Kermes_, to be an excrescence growing upon the\r\nWood, and often upon the {363} leaves of a Shrub, plentifull in\r\n_Languedock_, and gather'd in the end of _May_, and the beginning of\r\n_June_, full of a red Juyce; subjoyns two Uses, which that Grain hath, the\r\none for _Medicine_, the other for _Dying of Wool_. Waving the _first_,\r\nnotice shall only be taken here of the _latter_, vid. That, for _Dying_,\r\nthey take the Grain of _Kermes_, when ripe, and spread it upon Linnen: And\r\nat first, whilst it abounds most in moisture, 'tis turn'd twice or thrice a\r\nday, to prevent its Heating. And when there appears red powder amongst it,\r\nthey separate it, passing it through a Searce; and then again spread abroad\r\nthe Grain upon Linnen, untill there be perceived the same redness of the\r\npowder; and at the end, this red power appears _about_ and _on_ the surface\r\nof the Grain, which is still to be pass'd through a Searce, till it render\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nAnd in the beginning, when the small red Grains are seen to move (as they\r\nwill do) they are sprinkled over with strong Vinegar, and rubb'd between\r\nones hands: afterwards little balls are form'd thereof, which are expos'd\r\nto the Sun to dry.\r\n\r\nIf this red powder should be let alone, without pouring Vinegar or some\r\nother accid liquor upon it, out of every Grain thereof would be form'd a\r\nlittle Fly, which would skip and fly up and down for a day or two, and at\r\nlast changing its colour, fall down quite dead, deprived of all the\r\nbitterness, the Grains, whence they are generated, had before.\r\n\r\nThe Grain being altogether emptyed of its pulp or red powder, 'tis wash'd\r\nin Wine, and then expos'd to the Sun Being well dryed, 'tis rubb'd in a\r\nSack to render it bright; and then 'tis put up in small Sacks, putting in\r\nthe midst, according to the quantity, the Grain has afforded, 10. or 12.\r\npounds (for a _Quintal_) of the dust, which is the red powder, that came\r\nout of it. And accordingly, as the Grain affords more or less of the said\r\npowder, Dyers buy more or less of it.\r\n\r\n'Tis to be noted, That the first red powder, which appears, issues out of\r\nthe Hole of the Grain, that is on the side, where the Grain adhered to the\r\nPlant. And that, which about the end appears sticking on the Grain, hath\r\nbeen alive in the husk, having pierced its covers though the hole, whence\r\nit commonly issues, remains close as to the Eye. {364}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of Some Books lately published._\r\n\r\n1. _PINAX Rerum Naturalium BRITANNICARUM, continens VEGETABILIA, ANIMALIA &\r\nFOSSILIA in hoc Insula reperta, inchoatus, Auth._ Christophoro Merret,\r\n_Med. D. & utriusque_ Societatis Regiæ _socio._\r\n\r\nThe Learned and Inquisitive Author of this Book, hath by his laudable\r\nexample of collecting together, what Natural things are to be found here in\r\n_England_, of all sorts (which he has done upon his own expences) given an\r\ninvitation to the curious in all parts of the world to attempt the like,\r\nthereby to establish the much desired and highly useful commerce among\r\n_Naturalists_, and to contribute every where to the composing of a genuine\r\nand full _History of Nature_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Preface_ he intimates, that his stock does still encrease dayly;\r\nand that therefore the Reader may expect an _Appendix_ to this collection.\r\n\r\nIn the Body of the Book, he enumerates all the _Species_, Alphabetically:\r\nAnd, as to _Vegetables_, he reckons up about 410 sorts; and gives their\r\n_Latine_ and _English_ Names, and the _Places_ and _Times_ of their growth:\r\nreducing them afterwards to certain _Classes_, hitherto used by _Botanick_\r\nWriters in their _Histories_ of _Plants_: Adding the _Etymology_ of their\r\nGenerick Names, and a compendious _Register_ of the Time, _when_ and _how\r\nlong_ the _English_ Plants do shoot and flourish.\r\n\r\nAs to _Animals_, he finds of them about 340 kinds in _England_, whereof the\r\n_fourfooted_ are about 50, _Birds_ 170, and _Fishes_ 120. _Insects_ are\r\ninnumerable, which yet he endeavours to enumerate, and to reduce to certain\r\n_Classes_; into which he also brings the three former kinds.\r\n\r\nConcerning _Fossils_, he _first_ takes notice of the _Metals_ found in\r\n_English_ Mines; as _Silver, Tin, Copper, Iron, Lead, Antimony_, and some\r\n_Gold_ extracted out of _Tin_. Next of the _Stones_, of which he finds\r\nabout 70 sorts; & amongst them, _Bristol Diamonds, Agates, Hyacinths,\r\nEmerods, Loadstones, Toad-stones_, (which last yet he affirms to be nothing\r\nbut the grinding-teeth of the {365} Fish _Lupus_) _Pearls, Corals, Marble,\r\nAlablaster, Emery:_ To which he adds the various kinds of _Coals_; as also\r\n_Bitumens, Turfs_ and _Jets_. And _thirdly_ of the various kinds of _Allam,\r\nVitriol, Niter, Sea-salt, Pit-salt_. But _fourthly_ of the various\r\n_Earths_, of which he reckons up 15. peculiar sorts (besides those that\r\nserve for _Husbandry_, which are not easily numbred;) and amongst them,\r\n_Read-lead, Black-lead_ and _Fullers-earth_.\r\n\r\nHe concludes all with mentioning the several _Meteors_ appearing in\r\n_England_; and the _Hot springs_; and _Medical Waters_; as also, the\r\n_Salin, Petrifying_, and some more unusual Springs: _Item, Subterraneous\r\nTrees, Subterraneous Rivers, Ebbings and Flowings of Wells_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _PLACITA PHILOSOPHICA Guarini._ The chief subject of this Treatise is\r\nNatural _Philosophy_; upon many important questions whereof it enlargeth,\r\nas those of the Motion of the Coelestial Bodies, of Light, of Meteors, and\r\nof the vital and animal functions; leaving sometimes the common opinions,\r\nand delighting in the defence of _Paradoxes_.\r\n\r\n_E. G._ That the material substantial Form, is nothing but _mera potentia_,\r\nand subsists not by it self: by which means the Author judges, he can free\r\nhimself from many great difficulties touching _Generation_ and\r\n_Corruption_, which do perplex the other Philosophers.\r\n\r\nHe holds _Epicycles_ to be impossible, and _Excentricks_, not sufficient to\r\nexplicate the motion of the Stars; but that all the irregularities of this\r\nmotion may be salved by the means of certain _Spiral_ Lines; largely\r\nproving this _Hypothesis_, and particularly explicating the motion of each\r\nPlanet.\r\n\r\nHe denies the middle Region of the Air to be cold; and believes that cold\r\nis not necessary to condense the vapours into Water.\r\n\r\nHe admits not that received Axiome, _That the generation of one Body is the\r\ncorruption of another_; maintaining that there are _Generations_, to which\r\nno corruption ever preceded; and that it may happen, that one Animal\r\nwithout dying may be changed into another Animal.\r\n\r\nHe alledges several reasons to evince, that the Air breathed in, enters not\r\nonly into the whole capacity of the Chest, but also into the lower belly.\r\n{366}\r\n\r\nHe is of opinion that the Air, which is commonly believed to corrupt\r\neasily, is incorruptible; alledging among other reasons, this for one, that\r\nexperience shews, that if a Bottle be exactly stop'd, there is never any\r\nmixt Body form'd in it; wherefore, _saith he_, the Air is not corrupted\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe maintains, that 'tis not the _Magnet_ that draws the Iron, but rather\r\nthe Iron that attracts the _Magnet_. To explain which he affirms, that the\r\nLoad-stone spreads abroad out of it self many corpuscles, which the\r\nsubstance of the Iron imbibes, and that, as dry things attract those that\r\nare moist, by the same reason Iron drawn the Loadstone.\r\n\r\nHe rejects the _species intentionales_, _Vital_ and _Animal_ Spirits, and\r\nholds many other uncommon opinions, touching _Light_, the _Iris_, the _Flux\r\nand Reflux of the Sea_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _GUSTUS ORGANUM per _Laurentium Bellini_ novissimè deprehensum._\r\n\r\nThe Author proposing to himself to discover both the principal _Organ_ of\r\nthe _Taste_, and the nature of its _object_, begins with the latter, and\r\nexamins first, what is _Taste?_ He judges that it is caused by nothing but\r\nSalts, which being variously figured, affects the tongue variously:\r\nalledging this for his chief reason, that the Salt which is extracted by\r\n_Chymists_ out of any mixt body whatever it be, carries away with it all\r\nits taste, and that the rest remains tasteless. He adds that the Teeth in\r\ngrinding the Food, serve much to extract this Salt: And he notes by the by,\r\nthat the Teeth are so necessary for preparing the aliment, that certain\r\nAnimals which seem to have none, have them in their stomach; and that\r\nnature has put at the entry of the palat of those that are altogether\r\ndestitute of them, certain moveable inequalities, which are to them instead\r\nof Teeth.\r\n\r\nBut then _secondly_, concerning the _Organ_ of Taste, he esteems, that 'tis\r\nneither the Flesh, nor the Tongue, nor the Membrans, nor the Nerves found\r\nthere, nor the Glanduls, called _Amygdalinæ_; but those _little eminences_\r\nthat are found upon the tongue of all Animals. To obtain which, he\r\nobserves,\r\n\r\n1. That from the middle of the Tongue to the root, as also towards the tip,\r\nthere are found innumerable _little Risings_ {367} called _Papillares_; but\r\nthat from the tip of the Tongue unto the string there is observed none at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n2. He hath experimented, that if you put _Sal Armoniack_ upon the places of\r\nthe Tongue, where those _Eminencies_ are not, you shall find no Taste; but\r\nthat you will find it presently assoon as you put any such Salt, where they\r\nare to be met with. Ergo, _saith he_, those _Eminencies_ are the principal\r\nOrgan of Taste.\r\n\r\n3. He assures, that with a _Microscope_, may be seen in those _Risings_\r\nmany little holes, at the bottom whereof there are small nerves,\r\nterminating there: But _he directs_, to observe this in live and healthy,\r\nnot in dead or sick Animals.\r\n\r\nHaving laid down these Observations, he concludes, that the manner, after\r\nwhich Taste is perform'd, is this, That the particles of Salt passing\r\nthrough those pores, which pierce the _Papillary Eminences_, and\r\npenetrating as far as to the nerves, that meet them there, do by the means\r\nof their small points prick them; which pricking is called the _Taste_.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he acknowledges, that before him Signior _Malphigi_,\r\nProfessor at _Messina_, had made some of these discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe notice of these two last Books we owe to the _French Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correct in Number._ 19.\r\n\r\nPage, 342. line, 33. read _mixt Ores_, in stead of, _mixt with Ores_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _John Martin_, Printer to the _Royal Society_, and\r\nare to be sold at the _Bell_ a little without _Temple-Bar_.\r\n\r\n{369}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numb._ 21.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL\r\n_TRANSACTIONS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Munday_, _January_ 21. 1666.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Contents.\r\n\r\n    _An Account, formerly promised, of Monsieur _Hevelius's_ Calculation of\r\n    the late _Solar Eclipse's_ Quantity, Duration, &c.

The _Figure_ of that _Constellation_, with the _New\r\nStar_ in it, was thus, hastily drawn, sent over by that Observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{373}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Extract of a Letter written _Decemb. 28. 1666_. by M. _Auzout_ to the\r\nPublisher, concerning a way of his, for taking the _Diameters_ of the\r\n_Planets_, and for knowing the _Parallax_ of the _Moon_; as also the\r\nReason, why in the _Solar Eclipse_ above calculated, the _Diameter_ of the\r\n_Moon_ did increase about the end._\r\n\r\nI did apply my self the last Summer to the taking of the _Diameters_ of the\r\nSun, Moon, and the other Planets, by a Method, which one M. _Picard_ and my\r\nself have, esteem'd by Us the best of all those, that have been practis'd\r\nhitherto; since we can take the _Diameters_ to _Second Minutes_, being able\r\nto divide one foot into 24000. or 30000. parts, scarce failing as much as\r\nin one only part, so as we can in a manner be _assur'd_, not to deceive our\r\nselves in 3. or 4. _seconds_. I shall not now tell you my Observations, but\r\nI may very well assure you, that the _Diameter_ of the _Sun_ has not been\r\nmuch less in his _Apogee_, than 31. m. 37. or 40. sec. and certainly not\r\nlesse than 31. m. 35. sec. and that at present in his _Perigee_ it passes\r\nnot 32. m. 45. sec. and may be lesse by a second or two. That, which is at\r\nthe present troublesome, is, that the _Vertical_ Diameter, which is the\r\nmost easie to take, is diminisht, even at _Noon_, by 8. or 9. sec., because\r\nof the _Refractions_, which are much greater in Winter than Summer at the\r\nsame height; and that the _Horizontal_ Diameter is difficult, because of\r\nthe swift motion of the Heavens.\r\n\r\nAs for the _Moon_, I never yet found her Diameter less than 29. m. 44. or\r\n45. sec. and I have not seen it pass 33. m. or if it hath, it was only by a\r\nfew _seconds_. But I have not yet taken her in all the kinds of situations\r\nof the _Apogees_ and _Perigees_ which happen, with the _Conjunctions_ and\r\n_Quadratures_. I do not mention all, what can be deduced from thence, but\r\nif you have Persons at _London_, that observe these _Diameters_, we may\r\nentertain our selves more about this Subject, another time. I shall only\r\ntell you, that I have found a Way to know the _Parallax_ of the _Moon_, by\r\nthe means of her _Diameter_: _Vid_. If on a day, when she is to be in her\r\n_Apogee_ or _Perigee_, and in the most _Boreal_ Signes, you take her\r\nDiameter towards the _Horizon_, and then towards the _South_, with her\r\n_Altitudes_ {374} above the Horizon. For, if the Observation of the\r\nDiameters be exact; as in these Situations the Moon changes not\r\nconsiderably her Distance from the Earth in 6. or 7. hours, the\r\n_Difference_ of the Diameters will shew the Proportion there is of her\r\nDistance, with the Semi-diameter of the Earth. I do not enlarge, because\r\nthat as soon as one hath this _Idea_, the rest is easie. The same would yet\r\nbe practis'd better in the places, where the Moon passes through the\r\n_Zenith_, than here, for the greater the difference is of the Heights, the\r\ngreater is that of the Diameters. I do not note (for it easily appears)\r\nthat, if one were under the same _Meridian_, or the same _Azimuth_ in two\r\nvery different places, and took at the same time the Diameter of the Moon,\r\none would do the same thing, though this Method goes not to preciseness.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, may be collected the reason of the Observation,\r\nwhich M. _Hevelius_ made in the last _Eclipse of the Sun_, touching the\r\nincrease of the Moon's Diameter about the end. I am exceeding glad, that a\r\nperson, who probably knew not the cause of it, has made the Experiment: but\r\nit is strange, that until now no Astronomer has foreseen, that that should\r\nhappen, nor given any precepts for the Change of the _Moons Diameter_ in\r\nthe _Eclipses of the Sun_, according to the places, where they should\r\nhappen, and according to the Hour and Height, the Moon should have. For,\r\nwhat hapned in that _Eclipse_ of Augmentation, would have faln out\r\ncontrarily, if it had been in the Evening; for, the Moon, which in that\r\n_Eclipse_, that began in the Morning, was higher about the end than at the\r\nbeginning, was nearer us, and consequently was to appear bigger: But if the\r\n_Eclipse_ should happen in the Evening, she would be lower at the end, and\r\ntherefore more distant from us, and consequently appear lesser. So also in\r\ntwo different places, whereof one should have the Eclipse in the Morning,\r\nand the other at Noon, the Moon should appear bigger to him that hath it at\r\nNoon: And she must likewise appear bigger to those, who shall have a leser\r\n_Elevation_ of the _Pole_ under the same _Meridian_, because the Moon will\r\nbe nearer them.\r\n\r\nI wish, I could satisfie you about the _Optick Glasses_ of Signior\r\n_Burattini_ in _Poland_, which he hath sent hither; but I have not yet seen\r\ntheir performances my self. I only saw once the Glasses, {375} which are\r\nperfectly well wrought and well polisht. Those, that have tried them, find\r\nthem very good; but they are only, the one of 10, the other of 8. foot. A\r\ngood Astronomer told me, that they would bear a great _Aperture_ in respect\r\nof their length.\r\n\r\nI do not well know, what to say to yours concerning M. _Hevelius_. Mean\r\nwhile, the interest of truth, and the obliging manner, he has treated me\r\nwith, engage me to answer him, in the matter of the _Comets_: I am\r\nperswaded, I shall convince him; but since he hath taken the _Illustrious\r\nRoyal Society_ for Judge, I accept that with all my heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of the loss of the Way to prepare the _Bononian Stone_ for\r\nshining._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * It is hoped notwithstanding (which also a late Letter from\r\nabroad does hint) that some or other of the _Italian_ Vertuosi at\r\n_Florence_ have secured this Secret.]\r\n\r\nThough several Persons have pretended to know the Art of preparing and\r\ncalcining the _Bononian_ Stone, for keeping a while the Light once imbibed;\r\nyet there hath been indeed but one, who had the true secret of performing\r\nit. This was an _Ecclesiastick_, who is now dead, without having left that\r\nskill of his to any one, as Letters from _Italy_ and _France_, some while\r\nsince, did inform. There is no substance, in Nature, known to us, that hath\r\nthe effect of this Stone; so that (to the shame of the present Age) this\r\n_Phænomenon_ is not like to be found any where, but in Books, except some\r\nhappy _Genius_ light upon same or the like skill. *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Description of a _Swedish_ Stone, which affords _Sulphur_, _Vitriol_,\r\n_Allum_ and _Minium_._\r\n\r\nThis was communicated to the _R. Society_ by Sir _Gilbert Talbot_ Knight, a\r\nWorthy Member of that Body, as he had received it in _Denmark_, being his\r\nMajesties Extraordinary Envoy there; as follows,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is a Stone in _Sweden_ of a Yellow Colour, intermixed with streaks of\r\nwhite (as if composed of Gold and Silver) and heavy withal. It is found in\r\nfirm Rocks, and runs in Veins, {376} upon which they lay Wood, and set it\r\non fire. When the Stone is thus heated, they cast Water upon it, to make it\r\nrend, and then dig it up with Mattocks. This done, they break it into\r\nsmaller pieces; and put it into Iron-pots, of the shape represented by\r\n_Figure_ C; the mouth of the one going into the other. These they place,\r\nthe _one_ in the Oven upon an Iron fork sloping, so that, the Stone being\r\nmelted, it may run into the _other_, which stands at the mouth of the Oven,\r\nsupported upon an Iron. The first running of the Stone is _Sulphur_.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the burned Stone is carry'd out, and laid upon a high\r\nHill, where it lies exposed to the Sun and Air for the space of two years,\r\nand then taketh fire of it self, casting forth a thin blew flame, scarce\r\ndiscernable in the day time. This being consumed, leaveth a blew dust\r\nbehind it; which the Workmen observe, and mark with woodden pins. This they\r\ndig up, and carry into the Work-house, and put it into great Tubs of Water,\r\nwhere it infuseth 24. hours or more. The Water they afterward boyl in\r\nKettles, as we do Saltpeter, and put it into cooling Tubs, wherein they\r\nplace crosse Sticks, and on them the _Vitriol_ fastens, as Sugar-candy\r\ndoth.\r\n\r\nThe Water, that remains after the extraction of the _Vitriol_, they mix\r\nwith an eight part of Urin and the Lees of Wood-ashes, which is again\r\nboyled very strong, and being set to cool in Tubbs, crosse Sticks are\r\nlikewise placed, and thereon the _Allum_ fastens.\r\n\r\nIn the Water, which remains after the _Allum_, is found a Sediment, which\r\nbeing separated from the Water, is put into an Oven, and Wood laid upon it\r\nand fired, till it become red, which makes the _Minium_, wherewith they\r\npaint their Houses, and make plaister.\r\n\r\n_So far this Description_; Which gave occasion to a curious person to call\r\nto mind, That there was a kind of Stone in the _North_ of _England_,\r\nyielding the same substances, except _Minium_. {377}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of the Raining of _Ashes_, in the _Archipelago_, upon the\r\nEruption of Mount _Vesuvius_, some years ago._\r\n\r\nThis came but lately to hand from that knowing person, Mr. _Henry\r\nRobinson_, and was thought fit to be now inserted here, that it might not\r\nbe lost, though it hath hapned above 30 years ago. It was contained in a\r\nLetter, (subscribed by Capt. _Will. Badily_) in these words:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: * Some of these Ashes were produced by Mr. _John Evelyn_, before\r\nthe _Royal Society_.]\r\n\r\nThe 6^{th.} of _December_ 1631, being in the Gulf of _Volo_, riding at\r\nAnchor, about ten of the Clock that Night, it began to rain Sand or Ashes,\r\nand continued till two of the Clock the next Morning. It was about two\r\ninches thick on the Deck, so that we cast it over board with Shovels, as we\r\ndid Snow the day before: The quantity of a Bushel we brought home, and\r\npresented to several Friends *, especially to the Masters of _Trinity\r\nHouse_. There was in our Company, Capt. _John Wilds_ Commander of the\r\n_Dragon_, and Capt. _Anthony Watts_, Commander of the _Elisabeth_ and\r\n_Dorcas_. There was no Wind stirring, when these Ashes fell, it did not\r\nfall onely in the places, where we were, but likewise in other parts, as\r\nShips were coming from St. _John D'Acre_ to our Port; they being at that\r\ntime a hundred Leagues from us. We compared the Ashes together, and found\r\nthem both one. If you desire to see the Ashes, let me know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Extract Of A Letter not long since written from _Rome_, rectifying the\r\nRelation of _Salamanders_ living in Fire._\r\n\r\nThis came from that Expert Anatomist M. _Steno_, to Dr. _Croone Videl_.\r\nThat a Knight called _Corvini_, had assured him, that, having cast a\r\n_Salamander_, brought him out of the _Indies_, into the Fire, the Animal\r\nthereupon swell'd presently, and then vomited store of thick slimy matter,\r\nwhich did put out the neighbouring Coals, to which the _Salamander_ retired\r\nimmediately, putting them out again in the same manner, as soon as they\r\n{378} rekindled, and by this means saving himself from the force of the\r\nFire, for the space of two hours, the Gentleman above-mentioned being then\r\nunwilling to hazard the Creature any further: That afterwards it lived nine\r\nMonths: That he had kept it eleven Months without any other food, but what\r\nit took by licking the Earth, on which it moved, and on which it had been\r\nbrought out of the _Indies_; which at first was covered with a thick\r\nmoisture, but being dried afterwards, the Urin of the Animal served to\r\nmoisten the same. After the eleven Months, the Owner having a mind to try,\r\nhow the Animal would do upon _Italian_ Earth, it died three dayes after it\r\nhad changed the Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of several Engagements for Observing of Tydes._\r\n\r\nSince nothing is more important for discovering the Cause of that Grand\r\n_Phænomenon_ of Nature, the _Flux_ and _Reflux of the Sea_, than a true and\r\nfull _History of the Tydes_; the _Virtuosi_ of _England_ have of late\r\n(especially since the Publication of Dr. _Wallis_ his _Theory_ touching\r\nthat _Apparence_) taken care, to direct and recommend in several parts of\r\nthe World, and particularly in the most proper places of these _Ilands_,\r\nsuch Observations, as may contribute to the elucidating of that Subject.\r\n\r\nAnd as formerly they have sent their _Inquiries_ of this Nature to the Isle\r\nof St. _Helena_, situated in the open Ocean beyond the _Æquinoctial_, and\r\nalready received some account thereupon; so they have since dispatcht the\r\nlike for the _Bermudas_, an _Isle_ that hath no less conveniency of\r\nsituation for that purpose. And they intend (as will more amply appear, God\r\npermitting, in a short time) to lodge with such Masters of Ships and\r\nPilots, as shall sayl into remote parts, very particular directions of that\r\nkind, to be printed at the _Royal Societies_ charges, and to be committed\r\nto the care of the Masters of _Trinity House_ for disposing of them to that\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAnd, as for the Observations, to be made in these Kingdoms; 'tis hoped,\r\nthat the Masters in the Art of Navigation at _Bristol_ (Mr. _Standridge_\r\nand Mr. _Iff_) will undertake that business with affection and care: the\r\nformer of these two having already (as we are informed from a good hand)\r\nmade a Collection of the Tydes; {379} for some years past, and found them\r\ndiffering from former Observations and Tables; the other promising future\r\ndiligence in this matter; noting in the mean time, that some Tydes of last\r\nAutumn were so far differing from former Observations, that neither he, nor\r\nany others there, could make any thing of it.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit here to mention the readiness, expressed by these worthy\r\nGentlemen, Mr. _Rob. Boyle_, Sir _Rob. Moray_, and Mr. _Henry Powle_, for\r\nconcurring in this Work; the first, having undertaken to recommend\r\nObservations of this nature, to be made, upon the _Western_ Coast of\r\n_Ireland_ *; the second, upon the West of _Scotland_; and the third, in the\r\nIsle of _Lundy_; to whom we must adde the inquisitive Mr. _Sam.\r\nColepresse_, for _Plymouth_, and the _Lands-end_. Besides, we hope to\r\nengage the curious of _France_ in the same undertaking, especially for\r\nprocuring, besides what is known already concerning that place, a very\r\nparticular and exact account of the Tydes upon the Coast of _Britany_,\r\nwhere (especially about St. _Malo_) they are found to rise to admiration,\r\neven to 60, 70, and sometime 80, feet, at the New and Full Moon.\r\n\r\n    * The Observations particularly recommended for that Coast, are these;\r\n\r\n    1. At what hour it is High-water on the day of the New and Full Moon,\r\n    upon every Cape and Bay of the Western Coast of _Ireland_.\r\n\r\n    2. How long after the New and Full Moon the highest Spring-tides fall\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    3. What are the perpendicular heights of the Flood, both at the\r\n    ordinary, and the Spring-tydes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Some Suggestions for Remedies against _Cold_._\r\n\r\nAs there have been Remedies found out against excessive _Heat_, and Means\r\nof cooling Meat and Drink; so it was lately, on the occasion of the sharp\r\nSeason, suggested, That Remedies might be thought on against _Cold_; and\r\nthat particularly it might be inquired into,\r\n\r\n1. What things in Nature, or by Art, or Mechanical contrivance will retain\r\na warming Heat longest, or a melting or scorching Heat?\r\n\r\n2. What will continue or maintain Fire longest?\r\n\r\nSome that observe common practises and vulgar Trades, take notice, That\r\n_Joyners_ use _Leaden-Pots_ for their Glue, alledging for a Reason, That\r\nLead, being a close Mettal, retains the heat {380} longer than other\r\nMettals. _Cary_'s Warming-stone promised a warmth for six or eight hours;\r\nif it performed but for two or three hours, it would be of great use. 'Tis\r\nfound by sad experience, how hurtful Bright Fires, and especially of\r\nStone-coal are to the Eyes.\r\n\r\nTo retain Fire long, certain _Black_ Earths are useful, as we were newly\r\ninformed by the Inquisitive Dr. _B._ That a Gentleman in _Sommertsetshire_,\r\ncalled Mr. _Speke_, had bountifully obliged _Ilminster_, and his\r\nNeighborhood, by a Black Fat-Earth lately found in his Park. But the same\r\nCorrespondent adds, That he never saw any parallel to a _Sea-weed_, which\r\nhe and some of his Fellow-Students had in _Cambridge_ in the mouth of a\r\nBarrel of good Oysters. It was smaller than Pease-halm, yet cut, it lasted\r\ntwo very great Fires of Sea-coal, burning bright in the midst of the Fire;\r\nand by a stroak of the Tongues, it fell into the Hearth, jingling like\r\nMettal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Relation of an uncommon Accident in two Aged Persons._\r\n\r\nThis was imparted by the above-mentioned Mr. _Colepresse_, who assures in\r\nhis Letter, containing this Account, That the matter of fact was thorowly\r\nexamined by himself, and that he was fully, and in all respects, satisfied\r\nof the truth thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Relation of the one, is in these words._\r\n\r\n_Joseh Shute_ Clerk, Parson of _Mary_ (nigh _Plymouth_) in the County of\r\n_Devon_, aged 81 years, being a temperate man, and of an healthy\r\nconstitution, having the in-most Grinder loose, and so remaining,\r\nperceived, that his mouth, about three Moneths since, was somewhat\r\nstreightned; and upon inquiry into the cause of it, found, That he had a\r\nnew Tooth (the third Grinder) being the innermost of the upper Jaw in the\r\nRight Cheek, which still remains firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Account of the other follows thus._\r\n\r\n_Maria Stert_ of _Benecliffe_, in _Plympton St. Mary_ (near _Plymouth_) in\r\n_Devon_, aged about 75 years, an healthy person, having had nine children,\r\nabout the fortieth year of her age lost three of her {381} upper\r\n_Incisores_ or _Cutters_, the other drawn out, and so remained Toothless,\r\nas to them, for about 25 years, when she perceived, that a new Tooth came\r\nforth (without any pain) next the _Canini_ of the left Cheek: And about two\r\nyears after, another Tooth grew out likewise without pain, close by the\r\nformer. The first whereof, never came to above half the length of her\r\nformer _Cutters_, the latter scarce breaking the skin: Both which yet\r\nproved serviceable, till about six weeks since, when she eating (no hard,\r\ncrusty, or solid) Meat, that Tooth which came out first, fell down into her\r\nMouth, without any loosness before hand perceived, or any pain; which had\r\nnot a phang like other _Cutters_, but much less, and shorter. The other\r\nabides firm, and serviceable.\r\n\r\nTo the truth of these Relations, not onely the said _Joseph Shute_ and\r\n_Maria Stert_, have put the one his name, the other her Mark, the third and\r\nseventh of _January_, 1666. but also Sir _William Strode_, and Mr.\r\n_Colepresse_ have subscribed the same, as believing the Relation to be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of two Books._\r\n\r\n__I. ISMAELIS BULLIALDI_ ad Astronomos Monita duo: Primum, De Stella Nova,\r\nquæ in Collo Ceti ante annos aliquot visa est. Alterum, De Nebulosa in\r\nAndromeda Cinguli parte Borea, ante biennium iterum orta._\r\n\r\nThe chief end of the _Author_ in publishing this Tract, seems to be, To\r\nexcite Astronomers to a diligent observation, both of that _New Star_ in\r\nthe _Neck_ of the _Whale_, to be seen in _February_ and _March_ next; and\r\nof that other, in the Northern part of _Andromeda's Girdle_, to be seen at\r\nthis very present.\r\n\r\nAs to the _former_ of these Stars, _he affirms_, that, as it hath appeared\r\nfor many years in the said place, so it will in the beginning of _March_\r\nnext appear equal to the Stars of the _third Magnitude_, or perhaps bigger;\r\nand that about the end of the same Month, if the Crepuscle do not hinder,\r\nthe greatest _Phasis_ of it will appear, if so be, that it keep the same\r\nAnalogy of Motions and Periods, which it observed from _An._ 1638. to _An._\r\n1664. Where he takes notice of the Causes, why its two greatest Appearances\r\ncould not be seen, _An._ 1664, 1665, 1666; and how he {382} comes to know,\r\nthat in the beginning of _March_ next, It will equal, or even exceed the\r\nStars of the _Third Magnitude_; noting, that from the Observations hitherto\r\nmade of this Star, it is manifest, that the _greatest Phases_ thereof do\r\nevery year anticipate by 32. or 33. dayes; forasmuch as _An._ 1660. its\r\n_greatest Appearance_ was about the end of _October_ and the beginning of\r\n_November_; _An._ 1661. about the end of _September_, or the beginning of\r\n_October_; _An._ 1662. about the end of _August_, &c. so that this year it\r\nmust be in _March_, if the former Analogy do hold.\r\n\r\nHe collects also from the Observations, That one _Period_ from the\r\n_greatest Phasis_ to the next, consists of about 333. dayes: but that the\r\ninterval of the time betwixt the times of its beginning to appear equal to\r\nthe Stars of the _Sixt Magnitude_, and of its ending to do so, consists of\r\nabout 120. dayes: And that its _greatest Appearance_ lasts about 15. dayes:\r\nAll which yet he would have understood with some latitude.\r\n\r\nThis done, he proceeds to the investigation of the Causes of the\r\nVicissitudes in the Emersion and Dis-appearance of this Star, and having\r\ndiscoursed, That the apparent Increase and Decrement of every Lucid Body\r\nproceeds _either_ from its changed distance from the Eye of the Observer;\r\n_or_ from its various site and position in respect of him, whereby the\r\nangle of Vision is changed; or from the increase or diminution of the bulk\r\nof the lucid body it self: and having also demonstrated it impossible, that\r\nthis Star should move in a _Circle_, or in an _Ellipsis_; and proved it\r\nimprobable that it should move in a _Strait Line_, he concludes, that there\r\ncan be no other genuin, or at least, no other more probable cause of its\r\nEmersion and Occultation, than this, That the bigger part of that round\r\nBody is obscure and inconspicuous to us, and its lesser part lucid, the\r\nwhole Body turning about its own Center, and one Axe; whereby for one\r\ndeterminate space of time it exhibits its lucid part to the Earth, for\r\nanother, subducts it: it not being likely, that fires should be kindled in\r\nthe Body of that Star, and that the matter thereof should at certain times\r\ntake fire and shine, at other times be extinguisht upon the consumption of\r\nthat matter.\r\n\r\n_So far of that Star._ As to the other in the _Girdle_ of _Andromeda_, seen\r\nabout the beginning of _An._ 1665; he relates, that, when in the end of\r\n1664. the World beheld the then appearing _Comet_, {383} Astronomers\r\nobserved also this new _Phænomenon_, which was called by them _Nebulosa in\r\nCingulo Andromedæ_. Concerning which, he notes, that the same had been\r\nalready seen many years before by _Simon Narius_, vid. _An._ 1612. when\r\nwith a _Telescope_ he search'd for the _Satellits_ of _Jupiter_, and\r\nobserved their motions; alledging for proof hereof, the said _Authors_ own\r\nwords, out of his own Book, _De Mundo Joviali_, publisht _An._ 1614. And\r\nfarther shews, that it hath formerly appear'd (about 150. years ago) and\r\nbeen taken notice off by an expert, though Anonymous, Astronomer; whose\r\nwords he cites out of a _Manuscript_, brought out of _Holland_ by the\r\nExcellent _Jacobus Augustus Thuanus_, returning from his Embassy to\r\n_Paris_; wherein also was marked the _Figure_ of that _Phænomenon_;\r\nrepresented in print by our Author: who from all this collects, that,\r\nwhereas this Star hath been seen formerly, and that 150. years since, but\r\nyet neither observed by _Hipparchus_, nor any other of the Antients, that\r\nwe can find; nor also in the former Age by _Tycho Brahe_, nor in our Age,\r\nby _Bayerus_; and appear'd also in the Month of _November_ last (wherein he\r\nwrote this _Tract_) much lessened and obscure, after it had, two years ago,\r\nshone very bright; that therefore it must needs appear and dis-appear by\r\nturns, like those in the _Necks_ of the _Whale_ and _Swan_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__II._ ENTRIENS sur les Vies et sur les Ouvrages_ Des plus excellens\r\nPeintres, Anciens et Modernes, par Monsieur_ FELIBIEN._\r\n\r\nThis Author, having first discoursed of that Royal Pallace the _Louvre_,\r\nand the Designs of finishing it; passes on to the Art of _Picturing_, and\r\ntreats of the three principal things, wherein a good Master of the Art must\r\nexcel, _vid._ the Composition, Designing, and Laying on of Colours, which\r\ndone, he ravels into the Origine, and deduces the Progress of Painting, and\r\nrelates what is most remarkable in the Lives of the Antient Painters: And\r\namong many particulars, he observes in the Life of _Andreas de Sarte_, how\r\ndifficult it is, to judge well of a Picture; relating, that a Duke of\r\n_Mantua_, having obtained of _Clement_ VII. a Pourtrait of _Leo_ X. which\r\nhad been done by _Raphael Urbin_, and was at _Florence_, those of that Town\r\nbeing unwilling to lose so excellent a {384} piece, caused a Copy thereof\r\nto be made by the said _Andreas de Sarte_, which they sent instead of the\r\nOriginal. This _Copy_ was so perfect, that _Julio Romano_, who had been\r\nbred and taught by _Raphael_, and was one of the best Painters of _Italy_,\r\ntook it for an _Original_; and would never have been undeceived, if one\r\n_Vasari_ had not assured him, that it was but a Copy, which himself had\r\nseen made, and had not shew'd him certain marks, that were there put to\r\ndiscriminate it from the Original.\r\n\r\nIn the _Second_ Part, the Author has set down all that is requisite to\r\njudge and discourse well of Painting. But, to add Examples to Precepts, he\r\ndiscourses of the _Modern_ Painters, and making a Description of their best\r\nWorks, he takes occasion to observe, what is there found most excellent,\r\nand to shew, how they have put in practice the Rules of Art. He treats also\r\nof the declining of Painting, and affirms, that nothing considerable hath\r\nbeen done in it from the time of _Constantine_, till _An._ 1240. when one,\r\n_Cimabue_, began to raise this Art again. After this, he give a List of the\r\nPainters, that since have been famous for their Works, preferring before\r\nall others, _Raphael Urbin_. The last of all is the above-mention'd _Andrè\r\nde Sartes_, who died, _An._ 1530. and whom the liberality of _Francis_ I.\r\nhad drawn into _France_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Printing of these Tracts is now return'd to the first Printer thereof,\r\nas being somewhat re-setled after the late sad Fire of _London_.\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _SAVOY_, Printed by _T.

At the reading of them, the _Author_\r\ndeclared, that of divers of them he thought he could fore-see the Events,\r\nbut {386} yet judged it fit, not to omit them, because the Importance of\r\nthe _Theories_, they may give light to, may make the Tryals recompence the\r\npains, whether the success favour the _Affirmative_ or the _Negative_ of\r\nthe Question, by enabling us to determine the one or the other upon surer\r\ngrounds, than we could otherwise do. And this Advertisement he desires may\r\nbe applied to those other Papers of his, that consist of _Quæries_ or\r\nproposed _Tryals_.\r\n\r\n_The _Quæries_ themselves follow._\r\n\r\n1. Whether by this way of Transfusing Blood; the disposition of Individual\r\nAnimals of the same kind, may not be much altered? (As whether a _fierce_\r\nDog, by being often quite new stocked with the blood of a _cowardly_ Dog,\r\nmay not become more tame; _& vice versa, &c_?)\r\n\r\n2. Whether immediately upon the unbinding of a Dog, replenisht with\r\nadventitious blood, he will know and fawn upon his Master; and do the like\r\ncustomary things as before? And whether he will do such things better or\r\nworse at some time after the Operation?\r\n\r\n3. Whether those Dogs, that have _Peculiarities_, will have them either\r\nabolisht, or at least much impaired by transfusion of blood? (As whether\r\nthe blood of a _Mastiff_, being frequently transfused into a _Blood-hound_,\r\nor a _Spaniel_, will not prejudice them in point of scent?)\r\n\r\n4. Whether acquired Habits will be destroy'd or impair'd by this\r\nExperiment? (As whether a Dog, taught to fetch and carry, or to dive after\r\nDucks, or to sett, will after frequent and full recruits of the blood of\r\nDogs unfit for those Exercises, be as good at them, as before?)\r\n\r\n5. Whether any considerable change is to be observ'd in the Pulse, Urin,\r\nand other Excrements of the _Recipient_ Animal, by this Operation, or the\r\nquantity of his insensible Transpiration?\r\n\r\n6. Whether the _Emittent_ Dog, being full fed at such a distance of time\r\nbefore the Operation, that the mass of blood may be suppos'd to abound with\r\n_Chyle_, the _Recipient_ Dog, being before hungry, will lose his appetite,\r\nmore than if the _Emittent_ Dogs blood had not been so chylous? And how\r\nlong, upon a {387} Vein opened of a Dog, the admitted blood will be found\r\nto retain _Chyle_?\r\n\r\n7. Whether a Dog may be kept alive without eating by the frequent Injection\r\nof the Chyle of another, taken freshly from the Receptacle, into the Veins\r\nof the _Recipient_ Dog?\r\n\r\n8. Whether a Dog, that is _sick_ of some disease chiefly imputable to the\r\nmass of blood, may be cured by exchanging it for that of a _sound_ Dog? And\r\nwhether a _sound_ Dog may receive such diseases from the blood of a _sick_\r\none, as are not otherwise of an infectious nature?\r\n\r\n9. What will be the Operation of frequently stocking (which is feasible\r\nenough) an _old_ and feeble Dog with the blood of _young_ ones, as to\r\nliveliness, dulness, drowsiness, squeamishness, &c., _et vice versa_?\r\n\r\n10. Whether a _small_ young Dog, by being often fresh stockt with the blood\r\nof a young Dog of a _larger_ kind, will grow bigger, than the ordinary size\r\nof his own kind?\r\n\r\n11. Whether any Medicated Liquors may be injected together with the blood\r\ninto the _Recipient_ Dog? And in case they may, whether there will be any\r\nconsiderable difference found between the separations made on this\r\noccasion, and those, which would be made, in case such Medicated Liquors\r\nhad been injected with some other Vehicle, or alone, or taken in at the\r\nmouth?\r\n\r\n12. Whether a Purging Medicine, being given to the _Emittent_ Dog a while\r\nbefore the Operation, the _Recipient_ Dog will be thereby purged, and how?\r\n(which Experiment may be hugely varied.)\r\n\r\n13. Whether the Operation may be successfully practis'd, in case the\r\ninjected blood be that of an Animal of another _Species_, as of a _Calf_\r\ninto a _Dog_, &c. and of a _Cold_ Animal, as of a _Fish_, or _Frog_, or\r\n_Tortoise_, into the Vessels of a _Hot_ Animal, and _vice versa_?\r\n\r\n14. Whether the _Colour_ of the Hair or Feathers of the _Recipient_ Animal,\r\nby the frequent repeating of this Operation, will be changed into that of\r\nthe _Emittent_?\r\n\r\n15. Whether by frequently transfusing into the same Dog, the blood of some\r\nAnimal of another _Species_, something further, and more tending to some\r\ndegrees of a change of _Species_, may {388} be effected, at least in\r\nAnimals near of Kin; (As Spaniels and Setting Dogs, Irish Grey-hounds and\r\nordinary Grey-hounds, &c?)\r\n\r\n16. Whether the Transfusion may be practic'd upon pregnant Bitches, at\r\nleast at certain times of their gravidation? And what effect it will have\r\nupon the Whelps?\r\n\r\n_There_ were some other _Quæries_ proposed by the same _Author_; as, the\r\nweighing of the _Emittent_ Animal before the Operation, that (making an\r\nabatement for the Effluviums, and for the Excrements, if it voids any) it\r\nmay appear, how much blood it really loses. To which were annext divers\r\nothers not so fit to be perused but by _Physitians_, and therefore here\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Method for Observing the _Eclipses of the Moon_, free from the Common\r\nInconveniencies, as it was left by the Learned Mr. _Rook_, late\r\n_Gresham_-Professor of Geometry._\r\n\r\nEclipses of the Moon are observed for two principal ends; One\r\n_Astronomical_, that by comparing Observations with Calculations, the\r\n_Theory_ of the _Moons Motion_ may be perfected, and the _Tables_ thereof\r\nreformed: the other, _Geographical_, that by comparing among themselves the\r\nObservations of the same _Ecliptick Phases_, made in _divers_ places, the\r\n_Difference_ of _Meridians_ or _Longitudes_ of those places may be\r\ndiscerned.\r\n\r\nThe Knowledge of the Eclipse's Quantity and Duration, the Shadows, Curvity,\r\nand Inclination, &c. conduce only to the former of these ends. The exact\r\ntime of the Beginning, Middle, and End of Eclipses, as also in _Total_\r\nones, the Beginning and End of _Total_ darkness, is useful for both of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut because in Observations made by the _bare_ Eye, these times\r\nconsiderably differ from those with a _Telescope_; and, because the\r\n_Beginning_ of Eclipses, and the _End_ of _Total_ darkness, are scarce to\r\nbe observed exactly, even with Glasses (none being able clearly to\r\ndistinguish between the _True_ Shadow and _Penumbra_, unless he hath seen,\r\nfor some time before, the Line, separating them, pass along upon the\r\nSurface of the Moon;) and lastly, because in small {389} _Partial_\r\nEclipses, the Beginning and End, and in _Total_ ones of short continuance\r\nin the Shadow, the Beginning and End of _Total_ darkness, are unfit for\r\nnice Observations, by reason of the slow change of _Apparences_, which the\r\n_Oblique_ Motion of the Shadow then causeth. For these reasons I shall\r\npropound a _Method_ peculiarly design'd for the Accomplishment of the\r\n_Geographical_ end in Observing Lunar Eclipses, free (as far as is\r\npossible) from all the mentioned Inconveniences.\r\n\r\nFor, _First_, It shall not be practicable without a Telescope. _Secondly_,\r\nThe Observer shall alwayes have opportunity before his principal\r\nObservation, to note the Distinction between the _True Shadow_ and the\r\n_Penumbra_. And, _Thirdly_, It shall be applicable to those Seasons of the\r\nEclipse, when there is the suddenest Alteration in the _Apparences_.\r\n\r\nTo satisfie all which intents,\r\n\r\nLet there be of the Eminentest _Spots_, dispersed over all Quarters of the\r\nMoons Surface, a select number generally agreed on, to be constantly made\r\nuse of, to this purpose, in all parts of the World. As, for Example, those,\r\nwhich _M. Hevelius_ calleth,\r\n\r\n         { Sinai.\r\n         {\r\n         { Æthna.                   { Besbicus.           { Mæotis.\r\n   Mons  {                  Insula. {               Palus {\r\n         { Porphyrites.             { Creta.              { Maræotis.\r\n         {                                          Lacus Niger Major.\r\n         { Serorum.\r\n\r\nLet in each _Eclipse_, not all, but (for instance) three of these _Spots_,\r\nwhich then lie nearest to the _Ecliptick_, be exactly observed, when they\r\nare first touch'd by the _True_ Shadow, and again, when they are just\r\ncompleatly entred into it, and (if you please) also in the _Decrease_ of\r\nthe Eclipse, when they are first fully clear from the _True_ Shadow: For\r\nthe accurate determinations of which moments of time (that being in this\r\nbusiness of main importance) let there be taken _Altitudes_ of remarkable\r\n_Fixed Stars_ on this {390} side of the _Line_, of such, as lie between the\r\n_Æquator_ and _Tropick_ of _Cancer_; but _beyond_ the _Line_, of such, as\r\nare situate towards the other _Tropick_; and in all places, of such, as at\r\nthe time of Observation, are about 4. hours distant from the _Meridian_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account of some Observations, lately made in _Spain_, by His Excellency\r\nthe _Earl of Sandwich_._\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable the _Earl of Sandwich_, as he appears eminent in\r\ndischarging the Trust, his Majesty hath reposed in him, of Ambassador\r\nExtraordinary to the King of _Spain_; so he forgets not in the midst of\r\nthat Employment, that he is a Member of the _Royal Society_; but does from\r\ntime to time, when his weighty State-Negotiations do permit, imploy himself\r\nin making considerable Observations of divers kinds, both _Astronomical_\r\nand _Physiological_; and communicateth the same to the said _Society_; as\r\nfor instance, lately, what he has observ'd concerning the _Solar Eclipse_\r\nin _June_ last, the Suns height in the Solstice, and also the Latitude of\r\n_Madrid_, esteeming by the Suns Altitude in the _Solstice_, and by other\r\nMeridian Altitudes, the _Latitude_ of _Madrid_ to be 40 deg. 10 min; which\r\ndiffers considerably from that assigned by others; the General Chart of\r\n_Europe_ giving to it 41 deg. 30 min. the General Map of _Spain_, 40 deg.\r\n27 min. A large Provincial Map of _Castile_, 40 deg. 38 min.\r\n\r\nTo these particulars, and others formerly imparted, his Excellency is\r\nmaking more of the same nature; and particularly those of the Immersion of\r\nthe _Satellites_ of _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit mentioning here, what he hath observed of _Halo_'s about\r\nthe _Moon_; which he relates in these words;\r\n\r\n_Decemb._ 25. _Old Style_, 1666. In the Evening, here (vid. at _Madrid_)\r\nwas a great _Halo_ about the Moon, the _Semidiameter_ whereof was about 23\r\ndeg. 30 min. _Aldebaran_ was just in the _North-east_ part of the _Circle_,\r\nand the two Horns of _Aries_ just enclosed by the _South-west_ of the\r\n_Circle_, the Moon being in the _Center_. I note this the rather (_saith\r\nhe_) because five or six years ago, vid. _Novemb._ 21. _Old Style_, 1661.\r\nan hour after Sun-set, I saw a great _Halo_ about the Moon of the same\r\n_Semidiameter_, {391} at _Tangier_, the Moon being very near the same\r\nplace, where she was now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter, lately written by Mr. _Nathaniel Fairfax_ to the\r\n_Publisher_, containing Observations about some _Insects_, and their\r\nInoxiousness, &c._\r\n\r\nThe Ingenious Author of this Letter, as he expresses an extraordinary\r\ndesire to see the _Store-house_ of _Natural Philosophy_, more richly\r\nfraughted (a Work begun by the single care and conduct of the Excellent\r\nLord _Verulam_, and prosecuted by the Joynt-undertakings of the _R.\r\nSociety_) so he very frankly offers his Service in contributing some of his\r\nObservations, and begins in this very Letter to perform his Offer. For,\r\nHaving taken notice of what was publisht in _Numb. 9. p. 161_. out of the\r\n_Italian_ Philosopher _Redi_, vid. That Creatures, reputed Venomous, are\r\nindeed no Poysons, when swallow'd, though they may prove so, when put into\r\nWounds: He, for confirmation thereof, alledges Examples of several Persons\r\nwell known to him (himself also having been an Eye-witness to some such\r\nExperiments) who have frequently swallow'd _Spiders_, even of the rankest\r\nkind, without any more harm than happens to Hens, Robin-red-breasts, and\r\nother Birds, who make Spiders their daily Commons. And having made mention\r\nof some men, that eat even _Toads_, he adds, that though a Toad be not a\r\nPoyson to us in the whole; yet it may invenome outwardly, according to some\r\nparts so and so stirr'd; an instance whereof he alledges in a Boy, who\r\nstumbling on a Toad, and hurling stones at it, some Juyce from the bruised\r\nToad chanced to light upon his Lips, whereupon they swell'd, each to the\r\nthickness of about two Thumbs: And he neglecting to use, what might be\r\nproper to restore them, they have continued in that mishapen size ever\r\nsince; the ugliness whereof, when the Relator saw, gave him occasion to\r\ninquire after the cause of it, which thereupon he understood to be, as has\r\nbeen recited.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the same Gentleman relates, that once seeing a Spider\r\nbruised into a small Glass of Water, and that it tinged {392} it somewhat\r\nof a Sky-colour, he was, upon owning his surprise thereat, informed, that a\r\ndozen of them being put in, they would dye it to almost a full _Azure_.\r\nWhich is touch't here, that, the Experiment being so easie to make, it may\r\nbe tried, when the season furnishes those Insects; meantime, it seems not\r\nmore incredible, that this Creature should yield a Sky-colour, when put in\r\nwater, than that _Cochineel_, which also is but an Insect, should afford a\r\nfine _red_, when steep'd in the same Liquor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Account Of Some Books._\r\n\r\n_I._ Le Tome troisieme et dernier des Lettres de _M. DES-CARTES_.\r\n\r\nAs the two first _Tomes_ of M. _Des-Cartes_ his Letters, contain Questions,\r\nfor the most part of a _Moral_ and _Physiological_ Nature, proposed to, and\r\nanswer'd by him; so _this_ consists of the Contests, he had upon several\r\nSubjects with divers Men eminent in his time.\r\n\r\nTo pass by that sharp Contest, he was engaged in by some Professors of\r\nDivinity at _Utrecht_, who endeavoured to discredit his Philosophy, as\r\nleading to Libertinisme and Atheisme, notwithstanding he made it so much\r\nhis business, as to assert the Existence of a Deity, and the Immortality of\r\na Soul: We shall take notice of what is more to our purpose, _vid._ the\r\nDifferences, he had touching his _Dioptricks_ and _Geometry_.\r\n\r\nAs for his _Dioptricks_, though a great part of the Learned World have much\r\nesteem'd that Treatise, as leaving little to be said after him upon that\r\nSubject; yet there have not been wanting Mathematicians, who have declared\r\ntheir disagreement from his Principles in that Doctrine. The first of them\r\nwas the Jesuit _Bourdin_, Mathematick Professor in the Colledg of\r\n_Clermont_ at _Paris_; but this difference was soon at an end. A second was\r\nMr. _Hobbs_, upon whose account he wrote several Letters to _Mersennus_,\r\ncontaining many remarks conducing to the Knowledge of the Nature of\r\n_Reflection_ and _Refraction_. But the Person, that did most learnedly and\r\nresolutely attack the said _Dioptricks_, was Monsieur _Fermat_, {393}\r\nwriting first about it to _Mersennus_, who soon communicated his Objections\r\nto M. _Des-Cartes_, who failed not to return his Answer to them. But\r\n_Fermat_ replied, and _Des-Cartes_ likewise; and after many reciprocations,\r\nin which each party pretended to have the advantage, the matter rested;\r\nuntil M. _Fermat_ taking occasion to write afresh of it to M. _De la\r\nChambre_, several years after _Des-Cartes_'s death, upon occasion of a\r\nBook, written M. _De la Chambre_, _Of Light_; discoursed with this new\r\n_Author_ after the same rate, as he had done before with _Des-Cartes_\r\nhimself, and seemed to invite some-body of his friends, to re-assume the\r\nformer contest. Whereupon M. _Clerselier_ and M. _Rohault_ took up the\r\nGantlet, to assert the Doctrine of the deceased Philosopher, exchanging\r\nseveral Letters with M. _Fermat_, all inserted in this _Tome_, and serving\r\nfully to instruct the Reader of this Difference, and withal to elucidate\r\nmany difficult points of the Subject of _Refractions_; especially of this\r\nparticular, _Whether the Motion of Light is more easily, and with more\r\nexpedition, perform'd through _dense_ Mediums, than _rare_._\r\n\r\nBesides this, though one would think, Disputes had no place in _Geometry_,\r\nsince all proofs there, are as many Demonstrations; yet M. _Des-Cartes_\r\nhath had several scufles touching that Science. As M. _Fermat_ had\r\nassaulted his _Dioptricks_, so He reciprocally examined his Treatise _De\r\nMaximis & Minimis_, pretending to have met with _Paralogismes_ in it. But\r\nthe Cause of M. _Fermat_ was learnedly pleaded for, by some of his Friends,\r\nwho took their turn to examine the Treatise of _Des-Carte_'s Geometry;\r\nwhereupon many _Letters_ were exchanged, to be found this Book, and\r\ndeserving to be considered; which doubtless the Curious would easily be\r\ninduced to do, if Copies of this Book were to be obtain'd here in\r\n_England_, besides that one, which the _Publisher_ received from his\r\n_Parisian_ Correspondent, and which affords him the opportunity of giving\r\nthis, though but Cursory, Account of it.\r\n\r\nAs to _Physicks_, there occur chiefly two Questions, learnedly treated of\r\nin this _Volume_, though not without some heat between M. _Des-Cartes_ and\r\nM. _Roberval_. The _one_ is, touching the Vibrations of Bodies suspended in\r\nthe Air, and their Center of Agitation: about which, there is also a Letter\r\ninserted of {394} M. _Des-Cartes_ to that late Noble and Learned English\r\nKnight, Sir _Charles Cavendish_. The _other_ is, whether Motion can be made\r\nwithout supposing a _Vacuum_: where 'tis represented, That, if one\r\ncomprehend well the Nature, ascribed to the _Materia subtilis_, and how\r\nMotions, called _Circular_, are made, which need not be just _Ovals_ or\r\n_true_ Circles, but are only called Circular, in regard that their Motion\r\nends, where it had begun, whatever irregularity there be in the Middle; and\r\nalso, that all the Inequalities, that may be in the Magnitude or Figure of\r\nthe parts, may be compensated by other inequalities, met with in their\r\nSwiftness, and by the facility, with which the parts of the _Subtle\r\nMatter_, or of the first _Cartesian_ Element, which are found every where,\r\nhappen to be divided, or to accommodate their Figure to the Space, they are\r\nto fill up: If these things be well understood and considered, that then no\r\ndifficulty can remain touching the Motion of the parts of Matter _in\r\npleno_.\r\n\r\nBesides all these particulars, treated of in this _Tome_, there occur many\r\npretty Questions concerning _Numbers_, the _Cycloid_, the manner of\r\n_Working Glasses for Telescopes_, the way of _Weighing Air_, and many other\r\nCuriosities, Mathematical and Physical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. _ASTRONOMIA REFORMATA_, Auctore _JOHANNE BAPT. RICCIOLI_, Soc. Jesu._\r\n\r\nFor the Notice of this Book, and the Account of the Chief Heads contained\r\ntherein, we are obliged to the _Journal des Scavans_; which informs us,\r\n\r\n_First_, That the Design of this Work is, that, because several\r\n_Astronomers_, having had their several _Hypotheses_, there is found so\r\ngreat a diversity of opinions, that it is difficult thence to conclude any\r\nthing certain; this Author judged it also necessary, to compare together\r\nall the best Observations, and upon examination of what they have most\r\ncertain in them, to reform upon that measure the Principles of Astronomy.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, That this _Volume_ is divided into two Parts, whereof the\r\n_First_ is composed of _Ten_ Books; in which the Author {395} considers the\r\nprincipal Observations, hitherto made of the Motion of the Planets and the\r\nFixed Stars, of their Magnitude, Figure, and other Accidents; drawing\r\nthence several Conclusions, in which he establishes his _Hypothesis_. The\r\n_second_ contains his _Astronomical Tables_, made according to the\r\n_Hypotheses_ of the First Part, together with Instructions teaching the\r\nmanner of using them.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, That Astronomers will find in this Book many very remarkable\r\nthings, concerning the _Apparent Diameter of the Sun_ and the other Stars,\r\nthe Motion of the _Libration of the Moon_, the _Eclipses_, _Parallaxes_,\r\nand _Refractions_: And that this Author shews, that there is a great\r\ndifference between _Optical_ and _Astronomical_ Refraction, which _Tycho_\r\nand many others have confounded; undertaking to prove, that, whereas these\r\n_Astronomers_ have believed, that the remoter any Star is, the less is its\r\nRefraction, on the contrary the Refraction is the greater, the more a Star\r\nis distant. And among many other things, he ingeniously explicates the two\r\ncontrary Motions of the Sun, from East to West, and _vice versa_, by one\r\nonely Motion upon a _Spiral_, turning about a _Cone_.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, That he represents, How uneasie it is to establish sure\r\nPrinciples of this Science, by reason of the difficulties of making exact\r\nObservations. So, for example, in the Observation of the _Equinox_, every\r\none is mistaken by so many _Hours_, as he is of _Minutes_, in the Elevation\r\nof the _Pole_, or the Diameter of the Sun, or the Refraction, or in any\r\nother circumstance. In the Observation of the _Solstice_, the error of one\r\nonly _Second_ causeth a mistake of an _Hour_ and an _half_: mean time 'tis\r\nalmost impossible to avoid the error of a _Second_; and even the sharpest\r\nsight will not be able to perceive it, except it be assisted with an\r\nInstrument of a prodigious bigness. For to mark _Seconds_, though Lines\r\nwere drawn as subtil as the single threds of a Silk-worms Clew, (which are\r\nthe smallest spaces to be discerned by the sharpest Eye) by the Calculation\r\nmade by this Author there would need an Instrument of 48. feet _Radius_,\r\nsince Experience shews, that there needs no more at most, than 3600. threds\r\nof Silk to cover the space of an _inch_. But, suppose one could have a\r\n_Quadrant_ of this bigness, who can assure himself, that dividing it into\r\n{396} 324000. parts (for so many _Seconds_ there are in 90. _Degrees_)\r\neither in placing it, or in observing, he shall not mistake the thickness\r\nof a single thred of Silk? He adds, that Great Instruments have their\r\ndefects, as the small ones: For in those, that are _Movable_, if the thred,\r\non which the Lead hangs, is any thing big, it cannot exactly mark\r\n_Seconds_; if it be very fine, it breaks, because of its great length, and\r\nthe weight of the Lead: And in the _Fixed_ ones, the greater the _Diameter_\r\nis, the less the Shadow or the Light is terminated; so that it is painful\r\nenough, exactly to discern the extremities thereof. Yet 'tis certain, that\r\nthe greater the Instruments are, the surer _Astronomers_ may be: Whence it\r\nis, the some _Astronomers_ have made use of _Obelisks_ of a vast bigness,\r\nto take the _Altitudes_; and Signior _Cassini_, after the example of\r\n_Egnatio Dante_, caused a hole to be made on the highest part of a Wall of\r\n95. feet in a Church at _Bononia_, through which the beams of the Sun\r\nfalling on the Floor, mark as exactly as is possible, the height of that\r\nLuminary.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, That the Author reasons for the _Immobility of the Earth_ after\r\nthis manner. He supposes for certain, that the swiftness of the Motion of\r\nheavy bodies doth still _increase_ in their descent; to confirm which\r\nprinciple, he affirms to have experimented, That, if you let fall a Ball\r\ninto one of the Scales of a Ballance, according to the proportion of the\r\nheight, it falls from, it raiseth different weights in the other Scale. For\r\nexample, A Wooden Ball, of 1½ ounce, falling from a height of 35 inches,\r\nraiseth a weight of 5. ounces; from the height of 140 inches, a weight of\r\n20 ounces; from that of 315 inches, one of 45 ounces; and from another of\r\n560 inches, one of 80 ounces, &c. From this principle he concludes the\r\nEarth to be at Rest; for _saith he_, if it should have a Diurnal Motion\r\nupon its Center, Heavy Bodies being carried along with it by its motion,\r\nwould in descending describe a _Curve Line_, and, as he shews by a\r\n_Calculus_, made by him, run equal spaces in equal times; whence it\r\nfollows, that the Celerity of their Motion would not increase in\r\ndescending, and that consequently their stroke would not be stronger, after\r\nthey had fallen thorow a longer space. {397}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. _ANATOME MEDULLAE SPINALIS, ET NERVORUM_ inde provenientium, _GERARDI\r\nBLASII_, M. D._\r\n\r\nThe Author shews in this little _Tract_ a way of taking the entire _Medulla\r\nSpinalis_, or Marrow of the Back, out of its _Theca_ or Bony Receptacle\r\n_without Laceration_; which else happens frequently, both of the Nerves\r\nproceeding from it, and of the Coats investing it; not to name other parts\r\nof the same. This he affirms to have been put into practice by himself, by\r\na fine Saw and Wedge; which are to be dexterously used: and he produceth\r\naccordingly in excellent Cuts, the Representations of the Structure of the\r\nsaid _Medulla_ thus taken out, and the _Nerves_, thence proceeding; and\r\nthat of several Animals, Dogs, Swine, Sheep.\r\n\r\nHe intermixes several Observations, touching the _Singleness_ of this\r\n_Medulla_, against _Lindanus_ and others; its _Original_; vid.
