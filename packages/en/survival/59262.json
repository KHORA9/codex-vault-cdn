Contor attended the University of Idaho and Montana State\r\nCollege, concentrating in the fields of zoology, botany, forestry, and\r\nbig game management. His association with the National Park Service\r\nbegan as a seasonal employee in 1949 in Yellowstone where he served\r\nintermittently in various capacities into 1955. Later that year, he\r\njoined the permanent staff of the National Park Service as a park\r\nranger, serving in Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, and Bryce Canyon\r\nNational Parks.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Mr. Contor became management assistant for Oregon Caves\r\nNational Monument, where he remained until early 1962. He then returned\r\nto Rocky Mountain National Park, also as a management assistant.

They had fought their way 15 miles over\r\nwild, rugged mountains since leaving Williams Valley at dawn. Yet rest\r\nwas far from their minds. Hurriedly they stuck tallow candles into\r\nlanterns made from tin cans, untied a lariat from a saddle, then walked\r\ndown the valley. They stopped where the stream, now larger, reappeared\r\nfrom a shadowy crevice under a cliff.\r\n\r\n“This must be it,” said one of them eagerly, “just like Davidson said.”\r\nAnd with mixed feelings of excitement, fear, and the overwhelming grip\r\nof adventure, they followed flickering candlelight into the dark\r\nopening. Tales of persons lost for days in other caves were fresh in\r\ntheir minds, so they uncoiled a ball of string as they went. Later they\r\ncould follow it back out.\r\n\r\nSoon they knew the Davidson story was true, more than true. Crawling\r\nfrom one chamber to another, they found a fairyland of weird grottoes\r\nand exquisite stone formations—pillars and spires, drapes, frozen\r\nwaterfalls and grotesque forms—in shapes and sizes beyond their\r\nimaginations. Some they named from resemblance to familiar objects. At\r\nothers they could only stare in awe and wonder _how can it be?_ Using\r\nthe rope in steep places, they probed upward into another level of\r\ncaverns where they were thrilled to find even more elaborate formations.\r\nAt one place they wrote their names and the date, July 11, 1879. Here\r\nand there they saw evidence left by the few others who had entered the\r\ncave in the five years since it was discovered by their neighbor, Elijah\r\nDavidson. On and on they explored, returning to the entrance only when\r\ntheir last candle was growing short. Outside, stars lighted a midnight\r\nsky. Exhausted, happy, they vowed to return, then fell into bedrolls.\r\n\r\nThus early visitors responded to the lure of Oregon Caves: to see the\r\nunseen and to know the unknown. Today, thousands of people enjoy the\r\ncaves under less demanding circumstances. Yet the joy of personal\r\ndiscovery endures. For each visitor about to enter the cave, the thrill\r\nof learning something new and interesting about the earth beneath us is\r\nborn anew.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, caves loom large in the scope of history. Early\r\nman used them as dwelling and fortifications. Fugitives hid in them and\r\nthieves used them to cache their loot. Others have found them fine\r\nplaces to grow mushrooms. During the War of 1812 and the Civil War,\r\nAmericans mined certain caves for saltpetre which was desperately needed\r\nto make gunpowder. Much of our knowledge of long extinct mammals has\r\nbeen gleaned from perfectly preserved remains, and even prehistoric\r\ndrawings, uncovered by cave-probing scientists.\r\n\r\nTo most of us, however, the greatest value of caves is the delight of\r\nseeing the strange beauties wrought by nature through countless\r\ncenturies. And from this comes the challenge to understand the\r\nimperceptibly slow, relentless forces which produce them. This booklet\r\nsketches the processes which form, alter and eventually destroy caves.\r\nIt is an attempt to share present knowledge with those who visit Oregon\r\nCaves National Monument.\r\n\r\nBefore going on, let us define the word _cave_ as we consider it here.\r\nTrue caves are formed in soluble rock—limestone, marble, gypsum or\r\ndolomite. They usually contain some redeposited mineral in the form of\r\nstalactites, etc. As most caves occur in limestone, the term _limestone\r\ncave_ is often used to describe any true cave, even though it may\r\nactually occur in dolomite or marble. The cave-forming process will be\r\nbasically the same for either type of soluble rock. We exclude from this\r\ndefinition mines, lava tubes, ice caves, and sandstone depressions such\r\nas those used by cliff-dwellers in the Southwest. While they are “holes\r\nin the ground,” they are formed in different ways than are the limestone\r\ntype caves, and therefore are not usually referred to in geological\r\ndiscussions of caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOW OREGON CAVES WERE FORMED\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Raw Material—Rock_\r\n\r\nIf we could turn back some 180 million years into geologic time, we\r\nwould find the North American continent a much different place. This was\r\nthe Triassic Period. Early dinosaurs thrived in primitive forests over\r\nmuch of the United States. The area around southwestern Oregon was not\r\nyet part of the continent; it was a shallow arm of the sea. Smoldering\r\nvolcanoes jutted out as cone-shaped islands or poured forth fumes and\r\nlava from the distant mainland.\r\n\r\nDuring quieter centuries the age-old process of life and death went on\r\nwithin the sea waters. Fish, clams, coral—even tiny one-celled creatures\r\ntoo small to be seen—extracted a mineral called calcium carbonate from\r\nthe water. With it they built bones, shells and skeletons. When these\r\nanimals died, their hard parts settled to the ocean bottom. Gradually,\r\nlayers of calcium carbonate were built up.\r\n\r\nAt the same time certain chemical functions of ocean plants extracted\r\ncarbon dioxide from the water and caused still more calcium carbonate to\r\nprecipitate and add to the sediments. The layers deepened. Eventually\r\nthe weight of overlying sediments and the ocean above compressed them\r\ninto a rock called limestone.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of the sea, and under varied conditions, other ocean\r\nsediments were deposited. Near the shore, wave-swept sand accumulated\r\nand eventually became sandstone. Fine silt and clay carried to the sea\r\nby rivers settled in bluish layers which were to become shale. Near\r\nrocky headlands, course gravel deposits became cemented into a hard mass\r\ncalled conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThis steady formation of sedimentary layers was periodically interrupted\r\nby volcanic activity. Heavy clouds of volcanic ash and fragments settled\r\ninto the sea. Molten lava poured into shallow bays or welled up from\r\nsubsurface volcanoes to mix with calcium carbonate muds. When volcanism\r\nsubsided, the seas went back to the quiet deposition of limestone. Today\r\nat Oregon Caves we find evidence of this interbedding of sedimentary and\r\nvolcanic materials. An example of such interbedding can be seen above\r\nthe parking area near the Chateau.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Marble outcrop]\r\n\r\nThus mixed deposits of volcanic and ocean sediments continued to collect\r\nfor several million years. Apparently this steady transfer of material\r\nfrom one part of the earth’s crust to another created a crustal\r\nimbalance. The edge of the continent was under a strain. Then, like an\r\naccordion, a tremendous folding of the lands along the Pacific Coast\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the sea was lifted above the ocean’s surface to form a new\r\ncoast line in this vicinity. Violent stresses in the earth’s crust\r\ncreated intense heat and pressure which changed, or metamorphosed, the\r\nrocks. Shales were altered to slate. Sandstone became quartzite.\r\nLimestone became the marble so important to Oregon Caves. Even the\r\nvolcanic materials were altered considerably from their original form.\r\nThe resultant geological belt composed of inter-bedded layers of slate,\r\nquartzite, marble, and metamorphosed volcanics is known as the Applegate\r\nGroup.\r\n\r\nAfter the uplift, there was a long period of crustal stability. The\r\nfolded mountains were eroded away and the area became a flattened plain\r\nnear sea level. As a result, its streams were sluggish and meandered\r\nslowly to the ocean. Then, in various stages, the plain was uplifted in\r\nanother period of crustal adjustments which produced a flat-topped\r\nplateau, so to speak, known as the ancient Klamath Peneplane. This\r\nrestored the vigor of the stream erosion, which helped at times by\r\nglacier sculpture, dissected the plateau into the mountains we know\r\ntoday. The Siskiyou Range surrounding Oregon Caves National Monument is\r\npart of the Klamath Mountain System.\r\n\r\nLet us focus on one of the ancient marble layers of the Applegate Group,\r\nfor this is the rock strata in which Oregon Caves were formed. It is\r\nactually a narrow, tilted belt, varying in thickness up to 400 feet. It\r\ndips eastward into the earth at an angle of about 60° and can be\r\nfollowed in a southwest-northeast direction for about 4 miles along the\r\nwest shoulder of Mt. Elijah (see illustrations on page 4). Examination\r\nof the marble layers inside the exit tunnel or the outcrop at the\r\nbeginning of Cliff Nature Trail reveals many fractures caused by the\r\nstresses of upheaval. Some are vertical cracks, but there are also many\r\ncross fractures at varying angles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Oregon Caves marble—8 inches wide]\r\n\r\nWhen tested for chemical composition, Oregon Caves marble samples have\r\naveraged 93 percent pure calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). Its bluish color is\r\nderived from the remaining percentage of impurities. Without these, it\r\nwould be white. A good example of nearly pure calcium carbonate is the\r\nwhite chalk used on blackboards.\r\n\r\nWithout this belt of soluble marble, and without the fractures within\r\nit, natural processes could not have produced the “Marble Halls of\r\nOregon.” It is the foundation, the framework, and the raw material of\r\nthe caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Underground Erosion_\r\n\r\nThe first requirement in the genesis of Oregon Caves—the right kind of\r\nrock—was met. Next came the erosive agent which was to carve it into\r\ncaverns. This was the flow of underground water.\r\n\r\nThe present rainfall in this area averages 50 inches a year. During the\r\nmany thousands of years the caves were forming, the climate may have\r\nvaried from wetter to drier many times, but it is safe to assume this\r\nhas always been an area of relatively heavy precipitation. The steep,\r\nmountainous terrain and deep-cut valleys of southwestern Oregon are\r\ncharacteristic of aggressive stream erosion that goes hand-in-hand with\r\na healthy supply of rainfall.\r\n\r\nSome of the rain evaporates and returns to the air. Some of it soon runs\r\ninto streams and is carried rapidly to the ocean. The rest of it seeps\r\ninto the ground where it is delayed for a time in its inevitable return\r\nto the sea. Under the force of gravity, it trickles downward rather\r\nsteeply through joints and cracks in the rocks, or seeps between\r\nparticles of sand, gravel, or clay. Below the ground surface it joins a\r\nzone of saturation, or _phreatic zone_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _GROUND WATER_]\r\n\r\n  RAIN FALL\r\n  } _Vadose zone: water moves from surface to water table (vertically)_\r\n  —_Water table_\r\n  } _Phreatic zone: total saturation, water moves slowly and nearly\r\n          (horizontally)_\r\n\r\nHere cracks, pores, and all spaces within the rock are completely filled\r\nwith water. There are no airspaces. Water movement within the phreatic\r\nzone is comparatively slow, varying from a few inches a year to a few\r\nfeet a day, depending upon the permeability of the rock structure. And\r\nthe movement is usually horizontal, following the contours of the land\r\nin the same direction as surface streams. Eventually this water will\r\nfind its way back to the surface at a lower elevation where it usually\r\nemerges as a spring. It is phreatic water which feeds the mountain\r\nstreams and rivers many weeks or months after the last rainfall. It\r\nmight also be pumped from a well for human use. A large portion of the\r\nearth’s population depends upon well water from these great underground\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\nHow deep does phreatic water exist? This depends upon the porosity of\r\nthe rock, or its ability to contain water. Most mines that penetrate\r\nmany hundreds of feet encounter little water at great depths. Pressure\r\nof the overlying rocks is so great that open spaces capable of holding\r\nwater cannot exist. So the earth’s crust contains available well water\r\nonly in restricted zones not far from the surface. The top of the zone\r\nof saturation is called the _water table_. It is here that the most\r\nrapid flow of phreatic water occurs, for the joints and interspaces are\r\nwider nearest the surface. Between the water table and the surface is\r\nthe _vadose zone_, in which the spaces are partly filled with water and\r\npartly filled with air. (See illustrations on page 7). Vadose water\r\ncontent varies greatly with weather conditions. As rainfall is scant in\r\nsouthwest Oregon during the summer, visitors find the caves relatively\r\ndry at that time. In the winter, however, the passages will be veritably\r\n“raining” vadose water within a few days after snow or rain.\r\n\r\nThe water table itself is more stable, but varies somewhat from winter\r\nto summer, or during extended periods of unusually wet or dry seasons.\r\nIts lowest possible level is ultimately controlled by the elevation of\r\nthe largest nearby surface stream or lake, which acts as a base level.\r\nWhen the streams and lakes are lowered by erosion, the water table of a\r\ngiven locality keeps pace by slowly sinking until eventually it lies\r\nscarcely above sea level.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Solution Rills in Ghost Room ceiling]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Crack widened by solution—Watson’s Grotto]\r\n\r\nRain falling on the mountains above the cave seeps into the surface\r\ncover of vegetation and humus. Here it absorbs carbon dioxide released\r\nfrom the process of organic decay. Seeping further through the vadose\r\nzone and down to the water table, this water carries many times the\r\nnormal amount of carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere. In fact, it\r\nbecomes acid. For water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) unite to form a\r\nmild solution of _carbonic acid_ (H₂CO₃). In this manner, phreatic water\r\nis constantly charged with mild acids. Not the kind that harm us, of\r\ncourse. The fountain water by the chalet, and probably that in your\r\nhome, is actually mild carbonic acid. So is bottled pop.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n                               _SOLUTION_\r\n\r\n      RAIN      +  CARBON DIOXIDE   =        MILD CARBONIC ACID\r\n                      MOLECULES\r\n      (H₂O)             (CO₂)                     (H₂CO₃)\r\n  CARBONIC ACID +      CALCIUM      =   CALCIUM BICARBONATE SOLUTION\r\n                      CARBONATE\r\n                   MOLECULES FROM\r\n                    MARBLE STRATA\r\n     (H₂CO₃)           (CaCO₃)                  (CaH₂(CO₃)₂)\r\n\r\n                              _DEPOSITION_\r\n\r\n      CALCIUM      CARBON DIOXIDE,   FOR EACH CARBON DIOXIDE MOLECULE\r\n    BICARBONATE   CALCIUM CARBONATE     ESCAPING INTO CAVE AIR, AN\r\n   REACHING CAVE                      EQUIVALENT MOLECULE OF CALCIUM\r\n        AIR                          CARBONATE MUST BE REDEPOSITED AS\r\n                                     SOLID DRIPSTONE, FLOWSTONE, ETC.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that phreatic water, charged with soil acids, percolated\r\ncentury after century through cracks in the marble. The acids ate away\r\nat all exposed rock surfaces—sideward, downward, and upward. (The\r\nsolution rills in the original Ghost Room ceiling reveal the upward\r\ndissolving of water-filled cavities, see illustration page 9). To fully\r\nunderstand this, we must recall that the marble is 93 percent _calcium\r\ncarbonate_ (CaCO₃). To dissolve it, carbonic acid mixes with the calcium\r\ncarbonate to form an unstable liquid compound called _calcium\r\nbicarbonate_, (CaH₂(CO₃)₂). The removal of solid calcium carbonate in a\r\nliquid is the key cave forming process and is called _solution_ (see\r\nillustration page 10). In Watson’s Grotto we find several examples of\r\nearly crack-widening by phreatic solution (see illustration page 9).\r\n\r\nThe enlarged cracks allowed faster movement of water against an\r\nincreased surface area, and a subsequent increase in solution activity.\r\nPartitions between them fell apart and were dissolved. A series of\r\nwater-filled passages evolved deep underground. Their pattern and\r\norientation followed the pre-cave network of joints and cracks in the\r\noriginal strata. Gradually the openings were further enlarged into the\r\ncave system we know today.\r\n\r\nThere is more to it than that, of course. You may ask, “Why aren’t there\r\ncaves continuously throughout the belt of marble? The joints and cracks\r\nare everywhere. And certainly all the marble near the surface has been\r\nsubjected to ground water action at some time or another. Why are Oregon\r\nCaves limited to one particular part of the marble belt?”\r\n\r\nThe answer to this involves several considerations. To begin with, we do\r\nfind small cavities and solution cracks throughout the exposed marble.\r\nSo there has been varying degrees of solution activity nearly\r\neverywhere, although not sufficient to produce caverns comparable to\r\nOregon Caves.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we must reconsider the mineralized water, calcium bicarbonate.\r\nWe called it an _unstable_ compound, meaning it will alter readily with\r\nslight changes in conditions. Once the amount of carbon dioxide\r\ndissolved in the water has united with an equivalent amount of calcium\r\ncarbonate (marble), the solution is saturated. No more marble can be\r\ndissolved until additional carbon dioxide is absorbed by the water. If\r\nthe solution loses some of its carbon dioxide into the air, then an\r\nequivalent amount of calcium carbonate must be redeposited as solid\r\nstone. The balance can be delicate. In an underground pool of\r\nmineralized water, _solution_ may be going on at one end of the pool and\r\n_deposition_ at the other.\r\n\r\nSo a state of chemical balance tends to develop in normal phreatic drift\r\nthrough the marble. Water saturated with minerals might easily move\r\nthrough many hundreds of feet of marble strata without further enlarging\r\nthe openings. Instead, it might even deposit some of the dissolved\r\nminerals, filling small cracks and veins, possibly even blocking its own\r\npassage during dry cycles when phreatic flow is at a low ebb. The “dry”\r\nroom in the cave is an example of vein filling. Clay, gravel, and other\r\nsurface sediments can also be washed into the openings, plugging them up\r\nand halting further solution for a time. All these factors lead toward a\r\nstabilization of the solution process. Openings and small passages\r\ncontinue to be formed, yet normal phreatic movement at Oregon Caves\r\nseems to lack the force for large scale cave sculpture.\r\n\r\nThis opens the door to our third consideration; we know the greatest\r\namount of solution occurs in the water table zone. Therefore, to gain\r\nthe impetus needed to carve out a cave system, some local condition must\r\nhave _increased the water table flow_ in the immediate vicinity of\r\nOregon Caves. The solution process was magnified as larger quantities of\r\nfreshly acidic phreatic waters were channeled into a restricted zone.\r\nSurging on, they scoured through the marble, dissolving larger volumes\r\nof calcium carbonate and sweeping it away. The early solution pattern of\r\nenlarged cracks had set the stage for the onset of this swift phreatic\r\nerosion. But some geologically sudden event was necessary to trigger the\r\nforces which completed the act.\r\n\r\nWe do not know exactly what the triggering action was. We know that the\r\nwater table either received a _sudden increase in supply_ from surface\r\ndrainage, or found a _larger or lower outlet_ downslope which tapped\r\nphreatic water over a widespread zone and channeled it through a\r\nlocalized area. There are several possibilities.\r\n\r\n  1. A perched water table may have been held in the cave zone by a\r\n  lower and impervious layer of rock. This barrier may have been\r\n  suddenly cut through by erosion, as if the plug were pulled in a\r\n  bathtub. The perched water would now pass _through_ the barrier,\r\n  rather than over it, evacuating parts of the former phreatic zone, and\r\n  inducing surface streams to channel underground through the same\r\n  route. With such a subterranean diversion of water from a higher to a\r\n  lower drainage pattern, the water table flow would increase\r\n  considerably. A cave-forming condition would exist.\r\n\r\n  Several small streams lose their identity and sink into the ground a\r\n  few hundred yards above the caves. Doubtless, they join the water\r\n  table inside the caverns to emerge at the entrance as the River Styx\r\n  (called Cave Creek outside). Possibly they aided in the early stages\r\n  of cave formation in a manner described above.\r\n\r\n  2. It is difficult to imagine what the surface topography was like\r\n  when the cave was forming, yet we know it hasn’t always been the same.\r\n  The mountains were higher. The streams occupied higher positions in\r\n  the valleys. The ridges lay in a somewhat different pattern. Now and\r\n  then stream piracy, or drainage rearrangement, took place when a\r\n  rapidly eroding stream cut away the ridge separating it from a less\r\n  active stream. Suddenly the slower stream was diverted into the\r\n  drainage system of its captor. Both surface and phreatic waters of the\r\n  aggressive drainage were increased. The flow at the water table\r\n  speeded up in response.\r\n\r\n  If stream piracy occurred in the drainage overlying the caves, it\r\n  might have played an important part in cave carving.\r\n\r\n  3. Nor can we omit the conditions that occurred here during periods of\r\n  glaciation. Shifting masses of ice and glacial debris\r\n  characteristically cause damming and rechanneling of water in minor\r\n  stream valleys. The temporary results are similar to stream piracy.\r\n  Coupled with this is the great volume of water which drains from\r\n  melting glaciers. Evidence of partial glaciation in the Siskiyou\r\n  Mountains lends serious consideration to its effect on early cave\r\n  development.\r\n\r\nThe whole process might have involved all three of the above situations\r\nin varying degrees, for a “geologically sudden” event may take several\r\nthousand years. Several distinct levels of cave erosion indicate that\r\nthe water table moved along at a certain level for a time, then rapidly\r\ndropped to a lower course where it was stable for another extended\r\nperiod. This was repeated until it now stands near the level of the\r\nRiver Styx.\r\n\r\nSuccessively, the caverns at higher levels were drained and left empty.\r\nSo as your tour climbs from the cave entrance to the highly developed\r\nsections near the Ghost Room, you encounter galleries that are\r\nprogressively older. The first room inside the entrance, Watson’s\r\nGrotto, is the best example we have of a cavern “recently” drained.\r\n\r\nA word about the River Styx. Above it in several places you can see very\r\nsmooth walls left by the familiar erosive action of a stream. (See\r\nillustration page 14). Most of the cave walls show the more pitted,\r\nconcave surface left by the acidic dissolving action of phreatic water.\r\nThe water which produced the main cave system moved much slower than the\r\nRiver Styx, and over a wider area. The stream as we see it did not\r\nproduce the cave. Rather, the caverns, when drained, left a free flowing\r\ncourse for ground water to channel into. The only true underground\r\nstreams occur in caves. They are a by-product of the cave-forming\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Smooth-walled erosion of River Styx]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decoration_\r\n\r\nSurface erosion continued to tear away at the mountains. Streams cut\r\ntheir valleys deeper. In response, the water table gradually sank below\r\nthe level of the caverns and they, in turn, were drained. Air entered\r\nthe rooms. The basic excavation process was completed except for a few\r\nminor changes: In some places, vadose water continued to dissolve away\r\nportions of the cave ceilings into dome shapes. In other rooms\r\npreviously drained, water re-flooded certain portions during wet cycles.\r\nAnd some rooms were filled with clay and gravel brought in from the\r\nsurface, then washed clean again in later stages.\r\n\r\nMost important is the entrance of air, which ushered in the second major\r\nstage in cave formation. The unadorned grottoes were now to be\r\ndecorated. Nature, through the process of _deposition_, next created the\r\neerie beauty which delights today’s cave visitors. In fact the process\r\ncontinues even now, for Oregon Caves are “live” caves, meaning they are\r\nstill being decorated by natural deposition.\r\n\r\nThe weak carbonic acid in vadose water kept eating away the roof marble\r\nabove the caves. Reaching the caverns, drops of vadose water evaporated\r\ninto the air and left their load of calcium carbonate as thin layers of\r\nsolid mineral. The amount left by each drop was infinitesimal, yet\r\nmillions of drops eventually left thick deposits coated on the walls,\r\nceilings and floors of the cave. The crusty white deposits in the\r\nBeehive Room are fine examples of deposition by _evaporation_. They were\r\nleft there in much the same way as the coating in the bottom of a\r\nteakettle or steam iron.\r\n\r\nHowever, evaporation is important only near the surface. Deeper inside\r\nOregon Caves the relative humidity averages 98 percent. Evaporation here\r\nis almost non-existent. Instead, _loss of carbon dioxide_ becomes the\r\nchief agent of deposition. We have learned that vadose water contains 25\r\nto 90 times the normal amount of carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere.\r\nMuch of it, of course, unites with calcium carbonate to form calcium\r\nbicarbonate solution. When this mineralized water reaches the caverns,\r\nlarge quantities of carbon dioxide are able to escape into the air due\r\nto the difference in carbon dioxide amounts in the water and air. The\r\nchemical balance is upset. For each molecule of escaping carbon dioxide,\r\nan equivalent molecule of solid mineral is deposited (see illustrations\r\npage 10).\r\n\r\nAn interesting side effect of the loss of carbon dioxide is experienced\r\nby the cave visitor. Although cave air is constantly replenished by\r\noutside air through natural exchange, it has a rather high carbon\r\ndioxide content due to release of this gas by vadose waters. This partly\r\nexplains the heavy breathing you find necessary inside the cave, because\r\nthe nerve centers which control our breathing are stimulated by a high\r\npercentage of carbon dioxide in the air we breathe. It also explains the\r\nodd “peroxide” odor many people notice when they reach the exit. The\r\nodor is oxygen. We notice it because our senses have become adjusted to\r\nslightly lower oxygen percentages inside the cave.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cave deposits in Joaquin Miller’s Chapel]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Drapery in Ghost Room]\r\n\r\nCave deposits are collectively termed _speleothems_. Their variety is\r\ninfinite: Those left by dripping water are called _dripstone_, and take\r\non two basic forms—if they hang down from the ceiling they are called\r\n_Stalactites_, if they grow up from the floor they are _stalagmites_.\r\nThe two may join together to form a column. Where the water drips\r\nrapidly and the loss of carbon dioxide is slow, stalagmite growth is\r\nfavored because little deposition can take place on the ceiling. If the\r\ndrip rate is slow and loss of carbon dioxide is rapid, stalactite\r\nformation is favored.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Formations on page 16]\r\n\r\nContrasted with dripstone is _flowstone_—smooth layered deposits left\r\nalong walls and floors by flowing water. In Joaquin Miller’s Chapel,\r\nflowstone deposits are many inches thick. (See illustration on page 16).\r\nA close look at the structure of dripstone and flowstone reveals\r\nsix-sided crystals called _calcite_, which is merely the crystalline\r\nform of calcium carbonate. (See illustration on page 19). Banded crystal\r\nlayers in cave deposits are often called alabaster, or cave onyx. These\r\ncan be easily seen at the “wishing post.”\r\n\r\nOther shapes and forms accrue. Flowstone forming on backsloping walls\r\ntends to produce graceful sheets called _drapery_. (See illustration on\r\npage 17). Reddish bands may develop in drapery where iron oxide is\r\nimbedded with the calcite. Contrasted with the pure white layers of\r\ncalcium carbonate, this gives the appearance of _bacon_. Good examples\r\nof “bacon” can be seen in the Ghost Room.\r\n\r\nMost shapes and forms of dripstone and flowstone are occasionally\r\nduplicated by freezing water. Stalactites form on the edges of roofs,\r\nstalagmites form on the sidewalk beneath them, etc. But one of several\r\ncave formations which can’t be thus copied is the _soda straw_ (see\r\nillustration page 20). Deposition begins as a ring of calcium carbonate\r\naround a water drop. The ring has the unique feature of being a single\r\ncrystal. As more drops leave their deposits, the ringed crystals form\r\none on the other to create a tube. The water continues to seep through\r\nthe inside of the tube, eventually producing the fragile, crystalline\r\npipe with the obvious name.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of a soda straw is apparently determined by the specific\r\ngravity and surface tension of water, for they are all nearly the same\r\ndiameter, about one-quarter inch. In a cave in western Australia one\r\nsoda straw has reached a length of 20 feet, 6 inches, yet is still only\r\none-quarter inch in diameter. If the drip rate decreases, the tip of the\r\nsoda straw may sometimes seal itself closed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Calcite crystals in layer of flowstone, 8 inches\r\n    high.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nSome speleothems apparently defy gravity. Now and then internal\r\nhydrostatic pressure causes secondary formations to project out from\r\nothers in unusual directions. These are _helictites_ (see illustration\r\non page 21). A related form is _popcorn_ (see illustration on page 22),\r\nthe mat of small nodules which coat the “beehive” and other objects in\r\nthe cave. Also called “cave coral,” popcorn can form under water or\r\nalong wet walls in response to air currents.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Helictite formed on soda straw]\r\n\r\nSoft, fibrous mats of calcium carbonate deposited near the surface at\r\nOregon Caves are termed _moonmilk_. In time moonmilk may harden into\r\npopcorn mats. Its manner of formation is not fully understood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Popcorn in Adam’s Tomb]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rimstone]\r\n\r\nAt the “Devil’s Washboard,” and at the foot of Paradise Lost, we find\r\nstill another type of speleothem—_rimstone_—which forms in pools of\r\nwater. Agitated by dripping or flowing water, some of the carbon dioxide\r\nin the pool escapes. The resultant deposition of mineral takes place on\r\nirregularities in the bottom of the pool, or creates stone wavelets\r\nwhere the pool spills over. Ridges and dams subsequently build up, often\r\nconstricting the pool surface (see illustration on page 22). Another\r\ntype of rimstone, or _cave ice_, develops when flowstone builds up\r\naround the edge of a pool and gradually closes across it. The pool may\r\nbe completely sealed over, just like a pond in winter, except that “cave\r\nice” can never melt.\r\n\r\nCave students are often confused by another deposition found in the form\r\nof thin _blades_ jutting out of the wall (see illustration below). They\r\nhave a woven, crystalline texture. Prior to removal by solution, some of\r\nthe marble cracks were filled with calcium carbonate. Being less soluble\r\nthan marble, the sheets of calcite crystals remain for a time after the\r\nsurrounding rock is dissolved away.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Blade formation]\r\n\r\nSo far we have discussed cave features—_speleothems_—created by\r\ndeposition of mineral from the solid to liquid, and back to solid state.\r\nBut certain objects in the caves are simply what remains of a piece of\r\nmarble after some of it is dissolved away. These are _speleogens_, cave\r\nfeatures created by the dissolving of mineral (see illustration page 24\r\n). They can be striking, but primarily it is the _speleothems_ which\r\nmake Oregon Caves a thing of wonder and beauty. The zenith of such\r\nspectacular development as seen at Paradise Lost leaves little doubt of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have followed the mineral calcium carbonate through many forms: from\r\nsea creatures to ocean mud, to limestone and then marble, next to a\r\nliquid solution called calcium bicarbonate, and lastly as calcite\r\ncrystals in cave formations. The size, shape and variety of cave\r\ndeposits are determined by many factors which seem to prevent any two\r\nbeing exactly alike. Changes in temperature, relative humidity,\r\navailable carbon dioxide, amounts of vadose water, air circulation,\r\nsurface tension, permeability of roof rock, vegetation above the cave,\r\nbacteria action, and the amount and kind of impurities in vadose water\r\nmay all combine to vary the nature of cave formations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Detail in Paradise Lost]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Speleogen above River Styx]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave’s Age_\r\n\r\nThe many variables make it difficult to accurately estimate the age of\r\ncave deposits. We have no way of determining past conditions which have\r\ninfluenced the rate of development. Oh, we know the formations are many\r\nthousands of years old, beyond that we can only guess. Some crude\r\nexamples of known age are the tiny, one-half-inch stalactites formed in\r\nthe exit tunnel since it was completed some 38 years ago (see\r\nillustration below). Bathed in warm, dry air from the outside, they have\r\nprobably developed much faster than those inside the main cave. Other\r\nactive formations deep in the cave show very little visible depositing\r\nover names written on them by early explorers in the 1880’s. So the true\r\nsecret of the age of the formations must rest with the cave itself.\r\nPerhaps this is best.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stalactites formed since exit tunnel was completed in\r\n    1933]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Cave Features_\r\n\r\nAn obvious feature you may see in Neptune’s Grotto is the brown lacework\r\non the walls. They are lines of clay. Molecular attraction causes the\r\nclay particles to cling together into what we call _clay worms_. (See\r\nillustrations on page 27). Where does the clay come from? Some of it may\r\nbe washed in from the ground above. The rest of it is the remnant of\r\nmarble solution. Oregon Caves marble is 93 percent calcium carbonate.\r\nThe remaining 7 percent is non-soluble clay and remains in the cave\r\nafter the calcium carbonate is carried away in fluid state. Clay worms\r\nare temporary features; vadose water or the touch of a careless hand can\r\neasily remove them.\r\n\r\nIn the Ghost Room we find an interesting object. Projecting from the\r\nceiling is an 8-inch thick slab of angular brown rock. Its edges have\r\nbeen broken, rather than dissolved. This is a _clastic dike_. Evidence\r\nis lacking to definitely state its origin or manner of emplacement. But\r\nat some time in the past, there was an extensive crack in the marble\r\nwhich was filled by a mudlike material made up of bits of quartz,\r\nplagioclase, horneblende, epidote, clay, and other minor ingredients. It\r\nmay have been washed in from the surface, or it could have been injected\r\nfrom below by earthquake shocks which cracked the marble and forced the\r\npliable material into the cracks.\r\n\r\nEventually it hardened into rock. Due to its non-soluble ingredients,\r\nthe dike was not dissolved when the Ghost Room was formed. Like the\r\n“blades” we discussed previously, it remained as a projection into the\r\nroom while the marble walls receded under solution activity. Being\r\nbrittle, it has apparently been broken off periodically by the jar of\r\nearthquakes or cave collapse.\r\n\r\nAnother obvious discrepancy in the marble framework of the caves is the\r\nthin layer of slate found in the 65-foot tunnel. This reveals an\r\ninterruption in the limestone sedimentation of the Triassic sea. A thin\r\nlayer of shale was deposited between limestone layers. Later, when the\r\nlimestone became marble, the shale became slate. It should be mentioned\r\nhere that limestone and shale vary greatly in their contents and often\r\ninterblend with each other. “Pure” limestone is white. Different shades\r\noccur with different amounts of claylike impurities. When the impurities\r\novershadow the limestone, then the rock may be called shale. The whitest\r\nmarble in Oregon Caves came from the purest limestone. The darker,\r\nblue-banded marble is rich in slate impurities.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The lacework effect of clay “worms”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LIFE IN THE CAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Indians of southwest Oregon knew of Oregon Caves they left no\r\nevidence of the fact. Possibly its remote and rugged setting was too far\r\naway from their normal haunts near the fertile valleys and salmon-rich\r\nrivers. Or they may have known of the cave, but superstitions forbade\r\ntheir entering it. To our knowledge, Elijah Davidson was the first\r\nperson to penetrate its depths.\r\n\r\nOther creatures used it regularly. Bears, mountain lions, coyotes,\r\nbobcats, skunks and other predators found the outer chambers ideal dens\r\nor resting places. Within the “twilight zone”—the galleries near the\r\nsurface where some light penetrates—rodents of several kinds entered\r\nfreely and even made nests. Today, we find the industrious woodrat still\r\ngathering mounds of sticks, leaves, flashbulbs, and hairpins to store\r\nnear the 110-foot exit. Mice and rabbits are frequently seen in the\r\ncave. Occasionally the tracks of the ringtail betray his secretive\r\nhunting trips into the cave. In 1935, even a mountain beaver was found\r\nin the Ghost Room.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is only one mammal truly adjusted to normal living inside\r\nthe dark portions of the caves. This is the bat. (See illustration\r\nbelow). There are eight species of bats that use Oregon Caves. Most\r\ncommon is the long-eared myotis. None are abundant, and most visitors do\r\nnot see them, for this is not a “bat cave” in the same sense as Carlsbad\r\nand other caves. Also, the bats prefer the undisturbed sections of the\r\ncaves, where people seldom enter. In spite of this, they attract much\r\ninterest and are the subject of much discussion. The only mammal capable\r\nof flight, bats are also unique in their ability to fly in total\r\ndarkness deep within caves.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hibernating bat in “dry” room]\r\n\r\nThis latter skill puzzled scientists for many years until, in the\r\n1930’s, it was learned that bats navigate in darkness by echo-location,\r\na system similar to the Navy’s sonar. The animal emits high-pitched\r\nsqueaks, above the threshold of human hearing. The echo of the squeaks\r\nbounces off nearby objects and the bat is able to decipher, from a flood\r\nof up to sixty echoes a second, the size, shape, and distance of objects\r\nbefore them. So precise is this system that the animal is able to locate\r\nand capture flying insects in pitch darkness. Not only can they navigate\r\nin the dark, they can also remember echo patterns that help them to\r\nreturn again and again to the same place deep inside a cave.\r\n\r\nThey feed at night, eating great numbers of insects. In winter a few of\r\nthem hibernate in Oregon Caves and may be easily observed clinging head\r\ndownward from the walls and ceilings for months at a time. During a\r\nbat-banding study a few years ago, 750 bats were fitted with tiny\r\naluminum identification bands and released. To date, however, none of\r\nthese bats have been found elsewhere, nor have any foreign bands turned\r\nup here. Some bats are migratory, for each year in late August or\r\nSeptember there is an influx of several hundred that may be seen in the\r\ncaves for only a few days. Then they are gone again.\r\n\r\nCertain arthropods—millepedes, spiders, moths and small wingless insects\r\ncalled collemboles—are abundant in the “twilight zone” of the caves,\r\nwhere they feed on organic matter and upon each other. Thus animal life\r\nin the cave is more prominent than many people suspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plant Life_\r\n\r\nWhen the cave lights were installed in 1932, conditions were established\r\nfor the entrance of another type of life—plants. Carried into the cave\r\nby water or air currents, spores of primitive plants could now germinate\r\nand live. Near the light fixtures we find interesting colonies. The\r\ngreen coating several feet from the lights are clusters of _algae_. They\r\nhave no leaves, stems or roots; in fact they are the simplest and most\r\nuniversal of the earth’s green plants. They require much less light\r\nenergy than the _mosses_ which grow only a few inches from the lights.\r\nIn one or two places we also find fleshy green _liverworts_ which look\r\nlike blobs of spilled paint. And now and then we find the cave’s highest\r\ntype of plants, the _sword ferns_. Diminutive in comparison with their\r\nkin outside the cave, these tiny ferns are nevertheless able to survive\r\nnear the lights which burn at least part of every day during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next? Like lakes and waterfalls, caves are temporary features of\r\nthe drainage pattern of an area. The same processes which produce them\r\nwill eventually destroy them. At Paradise Lost we see that an\r\nappreciable part of the original room has already been filled with cave\r\ndeposits. Many side passages in the caves have similarly been blocked\r\noff by the accumulation of flowstone.\r\n\r\nOn the outside, surface erosion will wear away the roof rock until the\r\ncaverns collapse. The rooms will be filled with sunlight and exposed to\r\nrapid weathering. The calcium carbonate that was laid down in the\r\nTriassic sea, then lifted into mountains, then changed to calcite cave\r\ndeposits, will again be dissolved by water and carried back to the sea.\r\nWe know this because remnants of other caves reveal the pattern of\r\ncreation and destruction common to all caves. The end will not come at\r\nOregon Caves for thousands or millions of years. But it will come. The\r\nwork of water and other erosive forces never ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HUMAN STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon Caves have been known since a day in 1874 when Elijah J. Davidson\r\nwent hunting in the Siskiyou Mountains. The story goes that, after\r\nkilling a deer, he followed his dog to a large hole in the mountain.\r\nHere he heard sounds of fighting coming from within. Being undecided as\r\nto what to do, he stood waiting—then his dog gave vent to a weird howl,\r\nas if in great pain. Hesitating no longer, Davidson rushed into the\r\nopening. He soon found the chase difficult to pursue without a light,\r\nwhereupon he resorted to a few matches that he had in his shot-pouch.\r\nStriking match after match, he expected that he would soon be at the\r\nscene of the struggle.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving there, however, his supply of matches gave out, leaving\r\nhim in the dark. Davidson finally found his way back to a running stream\r\nof water, and following it, came to the mouth of the cave. Soon after,\r\nthe dog came splashing down the creek, unhurt. As it was well on in the\r\nevening, Davidson decided to go back to camp and return the next day.\r\nBefore leaving, however, he placed near the entrance to the cave the\r\nbuck he had recently killed. He anticipated that a bear would come out\r\nfor food, eat all it could and then lie down by the remaining part.\r\nReturning early the next morning, Davidson found a monstrous black bear\r\nlying near the carcass of the deer.\r\n\r\nDavidson told others of his discovery, and the cave soon became an\r\nattraction for the adventuresome, portions of it being explored and\r\nopened. Early interest in commercializing the cave were thwarted by its\r\nremote location, far from roads and populous communities.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Joaquin Miller, the “Poet of the Sierra,” and Chandler B.\r\nWatson, author of _Prehistoric Siskiyou Island_ and the _Marble Halls of\r\nOregon_, visited the cave. They were highly impressed and promoted the\r\ncave as the “Marble Halls of Oregon.” Public attention was aroused and\r\nthe cave was established as Oregon Caves National Monument on July 12,\r\n1909. (See illustration on page 32).\r\n\r\nAppreciable public use was not attained until 1922, when an automobile\r\nroad was completed to the caves. The next year, 1923, the Forest Service\r\ngranted a concession to the Oregon Caves Company, which has provided\r\npublic accommodations and cave guide service since then.\r\n\r\nIn 1933, the Monument was transferred to the National Park System.\r\nConcurrently, the completion of the 512-foot exit tunnel that same year\r\ngreatly improved cave tour circulation. The public use pattern,\r\nrelatively unchanged for the next three decades, was established after\r\nthe opening of the concessioner’s chateau building in 1934. The chateau\r\nis noted for its charming architecture, complementing the steep,\r\nforested setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon Caves have been set aside as a national monument because of their\r\noutstanding natural features. The National Park Service is charged by\r\nCongress to provide for the public use and enjoyment of the area “in\r\nsuch manner and by such means as will leave it unimpaired for ... future\r\ngenerations.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A visit to Oregon Caves in 1912]\r\n\r\nNatural things and natural processes are paramount. Manmade facilities\r\nsuch as trails, lights and steps are necessary to allow visitors to\r\nenjoy the cave. But they are kept at a minimum. Your guide will ask you\r\nnot to touch any of the cave formations. This is to keep them from being\r\nstained or broken. Prior to the establishment of the National Monument\r\nin 1909, fragile formations were the object of severe vandalism and\r\nthoughtless destruction by souvenir hunters (see illustration page 33).\r\nIt is doubly important to preserve the remaining features for the\r\nbenefit of those who will come here tomorrow and in later years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Vandalism: Nature required many thousands of years to\r\n    create these stalactites. A thoughtless person needed only a few\r\n    moments to destroy them.]\r\n\r\nOutside the cave, the Monument is a place where flowers are enjoyed in\r\ntheir natural state and not picked, where birds and wild animals are\r\nunmolested by hunters or trappers. The forest is undisturbed. On the\r\ntrails away from the cave area, the hiker may see animals and plants\r\nfulfilling their existence as they did centuries ago. It is to this\r\nphilosophy that the national parks and monuments are dedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GLOSSARY OF CAVE TERMS\r\n\r\n\r\nBacon\r\n      A thin sheet of calcite drapery having alternating dark and light\r\n      bands which give it the appearance of a strip of bacon. The dark,\r\n      reddish bands are usually caused by an iron oxide stain.\r\n\r\nBedding plane\r\n      The stratification or meeting place of two different layers of\r\n      sedimentary rock.\r\n\r\nBlade\r\n      A calcite sheet originally deposited in a crack, then later\r\n      exposed.\r\n\r\nBreakdown\r\n      Heaps of rubble on a cavern floor caused by the collapse of walls\r\n      or ceiling.\r\n\r\nCalcium bicarbonate\r\n      An unstable compound occurring when carbonic acid contacts calcium\r\n      carbonate.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbonate\r\n      A mineral with the chemical formula CaCO₃.\r\n\r\nCalcite\r\n      A crystalline form of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid\r\n      A weak acid occurring as a liquid, having the formula H₂CO₃, a\r\n      mixture of carbon dioxide and water.\r\n\r\nClastic dike\r\n      A dike made up of fragments of pre-existing rocks.\r\n\r\nColumn\r\n      A speleothem formed when a stalactite and a stalagmite meet.\r\n\r\nDeposit\r\n      A natural occurrence of mineral material, such as an iron ore\r\n      deposit; or in the vocabulary of the speleologist, any cave\r\n      formation originating from deposition.\r\n\r\nDrapery\r\n      Hanging speleothem in the form of a curtain or drape.\r\n\r\nDripstone\r\n      A calcite deposit left by dripping water.\r\n\r\nFlowstone\r\n      A calcite deposit left by flowing water along a cave wall or\r\n      floor.\r\n\r\nFracture\r\n      A break in rock.\r\n\r\nGallery\r\n      An underground passage.\r\n\r\nGround water\r\n      Water within the earth, such as feeds wells.\r\n\r\nHelictite\r\n      A variant form of stalactite which does not hang vertically or\r\n      which has side growths resembling twisted roots.\r\n\r\nJoint\r\n      A crack, which in limestone forms at an angle to a bedding plane.\r\n      A series of joints often intersect each other in a four-sided\r\n      pattern.\r\n\r\nLimestone\r\n      A rock consisting chiefly of calcium carbonate, usually an\r\n      accumulation of organic remains such as shells.\r\n\r\nMarble\r\n      Limestone crystallized by metamorphism.\r\n\r\nMetamorphose\r\n      To change into a different form, such as changing sedimentary rock\r\n      (limestone) into a metamorphic rock (marble).\r\n\r\nMoonmilk\r\n      A rare form of hydromagnesite or calcium carbonate which is\r\n      semisolid.\r\n\r\nPhreatic zone\r\n      The region, below the water table, in which rock is saturated with\r\n      water.\r\n\r\nPopcorn\r\n      Nodules of mineral deposits formed in such a way as to resemble\r\n      popcorn.\r\n\r\nRimstone\r\n      A calcite deposit around the edge of a pool of water.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rock\r\n      Formed from deposits of sediments or from fragments of other\r\n      minerals.\r\n\r\nShale\r\n      A sedimentary rock formed from deposits of clay or silt.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n      The process by which a substance is chemically combined with a\r\n      liquid. Also, the state of being chemically so combined.\r\n\r\nSoda straw\r\n      A small, hollow stalactite inside which drops of water descend.\r\n\r\nSpeleogen\r\n      A cave feature produced by solution of base rock.\r\n\r\nSpeleologist\r\n      One who makes a scientific study of caves.\r\n\r\nSpeleology\r\n      The scientific study of caves in all their aspects.\r\n\r\nSpeleothem\r\n      A cave feature produced by deposition of mineral.\r\n\r\nSpelunker\r\n      One who explores caves as a sportsman or amateur speleologist.\r\n\r\nStalactite\r\n      A calcite speleothem which grows downward, icicle-fashion, as a\r\n      result of deposition by dripping water.\r\n\r\nStalagmite\r\n      A calcite speleothem which grows upward from a cave floor as a\r\n      result of deposition by dripping water.\r\n\r\nVadose zone\r\n      The region lying between the surface of the earth and the water\r\n      table. Water which seeps or flows through this region under the\r\n      pull of gravity is called vadose water.\r\n\r\nWater table\r\n      The meeting place of the phreatic and vadose zones. Below it, the\r\n      rock is saturated with water; above it, water under the pull of\r\n      gravity is continuously flowing downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUGGESTED READING\r\n\r\n\r\nDavidson, E.
