APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n          _Published September, 1911_\r\n\r\n                  Printed in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this work is to portray in popular terms the\r\nsubstantial progress of aëronautics from its earliest beginning to\r\nthe present time. Beyond the introductory account, little note is\r\ntaken of experiments, however picturesque or clever, which constitute\r\nno advance in the art, or lead to no useful result. At times some\r\nminutiæ are presented to complete the story of an important series of\r\nachievements; but the unproductive efforts of impractical zealots,\r\nhowever prominent or widely known in their day, receive scant, if any,\r\nattention. Failures and tragedies where introduced, are described for\r\nthe lessons involved rather than for any curious interest investing\r\nthem. The griefs and grotesque follies of aëronautic imbeciles form a\r\nlong story, but a futile and unprofitable one, of slight concern in the\r\nevolutionary history of a veritable science.\r\n\r\nA general history of aërial locomotion would naturally be divided\r\ninto four parts, treating respectively of passive balloons, power\r\nballoons, passive flyers, and power flyers; but in this work a separate\r\ntreatment has not been allotted to passive flyers because of their too\r\nbackward state of development. Passive gliders which maneuver in the\r\nair merely by virtue of gravitational force, or acquired momentum, are\r\nfamiliar enough; but the much more interesting passive flyers of human\r\nconstruction, adapted to rise without motive power considerably beyond\r\ntheir initial level, or to soar far aloft, and sail long distances by\r\nvirtue of favorable winds, are still in their infancy. It may be hoped,\r\nhowever, that the vulture’s art which now is well nigh overlooked,\r\nbecause of the triumphant advance of dynamic flight, will soon receive\r\nsuch attention that future treatises may relate human achievements\r\nin soaring that shall rival the dexterous and marvelous feats of\r\nthe condor and albatross, even as the majestic sweep of the dynamic\r\naëroplane now rivals the powerful rowing flight of the strongest birds\r\nof prey.\r\n\r\nFollowing the story of the evolution of air ships, a brief account\r\nof the medium they navigate has been added. In particular, the\r\ncircumstances which affect the density and motion of the air have been\r\nstudied; for the density of the air determines the static lift of air\r\nships; the density and speed of impact of the air together determine\r\nthe dynamic lift and the resistance to progression; while the velocity\r\nof the air current conditions the possible speed of travel in any\r\ndirection. It is important, therefore, that the aëronautical student\r\nshould have some acquaintance with the general properties of the air\r\nwhich affect its density, and some knowledge of the generation and\r\nprevalence both of the great currents of the atmosphere, and of the\r\nlocal winds and invisible turmoils which so nearly concern the safety\r\nand effective progress of the aërial navigator.\r\n\r\nThe French units of measurement have been freely used, as well as the\r\nEnglish. This seems advisable because the official rules and records\r\nof international aëronautic events are partly expressed in the metric\r\nsystem. Moreover, the navigation of a universal medium seems to call\r\nfor such universal standards. Indeed a peculiar mission of world travel\r\nis to eliminate provincialism, and to promote universalism of thought,\r\nof sentiment, and of custom.\r\n\r\nIn order to lighten the book for the popular reader, some interesting\r\nhistorical facts and much important quantitative data are placed in the\r\nAppendices, where they may be available to the technical or special\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant duty to acknowledge here my obligations to the U.\r\nS. Signal Corps, the Smithsonian Institution, and the U. S. Weather\r\nBureau, for much assistance in collecting the materials for this work.\r\nDr. W. J. Humphreys, of the U. S. Weather Bureau, has very kindly read\r\nthe manuscript for the chapters on the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due also to the _Scientific American_ and to\r\n_Aëronautics_ for the use of photographs for the illustrations, as also\r\nto the manufacturers of various aircraft, and to Mr. W.

FANCY AND FOLK-LORE\r\n\r\n    Of silver wings he took a shining pair,\r\n      Fringed with gold, unwearied, nimble, swift;\r\n    With these he parts the winds, the clouds, the air,\r\n      And over seas and earth himself doth lift.\r\n    Thus clad he cuts the spheres and circles fair,\r\n      And the pure skies with sacred feathers clift;\r\n    On Lebanon at first his feet he set\r\n      And shook his wings with rosy may-dews wet.\r\n                                   TASSO, CANTO I, XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow beautiful! May we hope ever to journey thus, on wings actuated by\r\nhuman power? It is an old question, once dear to the philosopher and\r\nfool alike, but now important mainly to the fool. Or say more kindly it\r\nis the affair of untechnical inventors—the amateur, the rustic, the man\r\nof chimerical dreams. For the wise aëronaut now numbers that project\r\namong the roseate illusions of his youth.[1]\r\n\r\nOvid relates a story, doubtless credible in his day, of a clever\r\ncraftsman who with his son flew bravely aloft, the very first time they\r\nput on wings. Daedalus, a Greek architect, having fled from Athens for\r\nmurder, went with his son Icarus to the island of Crete, where he built\r\nthe celebrated labyrinth for Minos, the king. He offended that monarch\r\nand was cast into prison. In order to escape he made wings for himself\r\nand his son, with which they flew far over the sea. But Icarus, in his\r\nelation, soared too near the sun, ruined his wings, fell into the sea\r\nand was drowned. For proof of this we have the Icarian Sea, named after\r\nthe unfortunate boy. Also we have Ovid’s charming poem:\r\n\r\n    In tedious exile now too long detain’d\r\n    Daedalus languish’d for his native land;\r\n    The sea foreclosed his flight, yet thus he said;\r\n    “Though earth and water in subjection laid,\r\n    O cruel Minos, thy dominion be,\r\n    We’ll go through air; for sure the air is free.”\r\n    Then to new arts his cunning thought applies,\r\n    And to improve the work of nature tries.\r\n    A row of quills, in gradual order placed,\r\n    Rise by degrees in length from first to last;\r\n    As on a cliff the ascending thicket grows;\r\n    Or different reeds the rural pipe compose:\r\n    Along the middle runs a twine of flax,\r\n    The bottom stems are join’d by plaint wax;\r\n    Thus, well compact, a hollow bending brings\r\n    The fine composure into real wings.\r\n        His boy, young Icarus, that near him stood,\r\n    Unthinking of his fate, with smiles pursued\r\n    The floating feathers, which the moving air\r\n    Bore loosely from the ground, and wafted here and there:\r\n    Or with the wax impertinently play’d,\r\n    And with his childish tricks the great design delay’d.\r\n        The final masterstroke at last imposed,\r\n    And now, the great machine completely closed;\r\n    Fitting his pinions on, a flight he tries,\r\n    And hung self-balanced in the beaten skies.\r\n    Then thus instructs his child: “My boy, take care\r\n    To wing your course along the middle air:\r\n    If low, the surges wet your flagging plumes;\r\n    If high, the sun the melting wax consumes.\r\n    Steer between both: nor to the northern skies,\r\n    Nor South Orion, turn your giddy eyes,\r\n    But follow me; let me before you lay\r\n    Rules for the flight, and mark the pathless way.”\r\n    Thus teaching, with a fond concern, his son,\r\n    He took the untried wings, and fix’d them on:\r\n    But fix’d with trembling hands; and, as he speaks,\r\n    The tears roll gently down his aged cheeks;\r\n    Then kiss’d, and in his arms embraced him fast,\r\n    But knew not this embrace must be the last;\r\n    And mounting upward, as he wings his flight,\r\n    Back on his charge he turns his aching sight;\r\n    As parent birds, when first their callow care\r\n    Leave the high nest to tempt the liquid air;\r\n    Then cheers him on, and oft, with fatal art,\r\n    Reminds the stripling to perform his part.\r\n    These, as the angler at the silent brook,\r\n    Or mountain shepherd leaning on his crook,\r\n    Or gaping ploughman, from the vale descries,\r\n    They stare, and view them with religious eyes,\r\n    And straight conclude them gods; since none but they\r\n    Through their own azure skies could find a way.\r\n    Now Delos, Paros, on the left are seen,\r\n    And Samos, favour’d by Jove’s haughty queen;\r\n    Upon the right, the isle Lebynthos named,\r\n    And fair Calymne for its honey famed.\r\n    When now the boy, whose childish thoughts aspire\r\n    To loftier aims, and make him ramble higher,\r\n    Grown wild and wanton, more embolden’d flies\r\n    Far from his guide, and scars among the skies:\r\n    The softening wax, that felt a nearer sun,\r\n    Dissolved apace, and soon began to run:\r\n    The youth in vain his melting pinion shakes,\r\n    His feathers gone, no longer air he takes:\r\n    “Oh! father, father!” as he strove to cry,\r\n    Down to the sea he tumbled from on high,\r\n    And found his fate; yet still subsists by Fame,\r\n    Among those waters that retain his name.\r\n    The Father, now no more a father, cries:\r\n    “Ho, Icarus! where are you?” as he flies;\r\n    “Where shall I seek my boy?” he cries again,\r\n    And saw his feathers scatter’d on the main;\r\n    Then cursed his art; and funeral rites conferr’d\r\n    Naming the country from the youth interr’d.\r\n\r\nHow tender and apprehensive that gentleman’s farewell, compared with\r\nthe modern vogue in like circumstances! Of the two Americans at Berlin\r\nwho fell four thousand feet in a balloon, it is not recorded that they\r\neither kissed or wept.[2] But some Teutonic Ovid may yet adorn the tale\r\nwith quaint embellishments.\r\n\r\nTaking more serious note of Daedalus, it will be observed that he\r\nhas had few imitators. It is because he never really flew, and no\r\none else can fly, in such manner. That is to say, no man can achieve\r\npractical flight on wings actuated by his own muscular power. It may be\r\nphysically possible for an athlete putting forth herculean energy for\r\na few seconds to sustain himself on wings of enormous spread; but in\r\nevery lightest zephyr he would be as helpless as a thistle seed.\r\n\r\nThe actual area of wing required for a man of given weight and power\r\nmay be roughly estimated; at least its lower limit of size can be\r\ndetermined. Lord Rayleigh,[3] on purely theoretical ground, has\r\ncomputed that a man operating a screw propeller 280 feet in diameter,\r\nmoving without frictional loss, could sustain his weight for a period\r\nof eight hours a day at a comfortable rate of work. But that estimate\r\ndoes not include the weight of the propeller. By exerting ten times his\r\nnormal power the man could support his weight with a 28-foot propeller.\r\n\r\nThe physical basis of the computation is the same for every type of\r\nflyer, whether bird, man, or machine. Its weight must be sustained by\r\nhurling the air downward. The humming bird in its aërial pause, the bee\r\nfloating beside a blossom, rests on a down-driven column of air. The\r\nhome-gliding eagle at dusk may encounter a medium in stillest repose,\r\nbut he leaves behind him a down-flowing wake, viewless, maybe, but none\r\nthe less real. In all cases the downward impulse per second given to\r\nthe air must equal the weight supported by its reaction. If the wings\r\nbe very extensive a proportionate mass of air may be struck down, and\r\nyield support with so much the less exertion.\r\n\r\nHorizontal flight promises little more than direct screw lift, with the\r\nfeeble energy of the human muscle. The best modern aëroplanes carry\r\nless than 100 pounds per horse power, while an average man must weigh,\r\nwith a light machine, not less than 200 pounds, and must therefore\r\nexert upwards of two horse power during flight. Such an output of\r\nenergy would exhaust a powerful athlete in a few seconds. Hence from\r\nevery point of view it appears that Daedalean flight, which still has\r\nits devotees in some form, was and always will be utterly impracticable.\r\n\r\nRuskin finds another objection to the disciples of the winged arm.\r\nIn his disquisition on the equilibrium of angels he complains that\r\nthose of the traditional two-wing type are devoid of gravitational\r\nbalance. Such creatures vex the imagination with apprehensions for\r\ntheir stability; hence they cannot be entirely beautiful. The centroid\r\nof an angel is in the small of its back, whereas the center of wing\r\nsupport is well forward; therefore the horizontal poise is absurd and\r\nunæsthetic. The scientific artist, consequently, views with pain the\r\npicture of a fair lady floating level through space supported only at\r\nher front end.\r\n\r\nMilton adroitly forestalls this censure. In the conception of his\r\nglorious Raphael, he provides consummately for uniform and adequate\r\nsupport:\r\n\r\n        Six wings he wore, to shade\r\n    His lineaments divine; the pair that clad\r\n    Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’er his breast\r\n    With regal ornament; the middle pair\r\n    Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round\r\n    Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold,\r\n    And colors dipped in Heaven; the third his feet\r\n    Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\r\n    Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia’s son he stood,\r\n    And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\r\n    The circuit wide.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, who was a gifted engineer as well as an artist,\r\ndevised a flying gear for man which shows some dynamic improvement over\r\nthe mechanism of the old-time angels, flying gods, and hobgoblins. As\r\nshown in the accompanying sketch, it provided for gravitational balance\r\nby use of an expanding tail projecting well to the rear. Moreover, the\r\npropulsion was to employ both arms and legs. This design is considered\r\nvery remarkable for the time in which it was produced, probably a few\r\nyears before the discovery of America; and yet it is but one of Da\r\nVinci’s quaint aëronautical inventions, as will appear later.\r\n\r\nA less futile scheme of aviation may be to saddle the birds. If one\r\neagle can float a child, a few may possibly carry a man. They are\r\nphysically able; they are inexpensive; they are unwearied, nimble,\r\nswift. Some harness, some tuition may be required; but these come\r\nto the industrious. Apparently, such locomotion is a sport worth\r\ndeveloping; a royal art, if you please; for who would not course the\r\nsky in a purple palanquin borne by imperial eagles?\r\n\r\nKai Kaoos, the King of Persia, is credited with a voyage of this kind,\r\nas described in the _Shah-Nemeh_, or _King-Book_, written in the tenth\r\ncentury:\r\n\r\n  “To the king it became a matter of great concern how he might\r\n  be enabled to ascend the heavens, without wings; and for that\r\n  purpose he consulted the astrologers, who presently suggested a\r\n  way in which his desires might be successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—DA VINCI’S DESIGNS FOR HUMAN FLYING-GEAR.]\r\n\r\n  “They contrived to rob an eagle’s nest of its young, which they\r\n  reared with great care, supplying them with invigorating food.\r\n\r\n  “A frame of aloes-wood was then prepared, and at each of the\r\n  four corners was fixed perpendicularly a javelin surmounted\r\n  on the point with the flesh of a goat. At each corner again\r\n  one of the eagles was bound, and in the middle the king was\r\n  seated with a goblet of wine before him. As soon as the eagles\r\n  became hungry they endeavored to get at the goat’s flesh upon\r\n  the javelins, and by flapping their wings, and flying upwards\r\n  they quickly raised the throne from the ground. Hunger still\r\n  pressing on them, and still being distant from their prey,\r\n  they ascended higher and higher in the clouds, conveying the\r\n  astonished king far beyond his own country. But after a long\r\n  and fruitless exertion, their strength failed them, and, unable\r\n  to keep their way, the whole fabric came tumbling down from the\r\n  sky, and fell upon a dreary solitude in the Kingdom of Chin,\r\n  where Kai Kaoos was left a prey to hunger, alone, and in utter\r\n  despair.”\r\n\r\nOne might prefer a single bird, which could be ridden bareback by a man\r\nor woman of common equestrian skill. The early philosophers, therefore,\r\nsought with some care for such a creature. The following is related by\r\nBishop Wilkins:\r\n\r\n  “Cardan and Scaliger doe unanimously affirm, that there is\r\n  a bird amongst the Indians of so great a bignesse, that his\r\n  beak is often used to make a sheath or scabbard for a sword.\r\n  And Acosta tells us of a fowl in Peru called Condores, which\r\n  will of themselves kill and eat up a whole calf at a time. Nor\r\n  is there any reason why any other body may not be supported\r\n  and carried in the air, though it should as much exceed the\r\n  quantity of these fowls as they do the quantity of a flie.\r\n  Marcus Polus mentions a fowl in Madagascar which he cals a\r\n  Ruck, the feathers of whose wings are 12 paces, or threescore\r\n  foot long, which can with as much ease scoop up an elephant as\r\n  our kites do a mouse. If this relation was anything credible,\r\n  it might serve as an abundant proof for the present quaere.”\r\n\r\nAs the roc has proved a myth, one questions whether a saddle bird\r\nmay not be evolved by judicious breeding. But opposed to this is the\r\nsquare-cube law of the Greek geometer, by which a learned geologist\r\ndemonstrated that nature has reached the limit of her resources in the\r\nproduction of large flyers, the ostrich, for example, being too bulky\r\nto navigate at all. As a last resource, then, the human dwarf may\r\nbreed his weight downward to accommodate the bird. Assuredly, the most\r\npowerful flyer can carry the lightest human dwarf without difficulty.\r\n\r\nSuch aërial cavalry has been projected occasionally, and if fairly\r\ndeveloped might have interesting employment. Its military value, to\r\nsay nothing of its civil uses, would be considerable. An aërial scout\r\nthat could hide in a tree top, or small cloud, then flit home with full\r\nintelligence of the enemy, would be effective and unique. In aggressive\r\nwarfare it would serve the plan of that ingenious Englishman who\r\nproposes to repel a German invasion by dispatching birds to peck holes\r\nin the enemy’s war balloons. But here the dwarf might be omitted, if\r\nthe birds were taught to have a definite interest in attacking aërial\r\ncruisers with their beaks, or with steel-armed spurs like those of the\r\nSpanish fighting cock, or with talons treated chemically to strike\r\nfire. Sparrows with sulphur-pointed toes could easily annihilate an\r\naërial squadron at all combustible.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the geologist, it may be added that, having discovered the\r\nmajor limit of feathered navigators, he concluded, as a corollary, that\r\nhuman flight is forever impossible. That was in the latter eighties.\r\nIn 1901 a versatile astronomer adduced the same law to prove that an\r\naëroplane could not be made to carry a man. Presently, learning that\r\nthis had been achieved, he proved, in a second mellifluous paper, that\r\nan aëroplane could not carry, several men.[4] Having erred twice, he\r\nwrote a final article announcing that a flyer is fatuous, anyhow,\r\nbecause she cannot repair her engines in the sky!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—A POSSIBLE AIR-SCOUT.]\r\n\r\nOf the numerous daring and industrious inventors who, during remote\r\ngenerations, have launched themselves in the air on some species of\r\nrigid or vibrant wings, a few were men of considerable equipment in\r\nphilosophy, or mechanics, and enjoyed a sufficient measure of success\r\nto deserve passing notice; though it seems that no man before the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century made a permanent contribution to the\r\nreal art of mechanical flight, if we except the ingenious suggestive\r\ndevices of Leonardo da Vinci. However skilfully their flying apparatus\r\nmay have been planned, or operated, the results were lost to the world,\r\ndue to inaccurate or inadequate description. Such inventors were J. B.\r\nDante, in the fifteenth century, and the Marquis de Bacqueville, in the\r\nseventeenth. Each of these made one, or more, considerable flights, if\r\nwe may credit the unwavering testimony of their contemporaries; but\r\nneither has left a sketch of his device, nor a school of followers to\r\ncontinue his spectacular practice.\r\n\r\nJean-Baptiste Dante, a shrewd observer and profound mathematician, who\r\nflourished toward the end of the fifteenth century, a contemporary of\r\nDa Vinci and Columbus, is reported by the historians of that day to\r\nhave sailed successfully through the air on nonvibrant wings designed\r\nby himself after a careful study of the great soaring birds. Perching\r\nabove a steep crag on the shore of Lake Trasimene, he set his wings\r\nto the wind at a nice angle, as one sets the sails of a vessel; then,\r\nlifted by the swelling breeze, he rose grandly aloft and floated far\r\nover the waters. Again and again he repeated the experiment, until\r\nthe fame thereof secured for him a request to make the demonstration\r\nat the marriage fêtes of the illustrious general, Barthelmi Alviano.\r\nHe accepted the invitation, and, starting from the top of the highest\r\ntower in the city of Perugia, he sailed over the public square,\r\nand balanced himself for a long time in space, amid the shouts and\r\nacclamations of the multitude, attracted to Perugia by the novelty of\r\nhis performance. But, sad to relate, the very first time he performed\r\nthese wonderful maneuvers above the solid ground instead of the lake,\r\none of the levers used to alter the impact angle of his wings gave way,\r\ndisturbing his aërial poise, and causing him to pitch down upon Notre\r\nDame church, breaking one of his legs. After this he taught mathematics\r\nat Venice, where he died of fever at the age of forty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, the Marquis de Bacqueville, at the age of sixty-two years,\r\nannounced that on a certain day he would fly from his house on the\r\nSeine, traverse the river, and land in the Garden of the Tuileries. A\r\ngreat multitude assembled, crowding both shores and the two bridges.\r\nAt the appointed moment the Marquis appeared with his pinions, and\r\nlaunched himself from the terrace. He sailed forth in majestic and\r\nserene poise, on graceful wings not unlike those of the traditional\r\nangels. He was gliding directly toward the Tuileries, and he enjoyed a\r\nhappy cruise quite to the middle of the river. Then something happened;\r\nhis movements became fitful and uncertain; he plunged downward and\r\nbroke his leg on a laundry boat. The reason for his stopping there can\r\nonly be surmised, for he had nothing to report. He did not quite fulfil\r\nhis program, but he flew nine hundred feet delightfully, and he landed\r\nwithout getting wet.\r\n\r\nCommentators have marveled as to the nature of the mechanism used by\r\nDante and by De Bacqueville. Historians have strongly attested the\r\nfact of the flights, but have overlooked the means. The inventors must\r\nhave employed aërial gliders of some kind, for adequate motive power\r\nwas not available before the end of the nineteenth century. Even as\r\nan experiment in gliding, or soaring, the achievement of Dante was\r\nmost daring and wonderful, eclipsing the best performances up to the\r\ntwentieth century. It is strange that in that period of science the\r\nsurvivor of such an experience, and a college professor, should not\r\nhave left to the world a careful account of such an extraordinary\r\nperformance. The alleged flights, however, were unquestionably\r\nfeasible, even in that remote period, for the construction of an\r\naërial glider is a simple task not beyond the capacity of craftsmen\r\nin the fifteenth century A.D., or even the fifteenth century\r\nB.C., directed by a skilful designer.\r\n\r\nBesides the wing-armed scheme of flight credited to Daedalus, and\r\ncontemplated by Da Vinci, various other plans were evolved in\r\nsucceeding years. Aërial chariots and flying machines were devised for\r\nthe more advantageous use of muscular energy. In all these, of course,\r\nthe passenger could be both power plant and captain of the ship.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest authenticated devices of this kind was the\r\ninvention of Blanchard, described by him in the _Journal de Paris_,\r\nAugust 28, 1781, nearly two years before the invention of the hot-air\r\nballoon, of which he became later an enthusiastic votary. As his device\r\nis but one of a large number that appeared before the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, and the advent of light motors, the reader who\r\nwishes fuller acquaintance with man-driven airships may be referred\r\nto Mr. Chanute’s book, entitled _Progress in Flying-Machines_, which\r\ndescribes a large variety of such inventions, and discusses the merit\r\nand weakness of each.\r\n\r\nBlanchard prefaces the description of his machine by answering some\r\ncriticisms of his project, apparently ventured by his neighbors. “They\r\nobject to me,” he writes, “that flying is not the business of man, but\r\nrather of the feathered birds. I reply that feathers are not at all\r\nnecessary to the bird for flight; any fabric suffices. The fly, the\r\nbutterfly, the bat, etc., fly without feathers and with fanlike wings\r\nof material resembling horn. It is, then, neither the material nor\r\nthe form that causes flight, but the volume and the celerity of the\r\nmovement, which should be as lively as possible.\r\n\r\n“They object, moreover, that a man is too heavy to lift himself alone\r\nwith wings, much less in a vessel which of itself presents enormous\r\nweight. I reply that my ship is extremely light; as to the man’s\r\nweight, I pray that attention be given to that which M. de Buffon says\r\nin his _Histoire Naturelle_, on the subject of the condor; this bird,\r\nthough of enormous weight, easily lifts a two-year-old heifer weighing\r\nat least a hundred pounds, the whole with wings of about thirty to\r\nthirty-six feet expanse.”\r\n\r\nHe then describes the vessel as a little ship four feet long by two\r\nfeet wide, having on either side two posts, each supporting a wing ten\r\nfeet long, the whole forming a parasol twenty feet in diameter. The\r\nconstruction was illustrated by an engraver, who had seen the vessel\r\nand was convinced of its practicability. In conclusion, the inventor\r\nwrites that people shall see him cleave the air with more speed than\r\nthe crow, and that without losing his breath, being protected by a\r\npointed mask of peculiar construction. But, as he failed to make good\r\nhis promises, he was subjected to ridicule, as well as praise, by the\r\nlocal press, one of the caricatures portraying him in the act of making\r\nan ascension before a concourse of bulging-eyed savants and long-eared\r\njackasses, wearing spectacles to accentuate the appearance of wisdom\r\nand solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe scientific coterie of Paris were apparently impatient of the\r\nattention shown Blanchard by the press and people. Accordingly, in May,\r\n1782, the distinguished astronomer, De Laland, of the French Academy,\r\nadministered a mild rebuke to the editors of the _Paris Journal_.\r\n“Gentlemen,” he wrote, “you have given so much time to air ships and\r\ndivination rods that one might eventually think that you believe in\r\nthese follies, or that the scientists who coöperate with your journal\r\nhave nothing to say to dispel these absurd pretensions. Permit me,\r\ntherefore, gentlemen, to occupy some lines in your journal to assure\r\nyour readers that if the savants are silent it is only because of their\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—BLANCHARD’S FLYING-MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n“It has been demonstrated to be impossible for a man in any manner\r\nwhatever to raise himself, or even to sustain himself, in the air. M.\r\nCoulomb, of the Academy of Sciences, at one of our meetings a year ago,\r\nread a paper in which he showed clearly, by calculating the power of\r\na man, determined by experiments, that he would require wings two or\r\nthree thousand feet long moved three feet per second; hence no one but\r\nan ignoramus would make an attempt of this kind.”\r\n\r\nNot many months after this lofty deliverance, Blanchard took De Lalande\r\nup in a balloon—“the dead borne by the dumb.”\r\n\r\nCoulomb’s calculation that a man’s pinions should be half a mile long\r\nmust have been discouraging to those inventors who believed in him;\r\nfor, granting that such wings could lift a man, who could lift the\r\nwings? And at that date the steam engine was only beginning to develop;\r\nthe petroleum engine was hardly thought of. No wonder that people\r\nturned eagerly to the balloon when it finally appeared.\r\n\r\nThere has been some controversy as to what person first clearly\r\nconceived a feasible design for a balloon. The conception was\r\ncertainly not new to the world in 1783, when Joseph Montgolfier made\r\nhis classical experiment. Indeed, prior to that date three distinct\r\nprinciples of aërial flotation had been entertained by natural\r\nphilosophers; first, that a boat could be so formed of heavy material\r\nas to ride on the upper surface of the atmosphere, as a metallic vessel\r\nfloats on the water; second, that a closed hull, comprising a partial,\r\nor complete, vacuum, could be made light enough to rise; third, that\r\na bag could be made buoyant by filling it with material lighter than\r\nair. Of course, it is now clear to men versed in mathematics that only\r\nthe light-gas principle is mechanically applicable. But the vacuum\r\nprinciple still has adherents among inventors who are too “practical”\r\nto understand, or trust, exact computation; and the first principle,\r\nthough now discarded by everyone, was plausible enough, even to\r\naccomplished scientific men, before the experiments of Torricelli, and\r\nhis invention of the barometer, made in 1643. It may, therefore, be\r\ninteresting to notice some of the proposed, or reported, air ships\r\nbased upon these various principles. The following is from _Mendoza,\r\nViridario, libri III, probl. 47_:\r\n\r\n  “Any brass vessel full of air, which otherwise would sink, is\r\n  sustained on the surface of the water, though naturally of\r\n  much greater specific gravity; consequently a wooden ship, or\r\n  one of any other material, placed on the summit of an aërial\r\n  superficies and filled with elementary fire, will be sustained\r\n  in that position till the gravity of the vessel becomes greater\r\n  than the sustaining power of the fire it contains.”\r\n\r\nThis is a clear scientific exposition of a plan for navigating the\r\natmosphere on its upper surface, assuming a distinct upper surface\r\nto exist. In commenting on this passage, the Jesuit Schottus, in his\r\n_Magia Universalis_, uses an expression which indicates his belief that\r\na vessel can be made to _float in the air_ by filling it with ether, or\r\nthe element of fire. He says:\r\n\r\n  “In such terms has this matter been treated by Mendoza (died\r\n  1626); nor is there any improbability involved in his view,\r\n  whether the element of fire be placed above the air, or, what\r\n  is still more credible, the ether—that is, the purest air.\r\n  Although any wood, iron, copper, lead, and such like metals are\r\n  weightier than an equal volume of water, and for that reason\r\n  will sink in water when placed there alone, yet if fabricated\r\n  into hollow shapes, and filled with our impure and heavy air,\r\n  they swim upon waters, and are adapted to the construction of\r\n  ships, and are sustained by water without danger of immersion;\r\n  thus, although these bodies are of greater specific gravity\r\n  than our air, nevertheless, when shaped into a boat and filled\r\n  with that very light material, they can _float in the air_,\r\n  and are suitable material for the construction of small ships,\r\n  because the entire work composed of the little ship and the\r\n  ether can be made lighter than an equal volume of our impure\r\n  air, even in the highest region.”\r\n\r\nAs Roger Bacon proposed a similar device in 1542, Mendoza’s was not\r\nentirely new and may not have been original. Bacon, describing his\r\naërial vessel, says: “It must be a large, hollow globe of copper, or\r\nother suitable metal, wrought extremely thin, in order to have it\r\nas light as possible. It must then be filled with ‘ethereal air or\r\nliquid fire,’ and then be launched from some elevated point into the\r\natmosphere, where it will float like a vessel on water.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1646 another learned Jesuit published a book, _Ars Magna\r\nLucis et Umbræ in Mundo_, in which he relates an episode indicating\r\nthat one of his order had made use of a hot-air balloon to intimidate\r\nsome ignorant pagans. The following demonstration, if reported by a\r\nmodern missionary, would be accepted as a matter of course; why, then,\r\nshould we gravely question the story, since it describes an achievement\r\nquite possible at the time, assuming that the necessary materials were\r\navailable? And even assuming the report to be fictitious, still it is a\r\nscientific description of a practicable hot-air balloon, presented and\r\ncredited by a learned scholar and accomplished mathematician more than\r\na century before the balloon was publicly exhibited by the illustrious\r\nFrenchmen. He writes:\r\n\r\n  “I know that many of our fathers have been rescued from the\r\n  most imminent dangers amongst the barbarians of India by such\r\n  inventions. These were cast into prison, and whilst they\r\n  continued ignorant of any means of effecting their liberation,\r\n  some one, more cunning than the rest, invented an extraordinary\r\n  machine, and then threatened the barbarians, unless they\r\n  liberated his companions, that they would behold in a short\r\n  time some extraordinary portents, and experience the visible\r\n  anger of the Gods. The barbarians laughed at the threat. He\r\n  then had constructed a dragon of the most volatile paper, and\r\n  in this he enclosed a mixture of sulphur, pitch, wax, and so\r\n  artistically prepared all his materials, that, when ignited, it\r\n  would illumine the machine, and exhibit the following legend\r\n  in their vernacular idiom, _The Anger of God_. The body being\r\n  formed and the ingredients prepared, he then affixed a long\r\n  tail, and committed the machine to the heavens, and, favored\r\n  by the wind, it soared aloft towards the clouds. The spectacle\r\n  of the dragon so brilliantly lit was terrific. The barbarians,\r\n  beholding the unusual motion of the apparition, were smitten\r\n  with the greatest astonishment, and now, remembering the\r\n  threatened anger of Deity and the words of the father, they\r\n  were in fear of expiating the punishment he had prognosticated\r\n  for them. Therefore, without delay, they threw open the gates,\r\n  they suffered their prisoners to go forth in peace and enjoy\r\n  their freedom. In the meantime the fire seized on the machine\r\n  and set it in a blaze, and with an explosion, which was\r\n  interpreted as an expiring declaration of satisfaction, it,\r\n  apparently of its own accord, vanished from sight, as if it\r\n  had accomplished its supernatural mission. Thus the fathers,\r\n  through the apprehension which this natural manifestation\r\n  inspired, obtained that which could not be purchased with a\r\n  large amount of gold.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will permit another anecdote, not entirely for its\r\nscientific value, but because he may like to compare the attitude of\r\npeople toward aërial navigation in the dark ages with the attitude of\r\nhis neighbors at the opening of the twentieth century. In two histories\r\nby Jef le Ministre and De Colonia, of the town of Lyons, the following\r\naccount is given:\r\n\r\n  “Toward the end of Charlemagne’s reign, persons who lived\r\n  near Mount Pilate in Switzerland, knowing by what means\r\n  pretended sorcerers traveled through the air, resolved to try\r\n  the experiment, and compelled some poor people to ascend in an\r\n  aërostal. This descended in the town of Lyons, where they were\r\n  immediately hurried to prison, and the mob desired their death\r\n  as sorcerers. The judges condemned them to be burned; but the\r\n  Bishop Agobard suspended the execution, and sent for them to\r\n  his palace, that he might question them. They answered: ‘Qu’ils\r\n  sont du pays meme, que des personnes de consideration les ont\r\n  forcés de se laisser conduire, leur promettent qu’ils verroient\r\n  des chose merveilleuses; et qu’ils sont veritablement descendu\r\n  par l’air.’ Agobard, though he could not believe this fact,\r\n  gave credence to their innocence, and allowed them to escape.\r\n  On this occasion he wrote a work on the superstition of the\r\n  time, in which he demonstrated the impossibility of rising in\r\n  the air; that it is an error to believe in the power of magic;\r\n  and that it has its existence in the credulity solely of the\r\n  people.”\r\n\r\nOne of the first men to make an aërial model like a fire balloon was\r\nthe celebrated Brazilian, Bartholomeo-Lourenco de Gusmao, who in his\r\nday was nicknamed the “flying man,” and who is reported to have made\r\na remarkable experiment in aërial locomotion at Lisbon. The following\r\naccount of it is found in a manuscript of Ferreira:\r\n\r\n  “Gusmao made his experiment on August 8, 1709, in the court of\r\n  the Palace of the Indies, before his majesty and a large and\r\n  distinguished audience, with a globe which lifted itself softly\r\n  to the height of the hall of the Ambassadors, then descended in\r\n  like manner. It was borne up by certain materials which burned\r\n  and which the inventor himself had ignited.”\r\n\r\nAll the details of this description, which was written a generation\r\nor more before the Montgolfier experiment, suggest at once a hot-air\r\nballoon. But a note printed in 1774 and cited by Cavallo explains that\r\nthe globes must have been transported by gas. It is certain that early\r\nin 1709 Gusmao applied to the King for a patent and sole right to some\r\nsuch invention, desiring an injunction and severe penalty against\r\nall infringements. The application sets forth a machine capable of\r\njourneying through the air faster than over land or sea, competent\r\nto carry messages five or six hundred miles a day to troops, or the\r\nmost distant countries, and even adequate to explore regions about the\r\npoles. Quite a modern promoter Señor Gusmao. The King in reply issued\r\nthe following decree:\r\n\r\n  “Agreeably to the advice of my council, I order the pain of\r\n  death against the transgressor. And in order to encourage the\r\n  suppliant to apply himself with zeal toward improving the\r\n  machine which is capable of producing the effects mentioned by\r\n  him, I also grant him the first Professorship of Mathematics in\r\n  my University of Coimbra, and the first vacancy in my College\r\n  of Barcelona, with the annual pension of 600,000 reis during\r\n  his life.”\r\n\r\nThe “patent” seemed liberal enough, and yet Gusmao never resumed\r\nhis aërial experiments. He was accused of magic, and may have\r\nfeared persecution on that account; accordingly he engaged in naval\r\nconstruction till 1724, when he left Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe first vacuum balloon was proposed by the Jesuit father, Francis\r\nLana, and described in his book _Podromo dell’Arte Maestra Brecia_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1670. Though not a practical project like Gusmao’s,\r\nit was very ingenious, and marks an interesting phase in the evolution\r\nof the fundamental idea of the air ship, or “balloon” as it was called\r\nby the inventor, who then coined the word now in common use. Lana\r\nproposed to use four copper spheres each 25 feet in diameter and\r\n1/225 inches in wall thickness, quite well exhausted of air, to give\r\nascensional force which he computed at 1,200 pounds aggregate for the\r\nfour spheres. From these he would suspend the passengers in a boat\r\nhaving a mast and sail to propel the ship in time of favorable wind.\r\nHaving computed the buoyancy according to well-known physical laws, he\r\ncould see no possible objection to his project “unless,” he writes,\r\n“it be that God would never permit this invention to be practically\r\napplied, in order to prevent the consequences that would ensue\r\ntherefrom in the civil and political government of men.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—LANA’S PROPOSED VACUUM BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nOf recent years inventors having less delicate scruples about\r\nembarrassing Providence, have revived Lana’s project with\r\nimprovements. It has been proposed to replace the sail by a\r\nmotor-driven propeller, and to ensure the hull against collapse from\r\nthe prodigious external air pressure—a ton per square foot—by ample\r\ninternal bracing. Even within the past twelve months this scheme has\r\nbeen soberly advocated by several technical journals and by the author\r\nof an elaborate book on aërial warfare. To a mathematician this is\r\namusing, when not too pathetic; for it can be rigorously proved that\r\nno vacuum balloon of present day material, whatever its design, can\r\npossibly resist crushing if made light enough to float.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Walter Wellman described in the _Associated Press_ a steel\r\nvacuum balloon 144 feet in diameter and 654 feet long in which a\r\nChicago doctor proposed to carry passengers to the North Pole, at\r\nincredible speed, if they would furnish him $130,000 to meet the\r\nexpenses of construction. “Here is a most excellent opportunity,” wrote\r\nWellman, “for all who would like to win fame by being one of the party\r\nwhich shall set foot upon that icy _ignis fatuus_ of many nations and\r\ntwo centuries.” Two decades later Mr. Wellman organized, after his own\r\nideas, an aërial expedition to the North Pole; but he no longer favored\r\nstarting from Chicago in a vacuum balloon with a party of stockholders.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the inventor of the great steel vacuum balloon,\r\nafter organizing the Trans-Continental Aërial Navigation Company, and\r\nfailing to raise all of the $130,000, sought aid from the national\r\ngovernment. Here was an interesting situation; a doctor ignorant\r\nof mechanics, with the plans for a mammoth and impossible balloon,\r\nappealing for aid to a congress, supremely shy of air ships, even\r\nthough recommended by its ablest military advisers. But in this case\r\nthere was a capable lobby. The bill for this physically impossible\r\nballoon actually passed the House, and was finally defeated only by\r\nthe timely effort of a few scientific men who, by easy calculation,\r\nproved the absurdity of the invention. As the reader may like to see a\r\nmathematical proof of the impossibility of a vacuum balloon, since such\r\nprojects arise frequently, the argument is given in Appendix I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I\r\n\r\n                         GROWTH OF AËROSTATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                   EARLY HISTORY OF PASSIVE BALLOONS\r\n\r\n    Oh, that I could as smoke arise,\r\n    That rolls its black wreathes through the air;\r\n    Mix with the clouds, that o’er the skies\r\n    Show their light forms, and disappear:\r\n    Or like the dust be tossed\r\n    By every sportive wind till all be lost!\r\n                                           —ÆSCHYLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf desire is sometimes the mother of invention, doubtless the wish to\r\n“mix with the clouds,” or “as smoke arise,” suggested to man his first\r\nmeans of aërial locomotion. Indeed this is openly avowed by Joseph\r\nMontgolfier. “Smoke rises in the chimney; why not encage this smoke,\r\nand have an available force.” But before describing his fundamental\r\nexperiments of 1783, let us notice the less conspicuous ones,\r\nthough not less philosophical, of his immediate predecessors in the\r\ndevelopment of aëronautic science.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen, that many years before 1783, inventors had clearly\r\nconceived the true principle of the balloon, and would be glad to\r\navail themselves of an element of sufficiently low specific gravity\r\nfor aërial flotation. The desired opportunity came when, in 1766,\r\nHenry Cavendish published his experiments, proving that hydrogen is\r\nmany times lighter than air. Immediately after this, Dr. Black, the\r\nfamous chemist and natural philosopher of Edinburgh, conceived the\r\nidea that a thin light vessel filled with hydrogen should be able to\r\nfloat and rise in the atmosphere, ideas that he conveyed to his friends\r\nand expressed in his lectures a year or two after the appearance of\r\nCavendish’s publication. But he contented himself with merely pointing\r\nthe way to an obviously practicable invention, leaving, as a university\r\nprofessor should, the development of the scientific idea to inventors\r\nand constructive engineers.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between Dr. Black, the pure scientist, and the Montgolfier\r\nbrothers manufacturers, came Tiberius Cavallo, an Italian philosopher\r\nliving in England, who made the first small hydrogen balloons. In\r\na note presented to the Royal Society of London, June 20, 1782, he\r\nrelates experiments that seem to entitle him to all the credit of\r\ninventing the balloon except success on a practical scale. He made\r\nhydrogen soap bubbles which rose beautifully in the air, an experiment\r\nthat has been repeated throughout the world in every chemical\r\nlaboratory since his day. He made a variety of gum bubbles and varnish\r\nbubbles inflated with hydrogen; but curiously enough these failed\r\nto rise, though it is known that such bubbles can be made to float\r\nhandsomely.[5] He inflated carefully prepared gold-beater skin and\r\nfailed, though gold-beater skin balloons, both large and small, are now\r\na marketable commodity. Finally he constructed paper balloons which he\r\ntried to float by use of hydrogen, but without success, though a year\r\nlater the Montgolfier brothers easily made paper bags arise with hot\r\nair, and Professor Charles ascended in a large silk balloon inflated\r\nwith hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Cavallo’s interesting failures reveals itself in his own\r\naccount of one of his pioneer experiments. In his _History and Practice\r\nof Aërostation_, he relates that he constructed, of fine Chinese paper,\r\na cylindrical balloon having short conical ends and a calculated\r\nbuoyancy of twenty-five grains, when properly inflated with hydrogen.\r\nThis bag, carefully deflated of air by compression between the hands,\r\nhe suspended above a large bottle connected with it by a glass tube,\r\nand supplied with materials for generating hydrogen; in this case a\r\nmixture of dilute sulphuric acid and iron filings. When the hydrogen\r\nwas evolving quite rapidly, he expected to see the paper sac expand\r\nand fill out with proportionate speed; but to his surprise it remained\r\nperfectly flat, while the room filled with the strong and disagreeable\r\nodor of the “inflaminable air.” He then realized that the carefully\r\nmade sac of paper, which could be so easily inflated with air, was very\r\npermeable to hydrogen, allowing it to escape instantly, as through\r\nporous cloth, or netting.\r\n\r\nCavallo desisted when the goal was within reach. His plans were\r\npracticable, but he abandoned them too readily. Why did he not varnish\r\nhis balloon when it leaked? He could thus so easily have inaugurated\r\nthe art of aërial navigation. But after salting the bird’s tail he let\r\nit escape.\r\n\r\nVarious accounts have been given of the steps by which the Montgolfiers\r\nwere led to their invention of the balloon. They are said to have\r\nstudied and discussed projects for aërial locomotion a decade before\r\nhitting upon their first successful device; at one time filling a paper\r\nbag with smoke ineffectually; again with steam, and again trying, but\r\nin vain, to employ hydrogen. The following apparently reliable account\r\nis given by a friend of the Montgolfiers, Baron Gernando, in his\r\nbiographical notice of Joseph Montgolfier, having obtained the story\r\nfrom the inventor himself.\r\n\r\nJoseph Montgolfier found himself at Abignon, and it was at the time\r\nwhen the combined armies held the siege of Gibraltar. Alone, in the\r\nchimney corner, dreaming, as usual, he was contemplating a sort of cut\r\nthat represented the work of the siege; he grew impatient observing\r\nthat one could not reach the body of the place either by land or\r\nsea. “But could not one arrive there through the air? Smoke rises in\r\nthe chimney; why not store this smoke in such a manner as to form an\r\navailable force?” His mind calculated instantly the weight of a given\r\nsurface of paper, or taffeta; he constructed without delay his little\r\nballoon, and saw it rise from the floor, to the great surprise of his\r\nhostess, and with a peculiar joy. He wrote on the spot, to his brother\r\nthen at Annonay: “Prepare immediately a supply of taffeta and cordage,\r\nand you shall see the most astonishing thing in the world.”\r\n\r\nA quainter story is told by Brisson in his _Dictionary of Physics_. He\r\nsays: “I can only repeat what the citizen Montgolfier himself told me,\r\nwhen he came to Paris to announce his discovery; that the citizeness\r\nMontgolfier having placed a skirt on an open-wicker basket, such as\r\nwomen use to dry linen, the skirt was lifted to the ceiling. It is from\r\nthis fact that the citizens Montgolfier started.”\r\n\r\nWhatever the preliminaries, the Montgolfier brothers finally made the\r\nexperiment of holding a paper bag over a fire fed with wet straw and\r\nwool. It is doubtful whether they purposed to fill it with smoke, or\r\nwith hot air or an electrical cloud. They knew that a cloud of some\r\nkind rises from such a fire, and they wanted to harness it. Their\r\nfirst balloon took fire and went up as smoke. But they were rich\r\npaper manufacturers, and soon had another balloon of 700 cubic feet\r\ncapacity. This rose from the fire to a height of 1,000 feet, carrying\r\nno fuel with it. Thus two practical[6] men had made fire lift a paper\r\nsac; let the Academy explain how. The baby Aërostation was born.\r\n\r\nHow fortuitous the primal steps of science! Galvanism from the twitch\r\nof a frog’s leg; aërostation from the puff of a petticoat! There had\r\nbeen no year in thirty centuries when people could not easily have\r\nbuilt a hot-air balloon. All the materials were available; only a\r\nlittle thought was wanting. A simple sketch sent to a Roman tailor,\r\nor tent-maker, could have furnished a woven bag competent to lift\r\npassengers from the heart of the Coliseum, to the wonder and delight\r\nof a hundred thousand spectators. Yet the genius that could design the\r\nColiseum, or cover its vast enclosure with canvas, failed to think of\r\nthe magic bag that would have enhanced so much the ingenious shows of\r\na show-loving people. That device was an inspiration destined to a\r\ncommon Frenchman at no uncommon period of science. The hydrogen balloon\r\narrived in the natural and logical order of scientific progression;\r\nbut the hot-air bag might have presented itself at any time since the\r\nbirth of weaving. It was a happy thought, like the ophthalmoscope,\r\nor jack-knife—quaint modern creations of constant use or comfort to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe public inauguration of aëronautics occurred on June 5, 1783, at\r\nAnnonay, the home of the Montgolfier family, 36 miles from Lyons.\r\nThe states of Vivarais being assembled at that place, were invited\r\nto witness the ascension. The Deputies and many spectators found in\r\nthe public square an enormous bag which, with its frame, weighed 300\r\npounds, and would inflate to a ball 35 feet in diameter. When told\r\nthat this huge mass would rise to the clouds they were astonished and\r\nincredulous. The Montgolfiers, however, lit a fire beneath and let the\r\nbag speak for itself. It gradually distended, assuming a beautiful\r\nform, and struggling to free itself from the men who were holding it.\r\nAt a given signal it was released; it ascended rapidly, and in ten\r\nminutes attained a height of 6,000 feet. It drifted a mile and a half\r\nand sank gently to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—MONTGOLFIER’S EXPERIMENTAL BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nWhen the French Academy learned of this event they desired to have\r\nan ascension in Paris, and at once started a public subscription to\r\ndefray the expense of constructing and inflating a balloon. They\r\nplaced the work in charge of the physicist Charles, after inviting the\r\nMontgolfiers to Paris, and finding they could not come immediately.\r\nCharles proved more than a substitute; he became a fertile inventor and\r\na rival in the new field. Aided by the skill of the Robert brothers, he\r\nmade a silk globe varnished with dissolved rubber, and filled it with\r\nhydrogen, which is many times lighter than hot air. The operation of\r\nfilling occupied three days, consuming 500 pounds of sulphuric acid and\r\nhalf a ton of iron. The globe was 13 feet in diameter, and designated\r\na “balloon,” or big ball. This had next to be moved from the place of\r\nfilling, in the Place des Victoires, to the Champ de Mars, two miles\r\ndistant, in order to have space enough to accommodate the increasing\r\ncrowd of spectators. Accordingly, on the 26th it was conveyed thither,\r\nin the dead of night, preceded by lighted torches, surrounded by a\r\ncortege, and escorted by foot and horse guards. Impressive and weird,\r\nindeed, was this nocturnal caravan of troops and towering globe\r\nadvancing slowly through the dark and silent streets. The astonished\r\ncab drivers knelt humbly, hat in hand, while the procession passed.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of this, the first hydrogen balloon, was a popular and\r\na memorable event. The field was lined with troops. The curious\r\nspectators had thronged every thoroughfare and darkened every housetop.\r\nIt was an all day festival, inaugurating a peculiarly French science,\r\nwith French animation. The booming of cannon announced to all Paris\r\nthe impending flight of the balloon. At five o’clock, in the presence\r\nof 50,000 spectators, and in a shower of rain, the balloon rose more\r\nthan half a mile and entered the clouds. The people overwhelmed with\r\nsurprise and enthusiasm, stood gazing upward, despite the rain,\r\nobserving every maneuver till the vessel had ascended and faded from\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—CHARLES’ FIRST HYDROGEN BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nThe landing of this little balloon did not leave it in a condition to\r\nexhibit proudly to future generations. After drifting three quarters\r\nof an hour, it fell in a field near Gonesse, a village fifteen miles\r\nfrom the place of ascension, apparently ruptured from overdistention.\r\nThe villagers flocked about it with curiosity and trepidation, ignorant\r\nof its nature, whether of bird kind or monster; and doubtful of its\r\norigin, whether natural or satanic. They fell upon it with flails and\r\npitchforks. When struck it smelt strongly of sulphur, indicating a\r\ndiabolic source. They finally hitched it to the tail of a horse which\r\ngalloping away in terror, badly damaged it. Whether this destruction\r\nwas wrought through fear or rustic hilarity, it induced the government\r\nof France to issue a notice to the public explaining the innocuous\r\nnature of a simple balloon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Joseph Montgolfier, having reached Paris, had\r\nconstructed a waterproof linen balloon 46 feet in diameter and\r\nornamented in oil colors, which was to be publicly launched at\r\nVersailles. On September 19, 1783, the king and queen, the court and a\r\nvast throng of people of every rank and age, assembled to witness the\r\nascension. Montgolfier explained to them every detail, and finally lit\r\nthe fire, about one o’clock. The great bag gradually expanded, rounding\r\nout in eleven minutes to a beautiful globular form, tugging upward with\r\na force of seven hundred pounds. Beneath was suspended a wicker cage\r\ncontaining the first aërial passengers—a sheep, a rooster and a duck.\r\nThe vessel rose majestically above the applauding multitude to a height\r\nof fourteen hundred feet, and drifted some two miles in eight minutes,\r\ndescending gradually in the wood at Vaucresson. The animals were tipped\r\nout on landing; but, when found by two game-keepers, they were none the\r\nworse for their strange journey. The sheep was grazing and the cock\r\ncrowing, says one report, while another relates that the sheep had\r\ntrampled on the rooster and lamed him.\r\n\r\nStephen Montgolfier now wishing to send up human passengers, made a\r\nballoon of 100,000 cubic feet capacity. It was shaped like a full lemon\r\npointing upward, with a cylindrical neck below, 16 feet in diameter.\r\nAround this neck was a wicker balcony three feet wide, to carry the\r\naëronauts, bundles of straw for fuel, pails of water and sponges to\r\nextinguish incipient conflagrations, here and there in the balloon,\r\nduring a journey. Through stokeholes in the side of the neck sheaves\r\nof straw could be forked to the grate suspended centrally below by\r\nradial chains. During inflation the base of the balloon rested on a\r\nplatform, and its top was supported by a rope stretched between two\r\npoles. The vessel when completed, in a garden of the Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine, was 85 feet high by 48 feet across, and weighed 1,600 pounds.\r\nAbout its zone, painted in oil, were elegant decorations; portraits,\r\ncyphers of the king’s name, fleur-de-lis, with fancy borders below and\r\nabove; while higher still, on the arching dome of the bag, were all the\r\nsigns of the celestial zodiac.\r\n\r\nThe handsome vessel was now ready; but what daring captain should\r\nnavigate her? King Louis proposed two prisoners who were under sentence\r\nof death, and had to be killed somehow. But the brave Pilâtre de\r\nRozier protested indignantly: “Eh quoi! de vils criminels auraient\r\nles premiers la gloire de senlever dans les airs! Non, non, cela ne\r\nsera point.” He stirred up the city, and finally prevailed, through\r\nthe entreaties of the Marquis d’Arlandes, who secured from the king\r\npermission to accompany his friend.\r\n\r\nAfter some days of preliminary practice in maneuvering the tethered\r\nballoon, these gentlemen were ready for an aërial voyage. On November\r\n21, 1783, the balloon was inflated in the garden of La Muette palace,\r\nand stocked with enough straw for an hour’s journey. When all was ready\r\nPilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes stepped with eager courage\r\ninto the gallery taking opposite sides to ensure proper balance. At two\r\no’clock they rose splendidly, amid the acclamations of a vast throng\r\nof spectators, and at the height of 280 feet, removing their hats,\r\nsaluted the surprised multitude. Encountering a south blowing wind,\r\nthey drifted five miles in some twenty minutes, and landed safely in a\r\nfield. The apparatus was soon assembled on a cart and returned to the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine, where it was originally constructed. The details\r\nof this first human voyage in a balloon are very interesting and well\r\ntold in a letter written by the Marquis d’Arlande to a member of the\r\nFrench Academy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—MONTGOLFIER’S PASSENGER BALLOON.]\r\n\r\n“At this time M. Pilâtre said: ‘You do nothing, and we shall not\r\nmount.’ ‘Pardon me,’ I replied. I threw a truss of straw upon the\r\nfire, stirring it a little at the same time, and then quickly turned\r\nmy face back again; but I could no longer see La Muette. Astonished,\r\nI gave a look to the direction of the river.... M. Pilâtre then said,\r\n‘See, there is the river, and observe that we descend.’ ‘Well, then,\r\nmy friend, let us increase the fire;’ and we worked away. But instead\r\nof crossing the river, as our direction seemed to indicate, which\r\ncarried us over the house of the Invalides, we passed along the island\r\nof Cygnes, reëntered over the principal bed of the river, and advanced\r\nup it as far as the gate de la Conference. I said to my intrepid\r\ncompanion: ‘See, there is the river &c.’ I stirred the fire, and took\r\nwith the fork a truss of straw, which from being too tight, did not\r\ntake fire very easily. I lifted it and shook it in the middle of the\r\nflame. The next moment I felt as if I were lifted up from under the\r\narms, and said to my companion, ‘Now we mount, &c.’ At the same time\r\nI heard a noise toward the top of the machine, as if it were going to\r\nburst; I looked, but did not see anything. However, as I was looking\r\nup, I felt a shock, which was the only one I experienced. The direction\r\nof the motion was from the upper part downwards. I said then: ‘What\r\nare you doing? Are you dancing?’ ‘I don’t stir,’ said he. ‘So much the\r\nbetter,’ I replied, ‘it is then a new current, which, I hope, will push\r\nus over the river.’ In fact, I turned myself in order to see where we\r\nwere, and I found myself between l’École Militaire and les Invalides,\r\nbeyond which place we had already gone about 2,500 feet. M. Pilâtre\r\nsaid at the same time: ‘We are on the plain.’ ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘and\r\nwe advance.’ ‘Work on,’ said he. I then heard another noise in the\r\nmachine, which appeared to be the effect of a rope breaking. This fresh\r\nadmonition made me examine attentively the interior of our habitation.\r\nI saw that the part of the machine which was turned toward the south\r\nwas full of round holes, many of which were of a considerable size. I\r\nthen said: ‘We must descend,’ and at the same time I took the sponge\r\nand easily extinguished the fire, which was round some holes that I\r\ncould reach; but leaning on the lower part of the linen, to observe\r\nwhether it adhered firmly to the surrounding circle, I found that the\r\nlinen was easily separated from it, on which I repeated that it was\r\nnecessary to descend. My companion said: ‘We are over Paris.’ ‘Never\r\nmind that,’ said I, ‘but look if there appears any danger for you on\r\nyour side—are you safe?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I examined my side, and found\r\nthat there was no danger to apprehend. Farther, I wetted with a sponge\r\nthose cords which were within my reach. They all resisted, except two,\r\nwhich gave way. I then said: ‘We may pass over Paris.’ In doing this,\r\nwe approached the tops of houses very sensibly; we increased the fire,\r\nand rose with the greatest ease. I looked below me, and perfectly\r\ndiscovered the Mission Étranger. It seemed as if we were going toward\r\nSaint-Sulpice, which I could perceive through the aperture of our\r\nmachine. On rising a current of air made us leave this direction, and\r\ncarried us toward the south. I saw on my left a sort of forest, which\r\nI took to be the Luxembourg; we passed over the Boulevard, and then I\r\nsaid: ‘Let us now descend.’ The fire was nearly extinguished; but the\r\nintrepid M. Pilâtre, who never loses his presence of mind, and who\r\nwent forward, imagining that we were going against the mills that are\r\nbetween Petite Gentilly and the Boulevard, admonished me. I threw a\r\nbundle of straw on the fire, and shaking it in order to inflame it more\r\neasily, we rose, and a new current carried us a little toward our left.\r\nM. Rozier said again: ‘Take care of the mills’; but as I was looking\r\nthrough the aperture of the machine, I could observe more accurately\r\nthat we could not meet with them, and said: ‘We are there.’ The moment\r\nafter, I observed that we went over a piece of water, which I took\r\nfor the river, but after landing, I recollected that it was the piece\r\nof water, &c. The moment we touched the ground, I raised myself up to\r\nthe gallery and perceived the upper part of the machine to press very\r\ngently on my head, I pushed it back, and jumped out of the gallery, and\r\non turning toward the machine, expected to find it distended, but was\r\nsurprised to find it perfectly emptied and quite flattened, &c.”\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing experiment was in progress, plans were matured for\r\nthe construction of a hydrogen balloon large enough to support two\r\npassengers and remain aloft many hours, without the need of carrying\r\ndangerous fuel. This type of balloon, called a _Charlière_, after its\r\ninventor, was destined largely to supersede the hot-air type, known\r\nas the _Montgolfière_, and indeed, to replace it entirely for free\r\nvoyages of considerable endurance and for most power voyages. The\r\nconstruction after the plan of Professor Charles was delegated to two\r\nvery intelligent mechanics, the Robert brothers who also had succeeded\r\nin dissolving caoutchouc, and thus producing a very superior balloon\r\nvarnish. The project was first announced in the _Journal de Paris_ of\r\nthe 19th of November 1783. As usual in those days of public enthusiasm,\r\na subscription was opened to defray the expenses of the experiment,\r\nestimated to cost about ten thousand francs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—CHARLES’ PASSENGER BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nThis balloon was a truly scientific creation, which advanced\r\naërostation from tottering infancy almost to full prime. The bag was\r\na sphere 27½ feet in diameter made of gores of varnished silk. A net\r\ncovered the upper half and was fastened to a horizontal hoop girding\r\nthe middle of the globe, and called the “equator.” From the equator\r\ndepended ropes which supported, just below the spherical bag, a wicker\r\nboat measuring eight feet by four, covered with painted linen and\r\nbeautifully ornamented. The balloon had at the bottom a silk neck 7\r\ninches in diameter, to admit the gas during inflation, and at the top,\r\na valve which could be opened by means of a cord in the boat to let\r\nout gas during a voyage, so as to lower the balloon, or to relieve\r\nexcessive pressure. In the boat were carried sand ballast to regulate\r\nthe height of ascension, a barometer to measure the elevation, anchor\r\nand rope for landing, a thermometer, notebook, provisions, and all the\r\nparaphernalia of a scientific voyage. Barring the fancy boat, this is\r\nalmost a description of a good modern balloon.\r\n\r\nThe inflation and ascension occurred in the Garden of the Tuileries,\r\nwhere the limp bag was initially suspended from a rope stretched\r\nbetween two trees. For three days and nights the hydrogen, drawn from\r\ntwenty barrels containing iron and dilute sulphuric acid, poured upward\r\nthrough the silken neck into the distending globe, which swelled in\r\nvolume to 1,400 cubic feet. Finally on a beautiful day, the first of\r\nDecember 1783, the Tuileries and all the neighborhood were crowded with\r\nspectators. A numerous guard of soldiers, stationed about the apparatus\r\nand grounds, preserved order. The fashion and nobility of Paris were\r\nthere, in ample splendor, attracted by the novelty and importance\r\nof the experiment, and the fame of the inventor. Shortly before two\r\no’clock Professor Charles presented to his friend, Montgolfier, a pilot\r\nballoon six feet in diameter, saying, “It is your prerogative to blaze\r\nthe way through the sky.” The pilot balloon was released, showing to\r\neveryone the direction of the aërial currents. Charles and Roberts\r\nstepped into the boat, seated themselves, and quickly rose into the\r\nsky. The multitude gazed in silent wonder. Presently they observed two\r\npennants waving high above them, though the navigators were scarcely\r\nvisible; whereupon they burst forth into wild enthusiasm and thunderous\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nImmediately a cavalcade set out in hot pursuit of the venturesome\r\nsailors. It was the first chase after an air ship, and a most vigorous\r\none. The balloon drifting northwestward at a speed of fifteen miles\r\nan hour, crossed the Seine, passed over several towns and villages,\r\nto the great astonishment of the inhabitants, and landed in a field\r\nnear Nesle. Here it was securely held by friendly peasants, to await\r\nthe advent of the official witnesses. Presently these arrived, drew\r\nup a certificate of descent and signed it. The Duke de Chartres, and\r\nthe Duke de Fitz-James, who had followed less swiftly, now rode up\r\nand signed the formal document, to the great gratification of the\r\naëronauts. The aërial journey had been a most delightful one, lasting\r\nabout two hours and covering nearly thirty miles.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the felicitations of his friends, Charles determined\r\nto reascend, in order to obtain further scientific observations. Owing\r\nto leakage and loss of buoyancy, he must now leave behind his pleasant\r\ncompanion. He had proposed replacing with earth, or stones, a part\r\nof Mr. Robert’s weight, but, finding none at hand, he signaled the\r\npeasants to let go, whereupon he rose with unusual speed. The remainder\r\nof this first and very remarkable scientific voyage is well told by the\r\nnavigator himself:\r\n\r\n  “In twenty minutes I was 1,500 fathoms high; out of sight of\r\n  all terrestrial objects. I had taken the necessary precautions\r\n  against the explosion of the globe, and prepared to make the\r\n  observations which I had promised myself. In order to observe\r\n  the barometer and thermometer, placed at the end of the car,\r\n  without altering the center of gravity, I knelt down in the\r\n  middle, stretching forward my body and one leg, holding my\r\n  watch in my left hand, and my pen and the string of the valve\r\n  in my right, waiting for the event. The globe, which, at my\r\n  setting out, was rather flaccid, swelled insensibly. The air\r\n  escaped in great quantities at the silken tube. I drew the\r\n  valve from time to time, to give it two vents; and I continued\r\n  to ascend, still losing air, which issued out hissing, and\r\n  became visible, like a warm vapor in a cold atmosphere. The\r\n  reason of this phenomenon is obvious. On earth, the thermometer\r\n  was 47°, or 15° above freezing point; after ten minutes’ ascent\r\n  it was only 21°, or 11° below. The inflammable air had not\r\n  had time to recover the equilibrium of its temperature. Its\r\n  elastic equilibrium being quicker than that of the heat, there\r\n  must escape a greater quantity than that which the external\r\n  dilatation of the air could determine by its least pressure.\r\n  For myself, though exposed to the open air, I passed in ten\r\n  minutes from the warmth of spring to the cold of winter; a\r\n  sharp dry cold, but not too much to be borne. I declare that,\r\n  in the first moment, I felt nothing disagreeable in the sudden\r\n  change. When the barometer ceased to fall, I marked exactly\r\n  18 inches 10 lines (20-01 in. English), the mercury suffering\r\n  no sensible oscillation. From this I deduce a height of 1,524\r\n  fathoms (3,100 yards), or thereabouts, till I can be more exact\r\n  in my calculation. In a few minutes more, my fingers were\r\n  benumbed by the cold, so that I could not hold my pen. I was\r\n  now stationary as to the rising and falling, and moved only in\r\n  an horizontal direction. I rose up in the middle of the car\r\n  to contemplate the scene around me. At my setting out the sun\r\n  was set on the valleys; he soon rose for me alone, who was the\r\n  only luminous body in the horizon, and all the rest of nature\r\n  in shade; he, however, presently disappeared, and I had the\r\n  pleasure of seeing him set twice in the same day. I beheld,\r\n  for a few seconds, the circumambient air and the vapors rising\r\n  from the valleys and rivers. The clouds seemed to rise from the\r\n  earth and collect one upon the other, still preserving their\r\n  usual form, only their color was gray and monotonous from the\r\n  want of light in the atmosphere. The moon alone enlightened\r\n  them, and showed me that I was tacking about twice; and I\r\n  observed certain currents that brought me back again. I had\r\n  several sensible deviations; and observed, with surprise, the\r\n  effects of the wind, and saw the streamers of my banners point\r\n  upwards. This phenomenon was not the effect of the ascent or\r\n  descent, for then I moved horizontally. At that instant I\r\n  conceived, perhaps a little too hastily, the idea of being able\r\n  to steer one’s course. In the midst of my transport I felt a\r\n  violent pain in my right ear and jaw, which I ascribed to the\r\n  dilatation of the air, in the cellular construction of those\r\n  organs, as much as to the cold of the external air. I was in a\r\n  waistcoat and bareheaded. I immediately put on a woolen cap,\r\n  yet the pain did not go off but as I gradually descended. For\r\n  seven or eight minutes I had ceased to ascend; the condensation\r\n  of the internal inflammable air rather made me descend. I now\r\n  recollected my promise to return in half an hour, and, pulling\r\n  the string of the valve, I came down. The globe was now so much\r\n  emptied, that it appeared only a half globe. I perceived a\r\n  fine ploughed field near the wood of Tour du Lay, and hastened\r\n  my descent. When I was between twenty or thirty fathoms from\r\n  the earth I threw out hastily two or three pounds of ballast,\r\n  and became for a moment stationary, till I descended gently\r\n  in the field, about a league from the place whence I set out.\r\n  The frequent deviations and turnings about make me imagine\r\n  that the voyage was near three leagues, and I was gone about\r\n  thirty-three minutes. Such is the certainty of the combinations\r\n  of our aërostatic machine, that I might have kept in the air at\r\n  least for twenty-four hours longer.”\r\n\r\nFurther interesting details of the first balloon experiments at Paris\r\nare furnished by Dr. Benjamin Franklin, then American Minister to\r\nFrance, in his letters written to Sir Joseph Banks, President of\r\nthe Royal Society of London, and presented in Appendix II of this\r\nbook. These quaint and substantial stories are well worth perusal\r\nas the expressions of a great diplomat and philosopher who, in the\r\nmidst of social and political activities, found time for scientific\r\ncorrespondence with his friends in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nAërial navigation was now become a practical art which should advance\r\nrapidly in popularity, in both Europe and America. Very soon ascensions\r\nwere made everywhere, for private amusement and for public exhibitions.\r\nNot a few were made for scientific, for military and for topographical\r\npurposes; thus giving the art a utilitarian as well as a sporting\r\nfeature. It will be interesting to note some of the more conspicuous\r\nascensions, voyages and improvements made in passive balloons\r\nsubsequently to the invention of _Montgolfières_ and _Charlières_.\r\n\r\nThe largest hot-air balloon ever constructed, _La Flesselle_, was\r\nlaunched from the suburbs of the city of Lyons on January 19, 1784,\r\njust two months after the ascent of the first human passengers. It was\r\nalso one of the most troublesome to assemble and keep in repair. Day by\r\nday, for more than a week, the balloon was inflated for the purpose of\r\nattaching the ropes to support the great gallery. But the wind blew\r\ndreadfully at times; rain and snow fell on the machine; frost and ice\r\ncovered the huge bag; many rents ensued, demanding frequent repairs.\r\nOn one occasion, when fed too freely with flame from straw sprinkled\r\nwith alcohol, the monstrous ship rose so vigorously as to drag fifty\r\nmen with it some distance along the ground. Finally on the 19th of\r\nJanuary, when the weather moderated, the operators built small fires\r\nunder the scaffold below the balloon, and thawed away the ice from\r\nthe drenched and frozen bag. Then they stocked its gallery with straw\r\nand pitchforks, with fire extinguishers, and other provisions for the\r\njourney. The inflation beginning about noon, occupied but seventeen\r\nminutes. The balloon swelled out rapidly, with the roaring flames\r\nascending inside, and at last stood forth huge and majestic before\r\nthe admiring multitude—a towering thing of magic growth, 100 feet in\r\ndiameter by 130 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe ascension of this gigantic vessel was immensely spectacular; but\r\nit was also most adventurous and foolhardy. The great bag, which at\r\nbest was made of poor materials, was in bad repair after its frequent\r\ninflations. But of the six passengers in the gallery not one could be\r\ninduced to remain behind to lessen the risk to the others. Their pilot,\r\nM. de Rozier, remonstrated with them; the proprietor M. C. Flesselle\r\nwished them to cast lots; but no one would abandon the journey. So,\r\nwith fear and reluctance, the pilot ordered the mooring ropes to be\r\ncut. Just as the ascent began, a seventh passenger, M. Fontaine, sprang\r\ninto the gallery and sailed aloft with the others. By vigorous stoking\r\nthe aërial sailors urged their fiery vessel upward three thousand feet,\r\nwhence, apparently without fear, they waved their hats to the vast\r\nthrong below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—LA FLESSELLE.]\r\n\r\nThe spectators were now in a frenzy of excitement. For more than a week\r\nthey had vacillated between hope and disappointment; but now they saw\r\nthe huge ship soaring into the sky, perhaps on her way to destruction.\r\nThey heard the blast of martial music and the booming of mortars. Then\r\nthe accumulated emotion of the multitude burst forth. Exclamations\r\nof joy, shrieks of fear, thunders of applause resounded above the\r\nsea of people. Finally the balloon began to burst, a dangerous rent\r\nrunning vertically along her side. The machine descended with great\r\nrapidity, to the alarm of everyone. It is reported that not fewer than\r\nsixty thousand people ran to the place of landing, with the greatest\r\napprehension for the lives of the travelers. But the adventurous men\r\nstepped forth from the gallery, after a fifteen minutes’ voyage,\r\nwithout hurt of any kind, save an insignificant scratch borne by Joseph\r\nMontgolfier, who on this occasion made his first and last ascension.\r\nThis was also the first and last ascension of that gigantic fire\r\nballoon; for although it furnished a world of delirious emotion and\r\nexcitement, the trouble of inflating the vessel was too great to be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the English Channel by balloon had been contemplated\r\nmany months by various adventurous spirits; and at length, on a fine\r\nday, the seventh of January, 1785, this feat was attempted by two\r\nintrepid men, the French aëronaut, M. Blanchard, and an American\r\nphysician, Dr. Jeffries, who had graduated at Harvard in 1763, and\r\nwas practicing medicine in England. Starting from the perpendicular\r\ncliff at Dover Castle, at one o’clock, they sailed in the direction of\r\nCalais, having with them only thirty pounds of sand ballast. This was\r\ntoo little for so long a voyage; but it would doubtless carry them a\r\nfew miles, in the favorable breeze then blowing. To their surprise,\r\nthe atmosphere seemed to grow lighter as they advanced over the water,\r\nletting them sink too freely. As they approached mid-channel they\r\nwere compelled to discharge all their ballast in order to maintain\r\ntheir level. But the balloon still descended, seemingly attracted by\r\nthe water. Then they ejected a parcel of books to gain a moment’s\r\nrelief. When three-fourths across the Channel they sighted the French\r\nCoast, which now they yearned to see at closer range; for the balloon\r\nwas contracting and sinking rapidly. They threw out from the boat\r\neverything available, wings, anchors, cords, provisions; yet they saw\r\nthe vessel persistently approaching the sea. Finally they cast off part\r\nof their clothing, fastened themselves to the cords suspended from\r\nthe balloon-ring, and prepared to cut away the boat. But presently\r\napproaching the coast near Calais, they began to rise; then ascended\r\nrapidly, soaring in a magnificent arch above the high grounds. At\r\nlast they descended gradually above the forest of Guines, seized the\r\nbranches of a tree to stop their flight, and at three o’clock were\r\nhappily landed. It was a thrilling voyage of two hours, and made a\r\nprofound impression at the time. As a mark of appreciation the King\r\npresented Blanchard a sum of 12,000 francs and a pension of 1,200\r\nfrancs per year. The people erected a monument on the place of landing\r\nto commemorate this extraordinary voyage.\r\n\r\nThis splendid achievement incited two Frenchmen to attempt a counter\r\nvoyage which ended disastrously. On June 15, 1785, Pilâtre de Rozier\r\nand M. Romain set out from Boulogne on a voyage from France to\r\nEngland, in a compound balloon composed of a hydrogen balloon forty\r\nfeet in diameter, below which was suspended a fire balloon ten feet\r\nin diameter. They hoped by judicious stoking of the lower balloon to\r\nobviate the sinking tendency suffered by Blanchard and Jeffries. But\r\nthe smaller globe proved a fatal auxiliary. Scarcely a quarter of an\r\nhour after launching, the whole apparatus was aflame at an altitude of\r\n3,000 feet, and presently fell in charred and hideous fragments upon\r\nthe seashore. M. Romain still showed some signs of life, but Pilâtre\r\nde Rozier was completely dead and all his bones were broken. They were\r\nthe first martyrs in the cause of the new science. Poor De Rozier\r\nknew on starting that his apparatus was in bad condition, but he had\r\nreceived for the purpose a sum of money from a distinguished patron,\r\nand therefore felt obliged in honor to attempt the voyage. He was\r\ntwenty-eight years old and engaged to be married to a young lady in the\r\nconvent at Boulogne, who eight days after the catastrophe which robbed\r\nher of her fiancé, died brokenhearted and in convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n               PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PASSIVE BALLOONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next important advance in practical ballooning was made by the\r\nsubstitution of coal gas for hydrogen. This was England’s contribution\r\nto an art which previously had not greatly flourished west of the\r\nChannel. It was a contribution following the natural growth of science;\r\nfor in 1814 coal gas began generally to be used for lighting London,\r\nand seven years later for inflating balloons. This valuable innovation\r\nwas made by the famous aëronaut, Charles Green, on the occasion of his\r\nfirst ascension, made July 19, 1821, the coronation day of George IV.\r\nThe new method largely superseded the old, extending throughout the\r\nworld with the spread of gas lighting; and it gave a powerful stimulus\r\nto aëronautics by rendering inflation cheap and convenient. Mr. Green\r\nhimself made 526 ascensions during his life, or at the rate of one\r\ncruise a month for nearly forty-four years. In due time, every country\r\nhad its professional aëronauts, and finally its amateurs, who, forming\r\nthemselves into aëro clubs, devoted themselves to racing in free\r\nballoons, inflated quite usually from a city gas supply.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Mr. Robert Holland organized an expedition designed to test the\r\nutmost capabilities of the balloon of his day, particularly in points\r\nof endurance and control. Engaging as pilot the first aëronaut of the\r\nage, Mr. Charles Green, and employing the largest gas balloon that ever\r\nhad been constructed, stocked with provisions enough to last three\r\nmen a fortnight, he invited a third person, Mr. Monck Mason, to join\r\nthem on a cruise from London to wherever the wind would take them, but\r\npreferably to land near Paris, as the balloon was to be delivered there\r\nafter the voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—THE GREAT BALLOON OF NASSAU.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel selected for that famous cruise was _The Great Balloon of\r\nNassau_, then recently built by Mr. Green and representing all that his\r\nskill and experience could devise. It was of pear shape, formed of\r\nthe finest crimson and white silk, “spun, wove and dyed expressly for\r\nthe purpose,” and comprising when distended a volume of 85,000 cubic\r\nfeet. From its stout balloon-ring six feet in diameter was suspended a\r\nwicker car measuring nine feet long by four wide, having a seat across\r\neither end, and a cushioned bottom to serve as a bed, if such should be\r\nneeded. Across the middle of the car was a plank supporting a windlass\r\nfor raising or lowering the guide-rope, that is a heavy rope which\r\ncould be trailed over land, or water, to keep the balloon at a nearly\r\nconstant level without expenditure of ballast, and to check its speed\r\non landing. This valuable device invented by Mr. Green in 1820, was\r\nnow to receive adequate trial, which, indeed, formed one of the chief\r\npurposes of the cruise. Other paraphernalia of the voyage were food\r\nand drink, warm clothing, lamps, trumpets, telescopes, barometers, a\r\nquicklime coffee-heater, a grapnel and cable, and a ton of sand ballast\r\nin bags.\r\n\r\nThe voyage proved well worthy of the elaborate preparations. At\r\none-thirty o’clock on November 7th, the three navigators arose\r\nfrom London, in presence of a mighty multitude, and drifted in a\r\nsoutheasterly direction traversing the cultivated plains of Kent, and\r\nin two hours passed the environs of Canterbury. Here they dropped\r\na parachute with a letter for the Mayor, which he duly received.\r\nContinuing their journey they floated leisurely above the tree tops,\r\ntalking to the inhabitants of the country, startling the fleet-winged\r\nquail, terrifying a colony of rooks, and finally reaching Dover at\r\nsundown, where they again dropped a letter for the Mayor of the city,\r\nwhich also was duly delivered.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment’s pause they drifted over the Channel into the\r\ngathering darkness. Before them rose a huge wall of vapor and black\r\nclouds standing on the bosom of the sea; behind them the twinkling\r\nlights and the music of breakers rolling on a hospitable shore.\r\nPresently they were immersed in a region of absolute silence and\r\nimpenetrable darkness. At times this deep stratum would slowly\r\ndissolve, revealing a glimpse of the dusky ocean and a passing ship;\r\nthen some huge wreath of vapor would involve them in bottomless gloom,\r\nwithout perspective, without apparent motion, without a sound to cheer\r\nor mark their dubious course. Now to avoid the risk of settling too\r\nnear the sea, as Blanchard and Jeffries had done, they were preparing\r\nto let down the guide-rope with floating ballast attached, when\r\nsuddenly they emerged from the pall of darkness, and were greeted by\r\nthe glittering lights of Calais, and the gentle sound of waters dashing\r\nupon the beach. They had crossed the Channel in one hour, and were\r\nsoaring serenely three thousand feet above the ocean, not having to\r\nlower the guide-rope to preserve their elevation.\r\n\r\nNow came the preparations for a night voyage over an obscurely defined\r\nland route. A simple rope one thousand feet long without ballast was\r\nallowed to trail beneath them. A lamp was lit. Coffee was heated by the\r\nslacking of quicklime. An ample store of viands and wine was spread on\r\nthe board in the middle of the car. The strenuous period of thought and\r\nlabor was past, and now three hungry men sat leisurely at dinner, after\r\na fast of twelve long hours. However sparing of bones and bottles,\r\nwhich later might serve as ballast, they were not economical of food\r\nand wine that evening. For the present they had only to live and be\r\nhappy as bachelors. Muffled in soft garments, well fed, abundantly\r\nserved with divine beverages, hot or cold; what finer picture of\r\nmasculine comfort and delight?\r\n\r\nThey were now floating tranquilly in the vast solitude of heaven, over\r\na teeming continent mantled in night and mystery. Far along earth’s\r\nsable surface gleam the scattered fires of many villages; and above\r\nit the lovelier fires of a moonless sky. Unseen, unsuspected, they\r\nsurvey kingdoms and cities, trailing their long rope serpent-like\r\nover woodland, field and quiet homestead. Now on the horizon before\r\nthem looms a greater fire, like a distant conflagration, widening as\r\nthey approach. Gradually it expands into a model city, shooting out\r\nlong lines of illuminated streets; here the public squares, markets\r\nand theatres; there the rumbling iron mills with blazing furnaces.\r\nThey are above Liege at her festive hour, murmuring with animation\r\nand busy life. Again they drift into the dark regions of slumber,\r\nlapped in silence and deep tranquillity, where the lights of men are\r\nextinguished, and the stars, redoubling their lustre, gleam whitest\r\nsilver in heaven’s jetty dome. Midnight involves the world; an abyss\r\nof darkness enfolds it; their solitary lamp seems to melt its way\r\nthrough solid space of blackest marble. For hours they undulate over\r\nthe rolling hills, rising and falling a thousand cubits, held always to\r\nearth by the trailing rope. At times they are so near as to trace the\r\nlandscape dimly; here a white tract covered lightly with snow, here a\r\ndark valley or forest, here a tortuous river, probably the Rhine, with\r\nits multitudinous thunder of waters. But in all that weird and obscure\r\nwandering no joyous note of human or animal life ascends ere dawn to\r\ncheer their solitary course in the sky.\r\n\r\nAt last the paling of the morning star, and a faint tingeing of the\r\neastern cumuli, announce the expected day. With sudden bound the\r\ngreat ship mounts aloft twelve thousand feet, into the glory of the\r\nblazing sun, new risen among clouds of amber and purple. Far below,\r\ntwilight and mist still mantle the half-awakened world, presenting a\r\nstupendous panorama, vast as an empire. Presently down they plunge into\r\nthe vaporous and obscure atmosphere, drifting carelessly, but soon\r\nreascending into the splendor of morning. Thus after making the sun\r\nrise three times and set twice, they float contentedly along the misty\r\nlandscape, marveling what region lies below them, whether a barren\r\nwilderness, or the abode of civilized life, with human comforts and a\r\nready means of transportation. A hot breakfast would be very welcome\r\nnow; for they had accidentally dropped the lime pot and had spent the\r\nlatter half of the night without warm beverage in a region where oil\r\nand water had frozen.\r\n\r\nAt length through the clearing vapor they perceive the country well\r\ntilled and populous; a good place to land to shorten their route to\r\nParis, and avoid the wide plains of Poland or Russia. They raise the\r\nguide-rope, lower the cable and anchor, open the valve, and descend\r\nin a grassy field near Weilburg, in the Duchy of Nassau. It is now\r\nseven-thirty o’clock, just eighteen hours since starting; and they\r\nhave traveled five hundred miles, the longest aërial voyage thus\r\nfar recorded. Very soon they are surrounded by a wondering crowd of\r\npipe-puffing, shaggy-headed, German peasants, by whose willing aid they\r\nfinally deflate the balloon, pack it in the bottom of the car, and\r\nmount it on a one-horse cart for Weilburg. Thence the aëronauts, after\r\na week of festivities in their honor, and distinguished attentions from\r\nthe highest officials of the town, embarked with their balloon for\r\nParis. This famous craft now bore its permanent title; for a few days\r\npreviously the lovely daughter of the Baron de Bibra, with seven other\r\nyoung ladies and Mr. Green, had stood within the air-inflated vessel,\r\npoured a generous libation of wine, and christened the hardy cruiser\r\n_The Great Balloon of Nassau_.\r\n\r\nIt was in truth a great balloon in various ways; in solidity and\r\nstrength, in workmanship, in completeness of appointment, in endurance\r\nand control. Having accomplished that long journey without a sign\r\nof weakness or defect, it was still in prime condition, proudly\r\nheading for the farthest verge of Europe. It had not, of course, the\r\ninstrumental equipment of a modern balloon; but it did possess the\r\nelements essential for a long and hard cruise. Since the day of its\r\nlaunching many additions have been added to the art, but these, for\r\nthe most part, are special adjuncts. The more important features of a\r\ngood balloon are practically the same to-day as when they were first\r\nintroduced by Professor Charles and sturdy old Mr. Green.\r\n\r\nA still more elaborate and colossal air ship was the _Geant_,\r\nconstructed in 1863, for A. Nadar of Paris. It was made of a double\r\nlayer of white silk, had a volume of 215,000 cubic feet and a buoyancy\r\nof 4½ tons. The car was a wicker cabin 13 feet wide by 7 feet high,\r\nwith a wicker balcony round the top so that the roof could be used\r\nas an observation deck—a delightful place to loll in the starlight,\r\nor watch the morning sun “flatter the mountain tops with sovereign\r\neye.” The closed car comprised two main rooms with a hallway between\r\nthem, one containing the captain’s bed and baggage, the other having\r\nthree superposed berths for passengers. Minor divisions of the car\r\nwere reserved for provisions, a lavatory, photography and a printing\r\npress, the latter to be used for the dissemination of news from the\r\nsky, as the navigators floated from state to state. A compensator\r\nballoon of 3,500 cubic feet, just below the main bag and connected\r\nwith it, received the escaping gas during expansion with increase of\r\ntemperature or altitude, and gave it back on contraction. In fact\r\nas well as in name, Nadar’s vessel was a giant. Curiously enough, he\r\ncalled it the “last balloon,” for he expected to realize enough money\r\nby exhibiting it, to inaugurate successful flying by means of the\r\nhelicopter, and thus banish ballooning from the world of futile effort\r\nto the domain of bygone dreams and chimæras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—CAR OF NADAR’S BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nThe first ascension, made on Sunday, October 4, 1863, was one of\r\nmagnificent promise. In the midst of a vast holiday throng on the Champ\r\nde Mars, the great globe towered aloft nearly two hundred feet, held to\r\nearth by one hundred men and twice as many sand bags. In the car were\r\nfifteen notable passengers including one lady, the fair young Princess\r\nde la Tour d’Auvergne, in morning toilet and a pretty hat. “Lachez\r\ntout!” shouts Captain Nadar, the effervescent photographer of Paris.\r\nAway they soar, heading for St. Petersburg, with provisions enough to\r\nsail beyond the polar sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain was now in supreme control, with the key to the victual\r\nand liquor room in his pocket, and his twelve commandments duly signed\r\nby all aboard. They had pledged themselves not to gamble, not to carry\r\ninflammable materials, not to smoke unduly, not to throw bottles\r\noverboard, not to quit the balloon without permission, but to descend\r\nif so ordered, etc. They had sailed at five o’clock in the evening and\r\nall was going merrily. But presently trouble came. The valve rope gave\r\nway, the vessel was sailing in the dark, and the Godards declared she\r\nwas drifting to sea, whereas she was drifting in quite the opposite\r\ndirection. To be on the safe side they threw out the anchors by\r\npermission of the commander. One anchor broke, but the other took hold\r\nand checked the balloon in spite of the strong wind blowing. At last\r\nafter three violent bumps on the ground they landed near Meaux at nine\r\no’clock in the evening, one passenger sustaining a broken knee, the\r\nothers various bruises. It was a grand adventure and all were pleased.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later a second voyage was begun in similar style, and again\r\nfrom the Champ de Mars, this time in the presence of the King of\r\nFrance and the young King George of Greece; but now Nadar took along,\r\nnot the Princess with the pretty hat, but Madame Nadar, his wife. To\r\nentertain the crowd before starting, thirty-two persons were first sent\r\naloft 300 feet and drawn back to earth. Finally at five o’clock Sunday\r\nevening, October 18th, a party of nine passengers soared proudly\r\nnorthward, well provisioned as before, and eager for a long voyage.\r\nThey disappeared in the gathering night, leaving their friends much\r\nconcerned for their safety and ultimate destination. At half past eight\r\nthey were over Compiegne, seventy-eight miles away, drifting near the\r\nground to say “All goes well” and have the good tidings transmitted\r\nto Paris. At nine they crossed the Belgian frontier; at midnight they\r\nwere over Holland; at sunrise they skirted the Zuyder Zee and entered\r\nHanover; at eight they were coursing headlong toward Nienburg and the\r\nNorth Sea in the current of a swift west wind.\r\n\r\nThey were now in great peril. If they went to sea they might all be\r\ndrowned; if they came to earth at such horizontal speed they should\r\nbe terribly pounded. Choosing the latter evil, they opened the valve\r\nand threw down the grappling irons. “To the ropes,” shouted the Godard\r\nbrothers. Assembling on deck all clung to the suspension ropes to\r\nmitigate the shock of landing. Nadar put his arm about his wife to\r\nprotect her. The anchors snatching a tree, uprooted and dragged it\r\nalong; then caught and tore off the roof of a house; threshed into\r\na telegraph line pulling down the wires and poles; struck into some\r\nfirmer obstacle and broke off completely, leaving the huge monster\r\nto sweep unchecked in the violent ground current. Owing to trouble\r\nwith the valve, the gas could not be liberated quickly; the great\r\nvessel again and again plunged to earth and rebounded high in air,\r\nits ponderous basket crashing through heavy timber, and breaking\r\ndown whatever opposed its course. For nine miles they pounded over\r\nthe plain by Nienburg toward the sea, dashing into pools, bogs and\r\nthickets, their limbs sprained or broken, their bodies bruised, their\r\nfaces splashed with mud. Presently through loss of gas the rebounding\r\nceased, the basket dragged along the earth squeezing some of the\r\npassengers beneath it, and dumping others out on the ground, leaving\r\nthem behind. Those remaining tried to assist Madam Nadar to land, but\r\nthey were tumbled out and she was caught under the basket from which\r\nshe was extricated with much difficulty, when the balloon was finally\r\nhalted. Thus their memorable voyage of seventeen hours, covering 750\r\nmiles, had a terrific, though not fatal ending. One had a broken femur,\r\nanother a dislocated thigh, others numerous scratches and contusions.\r\nBut no complaint was uttered; for the afflictions were regarded as\r\nnatural concomitants to such interesting sport. After some days tender\r\nnursing by the Germans, and solicitous inquiries from the King of\r\nHanover, they returned to Paris; some indeed on their backs, but for\r\nall that, none the less admired by their countrymen, as survivors of a\r\nmarvelous adventure.\r\n\r\nAnother valiant English leader in aërostation was James Glaisher,\r\nmember of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\r\nAs one of a committee of twelve appointed by that body in 1861, to\r\nexplore the higher strata of the atmosphere by means of the balloon,\r\nhe volunteered his services as an observer, when no other capable man\r\ncould offer to do so. With a professional aëronaut, Mr. Coxwell, and a\r\nnew balloon specially constructed for the work, cubing 90,000 feet, he\r\nmade eleven ascensions for the society, four from Wolverhampton, seven\r\nfrom Woolwich. Incidentally he made seventeen other ascents of various\r\naltitude; not at the expense of the committee, but as a scientific\r\npassenger in public balloon ascents advertised beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the enterprise were first to study the physical\r\nconditions of the atmosphere; secondly to study the effect of the\r\nhigher regions upon the passengers themselves, and some pigeons,\r\nwhich they carried along; thirdly to make some observations in\r\nacoustics and magnetism, particularly to determine the period of\r\noscillation of a magnet at various altitudes. The specific study of\r\nthe atmosphere itself was to comprise observations at all altitudes,\r\nof the temperature of the air, its pressure, and percentage of\r\nmoisture; observations of the velocity and direction of the wind,\r\nthe constitution of the clouds, their height, density and depth, the\r\nconstitution and electrical properties of the air. They were also to\r\ncollect samples of the air at different elevations, which later might\r\nbe examined in the laboratory. Thus the voyages were systematically\r\nplanned for scientific research, and were the first thorough attempts\r\nin England, though similar efforts had been made previously in France.\r\nIt may be added that Glaisher’s observations were the most important\r\nmade during the first century of aëronautics, and may be found fully\r\ndetailed by that hardy investigator himself in the British Association\r\nReports for 1862-66.\r\n\r\nMr. Glaisher’s most interesting voyage of that memorable series\r\noccurred on September 5, 1862. Starting from Wolverhampton at three\r\nminutes after one o’clock, they soared swiftly upward, passing through\r\na cloud eleven hundred feet thick and emerging in a glorious field\r\nof sunlight with an amethystine sky above and a boundless sea of\r\nvapor beneath; a sea of rolling hills and mountain chains, with great\r\nsnow-white masses steaming up from their surface. They had left the\r\nnoisy bustle of earth in the comfortable temperature of 59°; in three\r\nquarters of an hour, they were five miles aloft in a deadly silent\r\natmosphere, two degrees below zero, and approaching one third its usual\r\ndensity, the balloon neck white with hoar frost, the men gasping for\r\nbreath. Here the observations became increasingly interesting but\r\nimmensely more difficult. They are graphically told in the following\r\nextract from Mr. Glaisher’s classical report:\r\n\r\n  “I asked Mr. Coxwell to help me to read the instruments, as I\r\n  experienced a difficulty in seeing. In consequence, however,\r\n  of the rotatory motion of the balloon, which had continued\r\n  without ceasing since the earth had been left, the valve-line\r\n  had become twisted, and he had to leave the car and mount into\r\n  the ring above to adjust it. At this time I looked at the\r\n  barometer, and found it to be 10 inches, still decreasing\r\n  fast; its true reading therefore, was 9¾ inches, implying a\r\n  height of 29,000 feet. Shortly afterwards I laid my arm upon\r\n  the table, possessed of its full vigor, and on being desirous\r\n  of using it, I found it powerless; it must have lost its power\r\n  momentarily. I tried to move the other arm, and found it\r\n  powerless also. I then tried to shake myself, and succeeded\r\n  in shaking my body. I seemed to have no limbs. I then looked\r\n  at the barometer; whilst doing so my head fell on my left\r\n  shoulder. I struggled and shook my body again, but could not\r\n  move my arms. I got my head upright, but for an instant only,\r\n  when it fell on my right shoulder, and then I fell backwards,\r\n  my back resting against the side of the car, and my head on\r\n  its edge; in this position my eyes were directed towards Mr.\r\n  Coxwell in the ring. When I shook my body I seemed to have full\r\n  power over the muscles of the back and considerable power over\r\n  those of the neck, but none over either my arms or my legs; in\r\n  fact I seemed to have none. As in the case of the arms, all\r\n  muscular power was lost in an instant from my back and neck. I\r\n  dimly saw Mr. Coxwell in the ring and endeavored to speak, but\r\n  could not; when in an instant intense black darkness came, the\r\n  optic nerve finally lost power suddenly. I was still conscious,\r\n  with as active a brain as at the present moment whilst writing\r\n  this. I thought I had been seized with asphyxia, and that I\r\n  should experience no more, as death would come, unless we\r\n  speedily descended; other thoughts were actively entering my\r\n  mind, when I suddenly became unconscious as in going to sleep.\r\n  I cannot tell anything of the sense of hearing; the perfect\r\n  stillness and silence of the regions six miles from the earth\r\n  (and at this time we were between six and seven miles high) is\r\n  such that no sound reaches the ear.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLAISHER AND COXWELL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARSEVAL KITE BALLOON.]\r\n\r\n  “My last observation was made at 1 h. and 54 m., at 29,000\r\n  feet. I suppose two or three minutes fully were occupied\r\n  between my eyes becoming insensible to seeing fine divisions,\r\n  and 1 h. 54 m., and then that two or three minutes more passed\r\n  till I was insensible; therefore I think this took place at\r\n  about 1 h. 56 m. or 1 h. and 57 m. Whilst powerless I heard\r\n  the words, ‘temperature’ and ‘observation,’ and I knew Mr.\r\n  Coxwell was in the car speaking to me, and endeavoring to\r\n  arouse me, therefore consciousness and hearing had returned. I\r\n  then heard him speak more emphatically, but I could not see,\r\n  speak or move. I heard him again say, ‘Do try—now do.’ Then I\r\n  saw the instruments dimly, then Mr. Coxwell, and very shortly\r\n  saw clearly. I rose in my seat and looked round, as though\r\n  waking from sleep, though not refreshed by sleep, and said to\r\n  Mr. Coxwell, ‘I have been insensible;’ he said, ‘You have;\r\n  and I, too, very nearly.’ I then drew up my legs, which had\r\n  been extended before me, and took a pencil in my hand to begin\r\n  observations. Mr. Coxwell told me he had lost the use of his\r\n  hands, which were black, and I poured brandy on them.\r\n\r\n  “I resumed my observations at 2 h. 7 m., recording the\r\n  barometer reading at 11.53 inches, and temperature −2°. I\r\n  suppose three or four minutes were occupied from the time of my\r\n  hearing the words ‘temperature’ and ‘observation’ till I began\r\n  to observe; if so, then returning consciousness came at 2 h.\r\n  and 4 m., and this gives seven minutes for total insensibility.\r\n  I found the water in the vessel supplying the wet-bulb\r\n  thermometer, which I had by frequent disturbances kept from\r\n  freezing, was one solid mass of ice; and it did not all melt\r\n  until after we had been on the ground some time.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Coxwell told me that whilst in the ring he felt it\r\n  piercingly cold; that hoar-frost was all round the neck of the\r\n  balloon. On attempting to leave the ring he found his hands\r\n  frozen, and he had to place his arms on the ring and drop\r\n  down; that he thought for a moment I had laid back to rest\r\n  myself; that he spoke to me without eliciting a reply; that\r\n  he then noticed my legs projected and my arms hung down by my\r\n  side; that my countenance was serene and placid, without the\r\n  earnestness and anxiety he had noticed before going into the\r\n  ring, and then it struck him I was insensible. He wished to\r\n  approach me, but could not, and he felt insensibility coming\r\n  over himself; that he became anxious to open the valve, but in\r\n  consequence of having lost the use of his hands he could not,\r\n  and ultimately did so by seizing the cord with his teeth and\r\n  dipping his head two or three times until the balloon took a\r\n  decided turn downwards. This act is quite characteristic of\r\n  Mr. Coxwell. I have never yet seen him without a ready means\r\n  of meeting every difficulty, as it has arisen, with a cool\r\n  self-possession that has always left my mind perfectly easy,\r\n  and given me every confidence in his judgment in the management\r\n  of so large a balloon.\r\n\r\n  “No inconvenience followed the insensibility; and when we\r\n  dropped it was in a country where no conveyance of any kind\r\n  could be obtained, so that I had to walk between seven or eight\r\n  miles.\r\n\r\n  “The descent was at first very rapid; we passed downwards three\r\n  miles in nine minutes; the balloon’s career was then checked,\r\n  and we finally descended in the center of a large grass-field\r\n  belonging to Mr. Kersall, at Cold Weston, seven-and-a-half\r\n  miles from Ludlow.\r\n\r\n  “I have already said that my last observation was made at\r\n  a height of 29,000 feet; at this time (1 h. 45 m.) we were\r\n  ascending at the rate of 1,000 feet per minute; and when I\r\n  resumed observations we were descending at the rate of 2,000\r\n  feet per minute. These two positions must be connected, taking\r\n  into account the interval of time between, viz. 13 minutes,\r\n  and on those considerations the balloon must have attained\r\n  the altitude of 36,000 or 37,000 feet. Again, a very delicate\r\n  minimum thermometer read—12, and this would give a height of\r\n  37,000 feet. Mr. Coxwell, on coming from the ring, noticed that\r\n  the center of the aneroid barometer, its blue hand, and a rope\r\n  attached to the car, were all in the same straight line, and\r\n  this gave a reading of 7 inches, and leads to the same result.\r\n  Therefore these independent means all lead to about the same\r\n  elevation, viz. fully SEVEN MILES.\r\n\r\n  “In this ascent six pigeons were taken up. One was thrown out\r\n  at the height of three miles, when it extended its wings and\r\n  dropped as a piece of paper; a second, at four and five miles,\r\n  and it fell downward as a stone. A fourth was thrown out at\r\n  four miles on descending. It flew in a circle, and shortly\r\n  alighted on the top of the balloon. The two remaining pigeons\r\n  were brought down to the ground. One was found to be dead, and\r\n  the other, a ‘carrier,’ was still living, but would not leave\r\n  the hand when I attempted to throw it off, till after a quarter\r\n  of an hour it began to peck a piece of ribbon which encircled\r\n  its neck, and was then jerked off the finger, and flew with\r\n  some vigor toward Wolverhampton. One of the pigeons returned to\r\n  Wolverhampton on Sunday the 7th, and it is the only one that\r\n  has been heard of.”\r\n\r\nThis was the loftiest ascent ever made up to that time; and thus\r\nGlaisher, or rather Coxwell, who was in the ring above him, could be\r\ncalled the “highest man” of the first century of aëronautics. Their\r\ngreatest elevation, however, is now generally estimated at much less\r\nthan seven miles, and probably below six miles, due allowance being\r\nmade for inaccuracies of estimate made by Mr. Glaisher. His results,\r\nnevertheless, were considered valuable, revealing as they did, that the\r\nballoon may be used safely up to the neighborhood of five miles; that\r\nthe temperature of the atmosphere does not, as previously supposed,\r\ndecline one degree for each 300 feet of ascent, but often declines\r\nmore rapidly, and sometimes even increases with the elevation for\r\nconsiderable stretches; that the moisture percentage is extremely\r\nslight at an altitude beyond five miles; that at all elevations\r\nattainable by man the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers can be used\r\neffectively, etc.\r\n\r\nA still loftier ascent was made by Professor Berson of Germany,\r\naided by the respiration of oxygen. On July 31, 1901, accompanied by\r\nDr. Süring, he ascended from Berlin in the balloon _Preussen_ to an\r\nelevation of 10,800 meters, which at present constitutes the world’s\r\nrecord for altitude. The balloon had a capacity of 300,000 cubic feet,\r\nand left the ground two thirds filled with hydrogen, and carrying 8,000\r\npounds of ballast in the form of sand bags attached to the sides of the\r\nbasket, so that they could be cut loose with the slightest physical\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe _Preussen_ was one of the largest passive balloons ever\r\nconstructed. In cubic capacity it was comparable with the colossal\r\n_Montgolfière_, _La Flesselle_, already described, and the huge free\r\nballoon _Le Geant_, constructed by Nadar in 1863. But all were\r\neclipsed by the great balloon of Henri Giffard. This latter measured\r\n450,000 cubic feet, and even to-day ranks as the largest captive\r\nballoon ever constructed. It was a familiar object at the Paris\r\nExposition of 1878, where it was installed by the famous inventor\r\nHenri Giffard, to give sightseers a bird’s-eye view of Paris. It could\r\ntake up forty persons at one time, or eight more than once ascended in\r\nNadar’s _Geant_.\r\n\r\nNo serious attempt has been made to surpass the altitude flight of\r\nProfessor Berson and Dr. Süring; for though it is easily possible to\r\ncarry human beings to a greater height than seven miles, the results\r\nseem hardly to justify the cost. To ascend very much higher would\r\nrequire an enormous and costly balloon, and to ensure the comfort\r\nof the passenger might require an air-tight car, or armor supplied\r\ncontinuously with fresh air, or oxygen. Such a suit, or car, however,\r\ncan be made very light, since its pressure must naturally be internal;\r\nand it would admit of an extremely rapid change of elevation without\r\ndiscomfort to the passenger. A steel bottle weighing fifty pounds,\r\nand filled with compressed air, or oxygen, would supply a passenger\r\nseveral hours, and allow him to breathe under normal pressure. The\r\ntotal weight of a bottle and air-tight car, or suit, need not exceed\r\nthe weight of a man. Moreover, the ballast could be largely dispensed\r\nwith, thus admitting of a very rapid ascent from the earth. A celluloid\r\ncar would have the advantage of transparency, though it might become\r\ntoo brittle at very low temperatures. A suit, or car, with glass\r\nportholes would serve in lieu of a celluloid car for transparency. The\r\nusual balloon and basket, carrying a steel bottle, furnishing air at\r\nnormal pressure to a man in a rubberized silk suit is a sufficiently\r\nsimple and practicable device; the air entering the suit near his\r\nmouth and leaving below through a check valve regulated to maintain the\r\ndesired internal pressure. An air-tight silk fabric capable of enduring\r\nsafely a tensile stress of 150 pounds per running inch would answer the\r\npurposes. But at present there seems to be no incentive to attempt a\r\nballoon trip exceeding the heights already attained, unless it be that\r\nof notoriety or sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe French meteorologists have devised a much simpler and cheaper\r\nmethod of exploring the upper atmosphere, by use of small balloons\r\ncarrying recording instruments. An ordinary silk or gold-beater\r\nskin balloon, partly inflated, ascends to a great height with the\r\ninstruments, drifts away losing gas, and on landing is found by some\r\none who returns it according to written directions accompanying the\r\ncraft. Another method, introduced by Professor Assman, is to employ\r\nclosed rubber balloons which at great altitudes burst by the expansion\r\nof the hydrogen within them, and allow the instruments to descend\r\nin parachutes softly to the ground. Instrument-carrying balloons of\r\nthe above type are called “sounding balloons,” or _balloons sondes_,\r\nwhereas if they carry no instruments, but merely show the course of the\r\nwind, they may be called “pilot balloons.” Such sounding balloons have\r\nbeen used to explore the temperature of the atmosphere to an altitude\r\nof 18 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages some extended balloon voyages have been\r\ndescribed. These were considered very long in their day, but in recent\r\nyears have been surpassed frequently, first by the professional\r\naëronauts, then by the amateurs and members of various aëronautic\r\nclubs practicing aërostation as a sport, and stimulated by attractive\r\nprizes. But the man who achieved the longest balloon flight during the\r\nfirst century of the art, seems to have been Mr. John Wise, America’s\r\nforemost pioneer balloonist.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise was a rare composite of showman, scientist, sport and\r\ndare-devil, who during the four decades succeeding his first ascension\r\nat Philadelphia in 1835, made no fewer than 440 voyages. At first the\r\naërial art captivated him by the beauty and sublimity of the natural\r\npanoramas witnessed from on high; then he amused himself by dropping\r\nthings from the basket and hearing them whistle through space; and\r\nfinally he coquetted with the balloon itself, in various ways to\r\nobserve the result. On one occasion the neck was choked and the\r\nvalve could not be operated, so that when the hydrogen expanded with\r\nincreasing altitude, it overstretched the cover and started a rent in\r\nthe side of the bag. The balloon descended rapidly, but landed without\r\ninjurious shock.\r\n\r\nThe audacious aëronaut then decided to make an ascension and\r\ndeliberately burst the balloon, by confining the gas in it and throwing\r\nout ballast. But first he tried the experiment on a dog, taking him up\r\n4,000 feet, dropping him in a small collapsed balloon and watching him\r\nsettle slowly to earth. Then rising to an altitude of 13,000 feet he\r\nstood debating whether to follow the example of the dog. The balloon\r\nquickly ended the question by exploding at the top. The hydrogen rushed\r\nout with a tempestuous sound, and the great vessel sank swiftly with a\r\nmoaning noise of the wind in her rigging. In a few seconds the bag was\r\nempty and collapsed on the top of the net thus forming an effective\r\nparachute. After an exciting fall of more than two miles, Mr. Wise\r\nlanded on a farm, with a lively thump, which overturned the basket, and\r\nthrew him sprawling on the ground. It was fine sport; he decided at\r\nonce to advertise a repetition of it, and thus was led by degrees to\r\nthe invention of the ripping panel.[7]\r\n\r\nMr. Wise firmly believed that a steady wind from west to east prevails\r\nat a height of two miles. He wished to use this for long voyages, and\r\neven contemplated crossing the Atlantic; for he trusted his varnish to\r\nhold hydrogen a fortnight if need be. Accordingly in 1873 the New York\r\n_Daily Graphic_ paid the cost of a balloon to carry him and two others\r\non that hazardous voyage. The bag had a capacity of 400,000 cubic feet,\r\nbut was too frail in construction to receive Mr. Wise’s approval, and\r\nactually burst during inflation when slightly more than three fourths\r\nfull. Fortunately, perhaps, for Mr. Wise, he never had an opportunity\r\nto attempt the trans-Atlantic voyage; but on one occasion he enjoyed a\r\nmemorable cruise in the great west wind which so took his fancy. Rising\r\nfrom St. Louis on June 23, 1859, he sailed northeastwardly for twenty\r\nhours, and landed at Henderson, N. Y., having traversed a distance of\r\n809 miles, measured directly. But in attempting another long voyage\r\nwith two companions, in September, 1879, he passed over Lake Michigan,\r\nwhere all were drowned.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Mr. Wise’s long voyage has been exceeded several\r\ntimes. In 1897 M. Godard sailed from Leipsic to Wilna, a distance of\r\n1,032 miles in 24½ hours; but this was not an official flight nor in a\r\ndirect course as the crow flies. In October, 1900, M. Balsan voyaged\r\nfrom Vincennes, France, to Rodom, Russia, a distance of 843 miles in\r\n27 hours and 25 minutes, and De la Vaulx starting from the same point\r\nlanded at Korosticheff, Russia, having traversed 1,193 miles in 35¾\r\nhours. This latter is the longest balloon flight thus far recorded. A\r\nclose second to this record was made by A. R. Hawley in his spherical\r\nballoon _America_, aided by Augustus Post, in the Gordon Bennett\r\nInternational Balloon Race of 1910. Sailing from St. Louis, October\r\n17th, they drifted 1,172.9 miles from their starting point, and landed\r\nin a great forest at Peribonka River, North Lake Chilogoma, Canada,\r\nwhere they were lost for several days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—DIAGRAM OF A MODERN SPHERICAL BALLOON WITH\r\nRIPPING PANEL.]\r\n\r\nQuite as eventful was the ocean voyage of Walter Wellman, who left\r\nAtlantic City October 15, 1910, for Europe in a motor balloon with a\r\ndrag rope, or equilibrator, voyaged with favorable wind to a point\r\n140 miles northeast of Nantucket Island, then was driven by adverse\r\nwind toward Bermuda, and finally rescued by a passing steamer, after\r\n69 hours in the air and a journey of about one thousand miles. A full\r\naccount of this strange voyage is given in the New York _Times_ of\r\nOctober 19, 1910, and in the _Scientific American_ of subsequent date.\r\n\r\nThe recent advances in aërostation, though not radically changing the\r\nballoon itself, contribute much to its usefulness and convenience.\r\nImprovements have occurred in the means of inflation and deflation,\r\nin devices for making topographical and meteorological observations,\r\nas also for transmitting and receiving signals. Hydrogen shipped in\r\nsteel tubes is now available for easy and rapid inflation, the process\r\nof obtaining it on a large scale making it practically as cheap as\r\nilluminating gas. The ripping panel, invented in 1844 by America’s\r\nforemost pioneer aëronaut, John Wise, is a simple and an excellent\r\npractical device. This is a long patch running longitudinally above the\r\nequator[8] of the balloon, feebly sewed to the envelope, and having a\r\ncord, called the “ripping cord,” extending down to the car along the\r\noutside or inside of the bag, so that the pilot on coming to earth\r\ncan let out the gas quickly by tearing a rent in the balloon, thus\r\nflattening it promptly on the earth’s surface, so as to avoid dragging\r\nand bumping if any wind prevails. During an ascension the rise or fall\r\nof the vessel may be instantly noted on the dial of the statoscope,\r\nthe temperature, pressure and moisture of the atmosphere may be read\r\non recording instruments, messages may be sent by telegraph and\r\ntelephone either by wire or through space, and sky or landscape may\r\nbe photographed if there be sufficient light. The bag itself has been\r\nimproved by making it of special fabrics formed of several layers of\r\nsilk, or cotton, with thin layers of rubber vulcanized between them\r\nto render the cloth impermeable, also the bag, when not designed to\r\ncleave the wind, is usually given a spherical form which is the figure\r\nof greatest volume for a given surface, the figure originally used by\r\nthe inventor of the gas balloon; but when designed to be tethered in\r\na wind, it is given a longish shape and a tail so that it may ride\r\nthe wind like a kite. This type of balloon, though first proposed by\r\nDouglass Archibald about 1845, was first made a practical invention by\r\nCaptain von Sigsfeld and Major von Parseval. In a certain sense it is a\r\ntethered motor-balloon, just as a kite is a tethered aëroplane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                    EARLY HISTORY OF POWER BALLOONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly after the first launching of human passengers in a crude\r\naërostat, numerous schemes for controlling the course of a balloon were\r\nevolved. Apparently mere flotation afforded less contentment to the\r\nearly pioneer aëronauts than to the free balloonists of the present\r\nhour. Many were eager to apply propelling mechanism to their gas bags,\r\nexpecting thus to achieve practical locomotion through the air, even a\r\ngeneration before the advent of practical steam navigation. Magnificent\r\ndreams they had, indeed, but none the less futile. Few suspected the\r\nenormous power required to propel swift balloons of the very best shape\r\nand size; still fewer realized the impossibility of driving spherical\r\nbags at a practicable velocity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be said, to the credit of that era of\r\ninvestigators, that certain noted scientists, after computing the power\r\nrequired to drive a balloon at high speed, promptly recognized the\r\ninadequacy to that task, of any motors then available. In conjunction\r\nwith favorable aërial currents something might be effected; that they\r\nfully grasped; for they knew that the wind frequently has different\r\ndirections at different levels. They believed, therefore, that by\r\ncausing the craft to rise or fall to a suitable stratum, by use of\r\nvarious then known devices, it could be made to travel in any direction\r\nat the will of the pilot. Likewise they deemed that the rise and fall\r\nof a balloon, due to change of buoyancy, could be used to propel it, if\r\nsails attached to the vessel were set obliquely to the motion, so as to\r\nreceive fair pressure; or if the balloon were made flat, or longish, so\r\nas to glide horizontally, like a kite or parachute.\r\n\r\nSeveral devices for changing the altitude of the balloon were proposed\r\nor tried. If the vessel were a _Montgolfière_, the mere increase or\r\nlessening of the fire would promptly cause it to rise or fall. If a gas\r\nbag were employed it could be sent up or down by casting out ballast\r\nor opening the valve; or again, as proposed by Pilâtre de Roziere, by\r\nhaving a _Montgolfière_ underneath the gas balloon, and lifting or\r\ndepressing the whole by altering the intensity of the flame. Finally,\r\nan air balloon within a gas balloon was proposed by the Roberts, and a\r\ngas balloon within an air balloon was proposed by General Meusnier, in\r\neither of which combinations, a change of level could be effected by\r\npumping air into, or letting it escape from, the air bag. All of these\r\ndevices can be effected and practically operated by a competent balloon\r\nmaker and pilot; and yet they have not enabled man to realize his dream\r\nof navigating the air in all directions without motive power.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at balloon propulsion could not be seriously\r\nregarded by trained engineers, even at the inception of aëronautics;\r\nbut still, as infantile steps in the new art, they may deserve passing\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nBlanchard, on March 2, 1784, made the first real effort to steer a\r\nballoon, using for that purpose a spherical gas bag and car provided\r\nwith aërial oars and a rudder. As he was about to ascend, however,\r\nfrom the Champs de Mars, a young officer with drawn sword persisted in\r\naccompanying the pilot, thus compelling Blanchard to leave his wings\r\non earth to allow sufficient buoyancy for himself and his obtrusive\r\nguest. His first trial was, therefore, frustrated; but subsequent ones\r\nmade with that inadequate contrivance also proved futile under the best\r\ncircumstances; for the scheme was evidently puerile, though tried by\r\nvarious grown-up men besides M. Blanchard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—BLANCHARD’S DIRIGIBLE BALLOON, 1784.]\r\n\r\nA no less simple and quaint device for propulsion was that of the\r\ntwo physicists, the Abbé Miolan and Janinet. The balloon was a\r\n_Montgolfière_ with a large hole in one side, through which the hot air\r\nwas to escape with such strong reaction as to drive the bag forward, on\r\nthe principle of a lawn sprinkler, or of Newton’s reaction wagon. The\r\nprojectors failed, however, to make an ascent, and the crowd becoming\r\nfurious destroyed the balloon.\r\n\r\nA more reasonable plan for practical navigation was devised and tried\r\nby the Robert brothers. A melon-shaped balloon, fifty-two feet long by\r\nthirty-two feet in diameter, was made of silk and inflated with pure\r\nhydrogen. Beneath was suspended a longish car of light wood covered\r\nwith sky-blue silk. This elegant ship was to be rowed through heaven by\r\nmeans of six silken oars actuated by sturdy sailors. A silken rudder\r\nshould guide her at pleasure when the winds were asleep, or softly\r\nplaying in the placid sky. She was a fairy bark, indeed, a soaring\r\ncastle lovely to behold.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary trial, accompanied by their patron, the Duke de\r\nChartres, they were ready for a substantial journey. On September 19,\r\n1784, the vessel was inflated and taken to the Garden of the Tuileries,\r\nin front of the palace, where its cords were held by Marshall Richelieu\r\nand three other noblemen. At eleven forty-five the two Roberts and\r\ntheir brother-in-law arose and drifted beyond the horizon on a seven\r\nhours’ cruise. Before coming to earth, they plied the oars vigorously,\r\nand described a curve of one kilometer radius, thus deviating 22° from\r\nthe feeble wind then prevailing. In a lighter wind they could deviate\r\nstill more. They considered, therefore, that the experiment was a\r\ncomplete success. They had constructed the first elongated balloon,\r\nand had “solved the problem of aërial navigation.” In very happy mood,\r\ntherefore, they landed at dusk among the delighted inhabitants of\r\nArtois, where they were graciously met and hospitably entertained by\r\nthe Prince de Ghistelles-Richbourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—ROBERT BROTHERS’ DIRIGIBLE, 1784.]\r\n\r\nThe Robert brothers were the first to employ in practice an air bag\r\ninside a gas bag. This was held within the balloon by ropes and\r\nconnected with the outer atmosphere by a tube, the idea being to\r\nregulate the internal pressure of the balloon by introducing air into,\r\nor withdrawing it from, the smaller bag. But during an ascension with\r\ntheir patron, the Duke de Chartres, they entered a violent eddy which\r\ntore away the oars and rudder, at the same time agitating the balloon\r\nso violently that the internal air bag broke its sustaining cords and\r\nfell upon the bottom of the gas bag, thus throttling the connection\r\nwith the external atmosphere. The vessel rose swiftly and the gas\r\nexpanded dangerously near to the bursting pressure. At a height of\r\n16,000 feet the Duke de Chartres, perceiving the imminent danger of\r\nan explosion of the envelope, drew his sword and cut a rent ten feet\r\nlong in its lower part. A part of the gas immediately rushed forth,\r\nand the balloon sank rapidly, but after the discharge of the ballast,\r\nlanded safely without further mishap. The Duke acted wisely enough,\r\nbut he was afterwards ridiculed for his apparent lack of courage. If\r\nhe had possessed more bravery and less caution he might have allowed\r\nthe balloon to burst and descend as a parachute, thus anticipating the\r\nspectacular performance of John Wise, in 1838.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously other inventors were evolving designs of no less\r\nimportance in the ultimate perfection of the dirigible. In a letter\r\nwritten to Benjamin Franklin on May 24, 1784, Francis Hopkinson of\r\nPhiladelphia proposed to build a balloon of spindle shape and to drive\r\nit by means of a wheel-like propeller at the stern, consisting of vanes\r\nset at an angle to the line of progression, like the common smokejack.\r\nThis proposed craft, the harbinger of the modern screw-driven motor\r\nballoon, far antedated the screw-driven boat and the submarine torpedo\r\nwhich it most resembles.[9]\r\n\r\nWhile Blanchard and other aëronauts were paddling their globose bags\r\nin search of favorable winds, vainly hoping thereby to direct their\r\ncourse in the air, General Meusnier of the French army, and member of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, made a systematic study of the requirements\r\nfor practical air navigation. After some research on forms suitable\r\nfor aëronautic hulls, he designed a power balloon having a pointed\r\ncar suspended from a bag of goose-egg form, this latter embodying his\r\nidea of the best shape for a balloon that must cleave the air swiftly\r\nand resist deformation. The propulsion was to be effected by means of\r\nthree coaxial screw propellers, supported on the rigging between car\r\nand bag, and actuated by eighty men, for lack of a light artificial\r\nmotor. He thus hoped to obtain a moderate velocity which, combined with\r\nskillfully selected air currents, would enable the ship to reach her\r\ndestination in ordinary weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—GEN. MEUSNIER’S PROPOSED DIRIGIBLE, 1784.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Meusnier introduced important special features in the design of\r\ndirigibles for preserving their form and poise. He insisted that the\r\nbag and boat should be so rigidly connected that one could not swerve\r\nfrom alignment and relative position with the other. He also emphasized\r\nthe necessity of preserving the vessel from deformation during flight,\r\nin order to diminish its resistance. To that end he proposed to provide\r\nthe hull with a double envelope, the inner one thin and light but\r\nimpermeable to hydrogen; the outer one strong and air-tight; the space\r\nbetween the two envelopes to be pumped full of air under pressure\r\nsufficient to preserve the form of the bag when beating its way swiftly\r\nagainst a buffeting wind. This was an important invention which in\r\nlater years was adopted in many of the most powerful motor balloons—for\r\nall, indeed, except those of the rigid type. He also proposed the\r\nuse of stabilizing planes to control the poise of the vessel, thus\r\nanticipating the Lebaudy brothers by more than a century. Like the\r\nRobert brothers he proposed to raise or lower the vessel in search of\r\nsuitable currents, by altering the quantity of air in the space between\r\nthe inner and outer envelope, by use of hand bellows.\r\n\r\nApparently General Meusnier and his colleagues were endowed with\r\nconstructive genius sufficient to have developed a practical motor\r\nballoon, had they been able to secure a light engine. Lacking this the\r\nearly aëronauts could do little more than describe their projects, and\r\nawait the growth of the collateral arts and sciences. Accordingly no\r\nsubstantial advance in motor balloons beyond Meusnier’s designs was\r\neffected till after the middle of the nineteenth century; and until\r\nthen the art of aëronautics remained in the hands of showmen. Hundreds\r\nof projects, indeed, were advanced, some exciting considerable interest\r\nand expectation, but nevertheless of such paltry value as hardly to\r\ndeserve comment. One notable exception to these was the invention of\r\nPorter in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Rufus Porter, a Yankee inventor, and later the original\r\nfounder of the _Scientific American_, patented an air ship of very\r\npromising appearance for that early day. Its hull was a long, finely\r\ntapering symmetrical spindle, suspending a car of similar shape by\r\nmeans of cords, which were vertical at its middle but more and more\r\nslanting toward its ends. Midway between the hull and car was a large\r\nscrew propeller actuated by a steam engine in the car. A model of\r\nthis dirigible exhibited in Boston and New York, some years later, is\r\nreported to have carried its own power, at fair speed, and to have\r\nobeyed its helm satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—RUFUS PORTER’S DIRIGIBLE, 1820.]\r\n\r\nThe inventor, being too poor to develop his air ship alone, did\r\nlittle with the patent during its life; but in 1850 he organized\r\na stock company to realize the needed funds. From the sale of 300\r\nfive-dollar shares he expected to raise $1,500, and with this sum\r\nbuild an “aëroport,” 150 feet long, capable of carrying five persons\r\nsixty miles an hour, the whole to be completed in six weeks. Once\r\nthis was in operation he would easily command funds sufficient to\r\nbuild a full-sized vessel adapted to regular passenger service. For,\r\nafter careful calculation, he reported that: “It appears certain that\r\na safe and durable aërial ship (or aëroport) capable of carrying 150\r\npassengers at a speed of ninety miles an hour, with more perfect safety\r\nthan either steamboat or railroad cars, may be constructed for $15,000,\r\nand that the expense of running it would not exceed $25 per day.”\r\n\r\nThe language and project seem very modern, even at the present\r\ntime, and might well be copied now by a promoter of that identical\r\nproject. But it must be observed that the most successful European\r\nexperimenters, after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on giant\r\nair ships, have not yet attained one half the speed contemplated by\r\nthat ambitious and chimerical Yankee. The picture was handsome and\r\nalluring, none the less. It may even be said to excel in outward design\r\nany of the air-ship plans produced in either hemisphere before the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 a clockmaker and skillful workman, Jullien by name, exhibited\r\nin the Hippodrome, at Paris, a torpedo-shaped model balloon of\r\ngold-beater’s skin, provided with a screw propeller at either side\r\nof its bow, and a double rudder at its stern. It measured 23 feet in\r\nlength and weighed 1,100 grammes complete. The propellers were actuated\r\nby spring power, and proved able to drive the tiny vessel against a\r\nmoderate wind. The most suitable form for the bag was determined by\r\ntowing models through water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—JULLIEN’S MODEL DIRIGIBLE, 1850.]\r\n\r\nAërodynamically considered, this tiny motor balloon was by far the best\r\nin design of any that appeared during the first century of aëronautics.\r\nIt may be regarded as the harbinger of the swiftest modern French\r\nballoons. It was also an inspiration to Henri Giffard who assisted\r\nJullien in constructing his clever model, and shortly afterwards built\r\nthe first dirigible ever driven by a heat engine.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Henri Giffard was perhaps the first aëronautical\r\nengineer adequately endowed and circumstanced to realize, on a\r\npractical scale, General Meusnier’s well pondered and truly scientific\r\nplans for a motor balloon. He had studied in the college of Bourbon,\r\nand had worked in the railroad shops of the Paris and St. Germain\r\nrailway. He had further equipped himself by making free balloon\r\nascensions, under the auspices of Eugene Godard, for the purpose of\r\nstudying the atmosphere; and by building light engines, one of which\r\nweighed 100 pounds, and developed three horse power. Finally in 1851 he\r\npatented an air ship, consisting of an elongated bag and car, propelled\r\nby a screw driven by a steam engine. He had not the means to build such\r\na vessel, but he had the genius and training necessary to construct it,\r\nand at the same time enough enthusiasm and persuasive power to induce\r\nhis friends, David and Sciama, to loan him the requisite funds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—GIFFARD’S STEAM DIRIGIBLE, 1852.]\r\n\r\nGiffard’s first dirigible was successful in both design and operation.\r\nIt consisted of a spindle-shaped bag covered with a net whose cords\r\nwere drawn down and attached to a horizontal pole, from which the car\r\nand motor were suspended, and at the end of which was a triangular\r\nsail serving as a rudder. To guard against fire, the furnace of the\r\nvertical coke-burning boiler was shielded by wire gauze, like a miner’s\r\nlamp, and the draft, taken from its top through a downward pointing\r\nsmoke pipe, was ejected below the car by force of exhaust steam, from\r\nthe engine, thus obviating, as Giffard asserted, all danger from the\r\nuse of fire near an inflammable gas. The car hung twenty feet below\r\nthe suspension pole, and carried a three horse-power engine driving a\r\nthree-blade propeller 11 feet in diameter, making 110 turns a minute.\r\nThe motor complete, including the engine and boiler without supplies,\r\nweighed 110 pounds per horse power. The bag measured 143 feet long, 39\r\nfeet in diameter, and 75,000 cubic feet in volume. Giffard reports of\r\nhis first voyage, made from the Hippodrome in Paris at five fifteen\r\no’clock, September 23, 1852, that although he could not sail directly\r\nagainst the strong wind then blowing, he could attain a speed of six\r\nto ten feet per second relatively to the air, and he could easily\r\nguide the vessel by turning her rudder. He continued his journey till\r\nnightfall, then made a good landing, near Trappes, and by ten o’clock\r\nwas back in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis vessel was but a prelude to mightier projects. After some further\r\nexperience with dirigibles of moderate size, Giffard designed a\r\ncolossal air ship calculated for a speed of forty-four miles an hour.\r\nIts hull was to be of torpedo shape, measuring 2,000 feet in length,\r\n100 feet in diameter, and 7,000,000 cubic feet in volume. It was a\r\nmost audacious project, one worthy of the genius and energy of that\r\nillustrious engineer, the most original and daring inventor known in\r\nthe aëronautical world during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nStimulated by this huge enterprise, Giffard’s first step was to pay his\r\ndebts and make a fortune. He soon acquired a hundred thousand francs\r\nfrom the sale of small high-speed engines of his own construction, and\r\nwith this, settled his account with David and Sciama. Next he realized\r\nseveral million francs from his world-famous injector, a device by\r\nwhich steam flowing from a boiler is made to drive in feed-water\r\nagainst the same pressure.\r\n\r\nHe now made definite plans to build a motor balloon of one and a half\r\nmillion cubic feet capacity, driven by a condensing engine drawing\r\nsteam from two boilers, one fired with oil, the other with gas from\r\nthe balloon, so as to keep the vessel from rising with loss of weight.\r\nHis designs were complete, and everything was provided for. He had\r\ndeposited a million francs in the Bank of Paris to defray the estimated\r\ncost. But, in the words of Tissandier,[10] “above the human will and\r\nforesight are the fatal laws of destiny to which the strongest must\r\nsubmit.” The great inventor was visited with a painful affliction\r\nof the eyes; his sight waned, unfitting him for work; he became\r\ndisconsolate, pined away with pain and grief, and in 1882 ended his\r\nlife by taking chloroform.\r\n\r\nGiffard was succeeded in France, first by Dupuy de Lome; then by\r\nGaston Tissandier, well-meaning projectors of steerable balloons, but\r\ntoo cautious to effect an important advance in the art. The first of\r\nthese gentlemen, an eminent marine engineer, in 1872, completed a gas\r\nballoon for the French government, resembling the one designed by\r\nGeneral Meusnier in 1784, and like that also driven by muscular power\r\nactuating a screw, and kept rigidly inflated by use of an internal\r\nballoon, or ballonet. The car was suspended from the bag by a close\r\nfitting cover instead of a net, in order to lessen the resistance, and\r\nit was kept in alignment by use of crossed suspension cords. A speed\r\nof but six miles an hour was attained by the industrious work of eight\r\nmen operating an ample screw propeller. A decade later Tissandier, with\r\na balloon of like design, but driven by the power of an electric motor\r\nand bichromate of potash battery, attained a speed of six to eight\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—DUPUY DE LOME’S DIRIGIBLE, 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe two vessels were safe but of no practical value, for lack of\r\nsufficient power to cope with the wind. Their motors were fundamentally\r\nunadapted to the purpose of swift propulsion, and incapable of\r\ndevelopment to very great lightness and strength. Furthermore, the\r\nvessels themselves were unsuitably designed for speed; their shape\r\nbeing one of too much resistance, and their dynamic balance being\r\nthat of a pendulum, or clumsy parachute, rather than that of a vessel\r\nadapted to cleave the air with celerity, grace and steadiness. If there\r\nhad been danger of fire from placing the motor and screw near the gas\r\nbag, that might justify or excuse the clumsiness of design in the craft\r\nof De Lome and of Gaston Tissandier; but, having perfectly safe motors,\r\nit is astonishing that they did not place the center of mass and the\r\nline of thrust more nearly in the line of resistance. This obvious\r\nrequirement was duly recognized by several of their contemporaries,\r\nnotably by Hänlein in Germany, and by Captain Renard of the French War\r\nDepartment, and had been observed by Jullien.\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles Renard proved to be a worthy inheritor of the dreams,\r\nexperience and inventions of the first century of aëronautical\r\nvotaries. He did not, indeed, have the picturesque madness displayed\r\nby some of his predecessors; he did not project schemes of marvelous\r\noriginality or boldness; but he manifested uncommonly good judgment\r\nand excellent scientific method in combining the researches and\r\ncontrivances of others with those of himself and his collaborator,\r\nCaptain Krebs. As a consequence they produced the first man-carrying\r\ndirigible that ever returned against the wind to its starting point,\r\nand the first aërial vessel whose shape and dynamic adjustment even\r\napproximated the requirements of steady and swift navigation in a\r\nsurrounding medium presenting various conditions of turbulence or calm.\r\nCaptain Renard had been studying and designing dirigibles since 1878\r\nin coöperation with Captain La Haye and Colonel Laussedat, president\r\nof an aëronautic commission appointed by the Minister of War; and had\r\nendeavored to secure from the latter an appropriation sufficient to\r\nconstruct a dirigible; but his request was at first denied, owing\r\nto the waste of funds on similar projects in 1870. However, with the\r\nhelp of Gambetta, who promised a sum of $40,000, Renard was enabled to\r\nproceed. In the meantime he had been made director of the laboratory at\r\nChalais Meudon, seconded by Captain Krebs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—RENARD’S DIRIGIBLE, _La France_, 1884.]\r\n\r\nThese officers first worked out the separate elements in the design of\r\ntheir motor balloon before proceeding to build on a practical scale.\r\nThey chose the torpedo form for their gas bag, thereby ensuring in\r\nthe hull itself, projectile stability, and diminution of resistance.\r\nThey placed the car near the envelope, thus minimizing the disturbing\r\nmoment of the screw thrust, and the resistance of the suspension cords.\r\nThey employed an extraordinarily powerful electric motor actuating a\r\nlarge screw so as to obtain a strong thrust with the least effort.\r\nIn addition they adopted the best ideas of their predecessors in\r\naëronautical design; the internal ballonet of Meusnier, and the\r\nclose fitting cover of De Lome, with crossed suspension cords. But\r\nunfortunately they used an electric motor instead of some light engine.\r\nFinally, having carefully computed its requisite dimensions, they\r\nproceeded to construct the elegant air ship, _La France_, which was\r\ntested in 1884 and aroused anew the hope of ultimately conquering the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nFurther details of this successful ship are of interest. Its hull\r\nwas 165 feet long, 27.5 feet in greatest diameter, at one fourth the\r\ndistance from its front end, and cubed 66,000 feet, thus having a\r\nbuoyancy of two long tons. It was kept rigid under varying conditions,\r\nby means of a ballonet filled with air driven in by a common fan blower\r\ncoupled to the motor. Beneath the envelope, a long narrow rectangular\r\ncar made of bamboo, covered with silk, was suspended from the cords\r\nof the balloon cover which embraced the hull throughout nearly its\r\nentire length. The car was 108 feet long and 6 to 7 feet across,\r\ncarried at its forward end the propeller, at its rear a rectangular\r\nrudder, and between them the aëronauts and the batteries and electric\r\nmotor. A sliding weight was used to alter the poise of the ship, and a\r\nguide-rope to soften its descent.\r\n\r\nThe electric motor and battery which furnished the propulsive power\r\nwere designed expressly for such use, and were considered at the time\r\nto be remarkably light and effective. The motor, which was designed\r\nwith the assistance of M. Gramme, weighed 220.5 pounds, and developed\r\nnine horse power. The battery, composed of chlorochromic cells, was the\r\nresult of the researches of Renard himself. Having made a careful study\r\nof the best geometrical arrangement of the parts of the cell, Renard\r\nfound that this battery would deliver to the shaft one horse power for\r\neach eighty-eight pounds of its weight. Thus the power plant rivaled\r\nin lightness the steam engine of Giffard, and at the same time was free\r\nfrom danger; but apparently it could not be much reduced in weight,\r\nwhereas Giffard’s steam-power plant could be reduced tenfold, as shown\r\nby Renard’s contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe trials of _La France_ in 1884-85 were most successful and\r\nencouraging; not that they represented or pointed to the complete\r\nmastery of aërial navigation, but because they so far surpassed all\r\nprevious achievements. The vessel moved through the air as steadily as\r\na boat on the water, and obeyed her rudder perfectly, heading against\r\nthe wind, or at any angle to it, or turning entirely about, at the will\r\nof the aëronauts. On her first voyage from Chalais, August 9, 1884, she\r\ntraversed a distance of four and one half miles in twenty minutes, made\r\nvarious evolutions in the air with the greatest ease, and returned to\r\nher point of departure. The following account of this voyage is given\r\nby Renard:\r\n\r\n  “As soon as we had reached the top of the wooded plateaus which\r\n  surround the valley of Chalais, we started the screw, and had\r\n  the satisfaction of seeing the balloon immediately obey it and\r\n  readily follow every turn of the rudder. We felt that we were\r\n  absolutely masters of our own movements, and that we could\r\n  traverse the atmosphere in any direction as easily as a steam\r\n  launch could make its evolutions on a calm lake. After having\r\n  accomplished our purpose, we turned our head toward the point\r\n  of departure and we soon saw it approaching it. The walls of\r\n  the park of Chalais were passed anew, and our landing appeared\r\n  at our feet, about 1,000 feet below the car. The screw was\r\n  then slowed down, and a pull at the safety-valve started the\r\n  descent, during which, by means of the propeller and rudder,\r\n  the balloon was maintained directly over the point where our\r\n  assistants awaited us. Everything occurred according to our\r\n  plan, and the car was soon resting quietly on the lawn.”\r\n\r\nSix other similar voyages were made within the two years following,\r\nand we have as a result, that in five out of the seven trials, the\r\nballoon returned to its point of departure. Its failure to return in\r\nthe other two trials was due, in the one case, to the breaking down of\r\nthe motor; in the other, to the resistance of a strong wind which made\r\nit necessary to land at a distance from the starting point. The last of\r\nthese remarkable voyages was performed in presence of the Minister of\r\nWar, on September 23, 1885. The balloon started from Calais and sailed\r\nagainst the wind directly to Paris, passed over the fortifications,\r\ndescribed a graceful curve and returned to its place of departure,\r\nrecording an average speed of 14.5 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo form of hull, chosen by Renard and Krebs, has two important\r\nadvantages; one is projectile stability, the other is economy of\r\npropulsive power. Owing to the blunt bow and long tapering stern, the\r\ncenter of mass is well forward, while the center of side wind pressure\r\nis more to the rear. As a consequence, if the vessel should encounter a\r\nquartering wind-gust, or have her nose slightly turned from the course,\r\nshe would promptly right herself like a dart or an arrow. If on the\r\ncontrary, the hull were a symmetrical spindle, the vessel would move\r\nforward in unstable equilibrium, and, once slightly diverted from her\r\ncourse, would tend to deviate further, like an arrow with unloaded head.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage mentioned is also worth attention, viz.: that at\r\nordinary transportation speeds a longish spindle has less resistance\r\nwith a blunt bow than with a very sharp one. Renard and Krebs did\r\nnot account for this fact; but the present writer, by determining\r\nseparately the skin friction and the impactual resistance of the air,\r\nproved that in sharpening the bow beyond a certain best form, its\r\nfriction increases faster than its head resistance diminishes, the\r\nmost suitable shape being that of a torpedo whose nose has a radius\r\nof curvature of about two diameters, and its stern a radius of about\r\ntwelve diameters.\r\n\r\nWhile the successors of Giffard in France were thus engaged in\r\ndeveloping dirigibles driven by muscular or electric power, a few\r\nGerman experimenters were applying gas and benzine engines to such\r\nvessels, with better promise of ultimate practical success and\r\nusefulness. The first of these was Hänlein, who in 1872 advanced the\r\nmeritorious project of driving a well shaped balloon by means of a gas\r\nengine taking its fuel from inside the balloon, and making good the\r\nloss by pumping air into the ballonet. This balloon was of far better\r\ndesign for swiftness and kinetic stability than the contemporary one of\r\nDupuy de Lome. Its hull was a well pointed cylinder 164 feet long, 30\r\nfeet in diameter and of 85,000 cubic feet capacity, made air-tight by\r\na thick coating of rubber inside, and a thin one outside. The car was\r\nrigidly suspended near the envelope and carried a 6 horse-power Lenoir\r\ngas engine actuating a large screw. Notwithstanding that the buoyancy\r\nwas small, owing to the use of coal gas, this air ship attained a speed\r\nof 15 feet per second. By employing hydrogen, a much larger engine\r\ncould have been carried, entailing a much swifter speed. During its\r\ntrial the balloon was kept near the earth’s surface, held loosely by\r\nropes in the hands of soldiers. The air ship was remarkably successful\r\nfor that early date, and had the potency of greater achievement\r\nthan its contemporaries in France; but owing to lack of funds its\r\ncapabilities were not fully developed. If it had been inflated with\r\nhydrogen, and propelled by use of gas and petrol, so that the loss\r\nof weight would compensate for the loss of buoyancy, it might have\r\nanticipated the speed and endurance of the best air ships built toward\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century, or later.\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAENLEIN’S GAS-DRIVEN DIRIGIBLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WÖLFERT’S BENZINE-DRIVEN DIRIGIBLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS-DUMONT’S DIRIGIBLE, _NO. 16_.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._ ]\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Baumgarten and Wölfert in Germany built a dirigible equipped\r\nwith a Daimler benzine motor, but otherwise not possessing any special\r\nmerit. An ascension was made at Leipsic in 1880, but owing to improper\r\nload distribution the vessel reared on end and crashed to earth. After\r\nfurther experiments, an ascension was made on the Templehofer field,\r\nnear Berlin, in 1897, but this ended disastrously; for the benzine\r\nvapor ignited; the fire spread to the balloon, and the vessel fell\r\nflaming to the earth, killing Wölfert and his assistant. Baumgarten had\r\ndied some years before.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, an aluminum air ship invented by an Austrian engineer, named\r\nSchwartz, was launched on the Templehofer field. Its hull was of\r\ncylindrical form with conical ends, made of sheets 0.008 thick, and\r\nstiffened with an internal frame of aluminum tubes. Being leaky and\r\ninadequately driven, it voyaged but four miles, drifting with the wind,\r\nthen fell to earth with considerable shock. The pilot, a soldier of the\r\nBalloon Corps, escaped by jumping, before the vessel struck ground, but\r\nthe frail unbending hull was soon demolished by the buffeting of the\r\nwinds as it lay stranded on the unyielding earth. This was the second\r\nair ship built after the plans of poor Schwartz, the first having\r\ncollapsed on inflation. He had, however, the credit of being the first\r\nto drive a rigid air ship with a petrol motor, and thus to inaugurate\r\na system of aërial navigation capable of immense development, in\r\nthe hands of sufficient capital and constructive skill. Thus the\r\nrigid type, conceived and crudely tried by Marey Monge and Dupuis\r\nDelcourt in the early part of the century, began to approach practical\r\nrealization toward the end of the century.\r\n\r\nThe process of inflating with hydrogen such a rigid hull is\r\ninteresting. Schwartz’s plan, carried out by Captain Von Sigsfeld,\r\nwas to place the hydrogen in one or more sacs inside the hull, thus\r\nexpelling the air and filling the space, then withdrawing the sacs and\r\nleaving the hydrogen within. A better plan is to have a single sac\r\ninflated with air just filling the hull like the lining of an egg, then\r\nto force the gas between the lining and metal wall of the hull, thus\r\nexpelling the air from the sac, which when completely collapsed can be\r\nremoved. Practically the same result can be obtained by use of a thin\r\nfabric covering one half the inner wall, like the lining of an egg.\r\nFurther provision can easily be made for manipulating the ballonet in\r\nsuch a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n              INTRODUCTION OF GASOLINE-DRIVEN DIRIGIBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the art of balloon guidance and propulsion from its\r\nearliest inception to the close of the nineteenth century. It was a\r\nperiod of extravagant hope and chimerical scheming, but withal a period\r\nfruitful in devices of fundamental value. The best experiments paid no\r\ndividends, but they prepared the way for really useful vessels. The\r\nmethods of manipulation and control had been sufficiently developed\r\nto answer immediate needs. The air ship was at least dirigible, if\r\nnot practical. It kept its shape, obeyed its rudder, rose and fell\r\naccording to the operator’s will. It was, however, a fair-weather\r\nmachine, beautiful in appearance, but helpless in any considerable\r\nwind. Speed was now the desideratum, and the attainment of this\r\ninvolved new difficulties. The storm-proof balloon was still a dream.\r\n\r\nNaturally one inquires what velocity makes a dirigible air ship really\r\npractical, assuming all other requirements satisfied. The minimum\r\nallowable speed depends largely upon the locality and season. On Long\r\nIsland an assured velocity of forty to fifty miles an hour would\r\nseem desirable; for there the winds are swift and the water near. In\r\nWashington, or Berlin, thirty miles an hour is enough, though each\r\nadditional mile per hour must be regarded as a considerable gain on\r\na small margin of progress in facing a stiff breeze. Colonel Renard\r\nhas estimated, from a study of the wind records near Paris, that a\r\ndirigible is practically useful in that locality if it can maintain a\r\nspeed of twenty-eight miles an hour for ten or twelve hours; since in\r\nthat case it can maneuver 81 days in 100.\r\n\r\nRenard’s own graceful ship attained a speed of but half that much. In\r\norder, therefore, to give his vessel the desired usefulness its speed\r\nmust be doubled. This would require an eightfold[11] increase of motive\r\npower without increase of weight. Evidently then the cardinal requisite\r\nwas a light durable motor of extraordinary output. Such motors\r\nfortunately were now coming into the market, owing to the development\r\nof gasoline engines for automobile racing.\r\n\r\nThe year 1898 witnessed the commencement of two famous systems of\r\nnavigation by the lighter than air, one in France, the other in\r\nGermany, destined quickly to revolutionize the art, and to establish\r\nit on a practical basis. The leading exponents of these two systems\r\nwere Señor Don Alberto Santos-Dumont, a rich young Brazilian living in\r\nParis, and Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Germany’s stanch old admiral\r\nof the air. Both achieved success by applying the gasoline engine to\r\nthe propulsion of elongated balloons, but by very different methods.\r\nSantos-Dumont, apparently ignoring, or fearing to adopt, the excellent\r\nhull and car designed and used by Renard, began where Tissandier left\r\noff, with a symmetrical hull and low-hung car, thus producing a safe\r\naërial pendulum, if not a racing machine; then by degrees he gradually\r\nfelt his way to something more efficient. Zeppelin began with a long\r\ncylindrical hull pointed at the ends, rigidly framed like that of\r\nSchwartz, and supporting its car and propellers well aloft near the\r\nline of resistance. His was a bold and effective design but difficult\r\nto execute. Santos-Dumont scored the first success, and startled the\r\nworld by his spectacular flights; but ere long he was surpassed by\r\nother builders of non-rigid balloons. Zeppelin won his success slowly\r\nand by heroic perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles, finally\r\nemerging as the most successful and illustrious figure in the history\r\nof aëronautics. The achievements of these two pioneers and colleagues\r\nmake the first decade of the twentieth century memorable in the annals\r\nof aërial navigation.\r\n\r\nSantos-Dumont, who spent his early years on his father’s large coffee\r\nplantation in Brazil, had, during boyhood, dreamed of navigating the\r\nair, and in 1897, at the age of twenty-four, made in France his first\r\nascension in a spherical balloon. While living at Paris during that\r\nyear he gave much time to motorcycling, automobiling and operating\r\nspherical balloons, of which he possessed two constructed after his own\r\nideas; one, the smallest in the world, designed for solitary voyages,\r\nthe other large enough for more than one person, intended for social\r\nexcursions. Thus by way of amusement, and probably by impulse rather\r\nthan deliberate purpose, he was equipping himself to become both the\r\ndesigner and the pilot of his future dirigibles.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired experience and skill in operating both balloons and\r\nengines, the young enthusiast set about realizing his boyhood dream\r\nof navigating the air independently of the course of the wind. His\r\nfirst dirigible was designed to carry his weight of 110 pounds and a\r\n3½ horse-power petroleum engine taken from his tricycle, and reduced\r\nin weight to 66 pounds. The hull was a cylinder of varnished Japanese\r\nsilk, 82½ feet long including its pointed ends, 11½ feet in diameter\r\nand 6,354 cubic feet in gas capacity. A ballonet, or air pocket,\r\noccupied the lower middle of the envelope. The basket for the little\r\npilot, engine, and two-blade propeller was suspended far below the\r\nhull, to which its cords were attached by means of small wooden rods\r\ninserted into hems along each side of the envelope, for a great part of\r\nits length. The poise of the vessel was controlled by shifting weights\r\nfore and aft, while the turning right and left was effected by means\r\nof a silk rudder stretched over a steel frame. On the whole it was a\r\ncrude and primitive affair, but of considerable interest as the first\r\ndirigible of a young man destined to give a strong impulse to the\r\ndevelopment of motor balloons of the non-rigid type.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary tests, the little air ship and pilot soared away\r\nfrom the Zoölogical Garden in Paris, on September 20, 1898, rising in\r\nthe face of a gentle wind, to the wonder and delight of a large crowd\r\nof witnesses, some of them professional aëronauts and very skeptical\r\nas to the outcome of this venturesome experiment. The ship maneuvered\r\nround and round overhead of the applauding throng, steering readily in\r\nall directions. Then the green navigator ascended a quarter of a mile\r\nand merrily continued his evolutions in the direction of the Longchamps\r\nrace course. But when he wished to descend he observed the envelope\r\ncontracting in volume, and was appalled to find that he could not\r\npump air into the ballonet fast enough to keep the hull distended. It\r\nbecame swaybacked, and “all at once began to fold in the middle like a\r\npocket-knife; the tension cords became unequal and the balloon envelope\r\nwas on the point of being torn by them.” As he was falling swiftly\r\ntoward the grassy turf at Bagatelle, he called to some boys who were\r\nflying kites, to grasp his guide-rope and run against the wind. They\r\nunderstood and ran so swiftly with the canted balloon that it played\r\nkite, and descended with a moderated fall, landing the frightened\r\naëronaut safely on the turf.\r\n\r\nExcept for the doubling of his long balloon, Santos-Dumont’s first\r\nvoyage was satisfactory, and he returned to Paris elated. He had found\r\nit easy to steer in all directions. He could change his level hundreds\r\nof feet without discharge of gas or ballast, by merely canting his\r\nballoon, and allowing it to run obliquely up or down grade. He had\r\nstemmed the wind and gone whither he pleased, at such speed as to make\r\nhis clothes flutter. And best of all he had found no danger in using a\r\ngasoline motor near an inflammable gas bag. The mere buckling of the\r\nlong bag was a trifle, to be remedied by using an air pump adequate to\r\nmaintain the flabby thing well inflated. He felt, therefore, that he\r\nhad the conquest of the air well in hand, and that he was drifting into\r\nair ship construction as a life work. Small wonder that he continued\r\nhis conquests till he had built, in less than one decade, fourteen\r\nmotor balloons.\r\n\r\n_Santos-Dumont No. 2_ was closely patterned after its predecessor,\r\nbut was a little larger and carried a rotary fan worked by the motor,\r\nto keep the balloon plump by filling the air pocket, or ballonet. On\r\nMay 11, 1899, an ascension was made from the old starting place, but\r\nin rainy weather. As the vessel rose its hull contracted faster than\r\nair could be pumped into the ballonet, the long bag doubled worse than\r\nbefore, and dropped into the trees with its chagrined but fearless\r\nrider.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 3_, which followed, was a short, thick vessel, 66 feet long\r\nby 25 feet in diameter, having in outward appearance the features of\r\nDupuy de Lome’s very stable and very slow dirigible. It was apparently\r\na safety ship for a scared young man who had not yet learned fully to\r\nappreciate Renard’s elegant design. It served for a few pleasant trips,\r\nwhile the inventor was screwing up courage to build another cylindrical\r\nvessel, and gradually realizing the advantage of an elongated car such\r\nas Renard had employed in _La France_. Not only was the hull short\r\nand thick, but it was further secured from buckling by a horizontal\r\nstiffening pole placed between it and the basket, and from which the\r\nlatter was hung. After some voyages in _No. 3_, which the captain found\r\nvery tractable, and probably capable of fifteen miles per hour, he was\r\nready to begin a new vessel.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 4_ was a compromise between the better features of _No. 3_\r\nand its predecessors. The elongated hull and ballonet were resumed,\r\nand the stiffening pole was elaborated into a longish car resembling\r\nRenard’s, but of triangular cross section. On this long trussed frame\r\nwere placed the motor, propeller, rudder and the rider in his basket.\r\nA seven horse-power engine turning, at one hundred revolutions per\r\nminute, a screw propeller having two blades, each 13 feet across, gave\r\na thrust of 66 pounds. Frequent trials of the ship during the summer\r\nof 1900, in presence of the Exposition crowds, brought the inventor\r\ninto extraordinary prominence, and secured for him the “Encouragement\r\nPrize” of the Paris Aëro Club, consisting of the yearly interest on\r\none hundred thousand francs, this being one of M. Deutsch’s numerous\r\nfoundations for the promotion of aëronautics.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1900, M. Deutsch de la Meurthe had established another\r\nprize which Santos-Dumont now greatly coveted, and hoped ere long to\r\nwin. This was a cash sum of one hundred thousand francs to be awarded\r\nby the Scientific Commission of the Aëro Club of France to the first\r\ndirigible that, between May 1 and October 1, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903,\r\n1904, should voyage from Saint Cloud to and around the Eiffel tower,\r\nand return within half an hour. The distance to the tower and back,\r\nnot counting the turn, was nearly seven miles, and the estimated speed\r\nrequired to fulfill the conditions for winning the prize, even in calm\r\nweather, was 15½ miles per hour.\r\n\r\nAs Santos-Dumont thought his _No. 4_ scarcely swift enough to win\r\nthe Deutsch prize, he enlarged it by inserting an additional length\r\nof sixteen feet at its middle, supplied it with a stronger car, and\r\napplied a larger engine, naming the new vessel so formed, his _No.\r\n5_. Its hull was 109 feet long, 17 feet in largest diameter and cubed\r\nnearly 20,000 feet. A four cylinder air-cooled petroleum motor driving\r\na screw propeller having two blades, each 13 feet across, gave a thrust\r\nof 120 pounds, at 140 revolutions per minute, and produced such draft\r\nas to give the inventor pneumonia. Among other novelties water ballast\r\nwas used, and piano wires replaced the old-time suspension cords.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 5_ proved so powerful and swift that on July 13, 1901,\r\nSantos-Dumont attempted to win the Deutsch prize. Starting from the\r\nAëro Club grounds at Saint-Cloud in presence of official witnesses,\r\nat half past six in the morning, when the air is usually stillest,\r\nhe turned the Eiffel Tower in the tenth minute, thus gaining twenty\r\nminutes for the home stretch. But on his return he encountered an\r\nunexpected head wind, and after a terrific struggle reached the\r\ntimekeepers at Saint-Cloud in the fortieth minute.\r\n\r\nTo add to the romance of this voyage, the genii of the upper elements\r\nstopped his motor, shortly after his return, and the bold sailor in his\r\nshining ship landed in a stately chestnut tree very near the house\r\nof the Princess Isabel, daughter of Dom Pedro. She very thoughtfully\r\narranged a breakfast for him and sent it up in a basket, where he was\r\nat work disengaging the balloon, at the same time inviting him to call\r\nand relate to her the story of his voyage. A few days later she sent\r\nhim a medal of St. Benedict “that protects against accidents.” He wore\r\nthe medal, and on his very next trial escaped without a scratch from an\r\nappalling accident which might have terminated fatally. He continued to\r\nwear the gift of that gracious princess, on a thin gold chain circling\r\nhis wrist, and many a time thereafter endured unscathed the most\r\ndreadful accidents, as if he possessed a charmed life.\r\n\r\nOn August 8, 1901, the dauntless aëronaut again sailed for the coveted\r\nprize, at the same still morning hour, sacred to duels and aërial\r\ncontests. In nine minutes he turned the tower and headed bravely for\r\nhome. But soon a leaky valve let the balloon shrink and the wires\r\nsag into the whirring propeller, which therefore had to be stopped.\r\nSantos-Dumont now had the choice of drifting back against the tower\r\nand destroying his vessel high in air, or of descending at once, by\r\nallowing the balloon to sink without discharge of ballast. He chose\r\nthe latter course, hoping to land on the Seine embankment; but instead\r\nhis balloon struck the top of the Trocadero hotel, exploded and fell\r\nin fluttering shreds into the courtyard. Some firemen who had been\r\nwatching the flight from a distance, came with a rope and found\r\nthe long car leaning like a ladder against the wall of the court,\r\nthe balloon shreds hanging from it in graceful folds, and Captain\r\nSantos-Dumont perched aloft in his wicker basket wearily waiting for\r\nSt. Benedict’s further aid. As usual, he was rescued intact.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of his fall on the roof of the hotel Santos-Dumont\r\nissued specifications for his famous _No. 6_, which surpassed\r\nall its predecessors in safety and speed. It had the shape of an\r\nelongated ellipsoid with pointed ends, measured 110 feet in length,\r\n20 feet in major diameter, 22,239 cubic feet in volume, and had an\r\nabsolute ascensional force of 1,518 pounds. It was driven by a twelve\r\nhorse-power four-cylinder water-cooled engine which gave the propeller\r\na thrust of 145 pounds. To insure against buckling of the gas bag, an\r\nair pump connected with the motor, kept the ballonet under constant\r\npressure, regulated by an escape valve through which the excess of\r\nair passed outward. To secure the envelope against rupture, due to\r\nthe expansion of the hydrogen at unusual elevations, a stronger valve\r\nwas used to let the gas escape from the envelope into the atmosphere.\r\nThus the air escape valve kept the pressure constant in the partially\r\ndistended ballonet, and consequently also in the surrounding gas\r\nenvelope itself; while the stronger gas valve in the envelope opened\r\nonly in an emergency, when the gas pressure had fully collapsed the\r\ninternal air pocket and was threatening to explode the envelope. With\r\nall its improvements this new vessel was finished and inflated by\r\nAugust 4, being a work of twenty-two days, and after some preliminary\r\ntrials was ready to try for the Deutsch prize.\r\n\r\nThe day of triumph followed quickly. On October 19, 1901, at 2.45\r\nP.M., Santos-Dumont again headed for the Eiffel Tower in presence of\r\nthe official witnesses. In spite of a wind of six meters per second\r\nstriking him sidewise, he held his course straight for the goal, and\r\nturned it in the ninth minute, as in his preceding attempt. On the\r\nreturn he had to struggle against a quartering wind and the caprice\r\nof his motor, which sometimes threatened to stop, and again spurted\r\nso actively as to turn the ship upward at a steep angle. The mighty\r\nthrong below, in the Auteuil race track and the Bois de Boulogne, sent\r\nup immense applause, then suddenly held its breath in alarm, as the\r\nvessel pitched violently. But the hardy little rider was self-possessed\r\nand at home on his vaulting Pegasus. Alert to every prank he held his\r\ncourse straight for the timekeepers and passed over their heads at\r\nexactly twenty-nine and one-half minutes after starting.\r\n\r\nHis unmercenary disposal of the two rich awards which he had won seemed\r\nno less commendable than the dauntless industry which achieved such\r\nrapid success. The Deutsch prize amounting in all to one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs he divided into two unequal parts. The\r\ngreater sum of seventy-five thousand francs he gave to the prefect\r\nof police of Paris, to be used for the deserving poor; the remainder\r\nhe distributed among his employés. The Encouragement Prize of four\r\nthousand francs a year, mentioned before, he also declined to retain,\r\nbut instead he founded with the money a new prize at the disposal of\r\nthe Aëro Club. As a second reward for his triumphal voyage around the\r\nEiffel Tower, he received from the Brazilian government one hundred\r\nand twenty-five thousand francs and a beautiful gold medal bearing\r\nappropriate and very complimentary inscriptions.\r\n\r\nNow that the stimulus and excitement of striving for the Deutsch prize\r\nwas over, the ardent inventor was free to develop and test his air\r\nships in a deliberate and scientific manner. He therefore set about\r\nbuilding specialized types of motor balloons, and practicing with them\r\nover all kinds of territory, smooth and rough. Within the next six\r\nyears he constructed eight more air ships making altogether fourteen,\r\nbesides his various free balloons, to say nothing of the aëroplanes and\r\nhydroplanes which he found time to develop. But before indulging in\r\nthese new luxuries he would have more experience with his _No. 6_.\r\n\r\nWhen the cold weather set in, following his victorious flight about\r\nthe Eiffel Tower, Santos-Dumont went with his _No. 6_ to Monaco, to\r\npractice air cruising over the Mediterranean. The Prince of Monaco\r\nhad erected for him an “aërodrome,” or balloon shed, facing the sea\r\nand very near shore. On pleasant days the daring pilot would cruise\r\nup and down the bay, not far from shore, trailing his guide-rope over\r\nthe waves with the greatest ease, and to the applause of thousands of\r\nspectators. But on February 14, 1902, he set forth on a pleasure cruise\r\nover the bay with insufficient gas pressure, and thus came to grief.\r\nThe bag grew flabby; the hydrogen poured to its higher end; the vessel\r\nreared up so steeply that the propeller had to be stopped to avoid\r\nits cutting the envelope. Rather than drift at the mercy of the wind,\r\nthe pilot opened the valve and sank slowly to the water where he was\r\nrescued by a boat. On the following day the parts of his _No. 6_ were\r\nfished out of the sea and sent back to Paris. His few days’ practice\r\nhad taught him the delights of guide-roping over the waters, and his\r\naccident induced him in future to sew unvarnished silk partitions\r\nacross his balloons, to prevent the hydrogen passing too suddenly from\r\none end to the other.\r\n\r\nReturning to Paris he built for himself an “aërodrome,” provided\r\nwith great sliding doors like the one at Monaco, and equipped with a\r\nhydrogen plant, constructive appliances, and everything needed for\r\nthe rapid rebuilding or repair of air ships. It stood in a vacant lot\r\nsurrounded by a high stone wall and was made of posts covered with red\r\nand white canvas, so that it looked like a great striped tent. Inside,\r\nthe central stalls were 31 feet wide, 165 feet long, and 44½ feet\r\nhigh,[12] the whole enclosure having accommodation for seven dirigibles\r\nall inflated and ready for instant service. When completed, in the\r\nspring of 1903, it was at once used to harbor three new air ships.\r\nThese were the _No. 7_, designed for racing contests; the _No. 9_,\r\ncalled the Runabout, a minim air ship used for calls and short pleasure\r\ntrips; and the _No. 10_, called the Omnibus, intended for several\r\npersons, with ample supplies for a considerable journey.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 7_, which excelled its predecessors in length and bulk, was\r\nintended greatly to outstrip the best of them in velocity. The first\r\nair ship had attained fourteen miles per hour, the _No. 6_, nearly\r\ntwenty miles an hour in winning the Deutsch prize, and over twenty\r\nmiles per hour on subsequent occasions, though provided with a motor\r\nrated at only 12 horse power. The new vessel which had little greater\r\nresistance than _No. 6_, was to carry four times the internal pressure,\r\nor about 12 centimeters of water, and to be propelled by an engine of\r\n60 horse power. The inventor expected therefore to attain a speed of\r\nbetween forty and fifty miles per hour. A very lofty expectation for\r\nthat day, and one still unrealized for many years.\r\n\r\nThe racing air ship, or _No. 7_, was of cigar form, supporting a long\r\ncar beneath, and generally resembling the _No. 6_, but slightly more\r\ntapering. Her length was six times her major diameter, and her volume\r\n45,000 cubic feet. The envelope was made of two layers of the strongest\r\nFrench silk, four times varnished, and was built exceptionally thick\r\nat the stern, where the differential outward pressure is greatest in\r\nflight. The propulsion was effected by a 60 horse-power water-cooled\r\nfour-cylinder Clément engine actuating two screw propellers 16½ feet\r\nin diameter, one in front the other at the rear of the car. The poise\r\nand maneuvering were to be controlled in the usual way, by means of the\r\nrudder and shifting weight. The inventor seemed not to realize that\r\nthe bow of his vessel was too sharp to cleave the air with minimum\r\nresistance, though his predecessor, Jullien, in 1850, had discovered\r\nexperimentally that a torpedo form is better for speed than the\r\nsymmetrical spindle form used by Santos-Dumont in his racing vessel. He\r\ndid, however, in time, learn that the torpedo form of hull is better\r\nfor stability of forward motion, and hence adopted that form in his\r\nlittle _Runabout_.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 9_ was a thick torpedo-shaped air ship originally cubing only\r\n7,770 feet, though later enlarged to 9,218 feet. It was so thick as\r\nto appear nearly egg-shaped. In order to make it respond promptly to\r\nthe rudder Santos-Dumont drove it through the air blunt end foremost,\r\nbut with apparent regrets, thinking that it would cleave the air\r\nmore easily than sharp end foremost. In this he was mistaken; for\r\nthe writer has shown that a body of such shape encounters much more\r\nresistance—roughly one hundred per cent more—when driven sharp end\r\nforemost than when driven blunt end forward. This fact furnishes one\r\nreason why most whales and swift fishes have blunt bows and long\r\ntapering sterns. However this be, the practical man felt his way to\r\nsuccess, whether right or wrong in his theory of resistance. When\r\nactuated by a three horse-power Clément motor, weighing 26½ pounds, the\r\nlittle air ship carried its jaunty pilot twelve to fifteen miles an\r\nhour on many a merry trip about Paris and its environs.\r\n\r\nThe _No. 10_, or _Omnibus_, was a well shaped vessel of nearly eighty\r\nthousand cubic feet capacity, and amply provided with steering\r\ndevices. Its hull tapered slightly from front to rear, terminating\r\nin projectile-shaped ends, and had a length of nearly six times its\r\nmajor diameter. Underneath was suspended a long car provided with\r\naëroplane surfaces, in addition to the usual rudder, for controlling\r\nits movements.\r\n\r\nIts arrow-like appearance was suggestive of some of the greatest German\r\nballoons of the decade. Indeed, the _Omnibus_, if well powered, might\r\nhave proved a very swift vessel, in addition to a powerful carrier.\r\nBut she was designed merely for easy going passenger service, for the\r\npurpose of popularizing aëronautics and stimulating its growth.\r\n\r\nSantos-Dumont now had three typical air ships, a spacious and well\r\nequipped “aërodrome,” and ample facilities for advancing the science\r\nof motor balloons on a moderate scale. He could not, however, maintain\r\nthe ascendency in this branch of science in France; for he encountered\r\nthe rivalry of great wealth employing highly trained engineering and\r\nconstructive talent. He could, however, still promote the art as a\r\npioneer and a popularizer. This he continued to do. With his little\r\n_Runabout_ he would one day guide-rope along the boulevard, another\r\nday take up a little boy, another day send up a beautiful young lady\r\nto navigate the air alone for a short distance, another day voyage\r\nover the military parade grounds and with his revolver fire a salute\r\nof twenty-one shots to the President of France, and give exhibitions\r\nto arouse the interest of the War Department. But he could not keep\r\npace with the new giants in aëronautics, and he did not attempt\r\nit. Nor did he ever build a vessel of sufficient power, speed and\r\ndurability to be purchased by the French nation. That honor went to his\r\nopulent contemporaries who had not failed to take cognizance of his\r\ncontributions to the aërial art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n             PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF NON-RIGID DIRIGIBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Lebaudy brothers, wealthy sugar refiners in Paris,\r\ncommissioned their able engineer, Julliot, to make investigations\r\nand develop plans for a large and swift air ship. This he did with\r\nthe assistance of Surcouf, a well-known manufacturer of balloons at\r\nBillancourt, Paris. Emulating the example of Santos-Dumont and certain\r\nGerman aëronauts in making their plan, they adopted the light petroleum\r\nengine for motive power, but experimented on a larger scale, thus\r\ncreating a new era in military aëronautics in France. Their first\r\nvessel was the _Jaune_ whose bag was built at Surcouf’s place, and\r\nits mechanical part at the Lebaudy Sugar Refinery. When launched,\r\nin 1902, it so pleased the owners that they determined to continue\r\nthe experiments on a larger scale. Their second air ship, called the\r\n_Lebaudy_, after fulfilling various tests, was accepted by the French\r\ngovernment and formed the beginning of its modern aërial fleet.\r\n\r\nMoisson, near Paris, where the balloons were kept, now became quite an\r\naëronautical center. Here, under military supervision and the skillful\r\nmanagement of the aëronaut Juchmes, other dirigibles were built in\r\nrapid succession. Of these the _Patrie_ was launched in 1906, and the\r\n_République_ in 1908, both fine swift vessels capable of voyaging many\r\nhours and carrying many passengers. The Lebaudy vessels were the first\r\nair ships of the “semi-rigid type,” in which the long and flexible\r\nenvelope, or hull, is provided with a rigid keel or floor, from which\r\nthe car is suspended with its machinery and passengers. They are,\r\ntherefore, of unusual interest both for their scientific design and for\r\nthe stimulus they imparted to the growth of aërial fleets. For this\r\nreason they may well be studied in some detail.\r\n\r\nThe first Lebaudy air ship, called the _Yellow_, because of its color,\r\nhad an envelope constructed of a rubber-treated cotton fabric, made in\r\nHanover and covered with a yellow coating of lead chromate, to ward off\r\nthe sun’s actinic rays from the rubber, and thus prevent deterioration.\r\nHer hull, which was cigar shaped and inflated with hydrogen, measured\r\n183 feet in length, 32 feet in diameter, and 80,000 cubic feet in\r\nvolume. She was propelled by a 40-horse-power Daimler motor actuating\r\ntwin screws, and attained a maximum speed of twenty-six miles an hour.\r\nDuring her first year’s service she made many ascensions, returning to\r\nher starting point twenty-eight times out of twenty-nine. Her longest\r\nvoyage, made at Moisson, June 24, 1904, was sixty-two miles in two\r\nhours and three quarters, with an average speed of twenty-two miles\r\nan hours. But in November, 1902, while landing in a high wind at the\r\nend of her voyage from Paris to Chalais-Meudon, she was wrecked by\r\ncolliding with a tree. Her motor, however, was uninjured, and a new\r\nenvelope was at once prepared.\r\n\r\nThe second vessel, called the _Lebaudy_, and brought out in 1904,\r\nthough resembling her predecessor, had a number of improvements in\r\ndetail. Her hull was somewhat larger than the _Jaune_, and no longer\r\npointed at the stern, but rounded off to an ellipsoidal shape, and\r\nprovided, like the rear of an arrow, with guiding, or steadying planes.\r\nIt measured 190 feet in length and 94,000 cubic feet in volume. It\r\nwas provided with two windows for internal inspection, and had an air\r\nbag of 17,650 cubic feet, divided into three parts. This air bag was\r\ninflated by a rotary fan near the main body, driven by the motor during\r\nflight, and by a storage battery when at rest. Suitable horizontal\r\nand vertical sails were used to steady and guide the vessel; also a\r\nguide-rope and anchor were carried. The car, suspended by steel ropes,\r\nten feet below the hull, carried the passengers and supplies; also\r\nthe motor actuating twin propellers, one on either side. At night an\r\nabundance of light was available, each passenger carrying a small lamp\r\nfastened to his clothes, the car itself bearing a powerful acetylene\r\nprojector in its front, and two other lamps of 100 candle power each,\r\nto illumine the vessel. It was an elaborate affair, costing fifty to\r\nsixty thousand dollars, and was the outcome of experiments costing ten\r\ntimes that sum.\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _LEBAUDY_.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LA PATRIE._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEBAUDY’S _MORNING POST_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lebaudy_, with these various improvements, gave much satisfaction\r\nto her owners, and received favorable recognition from the French War\r\nDepartment. During the thirty ascensions and voyages of her first\r\nyear’s service, she proved herself a swift vessel, easy to control,\r\nvery stable, and safe to land on solid ground. The Minister of War,\r\nwho had followed her developments with much interest, appointed a\r\ncommission to test her value for military service, with a view to her\r\nadoption by the government. The test required that the balloon remain\r\nin active service three months, always being anchored in the open, and\r\nthat it perform certain prescribed maneuvers and voyages. In one of\r\nthese it sailed with three persons on July 3, 1905, from Moisson to\r\nMeaux, an air-line distance of 57 miles in two hours and thirty-five\r\nminutes, at an average speed of 22 miles an hour, thence to Chalons,\r\n61 miles in three hours and twenty minutes. Here it was anchored to\r\nsome trees, but presently was caught in a strong wind, lifted high in\r\nthe air, then dashed violently against other trees, with the complete\r\ndestruction of its envelope. Within eleven weeks it was repaired\r\nin the military riding school at Toul, nearby; then, after some\r\nevolutions, returned to its harbor at Moisson. Other maneuvers were\r\nmade subsequently, in which five officers were carried at one time,\r\nand interesting experiments were tried, such as dropping a sand bag\r\nupon a given spot, photographing fortifications, etc. The Minister of\r\nWar, accompanied by two officers and other passengers, made a trip on\r\nOctober 24th, which was the seventy-sixth voyage of this stanch vessel.\r\nOn November 10th, the hard-worked and successful air ship went into\r\nwinter quarters, being now the property of the French government, and\r\nthe first of her modern aërial cruisers.\r\n\r\nThe _Patrie_ and the _République_, planned on the general lines\r\nof the _Lebaudy_, but in ascending scale of magnitude, were built\r\nexpressly for the French government, and experienced brilliant if\r\nill-fated careers. Both vessels had whale-shaped hulls, with rather\r\nsharp-pointed noses and rounding sterns. The original volume of the\r\n_Patrie_ was 111,250 cubic feet, which was later increased to 128,910,\r\nby the insertion of a cylindrical section at the major diameter of the\r\nhull. The _République_ had a volume of 2,000 cubic feet more than the\r\n_Patrie_, and a length of 200 feet, or a little less than the enlarged\r\n_Patrie_. She also had a diameter of 35½ feet as against 33¾ in the\r\nsister vessel. As the technical reader may like more complete details\r\nof these two noted air ships, a fuller account is given in Appendix III.\r\n\r\nThe _Patrie_ was a swift and graceful ship which, during its brief\r\nactivities in 1906-7, made many remarkable trips at an altitude of\r\nabout half a mile, and frequently maneuvered with the troops. She\r\nsailed with excellent stability, had a speed of about 28 miles an hour,\r\nand, with four men, had a radius of action of 280 miles. In November,\r\n1907, carrying four passengers, she voyaged from Paris to Verdun,\r\non the German frontier, where she was to be stationed. In spite of\r\na quartering wind, the total distance of 175 miles was traversed in\r\nseven hours and three quarters, or at an average overground speed of\r\n25 miles an hour. But while at Verdun, after some maneuvers, she was\r\ntoo insecurely anchored to the ground by means of iron stakes. A strong\r\nwind came, tore out the pickets, and overpowered the soldiers, some\r\ntwo hundred in number, who were trying to hold the vessel. As she was\r\npulling them along the ground, they were ordered to let go. The huge\r\nship bounded high into the air, soared across France, England, Wales,\r\nand part of Ireland, then far out over the Atlantic where she vanished,\r\nleaving no trace behind.\r\n\r\nThe _République_ also had a brilliant but ephemeral career, from July,\r\n1908, to September, 1909. She surpassed the _Patrie_ not only in bulk\r\nand buoyancy, but also in power and speed. She had an 80-horse-power\r\nmotor as against the _Patrie’s_ motor of 60 to 70 horse power. She\r\ncould carry eight to nine men, had a speed of about thirty miles an\r\nhour, and a radius of action of 500 miles. She made a number of long\r\nflights and manifested satisfactory steadiness and stability. But on\r\nSeptember 25, 1909, while maneuvering near Paris, one of her propellers\r\nbroke and tore a great gash in her envelope. At once, with outrushing\r\ngas and collapsing hull, the great ship fell 500 feet crashing to the\r\nearth, a total wreck, and killing her crew of four officers. This\r\ndisaster illustrated forcibly the advantage of the cellular system of\r\nballoon construction, and drew more favorable attention to the rigid\r\ntype of air ship cultivated in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe famous firm that produced the _République_ brought forth, in\r\n1909, two other fine vessels patterned after it, the _Russie_ and _La\r\nLiberté_, built respectively for Russia and France. The _Russie_ made\r\nher first voyage on May 29th, ascending 600 feet with eight passengers,\r\nand maneuvering under perfect control. After her official trial,\r\nin June, she was sent to St. Petersburg, being the first dirigible\r\nfurnished to a foreign government by a private concern. The _Liberté_\r\nwas launched the last week in August and, after various practice and\r\nofficial tests, was accepted by the French government two months later.\r\nOn a notable voyage, made on September 20th, she sailed ten hours with\r\nher Panhard motor constantly working.\r\n\r\nThe escape of the _Patrie_ was a loss keenly felt by the French people,\r\nbut soon compensated by the generosity of M. Deutsch de la Meurthe.\r\nThis liberal patron of aëronautics had a dirigible of excellent design,\r\nwhose hull, based on the plans of Colonel Renard, was contrived and\r\nbuilt by E. Surcouf, director of the Astra aëronautic establishment,\r\nalong with H. Kapferer, while its other parts were built by Voisin,\r\nboth of Billancourt. In September preceding the accident to the\r\n_Patrie_, he had offered the use of his air ship, the _Ville de Paris_,\r\nto his government, which accepted the gift with the understanding that\r\nit was not to be delivered except in case of war or emergency. When,\r\ntherefore, in November, 1907, the disaster occurred to the _Patrie_,\r\nM. Deutsch at once placed his dirigible in the hands of the military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—_La Ville de Paris._]\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Paris_ showed considerable resemblance to her prototype,\r\nthe _France_ of 1884, but differed from that elegant vessel in various\r\nimportant features. Her hull was shaped like a wine bottle with its\r\nthickest end, or bow, brought to a sharp projectile point, and its\r\nother end furnished, like an arrow, with four fixed guiding surfaces\r\nto steady its flight. These guiding surfaces were elongated, finlike,\r\ncylindrical sacs, inflated as shown in the illustration. The hull\r\nmeasured 200 feet long, 34½ feet in major diameter, 112,847 cubic feet\r\nin volume. Heavy bands of canvas with their edges sewed along the\r\nsides of the balloon served as flaps for the attachment of the cords\r\nsuspending the long car beneath. With this long suspension the weight\r\nof the car was more evenly distributed over the envelope than in the\r\nLebaudy balloons. An interesting improvement in this air ship was the\r\nstabilizing planes, placed above the car, fore and aft, to lift or\r\ndepress aëroplanelike, thus enabling the pilot to raise or lower the\r\nvessel, also to alter her trim, or to check her pitching. As might be\r\nexpected, her flight was very steady, but as the motor developed only\r\n70 to 75 horse power, her velocity did not exceed twenty-five miles per\r\nhour. In January, 1908, she made a run of 147 miles in seven hours, six\r\nminutes, with an average speed of 21 miles an hour. Further details of\r\nconstruction are given in Appendix III.\r\n\r\nWe now have had examples of the three leading types of motor balloons;\r\nthe rigid, the semirigid, the flexible. The rigid type, as exemplified\r\nin the Schwartz and Zeppelin air ships, is characterized by its\r\nsolidly trussed hull of invariable size and form to which all other\r\nparts are directly attached. The semirigid type, exemplified in the\r\nLebaudy vessels, has a flexible hull, generally of woven fabric, with\r\na trussed floor or platform for its ventral part, from which the car\r\nis suspended. The flexible type, as seen in the _Ville de Paris_, the\r\n_France_, and its predecessors, consists of a flexible hull entirely\r\ndevoid of stiffening framework, together with a car, usually quite\r\nlong, suspended from the bag directly. These are all of the important\r\nkinds in use at present. A combination of balloon and aëroplane has\r\nbeen tried by Santos-Dumont, Malecot, and others, but thus far has\r\nnot resulted in a very successful and distinct type. Of the many\r\npowerful, swift, and elegant balloons which sprang into being after\r\nthe success of the Lebaudy vessels, all could be classified under the\r\nabove three types. Neither kind proved preëminently the fittest for\r\nall service, but the semi-rigid and flexible balloons multiplied most\r\nrapidly; partly, no doubt, because of their cheapness and convenience\r\nof management. We may review briefly this new crop of air ships, before\r\nturning to the novel and huge rigid vessels of Count von Zeppelin.\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Paris_ was followed, in 1909, by the _Clément-Bayard_,\r\na slightly larger vessel of very similar pattern, constructed for the\r\nRussian government for $40,000. It also, like the _Ville de Paris_,\r\nwas built by the Astra Society. The most striking feature of this new\r\nballoon was its curious stern with its bulblike steadying surfaces.\r\nThese fin surfaces were not flat, as in the _Patrie_, nor cylindrical,\r\nas in the _Ville de Paris_, but of pear form, with the blunt ends\r\npointing rearward and inflated like the rest of the hull. Apparently\r\nthese tail bags were not economical of power, since, as is well\r\nknown, a pear shape encounters greater resistance when moving sharp\r\nend forward than when moving blunt end forward. However this be, the\r\nstabilizing force proved very effective. The vessel was driven by a\r\nClément-Bayard motor of 100 horse power actuating a wooden screw placed\r\nin front of the long car, as in the _France_. A speed of 30 miles an\r\nhour was attainable, and the ship could accommodate eight passengers.\r\nOn one occasion it made a round trip from Sartrouville, traversing 125\r\nmiles at an average speed of 27 miles an hour. It was acquired by the\r\nRussian government on August 23, 1909, having on that day completed\r\nits third official test, and satisfied the requirement of rising 1,550\r\nmeters and voyaging two hours at a height of 1,200 meters. Two notable\r\nincidents of that voyage were that the air ship made a new record for\r\naltitude, and on landing was caught by a squall which tore it from the\r\nhands of thirty men, after which, owing to motor failure, it drifted\r\nfreely across country, tripped on a willow, and fell into the Seine,\r\nwhence it was rescued after considerable pains and labor.\r\n\r\nOther vessels presently built by the Astra Society may be listed,\r\ntogether with their size in cubic meters, as follows: _Ville de\r\nBordeaux_, 3,300 m^3;[13] _Ville de Nancy_, 3,300 m^3; _Colonel\r\nRenard_, 4,000 m^3; _España_, 4,000 m^3; _Clément-Bayard II_, 6,500\r\nm^3; _Transaerienne I_, 6,500 m^3; _Flandre_, 6,500 m^3 (228,579\r\ncubic feet). These were among the most noted air ships produced in\r\nFrance toward the close of the first decade of the twentieth century.\r\nOn the whole they proved to be swift and stable ships adapted either\r\nfor military use, or for exhibitions and sport, and even for regular\r\ntransportation of passengers.\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Nancy_ was one of the conspicuous dirigibles of the\r\nsummer of 1909. It was constructed primarily for use at the Exposition\r\nat Nancy, and was owned by the Compagnie Générale Transaerienne, an\r\naërial passenger transportation society organized at Paris, in\r\nMarch, 1909, with a capital of one million francs. This society planned\r\nto inaugurate an aërial line from Paris to Bordeaux, in 1910, equipped\r\nwith other vessels of the Astra construction, more powerful than the\r\n_Ville de Nancy_, and capable of transporting a dozen passengers.\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LA VILLE DE PARIS._\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _COLONEL RENARD._\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Nancy_ was slightly smaller and slightly more powerful\r\nthan the _Clément-Bayard I_, besides differing in minor details. It\r\nmeasured 55 meters in length, 10 meters in greatest diameter, and\r\ncubed 33,000 meters, as against the 35,000 meters of its predecessor.\r\nIt was driven by a 100-horse-power Bayard-Clément motor actuating a\r\nChauvière screw propeller at the front of the car. The car itself was\r\nmade of steel tubes covered with fabric, and near the engine with\r\nsheet aluminum. The tail bags were an evident improvement on those of\r\nthe previous air ships, being less blunt at the rear, and therefore\r\nless adapted to generate a retarding suction. They were still rather\r\nbulbous, however.\r\n\r\nThis splendid vessel made various interesting voyages during the\r\nsummer of 1909, the first on June 27th, piloted by Surcouf and\r\nKapferer, directors of the Astra Society. On July 14th, she maneuvered\r\nat Longchamps, side by side with the _République_, thus contrasting\r\nnicely with the ship designed by Julliot. It was the first time two\r\ndirigibles navigated together in regular maneuver. The _Ville de Nancy_\r\nwas naturally the swifter, having greater power and less bulk than\r\nthe other. About the middle of July she sailed from Sartrouville to\r\nNancy, where she was to sail about the Exposition grounds and make\r\ndaily excursions, carrying passengers for 100 francs per trip. These\r\nvoyages proved very popular, being the first of their kind, and in\r\nthemselves quite attractive. As the vessel was endowed with excellent\r\nstability and had manifested high speed, she was well suited to be the\r\nfirst regular passenger air ship, and the herald of the aërial liners\r\nprojected to cruise between Paris and Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nThe _Colonel Renard_ was closely patterned after the _Ville de Nancy_,\r\nbut was larger and more powerful. She measured 212 feet in length,\r\n140,000 cubic feet in volume and carried an engine of 120 horse power,\r\ndriving a Chauvière propeller. On July 13th she made her first trip,\r\ncruising one hour with notable facility, then reëntered the hangar[14]\r\nof the Astra Society, at Beauval near Meaux. Thence, on August 23d, she\r\nsailed for Rheims to compete in the aëronautical races, arriving after\r\na very successful cruise. On August 29th, she circled the ten kilometer\r\nrectangular course at Betheny, near Rheims, five times in 1 hour, 19\r\nminutes, 40 seconds, thus winning the Prix des Aëronats,[15] of 10,000\r\nfrancs offered for the vessel that should accomplish, in the least\r\ntime, those five rounds, aggregating 50 kilometers. The showing was not\r\nremarkable, but the vessel could sail much faster in a straightaway\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThe prize-winning _Renard_ was quickly followed by the _España_, a\r\nvessel of the same size and pattern, built for the Spanish government\r\nby the same capable firm. During October this fine air ship made\r\nseveral trial trips, carrying seven men. On November 2d she made\r\na splendid official test voyage of five hours, sailing from the\r\nAstra aërodrome, at Beauval, to Paris and return, a distance of 250\r\nkilometers in 5 hours and 10 minutes, or at the average rate of 31\r\nmiles an hour for the entire course. On November 5th, she started on a\r\nten-hour voyage, with five men and fuel for fifteen hours; but after\r\nfive hours, stopped her engine, and came to earth, owing to the bending\r\nof the main shaft of the motor.\r\n\r\nBesides the great auto balloons designed by Julliot and Surcouf, of\r\nwhich the _République_ and _Colonel Renard_ are examples, a number of\r\nconvenient cruisers were brought forth in 1909 by the Zodiac Company.\r\nOne of the leading spirits in this enterprise was the famous Count de\r\nla Vaulx, well known for his auto balloon designs and his long voyages\r\nin sphericles. The chief merit of these modest air ships, which ranged\r\nin volume from 25,000 cubic feet upwards, was cheapness and facility of\r\ndemounting and shipment. They were intended to popularize the art among\r\nthe masses, by giving everyone a chance to make a voyage at no great\r\nexpense. Besides their applicability to sport, touring, and public\r\nuses, some were designed for considerable speed and endurance; which\r\nqualities, together with their demountability and partial independence\r\nof hangars, were expected to give them military value. They were of\r\nthe flexible type, so arranged that the various parts were easily\r\ndetachable, so as to be packed for transportation, by wagon or car.\r\nThe smaller ones might be called semi-navigables, since they had the\r\norgans of a swift motor balloon, but, like the common sphericles,\r\ncould easily be demounted and hauled home—a likely issue on a day of\r\nany considerable wind. The first one cost $5,000, cubed 25,000 feet\r\nand, with its 16-horse-power engine, traveled 13 miles per hour. Its\r\nhull had the form of a whale with docked and rounded tail. From this\r\nbody hung an elongated car with a screw at the rear and elevating\r\nplanes in front. Others of similar make, but larger, followed in rapid\r\norder, their common mission being that advocated by Santos-Dumont, in\r\nthe early part of the decade, when he produced his _Runabout_ and\r\n_Omnibus_—to give everybody a ride.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—_Le Petit Journal_, ZODIAC TYPE.]\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ZODIAC III._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ZODIAC IV._]\r\n\r\nThe _Zodiac I_ was quickly followed by vessels _II_ and _III_, cubing\r\nrespectively 1,200 and 1,400 meters. The _No. II_ had a speed of\r\ntwenty, or more, miles per hour, and carried two passengers when\r\ninflated with coal gas, three with hydrogen. The _No. III_, of torpedo\r\nform, measured 133 feet long, 28 feet in major diameter, carried four\r\npersons, and sailed 25 miles an hour with her 40-horse-power Ballot\r\nengine. On August 29th, piloted by Count de la Vaulx, she competed with\r\nthe _Colonel Renard_, at Rheims, for the _Prix des Aëronats_, making\r\nfive rounds of the ten kilometer course in one hour and twenty-five\r\nminutes, this being at the average speed of 22 miles an hour. On\r\nOctober 30th, again piloted by the same renowned aëronaut, she sailed\r\nfrom Brussels to Anvers, rounded the lofty Cathedral spire, and\r\nreturned to her aërodrome, traversing a distance of sixty kilometers in\r\none hour and twelve minutes, or with an average speed of 31 miles an\r\nhour, a good showing for so small an air ship.\r\n\r\nA very handsome dirigible, named the _Belgique_, was constructed early\r\nin 1909, by the skillful aëronautical engineer, Louis Godard, of Paris,\r\nin collaboration with the prominent Belgian engineer and sportsman,\r\nRobert Goldschmidt. It was a flexible balloon of elegant torpedo form,\r\nmeasuring 175 feet long, 30 feet in major diameter, and 106,000 cubic\r\nfeet in volume. It was propelled by two 60-horse-power Vivinus engines\r\nactuating two screws, made of fabric stretched over radial sticks,\r\nand placed at either end of the spindle-shaped car. The control was\r\nprovided for by ample keel surface, an elevating plane in front,\r\nand ingeniously designed fins on the rear of the hull to steady the\r\nmotion. The entire structure showed much originality and skill. When\r\nthe dirigible was tested near Brussels, on June 28th, it was piloted\r\nby Louis Godard, the famous expert in sphericals, accompanied by\r\nGoldschmidt. Godard’s début in this capacity was reported as excellent.\r\n\r\nThe Italian government brought forth, in the summer of 1909, a swift\r\nand elegant auto balloon showing considerable originality of design.\r\nIt has a porpoise-shaped hull of 2,500 cubic meters capacity, divided\r\ninto seven compartments, so as to obviate the accident which wrecked\r\nthe _République_. An ample keel along the rear bottom, and large\r\naëroplane surfaces at the stern, serve to guide and steady the vessel.\r\nPropelled by twin screws well above a short car, she readily attained\r\nthirty miles an hour, carrying four persons. On October 31st, starting\r\non her seventeenth voyage, she cruised from the aëronautic park, Vigna\r\nde Vale, near Rome, to Naples and back to Rome by ten o’clock at\r\nnight, having sailed over the edge of the Mediterranean Sea and over\r\nthe French squadron in the bay, remaining fourteen hours in the air\r\nand traversing 520 kilometers, or 323 miles. It was one of the finest\r\nvoyages of the year. Further details of this Italian military dirigible\r\n_No. I bis_, together with illustrations, are given in _Aërophile_ for\r\nJanuary 15, 1910, together with its prototype the dirigible _No. I_,\r\nwhich maneuvered so successfully in 1908.\r\n\r\nEngland and America all along had pursued an oriental, or\r\nsemicivilized, policy toward the auto balloon, languidly watching\r\nthe progress elsewhere, and hoping some time to enjoy the fruition,\r\nif not the glory, of the costly and successful experiments made in\r\nother countries. In 1909, however, the British government appropriated\r\nnearly $400,000 for aëronautics, and the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives voted $500,000, but promptly reversed its action,\r\nand gave nothing, though it may be said that even then there was a\r\ngrowing sentiment in favor of a more liberal policy. The movement to\r\nsecure the beginning of an aërial fleet in England is summarized in the\r\nfollowing paragraph.[16]\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LA BELGIQUE._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN MILITARY DIRIGIBLE _NO. I BIS_.]\r\n\r\n  “The naval authorities were entrusted with the building of a\r\n  rigid ship, whilst to the military department was delegated the\r\n  work of building non-rigid and semi-rigid ships. A national\r\n  air-ship fund was organized by the _Morning Post_ with the\r\n  object of purchasing a French Lebaudy semi-rigid dirigible\r\n  which would be presented to the War Office; whilst Mr. Arthur\r\n  du Cros and other members of the Parliamentary Aërial Committee\r\n  arranged for a _Clément_ non-rigid air ship of new design, to\r\n  sail from Paris to London, and also to qualify for purchase as\r\n  a unit of the British aërial fleet.”\r\n\r\nThe non-rigid auto balloon ordered from Clément, and afterwards known\r\nas the _Clément-Bayard II_, was the masterpiece of that skilful\r\ndesigner, and occupied his best thought and energy for eighteen\r\nmonths, aided by his devoted and capable engineer, Sabathier. She\r\nwas completed in the Clément-Bayard factory at Lamotte-Breuil in\r\nApril, 1910, and during the next five months made thirty-two test\r\nascensions and practice voyages. In particular she took a conspicuous\r\npart in the military maneuvers at Picardie during the early half of\r\nSeptember, where with wonderful precision and airworthiness she made\r\nforced voyages in fair weather and foul, remaining, when so desired,\r\nin continuous communication with the land office by means of wireless\r\ntelegraphy. Finally, on a fair day, September 16th, the tried and\r\nperfected vessel was brought forth from her hangar for the long\r\ncontemplated voyage to London, her machinery and rigging in trimmest\r\norder, and her car furnished with supplies for twenty hours, or thrice\r\nthe anticipated time of transit.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was a glorious achievement for aëronautics, and for the\r\nenthusiastic constructor and his devoted aids. Starting at seven\r\no’clock in the morning, with seven men aboard, including happy Clément,\r\nSabathier, and an English delegate, the whalelike cruiser sailed\r\ndirectly to London with admirable regularity, covering the entire\r\ndistance of 242 miles in six hours, or at the rate of forty miles\r\nan hour, which is better time than could be made by land and water.\r\nEnthusiastic cheers from the English spectators greeted the arrival of\r\nthis French dirigible, built for the English government. Then quietly\r\nthe English soldiers took the vessel in hand, as if performing a\r\nfamiliar duty, and housed her in the _Daily Mail_ hangar, at Wormwood\r\nScrubs. Thus simply and without unusual incident terminated the first\r\nmotor-balloon cruise between the two countries, and one of the finest\r\nvoyages in the history of aëronautics.\r\n\r\nIn outward appearance the _Clément-Bayard II_ closely resembled her\r\npredecessor, except for the absence of empennage on her envelope. In\r\nthe whalelike elegance of her hull she was, in fact, a reversion to the\r\ntrim and efficient model of Renard’s dirigible of 1884, which in turn\r\nwas a fair copy of Jullien’s model of 1850, all having excellent forms\r\nfor speed and stability. But the new vessel was of greater size and\r\npower than her predecessor. Her net buoyancy was sufficient to carry\r\ntwenty passengers. Her average speed tested in a round-trip voyage was\r\nabout 50 kilometers or 31 miles per hour when her two motors developed\r\n200 horse power, and 55 kilometers or 34 miles per hour when the\r\nengines developed their maximum effort of 260 horse power. The details\r\nof construction were so elaborate and important, and so representative\r\nof the best aëronautical workmanship of the time that a full account of\r\ntheir chief features is presented in Appendix III. In passing it may be\r\nadded that some time before sailing to England the _Clément-Bayard II_,\r\nbecause of her excellent workmanship and maneuvers, received the first\r\nprize at the review of dirigibles by the French Minister of War.\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _CLÉMENT-BAYARD I._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _CLÉMENT-BAYARD II._\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—_Clément-Bayard II_, 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe dirigible to be purchased with the money secured by the popular\r\nsubscription organized by the _Morning Post_ was ordered from the\r\nLebaudy factory at Moisson in July, 1909, to be delivered directly\r\nthrough the air to Farnborough before November 6, 1910. This\r\nstipulation was severe enough, but furthermore the vessel was to\r\nbe a considerable departure from any thus far built at that famous\r\nfactory, and was to be the largest air ship yet constructed in France.\r\nAs usual the general design of the huge balloon was entrusted to the\r\ndistinguished aëronautical engineer, Henri Julliot, and this was a\r\ncertain guarantee of its successful operation.\r\n\r\nThe general features of this great military dirigible resemble those\r\nof her prototype, the _Patrie_, differing chiefly in the shape of her\r\nhull and the method of stiffening. The hull itself was more longish\r\nthan the _Patrie’s_, but had the same sharp prow and blunt stern; for\r\na blunt stern offers better support to the empennage planes, though\r\nit increases the resistance more than a tapering stern. The trussed\r\nframing to stiffen the ship was no longer a platform inserted in the\r\nbase of the hull, but a long trussed beam of cruciform cross section,\r\nmade of steel tubing and suspended intermediately between the hull and\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThe hull was of excellent workmanship and bold design. The envelope\r\nwas of rubberized tissue, measured 338 feet in length, 39.4 feet in\r\ndiameter and cubed 353,000 feet. Its length was, therefore, 8.5 times\r\nits diameter, an extraordinary proportion for a balloon of the flexible\r\ntype. The hull was provided with three ballonets, two ripping panels,\r\nand various valves, as shown in the scale drawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—MORNING POST DIRIGIBLE, 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe car, made of steel tubing and large enough for twenty persons,\r\ncarried two Panhard-Levassor motors of 135 horse power each, actuating\r\ntwo Chauvière wooden screws, sixteen feet in diameter, placed on either\r\nside, well outward and upward, the transmission gear permitting either\r\nengine, or both, to drive the screws at one time. Below the car and\r\nwell forward was a ground keel, or post, on which the whole vessel\r\ncould pivot with the wind, when riding at anchor, while a shorter\r\nground post was placed at the rear of the car.\r\n\r\nThe controlling surfaces were adequate and skillfully arranged. To\r\nmaintain steadiness and directness of flight, fixed empennage planes,\r\nboth horizontal and vertical, were provided, some attached to the stern\r\nof the hull, others at the rear of the trussed suspension beam. To\r\ndirect the up and down movement, ailerons placed well to the front and\r\nrear of the long framing, were turned about conjunctively in opposite\r\ndirections, thus causing the vessel to raise or lower her bow. Needless\r\nto say, all these navigation appliances worked with ample force and\r\neffectiveness from the beginning of the earliest tests.\r\n\r\nAfter four preliminary ascensions the great air ship started from\r\nMoisson to her destination at Farnborough, having on board Henri\r\nJulliot, Louis Capazza, the pilot, Alexander Bannerman, director of\r\nthe aëronautic military school at Aldershot, and five other men. It\r\nwas a triumphant and glorious voyage, one of the most splendid in\r\nthe history of aërostation. Piloted by aid of chart and compass, and\r\nby signal fires and captive balloons arranged along her route, the\r\nvessel followed a direct course, without check or hindrance, crossing\r\na wide part of the English Channel and arriving before the hangar at\r\nAldershot, where the British soldiers awaited her, and where she was\r\nsafely landed, having made the whole voyage of 230 miles in 5.5 hours,\r\nat a level varying between five hundred and two thousand feet. As\r\nshown by the accompanying map, about one third of the route lay over\r\nthe Channel, or, more accurately, 78 miles, which was traversed in two\r\nhours. Thus the whole journey was accomplished at an average speed\r\nof nearly forty-two miles an hour, or in less time than it could be\r\neffected in any other way than through the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15 Novembre 1910\r\n\r\nFIG. 25.—ROUTE OF BRITISH MILITARY DIRIGIBLES FROM FRANCE TO ENGLAND,\r\n1910.]\r\n\r\nThe United States War Department, in 1908, started an aërial squadron\r\nby purchasing from Thomas S. Baldwin, for $10,000, a tiny air ship of\r\nthe flexible type, a trifle larger than Santos-Dumont’s _Runabout_, but\r\nin fact the smallest military dirigible then in existence. It had a\r\nrubberized gray silk cylindrical hull slightly tapering toward the rear\r\nand terminating in ogival ends, its length being 96 feet, its major\r\ndiameter 19½ feet. From this was suspended, by means of netting and\r\nsteel cables, a longish car having at the rear a double rudder working\r\nabout a vertical hinge, at the front an elevating plane and an 11-foot\r\nwooden screw driven by a Curtiss 20-horse-power water-cooled engine.\r\nWith two men aboard, this vessel readily attained over twenty miles an\r\nhour in a straightaway course, and at times more nearly thirty miles an\r\nhour. Its total ascensional force was 1,350 pounds, of which 500 were\r\navailable for men, ballast and supplies.\r\n\r\nSantos-Dumont’s most strenuous disciples outside of France were found\r\namong the German military officers. These advocated and promoted both\r\nthe semirigid and the flexible types of auto balloon, with such ability\r\nas to match the best productions of the foremost French designers.\r\nThe most successful pioneers of these two types in Germany were\r\nrespectively, Major von Gross, commander of the balloon battalion at\r\nTegel, near Berlin, and Major Von Parseval of the Bavarian army, and\r\ndirector of the Society for the Study of Motor Air Ships.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1907, a number of Gross auto balloons were built in\r\nsuccession, for the German Aëronautical Battalion, by Master Engineer\r\nBasenach, under the supervision of its commander, Major Gross. The\r\nfirst was intended only as a model, though it was large enough for\r\ntwo passengers. It cubed 63,000 feet, but having an engine of hardly\r\nmore than 20 horse power, was necessarily slow. It was succeeded by\r\nthe _Gross I_, and others, all having rigid ventral parts, like the\r\n_Patrie_, but with hulls of rather better form for speed and bulk\r\ncombined, having blunter bow and longer stern.\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _U. S. SIGNAL CORPS DIRIGIBLE I._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy U. S. Signal Corps.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _GROSS II._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\nThe second Gross air ship, built in 1908, cubed 176,000 feet, and\r\nattained a speed of 27 miles per hour, driven by two 75-horse-power\r\nDaimler motors. On September 11th of that year, with four persons\r\naboard, she made a round trip from Berlin lasting 13 hours, covering\r\n176 miles, and attaining altitudes up to 4,000 feet. This was one of\r\nthe finest voyages known at the time. This air ship was purchased by\r\nthe German government, named _Gross I_, and sent to Metz. A detailed\r\ndescription is given in Appendix III.\r\n\r\nThe _Gross II_, brought forth in April, 1909, resembled her predecessor\r\nin build, but had greater power and speed. Her hull cubed 176,000\r\ncubic feet, had a blunt bow, full body and sharp stern, was provided\r\nwith horizontal and vertical keels, a sliding weight, and a ballonet\r\nat either end. She was propelled by two Körting engines of 75 horse\r\npower each, actuating two three-blade propellers. Under the action of\r\nher keels and stabilizing planes and rudder, her motion was steady and\r\nprecise. A special feature of this air ship was the wireless telegraph\r\nequipment by which she could send messages in all directions over a\r\nrange of 300 miles or more. She made many practice voyages during the\r\nseason of 1909, sometimes alone, again in concert with other auto\r\nballoons and with troops. In August she made a fine voyage of sixteen\r\nhours, from Tegel to Apolda and return, traversing 470 kilometers.\r\n\r\nThe above described vessel was followed by others, large and small.\r\nThe _Gross III_ measured 70 meters long, cubed 7,500 meters, and was\r\npropelled by four Körting motors aggregating 300 horse power. This was\r\na splendid vessel, and one of extraordinary speed.\r\n\r\nVarious auto balloons of the Parseval type were designed by Major Von\r\nParseval of the Bavarian army, who also was one of the inventors of the\r\nkite balloon. Satisfactory experiments with his air ship were made as\r\nearly as 1906. These formed the basis of larger vessels, subsequently\r\nconstructed in the same factory of August Riedinger of Augsburg,\r\nfor the Motor Air Ship Study Society, of which Parseval was general\r\nmanager. This society, organized practically at the command of the\r\nEmperor, purchased the Parseval patents and began the development of\r\nauto balloons as a business enterprise, soon furnishing a series of its\r\nflexible air ships to the German army.\r\n\r\nAfter the experiments of 1906, the Parseval air ship was enlarged from\r\n2,500 to 2,800 cubic meters, its length becoming 52 meters and its\r\nmajor diameter 8.7 meters. Its hull was of cylindric form, with rounded\r\nbow and egg-shaped stern; had two air bags—one fore, the other aft—and\r\nat the stern carried two fixed horizontal planes and a vertical rudder.\r\nFrom this envelope the car, made largely of aluminum, was hung by steel\r\ncables, and on its bottom had trolley wheels resting on suspension\r\ncables joining the front and rear parts of the hull. The vessel was\r\npropelled by a 50-horse-power Mercedes motor actuating a four-blade\r\nscrew propeller 13 feet in diameter, mounted between the car and hull.\r\nThis screw was made of thin steel tubes covered with shirting. Among\r\nthe merits of Parseval’s air ship may be mentioned its lightness and\r\ndemountability, and its kite-like effect on the air, got by canting\r\nthe hull while the car, rolling on the suspension cables, allowed\r\nthe screw mounted above it to thrust horizontally. The canting was\r\neffected by giving one ballonet more air than the other, thus causing\r\nits end of the hull to sink. The speed was about twenty-five miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nPLATE IX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PARSEVAL I._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PARSEVAL II._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\nThe second _Parseval_ was of greater bulk and power than her\r\npredecessor. Her hull which was of cylindric form, with round prow\r\nand pointed stern, measured 190 feet long, 30.5 feet in diameter, and\r\n113,000 cubic feet in volume. She resembled her predecessor in the\r\narrangement of the two ballonets, and in the “loose,” or trolley,\r\nsystem of suspension of the car. The propeller was a unique patented\r\ndevice of Von Parseval’s. It had four cloth blades so weighted with\r\nlead as to stand out firmly under centrifugal force, assuming an\r\neffective shape for propulsion, though limp and deformed when at rest.\r\nVarious interesting evolutions were performed by this vessel in the\r\nautumn of 1908, including tests imposed by the military authorities,\r\nas a condition of purchase by the government, one requirement being a\r\nvoyage of one hour at an altitude of 1,500 meters; another requirement\r\nbeing a continuous cruise of twelve hours. These tests completed,\r\nthe Motor-Luftschiff-Studien-Gesellschaft sold its proud ship to the\r\nVaterland for 210,000 marks.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the War Department purchased the _Gross I_, already\r\ndescribed, and Zeppelin’s third great ship, naming it _Zeppelin I_.\r\nGermany thus began her program of developing a great aërial fleet,\r\nby acquiring three powerful and well tried ships, each capable of\r\nremaining all day in the air, and having a radius of action of several\r\nhundred miles. They were frequently called upon to make test voyages in\r\nall kinds of weather, to maneuver with the troops, to pass in review\r\nbefore the Emperor, at times conveying prominent officers and members\r\nof the noblest families, including Prince Henry and the Crown Prince,\r\nwho manifested a fondness for navigating about their newly opened\r\nempire of the sky. But sometimes the tests were crucial. On September\r\n11, 1908, both the _Gross_ and _Parseval_ were summoned to Potsdam by\r\nHis Majesty. They set forth from their sheds, at Tegel, in face of a\r\nstrong wind. After journeying some distance they each had to abandon\r\nthe voyage, the _Gross_ returning home, and the _Parseval_ falling to\r\nthe ground owing to an accident.\r\n\r\nThe third Parseval air ship was brought forth on February 18, 1909, by\r\nthe Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft, an aëronautical firm founded by merging\r\nthe Motor-Luftschiff-Studien-Gesellschaft with the A. E. G. This vessel\r\nclosely resembled her predecessor, but possessed greater size, power,\r\nand perfection of detail. Her hull at first measured 224 feet long,\r\n47 feet in diameter, and 198,000 cubic feet in volume, but later was\r\nenlarged to 235,000 cubic feet by increasing its diameter.\r\n\r\nHer car, which could accommodate twelve passengers, was framed of steel\r\ntubing covered with canvas, and was divided into two parts, separated\r\nby the big gasoline cylinder running athwart ship, the passenger cabin\r\nbeing to the fore, the engine room aft. Here were stationed the two\r\nengines, of 120 horse power each, actuating reversible right and left\r\n_Parseval_ screws 13 feet in diameter, located to the rear, well aloft\r\nand outward on either side. In the forepart of the passenger cabin was\r\nspace for the pilot and his navigating appliances; his chart desk, his\r\nvalve controls, his statoscope, manometers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe great ship with her nine tons burden was to have sailed from\r\nBitterfeld to Frankfort, for the Aëronautical Exposition, but owing\r\nto excessive gales, she was sent by rail. Once there, she made many\r\nexcursions, at times carrying passengers at a schedule rate, reported\r\nto be 200 marks for a voyage of one to two hours. In October she made\r\nan inter-city excursion covering a distance of nearly 500 miles, during\r\nwhich she passed four nights in the open air, finally returning in\r\ngood form to Frankfort. On October 27th she made a farewell tour about\r\nFrankfort, then voyaged along the Main and down the Rhine valley to\r\nCologne, there to participate in the aëronautic military maneuvers,\r\ntogether with the _Parseval I_, the _Gross II_ and the _Zeppelin\r\nII_. Having passed creditably through these and other operations in\r\nthe autumn, she was eventually stationed at Tegel, as a part of the\r\nnational fleet.\r\n\r\nThe fourth _Parseval_, a smaller vessel, was built for the Deutscher\r\nAëro Club early in 1909. Her hull cubed 113,000 feet, and her framing\r\nwas made of the strongest materials, carefully hollowed, to eliminate\r\nundue weight. At the rear of the car, on either side, were two\r\n100-horse engines, driving two _Parseval_ propellers at a common speed,\r\nwhether both engines were in operation, or only one. In many respects\r\nshe resembled her immediate predecessors, and her little successor\r\n_Parseval V_ of 1,200 cubic meters capacity and 30 meters length, built\r\nfor the Imperial Automobile Club.\r\n\r\nThe maneuvers at Cologne constituted the first grand demonstration of\r\nthe new fleet of military dirigibles, and proved a severe test of the\r\npowers of the air ships, even when manned by experienced crews and\r\ncommanded by regular military officers. Two companies of the balloon\r\ncorps battalion were in attendance. Large provisions of hydrogen loaded\r\non wagons, each carrying 100,000 cubic feet, were kept in readiness to\r\nbe attached to an express train and rushed at the first alarm to any\r\nballoon in need of replenishing. On Sunday, October 31, three of the\r\ndirigibles representing each type, _Zeppelin IV_, _Parseval I_, _Gross\r\nII_, left Cologne together, by official order, and returned after\r\nflights of 7, 10 and 11 hours respectively, covering in the aggregate\r\n930 miles. Again, leaving Cologne shortly before noon on November 3d,\r\nthey went down the Rhine, simulated a concerted attack on the great\r\nfortress of Eherenbreitstein, and returned in the evening, each having\r\ncovered 155 miles. And so on for many days they continued to execute\r\nmaneuvers under military orders and in severe forced marches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                    DEVELOPMENT OF RIGID DIRIGIBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the famous cavalry general of Würtemburg,\r\nand hero of the Franco-Prussian war, after retiring from the army,\r\norganized, in 1898, a limited liability company for the purpose of\r\ndeveloping a new type of dirigible which he had long contemplated.\r\nIt was to be a vessel far larger and swifter than any the world had\r\nyet seen. In the summer of 1900, after two years of industrious\r\nexperimental research and active construction, he brought forth from\r\nhis floating laboratory on Lake Constance, near Manzell, the first\r\nof those wonderful air ships which have aroused such expectation and\r\nenthusiasm in Germany. In outward appearance and in its chief features\r\nof design it typified the whole series of motor balloons thus far\r\ndeveloped and navigated by that illustrious inventor. Many valuable\r\nimprovements were added, as a result of trial and the advance of the\r\ncollateral sciences; but the fundamental plans seem to have proved as\r\npractical as they were bold and original. One by one were surmounted\r\nthe greatest obstacles, physical, financial and finally political; for\r\nthe Prussian Ministry did not favor his project at first, and many\r\naëronautical adepts were adverse to it. Those huge ships faced the fury\r\nof many a tempest; their dauntless builder endured the storm of hostile\r\ncriticism; but in the end, builder and ships alike won the plaudits of\r\na proud empire and of an astonished world.\r\n\r\nOutwardly a Zeppelin balloon may be described as a long cylinder with\r\nogival ends and a V-shaped keel running the length of its bottom. From\r\nafar the cylinder and pointed ends appear circular in cross section,\r\nbut they are sixteen-sided. About one-third the distance from either\r\nend of the great ship a small boat is suspended from the hull so\r\nclosely that at those places the keel is omitted to make room. These\r\ntwo boats are rigidly connected with the hull and support it when the\r\nvessel rests on, or is towed along the water. Within them are the crew\r\nand petroleum engines, while above them and outward on each side of\r\nthe hull, and fastened to it by outriggers, are two pairs of screw\r\npropellers, so placed as to exert their united thrust along the line\r\nof resistance. In some cases the crew can walk through the V-shaped\r\nkeel from one boat to another, the passageway being illuminated here\r\nand there, by transparent covering, or windows of celluloid, along the\r\nsides and floor. Again an observer may climb up through the hull and\r\ntake observations of the sky from above. Telephones, electric bells,\r\nand speaking tubes serve to transmit intelligence from one part of the\r\nvessel to another.\r\n\r\nThe frame of the hull is formed of sixteen longitudinal beams, or\r\ngirders, of trellised metal work running from prow to stern and\r\nriveted at regular intervals to cross bridges of similar trellised\r\nmetal work, each cross bridge being a sixteen-sided wheel with\r\ntrellised rims strengthened by radial rods running inward to a\r\ncentral flange of sheet aluminum. Thus the body of the vessel is\r\ndivided into many compartments, each bounded by two wheels, and the\r\nsurrounding longitudinal beams. Each compartment contains a hydrogen\r\nballoon, or sac, which fairly fills it and exerts a lift against\r\nthe longitudinal beams and against a netting formed of ramie cords\r\nstretched from wheel to wheel, diagonally between beams at their\r\ninner corners. Similarly the outward corners of the beams are joined\r\nby strong diagonal wires for the purpose of rigidity, and the whole\r\nexternal frame is covered with a heavy fabric which forms the outer\r\nskin, or wall of the hull. Between this skin and the hydrogen bags\r\nare air spaces, as also between bag and bag. Thus the whole vessel is\r\nbuoyed up by numerous thin hydrogen sacs, protected by the frame and\r\nouter skin from the direct sun, from foul weather, and from external\r\nshocks. The gas bags are also separated from each other by the bridge\r\nwork and flanges of aluminum.\r\n\r\nPLATE X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _GROSS III._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEPPELIN AIRSHIP STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nObviously there is a material advantage in having many gas cells and\r\ntwo propelling plants; for if one fails it may not prevent navigation.\r\nThe tandem arrangement of bags separated by the wheel-like cross\r\nbridges also allows the balloon to rear any amount without material\r\ndisplacement of the gas, or dangerous increase of pressure; for it must\r\nbe remembered that a single hydrogen sac extending the full length of\r\nan up-ended balloon of such length, would have an outward pressure of\r\nabout thirty pounds per square foot greater at the top than at the\r\nbottom. The poise of the vessel is maintained by shifting weights, and\r\nalso by use of fins, or rudders, when driving through the air; but\r\nthose arrangements vary in the different machines. So much for the\r\ngeneral features of these wonderful ships, of which four were built\r\nduring the decade from 1898 to 1908, and several more since that period.\r\n\r\nThe construction and trial of Count Zeppelin’s first air ship proved a\r\nformidable task, requiring all his resources of money and mechanical\r\nskill. As it rivaled in size and fluid displacement a large ocean\r\nliner, it could not well be launched and landed, except on the water.\r\nIt was therefore housed in a wooden shed 472 feet long, floating on 95\r\npontoons, and so anchored as to swing freely with the wind and assume\r\nits direction. This shed, as well as the ship, was very costly, and\r\nin an unfortunate hour was torn from its moorings by a tempest, which\r\ndid other damage entailing great expense and time for repairs. The\r\ninventor’s resources were becoming strained; for, as reported, the shed\r\ncost $50,000, while the first balloon cost more than twice that sum.\r\n\r\nFinally, the first launching was officially set for June 30, 1900. The\r\nlake was thronged with people massed along the shores, and dotting\r\nits surface with every kind of craft, from the fisherman’s primitive\r\nboat to the handsomest private yacht, or launch. All day the expectant\r\nmultitude waited, only to learn at dusk, that the inflation was not\r\ncompleted. Next day they tarried again till evening, and merely saw\r\nthe raft on which the balloon rested, towed out of the floating house.\r\nOn the third day, July 2d, those who waited were rewarded with an\r\ninteresting spectacle. The long stiff air ship was drawn forth from\r\nits shed, like a ram rod from a gun. Count Zeppelin, with two men,\r\noccupied the front boat, while two others took the rear one. After\r\ncareful adjustment the vessel was liberated, at eight o’clock, rose\r\nslowly and advanced over the water, accompanied by the droning of its\r\npropellers and the shouts of the delighted spectators, who realized\r\nthat they might be witnessing the commencement of a new epoch in\r\naërial navigation. But the voyage was not an unqualified success.\r\nThe controlling mechanism became deranged, the framework was bent,\r\nand the propellers could not be worked properly. A gentle wind was\r\nblowing and the vessel drifted with it, having an independent speed\r\nof only thirteen feet per second, at best. At eight-twenty she reached\r\nImmenstadt and landed on the water, having voyaged three and one half\r\nmiles, and having attained a height of thirteen hundred feet on a part\r\nof the journey.\r\n\r\nAt that date the _Zeppelin I_ was by far the largest and most\r\nelaborate air ship ever constructed. Her hull measured 416 feet long,\r\n38 feet across, cubed nearly 400,000 feet, weighed 9 tons, and had a\r\ndisplacement of 10 tons. The trellised frame was made of aluminum, and\r\nits body comprised seventeen compartments, of which fifteen were 26\r\nfeet long, and the other two 13 feet long. The outer cover was of linen\r\ntreated with pegamoid and tightly stretched. The hydrogen sacs were of\r\nthin fabric. The propulsion was effected by two benzine motors, one in\r\neither boat, which together developed 32 horse power, each driving,\r\nby means of bevel gears and shafting, a pair of four-blade propellers\r\n3.77 feet in diameter, at 1,100 revolutions per minute. Steering\r\nsidewise was effected by means of vertical rudders, while the trim was\r\ncontrolled by horizontal rudders at either side of the vessel, as also\r\nby means of a sliding weight which could be drawn fore and aft by means\r\nof a winch. Naturally some of these details were superseded ere long by\r\nbetter devices suggested by subsequent experience.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1900, _Zeppelin I_ made her second voyage, and with much\r\nbetter result. Starting from the same balloon house at Manzell, at\r\nfour-forty-five, she promptly rose a thousand feet, and maneuvered in\r\na seven-mile wind, steering in great curves at the will of the pilot.\r\nAt times the speed was nearly twenty miles an hour, as determined by\r\ncontinuous observations of the balloon’s position, taken from three\r\npoints of a triangle, together with the velocity of the wind on its\r\ncourse, duly recorded by an anemometer. Finally a landing on the water\r\nwas made at six o’clock, without mishap.\r\n\r\nThis last demonstration left the Count triumphant in other respects,\r\nbut without sufficient funds to bring his invention into practical\r\nuse. He must, therefore, look for additional money for the proper\r\ncontinuation of his great work. The financial task thus ensuing\r\noccupied much of his time during the next five years, but he finally\r\nsecured capital enough to continue his experiments and to build a\r\nsecond airship. This was completed and ready for trial in the latter\r\npart of 1905.\r\n\r\n_Zeppelin II_ resembled its predecessor in appearance, but embodied\r\nmany improvements suggested by the former trials. Its hull was 414\r\nfeet long, 38 feet in diameter, held 367,000 cubic feet of hydrogen\r\nin its sixteen gas bags, and weighed with all appliances and cargo,\r\nabout nine tons. It was, therefore, about ten per cent smaller than\r\nits predecessor; but at the same time it was far better powered than\r\nthe earlier one, and more effectively controlled. Each boat carried\r\nan 85-horse-power Daimler benzine motor, actuating two enlarged\r\npropellers. Ample steering surfaces, operated by the helmsman in the\r\nfront boat, served to turn the great ship about either of three axes\r\nand, at the same time, to displace her bodily up and down in the air,\r\neither by direct lift or by canting her hull so that her screw thrust\r\nand the pressure on her sides would produce the desired translation.\r\n\r\nTwo trials of Zeppelin’s second air ship were made on the Borden-See,\r\none on November 30, 1906, the other on January 17, 1907; but both\r\nmet with serious accident. In the first trial the balloon was towed\r\nby a motor boat some distance, then cut loose in the wind, which\r\nwas carrying it forward faster than the boat. But it soon became\r\nunmanageable and plunged into the water, suffering considerable damage.\r\nIn the second trial it flew for a short time at a speed of thirty\r\nfeet per second, when the engines were developing 36 horse power.\r\nSome maneuvering was effected in a strong wind, but presently the\r\npropellers stopped, the vessel dropped to the shore and was anchored on\r\nthe ground. During the night it was so badly damaged by the wind that\r\nCount Zeppelin ordered it to be taken to pieces to furnish material for\r\nfurther construction.\r\n\r\nThe loss of two mammoth air ships after such brief trial seemed\r\nenough to appall even a sturdy general of the Prussian army; but\r\nCount Zeppelin was too resolute to waste time in futile tears and\r\nhopeless dejection. Strong natures are usually stimulated by disaster,\r\nand aroused to fuller energy, to grimmer determination, if not to\r\ndesperate hazard. However, not desperation, but buoyant hope and high\r\nexpectation, based on ample experience, were now his ruling motive. Had\r\nnot his ship attained thirty feet per second with less than one fourth\r\nher motive power? The year began with disaster indeed, but he intended\r\nit to terminate in glorious victory. And such, indeed, was the happy\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1907, witnessed the launching of _Zeppelin III_. She had the\r\nsame length as her immediate predecessor, but she was a luckier vessel\r\nand better powered. On her official trial she voyaged at the height of\r\nhalf a mile, carrying eleven persons sixty-seven miles in two hours\r\nand seventeen minutes, or at more than twenty-nine miles per hour.\r\nThis was a record velocity exceeding that of the best military balloon\r\nin France. At times she attained a velocity of fifty feet per second,\r\nthus considerably outspeeding the swiftest ocean liner. Moreover, her\r\nstability and steering qualities were excellent. With pardonable\r\nelation, therefore, the illustrious inventor could report to the\r\nMinister of War the complete success of his experiments. And with good\r\nreason the German government now granted financial aid to test more\r\nfully the merits of the rigid system of construction.\r\n\r\nWith this assistance the industrious aëronaut erected a new floating\r\nhouse on the Borden-See at Friedrichshafen, and began the construction\r\nof a still larger air ship embodying further improvements in various\r\ndetails. _Zeppelin IV_ was 446 feet long, 42.5 in diameter, held\r\n460,000 cubic feet of hydrogen in her sixteen compartments, and had a\r\ntotal buoyancy of sixteen tons. She had a surplus buoyancy of over two\r\ntons, carried a crew of 18 men, and had an estimated range of action\r\nof eighteen hundred miles. When drawn from her shed in the autumn of\r\n1907, her great buoyant hull resting lightly on the water supported by\r\nher two floating cars, she had all the appearance of a royal passenger\r\nexpress ready for important service. In general features the vessel\r\nwas like her three predecessors, but in the center of the keel, with\r\ntransparent floors and windowed sides, was a special stateroom designed\r\nfor passengers only. This seemed very suggestive, if not prophetic,\r\nof the future trend of aërial navigation. Moreover, the mechanism of\r\npropulsion and control were increased in power and effectiveness.\r\nIn each boat-like car was a 110-horse-power Daimler benzine engine,\r\nactuating a pair of three-blade propellers about 15 feet in diameter.\r\nA large vertical rudder, mounted on the extreme end of the stern, and\r\nsupplemented by a pair of smaller vertical rudders at either side of\r\nthe stern, served to steer the vessel right and left. For steering\r\nup and down, as also for exerting a direct lift up or down, four\r\nsuperposed planes like a Venetian blind were placed at either side of\r\nthe hull fore and aft, at about the same level as the propellers. In\r\naddition the hull was provided, like a feathered arrow, with fixed\r\nfin-like planes at the stern, both vertical and horizontal, for\r\nsecuring steadiness of flight.\r\n\r\nSeveral trials of this leviathan were made preliminary to her official\r\ngovernment test which, if satisfactory, assured her purchase by the\r\nGerman government for $500,000. At the builder’s suggestion this test\r\nshould include a voyage of 24 hours duration, a safe descent on land or\r\nwater, an ascent to 4,000 feet, and the fulfillment of various secret\r\nrequirements. In the autumn of 1907 a successful voyage of eight hours\r\nwas easily accomplished. In the early part of the next summer, 1908, a\r\nseries of voyages were made which aroused intense interest throughout\r\nthe civilized world. On June 13th the great ship, starting from her\r\nharbor at Friedrichshafen, sailed over the Alps to Lucerne, steering\r\nin among the mountains; here buffeted by eddies, and cross currents,\r\nthere stemming such stiff head winds that her shadow could hardly\r\ncreep forward over the ground, again driving through a dark lowering\r\nhailstorm which pelted with ominous thunder on her resounding hull; but\r\nat length reaching Lucerne safely, then returning in triumph to her\r\nharbor at Friedrichshafen. For twelve hours the stanch vessel endured\r\nthe elements, by no means hospitable, and in that period voyaged 270\r\nmiles at an average speed of 22 miles an hour. It was a record journey\r\nand a triumph in the art.\r\n\r\nThe following picturesque account of a flight in Count von Zeppelin’s\r\ngigantic air ship, written by Emil Sandt, appeared in the _Scientific\r\nAmerican Supplement_ of August 15, 1908:\r\n\r\n  “Early in the morning Professor Hergesell, Freiherr von\r\n  Bassus, Dr. Stalberg, Herr Uhland, and myself set out in\r\n  Count Zeppelin’s launch for the shed in which the great air\r\n  ship is housed. When we arrived everything was in readiness\r\n  for us. Count Zeppelin is proud of the fact that his colossal\r\n  craft can be drawn in and out of the shed with very little\r\n  help. In seven minutes the huge gas bag had emerged, and a\r\n  few minutes later we were floating up to the sky. I took my\r\n  station in the central car or cabin, a comfortable room flooded\r\n  with the yellow light that filters through the translucent\r\n  balloon fabric of which the walls, the floor and the ceiling\r\n  are constituted. Comfortable seats suspended from fine chains\r\n  provide a seating capacity for a dozen passengers.\r\n\r\n  “For a great portion of their length the walls are provided\r\n  with celluloid panes. The floor is also transparent wherever\r\n  it is not used as a footway. Seated comfortably in the central\r\n  car, I could look down through my knees and see the green\r\n  earth, water, people, cities and castles far below. I could\r\n  also see birds circling around and fluttering anxiously,\r\n  evidently frightened by the strange giant of the air.\r\n\r\n  “We crossed over to the Ueberlinger See, traversed the\r\n  intermediate neck of land, and turned into the valley of the\r\n  Rhine at Konstanz. Here I left the central car and walked\r\n  toward the rear car along the keelway, which is flanked with\r\n  balloon cloth, and which is closed at the end of the keelway\r\n  by a celluloid door. I opened the door and stepped out on the\r\n  narrow aluminum gangway, which runs down sharply to the rear\r\n  car. The gangway has no protecting handrail. It is merely\r\n  ribbed to give a better foothold. That apparently flimsy\r\n  structure bridges a chasm of twenty feet between the end of the\r\n  keelway and the car. From below, the passage from the keelway\r\n  and the car must seem perilous indeed, but up in the air ship\r\n  itself no fear is felt. I stood on this narrow bridge and gazed\r\n  on the landscape. To the north I could see the Hohendtwiel.\r\n  Behind us lay the Swabian See glistening in the morning’s sun.\r\n  In the southeast I saw Thurgau wrapped in violet light. On the\r\n  horizon the lofty peak of the Saentis rose broad and jagged,\r\n  capped with ice and snow. Below us writhed the Rhine. I looked\r\n  across at the propellers. Count von Zeppelin had signaled full\r\n  speed ahead. The giant air ship trembled. The propellers seemed\r\n  like disks, revolving with furious speed and yet as transparent\r\n  as a locust’s wings. They gave out a note like that of a deep\r\n  organ, so loud that the human voice, even when lifted to a\r\n  shriek, could hardly be heard.\r\n\r\n  “I walked down to the rear car to obtain a better view. Here\r\n  the gigantic craft could be seen in a wonderful perspective.\r\n  The sensation was strange. The giant ship obediently sank and\r\n  rose. Obediently moved to the right or to the left, slavishly\r\n  following the slightest pressure of the human hand. Sometimes\r\n  its angle was such that the entire fabric seemed inclined like\r\n  a kite. At times the forward car lay below us; at times we had\r\n  to look up at it.\r\n\r\n  “As we neared the splendid falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen,\r\n  the Count brought the air ship down, in order to ascertain\r\n  whether the eddies occasioned by the waterfall would have any\r\n  effect.\r\n\r\n  “We turned into the Reusstal, but were buffeted by the wind\r\n  all the way up the valley. To the south the sharp jutting\r\n  peak of Mount Pilatus hove in sight. Soon Lucerne appeared, a\r\n  jewel among cities. The lake itself shimmered brightly where\r\n  it was struck by the sun; its darker portions lay like an\r\n  emerald, held in a setting of heliotrope. It was like a melody\r\n  in colors. Below us in Lucerne itself there was a hubbub and\r\n  a great jubilation. The streets were crowded with gayly clad\r\n  people. The roads were a-swarm. Zeppelin guided his air ship\r\n  down, and allowed it to glide full speed over the city at the\r\n  height of a church steeple.\r\n\r\n  “We traveled over the Vierwaldstaetter See, and crossed to\r\n  Knessnacht, to Zug Lake, and up northward to Zug itself. Then\r\n  came the most difficult task which Professor Hergesell had\r\n  assigned to the air ship. The craft was to carry us straight\r\n  across to Lake Zurich, through a narrow pass where it would be\r\n  caught in a veritable cyclone. The motors groaned and rattled.\r\n  The propellers howled a deep groaning song. The air ship did\r\n  all that it could. The wind was dead against us, traveling\r\n  with a velocity of nearly thirty-one miles an hour. The Count\r\n  could easily have arisen and escaped the fury of the blast,\r\n  but it was his purpose not to avoid obstacles, but to court\r\n  them. Whenever the great air ship showed signs of swerving, it\r\n  was brought back to its course. Far below us in the valley the\r\n  sharply marked shadow of the air ship, crawling slowly from\r\n  tree to tree, showed us how hard it was struggling. There were\r\n  minutes when it seemed as if we stood stock still, despite the\r\n  infernal music of the propellers. Gradually the nose of the\r\n  craft was thrust forward; once more the air ship mastered the\r\n  winds. We had forced our way through the pass, and were dashing\r\n  on at full speed. The vast shadow below us traveled with the\r\n  velocity of a bird over the mountain, valleys, cliffs and rocky\r\n  points, over railway embankments and road, over water and land.”\r\n\r\nTwo attempts were made in July, 1908, to complete the government test;\r\nbut they proved abortive, and in the second one the hull was damaged by\r\nthe wind pushing it sidewise against the shed, as it was being towed\r\nout by motor boat. This accident caused a delay of two weeks, much\r\nto the disappointment of the expectant populace. As a consequence\r\nZeppelin resolved to begin the next attempt unheralded. He had the\r\nrepairs made quickly and all was ready early in August.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, August 4th, at six forty-five in the morning, the great\r\ntwenty-four hour test for the government began, without previous\r\nannouncement, but with fairest prospect of success. Sailing from\r\nFriedrichshafen, Zeppelin purposed to follow the Rhine as far down\r\nas Mayence, then return in a direct line to his starting point. All\r\nwent splendidly at first. He passed Constance at seven o’clock in\r\nthe morning, Basle at nine-thirty, Strassburg about noon, then with\r\nslower speed passed Mannheim at two-fifty and Darmstadt at four-thirty.\r\nAt about six o’clock a descent was made at Oppenheim, eleven and a\r\nquarter hours after starting. The air ship had voyaged 270 miles at the\r\naverage speed of 22 miles an hour. A wonderful demonstration it was\r\nfor the inhabitants of that historic valley, and a glorious tour for\r\nthe brave old sailor and his crew. Resuming the voyage, Mayence, the\r\nturning point, was reached at eleven o’clock at night, and the vessel\r\nwas headed for home. But now the engines, being overworked, could\r\nnot maintain the usual speed, which therefore was lowered to twelve\r\nmiles an hour. Next morning at eight o’clock, after Stuttgart had been\r\npassed, a descent had to be made at the village of Echterdingen, to\r\nadjust and overhaul the machinery. Ninety-five miles of the return had\r\nbeen made in nine hours.\r\n\r\nIt was most unfortunate that a landing had to be made without a harbor,\r\nparticularly as a gale was in pursuit of the vessel. Ere long she was\r\ntorn from her moorings by a squall, carried into the air, and set on\r\nfire, probably by an electric discharge. Immediately the great hull was\r\nenveloped in flame and completely destroyed, leaving a tangled network\r\nof distorted framing. It was a dismal termination to the greatest motor\r\nballoon voyage in the world’s history up to that date; for the vessel\r\nhad been in the air continuously for twenty and three-fourths hours and\r\nhad traveled 378 miles.\r\n\r\nThe hardy and venerable hero of so many voyages and long continued\r\nexperiments quite broke down at the sight of his grandest vessel in\r\nruin. But an unlooked for and a sudden turn of events brought him the\r\ngreatest triumph in his darkest hour. While the world expressed its\r\ngrief and sympathy his loyal countrymen hastened to his relief in an\r\nadmirable burst of enthusiasm. Within twenty-four hours the government\r\nhad made him a grant of $125,000, and subscriptions offered in all\r\nparts of Germany brought the sum to over $500,000. By October, 1908,\r\nthe total gift amounted to $1,500,000, which was paid to the Zeppelin\r\nAir Ship Company, formed for developing and building air ships on a\r\nlarge scale. A tract of 300 acres was secured at Friedrichshafen for\r\nan air ship factory. Here was erected the necessary shops, hydrogen\r\nplant, balloon harbor, and everything necessary to enable the company\r\nto construct several mammoth air ships each year. To these new grounds\r\nthe Count’s former interests were gradually conveyed, while his old\r\nstation, with its air ship dock on Lake Constance, was converted into a\r\nmilitary post by the German government.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of _Zeppelin IV_, its predecessor, the Count’s\r\nthird air ship, was again prepared for service and for new triumphs.\r\nHer hull was lengthened by the addition of a cylindrical section having\r\nthe length of one compartment, or about 26 feet. This alteration gave\r\na considerable increase of net buoyancy with but slight increase of\r\nresistance. The dimensions now were: length 446 feet, diameter 38\r\nfeet, volume 423,768 cubic feet. The gas was contained in sixteen\r\nsacs, twelve in the cylindrical part and two at each end. The ship\r\nwas propelled by two 85-horse-power engines, supplied with sufficient\r\ngasoline for a forty-one hour voyage at 25 miles per hour. The loss of\r\ngas by leakage was less by weight than the loss of fuel. The famous old\r\ncruiser, thus remodeled, was operated in the autumn of 1908 with her\r\nusual precision and grace; thus winning new distinction and renown. On\r\none occasion she had as passengers the Crown Prince and the Kaiser’s\r\nbrother, Prince Henry. The Emperor himself witnessed the demonstration,\r\nand decorated the Count, referring to him as “the greatest German of\r\nthe century.” Soon afterward the ship was taken over by the government\r\nand assigned to the Prussian Battalion of Aëronauts, being christened\r\n_Zeppelin I_, since it was the first vessel of the kind taken into the\r\nmilitary service.\r\n\r\nBeginning with March 9, 1909, the military _Zeppelin I_ was kept in\r\nactive operation by the officers, and subjected to a wide variety of\r\ntests day by day. She was driven through rain and snowstorms, at all\r\nelevations up to a mile; she was anchored over land and over water,\r\nsometimes exposed for hours to a gale; she was steered in and out of\r\nher shed without the aid of her floating raft; she was sent on long\r\ntrips, landed in the open country, by day and by night, and returned to\r\nharbor in safety. On one occasion she carried twenty-six passengers for\r\nover an hour and a half; again she made an endurance flight of thirteen\r\nhours. These maneuvers exhibited for the first time many capabilities\r\nof the ship, which all along had been stoutly affirmed by the inventor,\r\nbut questioned by his critics.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1909, at four o’clock in the morning, the renowned\r\n_Zeppelin I_, with the Count as helmsman, started through the rain\r\nand wind on a voyage from Friedrichshafen to Munich, a hundred miles\r\ndistant. The ship followed the railway as far as Ulm, guided by the\r\nstation lights, which were kept burning all night to mark the route. As\r\nshe approached Munich, at the appointed hour of nine next morning, her\r\napproach was announced from afar by the droning of her machinery and\r\npropellers, whereupon she was welcomed by loud music from many bands\r\nand the joyous ringing of all the bells in the city. The Prince Regent\r\nof Bavaria and a great throng of applauding citizens awaited her at the\r\nTeresenhohe park. Presently the swift cruiser approached, sailing over\r\nthe steeple tops like a monstrous arrow. She halted before the Regent\r\nand dipped her bow three times, in graceful salute. Then she circled\r\nwidely over the city, intending to land at the Oberwiesenfeld Parade\r\nGrounds, where part of the garrison troops were drawn up to receive\r\nher. But now, while so near the goal, she found it difficult to stem\r\nthe increasing gale, and unsafe to land; so, with her bow pointed to\r\nthe city, and propellers humming furiously, she gradually yielded to\r\nthe storm, and drifted slowly backward toward the northeast.\r\n\r\nThe crucial hour had come for this stanch vessel and her audacious\r\ncaptain. They wrestled with the storm bravely and obstinately, but\r\nwere beaten back steadily, with no port in view. The Count determined\r\nto weather the gale till it should spend its fury. He coolly sent an\r\naërogram to Munich, saying that all was well and that he might reach\r\nthe city late in the day. Observing a suitable place to land, near\r\nthe village of Loiching, he pointed the prow of his ship downward,\r\napproached the earth and cast anchor. As the front car touched the\r\nground it was grasped by the willing hands of thronging peasants and\r\nvillagers. Presently the ship was taken in charge by a military\r\nrelief party which the Count had hailed on the way, at Guendelkoven,\r\nand which had hastened to his aid in automobiles. Fifty soldiers, in\r\nregular shifts, that night held the bow of the vessel by a short leash.\r\nThe anchor was firmly fastened, and additional ropes secured the bow\r\nto an unwheeled wagon loaded with stones. Thus all night long that\r\nmighty hull swayed to and fro in the passing storm, securely as a ship\r\nanchored at sea.\r\n\r\nPLATE XI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEPPELIN DIRIGIBLE RESTING ON THE WATER.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEPPELIN DIRIGIBLE OVER ZÜRICH.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nNext morning the vessel was well replenished and headed for home, by\r\nway of Munich. The return was easy, for the wind had nearly reversed\r\nits course. Sailing at 32 miles an hour, with a quartering current,\r\nthe stormbeaten ship soon reached Munich, where she was hailed with\r\nboundless enthusiasm. The Prince Regent entertained the Count during\r\nhis sojourn of three hours, and decorated him with a gold medal. The\r\nship then sailed for Friedrichshafen, with the full speed of the wind\r\nand of her propellers, at one time attaining 68 miles an hour. At\r\nnightfall she landed gently on the lake near Manzell, having weathered\r\nthat tempestuous voyage without serious mishap.\r\n\r\nThis was a splendid proof of her stanchness; but a few days later\r\nshe was put through other tests quite as severe, one being a night\r\nvoyage of thirteen and a third hours, after a day of busy maneuvering.\r\nFollowing this came her still longer voyage, to Metz, where she was\r\nstationed as a frontier war vessel, and one of a considerable fleet\r\ncontemplated by the German government.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the energetic Count had started his fifth vessel, or\r\nmilitary _Zeppelin II_, which now was nearing completion at the works\r\nof the Zeppelin Air Ship Construction Company. Her hull measured 446\r\nfeet in length, had a diameter of 42½ feet, and a volume of over\r\nhalf a million cubic feet. It also had a ladder running through one\r\nof the compartments to a platform on its top. Her motors of 220 horse\r\npower were taken uninjured from the wreck of the old _Zeppelin IV_ at\r\nEchterdingen.\r\n\r\nWithout previous notice this new air ship set forth in a rain on the\r\nevening of May 29, 1909, headed toward Berlin, having on board the\r\nCount and seven other men. The purpose of the voyage was merely to\r\nexercise the ship; not to reach any definite goal; but by mistake she\r\nwas reported on her way to Berlin, so that the Kaiser and his retinue\r\nwaited some hours in vain to receive her. She voyaged bravely past\r\nNuremberg and Leipsic to Bitterfeld, within 85 miles of the capital;\r\nthen turned for home, the Count being unaware of the hopes he was\r\ndisappointing. She returned successfully past Weimar and Stuttgart,\r\nthen, near Goeppingen, descended on an open plain to take on gasoline\r\nfrom a neighboring petroleum refinery. As they were nearing the ground\r\nin a heavy rain, Count Zeppelin, who was acting as pilot, suddenly\r\nbeheld, just before them, a half dead pear tree, with gaunt bare limbs.\r\nHe gave a sharp order to starboard the helm; but his aëronaut, worn by\r\ntoo long service, thrust the helm to port, and the ship, impelled by a\r\nsudden gust, plunged head on against the tree. Her prow was wrecked,\r\nthe frame and envelope being wrenched and torn for a distance of 100\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe disaster seemed complete, but the dauntless Count was equal to the\r\nemergency. Twenty workmen were summoned from Friedrichshafen, sixty\r\nmiles away, and sped to the rescue in automobiles. Electric wires from\r\na nearby plant were stretched to furnish light for night repairs. The\r\ngrounds were guarded by police and troops. The hull was detached from\r\nthe tree; furnished with a temporary prow of young firs covered with\r\nballoon cloth; relieved of the forward motors and other impedimenta;\r\nfurnished with fresh supplies; and, in exactly 28 hours from the\r\nmishap, was ready for the homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nSlowly the crippled air ship sailed for Friedrichshafen, followed by\r\nthe white-haired inventor in an automobile, unmoved and triumphant.\r\nA mighty shout ascended from the immense crowd of witnesses who had\r\nassembled from many quarters. All Germany was elated and jubilant. The\r\ngreat voyage and the prompt recovery from apparent disaster were a\r\ntriumph of the whole people, for they had helped their hero to build\r\nthis ship, and now participated in his victory over the spite of\r\nfortune and the elements. The Emperor telegraphed his congratulations,\r\naffirming his renewed confidence in the rigid system. Without further\r\ndifficulty the vessel reached her port at an easy gait of ten miles an\r\nhour, thus completing a memorable voyage of seven hundred miles—one of\r\nthe most glorious in the history of aëronautics.\r\n\r\nIf the citizens of Berlin were disappointed on this occasion,\r\nthey had not long to wait for an aërial visit from the wizard of\r\nFriedrichshafen. On August 27th, at 4.45 A.M., his crew of five men\r\nsailed for Berlin via Nuremberg and Leipsic in his sixth air ship,\r\nhis latest and largest, hurriedly finished for the Berlin voyage.\r\nIt cubed 533,000 feet, and was driven by two Daimler engines of 150\r\nnominal horse power each. In the afternoon they reached Nuremberg,\r\ncircled over the city and landed for the night. Starting at 2.15 next\r\nmorning they battled their way toward Leipsic against a strong wind,\r\nand at 6.45 P.M. landed for the night at Bitterfeld, where they arrived\r\nwith a broken propeller. Here Count Zeppelin joined them. The next\r\nmorning, after a good night’s rest and some repairs, they started at\r\nhalf past seven, in a dense fog, which, however, soon cleared. Finally\r\nthey arrived at Berlin at half past twelve o’clock, as the people were\r\nreturning from church. They circled over the city, to the delight of\r\nthe multitude of spectators who thronged the house tops, parks, and\r\nthoroughfares, finally reaching the parade ground at Tegel. Here,\r\nafter saluting the Emperor, the happy navigator maneuvered before the\r\nimperial tribune, greeted by the thunderous Hoch! Hoch! of a hundred\r\nthousand throats, and the ringing of all the church bells of the\r\nnation’s capital. The venerable Count was graciously received by the\r\nEmperor and members of the royal family. After spending the day at\r\nBerlin, the crew sailed for Friedrichshafen, about midnight, where,\r\nafter various accidents and delays, they arrived in safety on September\r\n6th.\r\n\r\nIn some respects this was Von Zeppelin’s crowning voyage of the year,\r\nthough effected with a hurriedly finished vessel, not yet thoroughly\r\nadjusted. In mechanical execution this journey was equaled on many\r\nother occasions; for those great air ships were kept in active service\r\nand were everywhere hailed with enthusiasm. Both the Emperor and his\r\npeople were proud to number those grand cruisers among the nation’s\r\naërial warships. With general commendation, therefore, was received\r\nthe announcement that four large _Zeppelins_ were ordered for the use\r\nof the German navy. And not surprising was the announcement that other\r\ninventors were at work on designs for dirigibles of the rigid type.\r\nThe projects of these new rivals, who began to appear in 1909, are set\r\nforth in the following account:[17]\r\n\r\n  “Count Zeppelin, who proved that air ships have a practical\r\n  future, is no longer undisputed ‘king of the air.’ His rivals\r\n  have taken his pattern, and improved it until soon air ships\r\n  will be able to keep afloat for many days and in that case to\r\n  cross oceans. A type of this modern ship is the first Schütte\r\n  leviathan of wood and steel bracing, now nearly finished at\r\n  Mannheim. It is expected to lift its twenty-four and one-fifth\r\n  tons one and a quarter miles, because its beam is sixty feet\r\n  as compared with the forty-four feet of the _Zeppelin II_.\r\n  The car is one hundred and thirty feet long, with a cabin to\r\n  accommodate thirty passengers. The new ship displaces nineteen\r\n  thousand cubic meters, as against fifteen thousand in the\r\n  _Zeppelin III_. It is expected to carry a cargo of five to six\r\n  tons supported by ten spherical sustaining chambers, and eight\r\n  ring-shape reservoir chambers connected by a secret apparatus.\r\n  These eight reservoirs automatically receive all expanding gas\r\n  that escapes from the sustaining chambers, thus conserving the\r\n  entire supporting power. Four motors of combined five hundred\r\n  and forty horse power will drive the propellers. Expert opinion\r\n  predicts a speed of thirty-seven to forty-three miles an hour,\r\n  three miles faster than the _Gross III_, at this writing the\r\n  fastest air ship in the world. The whole enterprise is backed\r\n  by Mr. Lanz, a rich manufacturer, who is president of the\r\n  German Air-Navy League. A wooden-braced ship of equal equipment\r\n  and size, designed by the Engineer Rettich, is well under way.\r\n\r\n  “Another rival of the _Zeppelin_, so far only projected, has\r\n  been designed by the Engineers Radinger and Wagner, and is\r\n  intended to be an advance in endurance. It should float for\r\n  fifty days without replenishing gas. It is planned to have a\r\n  rigid hull of hollow paper tubes and steel bracing and to be\r\n  thirty per cent lighter than a _Zeppelin_ built of aluminum,\r\n  in any equal size. Drum-shape compartments are to hold the\r\n  sustaining hydrogen, none of which is to be lost through\r\n  expansion by the sun, as any surplus will be compressed by\r\n  automatic pumps into the hollow tubes.[18] Having six thousand\r\n  meters less displacement than the _Zeppelin III_, it will carry\r\n  a reserve of seven hundred cubic meters of gas. Thirty-two\r\n  per cent of its weight-carrying capacity will be given up to\r\n  passengers, fuel, and baggage. Engines of two hundred and\r\n  forty-two combined horse power are expected to develop a speed\r\n  of forty to fifty miles an hour. Larger craft of the same type\r\n  would, of course, carry much heavier cargoes and have higher\r\n  speed. This type of ship, soon to be placed in the construction\r\n  cradle, is expected to cross the ocean easily with fifteen\r\n  passengers.”\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the lively growth of these great ships was the\r\nformation of the German aërial transportation company, with a capital\r\nstock of $750,000, reported in _l’Aérophile_ for December, 1909. A line\r\nof large _Zeppelins_ was to connect Baden-Baden, Mannheim, Munich,\r\nLeipsic, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Berlin, Dresden, Essen and Frankfort.\r\nThe first two auto balloons of this line were to be the _Zeppelin\r\nIV_ and _Zeppelin V_, to be put in commission in the spring of 1910.\r\nThe _Zeppelin IV_ was to cube 706,000 cubic feet, and carry twenty\r\npassengers in three cars, each containing a motor. The _Zeppelin V_ was\r\nto be constructed of a remarkably light rigid alloy “electrometal,”\r\nand was to carry at least thirty passengers. This enterprise certainly\r\nformed an appropriate termination to the first decade of practical auto\r\nballooning.\r\n\r\nThe projected passenger line of the German Air Ship Society was\r\ninaugurated the following summer with serene audacity and fairy-like\r\nmagnificence. The first ship employed, _Zeppelin VII_, was a huge\r\nvessel of unusual power, speed and elegance of appointment. She was\r\n485 feet long by 46 in diameter, cubed 690,000 feet, and carried three\r\nengines totaling 420 horse power and competent to drive her 35 miles\r\nper hour. Midway beneath her hull and rigidly joined to it, was a\r\npassenger car thirty-five feet long, having a vestibule at one end, a\r\nlavatory at the other, and five compartments between them, with seats\r\nfor twenty persons. Beyond the ends of the car were open decks leading\r\nto the boats fore and aft containing the machinery.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock on the morning of June 22, 1910, with Count Zeppelin\r\nin charge, and a dozen passengers aboard, this majestic auto balloon\r\nsailed from Friedrichshafen up the Rhine Valley for Düsseldorf, three\r\nhundred miles, and after a prosperous voyage of nine hours, made an\r\neasy landing. Next morning at eight thirty she voyaged from Düsseldorf\r\nto Dortmund, thirty-seven miles north, sailing at a general height of\r\none thousand feet, over some of the finest industrial parts of Germany.\r\nThen she returned to Düsseldorf with her delighted passengers who were\r\nall enthusiasm for the new mode of travel so auspiciously begun. Of the\r\nthirty-two persons aboard, the majority were regular public passengers\r\nwho had paid fifty dollars each for the trip, several of them tourists\r\nfrom various countries, and ten of them women.\r\n\r\nThe maiden voyage of this first air liner was a marvel and dream\r\nof delight to the fortunate few traveling in such celestial style.\r\nThe comforts and splendors of the service quite surpassed their\r\nexpectations. Seated in that fairy car of aluminum framing lined with\r\nmahogany and rosewood inlaid with pearl, they looked from spacious\r\nwindows over the beautiful German landscape gliding beneath them, and\r\nenjoyed visions fit for itinerating gods. Along the shining waters of\r\nthe Rhine, and over its castellated crags, and among its rolling hills\r\nterraced with luxuriant vineyards, now lapped in the glory of summer,\r\nand above stately cities murmuring with multitudinous life, they sailed\r\nin serenest comfort and security, marveling at their own strange\r\ncareer through the sky, and equally regarded with wonder by all the\r\ninhabitants below, not to say written and read about by millions in all\r\nparts of the civilized world. The delights of land and sea travel were\r\nhappily mingled, without their inconvenience. Neither dust nor smoke\r\nwas here, nor rattle of iron rails, nor lurching and rolling from heavy\r\nseas. Quite otherwise. The senses were charmed with the fanning of\r\nfragrant winds forever and uniformly blowing, with the melodious drone\r\nof the swift propeller wheels, with the green glories of the earth and\r\npurple splendors of the sky. When the tourist was sated with these he\r\ncould turn to his book; when tired of his chair he could stroll to and\r\nfro in the car on a soft carpet, or along the trellised deck beyond;\r\nwhen his appetite called, he could answer with the choicest food and\r\nwine; for every convenience of an ample buffet was available. It was\r\nall so enchanting if only practical.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these trials the company announced, and hoped to make,\r\nvoyages at frequent intervals. But in this they promptly encountered\r\ndifficulties. On June 28th the _Deutschland_ started from Düsseldorf on\r\na four-hour cruise, with nearly a score of passengers, mostly newspaper\r\nrepresentatives. But she remained in the air longer than intended.\r\nPassing Solingen she tried to reach Eberfeld, but ineffectually; nor\r\ncould she find a landing place. Toward five o’clock she was caught in\r\na great rising wind and carried one mile aloft like a passive balloon\r\nin a vortex or thunderhead. Here much gas was lost by expansion, and\r\npresently, as the ship emerged from a snow cloud in the upper vortex,\r\nwith cooled gas and hull laden with precipitation, she descended at a\r\nterrible velocity. With crippled motive power, the vessel could not be\r\nsupported dynamically by the impact of the air against her sustaining\r\nplanes and against her canted hull, for lack of forward speed. At\r\nlength with a terrific crash she struck upon the forest of Teutoberg,\r\n80 miles from Dusseldorf, a great tree trunk piercing the rear boat and\r\nprojecting among the terrified crew. Here the vessel lodged with her\r\nstern and controlling gear badly wrecked, and here she was abandoned\r\nby the passengers, with her huge hull resting on the branches forty\r\nfeet from earth. Ere long she was retrieved by a company of infantry\r\nwho sawed down the trees, dismantled the ship, and returned the parts\r\non railway trucks to Friedrichshafen, to be used in building another\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThus in both civil and military aëronautics the pioneers had to endure\r\nmany losses and grievous hardships; but the direst disasters often mark\r\nthe way to the greatest victories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                          GROWTH OF AVIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         MODEL FLYING MACHINES\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial man has admired the aërial evolutions of\r\nwing-gifted creatures, and aspired to imitate them. But which\r\nevolutions should he attempt first? Which if any are practicable for\r\nthe ponderous lord of creation? The question is still pertinent.\r\n\r\nNature in her bounty bewilders us with wondrous models. All about\r\nand overhead, with exquisite art, they challenge us to float or fly.\r\nBefore the flower-bell drifts the ruby-throat, his long bill in the\r\nhoney-hearted bloom; now bulletlike he leaps through boundless space.\r\nWhy not adopt that style of locomotion? Call your rainbow equipage to\r\nthe door, and take the family forth in purple state, to the music of\r\nmelodious wheels.\r\n\r\nIf the humming bird will not serve, look above you. There rides\r\nthe dark-winged master of aërial motion, throned like a god on the\r\nimpetuous wind. Mark his majestic sweep as all day long, with unbeating\r\npinion, he scours the wide plain and rugged regions of the hills,\r\nunwearied, reposeful, deliberate; now skimming the fragrant forest, or\r\nmeadow; now scaling the precipice, or swinging above the abyss; now\r\nsoaring cloudward beyond the range of human vision. There is a model\r\nfor the ambitious and the brave!\r\n\r\nOr turn to mid ocean when the hurricane, shearing the tops of the\r\narched billows, scatters them in foam and spray over the watery chaos,\r\nand the big ship strains in the storm. See the long-winged albatross,\r\nwhite vision of joy in the darkness, careering all playfully round\r\nthe imperiled vessel, and above the monstrous waves; wheeling in glad\r\ncurves, frolicking in the face of the tempest, riding, without toil or\r\ntrepidation, the rudest[19] winds a thousand miles over the sea. What a\r\njocund pace for man!\r\n\r\nOf all the charming modes of flight now possible to us it is certain\r\nthat our ancestors could copy but one with any hope of success. Minus\r\nmotive power they could not imitate the direct flight of the homing\r\npigeon, much less the mid-air pause of the bumblebee floating round a\r\ndaisy. Hence there remained to them only passive flight on nonvibrant\r\nwings. The gliding of vultures, of gulls, and of certain quadrupeds and\r\nfishes, they could imitate with profit; but when they essayed power\r\nflight they invariably and egregiously failed.\r\n\r\nThe art of aviation presents two main groups of fliers. The first\r\ncomprises the various man kites, parachutes, gliding machines, soaring\r\nmachines. These may be called passive flyers, because they carry no\r\nmotive power, but ride passively on the air by the force of gravity or\r\na towline.\r\n\r\nThe second group comprises the bird-like flap-wing machines, called\r\northopters by technical people; the screw-lift flyers, called\r\nhelicopters; the aëroplanes, also called monoplanes, biplanes,\r\ntriplanes, according to the number of superposed main lifting surfaces;\r\nand lastly the gyroplanes, whose sustaining surfaces may turn over and\r\nover, like a falling lath, or whirl round and round, like a boomerang.\r\nThese all may be called dynamic, or power, flyers. The technical\r\nnames, however, are not so important, as they are numerous; for the\r\nwhole aëronautic nomenclature is in a formative, not to say chaotic,\r\nstate. We may, therefore, like Adam, name the creatures as they pass\r\nbefore us for review or discussion.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the crude essays at human flight, recorded in the early\r\nliterature and history of many peoples, we may notice first the well\r\nauthenticated sketches of Leonardo da Vinci. His fertile mind conceived\r\nthree distinct devices for carrying a man in the air. But he and his\r\nsuccessors for nearly four centuries could do little more than invent.\r\nFor lack of motive power they could not navigate dynamic flyers,\r\nhowever ingeniously contrived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—DA VINCI’S HELICOPTER.]\r\n\r\nDa Vinci’s first design, as shown in Fig. 26, provides the operator\r\nwith two wings to be actuated by the power of both arms and legs,\r\nthrough the agency of very ingenious harness. With this device\r\nan acrobat could fly forward and downward, to the delectation of\r\na multitude; but he would have to be caught on something soft to\r\nescape injury. Since Leonardo’s day the experiment has been tried\r\noccasionally, with varied results, sometimes grotesque, sometimes\r\ntragic. He doubtless realized the impracticability of an orthopter\r\nactuated by human muscle, and yet he has had many followers. The\r\northopter is still a favorite device cultivated by a few persons who\r\npropose to work its wings by means of a gasoline motor. Doubtless the\r\nfeat is physically possible, and may be accomplished in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—DA VINCI’S PARACHUTE.]\r\n\r\nDa Vinci’s second flyer was a helicopter, as shown in Fig. 26. An\r\naërial screw 96 feet in diameter was to be turned by a strong and\r\nnimble artist who might, by prodigious effort, lift himself for a short\r\ntime. Though various small paper screws were made to ascend in the air,\r\nthe larger enterprise was never seriously undertaken. Many subsequent\r\ninventors developed the same project; but the fellow turning the screw\r\nalways found it dreadful toil and a hopelessly futile task. Of late\r\nthe man-driven helicopter has been abandoned, but the motor-driven one\r\nis very much cultivated. Scores of inventors in recent years, aided by\r\nlight motors, have been trying to screw boldly skyward, and some have\r\nsucceeded in rising on a helicopter carrying one man.\r\n\r\nDa Vinci’s third scheme for human flight, as shown in Fig. 27, was a\r\nframed sail on which a man could ride downward, if not upward. This\r\ndevice never fails to navigate with its confiding sailor. Sometimes\r\nhe lands in one posture, again in another; but voyage he must, with\r\nthe certainty of gravitation. Leonardo is, therefore, the father\r\nof the parachute. This, in turn, has had a varied offspring. The\r\ncommon parachute, the aërial glider, the soaring machine, or passive\r\naëroplane, that rides the wind without motive power and without loss of\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketches by the great artist were made toward the year\r\n1500, and there the science stood for nearly three centuries. Much\r\nspeculation followed, but no substantial progress. Mathematicians\r\nproved by figures the inadequacy of the human muscle to achieve human\r\nflight. Dreamers demonstrated the same by launching themselves from\r\nhigh places, and breaking their bones on the unfeeling earth, before\r\nunpitying crowds. Finally came the balloon, giving a new impetus to an\r\nembryo art.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of Da Vinci’s aëronautic ideas to be practically realized\r\nwas the parachute. The exact date of its first employment is not\r\nexactly known. In the year 1617 Fauste Veranzio published in Venice\r\na good technical description of the construction and operation of\r\nthe parachute, accompanied by a clear illustration, as shown in\r\nFig. 28. But the first authentic account of a parachute descent of\r\na human being is that given by Sebastien Lenormand. This dauntless\r\ninventor, on December 26, 1783, descended from the tower of the\r\nMontpelier Observatory, holding in either hand an umbrella sixty inches\r\nin diameter. A few days later he sent to the Academy of Lyons the\r\nfollowing description of his improved parachute, illustrated in Fig. 29:\r\n\r\n  “I make a circle 14 feet in diameter with a heavy cord; I\r\n  attach firmly all around, a cone of linen whose height is 6\r\n  feet; I double this cone with paper laid on the linen to render\r\n  it impermeable to air; or better, instead of linen, taffeta\r\n  covered with gum elastic. I place all about the cone small\r\n  cords, which are attached below to a wicker frame, and forming\r\n  with this frame an inverse truncated cone. Upon this frame I\r\n  place myself. By this means I avoid the ribs and handle of\r\n  the umbrella, which would add considerable weight. I am sure\r\n  to risk so little that I offer to make the experiment myself,\r\n  after once having tried the parachute with different weights to\r\n  make sure of its solidity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—VERANZIO’S PARACHUTE.]\r\n\r\nPrevious to Lenormand’s experiments, Blanchard, the aëronaut, had\r\ndropped small parachutes from his balloon, sometimes carrying animals,\r\nbut never a human being. For unaccountable reasons the world had to\r\nwait fourteen years longer to see a man make the new familiar parachute\r\ndescent from a balloon. On October 22, 1797, in presence of a large\r\ncrowd Jacques Garnerin ascended in a closed parachute to a height of\r\n3,000 feet, then cut loose. The people were astonished and appalled;\r\nbut they soon saw the umbrella-shaped canvas spread open and oscillate\r\nin the sky with its human freight. As it was but eight yards in\r\ndiameter, it descended rapidly and struck the ground with violence,\r\nthrowing Garnerin from his seat. He escaped with a bruised foot,\r\nmounted a horse, and returned to the starting point, where he received\r\na lively ovation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—LENORMAND’S PARACHUTE, 1784.]\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment, parachute descents became popular the world\r\nover, and have been repeated up to the present time substantially\r\nwithout change. A slight improvement in the construction was made by\r\ncutting away the top of the canvas, thus allowing the air to escape\r\nsufficiently to check the oscillations; but no radical change in\r\nthe design has come into general use. It would seem easy to have\r\ntransformed the craft into a traveling parachute gliding down the sky\r\nlike a great bird on out-stretched wings. Such a device would enable\r\nthe aëronaut to sail some miles and direct his course in the air. If\r\nfair skill had been acquired it might have hastened the advent of human\r\nflight twenty years, so far as it is practicable without the aid of\r\nthe internal combustion motor. For two decades ago Maxim produced an\r\nabundantly powerful steam engine; but could find no one to furnish him\r\na manageable glider on which to mount it. Now, indeed, such gliders are\r\navailable; but they were developed by aviators, not by balloonists, or\r\nparachutists, who should have effected that advance many years ago.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Nature has furnished a traveling parachute which\r\nseems never to have been imitated by man, though not difficult to\r\ncopy. It is a large two-winged seed, which when dropped in any poise,\r\nimmediately rights itself, and glides gracefully through the air. The\r\nseeds grow on a tree in India, bearing the name _Zanonia Macrocarpa_,\r\nand when shaken from its branches look like so many sparrows sailing\r\nearthward in wide curves. Artificial gliders of this type are easy to\r\nconstruct, and would make interesting toys. However, if man has not\r\ncopied such natural models, he has done much better, by making his\r\ngliders concave below instead of concave upward, as are the beautiful\r\nIndian seeds.\r\n\r\nAn interesting model of a traveling parachute, quite as efficient as\r\nthe gauzy-winged seed, is shown in the accompanying figure. It is a\r\nsheet of paper twenty inches long by four inches wide, having a quarter\r\ninch strip of tin folded in its forward margin, and having its rear\r\nmargin turned upward slightly, to steer the little craft from a too\r\nsteep descent. In order to improve the stability of the paper plane,\r\nits sides may be bent upward. The model when dropped in any attitude\r\nquickly rights itself, and sails down a gently sloping course, the rear\r\nmargin functioning as a rudder or tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—PAPER TRAVELING PARACHUTE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest trustworthy and scientific accounts of\r\nexperimentation with an aërial glider was given by Sir George Cayley in\r\n_Nicholson’s Journal_, in 1809 and 1810. After a careful study of the\r\nprinciples of stability, he, in 1808, constructed a glider spreading\r\n300 square feet of surface and weighing with its load 140 pounds. It\r\nhad wing surfaces slightly inclined to each other, and a tail inclined\r\nenough to determine a gentle downward course. “When any persons,” says\r\nCayley, “ran forward in it with his full speed, taking advantage of a\r\ngentle breeze in front, it would bear him up so strongly as scarcely\r\nto allow him to touch the ground, and would frequently lift him up and\r\ncarry him several yards together. It was beautiful to see this noble\r\nwhite bird sail majestically from a hill to any given point of the\r\nplain below it, with perfect steadiness and safety, according to the\r\nset of the rudder, merely by its own weight, descending in an angle of\r\nabout 18° with the horizon.”\r\n\r\nSir George Cayley made a brave start in the science of dynamic\r\nflight, marshaling to it all the mechanical resources of his day. He\r\napplied the most reliable data of fluid resistance then available. He\r\nformulated the laws of equilibrium and control of a flying machine\r\nquite as well as any of his successors for two generations. He\r\nestimated the propulsive power required to carry a man, and computed\r\nthe weight of the newly invented Bolton and Watt steam engine capable\r\nof supplying that power. He even conceived the idea of burning a gas\r\nor inflammable vapor behind a piston, thus anticipating the modern\r\naëronautical motor. But the project as a whole was too formidable at\r\nthat time for the genius of this one man, or of his generation of\r\ncolleagues. Sailing flight they could have practiced with profit to the\r\nadvancement of aviation, but power flight on a practicable scale had to\r\nawait the long evolution of the internal combustion engine.\r\n\r\nThe next great advancement in the devices and principles of aviation\r\nwas made by another Englishman, and a worthy successor to Sir George\r\nCayley. In 1842 Mr. Henson patented the aërial equipage shown in\r\nthe accompanying illustration. It was what in present-day parlance\r\nis called a monoplane, being in fact the first commercially planned\r\naëroplane known to history. As seen at a glance it consisted of a large\r\nsustaining surface rigidly trussed and driven through the air by two\r\npropellers actuated by a steam engine. It was to be guided up and down\r\nby means of a horizontal rudder, and guided to the right and left by\r\nmeans of a vertical rudder, seconded by a keel cloth; both rudders\r\nbeing at the rear of the large plane. The machine was designed to be\r\nlaunched by running down an inclined plane or track. Fuller details\r\nof this first patent aëroplane are given in the following official\r\ndescription in the South Kensington Museum of a model aëroplane\r\nconstructed by Henson and Stringfellow:\r\n\r\n  “The model consists of an extended surface, or aëroplane,\r\n  of oiled silk or canvas, stretched upon a bamboo frame made\r\n  rigid by trussing both above and below. A car is attached to\r\n  the underside of the aëroplane to contain the steam engine,\r\n  passengers, etc. It has three wheels to run freely upon when\r\n  it reaches earth. Two propellers, three feet in diameter,\r\n  are shown with their blades set at 45°. They are operated by\r\n  endless cords from the engine. Behind these is a fan-shaped\r\n  tail stretched upon a triangular frame capable of being opened\r\n  out, closed, or moved up and down by means of cords and\r\n  pulleys. By this latter arrangement ascent or descent was to be\r\n  accomplished. A rudder for steering sideways is placed under\r\n  the tail, and above the main aëroplane a sail was to be\r\n  stretched between two masts rising from the car, to assist in\r\n  maintaining the course. When in motion the front edge of the\r\n  machine was to be raised in order to obtain the required air\r\n  support. To start the model it was proposed to allow it to\r\n  run down an incline—e.g., the side of a hill, the propellers\r\n  being first set in motion. The velocity gained in the descent\r\n  was expected to sustain it in its further progress, the engine\r\n  overcoming the head resistance when in full flight. Experiments\r\n  were eventually made on the Downs near Chard, in Somerset, and\r\n  the night trials were abandoned, as the silk became saturated\r\n  from a deposit of dew. After many day trials, down wide\r\n  inclined rails, the model was found to be deficient in stable\r\n  equilibrium for open-air experiments, little puffs of wind\r\n  or ground currents being sufficient to destroy the balance.\r\n  The actual machine was never constructed, but in 1847-48 F.\r\n  Stringfellow built a model which is supposed to be the first\r\n  flying machine to perform a successful flight.”\r\n\r\nPLATE XII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENSON’S AËROPLANE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADER’S AËROPLANE.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nThe creation of Henson’s flying machine at that early period is one\r\nof the most original and fruitful achievements in the century-long\r\ndevelopment of the modern aëroplane. Barring the torsional wing-tips\r\ninvented more recently, it hardly differs in principle from the\r\nsuccessful monoplane of to-day. The same mode of propulsion, the same\r\nmode of sustention, the same mode of launching and lighting, the same\r\nmode of steering and control. What has been added since is not so much\r\noriginal invention as perfection of detail through the combined efforts\r\nof many designers. After Cayley, Henson, as nearly as any one person\r\nwas the inventor of the flying machine. He did not bring his conception\r\nto practical maturity, nor was that to be expected; but he did lay\r\ndown the broad lines which have led others to success. His ideas still\r\nfeature every practical aëroplane, and particularly every successful\r\nmonoplane. Indeed, it is now possible to construct an aëroplane from\r\nHenson’s description that will fly, even in breezy weather, with\r\na stability practically as good as that of the early Voisin and\r\nAntoinette machines before the use of the aileron or torsional wing was\r\npracticed. It is all a question of wise proportioning and sufficient\r\nmotive power.\r\n\r\nSo much for Henson’s contrivance as an abstract invention. The\r\nconcrete, full scale machine was to spread 6,000 square feet of\r\nsurface, weigh 3,000 pounds, and be propelled by a high pressure steam\r\nengine of 25 or 30 horse power. The machine was not completed on a\r\nlarge scale, and wisely so; for it was inadequately powered, and,\r\nmoreover, required many refinements of detail to make it entirely\r\npractical. These improvements had to be left to succeeding inventors\r\nwith accumulated experience and resources.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Mr. Henson began the construction of a steam-driven model,\r\nin partnership with his friend, Mr. Stringfellow, who designed the\r\nmotor for it. They experimented together for some weeks with only\r\nmeager success, but gaining valuable experience. A model of the\r\nHenson-Stringfellow machine is on exhibition at the South Kensington\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Stringfellow built a steam model aëroplane about the size of a\r\nlarge soaring bird, and weighing all together, with fuel and water, 6½\r\npounds. A special feature of this model was that its main surfaces were\r\nsloped like the wings of a bird, _slightly concave below and feathered\r\ntoward the back_; thus making it more efficient and stable in flight.\r\nWith a good head of steam, and propellers whirling, the model ran down\r\na stretched wire, leaped into the air “and darted off in as fair a\r\nflight as it was possible to make, to a distance of about 40 yards.”\r\nThus the first power-driven aëroplane to fly successfully was the\r\nlittle steam model constructed by Stringfellow in 1846.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—WENHAM’S AËROPLANE, 1866.]\r\n\r\nIn 1866, two decades after the flight of Stringfellow’s monoplane,\r\nMr. F. H. Wenham, another Englishman illustrious in the annals of\r\naëronautics, patented the multiplane; that is, an aëroplane comprising\r\ntwo or more superposed surfaces. This proved to be a valuable\r\ncontribution to the art of aviation, and continues in use at the\r\npresent time. The device furnished an increase of sustaining surface\r\nwithout enlargement of the ground plan. It moreover lends itself\r\nconveniently to a strong and simple trussing of the surfaces. Some\r\ndesigners protest that superposed surfaces blanket one another; but the\r\nadvantages just named seem amply to compensate for this objectionable\r\nfeature. If the surfaces be properly spaced, very little interference\r\nis found; moreover, any blanketing that may occur diminishes the drift\r\nas well as the lift,[20] though not necessarily in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nWenham’s aëroplane is illustrated in Fig. 31. The rider lies underneath\r\nthe multiple wings, so as to diminish the resistance to progression\r\nthrough the air. The apparatus could thus be used as an aërial toboggan\r\nfor coasting down the atmosphere. To prolong the flights two flappers\r\nactuated by a treadle were to be employed, their ends being hinged at\r\na point above the operator’s back. Though the device was patented, no\r\nvery serious efforts were made to operate it practically. Once, indeed,\r\nthe inventor took his glider to a meadow and mounted it, during a lull\r\nin the evening wind, but soon a gust caught him up, carried him some\r\ndistance from the ground and toppled him over sidewise, breaking some\r\nof the surfaces. The machine disclosed some good working principles;\r\nbut it was inadequately ruddered, and too feebly constructed, to\r\nweather the buffets of the prevailing ground currents.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRINGFELLOW’S AËROPLANE (FRONT).\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRINGFELLOW’S AËROPLANE (SIDE).\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\nAdopting the scheme of superposed surfaces then recently devised\r\nby Wenham, Mr. Stringfellow in 1868 constructed the interesting\r\nsteam-driven model shown in Plate XIII. This consists essentially of\r\nthree superposed planes, rigidly connected by rods and diagonal wires,\r\npropelled by a pair of screws actuated by a high pressure steam engine,\r\nand guided by a tail. The three planes aggregated 21 feet in length and\r\n28 square feet in surface; totaling, with the tail, 36 square feet.\r\nThe engine was rated at one third of one horse power. Its weight is\r\nnot known, but may be roughly surmised from the fact that a separate\r\nengine exhibited simultaneously by Stringfellow weighed thirteen pounds\r\nper horse power. The model was entered for competition in the London\r\nAëronautical Exhibition of 1868. In actual operation, however, it seems\r\nnot to have excelled the monoplane of 1846; but still it is of much\r\ninterest as being the prototype of the multiple-wing aëroplane now in\r\ncommon use. It seems to have been the first aëroplane having two or\r\nmore sustaining surfaces joined by rods and stayed by diagonal cords\r\nafter the manner of a Pratt truss. This historic little model was\r\npurchased by Professor Langley for the Smithsonian Institution, and\r\nis now to be seen suspended from the ceiling of the National Museum,\r\nbeside Langley’s own models and Lilienthal’s epoch-making glider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—PENAUD’S AËROPLANE TOY, 1871.]\r\n\r\nIn 1871 M. A. Penaud produced the interesting toy aëroplane shown in\r\nFig. 32. The model is propelled horizontally forward by a single screw,\r\nactuated by twisted rubber, and is fastened, as shown, to the middle of\r\na long stick or backbone. The center of mass of the machine is well to\r\nthe front, tending to plunge the model earthward like a heavy-headed\r\narrow; but this down-diving is promptly checked by the tiny rudder\r\nwhich is so inclined as to counteract the diving proclivity. That is\r\nto say the rudder dips so as to receive the aërial impact on its upper\r\nsurface; which impact increases with the speed of flight and causes\r\nthe bow to rise, until the weight before the wings just balances the\r\nimpact on the rudder at the rear. The equilibrium is thus automatic, on\r\nthe principle expounded by Sir George Cayley sixty years earlier. This\r\nquaint little bird when liberated in the Garden of the Tuileries flew\r\na distance of 131 feet in eleven seconds, much to the delight of some\r\nmembers of the French Society for Aërial Navigation. It may be added\r\nthat Penaud, who was a most promising and clever aëronautical inventor,\r\ncontemplated a twin-screw monoplane large enough to carry two men, but\r\ndied in his early manhood, before the project could be realized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—TATIN’S AËROPLANE MODEL, 1879.]\r\n\r\nIn 1879 M. Victor Tatin made some very promising tests with the model\r\nshown in Fig. 33, so promising, in fact, as to convince many that human\r\nflight was even then practicable. This little flyer was a twin-screw\r\nmonoplane mounted on wheels, and actuated by an oscillating compressed\r\nair engine, the whole machine weighing 3.85 pounds, and supported by a\r\nsilk plane measuring 16 by 75 inches. The central body of the aëroplane\r\nwas a thin steel tube three feet long by four inches in diameter\r\ncontaining the compressed air, and weighing only one pound and a half,\r\nthough strong enough to endure a pressure of twenty atmospheres. When\r\nthe model was allowed to run round a board walk 46 feet in diameter,\r\ntethered to a stake at the center, it quickly acquired a speed of 18\r\nmiles an hour, rose in the air, and flew a distance of fifty feet.\r\n\r\nA remarkable deduction from the very careful measurements made with\r\nthis machine was that it carried at the rate of 110 pounds per tow line\r\nhorse power, when flying at an angle of 8 to 10 degrees. Mr. Tatin\r\nconcluded: “These experiments seem to demonstrate that there is no\r\nimpracticability in the construction of a large apparatus for aviation,\r\nand that perhaps even now such machines could be practically used in\r\naërial navigation. Such practical experiments being necessarily very\r\ncostly, I must to my great regret, forego their undertaking, and I\r\nshall be satisfied if my own labors shall induce others to take up such\r\nan enterprise.”\r\n\r\nTatin’s faith in the practicability of a large aëroplane was later\r\nvoiced by Mr. Chanute in his valuable book, _Progress in Flying\r\nMachines_, published in 1894, but now unfortunately out of print.\r\nRecalling that Maxim had recently produced a large motor weighing\r\ncomplete only ten pounds per horse power, he says: “Aviation seems to\r\nbe practicably possible, if only the stability can be secured, and an\r\nadequate method of alighting be devised.” Since the above quoted facts\r\nand opinions were published, no competent man well informed in the\r\nscience of aviation has for one moment doubted the feasibility of human\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—HARGRAVE’S MODEL SCREW MONOPLANE, 1891.]\r\n\r\nIn 1891, twelve years after Tatin’s experiment, Lawrence Hargrave, of\r\nSydney, Australia, made a similar compressed air monoplane, with a\r\nsingle-screw propeller, but without wheels for launching and lighting.\r\nThe model, which is shown in Fig. 34, had a wing-spread of 20 square\r\nfeet, weighed about three pounds, and flew 128 feet in eight seconds.\r\nThe weight carried was at the rate of 90 pounds per horse power, a very\r\nencouraging result. Two years later he described a small steam engine\r\nwhich he had developed, weighing 10.7 pounds per horse power, and\r\ncapable of driving the model about two miles, though he did not use it\r\nfor that purpose, being engrossed with other researches.\r\n\r\nOne interesting outcome of his numerous experiments was the Hargrave\r\nKite, now more familiarly known as the box kite. A good example of\r\nhis kites is the type shown in Fig. 35. This consists of two arched\r\nbiplanes mounted tandem on a backbone, or connecting framework. The\r\nkite floats steadily, and was thought suitable for the body of a flying\r\nmachine to be driven by an engine and propeller. Thus meteorology is\r\nindebted to aëronautics for its most useful kite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—HARGRAVE’S KITE.]\r\n\r\nA very novel and interesting type of aëroplane model was tested by\r\nMr. Horatio Phillips in 1893. After careful preliminary experiments\r\nwith various forms of curved “sustainers,” or lifting surfaces, tested\r\nin a wind tunnel, to determine which were most suitable wing forms,\r\nhe finally constructed the flying apparatus shown in Plate XIV. This\r\nconsisted of a compound aëroplane composed of many superposed narrow\r\ncurved slats, the whole resembling an open Venetian blind. These\r\ncurved blades, or sustainers, measured 12 feet long, 1.5 inches wide,\r\n2 inches apart, and were held in a frame sharpened to cleave the air\r\nwith slight resistance. The entire aëroplane spread 136 square feet\r\nof lifting surface, and was mounted on a truck as shown, carrying a\r\nsteam engine and boiler, to actuate a two blade propeller 6 feet in\r\ndiameter. The whole apparatus weighed 330 pounds, to which a dead load\r\nwas usually added, and ran around a circular wooden track 628 feet in\r\ncircumference, being tethered at the center, as in Tatin’s experiment.\r\nThe apparatus readily lifted itself, when running at a speed of 28\r\nmiles an hour, and carried at the rate of 72 pounds per horse power,\r\nthe added load weighing at times nearly one fourth that of the machine\r\nitself. The ultimate purpose of the experiment was to prepare the\r\nway for a one-man aëroplane like that shown in the lower part of the\r\nfigure. This latter model actually carried a man across a field in\r\n1904, but was found defective in longitudinal balance, because perhaps\r\nof its inadequate horizontal rudder. Apparently Mr. Phillips had in\r\n1904 a machine capable of well-balanced flight, if he had made the\r\nrudders large enough, and provided a mechanism for rotating the slats\r\nat either wing end, so as to control the lateral poise, as proposed by\r\nthe present writer in 1893, for practically that same flier (see page\r\n229).\r\n\r\nPhillips’s aëroplane shows a distinct advance over its predecessors,\r\neven Wenham’s multiplane, because of the careful curving of the\r\nsustainers. Tatin’s flat wing machine had, indeed, shown a greater\r\nefficiency as a whole, but that was likely due to less proportionate\r\nbody resistance. To Phillips we owe the introduction of superposed\r\narched surfaces, now so commonly used in mechanical flight. Whether he\r\nwas wise in using so many narrow wings, instead of a few broad ones,\r\nwas a question to be answered by precise measurement.\r\n\r\nProf. S. P. Langley, like Mr. Hargrave, made numerous flying models,\r\ntrying, in turn, the power of twisted rubber, compressed air and\r\nsteam. He constructed scores of gauzy winged contrivances which\r\nflitted about like huge butterflies or birds, till their mission\r\nwas accomplished—that of illustrating a scientific principle to his\r\ninquiring mind. One by one they came into existence, enjoyed an\r\nephemeral life, and then were consigned to the aëronautical attic of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, a storehouse of quaint flying creatures.\r\nIt was a most interesting collection which well merited preservation\r\nas the “juvenile” creations of an illustrious man. But the first\r\nexperiments of Langley, like the similar ones of Hargrave, were of\r\nvalue chiefly as training to the inventor himself; they were not\r\nimportant advances in the art of aviation. Such advances were to follow\r\nthe long preliminary training.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILLIPS’ TETHERED AËROPLANE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILLIPS’ AËROPLANE.]\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1896, Dr. Langley launched the picturesque steam model,\r\nwhich, to his mind, first proved conclusively the practicability of\r\nmechanical flight. It was the crowning success, and, as he thought\r\nthen, probably the termination of his aëronautic labors. “I have\r\nbrought to a close,” says he, “the portion of the work which seemed\r\nto be peculiarly mine—the demonstration of the practicability of\r\nmechanical flight—and for the next stage, which is the commercial\r\nand practical development of the idea, it is probable that the world\r\nmay look to others. The world, indeed, will be supine if it does not\r\nrealize that a new possibility has come to it, and that the great\r\nuniversal highway overhead is now soon to be opened.”\r\n\r\nAs shown in Plate XV, Langley’s first successful steam flying machine\r\nis a tandem monoplane[21] with twin screws amidships. It measures\r\nnearly 13 feet from tip to tip of its wings, about 16 feet along its\r\nentire length, and weighs with motor and propellers 30 pounds. The\r\nboiler weighs 5 pounds, the engine 26 ounces, and the power developed\r\nwas between 1 and 1.5 horse power. The model is therefore somewhat\r\nlarger than a large condor, and very much more powerful.\r\n\r\nBeing too small to carry a pilot, it was launched over water, to\r\nobviate wreckage on landing. The machine was capable of flying several\r\nmiles continuously, but in the actual test on the Potomac River the\r\nflight was limited, in order to prevent the model passing beyond\r\nthe shore. The flyer was placed on launching ways on the top of a\r\nhouseboat, hurled rapidly forward by force of a spring, and liberated\r\nin space, with engine and propellers running at full speed. Its\r\nsubsequent behavior has been graphically described by an eyewitness,\r\nDr. Alexander Graham Bell, in the following passage, published in\r\n_Nature_, May 28, 1896:\r\n\r\n  “On the occasion referred to, the aërodrome, at a given signal,\r\n  started from a platform about 20 feet above the water, and\r\n  rose at first directly in the face of the wind, moving at all\r\n  times with remarkable steadiness, and subsequently swung around\r\n  in large curves of perhaps a hundred yards in diameter, and\r\n  continuously ascending till its steam was exhausted, when at\r\n  a lapse of about a minute and a half, and at a height which\r\n  I judged to be between 80 and 100 feet in the air, the whole\r\n  ceased turning, and the machine, deprived of the aid of its\r\n  propellers, to my surprise did not fall, but settled down so\r\n  softly and gently that it touched the water without the least\r\n  shock, and was in fact immediately ready for another trial.\r\n\r\n  “In the second trial, which followed directly, it repeated in\r\n  nearly every respect the actions of the first, except that the\r\n  direction of its course was different. It ascended again in the\r\n  face of the wind, afterward moving steadily and continually in\r\n  large curves, accompanied with a rising motion and a lateral\r\n  advance. Its motion was, in fact, so steady that I think a\r\n  glass of water on its surface would have remained unspilled.\r\n  When the steam gave out again it repeated for a second time\r\n  the experience of the first trial when the steam had ceased,\r\n  and settled gently and easily down. What height it reached at\r\n  this trial I can not say, as I was not so favorably placed as\r\n  in the first, but I had occasion to notice that this time its\r\n  course took it over a wooded promontory, and I was relieved of\r\n  some apprehension in seeing that it was already so high as to\r\n  pass the tree tops by 20 or 30 feet. It reached the water in\r\n  one minute and thirty-one seconds from the time it started, at\r\n  a measured distance of over 900 feet from the point at which it\r\n  rose.\r\n\r\nPLATE XV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANGLEY’S STEAM MODEL.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANGLEY’S GASOLENE MODEL.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANGLEY’S TWO SURFACE GASOLENE MODEL.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\n  “This, however, was by no means the length of its flight. I\r\n  estimated from the diameter of the curve described, from the\r\n  number of turns of the propellers, as given by the automatic\r\n  counter, after due allowance for slip, and from other measures,\r\n  that the actual length of flight on each occasion was slightly\r\n  over 3,000 feet. It is at least safe to say that each exceeded\r\n  half an English mile.\r\n\r\n  “From the time and distance, it will be noticed that the\r\n  velocity was between 20 and 25 miles an hour, in a course\r\n  which was constantly taking it ‘up hill.’ I may add that on a\r\n  previous occasion, I have seen a far higher velocity attained\r\n  by the same aërodrome when its course was horizontal.\r\n\r\n  “I have no desire to enter into detail further than I have\r\n  done, but I can not but add that it seems to me that no one who\r\n  was present on this interesting occasion, could have failed to\r\n  recognize that the practicability of mechanical flight had been\r\n  demonstrated.”\r\n\r\nIn passing it may be added that in 1899 this model was again flown\r\nsuccessfully, having superposed surfaces; for its inventor all along\r\nrecognized the structural advantage of the bridge trussing in biplanes.\r\nIf he preferred the monoplane, or single-tier arrangement, it was\r\nbecause the best flights were obtained with such models.\r\n\r\nMany persons now thought that Langley would do well to rest on his\r\nlaurels, leaving to others the “commercial and practical development”\r\nof his ideas. But he had caught the aëronautic fever. Like many another\r\npoor son of fancy, he was haunted by magnificent dreams. Now, perhaps,\r\nwas stirring in his mind that vision of his childhood when he lay on\r\nhis back in the New England pasture and “watched a hawk soaring far\r\nup in the blue, and sailing for a long time without any motion of its\r\nwings, as though it needed no work to sustain it, but was kept up there\r\nby some miracle.” Mr. Andrew D. White declares that Professor Langley\r\nwas a poet by nature. Whatever the dominant impulse, he followed his\r\n“aërodrome” like one possessed. It was the all engrossing pursuit of\r\nthe latter years of his life, entailing how much vexation, toil and\r\nunjust censure!\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Board of Ordinance and Fortification, after carefully\r\nstudying the flights of 1896, appropriated $50,000 to enable Professor\r\nLangley to build a one-man flyer. He first tested a gasoline driven\r\naëroplane having one fourth the linear dimensions of the man-carrying\r\none. In external appearance this model resembled the steam “aërodrome,”\r\ndescribed above, but was considerably larger. It spread 66 square feet\r\nof surface, weighed 58 pounds, and developed 2½ to 3 horse power.\r\nWhen ready for the test, August 8, 1903, this beautiful white-winged\r\ncreature was taken to the middle of the Potomac, 40 miles below\r\nWashington, mounted on the launching ways, swiveled into the eye of\r\nthe wind and shot forth like a stone from a catapult, her engine and\r\npropellers humming merrily.\r\n\r\nThe flight must have been very graceful and dignified, for it\r\nelicited commendation even from the squad of reporters present, men\r\nwho customarily recorded such events with uncontrollable mirth and\r\nridicule. Dr. Langley merely remarks: “This was the first time in\r\nhistory, so far as I know, that a successful flight of a mechanically\r\nsustained flying machine was seen in public.” It was also the first\r\nsuccessful gasoline[22] aëroplane, and the forerunner of the host\r\nof flyers presently to spring up in all parts of the world. Its\r\nflight though very brief, owing to a surcharge of gasoline, was so\r\nsatisfactory in all its dynamic features, that it seemed to justify an\r\nimmediate launching of the one-man machine, with which like maneuvers\r\nwere anticipated. As will appear in the sequel this prospect of fair\r\nsailing was beset with unsuspected shoals.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the growth of the aëroplane from its earliest\r\nconception to the present time, as exemplified by working models. First\r\ncame the parachute of Da Vinci and others, whose sole function was\r\nto carry a weight softly to earth, with no provision for steadiness\r\nof motion, or control of direction. Then, in the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, arrived the gliders adjusted for steadiness,\r\nequilibrium and a predetermined slanting course in the air; beautiful\r\npassive birds, actuated by gravity, but riderless and awaiting the\r\nadvent of artificial motive power. Then suddenly appeared Mr. Henson’s\r\nwonderful _project_; a large man-carrying aëroplane, provided with\r\na motor, propellers, rudders, wheels for launching and landing—an\r\nimpossible scheme for that day, but destined to be realized in\r\nthe course of two generations. Henson’s idea was doubtless the\r\nmost prolific in the history of aviation. After this followed the\r\nnumerous instructive models, actuated by twisted rubber, steam,\r\ngasoline, compressed air—economic contrivances for ascertaining the\r\nsecrets of propulsion, equilibrium and control, of the prospective\r\nman-flyer. These may be said to have demonstrated the practicability\r\nof man-flight, though many contemporaneous and allied experiments, to\r\nbe noticed presently, all contributed to the triumphs subsequently\r\nachieved by the race of sanguine, daring and tireless inventors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—LAUNOY AND BIENVENU’S HELICOPTER, 1784.]\r\n\r\nIn this brief outline, the two other main types of flyers, the\r\northopters and helicopters, have been omitted. The orthopters, or wing\r\nflapping machines, have been very numerous, but have not yet approached\r\npractical success in use. Though a man-carrying orthopter has not yet\r\nbeen produced, an elegant pigeon-like model operated by rubber has been\r\nmade by Pichancourt, which flies and balances nicely. The helicopters,\r\nor direct-lifting screws, have more than once raised their weight and\r\nthat of the helicoptrist, or navigator. These latter, therefore, seem\r\nto be of sufficient interest to merit a short historical review.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, the fertile pioneer in aviation, missed one novel\r\ndevice worthy even of his genius. He constructed aërial screws of\r\npaper, but he did not endow them with motive force. Such an achievement\r\nwas in his power, and would have ranked him with Archytas of Tarentum,\r\nwho 400 B. C. invented the kite, and an artificial dove said to have\r\nflown, no one knows how. Having escaped Da Vinci’s ingenuity, the power\r\nhelicopter failed to materialize for three centuries, but finally\r\nappeared in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Launoy and Bienvenu, the first a naturalist, the second a\r\nmechanician, exhibited before the French Academy the interesting toy\r\nshown in Fig. 36. This was the first power-driven helicopter, and is\r\nsaid to have lifted itself in the air quite readily. As may be observed\r\nit consists of two coaxial screws rotating in opposite directions\r\nactuated by the power of an elastic stick, like a bow. The screws were\r\neach about one foot in diameter and made of four feathers; one screw\r\nbeing fastened to the top of the rotating shaft, the other fastened\r\nto the bow, which rotated in the contrary direction. The little model\r\nexcited much interest, particularly as its inventors expected to build\r\na man-carrying helicopter on the same plan. The larger project was\r\nobviously without merit; for no combination of springs can maintain\r\nflight for more than a few seconds even on the most favorable scale.\r\n\r\nA more powerful toy helicopter was produced by Mr. Horatio Phillips in\r\nEngland in 1842. This was a single aërial screw emitting jets of steam\r\nwhich compelled it to spin, on the principle of a lawn sprinkler, or\r\na Hero engine. The whole apparatus weighed two pounds, and had screw\r\nblades inclined 20° to the horizon. The steam was generated by the\r\ncombustion of charcoal, niter and gypsum, as in the fire extinguisher\r\npreviously invented by the same ingenious man. The performance of this\r\ncurious helicopter, is thus described by Mr. Phillips: “All being\r\narranged, the steam was up in a few seconds, then the whole apparatus\r\nspun around like a top, and mounted into the air faster than any\r\nbird; to what height it ascended I have no means of ascertaining. The\r\ndistance traveled was across two fields, where, after a long search, I\r\nfound the machine minus the wings, which had been torn off from contact\r\nwith the ground.”\r\n\r\n“The distance traveled was across two fields.” For vagueness this\r\nsurpasses the poet’s measure—“as far as oxen draw the plow in a day.”\r\nIt would be most interesting to have an exact description of this\r\nclassical experiment, when for the first time a flying machine rose\r\nin the air propelled by a heat motor. It would be desirable also\r\nto know the possibilities of such a helicopter, particularly since\r\nProf. Cleveland Abbe has proposed to employ a like agent to carry\r\nmeteorological instruments into the higher atmosphere.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—FORLANINI’S HELICOPTER, 1878.]\r\n\r\nA still more ambitious helicopter was that shown in Fig. 37 invented by\r\nProfessor Forlanini, an Italian Civil Engineer, and launched in 1878.\r\nThe lower screw was fastened to the frame of a steam engine, the upper\r\nscrew was attached to the crank shaft. Steam was supplied from the\r\nglobe shown beneath, which was two thirds filled with water, and well\r\nheated over a separate fire just before an ascension. As the globe was\r\nmerely a reservoir of hot water and steam, carrying neither fuel nor\r\nfurnace, its power waned rapidly. The best flight lasted about twenty\r\nseconds, attaining a height of 42 feet. The apparatus weighed 77\r\npounds, spread 21.5 square feet of screw surface, and lifted about 26.4\r\npounds per horse power.\r\n\r\nMany other helicopter models have been tried from time to time, with\r\nvarious sources of power, without, however, yielding any important\r\nresults beyond those already given. But these were sufficiently\r\nencouraging. If a large machine could be made to lift as many pounds\r\nper horse power, it would be easy to build one competent to carry\r\na man. That, indeed, has been done on several occasions. Of the\r\nvarious inventors who have built man-lifting helicopters M. Cornu and\r\nM. Bréguet, in France, seem to have been first to attain a measure\r\nof success. While their machines have raised a passenger directly\r\nfrom the ground, they have not yet maneuvered in horizontal flight\r\nwith sufficient speed to be of practical service. However, a few\r\nhelicoptrists in various countries are still industriously at work, and\r\nhope eventually to rival the aëroplanists in the mastery of flight.\r\nThere will doubtless be room in the sky for both. Perhaps also there\r\nwill be occupation and a mission for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                     NINETEENTH CENTURY MAN-FLYERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving traced the growth of winged models from their earliest beginning\r\nto the time when they proved the possibility of mechanical flight, we\r\nmay now study the evolution of larger machines, designed to carry human\r\nbeings. Considering first the aëroplane, we may follow the two general\r\nmethods advocated by various inventors for launching a man safely in\r\nthe air, both of which led to success. The first of these may be called\r\nHenson’s method, the second Lilienthal’s, coupling them with the names\r\nof their distinguished pioneer exponents. Henson in 1842 proposed\r\nthat the pilot should mount a full-power machine, run along a smooth\r\ncourse, and glide into the air without previous experience in the art\r\nof navigating. Lilienthal recommended careful preliminary training on a\r\nglider, by which the novice should acquire sufficient skill in parrying\r\nthe wind to qualify him to manage a dynamic machine, under its more\r\ncomplex conditions of control. Others, more cautious still, contended\r\nthat automatic equilibrium should be secured before a rider risked his\r\nbones on the aërial bronco; while still others thought the uncertain\r\nbeast should be tethered to some point in the sky, say a balloon or\r\ntaut wire, or the end of a pole; so that however he bucked, or reared,\r\nhe should not fall over on his rider.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed in the first chapter some picturesque man-flights,\r\nusually deplorable or tragic; and always fruitless for lack of\r\nscientific method in experimentation and report to the world. There can\r\nbe no doubt that such flights were accomplished, mainly, of course,\r\nby the aid of gravity; but the difficulty is to ascertain the exact\r\nnature of any given performance, the specifications of the apparatus,\r\nand the principles of equilibrium and control. Gradually, however, the\r\nexperimenters improved both in the construction of man-carrying devices\r\nand in the manner of imparting their results to their colleagues, or\r\nsuccessors; and so the flying enterprise began to assume a progressive\r\naspect, attended with that scientific dignity which invests secure\r\nand continuous advance in any branch of knowledge. Little of value,\r\nhowever, can be gleaned from any such flights made prior to the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century. From that time forward observers and\r\ninventors made definite and fairly methodical efforts to develop the\r\nart of gliding and soaring in the air, the first fruit of which was to\r\nhasten the advent of the modern aëroplane.\r\n\r\nA French novelist and aëronautic writer, G. de la Landelle, relates\r\nan amazing adventure in the art of soaring, which may have some\r\nfoundation in fact, though savoring strongly of fiction. An experienced\r\nsailor, Captain Le Bris, having observed the albatross soaring without\r\nwing-beat, determined to imitate the fascinating flight of that\r\nlimber-winged spirit of the sea. To such end he built the bird shown in\r\nFig. 38, a ninety-pound albatross, with arched wings fifty feet across\r\nand articulated to the boat-like body. In this the brave aviator would\r\nstand upright, turn the wings and tail to maintain his balance, and\r\nsteer grandly through the sky. Placing this long-winged creature across\r\na cart driven by a peasant, he stood erect and headed against a breeze;\r\nthe wings set low to prevent lifting till an opportune moment, and the\r\nbird held down to the car by a rope which the captain could quickly\r\nrelease. When the horse was a-trot, and the wind blowing freshly, Le\r\nBris raised the front edges of the wings. Thereupon the albatross\r\ntugged upward, and the mooring rope was slipped, but accidentally\r\nwhipped around the driver’s waist. The horse galloped away with the\r\ncart; the bird, with the exultant sailor on its back, soared 300 feet\r\ninto the air, and incidentally carried up the peasant, dangling at\r\nthe end of the rope and howling with fright. Noting the distress of\r\nhis passenger, the kindly captain sailed close to earth, so that the\r\npeasant might disembark and run to his horse, meaning then to hie away\r\nfor a long cruise in the clouds. But with this change of weight the\r\nvessel seemed not to navigate well; so she was brought skimming to\r\nland, with no mishap save a slight damage to the advancing wing, which\r\nbroke as it touched the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—LE BRIS’ AËROPLANE, 1855.]\r\n\r\nHaving repaired the great bird’s wing, Captain Le Bris next made\r\na launching from the arm of a derrick, 30 feet above the ground,\r\noverlooking a quarry 70 feet deep. The attendant swains stood\r\nopen-mouthed, wondering whether this madman would overleap the clouds,\r\nor promptly butt out his brains on a jagged rock. When the wind blowing\r\nfrom the quarry seemed to float him in perfect poise, he tripped the\r\nsuspension hook, and headed for the precipice on even keel. He was now\r\nhappily launched, and keen for an aërial journey; but after passing\r\nthe brink, he seemed to encounter an eddy which tilted his craft\r\nforward. The vessel dipped and rose; the captain plied his levers,\r\nturning now the tail, now the pinions. He crossed safely over the\r\ninvisible breakers, and reached the quiet air of the quarry on level\r\nwing. But now his forward speed was lost, the great bird sank rapidly\r\nand crashed upon the rocky bed below. The wary seaman anticipating a\r\nbump, sprang upward to soften his fall; but a lever rebounding from the\r\nshock, hit one of his legs and broke it.\r\n\r\nSome twelve or thirteen years later, in 1867, Le Bris, aided by a\r\npublic subscription at Brest, built a second albatross, with which\r\nhe made a number of small flights, sometimes riding it himself, and\r\nsometimes replacing his weight by ballast. On one occasion the loaded\r\nbird, held by a light line, rose 150 feet and advanced against the\r\nwind. Suddenly the sailors holding the line observed it slacken, and\r\nsaw with amazement the long-winged creature soar forward 600 feet, as\r\nstately and serene as its living prototype. Presently encountering a\r\nsheltered and quiet region of air before some rising ground, it settled\r\nsoftly to earth in perfect equipoise. But on a subsequent launching\r\nfrom the same favorable ground, the dumb creature pitched forward and\r\nplunged to the earth where it lay shattered and torn in a hopeless\r\ntangle. Le Bris looked on the wreck in despair, surveying sadly the\r\nremains of his once cherished bird; then sat upon the débris a long\r\ntime, his head between his hands, his heart broken, his mind tortured\r\nwith anguish. Impoverished, chagrined, derided, he now must abandon\r\nthe albatross business. Five years later this intrepid sailor of sea\r\nand air was killed by some ruffians, in 1872, while a constable in his\r\nnative place, and after a period of honorable service to the state in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War.\r\n\r\nThe story is more romantic than instructive, for want of exact data.\r\nTo give the experiments their proper value to others, fuller details\r\nof the mechanism should be furnished, and adequate measurements of the\r\nspeed and direction of the aërial currents. At one time the sailing\r\nwas even, at another, rough, though outwardly the conditions appeared\r\nthe same. Apparently the successful flights occurred when the bird was\r\nlaunched to windward from rising ground, that is, when the current had\r\nan upward slant, to exert a propulsive effort. This species of soaring\r\nhas been observed frequently in nature, and has been imitated both with\r\nmodels and with man-carrying gliders. Nevertheless Le Bris’ experiments\r\nwere very remarkable for the time, and, if adequately reported, might\r\nhave proved to be of much interest and value to aëronautical science.\r\n\r\nAnother Frenchman alert to the glory of aërial motion was L. P.\r\nMouillard, the poet-farmer of Algeria. From boyhood he studied the\r\nbirds with unabated interest and pleasure. He would journey miles to\r\nattend the “morning prayer” of the starlings in the forest of Baba-Ali;\r\nnoting, just before sunrise, how their melodies suddenly hushed, and\r\nthe forest seemed to bound upward, and heaven filled with the music of\r\ninnumerable wings. He would time the shadow of the high bird of passage\r\nriding the hurricane from continent to continent. He saw the tyrant\r\neagle fold his wings in mid air and plunge a thousand feet in ferocious\r\nswoop after the swift-fleeing duck or rabbit. He loved to watch the\r\ngreat tawny vulture on the mountain top shake the dew from his vast\r\nplumes, straddle the morning wind, and all day long, with never a beat\r\nof those grand pinions, soar godlike through immensity, the marvel\r\nand delight of the nether world. When the electric wind of the desert,\r\nblowing from Central Africa, brought the big scavengers and noble birds\r\nof prey, he sat on the ground scrutinizing their majestic flight and\r\nplanning to imitate it. He would lie in ambush where the silent-rowing\r\nowl darted at dusk through the timber, fierce and swift as the eagle;\r\na dreadful thing, with its night piercing eyes, its big ears and beak,\r\nits horrid talons, its sudden shriek startling the forest with ominous\r\nechoes. No feature escaped him, and least of all an aërodynamic one.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years he continued these studies. He would bring home\r\nthe birds, lay them on their backs and mark their contour on paper,\r\nmeasure their projected area, weigh and compare them. He formulated\r\ncurious conclusions about sailors and rowers, the functions of tail and\r\nquill feathers, weight and wing-spread, bulk, agglomeration of mass,\r\nresistance and velocity. He notes that only massive birds soar well,\r\nthe broad-winged ones requiring a moderate wind, the narrow-winged ones\r\nrequiring a gale, and sailing with perfect ease in a tempest; and he\r\nconcludes that man may imitate both types. His book[24] is replete with\r\ncharming anecdotes, observations and quaint theories, interesting alike\r\nto ornithology and aviation.\r\n\r\nBut Mouillard did more than theorize; he built soaring machines and\r\nsoared a little. His third and best glider, illustrated in Fig. 39, was\r\na tailless monoplane made of curved agave sticks screwed to boards,\r\nand covered with muslin. The aviator, standing in the open space C,\r\nharnessed the plane on with straps looped round his legs and shoulders,\r\nand fastened to the points D D. His forearms, passing under straps,\r\nrested on the board, enabling him to tilt the whole by shifting his\r\nweight. In order to vary the dihedral angle between the wings, they\r\nwere hinged together and actuated by rods running from the man’s feet\r\nto the ends of the boards, hardly as far out as the center of wind\r\npressure, thus apparently stressing his legs like a wishbone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—MOUILLARD’S AËROPLANE.]\r\n\r\nHe now sent the home folks away from the farm, buckled on his wings and\r\nwalked along the prairie road waiting for a breeze. The road was raised\r\nfive feet above the plain and bordered by ditches ten feet wide. His\r\nwings felt light; he ran forward to test their lift, and he thought to\r\namuse himself by jumping the ditch. The result is thus expressed in his\r\nown words:[25]\r\n\r\n  “So I took a good run across the road and jumped at the ditch.\r\n  But, oh, horrors; once across the ditch my feet did not come\r\n  down to earth; I was gliding on the air, and making vain\r\n  efforts to land; for my aëroplane had set out on a cruise. I\r\n  dangled only one foot from the soil, but, do what I would, I\r\n  could not reach it, and I was skimming along without the power\r\n  to stop. At last my feet touched the earth; I fell forward\r\n  on my hands; broke one of my wings, and all was over; but\r\n  goodness, how frightened I had been! I was saying to myself\r\n  that if even a light wind-gust occurred, it would toss me up\r\n  30 to 40 feet into the air, and then surely upset me backward,\r\n  so that I would fall on my back. This I knew perfectly, for I\r\n  understood the defects of my machine. I was poor, and I had not\r\n  been able to provide myself with a more complete aëroplane.\r\n  All’s well that ends well. I then measured the distance between\r\n  my toe marks, and found it to be 138 feet.\r\n\r\n  “Here is the rationale of the thing. In making my jump I\r\n  acquired a speed of 11 to 14 miles per hour, and just as I\r\n  crossed the ditch I must have met a puff of rising wind. It\r\n  probably was traveling some 8 to 11 miles per hour, and the\r\n  two speeds added together produced enough pressure to carry my\r\n  weight.”\r\n\r\nHe repaired his wing and repeated the test a few days later. A violent\r\nwind gust came; picked him up from the earth, and whelmed him over. In\r\nhis alarm he allowed his “wish-bone” to spread, and the wings to fold\r\nup like those of a butterfly at rest, pinching him between them like\r\na nut in a nutcracker. One wonders whether the overwheeling vultures\r\nwitnessed this gentleman’s flight with any sense of humor.\r\n\r\nAfter mature reflection, Mouillard concluded that he should give his\r\naëroplane a rudder, and flex the wings, in order to insure adequate\r\ncontrol. But here he halted, being a poor man unskilled in the art\r\nof construction. He had reached the limit of his endowments. He had\r\nobserved faithfully and described charmingly the wonderful flights\r\nof various birds; but he must leave to his technical successors the\r\npleasure of imitating or excelling those extraordinary maneuvers—leave\r\nthem the pleasure, the sacrifice, the long years of toil and danger,\r\naccompanied perhaps by indiscriminate applause or derision.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another distinguished disciple of the birds was\r\nenergetically at work in Germany. No less ardent than Le Bris, or\r\nMouillard, Otto Lilienthal was far better equipped and circumstanced.\r\nHe was a graduate of the Potsdam Technical School, and a student\r\nfor three years in the Berlin Technical Academy. He was engaged in\r\npractical construction ten years in various machine shops at Berlin.\r\nAfter 1880 he operated a flourishing machine factory of his own. From\r\nboyhood he with his brother Gustavus had carefully studied the flight\r\nof birds, and had made numerous experiments in aviation. On moonlight\r\nnights in their little home place of Anclam, in Pomerania, the boys\r\nwould run downhill, flapping their home-made wings, like Dædalus and\r\nIcarus, but with no other danger than discovery and teasing by their\r\nneighbors. At Potsdam and Berlin they continued to experiment and to\r\nconstruct wings of increasing size and power. Thus Otto Lilienthal\r\nreached early manhood thoroughly trained by his long courses in the\r\ntechnical schools and shops, brimming with well pondered ideas,\r\nstrengthened by continuous observation and experiment, and in financial\r\ncircumstances which permitted him to devote time and money to the\r\nunremunerative pursuit of aviation. To this may be added that his\r\nmature years were cast in a time when the allied sciences could aid\r\nhim far more than they had aided his predecessors of the preceding\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nAfter careful research for the most efficient form of alar surface,\r\nLilienthal resolved to imitate the birds. First he would build a pair\r\nof arched wings, and learn to coast down the atmosphere, balancing\r\nand steering like a stork in the gusty and treacherous current. He\r\nwould thus acquire the pilot’s skill, and ascertain the towline power\r\nrequired to sustain a given weight. Then he would add a suitable\r\npropelling mechanism, test it cautiously, and acquire the mastery of\r\ndynamic flight. Incidentally, perhaps, he would learn to ride all over\r\ncreation without motive power; for he was convinced that certain great\r\nbirds soar without muscular effort, and that man could acquire this\r\ndelightful art in favorable weather. To strengthen the plausibility\r\nof that doctrine, he announced his discovery that the general trend\r\nof the wind is three and a half degrees upward, a fact inexplicable\r\nand almost incredible to his illustrious confrère of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.[26] Such was Lilienthal’s ample program; more, indeed,\r\nthan he would live to accomplish, though possibly not beyond his power\r\nof achievement, if he could have lived to enjoy the hale long years of\r\nhis illustrious countryman aëronaut, Count Von Zeppelin.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1891 Lilienthal made his first series of trials in sailing\r\nflight. His glider was the bird-shaped apparatus shown in Plate XVI,\r\nmade of willow wood covered with waxed sheeting. It weighed about 40\r\npounds, and spread 107 square feet of surface. Taking this in his arms\r\nhe first ran 24 feet along a raised board and jumped off, gliding\r\nthrough still air. Then, elevating the board to a height of six feet,\r\nhe repeated the run, jump and glide, always landing very softly. Thus\r\nhe became “king of the air in calm weather,” a title still creditably\r\nsustained by his numerous successors of the present day; for as yet no\r\none “mounts the whirlwind and directs the storm.”\r\n\r\nNext he went to some little mounds in a field beyond Werder, and jumped\r\nfrom these, gradually lengthening his flights till he attained a range\r\nof nearly 80 feet. As he was now gliding in light winds, he found it\r\nnecessary to add a vertical rudder, in order to preserve his balance\r\neasily, and keep his bow toward the direction of the wind. His complete\r\napparatus was, therefore, a birdlike affair, with two rigid wings and\r\na double tail for steering vertically and horizontally. He found also\r\nthat he could fly longer and alight more softly when the wind was\r\nblowing—an obvious possibility.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this experience Lilienthal explored the country about\r\nBerlin for sailing ground where he could make long glides, whatever\r\nthe direction of the wind. Such a region he found near Rathenow, where\r\nthe Rhinow hills, covered with grass and heather, slope gently upward\r\nfrom the flat plowland to a height of over 200 feet. This he thought\r\nan ideal coasting ground; for he felt the aërial currents very smooth,\r\nand he could always select clear land sloping ten to twenty degrees\r\ntoward the wind. Here in the summer of 1893, with a new and improved\r\nglider, he made many flights, finally ranging from 200 to 300 yards,\r\nsteering up and down, or to right and left at will; sometimes pausing\r\nin mid air, and several times returning to the starting point. This was\r\nmore than coasting; for a mere coaster never maintains, nor returns\r\nto, his original level. It was a fair start at true soaring, the ideal\r\nlocomotion. A glorious sport it was, sailing like an eagle high over\r\nthe landscape and over the heads of the astonished spectators.\r\n\r\nThe new machine resembled its predecessors in form and maneuver; but\r\ndiffered in dimensions. It was a birdlike craft with parabolically\r\narched wings and a double tail. It measured 7 meters across, spread\r\n14 square meters of surface, weighed with the rider 200 pounds, and\r\nin calm air could sail down a slope of 9°, at a speed of 9 meters\r\nper second. This was very efficient sailing, the work of gravity\r\nbeing hardly two horse power. With the man lying prone, as eventually\r\nplanned, the economy would be still greater.\r\n\r\nPLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LILIENTHAL’S MONOPLANE GLIDER.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LILIENTHAL’S BIPLANE GLIDER.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILCHER’S MONOPLANE GLIDER.]\r\n\r\nThe craft was thought also to possess stability; and this it had, in a\r\nmeasure, about those two axes corresponding to the two rudders; but the\r\ncontrol about the third axis, effected by dangling the legs to right\r\nor left, was extremely crude and primitive. It was in keeping with his\r\nadage: “to contrive is nothing; to construct is something; to operate\r\nis everything.” If he had contrived more intelligently, he would have\r\noperated more easily, and avoided those wild and dangerous dancings in\r\nspace. A more scientific adage would read: “To design effectually is\r\neverything, to construct is routine, to operate is play.”\r\n\r\nThe marvel is that Lilienthal, the observant, the technically trained,\r\nthe practically skilled, should operate for three years, then patent,\r\nan aërial glider having two rudders, but lacking the third rudder,\r\nor torsional wing, now so commonly used throughout the world. But\r\ndoubtless he contemplated a device for preserving the lateral balance\r\nwithout shifting his weight; for he acknowledged the economic advantage\r\nof lying prone on the machine, and stated that this might be done after\r\nsome important improvements in the apparatus had been made.\r\n\r\nHaving executed nearly two thousand flights with his monoplane,\r\nLilienthal in 1895 built a two-surface glider. He found this still\r\neasier to control, and now thought he had sufficiently acquired the\r\nart of sailing to justify his undertaking the next and more difficult\r\nart of imitating the rowing flight of birds. He had constructed a\r\nninety-pound engine, of two and a half horse power, to actuate the\r\nwings of his glider; but, before applying this motor, he went to the\r\nRhinow Hills for a little further experience in sailing. Previously\r\nhe had remained in the air twelve to fifteen seconds; but he wished to\r\nexceed this record.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, 1896, he made a long glide to prove the\r\neffectiveness of the horizontal rudder, and then wished to undertake\r\na second flight of the greatest duration feasible. No intimation had\r\nhe that this sail would prove disastrous. Giving the timepiece to his\r\nassistant, he set forth on a level course, but suddenly dipped forward\r\nand plunged headlong to earth through a height of fifty feet. He was\r\ndragged out from the débris with a broken spine, from which he died the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThe machine on which the father of aërial gliding made his last flight\r\nis shown in Plate XVI. Of the hazardous nature of its construction Mr.\r\nChanute thus writes: “The two surfaces were kept apart by two struts,\r\nor vertical posts, with a few guy wires, but the connecting joints were\r\nweak, and there was nothing like trussing. This eventually cost his\r\nmost useful life. Two weeks before that distressing loss to science,\r\nHerr Wilhelm Kress, the distinguished and veteran aviator of Vienna,\r\nwitnessed a number of glides by Lilienthal with his double-decked\r\napparatus. He noticed that it was much wracked and wabbly, and wrote to\r\nme after the accident: ‘The connection of the wings and the steering\r\narrangement were very bad and unreliable. I warned Herr Lilienthal very\r\nseriously. He promised me that he would soon put it in order, but I\r\nfear that he did not attend to it immediately.’”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Lilienthal gave fair attention to the merits\r\nof both the monoplane and the biplane, the two familiar types in\r\nlively competition at the present hour. The first he found in Nature;\r\nthe second he could have found in England, as the developments\r\nprincipally of Wenham and of Phillips. His example and prestige did\r\nmuch to promote the biplane; but he seems to have had no very decided\r\npreference for either. Though he found his biplane very satisfactory,\r\nhe thought of returning to the monoplane.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1896, he wrote:[27] “I am now engaged in constructing an\r\napparatus in which the position of the wings can be changed during\r\nflight in such a way that the balancing is not effected by changing\r\nthe position of the center of gravity of the body. In my opinion this\r\nmeans considerable progress, as it will increase the safety. This will\r\nprobably cause me to give up again the double sailing surfaces, as it\r\nwill do away with the necessity which led me to adopt them.” He thus\r\nseems to have studied the two types impartially, and to have invented a\r\nmeans for balancing the machine without shifting the center of mass.\r\n\r\nLilienthal had given a powerful and permanent impulse to aviation,\r\nboth by his writings and by his practical experience in the air. He\r\nfirst showed quantitatively the advantage of arched wings, by carefully\r\nderived tables of wind pressure; then he mounted the wings himself\r\nand taught the world, by bold and frequent flight, the art of aërial\r\ngravity sailing. The two remaining achievements, dynamic and soaring\r\nflight, he was to undertake as promptly as possible. If his life had\r\nbeen spared, no doubt he would have contributed much to the advancement\r\nof these arts, both by example and by direct effort; for he was in the\r\nprime of life, full of energy and daring, highly equipped, and ardently\r\ndevoted to his favorite science. He began his studies in aviation at\r\nthe age of thirteen and died at the age of forty-eight years.\r\n\r\nAmong the admirable traits of the father of sailing flight must be\r\nmentioned his scientific liberality and _esprit de corps_. Though he\r\npatented his invention he did not conceal, or withhold, his discoveries\r\nwhen he could publish them properly. These discoveries were made at\r\na great sacrifice of time and means, and must have appeared to him\r\nvaluable trade secrets; yet he published all his scientific data, his\r\ntheories, and observations; he encouraged his confrères in various\r\ncountries to witness and emulate his experiments, to share intimately\r\nhis laboriously developed knowledge of aviation, to join hands with\r\nhim in hastening the advent of practical flight. Such is the _esprit\r\nde corps_ which has ever prevailed among truly scientific men, as\r\ndistinguished from the mercenary and commercial; such are the unselfish\r\ninvestigators whom the world delights to honor, both for their genius\r\nand for their liberal contributions to the common and permanent\r\npossessions of humanity.\r\n\r\nBefore his death Lilienthal had the pleasure of knowing that competent\r\ndisciples were emulating him in doctrine and practice. One of the\r\nearliest and cleverest of these was Percy S. Pilcher, Assistant\r\nLecturer in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the University\r\nof Glasgow. In the summer of 1895 he built the glider shown in Plate\r\nXVI. This, like Lilienthal’s, was a double-tailed monoplane arched fore\r\nand aft; but, better than his for manual control, it was straight from\r\ntip to tip, like the designs of Henson, Penaud, and other predecessors.\r\nThis improvement was introduced to prevent side gusts from rocking the\r\ncraft so readily as they do the V-shaped gliders. His best sailer, the\r\n_Hawk_, shown in the figure, had wings curved one in twenty, about one\r\nthird from their front edge.[28] Sometimes he sailed downhill; again\r\nhe was towed or launched, like a kite, by means of a cord, running\r\nthrough five-fold multiplying gear, and drawn by running boys, or a\r\nhorse. In both cases he controlled the machine to his own satisfaction,\r\nmaking in 1897 smooth downhill glides of 700 feet length, from an\r\nelevation of 70 feet.[29] He had also visited Lilienthal, but only\r\nafter achieving success at home.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired some skill in sailing, Mr. Pilcher began work on a\r\npower machine. This was to be propelled by a screw actuated by an\r\noil engine, and was to be mounted on wheels backed by stiff springs.\r\nHaving observed his speed of descent in gliding, he computed that\r\ntwo tow-line horse power would float him and his machine, weighing\r\ntogether 220 pounds. A like result was obtained when he was flown as\r\na kite. He was, therefore, on the straight road to achieving human\r\nflight on a screw-propelled, wheel-mounted monoplane. If he had been\r\nmore cautious he might have been the first person to achieve human\r\nflight in a practicable type of dynamic machine; for he seems to have\r\nequaled, if not excelled, his German master in aëroplane design. But\r\nlike the master he provided inadequately for the structural strength\r\nof his glider, and braved too far the dangers of gusty weather. One\r\nstormy day, September 30, 1899, wishing to please several persons who\r\nhad come a long distance to see him, he made two trial flights in a\r\ngentleman’s park near Rugby. The second of these proved fatal. The\r\nspectators heard a cracking noise, saw the tail break, and the whole\r\ncraft plunge headlong to the ground. Poor Pilcher was mortally hurt and\r\ndied thirty-four hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He\r\nwas then in his thirty-third year.\r\n\r\nHad this talented young Briton and his German tutor both lived, there\r\nwould doubtless have been a pleasant race and rivalry between them;\r\nfor the pupil was forming opinions and plans sufficiently divergent\r\nfrom those of his master and friend. He did not approve Lilienthal’s\r\nhigh wings and low center of gravity, nor his V-shape for lateral\r\nequilibrium, nor his flapping wing tips for propulsion, nor his method\r\nof launching the dynamic machine. Fortunately both published their\r\nideas and experiments, leaving to their successors the task of judging\r\nthe merits of their designs, and of adding any improvements that might\r\nstill be required in order to achieve final success.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Pilcher, Mr. Octave Chanute and Mr. A. M. Herring,\r\nin America, were emulating the work of Lilienthal. Mr. Chanute was an\r\nexperienced civil engineer, who had previously written a history of\r\naviation, and experimented with numerous flying models; Mr. Herring,\r\nhis employee for the time, was a mechanical engineer who had assisted\r\nin Langley’s experiments, and previously had flown a Lilienthal glider,\r\nand had made researches in the science of mechanical flight. On June\r\n22, 1896, accompanied by two assistants, they went into camp among the\r\nsand dunes, on the southern shore of Lake Michigan, to study the art of\r\nnavigating an aëroplane without artificial motive power. Mr. Chanute\r\nthought that the maintenance of equilibrium under all circumstances\r\nwas at that time the most important problem of aviation; and that\r\nuntil automatic stability was secured, it would be premature and\r\ndangerous to apply a motor. He wished to evade, for he did not relish,\r\nLilienthal’s way of balancing by shifting the body and kicking wildly\r\nat the stars. His main purpose, therefore, was to acquire the pilot’s\r\nscience; but secondarily he would learn much about the architecture\r\nof gliders, the behavior of air currents, the elements of propulsion\r\nand sustentation.\r\n\r\nPLATE XVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANUTE’S FIVE DECK GLIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERRING IN CHANUTE BIPLANE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERRING’S COMPRESSED-AIR BIPLANE.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Carl Dientsbach.)]\r\n\r\nThey made some flights with a Lilienthal monoplane; but, finding this\r\nunsafe and treacherous, they discarded it in favor of a multiple-wing\r\nglider designed by Chanute, which after many empirical modifications\r\nin the placement of the sustaining surfaces, assumed the form shown in\r\nPlate XVII. This glider resembled the Lilienthal biplane in having the\r\nsurfaces vertically superposed, the rider below them, and the rudder in\r\nthe rear; but it was a five-decker whose wings, on either side, could\r\nswerve fore and aft, so as to bring the center of lift always over the\r\ncenter of gravity, in order to prevent excessive rearing or plunging.\r\nThis glider was found very tractable in a twenty-mile wind, and in a\r\nthirteen-mile breeze would sail down a slope of one in four.\r\n\r\nAfter further study, the five-decker was replaced by a three-decker;\r\nwhich presently was deprived of its obtrusive and unessential lower\r\nsurface, thus assuming the familiar form shown in Plate XVII. As will\r\nbe observed, this was a radically new and elegant design, consisting\r\nof two superposed arched surfaces held together by vertical posts and\r\ndiagonal wires, like a Pratt truss. It was, in fact, the renowned\r\n“Chanute glider” which has been copied by so many succeeding designers\r\nof biplanes.\r\n\r\nThe Chanute glider weighed 23 pounds, spread 135 square feet, and\r\nreadily carried a total weight of 178 pounds at 23 miles an hour. It\r\nwas provided, as shown, with side planes and a double rudder, and\r\nthis latter was elastically connected to the main body to insure\r\nsteadiness of flight, on the principle of the elastic wing margins used\r\nby D. S. Brown in 1874. This craft was found easy to manipulate in\r\nlaunching, sailing and landing, a two-inch shift of the pilot’s weight\r\nequivalencing a five-inch shift on the Lilienthal monoplane. It was\r\nsteady at a speed of twenty to forty miles an hour through the air,\r\neven when the wind was blowing seventeen miles an hour overground. The\r\nangle of descent was 7.5° to 11°, depending on the speed and trend of\r\nthe wind. The work of gravity expended in maintaining steady flight was\r\nat the rate of two horse power for the 178 pounds, a good showing with\r\nthe rider vertical.\r\n\r\nSummer passed before Mr. Chanute could perfect the invention for\r\nautomatic stability by means of swerving wings; but otherwise the\r\ngliding experiments were very satisfactory. The strong and simple\r\nbiplane evolved during those few weeks of fruitful study, though not\r\nan original creation, having been foreshadowed theoretically and\r\nexperimentally, in the work of Wenham,[30] Stringfellow, Lilienthal,\r\nPhillips, and Hargrave, was nevertheless an important contribution to\r\nthe science of aviation, by reason of its strength and simplicity of\r\ndesign, its efficiency, its stability, and, best of all for that day,\r\nits record for good flights and safety. All who could appreciate it\r\nunderstood that the addition of a light motor would transform it to\r\na dynamic flyer, navigable at least in mild weather. The most eager,\r\nperhaps, was Mr. Herring; for he had not only mastered this glider,\r\nbut some years previously had flown successfully rubber-driven models\r\nvery much resembling it in design. These two aviators, therefore, came\r\nto a parting of the ways, Chanute still pursuing automatic stability,\r\nHerring impatiently heading for dynamic flight by the shortest route\r\navailable. Had they continued together on a practical course, they\r\nmight, ere the close of the century, have anticipated at least the\r\nearly flights of the French aviators, if they could have constructed or\r\npurchased an adequate motor.\r\n\r\nAfter some further development of the aërial glider to adapt it\r\nto power flight, Mr. Herring began the construction of a dynamic\r\naëroplane. He had previously built very light steam and gasoline\r\nengines,[31] and deemed the latter best for a perfected flyer, though\r\npreferring steam or compressed air in a first experimental test.\r\n\r\nWhen seen by the present writer in October, 1898, at St. Joseph,\r\nMich., Mr. Herring was about to launch himself in the compressed-air\r\ndriven biplane shown in Plate XVII. It was essentially a powered\r\nChanute-Herring glider, steadied by a double tail, and controlled by\r\nshift of the pilot’s weight, the tail being elastically attached.\r\nThe writer then suggested that both a glider and a dynamic aëroplane\r\nshould be controlled entirely by steering and balancing surfaces, on\r\nthe principle set forth in his paper of 1893; and, in particular,\r\nindicated that the lateral balance should be controlled by changing the\r\ninclination of the wings on either side, while the double tail should\r\nbe used to steer and steady the aëroplane sidewise and vertically; in\r\nother words, that a torque about each of the three rectangular axes of\r\nthe machine should be secured from impactual pressure, thus obviating\r\nthe need for shifting the pilot’s weight. Mr. Herring, while making no\r\nobjection to this proposal, intimated that he had a device for insuring\r\ncontrol without shifting the pilot’s weight, but believed the most\r\nimportant effort for the moment should be to make a short flight with\r\nthe machine as it stood, for the purpose of enlisting capital, then\r\nto add the controlling devices at leisure. He expected to remove the\r\nwheels shown in the figure, hold the aëroplane against a stiff breeze\r\nfrom Lake Michigan, start the propellers, strike a soaring attitude,\r\nand fly forward for a few seconds against the wind.\r\n\r\nThe successful accomplishment of such a flight covering an overland\r\ndistance of seventy-three feet in eight or ten seconds, against a wind\r\nof thirty miles an hour, was reported in the Chicago _Evening News_,\r\nof November 17th of that year; but the present writer has not been\r\nable to ascertain the reporter’s name, or that of any other witness to\r\nthe event, which, if true, is well worthy of verification and detailed\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nIn following the votaries of passive flight, as represented by\r\nLilienthal and his school, we have overlooked the great man-carrying\r\nbird of Clément Ader, one of the most prominent and successful aviators\r\nof that active period. If the reports be true, Ader may justly claim to\r\nbe the first person to navigate the air in a dynamic flying machine.\r\nHowever, it must be observed that his achievements did not at first\r\narouse in France a great pitch of exultation and enthusiasm. There\r\nseemed at the time to be some skepticism as to the practicability of\r\nhis device. But later cordial reparation was made by placing it on the\r\nStand of Honor at the Aëronautical Salon, held in the Grand Palais, at\r\nParis, in December, 1908.\r\n\r\nClément Ader set out in life with the fixed determination to make\r\na fortune, then to build a practical flying machine. Adopting the\r\nprofession of electrical engineer, he quickly accumulated enough\r\ncapital, as he thought, to realize his early ambition. He next visited\r\nAfrica to study at close range the great soaring birds that Mouillard\r\nhad described with so much admiration and vivacity. Going to Algeria\r\nhe disguised himself as an Arab, and, with two Arab guides, journeyed\r\nto the interior where he watched the great soaring vultures, which\r\nhe enticed with bits of meat to perform before him their marvelous\r\nmaneuvers, wheeling in wide circles, and without wing beat, from earth\r\nto sky.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of study of the anatomy and flight of birds, Ader\r\nbegan, at the age of forty-two years, to construct an aëroplane. His\r\nfirst machine was a birdlike monoplane mounted on skids, or wheels,\r\nand driven by a 40-horse-power steam engine actuating a screw, placed\r\nforward. The total weight was 1,100 pounds, the spread 46 feet, the\r\nlength 21 feet. The _Eole_, as he called it, received its first\r\nopen-air test on the morning of October 9, 1890, in the grounds\r\nsurrounding the Chateau d’Armainvilliers, near Gretz, a portion of the\r\ncourse being so prepared that the trace of the wheels would be visible.\r\nWhen everything was ready for the trial, Ader mounted the machine, in\r\npresence of a few friends, ran quickly over the ground, urged by the\r\npropeller thrust, then rose into the air and sailed 150 feet. Such is\r\nthe report of the witnesses to what is claimed as the first flight of a\r\nhuman being in a power-driven flying machine.\r\n\r\nSubsequently this bold inventor built _Eole No. 2_, which, by special\r\npermission of the War Department, he tested on a prepared track, 2,400\r\nfeet long, on the Satory Camp. Over this course he ran his machine\r\nseveral times, and on one occasion flew 300 feet; but on alighting\r\nbroke one of the wings.\r\n\r\nAder, now having spent one and a half million francs on his\r\nexperiments, placed the _Eole_ on exhibition in order to raise money\r\nfor their continuation. In this venture also he was successful,\r\nbeing presently subventioned by the French War Department to build an\r\naëroplane for its use. His subsequent labors are concisely set forth in\r\n_Automobilia and Flight_ for February, 1909, as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Under these new conditions the workshop in the Rue Pajou was\r\n  abandoned for larger premises in the Rue Jasmin, where the\r\n  construction of the _Avion_ was commenced in May, 1892, all\r\n  persons engaged with the construction being under a military\r\n  vow of secrecy. The motor was built first, and tested before a\r\n  commission composed of army officers and some of the leading\r\n  technicians of France. It was found to develop 30 horse power\r\n  for a total weight of 32 kilogrammes; and even now, though\r\n  seventeen years old, is regarded as a _chef d’œuvre_. In the\r\n  spring of 1897 the _Avion_ was ready to make flights. Like its\r\n  predecessors it was modeled on the form of a bat; but, although\r\n  the wings could not be flapped, they could be folded, and\r\n  could be advanced or retarded horizontally.\r\n\r\n  “Everything appearing satisfactory, Ader informed the military\r\n  commission that he was ready to undergo tests; the committee\r\n  met at the workshops in the Rue Jasmin on August 18, 1897;\r\n  were pleased with the machine, and ordered flights to be made\r\n  immediately at Satory. It was not, however, until October 12th\r\n  that a flight was attempted on the carefully guarded military\r\n  ground, and in the presence of General Mesnier. The apparatus\r\n  covered a distance of 1,600 yards, and although it did not fly,\r\n  for this distance it is certain that on several occasions it\r\n  completely left the ground. Ader declared that according to\r\n  whether the wings were carried forward or to the rear, it was\r\n  the front or the rear wheels only which left the ground. The\r\n  pressure in the generator at this moment varied between 3 and 4\r\n  atmospheres. On increasing it to 6 or 7 atmospheres none of the\r\n  wheels touched.\r\n\r\n  “Satisfied with the results of the test, General Mesnier called\r\n  the commission together for further trials on the following\r\n  day, October 14, 1897. Unfortunately it was a rough, squally\r\n  morning, that would have prevented many a modern aviator from\r\n  bringing a machine into the open. But as the officers had been\r\n  brought together specially for this purpose, a flight was\r\n  attempted.\r\n\r\n  “‘After several revolutions of the propellers, and a few yards\r\n  covered at a moderate speed, we were off at a high rate of\r\n  travel,’ wrote Ader, who was at the wheel on this memorable\r\n  occasion. ‘The pressure was about 7 atmospheres. Almost\r\n  immediately the vibrations of the rear wheel ceased, and,\r\n  directly after, those of the front wheels were no longer felt,\r\n  showing that we had entirely left the ground. Unfortunately\r\n  the wind had increased in strength, and I had some difficulty\r\n  in keeping to the line that had been marked out. I increased\r\n  the pressure to 9 atmospheres, and immediately the speed\r\n  increased considerably, the vibrations ceased again, showing\r\n  that we had once more left the ground. Under the influence of\r\n  the wind the aëroplane had a constant tendency to drift to\r\n  the right, away from the circular track that had been marked\r\n  for it. Finally, with the wind broadside on, the machine was\r\n  in a rather dangerous position, for it was being still more\r\n  rapidly driven out of its course. I increased the pressure\r\n  still more and put the rudder hard over to the left, with the\r\n  result that for a few seconds the machine worked back towards\r\n  the track and still maintained itself in the air. But it was\r\n  impossible to struggle against the wind, and finding that the\r\n  machine was being carried towards some artillery sheds, and\r\n  somewhat unnerved by the speed at which the ground appeared to\r\n  be rushing past, I stopped the engine; there was a shock, and I\r\n  was on the ground.’\r\n\r\n  “Ader was uninjured, but his machine was rather badly smashed.\r\n  It had certainly flown, but with such difficulty in the face of\r\n  the wind that the army commission was evidently little inclined\r\n  to report favorably upon it. Several weeks passed without any\r\n  communication being received from the War Department; then it\r\n  became apparent to Ader that the Government had no longer faith\r\n  in his invention. This was proved early in the following year\r\n  by an official communication to the effect that no further\r\n  funds could be allotted to this work. Discouraged at the\r\n  abandonment after forty years’ labor and the expenditure of\r\n  about two million francs, Ader commenced the destruction of his\r\n  machines. The earlier ones were destroyed, but the _Avion_, the\r\n  one which had appeared before the army commission, was saved\r\n  and sent to the Museum of the Arts et Métiers in Paris.”\r\n\r\nThe last aëroplane, or _Avion_, weighed 1,100 pounds, spread 270 square\r\nfeet, and was driven by a 40-horse-power steam engine actuating twin\r\nscrews projecting before the bird-shaped flyer. The engine weighed but\r\n7 pounds per horse power—quite a remarkable achievement for that day.\r\n\r\nIn following the votaries of passive flight, as represented by\r\nLilienthal and his school, we have overlooked the great dynamic\r\naëroplane of Mr. Maxim, one of the most prominent aëroplane builders of\r\nthat active period. Having in 1889 made elaborate experiments on the\r\natmospheric resistance of sustaining surfaces, and on the thrust of\r\nscrew propellers, he proceeded to build the gigantic aëroplane shown\r\nin Plate XVIII, the greatest flyer thus far known to history. It was a\r\ntwin-screw multiplane mounted on a platform forty feet long by eight\r\nfeet wide, and having four wheels running along a track eight feet\r\nwide and half a mile long. Above the rails of this track were guard\r\nrails to prevent the flyer from rising more than three inches during\r\nthe tests. The whole machine weighed 3.5 tons, spread 5,500 square\r\nfeet of surface, and, at a speed of 40 miles an hour, lifted more than\r\na ton, in addition to the weight of the three men and 600 pounds of\r\nwater. Its propelling plant comprised a naphtha tubular boiler, and a\r\ncompound steam engine of 350 horse power actuating twin screws 17 feet\r\n10 inches in diameter which gave a thrust approximating 2,000 pounds.\r\nThese screws were made of American yellow pine, covered with canvas and\r\npainted, then smoothly sandpapered to reduce the friction; for Maxim,\r\nlike certain French aviators, erroneously imagined that a polished\r\nsurface has less air friction than a dead even surface. The framework\r\nwas composed of seamless steel tubing stayed with steel wire. The\r\naëroplane was to be steered right and left by a rudder, and up and down\r\nby horizontal planes, one fore, another aft, and its lateral stability\r\nwas to be secured by side planes set at a dihedral angle. A meritorious\r\nfeature for that day were the superposed arched surfaces whose framing\r\nwas smoothly covered below and above by skillfully stretched fabric,\r\ncausing the air to flow evenly without wasteful eddies.\r\n\r\nPLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAXIM’S AËROPLANE.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANGLEY’S LARGE AËROPLANE.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\nMany runs along the track were made to test the working of this\r\ngreat apparatus before trusting it to launch forth in free flight.\r\nDynamometers gave independently the thrust of the screws, and the lift\r\nof the wings on the front and rear axles. The ascensional planes for\r\ncontrolling the fore and aft equilibrium were tested during the run,\r\nas also the practical operation of the propelling plant. During the\r\ntrials of 1893 the machine frequently lifted clear of the lower track,\r\nand flew forward resting against the guard rails above the wheels.\r\nFinally, on a gusty day, the lift against the upper track caused this\r\nto give way, whereupon the machine rose into the air with Mr. Maxim\r\nand his assistant, then toppled over on the soft earth, suffering\r\nsome damage to its framework. Here the experiments were discontinued\r\nfor lack of funds, having indeed demonstrated that a large weight\r\ncan be carried in dynamic flight, but having proved little as to the\r\nfeasibility of controlling an aëroplane in launching, in free flight,\r\nand in landing.\r\n\r\nCompared with the work of his contemporaries this achievement of Mr.\r\nMaxim was herculean, both in construction and expenditure, the cost\r\nbeing reported as nearly one hundred thousand dollars. It raised high\r\nhopes for aviation. It proved conclusively not only that a flying\r\nmachine could be made to lift a pilot, but that it could carry hundreds\r\nof pounds additional weight. It still holds the world’s record for\r\nmagnitude of machine and cargo. But it had two great defects; it was\r\nimproperly balanced and it was inadequately powered; for, as Mr. Maxim\r\nsays, “the quantity of water consumed was so large that the machine\r\ncould not have remained in the air but a few minutes, even if I had had\r\nroom to maneuver and learned the knack of balancing in the air.”[32]\r\nThese defects, however, would soon be remedied by the work of others,\r\nand particularly by the costly experiments of the automobilists, who\r\nwere rapidly developing a light gasoline motor suitable for aviation.\r\n\r\nThe inventors thus far noticed had developed most of the important\r\nfeatures of the present-day flying machines, but had not provided\r\nadequate mechanism for preserving a steady lateral balance. The present\r\nwriter had proposed the combination of a double rudder and torsional\r\nwings to steer and control a flyer, and had published a paper setting\r\nforth its general principle and describing a specific device; but\r\ninventors had little need for a third rudder till they encountered\r\nthe dangers of dynamic flight in gusty weather. The paper referred\r\nto was presented to the Third International Conference on Aërial\r\nNavigation, in August, 1893, under the title, _Stability of Aëroplanes\r\nand Flying Machines_, and was published with the proceedings of the\r\nconference.[33] It discusses mainly the question of automatic stability\r\nand steadiness; but recommends personal control during the experimental\r\nperiod. It concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n  “We have been considering the question of automatic stability,\r\n  in so far as it may be secured in the construction of the\r\n  craft itself,[34] apart from a pilot, or special equilibrating\r\n  devices. The application of the latter would give exercise\r\n  to an infinite amount of ingenuity, and would, perhaps, best\r\n  be left to the fancy of the individual inventor. One curious\r\n  design, however, occurs to me, which, since I have not seen it\r\n  described elsewhere, may be worth a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\n  “Suppose a Phillips’s machine (see Plate XIV) to be provided\r\n  with a double tail, and to have a vertical fin extending\r\n  longitudinally along its entire length, well above the\r\n  center of gravity. These would steady its flight and promote\r\n  stability. _Suppose also that its sustaining slats were\r\n  pivoted, so that a pilot could at pleasure change their\r\n  inclination on the right and left side independently. He could\r\n  then set the engine for a desired speed, sweep forward along\r\n  the earth with the sustainer slats horizontal, and at will\r\n  mount into the air, by giving the slats an upward inclination.\r\n  Once in the air he could raise or lower the machine by slightly\r\n  changing the angle of the slats; he could wheel to right or\r\n  left by giving one set of slats a little different slope from\r\n  the other; he could arrest all pitching, rocking and wheeling\r\n  by a slight counter movement of the sustainers._ It would be\r\n  necessary, of course, to preserve a rapid forward motion, for\r\n  it is a peculiarity of the compound aëroplane that, if it comes\r\n  to a standstill in the air, it will drop plumb down with a\r\n  frightful plunge until it acquires headway.”\r\n\r\nThe succeeding paragraph disclosed a specific contrivance embodying\r\nthe principle just given. This showed two levers rotating drum shafts\r\nfor actuating wires adapted to change the impact angles of the wing\r\nsurfaces. Accordingly this much of the mechanism of control, together\r\nwith the broad device of the torsion wings, has been the common\r\nproperty of inventors since the publication of that paper. Furthermore,\r\nthe combination of torsional wings and a double rudder, either fixed or\r\nmovable, has been public property since that date.[35]\r\n\r\nLittle was said about the manner of manipulating the double rudder and\r\ntorsional wings; for the rules of manipulation would vary in different\r\nmachines, depending upon structural design and external conditions.\r\nFor example, if the proposed fin and vertical rudder were ample and\r\nsuitably placed, the lateral balance could be controlled by merely\r\ntwisting the wings, without touching the vertical rudder; but if the\r\nfin and rudder were not adequate, the lateral poise would be controlled\r\nby twisting the wings and working the vertical rudder conjunctively.\r\nA novice might prefer leaving the rudders fixed and controlling the\r\npoise in short flights by twisting the wings by means of a single lever\r\nhaving two independent movements, one to rotate the wings oppositely,\r\nthe other to rotate them identically.\r\n\r\nThe principle of control expressed in italics had been set forth also\r\nin a preceding paragraph. Having proposed means for securing both\r\nstability and steadiness about each of the three axes of an aëroplane,\r\nthe text continued:\r\n\r\n  “These ends could probably be attained very well by mounting\r\n  two compound aëroplanes on a long backbone,[36] somewhat after\r\n  the manner of the Hargrave cellular kites, and adding a\r\n  compound rudder to the whole.” ... “_If the inclination of the\r\n  sustainers, front and back, could be altered independently,\r\n  it might be feasible for a pilot to preserve the equilibrium\r\n  of the machine even when its center of gravity was frequently\r\n  shifted, as by the moving of passengers to and fro._”[37]\r\n\r\nAt that date, 1893, an inventor doubtless could have secured a broad\r\nclaim on a mechanism embodying the torsion-wing-and-double-rudder\r\nmechanism of control. But in those days aviation was pursued largely\r\nas a liberal study by scientific men who wished to hasten the advent\r\nof practical flight, by presenting important physical measurements\r\nand principles which could be freely employed by all. Accordingly the\r\nthree-rudder system of control seems not to have been claimed by an\r\ninventor much before the close of the nineteenth century. Since then it\r\nhas been patented in one form or other by many practical aviators, some\r\nendeavoring to claim the whole broad contrivance, others claiming more\r\nrestricted devices.\r\n\r\nThe static principle of the torsion wing is a familiar one in\r\nelementary mechanics. It is this: a torque of given magnitude and\r\ndirection has the same effect on a rigid body whatever its point of\r\napplication. The longitudinal torque, or moment, may therefore be\r\nexerted by the wings, by suitable rudders, by forward planes, by any\r\nauxiliary planes, or fins, however placed or moved for the purpose.\r\nAccordingly there seems to be an unlimited variety of concrete\r\npatentable devices available to the inventor for securing impactual\r\ntorque about the longitudinal axis, or either of the other two axes.\r\nBut in planning such devices it is well to remember that the moment of\r\na couple increases with its arm, so that in a wide aëroplane the wing\r\ntips may best furnish the torque; while in a high short-winged machine,\r\nvertical planes, fins, or rudders may give the desired longitudinal\r\nmoment. Obviously such vertical guiding or controlling surfaces may be\r\nso placed as to tilt the machine toward the center of curvature of its\r\npath, at the same time opposing the centrifugal force, and exerting a\r\ntorque about the vertical axis tending to steer the flyer along its\r\npath.[38]\r\n\r\nThe principle of projectile stability is another consideration of\r\nsome importance in aviation, or more generally in all submerged\r\nnavigation, whether of air or water. A submerged body has projectile\r\nstability if its nose tends always to forerun its centroid, and follow\r\na steady course. A dart is a good example; a fish, a torpedo. Thus if\r\na torpedo-shaped homogeneous solid be hurled in any manner through a\r\nfluid, obliquely or even tail foremost, it promptly turns its nose to\r\nthe front and proceeds steadily along an even course; but if the body\r\nhas not true dynamical balance, it may oscillate or gyrate, or flit\r\nabout in the most erratic manner.\r\n\r\nProjectile stability in a flyer, as in an arrow, may be attained by\r\nplaying the centroid in or near the line of forward resistance, and\r\nwell ahead of the side resistance. The reasons for this are manifest.\r\nIf, however, this arrangement be neglected, a special damping, or\r\ncontrolling, device is required to preserve headlong and steady motion.\r\nIn particular, the objections to placing the centroid too low were\r\nemphasized in the above quoted paper as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I have mentioned the advantage of placing the center of mass\r\n  below the center of surface; this has also its objections.\r\n  While the stability against inversion is increased, the\r\n  stability against rocking is sacrificed. The aëroplane so\r\n  constructed may not easily overturn; but it will sway to\r\n  and fro with a pendular motion. This, when lateral, is very\r\n  objectionable, when fore and aft it is fatal to uniform\r\n  progress, as we shall see in studying the longitudinal\r\n  stability of flying machines. We shall then see that the center\r\n  of mass cannot be lowered with impunity.”\r\n\r\nOf the various flyers and models thus far studied, some manifest fairly\r\ngood, others very imperfect projectile stability. Many inventors have\r\nbeen more alert to the gravitational stability and safety of the\r\nparachute than to the kinetic stability and keen, direct flight of the\r\narrow. Some of the most pretentious machines imitated the thistle down\r\nmore nearly than the dart or swallow. But the exigencies of actual\r\nflight would easily rectify such imperfections of design.\r\n\r\nTractional balance also is a property of some importance in fluid\r\nnavigation. This requires that the line of propulsive thrust coincide\r\nwith the line of fluid resistance. It is a property, however, that\r\ninventors readily apprehend, and usually provide for.\r\n\r\nIn general a flyer is subject to four forces: weight, thrust, air\r\npressure and inertia. When these balance about any axis the craft has\r\nequilibrium about that axis; when they balance about the three axes\r\nthe craft is completely balanced, and preserves its orientation in\r\nflight. Devices for preserving this complete balance have already been\r\ndescribed; as also provision for propulsion and sustentation, launching\r\nand landing safely.\r\n\r\nThus at the close of the nineteenth century all the essential\r\nprinciples and contrivances of pioneer flight were worked out, except\r\none—a suitable motor. This was the real problem of the ages. The rest\r\nwas easy by comparison. A light enduring motor, if available to the\r\nold time inventors, would have brought dynamic flight centuries ago.\r\nThat only could have baffled Da Vinci, Cayley, Henson, Wenham and the\r\nlong line of pioneer aviators. Eventually, of course, steam engines had\r\ncome, endowed with ample power; but costly to build and wasteful to\r\noperate. The light automobile engine appeared in the latter nineties;\r\npromptly thereafter followed the dynamic flyer, the snow-winged herald\r\nof the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n              AËROPLANES OF ADEQUATE STABILITY AND POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the twentieth century found several votaries contriving\r\naëroplanes for one or more passengers. The epoch of models had\r\nvirtually closed, bequeathing a rich heritage. The essential elements\r\nof aviation, barring the motor, had been clearly worked out. The age\r\nof practical flight was at hand. No further need to prove feasible\r\nthe heavier than air; for that had been done repeatedly. Scientific\r\ndesign and patient trial, not invention and physical research, were now\r\nthe chief demand. Further research would improve the aëroplane, but\r\nnot bring it into practical operation. Capital, constructive skill,\r\njudgment in adapting principles and devices already known, energy,\r\npersistence, caution, imperturbability in danger and derision; these\r\nwere requisites. Science had led the way, with uplifted torch; let the\r\ncraftsmen follow her with kit and apron. The aëroplane was sufficiently\r\ninvented; it now wanted, not fastidious novelty, but concrete and\r\nskillful design, careful construction, exercise in the open field.\r\n\r\nOf the group of aëroplanists in the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nMr. Hugo Mattullath, of New York, was one of the most original, daring\r\nand resourceful. He had been a successful inventor, manufacturer and\r\nbusiness man, accustomed to large enterprises. In the latter nineties,\r\ndeeming the time opportune for practical aviation, he determined to\r\nbuild a commercial flying machine. He would begin where Maxim had\r\nstopped. A larger and swifter craft appeared to him most desirable.\r\nIn his judgment any clever mechanic could make a one-man flyer. “Take\r\nthat for granted and waste no time on toys!” Professor Langley’s\r\n“aërodrome,” with every spare ounce filed away, should lift itself,\r\nof course. It might navigate a calm; possibly even a zephyr, if no\r\none sneezed; but never could it carry passengers on schedule time. He\r\ntherefore would jump the little flyers, and build at once a commercial\r\naëroplane strong enough to defy the storm, powerful enough for regular\r\ntraffic on a business scale. That meant a ship for numerous passengers,\r\nequipped to fly fifty miles an hour against the prevailing wind. A\r\nglorious project indeed; an enterprise suited to a gentleman of first\r\nrate ability.\r\n\r\nMattullath’s aim was aërial transportation, not exhibition at county\r\nfairs and crowded carnivals. Regular interurban routes were projected,\r\nterminating in ample landing floors. Broad-winged aëroplanes, huge\r\ncatamarans with shining hulls, sumptuously furnished in gold and\r\ncrimson, should convey happy crews, in all seasons, from metropolis to\r\nmetropolis. Six great engines and propellers to drive the ship, with\r\nabundant reserve power. Melodious strains of music rising incessantly,\r\nto soften the thunder of motors and the demoniacal howl of the wind.\r\nThen transcontinental voyages, outsailing the nimbus, how lovely to\r\nthe anointed of fortune! Jocund savannas nestling by the sea, or in\r\nthe bosom of orchid-crested hills, should welcome to earth the silken\r\nsojourners of the north migrating, gay-plumed and potent, to their\r\nwinter homes in tropic paradise. All the isles of ocean, all the merry\r\nmountains, earth, sea and air, one shining empire, blissful and secure\r\nas Olympus. Chimborazo, girt with every clime, from torrid base to\r\nsnowy peak should glow\r\n\r\n    With alabaster domes and silver spires,\r\n    And blazing terrace upon terrace high\r\n    Uplifted; here serene pavilions bright,\r\n    In avenues disposed; their towers begirt\r\n    With battlements that on their restless fronts\r\n    Bore stars—illumination of all gems!\r\n\r\nSuch were his holiday fancies, seldom revealed, even to his associates.\r\nThe public had no intimate part in his project. A few trusted\r\nengineers, eminent in their profession, and a few financiers, formed\r\nhis advisory board. For two years he worked on the structural elements\r\nof the great sails, propellers, and framing of his ship. But unhappily\r\nwhen he was preparing to present his final plans to his council of\r\nengineers, before building the large vessel, he was brought suddenly to\r\nthe close of his career.[39]\r\n\r\nMattullath’s proposed air ship consisted of two parallel torpedo-shaped\r\nhulls sustained by superposed plane or slightly arched surfaces, and\r\npropelled by feathering-paddle disk wheels embedded in the planes;\r\nthe engines, cargo and passengers to be placed within the hulls.[40]\r\nThis arrangement would enhance the comfort of the passengers at high\r\nspeeds, eliminate resistance, distribute the load on the framing,\r\nand increase the moment of inertia of the vessel, thereby rendering\r\nit less sensitive to side gusts. To improve the projectile stability\r\nand steadiness, the centroid was placed as high as practicable. Large\r\nsteering planes were used fore and aft on both sides of the vessel,\r\nwhose inclination could be changed independently, to turn the ship\r\nabout its longitudinal or transverse axis. A vertical rear rudder\r\nsteered to right or left, in conjunction with the side planes. All the\r\nposts were of double wedge shape; all the planes were canvassed above\r\nand below to shield the framing, after the style of Maxim. The hulls,\r\nthe posts, the planes, all parts, were keenly sharpened to economize\r\npower. The ship was to run over its smooth launching field till it\r\nacquired a rising speed of forty to fifty miles an hour, then continue\r\naccelerating up to velocities sufficient for competition with passenger\r\ntrains in all weather.\r\n\r\nWhile one may easily point out certain questionable features in\r\nMattullath’s project, as for example, its odd propellers, one can not\r\nso easily estimate its true merits. The torsion wing device for lateral\r\ncontrol and steering, which he claimed in his patent application,\r\nabandoned after his death, now constitutes a very important feature of\r\nevery flying machine. His planes for fore and aft control, introduced\r\nby Maxim, are also in general use to-day. The principle of load\r\ndistribution, which he greatly prized for diminishing stress and adding\r\nstability, has still to be evaluated by practical test in larger craft\r\nthan any now in operation. The closed hull, for comfort and economy at\r\nhigh speed, is at present popular with many designers.\r\n\r\nOne tentative assumption of Mattullath’s, made on the authority of\r\nMaxim and Langley, was that the friction of the air is a negligible\r\npart of the entire resistance encountered by the hull, framing and sail\r\nsurfaces. Accepting their experimental conclusion, he designed a flyer\r\nso sharp and smooth in all its parts as practically to eliminate the\r\npressural, or head resistance. With no skin friction, with scant hull\r\nand frame resistance, he could afford[41] to fly at a very slight\r\nangle, thus minimizing the drift, or wing resistance, while at the same\r\ntime securing abundant lift by rapidity of flight. He thus arrived,\r\nby cold deduction from the data of those prominent experimentalists,\r\nat an aëroplane swift as the albatross, and wondrously economical of\r\npower. But his financiers were loath to gamble on that assumption. He\r\ntherefore, at their suggestion, instigated systematic measurements\r\nof air friction on smooth surfaces, which demonstrated that in a\r\nsharp aëroplane flying at a very slight angle, the skin friction is\r\nnearly equal to all the other resistances combined. These results were\r\nobtained and published[42] some months after his death. They were\r\nunfavorable to his project, and to all projects for attaining high\r\nspeed through the air by excessive sharpening of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe first dynamic aëroplane of adequate stability and power to carry a\r\nman in prolonged flight, was that of Professor Langley. This machine\r\nwas nearly a duplicate, on a four-fold scale, of the gasoline model\r\npreviously described, which had flown many times with good inherent\r\nequilibrium. There was accordingly every reason to expect that,\r\nweighted and launched like the model, it would fly with the same poise\r\nand swiftness, even if left to govern itself. Having in addition\r\na living pilot, provided with rudders for steering and balancing,\r\ntogether with adequate fuel for a long journey, it seemed to promise\r\nstill better results than the model. But an unfortunate accident in the\r\nlaunching so crippled this carefully designed craft that it fell down\r\nhelpless, without a chance to exhibit its powers of sustentation and\r\nbalance, even for a moment, in normal flight.\r\n\r\nThe first trial occurred on September 7, 1903, in the middle of the\r\nPotomac River at Widewater, Va. The aëroplane was placed on the same\r\ncatapult, above the boat, that had previously started the models on\r\ntheir smooth and rapid maneuvers. The pilot took his seat, and started\r\nthe 50-horse-power engine which ran the propellers without appreciable\r\nvibration. Tugs and launches were placed along the course where they\r\nmight be of service. Photographers, on the water and along shore, were\r\nready to furnish important pictorial records of the experiment. The\r\naëroplane was released and sped along the track attaining sufficient\r\nheadway for normal flight; but at the end of the rails it was jerked\r\nviolently down at the front, and plunged headlong into the river,\r\nsinking beneath the waves. Buoyed up by its floats, it quickly rose to\r\nthe surface, with its intrepid pilot uninjured, and with little damage\r\nto the structure.\r\n\r\nAs revealed by an examination of the catapult and photographs, the\r\nguy post that strengthened the front pair of wings had caught in the\r\nlaunching ways, and bent so much that those wings lost all support. The\r\naëroplane, therefore, had not been set free in the air, but had been\r\nwrenched and jerked downward. Thus the launching proved nothing of the\r\npropulsive or sailing powers of the machine.\r\n\r\nThose who understand the principles of aviation can judge the merit of\r\nLangley’s “aërodrome”[43] from its mechanical description. As shown in\r\nPlate XVIII, it was a tandem monoplane driven by twin screws amidships.\r\nThe pilot seated in the little boat could control the poise and course\r\nby several devices; he could shift his weight longitudinally 4.5 feet,\r\nlaterally 2.5 feet; he could elevate and depress the rear double\r\nrudder, which when untouched ensured steady longitudinal poise, on the\r\nprinciple introduced by Penaud; he could steer to right and left by\r\nturning about its vertical axis, the wind-vane rudder shown below and\r\nrearward of the boat. The lines of lift, propeller thrust and forward\r\nresistance passed through the centroid, or near it, thus providing\r\nfor projectile and gravitational stability. In this feature Langley’s\r\n“aërodrome” far surpassed those of his immediate predecessors, whose\r\nmachines, by reason of their low centroid, possessed the stability of a\r\npendulum, rather than that of a dart, or swallow. These various devices\r\ncombined should give the craft better control in free flight than that\r\npossessed by any of the models, which had flown successfully many times\r\nin moderate weather.\r\n\r\nIf the projectile and steering qualities of Langley’s machine surpassed\r\nthose of its predecessors, the propelling mechanism was a still\r\ngreater advance in the art of aviation. The gasoline engine was a\r\nmarvel of lightness, power, endurance and smoothness of running. It\r\nweighed, without accessories, 125 pounds, and developed 52.4 horse\r\npower in actual test at a speed of 930 revolutions a minute. With\r\nall accessories, including radiator, cooling water, pump, tanks,\r\ncarburetor, spark coil and batteries, it weighed 200 pounds, or\r\nscarcely five pounds per horse power—a great achievement for that time.\r\nIt could run many hours continuously under full load, consuming about\r\none pound of gasoline per horse power per hour. Its five cylinders,\r\narranged radially round a single crank shaft, were made of steel lined\r\nwith cast iron, and measured 5 inches in diameter by 5.5 inches in\r\nstroke. Its running balance was excellent. By means of bevel gears it\r\ndrove the twin screws at 700 revolutions per minute, giving a thrust\r\nof 480 pounds, the screws being very nearly true helices of unit pitch\r\nratio and 30° width of blade, carefully formed of three radial arms\r\ncovered with canvas.\r\n\r\nThe whole machine weighed 830 pounds, including the pilot; spread 1,040\r\nsquare feet of wing surface; measured 48 feet from tip to tip, and 52\r\nfeet from the point of its bowsprit to the end of its tail; soared at a\r\nspeed of about 33 feet a second and a ten-degree angle of flight, the\r\nwings arching one in eighteen at one fourth the distance from their\r\nfront edge. The double rudder, at the extreme rear, measured 95 square\r\nfeet in each of its component surfaces.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these figures, very kindly furnished by Mr. Manly,\r\nthe mechanical engineer in charge of the experiments, that such an\r\naëroplane had every equipment needed for a steady flight of many hours\r\nin fair weather. A thrust of 490 pounds on well-designed surfaces\r\nshould easily carry 500 pounds of gasoline in addition to the 830\r\npounds regular weight of ship and pilot. This would enable the machine\r\nto fly practically all day without renewal of supplies. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that Professor Langley had, in 1903, a dynamic aëroplane\r\nquite the peer, in many respects, of the best that were developed\r\nduring the first decade of aviation, and that a mere accident, which\r\nshould be expected in such complex experimentation, deprived him of\r\nthe credit of the first man-flight on an adequately controlled and\r\npowered machine. Quite true, he lacked launching wheels; but how easy\r\nto add these, since they were proposed many times. He omitted the\r\nfront steering plane, but had a rear one serving the same purpose. The\r\nworst that can be said is that he needed the equivalent of torsion\r\nwings for lateral control; but in moderate weather he could have flown\r\nsuccessfully without them, as Farman, Delagrange, Paulhan[44] have so\r\nfully demonstrated. Besides, Langley had already tested the torsion\r\nwing device, and contemplated using it on his large machine.\r\n\r\nA second launching was attempted on the Potomac River near Washington,\r\non December 8, 1903. This time the rear guy post was injured, crippling\r\nthe rear wings, so that the aëroplane pitched up in front and plunged\r\nover backward into the water. After some repairs it was stowed away\r\nin the Smithsonian Institution, where its frame and engine are still\r\nintact, its wings having been injured in the wreck and discarded. The\r\nexperiments were now abandoned for want of funds to continue them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Professor Langley had contributed much to the\r\nscience of aërodynamics, by his elaborate researches, and had really\r\ndeveloped a machine capable of sustained flight, if properly launched,\r\nhe was subjected to unmitigated censure and ridicule; for he had\r\nincurred the enmity of various journalists and wiseacres, partly by\r\nhis official secrecy, and partly by that natural reticence which\r\navoids premature publicity in important scientific enterprises. This\r\nirresponsible criticism, combined with the cessation of work which\r\nshould have brought success, profoundly grieved him, and doubtless\r\nhastened his death. He had, however, the satisfaction of knowing that\r\na few competent specialists appreciated his labors, and would continue\r\nthem to abundant fruition. A few days before his death he had the\r\ngratification of receiving, from the newly formed Aëro Club of America,\r\nthe following communication acknowledging the value of his efforts to\r\npromote aërial travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                RESOLUTIONS OF THE AËRO CLUB OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n                      _Adopted January 20, 1906._\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, our esteemed colleague, Dr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, met with an accident in launching his\r\naërodrome, thereby missing a decisive test of the capabilities of this\r\nman-carrying machine, built after his models which flew successfully\r\nmany times; and whereas, in that difficult experiment, he was entitled\r\nto fair judgment and distinguished consideration because of his\r\nimportant achievements in investigating the laws of dynamic flight, and\r\nin the construction of successful flying models; therefore be it\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the Aëro Club of America, holding in high estimation\r\nthe contributions of Dr. Langley to the science of aërial locomotion,\r\nhereby expresses to him its sincerest appreciation of his labors as a\r\npioneer in this important and complex science; and\r\n\r\n“_Be it further resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to\r\nthe Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and to Dr. Langley.”\r\n\r\nThis kindly message from America’s foremost aëronautic society brought\r\na moment’s pleasure to the last hours of the illustrious scientist.\r\n“Professor Langley was on his deathbed when these resolutions were\r\nbrought to his attention, and when asked what should be done with the\r\ncommunication, his pathetic answer was: ‘Publish it.’ To all who know\r\nhis extreme aversion to publicity in any form, this reply indicates how\r\nkeenly he felt the misrepresentation of the press.”[45]\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley’s progress with the “aërodrome” was due largely to\r\nthe skill, energy and devotion of his designer and superintendent of\r\nconstruction, Mr. Charles M. Manly. This talented young graduate in\r\nmechanical engineering, of Cornell University, in 1898, went directly\r\nfrom the class room to assume the chief burden of Langley’s researches\r\nin aërodynamics, and his practical experiments in mechanical flight,\r\nremaining till their termination in 1904. He was the confidential\r\nsecretary and adviser to his chief in that whole enterprise. When\r\nin 1900 Dr. Langley stood baffled before the greatest obstacle in\r\naviation, unable to find any manufacturer, in America or Europe, who\r\ncould furnish a practical engine of the desired power, lightness and\r\ndurability, Manly came to his rescue with a design which guaranteed\r\nsuccess and which resulted in the wonderful gasoline motor built in the\r\nSmithsonian shops. Finally when the aëroplane was ready to be launched,\r\nit was Manly who bore the long weeks of trial in the malarial region of\r\nWidewater, harassed by accidents and foul weather, not to mention the\r\nmerry agents of the press; and it was he who twice rode the ponderous\r\naërodrome, shot forth in mid air at the imminent risk of his life.\r\n\r\nWhile Langley was building his great tandem monoplane, Wilbur and\r\nOrville Wright of Dayton, Ohio, were developing a biplane which was\r\nan improvement on the aërial glider of Chanute and Herring. This was\r\nto be their preliminary effort toward achieving continuous flight.\r\nTheir first product, tried at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in the\r\nsummer of 1900, is shown in Plate XIX. The chief points of departure\r\nfrom Chanute and Herring’s glider were (1) to place the rider prone\r\non the lower surface, as first proposed and tried by Wenham, forty\r\nyears’ previously; (2) to discard the vertical rudder; (3) to place\r\nthe horizontal rudder forward, as done by Mattullath and Maxim; (4)\r\nto control the lateral balance by changing the impact angles of the\r\nwings, as recommended by the present writer in 1893. Of these four\r\nmodifications the first was impractical for general use, though good\r\nfor soaring and possibly racing; the second was unsatisfactory and\r\nlater abandoned; the third was effective, and has been accepted by\r\nsome aviators as an improvement, but rejected by others who prefer the\r\nrear[46] horizontal rudder; the fourth proved acceptable to them, as to\r\nvarious other inventors before and after them.\r\n\r\nWith this glider they made a number of satisfactory flights. The front\r\nrudder and the torsional wings proved adequate to control the craft\r\nin sailing straight ahead down the Kill Devil sand hills, near Kitty\r\nHawk, N. C. In this, as in all their machines to the present date, sled\r\nrunners, fixed under the machine, as proposed by Ader and others, were\r\nused for launching and landing. With a surface of 165 square feet, they\r\ncould glide down a slope of 9.5° at a speed of 25 to 30 miles an hour.\r\nThis showed only a moderate efficiency, but it was a beginning.\r\n\r\nThe glider used in the summer of 1901 was modeled after that of the\r\nprevious year, but larger. It was 22 feet wide, 14 feet long, 6 feet\r\nhigh, spread 308 square feet, and weighed 108 pounds. With this a\r\nnumber of glides were made, of various lengths up to 400 feet. At a\r\nspeed of 24 miles an hour gravity exerted on the aërial coaster 2½\r\ntow line horse power, showing an efficiency nearly equal to that of\r\nPilcher’s glider of 1897.\r\n\r\nIn camp with the Wright brothers in 1901 was Mr. Chanute, the leading\r\naëronautic expert in America. They thus had the advantage of\r\nhis long experience, both as a student of aviation and a practical\r\nexperimenter. With them were also two other specialists, Mr. E. C.\r\nHuffaker, an experienced aëronautical investigator, who had worked\r\nsuccessively with Langley and Chanute; and Dr. G. A. Spratt, who had\r\nmade some important investigations on the value of curved surfaces and\r\nthe travel of the center of pressure with the varying angles of flight.\r\nThe numerous animated conferences with these gentlemen were instructive\r\nand profitable. When the season closed the brothers returned home and\r\nexperimented on curved surfaces to improve the efficiency of their\r\nglider.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST WRIGHT GLIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND WRIGHT GLIDER.]\r\n\r\nThe 1902 machine, shown in Plate XIX, had two main surfaces, measuring\r\neach 32 by 15 feet, and a front rudder measuring 15 square feet. The\r\nwhole weight was 116 pounds. It will be noted that a vertical rudder\r\nwas now employed. This was a reversion to the design of Chanute and\r\nHerring, but after some experience, the rudder was made adjustable,\r\nas in Henson’s aëroplane of 1842. Its surface was 12 square feet,\r\nbut later reduced to six. With this machine they obtained between\r\n700 and 1,000 glides during the season. It showed greater efficiency\r\nthan its predecessors, its normal angle of descent being estimated at\r\nseven degrees or less. This was some improvement over the efficiency\r\nof the Chanute-Herring glider, partly due, of course, to placing the\r\nrider flat, instead of allowing him the more comfortable erect posture\r\nadopted later.\r\n\r\nWhatever improvements of efficiency and strength had been made,\r\nthese were of secondary importance compared with the provisions for\r\nprojectile stability and manual control. Here at last, after ten\r\nyears’ groping, was an actual glider with sufficiently high centroid\r\nto minimize the pendulum effect, and with three rudders to give\r\nimpactual torque about the three axes. These simple provisions had\r\nbeen previously pointed out in aëronautic writing, and, in the latter\r\nnineties, had been embodied in Mattullath’s aëroplane, but not tested\r\nin the large machine, owing to his death. The wonder is that, of all\r\nthe practical inventors of aëroplanes, Mr. Mattullath was the only\r\none of that period fully to grasp and adopt these main ideas before\r\nstarting to build a man-carrying machine. However, it must be added\r\nthat he had previously made small flying models, which may have\r\nsuggested the advantage of kinetic stability and the three-torque\r\nsystem of control. If Lilienthal and his disciples, who laid so much\r\nstress on gliding experience, had started like Mattullath with three\r\ntorque-surfaces, they would have missed indeed those acrobatic and\r\npicturesque kickings at the sky, but they would have reached the\r\ndesired goal with less danger, time and expense. They displayed more\r\nskill in riding a fractious glider than in designing a tractable\r\none, by providing for impactual torque about each of three axes. Had\r\nthey started with a good theory of dynamic control, they could have\r\ndispensed with coasting entirely, and commenced aviating with short\r\nruns over a smooth course followed by cautious leaps in the air, after\r\nthe style of certain ingenious French aviators. However, the knack\r\nof balancing was finally acquired, and thus the glider was ready to\r\nreceive the propelling mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 a 16-horse-power engine and twin-screw propellers were applied\r\nto the navigable glider at Kitty Hawk, as shown in Plate XX. The power\r\nmachine weighed 750 pounds, and was usually started by aid of a tow\r\nline and falling weight which helped the craft to acquire headway.\r\nAfter many trials and modifications, the first successful launchings,\r\nfour in number, were made on December 17th. The first flight lasted\r\n12 seconds, the next two a little more, the fourth lasted 59 seconds,\r\ncovering a distance of 852 feet over the ground in the face of a\r\ntwenty-mile wind. To the superficial observer these performances did\r\nnot seem a very remarkable advance on the flights of Ader, but they\r\nhad in them greater promise and potency of practical flight. They were\r\nthe first flutterings of a fledgling endowed with the chief essential\r\norgans of aërial locomotion—an awkward but healthy creature that had\r\nbeen evolving steadily for several generations. It would grow rapidly,\r\nand ere another half decade, increase the 59 seconds to so many minutes.\r\n\r\nPLATE XX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST WRIGHT AËROPLANE (REAR).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST WRIGHT AËROPLANE (SIDE).]\r\n\r\nThe experiments were continued during the next two years with\r\nincreasing success. During the season of 1904, on a field near Dayton,\r\none hundred and five flights were made, some short, others covering the\r\nentire circuit of the field no fewer than four times, the two largest\r\nmeasuring each nearly three miles, each accomplished in about five\r\nminutes. Various improvements were made in the propelling and steering\r\nmechanism, and increased skill in maneuvering was gradually acquired.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the flights were resumed with a new machine embodying some\r\nchanges dictated by experience, particularly in the method of control.\r\nForty-nine landings were made involving seven breakages, but no\r\npersonal injury. On September 26th a flight of eleven miles was\r\nachieved. This was followed, within the next nine days, by flights of\r\ntwelve, fifteen, twenty-one and twenty-four miles, at a usual speed\r\nof 38 miles an hour. After this the field practice ceased for more\r\nthan two years, and the machine was dismantled to preserve secret its\r\nmode of construction till the patents could be disposed of. As these\r\nperformances and those preceding are of unusual interest, a fuller\r\naccount is given in Appendix IV.\r\n\r\nThe Wright brothers now had to assume in aviation the rôle of cautious\r\nbusiness men. The gliding experiments had been a scientific recreation,\r\nand had been fairly well reported to engineers, except in those details\r\nto be covered by patent claims; but the details of the power machine\r\nwere withheld, or sparingly disclosed. The brothers had sacrificed\r\ntime and money. They were making aviation a profession. They must,\r\ntherefore, be repaid. But if they exhibited too promptly their machine\r\nand aërodynamic data, they might jeopardize their financial interests\r\nby assisting or stimulating rival aviators. On the other hand, by\r\nprocrastination and concealment they might, in various ways, forfeit\r\npriority and scientific credit. Chanute’s glider was already familiar\r\nin Europe, and it was estimated to have ample efficiency for successful\r\nflight with existent motors. Their own published experiments were\r\nbeing studied and repeated. They might, therefore, expect that, at any\r\ntime, some rash or cunning fellow would bolt into the air and proclaim\r\nto all the world that their unpublished devices, if they possessed\r\nany novelty, were by no means necessary, as they fancied, to usher\r\nin actual dynamic flight. The aëroplane would thus appear to be the\r\nsudden outgrowth of fertile and mature conditions, rather than the\r\nproduct of uncommon originality. Scores of aviators would immediately\r\nspring into being—chauffeurs, mechanics, sporting gentlemen of every\r\ndye. Light motors being now available, any intelligent artisan could\r\npower a Hargrave kite, or Chanute glider, and soar aloft. Every odd\r\ncraft, not too absurdly designed, would navigate, with some showing.\r\nPublicity and prize money would develop and perfect the various types\r\nwith feverish haste. But in 1905 the Wright brothers apprehended no\r\nportentous or imminent invasion of the sky. The foreign bogie was five\r\nyears behind, being unfamiliar with sand hill practice and the torsion\r\nwing. They would, therefore, chance the result of withholding their\r\ndata and concealing their machine. It was a curious situation; Langley\r\nand Manly, who produced the first aëroplane endowed with all the\r\nessential powers of prolonged flight, were bound to official secrecy;\r\nthe Wrights, who had a finished machine, tried and fairly ready for\r\npublic exhibition, were hampered by trade secrecy. These silent leaders\r\nin aviation presented a gratifying contrast to the shouting fraternity\r\nwho, in the daily press, announced impending marvels which never\r\nmaterialized.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1905, which crowned with most success the private\r\nflights of the Wright brothers, brought into unusual prominence\r\nthe quarter century long experiments of Prof. J. J. Montgomery of\r\nSanta Clara College, Santa Clara, Cal. He had given much attention\r\nto the science of aviation, particularly to passive flight, and had\r\nconstructed several successful gliders operated by himself or his\r\nfriends. The most remarkable of these machines was a glider resembling\r\nin general appearance Langley’s tandem monoplane, but having means for\r\nchanging the wing curvature during flight, thus varying the lift on\r\nsuch wing, and thereby enabling the operator to control the equilibrium\r\nand direction during his glides in the air.\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1905, a forty-five pound glider of this pattern bearing an\r\nintrepid parachute jumper, Daniel Maloney, was lifted from the college\r\ngrounds by a hot-air balloon to an elevation of 4,000 feet, then cut\r\nloose. “In the course of the descent,” writes one of his pupils, “the\r\nmost extraordinary and complex maneuvers were accomplished—spiral and\r\ncircling turns being executed with an ease and grace almost beyond\r\ndescription, level travel accomplished with the wind and against it,\r\nfigure-eight evolutions performed without difficulty, and hair-raising\r\ndives were terminated by abrupt checking of the movement by changing\r\nthe angles of the wing surfaces. At times the speed, as estimated by\r\neye-witnesses, was over sixty-eight miles an hour, and yet after a\r\nflight of approximately eight miles in twenty minutes the machine was\r\nbrought to rest upon a previously designated spot, three-quarters of\r\na mile from where the balloon had been released, so lightly that the\r\naviator was not even jarred, despite the fact that he was compelled\r\nto land on his feet, not on a special alighting gear.” This daring\r\nperformance amazed the world, and most of all, the specialists who all\r\nalong knew such a feat to be practicable. As a further description\r\nof Professor Montgomery’s wonderful experiments may interest the\r\nreader, the following account, written by himself, is inserted from\r\n_Aëronautics_ for January, 1909:\r\n\r\n  “When I commenced practical demonstration in my work with\r\n  aëroplanes I had before me three points. First, equilibrium;\r\n  second, complete control; and third, long continued or\r\n  soaring flight. In starting I constructed and tested three\r\n  sets of models, each in advance of the other in regard to the\r\n  continuance of their soaring powers, but all equally perfect\r\n  as to equilibrium and control. These models were tested by\r\n  dropping them from a cable stretched between two mountain\r\n  tops, with various loads, adjustments and positions. And it\r\n  made no difference whether the models were dropped upside down\r\n  or in any other conceivable position, they always found their\r\n  equilibrium immediately and glided safely to earth.\r\n\r\n  “Then I constructed a large machine patterned after the\r\n  first model, and with the assistance of three cowboy friends\r\n  personally made a number of flights in the steep mountains near\r\n  San Juan (a hundred miles distant). In making these flights I\r\n  simply took the aëroplane and made a running jump. These tests\r\n  were discontinued after I put my foot in a squirrel hole, in\r\n  landing, and hurt my leg.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTGOMERY’S AËROPLANE.]\r\n\r\n  “The following year I commenced the work on a larger scale, by\r\n  engaging aëronauts to ride my aëroplane dropped from balloons.\r\n  During this work I used five hot-air balloons and one gas\r\n  balloon, five or six aëroplanes, three riders—Maloney, Wilkie\r\n  and Defolco—and had sixteen applicants on my list and had a\r\n  training station to prepare any when I needed them.\r\n\r\n  “Exhibitions were given in Santa Cruz, San José, Santa Clara,\r\n  Oakland and Sacramento. The flights that were made, instead\r\n  of being haphazard affairs, were in the order of safety and\r\n  development. In the first flight of an aëronaut the aëroplane\r\n  was so arranged that the rider had little liberty of action,\r\n  consequently he could make only a limited flight. In some of\r\n  the first flights, the aëroplane did little more than settle in\r\n  the air. But as the rider gained experience in each successive\r\n  flight I changed the adjustments, giving him more liberty of\r\n  action, so he could obtain longer flights and more varied\r\n  movements in the flights. But in none of the flights did I\r\n  have the adjustments so that the riders had full liberty, as\r\n  I did not consider that they had the requisite knowledge and\r\n  experience necessary for their safety; and hence, none of my\r\n  aëroplanes were launched so arranged that the rider could make\r\n  adjustments necessary for a full flight.\r\n\r\n  “This line of action caused a good deal of trouble with\r\n  aëronauts or riders who had unbounded confidence and wanted to\r\n  make long flights after the first few trials, but I found it\r\n  necessary as they seemed slow in comprehending the important\r\n  elements and were too willing to take risks. To give them the\r\n  full knowledge in these matters I was formulating plans for a\r\n  large starting station on the Mount Hamilton Range from which\r\n  I could launch an aëroplane capable of carrying two, one of my\r\n  aëronauts and myself, so I could teach him by demonstration.\r\n  But the disasters consequent on the great earthquake,\r\n  completely stopped all my work on these lines. The flights that\r\n  were given were only the first of the series with aëroplanes\r\n  patterned after the first model. There were no aëroplanes\r\n  constructed according to the two other models, as I had not\r\n  given the full demonstration of the workings of the first,\r\n  though some remarkable and startling work was done. On one\r\n  occasion, Maloney in trying to make a very short turn during\r\n  rapid flight pressed very hard on the stirrup which gives a\r\n  screw shape to the wings and made a side somersault. The course\r\n  of the machine was very much like one turn of a corkscrew.\r\n  After this movement, the machine continued on its regular\r\n  course. And afterwards Wilkie, not to be outdone by Maloney,\r\n  told his friends he would do the same, and in a subsequent\r\n  flight, made two side somersaults, one in one direction and\r\n  the other in an opposite, then made a deep dive and a long\r\n  glide, and when about three hundred feet in the air, brought\r\n  the aëroplane to a sudden stop and settled to the earth. After\r\n  these antics, I decreased the extent of the possible change in\r\n  the form of wing surface so as to allow only straight sailing\r\n  or only long curves in turning.\r\n\r\n  “During my work I had a few carping critics that I silenced\r\n  by this standing offer: If they would deposit a thousand\r\n  dollars I would cover it on this proposition. I would fasten a\r\n  150-pound sack of sand in the rider’s seat, make the necessary\r\n  adjustments, and send up an aëroplane upside down with a\r\n  balloon, the aëroplane to be liberated by a time fuse. If the\r\n  aëroplane did not immediately right itself, make a flight, and\r\n  come safely to the ground, the money was theirs.\r\n\r\n  “Now a word in regard to the fatal accident.[47] The\r\n  circumstances are these: The ascension was given to entertain a\r\n  military company in which were many of Maloney’s friends, and\r\n  he had told them he would give the most sensational flight they\r\n  ever heard of. As the balloon was rising with the aëroplane,\r\n  a guy rope dropping switched around the right wing and broke\r\n  the tower that braced the two rear wings and which also gave\r\n  control over the tail. We shouted Maloney that the machine was\r\n  broken but he probably did not hear us, as he was at the same\r\n  time saying ‘Hurrah for Montgomery’s air ship,’ and as the\r\n  break was behind him, he may not have detected it. Now did he\r\n  know of the breakage or not, and if he knew of it did he take a\r\n  risk so as not to disappoint his friends? At all events, when\r\n  the machine started on its flight the rear wings commenced to\r\n  flap (thus indicating they were loose), the machine turned on\r\n  its back and settled a little faster than a parachute. When\r\n  we reached Maloney he was unconscious and lived only thirty\r\n  minutes. The only mark of any kind on him was a scratch from a\r\n  wire on the side of his neck. The six attending physicians were\r\n  puzzled at the cause of his death. This is remarkable for a\r\n  vertical descent of over 2,000 feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        ADVENT OF PUBLIC FLYING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Mr. Ernest Archdeacon stimulated by a conference with Mr.\r\nChanute, at a meeting of the Aëro Club of France, founded a prize of\r\n3,000 francs to be awarded to the first person who should sail or\r\nfly 25 meters, with a maximum descent not exceeding one third of the\r\nrange. As yet no one in either hemisphere had flown in a practical\r\nmachine, but various aviators were industriously pluming their wings.\r\nCaptain Ferber had been a follower of Lilienthal since 1898, and a\r\npupil of Mr. Chanute since 1891. Dozens of votaries in France, not\r\nto mention other countries, had entered, or were about to enter, the\r\naviation field. Archdeacon himself, Voisin, Blériot, Esnault-Pélterie,\r\nVuia, Delagrange, Tatin, Cornu, Bazin, Levavasseur and many others,\r\nwere stanch apostles of the heavier than air. Many of these were\r\ndisciples of Lilienthal, but they were destined all to be distanced\r\nby an impetuous Hensonite, who could not realize the necessity for\r\nspending months, or years, cautiously coasting downhill to acquire the\r\nadroitness requisite to speed a flying chariot over the plain.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, while many aviators in Europe were developing flyers, and\r\ncautiously testing them in various ways, by gliding above sand or\r\nwater, or swinging from a high wire or traveling arm, Señor Alberto\r\nSantos-Dumont, of Brazil, brought forth in France the quaint and crude\r\nbiplane shown in Plate XXII. Aërodynamically this was not a great\r\nimprovement on the aëroplane of Sir George Cayley constructed 98 years\r\nearlier; but it had a petrol motor whose power and lightness would\r\nhave astounded that talented pioneer in aviation. The motor was an\r\neight-cylinder Antoinette, weighing 170 pounds and developing 50 horse\r\npower. The screw, formed of two aluminum blades, was of two meters\r\ndiameter, one meter pitch, mounted on the engine shaft, and, at 1,500\r\nrevolutions a minute, gave a thrust of 330 pounds. The total lifting\r\nsurface of the aëroplane was 650 square feet, and the weight, including\r\npilot, 645 pounds. This bird-shaped craft ran tail foremost through the\r\nair, having the screw at the rear, and the rider in a small basket just\r\nbefore the wings. By means of a pilot-wheel and lever, he could operate\r\nthe “tail,” i. e., the front rudder, sidewise and vertically, thus\r\nsteering the craft in two directions. The lateral balance was preserved\r\nautomatically by means of the dihedral inclination of the wings, aided\r\nsometimes by the rider swaying his weight to right or left.\r\n\r\nAfter some days of preliminary adjustment and trial, Santos-Dumont was\r\nready for a dash in his new aëromobile. On August 22d, 1906, he made\r\na brief tentative flight, the first witnessed in Europe since Ader’s\r\nsurreptitious experiment. On October 23d, he ran this strange machine\r\nswiftly over the ground and glided boldly into the air, flying above\r\nthe excited spectators at a speed of 25 miles an hour, and covering\r\na distance of 200 feet, thus gaining the Archdeacon cup. Again on\r\nNovember 12th, 1906, he made four flights, the last one covering 220\r\nmeters in twenty-one seconds, thus gaining the prize of 1,500 francs\r\noffered by the Aëro Club of France for the first person who should fly\r\n100 meters. The demonstration was made before the general public and\r\ntechnical witnesses, including an official committee of the Aëro Club\r\nof France, who reported that the aëroplane preserved good balance and a\r\ntrue soaring speed independent of the acquired momentum.\r\n\r\nIntrinsically the achievements of November 12th were crude and\r\nprimitive; but in moral effect they were very important. They marked\r\nthe inception of public aëroplaning before the professional and lay\r\nworld alike. There was no patent mechanism to conceal, no secret to\r\nwithhold from rivals, such as had shrouded the work of more circumspect\r\naviators in Europe and America. If Santos-Dumont was not the first to\r\nfly, he was the first aëroplane inventor to give his art to the world,\r\nand to inaugurate true public flying in presence of technical men, as\r\nhe had initiated modern motor ballooning. His liberal enthusiasm and\r\nthat of his colleagues, both aëroplanists and patrons, quickly made\r\nFrance the world’s foremost theater of aviation, at least for the\r\nmoment. The contagion would of course spread swiftly, and involve the\r\nentire civilized world.\r\n\r\nSantos-Dumont’s unconventional dash into the air sounded the knell of\r\nLilienthalism. This slow method served to pass time profitably in the\r\nnineties, while the gasoline motor was still developing. But with an\r\n_Antoinette_ in hand, what live man, particularly what live Frenchman,\r\ncould tinker long years on the sand hills? Why not mount the craft\r\non little wheels and take a cautious little run; then after some\r\nadjustment, make more runs followed by innocuous saltatory flights?\r\nThis would be so easy, so fascinating, so instructive. How much better\r\nthan to make two thousand preliminary jumps down the hill slope\r\nwith the body dangling wildly to keep the balance, then to redesign\r\nthe entire frame before an engine could be successfully applied!\r\nAn _Antoinette_ motor, placed on a competently designed Henson\r\naëroplane, would have obviated the whole Lilienthal school. However,\r\nthey did noble and opportune work, while awaiting the growth of the\r\ngasoline engine. This school achieved success by a roundabout method\r\nbecause Henson’s method was not available till the present century,\r\nfor want of a cheap, light motor. When that appeared Lilienthalism\r\nquickly subsided. In other words, Lilienthal’s method was a passing\r\nconvenience, never a necessity. It could have been employed very\r\nprofitably in Cayley’s time to develop the art of gliding and soaring;\r\nbut in the time of Santos-Dumont and his colleagues, flying by Henson’s\r\nmethod would have burst upon the world by reason of its superior value\r\nand the allied progress, even if the Lilienthal school had never\r\nexisted. This is illustrated by the fact that Santos-Dumont succeeded\r\nwithout aid from the sand-hill votaries.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS-DUMONT’S BIPLANE.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS-DUMONT’S _DEMOISELLE_.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy A. J. Moisant.)]\r\n\r\nThe next daring aëroplanist to arouse the world of aviation was Henri\r\nFarman, also a votary of the wheel-mounted flyer. He had been an adept\r\nmotorist, therefore accustomed to brisk driving. In the summer of\r\n1907 he received from the Voisin brothers the aëroplane illustrated\r\nin Plate XXIII. With this he made a number of preliminary flights\r\nduring the autumn, proving that his aëroplane had suitable stability\r\nand motive power. On October 26th, on the government drill grounds at\r\nIssy-les-Moulineaux he surpassed Santos-Dumont’s record, by flying\r\n771 meters. But this was to him of minor importance; he was preparing\r\nto win the Deutsch-Archdeacon prize of 50,000 francs offered for the\r\nfirst person who should fly one kilometer over a returning course.\r\nOn January 12th, he convoked a committee of the Aëro Club of France\r\nto witness a trial on the morrow. Next morning at ten o’clock, the\r\nweather being calm and clear, his great machine ran a hundred yards\r\nacross the course, then rose gracefully into the air, and sailed away\r\nfor the 500-meter post. Here, making a wide curve, it rounded safely\r\nand returned, passing the home line in elegant flight, thus winning the\r\ngrand prize.\r\n\r\nThe machine with which Farman achieved his first success, and which\r\nbroadly resembles his subsequent triumphal flyers, seems to be a cross\r\nbetween a Hargrave kite and a Chanute glider, having a Maxim horizontal\r\nsteering plane in front. As shown in the figure it was mounted on\r\nfour bicycle wheels; was steered up and down by the front plane, and\r\nsidewise by the box rudder seen in the rear. The rider seated between\r\nthe large supporting surfaces, and in front of his engine, operated\r\nthese rudders separately, by pushing or rotating a pilot wheel, and\r\nabetted the automatic lateral balance by swaying his body. The machine\r\nspread 559 square feet of sustaining surface, weighed 1,100 pounds\r\nand carried a 50-horse-power _Antoinette_ motor actuating a single\r\ntwo-blade aluminum propeller 6.9 feet in diameter by 3.6 feet pitch,\r\ndirectly connected to the engine shaft. The stability in mild weather\r\nwas so great that Farman, during his first few weeks’ practice, made\r\nover 200 flights, measuring in length from 100 to 500 yards, without\r\nserious mishap. In gusty weather, however, his machine was defective\r\nin steadiness, and unsafe near the ground. This objection was remedied\r\nlater by adding flexible wing margins for controlling the lateral\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nThe age of prize flying was thus fairly ushered in by the feeble but\r\nvery important public demonstrations of Santos-Dumont and Henri Farman.\r\nOther public flyers would quickly follow. Delagrange, Blériot, Curtiss\r\nwould soon become international figures, not to mention numerous more\r\nrecent aviators. They, were men of originality, skill and energy,\r\nwho would shortly be in the front line contesting for world laurels,\r\nand winning them gloriously.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMAN BIPLANE, 1908.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMAN BIPLANE, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARMON IN FARMAN BIPLANE.]\r\n\r\nLeon Delagrange, the sculptor-inventor, who first had demonstrated\r\nthe biplane, on March 30, 1907, aspired in 1908 to outfly Farman.\r\nHe now practiced industriously on the military drill ground at\r\nIssy-les-Moulineaux, a large field which the Minister of War permitted\r\nthe Aëro Club of France to use for such purpose. Here he and Farman,\r\nin friendly competition, flew day by day over gradually increasing\r\ncourses. At times they were joined by other aviators, and thus the\r\ndrill grounds at Issy became famous as an aviation school.\r\n\r\nFarman’s new rival made startling progress during those frequent trials\r\nof March, 1908. “Just imagine,” he says, “that within a week I was\r\nable to complete my education as an aviator.” On March 17th he made an\r\nofficial flight of 269.6 meters, thus winning a prize of 200 francs\r\noffered by the Aëro Club of France for a beginner who should fly over\r\n200 meters. Four days later he engaged in contest with Farman. Two\r\npoles were erected 500 meters apart to mark the points about which the\r\nmen must race. The machines were brought forth from their sheds in\r\nthe morning, gleaming dimly through a dense fog, and were given some\r\npreliminary trials. Then Farman made a flight of 2004.8 meters, going\r\ntwice around the course in 3 minutes, 31 seconds. He thus trebled his\r\ngrand prize flight of January. Presently Delagrange took wing and flew\r\n1,500 meters in 2.5 minutes. Having been beaten by Farman, he invited\r\nhis successful rival to take a seat behind him, and the two sailed away\r\nclose to the ground, covering a distance of 50 meters. This was the\r\nfirst trip ever made by two men in one flying machine. For the first\r\ntime also two machines had flown in competition over a considerable\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nDelagrange continued to pursue Farman for the championship. On April\r\n11th, he flew 2,500 meters, and would have exceeded Farman’s official\r\nrecord of 2,004 meters, had he not touched the ground. The next day\r\nhe summoned the official committee of the Aëro Club of France to\r\nwitness and time his performance. Poles were erected at the corners\r\nof a triangle 350, 200, 275 feet apart respectively. Around this\r\ncourse he flew nearly five times, covering a distance of 5,575 meters\r\nin 9¼ minutes. Of this range the last 3,925 meters were covered\r\nwithout touching the ground. Thus at last he had out-flown Farman and\r\nestablished a new official record, the total distance actually covered\r\nbeing about ten kilometers, or approximately six miles. This ended,\r\nat least temporarily, the friendly competition at Issy; for now the\r\naviators separated, Farman going to Belgium, Delagrange to Italy.\r\n\r\nDelagrange’s fortune accompanied him abroad. On May 24th, he made some\r\nimpressive demonstrations on the Place d’Armes at Rome in presence of\r\nthe Minister of War and thirty thousand people. On May 27th, he flew\r\nbefore the King and Queen of Italy and many other court personages,\r\nremaining in the air nine and one half minutes, thus surpassing all\r\nprevious European records for endurance and distance. But this was\r\nonly preliminary. On the morning of May 30th, he came forth again on\r\nthe Place d’Armes, a light breeze blowing. His machine rolled quickly\r\nover the ground, then circled gracefully ten times around in the air\r\nat a height of four to seven meters, covering an official distance of\r\n12.75 kilometers, and remaining aloft 15 minutes, 26 seconds. On June\r\n22d, at Milan, he flew before 15,000 people in the Place d’Armes,\r\ncovering seventeen kilometers in 16 minutes, 30 seconds. Finally, on\r\nSeptember 6th, at Issy-les-Moulineaux, he flew 29 minutes, 54 seconds,\r\ncovering 14.8 miles, which proved his crowning effort for the year. As\r\nthe two flights just mentioned surpassed all previous official ones\r\nin duration, it appears that Delagrange raised the world’s record\r\nfour times within five months, increasing his own time from six and a\r\nhalf minutes in April to about thirty minutes in September, or nearly\r\nfivefold.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Farman was making rapid progress, gathering prizes and\r\nachieving wide renown. On May 30th, at Ghent, Belgium, taking with him\r\nM. Archdeacon, he flew 1,241 meters at a height of seven meters. He\r\nthus established a new record with two people, and won the 1,200 franc\r\nwager made with Santos-Dumont and Archdeacon against M. Charron, who\r\ncontended that a flying machine would not, within the year, carry two\r\nmen weighing sixty kilograms each. On June 6th he flew 20 minutes, 20\r\nseconds, covering 19.7 kilometers, thus again increasing the world’s\r\nrecord, and winning the Armengaud prize of ten thousand francs for the\r\nfirst aviator to remain aloft fifteen minutes in France. On September\r\n29th and October 2d, at Chalons, he successively increased the world’s\r\nrecord, and achieved his best results for the year. The first of these\r\ntrials lasted 42 minutes, covering 24.5 miles; the second lasted 44.5\r\nminutes, covering 25 miles. This last flight was forty times as long as\r\nthe one of January, which gave him the grand prize of fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, and is a good index of the wonderful progress in aviation\r\nmade in France during the year 1908. Between these two performances\r\nhe, on September 30th, sailed from Chalons to Rheims, a distance of\r\n27 kilometers, in twenty minutes. This flight was made over trees\r\nand houses, sometimes at an elevation of 200 feet, and was the first\r\ntown-to-town flight ever accomplished. The following day he won the 500\r\nfranc prize for height, passing over balloons 82 feet from the ground.\r\nSuch was the lively pace Farman set for the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Curtiss drifted into the business of building and operating air\r\nships and flying machines by frequent association with inventors, who\r\ncame to his bicycle works at Hammondsport, N. Y., for assistance in the\r\ndesign and construction of aërial craft. He was particularly sought as\r\na constructor of propelling mechanism, for he had special skill and\r\nexperience in producing light gasoline engines. As a motor expert he\r\nwas invited to the laboratory of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, at Beinn\r\nBreagh, near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in the summer of 1907. Dr. Bell had\r\ndeveloped his wonderfully light, strong and stable tetrahedral kites\r\nto such an extent that he wished to convert them into “aërodromes” by\r\napplying light propelling mechanism. He accordingly invited two young\r\nCanadian engineers, F. W. Baldwin and J. A. D. McCurdy, to consult\r\nwith him regarding the structural details of his proposed flyer,\r\nand contracted with Mr. Curtiss to supply the motive power. These\r\ngentlemen with Lieutenant T. Selfridge, a guest of Dr. Bell, developed\r\nso many independent ideas that Mrs. Bell suggested the advantage of\r\nforming themselves into a scientific organization, at the same time\r\noffering the capital required for experimentation. Acting on this\r\nadvice and generous offer, they formed themselves into the now famous\r\nAërial Experiment Association, whose object was the construction of a\r\npractical aëroplane, driven through the air by its own motive power,\r\nand carrying a man.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _RED WING_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS BIPLANE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS BIPLANE WITH PONTOONS.]\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary downhill glides[48] and studies with a motorless\r\naëroplane, the association, on March 12, 1908, brought forth their\r\nfirst dynamic machine, the _Red Wing_, shown in Plate XXIV, in order\r\nto speed it along the ice of Lake Keuka, near Curtiss’s factory; the\r\npurpose being, not to fly, but to test the effect of the vertical\r\nrudder. To the surprise of the twenty-five onlookers, the machine,\r\nafter running two hundred feet along the ice, serenely rose into the\r\nair and flew 319 feet. “This,” says Dr. Bell, “was the first public\r\nexhibition of the flight of a heavier-than-air machine in America.”\r\nIt is noteworthy also that this machine was completed and ready for\r\ntrial in less than seven weeks from the time of starting. Its design,\r\nwhile embodying suggestions from each member of the association, was\r\nattributed chiefly to Lieutenant Selfridge, who took the leading part\r\nin evolving the plans, and who gave them his final approval, it being\r\nthe intention of the association to offer each man a chance to produce\r\na flying machine after his own notions, aided by the experience and\r\nliberal advice of his fellows.\r\n\r\nAs the advantage of flying from the ice had been suggested some years\r\nbefore the death of Lilienthal, it seems remarkable that this method\r\ndid not yield important results earlier in the development of aviation.\r\nA smooth ice field is such an ideal place for testing a dynamic\r\naëroplane, that previous gliding experience would seem unnecessary,\r\nproviding the machines were designed with a fair knowledge of the\r\nelementary principles of stability and control. Even glider practice\r\ncould be effectively conducted over a smooth ice field after momentum\r\nhad been acquired by aid of gravity, or a tow line. Having sufficient\r\nmomentum the aviator could test his rudders cautiously without rising,\r\nthen, after a little experience, make short glides in the air, and so\r\nbe prepared to install the motor. Landing or falling on smooth ice at\r\ngreat horizontal speed, from a low elevation, is much less hurtful than\r\ntumbling on the ground, as every bold skater knows from experience.\r\n\r\nThe aëroplane II, designed by Mr. Baldwin, aided by his associates\r\nand their combined experience, resembled that of Lieutenant Selfridge\r\nin the trussing of its body surfaces, but was mounted on wheels, and\r\nprovided with torsional wing tips for lateral control. When tested, it\r\nwas found easy to launch and land, besides responding very promptly to\r\nthe three-rudder control. In the hands of Mr. Curtiss, on May 22d, this\r\naëroplane, called the _White Wing_, flew 1,017 feet in 19 seconds, and\r\nlanded smoothly on a plowed field. This at the time was the longest\r\nflight ever made by an aviator in his first trip on a heavier-than-air\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIt was now Mr. Curtiss’ turn to be captain of design and construction.\r\nUnder his supervision aëroplane III, called the _June Bug_, was ushered\r\nforth, in the month of honeymoons. It differed from the two preceding\r\nin having a box tail; also in having a nainsook cover, instead of the\r\nred and white silk that characterized the _Red Wing_ and the _White\r\nWing_.\r\n\r\nAfter some practice, this flyer behaved so well that it seemed\r\ncompetent to win the Scientific American Cup offered for a public\r\nflight of one kilometer straight away. Accordingly an official trial\r\nwas arranged with a committee of the Aëro Club of America, for the\r\nfourth of July, 1908. It was the first official flight in the western\r\nhemisphere, and proved in every way most satisfactory. The machine\r\nflew 2,000 yards over an S-shaped course at a speed of 39 miles an\r\nhour, displayed admirable control, and had abundant motive power. The\r\nperformance was an intimation and augury of the victorious flights to\r\ncome the following year. As the Association now repaired to Dr. Bell’s\r\nsummer home, the Hammondsport experiments terminated for the season.\r\n\r\nThe year 1908 also brought to happy fruition the long and persistent\r\nexperiments of Louis Blériot, the most illustrious pioneer and\r\nchampion of the monoplane. Beginning in 1900, he had tried one type\r\nafter another, of flying machine, till he became world renowned for\r\nhis fertility of invention, his daring, his picturesque accidents and\r\nhairbreadth escapes. So long as he was not killed he was certain to\r\nmake progress; for he had every endowment that ensures success. He\r\npossessed the energy of early manhood, having been born in 1872; he\r\nhad the thorough technical training of the Central School of Arts and\r\nManufactures, where he graduated in 1895; he possessed extraordinary\r\ntalent for invention and constructional detail; he had the prowess,\r\ncourage and coolness requisite for testing intractable and dangerous\r\nflyers; he was in the world’s most active center of aviation; he\r\nalso had sufficient means. If he was late in achieving success, it\r\nwas because he preferred to develop original ideas, and could not be\r\ncontent with merely copying his predecessors.\r\n\r\nLike many other novices in aviation, Blériot began by trying to build\r\na machine with flapping wings that should fly like a bird. This was to\r\nbe actuated by a carbonic acid motor. In 1904 he abandoned his first\r\nmachine, of bird type, and turned to aëroplanes, beginning with a\r\nbiplane of the Farman, or Voisin type. His second machine was built by\r\nGabriel Voisin, one of the most experienced of the pioneer aëroplane\r\nmanufacturers. This biplane, unprovided with an engine, was mounted\r\non floats, towed along the Seine by a motor boat, and rose from the\r\nsurface carrying Voisin as pilot. _Blériot III_, composed of elliptical\r\ncells, or sustaining surfaces, and powered with two _Antoinette_\r\nmotors of 25 horse power each, was tested without success on Lake\r\nEnghien during the year 1905-6. _Blériot IV_ was made of quadrangular\r\ncells, and launched at Bagatelle in 1906, carrying a soldier, Peyret;\r\nbut crashed to earth in its first trial. Finally in 1907, _Blériot\r\nV_, mounted by the inventor himself, rose into the air and flew\r\nsuccessfully, but was lacking in stability. His sixth aëroplane was\r\nof the Langley type, provided with a 24-horse-power motor, then with\r\na 50-horse-power _Antoinette_; but it was unstable fore and aft. One\r\nday it traversed 184 meters, then fell from a height of 25 meters and\r\nwas shattered on the ground. His seventh was one of the swiftest yet\r\nconstructed, attaining a speed of nearly 80 kilometers an hour, and, in\r\ntwo private trials, covering a distance of 500 meters. Thus seven years\r\nhad slipped away, leaving Blériot still in the tentative period of his\r\nwork. But now he was at the threshold of a career of brilliant success,\r\nwhich soon brought him the highest honors at home and throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAfter various minor flights in the spring and summer of 1908, Blériot,\r\non October 31st of that eventful year in aviation, determined to\r\nattempt a cross country voyage, as Farman had done the day before. As\r\nwill be remembered, Farman had flown from Chalons to Rheims, above\r\ntrees and houses, a distance of nearly 17 miles, thus achieving the\r\nfirst town-to-town flight in history. Blériot would improve that record\r\nat once, by flying in a closed circuit embracing several villages.\r\n\r\nHis renowned cross-country flight was directed from Toury to Artenay, a\r\nvillage nine miles distant. Mounting his aëroplane _VIII-ter_, at mid\r\nafternoon, in presence of a large gathering, Blériot followed the\r\ncourse shown in Fig. 40. In the neighborhood of Artenay he landed for a\r\nfew minutes. After some slight repairs to his magneto, he reascended,\r\nturned about and headed for home. Half way on his return course he\r\nstopped again for a few minutes, at the Village of Santilly; then\r\nreadily reascended and flew to the neighborhood of his starting point.\r\nHe thus traveled about 17 miles in a closed circuit. This performance,\r\nwith that of Farman the day before, inaugurated the period of aërial\r\nvoyages in heavier-than-air machines. It appealed so powerfully to the\r\nsentiment of the community that a monument was erected at Toury to\r\ncommemorate the glorious achievement.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLÉRIOT FLYING OVER TOURY-ARTENAY CIRCUIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLÉRIOT MONOPLANE _NO. VIII_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLÉRIOT MONOPLANE _NO. IX_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—BLÉRIOT’S TOURY-ARTENAY AËROPLANE CIRCUIT,\r\n1908.]\r\n\r\nA fair view of the famous monoplane, in its renowned cross-country\r\nvoyage, is presented in Plate XXV. It consisted of a single sustaining\r\nsurface firmly attached to a long trussed spine mounted on three\r\nwheels, and carrying at its front end the gasoline motor and propeller,\r\nat its rear end two of the rudders, the third, or lateral, rudder\r\nbeing placed at the wing terminals. A part of the trussed frame was\r\ncovered, to minimize the atmospheric resistance against the framing,\r\npilot and engine. The vertical rudder at the rear turned the machine\r\nto right or left; the horizontal rear rudder controlled the elevation\r\nand pitching of the machine; the torsional wing tips controlled the\r\nlateral stability, and could be used to cant the aëroplane or check its\r\nlisting, as in the Wright and Curtiss machines. The craft exhibited an\r\neasy poise in the air, and possessed good equilibrium, owing to its\r\narrowlike structure and its three-rudder system of control. It was a\r\nstrong rival of the biplanes previously noticed, and a herald of better\r\nthings to come.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Wright brothers had resumed their field practice.\r\nDuring the month of May, 1908, they tested their famous aëroplane of\r\n1905, provided with increased engine power, and carrying two passengers\r\nupright. A few brief flights were made at speeds of 41 to 44 miles an\r\nhour, showing that all the mechanism was adequate and effective. But on\r\nMay 14th a false push on a lever, made by Wilbur Wright, brought the\r\nflyer to earth, wrecking it too badly to be repaired in the few days\r\navailable for experimentation. These flights were but preliminary to\r\nthe official trials set for the approaching summer; for the brothers\r\nhad contracted to furnish one machine to the United States Signal\r\nCorps, another to a French syndicate.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Signal Officer of the United States Army in December, 1907,\r\nhad issued specifications, and invited bids, for a flying machine\r\napparently far in advance of the art. The flyer was to carry two men\r\naggregating 350 pounds, was to remain aloft one hour continuously, and\r\nwas to maintain an average speed of 40 miles an hour in a cross-country\r\nflight to and fro, covering a distance of ten miles. The contractor\r\nmust instruct two officers to operate the flyer. Furthermore the\r\nmachine must be capable of flying 125 miles without stopping. The\r\nrequirements seemed severe, even to those well versed in aviation.\r\nNevertheless two bids were received; one from the Wright brothers for a\r\nbiplane to cost $25,000, another from Mr. A. M. Herring for a biplane\r\ncosting $20,000. Both bids were accepted for the summer of 1908; but\r\nonly the Wright contract was eventually carried out.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Dayton inventors had sold their patent rights\r\nin France to a syndicate in that country. The contract specified\r\na machine for two passengers, having a speed of 50 kilometers an\r\nhour, and a range of 125 miles. Furthermore, the inventors agreed to\r\ninstruct three pupils to manage the aëroplane. The fulfillment of\r\nthese two contracts occupied some months, but presented no formidable\r\ndifficulties. Though neither of the brothers had ever flown an hour,\r\nand though both were comparatively unskilled as operators, they had\r\nsuch faith in their invention that they undertook to launch themselves\r\npublicly in untried machines, Wilbur Wright in France, Orville in\r\nAmerica, at about the same time.\r\n\r\nOf these two tests, the one conducted by Orville Wright at Fort Myer,\r\nnear Washington, was the most successful at first. After a few brief\r\npreliminary trips, he suddenly astonished the world by phenomenal\r\nflying. On the morning of September 9, 1908, he made a voyage above\r\nthe drill ground lasting 57 minutes, 31 seconds, and again in the\r\nevening another flight lasting one hour and three minutes, this time\r\nbefore a throng of distinguished spectators. Immediately thereafter\r\nhe took aboard Lieut. Frank P. Lahm for a flight of six minutes’\r\nduration. These records were improved day by day, and all things\r\nseemed propitious for the official tests of speed and endurance.\r\nBut on September 17th, while sailing with Lieutenant Selfridge at a\r\nheight of about 75 feet, a blade of the right-hand propeller struck\r\nand loosened a stay wire of the rear rudder. Instantly the wire coiled\r\nabout the blade, snapping it across the middle. Thereupon the machine\r\nbecame difficult to manage, and plunged headlong to earth, throwing the\r\nmen with their faces on the bare ground, fatally wounding Lieutenant\r\nSelfridge, and seriously injuring Mr. Wright. Lieutenant Selfridge did\r\nnot recover consciousness, and died within three hours, from wounds\r\non the forehead and concussion of the base of the brain. Mr. Wright\r\nsuffered a fracture of the left thigh and of two ribs on the right\r\nside. The aëroplane was badly shattered in its framing, but the engine\r\nwas practically intact. This accident terminated the tests for the\r\nseason; but ere long a date was set for their resumption during the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRIGHT BIPLANE OF 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STANDARD WRIGHT BIPLANE OF 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRIGHT RACING BIPLANE OF 1910.]\r\n\r\nWilbur Wright began his demonstration for the French syndicate on the\r\nplain of Auvours, ten miles from Le Mans, France, on August 8,\r\n1908. For some weeks his flights were very brief, owing to the balky\r\ncondition of his engine; but this difficulty was removed by the middle\r\nof September. After the accident to his brother he remained inactive\r\nfor a few days; then, to reassure his supporters, he raised the world’s\r\nrecord by flying a distance of over 52 miles, remaining aloft 1 hour,\r\n31 minutes, 25 seconds. After this he continued at frequent intervals\r\nto make long flights, quite usually taking a passenger with him, and on\r\nseveral occasions a lady. His endurance, his altitude, his abandon and\r\nperfect control amazed and delighted Europe. Incidentally he won some\r\nvaluable prizes, beating the French records for duration, distance and\r\nelevation. Once he rose to a height of 380 feet. On September 21st, he\r\nflew 42 miles in 1 hour and 31 minutes; on October 11th, he carried a\r\npassenger an hour and ten minutes; finally on the last day of the year\r\nhe flew 77 miles in two hours and twenty minutes, thus winning the\r\nmuch coveted Michelin prize, of twenty thousand francs for the longest\r\ndistance flown during the year. It was a triumphal close to the most\r\nprogressive and eventful year in aviation—the first year of exhibition\r\nflying, the inaugural year of a noble art.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the speed and distance tests at Le Mans by the close\r\nof the year 1908, Wilbur Wright went to Pau, in the South of France,\r\nfor the winter practice with his three pupils, Count de Lambert, Paul\r\nTissandier and Alfred Leblanc. Here on the vast trial grounds at Pont\r\nLong, six miles from Pau, he had a commodious hangar with a workshop\r\non one side, and on the other, apartments for the aviator and his\r\nmechanics. He arrived with his pupils, on January 14th, and next day\r\nwas joined by his brother and sister, who had followed him from Paris,\r\nOrville being now well recovered from his injuries received at Fort\r\nMyer. In a short time the machine was set up, and early in February\r\nbegan its regular service, having a pair of levers for the teacher and\r\nanother pair for the passenger. The pupils quickly acquired the art of\r\nsteering, being first allowed to control one lever, with Mr. Wright\r\nholding the other; then being entrusted to manage the whole machine,\r\nwith their tutor as passenger; and finally becoming themselves teachers\r\nof the newly acquired art. Only a few hours’ practice was needed to\r\nattain proficiency, the whole time in the air aggregating hardly half a\r\nday for each pupil, though the lessons extended over many days.\r\n\r\nA pleasant feature of the sojourn at Pau and Le Mans was the number\r\nand character of the visitors, and the boundless enthusiasm displayed\r\ntoward the new art. Tens of thousands of people from the neighboring\r\nplaces, and tourists from many parts of the earth assembled to see the\r\nflights; statesmen, military officers, scientific and parliamentary\r\ndelegations, representatives of innumerable periodicals. Queen\r\nMargherita, having missed a flight on her first visit to Le Mans,\r\ncame a second time, and remained three hours standing on the field,\r\nfascinated by the wonderful aërial equipage. The King of Spain, Alfonso\r\nXIII, who visited the aërodrome at Pau, on February 20th, manifested\r\nthe keenest interest and delight in examining the aëroplane and seeing\r\nit fly; first with the pilot alone, then with an extra passenger. He\r\ntook a seat in the machine beside Mr. Wright, discussed its working,\r\nand expressed his deep regret that reasons of state prevented him from\r\nmaking an ascension. A month later the King of England, who was at\r\nBiarritz, adjourned to Pau, where he remained to witness two unusually\r\nfine flights. He expressed the greatest pleasure in the performance,\r\nquestioned the brothers about the details of the machine, and\r\ncomplimented them on their achievement.\r\n\r\nFrom Pau, Wilbur Wright went to Italy, about the end of March, to\r\nfulfill an engagement to give demonstrations and lessons in the use of\r\nthe biplane. He was welcomed at Rome by the King of Italy, on April 2d,\r\nand later gave a public exhibition of flying, to aid the sufferers in\r\nthe recent earthquake at Messina. His flights were attended with great\r\nenthusiasm, and his lessons in aviation were quickly mastered; his\r\npupil, Lieutenant Calderara, soon making public flights alone. A rare\r\nsight it was, this modern winged chariot soaring above the ruins of\r\nthat ancient campagna, bearing with it a moving-picture camera.\r\n\r\nBy the end of April Mr. Wright had finished his task in Italy, and was\r\njourneying homeward with his sister and brother by way of London, where\r\nthey enjoyed the hospitalities of the Aëronautical Society of Great\r\nBritain; and where, on May 3d, the brothers received the beautiful gold\r\nmedal of that famous society, the oldest aëronautical organization in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe return to America was primarily for the purpose of completing\r\nthe official tests at Fort Myer; but incidentally the brothers must\r\nfind time to receive new honors and ovations. While in the shop at\r\nDayton, working vigorously to complete a new aëroplane for the War\r\nDepartment, in the hope of finishing the demonstrations by June 28th,\r\nthe limit of their allotted month, they were showered with attentions\r\ntoo numerous for their comfort. They must drop their tools in order to\r\ngo to Washington to receive the gold medal of the Aëro Club of America\r\nfrom President Taft, at the White House, on June 10th. On June 17th\r\nthey must witness an elaborate demonstration in their honor at Dayton,\r\nwhere they received a gold medal from the city, another from the State,\r\nand another from the Federal Government. Finally late in June, they\r\narrived in Washington with the rehabilitated biplane, to make good\r\ntheir contract with the Signal Corps.\r\n\r\nThe early tests of this aëroplane were not an unmixed triumph for the\r\nWright brothers and their well-wishers. At first the machine failed to\r\nfly completely about the drill ground. It took the air with difficulty,\r\nand came to the earth on the first turn. Some lack of adjustment in the\r\nframe was suspected. The motor was accused of weakness. The launching\r\nweights[49] were too light. The brothers explained that a new flyer\r\nis like a new horse; the driver must learn his idiosyncrasies before\r\nattempting to show him off to advantage. They intimated also that\r\nthey would be pleased to have the great throng of prominent people,\r\nwho flocked daily to the drill ground, kept away until their flying\r\ninstrument was properly tuned for public performances. They discouraged\r\nsuperfluous attentions. The big legislators who ventured audaciously\r\nto peep into the sacred shed containing the marvelous machine, were\r\nhailed by the military guard, and unceremoniously marched across the\r\nline among the plain people. It was a dreadful shock to these mighty\r\nsignors, and many a fat lawmaker cursed audibly, vowing never to vote\r\na cent for flying squadrons. But still they haunted the drill ground\r\ndaily, despite the long journey and the late dinner; for they were\r\nfascinated by the untold and unconjecturable possibilities of the new\r\nart.\r\n\r\nJune 28th came quickly, obliging the patient aviators to beg another\r\nextension of time. They were granted thirty days longer, which seemed\r\nto them more than necessary; but in this judgment they were mistaken.\r\nOne accident after another delayed the consummation of their official\r\ntask of flying one hour above the field, then five miles across country\r\nand return. Finally, on July 27th, Orville Wright, who was making all\r\nthe flights, took with him Lieut. Frank P. Lahm, and sailed gloriously\r\nfor one hour, twelve minutes and forty seconds, before ten thousand\r\ndelighted spectators. It was an ideal summer evening, and all the\r\nmaneuvers were performed with excellent poise, security and grace. A\r\nnew world’s record was established. Now all the vast throng from the\r\nPresident and his cabinet to the simplest laborer, appreciating the\r\nachievement as a triumph for America and for humanity, burst forth into\r\nprolonged acclamation and applause.\r\n\r\nThe cross-country flight was next in order. The course from Fort\r\nMyer to Alexandria lay over scattered forests and a deep valley. The\r\nflight seemed a difficult and hazardous enterprise; but the brothers,\r\nconfiding in their machine, seemed to have little apprehension of\r\nfailure or peril. Indeed, they seemed most concerned about the bonus\r\nto be secured by flying at an average rate exceeding the contract\r\nspeed of 40 miles an hour; for each additional mile an hour would pay\r\nthem $2,500 above the normal price of the aëroplane. They accordingly\r\ndeclined to fly in any but very calm weather, no matter how vast the\r\ngathering of visitors, or how illustrious. They wished, of course, to\r\nexpedite the final and crucial test; but they could not always have\r\nideal conditions, and would not take undue chances. On the evening\r\nafter the endurance test the engine balked, owing to the clogging of a\r\nrubber pipe from the gasoline tank. Dusk came on, and the disappointed\r\ncrowd went home to a late dinner. The Secretary of War, who was\r\npresent, very kindly granted a third extension of time, covering the\r\nrest of the month. Next evening it was a trifle breezy. Wilbur Wright\r\nannounced that the flight could be made, but that the bonus would\r\nbe less than on a still evening; he would therefore wait for calmer\r\nweather. Twelve thousand people were turned away disappointed. There\r\nwas muttering among the impatient and warm of blood. It was remarked\r\nthat the War Department could easily drop these procrastinated\r\nexperiments and buy a practical aëroplane in the open market for\r\n$5,000. But the discommoded officers good-naturedly allowed the thrifty\r\nsons of Dayton to have their way in striving for a large bonus, beyond\r\nthe normal price of $25,000.\r\n\r\nOn the following evening the weather was clear and fairly still. All\r\nwas in readiness for the flight to Alexandria and return. Orville\r\nWright, taking with him Lieut. B. D. Foulois, circled the drill ground\r\non easy wing, then sailed directly across country for the captive\r\nballoon at Shuter’s Hill. In a few moments they vanished beyond the\r\nforest, and for a while even the most optimistic were doubtful of their\r\nsafety. At length they reappeared sailing homeward at very great speed.\r\nThe machine proudly circled the drill ground amid thunders of applause,\r\nand landed softly at the lower end, beyond the shed.\r\n\r\nThe multitude hastened to congratulate the aviators on their marvelous\r\nperformance. For everybody it was a scientific and national triumph;\r\nfor Wilbur Wright it was something more. With pencil and pad he quickly\r\ncomputed the bonus, surrounded by a wall of reporters. “Wise old\r\nWilbur,” remarked one, “he knows the worth of coin in a crude republic.\r\nWhile Fame blows her trumpet he counts the solid gain.” The figures\r\nshowed an average speed of 42.6 miles, making the bonus $5,000. The\r\nvoyage was one of the finest ever executed up to that date; it was\r\na glorious termination to a long and troublesome, but epoch-making\r\ndemonstration. Now there remained only the task of instructing two\r\nofficers to fly, and this was leisurely accomplished by Wilbur Wright\r\nin October.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Plate XXVI the Wright aëroplane used at Fort Myer in\r\nSeptember, 1908, was a twin screw biplane mounted on skids and having\r\nthe three-rudder system of control. The rear rudder turned the machine\r\nright or left, the front rudder raised or lowered it, the warping of\r\nthe wings controlled the lateral poise. The turning right or left\r\ncould be effected on level wing; but the inventors canted the machine\r\nsidewise, to obviate skidding, or sidewise gliding of the craft, due\r\nto centrifugal force. These three-rudder movements were performed by\r\nthree separate levers actuating suitable mechanism; but they could be\r\nperformed easily by a single lever having three separate movements, as\r\npreferred by some designers. The aëroplane in launching ran along a\r\nmonorail, accelerated by a towrope passing over pulleys, and attached\r\nto a falling weight comprising nearly a ton of iron. The dimensions of\r\nthe various parts are given as follows by Major George O. Squier,[50]\r\nthe officer in charge of the experiments:\r\n\r\n  “The aëroplane has two superposed main surfaces 6 feet apart\r\n  with a spread of 40 feet, and a distance of 6½ feet from front\r\n  to rear. The area of this double supporting surface is about\r\n  500 square feet. A horizontal rudder of two superposed plane\r\n  surfaces about 15 feet long and 3 feet wide is placed in front\r\n  of the main surfaces. Behind the main planes is a vertical\r\n  rudder formed of two surfaces trussed together about 5½ feet\r\n  long and one foot wide. The motor, which was designed by the\r\n  Wright brothers, has four cylinders and is water cooled. It\r\n  develops about 25 horse power at 1,400 r. p. m. There are two\r\n  wooden propellers 8½ feet in diameter which are designed to run\r\n  at about 400 r. p. m. The machine is supported on two runners\r\n  and weighs about 800 pounds.”\r\n\r\nOn the whole the demonstrations at Fort Myer in 1909 did not greatly\r\nenhance the prestige of aviation. They were attended by too many delays\r\nand accidents, and too much waiting for ideal weather. As a consequence\r\nthe guardians of the national purse were not clamoring for an aërial\r\nflotilla. Some few, no doubt, understood that the aëroplane could\r\nbrave more than a zephyr with safety; but the general public accepted\r\nthe demonstrations at their face value. The unthinking multitude did\r\nnot realize that with sufficient incentive, such as war presents,\r\nthe Wright brothers could repeat those brilliant flights, of the end\r\nof July, under more severe weather conditions. Fortunately, events\r\nwere transpiring elsewhere which vastly increased the popular fame\r\nand valuation of the new art. This refers more particularly to those\r\nstartling achievements in aviation abroad which were largely stimulated\r\nby competition and prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fort Myer flights the Wright brothers separated, Orville\r\ngoing to Germany to represent their interests and give demonstrations;\r\nWilbur exhibiting at the Hudson-Fulton celebration in New York, and\r\nteaching the Signal Corps officers to manipulate the newly purchased\r\ngovernment aëroplane. As usual, both achieved distinction in their new\r\nfields. At Potsdam, on October 2d, Orville Wright, after a ten-minute\r\nflight with Crown Prince Frederic William, ascended alone, mounting\r\nsteadily in circles for fifteen minutes, and reaching an elevation\r\nroughly estimated at 500 meters, after which he descended safely in\r\nfive minutes. On September 18th, he made a new record at Berlin by\r\ncarrying a passenger, Captain Englehardt, for 1 hour, 35 minutes and 47\r\nseconds. Wilbur Wright, on September 9th, flew from Governor’s Island,\r\nin New York harbor, to and around the Statue of Liberty, then returned\r\nto the point of departure. On October 4th, starting from the same\r\npoint, he flew over the waters of New York Bay and above the Hudson\r\nRiver to a point opposite Grant’s Tomb, then returned to Governor’s\r\nIsland, covering a distance of about 19½ miles in 33½ minutes. The\r\ntrip upward was made at an elevation of about 200 feet, through a\r\nstratum disturbed by vortices rising from the steamer smokestacks, and\r\neddies caused by the northeast wind blowing over the tall buildings.\r\nThe return was made at a level of 50 feet on the Jersey side of the\r\nriver where the air was less turbulent. He intended later in the day\r\nto make a long flight, but, owing to the bursting of a cylinder head,\r\nhe stopped his demonstrations and returned to Washington to finish\r\nhis instruction of the Signal Corps officers. This was easy routine,\r\nand it afforded opportunity to try the effect of transferring one of\r\nthe forward steering planes to the rear and applying it there as a\r\nfixed horizontal tail, as used by Voisin, Curtiss and others. The new\r\narrangement was reported to increase the longitudinal steadiness of the\r\naëroplane, and was used in subsequent Wright aëroplanes.\r\n\r\nThe brothers now ceased public flying for a while, to attend to the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing and selling their craft. They formed an\r\nAmerican company, enlarged their facilities for constructing machines,\r\nprocured grounds for training operators, and prepared generally to\r\nfill orders both for aëroplanes and for public exhibitions. Not the\r\nleast of their labor was to defend their patent claims, which they\r\nwished to be interpreted so broadly as practically to exclude all\r\nflyers whose lateral poise is controlled by changing the angle of\r\nincidence of the wings, or of lateral stabilizing planes. This was\r\nnot an easy undertaking, since the torsion wing was a well-known\r\ndevice, having been described many times in public print, and having\r\nfigured in earlier patents and experiments in various countries. To\r\nadd to the difficulty, their patent claims apply specifically to the\r\nwarping of normally flat sustaining surfaces, the warping of arched\r\nwings having been patented by Prof. J. J. Montgomery, whose invention\r\nantedates theirs.[51] However, if they produced no novel and radical\r\ninvention in aviation, they, like Santos-Dumont in aëronautics, were\r\nfirst to achieve some measure of practical success, by applying a light\r\nautomobile engine to a familiar machine in which former inventions\r\nand ideas were skillfully employed. On this ground of practical\r\nsuccess they strove for an interpretation broad enough to establish\r\na monopoly covering even Montgomery’s rights, which apparently they\r\nwere infringing. But when to this end they applied for a preliminary\r\ninjunction restraining Curtiss from using his system of control, and\r\nPaulhan from using Farman’s system, they were unable to convince the\r\ncourt of the justice of their petition, and the injunction suit was\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                     STRENUOUS COMPETITIVE FLYING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal allurements in aviation for 1909 were the prize offered\r\nfor the first flight across the English Channel, and the prizes to be\r\nwon at the world’s first aviation meet, scheduled for the last week\r\nin August of that year, at Rheims, France. The desire to win these\r\nhonors stimulated to livelier effort the most noted designers and\r\noperators of aëroplanes, all of whose machines were represented at the\r\ngreat tournament. It also brought into sudden prominence several new\r\naviators. Young men, little versed in the science or literature of\r\nflight, took to wing, and in a few days found themselves world-famous.\r\nAërial chauffeurs, skillful and daring, delighted vast throngs of\r\npeople, kept the cables warm with news, and incidentally filled their\r\npurses with money. Thus the trade of aëroplane jockey was one of the\r\ninteresting products of this eventful year.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the aviation season of 1909 brought forth many\r\nimprovements which seemed to augur well for the public demonstrations\r\nto follow. Hubert Latham, with the swallowlike _Antoinette_ monoplane,\r\ndesigned by Levavasseur, the inventor of the _Antoinette_ motor, began\r\nsoaring grandly in the sky and into fame. Paul Tissandier, on May 20th\r\nat Pau, established a new French record by flying 1 hour and 2 minutes.\r\nThe Voisin brothers were perfecting in detail their boxlike aëroplanes,\r\nnoted for inherent stability, and destined to achieve further renown\r\nduring the summer, under the dexterous hand of intrepid young Paulhan.\r\nThis new and daring young aviator, after a few practice flights, began\r\nmaking world records. On July 15th, he flew 1 hour, 7 minutes and\r\n19 seconds. On July 18th he made a new world’s record for altitude,\r\ndriving his Voisin aloft 150 meters at Douai. Impatient Roger Sommer,\r\nrejecting his own make of biplane, purchased a machine from Farman,\r\nand after a little practice, broke the world’s record for distance on\r\nAugust 7th, by flying at Chalons, 2 hours, 27 minutes, 15 seconds. Many\r\nothers were advancing in skill, and would erelong achieve excellent\r\nresults. Most strenuous of all, perhaps, were Curtiss and Blériot, the\r\nchampions of high speed, respectively in the biplane and monoplane, and\r\nFarman, the winner of large prizes.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of April, Henri Farman tested a new biplane of\r\nhis own design and manufacture, which proved very satisfactory. It\r\nresembled his former craft, but was provided with small balancing\r\nplanes hinged to the rear margins of the wings near their tips.\r\nThis machine, furthermore, was provided with both landing skids and\r\nwheels, the latter yielding to any unusual stress by means of elastic\r\nconnections, so that the skids took up the shock. With this improved\r\nbiplane, Farman beat his former records by flying continuously 1 hour,\r\n23 minutes, at Chalons, on July 19th. Four days later he made a new\r\ncross-country record by flying from the Chalons parade ground to Suppe,\r\nabout forty miles, in 1 hour and 5 minutes. These flights were gently\r\nsuggestive of what might be expected at Rheims the following month.\r\n\r\nDuring the opening period of the 1909 aëroplane season, Glenn H.\r\nCurtiss brought forth a new biplane, designed for the Aëronautic\r\nSociety of New York, with the coöperation of his new partner, Mr. A.\r\nM. Herring, and began active practice for various prizes at home and\r\nabroad. After some brief trials at Hammondsport, N. Y., he shipped his\r\naëroplane to Morris Park, in order to participate in the Aëronautic\r\nSociety’s first flight exhibition of the year. On June 26th he flew,\r\nbut without official witness, far enough to win one of the $250\r\nprizes offered to the Aëro Club of America by its president, Mr.\r\nCortlandt Field Bishop, for the first four persons who should fly one\r\nkilometer. He now wished to make an official flight for this prize\r\nand also for the Scientific American trophy, a beautiful engraved\r\nsilver cup—which he had won a year previously for the first public\r\nflight of one kilometer, made in America, but which now should go to\r\nthe person making the longest official flight of the year 1909, not\r\nunder 25 kilometers. But the Morris Park race track proved unsuitable\r\nfor such contest, being too restricted. He therefore took his biplane\r\nto Mineola, Long Island, where he could practice on a wide plain, and\r\npossibly make some new records. Here a triangular course 1.3 miles long\r\nwas staked off, and some short trial flights were made. Then Mr. C. M.\r\nManly, who was official timekeeper for the Aëro Club of America, was\r\nnotified that a trial for the prize would be made.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations near Mineola were most successful, and proved the\r\nbeginning of a brilliant summer for Mr. Curtiss. On July 17th he won in\r\nquick succession both of the prizes mentioned above. The trial for the\r\nsmaller prize began at 5.15 in the morning and lasted but 2½ minutes,\r\nfollowed 6 minutes later by the start for the coveted cup. In both\r\ncases the machine took the air with ease and grace, after a 200-foot\r\nrun over the rough marsh land. In the cup trial the first twelve\r\nturns, aggregating 25 kilometers, were accomplished in 33½ minutes,\r\nbut the machine continued for seven more rounds, and finally landed\r\nin excellent form, just 52½ minutes after it had crossed the starting\r\nline. The actual measured distance flown was 24.7 miles, but the true\r\ndistance traversed by the machine was probably 30 miles, making the\r\ntime speed between 30 and 40 miles per hour. This was slow, indeed, but\r\nthe control was satisfactory. Those who wished for high speed would\r\nfind it in the new aëroplane which Mr. Curtiss would presently take to\r\nRheims for the speed contest, in which he was to fly as sole champion\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe type of machine used by Mr. Curtiss in 1909 was a natural outgrowth\r\nof his previous ones, but very much perfected in power and finish. It\r\nwas a biplane mounted on a three-wheeled chassis, two wheels under the\r\nmain body and one well to the front, so as to prevent toppling forward.\r\nIt was propelled by a single screw at the rear, directly connected to\r\na water-cooled motor of the Curtiss make. Its flight was controlled\r\nby three rudders exerting torque respectively about the three axes of\r\nthe aëroplane, supplemented by two fixed keels, a vertical one in the\r\nfront and a horizontal one in the rear. Of the three rudders mentioned,\r\none in the rear turned the craft right and left, like a boat, one in\r\nthe front raised or lowered her, while the third or lateral rudder,\r\nconsisting of small horizontally pivoted planes between the wing-ends,\r\nand turning oppositely to each other, controlled the lateral poise.\r\nThese lateral rudders, or winglets, used by Curtiss, Farman and others,\r\nare commonly called _ailerons_.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _BLÉRIOT XI_ WITH MOISANT AVIATOR ON MEXICAN BORDER.]\r\n\r\n(Courtesy A. J. Moisant.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _BLÉRIOT XII._\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\nLouis Blériot with his two new machines, his _No. XI_ at Douay and his\r\n_No. XII_ at Issy-les-Moulineaux, practiced nearly every fine day in\r\nJune and July, making fast progress in the art, and achieving some\r\nnotable records. By warping the wings he could keep his balance better\r\nthan in former years, and dare more severe weather. On June 12th, he\r\nmade a straightaway flight of 820 feet in his _No. XII_, taking as\r\npassengers A. Santos-Dumont and A. Fournier, the entire weight being\r\n1,232 pounds. This was the first flight of three passengers in an\r\naëroplane. On June 25th, despite a strong wind, he circled in his _No.\r\nXII_ eleven times about the parade ground at Issy-les-Moulineaux in 15½\r\nminutes, maintaining excellent stability. Next day he made 30 circuits\r\nin 36 minutes, 55⅗ seconds, stopping finally because of spark failure\r\ndue to excess of oil. On July 4th, at the aëronautic meet at the Juvisy\r\nAërodrome, for sufferers from the earthquake in the south of France,\r\nhe flew in his _No. XI_ for 50 minutes, 8 seconds, at a height of 50\r\nto 80 feet, finally stopping because of feed trouble in his engine.\r\nThis flight was his second up to that date. On July 13th, he made a\r\nnew cross-country record by an early morning flight in his _No. XI_\r\nfrom Etampes to within eight miles of Orleans, stopping some minutes\r\nen route, to show the practicability of his monoplane. Thirty-five\r\nminutes after landing, his machine was taken apart and shipped back to\r\nhis factory at Neuilly, near Paris. After this record he received gold\r\nmedals from the Aëro Club of Great Britain and the Aëro Club of France.\r\nHe was also awarded the _Prix de Voyage_ of 14,000 francs, of which he\r\nhimself received 5,000 as pilot, 4,000 as constructor, while 3,000 went\r\nto the motor manufacturer and 2,000 to the propeller designer.\r\n\r\nThe monoplanes _No. XI_ and _No. XII_ represented Blériot’s most\r\nsuccessful types. They bore a family resemblance to his preceding\r\nmachines, but had a more vigorous lateral control due to warpage of\r\ntheir main surfaces instead of the wing-tips, as of old. Both were\r\nprovided with a single-screw propeller in front, and both were mounted\r\non three-wheeled chassis with shock absorbers. The larger machine, or\r\n_No. XII_, had a wing surface of 337 square feet; the smaller a surface\r\nof 151 square feet. The latter, on its historic cross-Channel trip,\r\ncarried a three-cylinder air-cooled Anzani engine.\r\n\r\nHubert Latham, in his beautiful _Antoinette_ monoplane, began to\r\nachieve distinction for himself and his admirably designed long-tailed\r\nflyer early in the spring, and, ere midsummer, was one of the favorite\r\nidols of the thronged aërodromes. He preferred a lofty course; he\r\ncut through the sky with the precision and grace of a winged-spear;\r\nhe fascinated the spectators by the steadiness of his sweep. The\r\nFrench reporters declare they saw him roll and light cigarettes in\r\nfull flight. Not only did he delight the artist, but he surprised the\r\nofficial measurer. Toward the end of May he established a new monoplane\r\nrecord by a flight lasting 37 minutes and 3 seconds. On the 5th of\r\nJune he flew continuously 1 hour, 7 minutes and 37 seconds, at a speed\r\nof 45 miles an hour. This was done in a wind and heavy rain which\r\ndrenched and blinded him, finally inducing him to come down. On June\r\n7th he carried a passenger, something new for a monoplane. In July he\r\nincreased the altitude record by flying 450 feet high. Next day he\r\nflew across country from Arras to Douai, 12½ miles, in 20 minutes.\r\nVery reasonably, therefore, he announced, his intention of sailing for\r\nEngland above the waters of the turbulent strait.\r\n\r\nThe _Antoinette_ monoplane resembled, at a distance, a long-winged\r\nfish with its head cut off and replaced by a screw-propeller. It had a\r\nskifflike body with the screw in front, followed by the _Antoinette_\r\nengine, then by the pilot’s seat, the tail part carrying fixed\r\nhorizontal and vertical fins and movable horizontal and vertical\r\nrudders. These rudders together with _ailerons_, or warping wings,\r\ncontrolled the poise in flight. The body was mounted on a light chassis\r\nhaving cushioned wheels, and a landing skid for absorbing shocks. The\r\nengine employed no carburetor, and was cooled by water which turned\r\nto steam in the engine jackets, condensed in tubes on the side of the\r\nprow, then was pumped back to the jackets.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXVIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ANTOINETTE_ MONOPLANE OF 1909.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ANTOINETTE_ MONOPLANE OF 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe cross-Channel prize, above mentioned, was a cash sum of one\r\nthousand pounds, offered by the _London Daily Mail_ for the first\r\nsuccessful flight from France to England. Many would fain have it,\r\nthough the voyage seemed dangerous, if not foolhardy. Of the various\r\naviators who coveted the prize, Latham and Blériot were the most\r\nstrenuous in competing for it. The bold boy tried first.\r\n\r\nHousing his aëroplane on the high cliff facing the Channel near Calais,\r\nLatham looked toward England, impatiently waiting for placid weather,\r\nand a chance to soar. The venture was hazardous. By some it was deemed\r\nrash, owing to the uncertainty of having to alight upon the water, if\r\nthe motor should fail. But the brave youth was less alarmed than the\r\nold aviators, who had no intention of competing with him. So, with a\r\nboy’s confidence, he brought forth his huge-winged _Antoinette_, on\r\nJuly 19th, skimmed along the ground, soared grandly above the high\r\ncliffs, and sped over the waters at a great elevation, as usual in his\r\naërial voyages.\r\n\r\nLatham’s flight was magnificent, but brief. Owing to spark failure\r\nand the stoppage of his motor six miles from the French shore, he\r\nsettled promptly, but skillfully, down upon the sea. When found by\r\nthe accompanying torpedo boat destroyer, detailed to follow him from\r\nCalais, he was seated on the aëroplane, serenely smoking, buoyed up by\r\nthe great hollow wings. He was quickly brought to shore, undaunted and\r\neager for another trial; but in the rescue his frail flyer was roughly\r\nhandled and very much wrecked.\r\n\r\nLouis Blériot now hurried to Calais eager to attempt the cross-Channel\r\nflight. Placing his little monoplane, _No. XI_, in a tent on a farm\r\nnear Calais, he waited an opportune moment to sail. On Sunday, July\r\n25th, he was routed from bed very early by his friend, Alfred LeBlanc,\r\nand taken forth all reluctant to the field, for preliminary practice\r\nbefore sunrise; for the weather was favorable and he should sail as\r\nsoon as the sun arose. Though suffering from a foot burned in a recent\r\naccident, he discarded his crutches and mounted his winged machine with\r\neager courage, remarking: “If I cannot walk I will show the world that\r\nI can fly.” For some minutes he circled about the ground where, even\r\nat that early hour, many scores of people were assembling. All was now\r\nin readiness; the flyer was in excellent trim, the pilot in buoyant\r\nspirits, and the torpedo boat destroyer, _Escopette_, well out at sea\r\nto escort her swift aërial charge as well as might be.\r\n\r\nThe moment of departure had come. Blériot, buttoned in his\r\nclose-fitting suit and hood, sat on his white-winged machine, headed\r\nfor the cliff, and surrounded by a group of well-wishers. At 4.35 the\r\nlight-wheeled craft with propeller whirring, sped along the ground,\r\nrose gracefully in the air and shot bravely over the precipice, with\r\nthe hustling aviator on its back. The admiring spectators were wild\r\nwith excitement and joy. But there was one sad group in Calais that\r\nmorning. Latham and his watchers, who had been waiting for better\r\nweather, rose in time to see his rival on the wing, but too late for\r\npursuit, as the wind had suddenly risen. The unwary boy remained\r\nbehind, weeping with disappointment.\r\n\r\nBlériot was now soaring high over the sea, faring toward Dover without\r\na guide or a compass. For some time he could observe the _Escopette_\r\nfollowing him, her great column of smoke obscuring the new risen sun.\r\nPresently both shores vanished, and for ten minutes he could descry\r\nneither land nor signal of any kind. He was sailing over the sea at\r\nforty miles an hour and drifting with the air he knew not whither; but\r\nhe allowed his fiery steed to follow its instinct, as a bewildered\r\nhorseman does sometimes. Along the horizon now appeared the white\r\ncliffs of the English shore. He was headed not for Dover but for\r\nDeal, carried adrift by the southwest wind. Three boats crossing his\r\ncourse seemed plying for some port on his left, and hailed him with\r\nlively greeting. He could not well inquire the way, but he followed\r\nthe general course of the vessels, soaring high aloft. At length he\r\nsaw a man on the cliff violently waving the tricolor, and strenuously\r\nshouting: “Bravo! Bravo!” He plunged in the direction of the signaler,\r\nwhom he knew to be his friend M. Montaine. On nearing the earth he was\r\ncaught in a violent turmoil of air and whirled about. Wishing to land\r\nat once, he stopped his power sixty feet aloft, and swooped abruptly\r\ndown with an awakening thud upon the old English soil, sleeping in the\r\npeaceful sunlight of a Sabbath morning.[52]\r\n\r\nBlériot’s landing was the greatest jolt to British insularity since the\r\nbirth of steam navigation. Nevertheless it was welcomed with unfeigned\r\ndelight as emphasizing the triumph of a new art which enriches all\r\npeople. Shortly afterward was erected on the spot a monument in white\r\ngranite having the plan and size of the renowned _No. XI_ monoplane.\r\n\r\nSportsmanlike, Latham wired his congratulations to Blériot, expressing\r\nthe hope to follow ere long. Two days later he flew across the Channel\r\nto within one mile of the English coast, where he had to land in the\r\nwater again because of motor failure. This time he struck the sea\r\nviolently and suffered a broken nose. His goggles were shattered and\r\ncut his face.\r\n\r\nThe big competitive flyers of the world now turned toward Betheny\r\nPlain near Rheims, where the first International Aviation Meet was to\r\nbe held August 22-29, 1909. Here was a place to make record flights,\r\nto win rich prizes, and to achieve great distinction. A well-designed\r\naërodrome had been prepared for the occasion. In the midst of a broad\r\nplain was marked by means of high poles, or pylons, a rectangular\r\ncourse, measuring roughly one by two miles, or more exactly, 1,500 by\r\n3,500 meters. At one end was the judges stand, the grand stand, the\r\ncafé and the aëroplane sheds. The numerous cash prizes offered for\r\nspeed, for distance, for endurance, for altitude, etc., totaled in\r\nvalue nearly forty thousand dollars. But the most coveted prize of\r\nall was the James Gordon Bennett Aviation Cup, together with $5,000\r\ncash, the winner of which should have the honor of placing the next\r\ninternational contest in his own country. This should be awarded to the\r\naviator having the best speed over a two-round, or 20-kilometer course.\r\nThe next most desired prize was a cash sum of $10,000 for the longest\r\nflight. A special charm of the tournament was that each fortunate\r\nentrant should meet the distinguished aviators from all localities, and\r\nshould fly in presence of a world-gathering. Aëroplanes of all the most\r\nsuccessful types were there, numbering together thirty-eight machines.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the great aviation week, Sunday, August 22d, was\r\ndevoted to elimination trials to determine which aviators should\r\nrepresent France in the race for the Bennett trophy. Of the seventeen\r\nentrants in these trials the three who should cover two rounds of\r\nthe course in the shortest time should be selected as champions, the\r\nnext six, in order of speed, to act as reserve pilots. But owing to\r\nthe severe weather of that day, only six of the seventeen entrants\r\nsucceeded in flying well enough to be admitted in either capacity.\r\nOf these six the cup champions were: Blériot, Lefebvre, Lambert and\r\nLatham; the reserve champions being in order, Tissandier, Paulhan and\r\nSommer. These men won their places by bold flying in rough conditions;\r\nfor rain had fallen heavily during the previous night, and the wind\r\nwas still blowing in swift and gusty current over the sodden field.\r\nIndeed, the weather seemed anything but propitious at the opening of\r\nthat great experimental tournament, on the success of which should be\r\nbased the estimates and forecast of so many subsequent meets. Swift\r\nclouds overhead, and black flags displayed on high masts, indicated\r\nthat flying would be impossible. A passing storm raged at five o’clock\r\nin the afternoon. But toward evening the face of Nature brightened,\r\nand with it the hopes of the aviationists. The weather at last became\r\nideal. Nearly all the aëroplanes came forth, and at six o’clock no\r\nfewer than seven were on the wing at one time. Some of them were\r\ndoing most startling feats. Lefebvre would make a threatening swoop\r\nat the grand stand, then circle swiftly away. Blériot, in a moment of\r\nunsteadiness, charged a wheat stack with his swift monoplane, damaging\r\nhis sharp-bladed propeller. Count de Lambert sailed under Paul\r\nTissandier, heedless of the aërial wake beneath. The crowds applauded\r\nand cheered every novel and bold maneuver. The closing hour with its\r\nsunny calm atmosphere and its vivacious well-pleased populace, presaged\r\ngreater joys for the morrow. Sir Henry Norman, who was present,\r\ndeclared that those events marked the birth of a new epoch in human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nMonday, the second day of the meet, dawned fair and calm, with\r\npromise of settled weather. It was the last qualifying day for\r\nthe ten-thousand-dollar long-distance prize, the Grand Prix de la\r\nChampagne. No one who had not flown a reasonable space on, or before\r\nMonday, could take part in the trials for that coveted honor on\r\nWednesday, Thursday and Friday. The aviators were about early, and many\r\nhad qualified before evening. Several of the pilots tried for speed\r\nrecords. Blériot, with an 80-horse-power monoplane, made one round of\r\nthe course in 8 minutes, 42⅖ seconds. Curtiss, in his 60-horse-power\r\nbiplane, lowered the time to 8 minutes, 35⅗ seconds. This was an\r\nachievement of the greatest concern, since Curtiss stood alone, as\r\nchampion of America, against the more experienced flyers of Europe.\r\nHe thought of nothing, engaged in nothing, except the speed trials,\r\nfor in these he hoped to win, with his 60-horse flyer, even against\r\nrenowned Blériot, in his 80-horse machine. Other interesting events\r\nwere designed solely to entertain or amuse the people. Lefebvre again\r\nfurnished merriment by sweeping over and under, and around Paulhan, who\r\nwas flying at an elevation of 25 feet. M. Kapferer had navigated from\r\nMeaux, in the dirigible _Colonel Renard_, and sailed about the grounds,\r\nwith fine effect.\r\n\r\nTuesday should have brought ideal conditions and performances; for it\r\nwas the day set for the visit of M. Falliéres, President of France.\r\nBut the morning was dark, with ominous clouds gathering over the\r\naërodrome, and black flags streaming in the strong wind. When the\r\nPresident arrived, though the clock told four, no flying had yet begun.\r\nHe examined the machines, held an informal reception, and at five took\r\nhis box in the grand stand. Presently Bunau-Varilla in his Voisin\r\nbiplane, rocking in the fifteen-mile wind, flew past, waving his hat to\r\nthe distinguished spectators. After him came dauntless young Paulhan\r\nwho also passed the President, shortly before the latter, with his\r\nparty, returned to the railway station. He flew at an elevation of 300\r\nto 500 feet, his Voisin heaving and lurching in the tumultuous wind,\r\nlike a boat on the breakers. He had no lateral stabilizing plane, so\r\nhe let his box kite rock. The people were appalled, but what cared he\r\nfor wind gusts, so far from earth? Let the craft roll and pitch; he\r\nwas not uneasy. On the return lap he raced and beat a railway train.\r\nThese were but inklings of what he would do with increased experience.\r\nLatham followed presently on his long swift monoplane, to the delight\r\nof all who love the graceful in mechanism and motion. Ere long he\r\nwas chased and overhauled by Blériot, in his cross-Channel flyer.\r\nThis was exciting, but Blériot produced still greater enthusiasm by\r\nbeating the speed record, lowering it to 8 minutes, 4⅖ seconds, for\r\none round of the 10-kilometer (6.21 mile) course. The day was ended,\r\nand the spectators were charmed again by the spectacular evolutions\r\nof Lefebvre, who cavorted in the air before the grand stand, cutting\r\nimpressive curves and figure “8’s.”\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, the fourth of the meet, was heavy with black clouds,\r\nwhich presaged unfavorable weather. The winds were light, but still\r\nnothing transpired till late in the afternoon to break the monotony\r\nof waiting. During this long interval the crowd could amuse itself\r\nwith gossip, refreshments and music, and with an occasional flight of\r\nlesser moment. About four o’clock Paulhan set forth in a six-mile wind\r\nto try for the Grand Prix de la Champagne. His lumbering Voisin had\r\na speed of hardly more than thirty miles an hour, but it was driven\r\nby a very reliable 50-horse Gnome 7-cylinder motor, whose body spins\r\nround a fixed crank, carrying the propeller with it. No one at first\r\nexpected a very long flight. The wind rose, sometimes exceeding 20\r\nmiles an hour, tossing the young pilot terribly, and once throwing\r\nhim so far within the course that he must turn a complete circle in\r\norder to round the corner post, or pylon. But he kept right on, so\r\nlong as there remained a drop of fuel. He first broke Wilbur Wright’s\r\nbest record, by 23 minutes, then Sommer’s recent record, by 6 minutes,\r\nfinally landing, at half past six o’clock, with a new world’s record\r\nof 82 miles in 2 hours, 43 minutes and 24⅘ seconds. The people were\r\nfrantic with excitement; they clapped their hands and waved thousands\r\nof handkerchiefs; they rent the air with tremendous applause as he\r\nwas borne toward the grand stand on the shoulders of his clamorous\r\ncomrades. Others at the same time had been flying with varied fortune.\r\nDuring Paulhan’s long demonstration, Fournier had encountered a\r\nminiature whirlwind, turned over in the air, at a great height, and\r\ncrashed sidewise to the ground, with some injury to his nose, and with\r\nmuch damage to the wings and tail of his machine. Latham, wishing to\r\nlower his circuit time, flew thrice around the course, but without\r\nimprovement. During his flight, a splendid rainbow appeared, which\r\ntogether with the _Antoinette_ dragon fly soaring high aloft with\r\nLatham on its back, produced an impressive spectacle.\r\n\r\nThursday morning brought fine weather and the promise of an eventful\r\nday. As a consequence serious efforts were made to excel all previous\r\nrecords, particularly for speed, duration and distance. In the forenoon\r\nLatham flew 43.5 miles in the _Antoinette XIII_. In the afternoon Count\r\nde Lambert, in his Wright biplane, flew 72 miles. Blériot entertained\r\nthe throng by carrying Delagrange as passenger; but while sailing near\r\nthe ground he encountered some dragoons, turned sidewise to avoid\r\nstriking them, and plunged into a fence, breaking his propeller. But\r\nthe great sensation of the day was Latham’s afternoon flight for the\r\nGrand Prix, in his _Antoinette No. 29_. Starting with plenty of fuel\r\nand favorable weather, he rose to a high level and flew till his supply\r\nwas exhausted, at times encountering rough winds and for a while\r\nplowing through a rainstorm. It was the banner flight of the week thus\r\nfar; for it surpassed all other long ones in distance and speed, though\r\nnot equaling Paulhan’s in endurance. His total range, when compelled\r\nto alight through exhaustion of fuel, was 95.88 miles, in 2 hours,\r\n18 minutes, 9⅗ seconds. This showed an average speed of 41.63 miles\r\nan hour for the whole distance, while the speed for his first round\r\nwas 44.65 miles an hour. For this great achievement he could thank\r\nhis 50-horse, 8-cylinder _Antoinette_ motor, one of the lightest in\r\nexistence, for that power.\r\n\r\nFriday, August 27th, was the last day allotted for the distance, or\r\nGrand Prix contest. After the wonderful new records of Paulhan and\r\nLatham, people were marveling what might happen on the final day. Many\r\nassumed, of course, that Latham’s record of 96 miles would remain\r\nunsurpassed. At four-thirty, Latham started on another long flight, in\r\nhis _Antoinette_ monoplane _No. 13_, followed presently by Farman and\r\nSommer in Farman biplanes; these flying six to twelve feet from the\r\nground, with gallant Latham soaring aloft nearly three hundred feet in\r\nhis swift long-winged fish, and occasionally gaining a lap on them.\r\nSommer stopped after three rounds, because of motor trouble. Latham’s\r\nfuel gave out after a voyage of 68.35 miles, and he glided to earth.\r\nFarman continued to plod along on his slow, low-wandering craft, with\r\nlittle attention. Others were in the air, with biplanes and monoplanes,\r\nentertaining the populace—Blériot, Curtiss, Delagrange, Tissandier,\r\nBunau-Varilla—these had the applause. Presently the spectators\r\nremembered that ground-skimming Farman had been a very long time on the\r\nwing. He now became the center of rapt attention. Slowly he distanced\r\nPaulhan’s great world’s record of Wednesday; slowly he distanced\r\nLatham’s greater world’s record of Thursday; but still he plodded away.\r\nThe sun sank on his flight; darkness came on the field, so that he\r\nvanished from view at the far end of the course. At the close of the\r\nnineteenth round he landed in the dark before the grand stand, limp\r\nand exhausted, having journeyed 3¼ hours and traversed 118.06 miles.\r\nFor the second time he had won a $10,000 prize; nineteen months ago by\r\nflying 1 kilometer, to-day by flying 190 kilometers. A searchlight was\r\nthrown upon him. He was pulled from his machine and carried upon the\r\nshoulders of his friends, receiving a prolonged and tremendous ovation.\r\n\r\nThe seventh morning of the tournament, Saturday, August 28th,\r\ncame with a beaming smile, promising good flights and a pleasant\r\ntermination of the glorious cup contest for the highest speed in two\r\nrounds of the 10-kilometer course. The air was calm, mild and hazy\r\nabove the Betheny plain. The flyers were in fine mood for great\r\nachievements. The thronging groups of well-dressed men and women\r\nawaited further startling events, with varied animation and constant\r\nchatter. The day was well diversified with interesting flights; but,\r\nof course, not with long ones. The chief interest centered in the\r\nleading cup-champions—solitary Yankee Curtiss and great Blériot with\r\nhis 80-horse monoplane, supported, if need be, by his allies in the\r\ncontest, Lefebvre and Latham.\r\n\r\nCurtiss, shortly after ten o’clock, made a preliminary trial, lowering\r\nhis best anterior time. With this he was so pleased that he prepared\r\nimmediately for the one official flight allowed in that contest. He\r\nfilled his small gasoline tank, replenished his radiator, signed a\r\nlegal paper certifying this to be his trial for the cup, and at once\r\ntook wing, circling before the grand stand, then crossing the line at\r\nfull speed. The biplane pitched perceptibly at its unusual gait, but\r\nturned the corner in easy curves, completing the first round in 7.57⅖,\r\nthe second in 7.53⅕; the total time being 15 minutes, 50⅗ seconds, and\r\nshowing an average speed of 47.04 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAbout noon Blériot came forth with his 80-horse monoplane _No. 22_,\r\nwhich was expected to eclipse the Curtiss biplane, but in reality\r\nproved exasperatingly slow. At two o’clock he tried another propeller,\r\nwith little encouragement. An hour later he tried again with a\r\nfour-blade propeller, but descended before completing the round. After\r\ntinkering for an hour, aided by several mechanics, he flew to his shed,\r\nshortly before five o’clock. As no start was allowed after five-thirty,\r\nhe hastened zealously and started his official flight at five-ten. The\r\nmighty monoplane cut the air at terrific speed, without pitching, or\r\nrolling, and finished the first round in 7.47⅘, or 5⅔ seconds less\r\nthan Curtiss’ best lap. The overjoyed French throng rent the air with\r\nfrantic bravos! Curtiss and Mr. Bishop were silent, appreciating the\r\nskill of that fiery antagonist, with his monster engine. As the steady\r\nbirdlike craft turned the last pylon, and swept homeward in magnificent\r\ncareer, the timers called out the seconds. The throng listened with\r\nabated breath and then with alarm. Blériot had lost speed in the\r\nsecond round. When he crossed the line his total time was 5⅗ seconds\r\ngreater than that of his only rival. The conqueror of the Channel, the\r\nchampion of France, was defeated and the international trophy must go\r\nto America, won by a taciturn, calculating Yankee, never before seen in\r\nEurope, and hardly known to fame.\r\n\r\nOther official flights for the cup during the day were made by Latham\r\nand Lefebvre for France, and by Mr. Cockburn, champion for England,\r\nthe latter bird-man sailing into a stack of wheat in the middle of\r\nhis first round, then wheeling to earth. Incidentally Henri Farman\r\nestablished a new world’s three-man duration distance and speed record\r\nby carrying two passengers ten kilometers in 10 minutes 39 seconds.\r\nThus ended the chief day of the tournament, leaving the contestants in\r\nthe following order of speed: Curtiss, Blériot, Latham, Lefebvre.\r\n\r\nOf the other leading prizes, that for the fastest single round was\r\ntaken by Blériot; that for the fastest three-round flight was won by\r\nCurtiss on Sunday, with a record of 23 minutes, 29 seconds for the\r\nthirty kilometers; the Altitude Prize was won by Latham, who attained\r\nan elevation of 508.5 feet; the Prix des Mecaniciens was won by\r\nBunau-Varilla in a flight of 100 kilometers; the Prix des Aëronats\r\nwas won, on Sunday, by the large dirigible, the _Colonel Renard_,\r\nin a voyage of 50 kilometers, or 31.06 miles, at an average speed of\r\n24.9 miles an hour. Along with the chief prizes, many smaller ones of\r\nconsiderable value were awarded, thus summing up the total of $37,000.\r\n\r\nThe small band of men who organized the first international aviation\r\nmeet, with the Marquis de Polignac as president, and the great wine\r\nmerchants of the Champagne district as their supporters, were now\r\nelated and triumphant. They had undertaken a novel and costly sporting\r\nenterprise, regarded by many as hazardous, or rash, even though\r\nsanctioned by the Aëro Club of France. For an enormous attendance\r\nwould be required to meet the expense of preparations and prize money.\r\nIt was doubtful whether the few available aviators could draw large\r\ncrowds to Betheny for a week, even in ideal weather, and there was risk\r\nof sending the critical populace away displeased if abundant flights\r\nwere not made. The whole event might prove a painful fiasco, if rains\r\nand high winds should predominate; for were not aviators notoriously\r\nreluctant to fly in rough weather? Vain apprehensions, ignoring the\r\nreckless and intrepid daring of the Gallic sportsmen! Nothing short of\r\na week’s continual tempest could have kept them down.\r\n\r\nThe great tournament was a triumph, not only to the courageous\r\npromoters, but also to the aviators, the manufacturers, the whole of\r\nmankind. It astonished both actors and spectators. It marked a new\r\nepoch in the art of aëroplaning. It inaugurated a magical and wholly\r\nnovel kind of recreation and public amusement that should be demanded\r\nat once in all civilized countries. It eradicated, in a measure, the\r\ninveterate notion that the aëroplane is essentially a fair-weather\r\nmachine. With a cheap instrument capable of flying scores of miles\r\nin rain and wind, what applications might not come, of the greatest\r\nimport to the world?\r\n\r\nThe fashion set at Rheims was imitated in other cities. Before the\r\nclose of the year 1909, aviation meets were scheduled for Brescia in\r\nItaly, Berlin, Juvisy, near Paris, Blackpool and Doncaster, England.\r\nThe succeeding year was to have more such events than the really\r\ncapable aviators could attend. In both hemispheres, sums in cash,\r\nequaling or exceeding those at Rheims, would be offered by many\r\nprominent communities, eager to witness such novel and thrilling\r\nentertainment as only dexterous aviators could furnish. But it would be\r\nlearned also that considerable financial risk attends an aviation meet,\r\nunless good judgment mark the choice of site, season, pilots and the\r\nexecutive agencies. Several of the meets following the one at Rheims\r\nsucceeded neither in defraying expenses nor in furnishing competent\r\naviators to repay the trouble of holding the tournament. The meets\r\nheld in England were practically failures. A most interesting flight,\r\nhowever, was performed by Latham in a wind of 25 to 35 miles an hour.\r\nThis itself was a very impressive achievement. The Brescia meeting was\r\nremarkable for the turbulence of its aërial currents and for Rougier’s\r\nrecord high flight of 645 feet.\r\n\r\nThe two most wonderful flights in the autumn of 1909 were those of\r\nCount de Lambert and Farman. During a meet at the Juvisy aërodrome,\r\nLambert, on October 18th, after circling the ground a few times on a\r\nWright biplane, attaining a height of 450 feet, started for Paris,\r\nsteadily ascending in the direction of the Eiffel Tower. Circling this\r\nat an altitude of about 1,300 feet, he returned to Juvisy at 5.30\r\nP.M., having journeyed 30 miles over that dangerous route, in about\r\n50 minutes. This indicated that lofty flying might enable one to\r\npass safely over a city, even with an unreliable motor, since, if the\r\npropeller stopped, a glide of many thousands of feet could be made, to\r\nchoose a landing. Farman’s flight was less spectacular, but quite as\r\nmarvelous. On November 4th, while competing for the Michelin trophy\r\nfor the longest distance traversed in 1909, he flew continuously for\r\n4 hours, 6 minutes, 25 seconds, voyaging in that time 144 miles, at\r\nan average speed of 35.06 miles an hour. This proved to be the record\r\ndistance-and-endurance flight for the year. Other men spoke of sailing\r\nall day in a machine carrying ample gasoline, but failed to make good\r\ntheir words.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESNAULT-PELTERIE MONOPLANE, EARLY PATTERN.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy W. J. Hammer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESNAULT-PELTERIE MONOPLANE OF 1910.]\r\n\r\nUnheralded, but quite astonishing, were the flights of Santos-Dumont\r\nin September, 1909. Though conspicuous as a pioneer in aviation, he\r\nfor a while had been absorbed in other affairs, and had not kept pace\r\nwith his brother aëroplanists in France, since his bold and brief\r\ndashes into the air in the early days of the art. During the season of\r\n1909, however, he developed a surprisingly small and simple monoplane,\r\nspreading 102 square feet of wing surface, and weighing in complete\r\nrunning order, 259 pounds. It was driven by a Darrac motor, mounted\r\nabove the main surface, carrying the propeller directly on its shaft,\r\nand having radiator tubes along the inner surface of the main plane.\r\nIts triangular trussed frame was wheel-mounted, and tapered rapidly\r\nto the rear, terminating in horizontal and vertical rudders. With\r\nthis tiniest flyer he sailed across country from St. Cyr to Buc, 4¾\r\nmiles, in five minutes, at the unprecedented speed of 55 miles an\r\nhour, repeating the performance several times, according to report. He\r\nalso left the ground after a run of 60 feet, in an unofficial trial.\r\nCharacteristically, he presented to the public the scale drawings of\r\nhis machine, with all rights to its use.\r\n\r\nA very original type of monoplane was developed by Robert\r\nEsnault-Pélterie, who began experimenting in 1903. As shown in Plate\r\nXXIX, its body frame was covered to reduce air-resistance, and was\r\nprovided with ample keel surface to promote directness and steadiness\r\nof flight. The weight was borne on two wheels in tandem, aided by\r\nwheels at the wing tips to preserve the lateral balance when the\r\nmachine was resting. When under way the lateral poise was controlled by\r\nwing warping; the motion about the other two axes being controlled by a\r\nhorizontal and a vertical rudder, the latter being “compensated,” that\r\nis, having its axis near the center of side pressure, when in action.\r\nAn air-cooled motor of 30 to 35 horse power with a direct mounted\r\nfour-blade screw formed the propulsion plant. Though the “R. E. P.”\r\naëroplane, as it was commonly called, did not achieve great distinction\r\nat first, due, perhaps, to the inventor’s being over original, and\r\nmaking all its parts himself, instead of buying some high-class engine\r\nand propeller, as other successful aëroplanists had done, still his\r\nmachine was greatly admired by technicians for its excellent finish and\r\nthe fastidious, thorough and patient manner in which its young inventor\r\nlabored to make it perfect, both in design and construction. It was\r\nregarded as a future record breaker, which, indeed, it was destined to\r\nbecome on further improvement.\r\n\r\nAlthough little was accomplished in building aëroplanes in other\r\ncountries than America and France, up to the beginning of 1909, that\r\nyear witnessed some good flights in homemade machines in Germany,\r\nEngland and Canada. In November, 1909, Herr Grade, in Germany, made\r\na flight of 55 minutes in his monoplane. Mr. S. F. Cody, who\r\nconstructed a biplane for the British army, flew over forty miles\r\nacross country on September 8th, high above trees and buildings,\r\nremaining on the wing for 63 minutes. The machine spanned 52 feet,\r\nweighed with the pilot, nearly a ton, and was controlled by front\r\nand rear vertical rudders and two lateral rudders, well in front, so\r\ngeared that if worked oppositely the machine listed, while if worked\r\nidentically it rose or fell. In Canada Dr. Alexander Graham Bell and\r\nhis associates continued the experiments, already described, begun\r\nin 1908 by the Aërial Experiment Association. In 1909 their fourth\r\nmachine, the _Silver Dart_, flew many times round a course on the\r\nfrozen lake, Bras d’Or, traversing, all told, about 1,000 miles in 100\r\nflights.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRADE MONOPLANE.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy E. L. Jones.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CODY BIPLANE.]\r\n\r\nThe last months of this strenuous year, 1909, and of the first decade\r\nof dynamic flight, closed without further startling developments. True,\r\nsome records were made, but they merely pleased, not perturbed the\r\nworld, now accustomed to marvels. Be it recorded, however, that, with a\r\nVoisin biplane, Paulhan, on November 1st, flew 96 miles in 2 hours, 20\r\nminutes, and on November 20th flew 1,960 feet high in a Farman biplane;\r\non December 9th, Maurice Farman, mounted on his own type of biplane,\r\nrode through the icy atmosphere from Buc to Chartres, a distance of 40\r\nkilometers, in 50 minutes, the longest town-to-town flight up to that\r\ndate; and on December 31st he flew from Chartres to Orleans, a distance\r\nof 41.6 miles, in forty-six minutes. But several fine achievements\r\nwhich the world anticipated for that year remained unattempted. The\r\ngreat prize flight of 183 miles from London to Manchester was still\r\nuntried, though several machines and pilots seemed equal to the voyage,\r\nand $50,000 would be awarded by Lord Northcliffe to the brave aviator\r\nwho should accomplish that journey in not more than three stages and\r\nwithin a period of twenty-four hours. Neither had anyone yet flown\r\nto an elevation of one kilometer. These tasks were left over as\r\nallurements for the succeeding year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                            FORCING THE ART\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decade that inaugurated dynamic man-flight had closed without fully\r\ndemonstrating the capabilities of such aëroplanes as had been so far\r\ndeveloped. No considerable altitude record had as yet been achieved. No\r\nvery long cross-country flight had yet been attempted, though for many\r\nmonths the New York _World_ had offered $10,000 for the first aërial\r\nvoyage from Albany to New York, and the London _Daily Mail_ had long\r\noffered $50,000 for a flight from London to Manchester. The uses of the\r\naëroplane for scouting by land and sea had not been tested, much less\r\nits probable value in aggressive warfare. Such experiments were for\r\nthe immediate future, as also the development of specialized types of\r\nmachines for racing, for climbing, for burden bearing, for distance,\r\nfor endurance, for landing on water, for rising from water, for\r\nprotection of passengers from severe weather. To air men and spectators\r\nalike the future of the art promised to be quite as captivating as the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe first startling achievements to usher in the new decade were the\r\ngreat altitude flights. New world records followed in rapid succession\r\nall through the year 1910, with marked persistence and wonderful\r\nprogress. Levels that had been regarded as the peculiar region of motor\r\nballoons were passed one after another, until the aviators vanished\r\nbeyond the clouds, their limbs palsied with cold, and their aëroplane\r\nwings whitened with frost. Though the greatest prizes were not offered\r\nfor this species of flight, and frequently none at all, it had an\r\nabiding fascination for both the flyers and the public. At the same\r\ntime it proved to be as safe as it was theatrical and popular.\r\n\r\nThe starter in this exciting race for cloudland was Hubert Latham,\r\nalready the official holder of the world’s altitude record. At Bouy,\r\non January 7th, in presence of official witnesses, he rose in his\r\n_Antoinette_ monoplane, describing a great upward spiral till his\r\nbarometer recorded 1,050 meters; then returned to earth with like ease\r\nand precision, landing softly near his hangar, before his assistants,\r\ntransported with enthusiasm. He had touched the goal of Gallic\r\nambition, having driven his aëroplane to the height of one kilometer.\r\n\r\nLatham’s tenure of the world’s altitude record quickly passed to\r\nhis doughty rival, Louis Paulhan. At Los Angeles, on the twelfth of\r\nJanuary, Paulhan, mounted on a Farman biplane, ascended 4,165 feet, as\r\nagainst Latham’s record of 3,444 feet. This was a great step upward,\r\ndue not only to Paulhan’s prowess and dexterity, but also to the\r\nscience and constructive skill of the less spectacular gentlemen in the\r\ndesigning room, workshop and laboratory.\r\n\r\nLatham strove again for the world’s altitude record and gained it on\r\nJuly 7th at the second Rheims tournament, by driving his _Antoinette_\r\nto a height of 4,541 feet.[53] But again his victory was soon eclipsed;\r\nfor two days later, Walter Brookins at Atlantic City ascended 6,175\r\nfeet in a Wright biplane. An American was thus the first to fly above\r\none mile, as a Frenchman had been first to pass the 1-kilometer limit.\r\nThe 2-kilometer and 2-mile elevations were exceeded before the close of\r\nthe year, as shown by the following table, which also manifests a fair\r\ndistribution of honors among various nations and types of machines:\r\n\r\n  --------+------------+------------+---------------+------------\r\n    Feet  |  Aviator   |  Aëroplane |     Place     |   Date\r\n  --------+------------+------------+---------------+------------\r\n    3,445 | Latham     | Antoinette | Betheny Plain | January 7\r\n    4,165 | Paulhan    | Farman     | Los Angeles   | January 12\r\n    4,541 | Latham     | Antoinette | Rheims        | July 7\r\n    6,175 | Brookins   | Wright     | Atlantic City | July 9\r\n    6,604 | Drexel     | Blériot    | Lanark, Sc.   | August 11\r\n    8,271 | Morane     | Blériot    | Havre, France | September 3\r\n    8,406 | Chavez     | Blériot    | Issy          | September 8\r\n    9,104 | Wijnmalen  | Farman     | Mourmelon     | October 1\r\n    9,714 | Johnstone  | Wright     | Belmont Park  | October 31\r\n   10,499 | Leganeaux  | Blériot    | Pau           | December 9\r\n   11,474 | [54]Hoxsey | Wright     | Los Angeles   | December 26\r\n  --------+------------+------------+---------------+------------\r\n\r\nSuch lofty flights have proved a severe test of both the aëroplane and\r\nthe pilot. In the lighter atmosphere the engine must turn the propeller\r\nat higher speed to secure the same thrust, and the aëroplane must sail\r\nfaster to support the same weight as at the lower levels. Thus more\r\npower is required on high, though the explosive medium, being less\r\ndense, is less capable of exerting power. The driver has, therefore, to\r\njockey his machine with assiduous care and alertness, at a time when he\r\nis least fitted for exertion, owing to fatigue, cold, and it may be,\r\nphysical discomfort due to the great change of atmospheric pressure.\r\nBut still, both aëroplane and pilot are capable of ascending well above\r\nany levels thus far attained.\r\n\r\nAfter the triumphant altitude flights of 1910 the aëronautical\r\nskeptics could no longer contend that the aëroplane was useless in\r\ntransportation and warfare, because of its inability to fly above\r\nhigh land or the usual range of the guns of battleships and coast\r\nfortifications. Most of the important mountain passes lie below 10,000\r\nfeet. The safe elevation for motor balloons menaced by terrene guns is\r\ntaken to be much less than two miles, and in military practice they\r\nusually operate below the one-mile level. The aëroplanes, therefore,\r\nmay not only cross mountain ranges, but may also scrutinize, or\r\ngrievously molest, land forces, marine squadrons and perhaps even the\r\ngreat gaseous cruisers of the atmosphere, which they can far outspeed,\r\nand may even destroy.\r\n\r\nThe increase in speed of flight during 1910 was also quite remarkable.\r\nThe official record by which Mr. Curtiss won the Bennett Aviation\r\nContest at Rheims, in 1909, showed a speed of 47.04 miles an hour.\r\nStill higher velocities, ranging from 50 to 60 miles an hour, were\r\nreported later in that season from England and France. In 1910,\r\nhowever, at the Rheims aviation meet, Morane, with a Blériot monoplane,\r\ncovered the 20-kilometer course in 12 minutes 45.2 seconds, or at an\r\naverage speed of 66.2 miles an hour, showing a gain of forty per cent\r\non Mr. Curtiss’s speed of the preceding year. Still better was achieved\r\nat the international tournament held at Belmont Park in 1910. Le Blanc\r\nin a 100-horse Blériot monoplane, especially designed for speed,\r\ncovered nineteen laps of the 5-kilometer course at an average rate of\r\n61 miles an hour, and his fastest lap at the rate of 71.68 miles an\r\nhour, thus exceeding Curtiss’s speed of the previous year by fifty per\r\ncent. Other spurts during the latter part of 1910 were reported to have\r\nattained nearly 80 miles an hour over a closed circuit, though perhaps\r\nnot a level one. The best results were achieved with machines having\r\nhigh power engines, small surfaces and slight forward resistance.\r\n\r\nThe advance in long-distance flying in 1910 more than kept pace with\r\nthe progress in speed. The best achievement at the close of the\r\npreceding year had been Farman’s flight of 144 miles at an average rate\r\nof 35.06 miles an hour in a closed circuit. At the Rheims aviation meet\r\nin 1910, Jan Olieslaegers, in a Blériot monoplane, driven by a Gnome\r\nengine, covered 244 miles in a rectangular course, at an average speed\r\nof 48.31 miles an hour. At Buc, on the 28th of October, an aviator of\r\nthree months’ practice, Maurice Tabuteau, in a Maurice Farman biplane,\r\ndriven by a Rénault engine, flew over a closed circuit, covering 288.8\r\nmiles at an average speed of 47.9 miles an hour. At Pau on December\r\n21st, M. G. Leganeaux, in a Blériot monoplane, flew for the Michelin\r\nCup, covering 516 kilometers or 320.6 miles in six hours and one\r\nminute, or at an average speed of 53¼ miles an hour—a splendid showing.\r\nFinally, at Buc, on December 30th, Tabuteau, flying for the annual\r\nMichelin prize, covered 362.66 miles in a Maurice Farman biplane with\r\nan 8-cylinder 60-horse Rénault motor. The average speed in this very\r\nlong flight was 47.3 miles an hour, or practically the rate by which\r\nCurtiss won the international contest of the preceding year. Of course\r\na considerably better showing of both distance and velocity could have\r\nbeen made on a longer course.\r\n\r\nThe world records for cross-country flying and for endurance and load\r\nillustrate both the increasing perfection of the machine and of the\r\npilot’s skill and confidence. At Los Angeles, on January 19th, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Paulhan, in a Farman biplane, flew together 21 miles overland from\r\nthe aviation field to Redondo and Hermosa Beach and return. On January\r\n31st Van der Born made a world’s duration record with a passenger on\r\na Farman biplane, flying 1 hour 48 minutes 50 seconds. On March 5th,\r\nHenri Farman, who had previously twice broken the world’s duration\r\nrecord for a pilot with two passengers, set a new and astonishing\r\npace at Mourmelon, by carrying Mr. Hevardson and Madame Frank in\r\neasy flight for 62.5 minutes on his new biplane. In France, on April\r\n3d, Emile Dubonnet on his _Tellier_ monoplane flew from Juvisy to La\r\nFerte-Saint Aubin, a distance of 109 kilometers or 70 miles in 1 hour\r\nand 50 minutes, thus winning the ten-thousand-franc prize offered\r\nby _La Nature_ for the first straightaway flight of 100 kilometers\r\nto be effected in less than two hours, over a previously indicated\r\ncourse. This fine record voyage was achieved in a machine never before\r\nthoroughly tried. At Chalons-sur-Marne, on April 8th, Daniel Kinet,\r\na Belgian, mounted with a passenger on a Farman biplane driven by\r\na 50-horse Gnome engine, broke the world’s record for duration and\r\ndistance for two persons by flying round a closed circuit 2 hours 19¼\r\nminutes, covering a distance of 152 kilometers, or 94 miles. On April\r\n17th, H. Farman, with a passenger in his biplane, voyaged from Etampes\r\nto Orleans, 28 miles. Next day, Paulhan, mounting the same machine,\r\nflew 108 miles, and the following day 42 miles. This tour established a\r\nnew cross-country record for total distance, for single stage distance\r\nwith one passenger, and for duration and single stage distance with two\r\npassengers. During the same month Farman made a new record for four\r\npassengers by carrying three gentlemen for 1 hour and 4 minutes on his\r\nnew biplane, spreading 47.6 feet. On June 9th, two French officers,\r\nLieutenant Fequant piloting and Captain Marconnet observing, flew\r\non a Farman biplane from Bouy to Vincennes, 145 kilometers, in two\r\nhours and a half, thus breaking the world’s cross-country distance and\r\nduration record for a pilot with a passenger. On June 13th, Charles K.\r\nHamilton, in a Curtiss biplane, flew from New York to Philadelphia, a\r\ndistance of 86 miles in 103 minutes, and returned the same day, thus\r\ncompleting 172 miles in one day. This was an exhibition flight made for\r\n_The New York Times_ and the _Philadelphia Ledger_, for a sum reported\r\nto be $10,000. It was a sequel to Glenn H. Curtiss’s memorable flight\r\non June 5th, down the Hudson River from Albany to New York, for the New\r\nYork _World’s_ $10,000 prize. Hamilton’s average speed was 50 miles\r\nan hour going and 51 miles returning. On August 29th, at Lille, Louis\r\nBréguet is reported to have carried with him on a biplane of his make,\r\nfive passengers, who, together with the gasoline, weighed 921 pounds.\r\nIt may be added that the Bréguet biplane of that date was advertised\r\nand guaranteed to carry a cargo, or extra load, of 250 kilograms. It\r\nthus appears that by 1910 the aëroplane had grown powerful enough for\r\nan aërial cab service, and that it could carry sufficient explosive\r\ngelatine to derange a battleship.\r\n\r\nThe contest for cross-country records continued unabated all that\r\nmemorable year. During the first three days of September, Jean\r\nBielovucic, a youth of twenty-one, mounted on a new type of Voisin\r\nbiplane, with but a few days’ practice, flew from Paris to Bordeaux,\r\ncovering 540 kilometers, or 336 miles, in four stages, comprising\r\naltogether 6¼ hours on the wing. In spite of severe weather, at times,\r\nhe beat the regular express train and established a new world’s record\r\nfor cross-country straightaway distance flying with stops. On August\r\n17th, Alfred Le Blanc, finished a six-stage tour round a hexagonal\r\ncircuit northeast of Paris, with the finish at Issy, near Paris,\r\ncovering a total distance of 785 kilometers, or 440 miles, in 12\r\nhours 56.4 seconds effective time. On September 7th, Weyman flew with\r\na passenger from Paris to Clermont near the Puy de Dome, covering\r\n205 miles in one day, while trying for the Michelin prize of 100,000\r\nfrancs, for a flight to the Puy de Dome inside of six hours. On\r\nDecember 18th, Thomas Sopwith, competing for the longest flight across\r\nthe Channel and into Belgium, on a British-built aëroplane, flew from\r\nthe Isle of Sheppy across the Channel, and landed at Beaumont, Belgium,\r\ncovering a distance of 174 miles in 3.5 hours. At Buc, on November\r\n27th, Laurens, in a 60-horse R. E. P. monoplane, flew with his wife 53\r\nmiles at an average speed of nearly 50 miles an hour. On December 22d,\r\nLieutenant Cammerman, a French army officer, won the L. Weiller prize\r\nby flying across country with a passenger, 147 miles in 4 hours and 2\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the records which serve to illustrate the\r\nprogress in cross-country flying during that year of strenuous and\r\nworld-wide popular demonstrations. But the bare numerical statement of\r\nfacts can give no conception of the delight and exultation aroused in\r\nmillions of souls who witnessed or learned of these marvelous human\r\nachievements. They were the advancing triumph of a proud and fortunate\r\ngeneration, happy in realizing one of the fondest dreams of the ages.\r\nOften during one of these cross-country flights the aëroplane was\r\naccompanied by a swift railway train whose passengers were delirious\r\nwith enthusiasm. The entire route was thronged with people assembled\r\nfrom afar. It was a general holiday for all the fortunate cities and\r\nvillages along the way. Mills and factories blew their whistles and\r\nforgot the serious business of life, homes were deserted, schools\r\nwere dismissed; the whole population for the time congregated in\r\nthe open; bearded mechanics in their aprons, bare-armed housewives\r\nholding their children aloft, girls and boys with wondering eyes, all\r\nshouting, waving banners, throwing up hats, and hailing with tumultuous\r\ndemonstration that strange and huge-winged creature gliding from\r\nhorizon to horizon with the steadiness, precision and directness of a\r\nmighty projectile. But beyond stating the records of this season of\r\naërial wonders, only a passing notice can be given to some of the more\r\nconspicuous events.\r\n\r\nThe most famous overland voyages of the season 1910 began with the\r\nrace for the London _Daily Mail_ prize of $50,000, offered by Lord\r\nNorthcliffe for the first person who should fly from London to\r\nManchester, 183 miles within twenty-four hours, with not more than\r\ntwo stops. An Englishman, Claude Grahame-White, comparatively new in\r\nthe pilot’s art, was first to undertake that difficult and perilous\r\nadventure. Starting from London, without competitor, on April 24th, he\r\nflew in his Farman biplane, from London to Rugby, thence to Hademore,\r\nabout halfway to Manchester, landing at a quarter past nine o’clock\r\nat night, after a four-hour trip, and hoping to reach Manchester next\r\nday. But during the night his aëroplane, which was left in the open,\r\nwas damaged by the wind, thus necessitating repairs and a new start. On\r\nApril 27th, while he was strenuously mending and adjusting his biplane\r\nfor a new start, Louis Paulhan, who the day previously had arrived from\r\nFrance with a Farman biplane to enter the contest, was also vigorously\r\nsetting up and adjusting his machine.\r\n\r\nAt half past five in the afternoon, Paulhan suddenly set out for\r\nManchester. Mr. White, who was much fatigued and expecting to start on\r\nthe morrow at dawn, after much-needed rest, learned toward six o’clock\r\nthat his rival was on the wing, and hurriedly sailed from London,\r\nhoping by skill and good chance to overtake the flying Frenchman.\r\nThe race was now the most exciting event in the world. The first\r\nflyers of France and England were competing for the greatest prize\r\nyet offered in the history of aviation, competing in a most modern\r\nand extraordinary race, attended with abundant danger and hardship.\r\nThe contestants were evenly matched in mechanism and capability, but\r\nthe Frenchman had gotten the march on the unwary Englishman. Paulhan\r\nfollowed the Northwestern Railway, at times outracing the special\r\npilot train carrying his mechanics and supplies. At ten minutes after\r\neight o’clock, he landed at Lichfield, having covered 115 miles. Mr.\r\nWhite had landed five minutes before eight near Roade, after flying\r\nfifty-nine miles.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Paulhan sailed away at a quarter past four. Mr. White,\r\nhoping to overtake him, had started at dead of night and covered\r\ntwenty miles before Paulhan had started. It was a heroic effort, but\r\nunavailing. At twelve minutes after five, Mr. White landed at Hademore,\r\nhaving completed two thirds of the entire journey. Twenty-five minutes\r\nlater Paulhan landed on the outskirts of Manchester, greeted by a\r\nthousand persons. He had covered the whole distance in 4.2 hours, and\r\nhad fulfilled all the essential conditions for winning the great prize.\r\n\r\nThe next world-famous aëroplane voyage was that of Glenn H. Curtiss for\r\nthe New York _World’s_ prize of $10,000 for the first aërial journey\r\nfrom Albany to New York, allowing two stops. Aviators had been yearning\r\nfor this prize since the previous year, but had been too timidly shying\r\nat the dangers of the route. After most careful preparations for this\r\nvoyage, Curtiss, bearing a letter from the Mayor of Albany to the\r\nMayor of New York, sailed away at seven o’clock on Sunday morning, May\r\n29th, accompanied by a New York Central special train, bearing his wife\r\nand a few friends and newspaper men. He landed an hour for supplies\r\nand adjustment at Camelot, 41 miles down the river, and thence flew to\r\nSpuyten Duyvil, at the northern extremity of New York, having completed\r\nthe required distance, 128 miles, in 2 hours and 32 minutes, or at the\r\nrate of 50.52 miles per hour along the course. An hour later, he flew\r\ndown the river to New York Harbor and landed on Governor’s Island,\r\nwhere he received a becoming ovation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most exciting incident of the voyage to Mr. Curtiss was his\r\ntransit of the Storm King Mountain. As he was flying through the narrow\r\ngap at this place he caught the down-rolling air on one side more\r\nthan on the other, and dropped very suddenly sidewise 30 or 40 feet.\r\nBy shifting his front control, he quickly gained headway and promptly\r\nrighted his machine.\r\n\r\nCommenting on Mr. Curtiss’s average speed of 50 miles an hour and his\r\nrugged course, _Aëronautics_ makes comparison between his voyage and\r\nPaulhan’s great prize flight as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Paulhan took 4 hours 12 minutes elapsed time to cover 183\r\n  miles when he won the _London Mail’s_ $50,000 and made it in\r\n  two stages of 117 and 66 miles each. The 117 miles were covered\r\n  in 2.39, a rate of nearly 44 miles per hour. A night’s sleep\r\n  intervened and the remaining 66 miles were covered in 1.23, a\r\n  rate of nearly 48 miles per hour. The average for the above\r\n  was 44.37 miles per hour. Paulhan could have landed at almost\r\n  any time and started again, whereas Curtiss could not have\r\n  started if he had had to land in the water, and for the whole\r\n  distance there was scarcely a suitable space for landing on the\r\n  ground, as for nearly the entire way rocky, wooded hills with\r\n  precipitous sides line the river.”\r\n\r\nThe most audacious and marvelous aëronautic exploit of the year was the\r\nflight of George Chavez across the Alps from Brig to Domodossola, in\r\nhis attempt to win the prize of 70,000 francs offered by the Italian\r\nAviation Society for the first aëroplane flight from Brig to Milan, a\r\ndistance of 75 miles. From the nine volunteers for this contest who\r\npresented themselves to the committee in charge, five competitors\r\nwere selected, and these for several days made tentative efforts to\r\nscale the lofty pass, but were baffled by the wind or fog. Finally at\r\none-thirty, on September 23d, the conditions being favorable, Chavez\r\nrose, from Briegen-Berg, in his white-winged Blériot, spiraled upward\r\n1,000 meters, circling around the vast amphitheater of the mountains,\r\nand in nineteen minutes appeared in magnificent career well above the\r\nSimplon Pass, probably 7,000 feet above the sea, whence he glided\r\ngrandly down the Italian slope, parrying the rude cross winds and\r\nfinally reaching Domodossola, where the enthusiasm was at its climax.\r\nHere he expected to land on a level spot to replenish his supplies,\r\nthence proceed over the easy remaining two thirds of his journey. But\r\nthough the perilous pass had been crossed so successfully, disaster\r\nappeared in the valley when least expected. As the aëroplane was\r\ngliding thirty feet high over the level tract chosen for landing, it\r\nmet a sudden gust, its wings collapsed, and it fell crashing to earth,\r\npinioning its brave pilot under the débris.\r\n\r\nPoor Chavez suffered severe wounds about the face and head, had both\r\nlegs broken, and for some moments lay unconscious. But he was soon\r\nrevived by his friends and taken to a hospital, where he died four\r\ndays later. Thus ended the career of a brave and most promising youth\r\nof twenty-three. He had taken his pilot’s license only in February,\r\n1910, yet had established a new world’s record on September 8th, by\r\ndriving his Blériot to an elevation of 8,406 feet. He was of Peruvian\r\nparentage and born in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the accident was never ascertained, but it was\r\nsurmised that the sudden starting of his engine preparatory to landing\r\noverstressed some part of the structure already fatigued from hard\r\nusage. However this be, the committee recognized that Chavez had with\r\nexcellent skill covered all the really difficult and dangerous part\r\nof this journey. Accordingly they very generously waived the exact\r\nletter of the rules, and awarded him one half the prize, though he had\r\ncompleted but one third of the journey.\r\n\r\nQuite as dangerous, spectacular and brilliant as the flight across\r\nthe Alps, though less arduous, was Hubert Latham’s aërial voyage over\r\nBaltimore. On previous occasions cross-city flights had been made,\r\nbut never one of such length or one executed under such exacting\r\nconditions. At various times aviators had flown above Paris, Rome,\r\nBerlin, etc. On October 14th Mr. White had flown across Washington,\r\nlanding on a narrow street between the White House and War Department;\r\non October 15th Leganeaux had flown above Paris with a passenger; but\r\nthese were short flights over an uncharted course. Latham’s voyage\r\nwas unique; for he had to follow a long and a prescribed course over\r\nthe business section and closely built residence portion of the city.\r\nThis great exploit was an exhibition flight made on the invitation\r\nof the _Baltimore Sun_ for a sum of $5,000. It was to be made at the\r\ntime of the Baltimore aviation tournament at Halethorpe, Md., and was\r\ncalculated to be seen by half a million people; for the whole city was\r\nto be notified and would cease its usual activities to witness the rare\r\nand hazardous demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was triumphant and glorious in every feature. Starting from\r\nthe aviation ground, seven miles south of Baltimore, about noon on\r\nNovember 7th, Latham drove his beautiful _Antoinette_ about the field\r\nin an ascending spiral, like some imperial bird taking its bearings;\r\nthen, chart in hand, deliberately sailed away over his elaborately\r\nprescribed journey. This was a figure 8 course with its bottom at the\r\naviation field and its center at the _Sun_ Building in the heart of\r\nBaltimore, the whole length being 22 miles. As the long-winged bird\r\nin majestic poise, with the intrepid rider on its back, approached\r\nin the distance, soaring 1,000 feet above the gleaming waters of the\r\nChesapeake, the great bell of the City Hall sounded a mighty peal, and\r\nthe whole populace responded in tumultuous chorus; whistles, bells and\r\na myriad voices mingling their heartiest welcome to the bravest of\r\naviators. With arrowlike speed and directness he rounded the center of\r\nthe course at the _Sun_ Building, then looped the vast northern half of\r\nthe city, flying a thousand to three thousand feet high, more easily\r\nto parry the surging eddies of the northwest wind; rounded again the\r\ncenter of his course and then returned to the aviation field, where he\r\nlanded with infinite coolness before the excited throng of applauding\r\nspectators, whose acclaim was all too feeble to express their mingled\r\nwonder, admiration and delight. The voyage lasted forty-two minutes and\r\nfulfilled perfectly every minute requirement, including a short circle\r\nand salutation before the home of Mr. Ross Winans, an invalid gentleman\r\nwho had solicited this unique favor, and rewarded it with a gift of\r\n$500. It was the climax of the aviation week at Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAmong the many brilliant flights of that memorable year of strenuous\r\npiloting will long be remembered the voyage of the Hon. C. S. Rolls to\r\nCalais and return without landing, and that of Mr. Sopwith, already\r\nrecounted; the splendid flight of Mr. Clifford B. Harmon in his Farman\r\nbiplane from Mineola, Long Island, to a small rounded island before\r\nhis house on the Connecticut shore, for the trophy offered by _Country\r\nLife_ to the first person who should fly across Long Island Sound;\r\nHenri Farman’s flight of December 18th, for the Michelin long-distance\r\nprize, covering 288 miles, and establishing a new endurance record of\r\n8 hours 23 minutes; Mlle. Helene Dutrieu’s flight of December 21st,\r\nfor the Coupe Femina, covering 103¾ miles in 2 hours and 35 minutes\r\nin a Farman biplane. Interesting, too, were the first attempt to fly\r\nfrom Paris to Brussels with a passenger, when Mahieu and Manihé on\r\nstarting were brought to bay by a vicious dog which violently attacked\r\nthe propeller and was cut in two; and when Loridan and Fay landed on a\r\ntree, from which they descended by a ladder. After this followed the\r\nglorious voyage of Henri Wijnmalen, the youthful and many-sided Dutch\r\nsport, for the prize of 150,000 francs offered by the Automobile Club\r\nof France for the quickest aëroplane trip not exceeding 36 hours, with\r\na passenger from Paris to Brussels and return. This voyage of some\r\n320 miles was valiantly accomplished by Wijnmalen and his companion\r\nDufour, in a day and a half, of 13.2 effective hours, and in weather\r\nfor the most part windy or tempestuous. Finally to the foregoing list\r\nof splendid achievements must be added the glorious voyage of John\r\nMoisant, who in August flew with a passenger, by compass, from Paris to\r\nLondon, though he had never been over the route before and had only\r\njust learned to use an aëroplane.\r\n\r\nThe International Aviation Tournament of 1910, held at Belmont Park,\r\nLong Island, October 22d to 31st, was the most prominent and eventful\r\nmeet of the year, and the second of its kind in history, as the\r\nmeeting of the preceding year at Rheims was the first. The present\r\nmeet was conducted by the Aëro Corporation, Limited, of New York,\r\nunder the auspices and official sanction of the Aëro Club of America,\r\nrepresenting the Federation Aëronautique Internationale.\r\n\r\nThis tournament was the annual aërial Olympic contest of the world, and\r\nshould have been indicative not only of the aviator’s skill, but also\r\nof the state of national progress in the science and art of aëroplane\r\nconstruction. Unfortunately, however, for the prestige of the most\r\ndeserving nations, the rules of the International Aëronautic Federation\r\ndid not confine the contestants to the use of home-built machines, to\r\nprevent the glory of winning the international contest from passing to\r\nthe nation which merely furnished the operator, a person who might be\r\nan illiterate jockey, and representative of a country wholly devoid of\r\nscience. As luck decided, however, the highest honor in 1910 was won by\r\na first-class French machine driven by a first-class English aviator.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the raw material and working elements of this meet\r\nwere most satisfactory. The site is near the wealthiest and most\r\npopulous center in America. The grounds are spacious and level,\r\nand provided with all the equipment of a great race course; the\r\ntransportation facilities by carriage and by rail from the heart of\r\nNew York are adequate to every requirement. The personnel of the\r\nmeet comprised the most experienced and most devoted members of the\r\nAëro Club of America, the oldest and strongest aëronautical body in\r\nthe western world, and the only one representing the International\r\nAëronautic Federation. It is true the season was late and the weather\r\nwould probably be cold and tempestuous; the management was burdened by\r\na costly license, whether just or unjust, imposed upon it as the price\r\nof immunity from patent litigation; the remaining time, after the final\r\nplacement of the meet, was all too short for the myriad preparations\r\nto be made. But whatever the obstacles, physical or financial, the\r\npersonnel was paramount, and naturally made the huge tournament a\r\nglorious triumph. It was the cardinal sporting event of the year.\r\n\r\nThe status of aviation was well represented in both pilots and\r\nmachines. Twenty-seven aviators were entered on the program, many of\r\nthem world famous. Of these Alfred Le Blanc, Hubert Latham, Emile\r\nAubrun were the formidable champions of France in the contest for the\r\nJames Gordon Bennett aviation trophy; Claude Grahame-White, James\r\nRadley, A. Ogilvie represented England; while Walter Brookins, J. A.\r\nDrexel, Charles K. Hamilton were enlisted as defenders of the coveted\r\ncup and of American prestige. All told, the aviators brought with them\r\nnearly two-score machines, ranging in capacity from 30 to 100 horse\r\npower. Of these about half were monoplanes and half biplanes, for the\r\nmost part of French and American manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe prizes and remuneration awarded to the contestants were on a\r\nscale proportionate to their skill and number. All told the winnings\r\naggregated more than $60,000. Further appropriations were made to\r\ncover the expenses of the aviators, and a further sum equal to about\r\nforty per cent of the winnings was paid for immunity from prosecution\r\nfor possible infringement of an unlitigated patent. Considering the\r\nimmense expenditures for buildings, for policing and other incidentals\r\nof the meet, it may be readily inferred that there was an ample\r\ndeficit, and that the air men as a whole were much better rewarded\r\nthan some of the sportsmen who gave so much time and labor to the\r\norganization of the tournament.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous feature of the meet was the display of hardiness and\r\nskill of several of the aviators in facing the cold and tempestuous\r\nweather. This was particularly characteristic of Latham in his\r\n_Antoinette_ monoplane, and of Ralph Johnstone and Arch Hoxsey in\r\nWright biplanes. On October 27th Latham flew round the regular course\r\nfor an hour when it was nearly impossible to turn the pylons against\r\nthe fierce wind, while Johnstone and Hoxsey performed lofty altitude\r\nflights in a powerful gale which carried them backward, sometimes at\r\nthe rate of 40 miles an hour. As a consequence they landed in the\r\nopen country, remained overnight and returned next day. Johnstone was\r\ncarried backward to Holtsville, 55 miles east of the aviation grounds,\r\nand Hoxsey was blown to Brentwood, 25 miles away, both landing at dusk\r\nin open fields, and both having attained great elevations: Hoxsey,\r\n6,903 feet; Johnstone, 8,471 feet.\r\n\r\nAn interesting novelty of the aviation week, at least to Americans,\r\nwere the erratic Demoiselle monoplanes, invented by Santos-Dumont and\r\npiloted by Garros and Audemars. These aëroplanes were notable as having\r\nthe pilot under the sustaining plane, and the engine above with its\r\ndirect mounted propeller. The lateral stability was enhanced by a low\r\nplacement of the center of mass, and by a slight dihedral inclination\r\nof the wings. Furthermore, as there was not much leverage or surface in\r\nthe rear double rudder, the flight was more stable than steady, like\r\nthat of a propelled parachute. In fact, the little monoplanes pitched,\r\nrocked, and fluttered about so like huge butterflies as to provoke\r\nconstant merriment. They gave a faint suggestion of how ludicrous\r\naëroplane clowns could be made by one who has genius for such things.\r\n\r\nBarring the stormy voyages above mentioned, the most memorable events\r\nof the tournament were the Gordon Bennett speed contest, the Statue of\r\nLiberty race and Johnstone’s great altitude flight. Of the numerous\r\nother performances little need be said, except that they contributed\r\nto the general success of an elaborate and most interesting program.\r\nThey served the daily need of a costly tournament; they delighted vast\r\nthrongs of spectators whose admission fees helped to promote the aërial\r\nsport; but they did not of themselves have more than local interest, or\r\nconstitute an advance in the records of first-class achievement.\r\n\r\nThe chief race of the meet, the James Gordon Bennett speed contest,\r\nwas scheduled for Saturday, October 29th. The prize of $5,000 and the\r\ncoveted cup were to be awarded to the pilot who should make the best\r\naverage speed in 20 laps over a 5-kilometer course, aggregating 100\r\nkilometers, or 62.14 miles. The winner should have the distinguished\r\nhonor of taking to his own country the next annual contest for the\r\nprecious speed prize.\r\n\r\nGrahame-White, England’s foremost aviator and strongest hope in\r\nthe contest, brought forth his untried 100-horse Blériot in the\r\ncalmest part of the day, and took wing a quarter before nine. He\r\nflew with steady poise and swift, well-sustained speed, completing\r\nthe 100-kilometer distance in 1 hour 1 minute and 4.7 seconds, at an\r\naverage speed of 61 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nLe Blanc, the most likely winner of all, sailed at nine o’clock. He was\r\nmounted on a 100-horse Blériot with nearly flat wings, the swiftest\r\nmonoplane of French manufacture. He was the boldest, sturdiest and\r\nmost dexterous pilot in a nation of renowned aviators, the winner of\r\nunnumbered trophies, the “Vainquer de l’Est.” He now flew at unwonted\r\nspeed, establishing new world records at every round of the course. It\r\nseemed evident to the timers that only an accident to this impetuous\r\nFrenchman could retrieve the glory of England and save that of America.\r\nSuddenly the accident came. In the last lap, when victory seemed\r\nassured, the gasoline failed; the monoplane shot downward, knocked off\r\na telegraph pole, and, with broken frame and engine, fell crashing\r\nto earth, entangling the brave aviator. Le Blanc was cut and bruised\r\nabout the forehead, and was taken to the hospital to be bandaged,\r\nnot seriously injured but in a towering rage, suspecting that some\r\ntrickery had given him a shortage of fuel. He had lost the day, though\r\nhis average speed for the whole flight was 67 miles an hour as against\r\nGrahame-White’s speed of 61 miles.\r\n\r\nNo well-tried machine was available to defend the American prestige.\r\nCurtiss had constructed a new monoplane designed for speed, but though\r\nhe had brought the cup to America, he was not chosen as one of its\r\nthree defenders. The little Wright biplane of 61 horse power had\r\nflown a few minutes with great velocity, and was looked to with some\r\nconfidence. Mounted by Walter Brookins, it set out with tremendous\r\nspeed, but had only well started when the cylinders began to miss fire.\r\nBrookins turned toward the infield to land, struck the ground with\r\nterrific shock and tumbled violently on the field beside his broken\r\nmachine. He, too, was taken to the hospital for treatment, but was not\r\nseriously injured.\r\n\r\nIt was now granted that Grahame-White would be the ultimate winner.\r\nOther aviators attempted to defeat him, but lacked either the necessary\r\nspeed or endurance. The cup was accordingly taken from the nations\r\nthat had done the most to develop the practical art of aëroplaning. Of\r\nthese two nations, the one most deserving of victory, by virtue of its\r\nmore careful preparation, was defeated by an extraordinary mishap, when\r\nvictory was at hand; the other failed perhaps for want of preparation\r\nrather than from lack of manipulative or constructive skill.\r\n\r\nOf the various highly coveted stakes the largest in monetary value was\r\nknown as the Thomas F. Ryan Statue of Liberty Prize. This was a cash\r\nsum of $10,000, to be awarded to the properly qualified contestant who\r\nshould fly from the aviation ground to and around the Statue of Liberty\r\nin New York Harbor, and return in the shortest time, the airline\r\ndistance being 16 miles each way. The prize was founded by Mr. Thomas\r\nF. Ryan, whose son, Allan A. Ryan, was Chairman of the Committee on\r\nArrangements of the tournament, and who though suffering with pain and\r\nill-health, labored so indefatigably to insure the success of the event\r\nso germain to the aëronautical prestige of his country.\r\n\r\nThe Statue of Liberty race occurred on Sunday afternoon, October 30th,\r\nbeginning just after three o’clock. Count De Lesseps in a 50-horse\r\nBlériot monoplane led the race, followed three minutes later by\r\nGrahame-White. They passed toward the southwest in perfect poise and\r\nvanished beyond the horizon unchallenged by an American contestant;\r\nfor Moisant, the American champion, had shortly before injured his\r\nracing monoplane, and the other American racing machines had been\r\ndamaged the week before, or had not yet been fully tested. But with\r\nadmirable enterprise, Moisant telephoned Le Blanc, in New York, who\r\nwas not racing because of the accident to his 100-horse Blériot the\r\nday previously, and offered the Frenchman $10,000 for his 50-horse\r\nBlériot monoplane. The sale was effected in time for the race that\r\nday. But for all that the enterprise seemed futile; for as Moisant\r\nwas preparing to start, the others were returning, Grahame-White well\r\nin the lead, having overtaken De Lesseps. As these two aviators were\r\nreceiving the applause of innumerable spectators and the felicitations\r\nof their friends, audacious Moisant, the impetuous soldier of fortune,\r\nand hero of the famous flight by compass from Paris to London, started\r\ntoward the declining sun, just after four o’clock. He was determined\r\nto win by superior skill and daring. His prudent competitors had\r\nfollowed a circuitous southern route interspersed with landing places;\r\nbut he flew like a maniac straight over the church spires and crowded\r\nbuildings of Brooklyn, guided to his goal by a compass, rounded the\r\nStatue of Liberty at a great altitude and plunged homeward with all\r\npossible speed and directness. The megaphone announced his progress,\r\nwhich indicated some hope of victory so little expected and so much\r\ndesired by the vast throng that stood gazing toward the western sun.\r\nIn headlong career the swooping monoplane shot by the judges’ stand,\r\ncircled and softly landed on the field, triumphant by 43 seconds\r\nover the 100-horse Blériot of Grahame-White. As the intrepid aviator\r\napproached the vast and delighted throng of spectators to acknowledge\r\nits noisy and tumultuous ovation, he was met by the chiefs of the\r\ntournament, draped in an American flag, and paraded before the grand\r\nstand, “which shook in its effort to do honor to the little air\r\nconqueror.” Ultimately, however, the prize was awarded to Count\r\nDe Lesseps, because Moisant had failed to qualify properly, and\r\nGrahame-White had fouled the initial pylon.\r\n\r\nThe final day of the tournament was made memorable by Johnstone’s\r\naltitude flight. The best previous record was that of Wijnmalen to an\r\nelevation of 9,104 feet, made at Mourmelon, France. Johnstone ascended\r\non a small Wright machine with powerful propellers adapted to rapid\r\nclimbing, determined not only to surpass Wijnmalen but to exceed,\r\nif possible, the ten-thousand-foot level, and win the special prize\r\noffered for such achievement. He actually rose to the great elevation\r\nof 9,714 feet, but could not develop power enough to continue upward.\r\nOn his descent he fully exhausted his fuel at 3,000 feet, and thence\r\nglided to earth, landing softly, 1 hour and 43 minutes from the time of\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\nThus the greatest tournament of the year terminated with fine new\r\nlaurels for the science and art of aviation; for the spectacular\r\npilots and for the unseen men behind them—the scientific men in the\r\nlaboratories, the designing rooms and the workshops. New standards had\r\nbeen established in speed, in altitude, in prowess and daring. In these\r\nelements, the spectators could hardly ask for a better exhibition. What\r\nis it to the onlooker to have an aëroplane go higher than the cumuli,\r\nsince at that level a thousand feet makes no perceptible difference?\r\nWhat more could he wish in dexterity of manipulation and audacity in\r\nbraving the elements? One thing more, doubtless, and that is, security\r\nand precision of flight in stormy weather. When these improvements\r\nshall have been effected much will have been added to both the sportive\r\ninterest and practical utility of the aëroplane.\r\n\r\nThe most businesslike and crucial flying contest of the year was the\r\nfamous “Circuit de l’Est,” organized by the Paris _Matin_. It was a\r\ncompetitive voyage over an irregular hexagonal course, lying generally\r\nnortheast of Paris, and having its vertices at various cities to the\r\neast and north of the national capital. The main prize offered by\r\nthe _Matin_ was one hundred thousand francs for the first air man to\r\ncomplete the entire course, doing the first side of the hexagon on\r\nAugust 7th, and the succeeding sides in regular order on successive\r\nodd days of the month, the place and hour of starting each stage\r\nbeing assigned in advance. Various subsidiary prizes aggregating\r\nnearly a hundred thousand francs more, were available for meritorious\r\nperformances at the various stages and stopping-places along the\r\nroute. But there were also penalizations for those contestants who\r\nfailed to start on schedule time and observe the rules of the course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—MAP OF THE “CIRCUIT DE L’EST.”]\r\n\r\nThe race began at Issy, near Paris, on August 7th, with eight aviators\r\non the wing—Le Blanc, Aubrun, Leganeaux, Mamet, Lindpainter, Weyman. It\r\nterminated August 17th, headed by Alfred Le Blanc on his Blériot, and\r\nfollowed by Emile Aubrun on a Blériot, then by Weyman on a Farman, all\r\nthree driven by Gnome engines actuating Chauvière propellers. Le Blanc\r\ncompleted the tour of six stages, covering an air-line distance of 488\r\nmiles, in 12 hours’ effective flying, or at the average rate of 40.6\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nThis long tour on schedule time over a rough and varied country in\r\nface of fog, wind and rain, was a most severe trial of the prowess and\r\nendurance of the brave pilots who had the hardiness and pertinacity\r\nto complete the voyage. Needless to add that it created unbounded\r\nenthusiasm among millions of people who witnessed the event, or read of\r\nit, and that the clocklike precision of the “grand raid” inspired new\r\nconfidence in the practicability of the aëroplane.\r\n\r\nA particularly impressive feature of the event was that many of its\r\nparticipants, the aviators, government officers, and members of the\r\ncontrolling committee, assembled at Issy and other posts of duty,\r\nnot by rail, but by aëroplane, sailing across country from many\r\ndirections and from great distances. This matter-of-fact procedure led\r\nmany persons to believe that the period of mere demonstrations had\r\napproached its close, and that the epoch of practical utility was at\r\nhand; that after marveling so much at the aëroplane, with mingled faith\r\nand skepticism, people would next calmly turn it to practical use.\r\n\r\nThough the progress in designing and constructing aëroplanes in 1910\r\ndid not keep pace with the wonderful advance in new records, still the\r\ninventors and manufacturers continued industriously to perfect the\r\ndetails of their best standard machines, and in a few instances to\r\nmake radical innovations. The perfection in details of construction\r\nmanifested itself in the public performance of aëroplanes, particularly\r\nin their greater reliability and their increased capabilities. The\r\nradical innovations were mainly experimental, and not generally\r\nexhibited, though none the less important for all that. Chief of these\r\nperhaps were the hydro-aëroplane developments of Fabre in France, and\r\nof Mr. Glenn H. Curtiss in America, which enabled the aviator to launch\r\ninto the air directly from the water and to alight safely on the water,\r\nthus virtually adding a new and very important domain to the empire of\r\ndynamic flight.\r\n\r\nCurtiss, in 1909, succeeded in landing his aëroplane safely on the\r\nwater of Lake Keuka, first with sheet iron cylindrical floats under\r\neach wing, and a simple float well to the front of his protruding\r\nchassis, then with a hydroplane surface to the front as being more\r\neffective than the float. But when he attempted to glide up from the\r\nlake with this arrangement, he could not entirely clear the surface,\r\nthough his aëroplane under the powerful thrust of her aërial screw,\r\nvery nearly lifted from the water. Then he planned to use hydroplane\r\nfloats, of hollow wing form, and of such size that they would buoy up\r\nthe machine when at rest, and during motion would skim over the water\r\nlike a skipping stone, till the biplane should acquire sufficient speed\r\nto rise by the dynamic reaction of the air. In the successful execution\r\nof this plan, however, he was anticipated by Fabre, who made the first\r\nsuccessful flight from the water, on March 28th, 1910, at Martigues,\r\nFrance. But the Frenchman was not left to bear the palm alone. Early in\r\nthe year 1911, Mr. Curtiss rose and landed successfully on the water at\r\nSan Diego Bay, Cal., by means of a single float like a flatboat placed\r\ncentrally under his biplane, seconded by small auxiliary floats at the\r\nwing ends. A full account of these valuable contributions to aviation\r\nis given in Appendix V.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FABRE HYDRO-AËROPLANE.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAULHAN HYDRO-AËROPLANE.\r\n\r\n_Photo E. Levick, N. Y._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOISANT METAL MONOPLANE.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy A. J. Moisant.)]\r\n\r\nAs shown in Plate XXXI, Fabre’s hydro-aëroplane was substantially a\r\nmonoplane mounted on three richochet floats. It was propelled by a\r\nscrew at the rear, and controlled in flight by the usual three-torque\r\nsystem, in this case consisting of horizontal rudders in front,\r\nvertical rudders front and rear, and suitable mechanism for twisting\r\nthe wings. The floats were hollow to give them static buoyancy; they\r\nwere curved fore and aft like wings, to give them dynamic lift, both in\r\nwater and in air; they were elastically constructed with thin veneer\r\nbottoms and flexibly attached to the framing, so as to endure the\r\nsevere buffeting, at high speeds, against the uneven water surface;\r\nthey were capable of landing the machine safely on a sandy beach or\r\nmeadow, as well as on the water. Indeed, a plan was conceived for\r\nrising and alighting on land and water indifferently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—DIAGRAM OF CURTISS HYDRO-AËROPLANE.\r\n(_Scientific American._)]\r\n\r\nThe first machine weighed in flight 950 pounds and spread 280 square\r\nfeet of surface, giving a loading of 3.4 pounds per square foot. It was\r\ndriven by a 50-horse Gnome engine actuating a Chauvière propeller 7.5\r\nfeet in diameter. In the trials of March 28th, the machine cleared the\r\nwater at a speed of 34 miles per hour, and flew about one-third of a\r\nmile, at an elevation of two to three yards; then at the will of the\r\noperator it alighted softly on the water.\r\n\r\nThe structural design of the Fabre monoplane was novel and unique, not\r\nto say radical. The wing framing consisted of a single Fabre trussed\r\nbeam with ribs attached like the quills of a bird, over which was\r\nstretched the light sailcloth cover, then laced to the beam. The girder\r\nitself was formed of two ash planks eight inches wide by one-fourth\r\ninch thick trussed together by flat steel plates zigzagging trelliswise\r\nbetween them. As all parts of the beam cut the air edgewise it offered\r\nvery little resistance, while at the same time being very strong. The\r\nribs being attached only at one end allowed the sailcloth to be quickly\r\nslipped on and off for washing and proper care.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of Fabre’s wing construction were adopted\r\nby Paulhan in his novel and picturesque biplane shown in Plate\r\nXXXI. Trussed beams were used for all parts requiring considerable\r\nstiffness, the longitudinal ones being covered with fabric to reduce\r\nthe resistance. The wings whose solid ribs were fastened only at their\r\nfront ends were quite elastic, a quality conducive to stability, as\r\nlong taught by writers[55] on aviation. In addition to the front\r\nrudder, there was at the rear a horizontal rudder with a vertical one\r\njust before it. To reduce the air resistance further the pilot and\r\npassenger were to sit tandem in a torpedo-shaped car with the 50-horse\r\nGnome engine and fuel tank back of them. Beneath the longitudinal\r\ngirders were two Farman skids flanked with the usual wheels,\r\nelastically connected. The machine, besides flying well, was readily\r\ndemountable. The wings could be quickly removed, thus allowing the\r\nbiplane to enter a door fifteen feet wide. The entire machine could be\r\npacked in a case 15½ feet long by 3¼ feet square, the whole case cubing\r\nless than six solid yards. Hundreds of them, therefore, could be stowed\r\naway in an ocean cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe flying quality of adequately designed flexible aëroplanes is well\r\nillustrated by the swallowlike monoplane shown in Fig. 43. This airy\r\ncreation of the distinguished Austrian engineer, Igo Etrich, came into\r\npublic prominence in the spring of 1910, though it had been developing\r\nprivately for half a decade or more. On May 14th, near Vienna, it\r\ncarried pilot Illner 84 kilometers in 80 minutes, at an elevation of\r\n300 meters, thus surpassing all previous Austrian records for distance,\r\nduration and altitude. Its successor, _Etrich IV_, had wing tips still\r\nmore turned up, and possessed such stability that during the meet at\r\nJohannisthal in October, Illner circled the pylons with his hands off\r\nthe warping levers. At times he wheeled round curves of only ten meters\r\nradius, the whole machine tilted at an alarming angle, yet maintaining\r\nits poise with the natural ease and grace of a soaring albatross.\r\n\r\nThe prominent feature of Etrich’s monoplane was the elastic\r\nconstruction of its wings and tail. Across the rigid main bars of each\r\nwing were fastened numerous ribs with bamboo terminals, thus making\r\nthe rear margin and tip of the wing flexible. Similarly the tail, or\r\nhorizontal rudder, was framed of bamboo. Hence the pilot, by use of\r\ncontrol wires, could flex both the wing margins and the tail up and\r\ndown at will, to steer the machine, or he could let go the controls and\r\nallow the distorted surfaces to spring into their normal positions,\r\nand the machine to pursue the even tenor of its way. Moreover, the\r\ngusts and whirls in the air, on striking the elastic rear margins of\r\nthe tail and wings, exert a propulsive effort. Thus could be utilized\r\nthe wind’s energy of turbulence, as indicated by the present writer\r\nin 1893, in a paper on “Windgusts and Their Relation to Flight,”\r\npublished in the _Proceedings of the International Conference on Aërial\r\nNavigation_ of that year. In passing it may be remarked that many other\r\naëroplane designers, notably Bréguet, have emulated Mr. Etrich, though\r\nunconsciously perhaps, in providing elastic ribs, hinges or pivots to\r\npermit the rear parts of the wings and tails of their machines to yield\r\nfreely to intentional or unusual impulses, and then spring back to\r\ntheir normal positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—THE ETRICH MONOPLANE OF 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe carefully elaborated monoplane of Robert Esnault-Pélterie, which\r\nhad been steadily improving for eight years, had now attained great\r\nperfection of finish, and merited prominence in actual flight. As shown\r\nin Plate XXIX, it had a general resemblance to the _Antoinette_, though\r\ndiffering throughout in its manifold details. The stream-line body was\r\nof steel tubing, braced with wire, and tightly covered with smooth\r\nfabric to reduce resistance. A five-cylinder R. E. P. motor in front\r\nconnected directly with the two-blade propeller. The pilot sat between\r\nthe wings with the passenger before him at the center of gravity, both\r\nhaving control levers when desired for instruction. The wings could be\r\nwarped and the rudders, at the end of ample empennage planes, occupied\r\nthe extreme rear as shown. An elastically cushioned skid between the\r\ntwo freely turning wheels served to absorb the shock of hard landing,\r\nthough usually not touching the ground. The R. E. P. monoplane of 1910\r\nwas a very graceful, swift and strong machine, of marked efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs always happens in the many-minded development of a complex\r\ninvention, the general exhibition and use of the aëroplane led toward\r\nuniformity of design. This became particularly noticeable during the\r\nworld-wide demonstrations of 1909 and 1910. Whatever predilection the\r\ninventor might have for his own devices, he would rather cast them\r\naside than lose at the tournament and in the market. Without a monopoly\r\nof the flying art, he could ill afford to retain too affectionately\r\nhis own second-rate device in competition with a rival having a more\r\neffective one. Accordingly there was a judicious and general adoption\r\nof those devices which had proved best in practice, from whatever lowly\r\nintellect they had emanated. Thus there was a marked tendency to the\r\ngeneral use of starting wheels, landing skids, large warping surfaces,\r\nand, in racing machines, to the stream line concentration of the load,\r\nand the severe elimination of resistance.\r\n\r\nA few examples will illustrate this tendency to choose the most\r\npractical devices from the world’s general stock. The Wright brothers,\r\nwho, following Maxim, had been ardent votaries of the forward\r\nhorizontal rudder, discarded this in 1910 for the elastic rear\r\nhorizontal rudder introduced by Etrich. At the same time they abandoned\r\nthe antiquated catapult introduced by Langley, and adopted the\r\ncombination of wheels and skids introduced by Farman. In their racing\r\nmachine they no longer placed the aviator beside his engine, presenting\r\na broad front to the wind, but, like Curtiss and foreign designers,\r\nthey placed the driver and power plant in line, to diminish the\r\natmospheric resistance. These manifold and timely improvements indicate\r\nclearly the advantages to mankind of an “open door” in a crescent art.\r\n\r\nBut if the Wrights adopted the most successful devices of their\r\nneighbors, these in turn were not slow to reciprocate that policy.\r\nThere was ample recognition of the merit of the combination of warping\r\nsustainers and double rudder proposed by scientific men before the\r\nadvent of power aëroplanes, and so admirably employed by the Wrights\r\nand Prof. Montgomery in their early coasting flights. The warping wing\r\nwas quite generally used on monoplanes in 1910; not to mention the\r\n_ailerons_, which frequently were an adaptation of the same principle.\r\n\r\nAs further illustrations, it may be noted that Voisin brothers adopted\r\nthe Farman _ailerons_ and abandoned the cellular type of sustaining\r\nsurface introduced by Hargrave, finding the vertical surfaces strongly\r\nfrictional and unnecessary for lateral equilibrium, in presence of\r\nthe _ailerons_. They also abandoned the forward horizontal rudder,\r\nseeing that it could very well be omitted. On the other hand, it must\r\nbe observed that the Farmans, Sommer and Curtiss still retained the\r\ncombined fore and aft rudder. Curtiss and Farman also tried their hands\r\nat monoplane construction, though without abandoning the biplane. The\r\nmost famous monoplanists, however, held firmly to their first love.\r\nIn this they were emulated by many new designers, Nieuport, Hanriot,\r\nDéperdussin, etc. These show a marked tendency to employ smoothly\r\ncovered hulls shaped after the fish or torpedo.\r\n\r\nTo drive the little aëroplanes so far developed, especially the\r\nracers, there was a general preference for a single-screw propeller\r\nmounted directly on the engine shaft, though doubtless for machines\r\nweighing many tons a multiplicity of such propellers would be used.\r\nTheoretically the advantage of twin screws was conceded, but in\r\npractice they were employed by very few constructors. The Chauvière\r\nwooden propeller was the favorite in France, and was approved by\r\nthe constructors of propellers elsewhere, at least in its general\r\nfeatures. The Voisin firm, indeed, still adhered to the metal\r\npropeller, and occasionally some experimentalist employed the more\r\nvenerable French screw consisting of radial sticks covered with fabric.\r\nBut the great records in the sporting world were achieved with solid\r\nwooden propellers.\r\n\r\nA special chapter would be required to describe the various motors,\r\neven cursorily. Their relative values, however, may be summarized in\r\nthe following brief words by Réné Gasnier, in the _Aërophile_ for\r\nNovember, 1910:\r\n\r\n  “Last year we had but few light types; this year there is no\r\n  dearth of them, and at their head stands that admirable motor\r\n  _Gnome_, which has enabled aviators to accomplish all their\r\n  fine performances. At first many persons had no confidence in\r\n  the future of the rotatory motor. One must bow to the facts;\r\n  on considering the nature of this motor it is seen to be of\r\n  an admirable simplicity. It is evidently the typical aviation\r\n  motor, and an approach toward the veritable rotatory motor\r\n  which later will be the turbine. Numerous motors of four to\r\n  eight cylinders are very well spoken of, but none attain the\r\n  lightness of the _Gnome_. Among the air-cooled motors the\r\n  _Esnault-Pélterie_ is remarkable for the series of trials it\r\n  has endured, and among water-cooled motors we may cite the\r\n  splendid performance of the _Antoinette_—2,100 kilometers in\r\n  one week at the Bordeaux meeting. This would be quite a good\r\n  run even in an automobile. It is noticeable that the aëroplane\r\n  motor tends distinctly to differentiate itself from its senior,\r\n  the automobile motor, and assume a type absolutely adapted\r\n  to its special work. In addition to the greatest possible\r\n  lightness, a demand now arises for a slight consumption of\r\n  fuel, and a range of speed which is indispensable for landing.\r\n  It is dangerous to descend rapidly with the motor at full\r\n  speed; on the other hand, in cutting off the ignition to glide\r\n  down, one risks not being able to restart the motor, if need\r\n  be, while if the motor relax sufficiently the descent takes\r\n  place in perfect security. It suffices to speed up at the right\r\n  moment.”\r\n\r\nThe practical utility of aviation began now to be questioned. The\r\naëroplane had passed the primary epoch of experimental development\r\nand was becoming a standard article of manufacture representing a\r\nconsiderable industry. But what was it all worth? Aviators had flown\r\nfaster than the eagle, higher than the clouds, farther than the common\r\ndistance from metropolis to metropolis. Schools were licensing new\r\npilots from day to day. But what career had these before them, and what\r\nessential function in the affairs of humanity could they perform? Some,\r\nindeed, might fit themselves for aërial service in warfare, some for\r\nthe pleasant profession of amusing and entertaining mankind; but in the\r\nserious business of life, what important rôle could the air men hope\r\nto play? This was the pertinent inquiry, and it was largely a question\r\nof the reliability and economy of the aëroplane. Improvement in these\r\ntwo elements might therefore receive attentive consideration in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nThe reliability of the aëroplane depends partly on its environment,\r\npartly on its plan and structure, partly on the skill of its pilot.\r\nThe pilot’s skill had been admirably developed in the tournaments and\r\npublic exhibitions. The aërodynamic design conducive to stability and\r\nsteadiness, the structural design conducive to maximum strength and\r\nresiliency, uniformly proportioned to the stress and work of each\r\npart of the complex machine; and above all the design of the motor,\r\nto ensure it against a thousand foibles—all these could be improved\r\nby the patient methods of theoretical and experimental science.\r\nThe environment could, of course, be chosen. At first only the most\r\nfavorable regions need be attempted for regular transportation, regions\r\nof level plain and farm land, or of lake and river surrounded by\r\ncountry not too rough and precipitous.\r\n\r\nThe general cost of the aëroplane to mankind depends on its plan and\r\nstructure, on the methods of manufacture, on the material running\r\nexpense; but its particular cost to the passenger is determined largely\r\nby the cupidity or business acumen of those who furnish the machine\r\nand those who operate it. Naturally when the world first awoke in\r\nthe morning of practical sporting aviation, with a sudden and strong\r\nrelish for flying, the prices would be fabulous, not to say ridiculous.\r\nDuring that hour no commercial transportation could be contemplated.\r\nBut without monopoly the prices must quickly abate; for neither the\r\nmanufacture nor manipulation of the aëroplane demand rare ability or\r\ntraining. The cost of manufacture would promptly be diminished by means\r\nof specialized tools and operatives, immediately upon the assurance\r\nof large and continuous orders. The cost of pilotage would become\r\ninsignificant when a single chauffeur could take a dozen passengers on\r\none aëroplane.\r\n\r\nSo much for the human and external elements in the cost of aviation.\r\nThe inherent and material cost of the aëroplane could also be reduced,\r\nthough perhaps less readily. It was unlikely that the machine would\r\nbe built of much cheaper materials, or made much lighter per pound of\r\ncargo. Nor were such improvements of so much importance since they\r\nwould affect only the first cost of the flyer. But an increase of\r\naërodynamic efficiency in the propeller and aëroplane proper, together\r\nwith increased thermodynamic efficiency in the motor, would materially\r\nlower the current cost of transportation at any given speed. These\r\nimprovements would require careful research in the laboratory and\r\npatient trial in the workshop and field. The refinement and perfection\r\nof the aëroplane might therefore be looked for in those communities\r\nwhere men have sufficient foresight, enterprise and liberality to endow\r\nresearch, and to encourage the science and the art of aviation to\r\nsupplement each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III\r\n\r\n                        AËRONAUTIC METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                    GENERAL PROPERTIES OF FREE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nFor aëronautic uses the atmosphere may be regarded as a mixture of two\r\nsubstances, dry air and water. The first remains always in the gaseous\r\nstate; the second shifts erratically through all possible states. Rain\r\ndrops freeze or evaporate; sleet, snow, and hail evaporate or melt;\r\nthe aqueous vapor condenses or congeals. Thus the world is wrapped in\r\na dual sea, one part naturally serene, the other capricious, protean,\r\nand turbulent. Dry air, indeed, is a composite of many gases of vast\r\nconcern in chemistry and biology; but in relation to aëronautics it\r\nis practically a single permanent gas. This placid element and its\r\ninconstant mate, so curiously mingled, constitute the medium whose flux\r\nand vicissitudes the aërial sailor has duly to learn before he can\r\nnavigate with skill or safety.[56]\r\n\r\nBut these aërial oceans, the moist and dry, are of very different\r\ndepth. They commingle only in the lower levels of the atmosphere, whose\r\nqualities vary accordingly, both physical and transportational. While\r\nthe dry air may reach up to more than a hundred miles, substantial\r\nenough to singe a meteorite, the sea of aqueous vapor is bounded\r\npractically by the shallow region of the visible clouds. Beyond the\r\nfeather-like cirri, which just overtop the loftiest mountain peaks,\r\nthere is scant, if any, moisture. Never rain, nor cloud is there, nor\r\ntempest nor any great perturbation. Beyond the highest excursions of\r\nthe cirri, at an elevation of some ten miles, stretches the deep ocean\r\nof eternal sunshine, of equable and nearly constant temperature. Into\r\nthat zone of perpetual serenity no tumult of the nether atmosphere\r\ncan penetrate; against the floor of the isothermal layer the cyclonic\r\ncurrents spread and dissipate. The upper air has, of course, a\r\nconsiderable drift, like a majestic river or stream of the sea, but\r\nnever turmoil or tempest disturbs its stately march.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, therefore, that lofty ocean is an ideal one for swift\r\ntransportation. But at present it is beyond the range of any navigable\r\ncraft of human invention. Occasionally, indeed, a gauzy balloon from\r\nthe hand of some inquisitive weather sage penetrates a little way into\r\nthe exalted deep next the cosmic void, bearing its delicate recorders\r\nof heat and pressure; but it wanders alone in a silent and vast\r\nsolitude outcubing all the habitable space allotted to bird, beast\r\nand fish; then at last sinks down to deliver the story of its strange\r\nvoyage in that lifeless outer sphere. Volcanic and celestial dust may\r\nflourish there, tingeing the twilight with rosy flush, but no biologic\r\nforms from the teeming underworld may find refuge or sustenance. It is\r\nthe unconquered domain of who knows what meteoric craft of the future,\r\nsweeping the globe from continent to continent, with now unimaginable\r\ncelerity, grace and precision.\r\n\r\nIncidentally and aside from its aëronautic interest, the composition\r\nof the atmosphere may be presented in fuller detail, showing the\r\nwide variations from level to level, and the manifold complexity of\r\nthe fluid we daily breathe, not to mention the myriads of motes and\r\ngerms inhabiting every inch of it. The gaseous components and their\r\ndistribution are well exhibited in the following table,[57] which\r\nrepresents an average condition:\r\n\r\n                                TABLE I\r\n\r\n         _Percentage Distribution of Gases in the Atmosphere_\r\n\r\n  Key:  HT = Height in Kilometers.\r\n         A = Argon.\r\n         N = Nitrogen.\r\n        WV = Water Vapor.\r\n         O = Oxygen.\r\n        CD = Carbon Dioxide.\r\n        HY = Hydrogen.\r\n        HE = Helium.\r\n        TP = Total Pressure in Millimeters.\r\n  ----+--------------------------------------------------+--------\r\n      |                      GASES.             |\r\n   HT +------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+   TP\r\n      |   A  |   N   |  WV  |   O  |  CD  |   HY  |  HE  |\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+--------\r\n  150 |      |       |      |      |      | 99.73 | 0.27 |  0.0043\r\n  140 |      |       |      |      |      | 99.70 | 0.30 |  0.0048\r\n  130 |      |  0.02 |      |      |      | 99.64 | 0.34 |  0.0054\r\n  120 |      |  0.10 |      |      |      | 99.52 | 0.38 |  0.0060\r\n  110 |      |  0.40 |      | 0.02 |      | 99.16 | 0.42 |  0.0067\r\n  100 |      |  1.63 |      | 0.07 |      | 97.84 | 0.46 |  0.0076\r\n   90 |      |  6.57 |      | 0.32 |      | 92.62 | 0.49 |  0.0090\r\n   80 |      | 22.70 |      | 1.38 |      | 75.47 | 0.45 |  0.0123\r\n   70 | 0.02 | 53.73 |      | 4.0  |      | 41.95 | 0.27 |  0.0248\r\n   60 | 0.04 | 78.16 |      | 7.32 |      | 14.33 | 0.15 |  0.0810\r\n   50 | 0.08 | 86.16 |      |10.01 |      |  3.72 | 0.03 |  0.466\r\n   40 | 0.16 | 86.51 |      |12.45 |      |  0.88 |      |  1.65\r\n   30 | 0.22 | 84.48 |      |15.10 |      |  0.20 |      |  8.04\r\n   20 | 0.55 | 81.34 |      |18.05 | 0.01 |  0.05 |      | 39.6\r\n   15 | 0.74 | 79.56 |      |19.66 | 0.02 |  0.02 |      | 88.2\r\n   11 | 0.94 | 78.02 | 0.01 |20.99 | 0.03 |  0.01 |      |168\r\n    5 | 0.94 | 77.89 | 0.18 |20.95 | 0.03 |  0.01 |      |405\r\n    0 | 0.93 | 77.08 | 1.20 |20.75 | 0.03 |  0.01 |      |760\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+--------\r\n\r\nFixing attention first upon the gases other than water, it will be\r\nat once observed from the table that these gases show a very uniform\r\nmixture in the moist and turbulent region, while farther aloft the\r\nlighter of them tend to predominate in relative proportion. This\r\nuniformity of composition at the lower levels, which accords with\r\nexperience, is due to the constant circulation and turmoil in that\r\nregion. But for this constant agitation, the uniformity of mixture\r\ncould not last. If the atmosphere were perpetually at rest throughout,\r\nor moving only in horizontal flow, each constituent gas would assume\r\nthe same status and distribution as if the others were absent. Each,\r\ntherefore, obeying Dalton’s law of diffusion, would form an atmosphere\r\nof itself, independent of the others, and unaffected in density by\r\nthem. Such a condition is assumed for the higher levels. The percentage\r\ndistribution in the higher levels is calculated from the known\r\nelasticity and density of the gases, assumed as resting in perpetual\r\ncalm at a constant temperature of .55° C. beyond eleven kilometers, or\r\nabove the highest ascent of man, and, furthermore, as having at the\r\nearth’s surface 1.2 per cent moisture and a temperature of 11° C.\r\n\r\nBut only in the quiescent outersphere can that dynamic gradation be\r\nestablished or perpetuated. Below this lofty region is the sea of\r\nwater vapor, mingled intimately with the dry air, and churned with\r\nit, yet not sharing its uniformity of distribution. Why this rapid\r\ndiminution of moisture with elevation, as shown in the table? Because\r\nthroughout the moist region the temperature falls rapidly—about 6° C.\r\nper kilometer ascent above the earth—thus chilling and precipitating\r\nthe vapor, whose pressural resistance to liquefaction diminishes with\r\nwaning temperature. The explanation is obvious; but why does it not\r\napply as well to the other elements of the atmosphere: why do not the\r\nother gases present liquefy with falling temperature as well as the\r\nwater vapor, which is merely water in the gaseous state? The question\r\ncannot be answered very profoundly, but an essential condition of\r\nliquefaction of any gas can be stated in learned phraseology, after the\r\npreliminary exposition of certain general properties of matter.\r\n\r\nWe may first set forth those general physical properties, then apply\r\nthem to answering the above question. Every known substance may exist\r\nin either of three states, the solid, liquid or gaseous. For every\r\nsubstance there is a critical temperature above which it can exist\r\nonly as a gas, and cannot be liquefied by any pressure, but below\r\nwhich a suitable pressure will cause liquefaction. Below its critical\r\ntemperature a gas is called a vapor, above it a permanent gas. Now in\r\nthe free atmosphere some of the gases are never below their critical\r\ntemperatures and, therefore, cannot be liquefied by any pressure,\r\nwithout special cooling; others are sometimes below their critical\r\ntemperatures and are then capable of liquefaction by sufficient\r\npressure, which however is not always found in free space, but can be\r\nsupplied by a compression pump; one other gas, that is water vapor,\r\nis always below its critical temperature in the free atmosphere, and\r\ntherefore may always be turned into water by sufficient pressure at its\r\nactual atmospheric temperature. Such sufficient pressure in the water\r\nvapor actually occurs from time to time in all parts of the atmosphere\r\nfrom the earth’s surface to the highest cirrus region, but more\r\nfrequently in the nimbus levels, a mile or two above the earth. Thus\r\nat all parts of the lower atmosphere liquefaction of aqueous vapor is\r\nsometimes observed, either as mist or rain, snow or ice particles, and\r\non the earth as dew or frost. In order to illustrate the above ideas\r\nby numerical citation, the accompanying table is given, showing the\r\ncritical temperature and pressure of the chief gaseous constituents of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE II\r\n\r\n _Critical Temperature and Corresponding Pressure of Liquefaction for\r\n            the Chief Constituent Gases of the Atmosphere._\r\n\r\n  --------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                |   Critical  |   Critical\r\n    Substance   | Temperature |   Pressure\r\n                |      C.     | Atmospheres.\r\n  --------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  Dry Air       |    -140     |     39\r\n  Nitrogen      |    -146     |     34\r\n  Oxygen        |    -118     |     50\r\n  Carbonic Acid |    - 31     |     75\r\n  Argon         |    -120     |     51\r\n  Hydrogen      |    -242     |     20\r\n  Ammonia       |     130     |    115\r\n  Water         |    +365     |    200\r\n  --------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nA glance at this table shows that for the pressures and temperatures\r\nprevailing in our atmosphere most of the constituents are permanent\r\ngases. The conspicuous exception is water which, when in the gaseous\r\nstate, always exists as a vapor, and never as a permanent gas, since\r\nit never even approaches the critical temperature. Fortunately for all\r\nlife on earth the aqueous vapor condenses at very ordinary temperatures\r\nand pressures, else there would be no rainfall for irrigation and\r\ndrinking. Fortunately also the other gases do not so precipitate, else\r\nthe world might be flooded with liquid nitrogen and oxygen, entailing\r\nwho knows what disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nAfter this digression on the composition of the atmosphere, we may\r\nhenceforth regard the aërial ocean as a mixture of two substances,\r\ndry air and water; the first, a permanent gas; the second, a\r\nvariable element, existing at times in either the solid, liquid, or\r\nvaporous state. For the sake of convenience we may first study the\r\ndry atmosphere, then the moist. The dynamic properties of the dry\r\natmosphere may in large measure be deduced by an application of two\r\nwell-established laws of physics. These will be taken in order.\r\n\r\nBy careful investigation it has been proved that throughout a\r\nconsiderable range of pressure and temperature the permanent gases\r\nvery approximately obey the following law; the volume of a permanent\r\ngas varies directly as its absolute temperature and inversely as its\r\npressure. In other words the product of its pressure and volume equals\r\nthe absolute temperature multiplied by a numerical constant. This may\r\nbe expressed algebraically by the following formula:\r\n\r\n                          _PV_ = _RT_     (1)\r\n\r\nin which _P_ is the pressure and _V_ the volume of a given portion of\r\ngas at the absolute temperature _T_, and _R_ is a numerical constant\r\nfor the gas in question.\r\n\r\nThe value of _R_ in the foregoing equation has been determined\r\nexperimentally for the component gases of the atmosphere, and for dry\r\nair as a whole. For dry air, which, under such conditions as surround\r\nthe aëronaut, may be treated as a single uniform gas, the equation\r\napplied to one kilogram gives R = _PoVo/To_ = 29.27, where _Po_, _Vo_,\r\n_To_, are respectively the pressure, volume and temperature, in the\r\nmetric system, of the one kilogram of air under standard conditions;\r\ni. e., _Po_ = 10,330 kilograms per square meter, being the normal\r\natmospheric pressure; _Vo_ = 1/1.293 cubic meter, being the volume of\r\none kilogram of dry air at normal pressure and freezing temperature;\r\n_To_ = 273° C., being the absolute temperature of freezing. In passing,\r\nbe it said that the absolute temperature is that measured from the\r\nabsolute zero, which on the Centigrade scale is 273° below freezing, on\r\nthe Fahrenheit, 460.6° below freezing.\r\n\r\nThe second law referred to follows directly from the principle of the\r\npermanence of mass. It is a general observation in physics that a given\r\nportion of matter is of constant mass, however its pressure, volume,\r\ntemperature and other conditions may vary. In particular, the mass of a\r\ngiven portion of matter always equals the product of its mean density\r\nand volume, since density is defined as the amount of mass in the unit\r\nvolume. Expressing this physical law, or relation algebraically, gives\r\nρ_V_ = mass = ρ_o_, _Vo_, in which ρ, _V_, are the general symbols\r\nfor the density and volume of the given portion of matter under any\r\ncondition, while ρ_o_, _Vo_, are the specific values of ρ and _V_\r\nobserved for some one state and circumstance of the substance in\r\nquestion. In particular, if the mass of air be unity, we may write:\r\n\r\n                             ρ_V_ = 1     (2)\r\n\r\nThis relation, together with that expressed in equation (1), will\r\nenable us to deduce many of the properties of dry air and of a dry\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nFirst let us observe from equation (1) the effect, in turn, of keeping\r\nconstant one of the quantities _P_, _V_, _T_, while the other two vary.\r\nThe equation shows that if the temperature of a gas is kept constant\r\nthe volume is inversely proportional to the temperature. This is called\r\nthe law of Boyle and Mariotte from its two independent discoverers,\r\nof whom Boyle seems to have been the first. As an example of Boyle’s\r\nlaw, if any empty glass, or diving bell, be inverted over water,\r\nthen submerged deeper and deeper, the air within it will shrink with\r\nincrease of pressure, its volume becoming one half when the pressure is\r\ndoubled, one third when the pressure is trebled, etc. In particular, if\r\nthe pressure changes by one unit, the corresponding change of volume\r\nis 1/_P_ part of that volume. For example, if a captive balloon is\r\nanchored in air at constant temperature, while the barometric pressure\r\nchanges from 30.0 inches to 30.1 inches, the volume of the balloon\r\nwill contract 1/300 part of itself.\r\n\r\nAgain equation (1) shows that if the pressure of a gas is kept\r\nconstant, the volume is proportional to the absolute temperature. This\r\nis the law of Charles and Gay Lussac, so called from its discoverers,\r\nof whom Charles is thought to have been the first. As an example of\r\nthis law, if a captive thin rubber balloon is heated, or cooled, its\r\nvolume will vary directly as its absolute temperature. In particular,\r\nif the temperature is changed one degree, the volume changes 1/_T_\r\npart of itself. For example, if the temperature of a balloon in air of\r\nconstant barometric pressure is heated from 300° C. to 301° C., its\r\nvolume will expand 1/300 part of itself. Historically, be it said, this\r\nlaw of Charles and the law of Boyle were discovered separately, then\r\ncombined, giving equation (1).\r\n\r\nStill a third, though not independent relation may be read from\r\nequation (1), thus: when the volume of a gas is kept constant, the\r\npressure is proportional to the absolute temperature. In particular, if\r\nthe temperature is changed one degree, the pressure varies accordingly\r\nby 1/_T_ part of itself. For example, if an air tank or gas tank, in a\r\nroom at 500° F., changes one degree in temperature, its pressure will\r\nchange 1/500 part.\r\n\r\nWith minute detail these three conclusions from the general equation\r\n(1) have been set forth and illustrated, because of their practical\r\nimportance. Other valuable results may be obtained by similar\r\nreasoning. Thus equation (2) may be read; the volume of a unit mass of\r\nany substance is the reciprocal of its density. Hence, if in the three\r\nforegoing conclusions, the reciprocal of the density is everywhere\r\nwritten for the volume, three new relations will be obtained which\r\nare of frequent practical use. Two of them may be expressed in the\r\nfollowing important law; the density of a gas varies directly as its\r\npressure and inversely as its temperature. Useful applications of this\r\nlaw in aëronautics suggest themselves at once.\r\n\r\nBy means of the various foregoing equations, the value of either one\r\nof the four quantities _P_, _V_, _T_, ρ, representing respectively\r\nthe pressure, volume, absolute temperature, and the density, may be\r\nobtained in terms of any two of the others. If then any two of the\r\nquantities is observed, the others can be at once computed. If, for\r\nexample, the pressure and temperature of dry air be observed at any\r\npoint, its density can be computed from the formulæ, also its volume\r\nper kilogram weight, and thence its volume for any other weight. It is\r\nimportant therefore to be able to measure satisfactorily at least two\r\nof the four quantities. In usual studies of the atmosphere the pressure\r\nand temperature are observed directly. The method and instruments\r\nemployed for that purpose are too well known to require description\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn some speculations the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere\r\nare assumed, and certain interesting conclusions drawn. For instance,\r\nif the temperature is assumed constant throughout a dry atmosphere,\r\nthe fluid will obey Boyle’s law, and it can be easily shown that the\r\nheight of such a medium is the same whether it comprise much gas or\r\nlittle.[58] Again assuming the temperature and pressure constant, the\r\nheight of the normal homogeneous atmosphere can be computed by dividing\r\nthe pressure per square unit by its weight per cubic unit. In this way\r\nthe height of the normal homogeneous atmosphere has been found to be\r\nabout five miles. But these are hypothetical cases, of purely theoretic\r\ninterest. In practice the temperature may, on the average, be assumed\r\nto decrease 6° C. for each kilometer of ascent, and the pressures may\r\nthen be computed for various elevations by use of Boyle’s law, as done\r\nfor Table I.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to a study of the gaseous properties of moist air. By\r\nmoist air is meant a mixture of dry air and aqueous vapor in the form\r\nof an invisible elastic gas. The definition does not comprise air\r\ncontaining visible steam, or mist, or cloud, but clear moist air such\r\nas one ordinarily breathes. The study of this mixture may be preceded\r\nby a brief account of the gaseous properties of the vapor alone.\r\n\r\nIf water in sufficiently small quantity be introduced in a vacuum\r\nbottle at any ordinary temperature, it will promptly evaporate,\r\nforming an invisible gas known as aqueous vapor, filling the bottle\r\nand exerting a uniform pressure on its walls, except for the minute\r\ndifference at top and bottom due to gravity. The vapor weighs 0.622 as\r\nmuch as dry air having the same volume, temperature and pressure, or\r\nquite accurately ⅝ as much. It obeys all the laws given above for\r\nordinary gases and dry air. But it has one singularity; at ordinary\r\natmospheric temperatures, it cannot be indefinitely compressed\r\nwithout condensing to a liquid. In this respect it differs from the\r\nchief components of the atmosphere, which at ordinary temperatures\r\ncan endure indefinite pressure without liquefaction. The ammonia and\r\ncarbon dioxide in the air can, it is true, be condensed by pressure at\r\ntheir usual temperatures, but not by such pressures as occur in the\r\nfree atmosphere, thus still leaving aqueous vapor the one singular\r\nconstituent.\r\n\r\nReverting to the behavior of the water in the assumed vacuum\r\nbottle at fixed temperature, it may be observed that the pressure\r\nof the invisible vapor is directly proportional to the amount of\r\nliquid evaporated. In other words, for any fixed temperature the\r\nvapor pressure is directly proportional to its density. When this\r\ndensity reaches a certain definite amount, dependent solely upon the\r\ntemperature, no further evaporation will occur, unless some of the\r\nvapor condenses. The pressure of saturation for that temperature has\r\nbeen reached, and any attempt to increase the pressure, by diminishing\r\nthe volume of the vapor, will cause liquefaction at constant\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the space is not saturated, the mass of vapor present may\r\nbe expressed as a percentage of the amount required for saturation at\r\nthat temperature. This percentage is called the relative humidity. Thus\r\nif the relative humidity is seventy per cent, the actual mass of water\r\nvapor present at the observed temperature is seventy per cent of the\r\nmaximum that can exist in the given space, at the given temperature. In\r\nother words, the relative humidity is the ratio of the actual to the\r\npossible humidity at a given temperature.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, for any given vapor pressure there is a definite\r\nsaturation temperature, known as the dew-point. If with constant\r\npressure the vapor is given various temperatures higher than the\r\ndew-point, it will remain gaseous and invisible; but if it falls in\r\ntemperature to the dew-point, liquefaction occurs, and drops of water\r\nappear on the inner wall of the vessel. Further cooling will entail\r\nstill further liquefaction and reduction of pressure; for the lower\r\nthe temperature the less the possible mass and pressure of saturation.\r\nBut for all temperatures, down to freezing and considerably below,\r\nsome vapor exists, and obeys the same laws as at higher temperatures.\r\nWhen, however, saturation occurs below freezing, the vapor may be\r\nprecipitated as snow instead of water. This is a familiar phenomenon\r\nin the free atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe actual mass of water vapor present in a cubic unit of space\r\nis sometimes called the absolute humidity. A formula giving the\r\nabsolute humidity _f_, in kilograms per cubic meter, for any observed\r\ntemperature _t_, and vapor pressure _e_, may be written as follows:\r\n\r\n                 _f_ = 0.00106 _e_ / (1 + 0.00367 _t_)\r\n\r\nin which _e_ is the vapor pressure in millimeters of mercury, and _t_\r\nis the common Centigrade reading. As an illustration of the actual\r\nvalues of the pressure, temperature and density of saturated water\r\nvapor, for various conditions, the following table is presented:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE III\r\n\r\n    _Temperature, Pressure and Density of Aqueous Vapor, in Metric\r\n                              Measures._\r\n\r\n  -------------+--------------+-----------------\r\n  Temperature, | Pressure,    | Density Kilos.\r\n  Centigrade.  | Millimeters. | per cubic meter.\r\n  -------------+--------------+-----------------\r\n      -25      |      0.61    |     .557\r\n      -20      |      0.94    |     .892\r\n      -15      |      1.44    |    1.395\r\n      -10      |      2.15    |    2.154\r\n      - 5      |      3.16    |    3.244\r\n        0      |      4.57    |    4.835\r\n      + 5      |      6.51    |    6.761\r\n       10      |      9.14    |    9.329\r\n       15      |     12.67    |   12.712\r\n       20      |     17.36    |   17.117\r\n       25      |     23.52    |   22.795\r\n       30      |     31.51    |   30.036\r\n       35      |     41.78    |   39.183\r\n       40      |     54.87    |\r\n       45      |     71.36    |\r\n  -------------+--------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nNow by Dalton’s law, each gas or vapor in a mixture of several behaves\r\nas if it were alone. Thus if the foregoing experiment be conducted in\r\na bottle containing various gases chemically inert to water, the same\r\nmass of water will be evaporated, and exert the same uniform pressure,\r\nin addition to those exerted by the gases. Now the density of each\r\ngas or vapor present, will equal its mass divided by its volume, and\r\nthe density of the mixture will equal the total mass divided by the\r\nvolume. Furthermore, it is well known that aqueous vapor is less dense\r\nthan dry air at the same temperature and pressure. From this it is at\r\nonce evident that moist air, which is merely a mixture of dry air and\r\naqueous vapor, must be lighter than dry air at the same temperature and\r\npressure. This is true whether the two fluids compared be in closed\r\nvessels or in the free atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in all precise dealing with the free air, whether involving\r\nits buoyancy, its resistance, its energy or any other mass function,\r\nits density as affected by the humidity must be taken into account.\r\nThis can be computed from the observed pressure, temperature and\r\nrelative humidity as revealed by well known instruments, the barometer,\r\nthermometer and hygrometer. Thus from the observed temperature and\r\nrelative humidity, the mass of vapor present per cubic meter is read\r\nfrom Table III, the reader, of course, multiplying the given tabulated\r\nmass by the observed percentage of humidity. To this aqueous mass must\r\nbe added the mass of dry air present. Then the total mass per cubic\r\nmeter is the density.\r\n\r\nVarious formulæ are available for computing the density of moist\r\nair from the readings of the three instruments mentioned above.\r\nAlso, tables have been worked out giving the density without further\r\ncalculation. Moreover, the density of free air may be directly\r\nmeasured, accurately enough for most purposes, by means of a\r\ndensimeter. A simple formula for finding the density of moist air is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                        ρ = 0.465(_b − e_)/_T_\r\n\r\nin which _b_, _e_, are the pressures in millimeters mercury\r\nrespectively of the moist air and its vapor, as revealed by the\r\nbarometer and hygrometer.\r\n\r\nIn practice no great error will be made in assuming the relative\r\nhumidity to be fifty per cent. For the moisture content never exceeds\r\nfive per cent of the mass of the moist air, and hence in assuming a\r\nfifty per cent relative humidity, when there is actually a maximum\r\nor minimum humidity, the greatest possible error in estimating the\r\nmoisture content is 2.5 per cent of the mass of moist air. Now if 2.5\r\nper cent of a mass of air be assumed to be aqueous vapor when all is\r\nreally dry air, or conversely if 2.5 per cent of the whole mass be\r\nassumed as dry air when it is really aqueous vapor, an error of much\r\nless than 2.5 per cent is made in estimating the true density. No error\r\nat all would ensue if both air and vapor were of the same density; but\r\nsince one is ⅝ as heavy as the other, the possible error is ⅜ of\r\n2.5 per cent, or 0.6 per cent. This is a negligible quantity in all\r\nmechanical considerations, except where great accuracy is required.\r\n\r\nWhen any gas changes density or volume it also changes temperature,\r\nunless there be transfer of heat between it and its environment. When\r\nchange of volume occurs without such transfer of heat the expansion,\r\nor contraction, is called “adiabatic;” when it occurs at constant\r\ntemperature, the expansion is called “isothermal,” the temperature\r\nbeing kept uniform by suitable transfer of heat; when it occurs at\r\nconstant pressure it is called “isopiestic.” In either case work may\r\nbe done by the enlarging gas, if it press against a moving piston,\r\nor yielding envelope of some kind; and conversely work may be spent\r\non the gas in compressing it either isothermally, adiabatically or\r\nisopiestically.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, a balloon rises rapidly its contents will expand\r\nadiabatically, pushing the envelope out in all directions against the\r\nstatic pressure of the embracing atmosphere. Thus it will do work and\r\nrapidly cool. But if it rapidly sinks, it will contract adiabatically\r\nand grow warm, owing to the work done by the surrounding air in\r\ncompressing it. A like thing occurs when a great volume of air rises\r\nor sinks quickly in the free atmosphere. In this case the change of\r\ntemperature is about 6° C. for each kilometer change of level, so long\r\nas the air remains unsaturated. A familiar example of this effect in\r\nNature is manifested when an uprushing column of moist air chills, and\r\nprecipitates moisture, forming a cloud toward its top. Thus a lone\r\nthundercloud in a clear sky may mark the upper part of such a column,\r\nor upward vortex in the air. And contrarywise, a descending column may\r\nabsorb its visible moisture, causing it to become clear aqueous vapor,\r\nand thus vanish from view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n               GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT AND PRESSURE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly examined the composition and certain gaseous\r\nproperties of free air, both dry and moist, we may now study the\r\natmosphere as a whole. We wish particularly to know of its distribution\r\nof temperature and pressure; of its general and permanent circulation;\r\nof its great periodic currents; of its vertical movements, and its\r\nminor local winds with their pulsations of velocity and direction.\r\nFortunately much information is available, due both to governmental\r\nand private research, though this was collected more for purposes of\r\nmeteorology than of aërial locomotion. Of late, however, attention has\r\nbeen given to the aëronautic study of the atmosphere, which will, it is\r\nhoped, prove valuable to the aërial navigator.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the atmosphere are due mainly to the sun’s heat and\r\nto the rotation of the earth. The earth’s internal heat and the moon’s\r\nattraction are other minor agencies, but these may be neglected by\r\ncomparison. The earth’s rotation also would be ineffectual in modifying\r\nthe aërial movements, except for the coöperation of the sun. Without\r\nhis influence the atmosphere, always stagnant, would simply rotate with\r\nthe globe, at constant angular velocity and uniformly graded density at\r\nvarious levels. This evenness of density for any level is broken by the\r\nsolar radiation increasing the temperature and moisture, otherwise the\r\nair would remain practically at a standstill.\r\n\r\nThough the moisture by its lesser density causes some lightening of\r\nthe air at fixed temperature, this at most is hardly one per cent, as\r\nalready shown, and on the average is much less. Its effect, therefore,\r\nis equivalent to less than that caused by a rise of temperature of\r\nthree degrees. But if precipitation occurs, an enormous amount of\r\nstored sunshine, or latent heat, is liberated and applied to warming\r\nthe associated air. Thus each pound of vapor condensed may, by the\r\nrelease of its thermal store, heat more than a ton of air one degree\r\nin temperature, or more than half a ton of air two degrees, etc.\r\nThe actual number of pounds of air at constant pressure, raised one\r\ndegree Centigrade by the condensation of one pound of vapor at various\r\ntemperatures, is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                               TABLE IV\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Temperature of condensation     |    0° |   25° |   50°\r\n  Pounds of air heated one degree | 2550  | 2480  | 2407\r\n  --------------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe sun then is father of the wind. By uneven heating of the atmosphere\r\nit disturbs the uniform density gradation that would otherwise exist.\r\nThus abnormal pressures are generated which disturb the repose of the\r\naërial sea, causing the fluid to flow from regions of excessive to\r\nregions of defective pressure. Hence the study of insolation[59] and\r\ntemperature distribution is fundamental to the science of the winds.\r\n\r\nWithout detailed study, we may note the aggregate insolation received\r\nby the earth, at various latitudes, and its general effect on\r\nterrestrial temperature. The sun emits a nearly constant stream of\r\nradiation, from year to year, which plays continuously upon the earth\r\nas a whole, with an intensity which varies but slightly from month to\r\nmonth, due to the slightly varying distances of the earth from the\r\nsun. Owing to the sun’s seasonal wandering across the equator, the\r\ninsolation at any latitude varies considerably month by month, and\r\nthe polar regions receive much more light than if no such wandering\r\noccurred. The total yearly insolation for every 5° of latitude is shown\r\nin the following table from Hann, in which the unit is the amount that\r\nthe earth would receive in one day at the time of the equinox, if the\r\nsun were at its mean distance from the earth:\r\n\r\n                                TABLE V\r\n\r\n                    _Annual Amounts of Insolation_\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------+------------\r\n   Latitude. | Thermal | Difference.\r\n             | Days.   |\r\n  -----------+---------+------------\r\n       0°    |  350.3  |\r\n       5°    |  349.1  |    1.2\r\n      10°    |  345.5  |    3.6\r\n      15°    |  339.4  |    6.1\r\n      20°    |  331.2  |    8.2\r\n      25°    |  320.5  |   10.7\r\n      30°    |  307.9  |   12.6\r\n      35°    |  293.2  |   14.7\r\n      40°    |  276.8  |   16.4\r\n      45°    |  258.7  |   18.1\r\n      50°    |  239.6  |   19.1\r\n      55°    |  219.4  |   20.2\r\n      60°    |  199.2  |   20.2\r\n      65°    |  180.2  |   19.0\r\n      70°    |  166.2  |   14.0\r\n      75°    |  156.5  |    9.7\r\n      80°    |  150.2  |    6.3\r\n      85°    |  146.5  |    3.7\r\n      90°    |  145.4  |    1.1\r\n  -----------+---------+------------\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the equator receives nearly 2.5 times as much\r\nheat yearly as the poles. Since, moreover, the equator enjoys nearly\r\nconstant insolation, while the polar regions suffer great variations of\r\nheat, with the varying altitude of the sun, the equatorial atmosphere\r\nis both much hotter and more equable than the poles, and high latitudes\r\ngenerally. Thus at the equator the frost level stands constantly\r\nat 18,000 feet, while in the middle latitudes it varies greatly in\r\nheight from season to season. If, for example, a circle be drawn to\r\nrepresent the earth, and above it a line to indicate the mean altitude\r\nof the frost level in July, the frost line starting at the equator\r\nat an elevation of 18,000 feet will decline north and south, finally\r\ntouching the earth well toward the frigid zones. The levels for other\r\ntemperatures, above and below freezing, are similarly inclined downward\r\nfrom the equator to north and south. Obviously these isothermal\r\nlevels vary with the varying season, and at any fixed time differ on\r\ndifferent longitudes. On the plane of any given latitude the frost\r\nline varies much less in altitude, and so for the other isothermals.\r\nThis is particularly true at the poles and equator, and everywhere at\r\nconsiderable altitude. If one voyaged around the earth at the equator\r\nat an elevation of 5,000 feet, he should find the average temperature\r\nabout 65° F. In the temperate zone, following a line of latitude\r\nat the same height, he should have a lower temperature, but still\r\ncomparatively equable. The average annual temperature of the earth’s\r\nentire surface is about 60° F.\r\n\r\nIn practical meteorology the temperature is observed at many points\r\nsimultaneously over a wide stretch of the earth’s surface. These\r\nare then plotted on a weather chart, and through all points of like\r\ntemperature are drawn lines known as isothermals. These lines not only\r\nmap the earth’s surface into regions of equal temperature, but they\r\nalso show the direction of fall or rise of temperature, and its space\r\nrate of change. This rate is called the “temperature gradient,” and\r\nwhen estimated straight across from isothermal to isothermal, that is\r\nin the direction of liveliest change of temperature, it is the maximum\r\ngradient. Such a map is very useful in forecasting the weather. It is\r\nbut a particular instance of the more general map conceived by the\r\nphysicist, exhibiting the thermal condition of the entire atmosphere by\r\nmeans of a series of equal temperature surfaces one above the other.\r\nHere, of course, the temperature gradient at any point is the space\r\nrate of change of temperature in any direction, being zero along the\r\nisothermal surface and greatest normal to it.\r\n\r\nThe vertical temperature gradient is of particular interest, since\r\nit determines the condition of fluid equilibrium at any point in the\r\natmosphere when the level surfaces are isothermal. If, for example, a\r\nbalanced balloon or portion of air, on starting upward from any level,\r\ncools faster than the environing stagnant air, it will become more\r\ndense, and cease to ascend, in which case the atmospheric equilibrium\r\nis stable. Again, if the ascending gas or air cools more slowly than\r\nthe surrounding medium, it will become less dense, and so continue\r\nto ascend, in which case the atmospheric equilibrium at the point\r\nis unstable. Thirdly, if the rate of cooling be identical for the\r\nascending gas and its surrounding medium, the equilibrium is neutral,\r\nand the motion will be stopped by friction but unaffected by change\r\nof buoyancy, since no such change can occur. Of these three states of\r\nequilibrium, the stable is dominant above the cirrus level, while below\r\nthat level each state may be found, at various times, prevailing at\r\nrandom in all parts of the world, but more generally the stable and\r\nneutral states. When the unstable condition occurs at any locality and\r\nany level, it is usually followed ere long by a commotion or upheaval\r\nin the atmosphere, until the temperature gradient alters to the neutral\r\nor stable.\r\n\r\nMany observations have been made to determine the variation of\r\ntemperature along the verticle in various places and in different\r\nseasons. From the temperature records obtained in 722 balloon\r\nascensions near Paris, France, the mean fall of temperature per 1000\r\nfeet up to 20,000 feet was found to be 2°.4 in winter, 2°.8 in spring,\r\n2°.6 in summer, 2°.5 in autumn and 2°.6 for the year. Near Berlin 3°.1\r\nfor the year was found from 75 balloon ascensions, the rate being\r\nnearly the same for the halves of the year. Fig. 44 gives the average\r\nof 52 winter and 65 summer temperature gradients, taken at about 8 A.M.\r\nby means of sounding balloons sent up at Munich, Strassburg, Trappe and\r\nUccle. It will be noted that in both summer and winter the temperature\r\nfalls rapidly with increase of elevation, up to ten or eleven\r\nkilometers, but above twelve remains nearly constant for all altitudes.\r\nThe difference in temperature summer and winter is interesting, also in\r\nits gradual diminution with altitude. Another striking feature is the\r\ninversion of gradient shown at twelve kilometers elevation, where the\r\ntemperature ceases to diminish, and may even increase with altitude.\r\nThis region is known as the upper inversion level of the atmosphere, as\r\ndistinguished from other levels at or below three kilometers height,\r\nknown as lower inversions, where the temperature gradient is sometimes\r\nreversed, though not so illustrated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThus the atmosphere divides into three marked layers. The lower\r\nlayer, three kilometers deep, is the region of turbulence and storm,\r\nthe home of heavy rain clouds, lightning, wind gusts and irregular\r\ntemperatures. The middle layer, some seven kilometers thick, bounded\r\ntop and bottom by the upper and lower inversion levels, is a clear\r\nregion of steady-falling temperature, for the most part frigid—a region\r\nof far reaching and rapid winds, sweeping eastwardly, except near the\r\nequator, and bearing on their backs the frosty cirrus clouds. The upper\r\nlayer reaching from the cirri to the cosmic void, is always cloudless\r\nand very frigid, with temperature nearly constant, or maybe slightly\r\nincreasing with elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—SUMMER AND WINTER AVERAGE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE\r\nGRADIENTS.]\r\n\r\nA striking peculiarity of these three regions is that the lower and\r\nmiddle layers may freely intermingle with each other, but never with\r\nthe upper, or isothermal layer. Owing to its constant temperature, the\r\nupper layer floats on its neighbor like oil on water.[60] If a mass of\r\ndry air were forced up into it from below, with the natural cooling due\r\nto adiabatic expansion, such mass would be denser than the surrounding\r\nmedium, and hence would promptly sink back to its initial position.\r\nThus whatever turmoil may vex the middle or lower region, it can at\r\nmost upheave the floor of the isothermal layer, leaving inviolate the\r\ncrystal depths of the empyrean.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to the distribution of barometric pressure in\r\nthe atmosphere and the effect of its variation. In general, the\r\ndistribution is not very uniform, but it can be graphically pictured by\r\ndrawing a series of surfaces connecting all points of equal pressure.\r\nThese are called isobaric surfaces. In a stagnant uniformly heated\r\natmosphere, for example, these surfaces would lie one above the other\r\nparallel to the ocean face; but where turmoil exists, and irregular\r\ntemperature distribution, the isobaric surfaces are bent into hills\r\nand hollows of varied form. These surfaces not only map the aërial sea\r\ninto regions of equal pressure, but they also show the direction of\r\nfall or rise of pressure, and its space rate of change. This rate is\r\ncalled the “pressure gradient.” When estimated straight across from\r\nsurface to surface, that is, in the direction of the liveliest change\r\nof pressure, it is the maximum pressure gradient. Along this normal\r\ndirection the air tends to flow with an acceleration proportional to\r\nthe gradient. The velocity thus acquired by any portion of air in\r\nbeing pushed along the line of falling pressure, combined with its\r\nvelocity due to other causes, gives its true velocity. A most important\r\nconsideration, therefore, in a scientific study of the wind is the\r\npressure distribution.\r\n\r\nIn practical meteorology, observations of the barometric pressure are\r\nmade simultaneously at many points on the earth’s surface, and the\r\nreadings then plotted on a map, after “reduction to sea level.” This\r\nreduction is made by adding to each barometric reading the weight of a\r\ncolumn of air between the barometer level and the sea level, according\r\nto tables prepared for this purpose. Lines called “isobars”[61] are\r\nthen drawn, at regular intervals, through all points of like sea-level\r\npressure, the indicated change of pressure between consecutive isobars\r\non the U. S. weather map being usually one-tenth of an inch of mercury.\r\nThese exhibit at once, over the entire field of observation, the\r\nhorizontal pressure gradient reduced to sea level, and commonly called\r\nthe “barometric gradient.” In meteorology, the pressure normal to the\r\nisobar is called the gradient, and is expressed in millimeters of\r\nmercury per degree of a great circle. On the same weather chart are\r\nmapped the isothermal lines and wind directions for all the stations\r\nof the weather service. From these data and the reported moisture\r\nconditions, the meteorologist forecasts the probable weather some hours\r\nor days in advance.\r\n\r\nNo perfectly comprehensive formula can be given for the barometric\r\npressure at any place and altitude, but certain general laws may be\r\nobserved. Where, for example, the speed of the air is increased along\r\nany level of an air stream, the pressure is lessened, and conversely.\r\nThus, if the wind blows squarely against the front of an isolated\r\nhouse, the speed will be greatly checked at the center front, and\r\naccelerated at both sides and over the roof, thereby increasing the\r\napparent barometric pressure on the front, and lessening it on the\r\nsides and over the top. A similar effect may be observed when the air\r\nflows round the hull and framing of air craft.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the atmosphere over any locality is heated appreciably more\r\nthan its environment, the heated column tends to expand upward and\r\noverflow aloft in all directions toward the cooler neighborhood, thus\r\nlessening the pressure throughout the heated column, and increasing\r\nthe pressure throughout the environing atmosphere laterally. When this\r\neffect is marked the plotted isobars often form a series of closed\r\ncurves about the heated region, manifesting a pressure gradient at the\r\nlower levels in all directions toward the heated area. This grouping of\r\nthe isobars exhibits the familiar low pressure area of the weather map.\r\nOn the other hand, if any locality be cooled appreciably more than its\r\nenvironment, the cooled column sinks, so that the surrounding warmer\r\nair aloft flows in over it, thereby increasing the pressure over the\r\ncooled area, and diminishing it throughout the environment. The isobars\r\nmay then form a series of closed curves about the cooled region, with a\r\npressure gradient along the higher levels in all directions away from\r\nthe cooled area. Of course, if heat were the only agency disturbing\r\nthe earth’s barometric pressure, there should be a parallelism between\r\nthe heat and pressure gradients; but, as already noted, the speed\r\nor momentum of the aërial currents is also a substantial agency in\r\nmodifying the pressure lines.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that, while the base of a warm column of air\r\nmay, due to the overflow aloft, have less pressure than the base of\r\nthe cool environing column which receives the overflow, the high part\r\nof the column may have greater pressure than the equally high part of\r\nthe cool. For if the columns be initially of the same temperature and\r\npressure, heating one of them uplifts its levels of given pressure\r\nabove those of its neighbor. When the overflow begins, a partial\r\nequalization of pressure levels occurs, but not a complete one so long\r\nas the flow has any head.\r\n\r\nAn interesting hygrometric feature of these highs and lows may here\r\nbe observed in passing. As already explained, when a column of air\r\nascends it cools by expansion, and tends to precipitate its water\r\ncontent as cloud or rain; and conversely, when the air sinks it heats\r\nby compression, thus acquiring greater moisture capacity and tending\r\nto clarify. As a consequence, the areas of low pressure and a rising\r\natmosphere are usually marked by clouds and rainfall, while the areas\r\nof high pressure and falling atmosphere are marked by clear, or\r\nclearing weather. In the low, damp areas, then, the air feels heavy\r\nwhile it is really light; in the high and dry area the air feels light,\r\nwhile it is really dense, and most favorable to air men for carrying\r\nheavy loads in their balloons or flyers. Similarly when air flows over\r\na mountain range the ascending stream precipitates moisture, due to\r\ncooling by expansion, while the descending stream, on the other side,\r\ncomes down hot and dry, due to compression.\r\n\r\nA characteristic mechanical feature of the high and low pressure areas\r\nis the closed circulation between them, involving practically the whole\r\natmosphere below the isothermal layer. If we conceive the entire globe\r\nspotted with high and low areas, we may picture the air surging upward\r\nin the lows, flowing outward under the isothermal layer, descending in\r\nthe highs, then flowing outward along the earth’s surface toward the\r\nlows in a continuous cycle. Thus, chiefly is maintained the vast and\r\nmultifold circulation of the atmosphere over the entire world.\r\n\r\nIn general the motion is of a vortical nature, by which is meant that\r\nthe masses of air as they flow along stream suffer more or less change\r\nof orientation in space, the rotation at times being so slight as to\r\nbe undetectable, and again so marked as to excite wonder, as in the\r\nwhirlwind. Many of these atmospheric vortices, even though varying\r\nin diameter from a few yards to hundreds of miles, resemble in their\r\nbehavior the gyrating column of water in a common circular basin\r\nemptying through an orifice at its bottom. If the water is very still\r\nwhen the drain opens, the column descends with imperceptible, if any,\r\nrotation; but if the column has an initial whirl, or angular velocity,\r\nthis is magnified as the water approaches the axis of the vortex,\r\nthe tendency of the mass being to preserve its angular momentum, or\r\nfly wheel property. A like action obtains in the great atmospheric\r\nvortices, though here the motion far from the axis may seem like a\r\nstraight-blowing wind, rather than part of a vast whirl covering\r\nthousands of square miles.\r\n\r\nBut even if all the air started directly for the axis of the ascending\r\ncolumn, like still water in a basin, it would promptly acquire vortex\r\nmotion, because it flows on the surface of a rotating sphere. The\r\ndeflection so produced is evidently greatest at the poles, and for\r\nother places equals the polar value multiplied by the sine of the\r\nlatitude. The effect is similar to what occurs when a basin, rotating\r\nabout a vertical axis and carrying water with the same angular\r\nvelocity, is opened at the bottom. In this case the water at once\r\nbegins to gyrate within the basin, as the particles move toward its\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary generalities we may proceed to study the more\r\nprominent movements in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                     PERMANENT AND PERIODIC WINDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winds of the world are commonly classified as the permanent, the\r\nperiodic and the nonperiodic, according to their genesis and character.\r\nTheir chief features may be briefly outlined.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous and important aërial current on the globe is\r\nthe permanent double vortex playing between the equator and the\r\npoles. The heated air of the equatorial belt, uplifted by expansion,\r\noverflows beneath the isothermal layer toward the north and south,\r\nthereby increasing the pressure in the higher latitudes sufficiently\r\nto generate a surface inflow along the earth, and thus maintaining a\r\nperpetual closed circulation which is felt all over the globe. The\r\nmain features of this motion have been determined mathematically by\r\nFerrel,[62] and summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n  “In the preceding part of this chapter it has been shown that,\r\n  if all parts of the atmosphere had the same temperature, there\r\n  would be a complete calm over all parts of the earth’s surface.\r\n  But that, in consequence of the difference of temperature\r\n  between the equatorial and polar regions of the globe, and\r\n  the consequent temperature gradient, there arise pressure\r\n  gradients and forces which give rise to and maintain a vertical\r\n  circulation of the atmosphere, with a motion of the air of\r\n  the upper strata of the atmosphere from the equator toward\r\n  the poles, and a counter current in the lower part from the\r\n  poles toward the equator, as represented by the arrows in the\r\n  following figure, and that this of course requires a gradual\r\n  settling down of the air from the higher to the lower strata in\r\n  the middle and higher latitudes and the reverse in the lower\r\n  latitudes. It has also been shown that in case the earth had\r\n  no rotation on its axis, this would be exclusively a vertical\r\n  circulation in the planes of the meridians without any east or\r\n  west components of motion in any part; but that, in consequence\r\n  of the deflecting forces arising from the earth’s rotation, the\r\n  atmosphere at the earth’s surface has also an east component\r\n  of motion in the middle and higher latitudes, and the reverse\r\n  in the lower latitudes, and that the velocities of the east\r\n  components increase with increase of elevation, so that at\r\n  great altitudes they become very much greater than those\r\n  at the earth’s surface; while those of the west components\r\n  decrease with increase of altitude up to a certain altitude,\r\n  where they vanish and change signs and become east velocities,\r\n  now increasing with increase of altitude to the top of the\r\n  atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  “It has been further shown that the deflecting forces arising\r\n  from the east components of motion of each hemisphere from the\r\n  earth’s surface to the top of the atmosphere, in the middle\r\n  and higher latitudes and of the upper part of the atmosphere\r\n  in the lower latitudes, drives the atmosphere from the polar\r\n  regions toward the equator, while those arising from the west\r\n  components of motion in the lower part of the atmosphere in\r\n  the lower latitudes, having a contrary effect, but small in\r\n  comparison with the other on account of the weakness of these\r\n  forces near the equator, tend to drive the air a little from\r\n  the equator toward the poles. There is, therefore, a depression\r\n  of the isobaric surfaces at all altitudes in the polar\r\n  regions, especially in the southern hemisphere, a much smaller\r\n  depression in the equatorial regions, and a bulging up of the\r\n  isobaric surfaces in the vicinity of the parallel of 30° in\r\n  the lower part of the atmosphere, the maximum being nearer the\r\n  equator as the altitude increases, as represented in Fig. 45,\r\n  but at high altitudes there is a minimum of barometric pressure\r\n  at the poles and a maximum at the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.]\r\n\r\n  “In the accompanying figure the solid arrows in the interior\r\n  part represent the resultant motions of the winds (longer\r\n  arrows indicating greater velocities), in case of an earth\r\n  with a homogeneous surface over both hemispheres, in which\r\n  the motions would be symmetrical in both and the same at all\r\n  longitudes, and the equatorial and tropical calm belts would\r\n  be situated at equal distances from each pole. The dotted\r\n  arrows indicate the strong, almost eastern motion of the air\r\n  at all latitudes at some high altitude, as that of the cirrus\r\n  clouds.\r\n\r\n  “The outline of the outer part of the figure represents an\r\n  isobaric surface high up where the bulging up near the parallel\r\n  of 30° disappears and the maximum pressure at the same altitude\r\n  is transferred to the equator. For lower altitudes the isobaric\r\n  surfaces have a bulging up at the parallel of 30°, and a slight\r\n  depression at and near the equator. The arrows in this part\r\n  represent the polar and equatorial components of motion, the\r\n  former above and the latter below, except near the earth’s\r\n  surface on the polar sides of the tropical calm-belts, where\r\n  there is a polar component of motion arising from the air’s\r\n  being pressed out from under the belt of high pressure. This,\r\n  perhaps, does not extend beyond the polar circles, beyond\r\n  which there can be little motion in any direction, except from\r\n  abnormal disturbances.\r\n\r\n  “For reasons given in §103, the actual mean position of the\r\n  equatorial and tropical calm-belts are not precisely as here\r\n  represented, but are all a little displaced toward the north\r\n  pole, and the polar depression of the isobaric surfaces is\r\n  greater in the southern than in the northern hemisphere.”\r\n\r\nThe conclusions from this approximate analysis are in the main\r\nsupported by observation, except as modified by the heterogeneity\r\nof the earth’s surface. The sea-level distribution of barometric\r\npressure between the equator and poles, as found by Ross’ long series\r\nof measurements, manifests a variation of about one inch of mercury,\r\nwith maxima at about 30° of latitude, north and south, as required\r\nby Ferrel’s theory. As a further cause of the depression toward the\r\npoles, may be mentioned the greater speed of the permanent east wind\r\nwith the consequent centrifugal lift in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs to the general easterly direction of the winds at middle and\r\nhigher latitudes, that is well known from observation of the motion\r\nof clouds and of the air near the earth. At the cirrus level the\r\nvelocity in those latitudes is almost exactly eastward. But the flow\r\nin longitude, illustrated by the outer arrows in Fig. 45, has not\r\nbeen fully determined by observation. Moreover, as Ferrel himself\r\nshowed, the unequal heating of continents and oceans sets up gradients\r\nin longitude, especially in the northern hemisphere, thus adding\r\nconsiderable disturbance to the general circulation. To this agency\r\nmust be added also the latitudinal shifting of insolation, due to the\r\nannual march of the sun across the equator, entailing an oscillatory\r\nseasonal shift of the hot belt, and therefore of the twin-hemispheric\r\ncycle of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSome currents of the general and permanent circulation are sufficiently\r\nprominent to have special names, such as the _trade-winds_, the\r\n_antitrade-winds_, the _prevailing westerlies_, and, in the lower\r\nlatitudes, the _calm belts_, where the flow is exceptionally feeble.\r\nAll these currents have been known to sailors since early times, and\r\nhave been of considerable importance in marine navigation. Eventually,\r\nperhaps, they may be of like importance in aërial navigation.\r\n\r\nThe trade-winds are mild tropical surface currents of remarkably steady\r\nspeed and direction. Springing from the high-pressure belts in either\r\nhemisphere, at about latitude 30°, they blow toward the equator with\r\nincreasing westerly trend. As shown in charts 46 and 47 for midwinter\r\nand midsummer, the trade winds cover a large portion of the tropical\r\nzones in both oceans, and shift slightly in latitude with the sun.\r\nThey are separated at the heat equator by the equatorial calm belts, or\r\ndoldrums, and are bounded north and south respectively by the calms of\r\nCancer and of Capricorn. Particularly interesting are the trade-winds\r\nblowing from Spain to the West Indies, which favored Columbus on his\r\nwestward voyage, and which certain adventurous Germans have proposed\r\nusing to duplicate that memorable voyage, in air ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—NORMAL WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY FOR JANUARY\r\nAND FEBRUARY. (KÖPPEN.)]\r\n\r\nThe antitrade-winds, or counter trades, are lofty winds blowing over\r\nand contrary to the trade winds. As some doubt regarding the direction\r\nof these counter trades had existed, an expedition was sent in 1905, by\r\ntwo distinguished meteorologists, Teisserenc de Bort of France, and A.\r\nLawrence Rotch of America, to explore the atmosphere above the tropical\r\nAtlantic. Mr. Rotch has summarized their measurements and conclusions\r\nas follows:[63]\r\n\r\n  “Pilot balloons, dispatched from the island of Teneriffe and\r\n  St. Vincent, were observed with theodolites at the ends of a\r\n  base-line, and in this way the heights at which the balloons\r\n  changed direction could be ascertained. Later the balloons\r\n  were sent up from the yacht itself, which steamed after them,\r\n  measurements being made of their angular elevation. The\r\n  observations which are plotted in Fig. 46 prove conclusively\r\n  the existence of the upper counter-trade. The courses of\r\n  the balloons are represented as if projected upon the\r\n  surface of the sea and show that the northeast trade-wind\r\n  extended only to the height of 3,200 or 4,000 meters, and\r\n  then gradually turned into a southerly current which, higher\r\n  up, came from the southwest. The width of the dotted band\r\n  represents approximately the varying velocity of the trade and\r\n  counter-trade. Similar proofs of the northwest trade-wind,\r\n  south of the equator were obtained by the same expedition\r\n  during the following year, but the above suffices to show that\r\n  it would be possible for an aëronaut in the ordinary balloon\r\n  to start from the African coast, or from some of the islands\r\n  in the trade-wind region, and, after drifting towards the\r\n  southwest, to rise a few miles into the current, which would\r\n  carry the balloon north and eventually northeast back to land.\r\n  Nevertheless, it does happen in certain atmospheric situations\r\n  over the tropical north Atlantic that the winds from the\r\n  general northwesterly direction prevail up to great heights\r\n  without any evidence of the return-trade. Near the equator the\r\n  winds are easterly up to the greatest heights which have been\r\n  attained.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—NORMAL WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY FOR JULY AND\r\nAUGUST. (KÖPPEN.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—TRADE AND COUNTER TRADE-WINDS.]\r\n\r\nThe prevailing westerlies are high-latitude surface winds of the\r\npermanent circulation. In the southern hemisphere they are particularly\r\nstrong and steady owing to the comparatively unbroken stretch of\r\nocean. In the north also they are strong and persistent, but variable\r\nin direction because of disturbances by local winds due to unequal\r\nheating of tracts of land and sea. These features are well illustrated\r\nin charts 47 and 48. Of particular interest in aëronautics is the\r\nprevailing wind blowing from the United States to Europe, which has\r\nbeen considered a suitable current for transoceanic balloon voyages.[64]\r\n\r\nThe periodic winds are those whose gradient alternates annually or\r\ndaily, due to annual or daily fluctuations of temperature on sloping\r\nor on heterogeneous parts of the globe. The annually fluctuating winds\r\ndue to alternate heating and cooling of continents, or large land\r\nareas, bear the general name of monsoon. Among diurnal winds the most\r\nprominent are the land-and-sea breezes, and the mountain-and-valley\r\nbreezes. Both kinds are practically available in aëronautics; the\r\nmonsoons for long-distance travel, the diurnal winds for local use.\r\n\r\nThe general motive cause is the same for all periodic winds. When any\r\nportion of the earth’s surface is periodically more heated above its\r\nnormal temperature, or average for the year, than the neighboring\r\nregion, the resulting abnormal temperature gradient causes a periodic\r\nsurface wind tending toward the excessively heated place, and a counter\r\nwind above. That is, the cooler and heavier column of air sinking and\r\nuplifting the lighter, results in a lowering of the common center of\r\ngravity of the two columns of air, and thus furnishes the driving\r\npower of the wind. For example, an island or a peninsula may be\r\nconsiderably hotter by day and cooler by night than the surrounding\r\nwater; a continent may be much hotter in summer and much colder in\r\nwinter than the bordering ocean. Thus during the hot period a moist\r\nwind blows landward; during the cold period a dry wind blows seaward.\r\nIf the land has vast and lofty slopes the uprush of air during the hot\r\nperiod and the downrush during the cool period may be very powerful.\r\nThe currents so produced by the aggregate of local agencies, including\r\nthe deviation caused by the earth’s rotation, combine with the general\r\ncirculation of the atmosphere to form the actual wind of the place.\r\nThus the periodic current may conspire with the general circulation,\r\nor oppose it; may intensify, weaken or obliterate it; may overmaster,\r\nreverse or mask it completely.\r\n\r\nOf the various continental monsoons of the globe the most powerful\r\nspring from the annual flux and reflux of the atmosphere over the vast\r\ndeclivities and table-lands of Asia. Here the conditions are especially\r\nfavorable. As the sun approaches Cancer, the burning deserts and high\r\nplateaus, combining their force with the draft on the mountain sides,\r\ngenerate a continental uprush that sucks in all the aërial currents of\r\nthe surrounding seas, hurling them aloft to the isothermal layer whence\r\nthey radiate as the four winds of heaven; for here at this season the\r\nplanetary circulation is disrupted, obliterated or reversed, appearing\r\nmerely as a perturbation of the monsoon at its height. In India the\r\nforce is particularly effective. Along the north the Himalayas stretch\r\n1,300 miles in latitude, with an average height of 18,000 feet and\r\nwith sunburned areas on either side. North of this range are the lofty\r\nplateaus of Thibet and Cashmere, south of it the desert of Gobi and\r\nthe borders of the Indian Ocean. Over this watery tract from beyond the\r\nequatorial line, from the isles of Oceanica and from the wintry plains\r\nof Australia, the air flows in with accumulated strength, sweeping the\r\nBay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in a continuous gale bearing up the\r\nmountain slopes incredible floods of water. Over the Arabian Sea in\r\nsummer the gale is so steady and swift that no ordinary ship can force\r\na passage from Bombay to the Gulf of Aden. Above the Bay of Bengal the\r\nmoist south winds, converging between the coast and headlands, pour\r\ncloud laden up the Himalayan slopes, precipitating their whole vapor\r\nin prodigious torrents seldom seen elsewhere. Khasia at this season\r\nsustains a Noachian deluge, the rain at times falling nearly a yard\r\ndeep in one day and night.[65] Quite appropriately, therefore, the\r\nsummer monsoon over India, especially its component southwest wind from\r\nthe Arabian Sea, and southerly wind from the Bengal Bay and farther\r\neast, is called the wet monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe winter monsoon of Asia, is the reverse of the summer one, both\r\nin direction of gradient and in physical character. It is a cold\r\nflood of air pouring from the frigid table-lands and wintry depths\r\nof the desert, down the mountains and valleys in continual overflow\r\non all sides of the continent, and then far out over the sea, where\r\nit reascends to complete its long cycle. In its descent all moisture\r\nvanishes by heating, and no intensive temperature gradient occurs, as\r\nin summer, to accelerate its gently modulated tide. In India the winds\r\nfrom Cashmere and Thibet pour down the Himalayas toward the Arabian Sea\r\na clear current of air which unites with the trade-wind, increasing\r\nits force, and forming the moderate winter monsoon of that region, or\r\nas it is commonly called, from its lack of moisture, the dry monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe kinematic character, and the extent of both summer and winter\r\ncurrents, are well portrayed in charts 47 and 48 for all the south and\r\nsoutheast of Asia. Across the islands of Japan, it will be observed,\r\nthe winds blow in opposite directions summer and winter. In Siberia\r\nthe monsoon winds trend along her great rivers and valleys, generally\r\nnorthward in the winter and the reverse in the summer, combining in\r\nboth seasons with the prevailing westerlies, due to the rotation of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAll the other continents have their monsoons, though less powerful\r\nthan those of Asia. In the great desert of Sahara, for example, there\r\nis an ascending hot current in the summer, causing a strong indraught\r\nfrom the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; but this is far less intense\r\nthan if its action were fortified by lofty slopes and table-lands. In\r\nwinter when the Sahara cools to nearly the oceanic temperature, little\r\nmonsoon effect is perceptible, and the general circulation continues\r\nunperturbed. In Australia the monsoon influence is still feebler,\r\nowing to the limited extent of the country and to the general lowness\r\nand flatness of the land. Over parts of South America, the annual\r\nebb and flow of the atmosphere is considerable, particularly along\r\nthe northeastern coast, and in the whole Amazon Valley, whose aërial\r\ncurrents in general conspire with the trade-winds, strengthening them\r\nmaterially in the southern summer, though it is less in winter when the\r\ncontinental temperature more nearly approximates that of the ocean. The\r\nmonsoons of North America have been described in some detail by Ferrel\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  “On the continent of North America we have monsoon influences\r\n  similar to those of Asia, but not nearly so strong, because\r\n  the extent of the continent, and consequently the annual range\r\n  of temperature, are not so great. They are, for the most part,\r\n  not sufficiently strong to completely overcome and reverse the\r\n  current of the general circulation of the atmosphere, and so\r\n  to produce a real monsoon, but they cause great differences\r\n  between the prevailing directions of the winter and summer\r\n  winds.\r\n\r\n  “In the summer the whole interior of the continent becomes\r\n  heated up to a temperature much above that of the oceans on the\r\n  same latitudes on each side—indeed, above that of the Gulf of\r\n  Mexico and the Pacific Ocean on its southern and southwestern\r\n  borders. The consequence is that the air over the interior of\r\n  the continent becomes more rare than over the oceans, rises\r\n  up and flows out in all directions above while the barometric\r\n  pressure is diminished, and the air from all sides, from the\r\n  Atlantic on the east to Pacific Ocean on the west, the Gulf of\r\n  Mexico on the south, and the polar sea on the north, flows in\r\n  below to supply its place. On the east the tendency to flow in\r\n  is not strong enough to counteract the general easterly motion\r\n  of the air at the earth’s surface in the middle latitudes, and\r\n  to cause a westerly current, but it simply retards the general\r\n  easterly current and gives rise to a greater prevalence of\r\n  easterly winds along the Atlantic sea-coast during the summer\r\n  season....\r\n\r\n  “In winter the thermal conditions over the continent are\r\n  reversed. The interior of the continent is now the coldest\r\n  part, and it is especially colder than the surrounding oceans\r\n  at that season. It has also very high plateaus and mountain\r\n  ranges. The air, therefore, of the lower strata, and especially\r\n  those next the earth’s surface, now tends to flow out in all\r\n  directions to the warmer oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, and\r\n  especially to run down the long slope of plateau from the\r\n  Rocky Mountains into the Mississippi Valley. The effect over\r\n  the whole of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains\r\n  is to cause the winds, which otherwise would be westerly and\r\n  southwesterly, to become generally northwesterly winds, instead\r\n  of southerly and southwesterly ones, as in summer. There is not\r\n  a complete monsoon effect, but simply a great change between\r\n  summer and winter in the prevailing directions of the winds. In\r\n  Texas, however, and farther east along the northern border of\r\n  the Gulf, the effect is somewhat that of a complete monsoon. In\r\n  New England and farther south in the Eastern States the monsoon\r\n  effect is to cause the prevailing winds to be from some point\r\n  north of west, instead of south of west as in summer.\r\n\r\n  “In summer, Central America and Mexico have a much higher\r\n  temperature than that of the adjacent tropical sea on the\r\n  southwest, and having high mountain ranges and elevated\r\n  plateaus, there is consequently a strong tendency to draw in\r\n  air from the southwest at this season, which not only entirely\r\n  counteracts the regular trade-winds of these latitudes, but\r\n  even reverses them and causes southwest winds. The effect is to\r\n  cause in midsummer a large area here, extending far westward,\r\n  of calms and irregular and light winds, mostly southwesterly\r\n  ones, and an apparent widening of the equatorial calm-belt at\r\n  this season so as to make its northern limit reach up, along\r\n  the coast, nearly to the parallel of 20°. The effect is similar\r\n  to that in the Atlantic west of the Gulf of Guinea and Liberia,\r\n  except that it here appears to be some greater, and causes\r\n  a true monsoon effect, since during the winter the regular\r\n  northeasterly trade-winds prevail, but strengthened by the\r\n  reverse thermal conditions of the winter season. On the eastern\r\n  side, and over the western end of the Gulf of Mexico, there is\r\n  a somewhat regular monsoon effect, the prevailing winds being\r\n  easterly, or blowing toward the land, during the summer, and\r\n  the reverse in winter.\r\n\r\n  “Along the west coast of North America in the middle latitudes\r\n  there is a strong monsoon influence; for the interior of the\r\n  continent becomes heated in summer to a much higher temperature\r\n  than that of the southwesterly ocean, and hence a strong\r\n  current is drawn in from this direction, at right angles to\r\n  the general trend of the coast which, combining with the\r\n  general southwesterly winds of these latitudes in the general\r\n  circulation of the atmosphere, causes the strong and steady\r\n  westerly and southwesterly winds of this region during the\r\n  summer. Farther north, up toward Alaska, the summer monsoon\r\n  effect is combined with the current caused by the deflection\r\n  of the continent as well as the general easterly current of\r\n  high latitudes, so that the winds here are generally southerly,\r\n  but still have somewhat of a monsoon character, being southerly\r\n  and southwesterly in summer and easterly and southeasterly\r\n  during the winter.\r\n\r\n  “Along the northern coast of America, as along that of Siberia,\r\n  the monsoon tendency is to draw the air from the colder land\r\n  to the warmer ocean in winter, and the reverse in summer; and\r\n  these effects, combined with the general easterly motion of\r\n  the atmosphere in these latitudes, gives rise to prevailing\r\n  southwesterly winds in winter and northwesterly ones in summer.\r\n  The winter monsoon influence, however, is small here—much\r\n  more so than in Siberia, for the ocean contains so many large\r\n  islands that it has rather a continental than an oceanic winter\r\n  temperature; and besides, it has not the influence of a warm\r\n  current—such as the continuation of a part of the Gulf Stream\r\n  along the northern coast of Europe and Asia.”\r\n\r\nSimilar to the monsoons in essential nature are the diurnal winds of\r\nseacoast and mountain side. They begin with the heating of the land\r\nin the morning, attain their maximum intensity about mid afternoon,\r\nor during the hottest of the day, and finally are reversed at night.\r\nBesides being so much briefer than monsoons, they are also in general\r\nfeebler and less extensive. They may be quite noticeable on calm\r\ndays, especially in clear weather and in hot climates; but usually\r\nthey are masked or entirely overwhelmed where other marked currents\r\noccur—currents due either to the general circulation or monsoons, or\r\nother powerful disturbing agencies.\r\n\r\nIn land-and-sea breezes, which usually extend not far inland, there is\r\na surface inflow of sea air during the forenoon and early afternoon,\r\nbalanced by an outflow of warm air above, rising from the heated soil.\r\nAfter sundown this is reversed, the chilled air from inland pouring\r\nout to sea, while overhead the warmer sea air is forced landward at a\r\nhigher level. These currents are strongest where the diurnal range of\r\ntemperature is greatest and where the local topography is of suitable\r\nconfiguration. Particularly favorable are steeply declining shores,\r\nnarrow bays and inlets, girded by mountains or lofty hills. During\r\nthe day heated air ascends such declivities with alacrity, like smoke\r\nthrough an inclined flue, while at night, when cooled by radiation\r\nand contact with the soil, it rushes torrentlike down the valleys and\r\nhillsides, passing out to sea, often in sudden squalls that embarrass,\r\nor endanger, small sailing craft. Circulatory currents like the above\r\nhave sometimes been used by aëronauts to carry them out to sea and back\r\nagain to land at a different level.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the mountain-and-valley winds may be used by the\r\nskillful aëronaut. It is well known that these flow up the courses of\r\nrivers, cañons and land slopes generally by day, but at night reverse\r\ntheir course and pour down again with considerable force. For this\r\nreason experienced hunters place their camp fires below tent in a\r\nsloping valley. The strength of the breeze depends, of course, upon\r\nthe daily range of temperature, and the steepness and expanse of the\r\nslope. Such winds are deftly used by the masters of soaring flight, the\r\ngreat robber and scavenger birds, and no doubt may be used by men in\r\nmotorless aëroplanes, to gain elevation, and journey great distances\r\nwithout expenditure of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                   CYCLONES, TORNADOES, WATERSPOUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the periodic winds so far treated, there are prominent aërial\r\nmovements having no regular course or season. These are the nonperiodic\r\nwinds which so exercise or perplex the weather forecaster and those who\r\nconfide in him. In general such winds are of a temporary character,\r\narising from an unstable condition of the air in some locality, or\r\nfrom unequal heating, either of which causes may generate, or briefly\r\nsustain, an updraught, with its attendant gyration. Owing to the\r\nwhirling character of such ascending currents, they have received\r\nvarious significant names, such as cyclone, tornado, whirlwind; the\r\nthree terms applying to vortices in decreasing order of magnitude. Each\r\nin turn may be treated briefly.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone is a temporary large gyratory wind. It may last a few hours\r\nor a few days. It may measure fifty to a hundred miles across, or it\r\nmay measure more than a thousand miles. On the weather map it is in\r\ngeneral marked by a group of closed isobars, showing a considerable\r\npressure gradient toward a small internal area where the pressure is\r\na minimum. To an observer looking about the earth’s surface and lower\r\nlevels of the atmosphere, the cyclone appears merely as an ordinary\r\nwind, accompanied perhaps by rain or snow. It is not a swiftly rotating\r\nnarrow column, or cone of air, like a tornado or whirlwind, full of\r\ngyrating dust and débris.\r\n\r\nThe motive power of a cyclone, though in general due to the buoyancy\r\nof heated air, may spring from more than one set of conditions. Notice\r\nhas already been taken of vortices due to a hot column of air at lower\r\nbarometric pressure than its lateral environment. Take another case.\r\nIf a dry atmosphere is of uniform temperature and pressure at various\r\nlevels, but has a vertical temperature gradient a little greater than\r\nthe normal cooling of an ascending gas, a portion of air started upward\r\nin any casual way becomes warmer than its lateral environment, and\r\nhence continues to rise until the unstable condition due to abnormal\r\ntemperature gradient ceases. Again, while the surface stratum is in\r\nstable equilibrium, it may happen that the second mile of air is\r\nabnormally hot, and the third mile abnormally cold, and thus a vortex\r\nmay occur in mid air, without disturbing the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the initial atmospheric condition causing the vertical\r\nuprush, the nature of the resulting circulation is in general that of\r\nthe cyclone, illustrated, in part, by the whirling vortex of water in\r\na basin. As the current ascends, an indraught occurs in all the lower\r\nregions of air, and an outflow in all directions above, sometimes\r\nat the height of a mile or two, again in all the region next to the\r\nisothermal layer. As the earth has at all places above the equator\r\na component of rotation about the vertical line, it follows that in\r\nnorthern latitudes all the air flowing toward the vortex is in a whirl\r\nopposite in motion to the hands of a watch lying face upward, and all\r\nthe outflowing air above has a like angular motion, but gradually\r\ndiminishing until it is reversed. At the lower portion of the vortex\r\nthe air whirls inward and upward with increasing velocity, while\r\nabove, it whirls outward and upward, with waning velocity, thus moving\r\nin a double-spiral path shaped like a cord wound on an hourglass. In\r\nthe constricted part, or neutral plane of the vortex, the air moves\r\nneither outward nor inward, but spirals straight upward. To match the\r\nupflow, and complete the closed circulation, there must be a downflow\r\non the exterior of the cyclone, and since the whirl is reversed\r\nin direction, this outer mass of downflowing reverse-whirling air\r\nembracing the cyclone is called the anticyclone.\r\n\r\nBetween the inner and outer vortex the air is comparatively calm and\r\nthe pressure is a maximum, with steepest gradient toward the center\r\nof the cyclone. Also the air is calm just at the axis of the vortex,\r\nwhile for some distance away its speed increases as the radius of its\r\nwhirl, so that the central mass rotates practically as a solid column,\r\nthus still further lowering the pressure near the axis. This solidly\r\nrotating central column of air is sometimes called the core of the\r\nvortex.\r\n\r\nHigh above the center of the cyclone, where perhaps the air is sucked\r\ndownward, clarified by compression, then whirled outward, the sky is\r\nusually clear, or thinly fogged, while without this central patch are\r\nheavy clouds. The obscure or clear central part is called the “eye[66]\r\nof the storm.” Through this the cirrus clouds may sometimes be seen\r\nhigh above, either stationary or radiating away, if the vortex extends\r\nso high. Sailors on the deck of a vessel passing through a cyclone have\r\noften noticed the eye of the storm overhead, perhaps ten or twelve\r\ndegrees in diameter, and with special clearness in the tropics. To the\r\nwhite, feathery cirrus clouds, scurrying away radially from the top of\r\nthe vortex, they have given the name “plumes of the storm,” or “mares’\r\ntails.” In sailing their vessel through the center of a cyclone, they\r\nhave observed the circulatory motion of the winds and clouds, and\r\nfrequently have found the deck covered or surrounded with cyclone\r\nsweepings, such as land and water birds, insects, butterflies, etc.,\r\nbrought into the quiet core of the vortex from the incurving winds\r\nbeyond. Further details of the motion in a cyclone vortex are given as\r\nfollows by Ferrel, §178:\r\n\r\n  “In Fig. 49 is given a graphic representation of the resultant\r\n  motions and of the barometric pressures for both the surface\r\n  of the earth and for some level high up in the atmosphere and\r\n  above the neutral plane, where the motions in the vertical\r\n  circulation are outward from the center. The solid circles\r\n  represent isobars at the earth’s surface and the solid arrows\r\n  the directions, and in some measure, by their different\r\n  lengths, the relative velocities of the wind. The heavy circle\r\n  represents the circle of greatest barometric pressure at the\r\n  earth’s surface, say 765 mm., while the pressure of the outer\r\n  border is 760 mm., and the dividing line between the cyclone\r\n  and the anticyclonic gyrations. Within this limit the pressure\r\n  diminishes to the center, and the gyrations are cyclonic, and\r\n  the direction of the resultant of motion inclines in toward the\r\n  center, but beyond that limit the gyrations are anticyclonic,\r\n  and the direction of resultant motion inclines toward the outer\r\n  border of these gyrations. The heavy dotted circle represents\r\n  the circle of maximum pressure at some high level, and is much\r\n  nearer the center than that at the earth’s surface. It is\r\n  also the dividing line between the cyclonic and anticyclonic\r\n  gyrations at that level. The dotted arrows indicate the\r\n  directions and in some measure the relative velocities, of the\r\n  wind at this level. The arrows in the cyclonic part represent\r\n  the direction of the wind as declining outward, because the\r\n  plane here considered is supposed to be above the neutral\r\n  plane, where the radial component of motion is outward, but\r\n  for any level below the neutral plane the inclination is still\r\n  inward. The arrows are shorter above in the cyclonic part and\r\n  longer in the anticyclonic part than they are at the earth’s\r\n  surface, since the cyclonic gyratory velocities decrease and\r\n  the anticyclonic increase with increase of altitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—VELOCITY DIAGRAM IN HORIZONTAL SECTION OF A\r\nCYCLONE.]\r\n\r\n  “The upper part of the figure is a representation of a vertical\r\n  section of the air, very much exaggerated in altitude, in\r\n  which the solid curved line represents a section of an isobaric\r\n  surface near the earth’s surface, say of 740 mm. barometric\r\n  pressure. The lowest part corresponds with the center of the\r\n  cyclone and the highest part with the heavy circle in the\r\n  lower part of the figure, and the steepest gradients with the\r\n  longest solid arrows, since the greater the gyratory velocities\r\n  at the earth’s surface the greater the gradients, though they\r\n  are not strictly proportional. The second dotted curved line\r\n  from the top represents a section of the isobaric surface of\r\n  high altitudes, in which the highest parts correspond with\r\n  the heavy dotted circle below, since the highest pressure at\r\n  all altitudes is very nearly where the cyclonic gyrations\r\n  vanish and change to the anti-cyclonic. The depression here\r\n  is smaller because the cyclonic area is smaller, and the\r\n  gyratory velocities less, than at the earth’s surface. The\r\n  upper dotted line belongs to an isobaric surface still higher,\r\n  where the gyrations are supposed to be all anti-cyclonic, and\r\n  here, consequently, the greatest pressure is in the center, as\r\n  indicated by the curved line.\r\n\r\n  “As the interior of the whole cyclonic system is warmer\r\n  than the exterior, and consequently the air less dense, the\r\n  distances between the isobaric surfaces are necessarily greater\r\n  in the interior than the exterior part, and so, however much\r\n  the isobaric surface at or near the earth’s surface may be\r\n  depressed by the cyclone gyration there, at a considerable\r\n  altitude, if the temperature difference is great enough, it\r\n  must become convex instead of concave.\r\n\r\n  “The track of any given particle of air in a cyclone, resulting\r\n  from the vertical and gyratory circulation, is that of a\r\n  large converging and ascending spiral in the lower part, but\r\n  of a diverging and ascending spiral in the upper strata of\r\n  the atmosphere, and the nearer the earth’s surface the more\r\n  nearly horizontal is the motion, since the vertical component\r\n  gradually decreases and vanishes at the surface.\r\n\r\n  “The whole energy of the system by which the inertia of the\r\n  air and the frictional resistance are overcome and the motions\r\n  maintained, is in the greater interior temperature and the\r\n  temperature gradients, by which the circulation is maintained.\r\n  This being kept up, the deflections and gyrations are merely\r\n  the result of the modifying influence of the earth’s rotation,\r\n  which is not a real force, since it does not give rise to\r\n  kinetic energy, but merely to changes of direction.\r\n\r\n  “It must be borne in mind that the preceding is a\r\n  representation of the motions and pressures of a cyclone\r\n  resulting from perfectly regular conditions, in an atmosphere\r\n  otherwise undisturbed, and having a uniform temperature,\r\n  except so far as it is affected by the temperature disturbance\r\n  arising from the cyclonic conditions. Accordingly results so\r\n  regular are not to be found in Nature, but generally only rough\r\n  approximations to them.\r\n\r\n  “Since the wind inclines less and less toward the center of the\r\n  cyclone below the neutral plane and declines from the center\r\n  above it, the upper currents above this plane in a cyclone are\r\n  always from a direction, in the northern hemisphere, a little\r\n  to the right of that of the lower currents, when not affected\r\n  by abnormal circumstances.”\r\n\r\nObservation of cyclones in Nature very well confirms the leading\r\nfeatures set forth on theoretical grounds. If the vortex pass centrally\r\nover an observatory there is noted first a high barometer and calm air,\r\nattended perhaps by scurrying cirrus clouds; next a rapidly falling\r\npressure and increasing wind, with dark clouds and precipitation,\r\ncommonly accompanied by thunder and lightning; then the hushing of\r\nthe storm to a dead calm, and low barometer and thinning or clearing\r\nof the clouds overhead; then a rising barometer with renewed winds in\r\nthe reverse direction, and finally subsiding winds, rising barometer\r\nand clearing weather. These phenomena are the more definitely presented\r\nif the whirl is strong while its travel along the earth is slow. But\r\nowing to their progressive easterly motions, cyclones in the north have\r\ntheir moist hot southern masses elevated, chilled and precipitated\r\non their eastern fronts and beyond, while their rear experiences the\r\nopposite action and is called the clearing side. Conversely in the\r\ntropics the westerly moving cyclones have cloudy and wet rears, because\r\nthe easterly drift on high carries the precipitating masses toward the\r\nrear. The general hygrometric appearance of a centrally passing cyclone\r\nin middle latitude is thus described by Ferrel, §207:\r\n\r\n  “In the regular progression of a cyclone in the middle\r\n  latitudes somewhat centrally over a place, the cloud and rain\r\n  area of the front part, extending far toward the east, first\r\n  passes over, occupying a half-day, or a day and more, and\r\n  then the front part of the ring of dense cloud with a heavy\r\n  shower of rainfall. After this there are indications of a\r\n  clearing up, and even the sun may break through the cloud for\r\n  an hour or two; but presently there is an apparent gathering\r\n  and thickening of the cloud and a second shower. This is at\r\n  the time of the passage of the rear side of the ring of denser\r\n  cloud. After this there is the final clearing up.”\r\n\r\nExcept for special conditions, cyclones are never stationary, but drift\r\nalong with the general march of the atmosphere, like dimpling eddies in\r\na stately flowing river. In general, therefore, their trend is westward\r\nin lower latitudes, eastward in middle and higher latitudes, with a\r\npace slow or swift according to the prevailing current. Notably also\r\nthey have a poleward trend. Thus, if the path extends from tropic to\r\ntemperate clime, it is frequently concave toward the east and sensibly\r\nparabolic in form. This is markedly true of those swift-whirling, small\r\ncyclones called hurricanes,[67] and particularly those vigorous ones\r\nblowing past the West Indies and the Philippines, and those that vex\r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nAs to the speed of travel of cyclones, that may be judged, at least for\r\nnorthern latitudes, from the accompanying table, taken from Loomis,[68]\r\nand showing the average monthly rate of progression in miles per hour,\r\nof cyclone centers over the United States, the Atlantic Ocean and\r\nEurope. In general, beyond the tropics tall cyclones travel faster than\r\nshort ones, owing to the faster drift of the higher strata.\r\n\r\n  ----------+----------+--------------+---------\r\n            |          |   Atlantic   |\r\n            |  United  | Ocean Middle | Europe.\r\n    Month.  |  States. |  Latitudes.  |\r\n  ----------+----------+--------------+---------\r\n  January   |   33.8   |    17.4      |  17.4\r\n  February  |   34.2   |    19.5      |  18.0\r\n  March     |   31.5   |    19.7      |  17.5\r\n  April     |   27.5   |    19.4      |  16.2\r\n  May       |   25.5   |    16.6      |  14.7\r\n  June      |   24.4   |    17.5      |  15.8\r\n  July      |   24.6   |    15.8      |  14.2\r\n  August    |   22.6   |    16.3      |  14.0\r\n  September |   24.7   |    17.2      |  17.3\r\n  October   |   27.6   |    18.7      |  19.0\r\n  November  |   29.9   |    20.0      |  18.6\r\n  December  |   33.4   |    18.3      |  17.9\r\n  ----------+----------+--------------+---------\r\n    Year    |   28.4   |    18.0      |  16.7\r\n  ----------+----------+--------------+---------\r\n\r\nTo find the actual speed of the wind at a place, of course, the linear\r\nvelocities of whirl and of translation must be combined; or, vice\r\nversa, if one of these be known it can be graphically subtracted from\r\nthe observed wind velocity to find the other. This combination of two\r\nwind components to find their resultant, or, vice versa, can easily be\r\ndone by laying off on paper, arrows of suitable length and direction\r\nto represent the two known velocities, placing the head of one arrow\r\nto the tail of the other, then completing the triangle, and taking its\r\nthird side to represent the required wind velocity, in magnitude and\r\ndirection. Obviously if the cyclone moves eastward, whirling oppositely\r\nto the hands of a watch, the swiftest wind is on its right side,\r\nwhich consequently is known as the dangerous side. In the northern\r\nhemisphere, therefore, the rule for dodging a great whirlwind is to run\r\nnorth, if that be practicable.\r\n\r\nStationary cyclones occur under favorable conditions. At least that\r\nname has been applied to columns of hot air streaming up from a fixed\r\nbase, more or less circular. Every island in the ocean generates such\r\na vortex on a clear, hot summer day, since its temperature far exceeds\r\nthat of the surrounding water. All day long this uprush continues\r\nwhatever be the humidity. And if the soil slopes upward steeply, the\r\nvortex is so much the stronger, particularly if the island be in a calm\r\nregion. Above such a tract the gulls and vultures, and possibly even\r\nman, might soar all day without motive power. This condition and its\r\ninteresting possibility deserve investigation.\r\n\r\nCyclones may occur at any season, but in general they are most abundant\r\nwhen the greatest temperature disturbances occur. The relative\r\nfrequency of tropical cyclones for various localities and for the\r\ntwelve months of the year is seen in the following table[69]:\r\n\r\n       _The Yearly Periods of Cyclone Frequency in Several Seas_\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------+---------+----------+----------+-------+-------\r\n              | Arabian | Bay of  | S.

It is usually but a\r\nfew yards or rods in diameter, and seldom exceeds one mile across its\r\nactive column, whereas a cyclone may cover an area of any size from\r\nfifty to one or two thousand miles in diameter. Moreover, the cyclone\r\nrequires for its inception an extensive pressure gradient marked by\r\nclosed isobars, and once generated may last several days. A tornado per\r\ncontra may spring into action where the lateral pressure is uniform,\r\nspend its force in a few moments, and leave a uniform barometric field\r\nin its wake. In shape the tornado is usually of greater height than\r\nwidth. The cyclone is far-flung laterally, but in height may not exceed\r\nthe narrow tornado, since both must terminate beneath the isothermal\r\nlayer, and commonly do not extend so high. Both vortices are caused\r\nby the ascensional force of hot air. In both the air spirals in and\r\nupward at the bottom, out and upward at the top, constantly cooling\r\nby expansion, and finally descends on the outside to complete the\r\nclosed circulation. In general the tornado is the more violent and\r\ndestructive, though limited to a brief and narrow path. More aptly,\r\nperhaps, the tornado may be called a slender hurricane of brief\r\nduration; both of them being small cyclones, or aërial vortices, of\r\nminor size and concentrated intensity. The relation of the tornado and\r\ncyclone has been defined as follows, by Professor Moore:\r\n\r\n  “The cyclone is a horizontally revolving disk of air of\r\n  probably 1,000 miles in diameter, while the tornado is a\r\n  revolving mass of air of only about 1,000 yards in diameter,\r\n  and is simply an incident of the cyclone, nearly always\r\n  occurring in its southeast quadrant. The cyclone may cause\r\n  moderate or high winds through a vast expanse of territory,\r\n  while the tornado, with a vortical motion almost unmeasurable,\r\n  always leaves a trail of destruction in an area infinitesimal\r\n  in comparison with the area covered by the cyclone.”\r\n\r\nTwo initial conditions seem essential to the genesis of a substantial\r\ntornado. In the first place, the atmosphere of its immediate locality\r\nmust have appreciable gyration. Of course, in all extra equatorial\r\nregions the air has some incipient whirl due to the earth’s rotation,\r\nand this whirl is magnified as the fluid is sucked into the vortex. But\r\nthe magnification may be slight owing to the brief lateral displacement\r\nof the air feeding the tornado. If, however, the fluid be drawn from a\r\nconsiderable distance, and have from local conditions some additional\r\nwhirl superadded to that due to the earth’s rotation, the gyratory\r\nflow in the medium near the vortical axis may be very swift. On the\r\nother hand, the additional whirl, due to local conditions, may tend\r\nto neutralize that due to the earth’s component, thereby leaving a\r\nvery feeble gyration, if any. But in general the rotation of tornadoes\r\nis observed to be in the direction of the earth’s component; to the\r\nleft north of the equator, to the right south of it. This observation\r\nis doubtless the more striking because when the accidental local spin\r\nconspires with the permanent terrestrial one, the resultant whirl\r\nis intensified, while in the opposite case it is so enfeebled as to\r\nattract scant, if any attention.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the genesis of a tornado requires unstable\r\nequilibrium in the local atmosphere. This instability, as in cyclones,\r\nmay arise from abnormal temperature gradation. Thus, if along any\r\nvertical the temperature falls more than six degrees Centigrade for one\r\nthousand meters ascent, a mass of air started upward will continue to\r\nrise, since it cools less rapidly than the environing medium. In this\r\nway there will ensue a continuous uprush of air so long as the unstable\r\nstate endures; and the action may be very vigorous if a large stratum\r\nof air is greatly heated before it disrupts into the cold upper layers.\r\nIn general, the loftier the tornado the more violent it is, just as\r\nthe taller flue generates the stronger draft with the same temperature\r\ngradient.\r\n\r\nDynamically, the tornado may be treated as a rotating pillar of air\r\nin which each mass of fluid fairly retains its angular momentum. This\r\nmeans that for any mass of the whirling air the radius of its path,\r\nmultiplied by its circular speed, remains a constant product; in\r\nother words, the velocity of whirl varies inversely as the radius.\r\nAccordingly, the circular velocity is exceedingly rapid where the\r\nradius is very small. Now, when any mass runs round a circle its\r\ncentrifugal force is known to be directly as the square of the speed of\r\nits centroid and inversely as the radius. But by the above assumption\r\nthe speed itself is inversely as the radius. Hence, the centrifugal\r\nforce varies inversely as the cube of the radius of the inflowing\r\nmass of air. This centrifugal force, acting on the inner layers of\r\nair of the rotating column, must be supported by the pressure against\r\nthem exerted by the outer layers as they pass inward. Thus there is a\r\nstrong barometric gradient from the remote still air toward the swiftly\r\nwhirling parts of the vortex.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the above argument that inside a tornado the barometric\r\npressure may be much below the normal; and it is easy to see that if\r\na barometer, starting from some point on the tornado base, be moved\r\nvertically upward it must show a declining pressure, but if moved\r\nupward and outward it may be made to show a constant pressure all the\r\nway to the upper portion of the vortex. The instrument would thus\r\ntravel along an isobaric, bell-shaped surface opening upward. On a\r\nseries, therefore, of concentric circles on the base of a tornado,\r\nwe may erect a family of coaxial bell-shaped surfaces to mark the\r\npoints of equal pressure, and thus map out the isobars of the vortex.\r\nInside these coaxial surfaces reaching to earth, others of still\r\nlower pressure may be drawn tapering downward to a rounded point and\r\nterminating at various places on the axis. In an actual tornado one of\r\nthese infinitely numerous funnel-shaped isobaric surfaces may become\r\ndistinctly outlined and visible, if the air has sufficient moisture to\r\nstart precipitation when it reaches a surface of suitably low pressure.\r\nThis quite usually occurs in Nature, the funnel sometimes reaching to\r\nearth, sometimes only part way, according to the pressure at which\r\nprecipitation begins, this pressure depending, of course, on the\r\npercentage of humidity of the uprushing air.\r\n\r\nThe form of the funnel-like cloud ere it reaches the earth is\r\ninteresting. Being an isobaric surface, it would support in static\r\nequilibrium a free particle resting on it and sharing its rotatory\r\nmotion. The lower rounded part of the funnel is parabolic, the upper\r\nouter part hyperbolic; the two together delineating the well-known\r\nRankine double vortex of hydrodynamics. Students of hydrostatics know\r\nthat when a glass of water is spun round its axis at a fixed velocity,\r\nthe dimple observed is of parabolic form, and if frozen will sustain\r\nin repose a small shot resting on its surface and whirling with it.\r\nSimilarly the lower part of the funnel is parabolic because in it the\r\nair rotates, as one solid body, while the broader part of the funnel is\r\nhyperbolic because in it the air has a speed inversely proportional to\r\nits radius of motion.\r\n\r\nIf everywhere in a tornado the circular velocity of the inflowing air\r\nwere inversely proportional to the radius, as above assumed, the speed\r\nnear the axis would be indefinitely great. This cannot be admitted.\r\nPractically, the inflow ceases when the centrifugal force of the\r\ngyrating stratum equals the pressure urging it toward the axis. Within\r\nthis stratum is a column of air rotating everywhere with constant\r\nangular velocity about the vortical axis, and thus having quite calm\r\nair at its center. Outside this solidly rotating core the air spirals\r\nradially inward and upward. Some idea of the stream lines in such\r\nspiral flow may be obtained from Fig. 50 if a rapid circular motion be\r\nadded to the inward and upward velocity represented by the arrows.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion no account of friction was taken. Near the\r\nearth’s surface this dampens the whirl and centrifugal force, so that\r\nthe air flows more directly into the vortex, while farther aloft the\r\ncentrifugal force near the axis so effectually checks the inflow as\r\nto allow the central core of air to rush up nearly unimpeded, as in\r\na walled flue, taking its draught mostly from the lower part. As a\r\nconsequence, the upward speed of the heated air in the tornado tube may\r\nbe enormous, supporting in its stream objects of considerable mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—FUNNEL-LIKE CLOUD SOMETIMES OBSERVED IN A\r\nTORNADO.]\r\n\r\nThe true horizontal speed anywhere in a tornado is compounded of the\r\nvelocities of gyration and of translation, as in the cyclone. Hence the\r\nadvancing side may be considerably the swifter and more destructive,\r\nparticularly more destructive since the impact of air increases as\r\nthe square of the velocity. If the vortex were stationary it would\r\nbe equally dangerous on all sides, standing erect and symmetrical;\r\nbut it drifts with the whole mass of air, sometimes quite swiftly and\r\noften with varying speed of travel at different levels; thus, in its\r\nslenderest forms, appearing bent and not infrequently twisted, as\r\nit advances writhing serpentlike through the sky. Furthermore, the\r\nintensity of whirl may fluctuate momentarily, with consequent shifting\r\nof the isobaric surface, including that one whose form is visible\r\nby reason of incipient condensation; and thus the funnel-like misty\r\ntongue appears to dart earthward as a foggy downshoot from the cloud\r\nabove, whereas its parts are really rushing upward at all times very\r\nswiftly, whether visible or not. This agile protrusion of the nimbus,\r\nnow a tongue, now a dark and mighty tower, is the strenuous part of\r\nthe storm, the abominated “twister” which the Kansan farmer sedulously\r\nshuns, or peeps at from a hole in the ground. Unwelcome, indeed, are\r\nits visitations, when, with mickle and multitudinous roar, it claps\r\nhis house in sudden darkness, hurls it aloft and sows its sacred relics\r\nover all the adjoining township, “that with the hurly-burly hell itself\r\nawakes.”\r\n\r\nTheory, as well as experience, accredits the tornado with vast energy\r\nand power. For, suppose a surface stratum of air one mile in area\r\nand one thousand feet thick to increase in absolute temperature one\r\nper cent, thus uplifting the superincumbent atmosphere ten feet. The\r\ntotal energy stored in this way equals the weight lifted multiplied by\r\nits upward displacement. The weight is a ton per square foot and the\r\ndisplacement is ten feet; hence the stored energy is ten-foot tons per\r\nsquare foot of the heated tract, or about 280,000,000 foot tons for\r\nthe square mile of heated air. This is equivalent to the work of one\r\nmillion horses for over a quarter of an hour. A goodly percentage of\r\nthis stored work may be converted into kinetic energy in the active\r\npart of the dry tornado. It is the energy of a vast reservoir suddenly\r\ngushing through a tall penstock. It is a colossal upward cataract, an\r\naërial Niagara, a Johnstown flood suddenly liberated and quickly spent.\r\n\r\nA vortex of that description possesses enormous devastating power, for\r\nit is endowed with four destructive elements: rapid onset for razing,\r\nviolent spin for distorting, swift uprush for lifting, low pressure for\r\ndisrupting. These four grim powers may operate at once and in accord.\r\nWhen, for example, they assault a house, the horizontal blasts push and\r\nwrench it on the foundation, the cellar air suddenly expanding puffs it\r\naloft, the internal air bursts its walls or windows, the uprush carries\r\nits members on high and scatters them wantonly to the four winds.\r\nThese powers are abundantly attested by authentic reports from many\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nWhen the tornado appears as a misty column it is familiarly called\r\na “waterspout,” particularly if it appears over a sea or lake. As\r\nalready explained, the visible and cloudy portion of the column is\r\ndue to condensation of the aqueous vapor in the air, as it rushes\r\nexpanding and cooling into the low pressure part of the vortex. From\r\nthe lashed and rippling sea surface, where it upcones into the base of\r\nthe spout, some water is carried aloft as spray mingling with the mist\r\nof the chilled vapor, but not necessarily in very large proportion,\r\nand never rising in solid body to the cloud, as popularly supposed. On\r\nthe contrary, waterspouts, however massive and formidable looking, are\r\nvery tenuous, and may occur on land or water indifferently. Doubtless\r\nthey are better defined, more regular and more familiar over water,\r\nand hence their name; but essentially they are vapor spouts, though\r\nmingled at times with dust or spray. Owing to rapid precipitation of\r\nthe uprushing aqueous vapor, there may be heavy rainfall on all sides\r\nof the waterspout, so that at sea it may be difficult for the observer\r\nto ascertain how much of the downpour is salt water and how much is\r\nfresh. On land the downpour is sometimes mingled with débris, and even\r\nwith live fish and frogs caught up from neighboring bodies Of water.\r\nCopious hail also may fall with the rain, if the vortex be a lofty one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—VERTICAL SECTION OF THE ST. LOUIS, MO., TORNADO\r\nOF MAY 27, 1896, SHOWING THE VORTEX TUBES IN A THEORETICAL, TRUNCATED,\r\nDUMBBELL-SHAPED VORTEX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—HORIZONTAL SECTION OF ST. LOUIS TORNADO OF MAY\r\n27, 1896.]\r\n\r\nThe following description and analysis of a representative spout is due\r\nto Professor Bigelow of the U. S. Weather Bureau:[70]\r\n\r\n  “The tornado may be illustrated by the St. Louis storm of May\r\n  27, 1896. It is a truncated dumbbell vortex out off at the\r\n  ground on the plane where the inflowing angle is about 30°.\r\n  This vortex is much smaller than the hurricane, although of\r\n  the same type. It is about 1,200 meters high and about 2,000\r\n  meters in diameter on the surface. The vortex tubes are shown\r\n  in Figs. 51 and 52. In these figures can be seen the vortex\r\n  tubes, geometrically spaced, through each of which the same\r\n  amount of air rises. The rotating velocity is greatest about\r\n  300 meters above the ground, but the dimensions are such as to\r\n  produce enormous velocities in the lower levels. The radius in\r\n  the outer tube is taken to be 960 meters, and the inner tube\r\n  55 meters. The radial inward velocity on the outer tube is—8\r\n  meters per second; on the outer tube the tangential velocity\r\n  is 13 meters per second, and on the inner 224 meters per\r\n  second; on the outer tube the vertical velocity is 0.27, and\r\n  on the inner tube it is 80 meters per second. On the outer\r\n  tube the total velocity is 15 meters per second, and on the\r\n  inner tube 270 meters per second. The volume of air ascending\r\n  in each tube is 774,500 cubic meters per second. On account\r\n  of the distortion of the theoretical vortex, due to the\r\n  cutting of the lower portion by the truncated plane, and to the\r\n  progressive motion of the whole system that constitutes the\r\n  tornado, there is difficulty in computing the pressure to fit\r\n  these observed velocities and radii.\r\n\r\n  “Tornadoes occur in the southern and southeastern quadrants of\r\n  areas of low pressure, along the borders of the cold and the\r\n  warm masses which entered into the structure of the cyclone.\r\n  When a cold mass is superposed upon a warm mass, as was the\r\n  case at St. Louis, a tornado will occur if the difference in\r\n  specific gravity be sufficient to inaugurate a violent mixing,\r\n  and the rotation be about a vertical axis, instead of about a\r\n  horizontal axis, as in the case of thunderstorms.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—VERTICAL SECTION OF SHORT TORNADO.]\r\n\r\nThe size and form of waterspouts alter greatly with the state of the\r\natmosphere. As Ferrel observes, they may vary “from that of a cloud\r\nbrought down over a large area of the earth’s surface in a tornado\r\nwhere the air is nearly saturated with vapor and the general base of\r\nthe clouds very low, somewhat as represented in Fig. 53, to that which\r\noccurs when the air is very dry, and when the tornadic action is barely\r\nable to bring the cloud down from a great height into a slender spout\r\nof small diameter, somewhat as represented in Fig. 54. Horner says that\r\ntheir diameters range from 2 to 200 feet, and their heights from 30\r\nto 1,500 feet. Dr. Reye states that their diameters on land, at base,\r\nare sometimes more than 1,000 feet. Oersted puts the usual height of\r\nwaterspouts from 1,500 feet to 2,000 feet, but states that in some rare\r\ncases they cannot be much less than 5,000 or 6,000 feet. On the 14th of\r\nAugust, 1847, Professor Loomis observed a waterspout on Lake Erie, the\r\nheight of which, by a rough estimate, was a half mile, and the diameter\r\nabout 10 rods at the base and 20 rods above.\r\n\r\n“Judge Williams, in speaking of the tornado of Lee’s Summit, where he\r\nsaw it, says: ‘It seemed to be about the size of a man’s body where it\r\ntouched the clouds above, and then tapered down to the size of a mere\r\nrod.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—VERTICAL SECTION OF A TALL TORNADO.]\r\n\r\nWhen the tornado vortex is so tall and strong as to carry raindrops up\r\nto freezing strata it is commonly known as a hailstorm. The congealing\r\noccurs usually in those isobaric surfaces which dip down in the center\r\nof the vortex, but reach only part way to the earth. As indicated\r\nin Fig. 55, the clear aqueous vapor near the earth is condensed to\r\ncloud on crossing an isobaric surface of sufficiently low pressure\r\nand temperature; then it proceeds as mingled cloud and rain till it\r\ncrosses the freezing isobar into the region of snow and hail formation;\r\nthence finally curves outwardly to stiller air and descends as a cloud\r\nof mingled vapor, rain and frozen parts. Of this frozen shower one\r\npart may come to earth as hail or rain, the snow and sleet melting on\r\nthe way; while another part may be redrawn into the swift uprush, and\r\ncarried aloft till its frozen drops, or pellets, have grown so large by\r\naccretion as to plunge to earth by sheer bulk, even though they must\r\ntraverse a furious ascending wind. A good illustration from Nature of\r\nthis cycle in the center of a hailstorm is presented in the following\r\nby Mr. John Wise, America’s adventurous pioneer balloonist:\r\n\r\n  “This storm originated over the town of Carlisle, Pa., on\r\n  the 17th of June, 1843. I entered it just as it was forming.\r\n  The nucleus cloud was just spreading out as I entered the\r\n  vortex unsuspectingly. I was hurled into it so quickly that I\r\n  had no opportunity of viewing the surroundings outside, and\r\n  must therefore confine this relation to its internal action.\r\n  On entering it the motions of the air swung the balloon to\r\n  and fro and around in a circle, and a dismal, howling noise\r\n  accompanied the unpleasant and sickening motion, and in a\r\n  few minutes thereafter was heard the falling of heavy rain\r\n  below, resembling in sound a cataract. The color of the cloud\r\n  internally was of a milky hue, somewhat like a dense body\r\n  of steam in the open air, and the cold was so sharp that my\r\n  beard became bushy with hoar frost. As there were no electric\r\n  explosions in this storm during my incarceration, it might\r\n  have been borne comfortably enough but for the seasickness\r\n  occasioned by the agitated air-storm. Still, I could hear\r\n  and see, and even smell, everything close by and around.\r\n  Little pellets of snow (with an icy nucleus when broken) were\r\n  pattering profusely around me in promiscuous and confused\r\n  disorder, and slight blasts of wind seemed occasionally to\r\n  penetrate this cloud laterally, notwithstanding there was an\r\n  upmoving column of wind all the while. This upmoving stream\r\n  would carry the balloon up to a point in the upper clouds,\r\n  where its force was expended by the outspreading of its\r\n  vapor, whence the balloon would be thrown outward, fall down\r\n  some distance, then be drawn into the vortex, again be carried\r\n  upward to perform the same revolution, until I had gone through\r\n  the cold furnace seven or eight times; and all this time the\r\n  smell of sulphur, or what is now termed ozone, was perceptible,\r\n  and I was sweating profusely from some cause unknown to me,\r\n  unless it was from undue excitement. The last time of descent\r\n  in this cloud brought the balloon through its base, where,\r\n  instead of pellets of snow, there was encountered a drenching\r\n  rain, with which I came into a clear field, and the storm\r\n  passed on.”\r\n\r\nAs might be expected the hailstones vary much in form, size and\r\nquantity. If by chance any stones become slightly flattened they ride\r\nlevel in the ascending current, and hence by aggelation grow most\r\nrapidly on the periphery which is a line of diminished pressure. At\r\ntimes they are more or less oval, and again they appear as fragments of\r\nconsiderable masses of ice, broken perhaps by collision in the violent\r\nparts of the tornado tube. Their great variety in shape and bulk may be\r\nappreciated from the following extracts taken from the records of the\r\nSignal Service:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—VERTICAL SECTION OF A HAIL TORNADO.]\r\n\r\nIn _Professional Paper of the Signal Service No. 4_, describing the\r\ntornadoes of May 29th and 30th, 1879, in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri,\r\nand Iowa, this passage occurs relative to a tornado at Delphos, Mo.:\r\n\r\n  “On the farm of Mr. Peter Bock, in the adjoining township of\r\n  Fountain, about 4 miles W. of the storm’s centre, and during\r\n  the hailstorm that preceded the tornado, masses of ice fell as\r\n  large as a man’s head, breaking in pieces as they struck the\r\n  earth. One measured 13 inches in circumference, another 15, and\r\n  a hole made by one that fell near the place of Mr. J. H. Kams\r\n  measured 7 inches across one way and 8 the other. This immense\r\n  fragment of aërial ice broke into small pieces, so that its\r\n  exact size could not be determined.”\r\n\r\nThe following description is given of the tornado that visited Lincoln\r\nCounty, Neb., at that time:\r\n\r\n“At first the hailstones were about the size of marbles, but they\r\nrapidly increased in diameter until they were as large as hens’ eggs\r\nand very uniform in shape. After the precipitation had continued about\r\nfifteen minutes, the wind ceased and the small hail nearly stopped,\r\nwhen there commenced to fall perpendicularly large bodies of frozen\r\nsnow and ice, some round and smooth and as large as a pint bowl, others\r\ninclined to be flat, with scalloped edges, and others resembled rough\r\nsea-shells. One of the latter, after being exposed an hour to the sun,\r\nmeasured fourteen inches in circumference.”\r\n\r\nThe following was reported by the Signal Service observer at Fort\r\nElliott, Tex., 1888:\r\n\r\n  “A thunder-storm began at 4.10 P.M. and ended at 7.40 P.M.,\r\n  moving from southwest to northwest. Hail began at 5.18 P.M.\r\n  and ended at 5.26 P.M., the hailstones being spheroidal in\r\n  shape and about two inches in diameter; formation, solid snow.\r\n  The ‘break’ (hills) at the foot of the plains several miles\r\n  northwest of station were absolutely white with hailstones for\r\n  three hours after the storm. This was observed by everybody\r\n  at the station; on the morning of the 26th I walked down to\r\n  the Sweetwater Creek, three fourths of a mile distant, and saw\r\n  great banks of hailstones which had been washed down during the\r\n  night. The bottoms along the Sweetwater were literally covered\r\n  with banks of hailstones from six to eight feet in depth. It\r\n  was estimated that there was enough hail to cover ten acres to\r\n  a depth of six feet. The hailstones killed five horses which\r\n  were out on the prairie on a ranch six miles north of station.\r\n  The Sweetwater Creek was higher than ever known before, the\r\n  freshet destroying nearly the entire post garden. The high\r\n  water is supposed to have been caused by a ‘cloud-burst’ at\r\n  or near the foot of the plains, where the Sweetwater has its\r\n  source; there was only 0.36 inch of rainfall at the station. On\r\n  Sunday, May 27th, hailstones were collected on the banks of the\r\n  Sweetwater, which had been washed down and lay in drifts 6 feet\r\n  deep, actual measurement by the observer.”\r\n\r\nWhen, after imprisonment and long sustention in a powerful tornadic\r\nvortex, the accumulated rain or hail finally breaks through and pours\r\ndown to earth, in solid cataract, the phenomenon is commonly called\r\na cloud-burst. The foregoing example is a partial illustration.\r\nThe following is quoted from Espy, describing a cloud-burst near\r\nHollidaysburg, Penn., in which the water seems to have poured down\r\nnearly in a solid stream:\r\n\r\n  “On examining the northern side of this ridge, large masses\r\n  of gravel and rocks and trees and earth, to the number of 22,\r\n  were found lying at the base on the plain below, having been\r\n  washed down from the side of the ridge by running water. The\r\n  places from which these masses started could easily be seen\r\n  from the base, being only about 30 yards up the side. On going\r\n  to the head of these washes they were found to be nearly round\r\n  basins from 1 to 6 feet deep, without any drains leading into\r\n  them from above. The old leaves of last year’s growth, and\r\n  other light materials, were lying undisturbed above, within an\r\n  inch of the rim of these basins, which were generally cut down\r\n  nearly perpendicularly on the upper side, and washed out clean\r\n  on the lower. The greater part of these basins were nearly of\r\n  the same diameter, about 20 feet, and the trees that stood in\r\n  their places were all washed out. Those below the basin were\r\n  generally standing, and showed by the leaves and grass drifted\r\n  on their upper side how high the water was in running down the\r\n  side of the ridge; on some it was as high as three feet. It\r\n  probably, however, dashed up on the trees above its general\r\n  level.”\r\n\r\nDry whirlwinds of moderate size, but sometimes of considerable\r\nviolence, frequently occur in clear weather when the percentage of\r\nhumidity is small and when the vertical temperature gradient is\r\nunusually pronounced. In this case there may be strong agitation of\r\nthe air, rendered visible at the earth’s surface by light débris on\r\nland, or boiling of the water at sea; but the main body of the tube is\r\ninvisible and free from mist except high up where precipitation begins,\r\ncapped by a growing patch of white cloud in a clear sky, and which\r\nmay gradually broaden and condense sufficiently to cause a shower of\r\nrain. On land the dry whirlwind may be delineated as a tall column, by\r\nwhirling dust or sand. In this case, if the gyration is violent, the\r\ncentral core may appear clean and clear owing to the centrifugal force\r\nwhich keeps the grains out where they are balanced by the pressure of\r\nthe inrushing air. In such vortices the sand spout may appear to be\r\nhollow as in the case of waterspouts whose interior cores are free\r\nfrom cloud or condensed vapor. On the other hand, myriads of mild\r\ntransparent whirlwinds unmarked, except by down or humanly invisible\r\ndust, or dim aërial refractions, may frisk and play in the boundless\r\nsky unnoticed by the blunt eyes of men, yet constantly engaged in\r\ngenerating or marshaling the clouds and in buoying upward the ponderous\r\neagles, the vultures and the whole brood of passive flyers whom we\r\nhave not yet learned to emulate. Thus when we remember that an upward\r\ntrend of air of scarcely one yard per second, and too feeble to support\r\na falling hair, is yet sufficient to carry the condor and albatross\r\nwithout wing beat, it seems important to explore these minor vortices\r\nand to ascertain their availability and practical usefulness for human\r\nsoaring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                       THUNDERSTORMS, WIND GUSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nStill another interesting kind of aërial disturbance is the familiar\r\nheat thunderstorm. This is not synonymous with those electrified\r\ntornadoes and cyclones which are accompanied by thunder and lightning,\r\nsometimes of great violence. Most tornadoes are thunderstorms, but\r\nnot vice versa. The thunderstorm is not essentially a vortex, but\r\nrather a wind squall marked by sudden changes of temperature and\r\npressure, bearing with it massive clouds fraught with rain, or hail,\r\nand disruptive electric charges flashing frequently to earth, or\r\nfrom point to point in the sky. Its approach is usually announced by\r\nrumbling thunder and heavy black clouds along the horizon. Its duration\r\nis brief, varying from a few minutes to an hour or two. Further\r\ncharacteristics are thus expressed by Moore:\r\n\r\n  “On land, thunderstorms occur most frequently at specific hours\r\n  of the day or night, such as 3 to 5 in the afternoon or 9 to 10\r\n  in the evening and sometimes even at 2 or 3 A.M., but no such\r\n  diurnal period is observed in midocean. The phenomena usually\r\n  occur in a pretty regular order of succession. After several\r\n  hours of fair weather, with gentle winds, there comes a calm;\r\n  the cumulus clouds grow larger, the lower stratum of clouds is\r\n  seen to be moving rapidly; gusts of wind start up with clouds\r\n  of dust, rain is seen to be falling at a distance; the movement\r\n  of rain and dust shows that the wind is blowing out from this\r\n  rain cloud near the ground no matter which way the rainy region\r\n  is advancing; a few large drops fall from slight clouds and\r\n  then suddenly the heavy rain begins. Lightning that may have\r\n  occurred during the preceding few minutes becomes more frequent\r\n  and more severe as the rain increases. After the maximum\r\n  severity of rain and wind, the lightning also diminishes or\r\n  entirely ceases, and we are soon able to say that the storm has\r\n  passed by. If we watch its retreat from us in the afternoon\r\n  we shall see the rear of a great cumulus on which the sun is\r\n  shining, but through whose dark-blue curtain of cloud and rain\r\n  nothing save occasional lightning is visible. After the storm\r\n  has passed, the lower atmosphere soon becomes appreciably\r\n  cooler and drier, the sky is nearly clear of clouds, and the\r\n  wind has shifted to some other point of the compass than that\r\n  which prevailed before the storm.”\r\n\r\nThe genesis of thunderstorms is varied and manifold. In one simple\r\ntype, a large tract of heated air in the unstable state and with a high\r\npercentage of humidity swells upward at the center, the ascending moist\r\nair forming, at the precipitation altitude, a growing cloud which may\r\nbecome very broad, dark and bulky, drifting along over the earth with\r\nthe prevailing current. Eventually rain begins to form, or may be hail\r\nor snow, if the heated column reaches to a great height. The falling\r\nshower cools the air from the cloud down to the earth, increasing its\r\ndensity and materially weighting it with the descending liquid or\r\nsolid particles. The showery column then sinks, especially along its\r\ninner part where it is maturest, thus causing an outrush of cool air\r\nalong the earth, the immediate forerunner and herald of the rain. This\r\noutrushing current pushes upward the environing clear moist air, thus\r\nforming new margins of massive cumuli around the older nimbus widening\r\nwithin, showering, cooling and sinking. Thus the rain area is broadened\r\nand propagated, sometimes with nearly equal speed in all directions,\r\nbut generally fastest in the direction of the most unstable condition,\r\nor of the then prevailing drift of the atmosphere. Indeed, the forward\r\ncloud ranks may far outspeed the wind, seeming by their imperious\r\nbluster and gigantic gloom to commandeer new recruits, as if by magic,\r\nout of the clear sky. Before this solemn mustering and turbulent front\r\nof the storm the black vapors suddenly startled into visible shape,\r\nrush buoyantly upward in ragged shreds, like smoke from unseen fires,\r\nand quickly blend with the general array of compact cloud expanding\r\nacross the sky. Again, several thunderstorms, merged like a mountain\r\nrange in solid phalanx, may sweep abreast over a continent, with long\r\nhorizontal[71] roll, ever rising in front and upheaving the sultry\r\nair, thus replenishing perpetually the ponderous cumuli which form\r\nthe vanguard of this far-flung and titanic march of the clouds. Such\r\na storm is usually powerful and persistent, commonly enduring until\r\nthe sun’s decline and the shades of night have cooled the lower air,\r\nand thus allayed the commotion by enfeebling the forces that favor its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe speed of rise of the air beneath the base of the thunderhead is\r\na question of some interest in aëronautics. If the ascent be so much\r\nas a foot or two per second, one may expect the vultures to prefer\r\nsoaring beneath the thundercloud during its formative period. Here\r\nalso the aëroplanist might attempt a record flight, if the cloud were\r\nhigh enough to be out of his way. But if he ventured to penetrate the\r\nbase of the thunderhead, he might find the turmoil too irregular and\r\nstrenuous for his comfort.\r\n\r\nOf like interest is the long aërial swell that leads the advancing\r\nstorm. When will aviators make this the theater of their adventurous\r\nfrolic, careering playfully before the brow of the tempest and the\r\nharmless rage of the lightning, gay-winged heralds of the coming\r\ntumult, sailing perhaps with slackened motive power, yet swift and\r\nsecure as the storm-riding petrels at sea?\r\n\r\nBesides the winds and aërial currents commonly studied by\r\nmeteorologists, are the minor disturbances which affect more\r\nparticularly the wayfarers of the sky, whether birds or men. The\r\natmosphere quite usually is vexed with invisible turmoils; most\r\nsensible, indeed, over rough territory, but conspicuous also above\r\nthe smooth terrene, and at all elevations from earth to the highest\r\ncloudland. Before sunrise, and generally in weather uniformly overcast,\r\nthese miscellaneous and nondescript movements of the air are least\r\nactive, for any given speed of the general drift of the atmosphere;\r\nbut when the sun shines and the soil is nonuniformly heated, the\r\ndisturbances become most pronounced. A whole troop of playful zephyrs\r\nrise and set with the sun, in addition to the diurnal winds already\r\nstudied. Over the dusty plain they reveal their presence and shape\r\nin those coiling columns that constitute the safety vents of the\r\natmosphere, and obviate the disruptive violence of the uprush that\r\nwould occur should a considerable region of surface air become\r\nexcessively heated. Over the city, particularly in winter, the local\r\nturmoils of the atmospheric surf are revealed in the play of a thousand\r\nsmoky columns, and better still, when it snows, by the incessant\r\nswell and veering of the flaky flood whose surges and eddies bewilder\r\nthe vision by their complexity. Over the water the clouds of fog\r\nand steaming vapor are the best index of the local zephyrs, where,\r\nit must be remembered, the rising and veering of the vapor wreaths\r\naccompany like motions in the atmosphere. Over the forest, field and\r\nmeadow the interminable wandering of thistle down and gauzy shreds of\r\nvegetation, now fast, now slow, now high aloft, then sheer earthward,\r\nindicate what erratic and perpetual motions prevail throughout the open\r\ncountry even on the stillest days. In the deep bosom of the atmosphere,\r\nthe parallel ranks of the cirri all across the sky mark the crests\r\nof undulations quite as regular and tumultuous as the billows of a\r\nwind-swept sea; while the fierce seething and upsurging of the separate\r\ncumuli manifest the operation of vortices of prodigious energy. These\r\nvisible billows and whirlwinds suggest an infinitude of transparent\r\nones hardly less powerful, at the various levels unmarked by clouds.\r\nFor wherever two streams of abnormally graded densities neighbor each\r\nother, a readjustment may occur agitating the entire region with a host\r\nof pulsations, squalls, cataracts and fountains which the bird and\r\nnavigator must parry with proportionate care and skill.\r\n\r\nAnd it is because of the amazing resistance of these wandering zephyrs,\r\nwaves and eddies that they demand the attention of aëronauts; nay,\r\nmore, it is because of the substantial labor they can perform when\r\nadroitly encountered and duly employed. For the simplest elements of\r\naërodynamic science make clear that a rising zephyr hardly strong\r\nenough to support a falling leaf is adequate to sustain the heaviest\r\nsoaring birds and aëroplanes gliding swiftly through it. In fact, the\r\nsailors of fast air ships feel a heavy impulse and distinct shock in\r\nplowing those mild cross winds which, to the fixed observer, seem not\r\nlike blasts, but rather as gentle swells or harmless currents. These,\r\ntherefore, have been made the subject of investigation by various\r\nstudents of aëronautics.\r\n\r\nThe first incentive to the instrumental study of the fluctuations\r\nof the wind in speed and direction seems to have been the hope to\r\nfurnish a quantitative basis for various theories of soaring flight.\r\nPénaud,[72] in 1875, had explained this phenomenon by postulating\r\nan upward current. Lord Rayleigh,[73] in 1883, had made the more\r\ngeneral assumption of a wind having either a variable speed or a\r\nvariable direction as a necessary and sufficient condition for such\r\nflight. Marey,[74] in 1889, and Langley,[75] in 1893, gave elementary\r\nqualitative explanations of soaring in a horizontal wind of variable\r\nvelocity, though neither adduced concrete data to prove that the feat\r\ncould be performed in an actual wind. Each and all of those theories\r\nmay be sound enough in the abstract, but to show that they represent\r\nrealities of art or Nature they should be applied to a concrete\r\ninstance of soaring of a machine or a bird of known resistance, in a\r\nwind of known variability.\r\n\r\nTo such end the writer in 1892 devised an anemograph for recording\r\nsimultaneously the speed of the wind and its horizontal and vertical\r\ncomponents of direction, while Dr. Langley devised a very light and\r\ndelicate cup anemometer for recording the variations of wind speed in\r\na horizontal plane, but not the changes of direction. Both instruments\r\nwere set up in January, 1893, and both investigations were published\r\nwith the _Proceedings of the International Conference on Aërial\r\nNavigation_ of that year; but neither investigation was pushed far\r\nenough to prove conclusively the possibility of a particular bird\r\nor model soaring in the particular wind recorded. The two together\r\ndid, however, reveal quite astonishing fluctuations of the wind in\r\nboth speed and direction, results that have since received ample\r\nexemplification in the more extended records of other observers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—UNIVERSAL ANEMOGRAPH. (The vanes are high above\r\nthe point indicated by the break in the vertical pipe.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 56 shows the recording anemometer for speed and double direction\r\nconstructed by the writer in 1892. A large weather vane was firmly\r\nstrapped to a vertical pipe which turned freely on ball bearings and,\r\nby means of a small crank actuating a chronograph pencil, recorded its\r\nfluctuations on a long sheet of paper winding on the drum from a roll\r\nbehind. On top of the pipe and about fifteen feet from the ground,\r\nwas mounted a carefully balanced horizontal vane, from which a fine\r\nsteel wire ran down the axis of the pipe to a fixed pulley, thence\r\nto a second recording pencil. A third pencil recorded the beats of a\r\npendulum, thus standardizing the speed of the paper. A fourth pencil,\r\nnot shown, was designed to record the turns of an anemometer mounted\r\nnear the top of the pipe. The records of the wind speed thus secured\r\nare omitted for lack of standardization, as the experiments were\r\nprematurely terminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—RECORDS OF WIND VARIATION IN HORIZONTAL AND\r\nVERTICAL DIRECTION.]\r\n\r\nTypical records of the wind direction are shown in Fig. 57 in which\r\nthe circles represent the paths swept by the wind-vane cranks that\r\noperated the corresponding pencils. Both vanes, as shown by their\r\ndiagrams, veered quite frequently ten degrees in a short interval of\r\ntime, and not seldom twenty to thirty degrees. Frequently, also, it was\r\nobserved, in scanning the various records, that a rise or lull in the\r\nwind speed was accompanied by a corresponding variation in direction;\r\nbut the observations were not sufficiently numerous and extended to\r\nestablish this phenomenon as a general occurrence. But as it can be\r\nshown theoretically that a horizontal stream of air of constant cross\r\nsection and uniform velocity at each section, can not greatly fluctuate\r\nin velocity from point to point, without more pronounced changes of\r\ndensity than the barometer records, it naturally follows that the\r\nstream must broaden where the air speed lags, and narrow where it\r\naccelerates; in other words, it follows that there must be some change\r\nin direction. The records were taken in the middle of a clear open\r\nspace of two hundred acres at Notre Dame University on a sunless day in\r\nJanuary, 1893, when the temperature was 24° F., and the wind eight to\r\ntwelve miles per hour. Their application to the theory of soaring need\r\nnot be considered here.\r\n\r\nFurther studies of the wind pulsations were made by use of a toy\r\nballoon attached to a long thread. The first trials are thus recounted\r\nin the paper above cited:\r\n\r\n  “After some preliminary tests from the top of the Physical\r\n  Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University, during the Easter\r\n  vacation of 1893, I ascended the Washington Monument at\r\n  Baltimore, where I paid out the exploring line at a height\r\n  of 200 feet. The wind was blowing toward the southeast at\r\n  the speed of 25 to 35 miles per hour, and the sky, which had\r\n  remained clear till 3 o’clock, was rapidly darkening, with\r\n  indications of approaching rain. The balloon, when let forth,\r\n  immediately fell to a depth of 30 or 40 feet, being caught\r\n  in the eddy of the monument, then presently encountering\r\n  the unbiased current, sailed in it toward the southeast,\r\n  approximately level with the spool end of the thread. After\r\n  the balloon had drawn out 100 feet of thread I checked it to\r\n  observe the behavior of this much of the exploring line. The\r\n  balloon rose and fell with the tossing of the wind, but did\r\n  not flutter like a flag, as it would do if formed of irregular\r\n  outline. Neither did the thread flutter, nor do I believe there\r\n  is ever a tendency in a line greatly to flutter in a current\r\n  as does a flag or sail. Presently I paid out 300 feet of the\r\n  exploring line, whereupon the waves in the thread became quite\r\n  remarkable. The thread then, as a rule, was never approximately\r\n  straight. Sometimes it was blown into the form of a helix of\r\n  enormous pitch; at other times into the form of a wavy figure\r\n  lying nearly in a single vertical plane; and again, the entire\r\n  exploring line should veer through an angle of 40° to 60°,\r\n  either vertically or horizontally. The balloon, of course,\r\n  seldom remained quiet for more than a few seconds at a time,\r\n  but tossed about on the great billows like a ship in a storm.\r\n  Quite usually the billows could be seen running along the\r\n  line from the spool to the balloon, and, as a rule, several\r\n  different billows occupied the string at one time.\r\n\r\n  “The observations just delineated, however curious they may\r\n  be, afford no adequate conception of the behavior of the air\r\n  currents over an open plane, nor at a great height above the\r\n  earth, because the Washington Monument at Baltimore stands but\r\n  100 feet above the surrounding buildings, which undoubtedly\r\n  send disturbances to a greater height than 200 feet. To\r\n  supplement these explorations, therefore, I determined to\r\n  have them repeated from the top of the Washington Monument at\r\n  Washington and the Eiffel Tower at Paris.”\r\n\r\nSome months later in the year, the experiment was repeated at the top\r\nof the Washington Monument in Washington, at a height of five hundred\r\nfeet. The balloon, with a stone attached, was paid out from the north\r\nwindow of the monument till it reached the ground. Then the stone was\r\nremoved by an assistant who drew the balloon well away from the huge\r\neddy of the great shaft, and let it fly toward the east, drawing the\r\nthread after it like a mariner’s log in the wake of a ship. When six\r\nhundred feet of the thread had been let out, it was observed to veer in\r\nall directions under the varying surges of the wind. These variations\r\nseemed larger than could be expected from the wake of the shaft alone\r\nnear its summit, where it measures about thirty feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nSuch qualitative observations, though interesting and suggestive,\r\nare not wholly satisfactory. The same may be said of the study of\r\nair currents by aid of smoke from tall chimneys. The eddy about such\r\ncolumns may extend to a considerable height above them, and the wake\r\nis farreaching. The experiments would therefore best be made from high\r\nopen-work towers above plane country or a broad sheet of water.\r\n\r\nA better method perhaps would be to liberate a pilot balloon, or\r\ndischarge a bomb giving a bright compact cloud, and to trace its path\r\nby means of two cameras, as it floats from point to point in the\r\naërial current. The instruments, if suitably stationed, would give the\r\ncontinuous space history of the floating object; that is, its actual\r\npath and the speed at each part thereof, or, in other words, the\r\nmagnitude and direction of the velocity at each point. But, of course,\r\nthis method would not reveal the wind’s history at any given fixed\r\npoint, as recorded by the anemograph above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—RECORDS OF WIND SPEED OBTAINED BY LANGLEY.]\r\n\r\nFig. 58 is a typical wind-speed record obtained by Langley in January,\r\n1893, by means of a very light cup anemometer mounted eleven feet\r\nabove the north tower of the Smithsonian Institution, and 153 feet\r\nfrom the ground. The abscissæ represent time in minutes, the ordinates\r\nwind speed in miles per hour. The records were taken in cloudy weather\r\nand in a south-southeast wind. Other records were taken during the\r\nmonth of February, showing like deviations from the mean, though at\r\ntimes more pronounced; for Dr. Langley noted that “the higher the\r\nabsolute velocity of the wind, the greater the relative fluctuations\r\nwhich occur in it.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from this record that, when the average speed was\r\nabout twelve miles an hour, the extreme fluctuation was rarely one\r\nthird greater or less than that, and on the average varied hardly\r\none sixth. It must be further added that the air on approaching the\r\nanemometer had traversed a mile of the lower residential section of\r\nthe city, then crossed the body of the Smithsonian building, which\r\nitself is half as high as the tower. It should be expected, therefore,\r\nthat this wind was, other things equal, naturally more turbulent than\r\nif flowing in from a level plain. This surmise is justified by the\r\nmore extensive records of wind speeds shown in meteorological records\r\ntaken respectively in clear and in obstructed places. On the other\r\nhand, even in level places where no obstruction is visible for several\r\nmiles, the wind, though it may be steady at one time, can at another\r\ntime be gustier than that shown in Langley’s record, according to the\r\nstate of the weather; for the gusts are not all due to neighboring\r\nobstacles, but may be transmitted from afar, even from the depths of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAssuming the wind speed at any instant to vary by one sixth of the\r\nmean, its impactual pressure will then vary by thirty-six per cent of\r\nthe pressure of the mean wind, remembering that the pressure varies as\r\nthe square of the speed. This fluctuation of the impactual pressure\r\ntallies fairly well with that found by Professor Marvin at the top of\r\nMount Washington, in 1890, by means of a pressure plate.[76] He found\r\nthe variation to be approximately thirty-five per cent of the mean\r\npressure. Professor Hazen, however, reports but little variation in\r\nthe wind speed in the free atmosphere well above the earth. In several\r\nballoon ascensions he suspended from the basket a lead weight by means\r\nof a cord to which was looped the thread of a toy balloon. He found\r\nthat the little balloon sometimes moved ahead if the weight sometimes\r\nfollowed it, but that in general the relative motion was very feeble,\r\nthus indicating that the fluctuations of the velocity in the depth of\r\nthe atmosphere at those times were very slight.[77] However this be for\r\nsuch distances from the earth and its protuberances, the fluctuations\r\nof wind speed found at meteorological stations sufficiently resemble\r\nthose reported by Dr. Langley. As corroborative evidence, the reader\r\nmay be referred to the wind records published in the _Interim Report_\r\nfor 1909, of the British Advisory Committee for Aëronautics.\r\n\r\nWithout the material evidence of commotion in the atmosphere, a\r\nmoment’s reflection will make clear that such turmoil must exist, even\r\nover a vast, smooth plain, especially in bright weather, and more\r\nparticularly over bare ground in dry weather. For it is well known\r\nthat clear, dry air transmits radiation with very slight absorption,\r\nwhen the sun is well toward the zenith, and hence that the temperature\r\nin the depth of the atmosphere is but little changed from moment\r\nto moment, due to the passage of sunlight. At the earth’s surface,\r\nhowever, the air by contact with heating or cooling soil may change\r\ntemperature rapidly. The direct sunlight falling perpendicularly upon\r\na perfectly absorbent material transmits nearly two calories of heat\r\nper minute to each square centimeter of the receiving surface. It\r\nwould, therefore, under favorable circumstances, elevate by nearly\r\ntwo degrees C. per minute a layer of water one centimeter deep, or\r\na layer of air something over a hundred feet thick, if all the heat\r\nfalling on the assumed surface were communicated to the neighboring air\r\nstratum. In practice, a large percentage of the incident sunlight is\r\nreflected and radiated by the soil, into sidereal space without heating\r\nthe air. But every one per cent of it caught up by the air in contact\r\nwith the earth is sufficient to heat a layer roughly one foot thick\r\none degree per minute. Hence, unless the heated air streamed upward\r\ncontinually, the layer next the earth would quickly be raised to a\r\nvery abnormal temperature, which would result in a violent uprush. The\r\ngradual ascension of the surface air may take place in large or small\r\ncolumns, or in both kinds at once. In either case, the composition of\r\nthe ascensional motion with the general movement of the wind due to\r\nbarometric gradient must cause gustiness and marked irregularity of\r\nspeed and direction.\r\n\r\nVarious causes have been assigned for the gustiness of the winds.\r\nFerrel and many other writers assume that the air, especially near\r\nthe earth, is full of small vortices rotating about axes of various\r\ninclination. These whirls, on passing squarely across a weather vane,\r\ncause it to point one way for a moment, then presently the opposite\r\nway, while if they cross obliquely they cause a like sudden veering of\r\nthe vane, but less extensive.\r\n\r\nHelmholtz has proved that in the atmosphere strata of different\r\ndensities come at regular intervals to be contiguous one above\r\nthe other, and thus to beget conditions favorable to the formation\r\nof aërial waves, sometimes so large as to set the lower regions of\r\nair into violent commotion and thereby generate the so-called gusty\r\nweather. He has summarized as follows some of the important conclusions\r\nof his dynamic analysis.[78]\r\n\r\n“As soon as a lighter fluid lies above a denser one with well-defined\r\nboundary, then evidently the conditions exist at this boundary for\r\nthe origin and regular propagation of waves, such as we are familiar\r\nwith on the surface of water. This case of waves, as ordinarily\r\nobserved on the boundary surfaces between water and air, is only to be\r\ndistinguished from the system of waves that may exist between different\r\nstrata of air, in that in the former the difference of density of the\r\ntwo fluids is much greater than in the latter case. It appeared to me\r\nof interest to investigate what other differences result from this in\r\nthe phenomena of air waves and water waves.\r\n\r\n“It appears to me not doubtful that such systems of waves occur with\r\nremarkable frequency at the bounding surfaces of strata of air of\r\ndifferent densities, even although in most cases they remain invisible\r\nto us. Evidently we see them only when the lower stratum is so nearly\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapor that the summit of the wave, within which\r\nthe pressure is less, begins to form a haze. Then there appear streaky,\r\nparallel trains of clouds of very different breadths, occasionally\r\nstretching over the broad surface of the sky in regular patterns.\r\nMoreover, it seems to me probable that this, which we thus observe\r\nunder special conditions that have rather the character of exceptional\r\ncases, is present in innumerable other cases when we do not see it.\r\n\r\n“The calculations performed by me show, further, that for the observed\r\nvelocities of the wind there may be formed in the atmosphere not only\r\nsmall waves, but also those whose wave lengths are many kilometers\r\nwhich, when they approach the earth’s surface to within an altitude\r\nof one or several kilometers, set the lower strata of air into\r\nviolent motion and must bring about the so-called gusty weather. The\r\npeculiarity of such weather (as I look at it) consists in this, that\r\ngusts of wind often accompanied by rain are repeated at the same place,\r\nmany times a day, at nearly equal intervals and nearly uniform order of\r\nsuccession.”\r\n\r\nCommandant Le Clement de Saint-Marcq has drawn some interesting\r\nconclusions from the hypothesis that an ordinary wind consists of a\r\nuniform current on which is superposed periodic motions in the wind’s\r\nmain direction and also at right angles thereto. But he has not\r\nestablished his hypothesis by adequate observations. He assumes the\r\npulsations to be simple harmonic motions, which of course they would be\r\nif they were plane compressional waves; but at the same time he shows\r\nthat the fluctuations are too large to be compressional waves, with the\r\nconcurrent slight variations of the barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is still a question whether the pulsations of the natural wind be\r\nharmonic. If so, the speed records should be sine curves, and the to\r\nand fro acceleration of any mass of moving air should be variable for\r\nany given pulsation. But the few records available show in many parts a\r\nconstant acceleration of the wind speed throughout a particular swell\r\nor lull of velocity, indicating that the pulsations are not generally\r\nsimple harmonic ones.\r\n\r\nIn scanning the wind-speed records published by Langley, so many\r\ninstances of uniform wind acceleration are noticed that one naturally\r\ninquires whether the rate of gain of velocity be sufficient to sustain\r\nin soaring flight an aëroplane or bird held to the wind solely by\r\nits inertia, as Langley believed to be possible. The total forward\r\nresistance of a well-formed aërial glider, or bird, may be taken as\r\none eighth of its weight; hence, if poised stationary in its normal\r\nattitude of flight, it will just be sustained by a direct head wind\r\nhaving a horizontal acceleration of one eighth that of gravity, or\r\nfour feet per second. Now, the most favorable parts of the record here\r\nshown (Fig. 58) exhibit nowhere an acceleration so great as four feet\r\nper second, and on the average far less than that, as may be proved\r\nby sealing the diagram. Hence, the wind here recorded was wholly\r\ninadequate to support by its pulsative force either bird or man. But\r\nas this record is a fair representative of all those published by Dr.\r\nLangley, it follows that such pulsations can at best merely aid in\r\nsoaring when happily and adroitly encountered; but that they cannot\r\nfully sustain soaring at any level, much less during ascensional flight\r\nto great altitudes, or migrational flight to vast distances. It still\r\nremains, therefore, to ascertain what kind of aërial currents are\r\nadequate to sustain those marvelous feats of soaring on passive pinions\r\nwhich for ages have been the delight and wonder of all keen observers,\r\nand which are of such enduring interest to mankind. This investigation,\r\nhowever, appertains more particularly to the science of applied\r\naërodynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX I\r\n\r\n                    STRESS IN A VACUUM BALLOON[79]\r\n\r\n                            _By A. F. Zahm_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs inventors frequently propose the construction of a vacuum balloon,\r\nto secure buoyancy without the use of gas, it may be desirable to\r\nestimate the strength of material required to resist crushing, say in a\r\nspherical balloon.\r\n\r\nThe unit stress in the wall of a thin, hollow, spherical balloon\r\nsubject to uniform hydrostatic pressure, which is prevented from\r\nbuckling, is given by equating the total stress on a diametral section\r\nof the shell to the total hydrostatic pressure across a diametral\r\nsection of the sphere, thus:\r\n\r\n                           2π_rtS_ = π_pr^2_\r\n\r\nin which _S_ may be the stress in pounds per square inch, _p_ the\r\nresultant hydrostatic pressure in pounds per square inch, _r_ the\r\nradius of the sphere, _t_ the wall thickness.\r\n\r\nThe greatest allowable mass of the shell is found by equating it to the\r\nmass of the displaced air, thus:\r\n\r\n                   4π_r_^2_t_ς_{1} = 4π_r_^3ς_{2}/3\r\n\r\nin which ς_{1} is the density of the wall material, ς_{2} the density\r\nof the atmosphere outside.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming _p_ = 15, ς_{1}/ς_{2} = 6,000, for steel and air, the\r\nequations give:\r\n\r\n        _S_ = 3_p_ς_{1}/2ς_{2} = 45 × 6,000/2 = 135,000 pounds\r\n\r\nper square inch as the stress in a steel vacuum balloon.\r\n\r\nFor aluminum ς_{1} is less, but the permissible value of _S_ is also\r\nless in about the same proportion.\r\n\r\nThe last equation shows that for a given material and atmospheric\r\nenvironment, the stress in the shell or wall of the spherical balloon\r\nis independent of the radius of the surface. It is also well known\r\nthat the stress is less for the sphere than for any other surface.\r\nHence, no surface can be constructed in which _S_ will be less than\r\n3_p_ς_{1}/2ς_{2}. The argument is easily seen to apply to a partial\r\nvacuum balloon, since a balloon of one nth vacuum will float a cover of\r\nbut one nth the mass and strength.\r\n\r\nThe above result was obtained on the assumption that the shell was\r\nprevented from buckling. As a matter of fact, it would buckle long\r\nbefore the crushing stress could be attained. We must conclude,\r\ntherefore, that while a vacuum balloon has alluring features, the\r\nmaterials of engineering are not strong enough to favor such a\r\nstructure. Perhaps it is nearer the truth to say that such a project is\r\nvisionary, with the materials now available.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nA like argument applies to the balloon reservoir in which it has\r\nbeen proposed to compress the surplus gas taken from a balloon hull\r\non expansion of its contents by change of level or temperature. If a\r\ngiven mass of gas obeying Boyle’s law be pumped into a receiver of\r\ngiven shape and mass, the resultant stress in the receiver wall will be\r\nindependent of the size. Hence the material of the proposed reservoir,\r\nif expanded to the size of the hull itself, will weigh the same, and\r\nsuffer the same increment of unit stress, for a given mass increment of\r\ngas. Hence, instead of pumping the above-mentioned gas surplus from the\r\nhull into the reservoir, this latter may be discarded and its mass of\r\nmaterial spread over the hull itself. This argument applies only if the\r\nshapes of hull and reservoir be equally effective, as, for example, if\r\nboth be cylindrical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX II\r\n\r\n                AËRONAUTIC LETTERS OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PASSY, Aug. 30, 1783.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 27th instant, the new aërostatic Experiment, invented\r\nby Messrs. Montgolfier of Annonay, was repeated by M. Charles,\r\nProfessor of experimental Philosophy at Paris.\r\n\r\nA hollow Globe 12 feet Diameter was formed of what is called in England\r\nOiled Silk, here Taffetas gommé, the Silk being impregnated with a\r\nSolution of Gum elastic in Linseed Oil, as he said. The Parts were\r\nsewed together while wet with the Gum, and some of it was afterwards\r\npassed over the Seam, to render it as tight as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards filled with inflammable Air that is produced by\r\npouring Oil of Vitriol upon Filings of Iron, when it was found to have\r\na tendency upwards so strong as to be capable of lifting a Weight of 39\r\nPounds, exclusive of its own Weight which was 25 lbs and the Weight of\r\nthe Air contain’d.\r\n\r\nIt was brought early in the morning to the Champ de Mars, a Field in\r\nwhich Reviews are sometimes made, lying between the military School and\r\nthe River. There it was held down by a Cord till 5 in the afternoon,\r\nwhen it was to let loose. Care was taken before the Hour to replace\r\nwhat Portion had been lost, of the inflammable Air, or of its Force, by\r\ninjecting more.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that not less than 50,000 People were assembled to see\r\nthe Experiment, The Champ de Mars being surrounded by multitudes, and\r\nvast Numbers on the opposite Side of the River.\r\n\r\nAt 5 O’clock Notice was given to the Spectators by the Firing of two\r\nCannon, that the Cord was about to be cut. And presently the Globe was\r\nseen to rise, and that as fast as a Body of 12 feet Diameter, with a\r\nforce only of 39 Pounds, could be suppos’d to remove the resisting Air\r\nout of its Way. There was some Wind, but not very strong. A little\r\nRain had wet it, so that it shone, and made an agreeable appearance.\r\nIt diminished in Apparent Magnitude as it rose, till it enter’d the\r\nClouds, when it seem’d to me scarce bigger than an Orange, and soon\r\nafter became invisible, the Clouds concealing it.\r\n\r\nThe multitude separated, all well satisfied and delighted with the\r\nSuccess of the Experiment, and amusing one another with discourses of\r\nthe various uses it may possibly be apply’d to, among which many were\r\nvery extravagant. But possibly it may pave the Way to some Discoveries\r\nin Natural Philosophy of which at present we have no conception.\r\n\r\nA Note secur’d from the Weather had been affix’d to the Globe,\r\nsignifying the Time & Place of its Departure, and praying those who\r\nmight happen to find it, to send an account of its state to certain\r\nPersons at Paris. No News was learned of it till the next Day, when\r\ninformation was received that it fell a little after 6 o’clock, at\r\nGonesse, a Place about four Leagues Distance, and that it was rent\r\nopen, and some say had ice in it. It is suppos’d to have burst by the\r\nElasticity of the contain’d Air when no longer compress’d by so heavy\r\nan Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOne of 38 feet Diameter is preparing by Mr. Montgolfier himself, at the\r\nExpence of the Academy, which is to go up in a few days. I am told it\r\nis constructed of Linen & Paper, and is to be filled with different\r\nAir, not yet made public, but cheaper than that produc’d by the Oil of\r\nVitriol, of which 200 Paris Pints were consum’d in filling the other.\r\n\r\nIt is said that for some Days after its being fill’d the Ball was found\r\nto lose an eighth Part of its Force of Levity in 24 Hours; Whether this\r\nwas from Imperfection in the Tightness of the Ball, or a Change in the\r\nNature of the Air, Experiments may easily discover....\r\n\r\nM. Montgolfier’s Air to fill the Globe has hitherto been kept secret;\r\nsome suppose it to be only common Air heated by passing thro’ the Flame\r\nof burning Straw, and thereby extreamly rarefied. If so, its Levity\r\nwill soon be deminish’d by Condensation, when it comes into the cooler\r\nRegion above....\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now learned that some observers say, the Ball was 150\r\nSeconds in rising, from the cutting of the Cord till hid in the Clouds;\r\nthat its height was then about 500 Toises, but, being moved out of\r\nthe Perpendicular by the Wind, it had made a Slant so as to form a\r\nTriangle, whose base on the Earth was about 200 Toises. It is said the\r\nCountry People who saw it fall were frightened, conceiv’d from its\r\nbounding a little, when it touched the Ground, that there was some\r\nliving Animal in it, and attack’d with Stones and Knives, so that it\r\nwas much mangled; but it is now brought to Town and will be repair’d.\r\n\r\nThe great one of M. Montgolfier is to go up, as is said, from\r\nVersailles, in about 8 or 10 days. It is not a Globe but of a different\r\nForm, more convenient for penetrating the Air.\r\n\r\nIt contains 50,000 cubic Feet, and is supposed to have Force of Levity\r\nequal to 1,500 pounds weight. A Philosopher here, M. Pilâtre du Rozier,\r\nhas seriously apply’d to the Academy for leave to go up with it, in\r\norder to make some experiments. He was complimented on his Zeal and\r\nCourage for the Promotion of Science, but advis’d to wait till the\r\nmanagement of these Balls was made by Experience more certain & safe.\r\nThey say the filling of it in Montgolfier’s Way will not cost more\r\nthan half a Crown. One is talk’d of to be 110 feet Diameter. Several\r\ngentlemen have ordered small ones to be made for their Amusement.\r\nOne has ordered four of 15 feet Diameter each; I know not with what\r\nPurpose; but such is the present Enthusiasm for promoting and improving\r\nthis Discovery, that probably we shall soon make considerable Progress\r\nin the art of constructing and using the Machines.\r\n\r\nAmong the Pleasanteries Conversation produces on this subject, some\r\nsuppose Flying to be now invented, and that since Men may be supported\r\nin the Air, nothing is wanted but some light handy instrument to give\r\nand direct Motion. Some think Progressive Motion on the Earth may\r\nbe advanc’d by it, and that a Running Footman or a Horse slung and\r\nsuspended under such a Globe so as to have no more of Weight pressing\r\nthe Earth with their Feet, then Perhaps 8 or 10 pounds, might with a\r\nfair Wind run in a straight Line across Countries as fast as that Wind,\r\nand over Hedges, Ditches & even Waters. It has been even fancied that\r\nin time People will keep such Globes anchored in the Air, to which by\r\nPullies they may draw up Game to be preserved in the Cool & Water to be\r\nfrozen when Ice is wanted. And that to get Money, it will be contriv’d\r\nto give People an extensive View of the Country, by running them up in\r\nan Elbow Chair a Mile high for a Guinea, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n                                                         B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               PASSY, Nov. 22d, 1783.\r\n\r\n... Enclosed is a copy of the Proces verbal taken of the Experiment\r\nyesterday in the Garden of the Queen’s Palace la Muette, where the\r\nDauphin now resides, which being near my House I was present. This\r\nPaper was drawn up hastily, and may in some Places appear to you\r\nobscure; therefore I shall add a few explanatory Observations.\r\n\r\nThis Balloon was larger than that which went up from Versailles and\r\ncarried the Sheep, &c. Its bottom was open, and in the middle of the\r\nOpening was fixed a kind of Basket Grate, in which Faggots and Sheaves\r\nof Straw were burnt. The Air rarefied in passing thro’ this Flame rose\r\nin the Balloon, swell’d out its sides, and Fill’d it.\r\n\r\nThe Persons who were plac’d in the Gallery made of Wicker, and attached\r\nto the Outside near the Bottom, had each of them a Port thro’ which\r\nthey could pass Sheaves of Straw into the Grate to keep up the Flame,\r\n& thereby keep the Balloon full. When it went over our Heads, we could\r\nsee the Fire which was very considerable. As the Flame slackens, the\r\nrarefied Air cools and condenses, the Bulk of the Balloon diminishes\r\nand it begins to descend. If those in the Gallery see it likely to\r\ndescend in an improper Place, they can by throwing on more Straw, &\r\nrenewing the Flame, make it rise again, and the Wind carries it farther.\r\n\r\nOne of these courageous Philosophers, the Marquis d’Arlandes, did me\r\nthe honour to call upon me in the Evening after the Experiment, with\r\nMr. Montgolfier, the very ingenious Inventor. I was happy to see him\r\nsafe. He informed me that they lit gently, without the least Shock, and\r\nthe Balloon was very little damaged.\r\n\r\nThis method of filling the Balloon with hot Air is cheap and\r\nexpeditious, and it is supposed may be sufficient for certain\r\npurposes, such as elevating an Engineer to take a view of an Enemy’s\r\nArmy, Works, &c., conveying Intelligence into, or out of a besieged\r\nTown, giving Signals to distant places, or the like.\r\n\r\nThe other method of filling a Balloon with permanently elastic\r\ninflammable Air, and then closing it is a tedious Operation, and\r\nvery expensive; Yet we are to have one of that kind sent up in a few\r\ndays. It is a Globe of 26 feet diameter. The Gores that compose it\r\nare red and white Silk, so that it makes a beautiful appearance. A\r\nvery handsome triumphal Car will be suspended to it, in which Messrs.\r\nRoberts, two Brothers, very ingenious Men, who have made it in concert\r\nwith Mr. Charles, propose to go up. There is room in this Car for a\r\nlittle Table to be placed between them, on which they can write and\r\nkeep their journal, that is, take Notes of everything they observe, the\r\nState of their Thermometer, Barometer, Hygrometer, &c., which they will\r\nhave more leisure to do than the others, having no fire to take care\r\nof. They say they have a contrivance which will enable them to descend\r\nat Pleasure. I know not what it is. But the Expence of this machine,\r\nFilling included, will exceed, it is said, 10,000 Livres.\r\n\r\nThis Balloon of only 26 feet diameter, being filled with Air ten times\r\nlighter than common Air, will carry up a greater Weight than the other,\r\nwhich tho’ vastly bigger, was filled with an Air that could scarcely be\r\nmore than twice as light. Thus the great Bulk of one of these Machines,\r\nwith the short duration of its Power, & the great Expence of filling\r\nthe other will prevent the Inventions being of so much Use as some may\r\nexpect, till Chemistry can invent a cheaper light Air producible with\r\nmore Expedition.\r\n\r\nBut the Emulation between the two Parties running high, the Improvement\r\nin the Construction and Management of the Balloons had already made\r\na rapid Progress; and one cannot say how far it may go. A few Months\r\nsince the idea of Witches riding thro’ the Air upon a Broomstick, and\r\nthat of Philosophers upon a Bag of Smoke, would have appeared equally\r\nimpossible and ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThese Machines must always be subject to be driven by the Winds.\r\nPerhaps Mechanic Art may find easy means to give them progressive\r\nMotion in a Calm, and to slant them a little in the Wind.\r\n\r\nI am sorry this Experiment is totally neglected in England, where\r\nmechanic Genius is so strong. I wish I could see the same Emulation\r\nbetween the two Nations as I see between the two Parties here. Your\r\nPhilosophy seems to be too bashful. In this Country we are not so\r\nmuch afraid of being laught at. If we do a foolish thing, we are the\r\nfirst to laugh at it ourselves, and are almost as much pleased with\r\na Bon Mot or a Chanson, that ridicules well the Disappointment of a\r\nProject, as we might have been with its Success. It does not seem to me\r\na good reason to decline prosecuting a new Experiment which apparently\r\nincreases the power of a Man over Matter, till we can see to what use\r\nthat power can be applied. When we have learnt to manage it, we may\r\nhope some time or other to find Uses for it, as men have done for\r\nMagnetism and Electricity, of which the first Experiments were mere\r\nMatters of Amusement.\r\n\r\nThis Experience is by no means a trifling one. It may be attended with\r\nimportant Consequences that no one can foresee. We should not suffer\r\nPride to prevent our progress in Science.\r\n\r\nBeings of a Rank and Nature far superior to ours have not disdained\r\nto amuse themselves with making and launching Balloons, otherwise we\r\nshould never have enjoyed the Light of those glorious objects that rule\r\nour Day & Night, nor have had the Pleasure of riding round the Sun\r\nourselves upon the Balloon we now inhabit.\r\n\r\n                                                         B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 PASSY, Dec. 1, 1783.\r\n\r\nIn mine of yesterday I promised to give you an account of Messrs.\r\nCharles & Roberts’ Experiment, which was to have been made this Day,\r\nand at which I intended to be present. Being a little indispos’d, &\r\nthe Air cool, and the Ground damp, I declin’d going into the Garden\r\nof the Tuilleries where the Balloon was plac’d, not knowing how long\r\nI might be oblig’d to wait there before it was ready to depart; and\r\nchose to stay in my Carriage near the Statue of Louis XV, from whence I\r\ncould well see it rise, & have an extensive View of the Region of Air\r\nthro’ which, as the Wind sat, it was likely to pass. The Morning was\r\nfoggy, but about one o’clock the Air became tolerably clear; to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of spectators, who were infinite. Notice having been\r\ngiven of the intended Experiment several days before in the Papers,\r\nso that all Paris was out, either about the Tuilleries, on the Quays\r\n& Bridges, in the Fields, the Streets, at the Windows, or on the Tops\r\nof Houses, besides the inhabitants of all the Towns & Villages of the\r\nEnvirons. Never before was a philosophical Experiment so magnificently\r\nattended. Some Guns were fired to give Notice that the departure of\r\nthe great Balloon was near, and a small one was discharg’d which went\r\nto an amazing height, there being but little Wind to make it deviate\r\nfrom its perpendicular Course, and at length the Sight of it was lost.\r\nMeans were used, I am told, to prevent the great Balloon’s rising so\r\nhigh as might endanger its Bursting. Several Bags of Sand were taken\r\non board before the Cord that held it down was cut, and the whole\r\nWeight being then too much to be lifted, such a Quantity was discharg’d\r\nas to permit its Rising slowly. Thus it would sooner arrive at that\r\nRegion where it would be in equilibrio with the surrounding Air, and\r\nby discharging more Sand afterwards, it might go higher if desired.\r\nBetween One & Two o’Clock, all Eyes were gratified with seeing it\r\nrise majestically from among the Trees and ascend gradually above the\r\nBuildings, a most beautiful Spectacle! When it was about 200 feet high,\r\nthe brave Adventurers held out and wav’d a little white Pennant, on\r\nboth sides their Car, to salute the Spectators, who return’d loud Claps\r\nof Applause. The Wind was very little, so that the Object, tho’ moving\r\nto the Northward, continued long in View; and it was a great while\r\nbefore the admiring People began to disperse. The persons embark’d\r\nwere Mr. Charles, Professor of Experimental Philosophy, & zealous\r\nPromotor of that Science; and one of the Messieurs Robert, the very\r\ningenious Constructors of the Machine. When it arrived at its height,\r\nwhich I suppose might be 3 or 400 Toises, it appeared to have only\r\nhorizontal Motion. I had a Pocket Glass, with which I follow’d it,\r\ntill I lost Sight first of the Men, then of the Car, and when I last\r\nsaw the Balloon, it appear’d no bigger than a Walnut. I write this at\r\n7 in the evening. What became of them is not yet known here. I hope\r\nthey descended by Day-light, so as to see and avoid falling among\r\nTrees or on Houses, and that the Experience was completed without any\r\nmischievous Accident, which the Novelty of it & the want of Experience\r\nmight well occasion. I am the more anxious for the Event, because I am\r\nnot well informed of the Means provided for letting themselves gently\r\ndown, and the Loss of these very ingenious Men would not only be a\r\nDiscouragement to the Progress of the Art, but be a sensible Loss to\r\nScience and Society.\r\n\r\nTuesday Morning, December 2,—I am reliev’d from my Anxiety by hearing\r\nthat the Adventurers descended well near l’Isle Adam, before Sunset.\r\nThis Place is near 7 Leagues from Paris. Had the Wind blown fresh, they\r\nmight have gone much farther.\r\n\r\nP.S. Tuesday Evening ... I hear farther that the Travellers had perfect\r\nCommand of the Carriage, descending as they pleas’d by letting some of\r\nthe inflammable Air escape, and rising again by discharging some Sand;\r\nthat they descended over a Field so low as to talk with Labourers in\r\npassing and mounted again to pass a Hill. The little Balloon falling at\r\nVincennes shows that mounting higher it met with a Current of Air in a\r\ncontrary Direction; an Observation that may be of use to future aërial\r\nVoyagers.\r\n\r\n                                                         B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             APPENDIX III\r\n\r\n                SUCCESSFUL MILITARY DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS\r\n\r\n                                FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Clément-Bayard II_[80]\r\n\r\nThe _Clément-Bayard II_ may be classed among the airships usually\r\ncalled “flexible.” The shape of its hull is preserved not by any rigid\r\nframing, but by internal gas pressure maintained by ballonets fed by\r\nventilating fans. Moreover, the suspension which binds envelope and car\r\ntogether as one solid is composed wholly of flexible elements, without\r\nany rigid intermediary structure.\r\n\r\nThe general plan, then, of the craft comprises three prominent\r\nfeatures, well marked and distinct in character:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The fish-shaped envelope with major section well forward, a form\r\nfavorable to both speed and stability.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The trussed girderlike car whose length allows the load to be\r\ndistributed over the hull, thus preserving its nicety of outline.\r\nThe most minute and technical and mechanical details were studied\r\nfor eighteen months by M. Clément and his devoted collaborator, the\r\nengineer Sabathier. The girder car, as will be seen presently, is\r\nparticularly well designed to serve as car, sustainer and stiffener. No\r\nstabilizing device is attached to the envelope; all are fixed to the\r\ncar, on which is mounted also the complete propulsion plant.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The suspension which binds the buoyant envelope to the car serves\r\nno other purpose. Note also the ingenious arrangement of two motors\r\nand two propellers, forming two independent systems, yet unitable\r\nunder certain conditions. The placement of the propellers, rudders and\r\nstabilizing surfaces well above the bottom of the car, insures them\r\nagainst dangerous contact on landing, or while maneuvering near the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe envelope is of rubberized Continental cloth. Its volume is 7,000\r\ncubic meters, length 76.5 meters and major diameter 13.22 meters, or\r\nan elongation of 5.76 diameters. Inside the gas envelope is an air bag\r\nof 2,200 cubic meters. It is divided into two compartments, _Q_ and\r\n_Q´_, which can be filled with air together or separately through the\r\nair duct, _Q_, joined to a blower, _P_, run by the two motors, or by\r\nhand when so desired. The balloon proper comprises two gas valves, _R_.\r\nEach compartment of the ballonet has one air valve, _S_. The valves of\r\nthe type Clément-Bayard-Chauvière are automatic. Their construction is\r\nso perfect that for the first time in France, at least on a balloon of\r\nso large bulk, the blower runs continuously in constant communication\r\nwith the ballonet, the pressure in the envelope remaining invariable,\r\ndue to the regular play of the valves, which yield at the pressure for\r\nwhich they are set. They may also be Worked by hand from the pilot’s\r\nbridge in case of emergency. The envelope has on its upper side three\r\nripping seams, one in the middle, the others toward either end. These\r\nrip panels can be worked together or separately, and permit the rapid\r\ndeflation of the balloon.\r\n\r\nThe long car is attached to the hull by hempen duck feet fastened to\r\na bolt rope running along the envelope below the equator; these duck\r\nfeet terminate below in steel suspension cables fixed to the car. Below\r\nthe principal bolt rope are others to which are fastened the duck\r\nfeet of the oblique cords, which assure the perfect solidarity of the\r\nenvelope and car. The steel cable sustainers have an ingenious patented\r\nregulating windlass. The girder car consists of a latticed girder,\r\nbuilt of steel tubes united with cast-iron joints and steel-tie wires.\r\nIts whole length is 45 meters, of which 14.5 meters constitute the car\r\nproper. It is divided into segments which are easily demountable, thus\r\nrendering it easily transportable by truck or railway. The forward\r\nsegment, _A_, tapers toward the front to a sharp point and is of\r\ntriangular cross-section. The mid segment, _B_, constituting the car,\r\nhas a quadrangular section of variable size. The rear segment, _D_, is\r\nof triangular section, diminishing progressively toward the rear, which\r\nrises to a sort of tail supporting the empennage and the direction\r\nrudders. The entire girder car when resting on the ground is supported\r\nby two pneumatic shock absorbers, _U_, _U_, projecting from its floor.\r\n\r\nThe car proper comprises three parts: in front, the motor and machine\r\nroom, 2.5 meters wide; in the middle, the elevated bridge, _N_, for\r\nthe pilot and his aide; in the rear, the passenger cabin, 8 meters\r\nlong, 1.3 meters wide and 2 meters high for the observers and wireless\r\ntelegraphy plant. The two reservoirs of essence, _M_, _m_, are placed\r\nabove the passenger about the center of pressure. The blower _P_, for\r\nthe ballonets, and the guide ropes _T_, are placed above the pilot’s\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nIn the motor room are symmetrically arranged two Bayard-Clément\r\nengines, _G G_, separated enough to allow free passage between them.\r\nEach motor is elastically supported to obviate vibrations, and connects\r\nwith the transmission shaft by a variable speed gear. The engines\r\ncan be run separately or together by a connecting sprocket chain, and\r\ndevelop 100 to 130 horse-power each. The cooling of each motor is\r\neffected by an aluminum radiator, _L L_, of large surface.\r\n\r\nThe Chauvière propellers, _K K_, six feet in diameter, are driven by\r\nshafting and gear wheels at a normal speed of 250 rotations per minute.\r\nA special recording device serves to show their thrust at each instant,\r\nas also the torque of the motors.\r\n\r\nThe pilot, standing on the bridge where he enjoys a clear view, has\r\nimmediate charge of the vessel’s movements. Before him are the various\r\ncontrols which he must operate, and the divers indicators which he must\r\nconsult. These are the direction wheel, the manometers, the aneroid\r\nand registering barometers, the clinometer, the blower control to\r\nregulate the amount and distribution of pressure, the elevating-rudder\r\nwheel, the spark control, the ripping cord, the release string of the\r\nguide-rope, and the system of transmitting orders to the mechanicians\r\nwhereby he can control the engines and the blowers which furnish air to\r\nthe radiator and ballonet.\r\n\r\nThe direction and poise of the vessel in flight are controlled by the\r\nrudders and empennage at the rear, and its altitude from minute to\r\nminute is governed by the elevating biplane _E´_, of 30 square meters\r\nabove the car in the mid region of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The _Patrie_[81]\r\n\r\nThe _Patrie_, the third of its type, was first operated in 1906. The\r\ngas bag of the first balloon was built by Surcouf at Billancourt,\r\nParis. The mechanical part was built at the Lebaudy Sugar Refinery.\r\nSince then the gas bags have been built at the Lebaudy balloon shed at\r\nMoisson, near Paris, under the direction of their aëronaut, Juchmes.\r\nThe gas bag of the _Patrie_ was 197 feet long with a maximum diameter\r\nof 33 feet, 9 inches, situated about 2/5 of the length from the front;\r\nvolume 111,250 cubic feet; length approximately six diameters. This\r\nrelation, together with the cigar shape, is in accordance with the\r\nplans of Colonel Renard’s dirigible, built and operated in France in\r\n1884; the same general shape and proportions being found in the Ville\r\nde Paris.\r\n\r\nThe first Lebaudy was pointed at the rear, which is generally admitted\r\nto be the proper shape for the least resistance, but to maintain\r\nstability it was found necessary to put a horizontal and vertical plane\r\nthere, so that it had to be made an ellipsoid of revolution to give\r\nattachment for these planes.\r\n\r\nThe ballonet for air had a capacity of 22,958 cubic feet or about 1/5\r\nof the total volume. This is calculated to permit reaching a height of\r\nabout one mile and to be able to return to the earth, keeping the gas\r\nbag always rigid. To descend from a height of one mile, gas would be\r\nreleased by the valve, then air pumped into the ballonet to keep the\r\ngas bag rigid, these two operations being carried on alternately. On\r\nreaching the ground from the height of one mile, the air would be at\r\nthe middle of the lower part of the gas bag and would not entirely fill\r\nthe ballonet. To prevent the air from rolling from one end to the other\r\nwhen the air ship pitches, thus producing instability, the ballonet\r\nwas divided into three compartments by impermeable cloth partitions.\r\nNumerous small holes were pierced in these partitions, through which\r\nthe air finally reached the two end compartments.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1907, the _Patrie_ was enlarged by 17,660 cubic feet\r\nby the addition of a cylindrical section at the maximum diameter,\r\nincreasing the length but not the maximum diameter.\r\n\r\n_The Gas Bag._—The gas bag is cut in panels; the material is a rubber\r\ncloth made by the Continental Tire Company at Hanover, Germany. It\r\nconsists of four layers arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                          Weight oz. per\r\n                                                           square yard.\r\n  _a._ Outer layer of cotton cloth covered with lead chromate  2.5\r\n  _b._ Layer of vulcanized rubber                              2.5\r\n  _c._ Layer of cotton cloth                                   2.5\r\n  _d._ Inner layer of vulcanized rubber                        2.21\r\n                                                             ------\r\n        Total weight                                           9.71\r\n\r\nA strip of this cloth one foot wide tears at a tension of about 934\r\npounds. A pressure of about one inch of water can be maintained in the\r\ngas bag without danger. The lead chromate on the outside is to prevent\r\nthe entrance of the actinic rays of the sun, which would cause the\r\nrubber to deteriorate. The heavy layer of rubber is to prevent the\r\nleaking of the gas. The inner layer of rubber is merely to prevent\r\ndeterioration of the cloth by impurities in the gas. This material\r\nhas the warp of the two layers of cotton cloth running in the same\r\ndirection and is called straight thread. The material in the ballonet\r\nweighs only about 7¾ ounces per square yard, and has a strength of\r\nabout 336 pounds per running foot. When the _Patrie_ was enlarged in\r\nSeptember, 1907, the specifications of the material allowed a maximum\r\nweight of 10 ounces per square yard, a minimum strength of 907 pounds\r\nper running foot, and a loss of 5.1 cubic inches of hydrogen per square\r\nyard in twenty-four hours at a pressure of 1.18 inches of water. Bands\r\nof cloth are pasted over the seams inside and out with a solution of\r\nrubber to prevent leaking through the stitches.\r\n\r\n_Suspension._—One of the characteristics of the _Patrie_ is the “short”\r\nsuspension. The weight of the car is distributed over only about 70\r\nfeet of the length of the gas bag. To do this, an elliptical-shaped\r\nframe of nickel-steel tubes is attached to the bottom of the gas\r\nbag; steel cables run from this down to the car. A small hemp net\r\nis attached to the gas bag by means of short wooden cross-pieces,\r\nor toggles, which are let into holes in a strong canvas band which\r\nis sewed directly on the gas bag. The metal frame, or platform, is\r\nattached to this net by means of toggles, so that it can be quickly\r\nremoved in dismounting the air ship for transportation. The frame can\r\nalso be taken apart, 28 steel cables about 0.2 inches in diameter run\r\nfrom the frame down to the car, and are arranged in triangles. Due\r\nto the impossibility of deforming a triangle, rigidity is maintained\r\nbetween the car and gas bag.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the “short” suspension of the _Patrie_ is the\r\ndeformation of the gas bag. A distinct curve can be seen in the middle.\r\n\r\n_The Car._—The car is made of nickel-steel tubes (12 per cent nickel).\r\nThis metal gives the greatest strength for minimum weight. The car is\r\nboat-shaped, about 16 feet long, about 5 feet wide and 2½ feet high.\r\nAbout 11 feet separate the car from the gas bag. To prevent any chance\r\nof the fire from the engine communicating with the hydrogen, the steel\r\nframework under the gas bag is covered with a noncombustible material.\r\n\r\nThe pilot stands at the front of the car, the engine is in the\r\nmiddle, the engineer at the rear. Provision is made for mounting a\r\ntelephotographic apparatus, and for a 100-candle-power acetylene\r\nsearchlight. A strong pyramidal structure of steel is built under the\r\ncar, pointing downward. In landing the point comes to the ground first\r\nand this protects the car, and especially the propellers, from being\r\ndamaged. The car is covered to reduce air resistance. It is so low,\r\nhowever, that part of the equipment and most of the bodies of those\r\ninside are exposed, so that the total resistance of the car is large.\r\n\r\n_The Motor._—The first Lebaudy had a 40-horse-power Daimler-Mercedes\r\nbenzine motor. The _Patrie_ was driven by a 60 to 70-horse-power\r\n4-cylinder Panhard and Levassor benzine motor, making 1,000 r. p. m.\r\n\r\n_The Propellers._—There are two steel propellers 8½ feet in diameter\r\n(two blades each) placed at each side of the engine, this giving the\r\nshortest and most economical transmission. To avoid any tendency to\r\ntwist the car, the propellers turn in opposite directions. They are\r\n“high speed,” making 1,000 to 1,200 r. p. m.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline tank is placed under the car inside the pyramidal frame.\r\nThe gasoline is forced up to the motor by air compression. The exhaust\r\nis under the rear of the car pointing down and is covered with a metal\r\ngauze to prevent flames coming out. The fan which drives the air into\r\nthe ballonet is run by the motor, but a dynamo is also provided so\r\nthat the fan can always be kept running even if the motor stops. This\r\nis very essential as the pressure must be maintained inside the gas\r\nbag so that the latter will remain rigid and keep its form. There are\r\nfive valves in all, part automatic and part both automatic and also\r\ncontrolled from the car with cords. The valves in the ballonet open\r\nautomatically at less pressure than the gas valves, so that when the\r\ngas expands all the air is driven out of the ballonet before there is\r\nany loss of gas. The ballonet valves open at a pressure of about O.78\r\ninches of water, the gas valves at about 2 inches.\r\n\r\n_Stability._—Vertical stability is maintained by means of fixed\r\nhorizontal planes. One having a surface of 150 square feet is attached\r\nat the rear of the gas bag and due to its distance from the center of\r\ngravity is very efficient. The elliptical frame attached under the gas\r\nbag has an area of 1,055 square feet, but due to its proximity to the\r\ncenter of gravity, has little effect on the stability. Just behind\r\nthe elliptical frame is an arrangement similar to the feathering of\r\nan arrow. It consists of a horizontal plane of 150 square feet, and a\r\nvertical plane of 113 square feet. To maintain horizontal stability,\r\nthat is, to enable the air ship to move forward in a straight line\r\nwithout veering to the sides, fixed vertical planes are used. One runs\r\nfrom the center to the rear of the elliptical frame and has an area of\r\n108 square feet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vertical surface of 113 square feet at the rear of\r\nthe elliptical frame, there is a fixed plane of 150 square feet at the\r\nrear of the gas bag. To fasten the two perpendicular planes at the\r\nrear of this gas bag, cloth flaps are sewed directly on the gas bag.\r\nNickel-steel tubes are placed in the flaps, which are then laced over\r\nthe tubes. With these tubes as a base, a light tube and wire framework\r\nis attached and waterproof cloth laced on this framework. Additional\r\nbraces run from one surface to the other and from each surface to the\r\ngas bag. The rudder is at the rear under the gas bag. It has about 150\r\nsquare feet and is balanced.\r\n\r\nA movable horizontal plane near the center of gravity, above the\r\ncar, is used to produce rising or descending motion, or to prevent\r\nan involuntary rising or falling of the air ship due to expansion or\r\ncontraction of the gas or to other causes. After the adoption of this\r\nmovable horizontal plane, the loss of gas and ballast was reduced to a\r\nminimum. Ballast is carried in 10- and 20-pound sandbags. A pipe runs\r\nthrough the bottom of the car from which the ballast is thrown.\r\n\r\nThere are two long guide-ropes, one attached at the front of the\r\nelliptical frame and the other on the car. On landing, the one in front\r\nis seized first so as to hold the air ship with the head to the wind.\r\nThe motor may then be stopped and the descent made by pulling down on\r\nboth guide-ropes. A heavy rope 22 feet long, weighing 110 pounds, is\r\nattached at the end of a 164-foot guide-rope. This can be dropped out\r\non landing to prevent coming to the ground too rapidly. The equipment\r\nof the car includes a “siren” speaking trumpet, carrier pigeons, iron\r\npins and a rope for anchoring the air ship, reserve supply of fuel and\r\nwater, and fire extinguisher.\r\n\r\nAfter being enlarged in September, 1907, the _Patrie_ made a number of\r\nlong trips at an altitude of 2,500 to 3,000 feet. In November, 1907,\r\nshe went from Paris to Verdun, near the German frontier, a distance of\r\nabout 175 miles, in about 7 hours, carrying four persons. This trip was\r\nmade in a light wind blowing from the northeast. Her course was east,\r\nso that the wind was unfavorable. On Friday, November 20, 1907, during\r\na flight near Verdun, the motor stopped due to difficulty with the\r\ncarburetor. The air ship drifted with the wind to a village about 10\r\nmiles away, where she was safely landed. The carburetor was repaired on\r\nthe 20th. Soon after, a strong wind came up and tore loose some of the\r\niron pickets with which it was anchored. This allowed the air ship to\r\nswing broadside to the wind; it then tilted over on the side far enough\r\nto let some of the ballast bags fall out. The 150 or 200 soldiers who\r\nwere holding the ropes were pulled along the ground until directed by\r\nthe officer in charge to let go. After being released, it rose and was\r\ncarried by the wind across the north of France, the English Channel\r\nand into the north of Ireland. It struck the earth there, breaking off\r\none of the propellers, and then drifted to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The _République_\r\n\r\nThis is the latest of the French military dirigible balloons, and\r\ndiffers but slightly from its predecessor, the _Patrie_. The volume has\r\nbeen increased by about 2,000 cubic feet. The length has been reduced\r\nto 200 feet and the maximum diameter increased to 35½ feet. The shape\r\nof the gas bag accounts for the 2,000 additional cubic feet of volume.\r\nThe motor and propeller are as in the _Patrie_. The total lifting\r\ncapacity is 9,000 pounds, of which 2,700 pounds are available for\r\npassengers, fuel, ballast, instruments, etc. Its best performance was a\r\n125-mile flight made in 6½ hours against an unfavorable wind.\r\n\r\nThe material for the gas bag of the new air ship was furnished by the\r\nContinental Tire Company. It is made up as follows:\r\n\r\n                               Weight oz. per\r\n                                square yard.\r\n  Outer yellow cotton layer         3.25\r\n  Layer of vulcanized rubber        3.25\r\n  Layer of cotton cloth             3.25\r\n  Inner layer of rubber             0.73\r\n                                  ------\r\n      Total weight                 10.48\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the changes which this type has undergone\r\nsince the first one was built. The _Jaune_, constructed in 1902-3, was\r\npointed at the rear and had no stability plane there; later it was\r\nrounded off at the rear and a fixed horizontal plane attached. Finally\r\na fixed vertical plane was added. The gas bag has been increased in\r\ncapacity from 80,670 cubic feet to about 131,000 cubic feet. The\r\nmanufacturers have been able to increase the strength of the material\r\nof which the gas bag is made, without materially increasing the weight.\r\nThe rudder has been altered somewhat in form. It was first pivoted on\r\nits front edge, but later on a vertical axis, somewhat to the rear of\r\nthis edge. With the increase in size, has come an increase in carrying\r\ncapacity and, consequently, a greater speed and more widely extended\r\nfield of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Ville de Paris_\r\n\r\nThis air ship was constructed for Mr. Deutsch de la Meurthe, of\r\nParis, who has done a great deal to encourage aërial navigation. The\r\nfirst _Ville de Paris_ was built in 1902, on plans drawn by Tatin,\r\na French aëronautical engineer. It was not a success. Its successor\r\nwas built in 1906, on plans of Surcouf, an aëronautical engineer and\r\nballoon builder. The gas bag was built at his works in Billancourt,\r\nthe mechanical part at the Voisin shop, also in Billancourt. The plans\r\nare based on those of Colonel Renard’s air ship, the _France_, built\r\nin 1884, and the _Ville de Paris_ resembles the older air ship in many\r\nparticulars. In September, 1907, Mr. Deutsch offered the use of his air\r\nship to the French Government. The offer was accepted, but delivery was\r\nnot to be made except in case of war or emergency. When the _Patrie_\r\nwas lost in November, 1907, the military authorities immediately took\r\nover the Deutsch air ship.\r\n\r\n_Gas Bag._—The gas bag is 200 feet long for a maximum diameter of 34½\r\nfeet, giving a length of about 6 diameters, as in the _France_ and\r\nthe _Patrie_. Volume, 112,847 cubic feet; maximum diameter at about\r\n⅜ of the distance from the front, approximately, as in the _Patrie_.\r\nThe middle section is cylindrical with conical sections in front\r\nand rear. At the extreme rear is a cylindrical section with eight\r\nsmaller cylinders attached to it. The ballonet has a volume of 21,192\r\ncubic feet or about ⅕ of the volume, the same proportion found in\r\nthe _Patrie_. The ballonet is divided into three compartments from\r\nfront to rear. The division walls are of permeable cloth, and are not\r\nfastened to the bottom so that when the middle compartment fills with\r\nair, and the ballonet rises, the division walls are lifted up from\r\nthe bottom of the gas bag, and there is free communication between\r\nthe three compartments. The gas bag is made up of a series of strips\r\nof perpendicular to a meridian line. These strips run around the\r\nbag, their ends meeting on the under meridian. This is known as the\r\n“barchistode” method of cutting out the material, and has the advantage\r\nof bringing the seams parallel to the line of greatest tension. They\r\nare therefore more likely to remain tight and not allow the escape\r\nof gas. The disadvantage lies in the fact that there is a loss of\r\n33⅓ per cent of material in cutting. The material was furnished by\r\nthe Continental Tire Company, and has approximately the same tensile\r\nstrength and weight as that used in the _Patrie_. It differs from the\r\nother in one important feature—it is diagonal thread, that is, the warp\r\nof the outer layer of cotton cloth makes an angle of 45 degrees with\r\nthe warp of the inner layer of cotton cloth. The result is to localize\r\na rip or tear in the material. A tear in the straight thread material\r\nwill continue along the warp, or the weave, until it reaches a seam.\r\n\r\n_Valves._—There are five in all, made of steel, about fourteen inches\r\nin diameter; one on the top connected to the car by a cord, operated by\r\nhand only; two near the rear underneath. These are automatic but can\r\nbe operated by hand from the car. Two ballonet valves directly under\r\nthe middle are automatic and are also operated from the car by hand.\r\nThe ballonet valves open automatically at a pressure of 2/3 inches of\r\nwater; the gas valves open at a higher pressure.\r\n\r\n_Suspension._—This air ship has the “long” suspension. That is, the\r\nweight is distributed along practically the entire length of the gas\r\nbag. A doubled band of heavy canvas is sewn with six rows of stitches\r\nalong the side of the gas bag. Hemp ropes running into steel cables\r\ntransmit most of the weight of the car to these two canvas bands and\r\nthus to the gas bag. On both sides and below these first bands are\r\ntwo more. Lines run from these to points half way between the gas\r\nbag and the car, then radiate from these points to different points\r\nof attachment on the car. This gives the triangular or nondeformable\r\nsystem of suspension, which is necessary in order to have the car and\r\ngas bag rigidly attached to each other. With this “long” suspension,\r\nthe _Ville de Paris_ does not have the deformation so noticeable in the\r\ngas bag of the _Patrie_.\r\n\r\n_The Car._—This is in the form of a trestle. It is built of wood with\r\naluminum joints and O.12 inch wire tension members. It is 115 feet\r\nlong, nearly 7 feet high at the middle and a little over 5½ feet wide\r\nat the middle. It weighs 660 pounds and is considered unnecessarily\r\nlarge and heavy. The engine and engineer are well to the front, the\r\naëronaut with steering wheels is about at the center of gravity.\r\n\r\n_Motor._—The motor is a 70 to 75-horse-power _Argus_, and is\r\nexceptionally heavy.\r\n\r\n_Propeller._—The propeller is placed at the front end of the car. It\r\nthus has the advantage of working in undisturbed air; the disadvantage\r\nis the long transmission and difficulty in attaching the propeller\r\nrigidly. It has two blades and is 19.68 feet long with a pitch of\r\n26.24 feet. The blades are of cedar with a steel arm. The propeller\r\nmakes a maximum of 250 turns per minute when the engine is making 900\r\nrevolutions. Its great diameter and width compensate for its small\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n_Stability._—This is maintained entirely by the cylinders at the rear.\r\nCounting the larger one to which the smaller ones are attached, there\r\nare five, arranged side by side corresponding to the horizontal planes\r\nof the _Patrie_, and five vertical ones corresponding to the _Patrie’s_\r\nvertical planes. The volume of the small cylinders is so calculated\r\nthat the gas in them is just sufficient to lift their weight, so they\r\nneither increase nor decrease the ascensional force of the whole. The\r\nhorizontal projection of these cylinders is 1,076 square feet. The\r\ncenter of this projection is 72 feet from the center of gravity of the\r\ngas. The great objection to this method of obtaining stability, is the\r\nair resistance due to these cylinders, and consequent loss of speed.\r\nThe stability of the _Ville de Paris_ in a vertical plane is said to be\r\nsuperior to that of the _Patrie_, due to the fact that the stability\r\nplanes of the latter do not always remain rigid. The independent\r\nvelocity of the _Ville de Paris_ probably never exceeded 25 miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_The Rudder._—The rudder has a double surface of 150 square feet placed\r\nat the rear end of the car, 72 feet from the center of gravity. It is\r\nnot balanced, but is inclined slightly to the rear so that its weight\r\nwould make it point directly to the rear if the steering gear should\r\nbreak. Two pairs of movable horizontal planes, one at the rear of the\r\ncar having 43 square feet, and one at the center of gravity (as on the\r\n_Patrie_) having 86 square feet, serve to drive the air ship up or down\r\nwithout losing gas or ballast.\r\n\r\n_Guide-Ropes._—A 400-foot guide-rope is attached at the front end of\r\nthe car. A 230-foot guide-rope is attached to the car at the center of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty men are required to maneuver the _Ville de Paris_ on the\r\nground. The pilot has three steering wheels, one for the rudder and\r\ntwo for the movable horizontal planes. The instruments used are an\r\naneroid barometer, a registering barometer giving heights up to 1,600\r\nfeet, and an ordinary dynamometer, which can be connected either with\r\nthe gas bag or ballonet by turning a valve. A double column of water\r\nis also connected to the tube to act as a check on the dynamometer.\r\nDue to the vibration of the car caused by the motor, these instruments\r\nare suspended by rubber attachments. Even with this arrangement, it is\r\nnecessary to steady the aneroid barometer with the hand in order to\r\nread it. The vibration prevents the use of the statoscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GERMANY\r\n\r\nThree different types of air ships are being developed in Germany. The\r\n_Gross_ is the design of Major Von Gross, who commands the Balloon\r\nBattalion at Tegel near Berlin. The _Parseval_ is being developed by\r\nMajor Von Parseval, a retired German officer, and the _Zeppelin_ is the\r\ndesign of Count Zeppelin, also a retired officer of the German Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The _Gross_\r\n\r\nThe first air ship of this type made its first ascension on July 23,\r\n1907. The mechanical part was built at Siemen’s Electrical Works in\r\nBerlin; the gas bag by the Riedinger firm in Augsburg.\r\n\r\n_Gas Bag._—The gas bag is made of rubber cloth furnished by the\r\nContinental Tire Company similar to that used in the _Ville de Paris_.\r\nIt is diagonal-thread, but there is no inner layer of rubber, as they\r\ndo not fear damage from impurities in the hydrogen gas. Length, 131¼\r\nfeet; maximum diameter about 39⅓ feet; volume, 63,576 cubic feet; the\r\nelongation is about 3⅓. The form is cylindrical with spherical cones at\r\nthe ends, the whole being symmetrical.\r\n\r\n_Suspension._—The suspension is practically the same as that of the\r\n_Patrie_. A steel and aluminum frame is attached to the lower part of\r\nthe gas bag, and the car is suspended on this by steel cables. The\r\nobjection to this system is even more apparent in the _Gross_ than in\r\nthe _Patrie_. A marked dip along the upper meridian of the gas bag\r\nshows plainly the deformation.\r\n\r\n_The Car._—The car is boat-shaped like that of the _Patrie_. It is\r\nsuspended thirteen feet below the gas bag.\r\n\r\n_Motor._—The motor is a 20- to 24-horse-power, 4-cylinder\r\nDaimler-Mercedes.\r\n\r\n_Propellers._—There are two propellers 8³/₁₀ foot in diameter, each\r\nhaving two blades. They are placed one on each side, but well up under\r\nthe gas bag near the center of resistance. The transmission is by belt.\r\nThe propellers make 800 r. p. m.\r\n\r\n_Stability._—The same system, with planes, is used in the _Gross_ as\r\nin the _Patrie_, but it is not nearly so well developed. At the rear\r\nof the rigid frame, attached to the gas bag, are two fixed horizontal\r\nplanes, one on each side. A fixed vertical plane runs down from between\r\nthese horizontal planes, and is terminated at the rear by the rudder.\r\nA fixed horizontal plane is attached on the rear of the bags as in the\r\n_Patrie_. The method of attachment is the same, but the plane is put on\r\nbefore inflation in the _Gross_ air ship, afterwards in the _Patrie_.\r\nThe stability of the _Gross_ air ship in a vertical plane is reported\r\nto be very good, but it is said to veer considerably in attempting to\r\nsteer a straight course.\r\n\r\nThe many points of resemblance between this dirigible and the Lebaudy\r\ntype are worthy of notice. The suspension or means of maintaining\r\nstability, and the disposition for driving are in general the same. As\r\nfirst built, the _Gross_ had a volume of 14,128 cubic feet less than\r\nat present, and there was no horizontal plane at the rear of the gas\r\nbag. Its maximum speed is probably fifteen miles per hour. As a result\r\nof his experiments of 1907, Major Von Gross has this year produced a\r\nperfected air ship, built on the same lines as his first, but with\r\ngreatly increased volume and dimensions. The latest one has a volume of\r\n176,000 cubic feet, is driven by two 75-horse-power Daimler motors, and\r\nhas a speed of 27 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOn September 11th of this year, the _Gross_ air ship left Berlin at\r\n10.25 P.M., carrying four passengers, and returned the next day at\r\n11.30 A.M., having covered 176 miles in the period of a little over 13\r\nhours. This is the longest trip, both in point of time and distance,\r\never made by any air ship returning to the starting point.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The _Parseval_\r\n\r\nThe _Parseval_ air ship is owned and controlled by the Society for the\r\nStudy of Motor Balloons. This organization, composed of capitalists,\r\nwas formed practically at the command of the emperor, who is very much\r\ninterested in aërial navigation. The society has a capital of 1,000,000\r\nmarks, owns the _Parseval_ patents and is ready to construct air ships\r\nof the _Von Parseval_ type. The present air ship was constructed by the\r\nRiedinger firm at Augsburg, and is operated from the balloon house of\r\nthis society at Tegel, adjoining the military balloon house.\r\n\r\nThe gas bag is similar in construction to that of the _Drachen_\r\nballoon, used by the army for captive work. Volume, 113,000 cubic\r\nfeet; length, 190 feet; maximum diameter, 30½ feet. It is cylindrical\r\nin shape, rounded at the front and pointed at the rear. The material\r\nwas furnished by the Continental Tire Company. It is diagonal-thread,\r\nweighing about 11³/₁₀ ounces per square yard and having a strength of\r\nabout 940 pounds per running foot. Its inner surface is covered with a\r\nlayer of rubber.\r\n\r\n_Ballonets._—There are two ballonets, one at each end, each having a\r\ncapacity of 10,596 cubic feet. The material in the ballonet weighs\r\nabout 8¼ ounces per square yard, the cotton layers being lighter than\r\nin the material for the gas bag. Air is pumped into the rear ballonet\r\nbefore leaving the ground, so that the air ship operates with the front\r\nend inclined upward. The air striking underneath exerts an upward\r\npressure, as on an aëroplane, and thus adds to its lifting capacity.\r\nAir is pumped into the ballonets from a fan operated by the motor.\r\nA complex valve, just under the middle of the gas bag, enables the\r\nengineer to drive air into either, or both ballonets. The valves also\r\nact automatically and release air from the ballonets at a pressure of\r\nabout 0.9 inches of water.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the top of the gas bag is a valve for releasing the\r\ngas. It can be operated from the car, and open automatically at a\r\npressure of about 2 inches of water. Near the two ends and on opposite\r\nsides are two rip strips controlled from the car by the cords.\r\n\r\n_Suspension._—The suspension is one of the characteristics of the air\r\nships, and is protected by patents. The car has four trolleys, two on\r\neach side, which run on two steel cables. The car can run backwards\r\nand forwards on these cables, thus changing its position with relation\r\nto the gas bag. This is called “loose” suspension. Its object is to\r\nallow the car to take up, automatically, variations in thrust due to\r\nthe motor, and variations in resistance due to the air. Ramifications\r\nof hemp rope from these steel cables are sewed onto a canvas strip,\r\nwhich in turn is sewed onto the gas bag. This part of the suspension is\r\nthe same as in the _Drachen_ balloon. The weight is distributed over\r\nthe entire length of the gas bag.\r\n\r\n_The Car._—The car is 16.4 feet long and is built of steel tubes and\r\nwire. It is large enough to hold the motor and three men, though four\r\nor five may be taken.\r\n\r\n_Motor._—The motor is a 110-horse-power Daimler-Mercedes. Sufficient\r\ngasoline is carried for a run of twelve hours.\r\n\r\n_Propeller._—The propeller, like the suspension, is peculiar to this\r\nair ship and is protected by patents. It has four cloth blades which\r\nhang limp when not turning. When the motor is running, these blades,\r\nwhich are carefully weighed with lead at certain points, assume the\r\nproper position due to the various forces acting. The diameter is 13¾\r\nfeet. The propeller is placed above the rear of the car near the center\r\nof resistance. Shaft transmission is used. The propeller makes 500\r\nr. p. m. to 1,000 of the motor. There is a space of 6½ feet from the\r\npropeller blades to the gas bag, the bottom of the car being about 30\r\nfeet from the gas bag. This propeller has the advantage of being very\r\nlight. Its position, so far from the engine, necessarily incurs a great\r\nloss of power in transmission.\r\n\r\nThe steering wheel at the front of the car has a spring device for\r\nlocking it in any position.\r\n\r\nThe 1908 model No. 1 of this air ship was constructed for the purpose\r\nof selling it to the government. Among other requirements is a 12-hour\r\nflight without landing, and a sufficient speed to maneuver against a\r\n22-mile wind. A third and larger air ship of this type is now under\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n                    _Signal Corps Dirigible No. 1_\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of funds, the United States Government has not been\r\nable to undertake the construction of an air ship sufficiently large\r\nand powerful to compete with those of European nations. However,\r\nspecifications were sent out last January for an air ship not over 120\r\nfeet long and capable of making 20 miles per hour. Contract was awarded\r\nto Capt. Thomas S. Baldwin, who delivered an air ship last August to\r\nthe Signal Corps, the description of which follows:\r\n\r\n_Gas Bag._—The gas bag is spindle shaped, 96 feet long, maximum\r\ndiameter, 19 feet 6 inches, with a volume of 20,000 cubic feet. A\r\nballonet for air is provided inside the gas bag, and has a volume of\r\n2,800 cubic feet. The material for the gas bag is made of two layers of\r\nJapanese silk, with a layer of vulcanized rubber between.\r\n\r\n_Car._—The car is made of spruce, and is 66 feet long, 2½ feet wide and\r\n2½ feet high.\r\n\r\n_Motor._—The motor is a 20-horse-power water-cooled Curtiss make.\r\n\r\n_Propeller._—The propeller is at the front end of the car, and is\r\nconnected to the engine by a steel shaft. It is built of spruce, has\r\na diameter of 10 feet, 8 inches, with a pitch of 11 feet, and turns\r\nat the rate of 450 r. p. m. A fixed vertical surface is provided at\r\nthe rear end of the car to minimize veering, and a horizontal surface\r\nattached to the vertical rudder at the rear tends to minimize pitching.\r\nA double horizontal surface controlled by a lever and attached to the\r\ncar in front of the engine, serves to control the vertical motion and\r\nalso to minimize pitching.\r\n\r\nThe position of the car very near to the gas bag, is one of the\r\nfeatures of the Government dirigible. This reduces the length and\r\nconsequently the resistance of the suspension, and places the propeller\r\nthrust near the center of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe total lifting power of the air ship is 1,350 pounds of which\r\n500 pounds are available for passengers, ballast, fuel, etc. At its\r\nofficial trials a speed of 19.61 miles per hour was attained over a\r\nmeasured course and an endurance run lasting two hours, during which\r\nseventy per cent of the maximum speed was maintained.\r\n\r\n_Dirigible No. 1_, as this air ship has been named, has already served\r\na very important purpose in initiating officers of the Signal Corps\r\nin the construction and operation of a dirigible balloon. With the\r\nexperience now acquired, the United States Government is in a position\r\nto proceed with the construction and operation of an air ship worthy of\r\ncomparison with any now in existence, but any efforts in this direction\r\nmust await the action of Congress in providing the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX IV\r\n\r\n        THE RELATIONS OF WEIGHT, SPEED AND POWER OF FLYERS[82]\r\n\r\n                    _By Wilbur and Orville Wright_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flyer of 1903 carried a four-cylinder gasoline motor of four-inch\r\nbore and four-inch stroke. Complete with magneto, radiators, tanks,\r\nwater, fuel, etc., the motor weighed a little over 200 pounds, and at\r\n1,200 revolutions per minute developed 16 horse power for the first 15\r\nseconds after starting. After a minute or two the power did not exceed\r\n13 or 14 horse power. At 1,020 revolutions per minute—the speed of the\r\nmotor in the flights at Kitty Hawk on the 17th of December, 1903—it\r\ndeveloped about 12 horse power.\r\n\r\nThe flyer of 1904 was equipped with a motor similar to the first, but\r\nof 1/8-inch larger bore. This engine at 1,500 revolutions per minute\r\ndeveloped 24 horse power for the first 15 seconds, but only 16 to 17\r\nhorse power after a few minutes run. Complete with water, fuel and\r\nother accessories, it weighed 240 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe same engine with a few modifications in the oiling device and the\r\ncarburetor, was used in all the flights of 1905. A test of its power\r\nmade soon after the flights of October, 1905, revealed a gain of 3\r\nhorse power over tests made just before mounting it on the flyer\r\nin 1904. This gain is attributed to the increased smoothness of the\r\ncylinders and pistons produced by wear. The small output of these\r\nengines was due to lack of experience in building gasoline motors.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year further improvements have been made, and our\r\nlatest engines of four-inch bore and four-inch stroke produce about 25\r\nhorse power continuously. The improvement in the reliability of the\r\nmotor has been even more marked, so that now flights of long distances\r\ncan be attempted without danger of failure on account of the stopping\r\nof the motor.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the flyers of 1903, 1904 and 1905 show some interesting\r\nfacts. The flyer of 1903 weighed, complete with operator, 745 pounds.\r\nIts longest flight was of 59 seconds duration, with a speed of 30 miles\r\nan hour and an expenditure of 12 horse power. The flyer of 1904 weighed\r\nabout 900 pounds, including a load of 70 pounds in iron bars. A speed\r\nof more than 34 miles an hour was maintained for a distance of three\r\nmiles with an expenditure of 17 horse power. The flyer of 1905 weighed,\r\nincluding load, 925 pounds. With an expenditure of 19 to 20 horse power\r\nit traveled over 24 miles at a speed of more than 38 miles an hour. The\r\nflights of 1904 and 1905 would have been slightly faster had they been\r\nmade in a straight line, as were those of 1903.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, 62 pounds per horse power were carried at a speed of 30 miles\r\nan hour; in 1904, 53 pounds, at 34 miles an hour; and in 1905, 46\r\npounds at 38 miles an hour. It will be noted that the weight carried\r\nper horse power is almost exactly in inverse ratio to the speed, as\r\ntheory demands—the higher the speed, the smaller the weight carried per\r\nhorse power.\r\n\r\nSince flyers can be built with approximately the same dynamic\r\nefficiency for all speeds up to 60 miles an hour, a flyer designed to\r\ncarry a total weight of 745 pounds at 20 miles an hour would require\r\nonly 8 horse power or two thirds of the power necessary for 30 miles an\r\nhour. At 60 miles 24 horse power would be necessary—twice that required\r\nto carry the same weight at 30 miles an hour. At 120 miles an hour 60\r\nto 75 horse power would probably be necessary, and the weight carried\r\nper horse power would be only 10 or 12 pounds. At such high speed\r\nthe resistance of the operator’s body and the engine is a formidable\r\nfactor, consuming 64 times as much horse power as at 30 miles an hour.\r\nAt speeds below 60 miles an hour this resistance is almost negligible.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the limits of speed have not as yet been closely\r\napproached in the flyers already built, and that in the matter of\r\ndistance, the possibilities are even more encouraging. Even in the\r\nexisting state of the art it is easy to design a practical and durable\r\nflyer that will carry an operator and supplies of fuel for a flight of\r\nover 500 miles at a speed of 50 miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX V\r\n\r\n          CURTISS’S EXPERIMENTS IN RISING FROM THE WATER[83]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years Glenn H. Curtiss, who, more than any other\r\nexperimenter, has been given to developing the aëroplane for various\r\nuses, has experimented with floats for his biplane that would enable\r\nit to rise from the surface of the water. Something over a year ago he\r\nsucceeded in developing a speed of about twenty miles an hour on the\r\nwater, but this was insufficient to rise from the surface.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the new year Mr. Curtiss moved to the Pacific Coast\r\nand set about endeavoring to develop suitable floats which would make\r\nit possible for his machine to rise from the surface of the water.\r\nThese experiments have been carried on at San Diego, where Mr. Curtiss\r\nis instructing several naval and military officers in the art of flying.\r\n\r\nIn his first experiments on the Pacific Coast Mr. Curtiss followed\r\nthe successful experiments of this sort made by M. Henri Fabre at\r\nMarseilles, France, about a year ago, as far as the design of his\r\nfloats was concerned. He constructed one large float six feet wide,\r\nfive feet from front to rear, and one foot thick at its central point,\r\nand placed this under the center of the machine. The bottom of this\r\nfloat was perfectly flat and arranged at an incline of ten or twelve\r\ndegrees. Some distance forward of the main float, at about the position\r\nof the front wheel in the land machine, another float six feet wide,\r\nby one foot from front to rear, and six inches deep, was placed; while\r\nat the extreme front end of the machine, on a special outrigger, was\r\nmounted a small elevating hydroplane six feet wide by eight inches\r\nin a fore-and-aft direction, and one and one-half inches thick. This\r\nhydroplane was fixed at an angle of about twenty-five degrees and was\r\nintended to lift the front part of the machine. A spray shield was\r\nfitted back of it, as shown in the diagram, page 333.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments were made with these new floats on January 26th\r\nlast; and although they made a considerable disturbance in the water,\r\nespecially at low speed, the aviator was enabled to get up a speed on\r\nthe surface of about forty-five miles an hour. He found that at as low\r\na rate as ten miles the hydroplanes (which normally were submerged)\r\nrose to the surface, while as the speed increased only the rear edges\r\nof the two main planes were required to support the machine. The\r\naëroplane readily attained sufficient speed to rise in the air, for\r\nas the speed increased and the floats emerged from the water, the\r\nhead resistance of the floats diminished and there was only the skin\r\nfriction of the water on a few inches of the rear edge of these floats,\r\nplus the air resistance, to be overcome.\r\n\r\nAt the first try-out, while traveling over the water at high speed,\r\nMr. Curtiss found himself suddenly nearing the shore, and to avoid\r\nrunning aground he turned his horizontal rudder sharply upward, with\r\nthe result that the machine rose from the water with perfect ease.\r\nHe soon alighted again, and in the second flight he made a circle\r\nand remained in the air a minute and twenty-one seconds. Two other\r\nexperimental flights were made the first day, and on January 27th he\r\nmade a three-and-one-half-minute flight and stated, upon alighting,\r\nthat he found no difficulty in remaining aloft as long as he pleased.\r\nThe machine showed a speed of fifty miles an hour in the air as against\r\nforty-five miles an hour when skimming over the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS STARTING FROM THE WATER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS BIPLANE FOR LAND AND WATER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS TRIPLANE RISEN FROM THE WATER.]\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with the several floats with which he had attained\r\nhis first success in rising from the water, Mr. Curtiss immediately\r\nconstructed a single float twelve feet long by two feet in width\r\nand twelve inches deep. This float is built of wood and resembles a\r\nflat-bottomed boat or scow, the top being covered with canvas to keep\r\nthe water from getting in. Three feet from the front end the bottom\r\nis curved upward forming a bow the full width of the float, while at\r\nthe same distance from the rear the float slants downward in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThis single float is placed under the aëroplane in such a position that\r\nthe main weight of the machine and aviator is slightly to the rear of\r\nthe center of the float, which causes the latter to incline upward\r\nslightly and thus gives the necessary angle for hydroplaning on the\r\nsurface of the water. The weight of this new float is but fifty pounds,\r\nor less than half as much as that of the two floats that were used\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe paint was barely dry on the new float before Mr. Curtiss had it\r\nfitted to his machine and gave it a trial. This was done on February\r\n1st and the trial was thoroughly successful. The machine ran over the\r\nsurface of the water with very much less disturbance than before and\r\nrose in the air readily. A glance at the photographs showing the new\r\nand the old floats in action will give one an excellent idea of the\r\nmuch less commotion caused by the single scow-shaped float. Besides\r\nbeing much more compact and creating less disturbance, this float or\r\nscow can be used for carrying articles or a passenger.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the aëroplane from tilting to one side or the other,\r\nan inclined stick four feet long and three inches wide, to which is\r\nattached on its upper side an inflated rubber tube, is fastened to the\r\nfront edge of the lower plane at each end. By the use of these props\r\nthe aëroplane does not tip readily when skimming along the surface,\r\neven though the scow-shaped float used is but two feet in width.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting with success with his new float, Mr. Curtiss, on February\r\n17th, made more flights with the motor and propeller placed at the\r\nfront of his biplane and with his seat placed at the rear of the main\r\nplanes. The chief of these flights was one which he made from North\r\nIsland, where he is experimenting, over San Diego harbor to the cruiser\r\n_Pennsylvania_. He alighted upon the surface close beside the cruiser\r\nand his aëroplane was hauled up beside the warship and placed on her\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nAfter a short visit on the cruiser the aviator was again lowered to the\r\nsurface in his machine. A sailor started the engine, and Mr. Curtiss\r\nflew back to his starting point in short order. The naval authorities\r\nwere greatly pleased with his demonstration and it is probable that the\r\nNavy Department will purchase one of these machines in the near future\r\nand continue the instruction of its officers.\r\n\r\nAfter increasing the surface of his biplane Mr. Curtiss, on February\r\n24th, took up one of his naval pupils, Lieutenant T. G. Ellyson, as\r\na passenger. He made a flight of one and one-half miles, rising to a\r\nheight of one hundred feet and flying as slowly as twenty-five miles an\r\nhour, or as fast as fifty miles an hour, at will. Lieutenant Ellyson\r\nwas seated on the pontoon below the aëroplane. He could look down\r\nin the water and see bottom at a depth of twenty-five feet, and he\r\nbelieves submarines can be easily located by flying over the water.\r\nThe slow speed at which it is possible to fly will make the biplane\r\nespecially useful for bomb dropping. As we go to press Mr. Curtiss is\r\nabout to try his machine fitted with wheels and floats as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abbe, Cleveland, 200, 437.\r\n\r\n    Acosta, 10.\r\n\r\n    Ader, C.

It is reported that they crashed through the      |\r\n|     skylight, and that the lady of the house regretted not being     |\r\n|     there to receive them.                                           |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [3] _Mechanical Principles of Flight._                               |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [4] The reader may like to know that the basis of so much confidence |\r\n|     was that ancient Euclidean theorem connecting the surfaces and   |\r\n|     volumes of similar figures with certain powers of their          |\r\n|     homologous linear dimensions.                                    |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [5] The writer has made hydrogen-inflated varnish bubbles a foot     |\r\n|     in diameter which ascended swiftly to the ceiling; also,         |\r\n|     air-inflated varnish bubbles a foot and a half in diameter       |\r\n|     which lasted an hour. These, if suitably heated, may be made     |\r\n|     to ascend; but this experiment is more difficult.                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [6] Both had studied science in college.

A     |\r\n|     man had applied to a light boat a very large screw, the thread   |\r\n|     of which was a thin plate, two feet broad, applied by its edge   |\r\n|     spirally around a small axis. It somewhat resembled a bottle     |\r\n|     brush, if you will suppose the hairs of the bottle brush         |\r\n|     joining together, and forming a spiral plane. This, turned on    |\r\n|     its axis in the air, carried the vessel across the Seine. It     |\r\n|     is, in fact a screw which takes hold of the air and draws        |\r\n|     itself along by it; losing, indeed, much of its effort by the    |\r\n|     yielding nature of the body it lays hold of to pull itself on    |\r\n|     by. I think it may be applied in the water with much greater     |\r\n|     effect and to very useful purposes. Perhaps it may be used       |\r\n|     also for the balloon.”                                           |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [10] _La Navigation Aerienne_, Gaston Tissandier.                    |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [11] The motive power equals the product of the speed and            |\r\n|     resistance. But in the assumed case, the speed is doubled and    |\r\n|     the resistance quadrupled; hence, the power required is          |\r\n|     eightfold.                                                       |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [12] Santos-Dumont, _My Airships_.                                   |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [13] m^3 signifies cubic meters.
