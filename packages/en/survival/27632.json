Longley, and E. D. Hardy.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Washington filtration plant has already been fully described.[2]\r\nAt the time that paper was written (November, 1906), the filtration\r\nplant had been in operation for only about 1 year. It has now been\r\nin continuous operation for 5 years, and many data on the cost,\r\nefficiency, and methods of operation, have accumulated in the\r\nvarious records and books which have been kept. It is thought that a\r\nbrief review of the results, and a summary of the records in tabular\r\nform, will be of interest to the members of the Society, and it is\r\nalso hoped that the discussion of this paper will bring out the\r\ncomparative results of operation of other filter plants. As a matter\r\nof convenience, the following general description of the plant is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Filtration Plant._--The Washington filtration\r\nplant was completed and put in operation in October, 1905. It\r\nconsists of a pumping station for raising the water from the\r\nMcMillan Park Reservoir to the filter beds; 29 filters of the slow\r\nsand type, having an effective area of 1 acre each; the\r\nfiltered-water reservoir, having a capacity of about 15,000,000\r\ngal.; and the necessary piping and valves for carrying water,\r\ncontrolling rates of filtration, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Presented at the meeting of February 15th, 1911.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: \"Works for the Purification of the Water Supply of\r\n   Washington, D. C.,\" by Allen Hazen and E. D. Hardy, Members, Am.\r\n   Soc. C. E., _Transactions_, Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. LVII, p. 307.]\r\n\r\nIn the pumping station, there are three centrifugal pumps, which are\r\ndirectly connected to tandem compound engines; two sand-washer\r\npumps; three small electric generating sets for furnishing electric\r\nlight; and four 200-h.p., water-tube boilers.\r\n\r\nEach of the centrifugal pumps has a nominal capacity of 40,000,000\r\ngal. per day when pumping against a head of 21 ft., and each\r\nsand-washer pump has a capacity of 2,500,000 gal. when pumping\r\nagainst a head of 250 ft. The electric light engines and generators\r\nsupply the current for lighting the pumping station, the office and\r\nlaboratory and other buildings, and also the courts and interior of\r\nthe filter beds, and for operating a machine-shop.\r\n\r\nThe filters and filtered-water reservoir are built entirely of\r\nconcrete masonry. The floors are of inverted groined arches on which\r\nrest the piers for supporting the groined arch vaulting. All this\r\nconcrete work is similar to that in the Albany, Philadelphia, and\r\nPittsburg filters.\r\n\r\nThe filters contain, on an average, 40 in. of filter sand and 12 in.\r\nof filter gravel. The gravel is graded from coarse to fine; the\r\nlower and coarser part acts as part of the under-drain system, and\r\nthe upper and finest layer supports the filter sand. The raw water\r\nfrom the pumps is carried to the filters through riveted steel\r\nrising mains which have 20-in. cast-iron branches for supplying the\r\nindividual filters. The filtered water is collected in the\r\nunder-drainage system of the several filter beds, and is carried\r\nthrough 20-in., cast-iron pipes to the regulator-houses. These\r\nregulator-houses contain the necessary valves, registering\r\napparatus, etc., for regulating the rate of filtration, showing the\r\nloss of head, shutting down a filter, filling a filter with filtered\r\nwater from the under-drains, and for turning the water back into the\r\nraw-water reservoir, or wasting it into the sewer. From the\r\nregulator-houses, the filtered water flows directly to the\r\nfiltered-water reservoir. Generally, five filters are controlled\r\nfrom one house, but there are two cases where the regulator-houses\r\nare smaller, and only two filters are controlled from each.\r\n\r\nThe dirty sand removed from the filters is carried by a portable\r\nejector through one or more lengths of 3-in. hose and a fixed line\r\nof 4-in. pipe, to the sand washers. From the sand washers, the\r\nwashed sand is carried to the reinforced concrete storage bins, each\r\nof which has a capacity of 250 cu. yd., and is at such an elevation\r\nthat carts may be driven under it and loaded through a gate.\r\n\r\nUntil April, 1909, the sand was replaced in the filters by carts\r\nwhich were filled through the gates in the sand bins. It was then\r\nhauled to the top of the filter beds and dumped through the manholes\r\non the chutes, which could be revolved in any direction. These\r\nchutes were used to prevent the sand from being unduly compacted in\r\nthe vicinity of the manholes, and to facilitate spreading it in the\r\nfilters. Since April, 1909, all the sand has been replaced by the\r\nhydraulic method. An ejector is placed under the gate in the sand\r\nbin, and the sand is carried in a reverse direction from the bin\r\nthrough the 4-in. piping and one or more lengths of hose to the\r\nfilter bed. This process has lowered the cost of re-sanding\r\nconsiderably, and present indications are that it will prove\r\nentirely satisfactory in every way.\r\n\r\nThe average effective size and uniformity coefficient of the filters\r\nare shown in Table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ~Table 1--Filter Sand as Originally Placed.~\r\n  =======+===============+============+========+==========\r\n  Filter |    Average    |  Average   |Depth of| Average\r\n    No.  |effective size,| uniformity |sand, in|turbidity.\r\n         |in millimeters.|coefficient.| inches.|\r\n  -------+---------------+------------+--------+----------\r\n     1   |     0.32      |    1.88    |  35.3  |  2,600\r\n     2   |     0.30      |    1.78    |  37.7  |  2,200\r\n     3   |     0.32      |    1.77    |  40.2  |  3,000\r\n     4   |     0.29      |    1.80    |  42.5  |  1,800\r\n     5   |     0.34      |    1.74    |  44.9  |  2,700\r\n     6   |     0.31      |    1.78    |  37.7  |  2,300\r\n     7   |     0.29      |    1.72    |  40.1  |  2,300\r\n     8   |     0.32      |    1.75    |  40.2  |  2,800\r\n     9   |     0.32      |    1.78    |  42.5  |  2,900\r\n    10   |     0.30      |    1.69    |  39.5  |  2,500\r\n    11   |     0.34      |    1.93    |  37.1  |  2,600\r\n    12   |     0.29      |    1.66    |  34.7  |  2,100\r\n    13   |     0.32      |    1.83    |  33.6  |  3,500\r\n    14   |     0.29      |    1.66    |  33.6  |  2,600\r\n    15   |     0.33      |    1.75    |  39.0  |  2,400\r\n    16   |     0.33      |    1.78    |  42.3  |  3,000\r\n    17   |     0.33      |    1.86    |  45.5  |  3,300\r\n    18   |     0.34      |    1.80    |  48.7  |  3,100\r\n    19   |     0.34      |    1.80    |  52.0  |  .....\r\n    20   |     0.34      |    1.87    |  39.0  |  2,700\r\n    21   |     0.32      |    1.82    |  42.3  |  2,400\r\n    22   |     0.33      |    1.74    |  45.5  |  2,200\r\n    23   |     0.33      |    1.81    |  48.7  |  2,300\r\n    24   |     0.35      |    1.80    |  52.0  |  2,600\r\n    25   |     0.29      |    1.64    |  39.5  |  2,400\r\n    26   |     0.31      |    1.71    |  37.1  |  2,100\r\n    27   |     0.31      |    1.71    |  34.7  |  1,900\r\n    28   |     0.33      |    1.93    |  33.6  |  2,300\r\n    29   |     0.34      |    1.93    |  33.6  |  3,000\r\n  -------+---------------+------------+--------+----------\r\n  Maximum|     0.36      |    1.93    |  52.0  |  3,300\r\n  Minimum|     0.29      |    1.64    |  33.6  |  1,800\r\n  Average|     0.32      |    1.77    |  40.4  |  2,600\r\n  =======+===============+============+========+==========\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of Washington Aqueduct._--The water supply of\r\nWashington is taken from the Potomac River, at Great Falls, about 16\r\nmiles above the city. At that place, a dam has been built across the\r\nriver, which holds the water at an elevation of 150.5 ft. above mean\r\ntide at Washington. From Great Falls the water flows by gravity for\r\na distance of 16 miles through a 9-ft. conduit, three reservoirs,\r\nand a tunnel. From McMillan Park Reservoir, the last of the three,\r\nthe water is lifted by centrifugal pumps about 21 ft. to the\r\nfilters. After passing through the filters, it flows to the\r\nfiltered-water reservoir, and later to the city mains. In its\r\npassage from Great Falls to the filters, the water flows through\r\nthree settling reservoirs, which have already been referred to.\r\nThese reservoirs are known as the Dalecarlia, the Georgetown, and\r\nthe McMillan Park Reservoirs, and have available capacities of\r\n141,000,000, 140,000,000, and 180,000,000 gal., respectively.\r\n\r\n_Turbidity._--The Potomac River water is rather turbid, the\r\nturbidity being caused by very fine particles of clay. The river is\r\nsubject to sudden fluctuations, it being no uncommon thing to have a\r\nturbidity of 100 one day, and 1,000 the next. The high turbidity\r\nusually disappears about as rapidly as it comes, and is seldom\r\nhigher than 500 for more than 5 days at a time. It is frequently the\r\ncase, however, that a succession of waves of high turbidity will\r\nappear so close together that the effect of one has not disappeared\r\nbefore that of another is felt.\r\n\r\nThe clarification of the water supply begins at the dam at Great\r\nFalls. Here it is a clarification by exclusion, for when an\r\nexcessive quantity of mud appears in the river water, the gates are\r\nclosed, and the muddy water is allowed to flow over the dam and form\r\nmud-bars in the Lower Potomac, while the city is supplied from the\r\nwater stored in the three settling reservoirs. Until a comparatively\r\nrecent date, the excessively muddy water was never excluded, having\r\nbeen taken, like other decrees of Providence, as it came.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1907, the practice of shutting out water with a\r\nturbidity of 500 or more was established for the warm months. This\r\npractice was discontinued during the cold months, as it was feared\r\nthat a very high consumption of water might occur at the time of low\r\nwater in the reservoirs, and so cause a partial famine. During the\r\nwinter of 1909-10, however, the gates were closed, as was the\r\npractice throughout the summer months.\r\n\r\nWhen the reservoirs are well filled, and the consumption of water\r\nis less than 70,000,000 gal. per day, it is safe to close the gates\r\nat Great Falls for a period of about 4 days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 1--Plan and Profile of Washington Aqueduct.~]\r\n\r\nWhile a considerable reduction in turbidity is effected in each of\r\nthe reservoirs, the bulk of the mud is deposited at the upper end of\r\nDalecarlia Reservoir. This reservoir had become so completely\r\nfilled, that, in 1905, it was necessary to dredge a channel through\r\nthe deposit, in order to allow the water to pass it. During the\r\nsummers of 1907 and 1908, a 10-in. hydraulic dredge removed more\r\nthan 100,000 cu. yd. of mud which had been deposited in this\r\nreservoir. The mud deposited in Georgetown and McMillan Park\r\nReservoirs is so fine that the accumulation of many years is not\r\nvery noticeable in its effect on the depth of water.\r\n\r\nThe particles of clay which remain in the water after its passage\r\nthrough the three reservoirs, are so exceedingly small that they do\r\nnot settle out in any reasonable length of time. Even the filtration\r\nof the water through one or more slow sand filters occasionally\r\nfails to remove the last trace of turbidity. This is especially true\r\nin the colder months, and not a winter has passed when the water\r\nsupply has not been noticeably turbid at some time.\r\n\r\nA general idea of the quantity of mud contained in the river water,\r\nthe quantity excluded by closing the gates at Great Falls, and that\r\nremoved by sedimentation and filtration, may be gained from Table 2,\r\nwhich is, of course, only a rough approximation.\r\n\r\nTable 2 also shows that the gates were closed 10.50% of the time,\r\nthereby excluding 40.06% of the total suspended matter which\r\notherwise would have entered the system.\r\n\r\nThe turbidities, bacterial counts, and chemical analyses of numerous\r\nsamples of water are shown in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6. The amount of\r\nwork done in the pumping station, average consumption of water,\r\ndeath rate from typhoid fever, and filter runs are shown in Tables\r\n7, 8, 9, and 10.\r\n\r\n_Raking._--At the time the filters were first put in service, the\r\nsand bins had not been completed, and, consequently, the work of\r\ncleaning the filters was carried on in the old-fashioned way of\r\nscraping by hand and wheeling out the sand in barrows. This method\r\nof cleaning was used from October, 1905, to April, 1906; then the\r\nregular sand-handling system was commenced.\r\n\r\nAt times, during the first two summers the filters were in\r\noperation, considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping them\r\ncleaned as fast as was necessary to provide an ample supply of\r\nfiltered water. For a short period in each summer it was found\r\nnecessary to organize night shifts, and keep the work of cleaning\r\nin progress for from 16 to 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 2--General Plan of Washington Filtration Plant\r\nShowing Finished Surfaces.~]\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~Table 2--Tons of Suspended Matter Entering System, Etc.~\r\n\r\n      Columns:\r\n        A - Amount that would have entered the system if the gates\r\n              had been left continuously open.\r\n        B - Number of hours gates were closed.\r\n        C - Amount shut out.\r\n        D - Amount deposited in Dalecarlia Reservoir.\r\n        E - Amount deposited in Georgetown Reservoir.\r\n        F - Amount deposited in McMillan Park Reservoir.\r\n        G - Amount entering filtration plant.\r\n  =========+=======+=======+=======+=======+=====+=====+=====+========\r\n    Month. |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  E  |  F  |  G  | Total.\r\n  ---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+--------\r\n  1909.\r\n  ---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+--------\r\n  July     |  318  |  32.0 |     3 |     0 | 125 |  74 | 116 |   318\r\n  August   |  146  |  47.0 |     1 |     0 |  78 |  38 |  29 |   146\r\n  September|   97  |  57.0 |     7 |    21 |  13 |  38 |  18 |    97\r\n  October  |   61  |  90.5 |     8 |     7 |   9 |  25 |  12 |    61\r\n  November |   50  |  60.0 |     4 |    13 |   5 |  17 |  11 |    50\r\n  December |  370  |  99.0 |   126 |   108 |  33 |  59 |  44 |   370\r\n  ---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+--------\r\n  1910.\r\n  ---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+--------\r\n  January  | 2,410 | 136.0 | 1,109 | 1,020 |  67 | 117 |  97 | 2,410\r\n  February |   839 | 117.5 |   481 |   126 |  56 |  75 | 101 |   839\r\n  March    |   208 |   7.5 |    13 |    43 |  15 |  13 | 124 |   208\r\n  April    |   321 |  65.0 |    17 |   195 |  43 |  43 |  23 |   321\r\n  May      |   197 |  84.5 |    58 |    54 |  22 |  24 |  39 |   197\r\n  June     | 1,505 | 124.0 |   786 |   535 |  49 |  88 |  47 | 1,505\r\n  ---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+--------\r\n  Total    | 6,522 | 920.0 | 2,613 | 2,122 | 515 | 611 | 661 | 6,522\r\n  =========+=======+=======+=======+=======+=====+=====+=====+========\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve the situation at such times, the expedient of\r\nraking was tried. This was first attempted with the filters filled\r\nwith water; the effluent was first shut off in order to prevent a\r\ndownward flow of water, and the filter was then raked or harrowed\r\nfrom boats. This method was not satisfactory, however, as the work\r\nwas neither as uniform nor as thorough as necessary. Later, the\r\nfilters were drained to the necessary depth, and the surface of the\r\nsand was thoroughly stirred with iron garden rakes. The filters were\r\nthen filled with filtered water through the under-drains and put in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis latter method proved so satisfactory that it has been resorted\r\nto at all times when the work was at all pressing. When the runs\r\nwere of short duration, and the depth to which the mud had\r\npenetrated the filter sand was slight, a raking seemed to be nearly\r\nas effective in restoring the filter capacity as a scraping; it\r\ncould be done in 8 hours by 3 laborers, and there seemed to be no\r\nill effects from lowered efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ~Table 3--Turbidities.~\r\n

or\r\nraking, are shown in Tables 10 and 11.\r\n\r\n_Sand Handling._--For the first three years of operation, the sand\r\nwas carried from the sand bins in carts and dumped through the\r\nnumerous manholes of the filters on chutes which could be revolved\r\nin various directions, in order to facilitate the spreading of the\r\nsand evenly over the surface of the filter.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago, however, this method was changed, by substituting\r\nsand ejectors for the carts. By this method, an ejector is either\r\nattached to, or placed directly under, the outlet gate of the sand\r\nbin, the gate is opened, and the ejector is started. From this\r\nejector, the sand is carried back through the line of 4-in. fixed\r\npipe, and one or more lengths of 3-in. hose, to the point of\r\ndischarge in the filter bed which is being re-sanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ~Table 9.~\r\n\r\n      Columns:\r\n        A - July.\r\n        B - August.\r\n        C - September.\r\n        D - October.\r\n        E - November.\r\n        F - December.\r\n        G - January.\r\n        H - February.\r\n        I - March.\r\n        J - April.\r\n        K - May.\r\n        L - June.\r\n\r\n    (_A_) ~Number of Deaths from Typhoid Fever, by Months, in the\r\n      District of Columbia for the Last Fourteen Fiscal Years.~\r\n  ==========+====+====+====+====+====+====+===+===+===+===+===+===+======\r\n    Fiscal  |    |    |    |    |    |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     year.  | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G | H | I | J | K | L |Total.\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+------\r\n  1896-97   | 8  |15  |25  |25  |18  |16  |13 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 147\r\n  1897-98   |10  |16  |18  |10  | 9  |18  | 8 | 4 | 2 | 9 | 6 |20 | 130\r\n  1898-99   |24  |22  |22  |28  |21  |16  |10 | 4 | 7 | 6 | 3 | 6 | 169\r\n  1899-1900 | 9  |38  |30  |28  |27  |26  |17 | 6 | 8 |10 | 5 |12 | 193\r\n  1901-02   |16  |33  |28  |21  |22  |16  |19 | 8 |12 | 9 |13 | 9 | 206\r\n  1902-03   |21  |39  |25  |32  |19  |20  | 9 | 5 | 9 | 6 | 6 | 3 | 194\r\n  1903-04   |17  |26  |18  |19  | 8  |14  | 5 | 5 | 6 |10 | 8 | 8 | 144\r\n  1904-05   |16  |22  |25  |14  |11  | 9  |11 | 1 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 3 | 125\r\n  1905-06[1]|15  |30  |23  |26  |14  | 6  | 6 | 4 | 5 | 4 |10 | 9 | 152\r\n  1906-07   |21  |32  |21  |25  |17  | 4  | 7 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 2 | 152\r\n  1907-08   |10  |18  |17  |19  |11  | 7  | 4 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 107\r\n  1908-09   |15  |13  |23  |17  |16  |13  |16 | 8 | 3 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 146\r\n  1909-10   |12  |12  |17  |12  |12  | 2  | 3 | 4 | 7 | 5 | 5 | 4 |  95\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+------\r\n  Average   |15.3|25.5|22.9|21.5|16.6|13.1|9.6|4.4|5.8|6.7|6.4|7.5|155.4\r\n  ----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+------\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ~Table 9~--(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n      Columns:\r\n        A - July.\r\n        B - August.\r\n        C - September.\r\n        D - October.\r\n        E - November.\r\n        F - December.\r\n        G - January.\r\n        H - February.\r\n        I - March.\r\n        J - April.\r\n        K - May.\r\n        L - June.\r\n        M - Annual death rate.\r\n\r\n    (_B_) ~Number of Deaths from Typhoid Fever Reduced to\r\n        Death Rates per 100,000 Inhabitants per Year.~\r\n  ==========+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+====\r\n    Fiscal  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     year.  | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M\r\n  ----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----\r\n  1896-97   | 35| 65|109|109| 78| 70| 56| 17| 17| 17| 26| 39| 53\r\n  1897-98   | 43| 69| 78| 43| 39| 78| 31| 17|  8| 38| 25| 85| 46\r\n  1898-99   |102| 93| 93|119| 89| 68| 42| 17| 29| 25| 12| 26| 59\r\n  1899-1900 | 37|158|125|116|112|108| 69| 24| 33| 41| 20| 49| 74\r\n  1900-01   | 82|167|118|102|114| 69| 28|  8| 32|  8| 16| 40| 65\r\n  1901-02   | 64|132|112| 84| 88| 64| 75| 31| 47| 35| 51| 35| 68\r\n  1902-03   | 83|153| 98|126| 75| 79| 35| 19| 35| 23| 23| 12| 63\r\n  1903-04   | 66|100| 69| 73| 31| 54| 19| 19| 23| 38| 30| 30| 46\r\n  1904-05   | 61| 83| 95| 53| 42| 34| 41|  4| 19| 26|  4| 11| 39\r\n  1905-06   | 56|111| 85| 97| 52| 22| 22| 15| 18| 15| 36| 33| 47\r\n  1906-07   | 69|105| 69| 82| 56| 13| 24| 20| 13| 20| 24|  7| 42\r\n  1907-08   | 35| 64| 60| 67| 39| 25| 14|  4|  4| 28| 28| 11| 32\r\n  1908-09   | 53| 45| 80| 60| 56| 45| 56| 28| 10| 28| 24| 24| 43\r\n  1909-10   | 42| 42| 60| 42| 42|  7| 11| 14| 24| 17| 17| 14| 28\r\n  ----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----\r\n  Average   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  monthly   | 59| 99| 89| 84| 65| 53| 38| 24| 22| 26| 24| 30|...\r\n  death     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  rate.     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  ==========+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+====\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Filtered water supplied since October, 1905.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 3--Washington Aqueduct, D.

with water to the\r\nproposed depth of the sand layer. The outlet end of the hose is\r\nconnected to a 3-in. pipe which is supported on a boat, and the sand\r\nis discharged through this pipe at the point required. Work is first\r\nbegun at the far end of the filter, and it is gradually filled by\r\nswinging the boat from side to side and backing it by degrees to the\r\nfront end.\r\n\r\nAt first it was feared that a small quantity of mud would be deposited\r\non the surface of the old sand, and that this mud would ultimately cause\r\nsubsurface clogging. For this reason, when this method was first\r\nadopted, a man was required to rake the sand very thoroughly in front of\r\nthe discharge. Later, it was found that by giving the end of the\r\ndischarge pipe a slope of about 45 degrees downward from the horizontal,\r\nthe force of the current of sand and water could be depended on to cut\r\nthe old surface of sand to any required depth, and move it ahead\r\ntogether with the new sand, thus completely breaking up the possible mud\r\nlayer between the old and new sand layers. After having used this method\r\nalmost exclusively for 15 months, in which time eleven filters have been\r\nre-sanded, and 24,531 cu. yd. of sand have been replaced, there seems to\r\nbe no indication of an increased initial loss of head. The sand is very\r\ncompact, and has no apparent tendency to separate into different sizes.\r\nThe general appearance is similar to that of very fine sand on the\r\nseashore. The filters re-sanded in this way have been considerably more\r\nefficient than those in which the sand was replaced with carts, and as\r\nyet, no harmful results have been noted. The rate at which the sand is\r\nreplaced is shown in Table 12, and the cost of labor for sand handling\r\nis given in detail in Table 14, which shows that quite a perceptible\r\nsaving has been effected by the hydraulic method.\r\n\r\nThe figures showing the cost for sand handling do not include any\r\ncharge for the quantity of water used, that item having been carried\r\non the pumping-station account.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ~Table 11--Quantities of Sand Removed.~\r\n  ==============+=================+================================\r\n                |~No. of  filters |

=========+===========+========+===========+=========+========+========\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost for pumping water for sand handling, including all labor,\r\nmaterials, and repairs, amounts to $0.06 per cu. yd. of sand ejected\r\nand washed, and $0.03 per cu. yd. for replacing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the water used for carrying the sand which is being\r\nreplaced, it is customary to keep a slight upward flow in the\r\nfilter, thus using about 500,000 gal. of filtered water per day for\r\nthis purpose. Assuming the value of this water to be the total cost\r\nfor pumping, filtering, etc., or $3.80 per 1,000,000 gal., the cost\r\nper cubic yard of sand replaced would be about $0.02 when one\r\nejector is used, and $0.01 when two are in operation.\r\n\r\nIt is not considered absolutely necessary to have an upward flow of\r\nwater in the filter which is being re-sanded, and it is not always\r\ndone. It was used, however, as an additional safeguard against the\r\nformation of a stratum of mud between the old and new layers of sand\r\nwhile the hydraulic method was in an experimental stage.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of sand removed from the filters per scraping and the\r\nrates of sand handling are shown in Tables 11 and 12.\r\n\r\n_Cost of Operation._--It is frequently difficult to compare the\r\nrelative cost of corresponding items for different plants, because\r\nof the different methods of dividing the cost and the varying\r\nopinions of the officials as to what should properly be charged to\r\neach item.\r\n\r\nIn order that the data may be in sufficient detail to permit it to\r\nbe rearranged to compare with other plants, a list of employees and\r\ncharges for supplies is given in Table 13. This list accounts for\r\nthe entire appropriation for the care and maintenance of the\r\nfiltration plant, including pumping the water to the filters,\r\nparking and caring for the grounds, buildings, roads, sidewalks,\r\netc. The cost for the various items per million gallons pumped to\r\nthe filters is shown in Table 14, and the cost per cubic yard of\r\nsand handled in Table 15.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Treatment._--Before the present filtration plant was\r\ndesigned, Rudolph Hering, George W. Fuller, and Allen Hazen,\r\nMembers, Am. Soc. C. E., made an investigation and report. This\r\nreport was dated February 18th, 1901, and contained the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n   \"In consideration of the full evidence, we recommend the construction\r\n   of a complete system of slow or sand filters, with such auxiliary\r\n   works as may be necessary for preliminary sedimentation, and the use\r\n   of a coagulant for part of the time. There is no reason to believe\r\n   that the use of this coagulant will in any degree affect the\r\n   wholesomeness of the water.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this opinion, considerable prejudice existed among\r\nthe citizens of Washington against the use of a coagulant, and, as\r\nfinally passed, the bill providing for the construction of the\r\nfilters did not include an appropriation for the coagulant.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ~Table 13--List of Employees, Rates of Pay, and\r\n                 Approximate Cost for Supplies.~\r\n  ========================================================+===========\r\n   1 Superintendent                                       |  $3,000.00\r\n   1 Chief Chemist and Assistant Superintendent           |   2,100.00\r\n   1 First Assistant Chemist                              |   1,500.00\r\n   1 Second Assistant Chemist                             |   1,000.00\r\n   1 Stenographer and Clerk                               |   1,200.00\r\n   1 Surveyor                                             |   1,200.00\r\n   1 Laboratory Helper                                    |     720.00\r\n   1 Janitor                                              |     600.00\r\n   1 Chief Steam Engineer                                 |   1,800.00\r\n   1 First Assistant Steam Engineer                       |   1,440.00\r\n   1 Second Assistant Steam Engineer                      |   1,080.00\r\n   3 Oilers, at $900 each                                 |   2,700.00\r\n   3 Firemen, at $900 each                                |   2,700.00\r\n   3 Laborers, at $540 each                               |   1,620.00\r\n   1 Filter Foreman                                       |   1,200.00\r\n   2 Foremen, at $900 each                                |   1,800.00\r\n   1 Timekeeper                                           |     900.00\r\n   3 Watchmen and Gauge Tenders, at $900 each             |   2,700.00\r\n   1 Machinist                                            |   1,140.00\r\n   1 Blacksmith                                           |     900.00\r\n   1 Storekeeper                                          |     900.00\r\n   1 Painter                                              |     900.00\r\n   1 Mechanic                                             |     900.00\r\n   1 Electrician                                          |     900.00\r\n   4 Skilled Laborers at $600 each                        |   2,400.00\r\n   1 Watchman and Special Officer                         |     900.00\r\n   1 Recorder                                             |     720.00\r\n  27 Laborers, at $1.50 per day for 300 days              |  12,150.00\r\n   3 Teams, at $2.00 per day for 200 days                 |   1,200.00\r\n     Laboratory and office supplies                       |   2,700.00\r\n     Filter supplies, tools, hose, repair of              |\r\n       roads, parks, shrubs, etc.                         |   8,820.00\r\n     Pumping station supplies, oil, waste,                |\r\n       packing, repairs, etc.                             |   3,570.00\r\n     3,600 tons of coal, at $3.15 per ton                 |  11,340.00\r\n     Charges in U.

These tanks were filled with the layers of gravel and sand\r\nnecessary to make them represent as accurately as possible the large\r\nslow sand units of the main filtration plant. Means were also\r\nprovided for giving a preliminary treatment to the water supplying\r\neach of these experimental slow sand filters. In two cases, the\r\npreliminary treatment was rapid filtration, while the third\r\nconsisted of sedimentation and coagulation. The sedimentation tank\r\nwas of sufficient size, when compared with the area of the\r\nexperimental slow sand filter, to represent the Georgetown and\r\nMcMillan Park Reservoirs when used in connection with the large\r\nfilters. The first preliminary filter was very similar in construction\r\nand operation to a mechanical filter. The sand for this filter was\r\ntaken from the main filters, and, consequently, was finer than is\r\ngenerally used in mechanical filters. The second preliminary filter\r\nwas a Maignen scrubber. It consisted of a cylindrical concrete tank,\r\n4 ft. in diameter and 8-1/2 ft. deep, which contained 12 in. of\r\ncobble-stones on the bottom, then, successively, 12 in. of egg-size\r\ncoke, 12 in. of stove-size coke, 24 in. of nut-size coke, and 24 in.\r\nof sponge clippings as the final or top layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~Table 14--Cost Per Million Gallons Filtered.~\r\n                     (_A_)

the different systems, the combined\r\nrapid and slow sand filter will be designated as Filter Plant No. 1,\r\nthe combined Maignen scrubber and slow sand filter as Filter Plant\r\nNo. 2, and the combined coagulating basin and slow sand basin as\r\nFilter Plant No. 3.\r\n\r\nThe length of run of Filter Plant No. 1 was relatively long at\r\nfirst. The rapid rate of filtration, however, tended to carry the\r\nclay, which was suspended in the applied water, to a considerable\r\ndepth in the filtering material, so that the runs gradually\r\ndecreased in length until they were reduced to about three days.\r\nUnfortunately, it was necessary to use unfiltered water for washing,\r\nwhich, together with the great penetration from the applied water,\r\nfinally made it necessary to remove all the filtering materials, and\r\nwash them.\r\n\r\nAlthough this preliminary filter was operated at a high rate, its\r\nefficiency was quite satisfactory. In fact, at times when the\r\napplied water was comparatively good, very little work was left for\r\nthe slow sand filter. At times of high turbidity, however, some of\r\nthe exceedingly fine mud in the applied water passed through this\r\nfilter, as well as the slow sand filter connected with it, and it\r\nproved to be absolutely impossible to produce a clear effluent at\r\nall times with this combination.\r\n\r\nFilter Plant No. 2 proved more economical and convenient in\r\noperation, but somewhat less efficient than Filter Plant No. 1.\r\nNeither filter could be depended on to give a clear effluent when\r\nthe applied water was turbid.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of Filter Plant No. 3, sulphate of alumina was used\r\nwhen the applied water contained too much turbidity to be treated\r\nsatisfactorily by slow sand filters.\r\n\r\nWhen the water was comparatively clear, either one of the three\r\nsystems, or slow sand filtration alone, was entirely satisfactory.\r\nAt times of high turbidity, however, Filter Plant No. 3 was the only\r\none which could be depended on to produce a clear effluent.\r\n\r\nA fair comparison between the results of the three systems when\r\ntreating turbid water in January, 1908, is given in Table 16.\r\n\r\nTable 16 shows very clearly that neither Filter Plant No. 1 nor No.\r\n2 would prove at all satisfactory when treating turbid water, while\r\nNo. 3 could be depended on under all conditions. The results of\r\noperation are shown in detail in Tables 17, 18, and 19. It will be\r\nnoticed in Table 17, that on March 10th, 1908, Filter Plant No. 1\r\nwas put out of service and a Puech system of preliminary filters was\r\nsubstituted for it.\r\n\r\nThe Puech preliminary filters consisted of five units containing\r\ngravel of varying sizes through which the water was filtered\r\nsuccessively before it was finally applied to the final slow sand\r\nfilter. A general idea of this system may be obtained by referring\r\nto Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~Table 16--Turbidity Results with Experimental Filters,\r\n        During Period of High Turbidity, January, 1908.~\r\n\r\n      Columns:\r\n        A - Effluent preliminary filter.\r\n        B - Effluent sand filter.\r\n        C - Effluent preliminary filter.\r\n        D - Effluent sand filter.\r\n        E - Effluent coagulant basin.\r\n        F - Effluent sand filter.\r\n\r\n  ============+======+=============+=============+==============\r\n              | Raw  |Filter No. 1.|Filter No. 2.|Filter No. 3.\r\n      Date.   |water.|------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n              |      |  A   |  B   |  C   |  D   |  E   |  F\r\n  ------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n  January 12th|   40 |   10 |    1 |   12 |    1 |    2 |    0\r\n  January 13th|  110 |   45 |    2 |   51 |    2 |    2 |    0\r\n  January 14th|  210 |   95 |    3 |  113 |    4 |    2 |    0\r\n  January 15th|  325 |  190 |   12 |  222 |   15 |    3 |    0\r\n  January 16th|  360 |  210 |   37 |  247 |   42 |    5 |    0\r\n  January 17th|  242 |  122 |   24 |  147 |   26 |    6 |    0\r\n  January 18th|  137 |  ... |  ... |   73 |    7 |    6 |    0\r\n  January 19th|  117 |   40 |   12 |clean-|  ... |    5 |    0\r\n              |      |      |      | ing  |      |      |\r\n  January 20th|   72 |   31 |    6 | sand |  ... |clean-|    0\r\n              |      |      |      |filter|      | ing  |\r\n  January 21st|  55  |   20 |    4 |   25 |    4 | sand |  ...\r\n  January 22d |  49  |   17 |    3 |   21 |    4 |filter|  ...\r\n  January 23d |  40  |   12 |    3 |   15 |    3 |    3 |    0\r\n  January 24th|  40  |   11 |    3 |   13 |    3 |    3 |    0\r\n  ============+======+======+======+======+======+======+=======\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that this system was not in operation in January,\r\n1908, when the water was cold and turbid. The results, however,\r\nindicate that it would be no more successful than either Filter\r\nPlant No. 1 or No. 2.\r\n\r\n_Experimental Rate Studies._--In September, 1908, an experimental\r\nplant consisting of six small filters was put in operation. The\r\nobject of these experiments was to study the relative efficiencies\r\nand cost for the operation of slow sand filters when operated at\r\ndifferent rates.\r\n\r\nThe units of the plant consisted of cylindrical galvanized-iron\r\ntanks 4 ft. in diameter and 9 ft. high. The filter sand in these\r\ntanks was taken from the supply for the main filters. It was\r\nsupported on gravel layers and supplied with under-drains of\r\nsuitable sizes for the proposed rate of flow in each case.\r\n\r\nThe units of the experimental plant were designated as Nos. 1, 2, 3,\r\n4, 5, and 6, and it was the original intention to operate them at\r\nrates of 1,000,000, 3,000,000, 6,000,000, 10,000,000, 30,000,000,\r\nand 100,000,000 gal. per acre daily, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis schedule of rates was carried out in a general way with all the\r\nfilters, with the exception of Nos. 5 and 6. For these, the rates\r\nwere found to be higher than could be maintained for any great\r\nlength of time, owing to the deeper penetration of the mud in the\r\nfilter sand, which caused high initial losses of head, short runs,\r\nand deep scrapings. A rate of about 30,000,000 gal. was maintained\r\nin the case of Filter No. 5 from the time it was started on\r\nSeptember 9th, 1908, until November 8th, 1909, when it was reduced\r\nto about 17,000,000 gal., which rate was maintained thereafter until\r\nthe filter was shut down in February, 1910.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 7--Plan of Filter-House and Equipment.~]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Filter No. 6, it was found impossible to maintain a\r\nrate of 100,000,000 gal. for more than a very few days at a time. It\r\nwas started at about this rate, however, at the beginning of each\r\nrun, and kept as high as possible for the remainder of the time\r\nduring the first seven runs. At the end of the seventh run, on\r\nOctober 17th, 1908, the filter was given a very deep scraping and\r\nre-sanded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 8--Diagrammatic Sketch Showing Arrangements for\r\nTesting \"Puech\" System of Water Filtration at Washington D. C.,\r\nU. S. A.~]\r\n\r\nThe layer of clean sand restored the original capacity, and the\r\nfilter was operated as before, but with gradually decreasing rates\r\nuntil December, 1908, when the rate was reduced to about 40,000,000\r\ngal. Even this lower rate was too high to be maintained without\r\nremoving and replacing a large part of the sand. The rates,\r\ntherefore, gradually decreased to about 23,000,000 gal. on March\r\n13th, 1909, when the filter was again re-sanded. After this\r\nre-sanding the rate was reduced to about 20,000,000 gal., and the\r\nfilter was operated at approximately that rate until it was again\r\nre-sanded on November 13th, 1909, when the rate was again reduced to\r\nabout 14,000,000 gal., which was maintained until the filter was put\r\nout of service on February 28th, 1910.\r\n\r\nThis experimental plant was in service from September, 1908, to the\r\nlatter part of February, 1910, or for about 1-1/2 years, and the\r\nleading results are summarized in Table 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ~Table 17--Record of Experimental Filter Plant No.

Am. Soc. C. E.~ (by letter).--This paper contains a\r\nmost interesting and instructive record of the actual operation of a\r\nlarge filter plant, and also a record of a number of experiments.\r\nThe author has described some useful arrangements for improving the\r\nefficiency or reducing the cost.\r\n\r\nThe utility of raking, as an intermediate treatment between\r\nscrapings, seems to have been clearly demonstrated. Its practical\r\neffect is to allow a greater quantity of water to be passed between\r\nscrapings, thereby saturating--if the term may be used--the surface\r\nlayer with clay and other fine matter before removing it, instead of\r\ntaking it off when only a thin surface layer of it has been thus\r\nsaturated.\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of the total purification that takes place in\r\npassing through three reservoirs successively, holding in the\r\naggregate a quantity of water equal to about 7 days' use, is very\r\nstriking. Taking all the records, the percentage remaining after\r\npassing through these reservoirs, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Sediment for the year, 1909-1910, Table 2....................17%\r\n    Turbidities, 5-year average, Table 3.........................25%\r\n    Bacteria, 5-year average, Table 4............................24%\r\n    Bacteria, selected winter months with high\r\n      numbers in the raw water...................................20%\r\n    Bacteria, selected summer months with high\r\n      numbers in the raw water................................... 2.5%\r\n\r\nThere is considerable seasonal fluctuation in the results of\r\nsettling and filtering, as is shown in Table 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ~Table 21--Average Removal of Turbidity and Bacteria by\r\n       Washington Filters for Whole Period, Arranged by Seasons~.\r\n  ===========================+========+========+========+========+========\r\n                             | Winter.| Spring.| Summer.|  Fall. |  Year.\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Turbidity, in   | raw      |    135 |     96 |    144 |    42  |    105\r\n  parts per       | settled  |     33 |     28 |     27 |    15  |     26\r\n  million:        | filtered |      4 |      3 |      1 |   0.5  |      2\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Percentage      | settling |     24 |     29 |     19 |    36  |     25\r\n  left from:      | filtering|     12 |     10 |      4 |     3  |      8\r\n                  | both     |      3 |      1 |    0.3 |     1  |      2\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Bacteria per    | raw      | 16,600 |  4,150 |  4,100 | 1,960  |  6,700\r\n  cubic           | settled  |  6,300 |    980 |    160 |   270  |  1,940\r\n  centimeter:     | filtered |    149 |     29 |     18 |    22  |     54\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Percentage      | settling |  38    |  24    |   4    | 14     |  29\r\n  left from:      | filtering|   2.4  |   3.0  |  11.2  |  8.2   |   2.8\r\n                  | both     |   0.90 |   0.79 |   0.44 |  1.12  |   0.81\r\n  ================+==========+========+========+========+========+========\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fluctuation in the efficiency of the plant as a whole by seasons\r\nis greater with the turbidity than with the bacteria. During the\r\nwinter the effluent contains 3% of the turbidity of the raw water,\r\nand in summer only 0.3 per cent. Most of this difference is\r\nrepresented by the increased efficiency of the filters in summer,\r\nand only a little of it by the increased efficiency of settling.\r\nWith bacteria, on the other hand, the seasonal fluctuation of the\r\nplant as a whole is comparatively small, but the settling and\r\nstorage processes are much more efficient in summer than in winter,\r\nthe filters being apparently less efficient. The writer believes\r\nthat they are only apparently less efficient, and not really so, the\r\nexplanation being that some bacteria always grow in the under-drains\r\nand lower parts of the filter, and are washed away by the effluent.\r\nThe average number of bacteria in summer in the settled water is 160\r\nper cu. cm. and in the filtered water 18. These are very low\r\nnumbers. It is the writer's view that nearly all of these 18\r\nrepresent under-drain bacteria, and practically bear no relation to\r\nthose in the applied water, and, if this view is correct, the number\r\nof bacteria actually passing through the various processes is at all\r\ntimes less than the figures indicate. In the warmer part of the year\r\nthe difference is a wide one, and the hygienic efficiency of the\r\nprocess is much greater than is indicated by the gross numbers of\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the typhoid death rate has not been as great with\r\nthe change in water supply as was the case at Lawrence, Albany, and\r\nother cities, apparently because the Potomac water before it was\r\nfiltered was not the cause of a large part of the typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe sewage pollution of the Potomac is much less than that of the\r\nMerrimac and the Hudson, and it is perhaps not surprising that this\r\nrelatively small amount of pollution was less potent in causing\r\ntyphoid fever than the greater pollution of rivers draining more\r\ndensely populated areas.\r\n\r\nThe method of replacing the washed sand hydraulically seems to have\r\nworked better than could have been reasonably anticipated, and the\r\nwriter believes that this was due, in part, to the excellent method\r\nof manipulation described in the paper. It is his feeling, however,\r\nthat part of the success is attributable to the very low uniformity\r\ncoefficient of the sand. In other words, the sand grains are nearly\r\nall of the same size, due to the character of the stock from which\r\nthe filter sand was prepared; and, therefore, there is much less\r\nopportunity for separation of the sand according to grain sizes than\r\nthere would be with the filter sand which has been available in most\r\nother cases. Filter sand with a uniformity coefficient as low as\r\nthat obtained at Washington has been rarely available for the\r\nconstruction of sand filters, and while the method of hydraulic\r\nreturn should certainly be considered, it will not be safe to assume\r\nthat equally favorable results may be obtained with it with sands of\r\nhigh uniformity coefficients until actual favorable experience is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that in calculating the cost of the water used\r\nin the plant itself the price chosen by the author, covering only\r\nthe actual operating expenses of pumping and filtering, is too low.\r\nThe capacity of the whole Washington Aqueduct system is reduced by\r\nwhatever quantity is used in this way, and, in calculating the cost\r\nof sand handling, the value of the water used should be calculated\r\non a basis which will cover the whole cost of the water, including\r\nall capital charges, depreciation, operating expenses, and all costs\r\nof every description. On this basis the water used in the\r\nsand-handling operations would probably be worth five or more times\r\nthe sum mentioned by the author.\r\n\r\nThe cost of operation of the plant has come within the estimates\r\nmade in advance, and has certainly been most reasonable. The cost of\r\nfilter operations has averaged only about 50 cents per million\r\ngallons, and is so low that it is obvious that the savings which may\r\nbe made by introducing further labor-saving appliances would be\r\nrelatively small. It will be remembered that ten or fifteen years\r\nago the cost of operating such filters under American conditions was\r\ncommonly from $2 to $5 per million gallons.\r\n\r\nThe experiments represented by Tables 17 to 19, inclusive, serve to\r\nshow that preliminary filtration, or multiple filtration, or any\r\nsystem of mechanical separation is incapable of entirely removing\r\nthe finer clay particles which cause the residual turbidity in the\r\neffluent. They also show that this turbidity may be easily and\r\ncertainly removed by the application of coagulant to the raw water\r\nduring the occasional periods when its character is such as to\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nThese general propositions were understood by those responsible for\r\nthe original design of the plant, as is shown by the author's\r\nquotations. These experiments, however, were necessary in order to\r\ndemonstrate and bring home the conditions to those who thought\r\ndifferently, and who believed that full purification could be\r\nobtained by filtration alone, or by double filtration, without\r\nrecourse to the occasional use of coagulant.\r\n\r\nThe experiments briefly summarized in Table 20 are of the greatest\r\ninterest and importance. Six small filters, otherwise alike and like\r\nthe large filters, all received the same raw water and were operated\r\nat different rates to determine the effect of rate on efficiency.\r\n\r\nThat the experimental results from the filter operating at the same\r\nrate as the large filters were on the whole somewhat inferior to\r\nthose from the large filters for approximately the same period, may\r\nbe attributed to the fact that the experimental filter was new while\r\nthe large filters had been in service for some time and had thereby\r\ngained in efficiency. The greatest difference was in the _coli_\r\nresults in Table 20, where it is shown that 24% of the 10-cu. cm.\r\neffluent samples from the experimental filter contained _coli_, in\r\ncomparison with only from 1 to 3% of such samples from the main\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\nThe results from the experimental filter operating at a rate of\r\n1,000,000 gal. per acre daily may fairly be excluded, as the\r\neffluent probably contained more under-drain bacteria in proportion\r\nthan filters operated at higher rates. The number of bacteria in the\r\nfilter operating at a 3,000,000-gal. rate were 1.7% of those in the\r\napplied water; for the filter operating twice as fast, the\r\npercentage was 2.4; and, for the one operating more than ten times\r\nas fast, was only 3.0; thus indicating a surprisingly small increase\r\nin the number of bacteria with increase in rate.\r\n\r\nFurther and more detailed study by the writer of the unpublished\r\nindividual results, briefly summarized in Table 20, confirms the\r\nsubstantial accuracy of the comparison based on the average figures\r\nas stated in that table.\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind, in considering these results, that the\r\nnumber of bacteria in each case is made up of two parts, namely,\r\nthose coming through the filter--which number is presumably greater\r\nas the rate is greater--and, second, those coming from harmless\r\ngrowths in the under-drains and lower parts of the filter--the\r\nnumbers of which per cubic centimeter are presumably less as the\r\nrate is greater--and these two parts, varying in opposite\r\ndirections, may balance each other, as they seem to do in this case,\r\nthrough a considerable range. It may thus be that the number of\r\nbacteria really passing the filter varies much more with the rate\r\nthan is indicated by the gross results.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to note that the sand filter (called a\r\npreliminary filter) in Table 18, filled with the same kind of sand,\r\nwhen operated at an average rate of 50,000,000 gal. per acre daily\r\nfor a year, allowed 18% of the applied bacteria to pass, in\r\ncomparison with 3% found in Filter No. 6 of Table 20, operated at an\r\naverage rate of 38,000,000 gal. per acre daily.\r\n\r\nThere was one point of difference in the manipulation: the\r\npreliminary filter was washed by a reversed current of water, as\r\nmechanical filters are washed, while Filter No. 6 was cleaned by\r\nscraping off the surface layer, as is usual with sand filters.\r\nWhether the great difference in bacterial results with a relatively\r\nsmall difference in rate is to be attributed to this difference in\r\nmanipulation the writer will not undertake to state.\r\n\r\nIf the experimental results of Table 20 indicate correctly the\r\nconditions which obtain in filtering Potomac water, then increasing\r\nthe rate of filtration so as to double it, or more than double it,\r\nwould make but little difference in the quality of the effluent as\r\nmeasured by the usual bacterial methods. If the increase in rate\r\nwere accompanied by the preliminary filtration of the water, then,\r\npresumably, there would be little change in the quality of the\r\neffluent, and the maintenance of excellent results might be\r\nincorrectly attributed to the influence of the preliminary filter.\r\n\r\nIt would also seem that the apparatus which is sometimes used for\r\ndetermining and controlling the rate with more than the ordinary\r\ndegree of precision is hardly justified by such experimental results\r\nas those presented by the author.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these results may be mentioned those obtained by Mr.\r\nH. W. Clark,[1] for experimental filters operated with Merrimac\r\nRiver water, at rates ranging from 3,000,000 to 16,000,000 gal. per\r\nacre daily. The results are the average of nearly two years of\r\nexperimental work, the period having been nearly coincident with\r\nthat covered by the author's experiments, and of many hundreds of\r\nbacterial analyses of each effluent, and form, with the author's\r\nexperiments, the most thorough-going studies of the effect of rate\r\non efficiency that have come to the writer's attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark's results are given in Table 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ~Table 22.~\r\n  ===========+============+===========+=============+===========+============\r\n             |            |           |             |           | _B.

In other words, doubling\r\nthe rate substantially doubles the number of bacteria in the\r\neffluent.\r\n\r\nThis is entirely in harmony with all the Lawrence experimental\r\nresults extending over a period of 20 years. There have been\r\noccasional apparent exceptions, but, on the whole, experience with\r\nMerrimac River water has uniformly been that more bacteria pass as\r\nthe rates are higher.\r\n\r\nThe theory sometimes advanced, that the efficiency of filtration is\r\ncontrolled to a certain extent by gelatinous films, and that, as far\r\nas thus controlled, is less dependent on rate, would not seem to be\r\nborne out by these results. The Merrimac River water, carrying large\r\namounts of organic matter, would certainly seem better adapted to\r\nthe formation of such films than the clay-bearing Potomac water,\r\ncomparatively free from organic matter; but it is the Potomac water\r\nwhich seems to show the least influence of rate on efficiency.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Journal_, New England Water-Works Association, Vol.\r\n   24, p. 589.]\r\n\r\nThe experiments show that turbidity passes more freely at the higher\r\nrates with the Potomac water, as has also been found to be the case\r\nwith other clay-bearing waters.\r\n\r\nIn the last lines of Table 20 are given cost per million gallons for\r\nfiltering at various rates. There is no discussion of these figures,\r\nand as they differ considerably from those which the writer has been\r\naccustomed to use, the calculation in Table 23, made three years ago\r\nfor a particular case, may be of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ~Table 23--Relative Cost of Filtering at Different Rates.~\r\n  ======================+===================================================\r\n                        |Nominal rate, in millions of gallons per acre daily:\r\n                        +------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n                        |      3     |     5      |     10     |    20\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Percentage which      |            |            |            |\r\n  average yield is of   |            |            |            |\r\n  nominal rate..........|     85     |     80     |     75     |      65\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Average output per    |            |            |            |\r\n  acre, in millions of  |            |            |            |\r\n  gallons per day.......|       2.55 |       4.00 |       7.5  |      13.0\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Cost of that part of  |            |            |            |\r\n  filters per acre      |            |            |            |\r\n  dependent on rate.....| $12,000    | $20,000    | $40,000    | $80,000\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Cost of that part of  |            |            |            |\r\n  filters per acre not  |            |            |            |\r\n  dependent on rate.....|  50,000    |  50,000    |  50,000    |  50,000\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Total cost of filters |            |            |            |\r\n  per acre..............|  60,000    |  70,000    |  90,000    | 130,000\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Cost per million      |            |            |            |\r\n  gallons of capacity...|  20,600    |  14,000    |   9,000    |   6,500\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Cost per million      |            |            |            |\r\n  gallons of average    |            |            |            |\r\n  daily output..........|  24,400    |  17,500    |  12,000    |  10,000\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Capital charges and   |            |            |            |\r\n  depreciation at 6% on |            |            |            |\r\n  cost per million      |            |            |            |\r\n  gallons...............|       4.00 |       2.87 |       1.97 |       1.64\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Operating expenses,   |            |            |            |\r\n  the same at all       |            |            |            |\r\n  rates.................|       1.00 |       1.00 |       1.00 |       1.00\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Total cost of         |            |            |            |\r\n  filtering, excluding  |            |            |            |\r\n  pumping, storage, and |            |            |            |\r\n  all auxiliaries.......|       5.00 |       3.87 |       2.97 |       2.64\r\n  ----------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Relative cost.........|       1.29 |       1.00 |       0.77 |       0.68\r\n  ======================+============+============+============+============\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the costs of pumping, pure-water reservoirs usually necessary,\r\netc., are taken into account (which add equally to the cost at all\r\nrates), the cost of filtering will vary less with the rate than is\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe effect of rate on cost, as calculated in Table 23, and also the\r\npercentages of the bacteria of the raw water found in the effluents\r\nby the author and by Mr. Clark, are shown on Figure 10.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these results together, and also all the other\r\nevidence known to the writer bearing on this point, it seems clear\r\nthat filters are not as sensitive to changes in rate, within\r\nreasonable limits, as has been frequently assumed; but, on the other\r\nhand, there is usually a substantial increase in the percentage of\r\nbacteria passing through a filter with increased rate.\r\n\r\nFilters furnish relative, not absolute, protection against\r\ninfectious matter in the raw water. The higher the bacterial\r\nefficiency, the more complete is this relative protection.\r\n\r\nThe cost of filtering does not decrease in inverse ratio to the\r\nrate, but at a much slower rate. This is especially true with rates\r\nof more than 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 gal. per acre daily.\r\n\r\nIn general, a rate of filtration may rationally be selected at which\r\nthe value of the possible danger resulting from an increase in rate\r\nis equal to the saving that may be made in cost by its use. This\r\npoint must be a matter of individual judgment. The tendency of the\r\nlast few years has been to use higher rates, or, in other words, to\r\ncheapen the process and to tolerate a larger proportion of bacteria\r\nin the effluent. The use of auxiliary processes has been favorable\r\nto this, especially the use of chloride of lime, in connection with\r\neither the raw water or the effluent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 10--Rate Million Gallons Per Acre Daily.~]\r\n\r\nBy the judicious use of this substance, efficiency may be maintained\r\nwhile using higher rates than would otherwise have been desirable.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that there will be many cases where the added\r\nrisk of using too high a rate is not worth the relatively small\r\nsaving in cost that accompanies it.\r\n\r\n~George A. Johnson, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E~.--This paper contains\r\ninformation of an exceedingly interesting nature. There is\r\ncomparatively little difficulty in obtaining accurate figures on the\r\ncost of construction of water purification works, but, with costs of\r\noperation of such works, it is different. The data available in\r\npublished reports and papers are usually more or less fragmentary,\r\nand unexplained local conditions with reference to the character of\r\nthe raw water, the cost of labor and supplies, and methods of\r\napportioning these costs, introduce variables so wide as frequently\r\nto render the published figures almost useless for purposes of\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy's paper is noteworthy in that it presents certain\r\nrelatively new features of slow sand filter operation which have\r\nbeen only lightly touched on in water purification literature up to\r\nthe present time. These refer particularly to means whereby a filter\r\nmay be continued in service without removing a portion of the\r\nsurface layer of the filter surface itself when the available head\r\nhas become exhausted, and to methods whereby washed sand may be\r\nexpeditiously and more economically restored to the filter than has\r\nbeen the case hitherto.\r\n\r\nSand handling is the most important item of expense in the operation\r\nof a slow sand filter. Quite recently a charge of $1.50 per cu. yd.\r\nfor sand scraping, transportation to sand washers, washing, and\r\nrestoring to the filter, was not considered exorbitant, but the\r\nimproved methods developed during recent years at Washington,\r\nPhiladelphia, Albany, and more recently at Pittsburg (at all of\r\nwhich places hydraulic ejection plays an important part), have\r\nshown the feasibility of reducing this figure by nearly, if not\r\nquite, two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe practice observed at Washington of raking over the surface of\r\nthe sand layer when the available head becomes exhausted, in order\r\nto avoid the cost and loss of time necessitated by shutting down the\r\nfilter and scraping off the surface layer, is unquestionably one of\r\nthe most striking advances in slow sand filter operation in recent\r\nyears. In rapid sand filter operation, to prolong the period of\r\nservice between washings, agitation of the filter surface has been\r\nused to advantage for many years. The full value of surface raking\r\nmay not be generally appreciated, but the results which have\r\nfollowed a trial of this procedure at Washington, Philadelphia, and\r\nPittsburg have shown that the output of filtered water between\r\nscrapings may be doubled or trebled thereby, with no injury to the\r\nfilter itself or to the quality of the filtered water. The cost of\r\nraking over the surface of a 1-acre slow sand filter unit is less\r\nthan $10 at all the above-mentioned places, which fact in itself\r\nshows the great saving in money and time effected by periodically\r\nsubstituting surface raking for scraping. Under ordinary conditions\r\nit has been found that a filter can be raked to advantage at least\r\ntwice between scrapings.\r\n\r\nIn the case of filters thus raked, a deeper penetration of suspended\r\nmatter into the sand layer is inevitable, but at Pittsburg, as at\r\nWashington, such penetration does not extend more than about 2 in.\r\nbelow the filter surface. When the filter is finally scraped, a\r\ndeeper layer is removed, of course, but it is clearly more\r\neconomical to remove a deep layer at one operation than to remove\r\nseparately several thinner layers of an equal total thickness.\r\n\r\nThe lost-time element is an important one, and at Washington this\r\nwas the main reason for trying surface raking. It became necessary\r\nto increase the output of the filters, and the ordinary scraping\r\nconsumed so much time that the sand-handling force was increased,\r\nworking day and night. The raking expedient introduced at this time\r\novercame this, and Mr. Hardy states that it is still followed when\r\nthe work is at all pressing. The speaker has found at Pittsburg, as\r\nMr. Hardy has found at Washington, that raking is nearly if not\r\nquite as effective as scraping in restoring the filter capacity.\r\n\r\nEleven years ago the speaker was connected with the preliminary\r\ninvestigations into the best methods of purifying the Potomac River\r\nwater for Washington. It then appeared that while for the greater\r\npart of the time during an average year the Potomac River could be\r\nclassed among the clear waters of the East, there were periods when\r\nexcessive turbidity made it necessary to consider carefully methods\r\nof preparatory treatment before this water could be filtered\r\neffectively and economically. As Mr. Hardy has said, considerable\r\nprejudice existed against the use of a coagulating chemical, and the\r\nexpedient was therefore adopted of giving the water a long period of\r\nsedimentation in order to remove enough of the suspended matter to\r\nallow the clarified water to be treated on slow sand filters. The\r\nexpert commission, consisting of Messrs. Hering, Fuller, and Hazen,\r\nrecommended the occasional use of a coagulating chemical, but this\r\nrecommendation was not carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Potomac River is somewhat peculiar, in that the turbidity of its\r\nwaters, as shown by the results presented in Mr. Hardy's paper,\r\nranges from 3,000 to practically nothing. The bacterial content also\r\nvaries widely, and Mr. Hardy's tables show this variation to be from\r\n76,000 to 325 per cu. cm. Such a water as this requires particularly\r\ncareful preparatory treatment. The Dalecarlia Reservoir has a\r\ncapacity of something like 2 days' storage, the Georgetown Reservoir\r\nthe same, and the McMillan Park Reservoir nearly 3 days, making a\r\ntotal sedimentation of more than 7 days. Without the use of a\r\ncoagulant, it is significant that during a period of five years,\r\neven with 7 days' sedimentation, the average maximum turbidity of\r\nthe water delivered to the filters was 106 parts per million, and\r\nthe maximum average turbidity in one month was 250 parts per\r\nmillion. The water filtration engineer can readily understand that\r\nwaters as turbid as this cannot be treated economically and\r\nefficiently in slow sand filters. It would appear that coagulating\r\nworks might advantageously have been installed at the entrance to\r\nthe Dalecarlia Reservoir. If this had been done, and coagulant had\r\nbeen added to the water at times when it was excessively turbid, a\r\nconsiderably shorter period of subsequent sedimentation than now\r\nexists would in all probability have rendered the water at all times\r\namenable to efficient and economical slow sand filter treatment.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice in Washington against the use of coagulants has also\r\nmanifested itself in other localities, but the results which have\r\nbeen obtained during the past twenty years from rapid sand filters\r\nand from slow sand filters, treating waters previously coagulated\r\nwith salts of iron or alumina, have shown how thoroughly\r\nunreasonable were these objections. In this connection it is\r\ninteresting to note that there are in the United States more than\r\n350 rapid sand filter plants, and that nearly 12% of the urban\r\npopulation of Continental United States is being supplied with water\r\nfiltered through rapid sand filters, in connection with all of which\r\na coagulating chemical is used in the preparatory treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~Table 24--Typhoid Fever Death Rates in Cities of the United\r\n         States with Populations in 1910 of 100,000, or More.~\r\n\r\n     Statistics gathered by correspondence and from Reports of\r\n     the Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce and Labor,\r\n                        Mortality Statistics.\r\n\r\n~Note~.--Statistics from Birmingham, Ala., Dayton, Ohio, Fall River,\r\n         Mass., Louisville, Ky., Memphis, Tenn., Oakland, Cal., and\r\n         Providence, R.

Allegheny District not\r\n   included.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention has repeatedly been called to the fact that the relatively\r\nhigh typhoid death rate in Washington, since the filter plant was\r\ninstalled, was a possible indication that the filters were\r\ninefficient. It is true that there has not been the marked reduction\r\nin the typhoid death rate in Washington, following the installation\r\nof the water filtration works, that has been observed in other\r\ncities in America. For the six years prior to the date on which\r\nfiltered water was supplied to the citizens of Washington, the\r\naverage typhoid fever death rate was 59 per 100,000 population, as\r\nagainst 37 per 100,000 for the five years following, a reduction of\r\n37 per cent. At Albany, N. Y., where the first modern slow sand\r\nfilter was built in 1899, the typhoid death rate has been reduced by\r\n75 per cent. At Cincinnati, Ohio, the average death rate from\r\ntyphoid ranged around 50 per 100,000 for years, but since the\r\ninstallation of the filtration plant it has been reduced to a point\r\nwhich places that city, with respect to freedom from typhoid fever,\r\nat the head of all the large cities in America; in 1910 the death\r\nrate from typhoid in Cincinnati was 6 per 100,000. Similarly, at\r\nColumbus, Ohio, where the typhoid death rate before the installation\r\nof the filtration plant in 1906 was even higher than at Cincinnati,\r\nit was reduced to less than 13 per 100,000 in 1910, whereas, for the\r\nprevious five years, it was 61 per 100,000. Philadelphia, before the\r\ninstallation of the filtration works, had a typhoid death rate of 60\r\nor more per 100,000, and in 1910 the death rate from this disease\r\nwas 17. Pittsburg, at least that part of it now supplied with\r\nfiltered water, for years had a typhoid death rate of more than 130\r\nper 100,000, but the present rate is about 12 per 100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ~Table 25--Average Monthly Results for the\r\n                Period, 1905-1910.~\r\n\r\n  Columns:\r\n    A - Period of sedimentation in days.\r\n    B - Turbidity in parts per million.\r\n    C - Bacteria per cubic centimeter.\r\n  ============+=====+=====+=======+=====================\r\n              |     |     |       |~Percentage Removed~\r\n   Reservoirs.|  A  |  B  |   C   |----------+----------\r\n              |     |     |       | Turbidity| Bacteria\r\n  ------------+-----+-----+-------+----------+----------\r\n  River       | ... | 106 | 6,400 |   ...    |   ...\r\n  Dalecarlia  | 2.2 |  50 | 5,000 |    53    |    22\r\n  Georgetown  | 2.2 |  38 | 3,400 |    24    |    32\r\n  McMillan    | 2.8 |  26 | 2,000 |    31    |    41\r\n  ------------+-----+-----+-------+----------+----------\r\n  Totals and  |     |     |       |          |\r\n  averages    | 7.2 | ... |  ...  |    75    |    69\r\n  ============+=====+=====+=======+==========+==========\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it may perhaps seem unreasonable to single out Washington as a\r\nparticular sufferer in this respect, it is highly probable that a\r\nlarge share of the typhoid is still caused by secondary infection,\r\nflies, impure milk, and private and public wells. The speaker\r\nremembers distinctly that ten years ago, when he made an\r\ninvestigation into the purity of the water of about 100 public wells\r\nin that city, a large number of them showed unmistakable evidence of\r\nbeing polluted with sewagic matter. Conclusive evidence would be\r\nsecured to dispel any doubt as to the sanitary quality of the\r\nfiltered product if hypochlorite of lime were added to the filtered\r\nwater throughout one year or throughout the typhoid months. It seems\r\nstrange to the speaker, that for this, if for no other reason, this\r\nsafe and non-injurious germicide has not as yet been used at\r\nWashington, in view of the fact that at the present time it is being\r\nused continuously or intermittently in the treatment of the water\r\nsupplies of scores of the most important cities of this country,\r\namong which may be mentioned New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati,\r\nPittsburg, St. Louis, and Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n~Morris Knowles, M. Am. Soc. C. E~. (by letter).--This description\r\nof the operation of the Washington Filtration Works is timely and of\r\ngreat interest. It is ten years since the writer, in collaboration\r\nwith Charles Gilman Hyde, M. ~Am. Soc~. C. E., presented a similar\r\nrecord for the Lawrence, Mass., filter. That paper was the first\r\ncomplete, detailed, and continuous history of the actions and\r\nresults obtained for a long period of time with such a purification\r\nworks.[1] Since then, the art of filtration has advanced in many\r\nways, particularly in regard to the methods of cleaning slow sand\r\nfilters and in the accompanying processes. It is well, therefore,\r\nagain to take account of stock and see really what progress has been\r\nmade. Therefore, Mr. Hardy's paper, giving a description of the\r\noperations of a system thoughtfully designed, after long\r\nconsideration of the problem, and of operations carried on under\r\nefficient and economical administration, with thorough record of all\r\ndetails, should furnish a groundwork for the careful consideration\r\nof the question stated above.\r\n\r\nThe writer, using as a text some of the ideas given in the paper,\r\nbut more particularly some of those becoming prevalent elsewhere,\r\ndesires to discuss methods and costs of operation, especially in\r\nrelation to sand handling; and to offer suggestions looking toward\r\ngreater efficiency, as well as economy, in carrying out the standard\r\nand well-tried methods.\r\n\r\n_Theory of Slow Sand Filtration._--First, what is the process of slow\r\nsand filtration? The answer to this question involves many factors, some\r\nof which are even yet but imperfectly understood. In the early history\r\nof filtration, at the time of the construction of the London filters,\r\nonly the straining capacity of the sand bed, to remove gross particles,\r\nwas known. Later, when the organic contents of water had become better\r\nunderstood, the chemical or oxidizing powers of the process were\r\nrecognized as performing an important part. Finally, co-existent with\r\nthe discovery of the so-called \"germ theory of disease,\" a study of the\r\nbacterial action of filters resulted in the recognition of its\r\nimportance. It is now universally thought that each of these factors\r\nperforms its useful function; that the size of the sand, the amount of\r\norganic matter remaining on the surface of the bed, the turbidity of the\r\napplied water, and the bacterial content of the influent, are some of\r\nthe things on which depends the determination of the relative importance\r\nof each.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Transactions_, Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. XLVI, p. 258.]\r\n\r\nEngineers have been taught to believe, by the German school of\r\nthought, that the film of organic matter on the surface of the sand\r\nplays a very important role in filtration. This _Schmutzdecke_, as\r\nit is called, has been considered so precious that stress has been\r\nplaced on treating it with great care. It was not to be wholly\r\nremoved at the time of cleaning, and it was not to be walked on, or\r\nindented, or in any other way consolidated or destroyed. In fact, in\r\nsome cases, the wasting of the first water after cleaning has been\r\nadvocated, for the reason that not a sufficient amount of this\r\norganic film would be left on top of the sand to begin the\r\nfiltration process properly immediately after the cleaning.\r\n\r\nIn late years, however, there has been a tendency to depart from\r\nthis fundamental doctrine of slow sand filtration. Various new\r\nprocesses for cleaning the sand surface have been advocated; some of\r\nthese partly destroy and others completely exterminate any semblance\r\nof a bacterial film on the sand bed. These ideas, advanced without\r\nany real and serious discussion of their intrinsic merits, or their\r\neffects on the public health, are not founded on long continuous\r\nrecords of such results as are necessary to establish confidence in\r\nthe final value of any of these methods.\r\n\r\nRapid advances along this line have been made more recently,\r\nnotwithstanding the occurrence of notable instances of trouble and\r\nthe resultant need of complete repair of filtration beds. Because of\r\nthe rough treatment of the sand surface, a penetration of organic\r\nmatter and filth into the bed had taken place. This caused deep\r\nclogging, prevented the usual yield of water, and brought about a\r\nlessened bacterial efficiency, due to the attempt to force water\r\nthrough the filters, and because some organic matter and growths in\r\nthe lower part of the bed had furnished a breeding place for more\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nAll these endeavors to reduce the work of cleaning have been\r\ncommendable, because scraping and sand handling are the items of\r\ngreatest expense in slow sand filter maintenance. Every one has been\r\ndesirous of minimizing this cost. However, as the writer will\r\nendeavor to show, it seems that attempts along this line should be\r\nwith the idea of doing more economically, as well as efficiently,\r\nthe things which one knows will accomplish the proper results,\r\nrather than unwisely to adopt new methods which have not been tried\r\nfor a long enough period to determine their effect on the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n_Pittsburg Methods._--When first taking up the problem of design in\r\nPittsburg, in 1902, the writer had presented to him for\r\nconsideration and adoption, a suggestion that a certain method of\r\ncleaning sand filters, which would involve the washing of the sand\r\nin place (similar to that recently tried at the Jerome Park\r\nExperiment Station, New York City), would be advisable and\r\neconomical. The decision then made has never been regretted. As this\r\nplan involved such a complete departure from those principles which\r\nhad been well tried and had proven successful, it was believed that\r\nit was not safe to adopt such a method on the municipal filtration\r\nworks, from which the people were to derive their drinking water.\r\nThere is more to be considered in such a problem than mere economy\r\nof operation; the economy of human life, the effect on which\r\nrequires far longer than a few months of trial to determine, is a\r\nmuch more important factor. Believing that no one should depart,\r\nuntil after a long period of conclusive experimentation, from that\r\nprinciple which is known to be safe (viz., to take off a small\r\nportion of the clogging surface), the writer studied to determine\r\nmore efficient and economical methods of accomplishing this end.\r\n\r\nA device for scraping the material, in just the same way as with\r\nshovels, but more efficiently and more exactly, was developed by\r\nGeorge P. Baldwin, M. Am. Soc. C. E., under the general supervision\r\nof the Bureau of Filtration, of which the writer was in charge.\r\nHowever, on account of the unfortunate and earlier arrangement of\r\nother constructive matters, which the City's Legal Department\r\nadvised could not be changed without upsetting the contract, the\r\nentrance doors to the original forty-six filters were not built\r\nlarge enough to permit the rapid and economical transfer of these\r\nmachines, and, as this act takes so large a proportion of the total\r\ntime of operation, it has not been found economical to use them. The\r\nadditional ten filters, recently constructed, with doors especially\r\ndesigned and large enough to pass the machines, have not yet been\r\nplaced in operation. This is said to be on account of lack of funds\r\nand of employees. Therefore, there has been no opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate what the scraping machines can do, under the conditions\r\nfor which they were designed to operate. The restoring machine, a\r\ncomplementary device in mechanical operation, which simply replaces\r\nthe sand in the same condition that it would be if wheeled back,\r\nbut, with a small percentage of moisture, has accomplished its\r\npurpose well and economically. The sand is placed in the filters so\r\nthat there is no further settling; with a smooth surface, needing no\r\nadditional adjustment; with absolutely no possibility of sub-surface\r\nclogging; and with the filters starting off exceedingly well in\r\noperative results.\r\n\r\n_Washington Methods._--In Washington, it is stated that the filters\r\nare still cleaned by the old-fashioned method of scraping with\r\nshovels, throwing the sand into piles, and afterward removing it\r\nwith a movable ejector. Between scrapings there is also an\r\noccasional mid-period action of raking the unwatered sand surface,\r\nfor the purpose of stirring up the dirty film. This process does not\r\nremove any of the clogging material from the bed, but it is said\r\nthat no injurious effects are produced, and that it is economical.\r\nIt is stated that the so-called \"Brooklyn method,\" of stirring the\r\nsurface of the sand while the water is on the bed, has been tried at\r\nWashington, but with unsatisfactory results. It seems to have been\r\nadvocated with greater fervor in some other places.\r\n\r\nThe method of dry raking does not remove the dirty material, but\r\nloosens up the pores of the surface, and through this porosity\r\npermits clogging to penetrate deeper into the filter. The method of\r\nraking with water on the bed, although it removes some of the\r\norganic dirt, also permits deeper penetration of the remainder. The\r\nlatest devised system of washing the sand in place, by upward\r\nspraying with water, called the \"Blaisdell method,\" thoroughly\r\ndestroys the _Schmutzdecke_ above, and, at the same time, must\r\npermit the formation of a subsidiary one below. In the Nichols\r\nmethod, the material removed by shovel scraping is conveyed by an\r\nejector to a portable separator, where it receives a single washing;\r\nthe dirty water overflows to the sewer, while the washed sand is\r\ndischarged through a hose and deposited on the recently scraped\r\nsurface. As the latter is partly impregnated with impurities, there\r\nis, by this process, a tendency toward sub-surface clogging.\r\n\r\nAll these processes are marked and serious departures from the\r\nwell-tried method of cleaning slow sand filters, which, it is well\r\nknown, will operate successfully to purify polluted river waters and\r\nmake them safe to drink. In all there is the danger that they have\r\nnot been sufficiently and carefully tried, under scientific\r\nobservation, as to results and possible effects on the public\r\nhealth, to be sure that the bacterial efficiency can long continue\r\nto be satisfactory, with the application of specifically infected\r\nwaters. It is dangerous, and may even jeopardize the safety of human\r\nlives, to experiment on water which is furnished for drinking\r\npurposes. There is also the added danger, well known from past\r\nexperience, that in a few years (it may be more or less, depending\r\non the extent and intensity of the new workings) the filters will\r\nneed renovation, partly, if not wholly, throughout the entire bed.\r\nThus, considering the total cost during a long term of years, the\r\napparently cheaper method may become the most expensive.\r\n\r\nThere is also an interesting query in regard to the Washington\r\nmethod of replacing sand in the filters, and it is worthy of most\r\ncareful thought and attention. If the process described can be\r\ncarried on with success and safety, it will prove to be a long and\r\nprogressive step in the methods of operation. The difficulty,\r\nhowever, is in determining from any short-term runs whether such a\r\nprocess can be continued permanently without impairing the\r\nefficiency of the sand bed. Apparently good conditions may change,\r\nafter a few years' trial, and be followed by unsafe results and\r\npredicaments. This replacing of sand with whatever dirt and detritus\r\nmay travel with it in the carrying water is certainly not equivalent\r\nto the care with which it has been understood that sand should be\r\ndeposited in filters. It is not comparable with the care with which\r\nit is placed, when wheeled from a washer, where dirty water\r\noverflows the lip, or where it is placed by a machine restorer in\r\nthe filter, where the transporting water also overflows the weir and\r\nis carried to the sewer.\r\n\r\nThese cheap and rapid methods of doing the work, advanced in the\r\ninterests of economy, and the idea that sand filters, receiving\r\npolluting waters, can operate at higher rates than those which we\r\nhave demonstrated, and, therefore, have been led to believe are\r\nsafe, is a speeding up of the whole organization and of operating\r\nconditions. It is like speeding up a machine for the purpose of\r\ngetting a greater output, with the usual result that fast running\r\nmeans quicker wearing out of both man and machine. Quicker\r\noperations generally mean carelessness in doing the work, especially\r\nin municipal service. Carelessness is engendered by the thought that\r\nsuch work can be handled in a rough and rapid way, and, further, by\r\nthe ridicule of all these things, which we have learned to be\r\ncareful about, as old-fogyish, out-of-fashion, and archaic.\r\nCarelessness in operation breeds contempt for the art. Some of the\r\nless efficient filter plants, from the standpoint of effect on the\r\npublic health, may reflect such ill-considered methods\r\n\r\n_Economy with Efficiency in Operation._--It is particularly important to\r\nfind out whether one can secure the desired economy, and, at the same\r\ntime, the required efficiency. The development of efficiency in every\r\nline of human endeavor is receiving much attention at present, and not\r\nthe least cause for this is the growing recognition of the demand for a\r\nhigh standard of service for the expense caused. One of the first\r\nrequirements is to have well-defined ideals and standards. When one\r\nknows how to secure a good and safe result, it is unwise to depart\r\ntherefrom for a mere whim, or to secure a supposedly lessened expense,\r\nunless other facts be also determined favorably. The desire for economy\r\nmust be tempered by good sense, which means that one should be willing\r\nto change a method only when the wisdom of such has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated. Efficient service can only be secured by strict\r\ndiscipline, accompanied by fair dealing. This means employing no more\r\nmen than are actually necessary, paying them on the basis of the\r\nstandard of service and output produced, taking an interest in the\r\nworking conditions, and providing for their health and welfare.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve years ago, the writer made some investigations of the\r\nefficiency of laboring gangs in scraping and handling sand at filter\r\nbeds,[1] and found that ten men was the most economical number to\r\nuse in scraping the surface of the Lawrence filter, as then built\r\nand operated. This result was determined by numerous studies of the\r\noutput per man per minute, with different numbers of men working\r\nunder different conditions. This same sort of study has been carried\r\nfurther by adepts in the art, in reference to shop and similar\r\nmanagement, but one fails to find corresponding development along\r\nthis line in municipal organization except by a few of the scattered\r\nBureaus of Municipal Research. These results, also, have related to\r\na few of the more common and general factors, such as determining\r\nthe cost per mile, or per square yard, of street cleaned, or per\r\nmillion gallons of water pumped.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Transactions,_ Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. XLVI, p. 291.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of the management of water-works, one of the largest\r\nfactors of public enterprise, has never been investigated\r\nextensively and thoroughly. There is much possibility in planning\r\nfor greater efficiency and in determining what can be accomplished\r\nunder economical administration. Every one is aware of the\r\nmultiplicity of men in municipal service. Some of these are entirely\r\nincompetent, others partly so; the recent appointees may be more\r\nefficient, but the majority of them gradually deteriorate under the\r\nsubtle influence of the prevailing atmosphere, and each new incoming\r\nadministration places more and more men on the work, without reason\r\nor necessity. All these tendencies have made the cost and\r\nmaintenance of public work greater and greater, and, at the same\r\ntime, have resulted in frequently and steadily decreasing the output\r\nand efficiency per employee.\r\n\r\nThe Washington situation, however, presents an admirable contrast to\r\nthis, because of the methods of administration of the public works\r\nof the District of Columbia and their freedom from petty political\r\ninfluence. The limited number of employees has tended toward\r\neconomy, and rendered this plant the envy of all who have desired to\r\nobtain good management. Its cost items have been looked on as a\r\nresult long hoped for, but seldom obtained. It is to be regretted,\r\ntherefore, that such an abrupt change in methods of removing\r\nclogging material and replacing sand has taken place without years\r\nof experimental trial on filters not furnishing drinking water to\r\nthe public, and without an attempt, under such excellent conditions,\r\nto maintain the efficiency by a better labor output and by improved\r\nworking and machine methods in the performance of the older and\r\nestablished order of doing things.\r\n\r\nIn preparing water for the use of the people, the realms of the\r\nunknown are so much larger than those which have been investigated\r\nand developed that there may be many undiscovered factors affecting\r\nthe public health, and many ways in which it is dangerous to depart\r\nfrom well-known and surely safe methods. Who can say that in some\r\nsubtle and, at present, unknown manner, the failure in some places,\r\nwhere filtration is practiced, to reduce the death rate from typhoid\r\nfever may not be due to the introduction of radical departures from\r\nthe older, slower, safer, and more efficient methods which have\r\nproduced such excellent results, both in America and in Europe?\r\nFurther, in cases where there has been a falling off in the typhoid\r\ndeath rate, the failure to secure an accompanying improvement in\r\ngeneral health conditions, which follows so closely in communities\r\nsupplied by water filtered in accordance with the more conservative\r\nprinciples, may be due to the introduction of some of these not\r\nthoroughly tried processes. Some day full information may be\r\navailable as to the influence of these methods of plant operation on\r\nthe health of the community. Until that time, is it not a much\r\nbetter policy to follow the principles which have been proven by\r\nmany years of experience to produce safe results, and to make the\r\nforemost object the improvement of the methods of operation in\r\naccordance with these established truths?\r\n\r\nThere is opportunity for the upbuilding of greater efficiency in the\r\nconduct of employees and in securing the maximum output, by\r\nestablishing more comfortable and healthful conditions than usually\r\nexist. The elimination of political influence from municipal service\r\nis also a task which challenges the people of to-day, and the\r\noperating and managing engineer is in a position to perform an\r\nimportant part in accomplishing this end. The number of employees\r\ncan be reduced to those actually needed, and the way opened for the\r\nemployment of men who thoroughly understand the necessities of\r\nhonesty and efficiency in the conduct of public affairs. It should\r\nbe remembered that to design and construct well is only half the\r\njob; to operate economically and efficiently is even more of a\r\nproblem than to build, and requires just as good talent, just as\r\nkeen appreciation of the various problems, and is even more\r\nessential to public welfare. It seems to the writer that the logical\r\ndevelopment of the art of obtaining economy as well as efficiency\r\nshould be along these lines, rather than to revolutionize methods,\r\nwithout having a long-period test of their value, and at the same\r\ntime allow political influences to control, to a large extent, the\r\nlabor item.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Treatment._--The decision as to the preliminary\r\ntreatment of the Potomac River water before filtration is of\r\ninterest, particularly because various other conclusions have been\r\nreached in different sections of the country. However, in the main,\r\nthese decisions have been due to differences in the character of the\r\nwaters, but it must be evident that they have sometimes been the\r\nresult of ill-considered action, or the desire to promote some\r\nspecial interest. The use of preliminary filters, which involves a\r\nlarge investment, is not always to be commended, particularly\r\nbecause at times of reasonably good water the removal of some of the\r\norganic matter is really injurious and lessens the effect of the\r\nfinal filters.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the writer has believed that, where other things\r\nare equal, and where there is no important reason for double or\r\npreliminary filtration, long periods of storage, accompanied by the\r\nuse of coagulant at times of severe and extreme muddiness, as\r\nplanned at Washington, solves the problem in the most practical and\r\neconomical way. It is true that the investment for a large storage\r\nbasin may equal, or even exceed, that required for preliminary\r\nfilters; but the influence of storage on the quality of raw water is\r\nnever injurious, and, by ripening the condition of the water, may be\r\ngreatly beneficial in the process of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe storage available in such a basin makes it possible to shut off\r\nthe supply from the river during the worst conditions of the water.\r\nThe duration of the most troublesome spells ordinarily does not\r\nexceed a few days, and it is usually possible to secure sufficient\r\ncapacity in the basin to tide over these periods. Then again, long\r\nperiods of storage, in addition to assisting in breaking up organic\r\nmatter, permit the dying out of bacteria, particularly many of the\r\npathogenic kind, and, therefore, the water is rendered much safer\r\nfrom this standpoint. In other words, there is additional insurance\r\nin long storage against the faulty and careless operation of\r\nincompetent filter employees. The addition of coagulant, especially\r\nthe fact that only a very small investment of capital is required\r\nfor the necessary apparatus for dosing the water, and that the cost\r\nof the coagulating materials has to be met only when used, seems to\r\ngive the process, in a most satisfactory manner, the requirement for\r\neconomical management and thoroughness in preparing the water for\r\nfinal filtration.\r\n\r\n_Parking Public Works._--It is disappointing that the author has not\r\nmentioned some of the steps contemplated in reference to the\r\nlandscape treatment of the Washington filtration area. Probably\r\nevery one has been impressed by the barren aspect of the works as\r\nthey are approached, and as one looks over them. Recently, however,\r\nit is stated that some steps have been taken to lay out the grounds,\r\ntreat the surface in an attractive manner, and make a park of the\r\narea. The writer has a firm opinion that when an investment is made\r\nfor public works, it costs but little in addition to construct\r\nbuildings along appropriate architectural lines, to treat the\r\ngrounds in a pleasing manner, and to make the entire works a credit\r\nto the municipality from an artistic standpoint. When treated on\r\nbroad lines, such areas become public parks, and afford open\r\nbreathing places for the residents, and, if near centers of\r\npopulation, may well be equipped with playground facilities for the\r\nchildren. When thus developed they should have care, that the\r\nplanting and equipment should not deteriorate and the last state\r\nbecome worse than the first.\r\n\r\nThe influence which these ever-present examples of attractiveness\r\nhave on the community is becoming better recognized by students of\r\nsocial progress, and there seems to be no doubt that spending money\r\non such features is not only desirable from the artistic standpoint,\r\nbut is justified on practical grounds as well. It is cheaper than to\r\ncreate parks, when necessity and demand can no longer be resisted,\r\nby buying property and occasionally tearing down buildings and\r\nconstructing _de novo._ That this work is now being done in\r\nWashington, even after construction, is certainly a recognition of\r\nthe advisability of original efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n~George C. Whipple, M. Am. Soc. C. E.~ (by letter).--Mr. Hardy's\r\npaper is an excellent presentation of the results of the operation\r\nof the Washington water filtration plant from the time of its\r\nconstruction in 1905 until June, 1910. Papers of this character are\r\naltogether too infrequent, and the actual results from the filters\r\nnow in use are not readily accessible in detailed form. Yet it is\r\nonly by studying the results obtained by filters in actual use that\r\nimprovements can be made and the art advanced.\r\n\r\nAmong the many important facts brought out by Mr. Hardy, only a few\r\ncan be selected for discussion. One of these is the operation of\r\nfilters under winter conditions. It is well known that the\r\nefficiency of sedimentation basins and filters is lower during\r\nwinter than at other times, yet it is just at this season of the\r\nyear that there is the greatest danger of typhoid fever and similar\r\nwater-borne diseases being transmitted by water. Most of the great\r\ntyphoid epidemics have occurred during cold weather, and the very\r\nuse of the term \"winter cholera\" is of significance. Apparently,\r\ntyphoid bacilli and similar bacteria are capable of living and\r\nretaining their vitality longest during that season of the year.\r\nJust why this is so, bacteriologists have not satisfactorily\r\nexplained. Doubtless many factors are involved. Because of the\r\nincreased viscosity of the water, sedimentation takes place less\r\nreadily at lower temperatures, and inasmuch as sand filtration is\r\npartly dependent on sedimentation, the efficiency tends to fall off\r\nin cold weather. During winter some of the external destroying\r\nagencies are less potent, such as the sterilizing effect of\r\nsunlight, and the presence and activity of some of the larger forms\r\nof microscopic organisms which prey on the bacteria. Another factor\r\nmay be the greater amount of dissolved oxygen normally present in\r\nwater during cold weather, as experiments have shown that dissolved\r\noxygen favors longevity.\r\n\r\nStill another reason for the larger numbers of bacteria that pass\r\nthrough a water filter during cold weather may be the effect that\r\nthe low temperature has on the size of the bacteria themselves. A\r\nfew experiments made recently by the writer appear to indicate that\r\nat low temperatures the gelatinous membrane which surrounds the\r\nbacterial cells tends to become somewhat contracted, thus decreasing\r\nthe apparent size of the bacteria as seen under the microscope.\r\nEither this contraction occurs, or the cells themselves are smaller\r\nwhen they develop in the cold. It is possible also that low\r\ntemperature affects the flagella of the organisms in the same way.\r\nIt is not unreasonable to suppose that the effect of low temperature\r\nis to form what may be, in effect, a protective coating around the\r\ncells, which tends to make them smaller, less sticky, and less\r\nsubject to outside influences. This would tend to make them pass\r\nthrough a filter more readily. In line with this idea also is the\r\nwell-known fact that disinfection is less efficient in cold water\r\nthan in warm water.\r\n\r\nAnother way of viewing the matter is that cold retards the growth of\r\nbacteria on the filter, thus reducing the effect of the\r\n_Schmutzdecke_. Still another view of the greater danger from\r\nbacterial contamination in winter is the theory that cold prolongs\r\nthe life of the bacteria by merely preventing them from living\r\nthrough their life cycle and reaching natural old age and death as\r\nrapidly as in warm weather.\r\n\r\nAnother topic in Mr. Hardy's paper which has interested the writer\r\nis that of preliminary filters. The experiments described at length\r\nindicate clearly that such devices would prove of little or no\r\nbenefit under the conditions existing in Washington, and that when\r\nthe river contains considerable amounts of suspended clay nothing\r\nless than chemical coagulation will suffice to treat the water so\r\nthat the effluent will be perfectly clear. Preliminary filters have\r\nbeen used for a number of years at various places and with varying\r\nsuccess. In few instances have they been operated for a sufficient\r\nlength of time or been studied with sufficient care to determine\r\nfully their economy and efficiency as compared with other possible\r\nmethods of preliminary treatment.\r\n\r\nAmong other experiments on this matter are those made at Albany, N. Y.,\r\nand published by Wallace Greenalch, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., in\r\nthe Fifty-ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Water for the year\r\nending September 30th, 1909. The Hudson River water used at Albany\r\nis quite different in character from the Potomac River water used at\r\nWashington, as it is less turbid and contains rather more organic\r\nmatter. The results obtained in these experiments showed that during\r\nthe summer the number of bacteria in the effluent from the\r\nexperimental sand filter used in connection with a preliminary\r\nfilter did not differ widely from the number found in the effluent\r\nof the city filter where there was no other preliminary treatment\r\nthan sedimentation. In the winter, however, the numbers of bacteria\r\ndid not increase in the effluent from the experimental filter as\r\nthey did in the effluent from the city filter. This is shown by\r\nTable 26, taken from the report mentioned.\r\n\r\nApparently, therefore, at Albany the benefits of the preliminary\r\nfilter, as far as bacterial efficiency is concerned, would be\r\nconfined to a short period of three or four months in each year.\r\nUnder such circumstances it may well be questioned whether the\r\nadvantages of preliminary filtration justify its cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ~Table 26--Results of Experiments with\r\n            Preliminary Filter at Albany, N.

These\r\ndata include: The numbers of bacteria before and after filtration;\r\nthe percentage of bacteria remaining in the effluent; the average\r\nquantity of water filtered, in millions of gallons per day; the\r\nquantities of water filtered between scrapings; the turbidity of the\r\nraw water; the cost of filtration, including capital charges and\r\ncost of operation; and the typhoid death rates of the city per\r\nmonth. Several points are brought out conspicuously by this diagram.\r\nOne is the uniformly low death rate from typhoid throughout the\r\nentire period. The filter was operated from 1899 until the fall of\r\n1907 with raw water taken from what is known as the \"Back Channel.\"\r\nSince then it has been taken from a new intake which extends into\r\nthe Hudson River itself. Until the fall of 1908 the preliminary\r\ntreatment consisted merely of sedimentation, but since then the\r\nwater has received an additional preliminary treatment in mechanical\r\nfilters operated without coagulant, along the lines of the\r\nexperiments just mentioned. During this time the average rate of\r\nfiltration of the sand filter has not changed materially, although\r\nit is said that the maximum rate has been increased since the\r\npreliminary filters were put in service. The study of the\r\nbacteriological analyses shows that the best results were obtained\r\nduring 1902, 1903, and 1904. Since then the numbers of bacteria in\r\nboth the raw and filtered water have increased. This was especially\r\nnoticeable during the winters of 1907 and 1908 when the water was\r\ntaken from the new intake. It will be interesting to compare the\r\nresults after the preliminary filters have been operated for a long\r\nperiod to ascertain their normal effect on efficiency and on the\r\nincreased yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 11--Filters at Albany, N. Y. Results of\r\nOperation. 1899-1909. Compiled from data in Annual Reports.~]\r\n\r\nAnother fact to be drawn from the plotted Albany data is the\r\nincrease in the cost of filtration, both in capital charges and in\r\noperation. From 1899 until 1906 the cost of operation, including the\r\ncost of low-lift pumping, was approximately $5 per million gallons\r\nof water filtered; and the total cost of filtration, including\r\ncapital charges, was about $10 per million gallons. During the year\r\nending September 30th, 1909, the cost of operation had increased to\r\n$7.63 per million gallons, and the total cost of filtration to\r\n$15.92 per million gallons, or approximately 50% in three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ~Table 27--Results of Bacteriological Analyses of Samples of\r\n         Water at Peekskill, N.

The filter has a capacity of\r\n4,000,000 gal. per day. The supply is taken from Peekskill Creek,\r\nand the water receives about one week's nominal storage before\r\nflowing to the filters. An aerator is used before filtration during\r\nthe summer, when algae are likely to develop in the reservoir. The\r\nfilter was installed after an epidemic of typhoid which was\r\napparently caused by an infection of the water supply. Normally, the\r\nwater has been little contaminated, but the supply is subject to\r\naccidental contamination at any time, among other possible sources\r\nof infection being the camps of workmen now engaged in constructing\r\nthe Catskill Aqueduct for New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ~Table 28--Average Results of Chemical Analysis at Peekskill,\r\n           N.

F. Longley, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.~ (by letter).--In this\r\npaper the author has presented a mass of data which will be welcomed\r\nby engineers engaged in water purification work, because complete\r\noperating records form a substantial basis for improvement in the\r\nart, and are often the inspiration for interesting discussions and\r\nthe exchange of experiences of different observers whose views are\r\nmutually appreciated.\r\n\r\nRecent tendencies in filtration engineering have been largely in the\r\ndirection of reducing the cost of operation. A comparison of the\r\noperating costs of the earlier American plants of about a decade\r\nago, with those here presented of the Washington plant, is very\r\ngratifying to those who have been intimately connected with the\r\nlatter work. Through perfection in design and reasonable care in\r\noperation, the cost of filter cleaning, which is a very considerable\r\npart of the total cost, has been reduced to an unusually low figure,\r\nwithout any sacrifice in efficiency, and in the interests of the\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\nTable 14 shows that, from the first year, there has been a\r\nprogressive increase in the total cost of operation per million\r\ngallons filtered, but this has not meant an increase in the annual\r\ntotal expenditure. The largest percentage of increase in any item\r\nhas been in \"Care of Grounds and Parking,\" and covers much-desired\r\nlandscape improvements. Aside from this, the principal factor\r\naffecting the table of costs has been the reduction in water\r\nconsumption in the District of Columbia. Nothing pertaining to this\r\nreduction has produced any corresponding reduction in the force\r\nrequired for the maintenance and operation of the filtration plant,\r\noffice and laboratory, and pumping station, though probably there\r\nhas been some reduction in filter cleaning. Obviously, then, the\r\ntotal cost per million gallons would increase.\r\n\r\nThis decrease in consumption has been brought about by the\r\nelimination of waste in the distribution system, which is not in the\r\nsame department as the filtration plant, but with regard to which a\r\nword may not be amiss in connection with this discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Aqueduct was built half a century ago on lines which\r\nat that time were considered extraordinarily generous. Until\r\nrecently, therefore, there has been no occasion for concern over the\r\nhigh rate of consumption. During recent years, however, the use and\r\nwaste of water have increased, reaching a climax under unusual\r\nconditions in the winter of 1904-05. The maximum capacity of the\r\naqueduct system is about 90,000,000 gal. The maximum daily\r\nconsumption at the time mentioned arose almost to 100,000,000 gal.,\r\nwith the result that, before normal conditions were restored, the\r\nreservoirs of the system were almost depleted.\r\n\r\nThis had a beneficial effect, as provision was made for an active\r\ncampaign for reducing the waste of water, which was known to be very\r\nlarge. These investigations, using the pitometer, were begun in\r\nJuly, 1906, and have been pursued continuously since that time, with\r\nmost excellent results. Up to January, 1909, leaks aggregating about\r\n12,000,000 gal. per day were detected and eliminated, and about half\r\nthe house services had still to be covered by the pitometer bureau.\r\n\r\nAlthough this reduction in waste has brought about an apparent\r\nincrease in the cost of filtration, its economical results have been\r\nfar-reaching. The causes which brought about this investigation also\r\nresulted in securing an appropriation for the study of the question\r\nof increased supply. The writer was in charge of these studies, and\r\nthe most significant conclusion was that, owing to the excellent\r\nresults of the efforts for waste restriction, the total consumption\r\nand waste of water in the district during the next few years would\r\nbe far enough below the safe working capacity of the existing\r\naqueduct system to make it entirely safe to postpone the\r\nconstruction of new works, involving the expenditure of several\r\nmillion dollars, in spite of the threatening conditions of a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThere has been so much controversy over typhoid fever in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia that the writer hesitates to discuss this\r\nsubject. Viewing the situation through the perspective of several\r\nyears, however, it does not seem to be as hopeless as the criticisms\r\nof four or five years ago would lead one to believe.\r\n\r\nIn Table 9, showing the typhoid death rates, out of nine years given\r\nprior to 1905-06, when the filters were started in operation, only\r\none shows an annual death rate as low as the highest one since that\r\nyear. Further than this, the annual average typhoid death rate for\r\nthe period since that year has been one-third lower than for a\r\ncorresponding period before the filters were started.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive researches of the Public Health and Marine Hospital\r\nService into this whole question, covering a period of about four\r\nyears, have raised the present filtered water supply of the District\r\nof Columbia above any well-founded criticism. There has long been a\r\nstrong and growing feeling that the water supply, before filtration\r\nwas introduced, had been blamed for more than its share of the\r\ntyphoid, and this is borne out by much evidence that has been\r\npresented from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt is not an unreasonable conjecture, therefore, that perhaps the\r\nreduction of one-third in the total typhoid death rate may represent\r\na much larger reduction in that part of the total which was due to\r\npolluted water alone; and that, as the authorities in the District\r\nof Columbia and in certain other cities, particularly in the South,\r\nare now recognizing, the fight against much of the remaining typhoid\r\nmust be in the direction of the improvement of milk supplies,\r\nprecautions against secondary infection, and attention to a large\r\nnumber of details surrounding the individual, which may effectively\r\nprotect him against the insidious attack of the disease favored by\r\nunknown agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Experiments in Filter Cleaning~.\r\n\r\nThe author refers to the difficulty encountered during the first two\r\nsummers in keeping the filters cleaned fast enough to maintain the\r\ncapacity of the plant. The real seriousness of this may be judged\r\nfrom the following facts. The average increase in loss of head on\r\nall the filters for the entire year, July 1st, 1906, to July 1st,\r\n1907, was about 0.053 ft. per day. During the 1906 period of low\r\ncapacity under discussion, the loss of head on twelve of the filters\r\nincreased for a period of eight days at the average rate of 0.45 ft.\r\nper day, or about nine times the normal rate of increase. This\r\ndifficulty was caused by the presence of large numbers of\r\nmicro-organisms in the applied water. During the first summer (1906)\r\nthis fact was not recognized, but the sudden decrease in capacity\r\nwas supposed to have been caused by the unusually high and\r\nlong-continued turbidity which prevailed during that summer in the\r\nPotomac River, and persisted in the water supplied to the filters\r\neven after about four days of sedimentation in the reservoirs.\r\nDuring the second summer (1907) the same phenomenon of suddenly and\r\nrapidly increasing losses of head appeared again, but without any\r\nunusual turbidity in the applied water. Investigation, however,\r\nshowed the presence of large quantities of organisms, particularly\r\n_melosira_ and _synedra_, in the applied water, and examinations in\r\nsubsequent years have shown a periodic recurrence of these forms in\r\nquantities sufficient to cause the trouble mentioned. In June, 1907,\r\nexamination showed repeatedly more than 1,000 and 1,500 standard\r\nunits of _melosira_ per cu. cm., and one count showed nearly 3,000\r\nstandard units.\r\n\r\nSeveral expedients were tried in an effort to restore the rapidly\r\ndecreasing capacity of the filters. One of the earlier conjectures\r\nas to the cause of the trouble was that it might be due to the\r\naccumulation of large quantities of air under the surface of the\r\nsand, as air had been observed bubbling up through the sand,\r\nespecially in filters which had been in service for some time. The\r\nexpedient was tried, therefore, of draining the water out of the\r\nsand and then re-filling the filter in the usual manner from below,\r\nin the hope of driving out the entrained air. Presumably this\r\ntreatment got rid of the air, but it did not restore the capacity of\r\nthe filter, as the point of maximum resistance was in the surface of\r\nthe sand and not below it.\r\n\r\nAs the author states, raking the filters was tried and found to give\r\nresults which were satisfactory enough to meet the emergencies\r\nalready referred to. When the filters were first put in operation,\r\nin the fall of 1905, the method of bringing back the capacity of a\r\nfilter after the end of a run was to remove all the dirty sand to a\r\ndepth determined by the marked discoloration caused by the\r\npenetration of the clay turbidity. This sometimes necessitated the\r\nremoval of large quantities of sand at a cleaning, as the turbidity\r\nwas exceedingly fine, and penetrated at times to a depth of 3 or 4\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWith the idea of effecting an economy in the cost of cleaning the\r\nfilters, a schedule of experiments was arranged shortly before July\r\n1st, 1907. The general object of the experiments was to determine,\r\nfirst, the relative costs of all different methods tried; second,\r\nwhether the removal of only a thin layer of sand, or the mere\r\nbreaking up of the surface of the sand by thorough raking, would\r\ngive the filter its proper capacity for the succeeding run; third,\r\nwhether the filters under these treatments would maintain a high\r\nstandard of quality in the effluents; fourth, whether the continued\r\napplication of any less thorough method than the one then in use\r\nmight materially affect the future capacity of the filters.\r\n\r\nTo this end the filters were divided into four groups which, during\r\na period of about six months, were subjected to treatments as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Group _A._--Filters scraped deep at the end of each run;\r\n    Group _B._--Filters scraped light at the end of each run;\r\n    Group _C._--Filters raked at the end of each run, until raking\r\n                failed to bring back the proper capacity; then they\r\n                were scraped light, and at the end of the next run\r\n                the raking was resumed;\r\n    Group _D._--Light scrapings and rakings alternate at ends of\r\n                runs.\r\n\r\nThe term \"deep scraping\" means the removal of practically all the\r\ndiscolored sand, in accordance with the usual practice prior to the\r\nbeginning of these experiments; \"light scraping\" means the removal\r\nof only a thin surface layer of sand. This depth has usually\r\naveraged about 3/8 in. \"Raking\" means the thorough breaking up of\r\nthe clogged surface of the filter by iron-toothed rakes, to a depth\r\nof about 1 or 2 in.\r\n\r\n_Results._--A general summary of the results of these experiments is\r\ngiven in Table 29, which also shows the relative costs of the\r\ndifferent methods per million gallons of water filtered. A normal\r\nperiod of 9 months just prior to the beginning of these experiments\r\nshows a labor cost (corresponding to that in Table 29) of $0.29-1/4\r\nper million gallons filtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ~Table 29--Average Results.~\r\n\r\n  Columns:\r\n    A - Group.\r\n    B - Number of filters.\r\n    C - Number of days of service.\r\n    D - Million gallons filtered.\r\n    E - Cost of labor per treatment.\r\n    F - Sand removed in cubic yards.\r\n    G - Sand removed in cubic yards.\r\n    H - Cost of labor.\r\n    I - Bacteria per cu. cm. in effluent.\r\n    J - Turbidity in effluent.\r\n\r\n  =========================================+===============+==============\r\n                                           |  Per Million  |       |\r\n                  Per Run:                 |    Gallons    |       |\r\n                                           |   Filtered    |   I   |   J\r\n  -----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+       |\r\n    A  |  B  |  C  |   D   |   E   |   F   |   G   |   H   |       |\r\n  -----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n   _A_ |   5 |  82 | 221.2 |$68.44 |  215  |  1.11 |$0.309 |   13  |   1\r\n   _B_ |   9 |  36 | 101.4 | 29.25 |   84  |  0.83 | 0.288 |   16  |   1\r\n   _C_ |   5 |  21 |  60.0 | 10.92 |   24  |  0.40 | 0.182 |   18  |   1\r\n   _D_ |  10 |  32 |  86.0 | 20.10 |   46  |  0.54 | 0.234 |   22  |   1\r\n  =====+=====+=====+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+======\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capacity of Filters._--The capacity of the filters under the\r\ndifferent methods of treatment are shown in a general way in Table\r\n29 for days of service and millions of gallons filtered per run.\r\nThis element by itself is decidedly in favor of the deep scrapings,\r\nand least in favor of the repeated rakings.\r\n\r\nA clearer conception of the capacities of the filters under these\r\ndifferent conditions may be obtained from the four diagrams, Figure\r\n12, showing, for the four different groups, the average number of\r\ndays of service of the successive runs. The diagram for Group _A_\r\nshows that the variations in the period of service of the filters\r\nscraped each time to clean sand follow a more or less definite curve\r\nfrom year to year. For the period covered by this curve, the\r\ntendency seems to be toward a slight decrease in capacity from year\r\nto year, as shown by the lower average maximum and minimum in the\r\nsecond year than in the first. Group _B_ shows a sudden decrease in\r\ncapacity following the first light scrapings and, since that time, a\r\nlow but quite constant capacity. Group _C_ shows a constantly\r\ndecreasing capacity with successive rakings. The only significance\r\nattaching to the curve after the first raking is the prohibitively\r\nlow capacity indicated, and the ineffectiveness of the measures\r\ntaken to restore the capacity after the sixth raking. Group _D_,\r\nafter the first raking, shows a prohibitively low and constantly\r\ndecreasing capacity. The diagrams for _C_ and _D_ indicate a\r\ndangerous reduction in capacity if long persisted in. The method\r\nfollowed with Group _C_ may be dismissed with the statement that it\r\nis entirely insufficient, and would be of use only in the rarest\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\nAs far as the question of capacity is concerned, these diagrams indicate\r\nthat a filter in normal condition may safely be raked once. It is\r\nbelieved that the constantly decreasing capacity shown in Group _D_ is\r\nnot due so much to the rakings as to the small quantities of sand\r\nremoved at the alternate scrapings, and therefore it would not be proper\r\nto condemn this method of treatment without a further trial in which\r\nthis defect was remedied. This view seems to be supported by the results\r\nof Group _B_. The low but approximately constant capacity there shown\r\nwould undoubtedly have been higher if a greater depth of sand had been\r\nremoved each time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 12--Average Number of Days of Service of\r\nSuccessive Runs for Groups _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_.~]\r\n\r\n_Quality of the Effluent._--The averages given in Table 29 show but\r\nlittle difference in the bacterial contents of the effluents from\r\nthe four groups of filters. All are entirely satisfactory, and the\r\ndifferences in favor of one method or another are small. In looking\r\nfor possible differences in the quality of the effluents from the\r\nfour groups, it was thought that such differences might be most\r\napparent at a time when the entire plant was working under the most\r\nadverse conditions. The bacterial counts, therefore, were summarized\r\nfor the period from December 23d, 1907, to January 6th, 1908,\r\ninclusive, following a period of high turbidity and high bacteria in\r\nthe raw water, with results as follows:\r\n\r\n    Group....... _A_   _B_   _C_   _D_\r\n    Maximum..... 204   178   189   206\r\n    Minimum.....  61    45    62    57\r\n    Average..... 120   107   104   155\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the turbidity results for a similar\r\nperiod:\r\n\r\n    Group.......  _A_    _B_   _C_   _D_\r\n    Maximum..... 10.8   11.7   8.7   9.3\r\n    Minimum.....  6.7    4.7   6.2   5.7\r\n    Average.....  8.7    8.3   7.2   7.9\r\n\r\nThese numbers, though high, do not show any significant differences.\r\nAll the averages for each group are less than the lowest maximum,\r\nand all are greater than the highest minimum, and therefore vary\r\nless than do the individual filters, from other causes, within the\r\ndifferent groups.\r\n\r\n_Future Capacity of the Filters._--An indication of the dangers\r\nwhich might affect the future capacity of the filters was shown in\r\nthe above discussion of the present capacity. A more effective way\r\nof showing this was obtained by a study of the initial resistances\r\nor losses of head in the four groups. A filter kept in ideal\r\ncondition would show no increase in this initial loss of head from\r\none run to the next. If there is such an increase, it means that at\r\nsome future time measures more heroic than ordinarily used would be\r\nnecessary to restore the proper capacity.\r\n\r\nThe average initial losses of head for the different groups are\r\nplotted on the diagram, Figure 13. Group _A_ shows an initial loss of\r\nhead, increasing gradually but slightly during more than two years\r\nof service. In Group _B_ the initial loss of head increased in a\r\nmanner similar to that in Group _A,_ up to the time of the beginning\r\nof these experiments; after which the increase becomes more rapid.\r\nGroups _C_ and _D_ show conditions generally similar to Group _B_,\r\nwith some variations which are self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._--The quality of the effluents from all four groups\r\nwas satisfactory, and no consistent difference was apparent in favor\r\nof one or another method of treatment. The method pursued with Group\r\n_C_ was entirely insufficient to maintain the capacity indefinitely.\r\nThe methods pursued in Groups _B_ and _D_ were both insufficient,\r\nbut would have been more effective if a greater depth of sand had\r\nbeen removed. The costs of treatment of Groups _B_ and _D_ were less\r\nthan for Group _A_. It appears, then, that a treatment which would\r\nbe more economical than the old method of Group _A_, and would still\r\nmaintain the proper capacity, would be one similar to that of Groups\r\n_B_ or _D_, with the removal of a quantity of sand greater than was\r\ndone in the case of these two groups, but less than in the old\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 13--Average Initial Losses of Head for Groups\r\n_A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_ for Successive Runs.~]\r\n\r\nAt the time the above results were summarized, it was proposed to\r\nproceed with the filter treatment along the lines just mentioned.\r\nThe writer did not have an opportunity to study the subsequent\r\nresults, as he was transferred to other work. A statement by the\r\nauthor of any new facts that may have come to light in this\r\nconnection would be of interest.\r\n\r\nMention should be made, too, of another expedient that was used to\r\nhasten the restoration of the capacity of a filter, which proved to\r\nbe a most useful one. The removal of the scraped sand from a filter\r\nwas a matter of a good many hours' work, under the most favorable\r\nconditions. To get the filters quickly into service again, the dirty\r\nsand in a number of them was simply scraped from the surface, heaped\r\ninto piles, and left there; then the water was turned in, and the\r\nfilter was started again. This was done with some hesitation at\r\nfirst for fear the presence of the piles of dirty sand might cause\r\nhigh bacterial counts in the effluents of those filters. No such\r\neffect was observed, however, the counts being entirely normal\r\nthroughout. The writer subsequently found the same treatment being\r\napplied as an emergency measure at the Torresdale plant, in\r\nPhiladelphia, and, through the courtesy of the Chief Engineer of the\r\nBureau of Filtration, was furnished with the bacterial counts\r\nthrough a number of runs made under these conditions, and there,\r\ntoo, the results were entirely normal.\r\n\r\nThere was practically no economy in this method, as the sand had\r\nultimately to be ejected and washed. The piling up of the sand had\r\nthe effect of reducing the effective filtering area by a small\r\npercentage, with a corresponding increase in the actual rate of\r\nfiltration, but this was of trifling importance. The great benefit\r\nderived from the method was the saving of time in getting a filter\r\nback into service after scraping, and in this respect it was very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Physical Theory of Purification of Water by Slow Sand Filters~.\r\n\r\nThe first and most natural conception of the action of a sand filter\r\nis that the removal of impurities is effected by a straining action.\r\nThis, of course, is perfectly true as far as it relates to a large\r\npart of the visible impurities. Much of this is gross enough to be\r\nintercepted and held at the surface of the sand. This very straining\r\naction is an accumulative one. After a quantity of suspended matter\r\nthus strained out mats itself on the surface of the sand, it in turn\r\nbecomes a strainer, even better adapted than the clean sand surface\r\nwhich supports it for the removal of suspended matter from the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThis, however, cannot explain certain features of the purification\r\nof water by a layer of sand. The removal of color, the reduction of\r\nnitrates, and certain other changes in the organic content of the\r\nwater have for a long time been recognized as due to a bio-chemical\r\naction carried on by certain bacteria in the sand. Both the\r\nstraining action and this bio-chemical action are not all-sufficient\r\nfor the explanation of certain phenomena, and it has been\r\nrecognized, too, that sedimentation in the pores of the sand played\r\na large part in the purification process in those cases in which it\r\nwas apparent that the biological agencies were not the chief ones.\r\n\r\nIn the purification of water containing only insignificant\r\nquantities of suspended matter, but a relatively large amount of\r\nunstable organic matter, it will be conceded at once that the chief\r\nfactor in the purification is the nitrification produced by the\r\nbacteria in the upper layers of the sand. On the other hand, the\r\npurification by sand filters of a hypothetical water containing no\r\norganic matter, but only finely-divided mineral matter in\r\nsuspension, could take place only by the physical deposition of the\r\nparticles upon the sand grains. Between these two extremes lie all\r\nclasses of water. In all problems of water purification by\r\nfiltration through sand, both these factors--biological action and\r\nsedimentation--play their parts, assisting and supplementing each\r\nother, the relative importance of one factor or the other depending\r\non the place of the particular water in question on the scale\r\nbetween the two extreme conditions just mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Hazen's paper on \"Sedimentation\"[1] there is an interesting\r\ndevelopment of the theory of the removal of suspended matter by\r\nsedimentation in the pores of a layer of sand. The factors influencing\r\nthis removal are the rate of filtration, the effective size of the sand,\r\nand the temperature of the water. For the conditions at the Washington\r\nplant, it may be assumed that the first two of these factors are\r\nconstant. The third factor, however, varies through wide limits, and the\r\nobservations on the turbidity removal, and on the different phases of\r\nthe filter operation of which the turbidity of the water is a factor\r\nunder varying temperature conditions, together with the known relations\r\nbetween hydraulic values and temperatures of water, furnished good\r\nsubstantiative evidence that this highly-induced sedimentation may be a\r\nconsiderable factor in the purification of the water as effected at this\r\nplant. This temperature relation, briefly stated, is as follows: For\r\nparticles of a size so small that the viscosity of the water is the\r\ncontrolling factor in determining the velocity of their subsidence in\r\nstill water, that velocity will vary directly as (T + 10) / 60, in which\r\nT is the temperature, in degrees, Fahrenheit. That is, when the\r\ntemperature of the water is between 70 deg. and 80 deg. Fahr., a\r\nparticle will settle with twice the velocity it would have if the water\r\nwere near the freezing point.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Transactions_, Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. LIII, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nThe layer of sand in a slow sand filter may be considered as a very\r\ngreat number of small sedimentation basins communicating one with\r\nanother, not in the manner of basins connected in series, but\r\nrather, as Mr. Hazen has expressed it, as a long series of\r\ncompartments connected at one side only with a passageway in which a\r\ncurrent is maintained. In any section of the sand layer there are\r\nareas through which the water passes with a velocity much greater\r\nthan its mean velocity through the total area of voids, while there\r\nare other areas in which the velocity is very much less, perhaps in\r\nan almost quiescent state from time to time, greatly favoring the\r\ndeposition of particles, but with a gentle intermittent circulation,\r\ndisplacing the settled or partly-settled water and supplying from\r\nthe main currents water containing more suspended matter particles\r\nto be removed. There is thus a considerable percentage of the total\r\nvolume of voids in which the water is subjected to very favorable\r\nconditions for sedimentation, almost perfect stillness and an\r\nexceedingly small distance for a particle to settle before it\r\nstrikes bottom on the surface of a grain of sand.\r\n\r\nIf sedimentation were the predominating factor in the purification\r\nof the water, we would then expect to find the following phenomena\r\nin the operation of the filters: A more rapid deposition of a given\r\namount of sediment under summer temperature conditions than under\r\nwinter, as the water passes through the sand, and therefore, for the\r\nformer condition of higher temperature:\r\n\r\n  (a) A greater concentration of this turbidity-producing material\r\n      in the top layer of sand, or, in other words, a thinner sand\r\n      layer to be removed in scraping if all the dirty sand is\r\n      removed;\r\n\r\n  (b) Because of the greater concentration, a greater rate of\r\n      Increase of the loss of head, and consequently shorter periods\r\n      of service between scrapings;\r\n\r\n  (c) A higher limit for turbidity in the water applied to the\r\n      filter to produce a given turbidity in the effluent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ~Table 30--Service Periods and Scraping Depths for Runs\r\n     Ending In Various Months; Covering Entire Period,\r\n         October 1st, 1905, To March 1st, 1907.~\r\n  ==========+=========+===========+===============+=============\r\n            |         |  Average  |    Average    |     Mean\r\n            |  Number | period of | depth of sand | temperature,\r\n    Month.  |    of   |  service  |  removed, in  |  in degrees,\r\n            | filters.|  in days. |    inches.    |  Fahrenheit.\r\n  ----------+---------+-----------+---------------+-------------\r\n  January   |    13   |     75    |      2.09     |     39\r\n  February  |     6   |     98    |      2.46     |     37\r\n  March     |     5   |    130    |      2.66     |     41\r\n  April     |     8   |    149    |      2.96     |     53\r\n  May       |     7   |    130    |      2.80     |     67\r\n  June      |    11   |    124    |      2.35     |     77\r\n  July      |    17   |     70    |      2.12     |     81\r\n  August    |     2   |     49    |      1.98     |     80\r\n  September |     5   |     73    |      2.48     |     76\r\n  October   |    37   |     70    |      1.56     |     64\r\n  November  |    20   |     42    |      0.81     |     49\r\n  December  |    14   |     57    |      0.94     |     40\r\n  ==========+=========+===========+===============+=============\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operation of this plant during the first year and a half offered an\r\nexcellent opportunity for the study of sedimentation in the sand, and\r\nthe data in Table 30 are presented to show that certain of the phenomena\r\nof filter operation observed during this period seem to be fairly\r\nexplicable by the physical theory of purification. These data are given\r\nonly for the period of operation before the summer of 1907. At that time\r\nthe experiments in filter cleaning already described were begun. Before\r\nthat time, whenever a filter had been cleaned, all the discolored sand\r\nhad been removed, leaving for the following run a new sand surface\r\nsubstantially in the perfect condition of a newly-constructed filter.\r\nAfter that time the experimental methods of cleaning, and the new\r\nroutine adopted as a result thereof, interfered with the tracing of the\r\nevidence as clearly as during the earlier periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 14--Periods of Service and Depths of Scraping\r\nfor Runs Ending in Various Months Covering Entire Period Oct. 1, 1905,\r\nto Mar. 1 1907.~]\r\n\r\nTable 30 and the corresponding diagram, Figure 14, show the general\r\nvariations in the length of runs and depth of penetration, with the\r\nseasonal temperature changes. The increase in length of runs and\r\nquantity of sand removed under low temperature conditions is very\r\nmarked. There is, however, a secondary maximum which appears, as the\r\ndiagram shows, where a minimum for the year would be expected. This\r\nmay have been an irregularity occurring this one year, which will\r\nnot appear in the average of several years, and caused by some\r\nfactor which has escaped observation. A careful analysis of the data\r\nat hand fails to show any explanation for it. It may exist in some\r\nof the little-understood biological actions which have their maximum\r\neffect under warm-water conditions, or it may be due--in some\r\nobscure way--to the liberation of air under the surface of the sand,\r\naccumulating with pressure enough to break the surface at\r\ninnumerable points, thereby reducing the loss of head and extending\r\nthe period of service. Some evidence was observed pointing to this\r\nexplanation, but it was never conclusively proven.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of temperature changes on the rapidity of removal\r\nof the sediment and its consequent concentration in the sand layer,\r\nhowever, seems plainly evident.\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of the third point mentioned in the theoretical\r\nconsideration of turbidity removal in the filters, the daily\r\nturbidities of the filtered water have been classified and\r\nsummarized for different turbidities in the applied water, and also\r\nfor different temperatures. The average turbidities thus obtained\r\nare given in Table 31.\r\n\r\n          ~Table 31--Turbidity in Filtered Water at\r\n             Different Temperatures Produced by\r\n              Given Turbidity in Applied Water.~\r\n  ==========+=================================================\r\n  Turbidity |\r\n      of    |     ~Temperature, in Degrees, Fahrenheit.~\r\n   applied  |---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n    water.  |   40    | 40 - 50 | 50 - 60 | 60 - 70 |   70\r\n  ----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  20        |   1.8   |   1.3   |   1.2   |   1.5   |   1.7\r\n  20-40     |   4.8   |   5.0   |   3.5   |   3.0   |   2.6\r\n  40-60     |   7.9   |   6.9   |   5.4   |   ...   |   3.7\r\n  60-80     |  10.7   |   7.7   |   ...   |   ...   |   5.4\r\n  80-100    |  11.3   |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |   ...\r\n  100       |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |  12.0[1]\r\n  ==========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: For an average turbidity = 150. approximately.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of the temperature of the water on the turbidity of\r\nthe effluent is very pronounced. For a temperature of less than 40 deg.\r\nFahr. (actual average temperature about 35 deg.), the turbidity of the\r\nfiltered water for a given turbidity of the applied water is\r\npractically twice as great as for a temperature greater than 70 deg.\r\n(actual average temperature about 75 deg.). This fact fits in very\r\nnicely with the influence of temperature on sedimentation. Referring\r\nagain to this temperature relation, as set forth on a previous page,\r\nthe hydraulic subsiding value of a particle in water, of a size so\r\nsmall that viscosity is the controlling factor in its downward\r\nvelocity, is approximately twice as great at 75 deg. as at 35 degrees.\r\nWe would then expect to find that, in order to obtain a given\r\nturbidity in the filtered water, a raw water may be applied at 75 deg.,\r\nhaving twice the turbidity of the water applied at 35 deg., to produce\r\nthe same turbidity; and further, as the turbidity of the filtered\r\nwater, for a given temperature condition, varies quite directly in\r\nproportion to the turbidity in the applied water, it follows that an\r\napplied water of given turbidity will produce an effluent at 35 deg.\r\nwith a turbidity twice as great as at 75 degrees. This is quite in\r\naccordance with the facts obtained in actual operation, as indicated\r\non the diagram, Figure 15.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Treatment of the Water._--The most striking features of\r\nthe bacterial results given in Table 4 are, first, the uniformly low\r\nnumbers of bacteria in the filtered water during perhaps 8 or 9\r\nmonths of the year, and the increase in numbers each winter. This is\r\nshown clearly in the analysis of bacterial counts in Table 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~Table 32--Classification of Daily Bacterial Counts in\r\n        the Filtered-Water Reservoir During the Period,\r\n          November 1st, 1905, to February 1st, 1908.~\r\n  ==========================+==============+======================\r\n   Bacterial count between: | No. of days. | Percentage of whole.\r\n  --------------------------+--------------+----------------------\r\n   0 and  20 per cu. cm.    |     291      |    41.0\r\n  20 and  40 per \"   \"      |     245      |    34.6\r\n  40 and  60 per \"   \"      |      63      |     8.9\r\n  60 and  80 per \"   \"      |      30      |     4.2\r\n  80 and 100 per \"   \"      |      28      |     4.0      92.7\r\n  --------------------------+--------------+----------------------\r\n  100 and 200 per \"   \"     |      29      |     4.1\r\n  200 and 300 per \"   \"     |      13      |     1.8\r\n  300 and 500 per \"   \"     |       5      |     0.7\r\n  500 and 1000 per \"   \"    |       5      |     0.7       7.3\r\n  --------------------------+--------------+----------------------\r\n                            |              |             100.0\r\n  ==========================+==============+======================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tests for _Bacillus Coli_ in Table 5 show results which\r\ncorrespond closely to these, with this organism detected only\r\ninfrequently, except during the periods of high bacteria, and both\r\nof these are parallel to the turbidity variations in the filtered\r\nwater. These variations follow closely the variations in the\r\nturbidity and in the bacterial content of the water applied to the\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\nBy all standards of excellence, the sanitary quality of the water\r\nduring the greater part of the time is beyond criticism. In view of\r\nthe close parallelism of turbidity and bacterial results in the\r\napplied and in the filtered water, it is entirely logical to\r\nconclude that, if the quality of the applied water could be\r\nmaintained continually through the winter as good as, or better\r\nthan, it is during the summer, then the filtered water would be of\r\nthe perfect sanitary quality desired throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nThis was all foreseen ten years ago, when Messrs. Hering, Fuller,\r\nand Hazen recommended auxiliary works for preliminary treatment of\r\nthe supply, although, as the author states, these works were not\r\nprovided for in the original construction. As prejudice against the\r\nuse of a coagulant seemed to be at the bottom of the opposition to\r\nthe preliminary treatment, a campaign of education bearing on this\r\npoint was instituted, in addition to the systematic studies of\r\ndifferent preliminary methods to which the author refers. As a\r\nresult of the combined efforts of all those interested in promoting\r\nthis improvement, an appropriation was finally made for the work in\r\n1910. The coagulating plant has since been built, and the writer is\r\ninformed that coagulation was tried on a working scale a short time\r\nago during a period of high turbidity. A statement of the results of\r\nthis treatment on the purification of the water in the reservoir\r\nsystem and in the filter plant would be of great interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Figure 15-- Turbidity in Applied Water.~]\r\n\r\n_Hydraulic Replacing of Filter Sand._--The author has adopted a\r\nmethod of replacing clean sand in the filters which will commend\r\nitself to engineers as containing possibilities of economy in\r\noperation. The first experiments in the development of this method\r\nat the Washington plant were carried out some three years ago, while\r\nthe writer was still there. Substantially the same methods were used\r\nthen as are described in this paper, but examination of the sand\r\nlayer by cutting vertically downward through it after re-sanding in\r\nthis manner showed such a persistent tendency toward the segregation\r\nof the coarse material as to hold out rather discouraging promises\r\nof success. The greatest degree of separation seemed to be caused by\r\nthe wash of the stream discharging sand on the surface. It was\r\nobserved that, near the point where the velocity of the stream was\r\npractically destroyed, there seemed to be a tendency to scour away\r\nthe fine sand and leave the coarse material by itself, and pockets\r\nof this kind were found at many points throughout the sand layer.\r\nThe author states that, in the recent treatment of the filters by\r\nthis method, there has been no apparent tendency for the materials\r\nto separate into different sizes, and it is fortunate if this work\r\ncan be done in such a manner as to avoid this separation entirely.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether a certain amount of segregation of the\r\nmaterials will make any practical difference in the efficiency of a\r\nfilter. In all probability this depends on the degree of the\r\nsegregation, the quantity of pollution in the water to be filtered,\r\nthe rate of filtration, and the uniformity of methods followed in\r\nthe operation, etc. For an applied water as excellent in quality as\r\nthat of the Washington City Reservoir during favorable summer\r\nconditions, a considerable degree of segregation might exist without\r\nproducing any diminution in efficiency. For a badly polluted water,\r\nhowever, such as the applied water at this plant during certain\r\nwinter periods, or the water of a great many other polluted\r\nsupplies, it might be found that even a slight lack of homogeneity\r\nin the sand might make an appreciable difference in the results of\r\nfiltration.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the experiments herein described, however, this\r\nmethod may be applied at other plants where conditions seem to\r\nwarrant it, with a largely increased measure of confidence;\r\nalthough, as in the case of the adoption of any new or radical\r\ndeparture, that confidence must not be permitted to foster contempt\r\nof the old and tried methods, but its operation must be watched with\r\nthe utmost caution, until long experience shall have demonstrated\r\nits perfect suitability and defined its limitations.\r\n\r\n~E. D. Hardy, M. Am. Soc. C. E.~ (by letter).--It was not the\r\nwriter's original intention to enter into a discussion of either the\r\ntheory of water purification or of the experimental work on sand\r\nhandling, but simply to present the main results of operation\r\nlargely in tabular form. He is gratified, however, to have these\r\nsides of the question so ably brought out in Mr. Longley's\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Hazen referred to the inferior efficiencies of the experimental\r\nfilters for rate studies (as shown in Table 20) in the removal of the\r\n_B. Coli_ from the water tested. This inferiority is really less than\r\nthe figures in the table would indicate, as the tests for the\r\nexperimental filters were presumptive only (as shown by the note at the\r\nfoot of Table 20), while those for the main filters were carried through\r\nall the confirmatory steps.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments[1] made by Messrs. Longley and Baton in the\r\nwriter's office, it would seem reasonable to assume that about\r\none-half of the positive results, would have been eliminated had the\r\nconfirmatory steps been taken. In other words, the figures showing\r\nthe number of positive tests for _B. Coli_ in Table 20 should be\r\ndivided by two when comparing them with corresponding ones for the\r\nmain filters.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Published in the _Journal of Infectious Diseases_,\r\n   Vol. 4, No. 3, June, 1907.]\r\n\r\nMr. Knowles seems somewhat apprehensive regarding the methods described\r\nin the paper of restoring the capacity of the filters by raking, and\r\nreplacing sand by the hydraulic method, and yet, from Mr. Johnson's\r\ndiscussion, it would seem that the practice of raking filters between\r\nscrapings had recently been adopted at the Pittsburg plant.\r\n\r\nBefore the practice of raking was finally adopted as a part of the\r\nroutine filter operation, the subject was given a great deal of\r\nthought and study, as may be seen by referring to Mr. Longley's\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe re-sanding has been done by the hydraulic method, for nearly two\r\nyears, and, as far as the writer is able to judge, this method has\r\nbeen more economical and also more satisfactory in every way than\r\nthe old one. As Mr. Hazen states, this does not prove that the\r\nhydraulic method would be as satisfactory for other filter plants\r\nand other grades of sand. The elevated sand bins at the Washington\r\nplant fit in well with this scheme, and save the expense of one\r\nshoveling of the sand; and the low uniformity coefficient of the\r\nsand is favorable in decreasing its tendency to separate into\r\npockets or strata of coarse and fine sand. The method of washing is\r\nalso well adapted to this method of re-sanding, as the sand is made\r\nvery clean in its passage through the washers and storage bins. The\r\nhydraulic method of replacing sand tends to make it cleaner still,\r\nbecause any clay which may be left in the sand is constantly being\r\ncarried away over the weir and out of the bed, to the sewer. Sand\r\nreplaced by the hydraulic method is much more compact than when\r\nreplaced by other methods, and consequently the depth of penetration\r\nof mud in a filter thus re-sanded is less. Careful tests of the\r\neffluents from filters which have been re-sanded by the two methods\r\nhave invariably shown the superiority of the hydraulic method.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of replacing sand by water, referred to by Mr.\r\nLongley, was not considered a success at the time, and the method\r\nwas abandoned for about a year. At that time an attempt was made to\r\ncomplete the re-sanding of a filter which had been nearly completed\r\nby the old method. The precaution of filling the filter with water\r\nwas not taken, nor was any special device used for distributing the\r\nsand. When this method was again taken up, various experiments were\r\ntried before the present method was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. Whipple's remarks on the results from the operation of filters\r\nunder winter conditions are very interesting, and, considering his\r\nstanding as an authority in such matters, they are worth careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the Washington plant, it has always been\r\nnoticeable that the results were much poorer in winter than in\r\nsummer. In fact, nearly all the unsatisfactory water which has been\r\ndelivered to the city mains has been supplied during the winter\r\nmonths. On the other hand, the typhoid death rate has always been\r\ncomparatively low in cold weather. These facts would seem to\r\nindicate that the water supply was not responsible for the typhoid\r\nconditions.",
