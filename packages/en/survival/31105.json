MAPES,\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEER OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA,\r\n\r\nThis Book\r\n\r\nIS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED\r\n\r\nBY HIS PUPIL,\r\n\r\n      THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE STUDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is presented to you, not as a work of science, nor as a dry,\r\nchemical treatise, but as a plain statement of the more simple\r\noperations by which nature produces many results, so common to our\r\nobservation, that we are thoughtless of their origin. On these results\r\ndepend the existence of man and the lower animals. No man should be\r\nignorant of their production.\r\n\r\nIn the early prosecution of the study, you will find, perhaps, nothing\r\nto relieve its tediousness; but, when the foundation of agricultural\r\nknowledge is laid in your mind so thoroughly that you know the character\r\nand use of every stone, then may your thoughts build on it fabrics of\r\nsuch varied construction, and so varied in their uses, that there will\r\nbe opened to you a new world, even more wonderful and more beautiful\r\nthan the outward world, which exhibits itself to the senses. Thus may\r\nyou live two lives, each assisting in the enjoyment of the other.\r\n\r\nBut you may ask the _practical_ use of this. \"The world is made up of\r\nlittle things,\" saith the proverb. So with the productive arts. The\r\nsteam engine consists of many parts, each part being itself composed of\r\natoms too minute to be detected by our observation. The earth itself, in\r\nall its solidity and life, consists entirely of atoms too small to be\r\nperceived by the naked eye, each visible particle being an aggregation\r\nof thousands of constituent elements. The crop of wheat, which the\r\nfarmer raises by his labor, and sells for money, is produced by a\r\ncombination of particles equally small. They are not mysteriously\r\ncombined, nor irregularly, but each atom is taken from its place of\r\ndeposit, and carried to its required location in the living plant, by\r\nlaws as certain as those which regulate the motion of the engine, or the\r\nrevolutions of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the practical farmer to put together these\r\nmaterials, with the assistance of nature. He may learn her ways, assist\r\nher action, and succeed; or he may remain ignorant of her operations,\r\noften counteract her beneficial influences, and often fail.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the _inner_ world of material things about us will\r\nproduce pleasure to the thoughtful, and profit to the practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIRST.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT.\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--Introduction,                                            11\r\n\r\n   \"   II.--Atmosphere,                                              15\r\n\r\n   \"  III.--Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen,                          23\r\n\r\n   \"   IV.--Inorganic Matter,                                        29\r\n\r\n   \"    V.--Growth,                                                  40\r\n\r\n   \"   VI.--Proximate division of Plants,                            43\r\n\r\n   \"  VII.--Location of the Proximates, and variations in the\r\n              Ashes of Plants,                                       52\r\n\r\n   \" VIII.--Recapitulation,                                          56\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--Formation and Character of the Soil,                     65\r\n\r\n   \"   II.--Uses of Organic Matter,                                  77\r\n\r\n   \"  III.--Uses of Inorganic Matter,                                84\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THIRD.\r\n\r\nMANURES.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--Character and varieties of Manure,                       93\r\n\r\n   \"   II.--Excrements of Animals,                                   96\r\n\r\n   \"  III.--Waste of Manure,                                        101\r\n\r\n   \"   IV.--Absorbents,                                             109\r\n\r\n   \"    V.--Composting Stable Manure,                               118\r\n\r\n   \"   VI.--Different kinds of Animal Excrement,                    126\r\n\r\n   \"  VII.--Other Organic Manures,                                  136\r\n\r\n   \" VIII.--Mineral Manures,                                        149\r\n\r\n   \"   IX.--Deficiencies of Soils, means of Restoration, etc.,      155\r\n\r\n   \"    X.--Atmospheric Fertilizers,                                197\r\n\r\n   \"   XI.--Recapitulation,                                         203\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FOURTH.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--Mechanical Character of the Soil,                       209\r\n\r\n   \"   II.--Under-draining,                                         211\r\n\r\n   \"  III.--Advantages of Under-draining,                           217\r\n\r\n   \"   IV.--Sub-soil Plowing,                                       232\r\n\r\n   \"    V.--Plowing and other modes of Pulverizing the Soil,        239\r\n\r\n   \"   VI.--Rolling, Mulching, Weeding, etc.,                       245\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIFTH.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--Nature of Analysis,                                     259\r\n\r\n   \"   II.--Tables of Analysis,                                     264\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICAL FARMER,                                               279\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TERMS,                                               287\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIRST.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is the object of cultivating the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat is necessary in order to cultivate with economy?\r\n\r\nAre plants created from nothing?]\r\n\r\nThe object of cultivating the soil is to raise from it a crop of\r\n_plants_. In order to cultivate with economy, we must _raise the largest\r\npossible quantity with the least expense, and without permanent injury\r\nto the soil_.\r\n\r\nBefore this can be done we must study the character of plants, and learn\r\ntheir exact composition. They are not _created_ by a mysterious power,\r\nthey are merely made up of matters already in existence. They take up\r\nwater containing food and other matters, and discharge from their roots\r\nthose substances that are not required for their growth. It is necessary\r\nfor us to know what kind of matter is required as food for the plant,\r\nand where this is to be obtained, which we can learn only through such\r\nmeans as shall separate the elements of which plants are composed; in\r\nother words, we must _take them apart_, and examine the different pieces\r\nof which they are formed.\r\n\r\n[What must we do to learn the composition of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat takes place when vegetable matter is burned?\r\n\r\nWhat do we call the two divisions produced by burning?\r\n\r\nWhere does organic matter originate? Inorganic?\r\n\r\nHow much of chemistry should farmers know?]\r\n\r\nIf we burn any vegetable substance it disappears, except a small\r\nquantity of earthy matter, which we call _ashes_. In this way we make an\r\nimportant division in the constituents of plants. One portion dissipates\r\ninto the atmosphere, and the other remains as ashes.\r\n\r\nThat part which burns away during combustion is called _organic matter_;\r\nthe ashes are called _inorganic matter_. The organic matter has become\r\nair, and hence we conclude that it was originally obtained from air. The\r\ninorganic matter has become earth, and was obtained from the soil.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge can do us no good except by the assistance of chemistry,\r\nwhich explains the properties of each part, and teaches us where it is\r\nto be found. It is not necessary for farmers to become chemists. All\r\nthat is required is, that they should know enough of chemistry to\r\nunderstand the nature of the materials of which their crops are\r\ncomposed, and how those materials are to be used to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThis amount of knowledge may be easily acquired, and should be possessed\r\nby every person, old or young, whether actually engaged in the\r\ncultivation of the soil or not. All are dependent on vegetable\r\nproductions, not only for food, but for every comfort and convenience of\r\nlife. It is the object of this book to teach children the first\r\nprinciples of agriculture: and it contains all that is absolutely\r\nnecessary to an understanding of the practical operations of\r\ncultivation, etc.\r\n\r\n[Is organic matter lost after combustion?\r\n\r\nOf what does it consist?\r\n\r\nHow large a part of plants is carbon?]\r\n\r\nWe will first examine the _organic_ part of plants, or that which is\r\ndriven away during combustion or burning. This matter, though apparently\r\nlost, is only changed in form.\r\n\r\nIt consists of one solid substance, _carbon_ (or charcoal), and three\r\ngases, _oxygen_, _hydrogen_ and _nitrogen_. These four kinds of matter\r\nconstitute nearly the whole of most plants, the ashes forming often less\r\nthan one part in one hundred of their dry weight.\r\n\r\n[What do we mean by gas?\r\n\r\nDoes oxygen unite with other substances?\r\n\r\nGive some instances of its combinations]\r\n\r\nWhen wood is burned in a close vessel, or otherwise protected from the\r\nair, its carbon becomes charcoal. All plants contain this substance, it\r\nforming usually about one half of their dry weight. The remainder of\r\ntheir organic part consists of the three gases named above. By the word\r\ngas, we mean _air_. Oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, when pure, are always\r\nin the form of air. Oxygen has the power of uniting with many\r\nsubstances, forming compounds which are different from either of their\r\nconstituents alone. Thus: oxygen unites with _iron_ and forms oxide of\r\niron or _iron-rust_, which does not resemble the gray metallic iron nor\r\nthe gas oxygen; oxygen unites with carbon and forms carbonic acid, which\r\nis an invisible gas, but not at all like pure oxygen; oxygen combines\r\nwith hydrogen and forms water. All of the water, ice, steam, etc., are\r\ncomposed of these two gases. We know this because we can artificially\r\ndecompose, or separate, all water, and obtain as a result simply oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, or we can combine these two gases and thus form pure\r\nwater; oxygen combines with nitrogen and forms nitric acid. These\r\nchemical changes and combinations take place only under certain\r\ncircumstances, which, so far as they affect agriculture, will be\r\nconsidered in the following pages.\r\n\r\nAs the organic elements of plants are obtained from matters existing in\r\nthe atmosphere which surrounds our globe, we will examine its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is atmospheric air composed of?\r\n\r\nIn what proportions?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of nitrogen in air?\r\n\r\nDoes the atmosphere contain other matters useful to vegetation?\r\n\r\nWhat are they?]\r\n\r\nAtmospheric air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen. Their proportions\r\nare, one part of oxygen to four parts of nitrogen. Oxygen is the active\r\nagent in the combustion, decay, and decomposition of organized bodies\r\n(those which have possessed animal or vegetable life, that is, organic\r\nmatter), and others also, in the breathing of animals. Experiments have\r\nproved that if the atmosphere consisted of pure oxygen every thing would\r\nbe speedily destroyed, as the processes of combustion and decay would be\r\ngreatly accelerated, and animals would be so stimulated that death would\r\nsoon ensue. The use of the nitrogen in the air is to _dilute_ the\r\noxygen, and thus reduce the intensity of its effect.\r\n\r\nBesides these two great elements, the atmosphere contains certain\r\nimpurities which are of great importance to vegetable growth; these are,\r\n_carbonic acid, water, ammonia, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIC ACID.\r\n\r\n[What is the source of the carbon of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat is carbonic acid?\r\n\r\nWhat is its proportion in the atmosphere?\r\n\r\nWhere else is it found?\r\n\r\nHow does it enter the plant?\r\n\r\nWhat are the offices of leaves?]\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is in all probability the only source of the carbon of\r\nplants, and consequently is of more importance to vegetation than any\r\nother single sort of food. It is a gas, and is not, under natural\r\ncircumstances, perceptible to our senses. It constitutes about 1/2500 of\r\nthe atmosphere, and is found in combination with many substances in\r\nnature. Marble, limestone and chalk, are carbonate of lime, or carbonic\r\nacid and lime in combination; and carbonate of magnesia is a compound of\r\ncarbonic acid and magnesia. This gas exists in combination with many\r\nother mineral substances, and is contained in all water not recently\r\nboiled. Its supply, though small, is sufficient for the purposes of\r\nvegetation. It enters the plant in two ways--through the roots in the\r\nwater which goes to form the sap, and at the leaves, which absorb it\r\nfrom the air in the form of gas. The leaf of the plant seems to have\r\nthree offices: that of absorbing carbonic acid from the atmosphere--that\r\nof assisting in the chemical preparation of the sap--and that of\r\nevaporating its water. If we examine leaves with a microscope we shall\r\nfind that some have as many as 170,000 openings, or mouths, in a square\r\ninch; others have a much less number. Usually, the pores on the under\r\nside of the leaf absorb the carbonic acid. This absorptive power is\r\nillustrated when we apply the lower side of a cabbage leaf to a wound,\r\nas it draws strongly--the other side of the leaf has no such action.\r\nYoung sprouts may have the power of absorbing and decomposing carbonic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[What parts of roots absorb food?\r\n\r\nHow much of their carbon may plants receive through their roots?\r\n\r\nWhat change does carbonic acid undergo after entering the plant?\r\n\r\nIn what parts of the plant, and under what influence, is carbonic acid\r\ndecomposed?]\r\n\r\nThe roots of plants terminate at their ends in minute spongioles, or\r\nmouths for the absorption of fluids containing nutriment. In these\r\nfluids there exist greater or less quantities of carbonic acid, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of this gas enters into the circulation of the\r\nplants and is carried to those parts where it is required for\r\ndecomposition. Plants, under favorable circumstances, may thus obtain\r\nabout one-third of their carbon.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid, it will be recollected, consists of _carbon and oxygen_,\r\nwhile it supplies only _carbon_ to the plant. It is therefore necessary\r\nthat it be divided, or decomposed, and that the carbon be retained while\r\nthe oxygen is sent off again into the atmosphere, to reperform its\r\noffice of uniting with carbon. This decomposition takes place in the\r\n_green_ parts of plants and only under the influence of daylight. It is\r\nnot necessary that the sun shine directly on the leaf or green shoot,\r\nbut this causes a _more rapid_ decomposition of carbonic acid, and\r\nconsequently we find that plants which are well exposed to the sun's\r\nrays make the most rapid growth.\r\n\r\n[Explain the condition of different latitudes.\r\n\r\nDoes the proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere remain about the\r\nsame?]\r\n\r\nThe fact that light is essential to vegetation explains the conditions\r\nof different latitudes, which, so far as the assimilation of carbon is\r\nconcerned, are much the same. At the Equator the days are but about\r\ntwelve hours long. Still, as the growth of plants is extended over eight\r\nor nine months of the year, the duration of daylight is sufficient for\r\nthe requirements of a luxuriant vegetation. At the Poles, on the\r\ncontrary, the summer is but two or three months long; here, however, it\r\nis daylight all summer, and plants from continual growth develop\r\nthemselves in that short time.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that carbonic acid constitutes but about 1/2500\r\nof the air, yet, although about one half of all the vegetable matter in\r\nthe world is derived from this source, as well as all of the carbon\r\nrequired by the growth of plants, its proportion in the atmosphere is\r\nconstantly about the same. In order that we may understated this, it\r\nbecomes necessary for us to consider the means by which it is formed.\r\nCarbon, by the aid of fire, is made to unite with oxygen, and always\r\nwhen bodies containing carbon are burnt _with the presence of\r\natmospheric air_, the oxygen of that air unites with the carbon, and\r\nforms carbonic acid. The same occurs when bodies containing carbon\r\n_decay_, as this is simply a slower _burning_ and produces the same\r\nresults. The respiration (or breathing) of animals is simply the union\r\nof the carbon of the blood with the oxygen of the air drawn into the\r\nlungs, and their breath, when thrown out, always contains carbonic acid.\r\nFrom this we see that the reproduction of this gas is the direct effect\r\nof the destruction of all organized bodies, whether by fire, decay, or\r\nconsumption by animals.\r\n\r\n[Explain some of the operations in which this reproduction\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nHow is it reproduced?]\r\n\r\nFurnaces are its wholesale manufactories. Every cottage fire is\r\ncontinually producing a new supply, and the blue smoke issuing from the\r\ncottage-chimney, as described by so many poets, possesses a new beauty,\r\nwhen we reflect that besides indicating a cheerful fire on the hearth,\r\nit contains materials for making food for the cottager's tables and new\r\nfaggots for his fire. The wick of every burning lamp draws up the carbon\r\nof the oil to be made into carbonic acid at the flame. All matters in\r\nprocess of combustion, decay, fermentation, or putrefaction, are\r\nreturning to the atmosphere those constituents, which they obtained from\r\nit. Every living animal, even to the smallest insect, by respiration,\r\nspends its life in the production of this material necessary to the\r\ngrowth of plants, and at death gives up its body in part for such\r\nformation by decay.\r\n\r\nThus we see that there is a continual change from the carbon of plants\r\nto air, and from air back to plants, or through them to animals. As each\r\ndollar in gold that is received into a country permanently increases its\r\namount of circulating medium, and each dollar sent out permanently\r\ndecreases it until returned, so the carbonic acid sent into the\r\natmosphere by burning, decay, or respiration, becomes a permanent stock\r\nof constantly changeable material, until it shall be locked up for a\r\ntime, as in a house which may last for centuries, or in an oak tree\r\nwhich may stand for thousands of years. Still, at the decay of either of\r\nthese, the carbon which they contain must be again resolved into\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[What are the coal-beds of Pennsylvania?\r\n\r\nWhat are often found in them?]\r\n\r\nThe coal-beds of Pennsylvania are mines of carbon once abstracted from\r\nthe atmosphere by plants. In these coal-beds are often found fern\r\nleaves, toads, whole trees, and in short all forms of organized matter.\r\nThese all existed as living things before the great floods, and at the\r\nbreaking away of the barriers of the immense lakes, of which our present\r\nlakes were merely the deep holes in their beds, they were washed away\r\nand deposited in masses so great as to take fire from their chemical\r\nchanges. It is by many supposed that this fire acting throughout the\r\nentire mass (without the presence of air _to supply oxygen_ except on\r\nthe surface) caused it to become melted carbon, and to flow around those\r\nbodies which still retained their shapes, changing them to coal without\r\ndestroying their structures. This coal, so long as it retains its\r\npresent form, is lost to the vegetable kingdom, and each ton that is\r\nburned, by being changed into carbonic acid, adds to the ability of the\r\natmosphere to support an increased amount of vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Explain the manner in which they become coal.\r\n\r\nHow does the burning of coal benefit vegetation?\r\n\r\nIs carbon ever permanent in any of its forms?\r\n\r\nWhat enables it to change its condition?]\r\n\r\nThus we see that, in the provisions of nature, carbon, the grand basis,\r\non which all organized matter is founded, is never permanent in any of\r\nits forms. Oxygen is the carrier which enables it to change its\r\ncondition. For instance, let us suppose that we have a certain quantity\r\nof charcoal; this is nearly pure carbon. We ignite it, and it unites\r\nwith the oxygen of the air, becomes carbonic acid, and floats away into\r\nthe atmosphere. The wind carries it through a forest, and the leaves of\r\nthe trees with their millions of mouths drink it in. By the assistance\r\nof light it is decomposed, the oxygen is sent off to make more carbonic\r\nacid, and the carbon is retained to form a part of the tree. So long as\r\nthat tree exists in the form of wood, the carbon will remain unaltered,\r\nbut when the wood decays, or is burned, it immediately takes the form of\r\ncarbonic acid, and mingles with the atmosphere ready to be again taken\r\nup by plants, and have its carbon deposited in the form of vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Give an instance of such change.\r\n\r\nHow do plants and animals benefit each other?\r\n\r\nDescribe the experiment with the glass tube.]\r\n\r\nThe blood of animals contains carbon derived from their food. This\r\nunites with the oxygen of the air drawn into the lungs and forms\r\ncarbonic acid. Without this process, animals could not live. Thus, while\r\nby the natural operation of breathing, they make carbonic acid for the\r\nuses of the vegetable world, plants, in taking up carbon, throw off\r\noxygen to keep up the life of animals. There is perhaps no way in which\r\nwe can better illustrate the changes of form in carbon than by\r\ndescribing a simple experiment.\r\n\r\nTake a glass tube filled with oxygen gas, and put in it a lump of\r\ncharcoal, cork the ends of the tube tightly, and pass through the corks\r\nthe wires of an electrical battery. By passing a stream of electrical\r\nfluid over the charcoal it may be ignited, when it will burn with great\r\nbrilliancy. In burning it is dissolved in the oxygen forming carbonic\r\nacid, and disappears. It is no more lost, however, than is the carbon of\r\nwood which is burned in a stove; although invisible, it is still in the\r\ntube, and may be detected by careful weighing. A more satisfactory proof\r\nof its presence may be obtained by _decomposing_ the carbonic acid by\r\ndrawing the wires a short distance apart, and giving a _spark_ of\r\nelectricity. This immediately separates the oxygen from the carbon which\r\nforms a dense black smoke in the tube. By pushing the corks together we\r\nmay obtain a wafer of charcoal of the same weight as the piece\r\nintroduced. In this experiment we have changed carbon from its solid\r\nform to an invisible gas and back again to a solid, thus fully\r\nrepresenting the continual changes of this substance in the destruction\r\nof organic matter and the growth of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN, OXYGEN AND NITROGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.\r\n\r\n[What is water composed of?\r\n\r\nIf analyzed, what does it yield?\r\n\r\nHow do plants obtain their hydrogen and oxygen?]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the three gases, _hydrogen_, _oxygen_ and\r\n_nitrogen_, which constitute the remainder of the organic part of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nHydrogen and oxygen compose _water_, which, if analyzed, yields simply\r\nthese two gases. Plants perform such analysis, and in this way are able\r\nto obtain a sufficient supply of these materials, as their sap is\r\ncomposed chiefly of water. Whenever vegetable matter is destroyed by\r\nburning, decay, or otherwise, its hydrogen and oxygen unite and form\r\nwater, which is parted with usually in the form of an invisible vapor.\r\nThe atmosphere of course contains greater or less quantities of watery\r\nvapor arising from this cause and from the evaporation of liquid water.\r\nThis vapor condenses, forming rains, etc.\r\n\r\nHydrogen and oxygen are never taken into consideration in manuring\r\nlands, as they are so readily obtained from the water constituting the\r\nsap of the plant, and consequently should not occupy our attention in\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN.\r\n\r\n[If vegetable matter be destroyed, what becomes of these\r\nconstituents?\r\n\r\nWhat is the remaining organic constituent?\r\n\r\nWhy is it worthy of close attention?\r\n\r\nDo plants appropriate the nitrogen of the atmosphere?]\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_, the only remaining _organic_ constituent of vegetable\r\nmatter, is for many reasons worthy of close attention.\r\n\r\n1. It is necessary to the growth and perfection of all cultivated\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n2. It is necessary to the formation of animal muscle.\r\n\r\n3. It is often deficient in the soil.\r\n\r\n4. It is liable to be easily lost from manures.\r\n\r\nAlthough about four fifths of atmospheric air are pure nitrogen, it is\r\nalmost certain that plants get no nutriment at all from this source. It\r\nis all obtained from some of its compounds, chiefly from the one called\r\nammonia. Nitric acid is also a source from which plants may obtain\r\nnitrogen, though to the farmer of less importance than ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA.\r\n\r\n[What is the principal source from which they obtain nitrogen?\r\n\r\nWhat is ammonia?\r\n\r\nHow is it formed?\r\n\r\nWhere does it always exist?\r\n\r\nHow do plants take up ammonia?]\r\n\r\n_Ammonia_ is composed of nitrogen and hydrogen. It has a pungent smell\r\nand is familiarly known as _hartshorn_. The same odor is perceptible\r\naround stables and other places where animal matter is decomposing. All\r\nanimal muscle, certain parts of plants, and other organized substances,\r\nconsist of compounds containing nitrogen. When these compounds undergo\r\ncombustion, or are in any manner decomposed, the nitrogen which they\r\ncontain usually unites with hydrogen, and forms ammonia. In consequence\r\nof this the atmosphere always contains more or less of this gas, arising\r\nfrom the decay, etc., which is continually going on all over the world.\r\n\r\nThis ammonia in the atmosphere is the capital stock to which all plants,\r\nnot artificially manured, must look for their supply of nitrogen. As\r\nthey can take up ammonia only through their roots, we must discover\r\nsome means by which it may be conveyed from the atmosphere to the soil.\r\n\r\n[Does water absorb it?\r\n\r\nWhat is _spirits of hartshorn_?\r\n\r\nWhy is this power of water important in agriculture?\r\n\r\nWhat instance may be cited to prove this?]\r\n\r\nWater may be made to absorb many times its bulk of this gas, and water\r\nwith which it comes in contact will immediately take it up. Spirits of\r\nhartshorn is merely water through which ammonia has been passed until it\r\nis saturated.[A] This power of water has a direct application to\r\nagriculture, because the water constituting rains, dews, &c., absorbs\r\nthe ammonia which the decomposition of nitrogenous matter had sent into\r\nthe atmosphere, and we find that all rain, snow and dew, contain\r\nammonia. This fact may be chemically proved in various ways, and is\r\nperceptible in the common operations of nature. Every person must have\r\nnoticed that when a summer's shower falls on the plants in a flower\r\ngarden, they commence their growth with fresh vigor while the blossoms\r\nbecome larger and more richly colored. This effect cannot be produced by\r\nwatering with spring water, unless it be previously mixed with ammonia,\r\nin which case the result will be the same.\r\n\r\nAlthough ammonia is a gas and pervades the atmosphere, few, if any,\r\nplants can take it up, as they do carbonic acid, through their leaves.\r\nIt must all enter through the roots in solution in the water which goes\r\nto form the sap. Although the amount received from the atmosphere is of\r\ngreat importance, there are few cases where artificial applications are\r\nnot beneficial. The value of farm-yard and other animal manures, depends\r\nchiefly on the ammonia which they yield on decomposition. This subject,\r\nalso the means for retaining in the soil the ammoniacal parts of\r\nfertilizing matters, will be fully considered in the section on manures.\r\n\r\n[Can plants use more ammonia than is received from the\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\nOn what does the value of animal manure chiefly depend?\r\n\r\nWhat changes take place after ammonia enters the plant?\r\n\r\nMay the same atom of nitrogen perform many different offices?]\r\n\r\nAfter ammonia has entered the plant it may be decomposed, its hydrogen\r\nsent off, and its nitrogen retained to answer the purposes of growth.\r\nThe changes which nitrogen undergoes, from plants to animals, or, by\r\ndecomposition, to the form of ammonia in the atmosphere, are as varied\r\nas those of carbon and the constituents of water. The same little atom\r\nof nitrogen may one year form a part of a plant, and the next become a\r\nconstituent of an animal, or, with the decomposed dead animal, may form\r\na part of the soil. If the animal should fall into the sea he may become\r\nfood for fishes, and our atom of nitrogen may form a part of a fish.\r\nThat fish may be eaten by a larger one, or at death may become food for\r\nthe whale, through the marine insect, on which it feeds. After the\r\nabstraction of the oil from the whale, the nitrogen may, by the\r\nputrefaction of his remains, be united to hydrogen, form ammonia, and\r\nescape into the atmosphere. From here it may be brought to the soil by\r\nrains, and enter into the composition of a plant, from which, could its\r\nparts speak as it lies on our table, it could tell us a wonderful tale\r\nof travels, and assure us that, after wandering about in all sorts of\r\nplaces, it had returned to us the same little atom of nitrogen which we\r\nhad owned twenty years before, and which for thousands of years had been\r\ncontinually going through its changes.\r\n\r\n[Is the same true of the other constituents of plants?\r\n\r\nIs any atom of matter ever lost?]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of any of the organic or inorganic constituents of\r\nplants. They are performing their natural offices, or are lying in the\r\nearth, or floating in the atmosphere, ready to be lent to _any_ of their\r\nlegitimate uses, sure again to be returned to their starting point.\r\n\r\nThus no atom of matter is ever lost. It may change its place, but it\r\nremains for ever as a part of the capital of nature.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] By _saturated_, we mean that it contains all that it is capable of\r\nholding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINORGANIC MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What are ashes called?\r\n\r\nHow many kinds of matter are there in the ashes of plants?\r\n\r\nInto what three classes may they be divided?\r\n\r\nWhat takes place when alkalies and acids are brought together?]\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the ashes left after burning vegetable substances.\r\nThis we have called inorganic matter, and it is obtained from the soil.\r\nOrganic matter, although forming so large a part of the plant, we have\r\nseen to consist of four different substances. The inorganic portion, on\r\nthe contrary, although forming so small a part, consists of no less than\r\n_nine_ or _ten_ different kinds of matter.[B] These we will consider in\r\norder. In their relations to agriculture they may be divided into\r\n_three_ classes--_alkalies_, _acids_, and _neutrals_.[C]\r\n\r\n[Is the character of a compound the same as that of its\r\nconstituents?\r\n\r\nGive an instance of this.\r\n\r\nDo neutrals combine with other substances?\r\n\r\nName the four alkalies found in the ashes of plants.]\r\n\r\nAlkalies and acids are of opposite properties, and when brought together\r\nthey unite and neutralize each other, forming compounds which are\r\nneither alkaline nor acid in their character. Thus, carbonic acid (a\r\ngas,) unites with lime--a burning, caustic substance--and forms marble,\r\nwhich is a hard tasteless stone. Alkalies and acids are characterized\r\nby their desire to unite with each other, and the compounds thus formed\r\nhave many and various properties, so that the characters of the\r\nconstituents give no indication of the character of the compound. For\r\ninstance, lime causes the gases of animal manure to escape, while\r\nsulphate of lime (a compound of sulphuric acid and lime) produces an\r\nopposite effect, and prevents their escape.\r\n\r\nThe substances coming under the signification of neutrals, are less\r\naffected by the laws of combination, still they often combine feebly\r\nwith other substances, and some of the resultant compounds are of great\r\nimportance to agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES.\r\n\r\nThe alkalies which are found in the ashes of plants are four in number;\r\nthey are _potash_, _soda_, _lime_ and _magnesia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH.\r\n\r\n[How may we obtain potash from ashes?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of its agricultural uses?]\r\n\r\nWhen we pour water over wood ashes it dissolves the _potash_ which they\r\ncontain, and carries it through in solution. This solution is called\r\n_ley_, and if it be boiled to dryness it leaves a solid substance from\r\nwhich pure potash may be made. Potash left exposed to the air absorbs\r\ncarbonic acid and becomes carbonate of potash, or _pearlash_; if another\r\natom of carbonic acid be added, it becomes super-carbonate of potash, or\r\n_salæratus_. Potash has many uses in agriculture.\r\n\r\n1. It forms a constituent of nearly all plants.\r\n\r\n2. It unites with silica (a neutral), and forms a compound which water\r\ncan dissolve and carry into the roots of plants; thus supplying them\r\nwith an ingredient which gives them much of their strength.[D]\r\n\r\n3. It is a strong agent in the decomposition of vegetable matter, and is\r\nthus of much importance in preparing manures.\r\n\r\n4. It roughens the smooth round particles of sandy soils, and prevents\r\ntheir compacting, as they are often liable to do.\r\n\r\n5. It is also of use in killing certain kinds of insects, and, when\r\nartificially applied, in smoothing the bark of fruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe source from which this and the other inorganic matters required are\r\nto be obtained, will be fully considered in the section on manures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA.\r\n\r\n[Where is soda found most largely?\r\n\r\nWhat is Glauber's salts?\r\n\r\nWhat is washing soda?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the uses of lime?]\r\n\r\n_Soda_, one of the alkalies contained in the ashes of plants, is very\r\nmuch the same as potash in its agricultural character. Its uses are the\r\nsame as those of potash--before enumerated. Soda exists very largely in\r\nnature, as it forms an important part of common salt, whether in the\r\nocean or in those inland deposits known as rock salt. When combined with\r\nsulphuric acid it forms sulphate of soda or _Glauber's salts_. In\r\ncombination with carbonic acid, as carbonate of soda, it forms the\r\ncommon washing soda of the shops. It is often necessary to render soils\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\n_Lime_ is in many ways important in agriculture:\r\n\r\n1. It is a constituent of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n2. It assists in the decomposition of vegetable matter in the soil.\r\n\r\n3. It corrects the acidity[E] of sour soils.\r\n\r\n4. As chloride or sulphate of lime it is a good absorbent of fertilizing\r\ngases.\r\n\r\n[How is caustic lime made?\r\n\r\nHow much carbonic acid is thus liberated?\r\n\r\nHow does man resemble Sinbad the sailor?]\r\n\r\nIn nature it usually exists in the form of carbonate of lime: that is,\r\nas marble, limestone, and chalk--these all being of the same\r\ncomposition. In manufacturing caustic (or quick) lime, it is customary\r\nto burn the carbonate of lime in a kiln; by this means the carbonic acid\r\nis thrown off into the atmosphere and the lime remains in a pure or\r\ncaustic state. A French chemist states that every cubic yard of\r\nlimestone that is burned, throws off _ten thousand_ cubic yards of\r\ncarbonic acid, which may be used by plants. This reminds us of the story\r\nof Sinbad the sailor, where we read of the immense _genie_ who came out\r\nof a very small box by the sea-shore, much to the surprise of Sinbad,\r\nwho could not believe his eyes, until the _genie_ changed himself into a\r\ncloud of smoke and went into the box again. Sinbad fastened the lid, and\r\nthe _genie_ must have remained there until the box was destroyed.\r\n\r\nNow man is very much like Sinbad, he lets the carbonic acid out from the\r\nlimestone (when it expands and becomes a gas); and then he raises a\r\ncrop, the leaves of which drink it in and pack the carbon away in a very\r\nsmall compass as vegetable matter. Here it must remain until the plant\r\nis destroyed, when it becomes carbonic acid again, and occupies just as\r\nmuch space as ever.\r\n\r\nThe burning of limestone is a very prolific source of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNESIA.\r\n\r\n[What do you know about magnesia?\r\n\r\nWhat is phosphoric acid composed of?\r\n\r\nWith what substance does it form its most important compound?]\r\n\r\n_Magnesia_ is the remaining alkali of vegetable ashes. It is well known\r\nas a medicine, both in the form of calcined magnesia, and, when mixed\r\nwith sulphuric acid, as epsom salts.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is necessary to nearly all plants, but too much of it is\r\npoisonous, and it should be used with much care, as many soils already\r\ncontain a sufficient quantity. It is often found in limestone rocks\r\n(that class called _dolomites_), and the injurious effects of some kinds\r\nof lime, as well as the barrenness of soils made from dolomites, may be\r\nattributed entirely to the fact that they contain too much magnesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDS.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORIC ACID.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid._--This subject is one of the greatest interest to the\r\nfarmer. Phosphoric acid is composed of phosphorus and oxygen. The end\r\nof a loco-foco match contains phosphorus, and when it is lighted it\r\nunites with the oxygen of the atmosphere and forms phosphoric acid; this\r\nconstitutes the white smoke which is seen for a moment before the\r\nsulphur commences burning. Being an acid, this substance has the power\r\nof combining with any of the alkalies. Its most important compound is\r\nwith lime.\r\n\r\n[Will soils, deficient in phosphate of lime, produce good\r\ncrops?\r\n\r\nFrom what source do plants obtain their phosphorus?]\r\n\r\n_Phosphate of lime_ forms about 65 per cent. of the dry weight of the\r\nbones of all animals, and it is all derived from the soil through the\r\nmedium of plants. As plants are intended as food for animals, nature has\r\nprovided that they shall not attain their perfection without taking up a\r\nsupply of phosphate of lime as well as of the other earthy matters;\r\nconsequently, there are many soils which will not produce good crops,\r\nsimply because they are deficient in phosphate of lime. It is one of the\r\nmost important ingredients of manures, and its value is dependent on\r\ncertain conditions which will be hereafter explained.\r\n\r\nAnother use of phosphoric acid in the plant is to supply it with a small\r\namount of _phosphorus_, which seems to be required in the formation of\r\nthe seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHURIC ACID.\r\n\r\n[What is sulphuric acid composed of?\r\n\r\nWhat is plaster?\r\n\r\nWhat is silica?\r\n\r\nWhy is it necessary to the growth of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat compounds does it form with alkalies?]\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ is important to vegetation and is often needed to\r\nrender soils fertile. It is composed of sulphur and oxygen, and is made\r\nfor manufacturing purposes, by burning sulphur. With lime it forms\r\n_sulphate of lime_, which is gypsum or 'plaster.' In this form it is\r\noften found in nature, and is generally used in agriculture. Other\r\nimportant methods for supplying sulphuric acid will be described\r\nhereafter. It gives _to_ the plant a small portion of _sulphur_, which\r\nis necessary to the formation of some of its parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUTRALS.\r\n\r\nSILICA.\r\n\r\n[How can you prove its existence in corn stalks?\r\n\r\nWhat instance does Liebig give to show its existence in grass?\r\n\r\nHow do we supply silicates?\r\n\r\nWhy does grain lodge?\r\n\r\nWhat is the most important compound of chlorine?]\r\n\r\nThis is sand, the base of flint. It is necessary for the growth of all\r\nplants, as it gives them much of their strength. In connection with an\r\nalkali it constitutes the hard shining surface of corn stalks, straw,\r\netc. Silica unites with the alkalies and forms compounds, such as\r\n_silicate of potash_, _silicate of soda, etc._, which are soluble in\r\nwater, and therefore available to plants. If we roughen a corn stalk\r\nwith sand-paper we may sharpen a knife upon it. This is owing to the\r\nhard particles of silica which it contains. Window glass is silicate of\r\npotash, rendered insoluble by additions of arsenic and litharge.\r\n\r\nLiebig tells us that some persons discovered, between Manheim and\r\nHeidelberg in Germany, a mass of melted glass where a hay-stack had been\r\nstruck by lightning. They supposed it to be a meteor, but chemical\r\nanalysis showed that it was only the compound of silica and potash which\r\nserved to strengthen the grass.\r\n\r\nThere is always _enough_ silica in the soil, but it is often necessary\r\nto add an alkali to render it available. When grain, etc., lodge or fall\r\ndown from their own weight, it is altogether probable that they are\r\nunable to obtain from the soil a sufficient supply of the soluble\r\nsilicates, and some form of alkali should be added to the soil to unite\r\nwith the sand and render it soluble.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORINE.\r\n\r\n[Of what use is chloride of lime?\r\n\r\nWhat is oxide of iron?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between the _per_oxide and the _prot_oxide of\r\niron?]\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_ is an important ingredient of vegetable ashes, and is often\r\nrequired to restore the balance to the soil. It is not found alone in\r\nnature, but is always in combination with other substances. Its most\r\nimportant compound is with sodium, forming _chloride of sodium_ (or\r\ncommon salt). Sodium is the base of soda, and common salt is usually the\r\nbest source from which to obtain both soda and chlorine. Chlorine unites\r\nwith lime and forms _chloride of lime_, which is much used to absorb the\r\nunpleasant odors of decaying matters, and in this character it is of use\r\nin the treatment of manures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDE OF IRON.\r\n\r\n_Oxide of iron_, one of the constituents of ashes, is common iron rust.\r\n_Iron_ itself is naturally of a grayish color, but when exposed to the\r\natmosphere, it readily absorbs oxygen and forms a reddish compound. It\r\nis in this form that it usually exists in nature, and many soils as well\r\nas the red sandstones are colored by it. It is seldom, if ever,\r\nnecessary to apply this as a manure, there being usually enough of it in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThis red oxide of iron, of which we have been speaking, is called by\r\nchemists the _peroxide_. There is another compound which contains less\r\noxygen than this, and is called the _protoxide of iron_, which is\r\npoisonous to plants. When it exists in the soil it is necessary to use\r\nsuch means of cultivation as shall expose it to the atmosphere and allow\r\nit to take up more oxygen and become the peroxide. The black scales\r\nwhich fly from hot iron when struck by the blacksmith's hammer are\r\nprotoxide of iron.\r\n\r\nThe _peroxide of iron_ is a very good absorbent of ammonia, and\r\nconsequently, as will be hereafter described, adds to the fertility of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n[What can you say of the oxide of manganese?\r\n\r\nHow do you classify the inorganic constituents?]\r\n\r\nOXIDE OF MANGANESE, though often found in small quantities in the ashes\r\nof cultivated plants, cannot be considered indispensable.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined all of the materials from which the ashes of plants\r\nare formed,[F] we are enabled to classify them in a simple manner, so\r\nthat they may be recollected. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\nALKALIES.    ACIDS.          NEUTRALS.\r\n\r\nPotash.    Sulphuric acid.   Silica.\r\nSoda.      Phosphoric \"      Chlorine.\r\nLime.                        Oxide of Iron.\r\nMagnesia.                      \"  Manganese.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] Bromine, iodine, etc., are sometimes detected in particular plants,\r\nbut need not occupy the attention of the farmer.\r\n\r\n[C] This classification is not strictly scientific, but it is one which\r\nthe learner will find it well to adopt. These bodies are called neutrals\r\nbecause they have no decided alkaline or acid character.\r\n\r\n[D] In some soils the _fluorides_ undoubtedly supply plants with soluble\r\nsilicates, as _fluoric acid_ has the power of dissolving silica. Thus,\r\nin Derbyshire (England), where the soil is supplied with fluoric acid,\r\ngrain is said never to lodge.\r\n\r\n[E] Sourness.\r\n\r\n[F] There is reason to suppose that _alumina_ is an essential\r\nconstituent of many plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Of what does a perfect young plant consist?\r\n\r\nHow must the food of plants be supplied?\r\n\r\nCan carbon and earthy matter be taken up at separate stages of growth,\r\nor must they both be supplied at once?]\r\n\r\nHaving examined the materials of which plants are made, it becomes\r\nnecessary to discover how they are put together in the process of\r\ngrowth. Let us therefore suppose a young wheat-plant for instance to be\r\nin condition to commence independent growth.\r\n\r\nIt consists of roots which are located in the soil; leaves which are\r\nspread in the air, and a stem which connects the roots and leaves. This\r\nstem contains sap vessels (or tubes) which extend from the ends of the\r\nroots to the surfaces of the leaves, thus affording a passage for the\r\nsap, and consequently allowing the matters taken up to be distributed\r\nthroughout the plant.\r\n\r\n[What seems to be nature's law with regard to this?\r\n\r\nWhat is the similarity between making a cart and raising a crop?\r\n\r\nIn the growth of a young plant, what operations take place about the\r\nsame time?]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the materials of which plants are made should be\r\nsupplied in certain proportions, and at the same time. For instance,\r\ncarbon could not be taken up in large quantities by the leaves, unless\r\nthe roots, at the same time, were receiving from the soil those mineral\r\nmatters which are necessary to growth. On the other hand, no\r\nconsiderable amount of earthy matter could be appropriated by the roots\r\nunless the leaves were obtaining carbon from the air. This same rule\r\nholds true with regard to all of the constituents required; Nature\r\nseeming to have made it a law that if one of the important ingredients\r\nof the plant is absent, the others, though they may be present in\r\nsufficient quantities, cannot be used. Thus, if the soil is deficient in\r\npotash, and still has sufficient quantities of all of the other\r\ningredients, the plant cannot take up these ingredients, because potash\r\nis necessary to its life.\r\n\r\nIf a farmer wishes to make a cart he prepares his wood and iron, gets\r\nthem all in the proper condition, and then can very readily put them\r\ntogether. But if he has all of the _wood_ necessary and no _iron_, he\r\ncannot make his cart, because bolts, nails and screws are required, and\r\ntheir place cannot be supplied by boards. This serves to illustrate the\r\nfact that in raising plants we must give them every thing that they\r\nrequire, or they will not grow at all.\r\n\r\nIn the case of our young plant the following operations are going on at\r\nabout the same time.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are absorbing carbonic acid from the atmosphere, and the\r\nroots are drinking in water from the soil.\r\n\r\n[What becomes of the carbonic acid?\r\n\r\nHow is the sap disposed of?\r\n\r\nWhat does it contain?\r\n\r\nHow does the plant obtain its carbon?\r\n\r\nIts oxygen and hydrogen?\r\n\r\nIts nitrogen?\r\n\r\nIts inorganic matter?]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of daylight, the carbonic acid is decomposed; its\r\noxygen returned to the atmosphere, and its carbon retained in the plant.\r\n\r\nThe water taken in by the roots circulates through the sap vessels of\r\nthe plant, and, from various causes, is drawn up towards the leaves\r\nwhere it is evaporated. This water contains the _nitrogen_ and the\r\n_inorganic matter_ required by the plant and some carbonic acid, while\r\nthe water itself consists of _hydrogen_ and _oxygen_.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the plant obtains its food in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nCARBON.--In the form of _carbonic acid_ from the atmosphere, and from\r\n           that contained in the sap, the oxygen being returned to the\r\n           air.\r\n\r\nOXYGEN   } From the elements of the water constituting the sap.\r\n   &     }\r\nHYDROGEN.}\r\n\r\nNITROGEN.--From the soil (chiefly in form of ammonia). It is carried\r\n           into the plant through the roots in solution in water.\r\n\r\nINORGANIC} From the soil, and only _in solution_ in water.\r\nMATTER.  }\r\n\r\n[What changes does the food taken up by the plant undergo?]\r\n\r\nMany of the chemical changes which take place in the interior of the\r\nplant are well understood, but they require too much knowledge of\r\nchemistry to be easily comprehended by the young learner, and it is not\r\nabsolutely essential that they should be understood by the scholar who\r\nis merely learning the _elements_ of the science.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to say that the food taken up by the plant undergoes\r\nsuch changes as are required for its growth; as in animals, where the\r\nfood taken into the stomach, is digested, and formed into bone, muscle,\r\nfat, hair, etc., so in the plant the nutritive portions of the sap are\r\nresolved into wood, bark, grain, or some other necessary part.\r\n\r\nThe results of these changes are of the greatest importance in\r\nagriculture, and no person can call himself a _practical farmer_ who\r\ndoes not thoroughly understand them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROXIMATE DIVISION OF PLANTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto examined what is called the _ultimate_ division of\r\nplants. That is, we have looked at each one of the elements separately,\r\nand considered its use in vegetable growth.\r\n\r\n[Of what do wood, starch and the other vegetable compounds\r\nchiefly consist?\r\n\r\nAre their small ashy parts important?\r\n\r\nWhat are these compounds called?\r\n\r\nInto how many classes may proximate principles be divided?\r\n\r\nOf what do the first class consist? The second?\r\n\r\nWhat vegetable compounds do the first class comprise?]\r\n\r\nWe will now examine another division of plants, called their _proximate\r\ndivision_. We know that plants consist of various substances, such as\r\nwood, gum, starch, oil, etc., and on examination we shall discover that\r\nthese substances are composed of the various _organic_ and _inorganic_\r\ningredients described in the preceding chapters. They are made up almost\r\nentirely of _organic_ matter, but their ashy parts, though very small,\r\nare (as we shall soon see) sometimes of great importance.\r\n\r\nThese compounds are called _proximate principles_,[G] or _vegetable\r\nproximates_. They may be divided into two classes.\r\n\r\nThe first class are composed of _carbon_, _hydrogen_, and _oxygen_.\r\n\r\nThe second class contain the same substances and _nitrogen_.\r\n\r\n[Are these substances of about the same composition?\r\n\r\nCan they be artificially changed from one to another?\r\n\r\nGive an instance of this.\r\n\r\nIs the ease with which these changes take place important?\r\n\r\nFrom what may the first class of proximates be formed?]\r\n\r\nThe first class (those compounds not containing nitrogen) comprise the\r\nwood, starch, gum, sugar, and fatty matter which constitute the greater\r\npart of all plants, also the acids which are found in sour fruits, etc.\r\nVarious as are all of these things in their characters, they are\r\nentirely composed of the same ingredients (carbon, hydrogen and oxygen),\r\nand usually combined in about the _same proportion_. There may be a\r\nslight difference in the composition of their _ashes_, but the organic\r\npart is much the same in every case, so much so, that they can often be\r\nartificially changed from one to the other.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this, it may be recollected by those who attended the\r\nFair of the American Institute, in 1834, that Prof. Mapes exhibited\r\nsamples of excellent sugar made from the juice of the cornstalk, starch,\r\nlinen, and woody fibre.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which these proximates may be changed from one to the\r\nother is their most important agricultural feature, and should be\r\nclearly understood before proceeding farther. It is one of the\r\nfundamental principles on which the growth of both vegetables depends.\r\n\r\nThe proximates of the first class constitute usually the greater part of\r\nall plants, and they are readily formed from the carbonic acid and water\r\nwhich in nature are so plentifully supplied.\r\n\r\n[Why are those of the second class particularly important to\r\nfarmers?\r\n\r\nWhat is the general name under which they are known?\r\n\r\nWhat is the protein of wheat called?\r\n\r\nWhy is flour containing much gluten preferred by bakers?\r\n\r\nCan protein be formed without nitrogen?\r\n\r\nIf plants were allowed to complete their growth without a supply of this\r\ningredient, what would be the result?]\r\n\r\nThe _second class_ of proximates, though forming only a small part of\r\nthe plant, are of the greatest importance to the farmer, being the ones\r\nfrom which _animal muscle_[H] is made. They consist, as will be\r\nrecollected, of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and _nitrogen_, or of _all_ of\r\nthe organic elements of plants. They are all of much the same character,\r\nthough each kind of plant has its peculiar form of this substance, which\r\nis known under the general name of _protein_.\r\n\r\nThe protein of wheat is called _gluten_--that of Indian corn is\r\n_zein_--that of beans and peas is _legumin_. In other plants the protein\r\nsubstances are _vegetable albumen_, _casein_, etc.\r\n\r\nGluten absorbs large quantities of water, which causes it to swell to a\r\ngreat size, and become full of holes. Flour which contains much gluten,\r\nmakes light, porous bread, and is preferred by bakers, because it\r\nabsorbs so large an amount of water.\r\n\r\n[What is the result if a field be deficient in nitrogen?]\r\n\r\nThe protein substances are necessary to animal and vegetable life, and\r\nnone of our cultivated plants will attain maturity (complete their\r\ngrowth), unless allowed the materials required for forming this\r\nconstituent. To furnish this condition is the object of nitrogen given\r\nto plants as manure. If no _nitrogen_ is supplied the protein\r\nsubstances cannot be formed, and the plant must cease to grow.\r\n\r\nWhen on the contrary _ammonia_ is given to the soil (by rains or\r\notherwise), it furnishes nitrogen, while the carbonic acid and water\r\nyield the other constituents of protein, and a healthy growth continues,\r\nprovided that the soil contains the _mineral_ matters required in the\r\nformation of the ash, in a condition to be useful.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this provision is evident when we recollect that the\r\nprotein substances are necessary to the formation of muscle in animals,\r\nfor if plants were allowed to complete their growth without a supply of\r\nthis ingredient, our grain and hay might not be sufficiently well\r\nsupplied with it to keep our oxen and horses in working condition, while\r\nunder the existing law plants must be of nearly a uniform quality (in\r\nthis respect), and if a field is short of nitrogen, its crop will not be\r\nlarge, and of a very poor quality, but the soil will produce good plants\r\nas long as the nitrogen lasts, and then the growth must cease.[I]\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThat this principle may be clearly understood, it may be well to explain\r\nmore fully the application of the proximate constituents of plants in\r\nfeeding animals.\r\n\r\n[Of what are the bodies of animals composed?\r\n\r\nWhat is the office of vegetation?\r\n\r\nWhat part of the animal is formed from the first class of proximates?\r\n\r\nFrom the second?\r\n\r\nWhich contains the largest portions of inorganic matter, plants or\r\nanimals?\r\n\r\nMust animals have a variety of food, and why?]\r\n\r\nAnimals are composed (like plants) of organic and inorganic matter, and\r\nevery thing necessary to build them up exists in plants. It seems to be\r\nthe office of the vegetable world to prepare the gases in the\r\natmosphere, and the minerals in the earth for the uses of animal life,\r\nand to effect this plants put these gases and minerals together in the\r\nform of the various _proximates_ (or compound substances) which we have\r\njust described.\r\n\r\nIn animals the compounds containing _no nitrogen_ comprise the fatty\r\nsubstances, parts of the blood, etc., while the protein compound, or\r\nthose which _do contain nitrogen_, form the muscle, a part of the bones,\r\nthe hair, and other portions of the animal.\r\n\r\nAnimals contain a larger proportion of inorganic matter than plants do.\r\nBones contain a large quantity of phosphate of lime, and we find other\r\ninorganic materials performing important offices in the system.\r\n\r\nIn order that animals may be perfectly developed, they must of course\r\nreceive as food all of the materials required to form their bodies. They\r\ncannot live if fed entirely on one ingredient. Thus, if _starch_ alone\r\nbe eaten by the animal, he might become _fat_, but his strength would\r\nsoon fail, because his food contains nothing to keep up the vigor of his\r\n_muscles_. If on the contrary the food of an animal consisted entirely\r\nof _gluten_, he might be very strong from a superior development of\r\nmuscle, but would not be fat. Hence we see that in order to keep up the\r\nproper proportion of both fat and muscle in our animals (or in\r\nourselves), the food must be such as contains a proper proportion of the\r\ntwo kinds of proximates.\r\n\r\n[Why is grain good for food?\r\n\r\nOn what does the value of flour depend?\r\n\r\nIs there any relation between the ashy part of plants and those of\r\nanimals?\r\n\r\nHow may we account for unhealthy bones and teeth?]\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that grain, such as wheat for instance, is so good\r\nfor food. It contains both classes of proximates, and furnishes material\r\nfor the formation of both fat and muscle. The value of _flour_ depends\r\nvery much on the manner in which it is manufactured. This will be soon\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n[What is a probable cause of consumption?\r\n\r\nWhat is an important use of the first class of proximates?\r\n\r\nWhat may lungs be called?\r\n\r\nExplain the production of heat during decomposition.\r\n\r\nWhy is the heat produced by decay not perceptible?]\r\n\r\nApart from the relations between the _proximate principles_ of plants,\r\nand those of animals, there exists an important relation between their\r\n_ashy_ or _inorganic_ parts; and, food in order to satisfy the demands\r\nof animal life, must contain the mineral matter required for the\r\npurposes of that life. Take bones for instance. If phosphate of lime is\r\nnot always supplied in sufficient quantities by food, animals are\r\nprevented from the formation of healthy bones. This is particularly to\r\nbe noticed in teeth. Where food is deficient of phosphate of lime, we\r\nsee poor teeth as a result. Some physicians have supposed that one of\r\nthe causes of consumption is the deficiency of phosphate of lime in\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[Why is the heat produced by combustion apparent?\r\n\r\nExplain the production of heat in the lungs of animals?\r\n\r\nWhy does exercise augment the animal heat?\r\n\r\nUnder what circumstances is the animal's own fat used in the production\r\nof heat?]\r\n\r\nThe first class of proximates (starch, sugar, gum, etc.), perform an\r\nimportant office in the animal economy aside from their use in making fat.\r\nThey constitute the _fuel_ which supplies the animal's fire, and gives him\r\nhis _heat_. The lungs of men and other animals may be called delicate\r\n_stoves_, which supply the whole body with heat. But let us explain this\r\nmatter more fully. If wood, starch, gum, or sugar, be burned in a stove,\r\nthey produce heat. These substances consist, as will be recollected, of\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and when they are destroyed in any way\r\n(provided they be exposed to the atmosphere), the hydrogen and oxygen unite\r\nand form water, and the carbon unites with the oxygen of the air and forms\r\ncarbonic acid, as was explained in a preceding chapter. This process is\r\nalways accompanied by the liberation of _heat_, and the _intensity_ of this\r\nheat depends on the _time_ occupied in its _production_. In the case of\r\ndecay, the chemical changes take place so slowly that the heat, being\r\nconducted away as soon as formed, is not perceptible to our senses. In\r\ncombustion (or burning) the same changes take place with much greater\r\nrapidity, and the same _amount_ of heat being concentrated, or brought out\r\nin a far shorter time, it becomes intense, and therefore apparent. In the\r\nlungs of animals the same law holds true. The blood contains matters\r\nbelonging to this carbonaceous class, and they undergo in the lungs the\r\nchanges which have been described under the head of combustion and decay.\r\nTheir hydrogen and oxygen unite, and form the moisture of the breath, while\r\ntheir carbon is combined with the oxygen of the air drawn into the lungs,\r\nand is thrown out as carbonic acid. The same consequence--heat--results in\r\nthis, as in the other cases, and this heat is produced with sufficient\r\nrapidity for the animal necessities. When an animal exercises violently,\r\nhis blood circulates with increased rapidity, thus carrying carbon more\r\nrapidly to the lungs. The breath also becomes quicker, thus supplying\r\nincreased quantities of oxygen. In this way the decomposition becomes more\r\nrapid, and the animal is heated in proportion.\r\n\r\nThus we see that food has another function besides that of forming\r\nanimal matter, namely to supply heat. When the food does not contain a\r\nsufficient quantity of starch, sugar, etc., to answer the demands of\r\nthe system the _animal's own fat_ is carried to the lungs, and there\r\nused in the production of heat. This important fact will be referred to\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] By _proximate principle_, we mean that combination of vegetable\r\nelements which is known as a vegetable product, such as _wood_, etc.\r\n\r\n[H] _Muscle_ is _lean meat_, it gives to animals their strength and\r\nability to perform labor.\r\n\r\n[I] This, of course, supposes that the soil is fertile in other\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF THE PROXIMATES AND VARIATIONS IN THE ASHES OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Of what proximate are plants chiefly composed?\r\n\r\nWhat is the principal constituent of the potato root?\r\n\r\nOf the carrot and turnip?\r\n\r\nWhat part of the plant contains usually the most nutriment?]\r\n\r\nLet us now examine plants with a view to learning the _location_ of the\r\nvarious plants.\r\n\r\nThe stem or trunk of the plant or tree consists almost entirely of\r\n_woody fibre_; this also forms a large portion of the other parts except\r\nthe seeds, and, in some instances, the roots. The roots of the potato\r\ncontain large quantities of _starch_. Other roots such as the _carrot_\r\nand _turnip_ contain _pectic acid_,[J] a nutritious substance resembling\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\nIt is in the _seed_ however that the more nutritive portions of most\r\nplants exist, and here they maintain certain relative positions which\r\nit is well to understand, and which can be best explained by reference\r\nto the following figures, as described by Prof. Johnston:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n\"Thus _a_ shows the position of the oil in the outer part of the\r\nseed--it exists in minute drops, inclosed in six-sided cells, which\r\nconsists chiefly of gluten; _b_, the position and comparative quantity\r\nof the starch, which in the heart of the seed is mixed with only a small\r\nproportion of gluten; _c_, the germ or chit which contains much\r\ngluten.\"[K]\r\n\r\n[Is the composition of the inorganic matter of different parts\r\nof the plant the same, or different?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between the ash of the straw and that of the\r\ngrain of wheat?]\r\n\r\nThe location of the _inorganic_ part of plants is one of much interest,\r\nand shows the adaptation of each part to its particular use. Take a\r\nwheat plant, for instance--the stalk, the leaf, and the grain, show in\r\ntheir ashes, important difference of composition. The stalk or straw\r\ncontains three or four times as large a proportion of ash as the grain,\r\nand a no less remarkable difference of composition may be noticed in\r\nthe ashes of the two parts. In that of the straw, we find a large\r\nproportion of silica and scarcely any phosphoric acid, while in that of\r\nthe grain there is scarcely a trace of silica, although phosphoric acid\r\nconstitutes more than one half of the entire weight. The leaves contain\r\na considerable quantity of lime.\r\n\r\n[What is the reason for this difference?\r\n\r\nIn what part of the grain does phosphoric acid exist most largely?]\r\n\r\nThis may at first seem an unimportant matter, but on examination we\r\nshall see the use of it. The straw is intended to support the grain and\r\nleaves, and to convey the sap from the roots to the upper portions of\r\nthe plant. To perform these offices, _strength_ is required, and this is\r\ngiven by the _silica_, and the woody fibre which forms so large a\r\nproportion of the stalk. The silica is combined with an alkali, and\r\nconstitutes the glassy coating of the straw. While the plant is young,\r\nthis coating is hardly apparent, but as it grows older, as the grain\r\nbecomes heavier, (verging towards ripeness), the silicious coating of\r\nthe stalk assumes a more prominent character, and gives to the straw\r\nsufficient strength to support the golden head. The straw is not the\r\nmost important part of the plant as _food_, and therefore requires but\r\nlittle phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n[Why is Graham flour more wholesome than fine flour?\r\n\r\nAre the ashes of all plants the same in their composition?]\r\n\r\nThe grain, on the contrary, is especially intended as food, and\r\ntherefore must contain a large proportion of phosphoric acid--this\r\nbeing, as we have already learned, necessary to the formation of\r\nbone--while, as it has no necessity for strength, and as silica is not\r\nneeded by animals, this ingredient exists in the grain only in a very\r\nsmall proportion. It may be well to observe that the phosphoric acid of\r\ngrain exists most largely in the hard portions near the shell, or bran.\r\nThis is one of the reasons why Graham flour is more wholesome than fine\r\nflour. It contains all of the nutritive materials which render the grain\r\nvaluable as food, while flour which is very finely bolted[L] contains\r\nonly a small part of the outer portions of the grain (where the\r\nphosphoric acid, protein and fatty matters exist most largely). The\r\nstarchy matter in the interior of the grain, which is the least capable\r\nof giving strength to the animal, is carefully separated, and used as\r\nfood for man, while the better portions, not being ground so finely, are\r\nrejected. This one thing alone may be sufficient to account for the\r\nfact, that the lives of men have become shorter and less blessed with\r\nhealth and strength, than they were in the good old days when a stone\r\nmortar and a coarse sieve made a respectable flour mill.\r\n\r\nAnother important fact concerning the ashes of plants is the difference\r\nof their composition in different plants. Thus, the most prominent\r\ningredient in the ash of the potato is _potash_; of wheat and other\r\ngrains, _phosphoric acid_; of meadow hay, _silica_; of clover, _lime_;\r\nof beans, _potash_, etc. In grain, _potash_ (or _soda_), etc., are among\r\nthe important ingredients.\r\n\r\n[Of what advantage are these differences to the farmer?\r\n\r\nOf what are plants composed?]\r\n\r\nThese differences are of great importance to the practical farmer, as by\r\nunderstanding what kind of plants use the most of one ingredient, and\r\nwhat kind requires another in large proportion, he can regulate his\r\ncrops so as to prevent his soil from being exhausted more in one\r\ningredient than in the others, and can also manure his land with\r\nreference to the crop which he intends to grow. The tables of analyses\r\nin the fifth section will point out these differences accurately.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[J] This pectic acid gelatinizes food in the stomach, and thus renders\r\nit more digestible.\r\n\r\n[K] See Johnston's Elements, page 41.\r\n\r\n[L] Sifted through a fine cloth called a bolting cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now learned as much about the plant as is required for our\r\nimmediate uses, and we will carefully reconsider the various points with\r\na view to fixing them permanently in the mind.\r\n\r\nPlants are composed of _organic_ and _inorganic_ matter.\r\n\r\n[What is organic matter? Inorganic?\r\n\r\nOf what does organic matter consist? Inorganic?\r\n\r\nHow do plants obtain their organic food?\r\n\r\nHow their inorganic?\r\n\r\nHow is ammonia supplied? Carbonic acid?]\r\n\r\nOrganic matter is that which burns away in the fire. Inorganic matter is\r\nthe ash left after burning.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter of plants consists of three gases, oxygen, hydrogen\r\nand nitrogen, and one solid substance carbon (or charcoal). The\r\ninorganic matter of plants consists of potash, soda, lime, magnesia,\r\nsulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, chlorine, silica, oxide of iron, and\r\noxide of manganese.\r\n\r\nPlants obtain their organic food as follows:--Oxygen and hydrogen from\r\nwater, nitrogen from some compound containing nitrogen (chiefly from\r\nammonia), and carbon from the atmosphere where it exists as carbonic\r\nacid--a gas.\r\n\r\nThey obtain their inorganic food from the soil.\r\n\r\nThe water which supplies oxygen and hydrogen to plants is readily\r\nobtained without the assistance of manures.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is obtained from the atmosphere, by being absorbed by rain and\r\ncarried into the soil, and it enters plants through their roots. It may\r\nbe artificially supplied in the form of animal manure with profit.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is absorbed from the atmosphere by leaves, and decomposed\r\nin the green parts of plants under the influence of daylight; the carbon\r\nis retained, and the oxygen is returned to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[When plants are destroyed by combustion or decay, what\r\nbecomes of their constituents?\r\n\r\nHow does the inorganic matter enter the plant?\r\n\r\nAre the alkalies soluble in their pure forms?\r\n\r\nWhich one of them is injurious when too largely present?\r\n\r\nHow may sulphuric acid be supplied?\r\n\r\nIs phosphoric acid important?\r\n\r\nHow must silica be treated?\r\n\r\nFrom what source may we obtain chlorine?]\r\n\r\nWhen plants are destroyed by decay, or burning, their organic\r\nconstituents pass away as water, ammonia, carbonic acid, etc., ready\r\nagain to be taken up by other plants.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic matters in the soil can enter the plant only when\r\ndissolved in water. _Potash_, _soda_, _lime_, and _magnesia_, are\r\nsoluble in their pure forms. Magnesia is injurious when present in too\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric_ acid is often necessary as a manure, and is usually most\r\navailable in the form of sulphate of lime or plaster. It is also\r\nvaluable in its pure form to prevent the escape of ammonia from\r\ncomposts.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric_ acid is highly important, from its frequent deficiency in\r\nworn-out soils. It is available only under certain conditions which will\r\nbe described in the section on manures.\r\n\r\n_Silica_ is the base of common sand, and must be united to an alkali\r\nbefore it can be used by the plant, because it is insoluble except when\r\nso united.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_ is a constituent of common salt (chloride of sodium), and\r\nfrom this source may be obtained in sufficient quantities for manurial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[What is the difference between _per_oxide and _prot_oxide of\r\niron?\r\n\r\nHow must the food of plants be supplied?\r\n\r\nWhat takes place after it enters the plant?\r\n\r\nWhat name is given to the compounds thus formed?\r\n\r\nHow are proximates divided?\r\n\r\nWhich class constitutes the largest part of the plant?\r\n\r\nOf what are animals composed, and how do they obtain the materials from\r\nwhich to form their growth?]\r\n\r\n_Oxide of iron_ is iron rust. There are two oxides of iron, the\r\n_peroxide_ (red) and the _protoxide_ (black). The former is a\r\nfertilizer, and the latter poisons plants.\r\n\r\n_Oxide of manganese_ is often absent from the ashes of our cultivated\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe food of plants, both organic and inorganic, must be supplied in\r\ncertain proportions, and at the time when it is required. In the plant,\r\nthis food undergoes such chemical changes as are necessary to growth.\r\n\r\nThe compounds formed by these chemical combinations are called\r\n_proximates_.\r\n\r\nProximates are of two classes, those not containing nitrogen, and those\r\nwhich do contain it.\r\n\r\nThe first class constitute nearly the whole plant.\r\n\r\nThe second class, although small in quantity, are of the greatest\r\nimportance to the farmer, as from them all animal muscle is made.\r\n\r\nAnimals, like plants, are composed of both organic and inorganic matter,\r\nand their bodies are obtained directly or indirectly from plants.\r\n\r\n[What parts of the animal belong to the first class of\r\nproximates?\r\n\r\nWhat to the second?\r\n\r\nWhat is necessary to the perfect development of animals?\r\n\r\nWhy are seeds valuable for working animals?\r\n\r\nWhat other important use, in animal economy, have proximates of the\r\nfirst class?\r\n\r\nUnder what circumstances is animal fat decomposed?]\r\n\r\nThe first class of proximates in animals comprise the fat, and like\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThe second class form the muscle, hair, gelatine of the bones, etc.\r\n\r\nIn order that they may be perfectly developed, animals must eat both\r\nclasses of proximates, and in the proportions required by their natures.\r\n\r\nThey require the phosphate of lime and other inorganic food which exist\r\nin plants.\r\n\r\nSeeds are the best adapted to the uses of working animals, because they\r\nare rich in all kinds of food required.\r\n\r\nAside from their use in the formation of _fat_, proximates of the first\r\nclass are employed in the lungs, as fuel to keep up animal heat, which\r\nis produced (as in fire and decay) by the decomposition of these\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the food is insufficient for the purposes of heat, the animal's own\r\nfat is decomposed, and carried to the lungs as fuel.\r\n\r\nThe stems, roots, branches, etc., of most plants consist principally of\r\n_woody fibre_.\r\n\r\nTheir seeds, and sometimes their roots, contain considerable quantities\r\nof _starch_.\r\n\r\n[Name the parts of the plant in which the different proximates\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nState what you know about flour.\r\n\r\nDo we know that different plants have ashes of different composition?]\r\n\r\nThe _protein_ and the _oils_ of most plants exist most largely in the\r\n_seeds_.\r\n\r\nThe location of the proximates, as well as of the inorganic parts of the\r\nplant, show a remarkable reference to the purposes of growth, and to the\r\nwants of the animal world, as is noticed in the difference between the\r\nconstruction of the straw and that of the kernel of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the fine flour now made is not so healthfully nutritious\r\nas that which contained more of the coarse portions, is that it is\r\nrobbed of a large proportion of protein and phosphate of lime, while it\r\ncontains an undue amount of starch, which is available only to form fat,\r\nand to supply fuel to the lungs.\r\n\r\nDifferent plants have ashes of different composition. Thus--one may take\r\nfrom the soil large quantities of potash, another of phosphoric acid,\r\nand another of lime.\r\n\r\nBy understanding these differences, we shall be able so to regulate our\r\nrotations, that the soil may not be called on to supply more of one\r\ningredient than of another, and thus it may be kept in balance.\r\n\r\n[How are farmers to be benefited by such knowledge?]\r\n\r\nThe facts contained in this chapter are the _alphabet of agriculture_,\r\nand the learner should not only become perfectly familiar with them, but\r\nshould also clearly understand the _reasons_ why they are true, before\r\nproceeding further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFORMATION AND CHARACTER OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is a necessary condition of growth?]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing section, we have studied the character of plants and\r\nthe laws which govern their growth. We learned that one necessary\r\ncondition for growth is a fertile soil, and therefore we will examine\r\nthe nature of different soils, in order that we may understand the\r\nrelations between them and plants.\r\n\r\n[What is a fixed character of soils?\r\n\r\nHow is the chemical character of the soil to be ascertained?\r\n\r\nWhat do we first learn in analyzing a soil?\r\n\r\nHow do the proportions of organic or inorganic parts of soils compare\r\nwith those of plants?\r\n\r\nOf what does the organic part of soils consist?]\r\n\r\nThe soil is not to be regarded as a mysterious mass of dirt, whereon\r\ncrops are produced by a mysterious process. Well ascertained scientific\r\nknowledge has proved beyond question that all soils, whether in America\r\nor Asia, whether in Maine or California, have certain fixed properties,\r\nwhich render them fertile or barren, and the science of agriculture is\r\nable to point out these characteristics in all cases, so that we can\r\nascertain from a scientific investigation what would be the chances for\r\nsuccess in cultivating any soil which we examine.\r\n\r\nThe soil is a great chemical compound, and its chemical character is\r\nascertained (as in the case of plants) by analyzing it, or taking it\r\napart.\r\n\r\nWe first learn that fertile soils contain both organic and inorganic\r\nmatter; but, unlike the plant, they usually possess much more of the\r\nlatter than of the former.\r\n\r\nIn the plant, the organic matter constitutes the most considerable\r\nportion of the whole. In the soil, on the contrary, it usually exists in\r\nvery small quantities, while the inorganic portions constitute nearly\r\nthe whole bulk.\r\n\r\n[Can the required proportion be definitely indicated?\r\n\r\nFrom what source is the inorganic part of soils derived?\r\n\r\nDo all soils decompose with equal facility?\r\n\r\nHow does frost affect rocks?\r\n\r\nDoes it affect soils in the same way?]\r\n\r\nThe organic part of soils consists of the same materials that constitute\r\nthe organic part of the plants, and it is in reality decayed vegetable\r\nand animal matter. It is not necessary that this organic part of the\r\nsoil should form any particular proportion of the whole, and indeed we\r\nfind it varying from one and a half to fifty, and sometimes, in peaty\r\nsoils, to over seventy per cent. All fertile soils contain some organic\r\nmatter, although it seems to make but little difference in fertility,\r\nwhether it be ten or fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic part of soils is derived from the crumbling of rocks. Some\r\nrocks (such as the slates in Central New York) decompose, and crumble\r\nrapidly on being exposed to the weather; while granite, marble, and\r\nother rocks will last for a long time without perceptible change. The\r\n_causes_ of this crumbling are various, and are not unimportant to the\r\nagriculturist; as by the same processes by which his soil was formed, he\r\ncan increase its depth, or otherwise improve it. This being the case, we\r\nwill in a few words explain some of the principal pulverizing agents.\r\n\r\n1. The action of frost. When water lodges in the crevices of rocks, and\r\n_freezes_, it expands, and bursts the rock, on the same principle as\r\ncauses it to break a pitcher in winter. This power is very great, and by\r\nits assistance, large cannon may be burst. Of course the action of frost\r\nis the same on a small scale as when applied to large masses of matter,\r\nand, therefore, we find that when water freezes in the _pores_[M] of\r\nrocks or stones, it separates their particles and causes them to\r\ncrumble. The same rule holds true with regard to stiff clay soils. If\r\nthey are _ridged_ in autumn, and left with a rough surface exposed to\r\nthe frosts of winter, they will become much lighter, and can afterwards\r\nbe worked with less difficulty.\r\n\r\n[What is the effect of water on certain rocks?\r\n\r\nHow are some rocks affected by exposure to the atmosphere? Give an\r\ninstance of this.]\r\n\r\n2. The action of water. Many kinds of rock become so soft on being\r\nsoaked with water, that they readily crumble.\r\n\r\n3. The chemical changes of the constituents of the rock. Many kinds of\r\nrock are affected by exposure to the atmosphere, in such a manner, that\r\nchanges take place in their chemical character, and cause them to fall\r\nto pieces. The red kellis of New Jersey (a species of sandstone), is,\r\nwhen first quarried, a very hard stone, but on exposure to the\r\ninfluences of the atmosphere, it becomes so soft that it may be easily\r\ncrushed between the thumb and finger.\r\n\r\n[What is the similarity between the composition of soils and\r\nthe rocks from which they were formed?\r\n\r\nWhat does feldspar rock yield? Talcose slate? Marls?\r\n\r\nDoes a soil formed entirely from rock contain organic matter?\r\n\r\nHow is it affected by the growth of plants?]\r\n\r\nOther actions, of a less simple kind, exert an influence on the\r\nstubbornness of rocks, and cause them to be resolved into soils.[N] Of\r\ncourse, the composition of the soil must be similar to that of the rock\r\nfrom which it was formed; and, consequently, if we know the chemical\r\ncharacter of the rock, we can tell whether the soil formed from it can\r\nbe brought under profitable cultivation. Thus feldspar, on being\r\npulverized, yields potash; talcose slate yields magnesia; marls yield\r\nlime, etc.\r\n\r\nThe soil formed entirely from rock, contains, of course, no organic\r\nmatter.[O] Still it is capable of bearing plants of a certain class, and\r\nwhen these die, they are deposited in the soil, and thus form its\r\norganic portions, rendering it capable of supporting those plants which\r\nfurnish food for animals. Thousands of years must have been occupied in\r\npreparing the earth for habitation by man.\r\n\r\nAs the inorganic or mineral part of the soil is usually the largest, we\r\nwill consider it first.\r\n\r\nAs we have stated that this portion is formed from rocks, we will\r\nexamine their character, with a view to showing the different qualities\r\nof soils.\r\n\r\n[What is the general rule concerning the composition of rocks?\r\n\r\nDo these distinctions affect the fertility of soils formed from them?\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by the mechanical character of the soil?\r\n\r\nIs its fertility indicated by its mechanical character?]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it may be stated that _all rocks are either\r\nsandstones, limestones, or clays; or a mixture of two or more of these\r\ningredients_. Hence we find that all mineral soils are either _sandy_,\r\n_calcareous_, (limey), or _clayey_; or consist of a mixture of these, in\r\nwhich one or another usually predominates. Thus, we speak of a sandy\r\nsoil, a clay soil, etc. These distinctions (sandy, clayey, loamy, etc.)\r\nare important in considering the _mechanical_ character of the soil, but\r\nhave little reference to its fertility.\r\n\r\nBy _mechanical_ character, we mean those qualities which affect the ease\r\nof cultivation--excess or deficiency of water, ability to withstand\r\ndrought, etc. For instance, a heavy clay soil is difficult to\r\nplow--retains water after rains, and bakes quite hard during drought;\r\nwhile a light sandy soil is plowed with ease, often allows water to pass\r\nthrough immediately after rains, and becomes dry and powdery during\r\ndrought. Notwithstanding those differences in their mechanical\r\ncharacter, both soils may be very fertile, or one more so than the\r\nother, without reference to the clay and sand which they contain, and\r\nwhich, to _our observation_, form their leading characteristics. The\r\nsame facts exist with regard to a loam, a calcareous (or limey) soil, or\r\na vegetable mould. Their mechanical texture is not essentially an index\r\nto their fertility, nor to the manures required to enable them to\r\nfurnish food to plants. It is true, that each kind of soil appears to\r\nhave some general quality of fertility or barrenness which is well known\r\nto practical men, yet this is not founded on the fact that the clay or\r\nthe sand, or the vegetable matter, enter more largely into the\r\nconstitution of plants than they do when they are not present in so\r\ngreat quantities, but on certain other facts which will be hereafter\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n[What is a sandy soil? A clay soil? A loamy soil? A marl? A\r\ncalcareous soil? A peaty soil?]\r\n\r\nAs the following names are used to denote the character of soils, in\r\nordinary agricultural description, we will briefly explain their\r\napplication:\r\n\r\nA _Sandy soil_ is, of course, one in which sand largely predominates.\r\n\r\n_Clay soil_, one where _clay_ forms a large proportion of the soil.\r\n\r\n_Loamy soil_, where sand and clay are about equally mixed.\r\n\r\n_Marl_ contains from five to twenty per cent. of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous soil_ more than twenty per cent.\r\n\r\n_Peaty soils_, of course, contain large quantities of organic matter.[P]\r\n\r\n\r\n[How large a part of the soil may be used as food by plants?\r\n\r\nWhat do we learn from the analyses of barren and fertile soils?]\r\n\r\nWe will now take under consideration that part of the soil on which\r\ndepends its ability to supply food to the plant. This portion rarely\r\nconstitutes more than five or ten per cent. of the entire soil,\r\nsometimes less--and it has no reference to the sand, clay, and vegetable\r\nmatters which they contain. From analyses of many fertile soils, and of\r\nothers which are barren or of poorer quality, it has been ascertained\r\nthat the presence of certain ingredients is necessary to fertility. This\r\nmay be better explained by the assistance of the following table:\r\n\r\n ---------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------\r\n  In one hundred pounds.    | Soil fertile |  Good       | Barren.\r\n                            | without      | wheat soil. |\r\n                            | manure.      |             |\r\n ---------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------\r\n Organic matter,            |  9.7         |  7.0        |  4.0\r\n Silica (sand),             | 64.8         | 74.3        | 77.8\r\n Alumina (clay),            |  5.7         |  5.5        |  9.1\r\n Lime,                      |  5.9         |  1.4        |   .4\r\n Magnesia,                  |   .9         |   .7        |   .1\r\n Oxide of iron,             |  6.1         |  4.7        |  8.1\r\n Oxide of manganese,        |   .1         |             |   .1\r\n Potash,                    |   .2         |  1.7        |\r\n Soda,                      |   .4         |   .7        |\r\n Chlorine,                  |   .2         |   .1        |\r\n Sulphuric acid,            |   .2         |   .1        |\r\n Phosphoric acid,           |   .4         |   .1½       |\r\n Carbonic acid,             |  4.0         |             |\r\n Loss during the analysis   |  1.4         |  3.6½       |   .4\r\n                            +--------------+-------------+----------\r\n                            |100.0         |100.0        |100.0\r\n ---------------------------+--------------+-------------+----------\r\n\r\n[What can you say of the soils represented in the table of\r\nanalyses?\r\n\r\nWhat proportion of the fertilizing ingredients is required?\r\n\r\nIf the soil represented in the third column contained all the\r\ningredients required except potash and soda, would it be fertile?\r\n\r\nWhat would be necessary to make it so?\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason for this?\r\n\r\nWhat are the offices performed by the inorganic part of soils?]\r\n\r\nThe soil represented in the first column might still be fertile with\r\nless organic matter, or with a larger proportion of clay (alumina), and\r\nless sand (silica). These affect its _mechanical_ character; but, if we\r\nlook down the column, we notice that there are small quantities of lime,\r\nmagnesia, and the other constituents of the ashes of plants (except ox.\r\nof manganese). It is not necessary that they should be present in the\r\nsoil in the exact quantity named above, but _not one must be entirely\r\nabsent, or greatly reduced in proportion_. By referring to the third\r\ncolumn, we see that these ingredients are not all present, and the soil\r\nis barren. Even if it were supplied with all but one or two, potash and\r\nsoda for instance, it could not support a crop without the assistance of\r\nmanures containing these alkalies. The reason for this must be readily\r\nseen, as we have learned that no plant can arrive at maturity without\r\nthe necessary supply of materials required in the formation of the ash,\r\nand these materials can be obtained only from the soil; consequently,\r\nwhen they do not exist there, it must be barren.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic part of soils has two distinct offices to perform. The\r\nclay and sand form a mass of material into which roots can penetrate,\r\nand thus plants are supported in their position. These parts also absorb\r\nheat, air and moisture to serve the purposes of growth, as we shall see\r\nin a future chapter. The minute portions of soil, which comprise the\r\nacids, alkalies, and neutrals, furnish plants with their ashes, and are\r\nthe most necessary to the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n[What is geology?\r\n\r\nIs the same kind of rock always of the same composition?\r\n\r\nHow do rocks differ?]\r\n\r\nThe relation between the inorganic part of soils and the rocks from\r\nwhich it was formed, is the foundation of Agricultural Geology. Geology\r\nmay be briefly named the _science of rocks_. It would not be proper in\r\nan elementary work to introduce much of this study, and we will\r\ntherefore simply state that the same kind of rock is of the same\r\ncomposition all over the world; consequently, if we find a soil in New\r\nEngland formed from any particular rock, and a soil from the same rock\r\nin Asia, their natural fertility will be the same in both localities.\r\nSome rocks consist of a mixture of different kinds of minerals; and\r\nsome, consisting chiefly of one ingredient, are of different degrees of\r\n_hardness_. Both of these changes must affect the character of the soil,\r\nbut it may be laid down as rule that, _when the rocks of two locations\r\nare exactly alike, the soils formed from them will be of the same\r\nnatural fertility, and in proportion as the character of rocks changes,\r\nin the same proportion will the soils differ_.\r\n\r\n[What rule may be given in relation to soils formed from the\r\nsame or different rocks?\r\n\r\nAre all soils formed from the rocks on which they lie?\r\n\r\nWhat instances can you give of this?]\r\n\r\nIn most districts the soil is formed from the rock on which it lies; but\r\nthis is not always the case. Soils are often formed by deposits of\r\nmatter brought by water from other localities. Thus the alluvial banks\r\nof rivers consist of matters brought from the country through which the\r\nrivers have passed. The river Nile, in Egypt, yearly overflows its\r\nbanks, and deposits large quantities of mud brought from the uninhabited\r\nupper countries. The prairies of the West owe a portion of their soil to\r\ndeposits by water. Swamps often receive the washings of adjacent hills;\r\nand, in these cases, their soil is derived from a foreign source.\r\n\r\nWe might continue to enumerate instances of the relations between soils\r\nand the sources whence they originated, thus demonstrating more fully\r\nthe importance of geology to the farmer; but it would be beyond the\r\nscope of this work, and should be investigated by scholars more advanced\r\nthan those who are studying merely the _elements_ of agricultural\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe mind, in its early application to any branch of study, should not\r\nbe charged with intricate subjects. It should master well the\r\n_rudiments_, before investigating those matters which should _follow_\r\nsuch understanding.\r\n\r\n[In what light will plants and soils be regarded by those who\r\nunderstand them?]\r\n\r\nBy pursuing the proper course, it is easy to learn all that is necessary\r\nto form a good foundation for a thorough acquaintance with the subject.\r\nIf this foundation is laid thoroughly, the learner will regard plants\r\nand soils as old acquaintances, with whose formation and properties he\r\nis as familiar as with the construction of a building or simple machine.\r\nA simple spear of grass will become an object of interest, forming\r\nitself into a perfect plant, with full development of roots, stem,\r\nleaves, and seeds, by processes with which he feels acquainted. The soil\r\nwill cease to be mere dirt; it will be viewed as a compound substance,\r\nwhose composition is a matter of interest, and whose care is productive\r\nof intellectual pleasure. The commencement of study in any science must\r\nnecessarily be wearisome to the young mind, but its more advanced stages\r\namply repay the trouble of early exertions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] The spaces between the particles.\r\n\r\n[N] In very many instances the crevices and seams of rocks are permeated\r\nby roots, which, by decaying and thus inducing the growth of other\r\nroots, cause these crevices to become filled with organic matter. This,\r\nby the absorption of moisture, may expand with sufficient power to burst\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\n[O] Some rocks contain sulphur, phosphorus, etc., and these may,\r\nperhaps, be considered as organic matter.\r\n\r\n[P] These distinctions are not essential to be learned, but are often\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUSES OF ORGANIC MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What proportion of organic matter is required for fertility?\r\n\r\nHow does the soil obtain its organic matter?\r\n\r\nHow does the growth of clover, etc., affect the soil?]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that, in addition to its mineral portions, the\r\nsoil contains organic matter in varied quantities. It may be fertile\r\nwith but one and a half per cent. of organic matter, and some peaty\r\nsoils contain more than fifty per cent. or more than one half of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe precise amount necessary cannot be fixed at any particular sum;\r\nperhaps five parts in a hundred would be as good a quantity as could be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nThe soil obtains its organic matter in two ways. First, by the decay of\r\nroots and dead plants, also of leaves, which have been brought to it by\r\nwind, etc. Second, by the application of organic manures.\r\n\r\n[When organic matter decays in the soil, what becomes of it?\r\n\r\nIs charcoal taken up by plants?\r\n\r\nAre humus and humic acid of great practical importance?]\r\n\r\nWhen a crop of clover is raised, it obtains its carbon from the\r\natmosphere; and, if it be plowed under, and allowed to decay, a portion\r\nof this carbon is deposited in the soil. Carbon constitutes nearly the\r\nwhole of the dry weight of the clover, aside from the constituents of\r\nwater; and, when we calculate the immense quantity of hay, and roots\r\ngrown on an acre of soil in a single season, we shall find that the\r\namount of carbon thus deposited is immense. If the clover had been\r\nremoved, and the roots only left to decay, the amount of carbon\r\ndeposited would still have been very great. The same is true in all\r\ncases where the crop is removed, and the roots remain to form the\r\norganic or vegetable part of the soil. While undergoing decomposition, a\r\nportion of this matter escapes in the form of gas, and the remainder\r\nchiefly assumes the form of carbon (or charcoal), in which form it will\r\nalways remain, without loss, unless driven out by fire. If a bushel of\r\ncharcoal be mixed with the soil now, it will be the same bushel of\r\ncharcoal, neither more nor less, a thousand years hence, unless some\r\ninfluence is brought to bear on it aside from the growth of plants. It\r\nis true that, in the case of the decomposition of organic matter in the\r\nsoil, certain compounds are formed, known under the general names of\r\n_humus_ and _humic acid_, which may, in a slight degree, affect the\r\ngrowth of plants, but their practical importance is of too doubtful a\r\ncharacter to justify us in considering them. The application of manures,\r\ncontaining organic matter, such as peat, muck, animal manure, etc.,\r\nsupplies the soil with carbon on the same principle, and the decomposing\r\nmatters also generate[Q] carbonic acid gas while being decomposed. The\r\nagricultural value of carbon in the soil depends (as we have stated),\r\nnot on the fact that it enters into the composition of plants, but on\r\ncertain other important offices which it performs, as follows:--\r\n\r\n[On what does the agricultural value of the carbon in the soil\r\ndepend?\r\n\r\nWhy does it make the soil more retentive of manure?\r\n\r\nWhat is the experiment with the barrels of sand?]\r\n\r\n1. It makes the soil more retentive of manures.\r\n\r\n2. It causes it to appropriate larger quantities of the fertilizing\r\ngases of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3. It gives it greater power to absorb moisture.\r\n\r\n4. It renders it warmer.\r\n\r\n1. Carbon (or charcoal) makes the soil retentive of manures, because it\r\nhas in itself a strong power to absorb, and retain[R] fertilizing\r\nmatters. There is a simple experiment by which this power can be shown.\r\n\r\nEx.--Take two barrels of pure beach sand, and mix with the sand in one\r\nbarrel a few handfuls of charcoal dust, leaving that in the other pure.\r\nPour the brown liquor of the barn-yard through the pure sand, and it\r\nwill pass out at the bottom unaltered. Pour the same liquor through the\r\nbarrel, containing the charcoal, and pure water will be obtained as a\r\nresult. The reason for this is that the charcoal retains all of the\r\nimpurities of the liquor, and allows only the water to pass through.\r\nCharcoal is often employed to purify water for drinking, or for\r\nmanufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\n[Will charcoal purify water?\r\n\r\nIf a piece of tainted meat, or a fishy duck be buried in a rich garden\r\nsoil, what takes place?\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason of this?\r\n\r\nHow does charcoal overcome offensive odors?\r\n\r\nHow can you prove that charcoal absorbs the _mineral_ impurities of\r\nwater?]\r\n\r\nA rich garden-soil contains large quantities of carbonaceous matter;\r\nand, if we bury in such a soil a piece of tainted meat or a fishy duck,\r\nit will, in a short time, be deprived of its odor, because the charcoal\r\nin the soil will entirely absorb it.\r\n\r\nCarbon absorbs gases as well as the impurities of water; and, if a\r\nlittle charcoal be sprinkled over manure, or any other substance,\r\nemitting offensive odors, the gases escaping will be taken up by the\r\ncharcoal, and the odor will cease.\r\n\r\nIt has also the power of absorbing _mineral_ matters, which are\r\ncontained in water. If a quantity of salt water be filtered through\r\ncharcoal, the salt will be retained, and the water will pass through\r\npure.\r\n\r\nWe are now able to see how carbon renders the soil retentive of manures.\r\n\r\n1st. Manures, which resemble the brown liquor of barn-yards, have their\r\nfertilizing matters taken out, and retained by it.\r\n\r\n[How does charcoal in the soil affect the manures applied?\r\n\r\nWhy does charcoal in the soil cause it to appropriate the gases of the\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\nWhat fertilizing gases exist in the atmosphere?\r\n\r\nHow are they carried to the soil?\r\n\r\nDoes the carbon retain them after they reach the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of the air circulating through the soil?\r\n\r\nHow does carbon give the soil power to absorb moisture?]\r\n\r\n2d. The gases arising from the decomposition (_rotting_) of manure are\r\nabsorbed by it.\r\n\r\n3d. The soluble mineral portions of manure, which might in some soils\r\nleach down with water, are arrested and retained at a point at which\r\nthey can be made use of by the roots of plants.\r\n\r\n2. Charcoal in the soil causes it to appropriate larger quantities of\r\nthe fertilizing gases of the atmosphere, on account of its power, as\r\njust named, to absorb gases.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere contains results, which have been produced by the\r\nbreathing of animals and by the decomposition of various kinds of\r\norganic matter, which are exposed to atmospheric influences. These gases\r\nare chiefly ammonia and carbonic acid, both of which are largely\r\nabsorbed by water, and consequently are contained in rain, snow, etc.,\r\nwhich, as they enter the soil, give up these gases to the charcoal, and\r\nthey there remain until required by plants. Even the air itself, in\r\ncirculating through the soil, gives up fertilizing gases to the carbon,\r\nwhich it may contain.\r\n\r\n3. Charcoal gives to the soil power to absorb moisture, because it is\r\nitself one of the best absorbents in nature; and it has been proved by\r\naccurate experiment that peaty soils absorb moisture with greater\r\nrapidity, and part with it more slowly than any other kind.\r\n\r\n[How does it render it warmer?\r\n\r\nIs the heat produced by the decomposition of organic matter perceptible\r\nto our senses?\r\n\r\nIs it so to the growing plant?\r\n\r\nWhat is another important part of the organic matter in the soil?]\r\n\r\n4. Carbon in the soil renders it warmer, because it darkens its color.\r\nBlack surfaces absorb more heat than light ones, and a black coat, when\r\nworn in the sun, is warmer than one of a lighter color. By mixing carbon\r\nwith the soil, we darken its color, and render it capable of absorbing a\r\ngreater amount of heat from the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that, when vegetable matter decomposes in the\r\nsoil, it produces certain gases (carbonic acid, etc.), which either\r\nescape into the atmosphere, or are retained in the soil for the use of\r\nplants. The production of these gases is always accompanied by _heat_,\r\nwhich, though scarcely perceptible to our senses, is perfectly so to the\r\ngrowing plant, and is of much practical importance. This will be\r\nexamined more fully in speaking of manures.\r\n\r\n[How is it obtained by the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat offices does the organic matter in the soil perform?]\r\n\r\nAnother important part of the organic matter in the soil is that which\r\ncontains _nitrogen_. This forms but a very small portion of the soil,\r\nbut it is of the greatest importance to vegetables. As the nitrogen in\r\nfood is of absolute necessity to the growth of animals, so the nitrogen\r\nin the soil is indispensable to the growth of cultivated plants. It is\r\nobtained by the soil in the form of ammonia (or nitric acid), from the\r\natmosphere, or by the application of animal matter. In some cases,\r\nmanures called _nitrates_[S] are used; and, in this manner, nitrogen is\r\ngiven to the soil.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned that the organic matter in the soil performs the\r\nfollowing offices:--\r\n\r\nOrganic matter thoroughly decomposed is _carbon_, and has the various\r\neffects ascribed to this substance on p. 79.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter in process of decay produces carbonic acid, and sometimes\r\nammonia in the soil; also its decay causes heat.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter containing _nitrogen_, such as animal substances, etc.,\r\nfurnish ammonia, and other nitrogenous substances to the roots of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Q] Produce.\r\n\r\n[R] By absorbing and retaining, we mean taking up and holding.\r\n\r\n[S] Nitrates are compounds of nitric acid (which consists of nitrogen\r\nand oxygen), and alkaline substances. Thus nitrate of potash\r\n(saltpetre), is composed of nitric acid and potash: nitrate of soda\r\n(cubical nitre), of nitric acid and soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nUSES OF INORGANIC MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What effect has clay besides the one already named?\r\n\r\nHow does it compare with charcoal for this purpose?]\r\n\r\nThe offices performed by the inorganic constituents of the soil are many\r\nand important.\r\n\r\nThese, as well as the different conditions in which the bodies exist,\r\nare necessary to be thoroughly studied.\r\n\r\nThose parts which constitute the larger proportion of the soil, namely\r\nthe clay, sand, and limy portions, are useful for purposes which have\r\nbeen named in the first part of this section, while the _clay_ has an\r\nadditional effect in the absorption of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, it is as effectual as charcoal, the gases escaping\r\nfrom manures, as well as those existing in the atmosphere, and in\r\nrain-water, being arrested by clay as well as charcoal.[T]\r\n\r\n[What particular condition of inorganic matter is requisite\r\nfor fertility?\r\n\r\nWhat is the fixed rule with regard to this?\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of the alkalies in most of their combinations? Of\r\nthe acids?\r\n\r\nWhat is said of phosphate of lime?]\r\n\r\nThe more minute ingredients of the soil--those which enter into the\r\nconstruction of plants--exist in conditions which are more or less\r\nfavorable or injurious to vegetable growth. The principal condition\r\nnecessary to fertility is _capacity to be dissolved_, it being (so far\r\nas we have been able to ascertain) a fixed rule, as was stated in the\r\nfirst section, that _no mineral substance can enter into the roots of a\r\nplant except it be dissolved in water_.\r\n\r\nThe _alkalies_ potash, soda, lime, and magnesia, are in nearly all of\r\ntheir combinations in the soil sufficiently soluble for the purposes of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe _acids_ are, as will be recollected, sulphuric and phosphoric. These\r\nexist in the soil in combination with the alkalies, as sulphates and\r\nphosphates, which are more or less soluble under natural circumstances.\r\nPhosphoric acid in combination with lime as phosphate of lime is but\r\nslightly soluble; but, when it exists in the compound known as\r\n_super_-phosphate of lime, it is much more soluble, and consequently\r\nenters into the composition of plants with much greater facility. This\r\nmatter will be more fully explained in the section on manures.\r\n\r\n[How may silica be rendered soluble?\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of chlorine in the soil?\r\n\r\nDo peroxide and protoxide of iron affect plants in the same way?\r\n\r\nHow would you treat a soil containing protoxide of iron?\r\n\r\nOn what does the usefulness of all these matters in the soil depend?]\r\n\r\nThe _neutrals_, silica, chlorine, oxide of iron, and oxide of manganese,\r\ndeserve a careful examination. Silica exists in the soil usually in the\r\nform of _sand,_ in which it is, as is well known, perfectly insoluble;\r\nand, before it can be used by plants, which often require it in large\r\nquantities, it must be made soluble, which is done by combining it with\r\nan alkali.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the silica in the soil is insoluble, we must make an\r\napplication of an alkali, such as potash, which will unite with the\r\nsilica, and form the silicate of potash, which is in the exact condition\r\nto be dissolved and carried into the roots of plants.\r\n\r\nChlorine in the soil is probably always in an available condition.\r\n\r\nOxide of iron exists, as has been previously stated, usually in the form\r\nof the _per_oxide (or red oxide). Sometimes, however, it exists in the\r\nform of the _prot_oxide (or black oxide), which is poisonous to plants,\r\nand renders the soil unfertile. By loosening the soil in such a manner\r\nas to admit air and water, this compound takes up more oxygen, which\r\nrenders it a peroxide, and makes it available for plants. The oxide of\r\nmanganese is probably of little consequence.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of all of these matters in the soil depends on their\r\n_exposure_; if they are in the _interior_ of particles, they cannot be\r\nmade use of; while, if the particles are so pulverized that their\r\nconstituents are exposed, they become available, because water can\r\nimmediately attack to dissolve, and carry them into roots.\r\n\r\n[What is one of the chief offices of plowing and hoeing?\r\n\r\nIs the subsoil usually different from the surface soil?\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances have occasioned the difference? In what way?]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great offices of plowing and hoeing; the _lumps_ of\r\nsoil being thereby more broken up and exposed to the action of\r\natmospheric influences, which are often necessary to produce a fertile\r\ncondition of soil, while the trituration of particles reduces them in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSOIL.\r\n\r\n[May the subsoil be made to resemble the surface soil?\r\n\r\nMay all soils be brought to the highest state of fertility?\r\n\r\nOn what examination must improvement be based?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between the soil of some parts of Massachusetts\r\nand that of the Miami valley?]\r\n\r\nThe subsoil is usually of a different character from the surface soil,\r\nbut this difference is more often the result of circumstances than of\r\nformation. The surface soil from having been long cultivated has been\r\nmore opened to the influences of the air than is the case with the\r\nsubsoil, which has never been disturbed so as to allow the same action.\r\nAgain the growth of plants has supplied the surface soil with roots,\r\nwhich by decaying have given it organic matter, thus darkening its\r\ncolor, rendering it warmer, and giving greater ability to absorb heat\r\nand moisture, and to retain manures. All of these effects render the\r\nsurface soil of a more fertile character than it was before vegetable\r\ngrowth commenced; and, where frequent cultivation and manures have been\r\napplied, a still greater benefit has resulted. In most instances the\r\nsubsoil may by the same means be gradually improved in condition until\r\nit equals the surface soil in fertility. The means of producing this\r\nresult, also farther accounts of its advantages, will be given under the\r\nhead of _Cultivation_ (Sect. IV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said of the character of the soil, it must be\r\nevident that, as we know the _causes_ of fertility and barrenness, we\r\nmay by the proper means improve the character of all soils which are not\r\nnow in the highest state of fertility.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis will tell us the _composition_ of a soil, and an\r\nexamination, such as any farmer may make, will inform us of its\r\ndeficiencies in _mechanical_ character, and we may at once resort to the\r\nproper means to secure fertility. In some instances the soil may contain\r\nevery thing that is required, but not in the necessary condition. For\r\ninstance, in some parts of Massachusetts, there are nearly _barren_\r\nsoils which show by analysis precisely the same chemical composition as\r\nthe soil of the Miami valley of Ohio, one of the most _fertile_ in the\r\nworld. The cause of this great difference in their agricultural\r\ncapabilities, is that the Miami soil has its particles finely\r\npulverized; while in the Massachusetts soil the ingredients are combined\r\nwithin particles (such as pebbles, etc.), where they are out of the\r\nreach of roots.\r\n\r\n[Why do soils of the same degree of fineness sometimes differ\r\nin fertility?\r\n\r\nCan soils always be rendered fertile with profit?\r\n\r\nCan we determine the cost before commencing the work?\r\n\r\nWhat must be done before a soil can be cultivated understandingly?\r\n\r\nWhat must be done to keep up the quality of the soil?]\r\n\r\nIn other cases, we find two soils, which are equally well pulverized,\r\nand which appear to be of the same character, having very different\r\npower to support crops. Chemical analysis will show in these instances a\r\ndifference of composition.\r\n\r\nAll of these differences may be overcome by the use of the proper means.\r\nSometimes it could be done at an expense which would be justified by the\r\nresult; and, at others, it might require too large an outlay to be\r\nprofitable. It becomes a question of economy, not of ability, and\r\nscience is able to estimate the cost.\r\n\r\nSoil cannot be cultivated understandingly until it has been subjected to\r\nsuch an examination as will tell us exactly what is necessary to render\r\nit fertile. Even after fertility is perfectly restored it requires\r\nthought and care to maintain it. The ingredients of the soil must be\r\nreturned in the form of manures as largely as they are removed by the\r\ncrop, or the supply will eventually become too small for the purposes of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[T] It is due to our country, as well as to Prof. Mapes and others, who\r\nlong ago explained this absorptive power of clay and carbon, to say that\r\nthe subject was perfectly understood and practically applied in America\r\na number of years before Prof. Way published the discovery in England as\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THIRD.\r\n\r\nMANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND VARIETIES OF MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What must a farmer know in order to avoid failures?\r\n\r\nCan this be learned entirely from observation?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of action have manures?\r\n\r\nGive examples of each of these.\r\n\r\nMay mechanical effects be produced by chemical action?\r\n\r\nHow does potash affect the soil?]\r\n\r\nTo understand the science of _manures_ is the most important branch of\r\npractical farming. No baker would be called a good practical baker who\r\nkept his flour exposed to the sun and rain. No shoemaker would be called\r\na good practical shoemaker, who used morocco for the soles of his shoes,\r\nand heavy leather for the uppers. No carpenter would be called a good\r\npractical carpenter, who tried to build a house without nails, or other\r\nfastenings. So with the farmer. He cannot be called a good practical\r\nfarmer if he keeps the materials, from which he is to make plants, in\r\nsuch a condition, that they will have their value destroyed, uses them\r\nin the wrong places, or tries to put them together without having every\r\nthing present that is necessary. Before he can avoid failures _with\r\ncertainty_, he must know what manures are composed of, how they are to\r\nbe preserved, where they are needed, and what kinds are required. True,\r\nhe may from observation and experience, _guess_ at results, but he\r\ncannot _know_ that he is right until he has learned the facts above\r\nnamed. In this section of our work, we mean to convey some of the\r\ninformation necessary to this branch of _practical farming_.\r\n\r\nWe shall adopt a classification of the subject somewhat different from\r\nthat found in most works on manures, but the _facts_ are the same. The\r\naction of manures is either _mechanical_ or _chemical_, or a combination\r\nof both. For instance: some kinds of manure improve the mechanical\r\ncharacter of the soil, such as those which loosen stiff clay soils, or\r\nothers which render light sandy soils compact--these are called\r\n_mechanical_ manures. Some again furnish food for plants--these are\r\ncalled _chemical_ manures.\r\n\r\nMany mechanical manures produce their effects by means of chemical\r\naction. Thus _potash_ combines chemically with sand in the soil. In so\r\ndoing, it roughens the surfaces of the particles of sand, and renders\r\nthe soil less liable to be compacted by rains. In this manner, it acts\r\nas a _mechanical_ manure. The compound of sand and potash,[U] as well as\r\nthe potash alone, may enter into the composition of plants, and hence it\r\nis a _chemical_ manure. In other words, potash belongs to both classes\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this distinction should be well understood by the\r\nlearner, as the words \"mechanical\" and \"chemical\" in connection with\r\nmanures will be made use of throughout the following pages.\r\n\r\n[What are absorbents?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of manure is charcoal?]\r\n\r\nThere is another class of manures which we shall call _absorbents_.\r\nThese comprise those substances which have the power of taking up\r\nfertilizing matters, and retaining them for the use of plants. For\r\ninstance, _charcoal_ is an absorbent. As was stated in the section on\r\nsoils, this substance is a retainer of all fertilizing gases and many\r\nminerals. Other matters made use of in agriculture have the same effect.\r\nThese absorbents will be spoken of more fully in their proper places.\r\n\r\nTABLE.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL MANURES are those which improve the mechanical condition of\r\n                   soils.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL      \"    are those which serve as food for plants.\r\n\r\nABSORBENTS         are those substances which absorb and retain\r\n                   fertilizing matters.\r\n\r\n[Into what classes may manures be divided?\r\n\r\nWhat are organic manures?\r\n\r\nInorganic? Atmospheric?]\r\n\r\nManures may be divided into three classes, viz.: _organic_, _inorganic_,\r\nand _atmospheric_.\r\n\r\nORGANIC manures comprise all _animal_ and _vegetable_ matters which are\r\nused to fertilize the soil, such as dung, muck, etc.\r\n\r\nINORGANIC manures are those which are of a purely _mineral_ character,\r\nsuch as lime, ashes, etc.\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC manures consist of those organic manures which are in the\r\nform of gases in the atmosphere, and which are absorbed by rains and\r\ncarried to the soil. These are of immense importance. The ammonia and\r\ncarbonic acid in the air are atmospheric manures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[U] Silicate of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEXCREMENTS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Of what is animal excrement composed?\r\n\r\nExplain the composition of the food of animals.\r\n\r\nWhat does hay contain?\r\n\r\nTo what does Liebig compare the consumption of food by animals, and\r\nwhy?]\r\n\r\nThe first organic manure which we shall examine, is animal _excrement_.\r\n\r\nThis is composed of those matters which have been eaten by the animal as\r\nfood, and have been thrown off as solid or liquid manure. In order that\r\nwe may know of what they consist, we must refer to the composition of\r\nfood and examine the process of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe food of animals, we have seen to consist of both organic and\r\ninorganic matter. The organic part may be divided into two classes, _i.\r\ne._, that portion which contains nitrogen--such as gluten, albumen,\r\netc., and that which does not contain nitrogen--such as starch, sugar,\r\noil, etc.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic part of food may also be divided into _soluble_ matter and\r\n_insoluble_ matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGESTION AND ITS PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n[Of what does that part of dung consist which resembles soot?\r\n\r\nWhat else does the dung contain?\r\n\r\nIn what manner does the digested part of food escape from the body?]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that we have a full-grown ox, which is not increasing\r\nin any of his parts, but only consumes food to keep up his respiration,\r\nand to supply the natural wastes of his body. To this ox we will feed a\r\nton of hay which contains organic matter, with and without nitrogen, and\r\nsoluble and insoluble inorganic substances. Now let us try to follow it\r\nthrough its changes in the animal, and observe its destination. Liebig\r\ncompares the consumption of food by animals to the imperfect burning of\r\nwood in a stove, where a portion of the fuel is resolved into gases and\r\nashes (that is, it is completely burned), and another portion, which is\r\nnot thoroughly burned, passes off as _soot_. In the animal action in\r\nquestion, the food undergoes changes which are similar to this burning\r\nof wood. A part of the food is _digested_ and taken up by the blood,\r\nwhile another portion remains undigested, and passes the bowels as solid\r\ndung--corresponding to soot. This part of the dung then, we see is\r\nmerely so much of the food as passes through the system without being\r\nmaterially changed. Its nature is easily understood. It contains organic\r\nand inorganic matter in nearly the same condition as they existed in the\r\nhay. They have been rendered finer and softer, but their chemical\r\ncharacter is not materially altered. The dung also contains small\r\nquantities of nitrogenous matter, which _leaked out_, as it were, from\r\nthe stomach and intestines. The digested food, however, undergoes\r\nfurther changes which affect its character, and it escapes from the body\r\nin three ways--_i. e._, through the lungs, through the bladder, and\r\nthrough the bowels. It will be recollected from the first section of\r\nthis book, p. 22, that the carbon in the blood of animals, unites with\r\nthe oxygen of the air drawn into the lungs, and is thrown off in the\r\nbreath as carbonic acid. The hydrogen and oxygen unite to form a part of\r\nthe water which constitutes the moisture of the breath.\r\n\r\n[Explain the escape of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the nitrogenous parts?\r\n\r\nHow is the _soluble_ ash of the digested food parted with?\r\n\r\nThe insoluble?\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the food are not returned in the dung, how are they\r\ndisposed of?]\r\n\r\nThat portion of the organic part of the hay which has been taken up by\r\nthe blood of the ox, and which does not contain nitrogen (corresponding\r\nto the _first_ class of proximates, as described in Sect. I), is emitted\r\nthrough the lungs. It consists, as will be recollected, of carbon,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, and these assume, in respiration, the form of\r\ncarbonic acid and water.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter of the digested hay, in the blood, which contains\r\nnitrogen (corresponding to the _second_ class of proximates, described\r\nin Sect. I), goes to the _bladder_, where it assumes the form of urea--a\r\nconstituent of urine or liquid manure.\r\n\r\nWe have now disposed of the imperfectly digested food (dung), and of the\r\n_organic_ matter which was taken up by the blood. All that remains to be\r\nexamined is the inorganic or mineral matter in the blood, which would\r\nhave become _ashes_, if the hay had been burned. The _soluble_ part of\r\nthis inorganic matter passes into the bladder, and forms the _inorganic\r\npart of urine_. The _insoluble_ part passes the bowels, in connection\r\nwith the dung.\r\n\r\n[How is their place supplied?\r\n\r\nIs food put out of existence when it is fed to animals?\r\n\r\nWhat does the solid dung contain? Liquid manure? The breath?]\r\n\r\nIf any of the food taken up by the blood is not returned as above\r\nstated, it goes to form fat, muscle, hair, bones, or some other part of\r\nthe animal, and as he is not growing (not increasing in weight) an\r\nequivalent amount of the body of the animal goes to the manure to take\r\nthe place of the part retained.[V]\r\n\r\nWe now have our subject in a form to be readily understood. We learn\r\nthat when food is given to animals it is not _put out of existence_, but\r\nis merely _changed in form_; and that in the impurities of the breath,\r\nwe have a large portion of those parts of the food which plants obtain\r\nfrom air and from water; while the solid and liquid excrements contain\r\nall that was taken by the plants from the soil and manures.\r\n\r\nThe SOLID DUNG contains the undigested parts of the food, the\r\n                _insoluble_ parts of the ash, and the nitrogenous\r\n                matters which have _escaped_ from the digestive organs.\r\n\r\n\"LIQUID MANURE\" the nitrogenous or _second class_ of proximates of the\r\n                digested food, and the _soluble_ parts of the ash.\r\n\r\nTHE BREATH contains the _first class_ of proximates, those which contain\r\n                carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but _no nitrogen_.[W]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[V] This account of digestion is not, perhaps, strictly accurate in a\r\nphysiological point of view, but it is sufficiently so to give an\r\nelementary understanding of the character of excrements as manures.\r\n\r\n[W] The excrements of animals contain more or less of sulphur, and\r\nsometimes small quantities of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWASTE OF MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What are the first causes of loss of manure?\r\n\r\nWhat is _evaporation_?]\r\n\r\nThe loss of manure is a subject which demands most serious attention.\r\nUntil within a few years, little was known about the true character of\r\nmanures, and consequently, of the importance of protecting them against\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nThe first causes of waste are _evaporation_ and _leaching_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION.\r\n\r\n[Name a solid body which evaporates.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place when a dead animal is exposed to the atmosphere for a\r\nsufficient time?\r\n\r\nWhat often assist the evaporation of solids?]\r\n\r\nEvaporation is the changing of a solid or liquid body to a vapory form.\r\nThus common smelling salts, a solid, if left exposed, passes into the\r\natmosphere in the form of a gas or vapor. Water, a liquid, evaporates,\r\nand becomes a vapor in the atmosphere. This is the case with very many\r\nsubstances, and in organic nature, both solid and liquid, they are\r\nliable to assume a gaseous form, and become mixed with the atmosphere.\r\nThey are not destroyed, but are merely changed in form.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this action, suppose an animal to die and to decay on\r\nthe surface of the earth. After a time, the flesh will entirely\r\ndisappear, but is not lost. It no longer exists as the flesh of an\r\nanimal, but its carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, still exist in\r\nthe air. They have been liberated from the attractions which held them\r\ntogether, and have passed away; but (as we already know from what has\r\nbeen said in a former section) they are ready to be again taken up by\r\nplants, and pressed into the service of life.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation of liquids may take place without the aid of any thing\r\nbut heat; still, in the case of solids, it is often assisted by decay\r\nand combustion, which break up the bonds that hold the constituents of\r\nbodies together, and thus enable them to return to the atmosphere, from\r\nwhich they were originally derived.\r\n\r\n[What is the cause of odor?\r\n\r\nWhen we perceive an odor, what is taking place?\r\n\r\nWhy do manures give off offensive odors?\r\n\r\nHow may we detect ammonia escaping from manure?]\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that every thing, which has an _odor_ (or can be\r\nsmelled), is evaporating. The odor is caused by parts of the body\r\nfloating in the air, and acting on the nerves of the nose. This is an\r\ninvariable rule; and, when we perceive an odor, we may be sure that\r\nparts of the material, from which it emanates, are escaping. If we\r\nperceive the odor of an apple, it is because parts of the volatile oils\r\nof the apple enter the nose. The same is true when we smell hartshorn,\r\ncologne, etc.\r\n\r\nManures made by animals have an offensive odor, simply because volatile\r\nparts of the manure escape into the air, and are therefore made\r\nperceptible. All organic parts in turn become volatile, assuming a\r\ngaseous form as they decompose.\r\n\r\nWe do not see the gases rising, but there are many ways by which we can\r\ndetect them. If we wave a feather over a manure heap, from which ammonia\r\nis escaping, the feather having been recently dipped in manure, white\r\nfumes will appear around the feather, being the muriate of ammonia\r\nformed by the union of the escaping gas with the muriatic acid. Not only\r\nammonia, but also carbonic acid, and other gases which are useful to\r\nvegetation escape, and are given to the winds. Indeed it may be stated\r\nin few words that all of the organic part of _plants_ (all that was\r\nobtained from the air, water, and ammonia), constituting more than nine\r\ntenths of their dry weight, may be evaporated by the assistance of decay\r\nor combustion. The organic part of _manures_ may be lost in the same\r\nmanner; and, if the process of decomposition be continued long enough,\r\nnothing but a mass of mineral matter will remain, except perhaps a small\r\nquantity of carbon which has not been resolved into carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[What remains after manure has been long exposed to\r\ndecomposition?\r\n\r\nWhat gaseous compounds are formed by the decomposition of manures?]\r\n\r\nThe proportion of solid manure lost by evaporation (made by the\r\nassistance of decay), is a very large part of the whole. Manure cannot\r\nbe kept a single day in its natural state without losing something. It\r\ncommences to give out an offensive odor immediately, and this odor is\r\noccasioned, as was before stated, by the loss of some of its fertilizing\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nAnimal manure contains, as will be seen by reference to p. 100, all of\r\nthe substances contained in plants, though not always in the correct\r\nrelative proportions to each other. When decomposition commences, the\r\ncarbon unites with the oxygen of the air, and passes off as carbonic\r\nacid; the hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water (which evaporates),\r\nand the _nitrogen is mostly resolved into ammonia, which escapes into\r\nthe atmosphere_.\r\n\r\n[Describe fire-fanging.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place when animal manure is exposed in an open barn-yard?\r\n\r\nWhat does liquid manure lose by evaporation?]\r\n\r\nIf manure is thrown into heaps, it often ferments so rapidly as to\r\nproduce sufficient heat to set fire to some parts of the manure, and\r\ncause it to be thrown off with greater rapidity. This may be observed in\r\nnearly all heaps of animal excrement. When they have lain for some time\r\nin mild weather, gray streaks of _ashes_ are often to be seen in the\r\ncentre of the pile. The organic part of the manure having been _burned_\r\naway, nothing but the ash remains,--this is called _fire-fanging_.\r\n\r\nManures kept in cellars without being mixed with refuse matter are\r\nsubject to the same losses.\r\n\r\nWhen kept in the yard, they are still liable to be lost by evaporation.\r\nThey are here often saturated with water, and this water in its\r\nevaporation carries away the ammonia, and carbonic acid which it has\r\nobtained from the rotting mass. The evaporation of the water is rapidly\r\ncarried on, on account of the great extent of surface. The whole mass is\r\nspongy, and soaks the liquids up from below (through hollow straws,\r\netc.), to be evaporated at the surface on the same principle as causes\r\nthe wick of a lamp to draw up the oil to supply fuel for the flame.\r\n\r\nLIQUID MANURE containing large quantities of nitrogen, and forming much\r\nammonia, is also liable to lose all of its organic part from evaporation\r\n(and fermentation), so that it is rendered as much less valuable as is\r\nthe solid dung.[X]\r\n\r\n[When does the waste of exposed manure commence?\r\n\r\nWhat does economy of manure require?\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of leaching?\r\n\r\nGive an illustration of leaching.]\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks, it may be justly inferred that a very large portion\r\nof the _value_ of solid and liquid manure as ordinarily kept is lost by\r\nevaporation in a sufficient length of time, depending on circumstances,\r\nwhether it be three months or several years. The wasting commences as\r\nsoon as the manure is dropped, and continues, except in very cold\r\nweather, until the destruction is complete. Hence we see that true\r\neconomy requires that the manures of the stable, stye, and\r\npoultry-house, should be protected from evaporation (as will be\r\nhereafter described), as soon as possible after they are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEACHING.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _leaching_ is as important in considering the _inorganic_\r\nparts of manures as evaporation is to the organic, while leaching also\r\naffects the organic gases, they being absorbed by water in a great\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of leaching is found in the manufacture of potash.\r\nWhen water is poured over wood-ashes, it dissolves their potash which\r\nit carries through in solution, making ley. If ley is boiled to dryness,\r\nit leaves the potash in a solid form, proving that this substance had\r\nbeen dissolved by the water and removed from the insoluble parts of the\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n[How does water affect decomposing manures?\r\n\r\nDoes continued decomposition continue to prepare material to be leached\r\naway?\r\n\r\nHow far from the surface of the soil may organic constituents be carried\r\nby water?]\r\n\r\nIn the same way water in passing through manures takes up the soluble\r\nportions of the ash as fast as liberated by decomposition, and carries\r\nthem into the soil below; or, if the water runs off from the surface,\r\nthey accompany it. In either case they are lost to the manure. There is\r\nbut a small quantity of ash exposed for leaching in recent manures; but,\r\nas the decomposition of the organic part proceeds, it continues to\r\ndevelope it more and more (in the same manner as burning would do, only\r\nslower), thus preparing fresh supplies to be carried off with each\r\nshower. In this way, while manures are largely injured by evaporation,\r\nthe soluble inorganic parts are removed by water until but a small\r\nremnant of its original fertilizing properties remains.\r\n\r\n[What arrests their farther progress?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the effect of allowing these matters to filter downwards?\r\n\r\nWhat does evaporation remove from manure? Leaching?]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact concerning leaching, that water is able to carry\r\nno part of the organic constituents of vegetables more than about\r\nthirty-four inches below the surface in a fertile soil. They would\r\nprobably be carried to an unlimited distance in pure sand, as it\r\ncontains nothing which is capable of arresting them; but, in most soils,\r\nthe clay and carbon which they contain retain all of the ammonia; also\r\nnearly all of the matters which go to form the inorganic constituents of\r\nplants within about the above named distance from the surface of the\r\nsoil. If such were not the case, the fertility of the earth must soon be\r\ndestroyed, as all of those elements which the soil must supply to\r\ngrowing plants would be carried down out of the reach of roots, and\r\nleave the world a barren waste, its surface having lost its elements of\r\nfertility, while the downward filtration of these would render the water\r\nof wells unfit for our use. Now, however, they are all retained near the\r\nsurface of the soil, and the water issues from springs comparatively\r\npure.\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION removes from manure--\r\n\r\n    Carbon, in the form of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n    Hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen, in the form of ammonia.\r\n\r\nLEACHING removes from manure--\r\n\r\n    The soluble and most valuable parts of the ash in solution in\r\n    water, besides carrying away some of the named above forms of\r\n    organic matter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[X] It should be recollected that every bent straw may act as a syphon,\r\nand occasion much loss of liquid manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nABSORBENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What substances are called absorbents?\r\n\r\nWhat is the most important of these?\r\n\r\nWhat substances are called charcoal in agriculture?\r\n\r\nHow is vegetable matter rendered useful as charcoal?]\r\n\r\nBefore considering farther the subject of animal excrement, it is\r\nnecessary to examine a class of manures known as _absorbents_. These\r\ncomprise all matters which have the power of absorbing, or soaking up,\r\nas it were, the gases which arise from the evaporation of solid and\r\nliquid manures, and retaining them until required by plants.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these is undoubtedly _carbon_ or charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARCOAL.\r\n\r\n_Charcoal_, in an agricultural sense, means all forms of carbon, whether\r\nas peat, muck, charcoal dust from the spark-catchers of locomotives,\r\ncharcoal hearths, river and swamp deposits, leaf mould, decomposed spent\r\ntanbark or sawdust, etc. In short, if any vegetable matter is decomposed\r\nwith the partial exclusion of air (so that there shall not be oxygen\r\nenough supplied to unite with all of the carbon), a portion of its\r\ncarbon remains in the exact condition to serve the purposes of charcoal.\r\n\r\n[What is the first-named effect of charcoal? The second?\r\nThird? Fourth?\r\n\r\nExplain the first action.]\r\n\r\nThe offices performed in the soil by carbonaceous matter were fully\r\nexplained in a former section (p. 79, Sect. 2), and we will now examine\r\nmerely its action with regard to manures. When properly applied to\r\nmanures, in compost, it has the following effects:\r\n\r\n1. It absorbs and retains the fertilizing gases evaporating from\r\ndecomposing matters.\r\n\r\n2. It acts as a _divisor_, thereby reducing the strength (or intensity)\r\nof powerful manures--thus rendering them less likely to injure the roots\r\nof plants; and also increases their bulk, so as to prevent _fire\r\nfanging_ in composts.\r\n\r\n3. It in part prevents the leaching out of the soluble parts of the ash.\r\n\r\n4. It keeps the compost moist.\r\n\r\nThe first-named office of charcoal, _i. e._, absorbing and retaining\r\ngases, is one of the utmost importance. It is this quality that gives to\r\nit so high a position in the opinion of all who have used it. As was\r\nstated in the section on soils, carbonaceous matter seems to be capable\r\nof absorbing every thing which may be of use to vegetation. It is a\r\ngrand purifier, and while it prevents offensive odors from escaping, it\r\nis at the same time storing its pores with food for the nourishment of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[Explain its action as a divisor.\r\n\r\nHow does charcoal protect composts against injurious action of rains?\r\n\r\nHow does it keep them moist?]\r\n\r\n2d. In its capacity as a _divisor_ for manures, charcoal should be\r\nconsidered as excellent in all cases, especially to use with strongly\r\nconcentrated (or heating) animal manures. These, when applied in their\r\nnatural state to the soil, are very apt to injure young roots by the\r\nviolence of their action. When mixed with a divisor, such manures are\r\n_diluted_, made less active, and consequently less injurious. In\r\ncomposts, manures are liable, as has been before stated, to become\r\nburned by the resultant heat of decomposition; this is called _fire\r\nfanging_, and is prevented by the liberal use of divisors, because, by\r\nincreasing the bulk, the heat being diffused through a larger mass,\r\nbecomes less intense. The same principle is exhibited in the fact that\r\nit takes more fire to boil a cauldron of water than a tea-kettle full.\r\n\r\n3d. Charcoal has much power to arrest the passage of mineral matters in\r\nsolution; so much so, that compost heaps, well supplied with muck, are\r\nless affected by rains than those not so supplied. All composts,\r\nhowever, should be kept under cover.\r\n\r\n4th. Charcoal keeps the compost moist from the ease with which it\r\nabsorbs water, and its ability to withstand drought.\r\n\r\n[What source of carbon is within the reach of most farmers?\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by muck?\r\n\r\nOf what does it consist?\r\n\r\nHow does it differ in quality?]\r\n\r\nWith these advantages before us, we must see the importance of an\r\nunderstanding of the modes for obtaining charcoal. Many farmers are so\r\nsituated that they can obtain sufficient quantities of charcoal dust.\r\nOthers have not equal facilities. Nearly all, however, can obtain\r\n_muck_, and to this we will now turn our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUCK, AND THE LIME AND SALT MIXTURE.\r\n\r\n[What is the first step in preparing muck for decomposition?\r\n\r\nWith what proportion of the lime and salt mixture should it be\r\ncomposted?\r\n\r\nWhy should this compost be made under cover?\r\n\r\nWhat is this called after decomposition?\r\n\r\nWhy should we not use muck immediately after taking it from the swamp?]\r\n\r\nBy _muck_, we mean the vegetable deposits of swamps and rivers. It\r\nconsists of decayed organic substances, mixed with more or less earth.\r\nIts principal constituent is _carbon_, in different degrees of\r\ndevelopment, which has remained after the decomposition of vegetable\r\nmatter. Muck varies largely in its quality, according to the amount of\r\ncarbon which it contains, and the perfection of its decomposition. The\r\nbest muck is usually found in comparatively dry locations, where the\r\nwater which once caused the deposit has been removed. Muck which has\r\nbeen long in this condition, is usually better decomposed than that\r\nwhich is saturated with water. The muck from swamps, however, may soon\r\nbe brought to the best condition. It should be thrown out, if possible,\r\nat least one year before it is required for use (a less time may\r\nsuffice, except in very cold climates) and left, in small heaps or\r\nridges, to the action of the weather, which will assist in pulverizing\r\nit, while, from having its water removed, its decomposition goes on more\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nAfter the muck has remained in this condition a sufficient length of\r\ntime, it may be removed to the barn-yard and composted with the lime and\r\nsalt mixture (described on page 115) in the proportion of one cord of\r\nmuck to four bushels of the mixture. This compost ought to be made under\r\ncover, lest the rain leach out the constituents of the mixture, and thus\r\noccasion loss; at the end of a month or more, the muck in the compost\r\nwill have been reduced to a fine pulverulent mass, nearly equal to\r\ncharcoal dust for application to animal excrement. When in this\r\ncondition it is called _prepared_ muck, by which name it will be\r\ndesignated in the following pages.\r\n\r\nMuck should not be used immediately after being taken from the swamp, as\r\nit is then almost always _sour_, and is liable to produce sorrel. Its\r\n_sourness_ is due to _acids_ which it contains, and these must be\r\nrectified by the application of an alkali, or by long exposure to the\r\nweather, before the muck is suitable for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME AND SALT MIXTURE.\r\n\r\n[What proportions of lime and salt are required for the\r\ndecomposing mixture?\r\n\r\nExplain the process of making it.\r\n\r\nWhy should it be made under cover?]\r\n\r\nThe lime and salt mixture, used in the decomposition of muck, is made in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\nRECIPE.--Take _three_ bushels of shell lime, _hot from the kiln_, or as\r\nfresh as possible, and slake it with water in which _one_ bushel of salt\r\nhas been dissolved.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to use only so much water as is necessary to dissolve\r\nthe salt, as it is difficult to induce the lime to absorb a larger\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nIn dissolving the salt, it is well to hang it in a basket in the upper\r\npart of the water, as the salt water will immediately settle towards the\r\nbottom (being heavier), and allow the freshest water to be nearest to\r\nthe salt. In this way, the salt may be all dissolved, and thus make the\r\nbrine used to slake the lime. It may be necessary to apply the brine at\r\nintervals of a day or two, and to stir the mass often, as the amount of\r\nwater is too great to be readily absorbed.\r\n\r\nThis mixture should be made under cover, as, if exposed, it would obtain\r\nmoisture from rain or dew, which would prevent the use of all the\r\nbrine. Another objection to its exposure to the weather is its great\r\nliability to be washed away by rains. It should be at least ten days old\r\nbefore being used, and would probably be improved by an age of three or\r\nfour months, as the chemical changes it undergoes will require some time\r\nto be completed.\r\n\r\n[Explain the character of this mixture as represented in the\r\ndiagram. (Black board.)]\r\n\r\nThe character of this mixture may be best described by the following\r\ndiagram:--\r\n\r\nWe have originally--\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|                                  |\r\n Lime-+                        Salt\r\n      |                    consisting of\r\n      |                   +---Chlorine  }   Chloride\r\n      |                   |     and     }      of\r\n      |                   | +-Sodium.   }   Sodium.\r\n      |                   | | --Carbonic acid\r\n      |                   | |        and\r\n      |                   | | --Oxygen in the air.\r\n      +-Chloride of lime.-+ |\r\n                            +-Carbonate of Soda.\r\n                                        [Y]\r\n\r\nThe lime unites with the chlorine of the salt and forms _chloride of\r\nlime_.\r\n\r\nThe sodium, after being freed from the chlorine, unites with the oxygen\r\nof the air and forms soda, which, combining with the carbonic acid of\r\nthe atmosphere, forms carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nChloride of lime and carbonate of soda are better agents in the\r\ndecomposition of muck than pure salt and lime; and, as these compounds\r\nare the result of the mixture, much benefit ensues from the operation.\r\n\r\nWhen _shell_ lime cannot be obtained, Thomaston, or any other very pure\r\nlime, will answer, though care must be taken that it do not contain much\r\nmagnesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\n[What effect has lime on muck?\r\n\r\nOn what does the energy of this effect depend?\r\n\r\nWhy should a compost of muck and lime be protected from rain?]\r\n\r\nMuck may be decomposed by the aid of other materials. _Lime_ is very\r\nefficient, though not as much so as when combined with salt. The action\r\nof lime, when applied to the muck, depends very much on its condition.\r\nAir-slaked lime (carbonate of lime), and hydrate of lime, slaked with\r\nwater, have but a limited effect compared with lime freshly burned and\r\napplied in a caustic (or pure) form. When so used, however, the compost\r\nshould not be exposed to rains, as this would have a tendency to make\r\n_mortar_ which would harden it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH.\r\n\r\n[Is potash valuable for this use?\r\n\r\nFrom what sources may potash be obtained?\r\n\r\nIn what proportion should ashes be applied to muck? Sparlings?]\r\n\r\n_Potash_ is a very active agent in decomposing vegetable matter, and may\r\nbe used with great advantage, especially where an analysis of the soil\r\nwhich is to be manured shows a deficiency of potash.\r\n\r\n_Unleached_ wood ashes are generally the best source from which to\r\nobtain this, and from five to twenty-five bushels of these mixed with\r\none cord of muck will produce the desired result.[Z]\r\n\r\nThe sparlings (or refuse) of potash warehouses may often be purchased at\r\nsufficiently low rates to be used for this purpose, and answer an\r\nexcellent end. They may be applied at the rate of from twenty to one\r\nhundred pounds to each cord of muck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy any of the foregoing methods, muck may be _prepared_ for use in\r\ncomposting.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Y] There is, undoubtedly, some of this lime which does not unite with\r\nthe chlorine; this, however, is still as valuable as any lime.\r\n\r\n[Z] _Leached_ ashes will not supply the place of these, as the leaching\r\nhas deprived them of their potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSTING STABLE MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What principles should regulate us in composting?\r\n\r\nIn what condition is solid dung of value as a fertilizer?\r\n\r\nWhat do we aim to do in composting?]\r\n\r\nIn composting stable manure in the most economical manner, the\r\nevaporation of the organic parts and the leaching of the ashy (and\r\nother) portions must be avoided, while the condition of the mass is such\r\nas to admit of the perfect decomposition of the manure.\r\n\r\nSolid manures in their fresh state are of but very little use to plants.\r\nIt is only as they are decomposed, and have their nitrogen turned into\r\nammonia, and their other ingredients resolved into the condition\r\nrequired by plants, that they are of much value as fertilizers. We have\r\nseen that, if this decomposition takes place without proper precautions\r\nbeing made, the most valuable parts of the manure would be lost. Nor\r\nwould it be prudent to keep manures from decomposing until they are\r\napplied to the soil, for then they are not immediately ready for use,\r\nand time is lost. By composting, we aim to save every thing while we\r\nprepare the manures for immediate use.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELTER.\r\n\r\n[What is the first consideration for composts?\r\n\r\nDescribe the arrangement of floor.]\r\n\r\nThe first consideration in preparing for composting, is to provide\r\nproper shelter. This may be done either by means of a shed or by\r\narranging a cellar under the stables, or in any other manner that may be\r\ndictated by circumstances. It is no doubt better to have the manure shed\r\nenclosed so as to make it an effectual protection; this however is not\r\nabsolutely necessary if the roof project far enough over the compost to\r\nshelter it from the sun's rays and from driving rains.\r\n\r\nThe importance of some protection of this kind, is evident from what has\r\nalready been said, and indeed it is impossible to make an economical use\r\nof manures without it. The trifling cost of building a shed, or\r\npreparing a cellar, is amply repaid in the benefit resulting from their\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOOR.\r\n\r\nThe _floor_ or foundation on which to build the compost deserves some\r\nconsideration. It may be of plank tightly fitted, a hard bed of clay, or\r\nbetter, a cemented surface. Whatever material is used in its\r\nconstruction (and stiff clay mixed with water and beaten compactly down\r\nanswers an excellent purpose), the floor must have such an inclination\r\nas will cause it to discharge water only at one point. That is, one part\r\nof the edge must be lower than the rest of the floor, which must be so\r\nshaped that water will run towards this point from every part of it;\r\nthen--the floor being water-tight--all of the liquids of the compost may\r\nbe collected in a\r\n\r\n\r\nTANK.\r\n\r\n[How should the tank be attached?]\r\n\r\nThis _tank_ used to collect the liquids of the manure may be made by\r\nsinking a barrel or hogshead (according to the size of the heap) in the\r\nground at the point where it is required, or in any other convenient\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn the tank a pump of cheap construction may be placed, to raise the\r\nliquid to a sufficient height to be conveyed by a trough to the centre\r\nof the heap, and there distributed by means of a perforated board with\r\nraised edges, and long enough to reach across the heap in any direction.\r\nBy altering the position of this board, the liquid may be carried evenly\r\nover the whole mass.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the apparatus required for composting, and the compost\r\nlaid up, may be better shown by the following figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n_a_, tank; _b_, pump; _c_ & _g_, perforated board; _d_, muck; _e_,\r\nmanure; _f_, floor.]\r\n\r\n[How is the compost made?]\r\n\r\nThe compost is made by laying on the floor ten or twelve inches of muck,\r\nand on that a few inches of manure, then another heavy layer of muck,\r\nand another of manure, continuing in this manner until the heap is\r\nraised to the required height, always having a thick layer of muck at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n[What liquids are best for moistening the compost?\r\n\r\nHow should they be applied?\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of this moistening?\r\n\r\nHow does it compare with forking over?]\r\n\r\nAfter laying up the heap, the tank should be filled with liquid manure\r\nfrom the stables, slops from the house, soap-suds, or other water\r\ncontaining fertilizing matter, to be pumped over the mass. There should\r\nbe enough of the liquid to saturate the heap and filter through to fill\r\nthe tank twice a week, at which intervals it should be again pumped up,\r\nthus continually being passed through the manure. This liquid should not\r\nbe changed, as it contains much soluble manure. Should the liquid\r\nmanures named above not be sufficient, the quantity may be increased by\r\nthe use of rain-water. That falling during the first ten minutes of a\r\nshower is the best, as it contains much ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by frequently watering the compost is one of the\r\ngreatest advantages of this system.\r\n\r\nThe soluble portions of the manure are equally diffused through every\r\npart of the heap.\r\n\r\nShould the heat of fermentation be too great, the watering will reduce\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen the compost is saturated with water, the air is driven out; and, as\r\nthe water subsides, _fresh_ air enters and takes its place. This fresh\r\nair contains oxygen, which assists in the decomposition of the manure.\r\n\r\nIn short, the watering does all the work of forking over by hand much\r\nbetter and much more cheaply.\r\n\r\n[Why will the ammonia of manure thus made, not escape if it be\r\nused as a top dressing?\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of preparing manures in this manner?\r\n\r\nWhat is the profit attending it?]\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month or more, this compost will be ready for use. The\r\nlayers in the manure will have disappeared, the whole mass having become\r\nof a uniform character, highly fertilizing, and ready to be immediately\r\nused by plants.\r\n\r\nIt may be applied to the soil, either as a top-dressing, or otherwise,\r\nwithout fear of loss, as the muck will retain all of the gases which\r\nwould otherwise evaporate.\r\n\r\nThe cost and trouble of the foregoing system of composting are trifling\r\ncompared with its advantages. The quantity of the manure is much\r\nincreased, and its quality improved. The health of the animals is\r\nsecured by the retention of those gases, which, when allowed to escape,\r\nrender impure the air which they have to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe cleanliness of the stable and yard is much advanced as the effete\r\nmatters, which would otherwise litter them, are carefully removed to the\r\ncompost.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the profit of composting, it may be stated that Prof.\r\nMapes has decomposed ninety-two cords of swamp muck, with four hundred\r\nbushels of the lime and salt mixture, and then composted it with eight\r\ncords of _fresh_ horse dung, making one hundred cords of manure fully\r\nequal to the same amount of stable-manure alone, which has lain one\r\nyear exposed to the weather. Indeed one cord of muck well decomposed,\r\nand containing the chlorine lime and soda of four bushels of the\r\nmixture, is of itself equal in value to the same amount of manure which\r\nhas lain in an open barn-yard during the heat and rain of one season,\r\nand is then applied to the land in a _raw_ or undecomposed state.\r\n\r\n[In what other manners may muck be used in the preservation of\r\nmanures?\r\n\r\nHow may liquid manure be made most useful?]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing system of composting is the best that has yet been\r\nsuggested for making use of solid manures. Many other methods may be\r\nadopted when circumstances will not admit of so much attention. It is a\r\ncommon and excellent practice to throw prepared muck into the cellar\r\nunder the stables, to be mixed and turned over with the manure by swine.\r\nIn other cases the manures are kept in the yard, and are covered with a\r\nthin layer of muck every morning. The principle which renders these\r\nsystems beneficial is the absorbent power of charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID MANURE.\r\n\r\n_Liquid manure_ from animals may, also, be made useful by the assistance\r\nof prepared muck. Where a tank is used in composting, the liquids from\r\nthe stable may all be employed to supply moisture to the heap; but where\r\nany system is adopted, not requiring liquids, the urine may be applied\r\nto muck heaps, and then allowed to ferment. Fermentation is necessary in\r\nurine as well as in solid dung, before it is very active as a manure.\r\nUrine, as will be recollected, contains nitrogen and forms ammonia on\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n[Describe the manner of digging out the bottoms of stalls.]\r\n\r\nIt is a very good plan to dig out the bottoms of the stalls in a\r\ncircular or gutter-like form, three or four feet deep in the middle,\r\ncement the ground, or make it nearly water-tight, by a plastering of\r\nstiff clay, and fill them up with prepared muck. The appearance of a\r\ncross section of the floor thus arranged would be as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe prepared muck in the bottom of the stalls would absorb the urine as\r\nsoon as voided, while yet warm with the animal heat, and receive heat\r\nfrom the animal's body while lying down at night. This heat will hasten\r\nthe decomposition of the urea,[AA] and if the muck be renewed twice a\r\nmonth, and that which is removed composted under cover, it will be found\r\na most prolific source of good manure. In Flanders, the liquid manure of\r\na cow is considered worth $10 per year, and it is not less valuable\r\nhere. As was stated in the early part of this section, the inorganic (or\r\nmineral) matter contained in urine, is soluble, and consequently is\r\nimmediately useful as food for plants.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the analysis of liquid and solid manure, in section V.,\r\ntheir relative value may be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMAL EXCREMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manures of different animals are, of course, of different value, as\r\nfertilizers, varying according to the food, the age of the animals, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTABLE MANURE.\r\n\r\nBy stable manure we mean, usually, that of the horse, and that of\r\nhorned cattle. The case described in chap. 2 (of this section), was one\r\nwhere the animal was not increasing in any of its parts, but returned,\r\nin the form of manure, and otherwise, the equivalent of every thing\r\neaten. This case is one of the most simple kind, and is subject to many\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\n[Is the manure of full-grown animals of the same quality as\r\nthat of other animals?\r\n\r\nWhy does that of the growing animal differ?\r\n\r\nWhy does not the formation of _fat_ reduce the quality of manure?\r\n\r\nWhat does _milk_ remove from the food?]\r\n\r\nThe _growing_ animal is increasing in size, and as he derives his\r\nincrease from his food, he does not return in the form of manure as much\r\nas he eats. If his bones are growing, he is taking from his food\r\nphosphate of lime and nitrogenous matter; consequently, the manure will\r\nbe poorer in these ingredients. The same may be said of the formation of\r\nthe muscles, in relation to nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe _fatting_ animal, if full grown, makes manure which is as good as\r\nthat from animals that are not increasing in size, because the fat is\r\ntaken from those parts of the food which is obtained by plants from the\r\natmosphere, and from nature, (_i. e._ from the 1st class of proximates).\r\nFat contains no nitrogen, and, consequently, does not lessen the amount\r\nof this ingredient in the manure.\r\n\r\n_Milch Cows_ turn a part of their food to the formation of milk, and\r\nconsequently, they produce manure of reduced value.\r\n\r\n[How do the solid and liquid manure of the horse and ox\r\ncompare?\r\n\r\nWhat occasions these differences?]\r\n\r\nThe solid manure of the horse is better than that of the ox, while the\r\nliquid manure of the ox is comparatively better than that of the horse.\r\nThe cause of this is that the horse has poorer digestive organs than the\r\nox, and consequently passes more of the valuable parts of his food, in\r\nan undigested form, as dung, while the ox, from chewing the cud and\r\nhaving more perfect organs, turns more of his food into urine than the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nFULL GROWN animals not     }\r\n  producing milk, and full } make the best manure.\r\n  grown animals fattening  }\r\n\r\nGROWING ANIMALS reduce the value of their manure, taking portions of\r\ntheir food to form their bodies.\r\n\r\nMILCH COWS reduce the value of their manure by changing a part of their\r\nfood into milk.\r\n\r\nTHE OX makes poor dung and rich urine.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE makes rich dung and poor urine.[AB]\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SOIL.\r\n\r\n[What is the most valuable manure accessible to the farmer?\r\n\r\nWhat is the probable value of the night soil yearly lost in the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nOf what does the manure of man consist?]\r\n\r\nThe _best_ manure within the reach of the farmer is _night soil_, or\r\nhuman excrement. There has always been a false delicacy about mentioning\r\nthis fertilizer, which has caused much waste, and great loss of health,\r\nfrom the impure and offensive odors which it is allowed to send forth to\r\ntaint the air.\r\n\r\nThe value of the night soil yearly lost in the United States is,\r\nprobably, about _fifty millions of dollars_ (50,000,000); an amount\r\nnearly equal to the entire expenses of our National Government. Much of\r\nthe ill health of our people is undoubtedly occasioned by neglecting the\r\nproper treatment of night soil.\r\n\r\n[Describe this manure as compared with the excrements of other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nDoes the use of night soil produce disagreeable properties in plants?]\r\n\r\nThat which directly affects agriculture, as treated of in this book, is\r\nthe value of this substance as a fertilizer. The manure of man consists\r\n(as is the case with that of other animals) of those parts of his food\r\nwhich are not retained in the increase of his body. If he be _growing_,\r\nhis manure is poorer, as in the case of the ox, and it is subject to all\r\nthe other modifications named in the early part of this chapter. His\r\nfood is usually of a varied character, and is rich in nitrogen, the\r\nphosphates, and other inorganic constituents; consequently, his manure\r\nis made valuable by containing large quantities of these matters. As is\r\nthe case with the ox, the _dung_ contains the undigested food, the\r\nsecretions (or leakings) of the digestive organs, and the insoluble\r\nparts of the ash of the digested food. The _urine_, in like manner,\r\ncontains a large proportion of the nitrogen and the soluble inorganic\r\nparts of the digested food. When we consider how much richer the _food_\r\nof man is than that of horned cattle, we shall see the superior value of\r\nhis _excrement_.\r\n\r\nNight soil has been used as a manure, for ages, in China, which is,\r\nundoubtedly, one great secret of their success in supporting a dense\r\npopulation, for so long a time, without impoverishing the soil. It has\r\nbeen found, in many instances, to increase the productive power of the\r\nnatural soil three-fold. That is, if a soil would produce ten bushels of\r\nwheat per acre, without manure, it would produce thirty bushels if\r\nmanured with night soil.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed that manuring with night soil would give disagreeable\r\nproperties to plants: such is not the case; their quality is invariably\r\nimproved. The color and odor of the rose become richer and more delicate\r\nby the use of the most offensive night soil as manure.\r\n\r\n[What is the direct object of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat would result if this were not the case?\r\n\r\nHow may night soil be easily prepared for use, and its offensive odor\r\nprevented?]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this is the case from the fact that plants have it\r\nfor their direct object to make over and put together the refuse organic\r\nmatter, and the gases and the minerals found in nature, for the use of\r\nanimals. If there were no natural means of rendering the excrement of\r\nanimals available to plants, the earth must soon be shorn of its\r\nfertility, as the elements of growth when once consumed would be\r\nessentially destroyed, and no soil could survive the exhaustion. There\r\nis no reason why the manure of man should be rejected by vegetation more\r\nthan that of any other animal; and indeed it is not, for ample\r\nexperience has proved that for most soils there is no better manure in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nA single experiment will suffice to show that night soil may be so kept\r\nthat there shall be no loss of its valuable gases, and consequently no\r\noffensive odor arising from it, while it may be removed and applied to\r\ncrops without unpleasantness. All that is necessary to effect this\r\nwonderful change in night soil, and to turn it from its disagreeable\r\ncharacter to one entirely inoffensive, is to mix with it a little\r\ncharcoal dust, prepared muck, or any other good absorbent--thus making\r\nwhat is called poudrette. The mode of doing this must depend on\r\ncircumstances. In many cases, it would be expedient to keep a barrel of\r\nthe absorbent in the privy and throw down a small quantity every day.\r\nThe effect on the odor of the house would amply repay the trouble.\r\n\r\n[Should pure night soil be used as a manure?\r\n\r\nWhat precaution is necessary in preparing hog manure for use?]\r\n\r\nThe manure thus made is of the most valuable character, and may be used\r\nunder any circumstances with a certainty of obtaining a good crop. It\r\nshould not be used unmixed with some absorbent, as it is of such\r\nstrength as to kill plants.\r\n\r\nFor an analysis of human manure, see Section V.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG MANURE.\r\n\r\n_Hog Manure_ is very valuable, but it must be used with care. It is so\r\nviolent in its action that, when applied in a pure form to crops, it\r\noften produces injurious results. It is liable to make cabbages\r\n_clump-footed_, and to induce a disease in turnips called _ambury_ (or\r\nfingers and toes). The only precaution necessary is to supply the stye\r\nwith prepared muck, charcoal-dust, leaf-mould, or any absorbent in\r\nplentiful quantities, often adding fresh supplies. The hogs will work\r\nthis over with the manure; and, when required for use, it will be found\r\nan excellent fertilizer. The absorbent will have overcome its injurious\r\ntendency, and it may be safely applied to any crop. From the variety and\r\nrich character of the food of this animal, his manure is of a superior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[Why is the manure from butchers' hog-pens very valuable?\r\n\r\nHow does the value of poultry manure compare with that of guano?\r\n\r\nHow may it be protected against loss?]\r\n\r\n_Butchers' hog-pen manure_ is one of the best fertilizers known. It is\r\nmade by animals that live almost entirely on blood and other animal\r\nrefuse, and is very rich in nitrogen and the phosphates. It should be\r\nmixed with prepared muck, or its substitute, to prevent the loss of its\r\nammonia, and as a protection against its injurious effect on plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY HOUSE MANURE.\r\n\r\nNext in value to night soil, among domestic manures, are the excrements\r\nof poultry, pigeons, etc. Birds live on the nice bits of creation,\r\nseeds, insects, etc., and they discharge their solid and liquid\r\nexcrements together. Poultry-dung is nearly equal in value to guano\r\n(except that it contains more water), and it deserves to be carefully\r\npreserved and judiciously used. It is as well worth twenty-five cents\r\nper bushel as guano is worth fifty dollars a ton (at which price it is\r\nnow sold).\r\n\r\nPoultry-manure is liable to as much injury from evaporation and leaching\r\nas is any other manure, and equal care should be taken (by the same\r\nmeans) to prevent such loss. Good shelter over the roosts, and daily\r\nsprinkling with prepared muck or charcoal-dust will be amply repaid by\r\nthe increased value of the manure, and its better action and greater\r\ndurability in the soil. The value of this manure should be taken into\r\nconsideration in calculating the profit of keeping poultry (as indeed\r\nwith all other stock). It has been observed by a gentleman of much\r\nexperience, in poultry raising, that the yearly manure of a hundred\r\nfowls applied to previously unmanured land would produce _extra_ corn\r\nenough to keep them for a year. This is probably a large estimate, but\r\nit serves to show that this fertilizer is very valuable, and also that\r\npoultry may be kept with great profit, if their excrements are properly\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe manure of pigeons has been a favorite fertilizer in some countries\r\nfor more than 2000 years.\r\n\r\nMarket gardeners attach much value to rabbit-manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP MANURE.\r\n\r\n[What can you say of the manure of sheep?]\r\n\r\nThe manure of sheep is less valuable than it would be, if so large a\r\nquantity of the nitrogen and mineral parts of the food were not employed\r\nin the formation of wool. This has a great effect on the richness of the\r\nexcrements, but they are still a very good fertilizer, and should be\r\nprotected from loss in the same way as stable manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO.\r\n\r\n[Should the use of guano induce us to disregard other manures?\r\n\r\nWhere and in what manner is the best guano deposited?]\r\n\r\n_Guano_ as a manure has become world renowned. The worn-out tobacco\r\nlands of Virginia, and other fields in many parts of the country, which\r\nseemed to have yielded to the effect of an ignorant course of\r\ncultivation, and to have sunk to their final repose, have in many cases\r\nbeen revived to the production of excellent crops, and have had their\r\nvalue multiplied many fold by the use of guano. Although an excellent\r\nmanure, it should not cause us to lose sight of those valuable materials\r\nwhich exist on almost every farm. Every ton of guano imported into the\r\nUnited States is an addition to our national wealth, but every ton of\r\nstable-manure, or poultry-dung, or night soil evaporated or carried away\r\nin rivers, is equally a _deduction_ from our riches. If the imported\r\nmanure is to really benefit us, we must not allow it to occasion the\r\nneglect and consequent loss of our domestic fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian guano (which is considered the best) is brought from\r\nislands near the coast of Peru. The birds which frequent these islands\r\nlive almost entirely on fish, and drop their excrements here in a\r\nclimate where rain is almost unknown, and where, from the dryness of the\r\nair, there is but little loss sustained by the manure. It is brought to\r\nthis country in large quantities, and is an excellent fertilizer,\r\nsuperior even to night soil.\r\n\r\n[How should it be prepared for use?]\r\n\r\nIt should be mixed with an absorbent before being used, unless it is\r\nplowed deeply under the soil, as it contains much ammonia which would be\r\nlost from evaporation. It would probably also injure plants. The best\r\nway to use guano, is in connection with sulphuric acid and bones, as\r\nwill be described hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the various kinds of guano may be found in the\r\nsection on analysis.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AA] The nitrogenous compound in the urine.\r\n\r\n[AB] Comparatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOTHER ORGANIC MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of organic manures is almost countless. The most common of\r\nthese have been described in the previous chapters on the excrements of\r\nanimals. The more prominent of the remaining ones will now be\r\nconsidered. As a universal rule, it may be stated that all organic\r\nmatter (every thing which has had vegetable or animal life) is capable\r\nof fertilizing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n[What are the chief fertilizing constituents of dead animals?\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of these when exposed to the atmosphere?\r\n\r\nHow may this be prevented?]\r\n\r\nThe bodies of animals contain much _nitrogen_, as well as valuable\r\nquantities, the phosphates and other inorganic materials required in the\r\ngrowth of plants. On their decay, the nitrogen is resolved into\r\n_ammonia_,[AC] and the mineral matters become valuable as food for the\r\ninorganic parts of plants.\r\n\r\nIf the decomposition of animal bodies takes place in exposed situations,\r\nand without proper precautions, the ammonia escapes into the atmosphere,\r\nand much of the mineral portion is leached out by rains. The use of\r\nabsorbents, such as charcoal-dust, prepared muck, etc., will entirely\r\nprevent evaporation, and will in a great measure serve as a protection\r\nagainst leaching.\r\n\r\nIf a dead horse be cut in pieces and mixed with ten loads of muck, the\r\nwhole mass will, in a single season, become a most valuable compost.\r\nSmall animals, such as dogs, cats, etc., may be with advantage buried by\r\nthe roots of grape-vines or trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\n[Of what do the bones of animals consist?\r\n\r\nWhat is gelatine?\r\n\r\nDescribe the fertilizing qualities of fish.]\r\n\r\nThe _bones_ of animals contain phosphate of lime and gelatine. The\r\ngelatine is a nitrogenous substance, and produces ammonia on its\r\ndecomposition. This subject will be spoken of more fully under the head\r\nof 'phosphate of lime' in the chapter on mineral manures, as the\r\ntreatment of bones is more directly with reference to the fertilizing\r\nvalue of their inorganic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\nIn many localities near the sea-shore large quantities of fish are\r\ncaught and applied to the soil. These make excellent manure. They\r\ncontain much nitrogen, which renders them strongly ammoniacal on\r\ndecomposition. Their bones consist of phosphate and carbonate of lime;\r\nand, being naturally soft, they decompose in the soil with great\r\nfacility, and become available to plants. The scales of fish contain\r\nvaluable quantities of nitrogen, phosphate of lime, etc., all of which\r\nare highly useful.\r\n\r\nRefuse fishy matters from markets and from the house are well worth\r\nsaving. These and fish caught for manure may be made into compost with\r\nprepared muck, etc.; and, as they putrefy rapidly, they soon become\r\nready for use. They may be added to the compost of stable manure with\r\ngreat advantage.\r\n\r\n[Should these be applied as a top dressing to the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat are the fertilizing properties of woollen rags?\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to use them?]\r\n\r\nFish (like all other nitrogenous manures) should never be applied as a\r\ntop dressing, unless previously mixed with a good absorbent of ammonia,\r\nbut should when used alone be immediately plowed under to considerable\r\ndepth, to prevent the evaporation--and consequent loss--of their\r\nfertilizing gases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLLEN RAGS, ETC.\r\n\r\n_Woollen rags, hair, waste of woollen factories_, etc., contain both\r\nnitrogen and phosphate of lime; and, like all other matters containing\r\nthese ingredients, are excellent manures, but must be used in such a way\r\nas to prevent the escape of their fertilizing gases. They decompose\r\nslowly, and are therefore considered a _lasting_ manure. Like all\r\n_lasting_ manures, however, they are _slow_ in their effects, and the\r\nmost advantageous way to use them is to compost them with stable manure,\r\nor with some other rapidly fermenting substance, which will hasten their\r\ndecomposition and render them sooner available.\r\n\r\nRags, hair, etc., thus treated, will in a short time be reduced to such\r\na condition that they may be immediately used by plants instead of lying\r\nin the soil to be slowly taken up. It is better in all cases to have\r\nmanures act _quickly_ and give an immediate return for their cost, than\r\nto lie for a long time in the soil before their influence is felt.\r\n\r\n[What is their value compared with that of farm-yard manure?\r\n\r\nHow should old leather be treated?\r\n\r\nDescribe the manurial properties of tanners' refuse.\r\n\r\nHow should they be treated?\r\n\r\nAre horn piths, etc. valuable?]\r\n\r\nA pound of woollen rags is worth, as a manure, twice as much as is paid\r\nfor good linen shreds for paper making; still, while the latter are\r\nalways preserved, the former are thrown away, although considered by\r\ngood judges to be worth forty times as much as barn-yard manure.\r\n\r\nOld leather should not be thrown away. It decomposes very slowly, and\r\nconsequently is of but a little value; but, if put at the roots of young\r\ntrees, it will in time produce appreciable effects.\r\n\r\n_Tanners' and curriers' refuse_, and all other animal offal, including\r\nthat of the slaughter-house, is well worth attention, as it contains\r\nmore or less of those two most important ingredients of manures,\r\nnitrogen and phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to add that, in common with all other animal manures,\r\nthese substances must be either composted, or immediately plowed under\r\nthe soil. Horn piths, and horn shavings, if decomposed in compost, with\r\nsubstances which ferment rapidly, make very good manure, and are worth\r\nfully the price charged for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC MANURES OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN.\r\n\r\n_Muck_, the most important of the purely vegetable manures, has been\r\nalready sufficiently described. It should be particularly borne in mind\r\nthat, when first taken from the swamp it is often _sour_, or _cold_, but\r\nthat if exposed for a long time to the air, or if well treated with\r\nlime, unleached ashes, the lime and salt mixture, or any other alkali,\r\nits acids will be _neutralized_ (or overcome), and it becomes a good\r\napplication to any soil, except peat or other soils already containing\r\nlarge quantities of organic matter. In applying muck to the soil (as has\r\nbeen before stated), it should be made a vehicle for carrying ammoniacal\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPENT TAN BARK.\r\n\r\n[Why is decomposed bark more fertilizing than that of decayed\r\nwood?]\r\n\r\n_Spent tan bark_, if previously decomposed by the use of the lime and\r\nsalt mixture, or potash, answers all the purposes of prepared muck, but\r\nis more difficult of decomposition.\r\n\r\n[How may bark be decomposed?\r\n\r\nWhy should tan bark be composted with an alkali?\r\n\r\nWhy is it good for mulching?\r\n\r\nIs sawdust of any value?]\r\n\r\nThe bark of trees contains a larger proportion of inorganic matter than\r\nthe wood, and much of this, on the decomposition of the bark, becomes\r\navailable as manure. The chemical effect on the bark, of using it in\r\nthe tanning of leather, is such as to render it difficult to be rotted\r\nby the ordinary means, but, by the use of the lime and salt mixture it\r\nmay be reduced to the finest condition, and becomes a most excellent\r\nmanure. It probably contains small quantities of nitrogen (obtained from\r\nthe leather), which adds to its value. Unless tan bark be composted with\r\nlime, or some other alkali, it may produce injurious effects from the\r\n_tannic acid_ which it is liable to contain. Alkaline substances will\r\nneutralize this acid, and prevent it from being injurious.\r\n\r\nOne great benefit resulting from the use of spent tan bark, is due to\r\nits power of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. For this reason it\r\nis very valuable for _mulching_[AD] young trees and plants when first\r\nset out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWDUST.\r\n\r\n[Why is sawdust a good addition to the pig-stye?\r\n\r\nWhat is the peculiarity of sawdust from the beech, etc.?\r\n\r\nWhat is a peculiarity of soot?\r\n\r\nWhy may soot be used as a top dressing without losing its ammonia?]\r\n\r\n_Sawdust_ in its natural state is of very little value to the land, but\r\nwhen decomposed, as may be done by the same method as was described for\r\ntan bark, it is of some importance, as it contains a large quantity of\r\ncarbon. Its ash, too, which becomes available, contains soluble\r\ninorganic matter, and in this way it acts as a direct manure. So far as\r\nconcerns the value of the ash, however, the bark is superior to sawdust.\r\nSawdust may be partially rotted by mixing it with strong manure (as hog\r\nmanure), while it acts as a _divisor_, and prevents the too rapid action\r\nof this when applied to the soil. Some kinds of sawdust, such as that\r\nfrom beech wood, form acetic acid on their decomposition, and these\r\nshould be treated with, at least, a sufficient quantity of lime to\r\ncorrect the acid.\r\n\r\n_Soot_ is a good manure. It contains much carbon, and has, thus far, all\r\nof the beneficial effects of charcoal dust. The sulphur, which is one of\r\nits constituents, not only serves as food for plants, but, from its\r\nodor, is a good protection against some insects. By throwing a handful\r\nof soot on a melon vine, or young cabbage plant, it will keep away many\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nSoot contains some ammonia, and as this is in the form of a _sulphate_,\r\nit is not volatile, and consequently does not evaporate when the soot is\r\napplied as a top dressing, which is the almost universal custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN CROPS.\r\n\r\n[What plants are most used as green crops?\r\n\r\nWhat office is performed by the roots of green crops?\r\n\r\nHow do such manures increase the organic matter of soils?]\r\n\r\n_Green crops_, to plow under, are in many places largely raised, and are\r\nalways beneficial. The plants most used for this purpose, in our\r\ncountry, are clover, buckwheat, and peas. These plants have very long\r\nroots, which they send deep in the soil, to draw up mineral matter for\r\ntheir support. This mineral matter is deposited in the plant. The leaves\r\nand roots receive carbonic acid and ammonia from the air, and from\r\nwater. In this manner they obtain their carbon. When the crop is turned\r\nunder the soil, it decomposes, and the carbon, as well as the mineral\r\ningredients obtained from the subsoil, are deposited in the surface\r\nsoil, and become of use to succeeding crops. The hollow stalks of the\r\nbuckwheat and pea, serve as tubes, in the soil, for the passage of air,\r\nand thus, in heavy soils, give a much needed circulation of atmospheric\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n[What office is performed by the straw of the buckwheat and\r\npea?\r\n\r\nWhat treatment may be substituted for the use of green crops?\r\n\r\nWhich course should be adopted in high farming?\r\n\r\nWhy is the use of green crops preferable in ordinary cultivation?\r\n\r\nName some other valuable manures.]\r\n\r\nAlthough green crops are of great benefit, and are managed with little\r\nlabor, there is no doubt but the same results may be more economically\r\nproduced. A few loads of prepared muck will do more towards increasing\r\nthe organic matter in the soil, than a very heavy crop of clover, while\r\nit would be ready for immediate cultivation, instead of having to lie\r\nidle during the year required in the production and decomposition of\r\nthe green crop. The effect of the roots penetrating the subsoil is, as\r\nwe have seen, to draw up inorganic matter, to be deposited within reach\r\nof the roots of future crops. In the next section we shall show that\r\nthis end may be much more efficiently attained by the use of the\r\nsub-soil plow, which makes a passage for the roots into the subsoil,\r\nwhere they can obtain for themselves what would, in the other case, be\r\nbrought up for them by the roots of the green crop.\r\n\r\nThe offices of the hollow straws may be performed by a system of ridging\r\nand back furrowing, having previously covered the soil with leaves, or\r\nother refuse organic material.\r\n\r\nIn _high farming_, where the object of the cultivator is to make a\r\nprofitable investment of labor, these last named methods will be found\r\nmost expedient; but, if the farmer have a large quantity of land, and\r\ncan afford but a limited amount of labor, the raising of green crops, to\r\nbe plowed under in the fall, will probably be adopted.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter, it may be well to remark that there are\r\nvarious other fertilizers, such as the _ammoniacal liquor of\r\ngas-houses_, _soapers' wastes_, _bleachers' lye_, _lees of old oil\r\ncasks, etc._, which we have not space to consider at length, but which\r\nare all valuable as additions to the compost heap, or as applications,\r\nin a liquid form, to the soil.\r\n\r\n[What are the advantages arising from burying manure in its\r\ngreen state?\r\n\r\nWhich is generally preferable, this course, or composting? Why?]\r\n\r\nIn many cases (when heavy manuring is practised), it may be well to\r\napply organic manures to the soil in a green state, turn them under, and\r\nallow them to undergo decomposition in the ground. The advantages of\r\nthis system are, that the _heat_, resulting from the chemical changes,\r\nwill hasten the growth of plants, by making the soil warmer; the\r\ncarbonic acid formed will be presented to the roots instead of escaping\r\ninto the atmosphere; and if the soil be heavy, the rising of the gases\r\nwill tend to loosen it, and the leaving vacant of the spaces occupied by\r\nthe solid matters will, on their being resolved into gases, render the\r\nsoil of a more porous character. As a general rule, however, in ordinary\r\nfarming, where the amount of manure applied is only sufficient for the\r\nsupply of food to the crop, it is undoubtedly better to have it\r\npreviously decomposed--_cooked_ as it were, for the uses of the\r\nplants--as they can then obtain the required amount of nutriment as fast\r\nas needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION OF MOISTURE.\r\n\r\nIt is often convenient to know the relative power of different manures\r\nto absorb moisture from the atmosphere, especially when we wish to\r\nmanure lands that suffer from drought. The following results are given\r\nby C. W. Johnson, in his essay on salt, (pp. 8 and 19). In these\r\nexperiments the animal manures were employed without any admixture of\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARTS\r\n1000 parts of horse dung, dried in a temperature\r\n           of 100°, absorbed by exposure\r\n           for three hours, to air saturated\r\n           with moisture, of the temperature of\r\n           62°                                         145\r\n1000 parts of cow dung, under the same circumstances,\r\n           absorbed                                    130\r\n1000 parts pig dung                                    120\r\n1000   \"   sheep  \"                                     81\r\n1000   \"   pigeon \"                                     50\r\n1000   \"   rich alluvial soil                           14\r\n1000   \"   fresh tanner's bark                         115\r\n1000   \"   putrified   \"                               145\r\n1000   \"   refuse marine salt sold as manure            49½\r\n1000   \"   soot                                         36\r\n1000   \"   burnt clay                                   29\r\n1000   \"   coal ashes                                   14\r\n1000   \"   lime                                         11\r\n1000   \"   sediment from salt pans                      10\r\n1000   \"   crushed rock salt                            10\r\n1000   \"   gypsum                                        9\r\n1000   \"   salt                                          4[AE]\r\n\r\nMuck is a most excellent absorbent of moisture, when thoroughly\r\ndecomposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF MANURES.\r\n\r\nThe following table from Johnson, on manures, will be found convenient\r\nin the distribution of manures.\r\n\r\nBy its assistance the farmer will know how many loads of manure he\r\nrequires, dividing each load into a stated number of heaps, and placing\r\nthem at certain distances. In this manner manure may be applied evenly,\r\nand calculation may be made as to the amount, per acre, which a certain\r\nquantity will supply.[AF]\r\n\r\n----------+-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nDISTANCE  |\r\nOF        |\r\nTHE HEAPS.|             NUMBER OF HEAPS IN A LOAD.\r\n----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n          |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  | 9   | 10\r\n----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n3 yards.  | 538 | 269 | 179 | 134 | 108 |  89½|  77 |  67 |  60 |  54\r\n3½ do.    | 395 | 168 | 132 |  99 |  79 |  66 |  56½|  49½|  44 |  39½\r\n4  do.    | 303 | 151 | 101 |  75½|  60½|  50½|  43¼|  37¾|  33½|  30¼\r\n4½ do.    | 239 | 120 |  79½|  60 |  47¾|  39¾|  34¼|  30 |  26½|  24\r\n5  do.    | 194 |  97 |  64½|  48½|  38¾|  32¼|  27¾|  24¼|  21½|  19¼\r\n5½ do.    | 160 |  80 |  53½|  40 |  32 |  26¾|  22¾|  20 |  17¾|  16\r\n6  do.    | 131 |  67 |  44¾|  33½|  27 |  22½|  19¼|  16¾|  15 |  13½\r\n6½ do.    | 115 |  57½|  38¼|  28¾|  23 |  19 |  16¼|  14¼|  12¾|  11½\r\n7  do.    |  99 |  49½|  33 |  24¾|  19¾|  16½|  14 |  12¼|  11 |  10\r\n7½ do.    |  86 |  43 |  28¾|  21½|  17¼|  14¼|  12¼|  10¾|   9½|   8½\r\n8  do.    |  75½|  37¾|  25¼|  19 |  15¾|  12½|  10¾|   9½|   8½|   7½\r\n8½ do.    |  67 |  33½|  22¼|  16¾|  13½|  11¼|   9½|   8½|   7½|   6¾\r\n9  do.    |  60 |  30 |  20 |  15 |  12 |  10 |   8½|   7¾|   6¾|   6\r\n9½ do.    |  53½|  26¾|  18 |  13½|  10¾|   9 |   7¾|   6¾|   6 |   5¼\r\n10 do.    |  48½|  24¼|  16¼|  12 |   9¾|   8 |   7 |   6 |   5½|   4¾\r\n----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\n_Example 1._--Required, the number of loads necessary to manure an acre\r\nof ground, dividing each load into six heaps, and placing them at a\r\ndistance of 4½ yards from each other?

The second? Third? Fourth?\r\n\r\nDo all mineral manures possess all of these qualities?]\r\n\r\nThe second class of manures named in the general division of the\r\nsubject, in the early part of this chapter, comprises those of a mineral\r\ncharacter, or _inorganic_ manures.\r\n\r\nThese manures have four kinds of action when applied to the soil.\r\n\r\n1st. They furnish food for the inorganic part of plants.\r\n\r\n2d. They prepare matters already in the soil, for assimilation by roots.\r\n\r\n3d. They improve the mechanical condition of the soil.\r\n\r\n4th. They absorb ammonia.\r\n\r\nSome of the mineral manures produce in the soil only one of these\r\neffects, and others are efficient in two or all of them.\r\n\r\nThe principles to be considered in the use of mineral manures are\r\nessentially given in the first two sections of this book. It may be\r\nwell, however, to repeat them briefly in this connection, and to give\r\nthe _reasons_ why any of these manures are needed, from which we may\r\nlearn what rules are to be observed in their application.\r\n\r\n[Relate what you know of the properties of vegetable ashes?\r\n\r\nHow does this relate to the fertility of the soil?\r\n\r\nAccording to what two rules may we apply mineral manures?\r\n\r\nWhat course would you pursue to raise potatoes on a soil containing a\r\nvery little phosphoric acid and no potash?]\r\n\r\n1st. Those which are used as food by plants. It will be recollected that\r\nthe _ash_ left after burning plants, and which formed a part of their\r\nstructures, has a certain chemical composition; that is, it consists of\r\nalkalies, acids, and neutrals. It was also stated that the ashes of\r\nplants of the same kind are always of about the same composition, while\r\nthe ashes of different kinds of plants may vary materially. Different\r\nparts of the same plant too, as we learned, are supplied with different\r\nkinds of ash.\r\n\r\nFor instance, _clover_, on being burned, leaves an ash containing\r\n_lime_, as one of its principal ingredients, while the ash of _potatoes_\r\ncontains more of _potash_ than of any thing else.\r\n\r\nIn the second section (on soils), we learned that some soils contain\r\nevery thing necessary to make the ashes of all plants, and in sufficient\r\nquantity to supply what is required, while other soils are either\r\nentirely deficient in one or more ingredients, or contain so little of\r\nthem that they are unfertile for certain plants.\r\n\r\n[Would you manure it in the same way for wheat?\r\n\r\nWhy?]\r\n\r\nFrom this, we see that we may pursue either one of two courses. After we\r\nknow the exact composition of the soil--which we can learn only from\r\ncorrect analysis--we may manure it with a view either to making it\r\nfertile for all kinds of plants or only for one particular plant. For\r\ninstance, we may find that a soil contains a very little phosphoric\r\nacid, and no potash. If we wish to raise potatoes on such a soil, we\r\nhave only to apply potash (if the soil is good in other particulars),\r\nwhich is largely required by this plant, though it needs but little\r\nphosphoric acid; while, if we wish to make it fertile for wheat, and all\r\nother plants, we must apply more phosphoric acid as well as potash. As a\r\nuniversal rule, it may be stated that to render a soil fertile for any\r\nparticular plant, we must supply it (unless it already contains them)\r\nwith those matters which are necessary to _make_ the ash of that plant;\r\nand, if we would render it capable of producing _all_ kinds of plants,\r\nit must be furnished with the materials required in the formation of\r\n_all kinds of vegetable ashes_.\r\n\r\nIt is not absolutely necessary to have the soil analyzed before it can\r\nbe cultivated with success, but it is the _cheapest_ way.\r\n\r\n[How is the fertility of the soil to be maintained, if the\r\ncrops are _sold_?\r\n\r\nWhat rule is given for general treatment?\r\n\r\nGive an instance of matters in the soil that are to be rendered\r\navailable by mineral manures?]\r\n\r\nWe might proceed from an analysis of the plant required (which will be\r\nfound in Section V.), and apply to the soil in the form of manure every\r\nthing that is necessary for the formation of the ash of that plant. This\r\nwould give a good crop on _any_ soil that was in the proper _mechanical_\r\ncondition, and contained enough organic matter; but a moment's\r\nreflection will show that, if the soil contained a large amount of\r\npotash, or of phosphate of lime, it would not be necessary to make an\r\napplication of more of these ingredients--at an expense of perhaps three\r\ntimes the cost of an analysis. It is true that, if the crop is _sold_,\r\nand it is desired to maintain the fertility of the soil, the full amount\r\nof the ash must be applied, either before or after the crop is grown;\r\nbut, in the ordinary use of crops for feeding purposes, a large part of\r\nthe ash will exist in the excrements of the animals; so that the\r\njudicious farmer will be able to manure his land with more economy than\r\nif he had to apply to each crop the whole amount and variety required\r\nfor its ash. The best rule for practical manuring is probably to\r\n_strengthen the soil in its weaker points, and prevent the stronger ones\r\nfrom becoming weaker_. In this way, the soil may be raised to the\r\nhighest state of fertility, and be fully maintained in its productive\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n2d. Those manures which render available matter already contained in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n[How may silica be developed?\r\n\r\nHow does lime affect soils containing coarse particles?\r\n\r\nHow do mineral manures sometimes improve the mechanical texture of the\r\nsoil?]\r\n\r\nSilica (or sand), it will be recollected, exists in all soils; but, in\r\nits pure state, is not capable of being dissolved, and therefore cannot\r\nbe used by plants. The alkalies (as has been stated), have the power of\r\ncombining with this silica, making compounds, which are called\r\n_silicates_. These are readily dissolved by water, and are available in\r\nvegetable growth. Now, if a soil is deficient in these soluble\r\nsilicates, it is well known that grain, etc., grown on it, not being\r\nable to obtain the material which gives them strength, will fall down or\r\n_lodge_; but, if such measures be taken, as will render the sand\r\nsoluble, the straw will be strong and healthy. Alkalies used for this\r\npurpose, come under the head of those manures which develope the natural\r\nresources of the soil.\r\n\r\nAgain, much of the mineral matter in the soil is combined within\r\nparticles, and is therefore out of the reach of roots. Lime, among other\r\nthing, has the effect of causing these particles to crumble and expose\r\ntheir constituents to the demand of roots. Therefore, lime has for one\r\nof its offices the development of the fertilizing ingredients of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n3d. Those manures which improve the mechanical condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe alkalies, in combining with sand, commence their action on the\r\nsurfaces of the particles, and roughen them--_rust_ them as it were.\r\nThis roughening of particles of the soil prevents them from moving among\r\neach other as easily as they do when they are smooth, and thus keeps the\r\nsoil from being compacted by heavy rains, as it is liable to be in its\r\nnatural condition. In this way, the mechanical texture of the soil is\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nIt has just been said that _lime_ causes the pulverization of the\r\nparticles of the soil; and thus, by making it finer, improves its\r\nmechanical condition.\r\n\r\nSome mineral manures, as plaster and salt, have the power of absorbing\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere; and this is a mechanical improvement to\r\ndry soils.\r\n\r\n[Name some mineral manures which absorb ammonia?]\r\n\r\n4th. Those mineral manures which have the power of absorbing ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Plaster_, _chloride of lime_, _alumina_ (_clay_), etc., are large\r\nabsorbents of ammonia, whether arising from the fermentation of animal\r\nmanures or washed down from the atmosphere by rains. The ammonia thus\r\nabsorbed is of course very important in the vegetation of crops.\r\n\r\nHaving now explained the reasons why mineral manures are necessary, and\r\nthe manner in which they produce their effects, we will proceed to\r\nexamine the various deficiencies of soils and the character of many\r\nkinds of this class of fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDEFICIENCIES OF SOILS, MEANS OF RESTORATION, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by referring to the analyses of soils on p. 72, they\r\nmay be deficient in certain ingredients, which it is the object of\r\nmineral manures to supply. These we will take up in order, and endeavor\r\nto show in a simple manner the best means of managing them in practical\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES.\r\n\r\nPOTASH.\r\n\r\n[Do all soils contain a sufficient amount of potash?\r\n\r\nHow may its deficiency have been caused?\r\n\r\nHow may its absence be detected?\r\n\r\nDoes barn-yard manure contain sufficient potash to supply its deficiency\r\nin worn-out soils?]\r\n\r\n_Potash_ is often deficient in the soil. Its deficiency may have been\r\ncaused in two ways. Either it may not have existed largely in the rock\r\nfrom which the soil was formed, and consequently is equally absent from\r\nthe soil itself, or it may have once been present in sufficient\r\nquantities, and been carried away in crops, without being returned to\r\nthe soil in the form of manure until too little remains for the\r\nrequirements of fertility.\r\n\r\nIn either case, its absence may be accurately detected by a skilful\r\nchemist, and it may be supplied by the farmer in various ways. Potash,\r\nas well as all of the other mineral manures, is contained in the\r\nexcrements of animals, but not (as is also the case with the others) in\r\nsufficient quantities to restore the proper balance to soils where it is\r\nlargely deficient, nor even to make up for what is yearly removed with\r\neach crop, except that crop (or its equivalent) has been fed to such\r\nanimals as return _all_ of the fertilizing constituents of their food in\r\nthe form of manure, and this be all carefully preserved and applied to\r\nthe soil. In all other cases, it is necessary to apply more potash than\r\nis contained in the excrements of animals.\r\n\r\n[What is generally the most available source from which to\r\nobtain this alkali?\r\n\r\nWill leached ashes answer the same purpose?\r\n\r\nHow may ashes be used?]\r\n\r\n_Unleached wood ashes_ is generally the most available source from which\r\nto obtain this alkali. The ashes of all kinds of wood contain potash\r\n(more or less according to the kind--see analysis section V.) If the\r\nashes are _leached_, the potash is removed; and, hence for the purpose\r\nof supplying it, they are worthless; but _unleached_ ashes are an\r\nexcellent source from which to obtain it. They may be made into compost\r\nwith muck, as directed in a previous chapter, or applied directly to the\r\nsoil. In either case the potash is available directly to the plant, or\r\nis capable of uniting with the silica in the soil to form silicate of\r\npotash. Neither potash nor any other alkali should ever be applied to\r\nanimal manures unless in compost with an absorbent, as they cause the\r\nammonia to be thrown off and lost.\r\n\r\n[From what other sources may potash be obtained?\r\n\r\nHow may we obtain soda?\r\n\r\nIn what quantities should pure salt be applied to the soil?]\r\n\r\n_Potash sparlings_, or the refuse of potash warehouses, is an excellent\r\nmanure for lands deficient in this constituent.\r\n\r\n_Potash marl_, such as is found in New Jersey, contains a large\r\nproportion of potash, and is an excellent application to soils requiring\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Feldspar_, _kaolin_, and other minerals containing potash, are, in some\r\nlocalities, to be obtained in sufficient quantities to be used for\r\nmanurial purposes.\r\n\r\n_Granite_ contains potash, and if it can be crushed (as is the case with\r\nsome of the softer kinds,) it serves a very good purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA.\r\n\r\n[If applied in large quantities will it produce permanent\r\ninjury?\r\n\r\nIn what quantities should salt be applied to composts? To asparagus?]\r\n\r\n_Soda_, the requirement of which is occasioned by the same causes as\r\ncreate a deficiency of potash, and all of the other ingredients of\r\nvegetable ashes, may be very readily supplied by the use of _common\r\nsalt_ (chloride of sodium), which consists of about one half sodium (the\r\nbase of soda). The best way to use salt is in the lime and salt mixture,\r\npreviously described, or as a direct application to the soil. If too\r\nmuch salt be given to the soil it will kill any plant. In small\r\nquantities, however, it is highly beneficial, and if _six bushels per\r\nacre_ be sown broadcast over the land, to be carried in by rains and\r\ndews, it will not only destroy many insects (grubs, worms, etc.), but\r\nwill, after decomposing and becoming chlorine and soda, prove an\r\nexcellent manure. Salt, even in quantities large enough to denude the\r\nsoil of all vegetation, is never _permanently_ injurious. After the\r\nfirst year, it becomes resolved into its constituents, and furnishes\r\nchlorine and soda to plants, without injuring them. One bushel of salt\r\nin each cord of compost will not only hasten the decomposition of the\r\nmanures, but will kill all seeds and grubs--a very desirable effect.\r\nWhile small quantities of salt in a compost heap are beneficial, too\r\nmuch (as when applied to the soil) is positively injurious, as it\r\narrests decomposition; fairly _pickles_ the manures, and prevents them\r\nfrom rotting.\r\n\r\n[What is generally the best way to use salt?\r\n\r\nWhat is nitrate of soda?\r\n\r\nWhat plants contain lime?]\r\n\r\nFor _asparagus_, which is a marine plant, salt is an excellent manure,\r\nand may be applied in almost unlimited quantities, _while the plants are\r\ngrowing_, if used after they have gone to top, it is injurious. Salt has\r\nbeen applied to asparagus beds in such quantities as to completely cover\r\nthem, and with apparent benefit to the plants. Of course large doses of\r\nsalt kill all weeds, and thus save labor and the injury to the asparagus\r\nroots, which would result from their removal by hoeing. Salt may be used\r\nadvantageously in any of the foregoing manners, but should always be\r\napplied with care. For ordinary farm purposes, it is undoubtedly most\r\nprofitable to use the salt with lime, and make it perform the double\r\nduty of assisting in the decomposition of vegetable matter, and\r\nfertilizing the soil.\r\n\r\nSoda unites with the silica in the soil, and forms the valuable\r\n_silicate of soda_.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of soda_, or cubical nitre, which is found in South America,\r\nconsists of soda and nitric acid. It furnishes both soda and nitrogen to\r\nplants, and is an excellent manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _lime_ is one of most vital importance to the farmer;\r\nindeed, so varied are its modes of action and its effects, that some\r\nwriters have given it credit for every thing good in the way of farming,\r\nand have gone so far as to say that _all_ permanent improvement of\r\nagriculture must depend on the use of lime. Although this is far in\r\nexcess of the truth (as lime cannot plow, nor drain, nor supply any\r\nthing but _lime_ to the soil), its many beneficial effects demand for it\r\nthe closest attention.\r\n\r\n[Do all soils contain enough lime for the use of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat amount is needed for this purpose?\r\n\r\nWhat is its first-named effect on the soil?\r\n\r\nIts second? Third? Fourth? Fifth?\r\n\r\nHow are acids produced in the soil?]\r\n\r\nAs food for plants, lime is of considerable importance. All plants\r\ncontain lime--some of them in large quantities. It is an important\r\nconstituent of straw, meadow hay, leaves of fruit trees, peas, beans,\r\nand turnips. It constitutes more than one third of the ash of red\r\nclover. Many soils contain lime enough for the use of plants, in others\r\nit is deficient, and must be supplied artificially before they can\r\nproduce good crops of those plants of which lime is an important\r\ningredient. The only way in which the exact quantity of lime in the soil\r\ncan be ascertained is by chemical analysis. However, the amount required\r\nfor the mere feeding plants is not large, (much less than one per\r\ncent.), but lime is often necessary for other purposes; and setting\r\naside, for the present, its feeding action, we will examine its various\r\neffects on the mechanical and chemical condition of the soil.\r\n\r\n1. It corrects acidity (sourness).\r\n\r\n2. It hastens the decomposition of the organic matter in the soil.\r\n\r\n3. It causes the mineral particles of the soil to crumble.\r\n\r\n4. By producing the above effects, it prepares the constituents of the\r\nsoil for assimilation by plants.\r\n\r\n5. It is _said_ to exhaust the soil, but it does so in a very desirable\r\nmanner, the injurious effects of which may be easily avoided.\r\n\r\n[How does lime correct them?\r\n\r\nHow does it affect animal manures in the soil?]\r\n\r\n1. The decomposition of organic matter in the soil, often produces\r\nacids which makes the land _sour_, and cause it to produce sorrel and\r\nother weeds, which interfere with the healthy growth of crops. Lime is\r\nan _alkali_, and if applied to soils suffering from sourness, it will\r\nunite with the acids, and neutralize them, so that they will no longer\r\nbe injurious.\r\n\r\n2. We have before stated that lime is a decomposing agent, and hastens\r\nthe rotting of muck and other organic matter. It has the same effect on\r\nthe organic parts of the soil, and causes them to be resolved into the\r\ngases and minerals of which they are formed. It has this effect,\r\nespecially, on organic matters containing _nitrogen_, causing them to\r\nthrow off ammonia; consequently, it liberates this gas from the animal\r\nmanures in the soil.\r\n\r\n3. Various inorganic compounds in the soil are so affected by lime, that\r\nthey lose their power of holding together, and crumble, or are reduced\r\nto finer particles, while some of their constituents are rendered\r\nsoluble. One way in which this is accomplished is by the action of the\r\nlime on the silica contained in these compounds, forming the silicate of\r\nlime. This crumbling effect improves the mechanical as well as the\r\nchemical condition of the soil.\r\n\r\n4. We are now enabled to see how lime prepares the constituents of the\r\nsoil for the use of plants.\r\n\r\n[Inorganic compounds?\r\n\r\nHow does lime prepare the constituents of the soil for use?\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of the remark that lime exhausts the organic matter in\r\nthe soil?]\r\n\r\nBy its action on the roots, buried stubble, and other organic matter in\r\nthe soil, it causes them to be decomposed, and to give up many of their\r\ngaseous and inorganic constituents for the use of roots. In this manner\r\nthe organic matter is prepared for use more rapidly than would be the\r\ncase, if there were no lime present to hasten its decomposition.\r\n\r\nBy the decomposing action of lime on the mineral parts of the soil (3),\r\nthey also are placed more rapidly in a useful condition than would be\r\nthe case, if their preparation depended on the slow action of\r\natmospheric influences.\r\n\r\nThus, we see that lime, aside from its use directly as food for plants,\r\nexerts a beneficial influence on both the organic and inorganic parts of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n5. Many contend that lime _exhausts_ the soil.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the manner in which it does so, we shall see that this is\r\nno argument against its use.\r\n\r\n[How can lime exhaust the mineral parts of the soil?\r\n\r\nMust the matter taken away be returned to the soil?]\r\n\r\nIt exhausts the organic parts of the soil, by decomposing them, and\r\nresolving them into the gases and minerals of which they are composed.\r\nIf the soil do not contain a sufficient quantity of absorbent matter,\r\nsuch as clay or charcoal, the gases arising from the organic matter are\r\nliable to escape; but when there is a sufficient amount of these\r\nsubstances present (as there always should be), these gases are all\r\nretained until required by the roots of plants. Hence, although the\r\norganic matter of manure and vegetable substances may be _altered in\r\nform_, by the use of lime, it can escape (except in very poor soils)\r\nonly as it is taken up by roots to feed the crop, and such exhaustion is\r\ncertainly profitable; still, in order that the fertility of the soil may\r\nbe _maintained_, enough of organic manure should be applied, to make up\r\nfor the amount taken from the soil by the crop, after liberation for its\r\nuse by the action of the lime. This will be but a small proportion of\r\nthe organic matter contained in the crop, as it obtains the larger part\r\nfrom the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which lime can exhaust the inorganic part of the soil\r\nis, by altering its condition, so that plants can use it more readily.\r\nThat is, it exposes it for solution in water. We have seen that\r\nfertilizing matter cannot be leached out of a good soil, in any material\r\nquantity, but can only be carried down to a depth of about thirty-four\r\ninches. Hence, we see that there can be no loss in this direction; and,\r\nas inorganic matter cannot evaporate from the soil, the only way in\r\nwhich it can escape is through the structure of plants.\r\n\r\n[If this course be pursued, will the soil suffer from the use\r\nof lime?\r\n\r\nIs it the lime, or its crop, that exhausts the soil?\r\n\r\nIs lime containing magnesia better than pure lime?\r\n\r\nWhat is the best kind of lime?]\r\n\r\nIf lime is applied to the soil, and increases the amount of crops grown\r\nby furnishing a larger supply of inorganic matter, of course, the\r\nremoval of inorganic substances from the soil will be more rapid than\r\nwhen only a small amount of crop is grown, and the soil will be sooner\r\nexhausted--not by the lime, but by the plants. In order to make up for\r\nthis exhaustion, it is necessary that a sufficient amount of inorganic\r\nmatter be supplied to compensate for the increased quantity taken away\r\nby plants.\r\n\r\nThus we see, that it is hardly fair to accuse the _lime_ of exhausting\r\nthe soil, when it only improves its character, and increases the amount\r\nof its yield. It is the _crop_ that takes away the fertility of the soil\r\n(the same as would be the case if no lime were used, only faster as the\r\ncrop is larger), and in all judicious cultivation, this loss will be\r\nfully compensated by the application of manures, thereby preventing the\r\nexhaustion of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Is the purchase of marl to be recommended?\r\n\r\nHow is lime prepared for use? (Note.)\r\n\r\nDescribe the burning and slaking of lime.]\r\n\r\n_Kind of lime to be used._ The first consideration in procuring lime for\r\nmanuring land, is to select that which contains but little, if any\r\n_magnesia_. Nearly all stone lime contains more or less of this, but\r\nsome kinds contain more than others. When magnesia is applied to the\r\nsoil, in too large quantities, it is positively injurious to plants, and\r\ngreat care is necessary in making selection. As a general rule, it may\r\nbe stated, that the best plastering lime makes the best manure. Such\r\nkinds only should be used as are known from experiment not to be\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\n_Shell lime_ is undoubtedly the best of all, for it contains no\r\nmagnesia, and it does contain a small quantity of _phosphate of lime_.\r\nIn the vicinity of the sea-coast, and near the lines of railroads,\r\noyster shells, clam shells, etc., can be cheaply procured. These may be\r\nprepared for use in the same manner as stone lime.[AG]\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the lime_ is done by first burning and then slaking,\r\nor by putting it directly on the land, in an unslaked condition, after\r\nits having been burned. Shells are sometimes _ground_, and used without\r\nburning; this is hardly advisable, as they cannot be made so fine as by\r\nburning and slaking. As was stated in the first section of this book,\r\nlime usually exists in nature, in the form of carbonate of lime, as\r\nlimestone, chalk, or marble (being lime and carbonic acid combined), and\r\nwhen this is burned, the carbonic acid is thrown off, leaving the lime\r\nin a pure or caustic form. This is called burned lime, quick-lime, lime\r\nshells, hot lime, etc. If the proper quantity of water be poured on it,\r\nit is immediately taken up by the lime, which falls into a dry powder,\r\ncalled _slaked lime_. If _quick-lime_ were left exposed to the weather,\r\nit would absorb moisture from the atmosphere, and become what is termed\r\n_air slaked_.\r\n\r\n[What is air slaking?\r\n\r\nIf slaked lime be exposed to the air, what change does it undergo?\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of slaking lime?\r\n\r\nHow much carbonic acid is contained in a ton of carbonate of lime?\r\n\r\nHow much lime does a ton of slaked lime contain?\r\n\r\nWhat is the most economical form for transportation?]\r\n\r\nWhen _slaked lime_ (consisting of lime and water) is exposed to the\r\natmosphere, it absorbs carbonic acid, and becomes carbonate of lime\r\nagain; but it is now in the form of a very fine powder, and is much more\r\nuseful than when in the stone.\r\n\r\nIf quick-lime is applied directly to the soil, it absorbs first\r\nmoisture, and then carbonic acid, becoming finally a powdered carbonate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\nOne ton of _carbonate of lime_ contains 11¼ cwt. of lime; the remainder\r\nis carbonic acid. One ton of _slaked lime_ contains about 15 cwt. of\r\nlime; the remainder is water.\r\n\r\nHence we see that lime should be burned, and not slaked, before being\r\ntransported, as it would be unprofitable to transport the large quantity\r\nof carbonic acid and water contained in carbonate of lime and slaked\r\nlime. The quick-lime may be slaked, and carbonated after reaching its\r\ndestination, either before or after being applied to the land.\r\n\r\n[What is the best form for immediate action on the inorganic\r\nmatter in the soil?\r\n\r\nFor most other purposes?]\r\n\r\nAs has been before stated, much is gained by slaking lime with _salt\r\nwater_, thus imitating the lime and salt mixture. Indeed in many cases,\r\nit will be found profitable to use all lime in this way. Where a direct\r\naction on the inorganic matters contained in the soil is desired, it may\r\nbe well to apply the lime directly in the form of quick-lime; but, where\r\nthe decomposition of the vegetable and animal constituents of the soil\r\nis desired, the correction of _sourness_, or the supplying of lime to\r\nthe crop, the mixture with salt would be advisable.\r\n\r\n_The amount of lime_ required _by plants_ is, as was before observed,\r\nusually small compared with the whole amount contained in the soil;\r\nstill it is not unimportant.\r\n\r\n                                  OF LIME.\r\n25 bus. of wheat contain about    13   lbs.\r\n25     \"   barley        \"        10½   \"\r\n25     \"   oats          \"        11    \"\r\n 2 tons of turnips       \"        12    \"\r\n 2     \"  potatoes       \"         5    \"\r\n 2     \"  red clover     \"        77    \"\r\n 2     \"  rye grass      \"        30    \"[AH]\r\n\r\n[What is the best guide concerning the quantity of lime to be\r\napplied?\r\n\r\nWhat is said of the sinking of lime in the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat is plaster of Paris composed of?\r\n\r\nWhy is it called plaster of Paris?]\r\n\r\nThe amount of lime required at each application, and the frequency of\r\nthose applications, must depend on the chemical and mechanical condition\r\nof the soil. No exact rule can be given, but probably the custom of each\r\ndistrict--regulated by long experience--is the best guide.\r\n\r\n_Lime sinks in the soil_; and therefore, when used alone, should always\r\nbe applied as a top dressing to be carried into the soil by rains. The\r\ntendency of lime to settle is so great that, when cutting drains, it may\r\noften be observed in a whitish streak on the top of the subsoil. After\r\nheavy doses of lime have been given to the soil, and have settled so as\r\nto have apparently ceased from their action, they may be brought up and\r\nmixed with the soil by deeper plowing.\r\n\r\n_Lime should never be mixed with animal manures_, unless in compost with\r\nmuck, or some other good absorbent, as it is liable to cause the escape\r\nof their ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASTER OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n_Plaster of Paris or Gypsum_ (sulphate of lime) is composed of sulphuric\r\nacid and lime in combination. It is called 'plaster of Paris,' because\r\nit constitutes the rock underlying the city of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Is it a constituent of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat else does it furnish them?\r\n\r\nHow does it affect manure?\r\n\r\nHow does it produce sorrel in the soil?\r\n\r\nHow may the acidity be overcome?]\r\n\r\nIt is a constituent of many plants. It also furnishes them with\r\nsulphur--a constituent of the sulphuric acid which it contains.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent absorbent of ammonia, and is very useful to sprinkle\r\naround stables, poultry houses, pig-styes, and privies, where it absorbs\r\nthe escaping gases, saving them for the use of plants, and purifying the\r\nair, thus rendering stables, etc., more healthy than when not so\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the extravagant use of plaster sometimes\r\ninduces the growth of _sorrel_. This is probably the case only where the\r\nsoil is deficient in lime. In such instances, the lime required by\r\nplants is obtained by the decomposition of the plaster. The lime enters\r\ninto the construction of the plant, and the sulphuric acid remains\r\n_free_, rendering the soil _sour_, and therefore in condition to produce\r\nsorrel. In such a case, an application of _lime_ will correct the acid\r\nby uniting with it and converting it into _plaster_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE OF LIME.\r\n\r\n[What does chloride of lime supply to plants?\r\n\r\nHow does it affect manures?\r\n\r\nHow may it be used?\r\n\r\nHow may magnesia be supplied, when wanting?\r\n\r\nWhat care is necessary concerning the use of magnesia?]\r\n\r\n_Chloride of lime_ is a compound of _lime and chlorine_. It furnishes\r\nboth of these constituents to plants, and it is an excellent absorbent\r\nof ammonia and other gases arising from decomposition--hence its\r\nusefulness in destroying bad odors, and in preserving fertilizing\r\nmatters for the use of crops.\r\n\r\nIt may be used like plaster, or in the decomposition of organic matters,\r\nwhere it not only hastens decay, but absorbs and retains the escaping\r\ngases. It will be recollected that _chloride of lime_ is one of the\r\nproducts of the _lime and salt mixture_.\r\n\r\n_Lime_ in combination with _phosphoric acid_ forms the valuable\r\n_phosphate of lime_, of which so large a portion of the ash of grain,\r\nand the bones of animals, is formed. This will be spoken of more at\r\nlength under the head of 'phosphoric acid.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNESIA.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is a constituent of vegetable ashes, and is almost always\r\npresent in the soil in sufficient quantities. When analysis indicates\r\nthat it is needed, it may be applied in the form of _magnesian lime_, or\r\n_refuse epsom salts_, which are composed of sulphuric acid and magnesia\r\n(sulphate of magnesia).\r\n\r\nThe great care necessary concerning the use of magnesia is, not to apply\r\ntoo much of it, it being, when in excess, as has been previously\r\nremarked, injurious to the fertility of the soil. Some soils are\r\nhopelessly barren from the fact that they contain too much magnesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDS.\r\n\r\nSULPHURIC ACID.\r\n\r\n[What is sulphuric acid commonly called?\r\n\r\nHow may it be used?\r\n\r\nHow does it prevent the escape of ammonia?]\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ is a very important constituent of vegetable ashes,\r\nespecially of oats and the root-crops.\r\n\r\nIt is often deficient in the soil, particularly where potatoes have been\r\nlong cultivated. One of the reasons why _plaster_ (sulphate of lime) is\r\nso beneficial to the potato crop is undoubtedly that it supplies it with\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is commonly known by the name of _oil vitriol_, and may\r\nbe purchased for agricultural purposes at a low price. It may be used in\r\na very dilute form (weakened by mixing it with a large quantity of\r\nwater) to the compost heap, where it will change the ammonia to a\r\nsulphate as soon as formed, and thus prevent its loss, as the sulphate\r\nof ammonia is not volatile; and, being soluble in water, is useful to\r\nplants. Some idea of the value of this compound may be formed from the\r\nfact that manufacturers of manures are willing to pay seven cents per\r\nlb., or even more, for sulphate of ammonia, to insure the success of\r\ntheir fertilizers. Notwithstanding this, many farmers persist in\r\nthrowing away hundreds of pounds of _ammonia_ every year, as a tax for\r\ntheir ignorance (or indolence), while a small tax in _money_--not more\r\nvaluable, nor more necessary to their success--for the support of common\r\nschools, and the better education of the young, is too often unwillingly\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n[What is the effect of using too much sulphuric acid?]\r\n\r\nIf a tumbler full of sulphuric acid (costing a few cents), be thrown\r\ninto the tank of the compost heap once a month, the benefit to the\r\nmanure would be very great.\r\n\r\nWhere a deficiency of sulphuric acid in the soil is indicated by\r\nanalysis, it may be supplied in this way, or by the use of plaster or\r\nrefuse epsom salts.\r\n\r\nCare is necessary that _too much_ sulphuric acid be not used, as it\r\nwould prevent the proper decomposition of manures, and would induce a\r\ngrowth of sorrel in the soil by making it _sour_.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, it will be found profitable to use sulphuric acid in\r\nthe manufacture of super-phosphate of lime (as directed under the head\r\nof 'phosphoric acid,') thus making it perform the double purpose of\r\npreparing an available form of phosphate, and of supplying sulphur and\r\nsulphuric acid to the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORIC ACID.\r\n\r\n[How large a part of the ashes of grain consists of phosphoric\r\nacid?\r\n\r\nOf what other substances does it form a leading ingredient?\r\n\r\nHow many pounds of sulphuric acid are contained in one hundred bushels\r\nof wheat?]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of one of the most important of all\r\nsubjects connected with agriculture, that is, _phosphoric acid_.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid_, forming about one half of the ashes of wheat, rye,\r\ncorn, buckwheat, and oats; nearly the same proportion of those of\r\nbarley, peas, beans and linseed; an important ingredient of the ashes of\r\npotatoes and turnips; one quarter of the ash of milk and a large\r\nproportion of the bones of animals, often exists in the soil in the\r\nproportion of only about one or two pounds in a thousand. The\r\ncultivation of our whole country has been such, as to take away the\r\nphosphoric acid from the soil without returning it, except in very\r\nminute quantities. Every hundred bushels of wheat sold contains (and\r\nremoves permanently from the soil) about _sixty pounds_ of phosphoric\r\nacid. Other grains, as well as the root crops and grasses, remove\r\nlikewise a large quantity of it. It has been said by a contemporary\r\nwriter, that for each cow kept on a pasture through the summer, there is\r\ncarried off in veal, butter and cheese, not less than _fifty_ lbs. of\r\nphosphate of lime (bone-earth) on an average. This would be _one\r\nthousand lbs._ for twenty cows; and it shows clearly why old dairy\r\npastures become so exhausted of this substance, that they will no longer\r\nproduce those nutritious grasses, which are favorable to butter and\r\ncheese-making.\r\n\r\n[How much phosphate of lime will twenty cows remove from a\r\npasture during a summer?\r\n\r\nWhat has this removal of phosphate of lime occasioned?\r\n\r\nHow have the Genesee and Mohawk valleys been affected by this removal of\r\nphosphoric acid?]\r\n\r\nThat this removal of the most valuable constituent of the soil, has been\r\nthe cause of more exhaustion of farms, and more emigration, in search of\r\nfertile districts, than any other single effect of injudicious farming,\r\nis a fact which multiplied instances most clearly prove.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the Genesee and Mohawk valleys, which once produced an\r\naverage of _thirty-five_ or _forty bushels_ of wheat, per acre, have\r\nsince been reduced in their average production to _twelve and a half_\r\nbushels. Hundreds of similar cases might be stated; and in a large\r\nmajority of these, could the cause of the impoverishment be ascertained,\r\nit would be found to be the removal of the phosphoric acid from the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n[How may this devastation be arrested?\r\n\r\nIs any soil inexhaustible?\r\n\r\nWhat is usually the best source from which to obtain phosphoric acid?]\r\n\r\nThe evident tendency of cultivation being to continue this murderous\r\nsystem, and to prey upon the vital strength of the country, it is\r\nnecessary to take such measures as will arrest the outflow of this\r\nvaluable material. This can never be fully accomplished until laws shall\r\nbe made preventing the wastes of cities and towns. Such laws have\r\nexisted for a long time in China, and have doubtlessly been the secret\r\nof the long subsistence and present prosperity of the millions of people\r\ninhabiting that country.\r\n\r\nWe have, nevertheless, a means of restoring to fertility many of our\r\nworn-out lands, and preserving our fertile fields from so rapid\r\nimpoverishment as they are now suffering. Many suppose that soils which\r\nproduce good crops, year after year, are inexhaustible, but time will\r\nprove to the contrary. They may possess a sufficiently large stock of\r\nphosphoric acid, and other constituents of plants, to last a long time,\r\nbut when that stock becomes so reduced, that there is not enough left\r\nfor the uses of full crops, the productive power of the soil will yearly\r\ndecrease, until it becomes worthless. It may last a long time, a\r\ncentury, or even more, but as long as the system is--to _remove every\r\nthing, and return nothing_,--the fate of the most fertile soil is\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nThe source mentioned, from which to obtain phosphoric acid, is the bones\r\nof animals. These contain large quantities of _phosphate of lime_. They\r\nare the receptacles which collect nearly all of the phosphates in crops,\r\nwhich are fed to animals, and are not returned in their excrements. For\r\nthe grain, etc., sent out of the country, there is no way to be repaid\r\nexcept by the importation of this material; but, all that is fed to\r\nanimals, or to human beings, may, if a proper use be made of their\r\nexcrement, and of their bones after death, be returned to the soil. With\r\nthe treatment of animal excrements we are already familiar, and we will\r\nnow turn our attention to the subject of\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\n[Of what do dried bones consist?\r\n\r\nWhat is the organic matter of bones?\r\n\r\nThe inorganic?\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of the use of whole bones?]\r\n\r\n_Bones_ consist, when dried, of about one third organic matter, and two\r\nthirds inorganic matter.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter consists chiefly of _gelatine_--a compound containing\r\n_nitrogen_.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic part is chiefly _phosphate of lime_.\r\n\r\nHence, we see that bones are excellent, as both organic and mineral\r\nmanure. The organic part, containing nitrogen, forms _ammonia_, and the\r\ninorganic part supplies the much needed _phosphoric acid_ to the soil.\r\n\r\nLiebig says that, as a producer of ammonia, 100 lbs. of dry bones are\r\nequivalent to 250 lbs. of human urine.\r\n\r\n[How does the value of bone dust compare with that of broken\r\nbones?\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason of the superiority of bone dust?\r\n\r\nHow is bone-black made?\r\n\r\nOf what does it consist?]\r\n\r\nBones are applied to the soil in almost every conceivable form. _Whole\r\nbones_ are often used in very large quantities; their action, however,\r\nis extremely slow, and it is never advisable to use bones in this form.\r\n\r\nTen bushels of bones, finely ground, will produce larger results, during\r\nthe current ten years after application, than would ensue from the use\r\nof one hundred bushels merely broken, not because the dust contains more\r\nfertilizing matter than the whole bones, but because that which it does\r\ncontain is in a much more available condition. It ferments readily, and\r\nproduces ammonia, while the ashy parts are exposed to the action of\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n[Should farmers burn bones before using them?\r\n\r\nHow would you compost bones with ashes?\r\n\r\nIn what way would you prevent the escape of ammonia?]\r\n\r\n_Bone-black._ If bones are burned in retorts, or otherwise protected\r\nfrom the atmosphere, their organic matter will all be driven off, except\r\nthe carbon, which not being supplied with oxygen cannot escape. In this\r\nform bones are called _ivory black_, or _bone-black_. It consists of the\r\ninorganic matter, and the carbon of the bones. The nitrogen having been\r\nexpelled it can make no ammonia, and thus far the original value of\r\nbones is reduced by burning; that is, one ton of bones contains more\r\nfertilizing matter before, than after burning; but one ton of bone black\r\nis more valuable than one ton of raw bones, as the carbon is retained in\r\na good form to act as an absorbent in the soil, while the whole may be\r\ncrushed or ground much more easily than before being burned. This means\r\nof pulverizing bones is adopted by manufacturers, who replace the\r\nammonia in the form of guano, or otherwise; but it is not to be\r\nrecommended for the use of farmers, who should not lose the ammonia,\r\nforming a part of bones, more than that of other manure.\r\n\r\n_Composting bones with ashes_ is a good means of securing their\r\ndecomposition. They should be placed in a water-tight vessel (such as a\r\ncask); first, three or four inches of bones, then the same quantity of\r\nstrong unleached wood ashes, continuing these alternate layers until the\r\ncask is full, and keeping them _always wet_. If they become too dry they\r\nwill throw off an offensive odor, accompanied by the escape of ammonia,\r\nand consequent loss of value. In about one year, the whole mass of bones\r\n(except, perhaps, those at the top) will be softened, so that they may\r\nbe easily crushed, and they are in a good condition for manuring. The\r\nashes are, in themselves, valuable, and this compost is excellent for\r\nmany crops, particularly for Indian corn. A little dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, occasionally sprinkled on the upper part of the matter in the\r\ncask, will prevent the escape of the ammonia.\r\n\r\n[What is the effect of boiling bones under pressure?\r\n\r\nHow is super-phosphate of lime made?\r\n\r\nDescribe the composition of phosphate of lime, and the chemical changes\r\nwhich take place in altering it to super-phosphate of lime.]\r\n\r\n_Boiling bones under pressure_, whereby their gelatine is dissolved\r\naway, and the inorganic matter left in an available condition, from its\r\nsoftness, is a very good way of rendering them useful; but, as it\r\nrequires, among other things, a steam boiler, it is hardly probable that\r\nit will be largely adopted by farmers of limited means.\r\n\r\nAny or all of these methods are good, but bones cannot be used with true\r\neconomy, except by changing their inorganic matter into\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPER-PHOSPHATE OF LIME.\r\n\r\n_Super-phosphate of lime_ is made by treating phosphate of lime, or the\r\nashes of bones, with _sulphuric acid_.\r\n\r\nPhosphate of lime, as it exists in bones, consists of one atom of\r\nphosphoric acid and three atoms of lime. It may be represented as\r\n\r\n                 { Lime\r\nPhosphoric acid  { Lime\r\n                 { Lime\r\n\r\nBy adding a proper quantity of sulphuric acid with this, it becomes\r\n_super_-phosphate of lime; that is, the same amount of phosphoric acid,\r\nwith a smaller proportion of lime (or a _super_-abundance of phosphoric\r\nacid), the sulphuric acid, taking two atoms of lime away from the\r\ncompound, combined with it making sulphate of lime (plaster). The\r\nchanges may be thus represented.\r\n\r\n                  {Phosphoric acid} Super-phosphate\r\nPhosphate of lime {Lime           }   of lime.\r\n                  {Lime}\r\n                  {Lime} Sulphate of lime.\r\n         Sulphuric acid}\r\n\r\nSuper-phosphate of lime may be made from whole bones, bone dust,\r\nbone-black, or from the pure ashes of bones.\r\n\r\n[How should sulphuric acid be applied to whole bones?\r\n\r\nWhat is the necessity for so large an amount of water?]\r\n\r\nThe process of making it from whole bones is slow and troublesome, as it\r\nrequires a long time for the effect to diffuse itself through the whole\r\nmass of a large bone. When it is made in this way, the bones should be\r\n_dry_, and the acid should be diluted in many times its bulk of water,\r\nand should be applied to the bones (which may be placed in a suitable\r\ncask, with a spiggot at the bottom), in quantities sufficient to cover\r\nthem, about once in ten days; and at the end of that time, one half of\r\nthe liquid should be drawn off by the spiggot. This liquid is a solution\r\nof super-phosphate of lime, containing sulphate of lime, and may be\r\napplied to the soil in a liquid form, or through the medium of a compost\r\nheap. The object of using so much water is to prevent an incrustation of\r\nsulphate of lime on the surfaces of the bones, this must be removed by\r\nstirring the mass, which allows the next application of acid to act\r\ndirectly on the phosphate remaining. The amount of acid required is\r\nabout 50 or 60 lbs. to each 100 lbs. of bones. The gelatine will remain\r\nafter the phosphate is all dissolved, and may be composted with muck, or\r\nplowed under the soil, where it will form ammonia.\r\n\r\n[May less water be employed in making super-phosphate from\r\nbone dust or crushed bones?]\r\n\r\n_Bone dust_, or _crushed bones_, may be much more easily changed to the\r\ndesired condition, as the surface exposed is much greater, and the acid\r\ncan act more generally throughout the whole mass. The amount of acid\r\nrequired is the same as in the other case, but it may be used\r\n_stronger_, two or three times its bulk of water being sufficient, if\r\nthe bones are finely ground or crushed--more or less water should be\r\nused according to the fineness of the bones. The time occupied will also\r\nbe much less, and the result of the operation will be in better\r\ncondition for manure.\r\n\r\nBones may be made fine enough for this operation, either by grinding,\r\netc., or by boiling under pressure, as previously described; indeed, by\r\nwhatever method bones are pulverized, they should always be treated with\r\nsulphuric acid before being applied to the soil, as this will more than\r\ndouble their value for immediate use.\r\n\r\nBone-black is chiefly used by manufacturers of super-phosphate of lime,\r\nwho treat it with acid the same as has been directed above, only that\r\nthey grind the black very finely before applying the acid.\r\n\r\n[What other forms of bones may be used in making\r\nsuper-phosphate of lime?\r\n\r\nWhy is super-phosphate of lime a better fertilizer than phosphate of\r\nlime?\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of the _lasting manures_?]\r\n\r\n_Bone ashes_, or bones burned to whiteness, may be similarly treated.\r\nIndeed, in all of the forms of bones here described, the phosphate of\r\nlime remains unaltered, as it is indestructible by heat; the differences\r\nof composition are only in the admixture of organic constituents.\r\n\r\n_The reason why super-phosphate of lime is so much better than\r\nphosphate_, may be easily explained. The _phosphate_ is very _slowly_\r\nsoluble in water, and consequently furnishes food to plants slowly. A\r\npiece of bone as large as a pea may lie in the soil for years without\r\nbeing all consumed; consequently, it will be years before its value is\r\nreturned, and it pays no interest on its cost while lying there. The\r\n_super-phosphate_ dissolves very _rapidly_ and furnishes food for plants\r\nwith equal facility; hence its much greater value as a manure.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the _phosphate_ is the most _lasting_ manure; but, once\r\nfor all, let us caution farmers against considering this a virtue in\r\nmineral manures, or in organic manures either, when used on soils\r\ncontaining the proper absorbents of ammonia. They are _lasting_, only\r\nin proportion as they are _lazy_. Manures are worthless unless they are\r\nin condition to be immediately used. The farmer who wishes his manures\r\nto _last_ in the soil, and to lose their use, may be justly compared\r\nwith the _miser_, who buries his gold and silver in the ground for the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that he owns it. It is an old and a true saying\r\nthat \"a nimble sixpence is better than a slow shilling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SUPER-PHOSPHATE OF LIME.\r\n\r\n[What are the ingredients of the _improved_ super-phosphate of\r\nlime?]\r\n\r\nTo show the manner in which super-phosphate of lime is perfected, and\r\nrendered the best manure for general uses, which has yet been made,\r\ncontaining large quantities of phosphoric acid and a good supply of\r\nammonia,--hereby covering the two leading deficiencies in a majority of\r\nsoils, it may be well to explain the composition of the _improved\r\nsuper-phosphate of lime_ invented by Prof. Mapes.\r\n\r\nThis manure consists of the following ingredients in the proportions\r\nnamed:--\r\n\r\n100  lbs.  bone-black (phosphate of lime and carbon).\r\n56    \"    sulphuric acid.\r\n36    \"    guano.\r\n20    \"    sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n[Explain the uses of these different constituents.\r\n\r\nWhat is nitrogenized phosphate?]\r\n\r\nThe sulphuric acid has the before-mentioned effect on the bone-black,\r\nand _fixes_ the ammonia of the guano by changing it to a sulphate. The\r\ntwenty pounds of sulphate of ammonia added increase the amount, so as to\r\nfurnish nitrogen to plants in sufficient quantities to give them energy,\r\nand induce them to take up the super-phosphate of lime in the manure\r\nmore readily than would be done, were there not a sufficient supply of\r\nammonia in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the guano, which contains all of the elements of\r\nfertility, and many of them in considerable quantities, renders the\r\nmanure of a more general character, and enables it to produce very large\r\ncrops of almost any kind, while it assists in fortifying the soil in\r\nwhat is usually its weakest point--phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nProf. Mapes has more recently invented a new fertilizer called\r\nnitrogenized super-phosphate of lime, composed of the improved\r\nsuper-phosphate of lime and blood, dried and ground before mixture, in\r\nequal proportions. This manure, from its highly nitrogenous character,\r\ntheoretically surpasses all others, and probably will be found in\r\npractice to have great value; its cost will be rather greater than\r\nguano.\r\n\r\nWe understand its manufacture will shortly be commenced by a company now\r\nforming for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[What should be learned before purchasing amendments for the\r\nsoil?\r\n\r\nWhat do you know of silica?]\r\n\r\nMany farmers will find it expedient to purchase bones, or bone dust, and\r\nmanufacture their own super-phosphate of lime; others will prefer to\r\npurchase the prepared manure. In doing so, it should be obtained of men\r\nof known respectability, as manures are easily adulterated with\r\nworthless matters; and, as their price is so high, that such deception\r\nmay occasion great loss.\r\n\r\nWe would not recommend the application of any artificial manure, without\r\nfirst obtaining an analysis of the soil, and knowing _to a certainty_\r\nthat the manure is needed; still, when no analysis has been procured, it\r\nmay be profitable to apply such manures as most generally produce good\r\nresults--such as stable manure, night soil, the improved super-phosphate\r\nof lime; or, if this cannot be procured, guano.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUTRALS.\r\n\r\nSILICA.\r\n\r\n_Silica_ (or sand) always exists in the soil in sufficient quantities\r\nfor the supply of food for plants; but, as has been often stated in the\r\npreceding pages, not always in the proper condition. This subject has\r\nbeen so often explained to the student of this book, that it is only\r\nnecessary to repeat here, that when the weakness of the straw or stalk\r\nof plants grown on any soil indicates an inability in that soil to\r\nsupply the silicates required for strength, not more sand should be\r\nadded, but _alkalies_, to combine with the sand already contained in it,\r\nand make _soluble silicates_ which are available to roots.\r\n\r\nSand is often necessary to stiff clays, as a _mechanical_ manure, to\r\nloosen their texture and render them easier of cultivation, and more\r\nfavorable to the distribution of roots, and to the circulation of air\r\nand water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORINE.\r\n\r\n[How may chlorine be applied?]\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_, a necessary constituent of plants, and often deficient in\r\nthe soil (as indicated by analysis), may be applied in the form of salt\r\n(chloride of sodium), or chloride of lime. The former may be dissolved\r\nin the water used to slake lime, and the latter may, with much\r\nadvantage, be sprinkled around stables and other places where\r\nfertilizing gases are escaping, and, after being saturated with ammonia,\r\napplied to the soil, thus serving a double purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDE OF IRON.\r\n\r\n[How may the protoxide of iron be changed to peroxide?]\r\n\r\nNearly all soils contain sufficient quantities of _oxide of iron_, or\r\niron rust, so that this substance can hardly be required as a manure.\r\n\r\nSome soils, however, contain the _prot_oxide of iron in such quantities\r\nas to be injurious to plants,--see page 86. When this is the case, it is\r\nnecessary to plow the soil thoroughly, and use such other mechanical\r\nmeans as shall render it open to the admission of air. The _prot_oxide\r\nof iron will then take up more oxygen, and become the _per_oxide--which\r\nis not only inoffensive, but is absolutely necessary to fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDE OF MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nThis can hardly be called an essential constituent of plants, and is\r\nnever taken into consideration in manuring lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS OTHER MINERAL MANURES.\r\n\r\nLEACHED ASHES.\r\n\r\n[Why are leached ashes inferior to those that have not been\r\nleached?\r\n\r\nOn what do the benefits of leached ashes depend?\r\n\r\nCan these ingredients be more cheaply obtained in another form?\r\n\r\nWhy do unleached ashes, applied in the spring, sometimes cause grain to\r\nlodge?]\r\n\r\nAmong the mineral manures which have not yet been mentioned--not coming\r\nstrictly under any of the preceding heads, is the one known as _leached\r\nashes_.\r\n\r\nThese are not without their benefits, though worth much less than\r\nunleached ashes, which, besides the constituents of those which have\r\nbeen leached, contain much potash, soda, etc.\r\n\r\nFarmers have generally overrated the value of leached ashes, because\r\nthey contain small quantities of available phosphate of lime, and\r\nsoluble silicates, in which most old soils are deficient. While we\r\nwitness the good results ensuing from their application, we should not\r\nforget that the fertilizing ingredients of _thirty bushels_ of these\r\nashes may be bought in a more convenient form for _ten_ or _fifteen\r\ncents_, or for less than the cost of spreading the ashes on the soil. In\r\nmany parts of Long Island farmers pay as much as eight or ten cents per\r\nbushel for this manure, and thousands of loads of leached ashes are\r\ntaken to this locality from the river counties of New York, and even\r\nfrom the State of Maine, and are sold for many times their value,\r\nproducing an effect which could be as well and much more cheaply\r\nobtained by the use of small quantities of super-phosphate of lime and\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nThese ashes often contain a little charcoal (resulting from the\r\nimperfect combustion of the wood), which acts as an absorbent of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes observed that _unleached_ ashes, when applied in the\r\nspring, cause grain to lodge. When this is the case, as it seldom is, it\r\nmay be inferred that the potash which they contain causes so rapid a\r\ngrowth, that the soil is not able to supply silicates as fast as they\r\nare required by the plants, but after the first year, the potash will\r\nhave united with the silica in the soil, and overcome the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MORTAR.\r\n\r\n[What are the most fertilizing ingredients of old mortar?]\r\n\r\n_Old mortar_ is a valuable manure, because it contains nitrate of potash\r\nand other compounds of nitric acid with alkalies.\r\n\r\nThese are slowly formed in the mortar by the changing of the nitrogen of\r\nthe hair (in the mortar) into nitric acid, and the union of this with\r\nthe small quantities of _potash_, or with the _lime_ of the plaster.\r\nNitrogen, presented in other forms, as ammonia, for instance, may be\r\ntransformed into nitric acid, by uniting with the oxygen of the air, and\r\nthis nitric acid combines immediately with the alkalies of the\r\nmortar.[AI]\r\n\r\nThe lime contained in the mortar may be useful in the soil for the many\r\npurposes accomplished by other lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS HOUSE LIME.\r\n\r\n[How may gas-house lime be prepared for use?\r\n\r\nWhy should it not be used fresh, from the gas house?\r\n\r\nOn what do its fertilizing properties depend?\r\n\r\nWhat use may be made of its offensive odor?]\r\n\r\n_The refuse lime of gas works_, where it can be cheaply obtained, may be\r\nadvantageously used as a manure. It consists, chiefly, of various\r\ncompounds of sulphur and lime. It should be composted with earth or\r\nrefuse matter, so as to expose it to the action of air. It should never\r\nbe used fresh from the gas house. In a few months the sulphur will have\r\nunited with the oxygen of the air, and become sulphuric acid, which\r\nunites with the lime and makes sulphate of lime (plaster), which form it\r\nmust assume, before it is of much value. Having been used to purify gas\r\nmade from coal, it contains a small quantity of ammonia, which adds to\r\nits value. It is considered a profitable manure in England, at the price\r\nthere paid for it (forty cents a cartload), and, if of good quality, it\r\nmay be worth double that sum, especially for soils deficient in plaster,\r\nor for such crops as are much benefited by plaster. Its price must, of\r\ncourse, be regulated somewhat by the price of lime, which constitutes a\r\nlarge proportion of its fertilizing parts. The offensive odor of this\r\ncompound renders it a good protection against many insects.\r\n\r\nThe refuse _liquor of gas works_ contains enough ammonia to make it a\r\nvaluable manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPERS' LEY AND BLEACHERS' LEY.\r\n\r\n[What use may be made of the refuse ley of soap-makers and\r\nbleachers?\r\n\r\nWhat peculiar qualities does soapers' ley possess?]\r\n\r\nThe refuse ley of soap factories and bleaching establishments contains\r\ngreater or less quantities of soluble silicates and alkalies (especially\r\nsoda and potash), and is a good addition to the tank of the compost\r\nheap, or it may be used directly as a liquid application to the soil.\r\nThe soapers' ley, especially, will be found a good manure for lands on\r\nwhich grain lodges.\r\n\r\nMuch of the benefit of this manure arises from the soluble silicates it\r\ncontains, while its nitrogenous matter,[AJ] obtained from those parts of\r\nthe fatty matters which cannot be converted into soap, and consequently\r\nremains in this solution, forms a valuable addition. Heaps of soil\r\nsaturated with this liquid in autumn, and subjected to the freezings of\r\nwinter, form an admirable manure for spring use. Mr. Crane, near Newark\r\n(N. J.), has long used a mixture of spent ley and stable manure, applied\r\nin the fall to trenches plowed in the soil, and has been most successful\r\nin obtaining large crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n[On what does the benefit arising from irrigation chiefly\r\ndepend?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of water is best for irrigation?\r\n\r\nHow do under-drains increase the benefits of irrigation?]\r\n\r\n_Irrigation_ does not come strictly under the head of inorganic manures,\r\nas it often supplies ammonia to the soil. Its chief value, however, in\r\nmost cases, must depend on the amount of mineral matter which it\r\nfurnishes.\r\n\r\nThe word \"irrigation\" means simply _watering_. In many districts water\r\nis in various ways made to overflow the land, and is removed when\r\nnecessary for the purposes of cultivation. All river and spring water\r\ncontains some impurities, many of which are beneficial to vegetation.\r\nThese are derived from the earth over, or through which, the water has\r\npassed, and ammonia absorbed from the atmosphere. When water is made to\r\ncover the earth, especially if its rapid motion be arrested, much of\r\nthis fertilizing matter settles, and is deposited on the soil. The water\r\nwhich sinks into the soil carries its impurities to be retained for the\r\nuses of plants. When, by the aid of under-drains, or in open soils, the\r\nwater passes _through_ the soil, its impurities are arrested, and become\r\navailable in vegetable growth. It is, of course, impossible to say\r\nexactly what kind of mineral matter is supplied by water, as that\r\ndepends on the kind of rock or soil from which the impurities are\r\nderived; but, whatever it may be, it is generally soluble and ready for\r\nimmediate use by plants.\r\n\r\n[What is the difference between water which only runs over the\r\nsurface of the earth, and that which runs out of the earth?\r\n\r\nWhy should strong currents of water not be allowed to traverse the\r\nsoil?]\r\n\r\nWater which has run over the surface of the earth contains both ammonia\r\nand mineral matter, while that which has arisen out of the earth,\r\ncontains usually only mineral matter. The direct use of the water of\r\nirrigation as a solvent for the mineral ingredients of the soil, is one\r\nof its main benefits.\r\n\r\nTo describe the many modes of irrigation would be too long a task for\r\nour limited space. It may be applied in any way in which it is possible\r\nto cover the land with water, at stated times. Care is necessary,\r\nhowever, that it do not wash more fertilizing matter from the soil than\r\nit deposits on it, as would often be the case, if a strong current of\r\nwater were run over it. Brooks may be dammed up, and thus made to cover\r\na large quantity of land. In such a case the rapid current would be\r\ndestroyed, and the fertilizing matter would settle; but, if the course\r\nof the brook were turned, so that it would run in a current over any\r\npart of the soil, it might carry away more than it deposited, and thus\r\nprove injurious. Small streams turned on to land, from the washing of\r\nroads, or from elevated springs, are good means of irrigation, and\r\nproduce increased fertility, except where the soil is of such a\r\ncharacter as to prevent the water from passing away, in which case it\r\nshould be under-drained.\r\n\r\nIrrigation was one of the oldest means of fertility ever used by man,\r\nand still continues in great favor wherever its effects have been\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING SOILS.\r\n\r\n[How are soils improved by mixing?]\r\n\r\nThe _mixing of soils_ is often all that is necessary to render them\r\nfertile, and to improve their _mechanical_ condition. For instance,\r\nsoils deficient in potash, or any other constituent, may have that\r\ndeficiency supplied, by mixing with them soil containing this\r\nconstituent in excess.\r\n\r\nIt is very frequently the case, that such means of improvement are\r\neasily availed of. While these chemical effects are being produced,\r\nthere may be an equal improvement in the mechanical character of the\r\nsoil. Thus stiff clay soils are rendered lighter, and more easily\r\nworkable, by an admixture of sand, while light blowy sands are\r\ncompacted, and made more retentive of manure, by a dressing of clay or\r\nof muck.\r\n\r\n[Why may the same effect sometimes be produced by deep\r\nplowing?\r\n\r\nWhat is absolutely necessary to economical manuring?]\r\n\r\nOf course, this cannot be depended on as a sure means of chemical\r\nimprovement, unless the soils are previously analyzed, so as to know\r\ntheir requirements; but, in a majority of cases, the soil will be\r\nbenefited, by mixing with it soil of a different character. It is not\r\nalways necessary to go to other locations to procure the soil to be\r\napplied, as the subsoil is often very different from the surface soil,\r\nand simple deep plowing will suffice, in such cases, to produce the\r\nrequired admixture, by bringing up the earth from below to mingle it\r\nwith that of a different character at the surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing remarks on the subject of mineral manures, the writer\r\nhas endeavored to point out such a course as would produce the \"greatest\r\ngood to the greatest number,\" and, consequently, has neglected much\r\nwhich might discourage the farmer with the idea, that the whole system\r\nof scientific agriculture is too expensive for his adoption. Still,\r\nwhile he has confined his remarks to the more simple improvements on the\r\npresent system of management, he would say, briefly, that _no manuring\r\ncan be strictly economical that is not based on an analysis of the soil,\r\nand a knowledge of the best means of overcoming the deficiencies\r\nindicated, together with the most scrupulous care of every ounce of\r\nevaporating or soluble manure_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AG] Marl is earth containing lime, but its use is not to be recommended\r\nin this country, except where it can be obtained at little cost, as the\r\nexpenses of carting the _earth_ would often be more than the value of\r\nthe _lime_.\r\n\r\n[AH] The straw producing the grain and the turnip and potato tops\r\ncontain more lime than the grain and roots.\r\n\r\n[AI] See Working Farmer, vol. 2, p. 278.\r\n\r\n[AJ] Glycerine, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Are the gases in the atmosphere manures?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the result if they were not so?]\r\n\r\nIt is not common to look on the gases in the atmosphere in the light of\r\nmanures, but they are decidedly so. Indeed, they are almost the only\r\norganic manure ever received by the uncultivated parts of the earth, as\r\nwell as a large portion of that which is occupied in the production of\r\nfood for man.\r\n\r\nIf these gases were not manures; if there were no means by which they\r\ncould be used by plants, the fertility of the soil would long since have\r\nceased, and the earth would now be in an unfertile condition. That this\r\nmust be true, will be proved by a few moments' reflection on the facts\r\nstated in the first part of this book. The fertilizing gases in the\r\natmosphere being composed of the constituents of decayed plants and\r\nanimals, it is as necessary that they should be again returned to the\r\nform of organized matter, as it is that constituents taken from the\r\n_soil_ should not be put out of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA.\r\n\r\n[How is ammonia used by plants?\r\n\r\nHow may it be carried to the soil?\r\n\r\nHow may the value of organic manures be estimated?\r\n\r\nWhat effects has ammonia beside supplying food to plants?]\r\n\r\nThe _ammonia_ in the atmosphere probably cannot be appropriated by the\r\nleaves of plants, and must, therefore, enter the soil to be assimilated\r\nby roots. It reaches the soil in two ways. It is either arrested from\r\nthe air circulating through the soil, or it is absorbed by rains in the\r\natmosphere, and thus carried to the earth, where it is retained by clay\r\nand carbon, for the uses of plants. In the soil, ammonia is the most\r\nimportant of all organic manures. In fact, the value of organic manure\r\nmay be estimated, either by the amount of ammonia which it will yield,\r\nor by its power of absorbing ammonia from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe most important action of ammonia in the soil is the supply of\r\n_nitrogen_ to plants; but it has other offices which are of consequence.\r\nIt assists in some of the chemical changes necessary to prepare the\r\nmatters in the soil for assimilation. Some argue that ammonia\r\n_stimulates_ the roots of plants, and causes them to take up increased\r\nquantities of inorganic matter. The discussion of this question would be\r\nout of place here, and we will simply say, that it gives them such vigor\r\nthat they require increased amounts of ashy matter, and enables them to\r\ntake this from the soil.\r\n\r\n[To how great a degree can the farmer control atmospheric\r\nfertilizers?\r\n\r\nWhat should be the condition of the soil?\r\n\r\nWhat substances are good absorbents in the soil?\r\n\r\nHow may sandy soils be made retentive of ammonia?]\r\n\r\nAlthough, in the course of nature, the atmospheric fertilizers are\r\nplentifully supplied to the soil, without the immediate attention of the\r\nfarmer, it is not beyond his power to manage them in such a manner as\r\nto arrest a greater quantity. The precautions necessary have been\r\nrepeatedly given in the preceding pages, but it may be well to name them\r\nagain in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the soil is the main point to be considered. It must be\r\nsuch as to absorb and retain ammonia--to allow water to pass _through_\r\nit, and be discharged _below_ the point to which the roots of crops are\r\nsearching for food--and to admit of a free circulation of air.\r\n\r\nThe power of absorbing and retaining ammonia is not possessed by sand,\r\nbut it is a prominent property of clay, charcoal, and some other matters\r\nnamed as absorbents. Hence, if the soil consists of nearly pure sand, it\r\nwill not make use of the ammonia brought to it from the atmosphere, but\r\nwill allow it to evaporate immediately after a shower. Soils in this\r\ncondition require additions of absorbent matters, to enable them to use\r\nthe ammonia received from the atmosphere. Soils already containing a\r\nsufficient amount of clay or charcoal, are thus far prepared to receive\r\nbenefit from this source.\r\n\r\n[Why does under-draining increase the absorptive power of the\r\nsoil?\r\n\r\nHow do plants obtain their carbonic acid?\r\n\r\nHow does carbonic acid affect caustic lime in the soil?]\r\n\r\nThe next point is to cause the water of rains to pass _through_ the\r\nsoil. If it lies on the surface, or runs off without entering the soil,\r\nor even if it only enters to a slight depth, and comes in contact with\r\nbut a small quantity of the absorbents, it is not probable that the\r\nfertilizing matters which it contains will all be abstracted. Some of\r\nthem will undoubtedly return to the atmosphere on the evaporation of the\r\nwater; but, if the soil contains a sufficient supply of absorbents, and\r\nwill allow all rain water to pass through it, the fertilizing gases will\r\nall be retained. They will be filtered (or raked) out of the water.\r\n\r\nThis subject will be more fully treated in Section IV. in connection\r\nwith under-draining.\r\n\r\nBesides the properties just described, the soil must possess the power\r\nof admitting a free circulation of air. To effect this, it is necessary\r\nthat the soil should be well pulverized to a great depth. If, in\r\naddition to this, the soil be such as to admit water to pass through, it\r\nwill allow that circulation of air necessary to the greatest supply of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIC ACID.\r\n\r\n[What power does it give to water?\r\n\r\nWhat condition of the soil is necessary for the reception of the largest\r\nquantity of carbonic acid?\r\n\r\nMay oxygen be considered a manure?\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of the oxidation of the constituents of the soil?]\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is received from the atmosphere, both by the leaves and\r\nroots of plants.\r\n\r\nIf there is caustic lime in the soil, it unites with it, and makes it\r\nmilder and finer. It is absorbed by the water in the soil, and gives it\r\nthe power of dissolving many more substances than it would do without\r\nthe carbonic acid. This use is one of very great importance, as it is\r\nequivalent to making the minerals themselves more soluble. Water\r\ndissolves carbonate of lime, etc., exactly in proportion to the amount\r\nof carbonic acid which it contains. We should, therefore, strive to have\r\nas much carbonic acid as possible in the water in the soil; and one way,\r\nin which to effect this, is to admit to the soil the largest possible\r\nquantity of atmospheric air which contains this gas.\r\n\r\nThe condition of soil necessary for this, is the same as is required for\r\nthe deposit of ammonia by the same circulation of air.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYGEN.\r\n\r\n[How does it affect the protoxide of iron?\r\n\r\nHow does it neutralize the acids in the soil?\r\n\r\nHow does it affect its organic parts?\r\n\r\nHow does it form nitric acid?\r\n\r\nHow may it affect excrementitious matter of plants?\r\n\r\nWhat effect has it on the mechanical condition of the soil?]\r\n\r\n_Oxygen_, though not taken up by plants in its pure form, may justly be\r\nclassed among manures, if we consider its effects both chemical and\r\nmechanical in the soil.\r\n\r\n1. By oxidizing or _rusting_ some of the constituents of the soil, it\r\nprepares them for the uses of plants.\r\n\r\n2. It unites with the _prot_oxide of iron, and changes it to the\r\n_per_oxide.\r\n\r\n3. If there are _acids_ in the soil, which make it sour and unfertile,\r\nit may be opened to the circulation of the air, and the oxygen will\r\nprepare some of the mineral matters contained in the soil to unite with\r\nthe acids and neutralize them.\r\n\r\n4. Oxygen combines with the carbon of organic matters in the soil, and\r\ncauses them to decay. The combination produces carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n5. It combines with the nitrogen of decaying substances and forms\r\n_nitric acid_, which is serviceable as food for plants.\r\n\r\n6. It undoubtedly affects in some way the matter which is thrown out\r\nfrom the roots of plants. This, if allowed to accumulate, and remain\r\nunchanged, is often very injurious to plants; but, probably, the oxygen\r\nand carbonic acid of the air in the soil change it to a form to be\r\ninoffensive, or even make it again useful to the plant.\r\n\r\n7. It may also improve the _mechanical_ condition of the soil, as it\r\ncauses its particles to crumble, thus making it finer; and it roughens\r\nthe surfaces of particles, making them less easy to move among each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThese properties of oxygen claim for it a high place among the\r\natmospheric fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\n[Why may water be considered an atmospheric manure?\r\n\r\nWhat classes of action have manures?\r\n\r\nWhat are chemical manures? Mechanical?]\r\n\r\n_Water_ may be considered an atmospheric manure, as its chief supply to\r\nvegetation is received from the air in the form of rain or dew. Its many\r\neffects are already too well known to need farther comment.\r\n\r\nThe means of supplying water to the soil by the deposit of _dew_ will be\r\nfully explained in Section IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nManures have two distinct classes of action in the soil, namely,\r\n_chemical_ and _mechanical_.\r\n\r\n_Chemical_ manures are those which enter into the construction of\r\nplants, or produce such chemical effects on matters in the soil as shall\r\nprepare them for use.\r\n\r\n_Mechanical_ manures are those which improve the mechanical condition\r\nof the soil, such as loosening stiff clays, compacting light sands,\r\npulverizing large particles, etc.\r\n\r\n[What are the three kinds of manures?\r\n\r\nWhat are organic manures, and what are their uses? Mineral?\r\nAtmospheric?]\r\n\r\nManures are of three distinct kinds, namely, _Organic_, _mineral_, and\r\n_atmospheric_.\r\n\r\n_Organic_ manures comprise all vegetable and animal matters (except\r\nashes) which are used to fertilize the soil. Vegetable manures supply\r\ncarbonic acid, and inorganic matter to plants. Animal manures supply the\r\nsame substances and ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Mineral_ manures comprise ashes, salt, phosphate of lime, plaster, etc.\r\nThey supply plants with inorganic matter. Their usefulness depends on\r\ntheir solubility.\r\n\r\nMany of the organic and mineral manures have the power of absorbing\r\nammonia arising from the decomposition of animal manures, as well as\r\nthat which is brought to the soil by rains--these are called absorbents.\r\n\r\n_Atmospheric_ manures consist of ammonia, carbonic acid, oxygen and\r\nwater. Their greatest usefulness requires the soil to allow the water of\r\nrains to pass _through_ it, to admit of a free circulation of air among\r\nits particles, and to contain a sufficient amount of absorbent matter to\r\narrest and retain all ammonia and carbonic acid presented to it.\r\n\r\n[What rule should regulate the application of manures?\r\n\r\nHow must organic manures be managed? Atmospheric?]\r\n\r\nManures should never be applied to the soil without regard to its\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nAmmonia and carbon are almost always useful, but mineral manures become\r\nmere _dirt_ when applied to soils not deficient of them.\r\n\r\nThe only true guide to the exact requirements of the soil is _chemical\r\nanalysis_; and this must always be obtained before farming can be\r\ncarried on with true economy.\r\n\r\nOrganic manures must be protected against the escape of their ammonia\r\nand the leaching out of their soluble parts. One cord of stable manure\r\nproperly preserved, is worth ten cords which have lost all of their\r\nammonia by evaporation, and their soluble parts by leaching--as is the\r\ncase with much of the manure kept exposed in open barn-yards.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric manures cost nothing, and are of great value when properly\r\nemployed. In consequence of this, the soil which is enabled to make the\r\nlargest appropriation of the atmospheric fertilizers, is worth many\r\ntimes as much as that which allows them to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FOURTH.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICAL CHARACTER OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is the first office of the soil?\r\n\r\nHow does it hold water for the uses of the plant?\r\n\r\nHow does it obtain a part of its moisture?]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical character of the soil is well understood from preceding\r\nremarks, and the learner knows that there are many offices to be\r\nperformed by the soil aside from the feeding of plants.\r\n\r\n1. It admits the roots of plants, and holds them in their position.\r\n\r\n2. By a sponge-like action, it holds water for the uses of the plant.\r\n\r\n3. It absorbs moisture from the atmosphere to supply the demands of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[How may it obtain heat?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the air circulating among its particles?\r\n\r\nCould most soils be brought to the highest state of fertility?\r\n\r\nWhat is the first thing to be done?\r\n\r\nShould its color be darkened?]\r\n\r\n4. It absorbs heat from the sun's rays to assist in the process of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n5. It admits air to circulate among roots, and supply them with a part\r\nof their food, while the oxygen of that air renders available the\r\nminerals of the soil; and its carbonic acid, being absorbed by the water\r\nin the soil, gives it the power of dissolving, and carrying into roots\r\nmore inorganic matter than would be contained in purer water.\r\n\r\n6. It allows the excrementitious matter thrown out by roots to be\r\ncarried out of their reach.\r\n\r\nAll of these actions the soil must be capable of performing, before it\r\ncan be in its highest state of fertility. There are comparatively few\r\nsoils now in this condition, but there are also few which could not be\r\nprofitably rendered so, by a judicious application of the modes of\r\ncultivation to be described in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nThe three great objects to be accomplished are:--\r\n\r\n1. To adopt such a system of drainage as will cause all of the water of\r\nrains to pass _through_ the soil, instead of evaporating from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n2. To pulverize the soil to a considerable depth.\r\n\r\n3. To darken its color, and render it capable of absorbing atmospheric\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n[Name some of the means used to secure these effects.\r\n\r\nWhy are under-drains superior to open drains?]\r\n\r\nThe means used to secure these effects are _under-draining, sub-soil and\r\nsurface-plowing, digging, applying muck, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNDER-DRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages of _under_-drains over _open_ drains are very great.\r\n\r\nWhen open drains are used, much water passes into them immediately from\r\nthe surface, and carries with it fertilizing parts of the soil, while\r\ntheir beds are often compacted by the running water and the heat of the\r\nsun, so that they become water-tight, and do not admit water from the\r\nlower parts of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe sides of these drains are often covered with weeds, which spread\r\ntheir seeds throughout the whole field. Open drains are not only a great\r\nobstruction to the proper cultivation of the land, but they cause much\r\nwaste of room, as we can rarely plow nearer than within six or eight\r\nfeet of them.\r\n\r\nThere are none of these objections to the use of under-drains, as these\r\nare completely covered, and do not at all interfere with the\r\ncultivation of the surface.\r\n\r\n[With what materials may under-drains be constructed?\r\n\r\nDescribe the tile.]\r\n\r\nUnder drains may be made with brush, stones, or tiles. Brush is a very\r\npoor material, and its use is hardly to be recommended. Small stones are\r\nbetter, and if these be placed in the bottoms of the trenches, to a\r\ndepth of eight or ten inches, and covered with sods turned upside down,\r\nhaving the earth packed well down on to them, they make very good\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILE DRAINING.\r\n\r\nThe best under-drains are those made with tiles, or burnt clay pipes.\r\nThe first form of these used was that called the _horse-shoe tile_,\r\nwhich was in two distinct pieces; this was superseded by a round pipe,\r\nand we have now what is called the _sole tile_, which is much better\r\nthan either of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4--Sole Tile.]\r\n\r\n[Why is the sole tile superior to those of previous\r\nconstruction?\r\n\r\nHow are these tiles laid?\r\n\r\nHow may the trenches be dug?]\r\n\r\nThis tile is made (like the horse-shoe and pipe tile) of common brick\r\nclay, and is burned the same as bricks. It is about one half or three\r\nquarters of an inch thick, and is so porous that water passes directly\r\nthrough it. It has a flat bottom on which to stand, and this enables it\r\nto retain its position, while making the drain, better than would be\r\ndone by the round pipe. The orifice through which the water passes is\r\negg-shaped, having its smallest curve at the bottom. This shape is the\r\none most easily kept clear, as any particles of dirt which get into the\r\ndrain must fall immediately to the point where even the smallest stream\r\nof water runs, and are thus removed. An orifice of about two inches is\r\nsufficient for the smaller drains, while the main drains require larger\r\ntiles.\r\n\r\nThese tiles are laid, so that their ends will touch each other, on the\r\nbottoms of the trenches, and are kept in position by having the earth\r\ntightly packed around them. Care must be taken that no space is left\r\nbetween the ends of the tiles, as dirt would be liable to get in and\r\nchoke the drain. It is advisable to place a sod--grass side down--over\r\neach joint, before filling the trench, as this more effectually protects\r\nthem against the entrance of dirt. There is no danger of keeping the\r\nwater out by this operation, as it will readily pass through any part of\r\nthe tiles.\r\n\r\nIn _digging the trenches_ it is not necessary (except in very stony\r\nground) to dig out a place wide enough for a man to stand in, as there\r\nare tools made expressly for the purpose, by which a trench may be dug\r\nsix or seven inches wide, and to any required depth. One set of these\r\nimplements consists of a long narrow spade and a hoe to correspond, such\r\nas are represented in the accompanying figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nUpton tool.\r\n\r\nSpade and hoe.]\r\n\r\nWith these tools, and a long light crowbar, for hard soils, trenches may\r\nbe dug much more cheaply than with the common spade and pickaxe. Where\r\nthere are large boulders in the soil, these draining tools may dig under\r\nthem so that they will not have to be removed.\r\n\r\nWhen the trenches are dug to a sufficient depth, the bottoms must be\r\nmade perfectly smooth, with the required descent (from six inches to a\r\nfew feet in one hundred feet). Then the tiles may be laid in, so that\r\ntheir ends will correspond, be packed down, and the trenches filled up.\r\nSuch a drain, if properly constructed, may last for ages. Unlike the\r\nstone drain, it is not liable to be frequented by rats, nor choked up by\r\nthe soil working into it.\r\n\r\nThe position of the tile may be best represented by a figure, also the\r\nmode of constructing stone drains.\r\n\r\n[Why are small stones better than large stones in the\r\nconstruction of drains?\r\n\r\nOn what must the depth of under-drains depend?]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the tile drain is made with much less labor than\r\nthe stone drain, as it requires less digging, while the breaking up of\r\nthe stone for the stone drain will be nearly, or quite as expensive as\r\nthe tiles. Drains made with large stones are not nearly so good as with\r\nsmall ones, because they are more liable to be choked up by animals\r\nworking in them.[AK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n_a_--Tile drain trench.\r\n_b_--Stone drain trench.\r\n_c_--Sod laid on the stone.]\r\n\r\n[Describe the principle which regulates these relative depths\r\nand distances. (Blackboard.)\r\n\r\nWhich is usually the cheaper plan of constructing drains?]\r\n\r\nThe _depth_ of the drains must depend on the distances at which they are\r\nplaced. If but _twenty_ feet apart, they need be but _three_ feet deep;\r\nwhile, if they are _eighty_ feet apart, they must be _five_ feet deep,\r\nto produce the same effect. The reason for this is, that the water in\r\nthe drained soil is not level, but is higher midway between the drains,\r\nthan at any other point. It is necessary that this highest point should\r\nbe sufficiently far from the surface not to interfere with the roots of\r\nplants, consequently, as the water line between two drains is _curved_,\r\nthe most distant drains must be the deepest. This will be understood by\r\nreferring to the following diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n_aa_--5 feet drains, 80 ft. apart. _bb_--3 feet drains, 20 ft. apart.]\r\n\r\nThe curved line represents the position of the water.\r\n\r\nIn most soils it will be easier to dig one trench five feet deep, than\r\nfour trenches three feet deep, and the deep trenches will be equally\r\nbeneficial; but where the soil is very hard below a depth of three feet,\r\nthe shallow trenches will be the cheapest, and in such soils they will\r\noften be better, as the hard mass might not allow the water to pass down\r\nto enter the deeper drains.\r\n\r\nBy following out these instructions, land may be cheaply, thoroughly,\r\nand permanently drained.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AK] It is probable that a composition of hydraulic cement and some\r\nsoluble material will be invented, by which a continuous pipe may be\r\nlaid in the bottoms of trenches, becoming porous as the soluble material\r\nis removed by water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF UNDER-DRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages of under-draining are many and important.\r\n\r\n1. It entirely prevents drought.\r\n\r\n2. It furnishes an increased supply of atmospheric fertilizers.\r\n\r\n3. It warms the lower portions of the soil.\r\n\r\n4. It hastens the decomposition of roots and other organic matter.\r\n\r\n5. It accelerates the disintegration of the mineral matters in the soil.\r\n\r\n6. It causes a more even distribution of nutritious matters among those\r\nparts of soil traversed by roots.\r\n\r\n7. It improves the mechanical texture of the soil.\r\n\r\n8. It causes the poisonous excrementitious matter of plants to be\r\ncarried out of the reach of their roots.\r\n\r\n9. It prevents grasses from running out.\r\n\r\n10. It enables us to deepen the surface soil.\r\n\r\nBy removing excess of water--\r\n\r\n11. It renders soils earlier in the spring.\r\n\r\n12. It prevents the throwing out of grain in winter.\r\n\r\n13. It allows us to work sooner after rains.\r\n\r\n14. It keeps off the effects of cold weather longer in the fall.\r\n\r\n15. It prevents the formation of _acetic_ and other organic acids, which\r\ninduce the growth of sorrel and similar weeds.\r\n\r\n16. It hastens the decay of vegetable matter, and the finer comminution\r\nof the earthy parts of the soil.\r\n\r\n17. It prevents, in a great measure, the evaporation of water, and the\r\nconsequent abstraction of heat from the soil.\r\n\r\n18. It admits fresh quantities of water from rains, etc., which are\r\nalways more or less imbued with the fertilizing gases of the atmosphere,\r\nto be deposited among the absorbent parts of soil, and given up to the\r\nnecessities of plants.\r\n\r\n19. It prevents the formation of so hard a crust on the surface of the\r\nsoil as is customary on heavy lands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[How does under-draining prevent drought?]\r\n\r\n1. Under-draining _prevents drought_, because it gives a better\r\ncirculation of air in the soil; (it does so by making it more open).\r\nThere is always the same amount of water _in_ and _about_ the surface of\r\nthe earth. In winter, there is more in the soil than in summer, while in\r\nsummer, that which has been dried out of the soil exists in the\r\natmosphere in the form of a _vapor_. It is held in the vapory form by\r\n_heat_, which acts as _braces_ to keep it distended. When vapor comes in\r\ncontact with substances sufficiently colder than itself, it gives up its\r\nheat--thus losing its braces--contracts, and becomes liquid water.\r\n\r\nThis may be observed in hundreds of common operations.\r\n\r\n[Why is there less water in the soil in summer than in winter,\r\nand where does it exist?\r\n\r\nWhat holds it in its vapory form?\r\n\r\nHow is it affected by cold substances?\r\n\r\nDescribe the deposit of moisture on the outside of a pitcher in summer.\r\n\r\nWhat other instances of the same action can be named?]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a cold pitcher in summer robs the vapor in the\r\natmosphere of its heat, and causes it to be deposited on its own\r\nsurface. It looks as though the pitcher were _sweating_, but the water\r\nall comes from the atmosphere, not, of course, through the sides of the\r\npitcher.\r\n\r\nIf we breathe on a knife-blade, it condenses in the same manner the\r\nmoisture of the breath, and becomes covered with a film of water.\r\n\r\nStone houses are damp in summer, because the inner surfaces of the\r\nwalls, being cooler than the atmosphere, cause its moisture to be\r\ndeposited in the manner described. By leaving a space, however, between\r\nthe walls and the plaster, this moisture is prevented from being\r\ntroublesome.\r\n\r\n[How does this principle affect the soil?\r\n\r\nExplain the experiment with the two boxes of soil.]\r\n\r\nNearly every night in the summer season, the cold earth receives\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere in the form of dew.\r\n\r\nA cabbage, which at night is very cold, condenses water to the amount of\r\na gill or more.\r\n\r\nThe same operation takes place in the soil. When the air is allowed to\r\ncirculate among its lower and _cooler_ particles, they receive moisture\r\nfrom the same process of condensation. Therefore, when, by the aid of\r\nunder-drains, the lower soil becomes sufficiently open to admit of a\r\ncirculation of air, the deposit of atmospheric moisture will keep the\r\nsoil supplied with water at a point easily accessible to the roots of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to satisfy ourselves that this is _practically_ correct, we\r\nhave only to prepare two boxes of finely pulverized soil, one, five or\r\nsix inches deep, and the other fifteen or twenty inches deep, and place\r\nthem in the sun at mid-day in summer. The thinner soil will be\r\ncompletely dried, while the deeper one, though it may have been\r\nperfectly dry at first, will soon accumulate a large amount of water on\r\nthose particles which, being lower and more sheltered from the sun's\r\nheat than the particles of the thin soil, are made cooler.\r\n\r\nWith an open condition of subsoil, then, such as may be secured by\r\nunder-draining, we entirely overcome drought.\r\n\r\n[How does under-draining supply to the soil an increased\r\namount of atmospheric fertilizers?\r\n\r\nHow does it warm the lower parts of the soil?]\r\n\r\n2. Under-draining _furnishes an increased supply of atmospheric\r\nfertilizers_, because it secures a change of air in the soil. This\r\nchange is produced whenever the soil becomes filled with water, and then\r\ndried; when the air above the earth is in rapid motion, and when the\r\ncomparative temperature of the upper and lower soils changes. It causes\r\nnew quantities of the ammonia and carbonic acid which it contains to be\r\npresented to the absorbent parts of the soil.\r\n\r\n3. Under-draining _warms the lower parts of the soil_, because the\r\ndeposit of moisture (1) is necessarily accompanied by an abstraction of\r\nheat from the atmospheric vapor, and because heat is withdrawn from the\r\nwhole amount of air circulating through the cooler soil.\r\n\r\nWhen rain falls on the parched surface soil, it robs it of a portion of\r\nits heat, which is carried down to equalize the temperature for the\r\nwhole depth. The heat of the rain-water itself is given up to the soil,\r\nleaving the water from one to ten degrees cooler, when it passes out of\r\nthe drains, than when received by the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is always a current of air passing from the lower to the upper end\r\nof a well constructed drain; and this air is always cooler in warm\r\nweather, when it issues from, than when it enters the drain. Its lost\r\nheat is imparted to the soil.\r\n\r\n[How does it hasten the decomposition of roots and other\r\norganic matter in the soil?\r\n\r\nHow does it accelerate the disintegration of its mineral parts?\r\n\r\nWhy is this disintegration necessary to fertility?]\r\n\r\nThis heating of the lower soil renders it more favorable to vegetation,\r\npartially by expanding the spongioles at the end of the roots, thus\r\nenabling them to absorb larger quantities of nutritious matters.\r\n\r\n4. Under-draining _hastens the decomposition of roots and other organic\r\nmatters in the soil_, by admitting increased quantities of air, thus\r\nsupplying _oxygen_, which is as essential in decay as it is in\r\ncombustion. It also allows the resultant gases of decomposition to pass\r\naway, leaving the air around the decaying substances in a condition to\r\ncontinue the process.\r\n\r\nThis organic decay, besides its other benefits, produces an amount of\r\nheat perfectly perceptible to the smaller roots of plants, though not so\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n5. Draining _accelerates the disintegration of the mineral matters in\r\nthe soil_, by admitting water and oxygen to keep up the process. This\r\ndisintegration is necessary to fertility, because the roots of plants\r\ncan feed only on matters dissolved from _surfaces_; and the more finely\r\nwe pulverize the soil, the more surface we expose. For instance, the\r\ninterior of a stone can furnish no food for plants; while, if it were\r\nfinely crushed, it might make a fertile soil.\r\n\r\nAny thing, tending to open the soil to exposure, facilitates the\r\ndisintegration of its particles, and thereby increases its fertility.\r\n\r\n[How does under-draining equalize the distribution of the\r\nfertilizing parts of the soil?\r\n\r\nWhy does this distribution lessen the impoverishment of the soil?\r\n\r\nHow does under-draining improve the mechanical texture of the soil?\r\n\r\nHow do drains affect the excrementitious matter of plants?]\r\n\r\n6. Draining _causes a more even distribution of nutritious matters among\r\nthose parts of soil traversed by roots_, because it increases the ease\r\nwith which water travels around, descending by its own weight, moving\r\nsideways by a desire to find its level, or carried upward by attraction\r\nto supply the evaporation at the surface. By this continued motion of\r\nthe water, soluble matter of one part of the soil may be carried to some\r\nother part; and another constituent from this latter position may be\r\ncarried back to the former. Thus the food of vegetables is continually\r\ncirculating around among their roots, ready for absorption at any point\r\nwhere it is needed, while the more open character of the soil enables\r\nroots to occupy larger portions, making a more even drain on the whole,\r\nand preventing the undue impoverishment of any part.\r\n\r\n7. Under-drains _improve the mechanical texture of the soil_; because,\r\nby the decomposition of its parts, as previously described (4 and 5), it\r\nis rendered of a character to be more easily worked; while smooth round\r\nparticles, which have a tendency to pack, are roughened by the oxidation\r\nof their surfaces, and move less easily among each other.\r\n\r\n8. Drains _cause the excrementitious matter of plants to be carried out\r\nof the reach of their roots_. Nearly all plants return to the soil those\r\nparts of their food, which are not adapted to their necessities, and\r\nusually in a form that is poisonous to plants of the same kind. In an\r\nopen soil, this matter may be carried by rains to a point where roots\r\ncannot reach it, and where it may undergo such changes as will fit it to\r\nbe again taken up.\r\n\r\n[Why do they prevent grasses from running out?]\r\n\r\n9. By under-draining, _grasses are prevented from running out_, partly\r\nby preventing the accumulation of the poisonous excrementitious matter,\r\nand partly because these grasses usually consist of _tillering_ plants.\r\n\r\nThese plants continually reproduce themselves in sprouts from the upper\r\nparts of their roots. These sprouts become independent plants, and\r\ncontinue to tiller (thus keeping the land supplied with a full growth),\r\nuntil the roots of the _stools_ (or clumps of tillers), come in contact\r\nwith an uncongenial part of the soil, when the tillering ceases; the\r\nstools become extinct on the death of their plants, and the grasses run\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe open and healthy condition of soil produced by draining prevents the\r\ntillering from being stopped, and thus keeps up a full growth of grass\r\nuntil the nutriment of the soil is exhausted.\r\n\r\n10. Draining _enables us to deepen the surface-soil_, because the\r\nadmission of air and the decay of roots render the condition of the\r\nsubsoil such that it may be brought up and mixed with the surface-soil,\r\nwithout injuring _its quality_.\r\n\r\nThe second class of advantages of under-draining, arising in the removal\r\nof the excess of water in the soil, are quite as important as those just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[How does the removal of water render soils earlier in spring?\r\n\r\nWhy does it prevent the throwing out of grain in winter?\r\n\r\nWhy does it enable us to work sooner after rains?\r\n\r\nWhy does it keep off the effects of cold weather longer in the fall?]\r\n\r\n11. _Soils are, thereby, rendered earlier in spring_, because the water,\r\nwhich rendered them cold, heavy, and untillable, is earlier removed,\r\nleaving them earlier in a growing condition.\r\n\r\n12. _The throwing out of grain in winter_ is prevented, because the\r\nwater falling on the earth is immediately removed instead of remaining\r\nto throw up the soil by freezing, as it always does from the upright\r\nposition taken by the particles of ice.\r\n\r\n13. _We are enabled to work sooner after rains_, because the water\r\ndescends, and is immediately removed instead of lying to be taken off by\r\nthe slow process of evaporation, and sinking through a heavy soil.\r\n\r\n14. _The effects of cold weather are kept off longer in the fall_,\r\nbecause the excess of water is removed, which would produce an unfertile\r\ncondition on the first appearance of cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe drains also, from causes already named (3), keep the soil warmer\r\nthan before being drained, thus actually lengthening the season, by\r\nmaking the soil warm enough for vegetable growth earlier in spring, and\r\nlater in autumn.\r\n\r\n[How does it prevent lands from becoming sour?\r\n\r\nWhy does it hasten the decay of roots, and the comminution of mineral\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\nHow does it prevent the abstraction of heat from the soil?]\r\n\r\n15. _Lands are prevented from becoming sour by the formation of acetic\r\nacid_, etc., because these acids are produced in the soil only when the\r\ndecomposition of organic matter is arrested by the _antiseptic_\r\n(preserving) powers of water. If the water is removed, the decomposition\r\nof the organic matter assumes a healthy form, while the acids already\r\nproduced are neutralized by atmospheric influences, and the soil is\r\nrestored from sorrel to a condition in which it is fitted for the growth\r\nof more valuable plants.\r\n\r\n16. _The decay of roots_, etc., is allowed to proceed, because the\r\npreservative influence of too much water is removed. Wood, leaves, or\r\nother vegetable matter kept continually under water, will last for ages;\r\nwhile, if exposed to the action of the weather, as in under-drained\r\nsoils, they soon decay.\r\n\r\nThe presence of too much water, by excluding the oxygen of the air,\r\nprevents the _comminution of matters_ necessary to fertility.\r\n\r\n[How much heat does water take up in becoming vapor?\r\n\r\nWhy does water sprinkled on a floor render it cooler?\r\n\r\nWhy is not a cubic inch of vapor warmer than a cubic inch of water?\r\n\r\nWhy does a wet cloth on the head make it cooler when fanned?\r\n\r\nHow does this principle apply to the soil?]\r\n\r\n17. _The evaporation of water, and the consequent abstraction of heat\r\nfrom the soil, is in a great measure prevented_ by draining the water\r\nout at the _bottom_ of the soil, instead of leaving it to be dried off\r\nfrom the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen water assumes the gaseous (or vapory) form, it takes up 1723 times\r\nas much _heat_ as it contained while a liquid. A large part of this heat\r\nis derived from surrounding substances. When water is sprinkled on the\r\nfloor, it cools the room; because, as it becomes a vapor, it takes heat\r\nfrom the room. The reason why vapor does not feel hotter than liquid\r\nwater is, that, while it contains 1723 times as much heat, it is 1723 as\r\nlarge. Hence, a cubic inch of vapor, into which we place the bulb of a\r\nthermometer, contains no more heat than a cubic inch of water. The\r\nprinciple is the same in some other cases. A sponge containing a\r\ntable-spoonful of water is just as _wet_ as one twice as large and\r\ncontaining two spoonsful.\r\n\r\nIf a wet cloth be placed on the head, and the evaporation of its water\r\nassisted by fanning, the head becomes cooler--a portion of its heat\r\nbeing taken to sustain the vapory condition of the water.\r\n\r\nThe same principle holds true with the soil. When the evaporation of\r\nwater is rapidly going on, by the assistance of the sun, wind, etc., a\r\nlarge quantity of heat is abstracted, and the soil becomes cold.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no evaporation taking place, except of water which has\r\nbeen deposited on the lower portions of soil, and carried to the surface\r\nby capillary attraction (as is nearly true on under-drained soils), the\r\nloss of heat is compensated by that taken from the moisture in the\r\natmosphere by the soil, in the above-named manner.\r\n\r\nThis cooling of the soil by the evaporation of water, is of very great\r\ninjury to its powers of producing crops, and the fact that under-drains\r\navoid it, is one of the best arguments in favor of their use. Some idea\r\nmay, perhaps, be formed of the amount of heat taken from the soil in\r\nthis way, from the fact that, in midsummer, 25 hogsheads of water may be\r\nevaporated from a single acre in twelve hours.\r\n\r\n[When rains are allowed to _enter_ the soil, how do they\r\nbenefit it?\r\n\r\nHow do under-drains prevent the formation of a crust on the surface of a\r\nsoil?]\r\n\r\n18. When not saturated with water the soil admits the water of rains,\r\netc., which bring with them _fertilizing gases from the atmosphere_, to\r\nbe deposited among the absorbent parts of soil, and given up to the\r\nnecessities of the plant. When this rain falls on lands already\r\nsaturated, it cannot enter the soil, but must run off from the surface,\r\nor be removed by evaporation, either of which is injurious. The first,\r\nbecause fertilizing matter is washed away. The second, because the soil\r\nis deprived of necessary heat.\r\n\r\n19. _The formation of crust on the surface of the soil_ is due to the\r\nevaporation of water, which is drawn up from below by capillary\r\nattraction. It arises from the fact that the water in the soil is\r\nsaturated with mineral substances, which it leaves at its point of\r\nevaporation at the surface. This soluble matter from below, often forms\r\na very hard crust, which is a complete shield to prevent the admission\r\nof air with its ameliorating effects, and should, as far as possible, be\r\navoided. Under-draining is the best means of doing this, as it is the\r\nbest means of lessening the evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are some of the more important reasons why under-draining\r\nis always beneficial. Thorough experiments have amply proved the truth\r\nof the theory.\r\n\r\n[What kinds of soil are benefited by under-draining?]\r\n\r\nThe _kinds of soil benefited by under-draining_ are nearly as unlimited\r\nas the kinds of soil in existence. It is a common opinion, among\r\nfarmers, that the only soils which require draining are those which are\r\nat times covered with water, such as swamps and other low lands; but the\r\nfacts stated in the early part of this chapter, show us that every kind\r\nof soil--wet, dry, compact, or light--receives benefit from the\r\ntreatment. The fact that land is _too dry_, is as much a reason why it\r\nshould be drained, as that it is _too wet_, as it overcomes drought as\r\neffectually as it removes the injurious effects of too much water.\r\n\r\nAll soils in which the water of heavy rains does not immediately pass\r\ndown to a depth of at least _thirty inches_, should be under-drained,\r\nand the operation, if carried on with judgment, would invariably result\r\nin profit.\r\n\r\n[What do English farmers name as the profits of\r\nunder-draining?\r\n\r\nWhat stand has been taken by the English government with regard to\r\nunder-draining?]\r\n\r\nOf the precise _profits_ of under-draining this is not the place to\r\nspeak: many of the agricultural papers contain numerous accounts of its\r\nsuccess. It may be well to remark here, that many English farmers give\r\nit, as their experience, that under-drains pay for themselves every\r\nthree years, or that they produce a perpetual profit of 33-1/3 per\r\ncent., or their original cost. This is not the opinion of _theorists_\r\nand _book farmers_. It is the conviction of practical men, who know,\r\n_from experience_, that under-drains are beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe best evidence of the utility of under-draining is the position, with\r\nregard to it, which has been taken by the English national government,\r\nwhich affords much protection to the agricultural interests of her\r\npeople--a protection which in this country is unwisely and unjustly\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nIn England a very large sum from the public treasury has been\r\nappropriated as a fund for loans, on under-drains, which is lent to\r\nfarmers for the purpose of under-draining their estates, the only\r\nsecurity given being the increased value of the soil. The time allowed\r\nfor payments is twenty years, and only five per cent. interest is\r\ncharged. By the influence of this patronage, the actual wealth of the\r\nkingdom is being rapidly increased, while the farmers themselves, can\r\nraise their farms to any desired state of fertility, without immediate\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n[How does under-draining affect the healthfulness of marshy\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\nDescribe the sub-soil plow.]\r\n\r\nThe best proof that the government has not acted injudiciously in this\r\nmatter is, that private capitalists are fast employing their money in\r\nthe same manner, and loans on under-drains are considered a very safe\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that we may soon have similar facilities for improving\r\nour farms, and when we do, we shall find that it is unnecessary to move\r\nWest to find good soil. The districts nearer market, where the expense\r\nof transportation is much less, may, by the aid of under-drains, and a\r\njudicious system of cultivation, be made equally fertile.\r\n\r\nOne very important, though not strictly agricultural, effect of thorough\r\ndrainage is its removal of certain local diseases, peculiar to the\r\nvicinity of marshy or low moist soils. The health-reports in several\r\nplaces in England, show that where _fever and ague_ was once common, it\r\nhas almost entirely disappeared since the general use of under-drains in\r\nthose localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSUB-SOIL PLOWING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Describe the Mapes plow.\r\n\r\nWhy is the motion in the soil of one and a half inches sufficient?\r\n\r\nHow does the oxidation of the particles of the soil resemble the rusting\r\nof cannon balls in a pile?]\r\n\r\nThe _sub-soil plow_ is an implement differing in figure from the surface\r\nplow. It does not turn a furrow, but merely runs through the subsoil\r\nlike a mole--loosening and making it finer by lifting, but allowing it\r\nto fall back and occupy its former place. It usually follows the surface\r\nplow, entering the soil to the depth of from twelve to eighteen inches\r\nbelow the bottom of the surface furrow.\r\n\r\nThe best pattern now made (the Mapes plow) is represented in the\r\nfollowing figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nThe Mapes plow and its mode of action. _a_--Shape of the foot of the\r\nplow, _b_--Its effect on the soil.]\r\n\r\nThe sub-soil plows first made raised the whole soil about eight inches,\r\nand required very great power in their use often six, eight, or even ten\r\noxen. The Mapes plow, raising the soil but slightly, may be worked with\r\nmuch less power, and produces equally good results. It may be run to its\r\nfull depth in most soils by a single yoke of oxen.\r\n\r\nOf course a motion in the soil of but one and a half inches is very\r\nslight, but it is sufficient to move each particle from the one next to\r\nit which, in dry soils, is all that is necessary. Whoever has examined a\r\npile of cannon-balls must have observed that at the points where they\r\ntouch each other, there is a little rust. In the soil, the same is often\r\nthe case. Where the particles touch each other, there is such a chemical\r\nchange produced as renders them fit for the use of plants. While these\r\nparticles remain in their first position, the changed portions are out\r\nof the reach of roots; but, if, by the aid of the sub-soil plow, their\r\nposition is altered, these parts are exposed for the uses of plants. If\r\nwe hold in the hand a ball of dry clay, and press it hard enough to\r\nproduce the least motion among its particles, the whole mass becomes\r\npulverized. On the same principle, the sub-soil plow renders the compact\r\nlower soil sufficiently fine for the requirements of fertility.\r\n\r\n[Why are the benefits of sub-soiling not permanent on wet\r\nlands?\r\n\r\nDoes sub-soiling overcome drought?\r\n\r\nHow does it deepen the surface soil?]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its great benefits on land, which is sufficiently dry,\r\nsub-soiling cannot be recommended for wet lands; for, in such case, the\r\nrains of a single season would often be sufficient to entirely overcome\r\nits effects by packing the subsoil down to its former hardness.\r\n\r\nOn lands not overcharged with water, it is productive of the best\r\nresults, it being often sufficient to turn the balance between a gaining\r\nand a losing business in farming.\r\n\r\nIt increases nearly every effect of under-draining; especially does it\r\novercome drought, by loosening the soil, and admitting air to circulate\r\namong the particles of the subsoil and deposit its moisture on the\r\nprinciple described in the chapter on under-draining.\r\n\r\nIt deepens the surface-soil, because it admits roots into the subsoil\r\nwhere they decay and leave carbon, while the circulation of air so\r\naffects the mineral parts, that they become of a fertilizing character.\r\nThe deposit of carbon gives to the subsoil the power of absorbing, and\r\nretaining the atmospheric fertilizers, which are more freely presented,\r\nowing to the fact that the air is allowed to circulate with greater\r\nfreedom. As a majority of roots decay in the surface-soil, they there\r\ndeposit much mineral matter obtained from the subsoil.\r\n\r\n[Why is the retention of atmospheric manures ensured by\r\nsub-soiling?\r\n\r\nWhy are organic manures plowed deeply under the soil, less liable to\r\nevaporation than when deposited near the surface?\r\n\r\nHow does sub-soiling resemble under-draining in relation to the\r\ntillering of grasses?\r\n\r\nWhen the subsoil consists of a thin layer of clay on a sandy bed, what\r\nuse may be made of the sub-soil plow?]\r\n\r\nThe retention of atmospheric manures is more fully ensured by the\r\nbetter exposure of the clayey portions of the soil.\r\n\r\nThose manures which are artificially applied, by being plowed under to\r\ngreater depths, are less liable to evaporation, as, from the greater\r\namount of soil above them, their escape will more probably be arrested;\r\nand, from the greater prevalence of roots, they are more liable to be\r\ntaken up by plants.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil often contains matters which are deficient in the\r\nsurface-soil. By the use of the sub-soil plow, they are rendered\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nSub-soiling is similar to under-draining in continuing the tillering of\r\ngrasses, and in getting rid of the poisonous excrementitious matter of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWhen the subsoil is a thin layer of clay on a sandy bed (as in some\r\nplants of Cumberland Co. Maine), the sub-soil plow, by passing through\r\nit, opens a passage for water, and often affords a sufficient drainage.\r\n\r\n[To how great a depth will the roots of plants usually occupy\r\nthe soil?\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of loosening the soil?\r\n\r\nHow are these various effects better produced in deep than in shallow\r\nsoils?]\r\n\r\nIf plants will grow better on a soil six inches deep than on one of\r\nthree inches, there is no reason why they should not be benefited in\r\nproportion, by disturbing the soil to the whole depth to which roots\r\nwill travel--which is usually more than two feet. The minute rootlets\r\nof corn and most other plants, will, if allowed by cultivation, occupy\r\nthe soil to the depth or thirty-four inches, having a fibre in nearly\r\nevery cubic inch of the soil for the whole distance. There are very few\r\ncultivated plants whose roots would not travel to a depth of thirty\r\ninches or more. Even the onion sends its roots to the depth of eighteen\r\ninches when the soil is well cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe object of loosening the soil is to admit roots to a sufficient depth\r\nto hold the plant in its position--to obtain the nutriment necessary to\r\nits growth--to receive moisture from the lower portions of the\r\nsoil--and, if it be a bulb, tuber, or tap, to assume the form requisite\r\nfor its largest development.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident that roots, penetrating the soil to a depth of two\r\nfeet, anchor the plant with greater stability than those which are\r\nspread more thinly near the surface.\r\n\r\nThe roots of plants traversing the soil to such great distances, and\r\nbeing located in nearly every part, absorb mineral and other food, in\r\nsolution in water, only through the _spongioles at their ends_.\r\nConsequently, by having these ends in _every part_ of the soil, it is\r\n_all_ brought under contribution, and the amount supplied is greater,\r\nwhile the demand on any particular part may be less than when the whole\r\nrequirements of plants have to be supplied from a depth of a few inches.\r\n\r\n[May garden soils be profitably imitated in field culture?]\r\n\r\nThe ability of roots, to assume a natural shape in the soil, and grow to\r\ntheir largest sizes, must depend on the condition of the soil. If it is\r\nfinely pulverized to the whole depth to which they ought to go, they\r\nwill be fully developed; while, if the soil be too hard for penetration,\r\nthey will be deformed or small. Thus a carrot may grow to the length of\r\ntwo and a half feet, and be of perfect shape, while, if it meet in its\r\ncourse at a depth of eight or ten inches a _cold, hard_ subsoil, its\r\ngrowth must be arrested, or its form injured.\r\n\r\nRoots are turned aside by a hard sub-soil, as they would be if received\r\nby the surface of a plate of glass.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the fact that cold, impenetrable subsoils are _chemically_\r\nuncongenial to vegetation, and we have sufficient evidence of the\r\nimportance, and in many cases the absolute necessity of sub-soiling and\r\nunder-draining.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to urge the fact that a garden soil of two feet is\r\nmore productive than a field soil of six inches; and it is certain that\r\nproper attention to these two modes of cultivation will in a majority of\r\ncases make a garden of the field--more than doubling its value in ease\r\nof working, increased produce, certain security against drought, and\r\nmore even distribution of the demands on the soil--while the outlay will\r\nbe immediately repaid by an increase of crops.\r\n\r\n[Is the use of the sub-soil plow increasing?\r\n\r\nWill its use ever injure crops?]\r\n\r\nThe subsoil will be much improved in its character the first year, and a\r\ncontinual advancement renders it in time equal to the original\r\nsurface-soil, and extending to a depth of two feet or more.\r\n\r\nThe sub-soil plow is coming rapidly into use. There are now in New\r\nJersey more foundries casting sub-soil plows than there were sub-soil\r\nplows in the State six years ago. The implement has there, as well as in\r\nmany other places, ceased to be a curiosity; and the man who now objects\r\nto its use, is classed with him who shells his corn on a shovel over a\r\nhalf-bushel, instead of employing an improved machine, which will enable\r\nhim to do more in a day than he can do in the \"good old way\" in a week.\r\n\r\nHad we space, we might give many instances of the success of\r\nsub-soiling, but the agricultural papers of the present day (at least\r\none of which every farmer should take) have so repeatedly published its\r\nadvantages, that we will not do so.\r\n\r\nIn no case will its use be found any thing but satisfactory, except in\r\noccasional instances where there is some chemical difficulty in the\r\nsubsoil, which an analysis will tell us how to overcome.\r\n\r\nAs was before stated, its use on wet lands is not advisable until they\r\nhave been under-drained, as excess of water prevents its effects from\r\nbeing permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPLOWING AND OTHER MODES OF PULVERIZING THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[May the satisfaction attending labor be increased by an\r\nunderstanding of the natural laws which regulate our operations?\r\n\r\nOn what depends the kind of plow to be used?]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of pulverizing the soil, and the _reasons_ why it is\r\nnecessary, are now too well known to need remark. Few farmers, when they\r\nplow, dig, or harrow, are enabled to give substantial reasons for so\r\ndoing. If they will reflect on what has been said in the previous\r\nchapters, concerning the supply of mineral food to the plant by the\r\nsoil, and the effect of air and moisture about roots, they will find\r\nmore satisfaction in their labor than it can afford when applied without\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING.\r\n\r\n[What is a general rule with regard to this?\r\n\r\nShould deep plowing be immediately adopted? Why?\r\n\r\nWhy is this course of treatment advisable for garden culture?]\r\n\r\nThe kind of plow used in cultivating the surface-soil must be decided\r\nby the kind of soil. This question the practical, _observing_ farmer\r\nwill be able to solve.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it may be stated that the plow which runs the\r\n_deepest_, with the same amount of force, is the best.\r\n\r\nWe might enter more fully into this matter but for want of space.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of _deep plowing_ cannot be too strongly urged.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the _deeper_ and the _finer_ the soil is rendered,\r\nthe more productive it will become, is in every respect true, and which\r\nno single instance will contradict.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from this, that we would advise a farmer, who\r\nhas always plowed his soil to the depth of only six inches, to double\r\nthe depth at once. Such a practice in some soils would be highly\r\ninjurious, as it would completely bury the more fertile and better\r\ncultivated soil, and bring to the top one which contains no organic\r\nmatter, and has never been subject to atmospheric influences. This\r\nwould, perhaps, be so little fitted for vegetation that it would\r\nscarcely sustain plants until their roots could reach the more fertile\r\nparts below. Such treatment of the soil (turning it upside down) is\r\nexcellent in _garden_ culture, where the great amount of manures\r\napplied is sufficient to overcome the temporary barrenness of the soil,\r\nbut it is not to be recommended for all _field_ cultivation, where much\r\nless manure is employed.\r\n\r\n[How should field plowing be conducted?\r\n\r\nHow does such treatment affect soils previously limed?\r\n\r\nHow may it sometimes improve sandy or clay soils?]\r\n\r\nThe course to be pursued in such cases is to _plow one inch deeper each\r\nyear_. By this means the soil maybe gradually deepened to any desired\r\nextent. The amount of uncongenial soil which will thus be brought up, is\r\nslight, and will not interfere at all with the fertility of the soil,\r\nwhile the elevated portion will become, in one year, so altered by\r\nexposure, that it will equal the rest of the soil in fertility.\r\n\r\nOften where lime has been used in excess, it has sunk to the subsoil,\r\nwhere it remains inactive. The slight deepening of the surface plowing\r\nwould mix this lime with the surface-soil, and render it again useful.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is light and sandy, resting on a heavy clay subsoil, or\r\nclay on sand, the bringing up of the mass from below will improve the\r\ntexture of the soil.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the success of deep plowing, we call to mind the case\r\nof a farmer in New Jersey, who had a field which had yielded about\r\ntwenty-five bushels of corn per acre. It had been cultivated at ordinary\r\ndepths. After laying it out in eight step lands (24 feet), he plowed it\r\nat all depths from five to ten inches, on the different lands, and\r\nsowed oats evenly over the whole field. The crop on the five inch soil\r\nwas very poor, on the six inch rather better, on the seven inch better\r\nstill, and on the ten inch soil it was as fine as ever grew in New\r\nJersey; it had stiff straw and broad leaves, while the grain was also\r\nmuch better than on the remainder of the field.\r\n\r\n[What kind of soils are benefited by fall plowing?]\r\n\r\nThere is an old anecdote of a man who died, leaving his sons with the\r\ninformation that he had buried a pot of gold for them, somewhere on the\r\nfarm. They commenced digging for the gold, and dug over the whole farm\r\nto a great depth without finding the gold. The digging, however, so\r\nenriched the soil that they were fully compensated for their\r\ndisappointment, and became wealthy from the increased produce of their\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nFarmers will find, on experiment, that they have gold buried in their\r\nsoil, if they will but dig deep enough to obtain it. The law gives a man\r\nthe ownership of the soil for an indefinite distance from the surface,\r\nbut few seem to realize that there is _another farm_ below the one they\r\nare cultivating, which is quite as valuable as the one on the surface,\r\nif it were but properly worked.\r\n\r\n_Fall plowing_, especially for heavy lands, is a very good means of\r\nsecuring the action of the frosts of winter to pulverize the soil. If it\r\nbe a stiff clay, it may be well to throw the soil up into ridges (by\r\nridging and back furrowing), so as to expose the largest possible amount\r\nof surface to the freezing and thawing of winter. Sandy soils should not\r\nbe plowed in the fall, as it renders them too light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGGING MACHINES.\r\n\r\n[What is the digging machine?]\r\n\r\nA recent invention has been made in England, known as the digging\r\nmachine or rotary spade, which--although from having too much gearing\r\nbetween the power and the part performing the labor, it is not adapted\r\nto general use--has given such promise of future success, that Mr. Mechi\r\n(an agricultural writer of the highest standing) has said that \"the plow\r\nis doomed.\" This can hardly be true, for the varied uses to which it may\r\nbe applied, will guarantee its continuance in the favor of the farmer.\r\n\r\nAlready, in this country, Messrs. Gibbs & Mapes, have invented a digging\r\nmachine of very simple construction, which seems calculated to serve an\r\nexcellent purpose, even in the hands of the farmer of limited means.\r\n\r\nIts friends assert that, with one pair of oxen, it will dig perfectly\r\nthree feet wide, and for a depth of fifteen inches. An experiment with\r\nan unperfected machine, in the presence of the writer, seemed to justify\r\ntheir hopes.\r\n\r\nThis machine thoroughly pulverizes the soil to a considerable depth, and\r\nfor smooth land must prove far superior to the plow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARROW AND CULTIVATOR.\r\n\r\n[Why is the harrow a defective implement?\r\n\r\nWhy is the cultivator superior to the harrow?]\r\n\r\nThe _harrow_, an implement largely used in all parts of the world, to\r\npulverize the soil, and break clods, has become so firmly rooted in the\r\naffections of farmers, that it must be a very long time before they can\r\nbe convinced that it is not the best implement for the use to which it\r\nis devoted. It is true that it pulverizes the soil for a depth of two or\r\nthree inches, and thus much improves its appearance, benefiting it,\r\nwithout doubt, for the earliest stages of the growth of plants. Its\r\naction, however, is very defective, because, from the _wedge_ shape of\r\nits teeth, it continually acts to _pack_ the soil; thus--although\r\nfavorable for the germination of the seed--it is not calculated to\r\nbenefit the plant during the later stages of its growth, when the roots\r\nrequire the soil to be pulverized to a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nThe _cultivator_ may be considered an _improved harrow_. The principal\r\ndifference between them being, that while the teeth of the harrow are\r\npointed at the lower end, those of the cultivator are shaped like a\r\nsmall double plow, being large at the bottom and growing smaller\r\ntowards the top. They lift the earth up, instead of pressing it\r\ndownwards, thus loosening instead of compacting the soil.\r\n\r\nMany styles of cultivators are now sold at agricultural warehouses. A\r\nvery good one, for field use, may be made by substituting the cultivator\r\nteeth for the spikes in an old harrow frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nROLLING, MULCHING, WEEDING, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLING.\r\n\r\n[Name some of the benefits of rolling?]\r\n\r\n_Rolling_ the soil with a large roller, arranged to be drawn by a team,\r\nis in many instances a good accessory to cultivation. By its means, the\r\nfollowing results are obtained:--\r\n\r\n1. The soil at the surface is pulverized without the compacting of the\r\nlower parts, the area of contact being large.\r\n\r\n2. The stones on the land are pressed down so as to be out of the way of\r\nthe scythe in mowing.\r\n\r\n3. The soil is compacted around seeds after sowing in such a manner as\r\nto exclude light and to _touch_ them in every part, both of which are\r\nessential to their germination and to the healthfulness of the plants.\r\n\r\n[Under what circumstances should the roller be used?]\r\n\r\n4. The soil is so compacted at the surface, that it is less frequented\r\nby _grubs_, etc., than when it is more loose.\r\n\r\n5. When the soil is smoothed in this manner, there is less surface\r\nexposed for the evaporation of water with its cooling effect.\r\n\r\n6. Light sandy lands, by being rolled in the fall, are rendered more\r\ncompact, and the loosening effects of frequent freezing and thawing are\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nAlthough productive of these various effects, rolling should be adopted\r\nonly with much care, and should never be applied to very heavy lands,\r\nexcept in dry weather when lumpy after plowing, as its tendency in such\r\ncases would be to render them still more difficult of cultivation. Soils\r\nin which air does not circulate freely, are not improved by rolling, as\r\nit presses the surface-particles still more closely together, and\r\nprevents the free admission of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf well _under-drained_, a large majority of soils would doubtless be\r\nbenefited by a judicious use of the roller.[AL]\r\n\r\n\r\nMULCHING.\r\n\r\n[What is mulching?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of its benefits?]\r\n\r\n_Mulching_ (called Gurneyism in England) consists in covering the soil\r\nwith salt hay, litter, seaweed, leaves, spent tanbark, chips, or other\r\nrefuse matter.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer must have noticed that, if a board or rail, or an old\r\nbrush-heap be removed in spring from soil where grass is growing, the\r\ngrass afterwards grows in those places much larger and better than in\r\nother parts of the field.\r\n\r\nThis improvement arises from various causes.\r\n\r\n1. The evaporation of water from the soil is prevented during drought by\r\nthe shade afforded by the mulch; and it is therefore kept in better\r\ncondition, as to moisture and temperature, than when evaporation goes on\r\nmore freely. This condition is well calculated to advance the chemical\r\nchanges necessary to prepare the matters--both organic and mineral--in\r\nthe soil for the use of plants.\r\n\r\n2. By preventing evaporation, we partially protect the soil from losing\r\nammonia resultant from decaying organic matter.\r\n\r\n3. A heavy mulch breaks the force of rains, and prevents them from\r\ncompacting the soil, as would be the result, were no such precaution\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n4. Mulching protects the surface-soil from freezing as readily as when\r\nexposed, and thus keeps it longer open for the admission of air and\r\nmoisture. When unprotected, the soil early becomes frozen; and all water\r\nfalling, instead of entering as it should do, passes off on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Why does mulching take the place of artificial watering?\r\n\r\nWhy is the late sowing of oats beneficial?\r\n\r\nFrom what arises the chief benefit of top dressing the soil with manure\r\nin autumn?]\r\n\r\n5. The throwing out of winter grain is often prevented, because this is\r\ndue to the freezing of the surface-soil.\r\n\r\n6. Mulching prevents the growth of some weeds, because it removes from\r\nthem the fostering heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nMany of the best nursery-men keep the soil about the roots of young\r\ntrees mulched continually. One of the chief arguments for this treatment\r\nis, that it prevents the removal of the moisture from the soil and the\r\nconsequent loss of heat. Also that it keeps up a full supply of water\r\nfor the uses of the roots, because it keeps the soil cool, and causes a\r\ndeposit of dew.\r\n\r\n7. It also prevents the \"baking\" of the soil, or the formation of a\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nIt is to be recommended in nearly all cases to sow oats very thinly over\r\nland intended for winter fallow after the removal of crops, as they will\r\ngrow a little before being killed by the frost, when they will fall\r\ndown, thus affording a very beneficial mulch to the soil.\r\n\r\nWhen farmers spread manure on their fields in the fall to be plowed\r\nunder in the spring, they benefit the land by the mulching more than by\r\nthe addition of fertilizing matter, because they give it the protecting\r\ninfluence of the straw, etc., while they lose much of the ammonia of\r\ntheir manure by evaporation. The same mulching might be more cheaply\r\ndone with leaves, or other refuse matter, and the ammonia of the manure\r\nmade available by composting with absorbents.\r\n\r\n[Why is snow particularly beneficial?]\r\n\r\nIt is an old and true saying that \"snow is the poor man's manure.\" The\r\nreason why it is so beneficial is, chiefly, that it acts as a most\r\nexcellent mulch. It contains no more ammonia than rain-water does; and,\r\nwere it not for the fact that it protects the soil against loss of heat,\r\nand produces other benefits of mulching, it would have no more\r\nadvantageous effect. The severity of winters at the North is partially\r\ncompensated by the long duration of snow.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that when there is but little snow in cold\r\ncountries, wheat is very liable to be _winter killed_. The same\r\nprotection is afforded by artificial mulching.\r\n\r\nThis treatment is peculiarly applicable to the cultivation of flowers,\r\nboth in pots and in beds out of doors. It is almost indispensable to the\r\nprofitable production of strawberries, and many other garden crops, such\r\nas asparagus, rhubarb, etc. Many say that the best treatment for trees\r\nis to put stones about their roots. This is simply _mulching_ them, and\r\nmight be done more cheaply by the use of leaves, copying the action of\r\nnature in forests;[AM] for, unless these stones be removed in spring,\r\nthey will sink and compact the soil in part during open weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEDING.\r\n\r\n[What are some of the uses of weeds? Their disadvantages?]\r\n\r\nIf a farmer were asked--what is the use of _weeds_? he might make out\r\nquite a list of their benefits, among which might be some of the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. They shade tender plants, and in a measure serve as a mulch to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n2. Some weeds, by their offensive odor, drive away many insects.\r\n\r\n3. They may serve as a green crop to be plowed into the soil, and\r\nincrease its organic matter.\r\n\r\n4. _They make us stir the soil_, and thus increase its fertility.\r\n\r\nStill, while thinking out these excuses for weeds, he would see other\r\nand more urgent reasons why they should not be allowed to grow.\r\n\r\n1. They occupy the soil to the disadvantage of crops.\r\n\r\n2. They exclude light and heat from cultivated plants, and thus\r\ninterfere with their growth.\r\n\r\n3. They take up mineral and other matters from the soil, and hold them\r\nduring the growing season, thus depriving crops of their use.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to argue the injury done by weeds. Every farmer is\r\nwell convinced that they should be destroyed, and the best means of\r\naccomplishing this are of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n[How may we protect ourselves against their increase?\r\n\r\nWhy is it especially important for this purpose to maintain the balance\r\nof the soil?]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we should protect ourselves against their increase.\r\nThis may be done:--\r\n\r\nBy decomposing all manures in compost, whereby the seeds contained will\r\nbe killed by the heat of fermentation; or, if one bushel of salt be\r\nmixed through each cord of compost (as before recommended), it will kill\r\nseeds as well as grubs,--\r\n\r\nBy hoeing, or, otherwise, destroying growing weeds before they mature\r\ntheir seeds, and\r\n\r\nBy keeping the soil in the best chemical condition.\r\n\r\nThis last point is one of much importance. It is well known that soils\r\ndeficient in potash, will naturally produce one kind of plants, while\r\nsoils deficient in phosphoric acid will produce plants of another\r\nspecies, etc. Many soils produce certain weeds which would not grow on\r\nthem if they were made chemically perfect, as indicated by analysis. It\r\nis also believed that those weeds, which naturally grow on the most\r\nfertile soils, are the ones most easily destroyed. There are exceptions\r\n(of which the Thistle is one), but this is given as a general rule.\r\n\r\n[How much salt may be used with advantage?\r\n\r\nWhy is the scuffle-hoe superior to the common hoe?]\r\n\r\nBy careful attention to the foregoing points, weeds may be kept from\r\nincreasing while those already in the soil may be eradicated in various\r\nways, chiefly by mechanical means, such as hoeing, plowing, etc.[AN]\r\n\r\nProf. Mapes says that six bushels of salt annually sown broadcast over\r\neach acre of land, will destroy very many weeds as well as grubs and\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nThe _common hoe_ is a very imperfect tool for the purpose of removing\r\nweeds, as it prepares a better soil for, and replants in a position to\r\ngrow, nearly as many weeds as it destroys.\r\n\r\nThe _scuffle-hoe_ (or push-hoe) is much more effective, as, when worked\r\nby a man walking backwards, and retiring as he works, it leaves nearly\r\nall of the weeds on the surface of the soil to be killed by the sun.\r\nWhen used in this way, the earth is not trodden on after being hoed--as\r\nis the case when the common hoe is employed. This treading, besides\r\ncompacting the soil, covers the roots of many weeds, and causes them to\r\ngrow again.\r\n\r\n[How may much labor be saved in removing weeds?\r\n\r\nWhat is the Langdon horse-hoe?\r\n\r\nDescribe the _universal_ cultivator?]\r\n\r\nMuch of the labor of weeding usually performed by men, might be more\r\ncheaply done by horses. There are various implements for this purpose,\r\nsome of which are coming, in many parts of the country, into very\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\nOne of the best of these is the _Langdon Horse Hoe_, which is a\r\nshovel-shaped plow, to be run one or two inches deep. It has a wing on\r\neach side to prevent the earth from falling on to the plants in the\r\nrows. At the rear, or upper edge, is a kind of rake or comb, which\r\nallows the earth to pass through, while the weeds pass over the comb and\r\nfall on the surface of the soil, to be killed by the heat of the sun. It\r\nis a simple and cheap tool, and will perform the work of twenty men with\r\nhoes. The hand hoe will be necessary only in the rows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATOR.\r\n\r\nThe _cultivator_, which was described in the preceding chapter, and of\r\nwhich there are various patterns in use, is excellent for weeding, and\r\nfor loosening the soil between the rows of corn, etc. The one called\r\nthe _universal_ cultivator, having its side bars made of iron, curved so\r\nthat at whatever distance it is placed the teeth will point _straight\r\nforward_, is a much better tool than those of the older patterns, which\r\nhad the teeth so arranged that when set for wide rows, they pointed\r\ntowards the clevis. It is difficult to keep such a cultivator in its\r\nplace, while the \"_universal_\" is as difficult to move out of a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HORSE-HOE.\r\n\r\n[What is the improved horse-hoe?]\r\n\r\nThe _improved horse-hoe_ is a combination of the \"Langdon\" horse hoe and\r\nthe cultivator, and is the best implement, for many purposes, that has\r\nyet been made.[AO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9]\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING MACHINES.\r\n\r\nUntil within a comparatively short period, but little attention has been\r\npaid to the production of machines for harvesting the various crops.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years, however, many valuable inventions have\r\nappeared. Among these we notice Ketchum's mower, Hussey's mower and\r\nreaper, and Wagener's grain and grass seed harvester. The latter machine\r\ngathers only the grain and seeds of the crop, leaving the straw to be\r\nplowed under the soil, thus maintaining its supply of soluble silicates,\r\nand increasing its amount of organic matter. After taking the seed heads\r\nfrom the standing straw and grasses, it thrashes them, blows out the\r\nchaff, separates the different kinds of seeds, and discharges them into\r\nbags ready for market. It consists of a car containing the machinery; to\r\nthis may be attached any required number of horses. The inventor affirms\r\nthat it has harvested the grain of two acres in one hour, performing the\r\nwork with accuracy.[AP]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is much truth in the following proverbs:\r\n\r\n\"A garden that is well kept, is kept easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must conquer weeds, or weeds will conquer you.\"\r\n\r\n[What are the two great rules in mechanical cultivation?]\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to give a _recapitulation_ of the matters\r\ntreated in this section, as it is, itself, but an outline of subjects\r\nwhich might occupy our whole book. The scholar and the farmer should\r\nunderstand every principle which it contains, as well as they understand\r\nthe multiplication table; and their application will be found, in every\r\ninstance, to produce the best results.\r\n\r\nThe two great rules of mechanical cultivation are--\r\n\r\nTHOROUGH UNDER-DRAINING.\r\n\r\nDEEP AND FREQUENT DISTURBANCE OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AL] Field rollers should be made in sections, for ease of turning.\r\n\r\n[AM] The beneficial effects of mulching is so great as to lead us to the\r\nconclusion that it has other means of action than those mentioned in\r\nthis book. Future experiments may lead to more knowledge on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[AN] It is possible that the excrementitious matter thrown out by some\r\nplants may be sufficiently destructive to other kinds to exterminate\r\nthem from the soil--thus, farmers in Maine say that a single crop of\r\nturnips will entirely rid the soil of _witch grass_. This is,\r\nundoubtedly, the effect of the excrementitious matter of the turnips.\r\nThis subject is one of practical importance, and demands close\r\ninvestigation by farmers, which may lead to its being reduced to a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[AO] The improved horse-hoe is made and sold by Ruggles, Nourse & Mason,\r\nof Worcester, Mass., and Quincy Hall, Boston.\r\n\r\n[AP] This machine is more fully noticed in the advertising pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIFTH.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Why does true practical economy require that the soil should\r\nbe analyzed?]\r\n\r\nAt the present time, when such marked improvements have been, and are\r\nstill being made, in the practice of agriculture, the farmer cannot be\r\ntoo strongly advised to procure an analysis of his soil, and for obvious\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nIt has been sufficiently proved that the plant draws from the soil\r\ncertain kinds of mineral matter, in certain proportions; also, that if\r\nthe soil do not contain the constituents required, the plants cannot\r\nobtain them, and consequently cannot grow. Furthermore, in proportion to\r\nthe ability of the soil to supply these materials, in exactly the same\r\nproportion will it, when under good treatment, produce good and\r\nabundant crops.\r\n\r\n[Can each farmer make his own analyses?\r\n\r\nWhy will not travelling chemists answer the purpose?\r\n\r\nHow must an analysis be used?]\r\n\r\nAll admit the value and the necessity of manures; they are required to\r\nmake up deficiencies in the soil, and consequently, they must supply to\r\nit the matters which are wanting. In order to know what is wanting, we\r\nmust know the composition of the soil. This can be learned only by\r\naccurate chemical analysis. Such an analysis every farmer must possess\r\nbefore he can conduct his operations with _true practical economy_.\r\n\r\nAn important question now arises as to whether each farmer can make his\r\nown analyses. He cannot do so without long study and practice. The late\r\nProf. Norton said that, at least _two years'_ time would be necessary to\r\nenable a man to become competent to make a reliable analysis. When we\r\nreflect that a farmer may never need more than five or six analyses, we\r\nshall see that the time necessary to learn the art would be much more\r\nvaluable than the cost of the analyses (at $5 or $10 each), setting\r\naside the cost of apparatus, and the fact that while practising in the\r\nlaboratory, he must not use his hands for any labor that would unfit\r\nthem for the most delicate manipulations.\r\n\r\nNeither will _travelling_ chemists be able to make analyses as\r\naccurately and as cheaply as those who work in their own laboratories,\r\nwhere their apparatus is not liable to the many injuries consequent on\r\nfrequent removal. The cost of sending one hundred samples of soil to a\r\ndistant chemist, would be much less than the expense of having his\r\napparatus brought to the town where his services are required.\r\n\r\n[How may a farmer obtain the requisite knowledge?\r\n\r\nWhen are the services of a consulting agriculturist required?]\r\n\r\n_The way in which an analysis should be used_ is a matter of much\r\nimportance. To a man who knows nothing of chemistry (be he ever so\r\nsuccessful a farmer), an analysis, as received from a chemist, would be\r\nas useless and unintelligible as though it were written in Chinese;\r\nwhile, if a chemist who knew nothing of farming, were to give him advice\r\nconcerning the application of manures, he would be led equally astray,\r\nand his course would be any thing but _practical_. It is necessary that\r\nchemical and practical knowledge should be combined, and then the value\r\nof analysis will be fully demonstrated. The _amount_ of knowledge\r\nrequired is not great, but it must be _thorough_. The information\r\ncontained in this little book is sufficient, but it would be folly for a\r\nman to attempt to use an analysis from reading it once hurriedly over.\r\nIt must be studied and thought on with great care, before it can be of\r\nmaterial assistance. The evenings of one winter, devoted to this\r\nsubject, will enable a farmer to understand the application of analysis\r\nto practical farming, especially if other and more compendious works\r\nare also read. A less time could hardly be recommended.\r\n\r\n[Is there any doubt as to the practical value of analysis?\r\n\r\nHow should samples of soil for analysis be selected?]\r\n\r\nWhere this attention cannot be given to the subject, the services of a\r\nConsulting Agriculturist should be employed to advise the treatment\r\nnecessary to render fertile the soil analyzed.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer, however, should learn enough of the principles of\r\nagriculture to be able to use an analysis, when procured, without such\r\nassistance.[AQ]\r\n\r\nNearly all scientific men (all of the highest merit) are unanimous in\r\ntheir conviction of the _practical_ value of an analysis of soils; and a\r\nvolume of instances of their success, with hardly a single failure,\r\nmight be published.\r\n\r\nProf. Mapes says, in the _Working Farmer_, that he has given advice on\r\nhundreds of different soils, and _not a single instance_ can be found\r\nwhere he has failed to produce a profit greater than the cost of\r\nanalysis and advice. Dr. T. C. Jackson, of Boston, the late Prof.\r\nNorton, of Yale College, and others, have had universal success in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAnalysis must be considered the only sure road to economical farming.\r\n\r\n_To select samples of soil for analysis_, take a spadeful from various\r\nparts of the field--going to exactly the depth to which it has been\r\nplowed--until, say a wheel-barrow full, has been obtained. Mix this\r\nwell together, and send about a quart or a pint of it (free from stones)\r\nto the chemist. This will represent all of that part of the farm which\r\nhas been subject to the same cultivation, and is of the same mechanical\r\ncharacter. If there are marked differences in the kinds of soil,\r\nseparate analyses will be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Give an instance of the success of treatment according to\r\nanalysis?]\r\n\r\nWhen an analysis is obtained, a regular debtor and creditor account may\r\nbe kept with the soil; and the farmer may know by the composition of the\r\nashes of his crops, and the manures supplied, whether he is maintaining\r\nthe fertility of his soil.\r\n\r\nProf. Mapes once purchased some land which could not produce corn at\r\nall, and by applying only such manures as analysis indicated to be\r\nnecessary, at a cost of less than $2 per acre, he obtained the first\r\nyear over _fifty bushels of shelled corn per acre_. The land has since\r\ncontinued to improve, and is as fertile as any in the State. It has\r\nproduced in one season a sufficient crop of cabbages to pay the expense\r\nof cultivation, and over $250 per acre besides, though it was apparently\r\n_worthless_ when he purchased it.\r\n\r\nThese are strong facts, and should arouse the farmers of the whole\r\ncountry to their true interests. Let them not call the teachings of\r\nscience \"book-farming,\" but \"prove all things--hold fast that which is\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AQ] See Author's card in the front of the

Let us look at two pictures and decide.\r\n\r\nHere is a farm of 100 acres in ordinary condition. It is owned and\r\ntilled by a hard-working man, who, in the busy season, employs one or\r\ntwo assistants. The farm is free from debt, but it does not produce an\r\nabundant income; therefore, its owner cannot afford to purchase the best\r\nimplements, or make other needed improvements; besides, he don't\r\n_believe_ in such things. His father was a good solid farmer; so was his\r\ngrandfather; and so is he, or thinks he is. He is satisfied that 'the\r\ngood old way' is best, and he sticks to it. He works from morning till\r\nnight; from spring till fall. In the winter, he _rests_, as much as his\r\nlessened duties will allow. During this time, he reads little, or\r\nnothing. Least of all does he read about farming. He don't want to learn\r\nhow to dig potatoes out of a book. Book farming is nonsense. Many other\r\nsimilar ideas keep him from agricultural reading. His house is\r\ncomfortable, and his barns are quite as good as his neighbors', while\r\nhis farm gives him a living. It is true that his soil does not produce\r\nas much as it did ten years ago; but prices are better, and he is\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nLet us look at his premises, and see how his affairs are managed. First,\r\nexamine the land. Well, it is good fair land. Some of it is a little\r\nspringy, but is not to be called _wet_. It will produce a ton and a half\r\nof hay to the acre--it used to produce two tons. There are some stones\r\non the land, but not enough in his estimation to do harm. The plowed\r\nfields are pretty good; they will produce 35 bushels of corn, 13 bushels\r\nof wheat, or 30 bushels of oats per acre, when the season is not dry.\r\nHis father used to get more; but, somehow, the _weather_ is not so\r\nfavorable as it was in old times. He has thought of raising root crops,\r\nbut they take more labor than he can afford to hire. Over, in the back\r\npart of the land there is a muck-hole, which is the only piece of\r\n_worthless_ land on the whole farm.\r\n\r\nNow, let us look at the barns and barn-yards. The stables are pretty\r\ngood. There are some wide cracks in the siding, but they help to\r\nventilate, and make it healthier for the cattle. The manure is thrown\r\nout of the back windows, and is left in piles under the eaves on the\r\nsunny side of the barn. The rain and sun make it nicer to handle. The\r\ncattle have to go some distance for water; and this gives them exercise.\r\nAll of the cattle are not kept in the stable; the fattening stock are\r\nkept in the various fields, where hay is fed out to them from the stack.\r\nThe barn-yard is often occupied by cattle, and is covered with their\r\nmanure, which lies there until it is carted on to the land. In the shed\r\nare the tools of the farm, consisting of carts, plows--not deep plows,\r\nthis farmer thinks it best to have roots near the surface of the soil\r\nwhere they can have the benefit of the sun's heat,--a harrow, hoes,\r\nrakes, etc. These tools are all in good order; and, unlike those of his\r\nless prudent neighbor, they are protected from the weather.\r\n\r\nThe crops are cultivated with the plow, and hoe, as they have been since\r\nthe land was cleared, and as they always will be until this man dies.\r\n\r\nHere is the 'practical farmer' of the present day. Hard working, out of\r\ndebt, and economical--of dollars and cents, if not of soil and manures.\r\nHe is a better farmer than two thirds of the three millions of farmers\r\nin the country. He is one of the best farmers in his town--there are but\r\nfew better in the county, not many in the State. He represents the\r\nbetter class of his profession.\r\n\r\nWith all this, he is, in matters relating to his business, an unreading,\r\nunthinking man. He knows nothing of the first principles of farming, and\r\nis successful by the _indulgence_ of nature, not because he understands\r\nher, and is able to make the most of her assistance.\r\n\r\nThis is an unpleasant fact, but it is one which cannot be denied. We do\r\nnot say this to disparage the farmer, but to arouse him to a realization\r\nof his position and of his power to improve it.\r\n\r\nBut let us see where he is wrong.\r\n\r\nHe is wrong in thinking that his land does not need draining. He is\r\nwrong in being satisfied with one and a half tons of hay to the acre\r\nwhen he might easily get two and a half. He is wrong in not removing as\r\nfar as possible every stone that can interfere with the deep and\r\nthorough cultivation of his soil. He is wrong in reaping less than his\r\nfather did, when he should get more. He is wrong in ascribing to the\r\nweather, and similar causes, what is due to the actual impoverishment of\r\nhis soil. He is wrong in not raising turnips, carrots, and other roots,\r\nwhich his winter stock so much need, when they might be raised at a cost\r\nof less than one third of their value as food. He is wrong in\r\nconsidering worthless a deposit of muck, which is a mine of wealth if\r\nproperly employed. He is wrong in _ventilating_ his stables at the cost\r\nof _heat_. He is wrong in his treatment of his manures, for he loses\r\nmore than one half of their value from evaporation, fermentation, and\r\nleaching. He is wrong in not having water at hand for his cattle--their\r\nexercise detracts from their accumulation of fat and their production of\r\nheat, and it exposes them to cold. He is wrong in not protecting his\r\nfattening stock from the cold of winter; for, under exposure to cold,\r\nthe food, which would otherwise be used in the formation of _fat_, goes\r\nto the production of the animal heat necessary to counteract the\r\nchilling influence of the weather, p. 50. He is wrong in allowing his\r\nmanure to lie unprotected in the barn-yard. He is wrong in not adding to\r\nhis tools the deep surface plow, the subsoil plow, the cultivator, and\r\nmany others of improved construction. He is wrong in cultivating with\r\nthe plow and hoe, those crops which could be better or more cheaply\r\nmanaged with the cultivator or horse-hoe. He is wrong in many things\r\nmore, as we shall see if we examine all of his yearly routine of work.\r\nHe is right in a few things; and but a few, as he himself would admit,\r\nhad he that knowledge of his business which he could obtain in the\r\nleisure hours of a single winter. Still, he thinks himself a _practical_\r\nfarmer. In twenty years, we shall have fewer such, for our young men\r\nhave the mental capacity and mental energy necessary to raise them to\r\nthe highest point of practical education, and to that point they are\r\ngradually but surely rising.\r\n\r\nLet us now place this same farm in the hands of an educated and\r\nunderstanding cultivator; and, at the end of five years, look at it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe has sold one half of it, and cultivates but fifty acres. The money\r\nfor which the other fifty were sold has been used in the improvement of\r\nthe farm. The land has all been under-drained, and shows the many\r\nimprovements consequent on such treatment. The stones and small rocks\r\nhave been removed, leaving the surface of the soil smooth, and allowing\r\nthe use of the sub-soil plow, which with the under-drains have more than\r\ndoubled the productive power of the farm. Sufficient labor is employed\r\nto cultivate with improved tools, extensive root crops, and they\r\ninvariably give a large yield. The grass land produces a yearly average\r\nof 2½ tons of hay per acre. From 80 to 100 bushels of corn, 30 bushels\r\nof wheat, and 45 bushels of oats are the average of the crops reaped.\r\nThe soil has been analyzed, and put in the best possible condition,\r\nwhile it is yearly supplied with manures containing every thing taken\r\naway in the abundant crops. The analysis is never lost sight of in the\r\nregulation of crops and the application of manures. The _worthless_ muck\r\nbed was retained, and is made worth one dollar a load to the compost\r\nheap, especially as the land requires an increase of organic matter. A\r\nnew barn has been built large enough to store all of the hay produced on\r\nthe farm. It has stables, which are tight and warm, and are well\r\nventilated _above_ the cattle. The stock being thus protected from the\r\nloss of their heat, give more milk, and make more fat on a less amount\r\nof food than they did under the old system. Water is near at hand, and\r\nthe animals are not obliged to over exercise. The manure is carefully\r\ncomposted, either under a shed constructed for the purpose with a tank\r\nand pump, or is thrown into the cellar below, where the hogs mix it with\r\na large amount of muck, which has been carted in after being thoroughly\r\ndecomposed by the lime and salt mixture.\r\n\r\nThey are thus protected against all loss, and are prepared for the\r\nimmediate use of crops. No manures are allowed to lie in the barn-yard,\r\nbut they are all early removed to the compost heap, where they are\r\npreserved by being mixed with carbonaceous matter. In the tool shed, we\r\nfind deep surface-plows, sub-soil plows, cultivators, horse-hoes,\r\nseed-drills, and many other valuable improvements.\r\n\r\nThis farmer takes one or more agricultural papers, from which he learns\r\nmany new methods of cultivation, while his knowledge of the _reasons_ of\r\nvarious agricultural effects enables him to discard the injudicious\r\nsuggestions of mere _book farmers_ and uneducated dreamers.\r\n\r\nHere are two specimens of farmers. Neither description is over-drawn.\r\nThe first is much more careful in his operations than the majority of\r\nour rural population. The second is no better than many who may be found\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to the common sense of the reader of this work to know which\r\nof the two is the _practical farmer_--let him imitate either as his\r\njudgment shall dictate.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORB--to soak in a liquid or a gas.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT--to take from.\r\n\r\nACID--sour; a sour substance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE--the art of cultivating the soil.\r\n\r\nALKALI--the direct opposite of an _acid_, with which it has a tendency\r\n    to unite.\r\n\r\nALUMINA--the base of clay.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS--separating into its primary parts any compound substance.\r\n\r\nCARBONATE--a compound, consisting of carbonic acid and an alkali.\r\n\r\nCAUSTIC--burning.\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE--a compound containing chlorine.\r\n\r\nCLEVIS--that part of a plow by which the drawing power is attached.\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSE--to separate the constituents of a body from their\r\n    combinations, forming new kinds of compounds.\r\n\r\nDIGESTION--the decomposition of food in the stomach and intestines of\r\n    animals (agricultural).\r\n\r\nDEW--deposit of the insensible vapor of the atmosphere on cold bodies.\r\n\r\nEXCREMENT--the matter given out by the organs of plants and animals,\r\n    being those parts of their food which they are unable to assimilate.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION--a kind of decomposition.\r\n\r\nGAS--air--aeriform matter.\r\n\r\nGURNEYISM--see _Mulching_.\r\n\r\nINGREDIENT--component part.\r\n\r\nINORGANIC--mineral, or earthy.\r\n\r\nMOULDBOARD--that part of a surface plow which turns the sod.\r\n\r\nMULCHING--covering the soil with litter, leaves, or other refuse matter.\r\n    See p. 247.\r\n\r\nNEUTRALIZE--To overcome the characteristic properties of.\r\n\r\nORGANIC MATTER--that kind of matter which at times possesses an\r\n    organized (or living) form, and at others exists as a gas in the\r\n    atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOXIDE--a compound of oxygen with a metal.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHATE--a compound of phosphoric acid with an alkali.\r\n\r\nPROXIMATE--an organic compound, such as wood, starch, gum, etc.; a\r\n    product of life.\r\n\r\nPUNGENT--pricking.\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTION--rotting.\r\n\r\nSATURATE--to _fill_ the pores of any substance, as a sponge with water,\r\n    or charcoal with ammonia.\r\n\r\nSILICATE--a compound of silica with an alkali.\r\n\r\nSOLUBLE--capable of being dissolved.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION--a liquid containing another substance dissolved in it.\r\n\r\nSATURATED SOLUTION--one which contains as much of the foreign substance\r\n    as it is capable of holding.\r\n\r\nSPONGIOLES--the mouths at the ends of roots.\r\n\r\nSULPHATE--a compound of sulphuric acid with an alkali.\r\n\r\nVAPOR--gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKETCHUM'S\r\n\r\nPATENT MOWING MACHINES\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The greatest Improvement ever made for Simplicity, Durability, and Ease\r\nof Action.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now beyond a question, from the complete triumph over all other\r\nmachines this season, that this is the _only_ successful Grass Cutter\r\nknown.

APPLETON AND CO.'S PUBLICATIONS._\r\n\r\nPopular Science.\r\n\r\nThe Chemistry of Common Life.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES F. W. JOHNSTON, M.A., F.R.S.S. L. & E., &c.\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry and Geology,\" a \"Catechism\r\nof Agricultural Chemistry and Geology,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n    The common life of man is full of wonders, Chemical and\r\n    Physiological. Most of us pass through this life without seeing\r\n    or being sensible of them, though every day our existence and\r\n    our comforts ought to recall them to our minds. One main cause\r\n    of this is, that our schools tell us nothing about them--do not\r\n    teach those parts of modern learning which would fit us for\r\n    seeing them. What most concerns the things that daily occupy our\r\n    attention and cares, are in early life almost sedulously kept\r\n    from our knowledge. Those who would learn any thing regarding\r\n    them, must subsequently teach themselves through the help of the\r\n    press: hence the necessity for a Popular Chemical Literature.\r\n\r\n    It is with a view to meet this want of the Public, and at the\r\n    same time to supply a Manual for the Schools, that the present\r\n    work has been projected. It treats, in what appears to be their\r\n    natural order, of THE AIR WE BREATHE and THE WATER WE DRINK, in\r\n    their relations to human life and health--THE SOIL WE CULTIVATE\r\n    AND THE PLANT WE REAR, as the sources from which the chief\r\n    sustenance of all life is obtained--THE BREAD WE EAT AND THE\r\n    BEEF WE COOK, as the representatives of the two grand divisions\r\n    of human food--THE BEVERAGES WE INFUSE, from which so much of\r\n    the comfort of modern life, both savage and civilized, is\r\n    derived--THE SWEETS WE EXTRACT, the history of which presents so\r\n    striking an illustration of the economical value of chemical\r\n    science--THE LIQUORS WE FERMENT, so different from the sweets in\r\n    their action on the system, and yet so closely connected with\r\n    them in chemical history--THE NARCOTICS WE INDULGE IN, as\r\n    presenting us with an aspect of the human constitution which,\r\n    both chemically and physiologically, is more mysterious and\r\n    wonderful than any other we are acquainted with--THE ODOURS WE\r\n    ENJOY AND THE SMELLS WE DISLIKE; the former because of the\r\n    beautiful illustration it presents of the recent progress of\r\n    organic chemistry in its relations to comforts of common life,\r\n    and the latter because of its intimate connection with our most\r\n    important sanitary arrangements--WHAT WE BREATHE FOR and WHY WE\r\n    DIGEST, as functions of the body at once the most important to\r\n    life, and the most purely chemical in their nature--THE BODY WE\r\n    CHERISH, as presenting many striking phenomena, and performing\r\n    many interesting chemical functions not touched upon in the\r\n    discussion of the preceding topics--and lastly, THE CIRCULATION\r\n    OF MATTER, as exhibiting in one view the end, purpose, and\r\n    method of all the changes in the natural body, in organic\r\n    nature, and in the mineral kingdom, which are connected with and\r\n    determine the existence of life.\r\n\r\n    It has been the object of the Author in this Work to exhibit the\r\n    present condition of chemical knowledge and of matured\r\n    scientific opinion upon the subjects to which it is devoted. The\r\n    reader will not be surprised, therefore, should he find in it\r\n    some things which differ from what is to be found in other\r\n    popular works already in his hands or on the shelves of his\r\n    library.\r\n\r\n    The Work is being published in 5 or 6 NUMBERS, price 25 cents\r\n    each, in the following order, forming 1 vol. 12mo. of about 400\r\n    pages.\r\n\r\n    1. The AIR we Breathe and\r\n    2. The WATER we Drink.\r\n    3. The SOIL we Cultivate and\r\n    4. The PLANT we Rear.\r\n    5. The BREAD we Eat and\r\n    6. The BEEF we Cook.\r\n    7.

The teeth being made to spring\r\nand vibrate, not a particle of clover, however stalky or thick, can\r\npossibly escape being cut, or allow the teeth to become clogged. The\r\nCylinder and Knives are protected by an adjustible guard plate, thus\r\nallowing only the heads to pass to the Knives, retaining the head, and\r\nthe head only--thus leaving the stalk to enrich the soil. The machine is\r\nso constructed that it can be made adjustible to the height of the\r\nClover and Timothy.\r\n\r\nTo be seen at the Crystal Palace. Price of the machines moderate.\r\n\r\n    The Farmer will find that by this process, he may save two crops\r\n    of Timothy per year. When the seed is ripe the tops can be\r\n    clipped, and the straw left until fall to mature. You now have\r\n    your seed and hay in two crops of equal value; in case of\r\n    clover, you mow the first crop for hay, the second for seed; you\r\n    in both cases get better seed and hay with less labor and\r\n    expense than grain crops, at the same time leaving the soil\r\n    clothed with a coat of straw, for the coming season, which will\r\n    increase the value of the soil for crops, make fine pastures and\r\n    fine stock, while it fits the land for fine grain. In this way\r\n    lands in our states have been raised in production from five to\r\n    twenty-five or thirty bushels of wheat per acre, in the course\r\n    of a few years.\r\n\r\n    This is within the reach of every farmer, without money or\r\n    labor, as organic matter accumulates from the atmosphere and is\r\n    deposited in the soil.\r\n\r\nManufactured and for sale by the Patentee and Proprietor,\r\n\r\nJEPTHA A.
