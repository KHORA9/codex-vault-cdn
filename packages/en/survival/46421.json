The pelage is full, especially in\r\nwinter. The usual color is a dirty gray, with more or less reddish\r\ntinge about the head, neck, and legs, and black hairs showing about\r\nthe shoulders and on the back. The extent of the red and the black\r\nvaries much with the different species.\r\n\r\nCoyotes are generally distributed from the central Mississippi Valley\r\nto the Pacific coast and from Costa Rica on the south to the plains\r\nof the Athabasca on the north.[A] In this extensive range about a\r\ndozen species have been thus far recognized.[B] Four of these are\r\nrestricted to Mexico and Central America. Of the eight forms that\r\noccur in the United States, it may be remarked that their ranges and\r\nrelations to each other have not been fully determined. Much material\r\nis yet needed before anyone can write with exact knowledge of\r\ntheir distribution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Edward A. Preble informs the writer that the coyote has\r\nbeen captured at Fort Smith, northern Athabasca (60° north latitude),\r\nand on Nelson River in northeastern British Columbia (59° north\r\nlatitude).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The following is a list of the forms:\r\n\r\n   1. _Canis latrans_ Say.

Chiapas, Mexico.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA group in which there is so much variation in size must also present\r\nconsiderable diversity of habits. The larger forms, like _C. latrans_,\r\nare, of course, the more injurious to the live-stock interests. Smaller\r\nspecies, like _C. estor_ and _microdon_, confine themselves in their\r\nfood more to the smaller wild mammals and thus do much less damage. Yet\r\nit is not the intention in this preliminary bulletin to consider the\r\nspecies separately. Indeed, no such detailed study of their habits has\r\nyet been made. The present paper deals with the group as a whole, and\r\nis confined to a discussion of the economic relations of coyotes in\r\ngeneral to our agricultural interests.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of fencing to protect sheep and poultry against coyote\r\ndepredations, the Biological Survey has made some preliminary\r\ninvestigations, and has formulated plans for more extensive experiments\r\nin the near future. In the meantime it is hoped that farmers and\r\nranchmen throughout the West who have had personal experience of the\r\nefficiency of various forms of fence as a protection against coyotes\r\nand other wild animals will write the Biological Survey fully as to\r\nsuch experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABUNDANCE OF COYOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoyotes are abundant in most parts of their range, except the extreme\r\nnorth and the more thickly populated regions where waste lands are\r\nscarce. It is, however, on the plains of the western part of the United\r\nStates that they come most closely in contact with the advancing\r\ntide of settlement. The establishment of pioneer homes throughout\r\nthe country has always resulted in restricting the numbers of the\r\nlarger wolves, which have gradually become extinct over large areas\r\nin the eastern and middle parts of the United States where they were\r\nformerly abundant. Not so with the coyote. Except in a few thickly\r\nsettled regions, it has thrived upon civilization and is practically\r\nas numerous as it was before settlements began. Indeed, in many parts\r\nof the West coyotes are said to be increasing in spite of a constant\r\nwarfare against them.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of domestic birds and mammals has provided the coyotes\r\nwith an additional food supply always available and entirely precluding\r\nany danger of starvation. Then, too, the animals are far too suspicious\r\nto be easily destroyed by the use of traps or poisons. Old hunters of\r\nthe Plains have informed the writer that while it was comparatively\r\neasy to poison large numbers of the gray wolf, the coyote was not an\r\neasy victim and usually avoided both the baited traps and the poisoned\r\nbuffalo carcasses.\r\n\r\nThe plains east of the Rocky Mountains and the higher plateaus of\r\nthe Great Basin west of the mountains are especially adapted to the\r\nwants of the coyote. Cultivated areas are far apart: stock ranges\r\nare extensive; tall grasses, weeds, cactuses, and sagebrush afford\r\nexcellent hiding places; rabbits, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and\r\nother small animals are plentiful; and, when these natural resources of\r\nthe country fail, sheep and young calves furnish abundant food.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the Western States the efforts of ranchmen to destroy\r\nthe coyote have been supplemented by laws authorizing the payment of\r\nbounties from public funds. Some of these laws have been in operation\r\nfor a score of years or even more and, except locally, no diminution\r\nin the general numbers of the animals has resulted. In some parts of\r\nMexico where the natives have for many years practiced systematic\r\npoisoning, the coyote is becoming rare, but in most sections of its\r\nrange it is either increasing or no substantial decrease has been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOYOTES IN KANSAS.\r\n\r\nThe State of Kansas, where settlements are comparatively old and where\r\nman's warfare against the coyote has been long continued, affords\r\nan excellent illustration of the animal's ability to maintain its\r\nnumbers under seemingly adverse circumstances. Most of the counties of\r\nthe State have for many years paid bounties for killing coyotes, and\r\nconditions have been reached where there is little fluctuation in the\r\ntotal amount paid from year to year. The returns of the animals killed\r\nfor the fiscal twelve months from July 1, 1903, to June 30, 1904, show\r\nthat nearly 20,000 scalps were presented for bounty in the State.\r\n\r\nThe following is a table, by counties, of the number of coyotes on\r\nwhich bounties were paid during the year above specified. Of the 11\r\nmissing counties, 10--Cherokee. Comanche. Finney. Grant, Haskell,\r\nKearney, Morton, Seward, Stevens, and Wyandotte--paid no bounties, and\r\n1, Doniphan, made no report. The bounty in all cases is $1 for each\r\nanimal killed.\r\n\r\n_Number of coyotes on which bounties were paid in Kansas from July 1,\r\n1903, to June 30. 1904._\r\n\r\n  County.

It may be duplicated in a\r\ndozen other Western States and in some of the British provinces. It is\r\nprobable that the united efforts of the people are keeping the coyotes\r\nin check, and that, were these efforts relaxed, the animals would be\r\nfar more abundant; but the coyotes are still so menacing to certain\r\ninterests that the subject requires careful investigation to determine\r\nwhat more may be done to improve present conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HABITS OF COYOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various forms of the coyote seem each to conform to particular\r\nfaunal areas. They inhabit all the life zones, from the Lower Boreal,\r\nthrough the Transition, the Upper and Lower Sonoran, and the semi-arid\r\nparts of the Tropical. In the northern part of its range C. latrans\r\nhas a migratory movement southward in winter and north ward in the\r\nspring, probably caused by the limited food supply of the northern\r\nwilds, and varying in degree with the severity of the seasons. A\r\nsimilar movement of other species in the western part of the United\r\nStates from the higher mountain areas to the valleys has been noticed.\r\nIn summer the mountain species range above timber line.\r\n\r\nThe coyotes are noted for their peculiar prolonged howling. A single\r\nanimal is capable of a performance which impresses the uninformed\r\nhearer as the concert of a dozen, and when several join in the medley\r\nthe resulting noise is indescribable. They are silent during the day,\r\nbut may be heard at any time between sunset and sunrise.\r\n\r\nCoyotes breed but once a year. The mating season is late in January\r\nor early in February. The period of gestation is probably that of\r\nthe whole genus _Canis_, which is given by Owen as about sixty-three\r\ndays. The young are produced in dens, and number from four to eight or\r\neven more. The dens are usually enlarged from those made by badgers\r\nor smaller animals and are often among rocks or in washed-out places\r\nalong banks of streams. Probably at times they are made entirely by\r\nthe coyotes. They are rarely far below the surface, but sometimes of\r\nconsiderable extent and with two or more openings. Little attempt is\r\nmade to provide nests for the young. In the Central West these are born\r\nearly in April and usually may be heard in the dens during May. In\r\nJune they come out to play around the mouths of the burrows, which are\r\nfinally deserted during July. By August 1, the young are left by the\r\nparents to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier descriptions, the prairie wolves were usually said\r\nto hunt in packs. Lewis and Clark, Say. Richardson, and others so\r\nreported, but the Prince of Wied met them only singly. It is probable\r\nthat they hunt in numbers only when the quarry is large, as in the ease\r\nof deer and antelope; but as many as three have been known to pursue a\r\nsingle jack rabbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD HABITS OF COYOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food of coyotes has been a subject of investigation by the field\r\nnaturalists of the Biological Survey, whenever opportunity offered. A\r\nnumber of stomach examinations have been made in the field: but trapped\r\nanimals are often found with empty stomachs. In the case of a number of\r\nthe species nothing definite is known of the food.\r\n\r\nThe stomachs examined contained mainly animal matter, but in two cases\r\nvegetable remains were found. One examined by Vernon Bailey contained\r\na quantity of ripe cultivated plums: and William Lloyd found a coyote\r\nthat had eaten mesquite beans. In northern Arizona Doctor Merriam\r\nsaw a coyote eating a watermelon, and a correspondent al Russell,\r\nKans., says that they sometimes cat ripe melons. In California they\r\ncat peaches, apricots, grapes, and other fruits. They cat also\r\njuniper berries, manzanita berries, and the fruit of the prickly pear\r\n(_Opuntia_).\r\n\r\nOnly one case of insect-eating has been observed by the Biological\r\nSurvey. The same animal that had eaten plums had in its stomach the\r\nremains of a large cricket (_Stenopelmatus fasciatus_).\r\n\r\nCoyotes feed greedily upon all kinds of animal food. This ranges\r\nfrom the larger hoofed mammals to the smallest rodents, and includes\r\nalso birds, reptiles, fish, and crustaceans. Three horned toads\r\n(_Phrynosoma_) were found in the stomach of a specimen killed June\r\n3, 1898, in Big Smoky Valley. Nevada, by Vernon Bailey. On the low\r\ntropical coast of eastern Mexico and Texas members of the Biological\r\nSurvey have often seen coyotes searching the beach for crabs, fish, and\r\nturtle eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFICIAL HABITS.\r\n\r\nAmong the mammals included in the food of the coyotes are many\r\ninjurious species; and, so far as their food is confined to these,\r\nthe animals are decidedly beneficial to the farming interests of the\r\ncountry. The destruction of rabbits, both large and small species, is\r\nof great advantage, especially on the plains and in the cultivated\r\nvalleys, where their depredations are keenly felt by the settlers. The\r\nvarious species of jack rabbit have often been observed as included in\r\nthe coyotes' fare, and the smaller rabbits are also habitually eaten.\r\nThe coyotes usually catch the rabbits by lying in wait behind bushes\r\nand bunches of grass near their paths and pouncing upon them as they\r\npass. Sometimes they have been known to hunt jack rabbits in company.\r\nWhile a single coyote would not be able to run down a jack rabbit, by\r\nhunting together, taking turns in the drive, and by taking advantage of\r\nthe tendency of the hare to run in a circle, they are able to capture\r\nit. Eye witnesses to such a performance state that they do not fight\r\nover the division of the rabbit's carcass, but that all obtain a share.\r\nThe constant warfare of many coyotes upon these rodents has much to\r\ndo in keeping down the numbers; and the abundance of rabbits in some\r\nsections of the West has been largely attributed to a local decrease in\r\nthe number of coyotes, caused by an unusual activity against them which\r\nhad been stimulated by high bounties.\r\n\r\nPrairie dogs (_Cynomys ludovicianus_ and other species) are also a\r\nstaple coyote food. The coyote captures them by hiding behind clumps\r\nof weeds or bunches of grass at some distance from the burrows. When\r\nthe unsuspecting rodent, in feeding, approaches near enough, a few\r\nleaps enable the coyote to secure it. The grass in a prairie dog\r\n'town' is usually cropped very short, and all tall-growing weeds\r\nare cut down. Sometimes a weed is permitted to grow to maturity on\r\nthe cone-like mound sit the mouth of a burrow. Only three species\r\nof weeds have been seen so growing by the writer--the horse nettle\r\n(_Solanum rostratum_), the Mexican poppy (_Argemone_), and a Euphorbia\r\n(_Euphorbia marginata_). These afford shade to the animals, but do not\r\nobstruct the view. All other weeds, and even cultivated crops, are cut\r\ndown to prevent the unseen approach of an enemy. When the cultivated\r\ncrop is some rapid-growing or dense one which they can not clear away,\r\nthey abandon the land rather than stay to be devoured.\r\n\r\nBut clearing the prairie dog town of weeds is not sufficient to baffle\r\nthe coyote. In the absence of hiding places he takes to new methods of\r\nhunting. J. H. Gaut, of the Biological Survey, records his observations\r\nin a prairie dog town in New Mexico:\r\n\r\n  The coyote started at one end of the town and ran at lightning speed\r\n  in a straight line until he cut off one from its burrow. When the\r\n  prairie dog saw that it could not get to its hole, it stopped and\r\n  began to kick until the coyote caught it and killed it in very much\r\n  the same way that a dog kills a rat.\r\n\r\nBesides rabbits and prairie dogs, the food of the coyote is known to\r\ninclude the following mammals:\r\n\r\nRice rats (_Oryzomys_), kangaroo rats (_Dipodomys_ and _Perodipus_),\r\nwood rats (_Neotoma_), ground squirrels (_Ammospermophilus_,\r\n_Callospermophilus_, and _Spermophilus_), woodchucks (_Marmota_), voles\r\n(_Microtus_), pocket gophers (_Thomomys_), chipmunks (_Eutamias_), and\r\npocket mice (_Perognathus_). All of these are more or less harmful,\r\nand the coyote performs an important service in preying upon them. The\r\nservice is not an occasional or a spasmodic one, but lasts throughout\r\nthe year and throughout the life of the coyote. When the number of\r\nanimals taking part in the work is considered, the enormous importance\r\nof its bearing in maintaining the 'balance of nature' becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nThe coyote is useful also as a scavenger. In the prairie country,\r\nespecially in winter, it comes into towns at night searching for\r\ngarbage thrown into the alleys. Here it finds remnants of meat from\r\nthe table, offal from game, and similar prizes. When hungry it will\r\nreject no animal food, not even carrion. The slaughterhouses near the\r\ntowns are favorite feeding places, and the animals are often shot there\r\nby moonlight. On the ranges they soon consume dead horses and cattle.\r\nLeaving the bones clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIOUS HABITS.\r\n\r\nCoyotes have been known to capture some of the wild animals that assist\r\nman in his warfare' against insects and rodent pests. Among them are\r\nthe weasels. In August, 1903, a member of the Biological Survey met a\r\ncoyote carrying a weasel in the Pecos River Mountains of New Mexico at\r\nan altitude of 11,600 feet. The coyote, frightened, dropped its prey\r\nand ran off. The various kinds of skunks also are probably captured and\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME DESTROYED BY COYOTES.\r\n\r\nCoyotes destroy considerable game. Birds that roost and nest on the\r\nground are frequent victims. Quail, grouse, and wild ducks are caught\r\non the nest, and both birds and eggs are eaten. Wild ducks and geese,\r\nwhen wounded and unable to fly, may be found along the banks of streams\r\nand ponds, and the coyotes regularly patrol the shores in search of\r\nthem. In Oklahoma I found fresh coyote tracks each morning on the\r\ngrassy borders of a large artificial pond. Ducks resorted there in\r\nconsiderable flocks, and I several times found that they had been eaten\r\nby coyotes, as evidenced by tracks of the animals and feathers of the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nLike the larger wolves, the prairie wolf kills deer and antelope. In\r\nhunting these they always go in packs of two or more and take turns\r\nin the chase. They know that their prey runs in large circles, and at\r\nintervals individuals drop out of the pursuit and, crossing a chord of\r\nthe circle, lie in wait until the quarry passes near them again. In\r\nthis way the wolves keep fresh until the pursued animal is exhausted,\r\nbut all of them are 'in at the death.' The present scarcity of these\r\nlarge game animals gives few opportunities for such chases, but on the\r\nplains they were formerly of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPREDATIONS ON FARM ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe coyote is widely and unfavorably known as a destroyer of domestic\r\nanimals. Its depredations upon these indicate a marked change of\r\nhabit since the first settlement of the West. Previously its food was\r\nrestricted to the wild animals, including young buffalo, antelope, and\r\ndeer. The destruction of the larger game by man may partly account\r\nfor the change to farm animals as a diet, but it is probable that\r\nthe quality of the introduced food had much to do with the coyote's\r\npreference for it.\r\n\r\nThe coyote kills hens, ducks, geese, and turkeys. Its usual method of\r\ncapturing them in daytime is to lurk behind weeds or bushes until the\r\nfowls come within reach. Turkeys, which range far afield in search\r\nof grasshoppers and other insects, are frequent victims. At night\r\nthe coyote captures poultry from the roost, provided the door of the\r\nhenhouse is left open. A correspondent of the Biological Survey wrote\r\nfrom Rexburg, Idaho, that one neighbor had lost 60 chickens and\r\nanother 30 in one night, taken by coyotes. Another correspondent, in\r\nMayer, Ariz., writes:\r\n\r\n  Have lost about 100 chickens by coyotes. With the exception of killing\r\n  chickens, I believe them to be beneficial in keeping down the rabbit\r\n  pest.\r\n\r\nIn approaching ranch buildings either by day or by night the coyote\r\nconies from the leeward side and with great caution. Once satisfied\r\nthat no danger lurks in the shadows, it becomes exceedingly hold.\r\nGeorge A. Coleman, formerly a member of the Biological Survey, wrote\r\nfrom London, Nemaha County, Nebr.:\r\n\r\n  Depredations by wolves here upon henroosts and pigpens are of frequent\r\n  occurrence. I have observed them several times. They come with a dash\r\n  into the yard, take a chicken by the neck, and are gone before anyone\r\n  can stop them. In the same way they visit the pigpens and take the\r\n  young pigs away from the mother. In one instance they made way with\r\n  eight 6-weeks-old pigs in one night. At another time two of them\r\n  attacked a pig which would have weighed 75 pounds, and had they not\r\n  been stopped by dog's would probably have killed it.\r\n\r\nFew of the mammals of the farm are exempt from coyote raids. Even house\r\ncats, roaming far from home in search of rodents or birds, become\r\nvictims. A correspondent of Forest and Stream, writing from Shirley\r\nBasin, Wyo., October 7, 1896, says:\r\n\r\n  I live on a ranch, and we are somewhat troubled by field mice and\r\n  mountain rats, and so we must keep cats. We have them, but we do not\r\n  keep them long, because they are caught by coyotes. Within a few\r\n  months I have lost four cats in this way.\r\n\r\nThe coyote has been known to kill the young of most farm\r\nanimals--colts, calves, pigs, lambs, and goats. Colts are seldom\r\nkilled, because the dam can usually protect them. Calves are taken only\r\nwhen the mother cow is feeding at a distance or has gone for water.\r\nThe coyotes lie watching in the grass until this opportunity comes.\r\nSometimes older animals are killed. Ranchmen in Oklahoma told the\r\nwriter that in winter yearling cattle in good condition are sometimes\r\nkilled by coyotes. To accomplish this two or more of them must hunt\r\ntogether, and get the victim separated from the herd.\r\n\r\nCapt. P. M. Thorne, writing to the Biological Survey from Fort Lyon,\r\nColo.. January 4, 1887, says:\r\n\r\n  Old cattlemen who have lived here nearly all their lives agree in\r\n  saying that the coyotes kill cattle, even full-grown ones. They say\r\n  that they have seen them at their work, which is done in packs; they\r\n  surround an animal and keep up a constant nipping at its legs until it\r\n  falls from weakness and loss of blood.\r\n\r\nIn July. 1893, at Farmington, Utah, Vernon Bailey saw two coyotes\r\nchasing calves and yearlings about a pasture, evidently trying to\r\nseparate one from the lot. He notes that in June. 1889, at St. Thomas,\r\nNev., coyotes killed a hog that weighed about 100 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COYOTE'S RELATION TO THE SHEEP INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nThe coyote is especially notorious as an enemy of the sheep industry.\r\nIn many parts of the West sheep raising has greatly languished because\r\nof the depredations of wild animals upon the flocks. While some of\r\nthe injury is caused by the larger wolves, mountain lions, bears, and\r\nlynxes, the coyotes are by far the most formidable enemy. They are\r\nnot only more abundant than the other animals mentioned, but they are\r\npresent throughout the year, and their depredations are a steady drain\r\nupon the resources of the flock owner, comparable in extent to the\r\nlosses caused by worthless dogs in many parts of the country.[D]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: In 1801 the loss from dogs was placed at $152,034 in Ohio\r\nand $200,000 in Missouri. (Sheep Industry in the United States. U. S.\r\nDept of Agric, 1892.)]\r\n\r\nDr. E. A. C. Foster, writing from Russell, Kans., in 1887, said:\r\n\r\n  Of mammals, the prairie wolf is perhaps the most troublesome. It is\r\n  constantly preying upon sheep and lambs; so much so that sheep can\r\n  not be left alone without some of them falling a prey to this animal.\r\n  Should the herder be absent or out of view, the wolf makes a dash into\r\n  the flock and usually secures a lamb.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd, writing from Paint Rock, Concho County, Tex., said:\r\n\r\n  In January. 1886, coyotes killed over 30 sheep near Fort Stockton, and\r\n  in March about 20 at Toyah, Tex.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Richmond, in 1888, wrote to the Survey from Gallatin County.\r\nMont., relating the following incident:\r\n\r\n  While we were camped near Bozeman a flock of some 4,000 sheep were\r\n  driven by, and night overtook them on some foothills south of Bozeman.\r\n  During the night a flock of coyotes entered the ranks and the sheep\r\n  stampeded. Many ran over some bluffs, and next morning sheep, dead\r\n  and dying, were several feet deep at the foot of the bluffs. Nearly\r\n  500 were counted in the pile, and for several days afterwards sheep,\r\n  with lacerated ears and torn flanks, wandered into barnyards in the\r\n  vicinity. The total number lost must have been heavy.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the Southwest sheep growers have estimated their losses\r\nfrom wild animals as equal to 20 percent of the flock. The average loss\r\nreported from several States is 5 percent. In nearly all the States\r\nwest of the Mississippi the industry has declined in the past two\r\nyears, and one of the principal causes given is losses from coyotes.\r\nAt present the industry thrives only in sections where the local\r\nconditions permit the herding of sheep in large flocks--a system highly\r\ninjurious to the pasturage.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the wealth of any State could be materially\r\nincreased if it were possible everywhere to keep small flocks of sheep,\r\nFlocks increase rapidly under favorable conditions and good management,\r\nand the cost of keeping them is small when herders can be dispensed\r\nwith. The double product, wool and million, usually places the profit\r\nof handling them above that of cuttle or horses. The gains also come\r\noftener, since sheep mature in a year, while cattle and horse require\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nVernon Bailey, chief field naturalist of the Biological Survey, writing\r\nfrom Seguin, Tex., under date of November 8, 1904, says:\r\n\r\n  No sheep are kept in tins part of Texas, and in talking with several\r\n  intelligent farmers I find that the reason invariably given is the\r\n  abundance of coyotes. The region is occupied by small farms, mainly 80\r\n  to 500 acres, on which cotton, corn, sorghum, and vegetables are the\r\n  principal crops. There are few if any large stock ranches, but each\r\n  farm has its pastures for horses and cattle. These pastures are the\r\n  wild land covered with scattered mosquito, post oak, and patches of\r\n  chaparral and cactus. The native grasses are abundant and of excellent\r\n  quality, and in this mild climate furnish good feed throughout the\r\n  year. Many of the pastures are not half eaten down, and the dead and\r\n  dry vegetation becomes a nuisance. After harvest cattle and horses are\r\n  usually turned into cotton and grain fields, where they do good work\r\n  in cleaning up grass and weeds in the field and along the borders.\r\n  Still there is abundance of feed constantly going to waste, and a\r\n  small flock of sheep could be kept with great profit and no expense on\r\n  almost every farm.\r\n\r\n  Fifty to two hundred sheep on a farm would at once make this part\r\n  of Texas the most important woolgrowing section of the State.\r\n  Other advantages to be gained would be keeping down the cactus and\r\n  chaparral, which are inclined to spread and occupy much of the ground,\r\n  keeping the edges of pastures and fields cleaned up so that they would\r\n  not harbor a host of predaceous insects and rodents in close proximity\r\n  to growing crops, and furnishing to the farmers and small towns a\r\n  supply of fresh meat other than chicken. In this warm climate beef\r\n  is rarely available, except in the larger towns. The advantages of\r\n  introducing sheep into this part of the country are acknowledged by\r\n  the farmers, and there seems to be no reason why it has not been done,\r\n  except that coyotes are common, large, and fond of mutton.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions prevail in many parts of the West and over large\r\nareas. While a dozen years ago the low price of wool was an important\r\nfactor in causing farmers to abandon sheep raising, in recent years the\r\nprices have been excellent. Fine washed wool was quoted in the New York\r\nmarket February 6, 1905, at 32.35 cents per pound and in St. Louis on\r\nthe same date at 40.41 cents per pound. The price of tub-washed wool\r\nat St. Louis was at no time during 1904 less than 30 cents per pound.\r\nUnwashed wool ranged from 15 to 31 cents during most of the year. Yet\r\nthe number of sheep in the United States is now decreasing. Montana,\r\nwith an area of 146,000 square miles, leads the States in the number\r\nof sheep kept, which is 5,638,957.[E] England, with an area of 50,867\r\nsquare miles, has about five times as many as Montana. In Montana sheep\r\nare herded in immense flocks; in England every landowner and farmer\r\nkeeps a small flock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Crop Reporter, U. S. Dept. Agric. February, 1905.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the discouraging condition of the sheep industry\r\nin the United States is not due to a lack of favorable climate nor to\r\nthe absence of suitable pasturage. Neither is it due to low prices of\r\nwool and mutton. Indeed, in our markets mutton is coming to be more and\r\nmore in favor, and this growing demand may be one of the causes for\r\nthe present drain upon the flocks and the decrease in their numbers;\r\nbut the chief discouragement of the industry undoubtedly lies in the\r\ndepredations of worthless dogs and coyotes.\r\n\r\nThe dog question is a serious one, especially in thickly settled\r\nparts of the country, but the evil is best remedied by a resort to\r\ntaxation. The tax on dogs should be sufficiently high to put most of\r\nthe worthless ones out of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF DESTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coyote problem is a serious one. Various methods of dealing with\r\nit have been in vogue since coyotes first began to like mutton. None\r\nof the methods have been entirely satisfactory, and some are signal\r\nfailures. All of them combined have resulted in a partial check on the\r\nincrease of coyotes in most parts of their range. Poison has probably\r\nkilled the greatest number of adult animals, and in some parts of\r\nMexico has almost destroyed some of the species, but no such success\r\nhas attended its use in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING.\r\n\r\nStrychnine has always been a favorite weapon of hunters for wolf pelts\r\nand bounties. A half century ago hunters on the prairies killed the\r\nbuffalo for its pelt, and added to their income by killing the wolves\r\nthat followed the daily slaughter. A little strychnine inserted in the\r\nskinned carcass of a buffalo enabled them to secure many pelts of the\r\ngray wolf and occasionally one of the coyote; but not often the latter:\r\nhe was regarded as much too shrewd to be taken by ordinary methods of\r\npoisoning. Resides, the pelt was small and not sufficiently valuable in\r\ncomparison to warrant special efforts to secure it. Even in 1819 Thomas\r\nSay, who first gave a scientific name to a coyote, found this animal\r\nmore abundant than the gray wolf.[F] Yet the number killed for their\r\npelts has never been great.\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, p. 168, 1823.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the coyote's shrewdness in avoiding poisoned\r\nbails, a farmer in Oklahoma gave the writer the following experience:\r\nAfter butchering some hogs he poisoned a hogskin and left it with other\r\noffal for a coyote that nightly prowled about his premises. In the\r\nmorning everything but the poisoned skin had been cleared away. He left\r\nit two more nights, but it remained untouched. Thinking that the animal\r\nwould not eat the poisoned bait, he buried it. That night the coyote\r\ndug up the pigskin and ate it, falling a victim to its deadly contents.\r\nSince then the farmer says he has never failed to poison coyotes when\r\nhe buries the bait.\r\n\r\nAnother method of poisoning coyotes is to insert the strychnine in\r\nsmall chunks of meat that can be easily swallowed. Success by this\r\nmethod depends largely upon the condition of the animal as regards\r\nhunger, and may be helped by making what is known as a 'drag' in the\r\nneighborhood of the bait. A small animal--a bleeding dead rabbit is\r\ngood--is dragged over the prairie and the morsels of bail left at\r\nintervals along the 'drag.' Two days previous to a general coyote hunt\r\nin Oklahoma a steer badly affected by 'lumpy jaw' was killed, opened,\r\nand left in the middle of the area to be hunted. During the first night\r\ncoyotes howled all night in the vicinity of the carcass, but failed to\r\ntouch it. The second day a hind quarter was separated from the carcass\r\nand dragged in a circuit of a mile or two, the drag coming hack to the\r\ncarcass. During the following night the coyotes picked the bones of the\r\ncarcass hare. Thus gorged with beef, they were in a condition favorable\r\nfor their slaughter in the drive of the following day.\r\n\r\nIn the use of strychnine for wolves, the dry crystals of strychnia\r\nsulphate are generally preferred. They should be inserted in the\r\nbait with a knife blade, and the meat should be handled as little as\r\npossible. It should be remembered that if precautions are not taken\r\nthere is a greater probability of killing dogs than wolves. The entire\r\nneighborhood should know of the intended attempt, and all valuable dogs\r\nshould be confined until the operation is finished and uneaten baits\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING.\r\n\r\nCoyotes are not easily trapped. Some skill and a good knowledge\r\nof their habits are requisites for success. They travel in rather\r\nwell-defined paths and usually hunt against the wind. Having a keen\r\nsense of smell, they easily detect the tracks of man, and if they have\r\nhad previous experience of traps or guns they are suspicious of danger.\r\nIn the wildest parts of the country remote from settlement they are\r\nmore readily trapped. The chances for successful trapping decrease with\r\ntheir familiarity with man, so that there is little probability that\r\nthe process will ever have much effect on their numbers.\r\n\r\nThe writer knows a Kansas trapper who is quite successful in capturing\r\ncoyotes in a rather thickly settled part of that State. He steel traps\r\nand sets them along hedges in places where the animals are accustomed\r\nto pass through openings. No bait is used and the trap is partly\r\nconcealed by dead leaves or grasses. He claims that both the direction\r\nof the wind and of the animal as it approaches the opening have much to\r\ndo with the chance for success.\r\n\r\nField naturalists of the Biological Survey usually have experienced\r\nlittle difficulty in securing coyotes in traps. A No. 3 steel trap\r\nis generally used. A suitable place is selected along a narrow path\r\nor trail and the trap sunk in the ground level with the surface\r\nand concealed with fine grass, leaves, or other material that will\r\nharmonize with the surroundings. At the same time care is taken that\r\nthe material used shall leave the jaws of the trap free to spring clear\r\nof the covering.\r\n\r\nThe trap should be fastened to a bush or stake, or if these are not\r\navailable, to a clog. For the last a pole lying on the ground is\r\nbest, since it may be utilized without moving it or disturbing the\r\nsurroundings. If the trap is anchored to a bush or small tree the chain\r\nmust be securely fastened with snap or wire. A stout stake over which\r\nthe ring will not slip, driven out of sight into the ground, is better.\r\nEvery part of the trap and chain is covered, and the ground left in as\r\nnatural and undisturbed condition as possible.\r\n\r\nAny kind of fresh meat will do for bait--rabbits and other small\r\nrodents are often used, but larger baits seem to be more attractive.\r\nit is also of advantage after setting the trap to make a 'drag' of\r\nthe bait for a quarter to a half mile, at the end of a rope from the\r\nsaddle horn, and finally to fasten it to a bush or stake close to the\r\ntrap, or cut it in bits and scatter all around the trap so that not all\r\ncan be reached by the coyote without walking over the trap. The skill\r\nof the trapper and the situation of the trap will determine the best\r\narrangement. The suspicion of the coyote is lessened apparently after\r\nfollowing the bloody trail of a well-planned drag.\r\n\r\nBefore setting the traps many trappers rub their feet and hands on a\r\nskin or some strong-smelling meat or carcass to conceal the human odor.\r\nOil of anise or rhodium is sometimes used for the same purpose. Any\r\nstrong odor is likely to attract the attention of the coyote and allay\r\nsuspicion. Care must be taken not to spit on the ground or kneel or\r\nthrow down any clothing in the vicinity of the trap. A good plan is to\r\nset a line of traps and leave them for a day or two, and then go the\r\nrounds with a horse and drag, and bait the traps without dismounting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING.\r\n\r\nMany ranchmen find dogs an efficient help in guarding against coyote\r\ndepredations. For this purpose the small varieties are useless, since\r\nthe coyotes do not fear them. Beagles and larger foxhounds are too\r\nslow. Staghounds, Russian wolfhounds, greyhounds, and their crosses\r\nare to be preferred: and at least three are needed to successfully\r\nchase and safely kill a coyote. These dogs soon learn to hunt wolves,\r\nand are seldom known to harm sheep. Ranches on which they are kept are\r\ncomparatively free from depredations of wild animals, while others\r\nwithin a few miles are by do means exempt. Of course, the keeping of\r\nthese dogs on small farms would hardly be practicable.\r\n\r\nIn the open country where there are few fences, hunting the coyote\r\nwith horse and dogs is an exciting sport. Fox chasing, although less\r\nmeritorious in purpose, may have some advantages as sport, because\r\nthe quarry is not always in sight and the skill of the hounds is\r\npitted against the cunning of the fox. In the chase of the wolf, as\r\nin coursing hares, the race is straight away and without cover; and\r\nwhen the quarry is overtaken the fight is won only because of the\r\noverpowering numbers of the pursuers. The ordinary greyhound can easily\r\novertake a coyote, but is usually unable to kill it alone.\r\n\r\nCoyote drives, in which an entire community engage, have become a\r\npopular feature of rural sport in some parts of the country. Such\r\ndrives have been held in Kansas, Colorado. Idaho. Oklahoma, and Texas;\r\nbut the methods employed depend largely on the local topography. The\r\nwriter was present at the second annual wolf hunt which took place\r\nNovember 24, 1904, in the large Pasture Reserve near Chattanooga, Okla.\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving morning the weather was perfect, and a large number\r\nof people from the surrounding country collected in the village of\r\nChattanooga. A little before noon the men who were to drive the wolves\r\nrode out of town and headed for their positions in the Pasture. As\r\nthere were less than 150 men, the area covered by the drive was not\r\nso large as had been planned. The drivers were separated into three\r\ndivisions. The south division, which was under the immediate charge of\r\nthe commander of the hunt, Mr. J. W. Williams, proceeded about 7 miles\r\nsouth of Chattanooga. The eastern and the western divisions were under\r\nthe charge of other captains and had their stations about 4 miles to\r\nthe southeast and southwest of the town. The area covered by the drive\r\nwas somewhat over 6 miles square.\r\n\r\nOn the north side were the spectators, occupying a position about a\r\nmile and a half from the town and extending over nearly 2 miles of\r\nfront, from which the land sloped gently to the south. The spectators\r\ncame from town in every sort of farm vehicle and numbered fully 500.\r\n\r\nIn front of the line of vehicles some 50 men on horseback held in\r\nreserve nearly 100 dogs, mostly greyhounds. Guns of all kinds were\r\nruled out of the final 'round-up,' and only lariats, dogs, and clubs\r\nwere permitted as weapons.\r\n\r\nThe line of spectators was formed at 1 o'clock, but it was fully an\r\nhour before the driving divisions were heard or seen. In the south a\r\nbeautiful mirage occupied the distant valley a white sheet of water\r\nbordered by trees. It was on the surface of this mimic lake that we\r\nfirst saw the riders galloping by twos. Soon after we faintly heard\r\ntheir distant shouts; and when the shouts began to come clearer, the\r\ncoyotes also came up the valley by ones and twos, and at length by\r\nthrees and fours before the swiftly moving horsemen.\r\n\r\nWhen the first wolf was still a half mile distant, the dogs were\r\nreleased and riders and dogs dashed to the front to head off the\r\nanimals. Hemmed in in front and rear, they broke to the right and to\r\nthe left, and many made good their escape through the thinner lines of\r\nthe east and the west divisions.\r\n\r\nThe sport was fast and furious for a short time, but when a little\r\nLater the dead and captured wolves were brought together in the town,\r\nthey were found to number only eleven in all. Two of them were roped\r\nby cowboys during the drive and killed with pistols. Two were dragged\r\nto death at the end of lariats. Seven were caught by the dogs in the\r\nround-up, and two of these were brought in alive. Many escaped, but it\r\nis impossible to estimate the number.\r\n\r\nSuch hunts have considerable influence in decreasing the number of\r\ncoyotes and also afford an agreeable break in the monotony of frontier\r\nlife. Their purpose, however, is never admitted to be that of sport,\r\nbut to kill coyotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNTIES.\r\n\r\nActivity in the warfare against the coyote has been considerably\r\nstimulated by the payment of bounties from the public treasury of the\r\nStates and counties. Nearly all the States in which coyotes occur have\r\nbeen for years maintaining such bounty systems. In some parts of the\r\nWest these are supplemented by rewards from stock associations or ranch\r\nowners. The bounties from public funds have ranged from 25 cents to $5\r\nfor each animal killed, but supplementary payments sometimes make them\r\nas high as $15.\r\n\r\nThe subject of bounties in general has been already discussed by Dr.\r\nT. S. Palmer, of the Biological Survey.[G] Doctor Palmer refers to the\r\nCalifornia coyote act of 1891, which was practically in force only\r\neighteen months, but which cost the State $187,485. As the bounty was\r\n$5 per scalp, this represented the destruction of 37,493 coyotes.\r\nKansas, with a county bounty of $1 per animal, succeeds in destroying\r\nabout 20,000 each year. In addition to the bounty, the pelt of an adult\r\ncoyote is worth from 50 cents to $1.50, according to its condition.\r\nHowever, most of the killing is accomplished in spring, when the female\r\nand her young are dug out of dens and the pelage of the adults is not\r\nin prime condition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Extermination of Noxious Animals by Bounties. Yearbook U.\r\nS. Dept of Agr., 1896, pp. 55-68.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Palmer rightly concludes that in practice bounties for the\r\ndestruction of noxious animals, paid from public funds, are usually\r\nobjectionable. Probably those on wolves and coyotes have been more\r\nnearly justified than those on any other animals. While it is certain\r\nthat the larger wolves have greatly diminished in numbers under the\r\nsystem, forces far more potent than mere rewards have operated against\r\nthem. Chief of these has been the encroachment of civilization. Coyotes\r\nhave in some places held their ground under bounties, and possibly\r\nmight have been held in check nearly as well under the operation of the\r\nsame forces that helped to decimate the timber wolves. But the observed\r\neffect on the coyote of contact with settlements hardly justifies such\r\na conclusion. That the bounties in some places have done effective\r\nwork is undoubted; the question is as to whether the results have been\r\ncommensurate with the expenditures. However, the principal objection to\r\nbounties is the ethical one, that they lead to fraudulent practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST COYOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the various means of destroying coyotes, and the\r\nevident futility, thus far, of all of them combined to completely check\r\nthe increase of the species, leads naturally to the consideration\r\nof means of preventing their depredations. Could domestic animals\r\nbe entirely protected, the coyotes would return to their original\r\nbeneficial occupation as scavengers and destroyers of noxious rodents.\r\n\r\nThe plan that at once suggests itself is that of fencing against them.\r\nThis means of protection from wild animals has been long in vogue in\r\nthe Australian colonies and in South Africa. In Australia rabbits,\r\ndingoes, and some species of kangaroos are successfully kept out of\r\npastures and crops by the use of wire nettings. In Cape Colony jackals,\r\nparticularly the red jackal (_Canis mesomelas_), are a great hindrance\r\nto sheep and ostrich farming, and the success attending the use of wire\r\nnetting in Australia led to the introduction of similar fencing into\r\nSouth Africa. The result has been highly gratifying. While the cost of\r\nthe fencing is high, the advantages from its use have been regarded as\r\nmore than compensating for the outlay. Mr. T. T. Hoole, president of\r\nthe Upper Albany (Cape Colony) Farmer's Association, in a paper read\r\nat a meeting of that society[H] gives details of ten years' experience\r\nwith jackal-proof fencing. Among its advantages to sheep growers he\r\nnames:\r\n\r\n  1. Decreased cost of herding.\r\n\r\n  2. Increased value of the wool, about 3 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n  3. Increased number of lambs reared.\r\n\r\n  4. Increased value, owing to early maturity and condition of stock.\r\n\r\n  5. Less liability to contagion from scab.\r\n\r\n  6. Reduced death rate.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional security of the flock.\r\n\r\n  8. Improved condition of pasturage as against deterioration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Agr. Jour. Cape of Good Hope, vol. 25, pp. 560-563, 1904.]\r\n\r\nThe last item alone he regards as more than repaying the entire cost\r\nof erection. Under the system of herding on the open veldt it becomes\r\nnecessary to protect from wild animals by driving the sheep to a\r\nkraal for the night. In the vicinity of the kraal the ground is soon\r\ntrodden bare, and deep parallel paths are worn in the surface. In a\r\nfew years the torrential rains wash the paths into what are called\r\n'sluits'--similar to the 'arroyos' of our own Southwest.\r\n\r\nIn the western part of the United States the practice of keeping sheep\r\nin vast herds has resulted in much deterioration of the ranges, due to\r\novercrowding, and the cost of herding has absorbed much of the profits\r\nof sheep raising. The process of withdrawing lands for homesteads and\r\nthe various reservations has diminished the free range and increased\r\nthe crowding, until flock owners for their own protection have been\r\ncompelled to purchase lands for range purposes. The day of free\r\npasturage on public lands is fast passing, and with private ownership\r\nof ranges, fencing must be resorted to to confine the flocks. The\r\nadditional expenditure necessary to make the fences proof against\r\ncoyotes would be inconsiderable when all the advantages are properly\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATIONS CONCERNING COYOTE-PROOF FENCING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey has undertaken an investigation of the\r\nfeasibility of successfully fencing against the coyote. If a\r\ncoyote-proof fence of sufficient cheapness and durability to be\r\npracticable can be brought into general use for pasturage, there is\r\nno reason why the sheep industry in the west should not be revived\r\nand greatly extended. If such a fence should at the same time prove\r\nefficient against dogs, the benefit would extend to the whole country\r\nand result in an enormous increase of the productive resources of our\r\nfarms. A coyote-proof fence would prove valuable, even if its use were\r\nrestricted to corrals and small pastures for ewes during the lambing\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe writer, under instruction from the Chief of the Biological Survey,\r\nspent several weeks in the field during October and November, 1904,\r\nmaking such investigations as were possible during the limited time\r\nat his disposal. For the purpose of testing the ability of coyotes to\r\npass over or through fences a unique experiment was made. The place\r\nselected was Chattanooga, Comanche County, Okla. South of the town lies\r\nthe great Pasture Reserve, a large area practically without fences to\r\ninterfere with the chasing of wolves. Since coyotes were abundant and\r\nthe cowboys skilled in their chase, it was not difficult to procure the\r\nneeded animals in an uninjured condition.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was made with all the forms of fence that could possibly\r\nbe obtained or built with the limited resources of a new country. A\r\nlong lane was first built, with sides 7 feet high, made with poultry\r\nnetting of a small mesh. Fourteen cross fences of heights from 30 to 66\r\ninches and of various designs were built at intervals along the lane.\r\nThey were arranged so that the coyotes, introduced at one end of the\r\nlane, should have presented to them gradually increasing difficulty in\r\npassing the fences. Two coyotes were released singly into the lane, and\r\ntheir progress and methods of passing the cross fences were carefully\r\nnoted. One was badly frightened by the presence and noise of dogs and\r\nmen, but the experiment with the other was not made in public.\r\n\r\nThe coyotes ran with their noses close to the ground and seemed to have\r\nno knowledge of jumping. Neither of them succeeded in getting over a\r\nfence more than 36 Inches in height. The method was one of climbing,\r\nassisted by the hind feet, rather than of jumping. All attempts to pass\r\nthe obstructions began with efforts to get the muzzle through openings.\r\nIf the entire head could be thrust through and there was enough room\r\nfor the shoulders to spread out laterally, the whole wolf was able to\r\nfollow. Both went through rectangular openings, 5 by 12 inches and 5 by\r\n8 inches, but the larger animal failed to pass a mesh 5 by 6 inches.\r\nThe smaller animal went through an opening 4 by 12 inches and another\r\n5 by 6 inches. Had these openings been triangular in form the animal\r\ncould not have passed through.\r\n\r\nThe following conclusions were drawn from the experiments:\r\n\r\n1. Prairie coyotes will not willingly jump over a fence above 30 inches\r\nin height.\r\n\r\n2. They will readily climb over fences built of horizontal rails or\r\ncrossbars, especially in order to escape from captivity.\r\n\r\n3. Barbed wires do not deter them from crawling through a fence to\r\nescape. Whether they would go through a closely built barbed wire fence\r\nto attack sheep or poultry is still an open question.\r\n\r\n4. Woven wire fences should have meshes, when rectangular, less than 6\r\nby 6 inches to keep out coyotes. For such fences triangular meshes are\r\nmuch better than square ones.\r\n\r\n5. In fencing against coyotes with woven fences care must be used to\r\nsee that there are no openings at the ground through which the animals\r\ncan force themselves, since they are more likely to crawl under a fence\r\nthan jump over it.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments the animals, under some excitement, were attempting\r\nto escape from confinement. In the judgment of the writer, the\r\nexperiments are insufficient to determine what a coyote would do if the\r\nconditions were reversed and, impelled only by the stimulus of hunger,\r\nhe were attempting to enter an inclosure built of these fences. The\r\nbarriers would surely be far more formidable. Experiments with certain\r\ntypes of fence, with sheep inclosed within them, and in a country\r\nwith wolves as plentiful as they are at Chattanooga, would be far more\r\nconclusive in establishing a safe basis for practical recommendations\r\nto farmers.\r\n\r\nThe writer interviewed a number of farmers in Kansas who have had\r\nexperience with poultry and farm animals in coyote-infested country.\r\nSeveral of them had for some years been using for corrals and small\r\npastures woven wire fences, and had found those from 57 to 60 inches\r\nhigh entirely coyote-proof. These fences have triangular meshes and\r\nare of sufficient weight to be suitable for all kinds of stock. Such\r\na fence, if set with the lower edge on the ground and anchored down\r\nwhere necessary, can safely be recommended as coyote-proof. Their cost,\r\nhowever, is possibly too great to bring them into general use for sheep\r\npastures. Where land is valuable and pastures of the best, they will\r\nprove economical, for they have the merit of being both dog-proof and\r\ncoyote-proof. Dogs, both large and small, that by chance get inside the\r\ninclosures are unable to get out, and have to be let out by the gate.\r\n\r\nBetween these rather expensive fences and the cheapest form that may\r\nbe found efficient many grades may exist. In experiments to determine\r\nthe efficiency of any form it is necessary to consider the familiarity\r\nof the animals with fences in general. In a new country a very simple\r\nfence might be ample at first to keep out wolves, but ultimately would\r\nprove insufficient.\r\n\r\nMr. T. T. Hoole, of Cape Colony, Africa, in the paper already quoted,\r\ngives the following experience in determining upon a jackal-proof fence:\r\n\r\n  My first importation of 2 foot 6 inch netting served its purpose for\r\n  a year or more, when I found the jackals as troublesome as over.\r\n  The addition of a single barbed wire assisted for a time: but after\r\n  some years of experience and comparing notes. I found that nothing\r\n  short of a 3-foot netting and four barbed wires would be effective.\r\n  I have given the above particulars of my experience as a warning to\r\n  the inexperienced, that half measures are simply a waste of money and\r\n  that badly erected fences, although effective for a time, will end in\r\n  disappointment and failure.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoole has 18 miles of the fence just described, while a neighboring\r\nstockman has 45 miles built. The cost, including labor, when built of\r\nthe host material--sneezewood posts and kangaroo netting--was estimated\r\nat £106 per mile--about $500. This fence was designed for ostriches,\r\ncattle, springboks, and sheep: a fence intended for sheep alone could\r\nbe built for less. Materials and labor are both much more expensive\r\nthan in the United States. A fence similar to that described by Mr.\r\nHoole could be built in most parts of the West for about $200 to $250\r\nper mile.\r\n\r\nA writer in the Nor' West Farmer states that when he first began\r\nsheep raising in Manitoba a 2-strand barbed wire fence was a complete\r\nbarrier to the coyotes, but that in less than two years they became\r\nused to it and would go under or between the wires without hesitation.\r\nMore strands were added without effect, until a woven wire fence was\r\nadopted, which proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa three types of fence have been in use for protection\r\nagainst jackals, and each has advocates among the farmers. The cheapest\r\nis built of strands of barbed wire placed close together and stayed at\r\nintervals by light strips of wood fastened to the wires by staples.\r\nIn the second form the staying is done by light, smooth wire woven in\r\nby machinery, involving more labor in the building. The third type is\r\nthat recommended by Mr. Hoole. It is more expensive, but seems always\r\nto have stood the test of experience. The others have not always been\r\nsatisfactory, but their advocates claim that the fault has been in\r\nconstruction and not in design. The jackals have entered the inclosures\r\nthrough openings at the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Clarke, of Laytonville, Mendocino County. Cal., has for\r\nseveral years succeeded in fencing coyotes from his sheep range. In a\r\nletter to the Chief of the Biological Survey, dated March 1, 1905, he\r\ndescribes the fence and relates his experience:\r\n\r\n  The fence, inclosing nearly 4,000 acres, consists of redwood pickets\r\n  6 feet long driven into the ground 1 foot and leaving spaces or\r\n  cracks not over 4 inches wide; posts 8 feet long and driven 2 feet,\r\n  projecting 1 foot above the pickets; two barbed wires stapled to the\r\n  posts 5 inches above the pickets and the same distance apart. These\r\n  should be on the outside of the posts. The pickets are driven evenly\r\n  by using a slat as a guide at the bottom and a line at the top. One\r\n  barbed wire is placed at the bottom on the outside to prevent digging.\r\n  The pickets are fastened to a No. 9 cable wire with a No. 13 wrapping\r\n  wire. The posts are set 12 feet apart, or less, according to the\r\n  surface--at top and bottom of each rise or indentation.\r\n\r\n  Where gulches or small streams are crossed boxes and gates are put in.\r\n  Where larger streams are encountered a dam is first put in and the\r\n  gate so swung as to rest on or against the dam head in the dry season.\r\n\r\n  The cost of construction varied from $320 to $400 per mile. Galvanized\r\n  wire was used, and of the barbed the thickest-set four-pointed wire\r\n  obtainable. If four-point wire could be had, with sharp points set not\r\n  over 2 inches apart, the top wire might be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n  While this fence was begun in 1897, it was net finished until three\r\n  years ago. It was partly experimental at first, and at the end of\r\n  the second year only that portion of the range used for lambing was\r\n  inclosed with a coyote-proof fence. We do not know that a coyote has\r\n  ever scaled or jumped it. A very large coyote that got in through an\r\n  accidentally 'propped' floodgate, though chased by dogs all day, could\r\n  not be made to jump out, even when cornered. Considering the steep,\r\n  wild, and broken nature of the country, with several 'slides' in the\r\n  fence that could not be avoided when building, and which move and\r\n  displace the fence during hard storms, it is net surprising that a few\r\n  coyotes have gotten in. Fortunately, partition fences have aided in\r\n  the capture of those before much damage was done. Two obstacles are\r\n  encountered in keeping up this fence--trespassers, who cut or break a\r\n  picket to get through, and slides.\r\n\r\n  Coyotes are very persistent, and when they see young lambs on the\r\n  opposite side will follow the fence for miles, trying to find a hole.\r\n  * * * None have gotten in this season.\r\n\r\n  When we began to fence against them the coyotes wore literally driving\r\n  sheep out of the country. * * * Horses and cattle have taken their\r\n  places, but return less than half the profit sheep did prior to the\r\n  coyote's inroads. Excessive rains in winter and irregularity of\r\n  landscape preclude the practicability of close herding. With us it was\r\n  either abandon sheep or fence the pest out. Fortunately we adopted the\r\n  latter.\r\n\r\nWhile the fence used by Mr. Clarke is expensive, the complete success\r\nof his experiment is of much interest. In most parts of the West woven\r\nwire would be cheaper than pickets and would require less labor in its\r\nerection. Where the land is as uneven as that just described, the use\r\nof woven wire may be impracticable.\r\n\r\nMr. D. W. Hilderbrand, of California, who has built coyote fences for\r\nranchmen in the San Joaquin Valley, recommends a 3-inch mesh woven wire\r\nfence 36 to 40 inches in height, with two barbed wires on top, 5½\r\ninches apart, and one at the bottom. He recommends that the posts be\r\nset 20 to 30 feet apart.\r\n\r\nFrom data now available it seems reasonably certain that a fence\r\nconstructed of woven wire with a triangular mesh not over 6 inches\r\nacross, and of a height of 28 to 42 inches, supplemented by two or\r\nthree tightly stretched barbed wires, would prove to be coyote-proof.\r\nIt is difficult to make exact estimates of the cost. Woven fences\r\ndiffer in weight, price, and durability, and freight charges on\r\nmaterials depend on the distance from distributing points. The cost\r\nof posts and labor varies much. An estimate based on so many variable\r\nfactors is of little value, but an average of $200 per mile would\r\nprobably allow the use of the best materials.\r\n\r\nFurther experiments with wire fences will be made by the Biological\r\nSurvey in cooperation with sheep growers in the West, and the results\r\nwill be given to the public as early as practicable. The matter\r\nis one of great economic importance, and the Survey will welcome\r\ncorrespondence with persons interested in the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total number of coyotes in the table on page 10 was changed to\r\nmatch the sum of the numbers in the table.",
