H. Storms, Assistant in the Field.\r\n\r\nThe mining industry in this county is not as extensive as that of some\r\nof the neighboring counties, but there are mines in Los Angeles County\r\nof unquestioned value, and others which have a prospective value,\r\ndependent to a great extent upon the success achieved in working certain\r\nbase ores, which occur in comparative abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE KELSEY MINE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting mines in the county is located in the rugged\r\nmountains about 8 miles from the town of Azusa, in the San Gabriel\r\nCañon. It is commonly known as the Kelsey Mine, and has become famous as\r\na producer of silver ore of fabulous richness.\r\n\r\nThe country is made up almost entirely of metamorphic rocks, having\r\nschistose, gneissoid, and massive structure. Both hornblende and mica\r\noccur in these rocks abundantly, the former being frequently altered to\r\nchlorite, or by further change to epidote. Dikes of porphyritic rock\r\nhave been intruded into the crystalline schists. In the immediate\r\nvicinity of the Kelsey vein are intrusions of a dark green, much\r\ndecomposed, and shattered rock, probably diorite. Faults, great and\r\nsmall, are numerous throughout the region. Within a few hundred feet of\r\nthe mine is a great fault, which may be plainly seen cutting the\r\nmountain. The displacement must reach many hundreds of feet. It has\r\nresulted in bringing in contact on a horizontal plane rocks of entirely\r\ndifferent character. On the south side of the fault the rocks are made\r\nup of quite regularly bedded micaceous sandstones, more or less\r\nschistose, and having a prevailing buff or light gray color. These rocks\r\ndip east at an angle of 20° to 30°. On the north side of the fault the\r\nrocks are harder, of a dark gray color, and containing considerable\r\nhornblende. These rocks are more gneissoid and massive than schistose.\r\nThe dip is much less regular than on the south side of the displacement.\r\nLarge, lenticular masses of quartzose and feldspathic rock are of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the hornblende gneiss, evidently the result of\r\nthe segregation of the contained minerals. On the whole there is much\r\nmore evidence of the disturbance on the north side of the fault than on\r\nthe south side. It is in this area of greatly disturbed strata that the\r\nKelsey vein has formed.\r\n\r\nThe vein is of the fissure type and occupies the line of a fault plane,\r\nthat at first, perhaps, was a mere crack, but which has become enlarged\r\nby the movement upon themselves of the rock masses forming the walls,\r\nresulting in a grinding and crushing of the rocks by the attrition and\r\npressure incident to this movement. Into this crevice mineral waters\r\nfound their way, carrying in solution the minerals now constituting the\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _FAULTING AND TORSION\r\n    OF THE\r\n    KELSEY VEIN_]\r\n\r\n_The Ore._—The silver occurs as native and as glance (argentite),\r\npossibly partly as chloride and in combinations with sulphur, cobalt,\r\nand arsenic. The associated minerals are cobalt bloom (erythrite), a\r\nhydrous cobalt arsenate, nickel arsenate (annabergite), carbonate and\r\nsilicate of copper (chrysocolla), iron oxide, and black oxide of\r\nmanganese in a gangue of baryta (heavy spar), with calcite (lime spar)\r\nand some quartz. A clay selvage usually separates the vein material from\r\nthe wall, this feature being well developed in places on the foot wall\r\nside, as though open crevices had occurred and the finely divided\r\nmaterial which was carried by the percolating waters had found a resting\r\nplace when an open space was reached, the absence of any current\r\npermitting the material to settle.\r\n\r\nThe clay may have been derived in part from the decomposition of the\r\noverhanging wall, the fine silt settling by gravity on the foot wall\r\nside of the vein. In places a soft, clayey gouge constitutes the entire\r\nvein filling, suggesting that the clay selvage and gouge are also partly\r\ndue to the attrition of the walls. Galena occurs sparingly in small\r\ndisseminated crystals, but the occurrence is so infrequent as to be\r\nscarcely worth mentioning. In width the crevice varies from a thin seam\r\nto over 4 feet. A banded structure is not uncommon in the vein.\r\n\r\nThe rocks inclosing the vein differ in various parts of the mine. A much\r\ndecomposed rock, containing iron in the form of carbonate, occurs\r\nfrequently, while a chloritic, more or less schistose, sometimes\r\nmassive, rock, also plays an important part in this connection. The dike\r\nof dark basic rock, resembling diorite, previously referred to, is\r\nexposed at numerous places throughout the workings, often in contact\r\nwith the vein, or close to it. Since its formation the Kelsey vein has\r\nbeen subjected to severe torsion, which has resulted in abrupt fracture\r\nand displacement. To me it seemed very probable that the vein was the\r\nresult of chemical precipitation, and no doubt, to some extent, the\r\nreplacement of country rock along the line of a fissure or fault plane;\r\nthat subsequent to the filling in of the vein the region was subjected\r\nto further violent disturbances, which fractured the rocks along an east\r\nand west course, and causing the turning of a large mass of rock\r\nformation lying south of this fault to the west. The vein being included\r\nin the general movement, was deflected from its natural course north and\r\nsouth. I came to these conclusions from close observations taken along\r\nthe surface of the ground on the course of the vein, and in all\r\naccessible underground workings.\r\n\r\nMost of the ore extracted from these workings has been high grade,\r\nusually running over $200 per ton, small lots often assaying several\r\nthousand ounces. The property, at the time of my visit last spring, was\r\nunder the management of Dr. Endlich, E.M. This gentleman was making\r\nevery effort to systematically open and recover a vein that had been as\r\nsystematically and outrageously gouged. The workings were in bad\r\ncondition and at some points were positively dangerous. The mine was\r\ngradually assuming an improved appearance and promised to yield better\r\nreturns than ever before. A good mill has been erected at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, in the San Gabriel Cañon, where a large stream of water\r\nflows during the entire year. An office, boarding house, stables,\r\ncorrals, etc., had been built for the accommodation of men and animals.\r\nIn addition to this I found a complete assay office and chemical\r\nlaboratory, and here Dr. Endlich was experimenting with the rich cobalt\r\nand nickel ores. As a result of his labors in this direction he\r\nexhibited several bars of cobalt speiss containing a very high value in\r\nsilver. The assorted ore contains from 7 to 15 per cent in cobalt, 2 to\r\n3 per cent nickel, and from 1,000 to 1,400 ounces silver per ton.\r\n\r\nDr. Endlich thus describes his methods: “The ore is crushed through a\r\ntwenty-mesh sieve, mixed with sufficient litharge to produce an 8 per\r\ncent charge, and enough borax is added to take up the gangue (quartz,\r\nheavy spar, carbonate of lime, magnesia, and iron). Carbonate of soda\r\nand flour are mixed with the charge. If the percentage of arsenic in the\r\nore is sufficiently high to produce speiss none is added; otherwise some\r\nmetallic arsenic is mixed in. Some sulphides in the ore and reduced\r\nsulphur from the heavy spar are utilized to produce mattes. The mixture\r\nis melted in large Dixon crucibles; the slag poured off, and the\r\nmetallic product allowed to cool. The bars obtained are composed of\r\nlead, silver, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, and sulphur, principally; the\r\nlead being in the form of sulphide, the cobalt and nickel in the form of\r\narsenides. The bars contained from 4,500 to 7,000 ounces silver per ton.\r\nThe slag contained a trace of silver, and averaged about 0.75 per cent\r\ncobalt, which can be worked over by arsenizing, if desired, and the\r\ncobalt obtained in the resulting speiss.”\r\n\r\nAt this writing about 560 pounds of ore has been treated in this way and\r\nthe product shipped to Balbach’s works in Newark, N. J., for refining.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE VICTORIA MINES.\r\n\r\nThis property is situated but a short distance from the Kelsey Mine. The\r\nVictoria Mine was operated under English management for an English\r\nsyndicate two or three years ago. Lately all operations have been\r\nsuspended. The property, whatever it may be worth, is a monument to\r\nmismanagement of the worst sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LORDSBURG STAMPEDE.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1892, the report went abroad that rich silver and\r\ngold-bearing rock had been found in the mountains north of Lordsburg, 28\r\nmiles east of the city of Los Angeles. So glowing were these stories\r\nthat a general stampede for the new mining field ensued. Farmers left\r\ntheir homes, merchants and clerks in some instances temporarily closed\r\ntheir stores to join in the rush to Lordsburg. Unfortunately the stories\r\nproved to be unfounded, and, after three weeks of excitement, all had\r\nleft the mines excepting a very few, who still had hopes of making a\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CEDAR MINING DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nFifty-five miles by rail northeast from Los Angeles, on the line of the\r\nS. P. R. R., is the Cedar Mining District, the principal village being\r\nabout the railway station called Acton. In the low hills about Acton,\r\nwhich rise out of the valley that skirts the northern base of the San\r\nGabriel range of mountains, are located the gold mines which have been\r\nworked for many years by Mexicans and Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE RED ROVER.\r\n\r\nThis is the name of the principal mine in the district. It was located\r\nand worked many years since by Mexicans, but has during the past eight\r\nor ten years been in the hands of Americans. The vein strikes northwest\r\nand southeast, dipping to the southwest at an angle of 50° from the\r\nhorizon. The rock is a white, fine-grained, saccharoidal quartz, showing\r\nin places bluish bands. It contains free gold in variable amount, with\r\nsome iron sulphuret. A very large amount of quartz has been stoped from\r\nthe vein and crushed in various mills.\r\n\r\nThe Red Rover is quite extensively developed, the new vertical shaft\r\nbeing down over 400 feet. The old inclined shaft, which is sunk on the\r\nvein, is down 220 feet. Several levels are run out from both these\r\nshafts, which are 200 feet apart. The new shaft was sunk between the\r\nmain vein and a spur which branches from it. A crosscut was run out\r\ntoward the spur, which is opened on the surface, but it was found it did\r\nnot go down. A crosscut was then run toward the main vein, which was\r\nfound intact, and a drift was carried in 60 feet on the vein.\r\n\r\nThe country rock is mostly massive metamorphic, very much broken and\r\nfaulted. Nearly every mine in the district has been displaced more or\r\nless by these faults. For some reason the Red Rover has been shut down\r\nfor some months past. It is understood that operations are to be\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE NEW YORK MINE\r\n\r\nIs situated within half a mile of the Red Rover, and is similar in\r\ncharacter. The quartz is said to mill $10 to $25 per ton. The owner has\r\na five-stamp mill, which is complete and does good work. The vein is\r\nfrom 1 to 3 feet in width. It has produced considerable bullion.\r\n\r\nOther mines of the vicinity are the Topeka, Union, Escondido, King of\r\nthe West, and Santa Clara, each of which has seen better days. The first\r\nthree mentioned have been large producers, but are worked down to the\r\nwater line, and a base ore proposition now faces the owners in the form\r\nof iron pyrites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN THE MAIN RANGE.\r\n\r\nUp in the main range of the San Gabriel Mountains, on the north slopes\r\nof this rugged chain, are located a number of veins, on which\r\nconsiderable work has been done. The veins are well defined, ranging\r\nfrom 1 to 4 feet in width, striking northwest and southeast, and dipping\r\nuniformly to the northeast at a high angle. All of these veins contain\r\ngold, but all quickly run into sulphurets. All the mines are idle at\r\npresent, but something brighter is hoped for. The sulphurets are said to\r\ncontain sufficient gold to make chlorination profitable. If this is\r\nactually the case there is an abundance of material to work upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LIPARITES AND TUFAS\r\n\r\nIn the region about Acton are many hills of liparite (quartz-bearing\r\ntrachyte) and tufa, which are identical with the rhyolites of the Calico\r\nregion—the same violet-brown, porphyritic liparite; the same pea-green\r\nand buff-colored tufas; the same conglomerate; in fact, an exact\r\nfacsimile of the Calico range. There are no great beds of sedimentary\r\nrock, however, and these liparite hills are comparatively small,\r\nisolated masses. As far as my knowledge goes ores of silver have never\r\nbeen found in these rocks in the Acton district. Careful prospecting may\r\npossibly discover such ores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PROSPECTS OF THE CAMP.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the gold mines of this district have been worked\r\nto the water line, almost without exception, what now remains to be done\r\nto perpetuate the prosperity of the district, is to concentrate the\r\nsulphurets, working them by chlorination in works built in the district.\r\nWood and water are both obtainable at moderate cost, and the\r\nsulphuretted ores of this district that contain but a very few dollars\r\nper ton should pay. The cost of mining, transportation, crushing, and\r\nconcentrating should not exceed, ordinarily, $5 per ton of quartz, and\r\nthe expense of treating the concentrates should be under $10 per ton.\r\nBase ores containing $10 per ton as it comes from the vein should\r\nrealize a profit in this district, and I am told that many of the mines\r\nproduce rock of a much better grade than that mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       SAN DIEGO COUNTY; ALSO ORANGE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    By Harold W. Fairbanks, F.G.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe topography of this region has been quite thoroughly described by W.\r\nA. Goodyear, in former reports of the State Mining Bureau. The structure\r\nof San Diego County is comparatively simple. Three main divisions might\r\nbe made: the desert on the east, the Peninsula range of crystalline\r\nrocks in the middle, and the nearly level mesa on the west. The\r\nPeninsula range is supposed to represent the southern continuation of\r\nthe Sierra Nevadas, but in just what relation it stands to the Sierras\r\nhas been a matter of dispute. The Peninsula range in San Diego County\r\nforms one main mountain chain. It maintains this simplicity of structure\r\nsouthward, forming the backbone of the peninsula of Lower California.\r\nNorthward it becomes broader and more complex, rising in the lofty San\r\nJacinto and San Bernardino ranges on the east, and the Santa Ana range\r\non the west, while the region between is filled with mountains and\r\nvalleys irregularly disposed.\r\n\r\nComplex as is the topography of this region, the geological problems,\r\nthough often difficult to solve, are quite simple. The higher mountains\r\nare formed wholly of ancient crystalline schists and massive rocks,\r\nrespecting the age of which a great diversity of opinion has existed;\r\nwhile the region bordering the coast consists of unaltered Cretaceous,\r\nTertiary, and Quaternary deposits.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very limited time given me to prepare my field notes for\r\nthe press, they will be given substantially as they were taken in the\r\nfield, without any attempt at systematic arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline rocks of San Diego County are varied in character, and\r\nof much interest. No opportunity has been given me to study the large\r\ncollection made, and the determinations given are simply the result of\r\nsuperficial examination, and are subject to correction.\r\n\r\nThe bay of San Diego is bordered on the east by gently sloping mesas of\r\nmodern Tertiary and Quaternary age. These unaltered strata are\r\ncharacteristic of the western slope of the Peninsula range through its\r\nwhole extent. They sometimes rise as high as 3,000 feet; though in San\r\nDiego County they do not exceed 1,500 feet. The upper portion of these\r\nbeds consists to a great extent of coarse, loosely cemented\r\nconglomerates. The rivers issue from the higher mountains through narrow\r\nvalleys or cañons, and have cut valleys, often quite broad and with very\r\nsteep sides, through the mesas to the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Otay mesa has a height of about 500 feet, the western portion being\r\nsomewhat higher than the eastern, indicating a recent elevation near the\r\ncoast. The soil of the mesa is adobe, due to the decay of porphyry\r\nmountains to the east. Under the adobe there is a calcareous marl, often\r\nmany feet thick.\r\n\r\nThe first exposure of the older rock seen as one goes up the Otay River,\r\nis in a hill rising through the mesa about in the center of the grant.\r\nIt is a part of the extensive porphyry intrusives, which, in southern\r\nSan Diego County, form a number of high mountains between the granite\r\nand the mesa. To this formation belong the San Miguel and Otay peaks.\r\nThis exposure on the Otay River is a felsitic breccia. It contains a\r\nfelsite base (intimate mixture of quartz and feldspar), in which are\r\nimbedded fragments of felsite and chlorite. No more rocks appear for\r\nabout 2 miles up the river. Then we reach the base of the long ridges\r\nwhich lead up to the Otay Peak. Some interesting rocks are exposed where\r\nthe stream issues from the cañon. The greater portion are fine dark to\r\ngreenish aphanitic rocks, with green chloritic or epidotic nodules.\r\nBunches and dikes of coarse to fine grained porphyritic rocks\r\noccasionally appear. They probably belong to the diorite porphyrites.\r\nThe rock continues very much the same for several miles farther east; at\r\ntimes it is almost wholly feldspar. In the cañon above El Nido Post\r\nOffice it changes to a light green feldspar porphyry. Near the western\r\nedge of the Jamul grant a dark-colored porphyry takes its place, and a\r\nlittle farther east it becomes jet black, with small white feldspar\r\ncrystals, producing a very pretty effect.\r\n\r\nThe mesa conglomerates extend along the top of the low hills bordering\r\nthe valley nearly to the eastern edge of the Jamul grant. A great\r\nvariety of rocks appear along the Campo road between the Jamul grant and\r\nSheckler’s, on the Cottonwood. Near the eastern end of the grant the\r\nporphyry is followed by fine-grained granitic rock, frequently becoming\r\nschistose. Numerous dikes and bunches of dark diorite cut through this\r\nrock. As Dulzura Post Office is approached, these rocks change to mica\r\nand hornblende schists, and are filled with intruded dikes of diorite\r\nporphyrites. Bodies of massive syenite and coarse granite were also\r\nseen. About Dulzura many of the dikes have the appearance of diabase.\r\nBetween Dulzura and Sheckler’s the country rock is largely micaceous and\r\nchloritic schists. Massive granite forms the high, rugged mountains\r\neast, extending in an arm westerly across the road. The schists have a\r\nnorthwest strike, vertical dip, and are evidently of metamorphic origin.\r\nThey form a strip of country extending in the line of strike from near\r\nSheckler’s to the Sweetwater River, and are situated between the wide\r\nbelt of porphyry on the west and the coarse intrusive granites on the\r\neast, which rise to form Lyon’s Peak and other rugged mountains.\r\n\r\nThe first rock met east of Sheckler’s, on the Campo road, is coarse\r\nhornblendic granite, so decomposed that a fresh specimen could not be\r\nobtained. Dikes of fine-grained granite intersect it in every direction.\r\nThree miles west of Potrero, mountains of olivinitic diabase rise on the\r\nnorth side of the road. This rock is very similar to many large bodies\r\nof intrusives through the mountains between Julian and the Tia Juana\r\nRiver. It has evidently been intruded into the granite, for dikes extend\r\nout, intersecting the latter rock.\r\n\r\nPotrero is located in a valley of several hundred acres in extent, and\r\nsurrounded by granite mountains. It has an elevation of 2,400 feet.\r\nSouth of Potrero, along the boundary line, the mountains show large\r\nareas of the dark dioritic and diabasic rocks. The hills immediately\r\nsouth of the valley consist of hornblendic gneiss; strike east and west.\r\nEastward, toward Campo, the rock is chiefly a coarse white granite, very\r\neasily decomposed. It shows a slightly gneissoid structure for a number\r\nof miles. It does not seem to represent the bedding of a sedimentary\r\nrock, but of parallelism of the constituents, induced in the magma by\r\nmovement or pressure. Long, drawn out, lenticular inclusions are often\r\npresent, and are arranged parallel to the schistose structure. These\r\nconsist largely of hornblende, with little feldspar.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Campo the topography of the country changes from that\r\nof high mountains and deep, narrow valleys, to an elevated mountain\r\nplateau with meadows and rounded granite ridges. The mountains are\r\ncovered with brush, while live oaks are numerous in the valleys. The\r\ncountry maintains these features while gradually rising to the divide 8\r\nmiles east of Campo. The granite is so deeply decomposed along the\r\nsummit region that no good samples could be obtained. Campo has an\r\nelevation of 2,600 feet. The bare, rounded ridges closely resemble those\r\nleft by glacial action, but their slope is produced simply by the\r\ncleaving off successively of the more angular portions in great slabs.\r\nMany fine examples of this manner of decay appear about Campo. The\r\ncorners are decomposed faster than the smooth surfaces, and thus finally\r\na shelly concentric structure results. The fresh massive central portion\r\nweathers out like water-worn bowlders. The presence of rugged angular\r\nridges results either from a less inherent tendency to decay, or to a\r\ncomparative freedom from crushing. Four miles northeast of Campo is an\r\noutcrop of coarse hornblendic granite, with large six-sided mica scales\r\nand numerous yellow crystals of titanite. The height of the divide is\r\n3,800 feet. Near the summit the rocky ridges all disappear and the\r\ncountry becomes covered with granitic sand. Erosion here is evidently\r\nvery slight. The country descends gradually on the east to Jacumba\r\nValley, being sandy for some distance. This finally gives place to bare,\r\nrocky ridges and cañons. Veins of fine granite, and others of feldspar\r\nand quartz, are abundant on the eastern slope.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Jacumba Valley a body of mica and hornblende schist is\r\nencountered. The schists do not form a regularly defined belt, but often\r\nappear as inclusions in the granite. These inclusions have a very\r\nvariable strike, and from their relation to the granite it is evident\r\nthat the latter is intrusive.\r\n\r\nJacumba Valley empties northward into the desert through a narrow gorge.\r\nIt has an elevation of 2,600 feet, the same as that of Campo. It is\r\nseveral square miles in extent, the greater part of which is in Lower\r\nCalifornia. The warm springs here are considered quite medicinal. The\r\nschists just described occupy a large area west and north of the cañon\r\nthrough which the valley empties. They are cut in every direction by\r\ndikes of granite and others, consisting of a very coarse aggregate of\r\nquartz and feldspar with a little muscovite mica. A high mountain\r\nseveral miles north of the valley is distinctly ribbed all over by them.\r\nThe schists extend northward toward those which outcrop on the eastern\r\nslope of the Laguna Mountains and at Julian, but are cut off by a body\r\nof intrusive granite. They undoubtedly belong to the same series.\r\nGold-bearing veins have been found in them a little north of Jacumba\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of Jacumba Valley, and on the west side of the outlet,\r\nis an area of volcanic rock, probably basalt. It forms a table-land,\r\ngently sloping toward the valley, and rising 600 or 700 feet at its\r\nnorthern end. It is underlaid by gravels and conglomerates. Just east of\r\nthis is a black butte, rising perfectly symmetrical to the same height.\r\nIt consists of bedded lavas, with tufa at the bottom. In spite of the\r\nfact that it is shaped like a crater, its structure is different, and it\r\nis probably a remnant of the flow which once covered the outlet to the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThe high range of mountains between Jacumba Valley and the desert has an\r\naltitude of something over 4,000 feet, but where the road crosses it, it\r\nis only 3,100 feet. Basalt outcrops also on the eastern side of the\r\nvalley. North of the road to Mountain Springs it forms a series of\r\nplateaus, the highest of which reaches a height of 3,900 feet. It forms\r\nthe summit of the range, being 800 feet above the granite forming the\r\npass. South of the pass several miles the granite rises much higher and\r\nthe lava lies along its western slope, extending an unknown distance\r\nbelow the line.\r\n\r\nLarge deposits of water-worn bowlders and gravels lie along the eastern\r\nslope of Jacumba Valley. Among them are pebbles of porphyries, black\r\nquartz, and others not seen in place in this part of the county. A short\r\ndistance west of the summit they are found in beds with gravel and\r\nsandstone, dipping southwest. These late Tertiary deposits are overlaid\r\nby the volcanic beds. The volcanic plateau which rises so high north of\r\nthe pass has a thickness of 500 to 600 feet. Massive and bedded lavas\r\nform the upper half of this thickness, the lower portion consisting of a\r\nvolcanic breccia. The beds lie nearly horizontal. On the west are two\r\nlower terraces, also capped with lava and abutting against the higher.\r\nThe whole is underlaid by sand rock of granitic origin. It is nearly\r\nlevel in places, in others it dips to the southwest. It is very strange\r\nthat these lava beds, with nearly level flowage lines, should be found\r\nat such greatly varying elevations about Jacumba Valley, and be\r\nunderlaid everywhere by such similar tuffs and sandstones. My\r\ninvestigations disclosed no volcanic vent, and it is possible that the\r\nlava issued from fissures, as was noticed elsewhere in the county.\r\nAnother interesting question is the origin of the sandstones and\r\nconglomerates. The sandstone underneath the high plateau is higher than\r\nthe divide at that spot, and the only granite within miles that exceeds\r\nit in height, is the narrow ridge which rises on the southeast. The\r\nerosion must have been very great along the ridges since the sandstones\r\nwere deposited, but the valley cannot have changed much. There may have\r\nbeen great elevation along the crest of the range bordering the desert\r\nsince the deposition of sandstone, tilting up the sandstone and lava on\r\nthe eastern slope, but elevating without great disturbance those near\r\nthe summit. Southeast of Mountain Springs is a body of bedded tufas\r\nreaching an elevation of 2,300 feet, and dipping to the east away from\r\nthe range at a considerable angle.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these modern sandstones at so great an elevation nearly\r\non the crest of the Peninsula range is a very interesting fact. Either\r\nJacumba Valley was a lake, or a great elevation has taken place in\r\ncomparatively recent times, raising the valley from the sea-level.\r\nAppearances indicate that during late Tertiary times this range was\r\nalmost submerged beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nThe rocks between the summit and Mountain Springs are chiefly gneissoid,\r\nat times granitic. They contain bodies of fine dark mica schist, and\r\nmany dikes of very coarse muscovite granite. The descent to the desert\r\nis very abrupt over bare granite ridges. Mountain Springs, an old stage\r\nstation, is located on the side of the mountain at an elevation of 2,300\r\nfeet. From the springs the road descends along the dry bed of an arroyo\r\nto the desert. The most of the distance is through a rocky cañon, where\r\nthere is an excellent opportunity to study the relations of the gneiss\r\nand granite. For some distance down from the springs the rocks continue\r\nto be gneissoid, but through the lower end of the cañon they become more\r\nmassive and coarse, and all the veins characteristic of the gneisses of\r\nthe higher mountain region disappear. At the upper end of the cañon is a\r\ndike of very coarse granite, with large biotite crystals instead of\r\nmuscovite. This is the only instance in which biotite was seen in one of\r\nthese coarse dikes. Banded gneiss, varying from very thin to very thick\r\nbedded, alternate with other rocks, to all appearances massive granites,\r\nbut in surface decay the latter break up into slabs of varying\r\nthickness, parallel to the schistose structure of the gneisses. The\r\nbanding is caused by an excess of mica or hornblende, chiefly the\r\nlatter, arranged in parallel layers. These strata are often very thin,\r\nvarying from one fourth to one half inch and upwards in thickness. They\r\nare very regular, but often discontinuous; stop, and in course of a few\r\nfeet begin again. These features are generally supposed to indicate\r\nmetamorphic origin, but at one spot a body of dark mica schist is cut by\r\na dike a foot wide or more of this dark banded gneissose rock. This dike\r\ncuts across the stratification of the mica schist, showing conclusively\r\nthe intrusive nature of at least a part of these gneisses; and it is\r\nquite possible that the inclusions of mica schist are the only really\r\nsedimentary rocks present. In places the rocks which show this banding\r\nhave the constituents arranged in the bands independent of any\r\ndirection. At one spot a distinct, well-defined mass of mica schist, 15\r\nfeet across, is imbedded in a granitic rock. At one side this gneissoid\r\nstructure extends through the inclosing rock and abuts sharply against\r\nthe mica schist. The banding shows no constant direction; in the cañon\r\nit is northeast. The bands sometimes become wavy.\r\n\r\nAs the cañon opens out to the desert, hills appear on either side formed\r\nof volcanic tuffs. They dip northeast 30°. Underneath is a sandstone\r\nwholly unconsolidated and dipping in the same direction 40°. This\r\ncontains no lava pebbles. The fragments of the tuff are quite varied in\r\ncharacter and generally quite angular. They are imbedded in a volcanic\r\nmud, free from granitic detritus. In some of the strata appear thin beds\r\nof lava, seeming to represent a flow. These tufa hills extend\r\nnorthwesterly along the base of the granite mountains for 10 miles or\r\nmore. It is not known how far they go in a southerly direction. In\r\nplaces they form mountains of considerable size high up on the side of\r\nthe range. The range of mountains between this point and Carrizo Creek\r\nappears also to have some volcanic beds on its southern slope. The open\r\ndesert at the foot of the mountains has an elevation of 1,200 feet. It\r\nslopes gently for miles in an easterly direction and consists largely of\r\nloose sand.\r\n\r\nBetween Mountain Springs and the summit is another illustration of the\r\nfact that lamination in a crystalline rock is no proof of its\r\nsedimentary origin. A small dike less than 2 inches thick cuts across a\r\ncoarse biotite gneiss at an angle of 30°. It is separated from the\r\ngneiss by a thin layer of quartz and feldspar. It is made up of the same\r\nconstituents as the gneiss, arranged so as to show a well-pronounced\r\ngneissoid structure. This is very similar to the large dikes seen in the\r\ncañon.\r\n\r\nThe road was followed back to Campo, and from there the Laguna Mountains\r\nwere climbed. The road ascends a long, narrow cañon on the southern\r\nslope. At the entrance to the cañon, 4 miles southeast of Buckman’s\r\nSprings, the mountains are high and rocky, being formed of thin-bedded\r\ngneisses, which, in many places, blend into mica schists. They strike\r\nparallel to the mountain axis, a little west of north; dip 70°\r\nnortheast. Three miles up the cañon the gneiss becomes thick-bedded and\r\nis finally replaced by mica diorite, which forms the hills on both\r\nsides. Granitic dikes outcrop near the junction and sometimes apparently\r\nin the diorite. There is often a blending between the two, as if the\r\nintrusion of both took place nearly at the same time. The region east of\r\nthe southern end of the mountains is formed of coarse granite,\r\ndecomposed to a considerable depth. The mica diorite extends northward,\r\nforming the whole central and western part of the mountains. On the east\r\nit is bordered by a slightly higher ridge, forming the crest of the\r\nmountains. This rock does not decompose as easily as the granite and\r\ngneisses on the west, and there consequently remains a mountain plateau\r\nhaving an elevation of about 5,500 feet. There is a considerable amount\r\nof pine timber and open meadows. The dark diorite forms one of the\r\nhighest peaks of the Laguna Mountains, rising 6,250 feet. The highest\r\nportion of the mountains lies to the northeast, and is formed chiefly of\r\na quartzose mica schist. From the eastern crest of the range a most\r\nmagnificent view of the desert is obtained. The strata on the crest\r\nstrike north 15° west, dip 70° northeast. The descent of 4,000 feet to\r\nVallecitos is very abrupt. Near the crest it is almost as steep as the\r\ndip of the rocks. The mica schists in places approach gneiss in\r\ncomposition, but all of this series of rocks forming the crest and\r\neastern slope very probably belong to the Metamorphic Series. South of\r\nthis point the Laguna Mountains do not terminate so abruptly, but extend\r\nout in long, gradually descending ridges for many miles. The mica\r\ndiorite extends north of the Laguna about a mile, when the schists on\r\nboth east and west sides unite and extend north toward Banner. They are\r\nintruded by granite and diorite in many places. The body of diorite\r\nforming the Laguna plateau is about 8 miles long and 1½ to 2 miles wide.\r\nThe highest peak is not over 200 feet lower than the Cuyamaca, rising\r\n6,300 feet. The diorite seems to have been intruded in the middle of a\r\nconsiderable area of mica schists, for this rock outcrops on all sides.\r\nOn the west, toward Pine Valley, they carry the gold veins of the Pine\r\nValley district. The descent is very abrupt to Pine Valley and Buckman’s\r\nSprings. The schists and gneisses extend about 3 miles south of the main\r\nportion of the mountains, when they are replaced by coarse hornblendic\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nBuckman’s Springs has an elevation of 3,400 feet. Here are some very\r\nexcellent soda springs, the only ones I know of in this section of the\r\nState. A coarse, dark diabase outcrops in the edge of the mountains just\r\nnorth of Buckman’s and also a little farther south, on the west side of\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nA narrow cañon leads up to the divide which separates the valley of the\r\nupper Cottonwood from Pine Valley. The western prolongation of the\r\ndiorite of the Laguna Mountains appears near the road on the divide. The\r\nprevailing rock is, however, of a granitoid nature and filled with many\r\nlarge bunches of massive white quartz. Pine Valley has an elevation of\r\n3,800 feet. Gneisses and hornblendic and micaceous schists outcrop\r\nbetween the valley and the divide east of Descanso. The strike is north\r\nand south. One mile southeast of Descanso there is another outcrop of\r\nthe coarse diabase or gabbro which forms so much of the Cuyamaca peaks.\r\nDescanso has an elevation of 3,400 feet. The rock which outcrops for a\r\nnumber of miles along the road to Stonewall is a coarse, easily\r\ndecomposed granite, rising in rounded knobs over a rolling,\r\nbrush-covered country.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Valley district lies in a belt of gneissose, mica schist, and\r\nquartzose rocks, which extend in a direction a little west of north.\r\nThey begin about 2 miles south of Pine Creek and extend, probably\r\nunbroken, through to Banner and Julian. It is 4 miles north to the Deer\r\nPark district. The metamorphic schists widen as this district is\r\napproached. They extend from the desert slope to Deer Park, where a body\r\nof diorite has been intruded, and from there westward 2 miles to the\r\nCuyamaca grant. A half mile west of the camp the slaty mica schists and\r\nquartzites are well defined. A vein of gold-bearing quartz has been\r\ntraced for several miles in these rocks, and a number of locations have\r\nbeen made on it. The strike is north and south, dip 80° to the east. A\r\nbody of white crystalline limestone lies in this formation, about 1½\r\nmiles southwest of Deer Park. The body of micaceous diorite which\r\nextends through this camp is about a mile long, and is quite gneissoid\r\nin places. Near its southern end it incloses narrow bands of hornblendic\r\nand feldspathic rock, containing garnets. The veins are numerous in this\r\ndiorite, and extend in every conceivable direction. The diorite has been\r\ngreatly crushed at some time, with fissures in every direction; hence,\r\nthe irregularity of the quartz veins. The veins are generally bunchy,\r\nand not often very large. They seem simply to follow the exceedingly\r\nirregular fracturing of the diorite, which is decomposed to a\r\nconsiderable depth. The work thus far in this district has been confined\r\nto the surface, so that nothing can be said in regard to the permanency\r\nof the veins. The elevation of the camp is 4,600 feet.\r\n\r\nTwo miles northward an outcrop of coarse biotite muscovite granite was\r\nmet. It is about 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, having schists on all\r\nsides of it. This is the only example of typical granite (according to\r\nRosenbusch) that was seen in Southern California. A broad valley,\r\noccupied by Mr. Harper’s ranch, has been eroded in the center of this\r\ngranitic mass.\r\n\r\nNorthward, along the crest of the range overlooking the desert, mica\r\nslates appear. They are so little metamorphosed as to closely resemble\r\nargillaceous slate. They strike a little west of north, dip 70° to 80°\r\neast, and maintain the same character north to Banner and Julian.\r\n\r\nThe road from Julian to Stonewall crosses mica schist and gneisses for\r\nabout half the distance. Then we met outcrops of a dark basic rock,\r\nranging from fine to very coarse texture. It extends southward and\r\ncovers a large extent of country. The three Cuyamaca peaks, the highest\r\nin the southern part of the county, are formed of this rock. This rock\r\nwas again met about half a mile west of the Stonewall Mine. It extends\r\nwestward across the mountains for at least 2 miles, and some miles south\r\nof the main peak. In places it has a schistose structure. Near the\r\noutlet of the Cuyamaca reservoirs it is filled with vein-like aggregates\r\nof coarse hornblende crystals, which are probably the result of\r\nsecondary crystallization in fissures or cracks of the almost\r\nconsolidated magma.\r\n\r\nThe formation in the vicinity of the Stonewall Mine is biotite gneiss.\r\nToward the east it is not sharply defined from the mica schists. On the\r\nwest it is generally more granitoid, though at one spot near the lake\r\nthere are finely laminated schists, dipping 70° southwest. Southward,\r\nalso, the gneisses become more massive and coarse. At the northeastern\r\nbase of the main peak a body of coarse granite is partly inclosed in the\r\nnorite. This norite assumes a dioritic habitus near the granite, with\r\nthe development of biotite mica.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Cottonwood was followed down several miles, when it\r\nwas left and the Morena Valley traversed to its head. The mountains\r\nsouth of the valley are formed of a dark syenite. North and northwest\r\nthe higher mountains consist of granite, with a great development of\r\nmica and hornblende schists along the slope facing the valley. Many\r\ngranite dikes have been intruded into the schists. North of Mr.\r\nCandler’s there is a great dike of pegmatite, carrying small garnets,\r\ntourmaline, mica, and large masses of quartz. This pegmatite dike cuts\r\nacross the cañon, forming a precipice on its lower side. On the upper\r\nside the soil has been retained, forming a small but fertile valley. The\r\nstrike of the mica schists on the north is quite unusual, being north\r\n75° west, dip nearly vertical. Dark syenite lies on the west of this\r\nlittle valley. Morena Valley has an elevation of 3,400 feet. A rough\r\nroad leads over the mountains west to McClain’s ranch, a distance of 10\r\nmiles; the highest point reached having an elevation of 4,000 feet. Near\r\nthe summit there outcrops a body of coarse eruptive rock, probably a\r\ndiorite. It consists of coarse hornblendic aggregates in a light-colored\r\nfeldspathic matrix. This is followed by syenite, and that by coarse\r\nwhite granite as far as McClain’s. The granite about the valley is\r\ncoarse, with dark, fine crystalline inclusions. It has every character\r\nof a truly eruptive rock, even to the minute spaces between the\r\ncomponents, left at the time of crystallization. The road now descends\r\nto a branch of the Cottonwood, and from the creek there is a long,\r\ngradual ascent to the pass north of Lyon’s Peak. The north side of the\r\npass is formed of another high and rugged granite range. This section is\r\none of the wildest to be found in San Diego County. The mountains are\r\nbare granite, often precipitous; the valleys small and covered with\r\nbrush. Crystalline limestone is reported to have been found in the\r\ngranite 5 or 6 miles northeast of Renney’s Pass. A very interesting\r\neruptive rock outcrops east of the pass, on the north side of the road.\r\nIn places it resembles the norite from Cuyamaca peaks. The rock consists\r\nlargely of large, dark, cleavable crystals filled with small granular\r\ncrystals of a green color, probably olivine. A large portion of the dark\r\ncrystals are undoubtedly pyroxene, though there are some showing\r\nhornblende cleavage. This is one of the most peculiar and interesting\r\nrocks seen in the county, but, from lack of any opportunity to make a\r\nmicroscopic examination, no more definite definition can be given.\r\n\r\nCoarse granite extends some distance west of the pass. It is decomposed\r\nto such a depth that no specimens could be obtained. A mile west of the\r\npass a fine granite, apparently metamorphic, replaces the other. It\r\ncontains much quartz, little mica, and yellowish feldspar. Some distance\r\ndown the new grade a large body of diorite outcrops. It is one of the\r\nsouthern arms of a great mass of coarse, dark rock which forms the high\r\nmountains about Dehesa Post Office, on the Sweetwater. A large portion\r\nof this rock very closely resembles that forming the Cuyamaca, and is\r\nprobably a gabbro.\r\n\r\nNear the foot of the grade, 2 miles east of Jamul Post Office, this rock\r\nis very coarse, with large hornblende crystals. It extends out in the\r\nform of arms or dikes into the adjoining granitic rocks. This rock is\r\nvery tough and heavy. Gneiss outcrops for 2 miles westward. It varies\r\nbetween thin-bedded micaceous strata and thick-bedded, almost granitic\r\nforms. It strikes north 15° east, dips 70° to 80° east. Farther down,\r\ntoward the Oakdale House, this is replaced by coarse eruptive granites.\r\nJust below the Oakdale House there is a very interesting contact between\r\ngranite, quartz porphyry, and diabase. The first rock exposed below the\r\nhouse is a rather dark micaceous syenite. Beyond this the rock becomes\r\ncoarser, containing large grains of quartz and glassy feldspar, with\r\ninclusions of a very dark diabasic rock. In a little cañon which comes\r\ndown to the road from the east, this rock comes into contact with one\r\nwhich varies from a feldspathic mica schist, through a gneiss, to a\r\nquartz porphyry. The junction is very irregular and the two rocks are\r\nslightly mixed; sometimes branches of the syenite are partly inclosed in\r\nthe porphyry. Some portions of the syenite show gas pores, or spaces\r\nleft at the time of consolidation, one fourth to one half an inch in\r\ndiameter. They are partly filled with secondary quartz. The next rock\r\nexposed up the cañon is a mica schist; strike 15° west, dip vertical.\r\nQuartz porphyry follows this, then an irregular dike of granite, in\r\nwhich are imbedded nodules of quartz porphyry, some nearly a foot in\r\ndiameter. Above the granite there appears a granitoid gneiss, with many\r\ncavities, arranged with their longer axes parallel to the schistose\r\nstructure. This changes into a coarse, knotty granite, containing large\r\nnodules of dark petrosilex. A slight blending is noticeable. Farther up\r\nthis is succeeded by a micaceous quartz feldspar porphyry, showing a\r\nsomewhat gneissoid structure. It is out at right angles to this\r\nstructure by jointing planes lying thickly together. It has a milky,\r\nvitreous luster, and contains inclusions of very coarse granite. The\r\nnext rock exposed is a diabase 200 feet across. It is coarse in the\r\nmiddle and aphanitic on the edges. Adjoining it are bunches of granite\r\nand a fine, dark, compact mica schist, showing traces of little pebbles\r\nin places. The schist changes to a petrosilex, which comes in contact\r\nwith a dike of very coarse granite. At the upper edge of this granite\r\noutcrop, and inclosed in it, is a stratum of fine, dark mica schist and\r\na dike of quartz porphyry. At one end these inclusions are hidden, but\r\nat the other they have been bent, fractured, and the pieces separated\r\nsome distance in the granite. (Fig. 9). This is a most interesting\r\nexample of the intrusive nature of the granite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe granite dike is bounded on its upper side by one of aphanitic\r\ndiabase 2 feet wide, followed by granite again. Nodules of the diabase\r\nappear in the edge of the granite. A stratum of wavy quartzose gneiss 10\r\nfeet wide follows the last dike of granite. It changes across the strike\r\ninto a coarser gneiss, and that into irregular and partially blended\r\nmasses of coarse granite, filled with long fragments of porphyry similar\r\nto a dike on the east. (Fig. 10.) The quartz porphyry is very compact\r\nand brittle, and has a conchoidal fracture. The porphyry dike has a\r\nwidth of 8 feet. About it is still another dike of granite 12 feet\r\nacross, and containing many long fragments of a diabasic rock, which\r\nappears next in the succession.\r\n\r\nThe diabase is cut by small, interlacing granite seams for 6 or 8 feet,\r\nand also contains some large, irregular, lenticular masses of the same\r\nrock. Still farther is another dark dike cut squarely across by granite.\r\nFine granite and quartz porphyry dikes occur still farther east. The\r\nporphyry dikes all run about north 35° west, average dip 70° southwest.\r\nThey extend along the summit of a ridge for more than half a mile, when\r\nthe coarse granite becomes the country rock. On the summit of the hill\r\nat the head of the cañon are strata of metamorphic rock, and also some\r\nveins of pegmatite, cutting across the porphyry. This wonderfully varied\r\nsuccession of rocks does not cover a width of more than a quarter of a\r\nmile. The relations exhibited here prove that the porphyry and diabase,\r\nas well as the schists, are older than the granite. The strip of country\r\nbetween the ancient porphyries of San Miguel and the coarse granite of\r\nLyon’s Peak and the ranges north is remarkably rich in its variety of\r\nintrusive rocks.\r\n\r\nOn the north bank of the Sweetwater, just above where the Spring Valley\r\nroad crosses, is a large exposure of coarse granite, containing so many\r\ninclosures of a dark dioritic rock as to present the appearance of a\r\nconglomerate. It is cut by bunches and ramifying dikes of fine granite\r\nand diorite.\r\n\r\nAt Dehesa the granite is replaced by norite, which forms a high mountain\r\non the north side of the river, and extends southeasterly 3 or 4 miles,\r\nforming two high peaks. In this are veins of hornblende aggregates, and\r\nin general appearance the rock bears the closest resemblance to that on\r\nthe Cuyamaca.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline rocks exposed between the Sweetwater and El Cajon Valley\r\ngenerally show more of a dioritic composition than granitic. They have a\r\nglassy feldspar, much hornblende, and little quartz. There are two\r\nvarieties: one is light colored, and forms most of the country; the\r\nother is darker, occurring in bunches and dikes. Southwest of the valley\r\nthe rocks are more granitic. On the road to Spring Valley they give\r\nplace to a hard, light—colored felsitic rock, containing specks of\r\nchloritic matter. Masses of granite appear in places, intruded into the\r\nrock. As it decays it becomes jointed, and seems to be reduced mostly to\r\nkaolin. Near the railroad, northwest of Spring Valley, rocks outcrop\r\nwhich belong to the series of dark intrusives, tuffs, and porphyries so\r\nextensively developed west of the granite. The rock here has a\r\nfragmental appearance in weathered specimens. It has a dark green color,\r\nand is of uncertain composition. The most western exposure of this rock,\r\nbefore it becomes covered by the mesa, has much the same character. It\r\nis without doubt an ancient intrusive, very greatly altered. It contains\r\nbunchy dikes of white feldspathic composition, which easily reduce to\r\nkaolin. The whole exposed width of these rocks west of the granite at\r\nthis point is over a mile, about half of which is tufaceous. By\r\ntufaceous is not necessarily meant a fragmental intrusive deposited in\r\nwater, but for lack of any other term it is used to designate those\r\nfragmental intrusives of plutonic origin which are so abundant in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nBetween the Oakdale House and the Sweetwater River, on the road to the\r\ndam, dark quartz mica diorites outcrop. They have been intruded by\r\ncoarse granite in veins and bunches. A body of dark aphanitic rock, of\r\nuncertain origin, is inclosed in the diorite near the river. It may be a\r\nportion of the aphanitic rocks associated with the porphyries farther\r\nwest. A little distance down the river the diorite is succeeded by\r\nconglomerate rocks, containing small garnets. The fragments are\r\nfeldspathic in composition. Dark feldspathic porphyry then forms the\r\nprevailing rock for some distance. It shows great variations. Much of it\r\ncontains no distinct crystals of feldspar, but is mottled by light green\r\nfelsitic bodies of irregular outline. These contain chloritic\r\nsubstances, which decay out, leaving holes. There is a great variety of\r\nthese ancient intrusives exposed along the sides of the river north of\r\nSan Miguel Peak. None of the other crystalline rocks in San Diego County\r\nappear so old or show so much alteration.\r\n\r\nFarther down the cañon the rock assumes a fragmental appearance, having\r\nmasses of feldspar in a dark matrix. It finally becomes a pronounced\r\nbreccia, being formed largely of angular, felsitic fragments. The base\r\nin which these fragments lie decays away and leaves them standing out on\r\nthe surface. This may be a tuff formed in water, but the matrix has\r\nundergone such alterations that nothing certain can be said about it.\r\nThis breccia continues to the lower end of the cañon. An interesting,\r\nlight-colored dike was observed here. It is so filled with minute\r\nspherical amygdules as to resemble in structure an oolitic limestone.\r\nThe breccia continues as far as the Sweetwater Dam, where it is replaced\r\nby feldspar porphyry. The porphyry shows much variation; in places no\r\nfeldspar crystals are present, chlorite taking their place. These rocks\r\ndisappear a quarter of a mile west of the dam, and mesa-like hills\r\nextend down to Chula Vista. These consist of soft sandstones and some\r\ncalcareous deposits. Dark rocks, belonging to the series just described,\r\noutcrop near the mesa road from San Diego to El Cajon. It forms a long\r\nridge south of La Mesa. The rocks are in part tufaceous, and in part\r\ndark green and massive, with felsitic inclusions. Near the Eleven-Mile\r\nHouse the granite is filled with dark, bowlder-like inclusions.\r\nHornblende is an important constituent of the granite. It is more than\r\nlikely that many of these so-called granites are really diorites. The\r\nmesa formation terminates in an abrupt escarpment on the west of Cajon\r\nValley. The valley comprises many thousand acres of very fertile land.\r\nGranitic knobs rise in many parts of the valley, showing that the\r\nalluvium deposit is underlaid by it at no great depth. North of the\r\nvalley, for a number of miles, the crystalline rocks are covered by the\r\nmesa conglomerates. Granitic rocks are the only ones exposed for many\r\nmiles east of Lakeside. Just above Forster’s there is a small outcrop of\r\ngneiss and mica schist; strike north 35° west, dip 70° northeast. The\r\nrock exposed along the grade is a coarse biotite granite, with much\r\nquartz and glassy feldspar. A dike of quartz porphyry varying to granite\r\nporphyry outcrops by the road at the top of the grade. This does not\r\nseem to be sharply defined from the adjoining granite. A dark hornblende\r\ngranite or diorite begins here and outcrops along the road for several\r\nmiles toward Ramona. Three miles from the town there appears a dark rock\r\nwith a somewhat resinous luster. It is probably a diabase. The Santa\r\nMaria is a large, plateau-like valley, with low granite hills\r\nsurrounding it. Light-colored granite, becoming somewhat hornblendic,\r\nextends some distance east of Ramona, when it is replaced by a dark\r\ndiorite. The latter extends along the road for 2 miles. It has glassy\r\nfeldspar, and in places much mica. Four miles west of Ballena the\r\ngranite is filled with pegmatitic veins, running in a northwesterly\r\ndirection. They carry brittle crystals of black tourmaline, garnet, and\r\nmuscovite mica. East of Ballena the rock becomes coarser and somewhat\r\ngneissose, with an abundance of mica. There are no bedding planes,\r\nsimply a parallelism of constituents. This schistose structure has a\r\nnorthwest direction. The gneiss changes to mica schist on the grade\r\nabove Santa Ysabel. The schist alternates with occasional strata of\r\nquartzite; strike north 25° west. The quartzite is a white, fine,\r\ngranular variety, containing a little mica. Coarse gneiss outcrops again\r\nfarther up the grade; at the top it becomes finer, carrying some\r\nhornblende, and alternating with strata of fine mica schist; dip\r\nnortheast. The gneiss often becomes granitoid. The lamination has no\r\nconstant direction, and resembles a flowage structure. This granitoid\r\ngneiss extends to within a mile of Julian, when there is quite a sharp\r\ntransition to a gneissoid mica schist. That gives place to a fine\r\nschist, and a quarter of a mile west of Julian to a pearly hydro-mica\r\nschist. The schists strike north 20° to 30° west, dip 70° northeast. At\r\nJulian the rock is a dark, thin-bedded mica schist, usually termed a\r\nslate. There are also dark felsitic rocks and some gneisses. The belt of\r\ndark slaty mica schists is about half a mile wide. Toward the Balkan\r\nMountain the rocks become more gneissoid. This mountain seems to be\r\nformed wholly of gneiss and mica schist. In some places the rock is\r\nnearly massive, and contains a large amount of quartz.\r\n\r\nThe rocks forming the mountains near the road from San Felipe to\r\nVallecito are nearly all gneissoid. The real desert begins on leaving\r\nSan Felipe Valley. The road extends southeast for 5 miles and then turns\r\nsouthwest, descending a narrow, rocky gorge to the head of Vallecito\r\nCreek. Near where the road turns to the southwest, the gneisses are cut\r\nby innumerable dikes of coarse granitic composition. Many of these run\r\nparallel, cutting across the strike of the gneisses, and give the\r\nappearance of a bedded formation. In the cañon, before reaching\r\nVallecito Creek, mica schist appears. It is bent and twisted into every\r\nconceivable direction, and varies exceedingly in structure and\r\ncomposition in the course of a few feet. The dip is northeast, and often\r\nat a small angle. The granite dikes often carry garnets, being quite\r\nsimilar to those between Julian and Banner. They were probably intruded\r\nafter the eruption of the granite, and the related metamorphism.\r\n\r\nAt Mason’s granite and gneiss both appear as intrusives in the schists,\r\nand are themselves cut by coarse dikes similar to those described.\r\nBetween this point and Banner, in a direct line, gneiss is the\r\nprevailing rock. The high mountain east of Banner is more granitoid.\r\n\r\nThere is a sandy valley of considerable extent about Mason’s; eastward a\r\nlow ridge is crossed, and the road descends to Vallecito Valley between\r\nbarren granite mountains, gradually descending until the open desert is\r\nreached. When the granite is hard these mountains are very rugged, but\r\nin places they are covered so deeply with soft, decomposed material as\r\nto closely resemble the Tertiary deposits farther east. The mountains\r\noften show pale purple to brown tints. On examination they appear to\r\nconsist of a white granite, which has been so shattered as to break up\r\ninto pieces, averaging not over 2 inches in diameter. This rock presents\r\na very similar appearance for miles, particularly on the north side of\r\nthe creek.\r\n\r\nAt Palm Springs the soft clay beds of late Tertiary age begin to appear.\r\nThey dip in all directions, though that to the south and southwest is\r\nthe most common. Toward Carrizo Station these are often covered by\r\ngranitic detritus. The Tertiary beds widen out where the road strikes\r\nCarrizo Creek, and at Carrizo Station they have a width of nearly 10\r\nmiles. They rest against a granite range north of the creek and south\r\nalong a long ridge which terminates in Carrizo Mountain. They also\r\nextend a long distance up Carrizo Creek. Four miles below the station\r\nharder sandstones and strata of shells cap the clay hills. This shell\r\nlayer near the creek is 10 feet thick and contains pectens and oyster\r\nshells, belonging to the Miocene-Tertiary. The clay hills which surround\r\nCarrizo Station form a veritable Bad-Land. They show many different\r\ncolors, and are perfectly devoid of any vegetation. They have been\r\neroded into a most confused network of hills and cañons, and are so soft\r\nthat it is difficult to travel over them. Six miles below this station\r\nand a mile north of the creek there rises a rugged granite range, facing\r\nthe open desert. It rises from the desert quite precipitously nearly\r\n2,000 feet, but blends westward into the ridges which run east from San\r\nFelipe. The granite is coarse and deeply decomposed. Sharp, angular\r\ngrains of quartz stand out so prominently as to tear anything with which\r\nthey come in contact. The thin-bedded shell strata rest against the\r\nslopes of the mountain, and near the southern end rise against the\r\neastern slope at a very high angle in sharp, jagged points. These strata\r\nrise above the granite ridges at the point where they occur, and dip\r\nfully 70° to the east. (Fig. 11.) Resting on the summit of this granite\r\nridge, and immediately west of the steeply inclined and jagged points of\r\nthe Tertiary strata, is the southern outcrop of a bed of coarse, hard\r\nsandstone, which rises along the summit of the ridges to the north and\r\ndips west, extending down the western side of the range for a thousand\r\nfeet or more, dipping at an angle of about 30°. This sandstone outcrops\r\nalong the crest of the ridge for nearly a mile. It is, however, not\r\nabsolutely continuous, the granite rising through it in places. Near the\r\nsouthern end it is so highly metamorphosed as to be with difficulty\r\ndistinguished from the granite at the contact. In fact, the two\r\nformations have become so intimately united, that a fracture of the\r\ngranite made near the sandstone, instead of stopping at the contact,\r\nextends into the sandstone, so that the two rocks break off together.\r\nThe contact is so exceedingly irregular that it seemed at first sight as\r\nif the sandstone had been intruded by the granite. Deep, narrow crevices\r\nextend into the granite, and are filled with sandstone. Some granite\r\nbunches are almost inclosed in the sandstone. The most interesting\r\nfeature of this sandstone is the presence in it of an abundance of\r\nwell-preserved corals of a type fully as old as the Cretaceous.\r\nFragments of two species of a large oyster and poorly preserved\r\nspecimens of univalve and bivalve shells are also abundant. There are at\r\nleast two species of coral, many specimens being at least a foot in\r\ndiameter. The sandstone is literally filled with them toward the\r\nsouthern portion of the outcrop. They also extend down into the crevices\r\nand cavities in the granite. The sandstone shows somewhat less\r\nmetamorphism toward the north, where it contains some strata of pebbly\r\nconglomerate. The granite is intersected by many veins of coarsely\r\ncrystallized feldspar and quartz. From these veins many of the pebbles\r\nin the conglomerate have been derived. At the highest point of the ridge\r\nthe sandstone has the greatest thickness. Here it is broken up into\r\ngreat blocks 15 feet square, piled in the greatest confusion, as if by\r\nan earthquake. One great mass overhangs the almost precipitous granite\r\nescarpment at an elevation of 1,000 feet above the desert. Many\r\nfractures extend from the sandstones through into the granite. The\r\nsandstones, as well as the granite mountains north, have been baked a\r\ndull red color by the intense heat of the sun. To account for the\r\npeculiar position of this sandstone, as well as the steep inclination of\r\nthe Tertiary beds at the southern end of the mountain, we must suppose\r\nthat an extensive fault has taken place along the edge of the range\r\nfacing the desert. The general inclination of the Tertiary beds to the\r\nwest and southwest is also evidence of an uplift along this line.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nCarrizo Mountain was ascended from the north by following up a wash\r\nthrough the clay hills. At the foot of the mountain there is a small\r\noutcrop of ancient volcanic rock greatly altered. This rock rests\r\nagainst the limestone which forms a large part of the north end of the\r\nmountain. The limestone is crystalline in every portion. The strike, as\r\nwell as that of the schists and quartzites by which it is inclosed, is\r\nnorth 30° to 40° west, dip 75° to the southwest. The color of the\r\nlimestone varies from white to streaked and variegated. It was carefully\r\nexamined for fossils, but no traces of them could be found. The\r\nlimestone is, however, filled in many places with the holes of borers,\r\nand one small incrusting coral and one barnacle were found. The\r\nelevation of the north peak is 1,700 feet, and these were found nearly\r\nat the top. Everything points to a great elevation here in times so\r\nrecent that the atmospheric agencies have not yet had time to remove the\r\nsurface exposed to the ocean waters. Another factor enters into this\r\ntime computation, however, and that is that in this climate, where the\r\nrainfall is so slight, a great many years are required to effect slight\r\nchanges. Toward the south peak the rock is almost wholly micaceous and\r\nquartzose schists. Judging from the great amount of metamorphism shown\r\nby these rocks, fossils, if they ever existed, must have been destroyed.\r\nAt various points on the northern end of the mountain are horizontal\r\ndeposits of a soft, shaly sandstone full of fossils, similar to those\r\nfound north of Carrizo Creek. The corals are very large and perfect.\r\nSome nearly entire specimens of large oysters were also obtained, but\r\nmost of the bivalve shells are represented only by casts. With all the\r\nexploration which has been done, it seems probable that these beds have\r\nnever before been seen.\r\n\r\nProfessor Blake, geologist of the Pacific Railroad Survey, passed up\r\nCarrizo Creek in 1853, but, from the statements made, it seems his\r\nobservations were confined to the immediate vicinity of the road. His is\r\nthe only geological party that has visited this region up to the present\r\ntime. The vicinity of Carrizo Mountain is a favorite one for\r\nprospectors, and every winter it is visited by a number of parties. As\r\nyet no important discoveries have been made, and I cannot say that I\r\nthink the region is a favorable one. Silver has been reported from the\r\nsouthern slope of Carrizo Mountain, and at one time there was\r\nconsiderable excitement. The mountain, though formed wholly of\r\nmetamorphic rocks, does not appear to have been mineralized to any\r\nextent. Only one dike was seen on the mountain, and that was of a\r\ncoarse, granitic nature.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt as to the presence of a non-conformity\r\nbetween the Miocene-Tertiary and the coral-bearing sandstones. Specimens\r\nof the coral were sent to the National Museum, and were pronounced\r\nsimilar to some from the lowest Cretaceous of Texas. As to the age of\r\nthe limestone and associated metamorphic rocks, they are unquestionably\r\nCarboniferous or older. A float piece of silicious limestone was found\r\ncontaining some shells, but no opportunity for their investigation has\r\nyet occurred. The Tertiary beds are covered, wherever any of their\r\noriginal surfaces yet remain, by a great variety of washed bowlders.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the structure of this eastern slope of the Peninsula\r\nrange, I can hardly agree with the views before expressed, that there\r\nare to be seen here evidences of an enormous fault, to which the steep\r\nescarpment toward the east is due. The eastern side of the range, so\r\nprecipitous in places, has been compared to that of the Sierras in\r\nstructure and general features. It is true that this descent is very\r\nabrupt in places, but in others it is almost as gradual as the western\r\nslope. For instance, the gradually descending ridges which extend east\r\nfrom Banner for nearly 30 miles, show no indication of any fault, save\r\nat the mouth of Carrizo Creek, where there has undoubtedly been a fault\r\nof considerable importance. The very abrupt descent east of the Balkan\r\nand Laguna Mountains is due solely to enormous erosion, for both north\r\nand south ridges extend past them for many miles into the desert.\r\n\r\nThe San Jacinto Mountains also send out long arms into the desert, and\r\nbelow the boundary Signal Mountain and a connecting range seem to be\r\nmerely a spur of the main system. The rocks of the metamorphic belt at\r\nJulian and Banner, and farther south, dip to the northeast, indicating a\r\ngreat fold rather than fault, with the most strongly pronounced\r\nintrusive granites and diorites at some distance on each side.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that an ancient auriferous gravel channel\r\nexists in the county. It begins about a mile north of the old stage\r\nstation, and 3 miles west of Ballena Post Office, where there rises a\r\nhill shaped like a whale’s back (hence the name Ballena), covered with\r\nwashed gravel and bowlders. The main portion of the channel which has\r\nescaped erosion begins south of the stage station, capping a hill which\r\nhas an elevation above the sea of 2,400 feet, being a little lower than\r\nthe so-called Whale Mountain. The gravel is 50 to 100 feet thick, and\r\nhas a width of 2,000 feet or more. It rises 300 to 500 feet above the\r\nvalleys and cañons on its sides. It extends in a direction a little\r\nsouth of west for about 4 miles, terminating on the south of Santa Maria\r\nValley. A granite ridge runs 2 or 3 miles farther in the same direction,\r\nprobably preserved by the gravels, which are now gone. A pretty valley,\r\na mile long, has been eroded in the eastern end of the gravels, down to\r\nthe underlying granite. Placer mining has been carried on for years here\r\nin a small way by Mexicans. Gold is said to be scattered everywhere\r\nthrough the gravels, which are often very firmly cemented. Lack of\r\nwater, for the ridge is higher than any of the surrounding country, has\r\nprevented work on a large scale. Lately a mining district has been\r\norganized, and it is proposed to bring water 7 miles in pipe. In the\r\ngravels are washed bowlders, many of them being 2 feet in diameter and\r\nwell polished. The remarkable thing about them, however, is that they\r\nare nearly all porphyries. The most abundant is a red feldspar quartz\r\nporphyry. Quartzite bowlders of all colors are numerous, and there are a\r\nfew of the basic diorite so common in portions of the county. Garnets\r\nare said to be very abundant in the gravels, and many bowlders of a\r\nschist carrying them are also present. The matrix of this rock could not\r\nbe made out in the field; it is very tough and heavy, and has never been\r\nseen in place. The red porphyry bowlders resemble those on the mesa\r\nfarther west, but have never been found in place. Never, in the\r\nmountains east or north, has porphyry of this kind been seen, either by\r\nmyself or described by others. From the old stage station the upper\r\ncourse of the stream was north and south as far as it can be traced.\r\nThere are indications that one branch extended easterly toward Julian.\r\nThese gravels appear on a hill surrounded by deep cañons, about 2 miles\r\neast of the top of the grade above Foster’s. At the top of the grade the\r\nhills on the west are flat-topped, and covered with gravels to a depth\r\nof 150 feet. These have much the same character, and probably belong to\r\nthe same channel. More investigation is needed to determine whether the\r\ncourse of the old stream was down toward the San Diego River, in Cajon\r\nValley, or west toward the high mesas south and southeast of Poway\r\nValley. It seems probable, however, that the stream flowed west, and\r\nthat the mesas have been formed partly from the bowlders which they\r\nbrought down. This mesa, as well as the gravels at the head of the\r\ngrade, has an elevation of 1,500 feet. The source of the porphyry\r\nbowlders and the garnetiferous schists of this old river is a matter of\r\ngreat perplexity. The gravel deposit has every characteristic of an old\r\nriver channel, and not that of an elevated arm of the sea; besides, the\r\npresence of gold in the gravels indicates their derivation from the\r\ncountry farther east. The gold may have been derived from Julian or Mesa\r\nGrande, or some more remote point. The river must have flowed across the\r\ngold belt, but then the question arises, how could a river of such\r\nmagnitude have existed so near the summit? The only way out of the\r\ndifficulty is to suppose that a great uplift has taken place along the\r\ncrest and western slope, coupled with an enormous amount of erosion; and\r\nthat this stream once, before this great change took place in the\r\nconfiguration of the country, headed many miles to the northeast, far\r\nbeyond the drainage of the western slope. The bowlders consist largely\r\nof hard rocks, and are very smoothly rounded and polished, indicating\r\nthat they have been transported a long distance, and subjected to\r\nattrition through a protracted interval. It is quite possible that this\r\nriver emptied into or near San Diego Bay, and that the immense beds of\r\nbowlder conglomerates about the bay owe their formation largely to this\r\nriver action.\r\n\r\nThe first outcrop of crystalline rocks in Mission Valley is about 3\r\nmiles above the old Mission, where the San Diego River enters a cañon.\r\nIt is a volcanic tufa, consisting of grayish to greenish fragments of a\r\nfine-grained rock imbedded in a brown matrix. This has a width of about\r\nhalf a mile. Along the cañon, dikes of a greenish amygdaloid have been\r\nintruded in the rock, and are particularly numerous north of the river.\r\nOne of these dikes in the cañon was observed to be amygdaloidal in the\r\ncenter. Farther up the cañon there is a great variety of tufas. The\r\nfirst contains feldspathic and hornblendic fragments nearly blended in a\r\nbase consisting of crystallized feldspar and dark chloritic particles.\r\nAbove this is a dike of brownish crystalline rock, much altered; the\r\nonly distinguishable mineral being feldspar, in small crystals. Then\r\nfollows another tufa, with nearly blended micaceous fragments. The next\r\nrock is a fine crystalline one with very regular bedding planes, a foot\r\nor more thick; dip 30° to 40° southeast, strike north 35° east. Then\r\nfollows a dark, aphanitic, structureless rock for some distance. At one\r\npoint a branching dike of almost pure feldspathic material spreads out\r\ninto this aphanitic rock in radiating arms. Apparent bedding planes run\r\nthrough them, as well as the country rock, showing that these planes are\r\nnot those of sedimentation, but are due to some secondary cause. These\r\nrocks occupy the cañon for 1½ miles, and are all undoubtedly of volcanic\r\nor intrusive origin. A series of rocks of metamorphic origin outcrops a\r\nthousand feet along the cañon. The first of these is a micaceous\r\nfelsite. That is followed by fine-grained granitic rocks carrying\r\ngarnets, and this by a hornblendic felsite. The latter finally becomes\r\nmixed and blended with a coarse micaceous diorite, containing a glassy\r\nfeldspar. This rock is the chief one exposed through the cañon. It has\r\ngranitic and syenitic facies. The tuffs exposed at the mouth of the\r\ncañon extend in a direction a little east of south for 3 miles, until\r\ncovered by the mesas which extend west from Cajon Valley. They show a\r\ncomparatively uniform character, the fragments being generally nearly\r\nblended. The ridge which these rocks form is separated from the granite\r\nby an elevated mesa a mile wide. The tuffs are exposed along Chaparral\r\nCañon to within 2 miles of the mission.\r\n\r\nThe granite ridge at the lower end of Cajon Valley does not extend more\r\nthan 2 miles north of the cañon, when it becomes covered with bedded\r\ndeposits and bowlders of late Tertiary age. Granite does not appear in\r\nSycamore Cañon until the northeast boundary of the Cajon grant is\r\nreached. High hills of gravel and bowlders lie east of the cañon and\r\nextend toward Foster’s. The main body of granite is met at the head of\r\nthe cañon. It extends along the east side of the road to Poway Valley.\r\nBunches of dark, coarse diorite occur in it in many places. The gravel\r\nmesa south of Poway Valley has an elevation of 1,200 feet. Small areas\r\nof gravel also remain on the hills northeast of the valley. The granite\r\nridge, flanked by porphyries, does not outcrop very prominently south of\r\nLos Peñasquitos Cañon. The ridge southwest of Poway Valley seems to be\r\nformed largely of gravels, rising 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe usual brecciated tuffs outcrop in the gulches and along the creek\r\njust above Los Peñasquitos ranch house. They appear along the old road\r\nto Escondido for 2 miles. A body of chloritic granite appears in the\r\ncenter in the form of a long dike, extending from the Peñasquitos Creek\r\na mile or more north of the road. Toward the east the breccia becomes\r\nfiner and almost loses its fragmental character. Between this formation\r\nand the granite a dark micaceous felsite, probably metamorphic,\r\noutcrops. The fragments in the tuff are diabasic at times and at others\r\nlargely petrosilicious and feldspathic. The crystalline rock on the east\r\nis, perhaps, more nearly diorite than granite, as the feldspar is\r\nchiefly a glassy one. Black Mountain is formed of this dark breccia,\r\nwhile the high range of mountains which rises on the north and extends\r\nnorthwesterly between San Bernardino and the ocean, is formed partly of\r\ngranitic rocks and partly of the tuffs and porphyries, the latter lying\r\non the west.\r\n\r\nA rolling, hilly country, containing much good land, stretches north\r\ntoward Escondido. Remnants of the mesa conglomerates remain in places on\r\nthe eastern edge of the Peñasquitos grant. The granite is coarse and\r\nrises in huge, rounded knobs along the road. A little south of San\r\nBernardino Post Office there rises a conical peak of micaceous diorite.\r\nA somewhat similar rock, but more diabasic in appearance, forms the\r\nmountain immediately west of the Post Office. This formation extends\r\nnorthwesterly for several miles, having a width of about a mile. The\r\nrock over much of this area closely resembles the gabbros and olivinitic\r\ndiabases from the southern part of the county. It is penetrated by\r\ndioritic and granitic veins, in which the structure is often pegmatitic.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the road stops at the entrance of the cañon of Diablo\r\nCreek, this basic formation is replaced on the west by a massive,\r\njointed quartz rock, containing a little feldspar and chlorite, and in\r\nplaces becoming granitoid. It often has a fragmental character, with the\r\nquartzose bodies imbedded in a matrix more granitic, or simply darker\r\nand chloritic. This rock is quite uniform for 3 miles down the cañon,\r\nquartz being the predominating constituent. It is very probable that\r\nthis represents an original sedimentary terrain. It is followed on the\r\nwestern slope of the range by the dark tuffs before described. Here the\r\nmatrix is often porphyritic, with a fluidal structure. Portions are real\r\nporphyries. A mile east of Olivenheim it resembles diorite porphyrite.\r\nThe last exposure seen on the west was of the usual tufaceous character.\r\nThis formation narrows northward, and on the road to San Marcos shows\r\nthe width of a mile.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of San Marcos there is a large body of metamorphic rock,\r\nchiefly felsite schists and feldspathic quartzites. These extend in a\r\nnorthwest direction toward Buena Vista, but there are not many\r\nexposures. Dark diorite outcrops south of Buena Vista, and extends west\r\nfor a mile and a half, when it sinks under the Tertiary deposits. The\r\nlast outcrop seen was a dark micaceous diorite. A mile west of this\r\npoint there is quite an outcrop of diabase containing an excess of dark\r\nfeldspar. The sandy clays extend west from this point to Oceanside. Near\r\nBuena Vista station the diorite is impregnated with green copper\r\ncarbonates, and a considerable amount of work has been done, but\r\nevidently no paying bodies of ore were found. Syenite outcrops near\r\nKelly’s ranch house, and in the hills east. The crystalline rocks come\r\nnearer the ocean here than at any other place in the county.\r\n\r\nBetween Escondido and Moosa Cañon, granites, with bunches of dark\r\ndiorite, are the only rocks seen. A broad, sandy valley extends up San\r\nLuis Rey River to within 5 miles of Pala, when the high granite\r\nmountains close in, forming a cañon. The valley widens at Pala, and for\r\nmany miles a broad, sloping deposit of bowlders and gravel borders the\r\nriver, and rises high against the foot of Smith’s Mountain. It is often\r\n2 miles wide and represents a great amount of erosion. A mile northeast\r\nof Pala is a high hill of diabase, similar to that in the southern part\r\nof the county. On the eastern slope of this hill is an enormous\r\npegmatite vein, carrying a very interesting set of minerals. This vein\r\nis twenty or more feet wide, and dips west at a small angle. There are\r\nmasses of great size of almost pure mica and feldspar, or quartz and\r\nfeldspar—in the latter case very fine specimens of graphic granite have\r\nbeen formed. Near the southern end of this vein is a deposit of\r\nlepidolite mica, 10 feet thick at the widest part, and appearing in\r\ndetached bodies for several hundred feet. It is fine-grained and shows a\r\npale purple color. In places it is pure, in others filled with large\r\nradial aggregates of pink tourmaline (rubellite). Some of the aggregates\r\nare a foot across, others are long and slender, with arborescent forms.\r\nNorth of the main deposit it is found in quartz in fan-shaped\r\naggregates, the crystals being more than a foot long, but greatly\r\ndecomposed. Black tourmaline is abundant in the pegmatite surrounding\r\nthe lepidolite, but in poor, brittle crystals. Green tourmaline is\r\npresent in places in the form of minute grains. Garnets are also to be\r\nfound in places. The vein as a whole is inclosed in the diabase.\r\n\r\nThe western end of Smith’s Mountain shows many bodies of dark dioritic\r\nrocks. The major part of the rock is, however, gneiss and mica schist,\r\nall very easily decomposed, leaving an immense amount of bowlders and\r\ngravel along all of the gulches. Mica schists cover an extensive area\r\nalong the southern slope of Smith’s Mountain, on the Pauma grant. These\r\nare undoubtedly a continuation of the schists of the Julian belt, but\r\ncarry no minerals. The belt of schists extends nearly if not quite\r\nthrough to Julian. Warner Valley is located at the head of San Luis Rey\r\nRiver. It is entirely surrounded by granite mountains. There is not as\r\ngreat a variety of intrusive rock here as in other parts of the county.\r\n\r\nPoint Loma forms a peninsula, the greatest length of which is about 6\r\nmiles, and greatest breadth, 1½ miles. During Quaternary times it was an\r\nisland, but owing partly to an elevation of the coast, and partly to the\r\ndetritus brought down by the San Diego River, it becomes joined to the\r\nmainland. It rises 400 feet in almost perpendicular cliffs at its\r\nsouthern end, gradually lessening in height toward Old Town. The rock of\r\nwhich it is formed consists of soft shales and sandstones, the latter\r\noften quite consolidated. The strata at the extreme end of the point dip\r\nsouth, but in a short distance turn and maintain a quite uniform dip to\r\nthe northeast nearly the whole length of the peninsula. This abrupt\r\nelevation evidently owes its origin to a fault accompanied by an uplift,\r\nand not to erosion. Beginning at Ocean Beach, and following along the\r\nbase of the cliffs to the light-house, hundreds of faults can be\r\ncounted. Near Ocean Beach fifteen can be counted in the space of 200\r\nfeet. The direction of these faults is nearly at right angles to the\r\nstrike. The most of them are nearly vertical and clean cut. The throw\r\nvaries from a few inches to many feet. Sometimes the north and sometimes\r\nthe south wall has risen. An interesting overthrust fault is exposed in\r\nthe cliffs north of Ballast Point. (Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nA conglomerate of late Tertiary age overlies the Cretaceous rocks\r\nunconformably on the extreme end of the point. These conglomerates are\r\nfirmly cemented and form high cliffs. They dip at an angle of 30° to the\r\nsoutheast. The pebbles are in part derived from the sandstone of the\r\npoint, and in part from the crystalline rocks east of the mesa. Near the\r\ntop of this conglomerate are immense, semi-angular bowlders. These have\r\nrolled down to the beach and are strewn around the end of the point.\r\nMany large ones are to be found a little west of the new light-house,\r\nbut the greatest of all is on the eastern side. It is fully 10 feet in\r\ndiameter, and formed of the same kind of rock as that on which the mesa\r\nrests 8 miles east of San Diego, viz: a green volcanic tuff. It is a\r\nvery interesting question as to how these immense bowlders have been\r\ntransported so far and left in the beds near the top of the cliffs. I\r\ncan account for it only by supposing that the point with relation to the\r\ncountry back of San Diego was several thousand feet lower at one time,\r\nand that a river of great volume, flowing over a steep channel, entered\r\nthe bay at this place, depositing irregular beds of bowlders. This old\r\nriver may have been the same one which formed the auriferous gravel\r\nchannel before mentioned. The fault planes on Point Loma extend through\r\nthe conglomerate beds, indicating that the elevation took place after\r\nthe bowlder beds were formed.\r\n\r\nAn interesting collection of fossils was gathered from the lowest strata\r\nexposed, and from the bowlders in the conglomerates. This collection\r\nnumbers something over sixty Cretaceous species, many of which are new.\r\nThe fossils are not abundant, nor are they well preserved. Nearly all of\r\nthese are characteristic Chico (Upper Cretaceous) fossils. There is,\r\nhowever, one species found here in considerable abundance, but rather\r\npoorly preserved, which Dr. White has described under the name of\r\n_Coralliochama Orcutti_, and which he has made the chief foundation for\r\na new division of the Cretaceous, termed the Wallala Beds. The name was\r\ngiven on account of the occurrence of this fossil, together with several\r\nother species, at or near Fort Ross, Sonoma County, and also at Todos\r\nSantos Bay, Lower California, where the best specimens were found. These\r\nbeds stand in an unknown relation to the other Cretaceous deposits\r\nstratigraphically, but have been supposed, on account of the fossils, to\r\nindicate a division between the Chico and Shasta groups. I believe,\r\nhowever, that the occurrence of the most important fossil of this\r\nsupposed division on Point Loma, in the same beds with undoubted Chico\r\nfossils, destroys the validity of the supposed Wallala Beds.\r\n\r\nIn a bluff at the northeastern end of the Point Loma peninsula, west of\r\nOld Town, there is a stratum of calcareous sandstone, carrying many\r\nfossils belonging to the Eocene, or lowest Tertiary. The strata dip\r\nnortheast at a small angle, and though they cannot be traced\r\ncontinuously west to the outcrops of Cretaceous rocks, yet from the fact\r\nthat they have the same dip, leads me to the belief that the two beds\r\nare conformable. This younger deposit corresponds to the Tejon, or\r\nDivision B, of Professor Whitney. Everywhere in the State there exists\r\nthe closest relation between the Chico and the Eocene. Here on Point\r\nLoma they are undoubtedly also conformable, but each is distinct as\r\nregards its fauna, for they are separated by nearly a thousand feet of\r\nunfossiliferous strata.\r\n\r\nFalse Bay occupies the basin of a synclinal, for the strata dip\r\nnortheasterly from Point Loma and south from the Soledad Hills. A\r\nviolent disturbance, forming a great uplifted fold or perhaps a fault,\r\nhas taken place along a line extending southeast from La Jolla through\r\nthe Soledad Hills. At the eastern end of False Bay there is a small\r\nexposure of Eocene strata, dipping west. Near the mouth of Rose Cañon\r\nthe strata dip southwest, and at the mouth of the cañon they dip 40°\r\nnortheast. Along the road which leads over the hills to La Jolla the\r\nrocks are tilted at a very high angle to the southwest. The highest\r\npoint of the Soledad Hills, rising 700 feet, lies over this disturbed\r\nregion. Unconsolidated bowlder deposits lie on the top of the hills. The\r\nstrata on the east side of Rose Cañon are well exposed, but do not seem\r\nto partake of the disturbance shown on the west. This is probably no\r\nunconformity, as they contain Eocene fossils, and the Eocene in other\r\nspots appears to be conformable with the Chico. Along the coast between\r\nFalse Bay and La Jolla the strata dip south at a small angle. At La\r\nJolla, near the caves, they have been folded so as to dip very steeply\r\nto the southwest for nearly a quarter of a mile across the strike. Near\r\nthe eastern end of the cliffs a reversal takes place, and they dip\r\nnortheast at nearly as great an angle. Around the little bay there are\r\nno exposures, but a mile northward begins a very high line of cliffs,\r\nwhich extend through to the mouth of Soledad Cañon. This fold at La\r\nJolla brings to the surface fossiliferous strata, bearing a number of\r\nspecies similar to those at Point Loma; among them is the _Coralliochama\r\nOrcutti_. The strata of the high cliffs north of La Jolla dip northerly\r\nat a small angle, and show only a few fossils of the Eocene age. The\r\ncliffs rise fully 400 feet. At the bottom of the cliffs are shales;\r\nhigher up are great beds of conglomerate bowlders, chiefly a reddish\r\nporphyry.\r\n\r\nCoal is reported to outcrop above the water at very low tide somewhere\r\nalong this stretch of cliffs. It of course must occur in strata of\r\nTertiary age. The coal vein struck in a boring at La Jolla must be\r\nCretaceous. About 3 miles up the coast from La Jolla, there appears a\r\ndike of basalt cutting the Tertiary shales. At high tide it is nearly\r\ncovered by the ocean. It has a course about 30° east of north, and\r\nstands vertical. It begins on the north, close in under the high cliffs,\r\nbut does not extend into them, the only signs being a fault in line with\r\nthe dike. It is not more than 2 feet wide at the northern point where it\r\nis exposed. It is dark and compact and so decayed as to be easily taken\r\nfor an argillite. The walls of the dike are very smooth and regular,\r\nexcept near the southern point, where it runs into the water. Here it\r\nswells to a width of 30 feet. The edges of the dike are compact, while\r\nthe vesicular portion is in the center, where there is often a flowage\r\nstructure developed. The central portion is more or less laminated\r\nparallel to the wall, and thus is generally a well-pronounced columnar\r\nstructure developed the whole width. The columns lie horizontally across\r\nthe dikes and are 12 to 15 inches in diameter. The cavities are wholly\r\nor in part filled with calcite. Metamorphism of the adjoining shales is\r\napparent for 2 feet away, but the sea water has so decomposed the shale\r\nthat it is not so strongly marked as it would otherwise be. The dike\r\nprojects above the water in places for a distance of 1,000 feet, making\r\nits total exposed length about 1,800 feet. In the mesa southeast of Rose\r\nCañon, and along the San Diego River, and back of San Diego, the\r\nformation belongs almost wholly to the late Tertiary. It is not certain\r\nwhether the Miocene is present or not. A number of Miocene fossils have\r\nbeen found in the county, but perhaps the most of them have come from\r\nCarrizo Creek. Many fossils are given in Dr. Cooper’s list, as being\r\nfound in the Pliocene of San Diego, which are more characteristic of the\r\nMiocene in other localities. I see no reason for doubting that the\r\nMiocene is present, but so intimately related to the Pliocene as to be\r\nstratigraphically inseparable from it. In the region between Rose Cañon\r\nand the northern boundary of the county, I do not know that Miocene\r\nfossils have been found, but in Orange County they are well\r\ncharacterized.\r\n\r\nThe region occupied by San Diego Bay and the mesa back of it is\r\ncomposed, as far as we know, of Quaternary, Pliocene, and perhaps\r\nMiocene strata. Sandstones characterize the lower formation, and loosely\r\ncemented conglomerates, increasing in thickness toward the mountains,\r\nthe upper. These were deposited in a sort of basin, of which Point Loma\r\nand the Soledad hills formed the northern and western borders. Many\r\noscillations of level have taken place, the most recent being an\r\nelevation of 40 feet, shown by an old beach line on Point Loma. The\r\nshells in this beach are the same as those now living in the adjoining\r\nocean. It is a peculiar fact that the mesas are slightly higher near\r\ntheir western terminations than farther east, indicating a recent uplift\r\nalong the ocean. Water is scarce through this mesa formation. At the end\r\nof Point Loma there is a strong sulphur spring exposed at low tide. Its\r\nwaters may possess medicinal properties, and should be examined.\r\n\r\nOn the southern shore of False Bay is a large deposit of calcareous\r\ntufa. The central portion is quite pure and a number of feet thick; just\r\nhow thick is not known. It extends along the shore some distance, and\r\noften contains bowlders and shells. This is evidently a deposit from\r\nsome former spring of great size. The mesas lying west of the extensive\r\nvolcanic tuffs have been derived largely from the decay of the latter,\r\nand have heavier soil. North of Soledad they become more sandy, and\r\nmaintain this character to the Santa Margarita Creek. This light soil,\r\nhowever, is being successfully cultivated in many places and for certain\r\nkinds of fruit, without irrigation. The surface of the higher portion of\r\nPoint Loma, as well as some of the mesas north, is covered with\r\nspherical nodules, a quarter to half an inch in diameter, of sand\r\ncemented with red oxide of iron. These literally cover the ground in\r\nplaces so that it is difficult to walk. The origin of these at first\r\nseemed very puzzling, but on examining the face of a cliff on the top of\r\nwhich these were found, an explanation was reached. They were seen to\r\ngrow smaller away from the surface of the ground until a depth of 2 feet\r\nwas reached, when they cease. Their formation is due to the oxidation of\r\nthe iron in the sandstone, and its segregation in little nodules on the\r\nsame principle as the formation of concretions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Eocene sandstone along the ocean grow gradually lower\r\nnorth of Soledad Cañon. At Encinitos the cliffs are higher again and for\r\na short distance the strata dip south, but toward Oceanside they resume\r\nthe northerly dip and disappear several miles south of that place.\r\nFaults grow less numerous the farther we get from Point Loma. The mesa\r\nis low about Oceanside; it was either never very prominent or else the\r\nerosion has been great.\r\n\r\nOn the north bank of the Santa Margarita Creek, near the ranch house, is\r\nan interesting cliff of Quaternary sands and gravel, showing a number of\r\nstrata deposited under different conditions on an old beach. (Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary beds north of the Santa Margarita Creek are very different\r\nin outline from those south. Instead of their extending in a gradual\r\nslope from the older mountains to the ocean, there arises in them, near\r\ntheir western border, a range of mountains, known as the San Onofre\r\nMountains. These extend parallel to the ocean at an average distance of\r\n2 miles. They rise north of the Santa Margarita Creek and extend to the\r\nSan Onofre Creek. They have a gradual slope on the west, rising to an\r\nelevation of 1,400 feet, but are quite abrupt on the east. Los Flores\r\nCreek cuts through the southern end of this range, showing that while\r\nthe soft, clayey sandstones between it and the Santa Margarita Mountains\r\nslope only 5° to 10° southwest, the rocks of the range itself dip west\r\nat an angle of 35° to 40°. The formation is a breccia, the fragments of\r\nwhich are argillitic, micaceous, and hornblendic schists. Some of these\r\nfragments are of great size, one bowlder of hornblende schist being 8\r\nfeet in diameter. Pebbles of white quartz and other hard metamorphics\r\nare also present. The soft, coarse sandstone in which the fragments are\r\nimbedded show no traces of any granitic matter. The range was ascended 2\r\nmiles north of the Los Flores ranch house, and found to consist entirely\r\nof fragmental schists, such as those mentioned, dipping southwest at an\r\nangle of 45°. The mountains were also climbed at their northern end,\r\nnear San Onofre Creek. Here there is a very abrupt escarpment on the\r\neastern side. The strata dip toward the ocean at a high angle, while the\r\nirregular hills and ridges of soft, light-colored sandstone lying east\r\ntoward the Santa Margarita Mountains are nearly level. After a careful\r\nstudy of the range the conclusion was reached that its origin was due to\r\na great fault, represented by the very abrupt eastern slope, tilting the\r\nelevated portion to the west at a high angle. I believe that this fault\r\ntook place after the deposition of the Tertiary strata. As far as my\r\nobservation went the Tertiary beds on the east do not rise to meet the\r\nSan Onofre range, as they would to a certain extent if it were present\r\nwhen they were deposited; on the contrary, they dip toward it. West of\r\nthe range the ocean is bordered by very high cliffs of Quaternary clays,\r\nand in only two or three places do the Tertiary rocks outcrop. Small\r\npatches of sandstone outcrop near the road at the western foot of the\r\nmountains; they also dip west at a high angle. Many of the fragments at\r\nthe northern end of the range show their derivation from a massive\r\ncrystalline rock. The hornblende schists are generally garnetiferous.\r\nBlue glaucophane schists are also very common. South of Mission Viejo\r\nCreek, Orange County, there is an outcrop of rock, apparently in place,\r\nwhich greatly resembles these schists. Good outlines of these mountains,\r\nindicative of structure, can be seen to great advantage from the San\r\nLuis Rey Mission. On the west slope of the San Onofre Mountains, 4 miles\r\nnorth of Los Flores, is an outcrop of a garnetiferous hornblende schist,\r\nwhich certainly appears to be in place. This rises 10 feet above the\r\nside of a gulch, and is fully 20 feet across. One mile north and in line\r\nof strike with the last is another outcrop of similar rock, which is so\r\nlarge that it certainly seems that it must be in place. The only point\r\nnorth of the San Onofre where this breccia appears is at Arch Beach,\r\nOrange County. The Santa Margarita Mountains are bordered by very\r\nextensive bowlder deposits, which rise as high as 1,500 feet on their\r\nwestern side.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the northwestern part of the county between Temecula,\r\nElsinore, and the ocean, is very complicated. This section is occupied\r\nby rugged, brush-covered mountains and narrow, deep valleys, with the\r\nexception of the Santa Rosa plateau, where the configuration of the\r\ncounty has been entirely changed by extensive lava eruptions, stretching\r\nover a distance of 10 miles. This mountain region narrows toward the\r\nnorth to form the Santa Ana range. The variety of rock formations is\r\nvery large. The northern portion is unsurveyed. On the south are the two\r\nlarge grants, the Santa Margarita and the Santa Rosa. Between these lies\r\nDe Luz Valley. The Santa Margarita Mountains extend north and south,\r\nforming the eastern borders of the grant and rising to an elevation of\r\n3,100 feet. The granite of the region about De Luz Valley is far from\r\nbeing homogeneous. A part of it is undoubtedly intrusive, and a part may\r\nrepresent an original sedimentary formation. Bedding planes are present\r\nin much of this supposed metamorphic granite, but generally no schistose\r\nstructure. The presence of the De Luz warm springs is perhaps due to a\r\ndike of dark, aphanitic diorite, which has cut through the granite in an\r\nirregular manner. A very interesting breccia outcrops in the bed of the\r\ncreek below the warm springs. (Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe fragments are chiefly granite and an aphanitic rock. They are quite\r\nangular, showing only a slight rounding of the corners. Some of the\r\nlarger fragments are a foot in diameter. The boundaries are very\r\nirregular. Long arms of the inclosing granite project into the breccia.\r\nThe base or matrix varies from a coarse syenitic rock to an aphanite. It\r\noften seems to present a blending of different kinds of fragments.\r\nBesides the large inclusions there are scattered through the matrix\r\nsmall angular pieces, which are so regular in outline and distribution\r\nas to give to the rock the appearance of a porphyritic structure. The\r\ngranite in the hills west of the valley contains much biotite and quartz\r\nin long, rounded grains, presenting a pseudo-porphyritic aspect. This\r\nappearance is characteristic of much of the granite of this section.\r\nImbedded in the granite are masses of dark aphanitic rock. The lower\r\ngranite hills are covered with considerable sandy soil. There are\r\nisolated peaks of a coarse white granite, much like that of the Sierra\r\nNevada, arranged in some sort of regularity in north and south lines.\r\nOne rugged peak of this coarse granite rises 2,500 feet west of the\r\nvalley. At the northern end of the valley the bedding planes in the\r\nfiner grained granites are very regular; strike north 45° west, dip 65°\r\nsouthwest. There is, however, no schistose structure present.\r\n\r\nA half mile above the warm springs is another conglomerate or tuff,\r\nwhich seems so related to the granite that the latter must really be\r\neruptive. In a little valley southwest of De Luz and just east of the\r\nSanta Margarita grant there is a large outcrop of diabase. It has been\r\nintruded in a fine-grained, jointed granite. Farther down the valley, on\r\nthe road to De Luz Station, there is a narrow outcrop of black quartz\r\nfeldspar porphyry, followed on the east by a dark felsitic mica schist;\r\nstrike northwest, dip 60° southwest. Immediately west of the deep canons\r\nwhich lead down to De Luz Creek, rises the Santa Margarita Mountains.\r\nThey consist of a fine-grained granite, verging at times on a quartz\r\nporphyry. The main crest is 2 miles long, the highest peak of which is\r\nnearly 3,200 feet. The rock is perfectly massive, but shows apparent\r\nbedding planes; strike north 30° west, dip 80° northeast. The\r\nporphyritic facies of this formation occur in the western slope. On the\r\nwestern slope of the main range, at an altitude of 2,500 feet, there is\r\na plateau-like area of a thousand acres or more of fine grass land. It\r\nis dotted with white oak trees. The western slope of this plateau is\r\nvery abrupt and brushy. The formation is partly porphyry and partly dark\r\ndiabase and diorite. The most interesting fact connected with the Santa\r\nMargarita range is the occurrence of sandstone at an elevation of 2,600\r\nfeet on its western slope. The sandstone occupies very limited detached\r\nareas in the heads of the gulches, and is evidently the remnant of a\r\nonce far more extensive formation. The sandstone is largely kaolinitic,\r\nand has evidently been derived from the adjoining rocks. At the foot of\r\nthe southern end of the mountains appears very quartzose rocks, probably\r\nof metamorphic origin. Coarse granite has been intruded into them in\r\nsmall bunches. Granite extends southwesterly in the form of a wedge as\r\nfar as the Santa Margarita ranch house, and is there covered by modern\r\ndeposits. Between De Luz and Fallbrook the country is gently rolling,\r\nwith knobs of granitic rocks projecting here and there. About Fallbrook,\r\nand for some distance east, the granite does not outcrop much, owing to\r\nits easy decomposition. A little east of De Luz Station is a small body\r\nof mica schist; dip 30° east, strike north 15° west.\r\n\r\nThe road from Fallbrook to Temecula leads through a long, narrow valley.\r\nOn either hand rise high mountains of bare granite. Immense bowlders, 20\r\nto 30 feet across, line the valley, having fallen from the cliffs. The\r\ngranite here is a coarse rock, rich in biotite, and though great masses\r\ncould be obtained free from checks, yet does not seem durable. The\r\nvalley owes its origin to a difference in rapidity of decay along\r\ncertain lines. On this section there appears no trace of the schist belt\r\nextending northwest from Julian. This coarse granite is undoubtedly\r\nintrusive and has cut it off.\r\n\r\nA wholly different series of rocks is exposed in the Temecula Cañon, not\r\nmore than 2 miles north of the country just described. This cañon is\r\ndeep and rocky, taking a very direct course from Temecula to the ocean.\r\nAt the upper entrance there is a narrow exposure of granite. This is\r\nfollowed by quartzite, dipping 45° southwest. The rocks shortly become\r\nmassive and are replaced by dark syenitic ones with an excess of\r\nhornblende. Two miles down, granite appears for a short distance, and in\r\nit a quarry has been opened. The rock can be obtained in blocks of any\r\nsize from great masses which have broken off and rolled into the cañon.\r\nGneissoid rocks soon replace the granite, and these are followed by\r\nhornblendic rocks, which vary from a schistose to a massive structure.\r\nIn places they contain feldspar and pass into syenites; in others the\r\nrock is almost pure hornblende. The greater portion of these rocks are\r\nof metamorphic origin. The dip is generally vertical, strike east and\r\nwest to northwest. The syenites are followed by mica schists, and these\r\nby coarse biotite granite about 5 miles above Howe Station. In the\r\ngranite are many pegmatitic veins, carrying biotite, garnets, and\r\ntourmaline. Fine-grained granite, varying at times to syenite, forms the\r\nrock along the cañon for many miles below this point.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting geological feature about this northwestern part of\r\nSan Diego County is the long plateau, confined chiefly to the Santa Rosa\r\ngrant. This plateau lies near the western corner of the grant, and\r\nextends east nearly to Murrieta. The lava is broken up into detached\r\ntables by erosion, which become very strongly pronounced toward the\r\nwestern end of the flow. The western body of lava is the highest. It has\r\na length of nearly 2 miles and is broken into three peaks or ridges,\r\nsloping generally a few degrees to the east; height 2,850 feet. There\r\nare two terrace-like tables lower down its southern slope. The lava is,\r\nperhaps, a hundred feet thick at its eastern end, and has been so much\r\neroded toward the western portion that the underlying sandstone is\r\nexposed along the crest of the ridge, with lava lying in broken masses\r\nalong its sides. The sandstones form quite an extensive bed under the\r\nlava flow, being 200 or 300 feet thick, and horizontally bedded,\r\nwherever bedding is present. The upper part is very soft and granular,\r\nthe lower portion is hard and stained reddish. It carries many bowlders\r\n6 to 8 inches in diameter, different from any other rock seen in the\r\nadjacent mountains: quartzite mica schist, aphanitic rocks, and some\r\ngranitic ones. These are washed smooth. The sandstones contain much\r\nkaolinitic matter, and at one spot show an incipient crystallization. A\r\nnumber of contiguous grains, over a space half an inch in diameter, show\r\nthe same orientation. Near the bottom the sandstones are impregnated\r\nwith iron. The western ridge in particular shows a great amount of\r\nerosion. The lava is nearly gone in places, but occurs southward in\r\nscattered outcrops for half a mile. At the northern end the sandstone\r\nrises fully 300 feet above the lava. Lava is present on its sides. Much\r\nof the sandstone closely resembles a granite decomposed _in situ_.\r\nFragments of the mica schist resemble that in the hills west of\r\nTemecula. Northward half a mile is the deep cañon of the San Mateo. The\r\ncountry descends very rapidly from the lava ridge, especially so on the\r\nnorth, where the cañon is fully 1,500 feet deep. It is a number of miles\r\nin any direction to mountains which are as high as this lava-capped\r\nsandstone ridge, and the amount of erosion must have been enormous since\r\nit was deposited. Mesa Redonda has an elevation of 2,750 feet, and is\r\nseparated from the lava just described by a valley fully 800 feet deep,\r\nand nearly a mile broad. Mesa Redonda is formed by a lava table,\r\nprobably basalt, 150 to 200 feet thick. It is quite precipitous on three\r\nsides. The lava is bedded, dipping 5° to 8° northeast. Underneath is a\r\nbody of coarse, friable sandstone, similar to that just described. Some\r\npebbles and bowlders of lava lie in the upper portion of the sandstone.\r\nThe sandstone consists of angular quartz grains and kaolinic matter, and\r\noften presents the appearance as if it had been partly fused by the\r\nlava. In the top of the sandstones are pebbles of quartz, feldspar, and\r\nmica schist. The sandstone shows no bedded structure, but seems to form\r\na mantle over the hill, following the irregularities of the underlying\r\ngranite. It descends 700 feet on the southern slope of the mountains\r\nwhich rise so abruptly from De Luz Valley. The lava has spread out in\r\nthin sheets on the southern slope of the mountain, descending more than\r\na thousand feet on the east side of Cottonwood Creek. These thin beds\r\nare not massive, but are formed of angular lava bowlders. The flows were\r\nso thin that they either broke up on cooling, or later through\r\natmospheric agencies. Fig. 15 is a sketch of Mesa Redonda from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nCienega Peak lies east of Mesa Redonda and is separated from it by two\r\ngulches opening in opposite directions. It has an elevation of 2,400\r\nfeet, and the mesas east rise still less. Sandstone underlies this as it\r\ndoes the other lava flows. Near the eastern end of the southern slope, a\r\nlava flow has broken out from a basin-like depression which opens\r\nsouthward, and flowed down the mountain for a mile, descending a\r\nvertical distance of 1,800 feet. It appears to have broken up entirely\r\ninto angular bowlders. The stream was probably very liquid, like the\r\nothers, and formed a thin flow. It takes a slightly winding course and\r\nslopes often 30°. One short branch appears on the western side about\r\nhalf way down, and another on the east near the bottom. The lava\r\ndescends in successive terraces, like steps, from the crater depression.\r\nThe width varies from 500 to 700 feet, terminating in a straight line\r\nabout a hundred feet above the bed of the cañon at the head of De Luz\r\nValley. This distance may represent the amount of erosion since the\r\nstream flowed. There are also cañons worn to some depth on each side.\r\nThe surface of the flow is rounding, and appearances indicate that it\r\ndescended over a surface not much different from the one now shown. A\r\nlarge part of the bowlders in the creek for several miles are lava. Fig.\r\n16 shows this lava stream as it lies on the mountain side, and also\r\nCienega Peak, from which it flowed. These lava beds appear very\r\nprominent from De Luz Valley. The long, winding flow is known locally as\r\nthe Oak Ridge, on account of its being covered with oaks, while the\r\nadjacent mountains are barren and brushy. It is hard to reconcile the\r\nappearance of these isolated peaks, with often precipitous sides, and\r\ndeep valleys between them, showing a great amount of erosion, with the\r\nthin sheets spread out on the southern side of the mountain in so many\r\nplaces, which from their position indicate so little erosion since they\r\nflowed. It is possible that the mesas, with the high precipitous cliffs,\r\nrepresent remnants of an older flow, and yet the lithological character\r\nof the lava seems to point to a single origin. With the exception of the\r\nlong southerly flow and another short one west of it, the lava\r\neverywhere presents bluffs on its southern side, with deep gulches\r\nbetween them. Toward the northeast and east there is a gentle slope. A\r\nlarge part is coarsely vesicular; dense massive portions are mixed\r\nirregularly in places with the vesicular. The lava table-lands lie\r\nnearly 2,000 feet above De Luz Valley. This abrupt escarpment extends\r\neast as far as the lava does, though less marked. There has either been\r\nan enormous erosion in the region lying south, or a great fault\r\nelevating the plateau. A detached portion of the lava plateau caps the\r\nhills west of Murrieta, extending in a north and south line for a\r\ndistance of 2 miles. Whether these detached portions all had their\r\nsource in one great flow and have been separated by erosion, or were\r\nformed from different sources, was not fully determined. It seems\r\nprobable, however, that the main portions did belong to one flow, from\r\nthe fact that they have a uniform slope and are underlaid by similar\r\nsandstone, which may once have been the bed of a stream.\r\n\r\nThe range of mountains lying west of the valley which extends from\r\nTemecula to Elsinore, also has the appearance of having been elevated by\r\na fault. From the entrance to the Temecula Cañon, northward past\r\nElsinore, and along the eastern base of the Santa Ana Mountains, these\r\nabrupt escarpments and indications of a fault become more pronounced.\r\nThe eastern part of the Santa Rosa plateau, with its lava fields, forms\r\nthe southern end of the escarpment. The valley in which are located the\r\ntowns of Temecula, Murrieta, and Wildomar, rises gradually toward the\r\neast. The western portion is very fertile. Artesian water is found at\r\nMurrieta. The eastern portion, which rises toward the granite mountains,\r\nis more gravelly, while east of Temescal there is a stretch of many\r\nmiles of these dry gravel hills, probably of Quaternary age. The town of\r\nTemecula has an elevation of 1,000 feet. Immediately west and north of\r\nthe cañon there arise hills of metamorphic rocks, having an elevation of\r\n1,800 feet. They are covered with dense brush on their eastern slopes,\r\nbut contain some fertile valleys to the west. For several miles the rock\r\nis almost wholly metamorphic. It extends south to the cañon and north to\r\nthe lava plateau. It is chiefly a fine, dark mica schist; strike\r\nindistinct but north 60° west, to east and west, dip vertical. On the\r\nwest it changes to a quartzite. Dikes of granite cut this rock; one is\r\nnoticeable for several miles by its more pronounced croppings over the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nEast of Murrieta the granite begins near the boundary of the grant, and\r\nforms a line of barren hills extending northerly. East of these the\r\ncountry is less rocky and quite fertile. Many springs abound in the\r\ngranite through this section. Near the Hot Springs is a dike of granite\r\nporphyry. Numerous bunches of a dark, coarse, dioritic rock are\r\nscattered through the light-colored country granite. They weather away\r\nmore slowly than the granite. The metamorphic rocks of the Santa Rosa\r\nplateau extend north to the entrance to the cañon, up which the road\r\npasses to Parker Deer’s. The strike in the cañon is a little east of\r\nnorth. The metamorphic rocks terminate in a range of hills which form\r\nthe southern boundary of the Rinconada. Northward the country is formed\r\nof rugged granite mountains. The Los Alamos opens westward into deep\r\ncañons, which lead down to the coast. A dark dioritic granite is\r\nincluded in the usual light-colored variety, sometimes in bowlder-like\r\nmasses and sometimes in dike form. The metamorphic rocks extend 2 miles\r\nwest of Parker Deer’s house. They include mica felsite and dark vitreous\r\nquartzite. They are often intruded by granite bosses and dikes of quartz\r\nporphyry. The lava table-land lies just south of the ranch house. It is\r\nabout 40 feet thick, and has underneath a kaolinic stratum 12 to 14 feet\r\nthick, which is impregnated with bog iron; one assay has shown 10 per\r\ncent. This is quite similar to the sandstone under the table-land\r\nfarther west, but is less quartzose. A similar deposit, impregnated with\r\niron, was seen north of Mesa Redonda. The Santa Rosa grant consists\r\nchiefly of broad, open valleys, having an altitude of 1,700 to 1,800\r\nfeet, with rocky ridges between them.\r\n\r\nOn the trail from Santa Rosa to Howe Station, the metamorphic rocks\r\nextend to within a mile and a half of the latter place. They are chiefly\r\nlight-colored, granular quartzites. Dikes of diabase and gabbro appear\r\nin many places on the Santa Rosa grant. Ores of gold, silver, and copper\r\nare found in the metamorphic rocks of the grant, but they have never\r\nbeen developed. Selected samples of galena assay several hundred dollars\r\nto the ton in silver. The veins are, however, small and bunchy, and it\r\nis not probable that they can be profitably worked. The granite varies\r\nfrom one with mica, as the only dark constituent, to one with much\r\nhornblende. It is uniformly coarse and of undoubted eruptive origin,\r\njudging from the manner in which it has broken through the metamorphic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe table-land west of Murrieta is about a mile broad and fully as high\r\nas that near Parker Deer’s house. It is separated from the lava farther\r\nwest by a mile of brush-covered hills. The lava was supposed to extend\r\nno farther than the big cañon west of Murrieta, but a close examination\r\nrevealed a small outcrop on the hills about a mile south of Wildomar.\r\nThe elevation is about 600 feet above the valley. It is perhaps one\r\nfourth of a mile across. In places it extends down the hill nearly one\r\nthird of its elevation above the valley. It presents the appearance of\r\nhaving flowed out of the summit of the hill when it had much the same\r\nform as now, and down over its sloping surface. This eruption is\r\nfine-grained, and not vesicular. Much of it has a conglomeritic\r\ncharacter, appearing to have been broken up when almost solid, and then\r\ncemented. The fragments are more or less rounded and elongated, and are\r\nat times almost blended in the matrix. There are signs of former\r\nsolfataric action on the summit, there being a considerable deposit of a\r\nlight yellowish material, consisting chiefly of alumina and magnesia.\r\nUnder the lava is sandstone 10 to 20 feet thick, composed of quartz\r\ngrains and kaolinic matter, exactly similar to that under Mesa Redonda.\r\nIt would be easily taken for granite decomposed in situ, but for the\r\nlarge quartz grains. The sandstone has an apparent southerly dip. It is\r\nvery difficult to account for the presence of the sandstone under the\r\nlava, unless we suppose it covered the adjacent country, and was only\r\npreserved by the greater permanency of the lava. Another hill of lava\r\nwas found 200 feet lower, about a mile south of this, and west of the\r\ncañon leading up to Parker Deer’s. It occupies a sort of depression\r\nbetween three hills, with gulches cutting into it between them. The lava\r\nis very similar to that just described.\r\n\r\nA long, high ridge running northwest and southeast, adjoining the lava,\r\nis very interesting. It is about 200 feet higher, and covered with dense\r\nbrush, as is all the country in this vicinity. The greater part of the\r\nhill is formed of a coarse tuff, whose fragments stand out in sharp\r\nrelief on the surface of the huge projecting, bowlder-like masses. The\r\nmatrix, which is darker and softer, weathers out, leaving the surface of\r\nthe rock covered with a great variety of fragments. Some are scoriaceous\r\nor amygdaloidal, others are very coarsely crystalline and porphyritic\r\nwith feldspar or hornblende. Some of the fragments are themselves\r\ntufaceous, containing large masses of hornblende in a dioritic matrix.\r\nOn the southern end of the hill, a great variety of dikes intersect the\r\ntufa. This is in all probability the neck of an old volcano, but appears\r\nto have no relation to the modern lavas near it. Owing to the exceeding\r\ndifficulty of traversing these hills, the exact relations of the\r\nformations were not ascertained. About 10 miles east of Temecula, near\r\nthe point where the creek takes a turn to the southeast and enters a\r\ncañon, there has been another lava eruption, but the time at my disposal\r\ndid not permit me to examine it. A great variety of rocks are exposed\r\nalong the road from Elsinore to Menifee Valley. For nearly 2 miles east\r\nof the station the rock is a white, glassy diorite, with an excess of\r\nfeldspar. At the point where the road crosses the railroad, metamorphic\r\nschists appear. The rock is a fine, dark mica felsite. It is so compact\r\nthat it breaks with a conchoidal fracture. A great irregularity in\r\nstrike and dip exists; the average strike is a little west of north, dip\r\nnortheast. As far as the top of the grade, the rocks are in part\r\nmetamorphic and part dioritic. There are many dikes; some fine-grained\r\ngranites, others micaceous diorite porphyrites. The hills along the west\r\nside of Menifee Valley seem to be mostly metamorphic, with some bunches\r\nand veins of granite.\r\n\r\nAll of the mountainous region lying south of the road from Temecula to\r\nSan Jacinto is granite or diorite, excepting a strip of micaceous schist\r\nand gneisses near Glen Oak Valley. These strike northwest toward\r\nMenifee.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity was given me to examine the mountainous regions comprised\r\nin the San Jacinto range. The line of hills lying northeast of the town\r\nand having a northwest direction are composed largely of gneiss and mica\r\nschist, with some bodies of white crystalline limestone. In the line of\r\nstrike these hills finally disappear north of San Jacinto Lake, under\r\nQuaternary clays and gravels, which form rather an abrupt rise from the\r\nSan Jacinto Valley and extend northerly to the San Bernardino Mountains.\r\nThe deposits show a great deal of disturbance. A part of them may be\r\nTertiary. Dikes of dark, heavy diabase and diorite are common about the\r\nsulphur springs north of San Jacinto.\r\n\r\nThe hills for a distance of 3 miles north of Elsinore are formed of\r\nslate and mica schists; strike north 70° west, dip vertical to 45° east.\r\nThis is a continuation of the same series of rocks exposed on the road\r\nto Menifee. A lenticular body of limestone occurs in these slates about\r\n3 miles north and east of Elsinore. It is highly metamorphosed, has a\r\ngray to dark color, and is traceable for 500 or 600 feet. At one spot a\r\nstratum of quartzite divides it. It was carefully examined for fossils,\r\nbut none were found. About 4 miles from Elsinore granitic rocks appear,\r\nfollowed by dark diorites in the vicinity of the Good Hope Mine. The\r\nPinacate district, taken as a whole, is rather peculiar. At first sight\r\nit seems to be formed of granite, dark diorite, gneiss, mica schist, and\r\nother metamorphic rocks, arranged in the most irregular manner. The belt\r\nof metamorphics northeast and east of Elsinore is terminated on an\r\nirregular east and west line by these granitic bodies, which inclose\r\nportions of the schists, and extend into the main body as long,\r\ndike-like arms. In the vicinity of the Good Hope Mine the strata of\r\nmetamorphic rocks inclosed in the granitic rocks have a north and south\r\nstrike, and are traceable for a mile or more. The veins of the Good Hope\r\nMine are in a dike of light-colored biotite granite. It has considerable\r\nwidth on the surface, 100 feet or more, but below ground some distance\r\nit is not over 12 feet. On the surface it is greatly decomposed and cut\r\nby numerous small veins, which are so scattered that they hardly pay for\r\nworking. Below they unite to form larger veins, generally one on the\r\nfoot and another nearer the hanging wall. The latter is more irregular,\r\noften running out at a small angle. The foot wall, a dark compact\r\ndiorite, is very regular. The walls are separated by well-defined clay\r\nseams from the vein matter, the decomposed granite. Clay seams also\r\nseparate the different veins. The foot wall diorite forms the country\r\nrock indefinitely eastward. The hanging wall is a fine, dark brown mica\r\nschist. The quartz is generally friable, and the granite vein matter\r\nmuch decomposed. The quartz at a depth of 300 feet carried one third of\r\nthe gold in the sulphurets. A small amount of silver is also found. This\r\nvein is located for over a mile; direction a little east of north, dip\r\n65° west. It is remarkable that there is no barren quartz; all the ore\r\npays for working. In the lower workings the veins become more regular.\r\n\r\nThe Good Hope is the first mine in this district to reach a paying\r\nbasis, and that has succeeded in finding a regular, defined quartz\r\nledge. About 3 miles northwest is another vein, which has an east and\r\nwest direction. It seems to lie wholly in granite, save for a narrow\r\nstratum of mica schist on one wall. The vein is located for a mile, but\r\nno extensive development has yet been made on it. On the hills, a short\r\ndistance southwest, is an old Mexican mining camp. Many small veins are\r\nfound in the vicinity, generally in a dark micaceous diorite. There are\r\nalso bunch-like masses of coarse white granite, blending into gneiss and\r\nthe gneiss into mica schist. The strike is exceedingly irregular,\r\nchanging from north and south to east and west in the course of a few\r\nfeet. Toward Elsinore mica schist, quartzose, and feldspathic rocks\r\nreplace the greater portion of the granite. For some distance the\r\nschists are cut up by dikes of fine-grained granite, running in\r\ndifferent directions, and small bunches of the same rock, often only a\r\nfew feet across, but sharply differentiated from the schists. Judging\r\nfrom the exposure here, I think we might say that at the time of the\r\nmetamorphism the action was so intense as to change the sedimentary\r\nrocks to mica schists and gneisses and through these to squeeze the\r\nliquified portions of the same formation in dikes and fissures. Small\r\nfragments of mica schist were noticed in the eruptive masses. In a\r\nregion like this it is often difficult to draw the line between eruptive\r\nand metamorphic rocks. It has been shown before that lamination is no\r\nsure indication of sedimentary structure.\r\n\r\nLake Elsinore is bordered on the west by a high and rugged granite\r\nrange. In the mountains west of Elsinore the granite which cuts off the\r\nmetamorphic rocks on the Santa Ana range is again replaced by the\r\nMetamorphic Series, which are here very greatly altered. They strike a\r\nlittle west of north and dip vertical or at a steep angle to the east.\r\nThe boundary of the granite is very irregular, and masses outcrop in the\r\nmetamorphics near the main contact line. Much of this crystalline rock\r\nperhaps more truly belongs to the diorites.\r\n\r\nThe new silver mines lie just north of the San Diego County line, and\r\nwest of the divide, a position which brings them into Orange County. The\r\nformations in which the veins occur vary from a dark brown felsite,\r\noften micaceous, to a finely banded quartzose rock. The latter is very\r\ncompact, and often almost massive. In places hard, blocky argillites\r\nappear. The two or more veins found here carry galena bearing silver,\r\nand also much magnetite and iron sulphurets, with some of the baser\r\nmetals. The veins are characterized by a dark red gossan cap on or near\r\nthe surface. Carbonates are found in this. These deposits exist as\r\nimpregnations along a fissure, which is not very strongly pronounced.\r\nThe ore is usually quite massive. The little gangue present is calcite.\r\nNot enough development has been made here at the time of my visit to\r\nshow how extensive the deposits are. The metamorphic rocks extend north\r\nalong the mountains, forming the summit and eastern slope for a number\r\nof miles. Granite borders them on the west toward San Juan. It is\r\nprobable that this belt of mineral-bearing rocks runs continuously\r\nthrough to Silverado Cañon. At some time this Elsinore basin opened out\r\nthrough the Temescal Valley, but now a low divide separates it from the\r\nhead of Temescal Creek. Gravel-topped hills lie along the mountains west\r\nof the creek. At the terra cotta works a drill was sunk over 600 feet\r\nwithout reaching the bottom of the basin. The Cheney Coal Mine is\r\nlocated 5 miles northwest of Elsinore, in the same basin. The beds dip\r\nto the west and southwest, having clay below, and sandstone followed by\r\nclay above. The coal is 7 to 8 feet thick, generally solid, but in\r\nplaces showing a parting in the middle. A great deal of faulting has\r\ntaken place, but there seems to be no system about it. The throw of the\r\nfaults sometimes amounts to 30 feet, often disturbing the pitch of the\r\nvein, and making it greater. The strata evidently belong to the\r\nMiocene-Tertiary, for a little farther down the valley fossils of that\r\nage are found. This old Tertiary valley, undoubtedly an arm of the sea,\r\nopened into the large valleys of San Bernardino and Los Angeles\r\nCounties, and extended southerly to Temecula; though south of Elsinore\r\nthe Tertiary is covered by Quaternary gravels. The depth is unknown, but\r\nthe width is quite narrow, being from 1 to 2 miles. Not more than a\r\nquarter of a mile northeast of the coal mine the metamorphic rocks,\r\nquartzites, and hard, blocky argillites outcrop. East of Temescal Creek\r\nnorthward the mountains are formed of a quartz feldspar porphyry of a\r\ndark gray color; at times it blends into portions not distinctly\r\nporphyritic.\r\n\r\nThree miles north of the San Diego County line granite appears again on\r\nthe east flank of the Santa Ana range and extends north to Cold Water\r\nCañon. Between Temescal Creek and the mountains is a broad, sloping\r\ngravel and bowlder deposit of great thickness, resting on the Tertiary.\r\nTwo miles south of the Temescal Post Office there is an outcrop of soft\r\nsandstone carrying Miocene fossils. It dips southwest at an angle of\r\n30°. Extensive clay banks of various colors and nearly horizontally\r\nbedded lie along the flanks of the mountains both east and west of the\r\ncreek. An interesting series of rocks is exposed up Cold Water Cañon.\r\nThis cañon has been eroded near the northern termination of the granitic\r\nportion of the Santa Ana Mountains. The first rock exposed is a\r\nmicaceous diorite, decomposed to a great depth, but very tough when\r\nfresh. This is followed by syenite. A mile up the cañon, near the\r\nwestern edge of this rock and wholly inclosed in it, is a small mass of\r\njasper schist and a lenticular body of semi-crystalline limestone. No\r\ntraces of fossils were found in it. West of the syenite is another\r\ndiorite dike. Then follows banded jaspery rocks, sometimes verging on\r\nmicaceous felsite or quartzites. There are also some slates, and all are\r\noften greatly contorted; strike north to northeast. North of the cañon\r\nthese rocks extend to the summit, while south the Santiago Peak, the\r\nhighest of the range, and the ridges leading up to it from the east,\r\nconsist of a coarse quartzose granite, with but little if any triclinic\r\nfeldspar. A variety of dikes occur near the summit north of the cañon,\r\namong them hornblende porphyry, porphyritic granite, and syenite.\r\nFossils were found on the ridge leading up to the summit, north of Cold\r\nWater Cañon. They occur in a grayish rock, apparently a fine micaceous\r\nfelsite. They are poorly preserved, on account of the extreme degree of\r\nmetamorphism to which the rocks have been subjected. The rocks have\r\nbecome so altered by pressure that they will not break on the lines of\r\nbedding, but perpendicular thereto. The fossils consist of impressions\r\nof a small bivalve shell. Only about a dozen specimens could be found.\r\nThe rocks are more altered than any others I have ever seen carrying\r\nfossils. These are the first fossils reported from the metamorphic rocks\r\nof the Santa Ana range. These fossils when determined will give a clue\r\nto the age of the metamorphic gold-bearing rocks of this portion of the\r\nState, and also of the granite, concerning which much diversity of\r\nopinion has existed.\r\n\r\nDawson Cañon, which heads in the Temescal Mountains, was explored and\r\nfound to contain interesting geological features. A fine opportunity is\r\ngiven for the study of the relation of the granite to the extensive\r\nporphyry intrusives. For 2 miles east of Temescal Creek no eruptives\r\nappear; the rocks being wholly of the Metamorphic Series, with exposures\r\nof highly altered sandstones, clay shale, conglomerates, etc., striking\r\nnorthwest and dipping southeast at 45° to 50°. About 3 miles up the\r\ncañon the argillaceous rocks are replaced by a coarse granite, rich in\r\nmica and quartz. This is the prevailing rock up the cañon for 2 miles,\r\nand it apparently extends much farther east. It shows a great variation\r\nin appearance; much of it contains large crystals of flesh-colored\r\northoclase. In this granite, particularly on the north side of the\r\ncañon, there are dikes of many kinds of rocks. Large dikes of beautiful\r\ndiorite porphyrites, both light and dark colored, appear in places. At\r\none spot 4 miles from the mouth of the cañon, there are rectilinear\r\ndikes of fine-grained granite, intersecting each other like artificial\r\nstone fences. For the distance of a mile east, after the granite begins\r\nin the cañon, the hills north show nothing but metamorphic schists. The\r\nporphyry in the mountains south does not reach the cañon. The great mass\r\nof this rock is dark, but in the vicinity of the granite it is lighter\r\ncolored and more feldspathic, sometimes assuming a granitic structure.\r\nIn places it is a gray, hard rock, of almost conchoidal fracture, and\r\nfaint feldspar crystals. The granite near the contact is usually sharply\r\ndefined, and has a faintly porphyritic appearance at times. The line of\r\njunction of the two formations is sharply defined, not only\r\nlithologically, but physically. It is difficult to say which is the\r\nolder. No granite appears in dikes in the porphyry, but there are many\r\ndikes of a porphyry-like appearance, resembling the light-colored\r\nporphyry in the granite itself. The line of junction is very irregular,\r\nand it is certain that the two formations do not belong to the same\r\neruptive mass.\r\n\r\nEast of the head of Dawson Cañon there is another outcrop of\r\nconsiderable extent of metamorphic rock, micaceous felsites, and other\r\ndark schists. A mile west of the Gavilan Mines is a high conical peak\r\nformed of coarse, dark diabase. The mines of this district are in white\r\nbiotite granite, continuous with that of the Pinacate district. The\r\nmetamorphic rocks south of Dawson Cañon strike east and west, dip north,\r\nand extend in a westerly direction nearly to Temescal Post Office. North\r\nof the cañon, 2 miles from its mouth, there are a number of outcrops in\r\nvein-like forms and in bunches, of a black crystalline material,\r\nevidently tourmaline, identical with that at the Temescal Mine. These\r\noccur in the metamorphic sandstone and shales. The next large cañon in\r\nthe Santa Ana range north of Cold Water Cañon shows highly disturbed\r\nTertiary strata at its mouth, dipping away from the range at a high\r\nangle. They are soft, white clayey deposits, containing small nodules of\r\nselenite. The first of the older rocks exposed in the cañon is a\r\nhornblende porphyry, with variations to a granular diorite. For 3 miles\r\nup the cañon the only rocks seen are crushed and silicified ones of the\r\nMetamorphic Series. They dip, as a usual thing, at a high angle to the\r\neast, though in spots it is to the west or horizontal. Quartzose\r\nsandstones prevail, with blocky argillitic rocks and conglomerates. Near\r\nthe summit there are dikes of green tufaceous porphyries.\r\n\r\nTemescal Valley is underlaid by clays of a great variety of colors. They\r\nare being used very extensively for the coarser kinds of pottery and\r\ndrain pipe. The Miocene deposits of the valley dip westward from the\r\nTemescal range, and instead of also dipping away from the Santa Ana\r\nMountains basin-like, they dip west into the latter range. The dip of\r\nthese beds 3 miles south of South Riverside is 5° to 10° southwest, and\r\nas the Santa Ana Mountains are approached the dip increases, and at a\r\ndistance of a fourth of a mile, up to the metamorphics, it varies from\r\n45° to vertical. The strata are not exposed all the distance across the\r\nvalley, but there is no sign of a fold or overthrow; everything seems to\r\npoint to a gradually increasing dip. This is indicative of an elevation\r\nof the region toward Temescal, or a sinking of the Santa Ana Mountains.\r\nThis is undoubtedly the fault line which follows the range for such a\r\nlong distance south. Several thin seams of coal outcrop for a distance\r\nof 10 miles along the base of the mountains. They have been opened in a\r\nnumber of places and all the strata found dipping into the mountains.\r\nThe coal seams are often only a few hundred feet away from the\r\nmetamorphics, and dip toward them at a very regular angle of 45°.\r\nJudging from the position of the strata it is not probable that the coal\r\nunderlies the valley, and as it is so close to the mountains, formed\r\nwholly of rocks of the Metamorphic Series, it cannot be of great extent.\r\nI believe that appearances point to the whole of the coal beds having\r\nbeen eroded, save the limited, steeply inclined portion at the foot of\r\nthe mountains. A crowding of the strata against the mountains during the\r\nmovements along the fault line, have given rise to the steep dip. The\r\nhighest portion of the Tertiary beds has an elevation of 1,500 feet. A\r\nvery even, gently sloping plain extends from this elevation toward South\r\nRiverside. It is formed of unconsolidated wash from the mountains,\r\ndeposited on and dipping in the opposite direction from the Tertiary.\r\nThe Tertiary formation consists of clays in various conditions of\r\nconsolidation, others chalky in appearance, and a great thickness of\r\nargillaceous quartz-sand loosely cemented. Poorly preserved fossils are\r\nfound in places. Near the southeastern corner of Mr. Hoag’s ranch is a\r\nhill with hardened concretionary sandstone outcropping around it. Nearly\r\nevery portion of this contains fragments of bones supposed to be\r\ncetacean. Artesian wells are obtained near Temescal Post Office at a\r\ndepth of 300 feet. The water is abundant and of excellent quality, and\r\nis flumed to South Riverside.\r\n\r\nBunches of granite outcrop in the metamorphic rocks along the east side\r\nof Temescal Creek north of Dawson Cañon. At the dam of the San Jacinto\r\nCompany there is a large outcrop of the beautiful diorite porphyrite,\r\nsimilar to that seen in Dawson Cañon. This extends northwesterly along\r\nTemescal Creek toward South Riverside, where it is quarried. It makes an\r\nexcellent and durable building stone, being compact and free from much\r\nmica or hornblende. West of this is a narrow strip of coarse granite,\r\nfollowed by diabase. North of Mr. Hoag’s ranch, and west of the dam, is\r\na dike of black porphyry. Westward the crystalline rocks are overlaid by\r\nthe Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe dam commenced across the Temescal Creek at this point, where it\r\nenters the cañon, was intended to have been extended down to the\r\nbedrock, and thus bring to the surface the water which flowed beneath\r\nthe surface channel. The diorite porphyrite is followed on the east by\r\nblack porphyry.\r\n\r\n_Geology of the Temescal Tin District._—The Temescal Tin Mine is located\r\nin the northern part of the San Jacinto grant, and about 5 miles\r\nsoutheast of South Riverside. This portion of the grant consists of\r\nrolling hills. On the west is a large body of porphyry, extending nearly\r\nto the Temescal Creek.\r\n\r\nThe first rock exposed along the road to the mine east of the creek is a\r\ndark flinty one. This is followed by a body of black porphyry, with\r\nwhite feldspar crystals. The porphyry is about a mile across, and is\r\nfollowed on the east by massive black crystalline rock, and that by a\r\nfelsite. These rocks are soon replaced by granite, in which there are\r\ndikes of fine-grained, highly quartzose granite. Little black veinlets\r\nof tourmaline aggregates are very numerous in the granite, extending\r\nthrough all the rock up to the porphyry. They have a northeast\r\ndirection. The material forming them is the same as the gangue of the\r\ntin veins. A half mile south of the road is a cañon. Here the porphyry\r\nis seen extending up to the granite. The granite is greatly broken near\r\nthe contact, and though there is no blending of one into the other,\r\nthere is a confused mixture of broken portions of both rocks. Bunches\r\nand dike-like bodies of granite are inclosed in the porphyry. The little\r\nveinlets of tourmaline seem to have replaced the feldspar and mica,\r\nleaving the quartz. These veins grow larger toward Cajalco Hill. Just\r\nwest of the works is a great mass of the black veinstone, the gangue of\r\nthe tin ore. This rises in high, rugged croppings, and covers an area of\r\nabout 300 by 250 feet. This is the greatest body of vein matter to be\r\nseen in the district. The tin deposit worked lies in an eastern\r\nprolongation of this cropping. The course of the veins is north 45°\r\neast, dip 65° to 70° northwest. The country rock is a coarse hornblendic\r\nbiotite granite. The vein has the usual character of mineral deposits,\r\nswelling at times to a width of 8 feet, and then contracting to much\r\nless. The highest grade ore is found in the narrower portions, where it\r\nis sometimes almost pure tin oxide, running as high as 70 per cent. The\r\nvein matter does not consist wholly of tourmaline, but contains quartz\r\ngrains scattered through it in about the same proportion as in the\r\ngranite. The tin is not found in the quartzose part of the gangue to any\r\nextent, but in the irregular vein-like deposits of pure tourmaline,\r\nwhich lie in the quartzose gangue. The tin occurs in this in bunches and\r\nstringers of nearly pure ore, or disseminated through it. This is\r\nparticularly the case where the width of the vein is 6 to 8 feet. Where\r\nit pinches, the whole vein is sometimes formed of the tourmaline\r\naggregate and tin ore. The vein has usually clay seams on both walls;\r\nsometimes it is frozen to one wall; wherever the walls come together and\r\ncut out the vein matter, the seams remain. The tourmaline vein matter is\r\nan aggregate of needle-like crystals. There are two varieties of tin\r\nore: the yellow, appearing in thin layers in an uncrystalline form; the\r\nbrown, in granular form in the massive specimens, or in small, clear,\r\nreddish brown crystals lining cavities. In the latter case it forms\r\nhandsome specimens. A small amount of arsenical pyrites is present in\r\nplaces in the vein, and iron pyrites in the granite. The quartzose\r\nportion of the vein matter often blends into the granite walls, and\r\nthere are bodies of evidently granitic origin wholly inclosed in the\r\nvein matter. A careful study of the vein matter, and its relation to the\r\nwalls, shows that it is simply a portion of the granite, in which the\r\nfeldspar and dark silicates, hornblende, and mica have been removed and\r\ntourmaline substituted. The quartz has the same character and color as\r\nthat in the granite, and many transition stages in the process are\r\nshown. Where the action has been more intense, near and along the\r\nfissures, the quartz has been wholly removed and the tourmaline\r\ndeposited, together with the tin. Cajalco was the center of this action.\r\nThe veins decrease in size farther away.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit the mine had been opened to a depth of 180 feet,\r\nby two working shafts. The total length opened on the vein is 300 feet.\r\nTwo levels have been run and work was in progress on the third. The main\r\nore body lies in the center of the workings, and extends downward in the\r\ndip of the veins. The ore milled averaged 5 per cent of tin oxide,\r\nthough large portions, as before stated, are very high grade. The\r\ncompany has also prospected Cajalco Hill by tunnel and open cuts, and\r\none or more of the veins south by shafts. At the time of my visit two of\r\nHusband’s pneumatic stamps were in operation. They weigh 900 pounds\r\neach, and drop one hundred and thirty-five times per minute.\r\n\r\nSouth and southeast of the works are many bunchy veins of the black tin\r\ngangue. They often carry considerable iron. They extend, generally\r\nnearly parallel, in a northeast and southwest direction. Some appear as\r\nmere bunches on the surface. These veins closely resemble the main vein\r\nat Cajalco Hill, and are due to the same action, and it has been\r\nsupposed that many of them will be found to carry tin, though it is not\r\npresent on the surface. About 2 miles south the granite is replaced by a\r\nbanded feldspar porphyry. This cuts off the tourmaline veins. The\r\ngranite about the works, and especially toward the contact with the\r\nporphyry, is cut by many dikes of a fine-grained granite, having an\r\nexcess of quartz and feldspar. Associated with the porphyry are strata\r\nof metamorphic rocks, of a hard, dark, quartzose character. A quarter of\r\na mile northwest of the mine is a bunch-like outcrop of porphyry,\r\ncarrying silver and copper carbonate. The black veins outcrop for a\r\ndistance of 2 miles northwest from the mine, extending into the\r\nporphyry, which replaces the granite in that direction. The granite\r\nextends eastward for many miles.\r\n\r\nThe general geological features which obtain here are: A semi-circular\r\narea of granite over 2 miles in diameter, surrounded on the northwest\r\nand south by porphyries and joined on the east to a great body of\r\ngranitic rocks extending indefinitely in that direction. Around the\r\nborder of this granite protuberance are many dikes of a fine-grained\r\ngranite. Cutting through the granite in a northeast and southwest\r\ndirection are the black tourmaline veins, which form the gangue of the\r\ntin ore when it is present.\r\n\r\nTin occurs here under conditions different from any other known deposit.\r\nTin veins are almost always found in granitic formations, but such an\r\nextensively developed tourmaline veinstone is remarkable. The direction\r\nof the fissure system shown here is an uncommon one in California. The\r\nveinstone, together with the associated metals, has probably resulted\r\nfrom a process of sublimation along lines of fracture, removing those\r\nportions of the granite easily affected, over a large area, as at\r\nCajalco Hill, and in the immediate contact completely replacing it with\r\nthe massive aggregate of minute tourmaline crystals.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to the manager, Captain Harris, for the facility freely\r\nafforded me for examining the mine, the works, and the country about.\r\n\r\nNorth of South Riverside the Tertiary beds dip at a small angle to the\r\nnorth. The Santa Ana River has cut its course through the hills at the\r\nnorthern end of the Santa Ana Mountains. No outcrop of the metamorphic\r\nrocks appears in the cañon. The Tertiary strata no longer dip toward the\r\nwest, but in the Chino hills north of the river show a great anticlinal\r\narch. Along the south side of the river the beds dip 70° northeast;\r\nfarther west, near the heart of the range, they dip 60° southwest,\r\nstrike north 30° west. Near the upper end of the cañon there are fault\r\nlines dipping toward the range, which show an elevation of the hanging\r\nwall. Bedrock Cañon is the first large one which opens to the Santa Ana\r\nRiver from the western slope of the mountains. Opposite the mouth of\r\nthis cañon the greatest amount of water appears in the bed of the river,\r\nindicating the presence of hard rock only a little distance below. Coal\r\nveins are located near the head of this cañon, one 700, the other one\r\n1,300 feet above the river. They dip only a few degrees to the\r\nsouthwest. They are exposed on cliffs facing the mountains to the\r\nnortheast. Below them are very hard sandstones carrying fossils,\r\nprobably Cretaceous. One prospect shows a number of seams within a width\r\nof 8 feet. The widest is 29 inches, the others much smaller. The other\r\nprospects show only one 39-inch seam. Their position, lying so flat high\r\non the mountains, indicates an uplift without great disturbance, while\r\nthe gypsum mines farther down on the flank of the mountains dip at a\r\nhigh angle to the southeast. It may be that all of the coal deposits of\r\nthe western slope of the Santa Ana Mountains belong to the Cretaceous,\r\nand have been greatly separated by faulting and folding. A deposit of\r\nwhite, granular gypsum has been opened in Gypsum Cañon, 2 miles south of\r\nthe river. The beds have a thickness of 8 or 10 feet. At one spot a\r\nlarge mass of crystalline dolomite was found. The deposits run with the\r\nstrata, north and south, and dip west 60°. As we approach Olive, the few\r\ncroppings seen still dip south or southwest, but at a less angle. South\r\nof the mouth of Silverado Cañon a line of hills extends north and south,\r\nbordering the Santa Ana Plain. The western portion of these hills is\r\nformed of basalt considerably decomposed. The basalt varies from\r\nscoriaceous to fine-grained and compact. Its eastern edge was seen to\r\nrest on Miocene sandstones, and it dips west at a small angle, perhaps\r\n10°. The lava seems to have been squeezed up in fissures, judging from\r\nthe way in which it outcrops. Its greatest elevation is 800 feet. At\r\nsome places the sandstones, where not covered with lava, have been\r\nsilicified, turned to quartzite, or rendered granitic in appearance.\r\nThis may be due to an intrusive neck of lava, or more probably to the\r\naction of thermal springs.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fold of the Tertiary strata was observed at the entrance\r\nof Santiago Cañon. The sandstones and conglomerates on the eastern side\r\ndip to the northeast at an angle of 30°, while those on the west side\r\ndip in the opposite direction. The valley has been eroded in the summit\r\nof an anticlinal. The rocks of the eastern side rise again against the\r\nside of the mountains, thus forming a synclinal. Up the cañon the\r\nsandstones on the west maintain a southwest dip of 45° to 50°, and\r\nstrike north 40° west. The cañon finally leaves the anticlinal, and the\r\nrocks dip southwest on both sides. Toward the summit of the hill, north\r\nof the Harris Coal Mine, the dip increases to 70°, but on the top they\r\nturn so that the strata lie horizontal. Here they consist of clay shale.\r\nThe strata at the coal mine swing around, and one mile northeast they\r\nstrike north and south and dip west. This hill seems to form the\r\nsouthern termination of the anticlinal ridge north of Santiago Cañon.\r\nSoutheast of this point there is a simple monoclinal fold or slope away\r\nfrom the older rocks of the high mountains. There has apparently been a\r\nfault extending northwest in this anticlinal ridge, bringing up the clay\r\nshales which farther south were shown to belong to the Cretaceous.\r\nHarris Coal Mine shows a seam 18 inches wide, shale forming the foot\r\nwall and sandstone the upper. There is a fault of 200 feet cutting this\r\ncoal seam. The sandstone at the mouth of Silverado Cañon dips south 30°,\r\nforming bold cliffs. A half mile up the cañon there are heavy beds of\r\nclay shale inclosed in the sandstone. Cretaceous fossils appear in the\r\nshales, as well as in a coarse sandstone which underlies them. This\r\nsandstone is replaced by conglomerates near the contact with the\r\nunderlying Metamorphic Series. The sandstone rises to a height of 2,500\r\nfeet, with bold, almost perpendicular cliffs facing the mountains.\r\nPortions of the sandstone containing the fossils are often very much\r\nhardened.\r\n\r\nThe first crystalline rocks met are dark and fine grained, with traces\r\nof bowlder-like inclusions, and are evidently eruptive tuffs. Above\r\nthese are green, dioritic rocks. These intrusives are followed for\r\nseveral miles by sandstone and shale, in which the stratification is\r\noften obliterated. In other places thin layers of sandstone and shale\r\nare wonderfully contorted. The dip is at a high angle either east or\r\nwest. In the vicinity of the old Silverado Camp there are dikes and\r\nbunches of a green dioritic rock. The mines in the Silverado district\r\nare again being developed to some extent. The mineral belt is about 2\r\nmiles wide, and extends nearly north and south. The country is formed to\r\na great extent of dikes of greenish to blackish rocks, often showing\r\ndistinct hornblende crystals. The dip of the metamorphic rocks is east\r\nabout 45°. There is one main mineral vein located, beginning about a\r\nmile north of Silverado, and extending in a southerly direction for 7 or\r\n8 miles. The Quincy Mine is one of the most northern ones. The vein has\r\na width of 2 feet; the ore, silver-bearing galena in a calcite gangue.\r\nIt carries but little base metal of any kind. The ore has a peculiar\r\nappearance, the galena being distributed through the gangue in little\r\nleafy crystals or aggregates. The fissure is well defined and regular,\r\nwith a pale green syenitic rock on the hanging wall, and a dark diorite\r\non the foot wall. This hanging wall rock weathers to a light gray color,\r\nproducing a rock known as porphyry among the miners. South of this mine\r\na side vein carries much antimony. The Quincy has been opened along a\r\nlength of 500 feet. The ore is quite uniform, producing one eighth in\r\nconcentrates. The Quincy camp has an elevation of 2,300 feet. South of\r\nSilverado Cañon, in Silver and Pine Cañons, a great amount of work was\r\ndone during the former excitement. The sides of the steep, rocky cañons\r\nare fairly honey-combed with tunnels, which were undertaken without\r\nsufficient prospecting, and, of course, never struck anything. The New\r\nYork Mine spent much money, but did not prove a success. West is the\r\nPrincess, and farther still, about 1,200 feet above the cañon, is the\r\nBlue Light Mine, on which much work has been done and rich ore taken\r\nout. The mines south of the cañon are in a feldspathic rock, which\r\nweathers white. It is undoubtedly an intrusive porphyry, for traces of\r\nfeldspar crystals are to be seen. The mines are characterized by a large\r\namount of zinc-blende, iron pyrites, and not a large percentage of lead,\r\nmaking them more difficult to reduce. The porphyry is mineralized in\r\nmany places where no traces of the precious metals occur. Litigation and\r\npoor management seem to be the chief factors in stopping work in this\r\ndistrict. Though some of the ore runs into hundreds of dollars to the\r\nton, the most of it is medium to low grade.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half down the cañon from the old Silver Post Office,\r\nand in a cañon coming in from the south, is a cropping of dark, somewhat\r\nargillaceous limestone inclosed in shales. The limestone does not seem\r\nto have been highly metamorphosed, yet the fossils which it contains are\r\nalmost obliterated. The faint impressions are those of coral stems,\r\nstromatopora, and some other low forms of life. Half a mile farther down\r\nthe cañon is a cropping of brecciated marble. At many points,\r\nparticularly on the north side of the cañon, there are great masses of\r\napparently conglomeritic character, but with a crystalline structure.\r\nThe matrix has a green to brown color, and in it are imbedded pebbles of\r\nthe same degree of fineness, but often distinguished by much brighter\r\nred, purple, and green colors. In this cañon, as in others of this\r\nrange, the water holds much lime in solution, and extensive tufas are\r\nfrequently to be seen. The basal members of the Cretaceous at the mouth\r\nof Silverado Cañon consist of conglomerates passing up into sandstone,\r\nand those into shales; dip 55° away from the mountains in the highest\r\nridge, but in the course of a quarter of a mile becoming much less. The\r\nchange in dip is very sharp, giving the appearance of a fault.\r\n\r\nA cañon which enters Silverado Cañon from the northeast near its mouth\r\nwas followed up nearly to its head for the purpose of investigating some\r\nlimestone outcrops. The first outcrop in this cañon is the usual dark\r\nporphyry. Beyond this the stream has cut a deep cañon through an immense\r\nconglomerate of porphyritic and quartzose pebbles. The porphyritic\r\npebbles are dioritic and part red and black porphyries. Some of them are\r\nsimilar to dikes farther up the mountains. Through this great\r\nconglomerate bed there are dikes of black porphyry, with pale feldspar.\r\nTufaceous porphyries form a large part of these dikes. The base is\r\npurple and the pebbles light green, or the reverse. These conglomeritic\r\nporphyries differ from the great beds of sedimentary origin, in having\r\nall the pebbles of a uniform character with a crystalline matrix. The\r\nsedimentary beds contain pebbles of all sizes and description, in a\r\nmatrix of small pebbles or coarse sand. Farther up the cañon the great\r\nbody of the rock is crushed shale and black to gray sandstone; dip\r\nvertical, inclining most generally to the east, strike north and south.\r\nTwo miles up the cañon is a dike of diorite porphyrite, coarse in the\r\nmiddle and fine on the edges. Four miles up is a stratum of gray\r\nlimestone. More outcrops appear on the north side of the cañon, but\r\nwhether they belong to the same stratum or different cannot be told, on\r\naccount of the crushing undergone. These deposits are bunchy, swelling\r\nin one case to a width of 100 feet. It is not crystalline. The color is\r\nfrom black to gray. It contains fine specimens of a bivalve shell, and\r\nfaint traces of corals and univalve shells. These beds are said to\r\nextend to the summit, and undoubtedly further examination would reveal\r\nmore fossils. Several specimens were sent to the National Museum and\r\npronounced Carboniferous in age. We have here, then, the first\r\nannouncement of the age of the Santa Ana range. This range stands in\r\nsuch intimate relation to the granite and crystalline schists farther\r\nsouth, that an approximate determination of the latter is made possible.\r\nProfessor Whitney and others following him have classified this range as\r\nCretaceous. Their grounds are utterly untenable stratigraphically, but\r\nthis discovery of Carboniferous fossils makes the evidence of greater\r\nage certain.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the range, near its northern end, the sandstones\r\nwere observed to be silicified, being filled with a network of quartz\r\nveinlets, exactly similar to the silicification of the metamorphic rocks\r\nof the Coast Range proper.\r\n\r\nThe lowest Cretaceous beds are between Silverado and Williams Cañons,\r\nbut the fossils are very similar to those generally found through the\r\nCretaceous of this region. The lowest beds are a duplicate of those seen\r\nat the mouth of the Silverado Cañon, though apparently a thousand feet\r\nlower in the series. Between the two beds there is another conglomerate\r\nstratum, carrying bowlders different from any seen in the Santa Ana\r\nMountains. Many of the porphyry bowlders in the basal Cretaceous\r\nconglomerates resemble the porphyry about Temescal. The Santa Clara Coal\r\nMine, at the mouth of Silverado Cañon, is undoubtedly in strata of\r\nCretaceous age, though no fossils are found in the strata above till the\r\nMiocene is reached. Up the Santiago Cañon as far as Madame Modjeska’s\r\nplace, the fossils are chiefly confined to the eastern side of the\r\ncañon, but the character, dip, and strike of the strata on both sides\r\nare the same. The Cretaceous is separated from the metamorphics by a\r\nline of cross cañons. The highest portions of the Cretaceous terminate\r\nin a line of hills with sharp eastern escarpments.\r\n\r\nShrewsbury Cañon comes in just below Modjeska’s. After passing the\r\nCretaceous, through which the cañon has cut, the Metamorphic Series was\r\nseen to consist of slates and sandstones, followed by light-colored\r\ngranitic rocks, chiefly hornblende and triclinic feldspar. The\r\nmetamorphic rocks generally dip to the east.\r\n\r\nA mile above Modjeska’s the Santiago Cañon cuts through bold cliffs of\r\nCretaceous sandstones and conglomerates, and higher up still has eroded\r\na cañon in the Metamorphic Series. The cliffs, a little back from the\r\nstream, rise probably 1,000 feet. Sandstone belonging to the Metamorphic\r\nSeries outcrops in the cañon for some distance, and is followed by\r\nconglomeritic porphyries, containing purple and red bowlders. In some\r\nplaces the inclusions are angular. These rocks are extensively developed\r\nabout the Santiago Mines and higher up in the mountains.\r\n\r\nJust below the Alma Mine, on its western side, the creek has cut through\r\ndikes of diorite, which are coarse in the center and fine on the edges.\r\nOn the hill south of the Alma Mine the diorite is on the opposite or\r\neastern side of the vein. Although the exposures are poor, all the\r\ncrystalline rocks have the character of intrusives. No blending into the\r\nmetamorphic rocks has been noticed. About 3 miles up Shrewsbury Cañon\r\nseveral claims are located on the southern continuation of the veins of\r\nthe Silverado district. Near the head of Santiago Cañon these again\r\nappear well defined, and considerable active work was going on here at\r\nthe time of my visit. The veins here have a direction a little east of\r\nsouth, dipping to the east somewhat less than 45°. It appears that the\r\nmineral belt follows a certain line, generally quite regular, without\r\nany particular reference to the dikes and bunches of intrusives\r\nscattered irregularly here and there. The fissure system has taken a\r\ncomparatively regular line and the walls may or may not be intrusive.\r\nThe Alma Mine, the northern claim of the Santiago Silver Mining Company,\r\nhas been worked by the former operators in a very irregular manner. The\r\nveins and stringers as far as exposed lie wholly in the crushed\r\nquartzose argillites. A tunnel is now being run to open what is supposed\r\nto be the main vein, several hundred feet farther east, and which has\r\nsyenite on the hanging wall. Other tunnels are being run along the\r\ncreek, one near a body of granitoid rocks, others in slate or quartzite.\r\nThe ore is a leafy galena, arranged often in narrow bands with the\r\ncrystalline orientation different in alternating bands. Sometimes it\r\noccurs in the form of large solid bunches. Thus far the ore deposits\r\nhave been found quite irregular, but it is thought that the main body\r\nhas not yet been reached. Very little base metal is present. South, on\r\nthe hill, the Morrow claims have been bonded by the same company and are\r\nbeing opened. On the summit of the hill diorite lies on the eastern side\r\nof the veins. Down the southern slope the veins lie wholly in\r\nmetamorphic rocks; the foot wall being more silicious, the hanging\r\nargillaceous. The mineralized portion has a width of 20 feet. A small\r\nvein occurs in the upper side, and a heavier one, sometimes reaching 3\r\nfeet, on the foot wall. There are occasional stringers in the crushed\r\nportions between. The gangue is calcite, with some quartz, all mixed\r\nwith the broken clayey slates. More zinc-blende and iron pyrites are\r\nfound here, also a little antimony. In the Alma Mine the richest galena\r\nis very fine, and sometimes resembles antimonial ores.\r\n\r\nSouth of these mines, toward Trabuco Cañon, another claim is being\r\nworked. South of the Trabuco the conglomerates hide the lode, except at\r\none spot, where it appears and has been worked. The Cretaceous formation\r\ngrows lower as the Trabuco is approached, and does not appear prominent\r\nsouth of it. In all probability it is covered by the Tertiary, for the\r\nelevation and consequent erosion have not been as great in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                By W. H. Storms, Assistant in the Field.\r\n\r\nNo portion of California has more diversified mineral wealth than the\r\ncounty of San Bernardino. Although its area is comprised largely of\r\nrugged mountains and desert waste, yet this county is a producer of\r\ngold, silver, copper, lead, and tin, and contains mines of zinc, iron,\r\nand manganese, besides deposits of borax, salt, soda, baryta, gypsum,\r\nsulphur, onyx, marble, asbestos, and structural material, granite, and\r\nsandstone of great beauty and value. Within its borders are found a wide\r\nrange of geological formations from Paleozoic (if not Archæan) to\r\nTertiary, and a great variety of rocks of igneous origin.\r\n\r\nThe mines are scattered all over its thousands of square miles of\r\nterritory, and have already added millions of dollars to the wealth of\r\nthe State and the world. Many of its mines are of phenomenal richness,\r\nand were it not for the expense and extreme difficulty attending\r\ntransportation in the desert, San Bernardino County would undoubtedly\r\ntake first place in adding to the mineral wealth of California. The\r\nlargest and most productive section in the county at present is\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE CALICO MINING DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nNo region affords better opportunities for the study of a certain class\r\nof ore deposits occurring in eruptive and fragmental rocks than may be\r\nfound in the Calico District. The mines, condemned at first, came\r\nquickly to the front nevertheless, and have for the past twelve years\r\nbeen steady producers of silver bullion. The district is situated 6\r\nmiles north of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, the nearest station\r\nbeing Daggett.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     GENERAL GEOLOGY OF THE REGION.\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Calico Mountains at first sight looks simple enough,\r\nbut a more thorough investigation quickly convinced me that there were\r\nstructural problems to be studied of more than passing importance, as\r\nthey seemed to have a bearing upon the extent of the ore deposits. The\r\nmost complex region is that immediately about the town of Calico, in the\r\nvicinity of the mines. The balance of the mountain area is more simple.\r\n\r\nIn a general way the Calico uplift consists of a core of massive\r\nrhyolite, overlying which are heavy deposits of light-colored breccia\r\nand tufa. Along the flanks of the range, and in some places extending\r\nwell up into the mountains, are accumulations of undoubted sedimentary\r\norigin, sandstone, sandy shales, and argillaceous rocks, which, with\r\nsome local exceptions, dip away from the central mass on all sides\r\ntoward the desert plain. While in the district I made some notes on the\r\ngeneral geological features, but not having sufficient time at my\r\ndisposal to complete these investigations, I have determined not to\r\npresent my views until I have had an opportunity to investigate the\r\nregion more carefully.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the uplift of these mountains, erosion has carved deep\r\ncañons and removed great mountain masses. The central area is now\r\nentirely denuded, whereas it was at one time covered with from 100 to\r\n200 feet of tufa and upward of 1,000 feet of sedimentary strata. Not\r\nonly have these more recent accumulations been removed, but a large\r\namount of the hard, dense liparite has also been disintegrated and\r\ncarried away by the violent storms which are characteristic of the\r\ndesert. Faults are very numerous throughout that portion of the\r\nmountains lying along the south side of the range. They extend for at\r\nleast 10 miles in an easterly and westerly direction. The mines occur\r\nalong this faulted zone.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the region are a violet to brown rhyolite, often\r\nporphyritic; green, yellow, and white tufa; yellowish and greenish\r\nbreccia; a greenish gray, fine-grained rock, which has been called\r\nhornblende andesite by Mr. Lindgren, and a yellowish or buff to light\r\ngray felsitic rock, which may be either rhyolite or an older felsite. It\r\nis extremely difficult to distinguish between these rocks, even with the\r\naid of thin sections under the microscope. I think, however, upon\r\nstructural grounds, that I may call the rock felsite. As this is one of\r\nthe important questions upon which I have not thoroughly satisfied\r\nmyself, it will be left until such time as I have opportunity to make\r\nthe necessary investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ORE DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the ore deposits in the Calico District has been a\r\nsubject of much discussion, and the question has received the closest\r\nstudy and thorough investigation. In my opinion, the ore deposits were\r\nformed through the agency of percolating waters carrying mineral\r\nsolutions, which deposited their contents along fault planes and in\r\ncertain zones of the country rock, where its brecciated and crushed\r\nstate offered superior conditions for the deposit of the silver ores and\r\nthe accompanying baryta. That all of these ore deposits have a common\r\ngenesis I do not doubt, whether they occur in the liparite, in the tufa,\r\nor in the “mud” overhanging country rock, as is the case at the\r\nBismarck, Humbug, Waterloo, and some other mines. The form of the\r\ndeposits differ somewhat, it is true, for we find the reticulated veins\r\nin the King Mine; the segregated deposits in the Odessa and Waterloo;\r\nthe fissures in the Langtry, in West Calico, and the impregnated deposit\r\nin the Humbug. However, all the deposits of the district, of whatever\r\nform, I believe are due to a common cause, having been deposited in\r\ntheir various forms from mineral-bearing solutions which derived their\r\ncontents from the neighboring eruptive rocks (the liparites and tufas),\r\npart of the material doubtless arising from great depth, and a portion\r\ncoming from the adjacent inclosing rocks by what is known as lateral\r\nsecretion. It is almost an impossibility to find in the Calico region a\r\npiece of rock that does not contain more or less silver, from a fraction\r\nof an ounce per ton upward.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of ore deposition was very thoroughly investigated by\r\nMessrs. Louis Janin, E.M., John Hays Hammond, E.M., Ross E. Browne,\r\nE.M., and Wm. Irelan, Jr., State Mineralogist, at the time of the\r\nlawsuit of John S. Doe vs. Waterloo Mining Company. These gentlemen all\r\nagreed upon the origin of the ore deposits, and their opinions coincide\r\nwith my own and are in accordance with the ideas expressed above. The\r\nwide difference in the size and form of the many ore bodies does not in\r\nany manner conflict with the theory that in each instance the primary\r\ncause of the deposit was a fracturing and crushing of the rock masses\r\nand the subsequent infiltration of mineral solutions, which precipitated\r\ntheir contents in the zones and crevices thus prepared for their\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _SKETCH SHOWING\r\n    DISTRIBUTION OF ORE ON THE SURFACE IN THE\r\n    SILVER KING MINE\r\n    AS IT OCCURS BETWEEN THE FAULT PLANES\r\n    CALICO MINING DISTRICT\r\n    SAN BERNARDINO CO. CAL.\r\n    COPIED FROM EXHIBIT “R”\r\n    COURT RECORDS IN THE SUIT OF\r\n    JOHN S. DOE VS. WATERLOO MINING CO._]\r\n\r\nIn the Silver King Mine occurs a perfect network of veins, concerning\r\nwhich Mr. Hammond testified: “At the time of the uplifting of the\r\nliparite, or at some subsequent time, a fault occurred, which separated\r\na wedge-like mass of liparite from the main mountain mass, and this\r\nfault plane was generally conceded to be what might be termed the foot\r\nwall of the mineral belt, or zone, or lode. Contemporaneously with this\r\nfaulting a second fault occurred, which separated the overlying brown\r\ntufa from the liparite, which fissure forms the overhanging wall of the\r\nmineral deposits of the Silver King Mine. At the same time cross\r\nfissures were formed in the liparite mass between the two main fissures.\r\nThus there was a main fissure or plane of contact between the brown tufa\r\nand the liparite, and a similar fault plane between the segment of\r\nliparite broken off and the main mass of the mountain. Between these two\r\nmain fissures, and throughout the whole mass of this segment of liparite\r\nwere innumerable fissures, some similar and equal in size to the main\r\nfissures, and others forming a finer system of fissures and cracks,\r\nextending through the rocks in all directions, leaving it in a broken\r\nand disintegrated, and in many places an almost pulverized condition.\r\nAlthough these finer fissures generally had a parallelism with the two\r\nmain fissures bounding this segment of rock, yet, in many places, these\r\nfiner seams or fissures run in every direction through the rock, forming\r\na network, or reticulated mass. The mineral-bearing waters have\r\ndeposited throughout this mass, from wall to wall, the minerals now\r\nfound within this zone in the form of baryta, carrying silver. The\r\nfinding of baryta in the shattered planes of the liparite, which is\r\nentirely foreign to the rock itself, is sufficient evidence that a crack\r\nor space must have existed prior to its deposition, from the solutions\r\nwhich penetrated this broken zone of a once massive rock formation.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _CROSS SECTIONS OF\r\n    SILVER KING MINE\r\n    TAKEN FROM COURT RECORDS IN SUIT OF\r\n    JOHN S.

In each of these mines, as in many others, the ore\r\nbodies are found in bunches or pockets, varying from little deposits of\r\nnominal value to great ore chambers containing thousands of tons of pay\r\nrock. In these cases, as at the King Mine, a system of faulting planes\r\nmarks the general strike of a mineral-bearing zone or lode, but the\r\ngreat rock masses of tufa, in which these ore bodies occur (and also of\r\nsandstone in the Waterloo), are quite loose and porous in texture, and\r\nundoubtedly the ore bodies in these mines resulted partially, at least,\r\nfrom the impregnation of the rock with the mineral solutions which found\r\nan easy passage along the fault planes that had cut the rocks in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn the Waterloo Mine one of the fault planes exhibited a regularity\r\nseldom seen in any mine. It coursed through the light-colored, soft tufa\r\nin an easterly and westerly direction, was perfectly true, and as smooth\r\nas any hard-finished wall could be made by the most skillful artisan.\r\nThe fracture was of knife-blade thinness, and its sides were coated with\r\ndark red iron oxide. It dipped to the southward at an angle of about\r\n40°. At one time it was considered to be the hanging wall of the lode,\r\nbut a miner broke through the wall to cut a hitch for a timber and it\r\nwas found that the overlying rock beyond the slip was ore-bearing also.\r\nStopes in this mine were frequently over ten sets in width, or over 60\r\nfeet. At the eastern end of the claim some extremely rich ore was mined\r\nfrom a belt of jasper, a metamorphosed clay shale, which by heat and\r\npressure had become an intensely hard, fine-grained, flinty rock, yet\r\nsome of this jasper contained over 1,000 ounces of silver per ton.\r\n\r\nIn West Calico, 2 miles west of the Waterloo, is the Langtry group of\r\nclaims. The principal development is on the west end of the Langtry\r\nMine. The Langtry may be called the anomaly of the camp, as it is a\r\nfissure vein pure and simple, or, more strictly speaking, two fissures.\r\n\r\nThe strike of these two fissures, which are 60 feet apart, is nearly\r\nparallel, but they will undoubtedly meet in depth. That on the south\r\nside dips northerly, while the other pitches toward the south slightly.\r\nBoth stand at a high angle, and it is doubtful if they will converge\r\ninside of 250 feet from the surface. The veins are composed principally\r\nof a coarsely crystallized baryta with quartz, containing brown iron\r\noxides, lead carbonate, ochre, manganese oxide, and chloride of silver.\r\nThe average value of the ore was about 22 ounces per ton. The veins vary\r\nfrom a thin seam to over 10 feet in width on the north vein, having an\r\naverage width of 3 or 4 feet. These veins occur in the “outside” or\r\n“mud” country, which lies along the flank of the southern slope of the\r\nCalico Mountains. The mud shales and argillaceous sandstones here lie\r\nnearly horizontal, the veins cutting them at an angle closely\r\napproximating 90°.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUSPENDED MINING OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe low price of silver during the past two years has resulted\r\ndisastrously to the mining industry in Calico District. The great\r\nWaterloo, for many years the largest producer, and employing not less\r\nthan 150 men in mines and mills, was closed down, as it seemed foolhardy\r\nto exhaust the great ore bodies when the profit derived from the\r\nextraction and milling of the ores was merely nominal. For years these\r\nmines had kept the sixty-stamp Boss process mill and the fifteen-stamp\r\npan mill at Daggett busy night and day, but in the spring of 1892 the\r\nstamps were hung up and the mines closed, awaiting better prices for\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe Silver King Mining Company (limited), of London, has continued to\r\noperate, dropping twenty to thirty stamps night and day, under the\r\nsuperintendency of William S. Edwards. The King Company owns or controls\r\nthree important groups of mines in this district, viz.: the Odessa, the\r\nOriental, and the Occidental. The Odessa made a record during the early\r\nhistory of the camp by the production of ores of high grade. The policy\r\nwhich was pursued in those “palmy days”—to gouge out the rich ore\r\nwhenever it could be found, without regard to future condition of the\r\nmine—left most of the mines in very bad shape. The Odessa is now\r\nrecovering under the new management, and the property is being\r\nsystematically opened, and it is thought all the ore can be extracted.\r\nIn this mine are stopes from which thousands of tons of ore have been\r\nmined, and there is not a stick of timber of any kind in them.\r\n\r\nThese old stopes are being cleaned out, new levels opened, and good\r\nresults are expected in the future. What applies to the Odessa in this\r\nrespect is true to a great extent of every other large mine in Calico.\r\nThey were all worked in a hand-to-mouth sort of fashion, and although\r\nmany of these mines paid handsome dividends, little of the money was\r\never put back in anything like permanent improvement. All seemed to\r\nshare a common opinion—that the deposits were superficial, and would not\r\ngo down, and as a result no one felt like laying out money in an\r\nextravagant and unwarranted manner. But the mines have gone down, and\r\nthe men in charge of the mines to-day can see the result of the mistaken\r\neconomy of the early operators, and see in Calico an era of recovery of\r\nlow-grade ore bodies and development work which is calculated to give\r\nthe mines greater apparent permanency than ever heretofore. December 1,\r\n1891, the King mill was enlarged by the addition of ten stamps, making\r\nthirty in all. The Boss process of continuous amalgamation was also\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHLORIDING THE MINES.\r\n\r\nA system of leasing portions of mining claims, called “chloriding” in\r\nCalico, was introduced in the early days, and is still in vogue. Many\r\npoor men have made moderate fortunes in the district, and in days gone\r\nby all did well. The mines are leased on a royalty of one fourth to one\r\nsixth of the ore to the claim owner, according to its value, the owner\r\nreceiving more as the grade is higher. Chloriders were at work on the\r\nLoo, Little Waterman, Humbug, Bismarck, Blackfoot, and other mines,\r\nduring the past year. The ore obtained in this manner is usually sacked\r\nand shipped to a custom mill, where it is crushed, the charges ranging\r\nfrom $9 to $12, according to the character of the ore, some (the more\r\nbrittle) milling much faster than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE WATERLOO MINE.\r\n\r\nThe Waterloo property consists of four claims. The principal workings\r\nare in the Waterloo Mine, where large stopes have been extracted, though\r\nconsiderable amounts of ore still remain in sight. An idea of the extent\r\nof some of these Calico mines may be gained from the fact that the great\r\nore body of the Waterloo is 1,100 feet in length, and is known to extend\r\nfrom the surface down to the 525-foot level. At the east end the\r\nore-bearing zone is from 4 to 7 feet in width, widening downward. Going\r\nwestward it increases in width until it is 60 to 70 feet wide. This\r\nmine, like those immediately about Calico, was worked for rich pockets,\r\nand, as a natural consequence, the mine was left in bad condition. Jos.\r\nD. Kerbaugh, the last Superintendent of the mine, had inaugurated a\r\nsystematic method of extracting ore and recovered much lost ground. The\r\nore is usually low grade, and this, in connection with the low price of\r\nsilver, has resulted in the closing up of the mines. A narrow gauge\r\nrailroad has been in use for several years to transport the ore from the\r\nWaterloo group and the King and Red Jacket Mines, owned by the same\r\ncompany, to their mills at Daggett, timber and supplies being brought to\r\nthe mines on the return trips. The transportation of ore, I was\r\ninformed, cost 12 cents per ton. The railroad is about 7 miles in\r\nlength, and runs on a pretty steep grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BORAX MINE.\r\n\r\nIn the upturned sedimentary beds which flank the Calico Hills, dipping\r\noutward toward the desert plain on all sides of the uplift, except where\r\npurely local disturbances have caused a reverse condition, are bedded\r\ndeposits of calcium borate and gypsum (calcium sulphate). Five miles\r\neast of the town of Calico is the largest known deposit of calcium\r\nborate in the district. The bed, or vein, as it is called, was\r\ndiscovered some years since, and finally passed into the hands of the\r\npresent owners, the Pacific Coast Borax Company, whose extensive works\r\nare located at Alameda, near San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     GEOLOGY OF THE BORAX DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe borax mine occurs as a bedded vein in the sedimentary strata, which\r\nin Tertiary times were uplifted in the Calico range. The sediments are\r\ncomposed of sandstones, sandy clays, and clayey sands, comprising a\r\nsuccession of heavy-bedded, deep-water deposits, and shallow-water,\r\nthin-bedded shales and sands. These variations in the character of the\r\nstrata are numerous, and mark the many oscillations of the region, whose\r\nrising or sinking either submerged the strata beneath the waters of a\r\ndeep lake, or lifted them until the water flowed over the mud flats only\r\nin thin sheets, which, exposed to the rays of the sun, sometimes\r\nevaporated entirely. Climatic conditions doubtless also were an\r\nimportant factor in the history of these strata, which are upwards of\r\n1,000 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the sediments are the tufas of the Calico region, and beneath\r\nthem is found the mass of liparite which underlies this entire region.\r\nThe sediments are not materially different from those in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Calico. The rocks have not suffered in the region about the\r\nborax deposit the slightest metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThe borax vein is traceable for several thousand feet, striking along\r\nthe western and northern side of the largest sedimentary hill in the\r\nrange, and finally passing down a cañon to the eastward, where it\r\nbecomes a well-defined vein. Toward the western end the borate of lime\r\nappears to be much mixed with the sandy sediments, gypsum, and clays,\r\ngiving the appearance of having been formed near the shore line of the\r\nbasin in which this great mass of material has been left as a residuary\r\ndeposit, due to the evaporation of the water containing the calcium\r\nborate.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that what is now one of the most valuable deposits of\r\nmineral in the State was at one time the site of a Tertiary lake of\r\nconsiderable but as yet undetermined size. That although subjected to\r\nthe same oscillations as the remainder of the region a basin formed, in\r\nwhich the waters collected, carrying with them the mineral salts derived\r\nfrom the rocks of the neighboring country. That finally the climatic\r\nconditions became such that the supply of water was less than the loss\r\nby absorption and evaporation, and the waters of the lake slowly\r\ndiminished, it finally disappearing entirely, leaving on the floor of\r\nthe lake a thick deposit of calcium borate of snowy whiteness.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the borax bed a general subsidence of the region\r\noccurred, the waters of the great Tertiary lake once more covering the\r\nwhole country. Again the sands and finer sedimentary material—the\r\nerosion of the mountains—were carried down and found a resting place on\r\nthe floor of the lake, the borax bed being finally covered with several\r\nhundred feet of this detritus. Now, as the same formation in which the\r\nborax mine is found, and even the lower members of the rocks of that\r\nage, are seen resting upon the high ridges and on some of the peaks of\r\nthe Calico hills, it would seem highly improbable, to say the least,\r\nthat these sediments were built up from the ruins of the Calico\r\nMountains themselves, but their source was in more distant ranges.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular vein-like deposit of calcium borate found at the\r\nborax mine, there are numerous small veinlets in other parts of the\r\ndistrict in which calcium borate and gypsum are found filling cracks and\r\ncavities, probably as the result of infiltration. So common are these\r\nsmall fissures and beds of borax and gypsum that that portion of the\r\nsedimentary strata lying east of the town of Calico is usually spoken of\r\nas the borax formation by the miners of the district. To thoroughly\r\ninvestigate all the phenomena connected with these wonderful deposits\r\nand their mode of formation would require more time than was at my\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nAs has been previously stated, remnants of the sediments are still found\r\nlying high up on the flanks of the mountains, and even far into the\r\ninterior of the hills, and there is every probability that the entire\r\nregion included in the Calico District, as well as the country for many\r\nmiles around, was at one time buried a thousand feet beneath these\r\nstratified rocks.\r\n\r\nWith the uplift, the strata inclosing the borax mine were tilted and\r\nfolded, and now the sheet of white calcium borate which once lay\r\nglistening in the sun on the bed of a desert dry lake stands like a\r\ngreat vein traversing the country. There are apparently two of these\r\nveins in close proximity to each other, but I believe them to be one and\r\nthe same, being repeated as the result of an anticlinal fold. An ideal\r\ncross-section of the borax mine is here given (p. 347), showing the\r\nnature of the folding at that point; it is not drawn to a scale, being a\r\nsketch only.\r\n\r\nTo the southward of the mine is seen a large mass of liparite, which has\r\nbeen pushed up from below. I had not the time necessary to trace out the\r\nline of fracture, but I am of the opinion that it occurs on the line of\r\nthe great fault shown on the map of the fault system of the region.\r\n\r\nThe borax vein is from 7 to 10 feet in thickness Where it has been\r\nexposed in the underground workings. The mineral is the variety of\r\ncalcium borate called colemanite, named in honor of Wm. T. Coleman. It\r\noccurs in glassy crystals, some of them having large faces. Many\r\nhandsome specimens of this mineral are on exhibition in the Mining\r\nBureau museum. The mineral is mined in the same manner as ores of gold\r\nor silver. Inclined shafts are sunk on the vein, drifts and levels run,\r\nand the stopes carried up as in any other mine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF BORAX MINE\r\n    CALICO DISTRICT SAN BERNARDINO CO._]\r\n\r\nThe material, when hoisted to the surface, is loaded in great wagons\r\nhauled by twenty animals and taken to Daggett, where it is shipped to\r\nthe works in Alameda. The process of extracting the boracic acid from\r\nthe rock as practiced in these works is not given to the public. It is\r\nknown that the mineral is crushed and bolted like flour, after grinding\r\nwith burrs, but the subsequent treatment is not known outside the works.\r\n\r\nTo the Superintendent, J. W. S. Perry, I am indebted for a sketch of the\r\nunderground working of this remarkable mine, which is reproduced above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AGE OF THE UPLIFT.\r\n\r\nThe geological age of the Calico uplift has not been accurately\r\ndetermined, though there is little doubt that it occurred during the\r\nTertiary age, probably the Oligocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE IRON MINES.\r\n\r\nIn this county, about 16 miles in a southeasterly direction from\r\nNewberry Station, on the A. & P. R. R., and 28 miles easterly from\r\nDaggett, are the greatest deposits of iron ore on this coast. They\r\nconsist of immense beds or masses of hematite and magnetite ore,\r\ncontaining a high percentage of iron, with traces only of sulphur and\r\nphosphorus. These mines have been known for many years, and they have\r\nhad numerous owners by relocation and purchase, but nothing has yet been\r\ndone with them. Iron men from Pittsburg and Cleveland and elsewhere have\r\nvisited these mines and secured samples, and all reported favorably on\r\nthe excellent quality of the ores, but there the matter was dropped.\r\n\r\nLocated 16 miles from the railroad, and probably 20 miles by any\r\npossible line of railway survey, as the grades are heavy, with neither\r\nfuel nor water, the problem of their reduction was so formidable that\r\nnone dared face it, and for years this magnificent property has been\r\nwaiting for some one with capital and a “process” to come and make the\r\nvast wealth available.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LAVA BEDS DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThis interesting region has come quite prominently into public notice\r\nwithin the past two years. The district is located in a small range of\r\nmountains about 35 miles east of the Calico range. The nearest station\r\nto the mines is Lavic, on the line of the A. & P. R. R., from which\r\npoint the mines are 9 miles distant by a good wagon road. Like most\r\nother desert mining regions it is destitute of timber, and water is not\r\nabundant, though obtainable in the dry lake basin 3½ miles from the\r\nmines. The district was discovered about nine years since, and numerous\r\nclaims have been located. The work of development has been confined to a\r\nfew of the most promising claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GENERAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe mountain range in which the mines of this district occur is isolated\r\nfrom all others, although evidently a part of a chain extending in a\r\nnorthwest and southeast direction for many miles. This particular group\r\nof hills is about 4 miles in length by 1½ in width, and consists of\r\nrocks, which are all of plutonic origin. They are mostly quartz porphyry\r\nof the normal type, consisting of a fine-grained felsitic ground mass,\r\nwith macroscopical crystals of quartz and feldspar.\r\n\r\nOf several thin sections made for the purpose of microscopic study of\r\nthese rocks, their behavior under the microscope is so similar that\r\ngeneral description will suffice for all. The section is characterized\r\nby a micro-crystalline to micro-granular ground mass, sometimes to\r\nglobulitic. The feldspars are so completely clouded as to leave little\r\nclue to their identity. Some still show faintly the parallel lines which\r\nare so characteristic of plagioclase, but some of these feldspars are\r\nprobably orthoclase. These feldspars are plainly distinguishable in the\r\nrock mass with the unaided eye. Quartz blebs as large as small peas,\r\nwith many smaller ones, occur plentifully in all of these rocks. In the\r\nsection they seem to have been corroded, the outlines being nearly\r\nalways rounded, though frequently showing hexagonal forms. Most of these\r\nquartz grains polarize in brilliant colors. All of the quartzes contain\r\na great abundance of fluid inclusions, some of which show included air\r\nbubbles. Numerous very small, colorless, needle-like crystals, which\r\noccur in all the quartz, are no doubt apatite prisms. Green, dust-like\r\nhornblende as inclusions are not at all uncommon, and in one section a\r\nmass of green, fibrous material, having all the optical properties of\r\nhornblende, is seen. This inclusion is large enough to be easily\r\ndistinguished with the unaided eye. There are numerous globulitic,\r\ngranular, and sac-like inclusions of the ground mass in many of the\r\nquartzes, which is characteristic of the quartz porphyries generally.\r\nBesides these macroscopic crystals of quartz and feldspar are many\r\nhornblendes, some of which are of good size, a few having the typical\r\ncrystal outlines. It is usually of a bright green color, strongly\r\ndichroic, and polarizes in the usual colors. Some of the hornblende is\r\naltered to chlorite. Borders of iron ore, probably magnetite, are\r\ncommon, frequently preserving the original outline where the hornblende\r\nhas suffered great decomposition.\r\n\r\nDark-green basic dikes, which seem to be greatly altered diabase, occur\r\nin the district, but have no connection with any of the ore deposits as\r\nfar as observed.\r\n\r\nNumerous dikes, large and small, of a red felsitic rock, occur\r\nthroughout the district, and seem to bear an important relation to some\r\nof the ore deposits. All of the rock is much decomposed, and its\r\nidentification is not an easy matter. It appears under the microscope to\r\nbe a finely porphyritic rock, having a somewhat fluidal structure, as\r\nshown in the arrangement of the numerous small, lath-like crystals of\r\nfeldspar. Small blebs of quartz occur quite abundantly. In a general way\r\nthe rock resembles some rhyolites.\r\n\r\nOn the northern flank of the range immense masses of red and brown tufa\r\noccur, besides great flows of black basaltic lava. These rocks form a\r\nterrace-like ridge that extends for several miles along the base of the\r\nmountains. Two large cinder cones, one on the northeast end of the\r\nrange, the other about 4 miles distant in the desert valley to the\r\nnorthward, form prominent landmarks.\r\n\r\nThe basalt is coarse to fine grained, usually black or dark gray, and is\r\noften scoriaceous. It contains plagioclase, augite, and olivine, and\r\nabundant magnetite in a micro-crystalline or granular base. Near the\r\nfoot of the range the basalt has overflowed the beds of tufa, which\r\nlatter, it is said, contains from a trace to as high as four ounces of\r\nsilver per ton. As far as I have any knowledge of it, no prospecting has\r\nbeen done in these tufa beds, but the fact that silver exists there at\r\nall would lead one to believe that under proper conditions ore bodies of\r\ngreat value may occur.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the mountains, at an altitude of 1,800 feet, is a dry\r\nlake, which drains a large area of country. In this basin water has been\r\nobtained by sinking a well 80 feet in depth. Though the well is located\r\nnear the edge of the basin, there is little doubt that sufficient water\r\ncan be obtained in this basin for milling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe principal vein in the district lies along the north side of the main\r\nrange, and is known as\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE IMPERIAL LODE.\r\n\r\nThis great vein, the outcrop of which may be seen for 20 miles, is a\r\n“fissure” in every sense of the word, though not a simple one, for it\r\nhas numerous divergent branches of considerable size. The main fissure,\r\nhowever, is strong and constant, and outcrops boldly for nearly 8,000\r\nfeet. It varies in width from 4 to 18 feet. It is everywhere well\r\ndefined and often shows a banded structure.\r\n\r\nThe great fissure strikes north 70° west, and dips 65° to 70° to the\r\nsouth. It occurs in the quartz porphyry, which at contact with the vein\r\nis usually much decomposed and often shattered and crushed, probably\r\nowing partly to the intrusion of a large dike of the red felsitic rock,\r\na tongue of which has cut across the vein about 3,500 feet from its west\r\nend. This dike follows the vein for some distance on the hanging wall\r\nside coming from the east, gradually nearing the vein until it finally\r\nreaches the fissure, cutting the vein in two. Farther westward it again\r\nappears on the hanging wall side, showing itself at intervals to the\r\nextreme western end of the vein, which comes to an abrupt termination.\r\nThis felsitic dike is but one of a number that occur in the immediate\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _THE IMPERIAL LODE LAVA BEDS DISTRICT\r\n    SAN BERNARDINO CO. CAL.\r\n    VEIN CUT BY INTRUSIVE DYKE OF FELSITE_]\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the Imperial lode there has been considerable\r\nmovement within the vein itself. Slips are numerous, the slickensides\r\nshowing plainly. The fault planes, as far as observed, are confined\r\nwithin the limits of the vein; however, at no place, excepting where the\r\ndike intersects it, did I notice any lateral displacement.\r\n\r\nUsually the vein is distinctly separated from the inclosing rock, a clay\r\nselvage marking the line of the fault plane on either side. In some\r\ninstances, however, where a brecciated condition of the quartz porphyry\r\nis found in contact with the vein, the ore has been deposited to some\r\nextent in this broken mass, and in such cases the line of demarkation is\r\nnot at all plain. These occurrences, together with the branching spurs,\r\nseem to indicate perfectly the character of the vein, which before the\r\nintrusion of the felsitic dike was more simple than we now find it. My\r\nconception of the Imperial vein is that a great fissure formed in this\r\nmountain range; that at the time this disruption occurred the hanging\r\nwall side of the fault slipped downward, causing a further fissuring and\r\ncrushing of the rocks on that side of the fault. It is a notable fact\r\nthat all the branches or spurs of this vein occur in the hanging wall\r\ncountry and are directly connected with the main fissure. This idea is\r\nstill further substantiated by the additional fact that all, or nearly\r\nall, the crushing and grinding adjacent to the fault plane has occurred\r\non the hanging wall side.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in the narrower portions of the vein, a banded structure\r\nindicates the probability that the ore now fills what was at one time an\r\nopen crevice, which slowly filled with ore by precipitation from the\r\nmineral waters passing along the fault plane.\r\n\r\nAt one point on the course of the vein, where it is joined by one of the\r\nbranching spurs, the felsitic dike has intersected the smaller vein. The\r\noccurrence is plainly seen in a cut made at this place, where rich ore\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _THE FELSITE DYKE\r\n    CUTTING A BRANCHING VEIN\r\n    IMPERIAL LODE_]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that both the main vein and the spur occur in the\r\nquartz porphyry, and that the red felsite cuts the smaller vein. The\r\ndisplacement on the surface along the strike of the vein is nearly 40\r\nfeet. This does not show in the cross-section.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the Imperial vein the mountains have suffered\r\ngreat erosion; the highest point along the croppings rises fully 800\r\nfeet above the neighboring cañons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE ORE.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Imperial vein is a fissure of great length and depth, all\r\nthe material that is included between the porphyritic walls is not pay\r\nore. The ore occurs in shoots of greater or less extent, the same as in\r\nany other vein. The gangue is chiefly quartz, having a pearly luster\r\nresembling in appearance some light grayish lead carbonate at a casual\r\nglance. Accompanying the quartz, though in minor quantities, are baryta,\r\ncalcite, and black manganese oxide. The value of the ore lies almost\r\nwholly in its silver contents, which occur as chloride and sulphide\r\n(argentite) accompanying pyrites, chalcopyrite, and iron oxides. The\r\nsilver sometimes occurs with copper glance in small bunches in solid\r\nmasses of lead carbonate. Such ores are very high grade. In one of the\r\nbranches gold is found with only a small percentage of silver, the\r\nreverse condition, however, usually obtains. The silver frequently is\r\nfound in the same shoots with the base ores and in quartz without any\r\nintimate association with either lead, copper, or iron. The galena is\r\nsometimes very low grade, carrying only 4 ounces per ton in silver. In\r\none shoot the lead carbonate contains over 200 ounces. It is a notable\r\nfact that no good ore is found in quantity without copper in some form,\r\neither as sulphide (glance) or carbonate. Chloride of silver is also\r\nfound associated with iron and manganese, without copper or lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CLAIMS ON THE VEIN.\r\n\r\nThere are six lode claims located on the Imperial vein, on all of which\r\nconsiderable work has been done. Beginning at the east end, the vein\r\nshows itself on the mountain side close down to the desert wash and not\r\nfar distant from the basalt flow on this side of the range.\r\n\r\nThe most easterly claim is called the Sampson, and from it has been\r\nshipped some rich ore, the claim producing the highest grade ore, I am\r\ntold, of any mine on the vein. This claim is joined on the westward by\r\nthe Morning Star, a deep cañon separating them. From the bottom of this\r\ncañon it is 800 feet to the summit of the mine, 1,500 feet farther west.\r\nThe Morning Star Mine has been quite extensively opened by tunnels and\r\nshafts, but for several years past assessment work only has been done,\r\nas the ore which was found was too low grade to make shipping\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe Meteor, Mammoth Chief, and Desert Queen succeed each other,\r\nrespectively, going west. On the Mammoth Chief and Meteor, a great deal\r\nof work has been done; and it is claimed ore was shipped approximating\r\n$40,000 gross value. At any rate the owners have developed their claims\r\nand made a good living at the expense of the ore thus shipped from the\r\nvein. On the Meteor a shaft has been sunk a depth of 100 feet, at the\r\nbottom of which a drift 40 feet in length has been cut along the vein on\r\nan ore shoot which was followed down from the surface. At another point\r\non this claim a shaft of 65 feet in depth has been sunk in ore. A drift\r\nat the bottom of this shaft is also in ore, 8 feet of which is exposed\r\nand the foot wall not yet reached.\r\n\r\nThe ore at this point is said to average 30 ounces. I was told that the\r\naverage of the ore throughout the mine was about 25 ounces, ranging from\r\n12 to 75 ounces, and occasionally much more. Numerous cuts, shafts, and\r\ndrifts, some of them of considerable size, have been made along the vein\r\non the Meteor and Mammoth Chief for a distance of 800 feet, and although\r\nthese workings are not connected they have the appearance of being on\r\none shoot of ore. One fact is very evident from an examination of the\r\nmine, and it is one of considerable importance. It is, that the ore is\r\nof better grade and occurs in greater quantity in the vicinity of the\r\nfelsitic dike, which, though undoubtedly later than the vein itself,\r\nseems to have enriched the ore very materially. The largest shoot of ore\r\nI saw has formed very close to the point of intersection of the felsitic\r\ndike with the main vein. On the Desert Queen a long tunnel and several\r\ncrosscuts have exposed ore bodies, some of which contained upwards of\r\n200 ounces silver per ton.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial lode is one of the most promising veins of which I have any\r\nknowledge, but it requires considerable capital to properly and\r\nsystematically open it. The rock is extremely hard, and the lack of wood\r\nand water are drawbacks which prevent the owners from working the mine\r\nas it should be worked. It would be difficult to find a vein offering\r\ngreater natural advantages than are found here, excepting as to wood and\r\nwater, both of which are obtainable under the usual conditions attending\r\nthat problem on the desert. Water can be found in the dry lake 3½ miles\r\ndistant by road, and 1,160 feet below the level of the cañons which cut\r\nthe vein.\r\n\r\nCoal may be delivered at Lavic Station, 5 miles from the lake, for about\r\n$9 or $10 a ton. The difficulties are no greater than at Calico, where\r\nthey seem to have been overcome quite easily. Tunnels may be run in on\r\nthe vein, getting average backs of about 350 feet above the bottom of\r\nthe cañons.\r\n\r\nShould ever this great vein be worked on a larger scale with abundant\r\ncapital, a tunnel started at the lake will cut the vein at an average\r\ndepth of 1,500 feet. Such a tunnel would probably be about 12,000 feet\r\nin length. The ore shoots seem to have an average width of about 5 feet\r\nas far as exposed, and none of the workings in ore have ever reached the\r\nbottom of a shoot. It is one of the most imposing looking veins I ever\r\nsaw. On the Desert Queen the soft hanging wall has been eroded, leaving\r\nthe vein standing exposed for fully 80 feet in height.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TIPTOP MINE.\r\n\r\nAbout 4,000 feet south from the Imperial lode there is a mine of unusual\r\ncharacter and interest, called the Tiptop. Originally a silver mine, it\r\nis now producing a high-grade copper ore, which is being shipped to\r\nSwansea, Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Tiptop was discovered in 1890, by the strong outcrop of an ore\r\nshoot. The country rock on both sides of the vein is quartz porphyry,\r\nsimilar to that inclosing the Imperial lode. The ore occurs along a\r\nfault plane, or rather a series of parallel faults, as the result of\r\nsubstitution of ore for the original rock. The faulting of the rocks has\r\nresulted in an extensive crushing and breaking up of the porphyry along\r\nthe line of fracture, exposing large surfaces of rock, thus facilitating\r\nthe deposition of mineral. As mentioned above, the faulting seems to\r\nhave consisted of several fractures, nearly or quite parallel, between\r\nwhich the rock was crushed or ground to powder. In places this ore body\r\nwould seem to possess well-defined walls, but moving in either direction\r\nalong the strike of this zone the “wall” proves to be simply a faulting\r\nplane, beyond which ore again occurs. The result of these parallel\r\nfractures is to give to the deposit an appearance of banded structure,\r\nlike that sometimes noticed in simple fissure veins. This apparently\r\nbanded structure is entirely due to the planes of displacement.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _CROSS SECTION\r\n    OF\r\n    TIPTOP MINE_]\r\n\r\nDoubtless this faulting extends to great depth, though the\r\nmineralization is not continuous along the surface for more than 150\r\nfeet. At some distance, however, and in line with the strike of the\r\ndisplacement, other ore bodies appear. The ore body where the discovery\r\nwas made is heavily mineralized with iron oxides, of red, yellow, and\r\nblack colors.\r\n\r\nMuch of the original rock has become silicified and bleached to snowy\r\nwhiteness in the lower part of the deposit, but such masses contain only\r\nfinely disseminated iron pyrites, low grade in silver. The once\r\nsulphuretted ores are so thoroughly oxidized in this surface deposit\r\nthat they are very porous.\r\n\r\nThe ores carry on an average about 30 ounces of silver, and for the most\r\npart are very free-milling. At the time of my visit an estimate of this\r\nsilver ore on the dump and in the mine placed its value at,\r\napproximately, $20,000. In one portion of this rather remarkable ore\r\ndeposit considerable quantities of native sulphur occur, associated with\r\na brownish iron oxide and silicious gangue material. As depth is\r\nattained the oxidation is less marked, and at 80 feet has apparently\r\ngiven place entirely to sulphuretted ores and silicious rock, low in\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe strike of this shoot of ore is north 50° west, dipping northeast at\r\nan angle of 70°. At the depth of 65 feet below the croppings, in sinking\r\na winze, which in its downward course follows a slip northward but is\r\nvertical as compared with the dip of the vein, a bunch of high-grade,\r\npartly oxidized copper ore was discovered. Further development\r\ndiscovered other pockets or bunches of copper ore carrying usually about\r\n15 ounces in silver per ton. When a depth of 120 feet had been reached a\r\ncrosscut tunnel was run in 235 feet. The course of this tunnel is north\r\n5° west. The face, however, had not reached a line representing the dip\r\nof the surface shoot. The tunnel has been connected by winze with the\r\nupper workings, and considerable other development accomplished.\r\n\r\nBy means of these workings the peculiarities of the mine have been\r\nexposed. The series of faults which have resulted in the deposit of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of silver ore have been accompanied by another\r\nseries of fractures which, while independent of the former, were,\r\nperhaps, contemporaneous. The second series exhibit no parallelism, but\r\nstrike in various directions. Along these fault planes occur bunches of\r\ncopper ore, principally variegated pyrites (bornite), chalcopyrite, and\r\na black “earthy” sulphide, having a shining streak, not sectile,\r\nprobably a variety of copper glance.\r\n\r\nThese ores are sometimes associated with iron sulphide, but most of this\r\nclass may be easily sorted. One class of ores occurs intermingled with\r\nthe gangue containing about 15 per cent copper. This ore can be\r\nseparated on any concentrating machine such as a jig, the resulting\r\nproduct being high grade. The ore shipped to Swansea has averaged over\r\n33 per cent copper and 15 ounces silver per ton.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF TIPTOP MINE\r\n    LAVA BEDS DISTRICT SAN BERNARDINO CO._]\r\n\r\nThe Tiptop consists of two claims. The easterly one, the Kenton, has\r\nlittle or no development, though copper carbonates have been discovered\r\non the ground. All of the workings of the Tiptop that are in copper ore,\r\nit should be remembered, are in the country rock on the foot wall side\r\nof the series of faults in which the silver ore occurs, and no drift or\r\ncrosscut had been run into that zone below 80 feet from the surface. The\r\nface of the drift on the third level had exposed about 6 feet of good\r\nore at the time of my examination. The drift at that point was 160 feet\r\nfrom the surface. It is not likely, should a crosscut be run under the\r\nsilver ore shoot from the lower levels of the mine, that oxidized ore\r\nwill be found at that level, but it will be interesting to know what\r\nsort of ore may be found there. Indications of copper on the surface are\r\nvery slight. In a few places stains and thin seams of copper carbonates\r\noccur in the fracture joints of the country rock, but there is nothing\r\nto lead one to believe that ore lies beneath that will bear shipment to\r\nEurope and return a handsome profit to the owners of the mine, yet such\r\nis the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GLADSTONE GOLD MINE.\r\n\r\nLess than a mile from the Tiptop, in a northwestern direction, is\r\nanother property, the Gladstone, locally known as Halberg’s Gold Mine.\r\nIt was located several years ago, and after some development was\r\npractically abandoned, but afterwards came into the hands of the present\r\nowners, who have developed the ground quite extensively, built a long\r\ntramway and ore bins, and established a camp.\r\n\r\nNothing was being done at the time of my visit. The mine is something of\r\na curiosity geologically and mineralogically. The ore body, for there is\r\nonly one of any consequence developed, occurs in the gray quartz\r\nporphyry common to the region. A fault has also occurred here,\r\nfracturing the country rock in a manner similar to that in the Tiptop,\r\nexcepting that here there is but a single, simple fault. The ore body\r\nconsists of a mass of crushed and broken country rock, portions of which\r\nstill show distinctly the original porphyritic structure. Generally\r\nspeaking, however, the original rock has undergone an extreme\r\nmetamorphosis, resulting, in most cases, in more or less complete\r\nmineralogical and physical changes. The porphyry has, by gradual\r\nreplacement, been changed to solid ore, or been silicified to a dense\r\nquartzose, sometimes jaspery, rock. Kaolinization of the feldspars has\r\nalso taken place. As to the origin of these deposits there seems to be\r\nlittle reason to doubt that the ore was deposited by percolating waters,\r\nwhich derived their contents from the neighboring eruptive rocks. These\r\nsolutions were carried into the fault plane, and reaching the great\r\nchamber or crushed mass, found conditions of a superior nature for the\r\nprecipitation of the minerals they contained. In the pulverized or\r\nfinely crushed portions the ore deposition has been most complete,\r\nentirely replacing the original rock, while in the brecciated portions\r\nthe ore occurs as incrustations, filling the smaller interstices, but\r\nsometimes penetrating the rock fragments themselves.\r\n\r\nThe ore body is something over 200 feet in length and 30 feet or more in\r\nwidth at the Widest part, but thinning out rather irregularly toward the\r\nends and also downward.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it at one time extended some distance upward, but that portion\r\nhas been eroded. Along the plane of the fault the line of demarkation\r\nbetween ore and porphyry is very distinct, as the two bear not the\r\nslightest resemblance, but at the outer edges of the deposit no such\r\nline can be discovered. The mineral gradually disappears, leaving only a\r\nbrecciated mass of whitish rock, which graduates into the normal\r\nporphyry. The brecciated condition of the mass is made more plain by the\r\nvariety of color assumed by the angular fragments. They are various\r\nshades of green, red, white, and brown, or yellow, caused by copper\r\ncarbonates and iron oxides.\r\n\r\nThough the original condition of the ore was doubtless sulphide, it now\r\ncontains, as the result of oxidation, hematite, limonite, magnetite,\r\nmalachite, azurite, chrysocolla, cerussite, wulfenite, chloride of\r\nsilver, manganese oxide, and metallic gold. The value of the ore lies\r\nprincipally in the gold contained, though in one portion of the ore\r\nbody, near its eastern end, rich chloride of silver ore is found, with\r\nbut little gold. The physical appearance of the ore is no criterion of\r\nits gold contents, as two pieces, with identically the same\r\ncharacteristics, will differ widely in value. One may contain $2 or $3\r\nin gold, the other several hundred. Should ever a mill be erected in the\r\ndistrict, this ore can be worked to a profit, though this single ore\r\nbody will alone scarcely justify the construction of a mill.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this fissure or slip is a vein which runs nearly\r\nparallel with the chambered vein above described. This vein can be\r\ntraced for several thousand feet. In character the ore is similar to\r\nthat found in the Imperial lode. Assays running over $200 in gold have\r\nbeen obtained from this ore, and $50 assays are not uncommon. The vein\r\nis quite small, ranging from a mere seam to 2 feet. Scarcely any\r\ndevelopment has been done on this vein, though it promises better\r\nresults than the large “vein chamber.”\r\n\r\nThe developments on the Gladstone consist of a shaft 60 feet deep. The\r\nfirst level is cut at a depth of 30 feet from the surface, where drifts\r\nhave been run for a distance of 30 feet each way from the shaft, on the\r\ncourse of the vein, and a crosscut, 28 feet north. East of this, a\r\n15-foot shaft has been sunk in a good sized cut. A large open cut, 100\r\nfeet long, has exposed the upper portion of the ore deposit perfectly.\r\nOther superficial work has been done at various points along the vein. A\r\ntramway of 1,700 feet has been constructed from the mine to the bottom\r\nof an adjacent cañon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the mines described in this district are numerous\r\nother claims, some of them having considerable development, but all\r\nlying idle at the time of my visit. One claim has an 80-foot tunnel, and\r\nshows some lead and silver ore of good grade. This claim is patented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ALVORD MINES.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three miles northeast from Daggett are the Alvord Mines. The\r\nproperty has changed hands several times, but is now owned by a party of\r\nPasadena capitalists, who have under consideration the reconstruction of\r\ntheir mill, which was burned in September, 1891.\r\n\r\nThe property consists of six full claims located on one mineral-bearing\r\nzone. The strike of the belt is a few degrees south of west. The mine is\r\nwell equipped. The company also owns a millsite at Camp Cady, on the\r\nMojave River, 9 miles distant from the mines, and valuable water rights\r\nat Paradise Springs, 11 miles northwest from the mines, and a spring\r\nabout 1½ miles east of the camp, which is used for camp purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe mines lie along a broad zone or belt of crystallized carbonate of\r\nlime (calcite), which may be seen for many miles traversing the\r\ndark-colored inclosing rocks. A huge dike of porphyritic rock cuts\r\nacross this belt at an angle approaching 90°. The principal\r\nmineralization of the lode occurs east of this dike.\r\n\r\nThe country rock is described by F. R. Burnham, E.M., formerly the\r\nSuperintendent, in his report on the property to the company, as rock\r\nmore or less schistose in character, through which, at frequent\r\nintervals, are intruded eruptive dikes. At the east end of the belt is\r\nan accumulation of tufa and basalt. The belt dips south at an angle of\r\n75°. The mineralized portion of this lode extends from the porphyry dike\r\neast through three full claims, disappearing finally beneath the\r\neruptive rock and desert wash. The dominant point on the lode is 550\r\nfeet above the base of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe entire lode is gold-bearing, some of the iron rock being extremely\r\nrich; gold also occurs in the calcite, though it is usually of a lower\r\ngrade than where accompanied by the iron. Iron sulphide containing gold\r\nhas been discovered, indicating plainly the origin of the slag-like iron\r\nores and limonite found on the surface.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Burnham’s report I am also indebted for information concerning\r\nthe value of the rock, tonnage, and bullion output to date. He has given\r\narbitrary figures for shipments aggregating $37,000, and an estimate on\r\n$13,000 more, making a total of $50,000. This ore was milled mostly at\r\nthe Camp Cady mill and at Hawley’s mill.\r\n\r\nAn arrastra was used in the early history of the mine. The average\r\nassays made on a ten days’ mill run just prior to the burning of the\r\nmill returned $12 75 per ton. Tailings, during the same period, averaged\r\n$1 25. Bullion produced, $1,430. It was found very difficult to sort the\r\nore, though it varied constantly in value from $2 to $20 per ton. About\r\n90 per cent of the assay value, it is claimed, was saved in the mill. In\r\nlooking through a daily record of assays made in July and August, 1891,\r\nI find them to range from a trace to as high as $1,750, most of them\r\nrunning from $6 to $18. Mr. Burnham figures 184,000 tons of mill rock in\r\nsight, including all grades, besides large amounts presumed to be\r\navailable, but not blocked out for stoping. The value of the ore is\r\nplaced at $5 to $6 throughout.\r\n\r\nThe cost of milling this ore is placed at $2 50, and mining at 50 cents\r\nin large stopes. Should the company now controlling the Alvord Mines\r\ndetermine to rebuild their mill it will doubtless again become a bullion\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORO GRANDE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe Oro Grande Mining District is located immediately east of the\r\nSouthern California Railroad, at the town of Oro Grande. It is commonly\r\nsupposed to embrace all the mines for some miles around, though, in fact\r\neach group of mines or hills has been given a separate name, but as\r\nthese so-called districts are mostly without organization, all the\r\nclaims and mines will be considered under one head.\r\n\r\nThe geology of the district about Oro Grande is complex, the formations\r\nbeing uplifted, greatly faulted, and broken, besides the intrusion of\r\ndikes of felsitic rock, diorite, and quartz porphyry. I had not\r\nsufficient time at my disposal when at Oro Grande to study out the\r\nsomewhat intricate geological problem, and will describe the region in\r\ngeneral terms.\r\n\r\nCommencing at the town of Oro Grande, which stands on the bank of the\r\nMojave River, the country rises in a gentle slope toward the hill half a\r\nmile distant; gently rolling hills are reached, which in turn give place\r\nto more rugged masses, and finally to a rough mountainous area, the\r\nhillsides being almost precipitous. The lowlying country about the base\r\nof the hills is mostly made up of schistose micaceous rocks, a quartzose\r\nmica schist predominating. The first hills of any consequence are\r\neruptive, mostly a light-greenish felsite and a coarse-grained\r\nporphyritic rock. Beyond are prominent hills of a dense, hard quartzite\r\nresting upon a crystalline limestone, the highest hills being made up of\r\npractically the same materials (quartzite and limestone), in part\r\nschistose with some mica schist, jasper, and many intrusive dikes of all\r\nthe previously mentioned eruptives, prominent among them being diorite\r\nof dark-green color.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE EMBODY MINE.\r\n\r\nWithin half a mile of the town, and on a lower spur or ridge that makes\r\ndown from the hills, is located the Embody Mine, which, during the\r\nexcitement at this locality in 1890, attracted considerable attention.\r\nThe gold-bearing material is quartzose, micaceous rock of somewhat\r\nfriable character. The deposit, as I may term it, has the appearance of\r\nbeing an impregnation without definite form.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the fact that the shoot of gold rock makes across the\r\nstrike of the schists, it would resemble some bedded deposits found at\r\nthe Homestake, Black Hills, South Dakota, where micaceous schists have\r\nbeen silicified and hornblende schists metamorphosed to chloritic\r\nschists, the whole carrying gold across a broad zone 1,600 feet in width\r\nand 6,000 feet in length. The gold occurs in shoots or vein-like zones,\r\nwithout defining lines of any character. At the Embody Mine, too, little\r\ndevelopment has been done to make any positive prediction as to the\r\nfuture of the mine. The formation strikes northeast and southwest, and\r\ndips 70° southeast.\r\n\r\nThe country is somewhat broken up, but no considerable masses of\r\nshattered rock were observed. The croppings are quite heavily stained\r\nwith iron oxides of brown and red shades, and this mineralization can be\r\ntraced some distance. Two shafts, one nearly 100 feet deep, the other\r\nabout 30 feet, have been sunk on the deposit, exposing rocks of uniform\r\ncharacter, all carrying some gold. The width of the gold-bearing zone is\r\nundetermined, but it is thought to be from 6 to 20 feet.\r\n\r\nAs far as I learned, a “mill-run” had never been made on the rock from\r\nthis mine. Mining operations had been stopped and the property involved\r\nin some sort of dispute. The value of the rock was given to me as $8 or\r\n$10 per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CARBONATE MINE.\r\n\r\nThe principal mine of this district, and the one which gave the camp its\r\nfame, is the Carbonate Mine. It was discovered by a man named Collins,\r\nwho was working in a lime quarry near by. Collins found croppings of\r\nore—limonite and manganese—containing silver. He developed the property\r\nsomewhat, but it finally passed into other hands, and is now owned by a\r\nLos Angeles company, which has opened the mine quite extensively.\r\n\r\nThe formation which incloses the vein has a general trend northeast and\r\nsouthwest, the dip at the main workings being not over 20°. Here an\r\ninclined shaft has been sunk to a depth of 225 feet on the vein. At the\r\nbottom the shaft has attained a vertical depth of about 100 feet. Two\r\nveins of ore, consisting principally of silicious and earthy iron oxide\r\nand black oxide of manganese with carbonate of lime, sometimes\r\ncrystallized, extend from the surface to the bottom of the incline.\r\nThese veins are very irregular in size, varying from a mere seam to\r\nupwards of 2 feet in places.\r\n\r\nThe value lies in the lead carbonate and silver which accompany the\r\ngangue minerals. The two veins are curiously formed at contact with\r\nmassive blue limestone and mica schist. The schist is from 1 to 4 feet\r\nin width, the ore lying both above and below it, the whole being\r\ninclosed between hanging and foot walls of crystalline limestone. At\r\nvarious points in the workings is a light-colored, much decomposed rock,\r\nresembling felsite, which has the appearance of having been injected\r\nbetween the strata in a thin sheet. It is a notable fact that where this\r\nbuff-colored, granular appearing rock occurs in contact with the vein an\r\nenrichment of the ore is noticeable, and its absence is marked by the\r\nlow value of the ore or no ore at all. In this incline, at a depth of 40\r\nfeet, a short drift has been run in on ore of good grade. At 180 feet\r\nfrom the collar of the shaft the discovery was made that caused this\r\nmine, and, in fact, the entire camp, to become at once the scene of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nAt this place a small wedge of crystalline, granular quartz and calcite\r\nappeared, and with it flakes of free gold. Just below the point of this\r\ndiscovery the wedge widened to several inches, and the rock was a mass\r\nof glittering sheets and shot-like pieces of gold. Assays of the\r\nmaterial gave fabulous returns. The ore was broken down on canvas, and\r\nevery ounce of it sacked on the spot. This was followed down some\r\ndistance, but gradually thinned out below the 200-foot level, where\r\ndrifts were run, one 50 feet northeast, the other 40 feet southwest.\r\nFrom these drifts considerable rich quartz was obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the southwest drift the formation is badly displaced and broken and\r\nthe vein is lost, a fault having thrown it, but whether up or down could\r\nnot be determined, as the adjacent rock was so badly fractured. Ore was\r\nfound at the face and along the sides of some of the cuttings, and some\r\nfree gold was found on the 200-foot level in the southwest drift. All\r\nwork on this part of the mine had been suspended some time prior to my\r\nvisit, the mine having been enjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORIGIN OF THE VEINS.\r\n\r\nThis question is one which finds its answer, it would seem, in the fact\r\nthat the sheet of mica schist included between the heavy masses of\r\nlimestone represents what at one time was possibly a bed of sandy clay\r\nor mud, which with the metamorphosis of the region has become a\r\ncrystalline schist. The planes separating this schist and the limestone\r\nabove and that below it were evidently planes of weakness, and when the\r\nforces which uplifted and fractured the strata exerted themselves these\r\nrocks slipped and ground upon each other, causing considerable crushing\r\nalong these planes; possibly open crevices resulted in some portions.\r\nOre was subsequently deposited in these interstitial spaces, partly by\r\nsubstitution of ore for limestone, no doubt, and partly by precipitation\r\nin the crushed mass of lime and schist. The injection of a sheet of\r\nfelsite into the same plane of weakness can easily be conceived, as such\r\nintrusive bodies always follow the lines of least resistance. The\r\nextreme richness of the rock, together with its somewhat unusual\r\nassociation of quartz and calcite, attracted no little attention to the\r\nproperty at the time of its discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A FISSURE VEIN.\r\n\r\nSouthwestward from the deposit just described is a vertical shaft 125\r\nfeet deep. This shaft has followed down what seems to be a fissure in\r\nthe limestone, in which lead carbonate, some galena, limonite quartz,\r\ncalcite, and manganese oxide occur. This ore was worth at Socorro, New\r\nMexico, $50 per ton for the gold, silver, and lead it contained, and it\r\nwas shipped there in quite large quantities.\r\n\r\nA large stope commences on the northeast side of the shaft at a depth of\r\n30 feet from the top and extends down to the 114-foot level.\r\nConsiderable ore was standing in sight in the mine at the time of my\r\nvisit, but nothing was being done. The company have had to stop work, as\r\nthe owners of the lime quarry claim to have this property included in\r\ntheir patent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nThere are scores of other claims in this interesting district, but\r\nlittle development has been done on them. Here and there are encouraging\r\nprospects, where carbonate of lead and oxide of iron have been found;\r\nbut on the most promising of these only 10-foot holes have been sunk.\r\nThe mineral zones are not well defined, and the prospectors have not the\r\ncapital necessary to systematically prospect the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SILVER MOUNTAIN DISTRICT\r\n\r\nIs 5 miles south of Oro Grande. There are a number of claims, the\r\nprincipal one being the Amazon. The formation is similar to that about\r\nOro Grande. In a large dike of diorite occur the ore bodies of the\r\nAmazon Mine, which produces copper ores of a fair grade. Several holes\r\nwere sunk to various depths, ranging from 15 to 30 feet, by the Mormons\r\nwho settled on the Mojave River years ago. Recently a shaft has been\r\nsunk to the depth of 61 feet, and a drift run north 40 feet. The ore is\r\nprincipally copper-iron sulphide (chalcopyrite).\r\n\r\nThe ore in this mine occurs along slips or fault planes. This peculiar\r\nclass of deposits has been described under the head of the Tiptop Mine,\r\nLava Beds District, in this county, and as the essential features of\r\nthis mine are similar to those of the Tiptop, repetition here will be\r\nunnecessary. I found a greater mineralization of the limestone in this\r\ndistrict than about the Oro Grande, though no prospecting has been done\r\nhere for lead ores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEM MARBLE QUARRIES.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles northeast from Victor are the Gem quarries, that produce\r\nvariegated marbles of great beauty. Shades of yellow, chocolate, black,\r\npale blue, crimson and gray, cream-colored, rose, and white. The\r\nmarkings are such as to produce beautiful effects. The croppings are\r\nstrong, and the surface material is apparently not at all injured by the\r\nexposure of centuries to the elements in a region where nearly all rocks\r\ndecay and disintegrate rapidly. The outcrop stands boldly above the\r\nadjacent country rock from 10 to 20 feet. The entire ledge or belt is\r\nmade up of bands or beds ranging from 3 to 6 feet in thickness. These\r\nstrata are separated by thin seams or fractures, but it is reasonable to\r\npresume that this separating line or joint will disappear as depth is\r\nattained. The rock is all susceptible of a high polish, and it\r\nwithstands a tremendous crushing force. It was said by the owners that\r\nthis had been determined at 28,000 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe quantity is large, the variety abundant, and the beauty approaches\r\nthat of rare onyx. With these unusual conditions surrounding the\r\ndeposit, its marketing should become an industry of no small importance.\r\nThe difficulties of transportation are not insurmountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LIME AND GRANITE QUARRIES.\r\n\r\nNear Oro Grande and Victor several lime quarries are in operation,\r\nconstantly giving employment to quite a large number of men. Lime is\r\nburned in large kilns, which finds a ready market in Southern\r\nCalifornia. Granite is also extensively quarried near each of these\r\nplaces, and used for building material, curbing, and paving blocks in\r\nSouthern California cities. This industry employs, all told, about one\r\nhundred men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE KENT MINE.\r\n\r\nThree miles from Hinkley Station, on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad,\r\nbetween Barstow and Mojave, is located the Kent Mine, a vein covered by\r\ntwo claims. A shaft 80 feet deep and some superficial development have\r\nexposed the ore, which varies from 3 to 10 feet in width. The gangue is\r\na rather fine-grained, granular quartz, containing galena and lead\r\ncarbonate. Assays in gold and silver are obtainable anywhere in the\r\nvein. The highest grade carries lead 70 per cent, gold $25, silver 24\r\nounces. Some of the ore assaying low in lead contains gold and silver in\r\npaying quantities.\r\n\r\nThe property is in a prospective stage only, but is promising. Water can\r\nbe obtained near the mine, and fuel is but 8 miles distant. The owner\r\nbonded the property in May, 1892, and it is at this writing being\r\ndeveloped by the prospective purchasers. The ore is of such character\r\nthat by sorting a milling ore may be obtained, the high-grade lead ore\r\nmaking a very good smelting material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE BLACK HAWK DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThree years ago the Black Hawk District, 40 miles east of Victor, on the\r\nnorth side of the San Bernardino range, attracted considerable attention\r\nthrough the extensive operations of an English syndicate at those mines.\r\nDevelopment was in progress at that time, and it was planned to build a\r\nsixty-stamp mill. The quantity of gold rock, however, proved to be\r\nsmaller than had been anticipated, and a small experimental mill was\r\nbuilt; but from a short time after the completion of this mill to date\r\nall operations have been suspended, and the probability of the\r\nresumption of work is not bright.\r\n\r\nThe gold occurred in a reddish oxide of iron in bunches and stringers\r\nscattered through a crushed zone of limestone, lying along the flank of\r\nthe mountains. A party, who for a time was in charge of the property,\r\ninformed the writer that he had worked the rock without sorting, had\r\nendeavored to sort it, and had tried screening it, but that\r\nnotwithstanding every precaution was taken, he had concluded that it\r\ncould not be made to pay. The gold-bearing rock was quite rich, but it\r\noccurred in too small quantity to make it profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SILVER REEF DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nFour miles northeast of the Black Hawk Mines, lying down on the desert,\r\nis a formation of limestone and quartzite, resting on a massive\r\ncrystalline rock, containing quartz, feldspar, biotite-mica, and\r\nhornblende. This reef extends from the mouth of Texas Cañon out upon the\r\nplain, sloping downward at an angle of approximately 5° for a distance\r\nof 4 miles, where it terminates in a bluff 40 to 100 feet in height.\r\nAlong the entire eastern edge of this deposit it drops off abruptly as\r\nthough sharply eroded. At the northern end the reef is faced by a low\r\nrange of hills composed of the above-mentioned hornblende rock. From\r\nthis point it swings west and with irregular outline extends for 5 or 6\r\nmiles toward Rabbit Springs. The entire area, fully 25 square miles, is\r\ncut by gulches varying from 20 to 150 feet or more in depth, that have\r\nbeen eroded through the strata and down into the underlying crystalline\r\nrocks. These cañons seem to have resulted from natural drainage, being\r\nstarted by slight depressions in the rolling plateau of limestone. On\r\nthe extreme northern edge at one point, hills of considerable size have\r\nbeen formed by the folding and tilting of the strata. The limestone has\r\nbeen subjected to violent compression, as the whole area is faulted and\r\nbroken into millions of fragments.\r\n\r\nI have examined not less than twenty mining claims on the reef and\r\ntraveled over the greater part of its area, and am sure I never saw a\r\nsingle piece of limestone that would weigh 300 pounds, most of the\r\npieces measuring under 6 or 8 inches. Considerable masses along certain\r\nzones have been granulated, and even pulverized. This fractured rock has\r\nall since been loosely cemented by the infiltration of carbonate of lime\r\ninto the seams. Geologists who have examined this peculiar deposit do\r\nnot agree entirely upon its mode of formation. Some believe it to be the\r\nresult of chemical precipitation of carbonate of lime from calcareous\r\nsprings, similar to the Formation Springs in the Yellowstone Park. There\r\nare many things about Silver Reef which would at once suggest the\r\nprobability of this mode of deposit, but I am very doubtful that such a\r\ntheory will stand a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted that at one time a shaft sunk in the reef passed through\r\nthe lime deposit and into the “wash” of the desert beneath. On\r\ninvestigation I found that the lime had indeed been cut through, but the\r\nunderlying rock proved to be crystalline hornblende rock in place,\r\nthough somewhat decomposed. At any rate it was not desert “wash.” Over\r\nconsiderable areas the lime is underlaid by a stratum of quartzite of\r\nvariable thickness, less than a foot in some places, and again in others\r\n10 or 12 feet. Over certain limited areas quartzite is wanting\r\naltogether. The lime is mostly crystalline, varying in color. A small\r\nportion is as white as snow, the greater part is gray or bluish, and\r\nsome of it black.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ORE DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nFor fully 8 miles along the irregular front of the reef silver ores are\r\nfound. The ore deposits are usually discovered by the cherty masses of\r\nsilicious rock, which, being harder than the limestone, stand out from\r\nits weathered surface in bunches and small, vein-like masses. Often in\r\nbreaking the cherty rocks, stains of copper carbonate are found, and\r\nfrom such rock silver, and sometimes gold, is obtained. Numerous shafts,\r\ncuts, and tunnels have been made on these claims, twenty or more in\r\nnumber, and in every one ore of good grade has been found, although the\r\nquantity is usually small. A shipment from a claim called No. 1 returned\r\n129 ounces per ton in the Oro Grande mill. On assaying, 20 ounces can be\r\nfound on any of the claims, and rock of a higher grade running into the\r\nthousands of dollars is not unknown on the reef.\r\n\r\nThe ore occurs usually as bunches, sheets, or stringers, which “roll”\r\nmore or less, but in a general way follow the stratification of the\r\nlimestone downward. These stringers are from 4 inches to 2 feet in\r\nthickness, pinching and swelling both longitudinally and on their\r\nextension downward. The average of the ores thus far found is probably\r\nabout $50 per ton. The mines have all been opened by the discoverers,\r\nwho are men of limited means, and no systematic exploration for larger\r\nore bodies has ever been made. They may exist, though there is no\r\nsurface indication that such is the case. At one claim, No. 9, I took a\r\nlarge sample for 20 feet across the mineralized zone and found it to\r\nassay 11 ounces silver with $2 in gold. This rock was taken from a\r\nshallow cut 4 feet in width and 5 feet deep, 20 feet long.\r\n\r\nThe ore deposits occur without exception in zones of limestone that have\r\nbeen crushed into small fragments, together with much very fine\r\nmaterial. In a few places I found in contact or close to the ores what\r\nappeared to be a thin intrusive sheet of rock of undoubted igneous\r\norigin. The original nature of this rock could not be determined, as it\r\nwas very much decomposed and bleached. It looked like the white porphyry\r\nof Leadville more than anything else I could liken it to, and to a great\r\nextent has, doubtless, been the source from which the minerals of the\r\nore deposits were derived. In many places the quartzite which underlies\r\nthe lime rock contains galena, lead carbonate, wulfenite, zinc-blende,\r\niron sulphide, copper, gold, and silver. Some of this rock contains\r\nsufficient lead to be classed as a smelting ore.\r\n\r\nThe ores of the limestone deposits are chiefly chloride of silver and\r\nembolite (chloro-bromide of silver), which is usually accompanied by\r\ncopper carbonate, sometimes a copper-silver sulphide, wulfenite, lead,\r\nand iron in various forms, in a gangue of calcite and quartz, with\r\noccasionally manganese oxide. Hornsilver in crystals has been found in\r\nthe fracture joints and in small cavities of a pure blue limestone,\r\ntaken from a shaft on one of the claims at the east edge of the\r\ndistrict. Pasadena, Riverside, Daggett, and Victor people are the\r\nprincipal owners of claims. Timber can be obtained in the main range 5\r\nor 6 miles back of the mines, and abundance of water can be had from the\r\ncañons in the neighboring mountains or from Old Woman’s Springs, 2½\r\nmiles east of the principal claims on the reef.\r\n\r\nAltogether the district is a most interesting one geologically and also\r\nfinancially, as the high grade of some of the ore had induced the claim\r\nowners to sink considerable money in the development of their mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE GAVILAN MINES.\r\n\r\nOn the San Jacinto estate, which is owned by an English syndicate, are\r\nlocated the old Gavilan Mines, which years ago produced from quartz\r\nveins considerable gold, the rock being first crushed in numerous\r\narrastras, the beds of which, to the number of fifty or more, are still\r\nscattered all about the neighborhood of the mines. In later years, under\r\nAmerican management, the quartz was hauled to a stamp mill in the\r\nPinacate District. At the time the rancho became the property of the\r\nEnglish people nothing had been done in these mines for many years.\r\nDuring the past two years the old workings have been investigated and a\r\nlocal company organized at Riverside to operate them under lease. At the\r\ntime of my visit some workmen were industriously engaged in taking down\r\nthe gallows frame of the hoist and making preparations to vacate the\r\npremises, and this in the face of the report that had gone abroad that a\r\ngood-sized vein of pay rock had been uncovered at the bottom of the mine\r\nat the depth of 180 feet. I did not see the alleged ore shoot and could\r\nget no satisfaction from the men at work other than vague hints that\r\nthere was dissension among the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nThe veins of the Gavilan Mines are not large, but of good grade,\r\noccurring in a granitoid rock. Black tourmaline in a feldspathic and\r\nquartz gangue frequently accompanies the gold-bearing rock. The Mexicans\r\nworked a large shoot down to the water-line, and judging from the size\r\nand number of the dumps these old workings must have been of great\r\nextent. The Riverside people had sunk a new shaft at the extreme south\r\nend of the mine 180 feet in depth. The entire region is cut by large\r\nfeldspathic and granitic veins, which course in every direction. These\r\nveins are doubtless intrusive dikes of the variety of granite called\r\npegmatite. White scales of muscovite occur sparingly, but tourmaline is\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE VANDERBILT DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nForty-five miles from Fenner, on the line of the A. & P. R. R., in the\r\neastern part of the county, near the Nevada State line, is the\r\nVanderbilt District. It lies between Palm District and Ivanpah, at an\r\nelevation of 6,000 feet above the sea. Numerous claims have been located\r\non the veins of the district and considerable development done. Messrs.\r\nPatton, Taggert & Hall own eight promising claims, which it is their\r\npurpose to develop extensively. A shaft 4½ by 6½ feet has been sunk on\r\nthe vein to a depth of 60 feet, besides which a number of shafts of\r\nlesser depth and numerous open cuts have been made, all exposing ore of\r\ngood grade. The vein is of the branching kind. The veins vary from 5 to\r\n30 feet in width, striking east and west, with a dip to the north of\r\n60°. The gangue is quartz, honey-combed at the surface from the\r\noxidation of the sulphurets it originally contained, small disseminated\r\ncrystals of which (iron, lead, and copper) begin to show in the rock\r\nfrom the deepest parts of the workings. Some of the rock contains a high\r\npercentage of lead in the form of galena and carbonate, but it occurs\r\nmostly in bunches and is not evenly distributed through the rock. A\r\nshipment of 6,963 pounds to the sampling works at Kingman, Arizona,\r\nreturned an average assay value of $173 50 per ton, most of which was\r\ngold. Another lot averaged $44.\r\n\r\nNear the above described property Messrs. Simmons & Roberts have sunk\r\nthree shafts to a depth of 40 feet each, and Campbell & Beatty put down\r\na shaft 100 feet, all in ore of a character and value similar to that\r\nfound in the other mines. Both wood and water are obtainable in the\r\ndistrict, pine timber growing on the hills, and a good stream of water\r\nis flowing down into the desert only 1¼ miles distant from these mines.\r\nWith the character and grade of the ores found in these veins, and the\r\nadvantages of wood and water, it would seem that these mines might be\r\nsuccessfully operated, particularly as some of the owners are possessed\r\nof sufficient means. It is the expressed intention, however, to sink\r\ndeeper and determine more fully the extent and character of the ore in\r\ndepth before placing expensive machinery on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE IBEX MINE.\r\n\r\nAmong the mines that have attracted unusual attention in this county\r\nduring the past year, the Ibex Mine stands prominently in the front\r\nrank. It is located 3½ miles from Ibex Station, on the line of the A. &\r\nP. R. R., and not over 11 miles north from The Needles. The Ibex\r\nproperty is in the Ibex Mining District, and consists of seven claims,\r\nwhich were located in 1888, now owned by residents of Riverside and San\r\nBernardino. The principal claim is called the Ibex. The vein strikes\r\neast and west, dipping at an angle of 45°. Two shafts, one 60 feet and\r\none 52 feet, had been sunk at the time this information was obtained. At\r\nthe bottom of the 52-foot shaft a drift 38 feet in length has been run\r\non the vein. Surface cuts and trenches are quite numerous on the several\r\nclaims, and a large amount of quartz containing gold had been exposed.\r\nFree gold could be seen in considerable quantity in some of the porous\r\nquartz. The quartz is thoroughly crystalline, showing many cavities as a\r\nresult of the decomposition and leaching out of the sulphuretted\r\nminerals it originally contained. These cavities are all lined with\r\nminute quartz crystals, which have been deposited evidently since the\r\nremoval of the sulphides. Rock of this description is full of gold,\r\nseemingly. It is so loose in texture that careless handling shakes out\r\nthe golden grains. John Anderson, of San Bernardino, one of the owners,\r\nvolunteered the information that from 2 to 4 feet of this rock sampled\r\n$100 to $150 per ton. The owners had determined the latter part of April\r\nto ship this free-milling ore to The Needles, where a mill was being\r\nconstructed. Some of the quartz from the lowest workings contains small\r\ncrystals of pyrite and chalcopyrite, but it would still be classed as an\r\nore susceptible of free amalgamation. The Ibex property had a promising\r\nlook in the spring of 1892. Its further development will be looked to\r\nwith great interest by all interested in desert mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MONTE NEGRAS DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nNear the south boundary of San Bernardino County, and about 75 miles\r\ndirectly east of Mount San Bernardino, a new mining district has been\r\norganized within the past two years, and considerable development work\r\naccomplished by the claim owners, who, as usual, are men of limited\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThis district is 22 miles northeast of Cottonwood Springs, 16 miles\r\nnorth of Eagle Mountain, and about 6 miles south from Virginia Dale. The\r\nbelt is about 1½ miles in width and 5 miles in length. The veins trend\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\nThis new district, which has been named the Monte Negras, or Black\r\nMountain District, has attracted considerable attention by the discovery\r\nin one of the claims of nuggets of gold and quartz of extreme richness.\r\nAt the time of this discovery some newspapers in this county published\r\nthe report that the mythical “Pegleg Smith” Mine had actually been\r\nfound, which only added to the excitement produced by the bringing into\r\nSan Bernardino of several hundred dollars worth of specimens.\r\n\r\nI visited this new district in the month of May, 1892, and spent several\r\ndays in making an examination of the claims and adjacent country. The\r\nMonte Negras camp is on the south side of the range of hills 45 miles\r\nnortheast of Walters Station, on the line of the Southern Pacific\r\nRailroad, being reached by a fair desert road. By fair I mean a heavy,\r\nbut not rough or hilly road.\r\n\r\nWalters Station is nearly 200 feet below the level of the sea. From that\r\npoint every foot of the way is up hill, till a divide near Cottonwood\r\nSprings is reached, at an altitude of 3,157 feet, the distance being 27\r\nmiles; from there to the foot of the wash, which extends 2 or 3 miles\r\nfrom the base of the mountains, down hill 19 miles, where the altitude\r\nis 1,300 feet. The altitude of the camp is 1,520 feet. All the mines\r\nlying back in the mountains are at higher, though varying, altitudes,\r\nthe greatest elevation being 3,500 feet, at the Ramona. The neighboring\r\npeaks rise from 200 to 800 feet higher.\r\n\r\nThis district is distant about 35 miles from Cadiz, on the line of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Railroad. I have never traveled the road, and know\r\nnothing of it, although I am told it is a good desert road. Wood is not\r\nobtainable at all in the vicinity of the mines, and water is scarce, but\r\nhas been obtained by sinking a well in a basin at Virginia Dale, a few\r\nmiles north of these mines. A shaft was sunk 140 feet in the wash 3\r\nmiles south of the most southerly Monte Negras mines, but no water was\r\nobtained. Bedrock was not reached at the depth mentioned, but it is not\r\nunlikely water may be secured by continuing this shaft downward.\r\n\r\nI mention all these drawbacks to what I otherwise believe to be\r\npromising property, because I think the difficulties may be offset by\r\nthe fact that the ore is high grade.\r\n\r\nThe Monte Negras uplift consists, as far as my observation extended,\r\nentirely of eruptive rocks, diorite, quartz porphyry, and fine-grained\r\nmore or less porphyritic rocks, cut by later dikes of felsite and\r\ndark-green or black diorite. Epidote occurs in great quantity throughout\r\nthe region, usually associated with micaceous iron ore, which is found\r\nin the form of veins and bunches everywhere. The iron ores contain no\r\nprecious metals, and are of no economic importance.\r\n\r\nThe region, although entirely eruptive, and in part volcanic (large\r\nfields of basalt occurring on the western slopes) is in the immediate\r\nvicinity of a large hill called Pinto, or Painted Mountain, which is\r\nmade up of metamorphic strata, chloritic and hornblende rocks, quartzite\r\nand mica schist predominating.\r\n\r\nThe mineral-bearing veins of the Monte Negras District are all of the\r\nfissure type, and are mostly quite simple in form. The gangue is quartz,\r\ncarrying iron and copper sulphurets, and the secondary products of those\r\nminerals, iron oxide and copper carbonate, with gold and silver. No lead\r\nor zinc was observed. The economic value of the ore lies almost,\r\nevidently, in its gold contents, the silver occurring so sparingly as to\r\namount to very little. The bullion obtained from these ores is worth\r\nabout $17 per ounce. The ore ranges in value from $20 to over $100 per\r\nton. Observations on the principal mines of this district, viz.: Great\r\nEastern, Venus, Columbus, Summit, Porcupine, Schiller, Hillerman, Annie\r\nRooney, Ethel, Republican, Ramona, McKinley Bill, and Revenue, have to\r\nbe omitted in order to condense the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SAN DIEGO COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                By W. H. Storms, Assistant in the Field.\r\n\r\nThere has been no marked development of mines in this county since the\r\nlast report was issued, excepting in some of the districts of the\r\nColorado Desert, of which mention will be made. The general geological\r\nand topographical features of this county have been so fully described\r\nin former reports that to repeat them here is unnecessary. At various\r\ntimes within the past two years new discoveries have been announced, and\r\nthese have been developed to a greater or less extent, and in some\r\ninstances, at least, with encouraging results.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HELVETIA MINE.\r\n\r\nThis mine is located a short distance from the town of Julian, and is\r\nequipped with a steam hoist and mill combined under one roof. The new\r\nshaft, which was started nearly three years ago, was sunk on the vein\r\nfor 50 feet, at an angle of 75°, at which depth the shaft left the\r\ncrevice and continued vertically to a depth of 225 feet. From this point\r\na crosscut was started back toward the vein, running at an angle with\r\nits strike, the idea being to reach a pay shoot as quickly as possible.\r\nThe shoot in question was the south extension of that developed in the\r\nold workings. The vein was encountered, and the drift continued along\r\nits course. At about 30 feet from the point of intersecting the vein in\r\nthis drift of the shoot was found. It was hard, blue, rather\r\nglassy-looking quartz, filled with minute black particles, and showing\r\nconsiderable gold, some of the rock being very high grade.\r\n\r\nThe drift was continued along the vein, and finally reached a point over\r\nthe level that had been run south from the old shaft, which is 300 feet\r\ndeep. This new drift was found to be 14 feet higher than the old level.\r\nThe mine was completely drained at the time of my visit, and a free\r\ncirculation of pure air was found throughout the workings. The ground\r\nwas ready for stoping, but owing to some legal difficulties arising the\r\nproperty was lying idle.\r\n\r\nThe appended sketch will give an idea of the present development of the\r\nHelvetia, which is one of the most promising properties in the district,\r\nand a type of the best class of mines of its kind found there.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetia, like other mines of the district, occurs in the\r\ncrystalline schists, the quartz being found as lenses inclosed in the\r\ncountry rock. Some of the lenses might be mistaken for fissures, but I\r\nfailed to see one possessing the characteristics of a “fissure.”\r\n\r\nNearly all the lenses exhibit a tendency to “make” into the hanging wall\r\nside of the country rock, the lenses of quartz following each other in a\r\ngeneral direction, but at an angle with the stratification of the\r\nschists, and are separate and distinct from each other, being separated\r\nat the ends (where they sometimes overlap) by the “leaves,” as they may\r\nbe termed, of the schistose country rock. These lenses were doubtless\r\ncaused by a compressive stress on the schists, which had a tendency to\r\nsplit them, but was not powerful enough to cause an abrupt fracture. The\r\naccompanying sketch may convey an idea of the occurrence of these quartz\r\nlenses.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _WORKINGS OF THE HELVETIA MINE NEAR JULIAN_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _LENTICULAR QUARTZ BODIES IN SCHISTOSE ROCK_]\r\n\r\nBy the above sketch it will be observed that there is a tendency on the\r\npart of the quartz lenses to follow a given direction, which lies at a\r\nsmall angle across the strike of the schists, and that these lenses are\r\nnot connected, but occur independently, though all are the result of the\r\nsame force which flexed and split the strata.\r\n\r\nOther mines about Julian were idle at the time of my visit, the most of\r\nthem being inaccessible, owing to water in the workings. Considerable\r\nmoney has been expended on the Owens Mine in an attempt to drain and\r\nrecover the workings, but it was abandoned after several months of work\r\nand considerable expense.\r\n\r\nMore activity was exhibited in the mines about Banner than any other\r\npart of the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           READY RELIEF MINE.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest and most extensively developed mine near Banner. It\r\nhas earned considerable fame, not only as a producer, but for the\r\npeculiarities exhibited in the formation of its bunches of quartz, which\r\ncontain disseminated grains and masses of pyrite.\r\n\r\nThe Ready Relief has several levels, all of which are connected by\r\nwinzes and shafts. The huge bunches of quartz have, from their peculiar\r\nform, been denominated “rolls,” and I know of no better term which would\r\nconvey a clear idea of their appearance. As a result of close\r\nobservation made at numerous points in the mine and on the surface at\r\nthe time of my visit, I formed the conclusion that the “rolls” of the\r\nReady Relief Mine simply represent an exaggerated condition of the same\r\nsort of flexing of the schists that has produced the other mines of this\r\ndistrict. The facts as observed lead me to the belief that the “rolls”\r\nor folds of the Ready Relief Mine, and its extensions, both north and\r\nsouth, are the result of a severe compressive stress upon the schists at\r\nright angle to a line running nearly northwest and southeast; that this\r\nforce was exerted in the form of pressure and not of contraction; that\r\nas a result of this pressure there is a tendency exhibited on the part\r\nof the contorted strata to form a reverse fault and not a normal one,\r\nand that this power expended itself before the rocks were forced to\r\nyield to the strain to the extent of fracture, the result being an\r\nabrupt crumpling of the schists without disruption.\r\n\r\nAlong this line of disturbance percolating waters have deposited silica\r\nin enormous quantities. The schistose folded masses having been\r\ncompletely metamorphosed, massive quartz replacing the crushed and\r\ncrumpled crystalline rocks, though the lines of its former schistose\r\nstructure are in many places preserved.\r\n\r\nA sketch of a characteristic section is here reproduced, and it may help\r\nthe reader to form some conception of this unusual occurrence of\r\ngold-bearing quartz. The strike of the country rock is about northwest\r\nand southeast, and varies but little from this over a wide area. The\r\nrock is, generally speaking, a dark gray, rather close-grained,\r\nmicaceous rock (argillite), having a dip to the east of about 80°. The\r\nsuccession of folds cut across the dip of the schists at an angle about\r\n45° from the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in places several of the rolls lie side by side.\r\nWhere this occurs the pay shoot is very large. The thickness of the\r\nindividual rolls varies from a few inches to 5 or 6 feet, and where the\r\nfolds parallel each other a width of 12 to 20 feet or more is not\r\nuncommon. These rolls do not extend longitudinally a great distance, but\r\nseem to gradually diminish, being followed by others along the strike of\r\nthe vein. It seems quite evident that had the stress which produced this\r\nfolding or crumpling of the schists proceeded much farther an abrupt\r\nfracture must have resulted, and the Ready Relief vein would have been a\r\nfissure having a dip of about 45°.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit the Bailey Bros. were overhauling their mill of\r\nten stamps and were putting in a 12-foot waterwheel of the Pelton style.\r\n\r\nThough large amounts of quartz have been stoped from the Ready Relief\r\nthere were still thousands of tons in the mine. Mr. Bailey informed the\r\nwriter that the rock averaged about $15 per ton.\r\n\r\nThe other claims which occur along the same course as the Ready Relief\r\nare quite similar from a geological standpoint, though none of them\r\nexhibit the peculiarities of the folds in such a marked degree. Among\r\nthe prominent mines on this belt are the Hubbard claims, which were\r\nbeing operated in the spring of 1892, the Redman, Antelope, Cincinnati\r\nBelle, and some others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE RUBY MINE.\r\n\r\nThis mine is located a short distance east of and parallel with the\r\nReady Relief. It occurs at the contact of mica schist and syenite. A new\r\nfive-stamp mill was in course of construction at the time of my visit,\r\nin which it was intended to crush quartz from the Ruby and Wilcox, an\r\nadjoining location. A small force was employed at the mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE KENTUCK S.\r\n\r\nSince the last report was published the Kentuck S came into prominence\r\nonce more under the ownership of a St. Louis syndicate. A vigorous\r\npolicy was inaugurated, and for a time all seemingly went well. The\r\nshoot of quartz, which had been opened to some depth, crops out along\r\nthe flank of the steep mountain side. The vein pitches into the hill at\r\na high angle. The manager selected a place to start a new vertical,\r\nthree-compartment shaft at a point up the hill about 100 feet above the\r\ncroppings. The shaft was started and was fully equipped. Massive timbers\r\nwere placed in the most approved style. At a depth of 100 feet the work\r\nhas reached the level of the croppings, and had cost, it is said,\r\n$10,000, and it was still about 125 feet down to a connection with the\r\nvein. Here the work was stopped, and has never since been resumed,\r\nstanding an excellent example of how not to open a mine. The money\r\nexpended in this shaft would have driven a crosscut tunnel from the base\r\nof the hill to the vein, giving at least 500 feet of backs, affording a\r\ncheap means of draining, ventilating, and exploiting the mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CINCINNATI BELLE.\r\n\r\nAmong the most promising properties I saw about Banner is the Cincinnati\r\nBelle, which has made quite a record as a producer of rock of high\r\ngrade. This mine, together with several other claims, was purchased by a\r\nPomona company in 1890, for the purpose of operating these mines, among\r\nthem being the Gold King and Gold Queen Mines, of which mention will be\r\nmade hereafter. The Cincinnati Belle is situated about 3,000 feet\r\nnorthwest from the town of Banner, and is in charge of D. C. Lane.\r\n\r\nThe shoots or lenses of quartz which constitute the so-called ore bodies\r\nof this mine occur in a general course along the strike of the schists,\r\nthough each succeeding lens to the northeast “makes” into the hanging\r\nwall, as indicated in the cut under the head of Helvetia Mine.\r\n\r\nThe mine was developed by a tunnel of 168 feet in length, of which the\r\nfirst 40 feet required timbering. Near the mouth of the tunnel a shaft\r\nhas been sunk on the pitch of the quartz lenses, to a depth of 200 feet.\r\nLevels were opened at intervals of 50 feet. The first level at the top\r\nhad been cut 168 feet along the course of the lead; the second 68 feet;\r\nthe third 120 feet; the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 50 feet. Each\r\nlevel exposed a bluish quartz rock, which returns in the mill from $18\r\nto $40 per ton. It is free milling, and is treated by a simple\r\namalgamation process.\r\n\r\nThough this quartz contains some pyrite, which is auriferous, carrying\r\n$8 to $10 per ton, no attempt is made to save the sulphide. The mine\r\nmakes but little water, and all the quartz and waste are hoisted in a\r\nbucket. Pine timber is used, which grows in the neighboring mountains\r\nabove the mine. It costs 11 cents per running foot at the mine. The\r\nproperty was only under process of development at the time of my\r\nexamination, and as but little stoping has been done, the cost of mining\r\nper ton could not be arrived at. The lenses vary greatly in size,\r\nranging from a few inches to 4 feet. The vein or mineral-bearing zone is\r\naccompanied by a fissure, which runs along nearly parallel with the\r\nquartz at a distance of a few feet on the hanging wall side. This fault\r\nhas resulted in the crushing of the country rock along its course.\r\n\r\nIn this vein, as it may be called, the rock has been completely changed,\r\nclay, talcose, and chloritic mineral replacing the micaceous rock. This\r\nmineral contains some gold. The inclined shaft has two compartments and\r\nis substantially timbered throughout. From the mine the company has\r\ngraded, along the mountain side, 4,000 feet of road, over which the\r\nquartz is transported to the mill in the town of Banner at an expense of\r\n75 cents per ton. The mill contains ten stamps.\r\n\r\nThe mill is quite complete, but poor judgment was shown in the\r\narrangement by the management under whose supervision it was built,\r\nwhich was before the present Superintendent was in charge. As an\r\ninstance, the rock from the mine when delivered at the mill is dumped\r\ninto an ore bin outside the mill. The rock is then taken inside as\r\nrequired and dumped on a grizzly. As usual the large pieces fall on the\r\ncrusher floor, where they are fed by hand into the jaw rock-breaker,\r\nwhich stands above the level of the floor. This sort of management\r\nnecessitates extra and unnecessary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE GOLD KING AND GOLD QUEEN MINES\r\n\r\nAre located about 4 miles west from Banner, and are owned by the Pomona\r\ncompany, that owns the Cincinnati Belle. Only four men were employed in\r\nthese mines at the time of my visit, prospecting work only being done.\r\nThe quartz raised from these workings is hauled 11 miles by road to\r\nBanner. The quartz is high grade, and pays well, but no large amount was\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE STONEWALL MINE\r\n\r\nIs located about 8 miles southwest from Banner on the Cuyamaca grant,\r\nbelonging to the Waterman estate. The Superintendent, Waldo S. Waterman,\r\ninformed the writer that nothing of special interest had been developed\r\nin the mine since the publication of the last report (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MESA GRANDE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the northwest from Julian is located the Mesa Grande\r\nDistrict, where lenses of a yellowish pellucid quartz of semi-granular\r\ntexture have been developed somewhat. All of this quartz contains gold,\r\nand some of it is quite rich; but nothing of consequence has been done\r\nof late, further than to organize a stock company.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ESCONDIDO MINES.\r\n\r\nNear the flourishing little town of Escondido are some old Mexican\r\nmines, which have been acquired by a San Diego company. The veins are\r\ngold-bearing, the quartz having formerly been worked in arrastras with\r\nevidently good results, as the surface workings are quite extensive.\r\nWithin the past two years, however, little has been done on the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PINE VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Valley Mines lie 6 miles from the Stonewall and San Diego Stage\r\nroad, the nearest station being Descanso. Two mills, one of five and one\r\nof two stamps, crush the rock taken from the veins in the vicinity. This\r\nquartz, it was claimed, would mill over $50 per ton. The veins occur in\r\na formation similar to that about Julian and Banner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       REPORTED TIN DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nFrequently there have been rumors of the discovery of tin stone in San\r\nDiego County, but up to this time no such ores are known to exist\r\noutside of the property known as the Temescal Mines, which are located\r\non the line of San Bernardino and San Diego Counties. However, in the\r\nlarge crystalline area which extends over a considerable portion of San\r\nDiego County, it would not be strange to find tin stone under conditions\r\nsimilar to those which obtain in the Harney Peak region in the Black\r\nHills of Dakota. There the cassiterite is found in good-sized crystals\r\nand finely disseminated grains in a matrix of coarse-grained granite,\r\nwhich has been thrust up through the schists in the form of intrusive\r\ndikes of greater or less size. It usually is associated with tourmaline,\r\nwolfram, and other black minerals, making it difficult to distinguish it\r\nwithout making a test of some sort. The search for tin in San Diego\r\nCounty has been confined to looking for a black rock similar to that\r\nfound in the Cajalco Mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DULZURA DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe Dulzura Mining District is 30 miles east and a little south of the\r\ncity of San Diego, in a range of rather rugged mountains. Metamorphic\r\nrocks occur frequently, but masses of igneous rock have been intruded\r\nand constitute large hills throughout the district. Among these rocks\r\nare a light, greenish-gray feldspar porphyry, a dark-green, fine-grained\r\ndiorite, a black aphanitic diorite, sometimes porphyritic, and a light\r\ncream-colored or greenish-white felsitic rock. In the immediate vicinity\r\nof Dulzura the latter rock occurs in the form of immense dikes striking\r\nnorthwest and southeast, crossing Cottonwood Creek to the south into\r\nMexico. In one of these great dikes, which is several hundred feet in\r\nwidth, the mines of the district are found. They are principally\r\nchambered veins occurring on the line of a fault plane which has\r\nfractured the felsite, the hanging wall side of the slip going down, the\r\nmovement causing the rock to become crushed and broken. Percolating\r\nwaters have carried into the crushed mass mineral solutions, which have\r\ndeposited the ores, chiefly iron sulphurets, where the most favorable\r\nconditions were found along the line of this fault plane. The subsequent\r\noxidizing of the masses of ore thus formed has stained the rock a bright\r\nor dark red and sometimes yellow.\r\n\r\nThe rock contains gold ranging from a trace to $20 or over per ton. It\r\nwas said the average was about $8. The oxidation of the ore bodies does\r\nnot extend to any very great depth, the result being the occurrence of\r\nsulphuretted ores comparatively near the surface, though it was claimed\r\nby the mine owners that the sulphurets contained sufficient gold to make\r\nconcentration and treatment by chlorination profitable. The mines are\r\nquite interesting from a geological point of view, and may, in time,\r\nprove equally so from a financial standpoint. No machinery had been\r\nbuilt at the time of my visit. The felsite throughout the district,\r\nwhenever observed, contained a considerable amount of pyrite, the\r\nsurface rock nearly always presenting a highly mineralized appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JAMUL CEMENT ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe Jamul Portland Cement Mine and works are located on the Jamul\r\nrancho, 22 miles east of the city of San Diego. The company began the\r\nconstruction of expensive works in the spring of 1890, which were not\r\ncompleted until June, 1891, at a cost of $50,000. Seven kilns were\r\nconstructed, together with large buildings. The capacity of the works is\r\nabout 150 barrels a day. When in operation over forty men are employed\r\nat the mine and works.\r\n\r\nThe transportation problem proved a more serious one than had been\r\nanticipated, it costing more to haul cement from Jamul to San Diego than\r\nit costs to bring English Portland cement to California by vessel. The\r\ncement made by this company has been quite extensively used throughout\r\nSouthern California.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ASBESTOS.\r\n\r\nThe John D. Hoff Asbestos Company, of San Diego, is operating an\r\nasbestos mine in the San Jacinto Mountains, from the product of which a\r\nvariety of fire-proof material is made, including roof paints, roofing,\r\nboiler and steam-pipe covering, fire-clay goods, etc. This is the only\r\nasbestos concern in the southern part of the State, and the business\r\nseems to be on the increase. The works are located near Pacific Beach, 7\r\nmiles from San Diego. Asbestos is also found near Palm Springs, in the\r\nSan Jacinto Mountains, and several miles east of Indio.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PINACATE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nNear the line of San Bernardino and San Diego Counties, about 5 to 8\r\nmiles west from the town of Perris, are the mines of the Pinacate\r\nDistrict, all being veins of quartz-bearing gold. In past years this\r\ndistrict has produced a large amount of bullion, the quartz being worked\r\nin arrastras, the beds of over a hundred of which still may be seen\r\nscattered about.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous springs of small size in the district, but timber is\r\nvery scarce. The formation is syenite and granite principally;\r\noccasionally schistose and gneissoid rocks and quartzites being\r\nobserved. The entire region is metamorphic, excepting a few dikes of\r\ngranite (pegmatite) and quartz porphyry. Diorite is found near the Good\r\nHope Mine. The region is one easily accessible, and but 4 to 8 miles\r\nfrom a railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             STEELE’S MINE.\r\n\r\nTo the northwest of the Good Hope Mine is the Victor Mine, formerly “La\r\nPlomo.” This mine is now better known as the Steele Mine. The vein is a\r\nfoot or more in width, consisting of a highly crystalline quartz, in\r\nwhich is disseminated a small amount of iron and lead sulphuret and lead\r\ncarbonate. The rock is quite rich in gold, some of it showing gold\r\nwithout the aid of a lens.\r\n\r\nA tunnel 900 feet in length had been run to develop the vein, on which\r\nan inclined shaft had been sunk to a depth of 200 feet. Besides this\r\nwork there were numerous other superficial workings, in which quartz of\r\ngood grade was exposed. The vein occurs in a region of metamorphic\r\nrocks, the foot wall containing much quartz and biotite mica. The\r\nhanging wall is dark gray color, and quite fine-grained in texture.\r\nHornblende crystals are plentiful throughout the rock. Other rocks in\r\nthe vicinity are mica schist, chloritic rocks, quartzite, and other more\r\nmassive crystalline rocks. Granitic dikes (pegmatite) cut the formation\r\non all sides, none of them being very large. These dikes are\r\ncharacterized by their exceptionally coarse crystallization. Good-sized\r\ntourmalines, of jet black color, are numerous in the granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ROSALIA.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile northwest from the Victor is the Old Rosalia, now the Santa\r\nRosa, which is opened along the surface for over 1,000 feet by cuts and\r\nshafts. The upper portion of the vein was worked out years ago, but new\r\ncapital has been interested and a new shaft was being sunk at the north\r\nend of the property.\r\n\r\nThe inclosing rock on either side of the vein is very soft and much\r\ndecomposed, requiring more timber than had ever been used by the former\r\noperators. The mine has produced a large amount of gold, which was\r\nextracted by working the quartz in arrastras, and in later years in a\r\nmill, which still stands on the mine. At the north end it was understood\r\nthat the shoot of pay rock was still intact, and it is to recover this\r\nthat the new work was being inaugurated. The balance of the shoot to the\r\nsouth has all been worked out down to the water-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SANTA FE.\r\n\r\nNot over half a mile from the Rosalia is the old Santa Fe Mine, which in\r\ndays gone by was a producer of gold, but its workings had long been\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SHAY MINE\r\n\r\nIs also in the Pinacate District, 6 miles west of Perris. Several holes\r\nhave been sunk on the vein, but the entire lower portion of the mine was\r\nflooded and could not be examined. The quartz is a bluish, ribbon-like\r\nrock, and carries considerable gold. The owner from lack of means is\r\nunable to work the mine.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other mines or veins in the district, many of which\r\nhave been worked in former years by Mexicans, who coyoted about, working\r\nthe narrow seams and crushing the quartz in arrastras. These veins are\r\nnow abandoned, and no one seems to have sufficient faith in their value\r\nto undertake anything like systematic development. The veins mostly lie\r\nquite flat in granite or syenitic rocks. They are usually from 4 to 16\r\ninches in thickness and extend some distance. Roads are constructed to\r\nnearly all of them. It seems like a region promising good returns on\r\nsmall investments. One ten-stamp custom mill could crush the rock for\r\nall the veins of this district. I was informed that much of the rock\r\nreturned from $60 to over $100 per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MENIFEE MINE\r\n\r\nIs located south of Perris about 8 miles. The vein contains gold-bearing\r\nquartz. The foot wall is a chloritic schist, back of which lies a\r\nsyenitic rock. The hanging wall is syenitic granite, the hornblende\r\nhaving changed partly to chlorite. The vein is from 1 foot to 30 inches\r\nin width, and strikes northeast and southwest, dipping west 80° to a\r\ndepth of 40 feet, where it flattens out to 65°. The quartz mills about\r\n$15 per ton, and contains but a small percentage of sulphurets. There\r\nare four shafts on the vein, varying from 35 to 60 feet in depth, the\r\nmain shaft having a double compartment, being 5 by 11 feet. They have a\r\nfive-stamp mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE WALKER CLAIM.\r\n\r\nWithin a mile of the Menifee, in a northeasterly direction, a new\r\ndiscovery was made in the spring of 1892 of a quartz vein which occurs\r\non a low mound at the base of low, rolling hills. The vein was small, 4\r\ninches to a foot, quite heavily mineralized, but much broken. Two\r\ndistinct faults occurred in a length of 90 feet, where the vein had been\r\nexposed. Two shafts were down 30 feet each, and water was coming in. The\r\nfinding of specimen rock had created quite an excitement in the\r\nvicinity, and visitors were numerous. The rock, I judged, would pan out\r\nabout $40, but too small an amount of work had been accomplished to make\r\nany estimate of the value of the vein possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CARGO MUCHACHO MINE.\r\n\r\nIn the Cargo Muchacho District, 30 miles in a northerly direction from\r\nYuma, the Cargo Muchacho Mine has again been in operation within the\r\npast two years. The owners moved the mill from the Paymaster Mine to a\r\nsite near the former property, laid a double pipe-line 14 miles from the\r\nColorado River, and have supplied the camp with water in this manner.\r\nThe latest reports from the district are to the effect that the mill and\r\nmine are being operated steadily, with satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PASADENA MINE.\r\n\r\nAbout one mile north from the Cargo Muchacho is a vein on which several\r\nlocations have been made. Of these the Pasadena and Peterson claims are\r\nmost prominent. The vein covered by the locations has been quite\r\nextensively opened, and possesses many of the features of the Cargo\r\nMuchacho.\r\n\r\nThe quartz was sent, at no small expense, to a mill at El Rio, on the\r\nColorado River. The expense of mining was seldom less than $2 a ton;\r\ntransportation to the S. P. R. R. at Ogilby Station, 6 miles, $2 50;\r\ntransportation by rail to El Rio, 14 miles, 50 cents a ton, making at\r\nleast $5 a ton. The mill was leased at $10 per day, to which the expense\r\nof milling was added, making fully $4 a ton more, or about $9 in all. It\r\nwas claimed that the rock averaged $16. Doubtless some of it did, but it\r\nis probable the expense really exceeded the figures given.\r\n\r\nWith water pumped into the district it is quite possible that this mine,\r\nand the Peterson claim adjoining, may be operated at a profit, which\r\nunder former conditions was impossible. There are many other\r\ngold-bearing veins in the region, but none of them are extensively\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EAGLE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nUnusual activity has characterized operations about that portion of the\r\nColorado Desert, about 90 miles east of the San Bernardino Mountain,\r\nnear the line between San Diego and San Bernardino Counties. The Eagle\r\nMountain District is one of these localities. The discovery of rich\r\nplacers in the dry gulches of that section resulted in a more thorough\r\ninvestigation of its mineral resources and in the finding of some very\r\nrich gold-bearing quartz. Considerable work has been done on these\r\nclaims and the prospects are considered very flattering.\r\n\r\nA cemented basin has been constructed to catch the rain water that falls\r\nduring the winter season, with which it is intended to work the placer\r\nmines. The discoverers of these mines, it is said, took enough gold from\r\nthe gulches, in making the basin referred to, with a dry washer, to pay\r\nfor making and cementing the basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          COTTONWOOD SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six miles in a northeast direction from Walters Station, on the\r\nline of the S. P. R. R., at an altitude of 3,004 feet, is Cottonwood\r\nSprings. A range of mountains, in which occur granitic and metamorphic\r\nrocks and eruptive dikes, strikes east and west across the desert, and\r\nin these occur several springs. There is but one mine in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the springs, and this is known as\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE COYOTE MINE,\r\n\r\nWhere a reading of the aneroid indicated 3,300 feet. The formation in\r\nwhich the Coyote vein has formed is micaceous and hornblende schist and\r\ngneissoid rock; hornblende granite and dikes of diorite also occur in\r\nthe vicinity of the vein. The Coyote Mine is a quartz vein from 2 to 4\r\nfeet in width. The rock is iron stained and occasionally shows free\r\ngold. The vein is developed by two shafts, one about 20 and the other\r\nnearly 80 feet in depth, and strikes 5° north of east, having a dip of\r\n46° to the south. The vein appeared to cut the formation at a small\r\nangle. A fault, which has occurred within the vein, had evidently\r\npuzzled the owners, as at the bottom of the 20-foot shaft they had\r\ndeveloped 8 feet of what looked like solid quartz. The vein is really\r\nbut 4 feet in width at that point, but the fault cutting downward at an\r\nangle of 45° and crossing the strike of the vein at an angle of 27° had\r\nallowed the hanging wall side of the fault to slip downward, thus\r\ndoubling the width of quartz, which was much shattered. The miners had\r\nquit work, leaving what they considered well enough alone. In the deeper\r\nshaft the fault had carried the hanging wall down and to the east a few\r\nfeet, and the vein was lost altogether. A short drift had been run into\r\nthe hanging wall, but not finding the vein, work had been suspended. The\r\nvein lies on the foot wall side and not more than 4 or 5 feet from the\r\nline of the slip.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _FAULT OF COYOTE MINE\r\n    COTTONWOOD SPRINGS_]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SALTON LAKE.\r\n\r\n            By E. B. Preston, E.M., Assistant in the Field.\r\n\r\nThe Coahuila Valley, in which Salton Lake is situated, is 90 miles long\r\nand from 10 to 30 wide. It separates the San Bernardino range of\r\nmountains from the San Jacinto, and forms a part of the great Colorado\r\nDesert in San Diego County. In its deepest portions it is 275 feet below\r\nthe level of the sea; the area of the depressed region is over 1,600\r\nsquare miles. In its northern portion the valley consists of sandhills\r\nand dunes, the former caused by the accumulation of the sand around the\r\nscrub and bushes growing in the desert. The southern portion is bare\r\nclay. On the borders of the desert palm trees of the fan palm variety\r\noccur in a few scattered clusters. The Southern Pacific Railroad passes\r\nthrough the valley on its way to Yuma.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the depression adjacent to the railroad station of\r\nSalton is a salt marsh, where the New Liverpool Salt Company’s works are\r\nlocated, and where a fine quality of table salt is produced, containing,\r\naccording to an analysis made by Thomas Price, of San Francisco:\r\n\r\n  Chloride of sodium              94.68 per cent.\r\n  Calcium sulphate                  .77 per cent.\r\n  Magnesium sulphate               3.12 per cent.\r\n  Sodium sulphate                   .68 per cent.\r\n  Water                             .75 per cent.\r\n                                 100.00 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe brine from which the salt is obtained shows a density of 27° Baumé.\r\n\r\nThe company’s works are situated about 3,000 feet west of the railroad\r\ntrack, and consist of the salt mill and a large storehouse, connected by\r\ntrack with the main line. This branch line extends into the marsh a\r\ndistance of over 10,000 feet. Beyond the end of the track a borehole was\r\nsunk by the company, with the expectation of obtaining water, to a depth\r\nof 300 feet, when the work was interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe strata passed through during the sinking throw some light on the\r\npast condition of the desert depression, as well as furnishing some\r\npoints that may have a bearing on the flooding of this section.\r\n\r\nThe top covering consists of 6 inches of black mud, resting on a crust\r\nof chlorides of sodium and magnesium, 7 inches in thickness. The drill\r\non passing through this crust dropped through 22 feet of a black ooze,\r\ncontaining over 50 per cent of water. Tests of the ooze made at the\r\nState Mining Bureau laboratory showed it to consist largely of chlorides\r\nand carbonates of sodium and magnesium, the soda salts predominating,\r\nbesides fine sand, iron oxide, and clay, and a small amount of organic\r\nmatter. The ooze was resting on a hard clay bottom, through which the\r\ndrill passed for the entire remaining distance, only varied by two or\r\nthree streaks of cement. From the shore line of the marsh toward the\r\nadjacent mountain ranges, the soil consists of a fine sand, containing\r\nclay and a notable quantity of mica, and is strewn with well-preserved\r\nshells of _Planorbis ammon_, Gould, _Physa humerosa_, Gould, and\r\n_Amnicola protea_, Gould.\r\n\r\nIn a few spots near the northwest end of the marsh the accumulated cases\r\nof a species of Caddice worm are found. Northeast of the marsh the\r\nsurface slopes gradually upward to where the remains of an ancient sea\r\nbeach are to be seen, stretching to the south and east to where the\r\nColorado River cuts through on its way to the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nBehind the beach extends a mesa to the foot of the San Bernardino range.\r\nAcross this mesa are evidences of heavy floods coming down the cañons of\r\nthe back range, carrying large quantities of debris with them, mostly\r\nbowlders of mica schists and granitoid rocks, with some quartz\r\nintermixed. On the west side of the marsh the surface has but little\r\nelevation until the granitic bluffs of the San Jacinto range are\r\nreached. These bluffs are coated for a distance of about 25 feet above\r\nthe plain with a sponge-shaped incrustation from 2 to 3 inches thick,\r\nconsisting largely of carbonate of lime, chloride of sodium, sand, clay,\r\nand oxide of iron; under the glass some of the pores are seen to contain\r\nminute shells of the same varieties as found on the sand of the plain.\r\nWhere arroyos have been cut through the sands of the plains to the depth\r\nof several feet, the exposed sections show a stratified arrangement of\r\nthe sand, having between the layers a thin division of the same\r\nvarieties of shells as found on the surface, the whole resting on a firm\r\nclay bottom. From the position and regularity, as well as the quantity\r\nof these shells, on top of the different strata of sand, while but few\r\nare seen scattered through the sand layers, a periodicity of the\r\nconditions favorable to their existence and growth, as well as a\r\ncomparatively sudden cessation of the same, must be inferred. These\r\nconditions mean an occasional flooding of the depression for a period of\r\ntime, during which a shallow body of water was maintained, which\r\nevaporated as soon as the water supply was shut off. In what manner this\r\ncan occur will be shown later on. The plain supports a scant growth of\r\ndesert shrubs, with some mesquite bushes in the vicinity of the few\r\nsprings that are found scattered over the desert, most of which are\r\nsaline. The presence of the extensive line of sea beach proves that at\r\nsome time the gulf has extended much farther inland than at present,\r\ncovering the whole of this depression. The Colorado River, in its course\r\nsouth to the ocean, built up a flood plain on a higher level that\r\nfinally shut off the western part from a direct communication with the\r\nsea, and evaporation, with a gradual uplifting of this whole section,\r\nfinally laid it bare, although leaving a great part of it still below\r\nthe present sea-level. Under these conditions, whenever more water comes\r\ndown the river than its banks can contain, the silt-formed shores give\r\nway to the increased pressure and permit the excess of water to flow to,\r\nand gather in, what is termed the river swamp at the back of the flood\r\nplain, from whence it either re-enters the river lower down in its\r\ncourse, or finds its way into the depression.\r\n\r\nThe Salton Marsh at present acts as the catchment basin for the waters\r\ndraining from the east side of the San Jacinto range, Carizoo Creek, and\r\na part of the San Bernardino Mountain range, and in times of extreme\r\nhigh waters as a reservoir for the excess in the Colorado River. In the\r\nmonth of June, 1891, a steady flow of water entered the depression from\r\nthe southeast and continued to the northwest uninterruptedly until an\r\narea 30 miles long and averaging 10 miles in width was covered to a\r\ndepth of 6 feet, measured at the end of the Salton Salt Works branch\r\ntrack. When first examined the water showed a density of 7° Baumé, which\r\ngradually increased to 25° Baumé. The mother liquor used in making salt\r\nat the New Liverpool works usually shows a density of 27° Baumé. This\r\nsalt water gave rise to the idea that the waters from the gulf had made\r\nan inroad through some underground channel, and to prove the source and\r\npossible permanency of these waters several investigating parties were\r\nsent out. No such previous incursion had been witnessed by the settlers,\r\nbut inquiry proved that a similar lake existed here in 1849. Finally one\r\nof the parties showed that the Colorado River was the source, and then\r\nthe question was brought to the attention of the State Mining Bureau to\r\ninvestigate as to the probability of the permanency of the lake and its\r\nprobable effect on the climate of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado in its great length accumulates a large amount of sediment,\r\nfrom 0.1 to 0.4 per cent per gallon, and after this has been deposited\r\nthe water on evaporation is found to contain 0.14 grammes solid residue,\r\nconsisting largely of sulphate of soda and chloride of sodium. With the\r\nsediment the river is all the time building up its flood plain, and it\r\nmay not be out of place to recall the general laws that govern the\r\nactions of streams while depositing the solid matter they carry in\r\nsuspension.\r\n\r\nCurrents bearing sediments deposit a large percentage as soon as their\r\nvelocity is checked in the least, but pick up deposited sediments again\r\nas soon as the current is increased. Thus a variable current is\r\ndepositing at one point while eroding deposits at other points.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of a river current varies with the seasons on account of\r\nthe different volumes of water carried, but it also varies at different\r\npoints of the river, during the different hours of the day, through the\r\nconstant action of the laws of erosion and deposition. The banks not\r\nfurnishing a constant, even resistance, erode in the looser parts,\r\ncausing each time a deflection of the current, as well as a change in\r\nthe velocity. This action soon changes a straight stream with an even\r\ncurrent, to a serpentine course with currents of different velocities,\r\nas the outside of a curve has always greater speed than the inside;\r\nconsequently the outer edge is eroding while the inner is depositing\r\nsediment. The Colorado River, in the lower part of its course from Yuma\r\ndown, overflows its flood plain, and deposits thereon a certain amount\r\nof sediment during every high water. This flood plain extends back for\r\nseveral miles on the west bank, showing a succession of benches or\r\nlevees running parallel with the stream on a higher level than the back\r\ncountry. The water, when high enough to reach over these benches,\r\ngathers in the back part, where it evaporates, leaving a mud that\r\ngreatly enriches the soil. These levees are the result of the law quoted\r\nabove, as the water in the regular channel flows swifter than on the\r\nflood plain; consequently on the border of the two a large amount of\r\nsediment is thrown down. As these border lands are only covered during\r\nthe highest floods, they maintain a growth of willows and poplars that\r\ngives the banks a greater stability, and preserves them to a certain\r\nextent from the erosive force of the current.\r\n\r\nA source of changes in the direction of the main current is the\r\nstranding of logs and tree tops brought down from the upper courses of\r\nthe river, as the sediment accumulates behind them and forms islands in\r\nmidstream. Several of these are to be seen in the river channel in\r\npassing down the stream.\r\n\r\nFrom soundings made across a section of the river at the railroad bridge\r\nat Yuma, the depth was found to vary from 2½ feet to 21 feet. At the\r\nmeter placed in the main channel the indicator showed a depth of 17\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAt ordinary high water, caused by the annual rising of the Gila River,\r\nor of the Colorado in its upper reaches, which events usually occur at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, the meter has not been known to show a\r\ndepth of over 28 feet, but in consequence of a co-equal rise in both\r\nstreams during the past season, the meter registered over 33 feet. This\r\nexcess filled the river swamp on the right bank, where the erosive force\r\nof the current was most effective.\r\n\r\nThe course of the river below Yuma for several miles is to the west,\r\nuntil the neighborhood of El Rio station is reached, where sandstone\r\nbluffs on the right bank deflect the current back to its general south\r\ncourse. A little back from the river below this point is a small,\r\nisolated range of hills, known as Pilot Knob, formed of granite,\r\nfissured with seams of dioritic rock. The granite shows lamination, and\r\nthe surface of the rocks is polished by the constant attrition of the\r\ndrifting sands. The beach near Pilot Knob is cemented into a calcareous\r\nconglomerate, underlaid by sand in a loose state. After resuming its\r\nsouthern course the river for several miles follows a straight reach,\r\nuntil below Hanlon’s Ferry. The tendency of the current to bear more to\r\nthe right bank shows itself now in the formation of sloughs and inlets\r\nthat absorb a large proportion of the water and form several islands,\r\nshallowing that part of the river that passes down the proper channel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _SECTION OF COLORADO RIVER AT YUMA_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _DETAIL OF BREAK\r\n    IN\r\n    COLORADO RIVER_]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows the different channels in detail. Formerly\r\nthe water from these outside channels returned through the bend marked\r\n“sand” to the main stream, but at the present time it passes through a\r\ncrevasse in the bend, marked Tapscott and Carter Rivers, furnishing the\r\nlargest portion of the water that ultimately found its way into the\r\ndepression of Salton Lake. During the extreme high water the western\r\nbank from El Rio down, which is formed entirely of silt, was broken\r\nthrough in numerous places, and the mostly shallow channels either\r\nentered the river again below, or accumulated their waters on the back\r\npart of the flood plain, and by following the natural hollows and\r\ngullies gradually wound their way in the direction of the old Yuma road.\r\nThe great force of the current soon cut down below the level of the\r\nriver bed and relieved in part the congested condition. The grade being\r\ngradually to the west, the water cut through the sediment in that\r\ndirection, partly to the Yuma road, partly farther south parallel to the\r\nRio El Medio, which, judging from analogy, owes its origin to some\r\nformer similar condition of the river.\r\n\r\nTapscott River may have been formed prior to Carter River, as it has a\r\nbetter defined channel; the latter has no regular channel, but seems to\r\nhave been caused by the excess of water that could not enter the former,\r\nfollowing depressions and sloughs which have no direct connection with\r\none another. At the time these observations were made, the estimated\r\nvolume of water in the river at the Yuma bridge was about 3,700 cubic\r\nfeet per second, and at the crevasse forming Tapscott and Carter Rivers,\r\ntwo fifths of the entire volume of water in the river was passing\r\nthrough, but none of it was reaching Salton Lake. Of this two fifths not\r\nmore than 20 cubic feet per second was running through Carter River.\r\n\r\nBeyond Alamo Mocho, which is on the old Yuma road, at the time of the\r\nflood, the water flowed into a number of lagoons, and thence into New\r\nRiver, following the old channel that was cut at the time of the 1849\r\noverflow, and thus reaching and forming Salton Lake. All of the water\r\nleaving the main river at present finds its way down through the Hardy\r\nColorado back to the Colorado proper, or evaporates.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this article mention was made of a borehole that was\r\nsunk by the new Liverpool Salt Company in the salt marsh, and which\r\nrevealed under a thin crust of mud and salt a depression filled with\r\nooze, composed largely of magnesium and sodium salts. This ooze is\r\nprobably the final resultant of the evaporations of the former sea\r\nwater, and which, from the well-known avidity of the magnesian salts for\r\nmoisture, is kept in this condition of ooze through the natural drainage\r\nand seepage waters. This depression may extend beyond the borders of the\r\npresent marsh toward the gulf, covered over by the sand, and may have\r\nsome relation with the small so-called mud volcanoes southeast of the\r\nlake near the station of Volcano, as well as with some openings in the\r\nground mentioned by one of the gentlemen who investigated these regions\r\nbetween the Colorado River and the lake, and of which he stated that any\r\namount of water running into them did not seem to fill them. Should such\r\na connection exist, the water pouring in from the river would have\r\ndissolved the thin salt crust where exposed, and opened a channel,\r\npermitting a rapid filling in of the water which formed the lake, for\r\notherwise a body of water running over this light sand and under such a\r\ndry, hot temperature would hardly have filled up the depression as\r\nrapidly as was the case. Besides, this would explain the reason for the\r\nfresh waters of the Colorado River attaining so rapidly a density of\r\nover 20° Baumé. Should this supposition prove correct, and it could\r\neasily be ascertained by a series of shallow boreholes, it might be\r\nexpected that every large overflow in the Colorado River in this\r\ndirection would result in a repetition of Salton Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few palpable typos.\r\n\r\n—Transcribed handwritten in-photo captions.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
