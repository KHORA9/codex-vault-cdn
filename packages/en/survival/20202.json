Prune Trees for Fillers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walnut Confections_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT GROWING IN OREGON\r\n\r\nA COMING INDUSTRY OF GREAT NATIONAL IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish walnuts for dessert, walnut confectionery, walnut cake, walnuts\r\nin candy bags at Christmas time--thus far has the average person been\r\nintroduced to this, one of the greatest foods of the earth. But if the\r\nfood specialists are heard, if the increasing consumption of nuts as\r\nrecorded by the Government Bureau of Imports is consulted--in short, if\r\none opens his eyes to the tremendous place the walnut is beginning to\r\ntake among food products the world over, he will realize that the\r\nwalnut's rank as a table luxury is giving way to that of a necessity; he\r\nwill acknowledge that the time is rapidly approaching when nuts will be\r\nregarded as we now regard beefsteak or wheat products. The demand is\r\nalready so great that purveyors are beginning to ask, where are the\r\nwalnuts of the future to come from?\r\n\r\nIn 1902. according to the Department of Commerce and Labor, we imported\r\nfrom Europe 11,927,432 pounds of English walnuts; each year since then\r\nthese figures have increased, until in 1906 they reached 24,917,023\r\npounds, valued at $2,193,653. In 1907 we imported 32,590,000 pounds of\r\nwalnuts and 12,000,000 more were produced in the United States. In\r\nOregon alone there are consumed $400,000 worth of nuts annually.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the limited area suitable to walnut culture in\r\nAmerica--California and Oregon practically being the only territory of\r\ncommercial importance--and the fact that the Old World is no longer\r\nplanting additional groves to any appreciable extent, there being no\r\nmore lands available, we begin to realize the important place Oregon is\r\ndestined to take in the future of the walnut industry: for in Oregon,\r\nthroughout a strip of the richest land known to man--the great\r\nWillamette basin with its tributary valleys and hills, an area of 60 by\r\n150 miles--walnuts thrive and yield abundantly, and at a younger age\r\nthan in any other locality, not excepting their original home, Persia.\r\nIn addition, Oregon walnuts are larger, finer flavored, and more uniform\r\nin size than those grown elsewhere; they are also free from oiliness and\r\nhave a full meat that fills the shell well. These advantages are\r\nrecognized in the most indisputable manner, dealers paying from two to\r\nthree cents a pound more for Oregon walnuts than for those from other\r\ngroves. Thus the very last and highest test--what will they bring in the\r\nmarket?--has placed the Oregon walnut at the top.\r\n\r\nHowever, in all of Oregon, throughout the vast domain that seems to have\r\nbeen providentially created to furnish the world with its choicest nut\r\nfruit, there are, perhaps, not more than 200 acres in bearing at the\r\npresent time. The test has been accomplished by individual trees found\r\nhere and there all the way from Washington and Multnomah counties on the\r\nnorth, to Josephine and Jackson counties, bordering California. In a\r\nnumber of counties but two or three handsome old monarchs that have\r\nyielded heavy crops year after year, without a failure for the past\r\ntwenty to forty years, bear witness to the soil's suitability; in other\r\ncounties, notably Yamhill, sturdy yielding groves attest the soil's\r\nfitness. In none of the counties of the walnut belt has but the smallest\r\nfraction of available walnut lands been appropriated for this great\r\nindustry. People are just beginning to realize Oregon's value as a\r\nwalnut center and her destiny as the source of supply for the choicest\r\nmarkets of the future.\r\n\r\nWere it practical to plant every unoccupied suitable acre in Oregon this\r\nyear to walnuts, in eight or ten years the crop would establish Oregon\r\nforever as the sovereign walnut center of the world; and the crop,\r\ndoubling each year thereafter for five years, as is its nature, and\r\nthen maintaining a steady increase up to the twentieth year, would\r\nbecome a power in the world's markets, equal if not superior to that of\r\nNorth American wheat at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _More Nuts than Leaves. Tree of D. H. Turner._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Garden Stuff, Melons Pumpkins, Prunes and Children\r\ngrowing among the Walnuts. The Walnuts will in a Few Years put out all\r\nbut the Children_]\r\n\r\nThe United States Year Book for 1908 estimates the food value of the\r\nwalnut at nearly double that of wheat, and three times that of\r\nbeefsteak.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Dosch, the Oregon pioneer of walnut growing, says: \"As a\r\nbusiness proposition I know of no better in agricultural or\r\nhorticultural pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nProf. C. I. Lewis, of the Oregon Experiment Station, writes: \"In\r\nestablishing walnut groves we are laying the foundation for prosperity\r\nfor a great many generations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. H. M. Williamson, secretary of the Oregon Board of Horticulture,\r\nwrites: \"The man who plants a walnut grove in the right place and gives\r\nit proper care is making provision not only for his own future welfare,\r\nbut for that of his children and his children's children.\"\r\n\r\nFelix Gillett, the veteran horticulturist of Nevada City, California,\r\nwrote shortly before his death: \"Oregon is singularly adapted to raising\r\nwalnuts.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Prince, owner of the largest bearing walnut grove in Oregon,\r\nexpresses the most enthusiastic satisfaction with the income from his\r\ninvestment, and is planting additional groves on his 800-acre farm in\r\nYamhill county, in many cases uprooting fruit trees to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY IN BRIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"English\" walnut originated in Persia, where it throve for\r\nmany centuries before it was carried to Europe--to England, Germany,\r\nFrance, Spain and Italy--different varieties adapting themselves to each\r\ncountry. The name \"walnut\" is of German origin, meaning \"foreign nut.\"\r\nThe Greeks called it \"the Royal nut,\" and the Romans, \"Jupiter's Acorn,\"\r\nand \"Jove's Nut,\" the gods having been supposed to subsist on it.\r\n\r\nThe great age and size to which the walnut tree will attain has been\r\ndemonstrated in these European countries: one tree in Norfolk, England,\r\n100 years old, 90 feet high, and with a spread of 120 feet, yields\r\n54,000 nuts a season; another tree, 300 years old, 55 feet high, and\r\nhaving a spread of 125 feet, yields 1,500 pounds each season. In Crimea\r\nthere is a notable walnut tree 1,000 years old that yields in the\r\nneighborhood of 100,000 nuts annually. It is the property of five Tartar\r\nfamilies, who subsist largely on its fruit.\r\n\r\nIn European countries walnuts come into bearing from the sixteenth to\r\nthe twenty-fourth year; in Oregon, from the eighth to the tenth year;\r\ngrafted trees, sixth year.\r\n\r\nThe first walnut trees were introduced into America a century ago by\r\nSpanish friars, who planted them in Southern California. It was not\r\nuntil comparatively recent years that the hardier varieties from France,\r\nadapted to commercial use, were planted in California and later in\r\nOregon. They were also tried in other localities, but without success.\r\n\r\nSince the prolific productiveness of the English walnut on the Pacific\r\nCoast has been assured, many commercial groves have been set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST TREES OF OREGON\r\n\r\nThe first walnut trees were planted in Oregon in limited number for\r\npurely home use, \"just to see if they would grow,\" and they did. Thus\r\nthe state can boast of single trees close to sixty years of age, each\r\nwith admirable records of unfailing crops, demonstrating what a fortune\r\nwould now be in the grasp of their owners had they planted commercially.\r\n\r\nIn Portland, Oregon, on what is known as the old Dekum place, 13th and\r\nMorrison streets, there are two walnut trees, planted in 1869, that have\r\nyielded a heavy crop every fall since their eighth year, not a single\r\nfailure having been experienced. The ground has never been cultivated.\r\nThe nuts planted were taken at random from a barrel in a grocery store.\r\nDuring the \"silver thaw\" of 1907, the most severe cold spell in the\r\nhistory of Oregon, one of the trees was wrenched in two, but the\r\ndismembered limb, hanging by a shred, bore a full crop of walnuts the\r\nfollowing season.\r\n\r\nN. A. King, at 175 Twenty-first street, has some fine, old trees that\r\nhave not missed bearing a good crop since their eighth year.\r\n\r\nHenry Hewitt, living at Mt. Zion, Portland, an elevation of 1,000 feet,\r\nhas many handsome trees, one, a grafted tree fifteen years old, that has\r\nborne since its fifth year. Another tree of his buds out the fourth of\r\nJuly and yields a full crop as early as any of the other varieties.\r\n\r\nIn Salem, there is what is known as the famous old Shannon tree, fully\r\nthirty years old, with a record of a heavy crop every season.\r\n\r\nMayor Britt, of Jacksonville, has a magnificent tree that has not failed\r\nin twenty years.\r\n\r\nDr. Finck, of Dallas, has a large tree seventeen years old that bore 70\r\npounds of nuts in its thirteenth year, and has increased ever since.\r\n\r\nC. H. Samson, of Grants Pass, has a grove of 250 trees, now ten years\r\nold, that bore at seven years.\r\n\r\nMr. Tiffany, of Salem, has a fifteen-year-old tree that at thirteen\r\nyears bore 115 pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. E. Terpening, of Eugene, has four acres of walnuts grafted on the\r\nAmerican black, which in 1905 produced 700 pounds, in 1906 produced 1200\r\npounds, in 1907 produced 2000 pounds, and in 1908 produced 3000 pounds.\r\nHe tried seedlings first, but they were not satisfactory. The Epps and\r\nReece orchard near Eugene produces about 100 pounds per tree, at 12\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nMr. Muecke, of Aurora, planted a dozen walnuts from his father's estate\r\nin Germany; they made a splendid growth, and at six years bore from 500\r\nto 800 nuts to a tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Stober, of Carson Heights, planted nuts from Germany with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nMrs. Herman Ankeny, of New Era, has seven young trees that in 1907\r\nnetted her $15 a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here is a Santa Barbara soft-shell on the lawn of Mr. E.\r\nC. Apperson, in McMinnville, which at the age of eight years bore 32\r\npounds of walnuts. It stood the frosts and winter of 1908-'09 and bears\r\nevery year; it is now 11 years old, 12 inches in diameter and has a\r\nbranch spread of 40 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The \"Cozine\" Walnut Tree_]\r\n\r\nCozine tree on A street, McMinnville. Seedling, 15 years old; bears good\r\ncrop of nuts every year. At 14 years old the crop was 125 pounds. Is 16\r\ninches in diameter and has a spread of 42 feet.\r\n\r\nOne sixteen-year-old tree near Albany netted its owner $30.\r\n\r\nA Franquette walnut near Brownsville yielded eight bushels at ten years.\r\n\r\nThe French varieties planted in and around Vancouver commenced bearing\r\nat seven years, and have never failed. Prominent growers are A. A.\r\nQuarnberg, A. High, Mr. H. J. Biddle, C. G. Shaw.\r\n\r\nIn Yamhill county, Ed. Greer, James Morison, F. W. Myers, D. H. Turner\r\nand Bland Herring all won prizes at the first walnut fair held in the\r\nstate, on nuts from their groves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD OF THE ENGLISH WALNUT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wood of the English walnut is very hard and close grained, and\r\nnearly as hard and tough as hickory. It will no doubt be valuable for\r\nfurniture, finishing lumber and any other use that may require a\r\nfirst-class hard wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG GROVES OF OREGON\r\n\r\nThe Prince walnut grove of Dundee, Yamhill county, thrills the soul of\r\nthe onlooker with its beauty, present fruitfulness, and great promise.\r\nLying on a magnificent hillside, the long rows of evenly set\r\ntrees--healthy, luxurious in foliage, and filled with nuts--present a\r\npicture of ideal horticulture worth going many miles to see. There is\r\nnot a weed to mar the perfect appearance of the well-tilled soil; not a\r\ndead limb, a broken branch, a sign of neglect or decay. In all, 200\r\nacres are now planted to young walnuts, new areas being added each\r\nseason. From the oldest grove, about forty-five acres, the trees from\r\ntwelve to fourteen years old, there was marketed in 1905 between two and\r\nthree tons of walnuts; in 1906 between four and five tons; in 1907 ten\r\ntons were harvested, bringing the highest market price, 18 and 20 cents\r\na pound wholesale, two cents more than California nuts. The crop for\r\n1908 was at least one-third heavier than for 1907. One tree on the\r\nPrince place, a Mayette, that has received extra cultivation, by way of\r\nexperiment, now twelve years old, has a spread of thirty-eight feet, and\r\nyielded in its eleventh year 125 pounds of excellent nuts. Mr. Woods,\r\nthe superintendent of the Prince place, considers walnut growing a\r\ncomparatively simple matter; he advocates planting the nut where the\r\ntree is to grow, choosing nuts with care; and then thorough cultivation.\r\nThe soil is semi-clayey, red, hill land.\r\n\r\nNear Albany, Linn county, 700 acres are planted; the soil is a rich\r\nloam, and seems admirably adapted to walnuts.\r\n\r\nNear Junction City, in Lane county, there are 200 acres of young trees.\r\nEvery condition seems present for the best results.\r\n\r\nEugene has two small groves.\r\n\r\nYamhill county, where the greatest demonstration thus far has been made,\r\nhas close to 3,000 acres in young trees, the planting having been both\r\non hill and valley lands.\r\n\r\nAt Grants Pass, Josephine county, there is a promising grove of 600\r\nyoung trees.\r\n\r\nNear Aurora and Hubbard, Marion county, where the soil is a rich, black\r\nloam, rather low, a number of young groves are making a growth of four\r\nand five feet a season.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Stump, of Monmouth, Polk county, has a very thrifty young grove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Young Willamette Valley Grove_]\r\n\r\nThis is a view of a part of the R. Jacobson orchard one and one-half\r\nmiles west of McMinnville. The land was bought for $60 per acre and when\r\nplanted to walnuts sold for $200. The orchard is now five years old and\r\ncould not be bought for $600 per acre. It is located on a hill 150 feet\r\nabove the level of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe largest single grafted grove in Oregon is situated one mile from\r\nJunction City, the property of A. R. Martin. He has sixty-five acres.\r\n\r\nWashington county is rapidly acquiring popularity as a walnut center,\r\nmany fine orchards being now planted. Mr. Fred Groner, near Hillsboro,\r\nis now planting 100 acres to grafted trees. The Oregon Nursery Company\r\nis establishing large walnut nurseries in Washington county.\r\n\r\nIn Douglas county, vicinity of Drain, little attention has been paid to\r\nwalnut culture, but a sufficient number of trees are doing well to\r\ninsure good results from large plantings.\r\n\r\nIn Jackson county, near Medford, a number of young groves have been\r\nplanted, and individual trees throughout the Rogue River Valley furnish\r\nample evidence of correct soil and climatic conditions in that section.\r\nEven when apple trees have been caught by frost the walnuts have escaped\r\nuninjured, bearing later a full crop.\r\n\r\nIn Tillamook county only sufficient trees have been planted to\r\ndemonstrate favorable soil conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile western Oregon is universally conceded to be the natural walnut\r\ncenter, eastern Oregon also has its localities where walnuts bear\r\nheavily, and will prove a good commercial crop. In Baker county there\r\nare thousands of acres of land adapted to walnuts; young groves are\r\nbeing planted, and a number of trees have produced fine crops.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the years of the future when the trees of each of\r\nthese young groves will lift their symmetrical heads fifty, sixty,\r\nninety feet into the air, laden to full capacity with a plenteous crop,\r\neach October dropping their golden-brown nut harvest that falls with the\r\nclink of dollars to the commercial-minded, but with an accompaniment of\r\nfinest sentiment in the hearts of those otherwise inclined, one turns\r\naway with a desire to repeat the wisdom of these pioneer planters and\r\nstart a grove of his own. With what grander monument could one\r\ncommemorate his little span on earth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL GROVES\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch is heard, in a general way, of necessary climate and soil\r\nconditions for walnut culture, some giving preference to the hillsides,\r\nothers to valley lands; some contending for a deep, rich loam, others\r\nfor sandy soil. But a careful examination of the soils of Oregon and the\r\ntrees now bearing thereon produces convincing evidence that almost any\r\ndeep, rich, well-drained, western Oregon soil--and some in eastern\r\nOregon--not underlaid by hardpan, will insure a good harvest, providing\r\nthe right varieties are planted. The whole question resolves itself into\r\na matter of intelligent choice of trees to suit varying conditions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the famous Prince grove is producing magnificent crops on\r\nsoil decidedly clayey; but the place is thoroughly cultivated and\r\ncareful selection has been made of hardy trees, the Mayette being\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nAnother young grove is proving that walnuts do well on clayey hill land\r\nof buckshot nature, where the drainage is good and there is no rock or\r\nhardpan.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the hill land, young groves are making admirable growth\r\non the rich loam about Aurora and McMinnville.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Hewitt, of Portland, has fine, young seedlings on a hillside,\r\nelevation 1,000 feet, that made four feet of growth in one season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View of a Yamhill Orchard_]\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of all these groves, there are hardy, bearing trees\r\nthat amply foreshadow the future of the larger plantings. Colonel Henry\r\nDosch, the pioneer walnut grower of Oregon, who has experimented rather\r\nthoroughly, even goes so far as to claim that rocky soil is not\r\nobjectionable, providing there is no hardpan.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in all other horticultural pursuits, naturally the richer\r\nsoils are best; but the industrious horticulturist, by cultivation,\r\nfertilization, and proper care, can produce a fairly good grove on\r\nunfavorable lands. However, so much of Oregon is favorable by nature\r\nthat growers will hardly undertake to enrich the few less desirable\r\nareas for a good many years to come. Land that on the Atlantic slope\r\nwould be seized readily enough, in Oregon is passed by, as there is\r\nstill so much untouched that nature has made ideal. Years hence growers\r\naccustomed to the less fertile conditions of the far east will\r\nundoubtedly turn their attention to even the few poorer areas in Oregon,\r\nand make of them glowing garden spots.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple matter to determine the presence of hardpan; you have but\r\nto make a series of tests--four or five to the acre--with a plumber's\r\nauger; and this care should be taken in every area where soil conditions\r\nhave not been fully determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING\r\n\r\n\r\nGather the walnuts during the fall or winter, fall is better, and put\r\nthem in boxes about the size of ordinary apple boxes, putting in first a\r\nlayer of sand (the sandy loam along the valley streams is excellent)\r\nabout four inches deep, then a layer of walnuts about the same depth,\r\nthen cover these over with three or four inches more of sand. Place\r\nthese boxes out in the weather on the ground where the water will not\r\nrise in them. The reason for putting the walnuts in boxes instead of\r\nbeds, as advised by some planters, is that the boxes may be taken to the\r\nfield or nursery and the nuts lifted carefully from the sand and placed\r\nwhere they are to grow. It sometimes happens in a wet and backward\r\nspring that the walnuts will sprout before the ground is ready for\r\nplanting, in which case they must be handled with the tenderest care and\r\nnot exposed to the atmosphere any longer than can be helped.\r\n\r\nOne grower had a bed of hybrid black walnuts. The season was late and\r\nwhen the ground was ready for planting many had started to grow. He\r\nengaged some boys to grabble out the nuts from the sand beds, urging\r\ncare, but many of the best were broken and injured. Some of them had\r\nsent down a taproot nearly or quite three inches in length. These early\r\nones, under proper conditions, are the most vigorous and surest growers,\r\nbut in the treatment they received many were injured and killed.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are slow to germinate, sometimes laying in the ground two\r\nyears before sprouting. But if kept properly they will start by June or\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nFor the nursery the ground should be plowed deep and thoroughly\r\npulverized. Plant the nuts 6 to 12 inches apart in rows about 3 feet\r\napart. Put a handful of the sand from the boxes around each walnut. Our\r\nsoil will appreciate the sand or silt from the drifts along the valley\r\nstreams, as it has proven to be one of the best fertilizers known. If\r\nanyone doubts this let him try a quantity of it on his kitchen garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A California Black Walnut near McMinnville_]\r\n\r\nOn the Ford place, near the North Yamhill bridge, is one of the finest\r\ntrees in the county, 33 inches diameter, height 75 feet, spread of\r\nbranches 60 feet. Bears an abundance of nuts every year. It is 34 years\r\nold. The seeds are much used to raise grafting stock.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the black walnut seed produced in the Willamette valley\r\nwill partake more or less of a mixed or hybrid nature, whether from a\r\nCalifornia black, Japanese black, or American black. The black walnuts\r\nare very susceptible to cross pollinization and the English walnut also,\r\nfor be it known that\r\n\r\n  With wandering bees and the sweet May breeze,\r\n  That virile tide goes far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe nut should be planted two or three inches deep. A good authority\r\nsays to place the nut on its side as it would lay after falling from the\r\ntree. If the nut is sprouted make a hole in the well pulverized soil and\r\nput the root carefully down into it.\r\n\r\nThe best way for planting in the orchard is to bore a hole with a post\r\nor well auger 4 or 5 feet deep where the tree is to grow, put in a stick\r\nof dynamite and break up the ground thoroughly.\r\n\r\nOr, better still, bore down to permanent moisture and fill the lower\r\nhole with good soil or other root food, then dynamite 4 or 5 feet of the\r\nupper section of the hole. Nothing will produce a vigorous and thrifty\r\ntree like a deep and vigorous root system, and no tree responds to\r\ncultivation and care as does the walnut, white or black. After bursting\r\nup the soil, excavate and put in a half bushel of barn or other mould,\r\nwell rotted. This will force the tree in the earlier years of its life\r\nand can be no hindrance to it later. Cover the manure with a foot or two\r\nof soil and plant. Both before and after planting the ground should be\r\nploughed and harrowed until it is as mellow as an ash heap. Plant three\r\nor four nuts in a hill 6 to 8 inches apart and at the end of the first\r\nseason's growth pull out all but the most vigorous one. For\r\ntransplanting from the nursery the same methods should be followed in\r\nthe preparation of the hole and the soil as in planting the seed nuts.\r\nIf one wants to lay the foundation for a fine orchard and a fine fortune\r\nas a consequence, these preliminary steps must not be neglected. Because\r\nin time you expect this tree to pay you a rental of $8 to $12 a month.\r\nIf you are building a cottage that would bring in that sum, you would\r\nput in much more work and money besides. The wise grower would rather\r\nhave a man plant six trees for him in one day than sixty. The walnut is\r\nusually a very vigorous tree and will fight its way among adverse\r\nconditions and surroundings, but its golden showers are much more\r\nabundant if it is protected from the scars of battle, especially in its\r\nyouth. It almost seems to respond to the love and affection given to it\r\nby a kind master. Animals respond to kindness, and why not the domestic\r\ntrees? It will pay you a big salary after a while when your other bank\r\naccounts and your health and strength fail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _American Black Walnuts_]\r\n\r\nA magnificent row of nine American black walnuts, 35 or 40 years old.\r\nThe tree in the foreground is 20 inches in diameter of trunk. The\r\ntallest of the trees is nearly 60 feet and they have a spread of more\r\nthan 70 feet. They are at the residence of Dave Johnson on the Portland\r\nroad about 8 miles from McMinnville. Seed from such trees as these would\r\nproduce the very best trees for grafting upon.\r\n\r\nThere are very few California blacks of pure strain in the country. The\r\nhybrids or crosses with the American or eastern black walnut, are better\r\ntrees for grafting stock than the pure Californias. They are more hardy\r\nand better adapted to our climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nHorticulturists of equal fame and experience take different views on the\r\nsubject of planting, some contending that the nut should be planted\r\nwhere the tree is to grow; others that seedlings are the thing, and\r\nstill others that trees should be grafted. And as all three plans have\r\nproduced good results in Oregon, the individual planter may take his\r\nchoice, according to the circumstances in which he is situated. The\r\ntruth is that the walnut is one of the hardiest of trees, and with good\r\nattention will not disappoint if the right kinds are properly started.\r\n\r\nIn planting walnuts to raise seedling trees the best available seed nuts\r\nshould be used. Select the best and most prolific variety and the one\r\nmost suited to the climate.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that the nuts from a grafted tree will produce the best\r\nseedling trees. This may be true as a rule, as the nut from such a tree\r\nwill have some of the characteristics of the stock upon which the parent\r\ntree was grafted. It may inherit some of the resistant qualities of the\r\nblack walnut or the rapid growth of the California hybrids. It may have\r\nearly ripening qualities. It is well to consider all these points as\r\nwell as the quality of the nut when selecting seed.\r\n\r\nBy careful selection and cross pollination many and better varieties\r\nwill be produced. No doubt a nut superior to any that has yet appeared\r\nin any country will yet be originated in the Willamette Valley, as in\r\nthe case of the Bing and Lambert cherry and some other fruits.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the walnut in this section is one of the most fertile\r\nfields of investigation to be found anywhere and one that promises big\r\nreward to the successful culturist. And the walnut grower need not wait\r\nlong to find whether he has a prize or not, for just as soon as the\r\nlittle sprout comes from the ground and has hardened sufficient to\r\nhandle, a skillful grafter can place it in a bearing tree and the second\r\nor third year know the result of his experiment by the production of\r\nfruit, and this not more than three or four years from the planting of\r\nthe seed.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of planting walnuts, providing you secure first generation\r\nnuts of the right variety for your soil and atmospheric conditions, is\r\nin simplicity and inexpensiveness. You merely purchase your nuts of a\r\nreliable concern, or from an isolated grove of one variety (many send\r\ndirect to France, where pure strains can be more readily gotten), and in\r\nFebruary plant them on their sides in a shallow box of moist sand; keep\r\nin a cool place. In April, or as soon as they sprout, dig a hole 2-1/2\r\nor 3 feet deep, put in surface loam, and plant three or four nuts to a\r\nhole about 2 or 3 inches deep. They will come up by June and make a\r\ngrowth of a foot or so the first season.\r\n\r\nIt is contended by many that nothing is gained by planting seedlings in\r\nthe nursery, as the set-back from transplanting prevents their bearing\r\nany earlier than trees of the same age grown from nuts.\r\n\r\nGrafted trees, on the other hand, are difficult to obtain in large\r\nnumbers, are expensive, but produce nuts of uniform size and beauty, and\r\nthe pollination is said to be more sure.\r\n\r\nThe industry is still too young in Oregon for the final word to have\r\nbeen spoken on this point. The future will undoubtedly add much valuable\r\ninformation as larger experience supplants theory with facts.\r\n\r\nThe vital point is to plant good nuts or reliable seedlings from a pure\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nIn choosing varieties be governed by your location. If frosts are to be\r\nfeared get late-blooming varieties, the leading ones established in\r\nOregon being the Mayette and the Franquette. Other varieties will\r\nundoubtedly be introduced in the next few years that will withstand\r\nfrost in regions where walnut planting now seems impractical. Mr. Henry\r\nHewitt's one tree that blooms the fourth of July, at an elevation of\r\n1,000 feet, is evidence of the possibilities in this direction. Air\r\ndrainage is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe tested varieties in Oregon to date, and the results, are as follows:\r\n\r\nMayettes (the famous \"Grenoble\" of commerce) and Franquettes are first\r\nchoice for hardiness and for reliable commercial crops, the nuts being\r\nof good size, fine flavor and in every way meeting the highest market\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nPraeparturiens bear earlier than other varieties, are very productive\r\nand as fine flavored as a hickory nut, but the nuts are small for best\r\ncommercial prices.\r\n\r\nThe Chaberte is a hardy tree, good for the uplands, and prolific; a\r\ndelicious nut, small but excellent for confectioners use.\r\n\r\nThe Ford Mammoth, Glady and Bijou are too large to find favor for\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Fine Japanese Hybrid in Lafayette_]\r\n\r\nThe Parisienne, Meylan and Lanfray are newer varieties that give much\r\npromise, but have not been thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\nH. M. Williamson, Secretary Oregon State Board of Horticulture, in an\r\narticle says:\r\n\r\n\"The extremely unfavorable weather of the past winter (1908-9) has been\r\none of the best things which could have happened to many heedless\r\npersons who planted walnut trees without first taking pains to learn\r\nanything about the business. The destruction of many young trees of the\r\nSanta Barbara type was a blessing to those who planted them, and the\r\nplanters deserve no sympathy, for the warnings not to plant trees of\r\nthat type have been ample for many years past.\r\n\r\n\"The fine condition of suitably located groves of walnut trees of\r\nFranquette, Mayette and other French varieties, after a winter which\r\nproved the most trying to fruit trees of all kinds which we have known\r\nduring a long period of years, has given firm confidence to those who\r\nare leading in the development of the walnut industry in Oregon.\r\n\r\n\"The varieties which are best adapted to culture in this state are those\r\nwhich produce the finest nuts known to the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walnut Groves, Dundee, Oregon_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLING WALNUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading commercial orchard in the state is that of Mr. Thomas\r\nPrince, of Yamhill county, and is composed almost entirely of seedling\r\ntrees. The history of this orchard is best told by Mr. Prince in the\r\nfollowing very conservative letter:\r\n\r\n\"About 17 years ago the Ladd Stock Farm of Yamhill, Oregon, by the\r\nadvice of Mr. H. E. Dosch, then Secretary of the Oregon Horticultural\r\nSociety, purchased from the late Felix Gillett, Nevada City, Cal., and\r\nplanted quite a number of young walnut trees which are now in bearing.\r\nThe first few years their cattle received first attention and the young\r\ntrees were not cultivated as much as they should have been to make good\r\ngrowth. They therefore do not grow the quantity of walnuts they would\r\nhave produced with better cultivation. Two or three years after this Mr.\r\nZ. T. Davis, of Dundee, Oregon, also by advice of Mr. Dosch, purchased\r\nof Mr. Gillett some 500 one-year-old seedlings. One year later the\r\nwriter, who had some land adjoining Mr. Davis, also became interested\r\nand set out about 1,500 additional trees, and about two years later\r\npurchased the place belonging to Mr. Davis, and became owner of the\r\nyoung trees at Dundee, with the exception of a few purchased by several\r\nneighbors. All are now in bearing.\r\n\r\n\"Those who do not know the facts are inclined to give the writer more\r\ncredit than he is entitled to. Mr. Dosch, the Ladds, Mr. Davis and Mr.\r\nGillett were first to interest themselves and should receive the credit\r\nto which they are entitled.\r\n\r\n\"We have now in Oregon and Washington quite a few trees in bearing, and\r\nwe believe they can be grown here with profit. There is much to learn.\r\nWe find the young trees should be carefully set out and receive good\r\ncultivation for the first few years. That the selection of the trees and\r\nthe location in which to grow them are very important. The number of\r\ntrees to the acre, and whether to grow seedling or grafted trees; and if\r\ngrafted whether root grafting or top grafting is best must be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\"I think growing of walnuts has the advantage of many other products.\r\nThe crop is easily grown, harvested and marketed; the labor greatly\r\neconomized and the net profits a larger per cent of the gross receipts;\r\nwhile sometimes with other crops the results are just the reverse--the\r\nnet profits but a small per cent of the gross receipts.\r\n\r\n\"The question is often asked how much is land worth that is suitable;\r\nhow long before trees will bear, and how much will they produce, etc.\r\nThe price of land depends largely on location; generally it is worth\r\nfrom $50 to $150 per acre. Seedling trees come into bearing from 7 to 9\r\nyears of age, quantity from 10 to 50 pounds per tree; number of trees\r\nper acre, 20 to 40.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sixty Year Old Walnut Trees on Derr Place_]\r\n\r\nThese trees are about 60 years old and were planted by I. M. Johns, who\r\ntook the donation claim two miles southeast of McMinnville, about 1844,\r\nnow the Derr farm. The trunk of the largest one on the right is 10 feet\r\nin circumference, and is probably the largest English walnut tree in\r\nOregon. They have some nuts every year, but are shy bearers, due no\r\ndoubt to lack of proper pollination. The nut is not large, but is full\r\nof good meat and resembles the Parry. The trees are about two hundred\r\nyards from the Yamhill river, are hale and hearty and seem good for a\r\nfew centuries. In fact, all of the seedlings examined in this county are\r\nhealthy and vigorous.\r\n\r\nThere are half a dozen or more walnut trees growing in the woods and\r\nabout the garden of Mr. J. T. Jones, seven miles west of McMinnville,\r\nwhich are a valuable study to the walnut grower. They are seedlings from\r\nthe Casey tree, and they all bear full crops every year. The largest is\r\n21 inches in diameter. One of them has a much larger and finer nut than\r\nthat grown on the Casey tree. Hardpan is reached about 18 inches below\r\nthe surface, which would indicate that no tap root were needed were it\r\nnot for the fact that a tiny brook runs down through the garden not far\r\nfrom the trees.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the testimony of Col. Henry E. Dosch, taken from \"Better\r\nFruit\" of August, 1908:\r\n\r\n     \"It is over twenty years since I first experimented with nut\r\n     culture, more especially English, or, more properly speaking,\r\n     French walnut culture, and by persistent effort in keeping this\r\n     matter before the horticulturists am more than gratified to know\r\n     that this important industry is at last receiving the attention it\r\n     deserves; and a few who took my advice in the beginning and planted\r\n     on a commercial basis are now reaping the benefit, as their\r\n     products command the highest price in the market.\r\n\r\n     \"First generation nuts are produced on original trees, or on trees\r\n     grafted from the original trees. Those nuts when planted produce\r\n     second generation trees, and the nuts from these second generation\r\n     trees are a little larger than the original or first generation,\r\n     which is due to the peculiar soil and climatic conditions of the\r\n     Pacific Northwest, so well adapted to nut culture. Trees grown from\r\n     second generation nuts retrograde very rapidly, producing nuts not\r\n     half so large as even the first generation trees, and finally\r\n     running out altogether. Hence it is very essential that we plant\r\n     nuts from the original trees, or trees grown from the original nuts\r\n     or grafted from the original trees.\"\r\n\r\nA tree on John E. Brooks' claim, Casey Place, is one of the earliest and\r\nmost important trees in the country. It has borne a good crop every year\r\nfor thirty-five years, and in all that time has led a strenuous life. It\r\nwas planted first in Portland from a nut supposed to have been brought\r\nfrom the Rhine in Germany by a German sea captain. It was broken down by\r\nstock when Amasa Brooks saw it, and with the consent of the owner\r\ntransplanted it to its present site, on the side of a red hill a few\r\nrods above the house and about 100 feet above the level of the valley.\r\nThere it was much abused by stock, and exposed to other accidents. When\r\nit began to bear, the squirrels would gather the nuts as soon as they\r\nwere big enough to attract them. When the tree was visited in August,\r\n1909, for the purpose of getting a photograph it was found that a\r\nsquirrel had burrowed under the roots, making an opening large enough to\r\nadmit a good-sized foxhound, and a quantity of nuts hulls were piled\r\nabout it and scattered beneath the tree. It is 23 inches in diameter and\r\nhas a branch spread of nearly 60 feet. Trees of the fourth generation\r\nfrom this tree are in bearing near McMinnville and are producing fairly\r\ngood nuts, some better than the original tree, demonstrating that the\r\nseedling walnut tree can be improved here by seed selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Grafted Walnut_]\r\n\r\nThe above is a two-year-old grafted tree in the orchard of Mr. Prince.\r\nIt was sent to him by Judge Leib, of San Jose, in order to convince him\r\nof the superiority of the grafted tree. You will note that the little\r\nbush has two good-sized nuts, and also that it bore one last year, the\r\nfirst year from the nursery. With this ratio of increase at 20 years of\r\nage it would produce about three and one-quarter tons of walnuts,\r\ncounting 42 nuts to the pound, the weight of first-class Oregon walnuts.\r\nBut this is not probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTED TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony in favor of the grafted tree is not yet very abundant in\r\nOregon, as the grafting business is new; but with the evidence at hand\r\nit will surely have a standing in court.\r\n\r\nProf. Lewis speaks plainly on this subject. He says:\r\n\r\n\"One of the main points of discussion is, Which are preferable--grafted\r\nor seedling trees? Let us consider the seedling tree first. There are\r\nmen who claim that these are superior to grafted trees, especially in\r\nsize, prolificness, etc.; that there is something about our wonderful\r\nOregon climate that causes the so-called second generation trees to bear\r\nlarger and better fruits than the parent plant. And these writers love\r\nto dwell on the subject of generation. There is at times a sort of\r\nmystery, an uncanny vagueness connected with this subject that is\r\nbaffling and bewildering to the layman, and causes him to listen with\r\nmouth agape. It is the same sweet silly story that we have had to learn\r\nby bitter experience with other nuts and fruits, and some of us will\r\nevidently pay dearly for it in the case of the walnut. The term 'first\r\ngeneration' is generally applied to the parent tree--some say the\r\noriginal tree, while others put the clause on the original grafted tree.\r\nNuts taken from such trees and planted produce the second generation\r\ntrees. These may be equal, may be superior, or may be inferior to the\r\noriginal stock. It is this very variation and instability that makes the\r\nseedling to a more or less degree a gambling proposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from a paper on walnut culture by Luther Burbank,\r\nread before the annual meeting of the California Fruit Growers\r\nconvention:\r\n\r\n\"In all cases the best results will be obtained by grafting on our\r\nnative California black walnut or some of its hybrids. No one who grows\r\nEnglish walnuts on their own roots need expect to be able to compete\r\nwith those who grow them on the native black walnut roots, for when\r\ngrown on these roots the trees will uniformly be larger and longer\r\nlived, will hardly be affected by blight and other diseases, and will\r\nbear from two to four times as many nuts, which will be of larger size\r\nand of much better quality. These are facts, not theories, and walnuts\r\ngrowers should take heed.\r\n\r\n\"Although not popular among nurserymen, yet the best way to produce a\r\npaying orchard of walnuts is to plant the nuts from some vigorous black\r\nwalnut tree, three or four in each place where a tree is to stand. At\r\nthe end of the first summer remove all but the strongest among them. Let\r\nthe trees grow as they will, for from three to six years, until they\r\nhave formed their own natural, vigorous system of roots, then graft to\r\nthe best variety extant which thrives in your locality, and if on deep,\r\nwell-drained land you will at once have a grove of walnuts which will\r\npay, at present, or even with very much lower prices, a most princely\r\ninterest on your investment. By grafting in the nursery, or before the\r\nnative tree has had time to produce its own system of roots by its own\r\nrapid-growing leafy top, you have gained little or nothing over\r\nplanting trees on their own roots, for the foliage of any tree governs\r\nthe size, extent and form of the root system. Take heed, as these are\r\nfacts, not fancies, and are not to be neglected if you would have a\r\nwalnut grove on a safe foundation.\r\n\r\n\"I hold in my hands a record, and also a photograph, of one of the Santa\r\nRosa walnut trees, grafted, as I recommended, on the black walnut, 1891;\r\nthis was handed to me by the owner, George C. Payne, of Campbell. The\r\nrecord may be of interest to you: Dimensions (1905)--Spread of top, 66\r\nfeet; circumference one foot above ground, 8 feet 9 inches. No record of\r\nnuts was kept until 1897, which amounted to 250 pounds; 1898, 302\r\npounds; 1899, 229 pounds; 1900, 600 pounds; 1901, 237 pounds; 1902, 478\r\npounds; 1903, 380 pounds; 1904, 481 pounds; 1905, 269 pounds; 1908, 712\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"The walnut has generally been considered a very difficult tree to graft\r\nsuccessfully. Mr. Payne has perfected a mode of grafting which in his\r\nhands is without doubt the most successful known; by it he is uniformly\r\nsuccessful, often making one hundred per cent of the grafts to grow. Who\r\ncan do better by any method?\r\n\r\n\"When you plant another tree, why not plant a walnut? Then, besides\r\nsentiment, shade and leaves, you may have a perennial supply of nuts,\r\nthe improved kinds of which furnish the most delicious, nutritious and\r\nhealthful food which has ever been known. The old-fashioned hit-or-miss\r\nnuts, which we used to purchase at the grocery store, were generally of\r\na rich, irregular mixture in form, size and color, with meats of varying\r\ndegrees of unsoundness, bitter, musty, rancid, or with no meat at all.\r\nFrom these early memories, and the usual accompanying after-effects,\r\nnuts have not been a very popular food for regular use until lately,\r\nwhen good ones at a moderate price can generally, but not always, be\r\npurchased at all first-class stores.\r\n\r\n\"The consumption of nuts is probably increasing among all civilized\r\nnations today faster than that of any other food, and we should keep up\r\nwith this increasing demand and make the increase still more rapid by\r\nproducing nuts of uniformly good quality. This can be done without extra\r\neffort, and with an increase in the health and rapid and permanent\r\nincrease in the wealth of ourselves and neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Row of Eleven Year Old Top Grafted Black Walnut\r\nHybrids_]\r\n\r\nAn American black walnut growing on a lot on the east side of Grant\r\nstreet, residence of J. C. Cooper, McMinnville, grafted by Mr. Payne May\r\n14, 1908, grew 7-1/2 feet in 95 days and was still growing when the\r\nterminal buds were nipped by the early September frost of that year. The\r\nsprouts were pruned back to 12 inches. The tree made a vigorous growth\r\nin 1909, making a spread of 13 feet. Some think the American black a\r\nbetter tree for grafting stock that the California black. One of the\r\nnoblest and grandest trees in any American forest is the American black\r\nwalnut, and while a little slow at the beginning of its career it is\r\nonly a question of time when it will overtake all others. It knows no\r\ndisease or pests, and he who plants it lays a foundation for 20 to 50\r\ngenerations to come as well as for himself and those of his own\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nA four-year-old hybrid, 4 inches in diameter, grafted in by Mr. Payne,\r\ngrew a sprout as shown, 7 feet 9 inches high in four months from the\r\nsetting of the graft. It is growing on the east side of D street near\r\nthe Presbyterian church in front of the residence of Mrs. Sarah\r\nUpdegraf, McMinnville, Oregon. Three trees there all show the same\r\nvigor, with little or no cultivation.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Hartog, formerly of Eugene, wrote of the experience of Mr. E.\r\nTerpening, one of the most successful walnut growers near that city.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Terpening is a devotee of the grafted tree. And why? A burnt child\r\nspurns the fire, says the proverb. Mr. Terpening set out second\r\ngeneration Mayettes and Franquettes, expecting that these seedlings\r\nwould produce true, but when they commenced to bear, behold his\r\namazement at finding that he had a variety of almost every kind. This\r\nwas enough to convince him that in the future he would use grafted\r\ntrees, and know what he was doing and what kind of nut he was raising.\r\n\r\n\"Counting out trees of other kinds, he has four acres in walnuts, and\r\nthese produced--\r\n\r\n  In 1905       700 pounds\r\n  In 1906      1200 pounds\r\n  In 1907      2000 pounds\r\n  In 1908      3000 pounds\r\n\r\n\"This spring he set out 450 more trees and wisely he put them 50 feet\r\napart and will grow peaches in between for a few years. While it is\r\ngenerally said that walnuts come into bearing after 8 years, Mr.\r\nTerpening states that the grafted tree will bear commercially in 6\r\nyears, which tallies exactly with my experience.\r\n\r\n\"The Terpening walnut trees are grafted on American black and his\r\nfavorite variety is the Mayette and lately the so-called Improved\r\nMayette.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT GRAFTING\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut grafting is in a class by itself, and walnut budding is not a\r\nsuccess as practiced at the present time, although the ordinary method\r\nis shown in the cut. The top grafting method shown is easy and sure if\r\nyou have \"the know-how and skill.\" One of the important things to\r\nremember in tree surgery as well as other kinds, is to work quickly and\r\ndeftly. Don't let the wounds of the scion or stub remain exposed longer\r\nthan necessary. Make the cuts smooth with a very sharp knife, kept sharp\r\nby frequent \"stropping.'\" Expert walnut grafters are few, but the\r\nordinary skillful orchardist or amateur can do fairly successful work by\r\na study of the drawings in \"Details of Walnut Grafting\" on next page,\r\nand using common sense methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Walnut Grafting]\r\n\r\nCut off the branch or stock to be grafted with a sharp priming saw at a\r\npoint where the stump will be from one to two and a half inches in\r\ndiameter. Split through the center of the stub with a sharp knife as\r\nshown in figure 1, using a mallet. Depress the point of the splitting\r\nknife and strike with the mallet, cutting the bark and sap down the side\r\nof the stub instead of tearing it, then depress the handle and cut down\r\nthe other side in the same way. Open the split slightly with a hardwood\r\nwedge, as in figure 2. Slightly bevel the split, cutting upward, with a\r\nsharp knife as in figure 3. Insert the carefully fitted scion as at\r\nfigure 4, being careful to have the cambium layer, the inner layer of\r\nthe bark, of both stub and scion come together.\r\n\r\nWhen the scion is carefully fitted remove the wedge and fill the split\r\nwith paper as shown at figure 5. Then cover all wounds over with wax\r\nbrushed on warm as at figure 6. The melted wax should be about the\r\nconsistency of thick honey. Tie a paper sack over all as at figure 7.\r\nThis should remain until scions begin to grow. It keeps them warm and\r\nprevents drying out by hot winds. In from ten days to three weeks the\r\nscions will have started sufficient to gradually remove the cover as at\r\nfigure 8. In eight or ten days from the time grafts are set a small\r\nopening should be cut or torn in the north side of the paper sack so\r\nthat the sprouting buds may have air and their growth noted.\r\n\r\nWhen the stock is too large to split through the center it should be\r\nsplit to one side of center as shown in figure 9. The method of shaping\r\nthe scions is shown in figures 10, 11 and 12. Good scions and poor are\r\nshown in 13 and 14. Scions with buds not too far apart are best. Prong\r\ngrafting is shown in figures 15 to 18, and flute budding in 19 and 20.\r\n\r\nIn grafting the stock should not close on the scion with sufficient\r\nforce to bruise or injure it, but just tight enough to hold.\r\n\r\nScions should be of last year's wood and pruned or cut from the trees in\r\nlate winter, when the tree is dormant, and cut into about 12-inch\r\nlengths, long enough to make three or four grafts. Select upright wood.\r\nDrooping branches make a sprawling and sometimes a barren tree.\r\n\r\nThe dormant scions should be packed away in a cool, dark cellar in damp\r\nsand or moss, or put in cold storage and kept dormant until ready for\r\nuse. Do not allow the buds to swell. It will be well to look at them\r\noccasionally to see that they do not get too dry nor be so damp as to\r\nmold.\r\n\r\nIn the spring when the sap is well up and the trees to be grafted have\r\nsprouted and are growing during April and May the grafting should be\r\ndone. Work may be continued even after the catkins are out and the\r\nleaves half grown.\r\n\r\nThe methods described are those practiced by Mr. George C. Payne,\r\nprobably the most successful walnut grafter in the business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tools Used in Walnut Grafting_\r\n\r\nPlate One. Furnished by Oregon Agricultural College]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING WAX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following formula is the grafting wax used by Mr. Payne:\r\n\r\n  Rosin, 5 pounds.\r\n  Beeswax, 1 pound.\r\n  Finely pulverized charcoal. 1-2 pound.\r\n  Raw linseed oil, 1 gill\r\n\r\nBe sure that the charcoal is finely pulverized. First melt the beeswax\r\nand rosin, being careful not to have the fire too hot. Add the charcoal,\r\nstirring constantly, and then add the oil. Mould into bricks by pouring\r\ninto greased pans. When desiring to use break off a few lumps and melt\r\nin such a contrivance as is shown in the plate of grafting tools. The\r\nwax must be quite liquid if applied successfully.\r\n\r\nNursery grafting, or root grafting, is not a success as practiced at\r\npresent. The best grafters do not succeed with more than 10 to 15 per\r\ncent. This makes the grafted tree cost from $1.50 to $2.00 per tree, and\r\nmakes that kind of walnut planting expensive. However, Col. Dosch, in\r\nhis article, quotes Professor Leckenby, the noted agrostologist, as\r\nsaying that if directions are religiously followed ninety per cent of\r\nthe grafts will grow. The directions are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"For walnut grafts on scions use one gallon of water with four\r\nteaspoonfuls of sulphate of quinine. Cut scions submerged in the\r\nsolution, and wash the cut on tree at once, to prevent it from turning\r\nblack, acting as an antiseptic; then insert, the scion as on other fruit\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\nThis, from such authority, is worthy of a trial. A great amount of\r\nexperimenting has been done in walnut grafting and a way to success will\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST STOCK ON WHICH TO GRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Burbank, Judge Leib, and George C. Payne, all of California, think\r\nthe California black or some of its hybrids make the best stock in\r\nCalifornia. Mr. Groner prefers the hybrid for Oregon.\r\n\r\nMr. A. McGill, of Oregon, thinks that neither the California black nor\r\nits hybrid are suited to this climate. Few have had more experience,\r\ncostly experience at that, than Mr. McGill. He thinks the American black\r\nbetter for Oregon.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asked, why not plant seedling walnuts and top work those\r\nthat are not good bearers? Because the grafts will not do so well on the\r\nEnglish stock as on the black; and it is also found that the English\r\nstock does not make as good a foundation as the black.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best growers in Oregon conclude that the seed from a\r\nthrifty American Black, or close hybrid, is best for this state. In\r\nthree or four years after planting cut off the trunk about as high as a\r\nman's waist or shoulder and put in the graft from the best variety\r\navailable. The third year from setting of the graft you will have a crop\r\nof nuts.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne can set 250 to 300 grafts in a day. His wages are $8 a day,\r\nand he furnishes the wood. So you see that your trees would cost very\r\nlittle. Good black walnut seed can be had very cheap, probably at a cost\r\nof 50 cents to $1 per bushel, the Oregon product preferred.\r\n\r\nSome of the California hybrids make rapid growth, but too rapid growth\r\nof wood may not be desirable. It may mean early maturity and early\r\ndecay, and too few walnut bearing boughs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD PLAN FOR WALNUT ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\n  (3)---------<1>---------(3)---------<1>---------(3)\r\n   | \\         :         / | \\         :         / |\r\n   |   \\       :       /   |   \\       :       /   |\r\n   |     \\     :     /     |     \\     :     /     |\r\n   |       \\   :   /       |       \\   :   /       |\r\n   |         \\ : /         |         \\ : /         |\r\n  <1>.........(2).........<1>.........(2).........<1>\r\n   |         / : \\         |         / : \\         |\r\n   |       /   :   \\       |       /   :   \\       |\r\n   |     /     :     \\     |     /     :     \\     |\r\n   |   /       :       \\   |   /       :       \\   |\r\n   | /         :         \\ | /         :         \\ |\r\n  (3)---------<1>---------(3)---------<1>---------(3)\r\n   | \\         :         / |\\          :         / |\r\n   |   \\       :       /   |<.\\.......6:0....../..>|\r\n   |     \\     :     /     |    \\      :     /     |\r\n   |       \\   :   /       |      \\    :   /       |\r\n   |         \\ : /         |         \\ : /         |\r\n  <1>.........(2).........<1>.........(2).........<1>\r\n   |        /  : \\         |         / : \\         |\r\n   |      /    :   \\       |       /   :   \\       |\r\n   |    /      :     \\     |     /     :     \\     |\r\n   |  /        :       \\   |   /       :       \\   |\r\n   |/          :         \\ | /         :         \\ |\r\n  (3)---------<1>---------(3)--30 _ft_--<1>--30 _ft_--(3)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Prince, of Yamhill county, has modified his views somewhat in regard\r\nto the grafted and seedling trees. He thinks that possibly the permanent\r\norchard should be of the grafted variety, possibly on the Royal or\r\nCalifornia hybrid of rapid growth. He proposes the above form of an\r\norchard. The principal grafted trees should be placed in square form 60\r\nfeet apart, represented by figures 3. In the center of these squares at\r\nfigures 2 he would either plant the same trees or some other seedling\r\nvariety which will bring the trees about 42 feet apart. Midway between\r\nthe main grafted trees he would plant other trees, or apple trees,\r\nrepresented by figures 1 in the little squares. This would make trees\r\n30 feet apart. At the end of 15 or 20 years, when the trees possibly\r\nbecome crowded, he would remove the No. 1 trees. If this were an apple\r\ntree, it would already have served its best days and no great loss would\r\nbe had by its removal. At the end of 25 or 30 years we would remove No.\r\n2, if the trees became crowded, leaving a permanent orchard of trees 60\r\nfeet apart, 12 trees to the acre. This is an excellent arrangement, and\r\nno doubt about the best that has yet been proposed for walnut culture in\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nIt is best to plant in square form, a tree to the center of each square,\r\nforty to sixty feet apart is the rule. Berries, small fruit, potatoes,\r\nvetch, peas, beans, etc., can be grown between the trees while they are\r\nyoung, leaving six or eight feet free to be cultivated each side of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nMany plant apples, peaches, prunes or cherries between walnut trees,\r\nplanning to cut them out when the latter are of such size as to need all\r\nthe space.\r\n\r\nThese crops between the rows produce an income during the eight years'\r\nwaiting for the walnuts to come into bearing. Each grower must decide\r\nthis point according to his situation, always avoiding grains and\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAP ROOT\r\n\r\n\r\nSome experimenting has been done and much speculation has been indulged\r\nregarding the tap root. One writer disposes of the whole subject in this\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\"The cutting of the tap root in planting seedlings has been a question\r\nfor much discussion, many growers formerly holding that to cut it meant\r\nto kill the tree. This has proved a mistake. It has been practically\r\ndemonstrated that the tree thrives better with the tap root cut if\r\nproperly done with a sharp instrument, making a clean cut. New growth is\r\nthereby induced, the abundance of lateral roots feed the tree more\r\nsatisfactorily and the trees come into bearing from two to three years\r\nearlier than would otherwise be the case.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Well Planted Tree]\r\n\r\nBefore accepting this as final it would be well to make further inquiry.\r\nThe summers of western Oregon are practically rainless and when the\r\nkernel in the formed shell is maturing unless there is irrigation a\r\ndistress call is sent down to the roots for moisture, if the weather is\r\nvery dry. The lateral roots cannot supply this dire need and if the main\r\npump is not working away down deep in the moist earth the kernel will\r\nnot fill well and may perish entirely. For this reason no fibre of the\r\ntap root should be disturbed, but rather encouraged by a well auger\r\nhole, bored before the tree is planted, down to the reservoir of\r\nmoisture that will not fail in the dryest season.\r\n\r\nThe moisture in a dry season as a rule is nearer the surface in the\r\nvalley than in the hills and gives a better filled nut. In a wet season,\r\nwhen the ground everywhere is full of moisture, the hills may produce a\r\nmore abundant crop than the valley, but in the run of years it will\r\nrequire more time to prove which is most valuable for walnut culture.\r\nTrees grow in either place, but he who cuts the tap root in any soil\r\ndoes so at the peril of his crop in dry seasons.\r\n\r\nOf the taproot, Wm. M. Reece, of the firm of Epps, Reece & Tillmont,\r\nEugene, Oregon, writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The peculiar climatic conditions of the Willamette Valley, which\r\n     at a certain season of the year becomes semi-arid, fully justifies\r\n     the statement that trees not having a tap root are annually checked\r\n     in their growth when irrigation is not used; while those that do\r\n     have a tap root, as do walnuts, continue to grow and thrive even in\r\n     the driest weather. The walnut should be planted, however, in soil\r\n     having a subsoil free from any hard substance that will permit the\r\n     tap root to grow downward into the strata of perpetual moisture.\r\n\r\n     \"This has been most thoroughly demonstrated in our walnut orchard\r\n     this, the driest year in the memory of old settlers in the Valley.\r\n\r\n     \"When the growth of our apple, cherry and peach trees ceased\r\n     because of the dry weather, our walnuts kept on growing as if\r\n     supplied by continuous rains. It is true that liberal cultivation\r\n     through the dry season will materially aid the growth of all kinds\r\n     of trees not having a tap root and is indispensable to the growth\r\n     of young walnut trees, trees that have not extended their tap root\r\n     down to perpetual moisture.\r\n\r\n     \"Walnut trees, in the opinion of the writer, cease growing upward\r\n     when they cease growing downward; that is to say, when rock, shale\r\n     or impenetrable hardpan stops the growth of the tap root, the tree\r\n     has practically reached its height.\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore, in planting a walnut grove, borings should be made to\r\n     test the depth of the soil and character of the subsoil.\r\n\r\n     \"Unquestionably the best variety for this climate is the Franquette\r\n     and next the Mayette.\r\n\r\n     \"Grafted trees are to be preferred to seedlings. Grafted trees bear\r\n     much sooner and the fruit is more uniform in size, though a\r\n     seedling that has attained the bearing age will produce as much\r\n     fruit as a grafted tree of the same age; this we have occasion to\r\n     observe from comparisons in our own orchard.\r\n\r\n     \"We have trees 14 years old that bore 100 pounds at the age of 12\r\n     years and the product sold for 25c a pound for planting purposes.\r\n\r\n     \"Those who had the misfortune to have the tender shoots of their\r\n     walnut trees killed by the unusual frost early last May, should not\r\n     be discouraged. Just examine the limbs now and you will find that\r\n     three or four more shoots grew out where the one was killed. This\r\n     makes more fruit buds for next year and the shortage of crop this\r\n     year will be more than made up next.\r\n\r\n     \"The writer believes that walnut growing will prove to be the most\r\n     profitable industry in the Willamette Valley.\r\n\r\n     \"WM. M. REECE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a characteristic of the walnut and hickory, and possibly\r\nother nut trees, to send down a tap root deep into the earth to draw up\r\nthe distilled and purified moisture that has been refined and sweetened\r\nin the lower depths. The older boys of the Middle Western states can\r\nrecall the time when they wandered through the woods in late winter\r\ntime, with a long pole or rail on their shoulders with which they\r\n\"pulled hickory root.\" The young sprout was \"withed\" around near one end\r\nof the pole, then all hands put their shoulders under the long end and\r\nwith an \"altogether, heave, oh,\" draw up a tap root 4, 6 and 8 feet\r\nlong. The lowest end was the choicest and sweetest. It was delicious and\r\nin the division of a day's hunt some of these found their way to \"his\r\nbest girl\" at school.\r\n\r\nWhether the water down in these lower depths possesses these qualities,\r\nand that they are necessary to give the Oregon walnut its superiority is\r\nyet a matter of speculation, but that these conditions exist is well\r\nknown and should have fullest consideration by the intelligent walnut\r\nculturist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tap Root of a Two-year-old Black Walnut showing how the\r\nroot grows down to permanent water level, thus insuring full crops\r\nregardless of weather conditions_]\r\n\r\nCut of tap root of a 2-year-old American Black which grew in the lower\r\nred hill land of Yamhill County. There is but one lateral root near the\r\nsurface and this was probably caused by the tap root striking harder\r\nsoil on its way down to permanent moisture level.\r\n\r\nThis tap root is 3 feet long and nearly 6 inches in circumference. It is\r\none of the best object lessons to be had in walnut culture in Oregon.\r\n\r\nThough the Willamette Valley has practically four rainless months of\r\nsunshine, irrigation is unnecessary. There is no other country\r\ncomparable to it. Its cool and dewy summer nights, together with its\r\ngreat subterranean reservoir supplied by the winter rains, are the\r\nreasons why its crops never fail and why its fruits fill \"red, round and\r\nluscious,\" and why the walnut has so persistently shown its preference\r\nfor this favored region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT CULTIVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the walnut is the hardiest of trees and in many cases has borne\r\nheavily in Oregon without cultivation, experience has proved that, like\r\nfruit trees, cultivation up to the tenth or twelfth years increases the\r\ngrowth, the yield and the quality of the product. After full maturity no\r\nfurther cultivation is necessary, the tree taking care of itself with\r\nthe independence of any forest tree.\r\n\r\nWith a young grove it is best to plow between the rows after the rains\r\ncease in the spring, and then stir the ground occasionally all through\r\nthe summer with the harrow or disk; this holds the moisture. When some\r\ntrees seem backward a trench should be dug some two feet or so away, and\r\na couple of feet deep, filled with fertilizer and closed over. This will\r\nencourage hardier and more rapid growth. Lime can also be used with good\r\neffect, it being customary in England to haul wagon loads to the walnut\r\nlands. Continually hoeing and digging constitute the best treatment, as\r\none tree on the Prince place, a Mayette, has proved. It was given daily\r\ncultivation, by way of experiment, and more than doubled the size and\r\nyield of other trees of the same age not so treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING WALNUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts require very little pruning. However, to do well they must have\r\nplenty of light and air, and there must be room under the trees to\r\ncultivate. To this end, keep all lateral growths removed the first two\r\nyears, pushing the strong terminal growth. Young trees so treated often\r\nmake five or six feet in that time. They must be staked and tied with a\r\nbroad strip of cloth. Cross the cloth between the stake and the twig so\r\nas not to bruise the tender wood. As the limbs begin to grow take out an\r\noccasional one to prevent the tree becoming too thick. When large limbs\r\nare removed, cut on the slant, carefully waxing to prevent decay.\r\nHeading-in is often beneficial when the tree does not seem to be\r\nfruitful. Train the trees upward as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn Roumania and some of the eastern countries of Europe, some of the\r\nwalnut trees have such an enormous spread that a flock of five hundred\r\nsheep can lie in comfort beneath the shade of one tree and have ample\r\nroom. If this vine-like tendency to spread can be obviated by\r\nintelligently training the trees upward, and its productiveness\r\nmaintained or increased, the walnut grower of Oregon will have\r\naccomplished much in the conservation of our resources.\r\n\r\nAt present we can make a tree that will produce 500 pounds of walnuts in\r\n25 to 30 years. With 12 trees to the acre, will give 6000 pounds of\r\nnuts; two and one-half times that of wheat at 40 bushels per acre, and\r\nthey will not require the expensive refrigerator cars and rapid transit\r\nof perishable fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING THE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will only be necessary to train the limbs in seven or eight feet all\r\nround to be able to double the number of trees to the acre. Then train\r\nthe trees skyward and increase the number of nut-bearing boughs, and the\r\nyield will be increased accordingly. If the nuts on the higher branches\r\nfill as well as on the lower, the tree can not be made to grow too high,\r\nbecause we have no violent storms to throw down the trees, and the nuts\r\nare self-gathering. These and many other valuable and interesting\r\nproblems in the industry are to be worked out.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Lewis, who is good authority, a later and better\r\nmethod is to cut the young tree back to 4 feet and make it throw out\r\nthree or four laterals. When these laterals are fully grown, bind them\r\nup in a bundle one or two feet diameter with soft strands of rope. In\r\nthe dormant season cut these laterals back to about two feet. This will\r\nmultiply the branches. Cut back the new growths again the next year, and\r\nso on; this will greatly increase the nut-bearing boughs and will train\r\nthe tree upward. This seems to be the most sensible method of pruning\r\nyet proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO DISEASES INJURE OREGON WALNUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft, moist atmosphere of western Oregon, so favorable to the\r\nEnglish walnut, seems wholly unfavorable to pests that destroy the crop\r\nin other climates. A crop has never been lost or materially injured in\r\nOregon through these sources; in fact, so free are the Oregon trees of\r\nsuch enemies that little thought or attention has been given to this\r\nphase of the subject. In a few localities where caterpillars have\r\nattacked the foliage they have been quickly eradicated by an arsenic\r\nspray. Fumigating will kill insect life. A bacterial disease that has\r\nmade its appearance in California has not been seen in this state.\r\nWinter spray of lime and sulphur will kill moss and lichens, which are\r\nabout the only parasites that attempt to fasten on Oregon walnut trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Walnut Trees Planted About 1850 Near McMinnville, on\r\nthe Yamhill River_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLLINATION\r\n\r\nThe Walnut]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery fruit and nut grower should know the simple theory of pollination.\r\nWhen a tree appears thrifty but fails to produce, nine times in ten the\r\ntrouble is with the pollination. The walnut is bi-sexual and\r\nself-fertile; the staminate catkins appear first, at the end of the\r\nyear's growth (see Fig. 1), and the female blossoms, or pistillates,\r\nfrom one to three weeks later at the end of the new growth (see Fig. 2).\r\nThus the staminate catkins sometimes fall before the pistillates form,\r\nand naturally there is no pollination and no crop. This should not\r\ndiscourage the grower or cause him to uproot his trees. Often by waiting\r\na few seasons--if the tree is of the correct variety--the trouble may\r\nright itself. Many growers have gotten a crop from single trees where\r\nthere was trouble with the pollination by artificially fertilizing, that\r\nis, shaking the pollen from fertile trees, even black walnut, over the\r\nbarren pistillates. Birds, insects, and the breezes carry pollen from\r\none tree to another. Therefore, if nuts for seed are desired, keep each\r\ngrove of pure strain separate that there may be no deterioration owing\r\nto cross-fertilization. But the mixed orchard may bear best. Some\r\nvarieties of walnut trees--notably the Los Angeles--are suitable only\r\nfor shade in Oregon and should not be planted with any other thought in\r\nmind. The staminate blossoms of this variety appear six weeks ahead of\r\nthe pistillates and, there being no pollination, naturally there are no\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Best in the World, Oregon Walnuts_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drying the Nuts_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARVEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harvest comes in October, a convenient season where there are fruit\r\ncrops to be taken care of. The process is extremely simple, being little\r\nmore than an old-fashioned \"nut gathering.\" When ripe, the nuts fall to\r\nthe ground, shedding their hulls on the way. They are picked up by boys,\r\ngirls, men and women.\r\n\r\nDuring the harvest three or four rounds must be made through the grove,\r\nperhaps a week elapsing between trips, each time slightly shaking the\r\ntrees to make the ripe nuts fall. On the last round, a padded mallet\r\nwith a long handle is used to dislodge the remaining nuts. The expense\r\nof harvesting is slight, five or six people being sufficient to care for\r\na fifty-acre grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHING AND DRYING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the nuts are gathered and brought in they are put into a revolving\r\nbarrel-churn holding about 12 to 16 gallons. Two buckets of water and\r\nabout the same of walnuts are put in together and the churn revolved for\r\nsome minutes. Then the nuts are taken out and spread on wire crates and\r\nplaced in the sun; they should be raked over two or three times a day.\r\nOr, if the weather is wet, they may be placed in the dry-house in a good\r\ndraught at about 70 degrees F. In an artificial drying if the heat\r\nbecomes too great the nuts will be rancid, as the oil-cells will burst:\r\nso better err on the side of underheating than overheating. If left out\r\nof doors, cover carefully to protect from dew. The crates for outdoor\r\ndrying are placed on trestles in some California groves, in order that\r\nthe air may circulate through the nuts. This is much better than placing\r\nthem on the ground, where they draw dampness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORTING AND GRADING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the walnuts are gathered, washed, dried and stored for a week or\r\nso to test the correctness of their drying, they are ready to be graded\r\nby passing over a sized screen. The choicest ones will sell at top\r\nmarket prices, and the culls a little under. The Prince grove harvest is\r\nnever graded, as he finds ready sale at highest prices for the entire\r\noutput just as it runs after sorting out the few imperfect nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING AND SHIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are next put into pound cartons, or 50-pound bags, common gunny\r\nsacks, ready for the market.\r\n\r\nNot being perishable none are lost in shipping or by keeping. Walnuts\r\nfrom Oregon groves have been kept two years, tasting as sweet and fresh\r\nas those in their first season. Long hauls are not objectionable, as the\r\nrough handling is not injurious to the well-sealed varieties grown in\r\nOregon. In this they have an advantage over fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT YIELD PER ACRE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is generally found that seedling trees properly treated come\r\ninto bearing the eighth year, this crop is usually light, doubling each\r\nsuccessive season for seven or eight years. From then on there is a\r\nsteady increase in crop and hardiness for many years. Often trees in\r\nOregon bear in their sixth year; while there are instances on record of\r\ntrees set out in February bearing the following autumn. This is no\r\ncriterion, however, merely an instance illustrating the unusual richness\r\nof Oregon soil, and its perfect adaptability to walnut culture.\r\n\r\nThirty-five acres on the Prince place yielded at twelve years, twelve\r\ntons of fine nuts, which were sold at 18 and 20 cents a pound, two cents\r\nabove the market price, making an average of $125 per acre. Another\r\ngrove of two acres yielded in their ninth year two tons, or a ton to the\r\nacre, netting the owner $360 an acre.\r\n\r\nMr. A. A. Quarnberg's eleven-year-old trees averaged twenty-five pounds\r\neach. Mr. Henry J. Biddle's ten and twelve-year-old trees averaged\r\nthirty pounds each. One hundred fifty dollars an acre from\r\ntwelve-year-old trees is a conservative estimate, though some groves not\r\ncultivated may fall under that figure, while others in a high state of\r\ncultivation will almost double it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WALNUT MARKET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very fact that in 1907 Oregon-grown walnuts commanded several cents\r\na pound higher price than those grown elsewhere indicates their market\r\nvalue. When ordinary nuts sold for 12 and 16 cents a pound Oregon nuts\r\nbrought 18 and 20 cents.\r\n\r\nNew York dealers who cater to the costliest trade throughout the United\r\nStates, and who have never handled for this purpose any but the finest\r\ntypes of imported nuts, pronounced the Oregon product satisfactory from\r\nevery standpoint--finely flavored, nutty, meaty and delicious. They were\r\nglad to pay an extra price to secure all that were available.\r\n\r\nIn the home market the leading dealers of Portland and Northwest cities\r\nreadily dispose of all of the Oregon walnuts obtainable at an advanced\r\nprice. In fact, the Oregon walnut has commanded a premium in every\r\nmarket into which it has been introduced.\r\n\r\nCalifornia walnuts are largely shipped east, the percentage entering the\r\nnorthern markets being comparatively small. The annual sum expended in\r\nOregon for imported nuts at the present time is $400,000. When the\r\nOregon growers are able to supply the home demand alone, shutting out\r\nimportations, the population of Oregon will have more than doubled, and\r\nthe amount expended in this state for walnuts will approach if it does\r\nnot exceed the million-dollar mark. In addition to this the eastern\r\nmarkets will be clamoring for Oregon walnuts, as they now absorb Hood\r\nRiver apples, Willamette valley cherries and Rogue River valley pears.\r\nWith eastern buyers always ready to pay an extra price for extra grade\r\nproducts, superior grades of Oregon walnuts will undoubtedly be\r\ncontracted for, leaving only the culls for home consumption.\r\n\r\nIt has been conservatively estimated that at the rate the population of\r\nthe United States is increasing, and the rate walnut consumption is\r\nincreasing, by the time every available acre in Oregon is in full\r\nbearing the supply will still fall far short of the demand. Judging by\r\npast experience in California this is no chimerical conception. Since\r\n1896 the walnut crop in that state has steadily increased, and in like\r\nproportion has the price advanced, from seven cents in 1896 to twenty\r\ncents in 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARED WITH FRUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparing walnut culture with fruit, one must take into consideration\r\nthe fact that distance from transportation facilities is not a\r\ndetriment; that there is very little expense in putting out or\r\nmaintaining a walnut grove; that insects, blight and disease are unknown\r\nto walnut groves of Oregon, thus obviating the cost of spraying; that\r\nthe expense of harvesting is exceedingly light; that no nut-fruit\r\nperishes--that it does not need to be sold at once, but will keep\r\nindefinitely, making a lost crop practically impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by experienced walnut growers that the annual cost of\r\ncultivation and pruning should not exceed $10 an acre, while harvesting\r\nshould not exceed 20 cents per hundred pounds. It is a simple matter to\r\nfigure the profits.\r\n\r\nThe original investment in a walnut grove may be made a comparatively\r\nsmall amount; thus it appeals particularly to those of limited means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POUND PACKAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult or impossible to establish a uniform package good for\r\nevery year. Walnuts are not like other fruits; size is not a sure\r\nindication of weight. The pound package used by Mr. Thos. Prince is\r\n3-3/4 x 4-1/2 x 5-1/4 inches, which in 1907 when filled weighed 17\r\nounces, in 1908 it weighed 16 ounces, and in the dry year of 1909 it\r\nweighed but 14 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT CONFECTIONERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cut on page 5 shows the best method of cracking walnuts to extract\r\nthe kernel in halves without breaking. Grasp the nut between the thumb\r\nand forefinger at the seam, place on a hard surface of stone or iron and\r\nstrike sharply with a light hammer only sufficient to crack the shell\r\nwithout crushing the kernel.\r\n\r\nThis method is used by most manufacturers of great varieties of walnut\r\nconfectionery, some of which are shown in the picture. Walnut\r\nchocolates, walnut taffy, walnut log, panoche, nougat and many other\r\narticles, as well as walnut sundries to put on dishes of ice cream are\r\namong the tasty confections for which the demand is very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUTS IN COOKING\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of the delightful ways in which walnuts may be used on the table:\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT BREAD\r\n\r\n  1 pound hard wheat flour.\r\n  1 pound whole wheat flour.\r\n  1 cup good yeast.\r\n  1 cup ground walnuts.\r\n  1 tablespoonful Orleans molasses.\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls melted lard or butter.\r\n\r\nMix with warm water; let it raise quite light, then mould, raise and\r\nbake as other bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEMS\r\n\r\nGraham, wheatlet or cornmeal gems are greatly improved by adding a few\r\nwalnut kernels ground fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT CAKE\r\n\r\n3 eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately, 1/2 cup--scant--butter, 3/4\r\ncup milk, 1 cup walnuts ground or chopped, 1-1/2 cups granulated sugar,\r\n1/2 teaspoonful each of lemon and vanilla, 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder,\r\nflour to make a moderately stiff batter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE NUT CAKE\r\n\r\n3 eggs, 3/4 cup each of brown and white sugar, 3/4 cup of coffee and\r\nmilk mixed, 1 cup ground walnuts, 4 tablespoonfuls melted butter, 2\r\nteaspoonfuls ground chocolate or cocoa, most of 1 nutmeg grated, 2\r\nteaspoonfuls baking powder, flour to make moderately stiff batter.\r\n\r\nMore satisfactory results are obtained by baking either of these cakes\r\nin two deep layercake tins and putting the two parts together with any\r\ngood filling.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT COOKIES\r\n\r\n3 cups sugar--Extra C preferred--3/4 pound of butter, 2 or 3 eggs, 1 cup\r\nof water, 1 teaspoonful of baking powder, 1/2 a nutmeg, a little ginger\r\nand cinnamon, 1 cup walnuts ground fine, 4 cups of flour. Roll thin and\r\nbake in a quick oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE NUT SALAD\r\n\r\n4 cups of good tart apples cut in small cubes or chopped not too fine, 1\r\ncup of coarsely ground, or chopped nuts. Stir lightly into these 1 cup\r\nof sugar and 1/2 of a nutmeg grated fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESSING FOR SAME\r\n\r\n2-3 cup of cold water, 2 tablespoons strong vinegar, 1/2 cup of sugar.\r\nAdd one egg, well beaten. Put this on the stove and stir constantly\r\nuntil well cooked. If this is done carefully it will not curdle. Take\r\nfrom the stove and add a lump of butter the size of a walnut, grate in a\r\nlittle nutmeg and stir gently until the butter is well melted and mixed.\r\nSome whipped cream may be added to this when cool if desired or\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY-PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to walnuts as nuts, they pay handsomely as pickles. For this\r\npurpose they must be picked green. This could be made a most profitable\r\nside industry in connection with large groves.\r\n\r\nOne grower had an inquiry for two carloads of green walnuts to be used\r\nfor this purpose. Large quantities are imported annually and they sell\r\nat very high prices.\r\n\r\nThey are also used for dyeing purposes, giving a beautiful brown shade\r\ndifficult to obtain except with walnut hulls.\r\n\r\nOil which is often substituted for olive oil is manufactured from\r\nwalnuts, thus suggesting another commercial avenue. One hundred pounds\r\nof walnuts produce eighteen pounds of oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _No. 1, 1 Vrooman Franquette. No. 2, 2 Mayette. No. 3, 3\r\nMayette Rouge. No. 4, 4 Parisienne.

They are probably the handsomest\r\nwalnut as to size, form and color as well as taste that may be found\r\nanywhere. The tree has not had an orchard try-out yet. If it proves to\r\nbe a good bearer with the other qualities suitable for this climate and\r\nsoil condition, it will enter the field high up in the standard of\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nThere is some discrepancy in what constitutes standard varieties of\r\nwalnuts. We have endeavored to get nuts both from Oregon and California\r\nto fix a uniform understanding as to the different varieties. The types\r\nsubmitted by Mr. A. McGill of the Oregon Nursery Co., Plate 1, are No.\r\n1, 1 Vrooman Franquette, No. 2, 2 Mayette, No. 3, 3 Mayette Rouge, No.\r\n4, 4 Parisienne, No. 5, 5 Praeparturien, No. 6, 6 Chaberte, No. 7,\r\nCluster.\r\n\r\nPlate No. 2, by Mr. Ferd Groner, No. 1, 1 Franquette, No. 2, 2 Glady,\r\nNo. 3, 3 Payne, No. 4, 4 Mayette, No. 5, 5 Meylan, No. 6, 6 Parisienne,\r\nNo. 7 Cluster, No. 8 Praeparturien, are about as near uniformly correct\r\nas we have.\r\n\r\nThe Chaberte nuts, which confectioners use, are a special industry, the\r\nkernels being slipped out of the shells without breaking, and sold in\r\nthis form. All the smaller nuts, the imperfect ones--the culls--find\r\nready sale both shelled and unshelled for the manufacture of walnut\r\ncandy, walnut cake, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHTS, KERNEL AND TASTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Walnut Show was held at McMinnville, November 1, 1907, and was\r\njudged by H. M. Williamson, Secretary of the State Board of\r\nHorticulture.

In this is the food value\r\nof the walnut. The food value will in time be the commercial value.\r\nThere is very little variation in the taste of any one variety of wild\r\nnuts or fruits, but the cultivated walnut, as well as the cultivated\r\npeach and apple, has a great variety of tastes, and it does not require\r\nan expert to distinguish the good from the poor qualities.\r\n\r\nWalnuts should be graded as to variety, the varieties should then be\r\ngraded as to size, but the paramount duty of the grower is to produce a\r\ncreamy, delicious walnut of excellent flavor. The soil and climate has\r\nproven their excellence, and it is now for the intelligent grower to do\r\nhis part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD INVEST\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional men and women, business men and women, those living in\r\ncities and towns and confined to offices, stores and factories, will\r\nfind an investment in forty or fifty acres of walnut land at the present\r\ntime wholly within their possibilities. Special terms can be arranged\r\nand their groves planted and cared for at small cost. While they are\r\nworking their groves will be growing toward maturity, and in less than a\r\ndecade they may be free from the demands of daily routine: the grove\r\nwill furnish an income, increasing each season until the twentieth year,\r\nand will prove the most pleasant kind of old age annuity, and the\r\nrichest inheritance a man could leave his children.\r\n\r\nThe practical farmer, or the inexperienced man who desires to escape the\r\ntyranny of city work by way of the soil will find that a walnut grove\r\noffers an immediate home, a living from small fruits and vegetables\r\nwhile his trees are maturing, and at the end of eight or ten years, the\r\nbeginning of an income that will every year thereafter increase, while\r\nthe labor exacted will gradually lessen until it amounts to practically\r\nnothing. Like rearing children, a walnut grower's troubles are over with\r\nthe trees' infant days.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist can find no better place for his money than safely\r\ninvested in Oregon walnut lands; the rise is certain and near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The \"Meat\" of the Walnut_]\r\n\r\nSome years ago \"Outlook,\" a most conservative publication, spoke of the\r\nEnglish walnut as \"a tree of vast commercial importance in the far\r\nwest.\"\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank states: \"The consumption of walnuts is increasing among\r\nall civilized nations faster than any other food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nB. M. Lelong, Secretary of the California State Board of Horticulture,\r\nwrote in 1896:\r\n\r\n\"California growers have had a long and varied experience with many\r\nfailures, and when they finally began to place their walnuts on the\r\nmarket they were obliged to accept the humiliating price of from 3 to 6\r\ncents a pound less than that paid for imported walnuts.\"\r\n\r\nIn Oregon the reverse is true. Our walnuts command a price above that\r\npaid for walnuts raised anywhere else. The size, cracking-out quantity,\r\ndelicate flavor and delicious creamy taste, are the qualities that give\r\nthe Oregon walnut its surpassing excellence. If we have this\r\npre-eminence at the beginning of the industry, what may we expect when\r\nintelligent cultivation has produced the best grade of walnuts of which\r\nour soil and climate are capable?\r\n\r\nTo Oregon, then, with its vast areas adapted to this industry, must the\r\nworld look for its great annual walnut harvest in the years to come. The\r\nfar-seeing man will secure an interest in Oregon walnut lands now,\r\nbefore speculation and a general awakening to their real value have\r\nboosted the price to that of walnut lands elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View in Prince Walnut Grove Dundee, Oregon_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON WALNUT AREA BY COUNTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The price of land varies according to location; the cheaper land\r\nis not all cleared.\r\n\r\n                Groves now     Bearing trees.

Exposition and was awarded a gold medal. They\r\nhave a very attractive and artistic way of putting up an exhibit,\r\nclassifying and arranging the different varieties in glass cases in such\r\na manner as to attract universal attention and call forth the heartiest\r\nexclamations of admiration. The accompanying cut shows one of their\r\nexhibits in position. It is nine feet high and nearly five feet wide and\r\nis faced alike on both sides.\r\n\r\nThis club was organized for the purpose of studying the walnut industry\r\nin all its details. They employ scientists and experts to tell how and\r\nto demonstrate the various methods of walnut culture. There are scores\r\nof 5 and 10-acre tracts planted to walnuts in the vicinity, as well as\r\nexperimental trees on the lots in town and along the streets. They call\r\nMcMinnville \"The Walnut City.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walnut Exhibit\r\n\r\nas prepared by the Walnut Club of McMinnville for the display of\r\n\r\nOREGON GROWN WALNUTS\r\n\r\nin several of the principal Eastern Offices of the\r\n\r\nOREGON RAILROAD & NAVIGATION CO. and SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO.
