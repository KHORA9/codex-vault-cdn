Never, if he has real blood in his veins.\r\nHe faces a primitive struggle for life. It is a question of reinventing\r\nprimitive means of living. How to make a fire, how to obtain food, how\r\nto clothe and shelter himself—these are the immediate problems to be\r\nmet. He is a Robinson Crusoe of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThis story of a modern Crusoe in the far Northern forests embodies many\r\nactual experiences, and it is an epitome of the basic facts of outdoor\r\nlife. In books like Harper’s Camping and Scouting, Outdoor Book, Young\r\nNaturalists, and others, the appliances of civilization are always at\r\nhand. It is a very different situation when one is lost in the depths of\r\nthe forest without food, fire, weapons, or compass. But the problem of\r\nworking out means of existence is one that will interest every lover of\r\noutdoor life, whether his interest is in camping, canoeing, fishing, or\r\nhunting, whether he is a member of the Boy Scouts or the Woodcraft\r\nIndians or simply an individual who knows the call of the wild. The\r\nadventures of Mr. Verrill’s hero forth a story of thrilling interest and\r\nconstant suspense. And it is also full of suggestions which will\r\nstimulate many readers to work out some of the hero’s problems for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROONED IN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nALONE IN THE WILDERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all happened in the twinkling of an eye. I turned quickly at a sudden\r\ncry from Joe—my half-breed guide—in time to see him cast the handle of\r\nhis broken paddle aside and leap forward for the extra paddle. Before he\r\ncould reach it the canoe swerved, swung broadside to the rushing\r\ncurrent, crashed sickeningly against the jagged rocks, and the next\r\ninstant I was floundering about in the icy, swirling water. Bumping\r\nagainst rocks, struggling for breath, battling frantically with the\r\ntorrent, I was swept down the river. Time and again my feet touched\r\nbottom, but each time, ere I could gain a foothold, I was drawn under,\r\nand each second I realized that my strength was growing less, that my\r\nlungs were bursting for air, and that in a few more moments all would be\r\nover. Down, down, I sank; above me the green water closed in and from my\r\nmouth and nostrils tiny bubbles of escaping air rose upward despite my\r\nevery effort to withhold the scanty breath within my lungs. I was\r\ndrowning I knew, and vaguely I wondered what had become of Joe, and how\r\nmy friends would take the news of my loss here in this river of the\r\ngreat wilderness. Suddenly my foot touched a hard object. I threw all of\r\nmy last remaining strength into a spasmodic kick and lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nSlowly I opened my eyes and with wonder looked upon a strip of deep-blue\r\nsky against which the dark-green boughs of evergreens were sharply\r\noutlined. For a space I marveled, for so firmly convinced had I been\r\nthat I was drowned I could scarce realize that I was not looking with\r\nspiritual eyes at a scene in another world. Then it dawned upon me that\r\nthrough some miracle I had been saved, and with a mighty effort I sat\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI found myself upon the very brink of a little precipice—a natural dam\r\nover which the river fell in a miniature cataract, although the greater\r\nportion of the current swept to the left and poured like a mill-race\r\nthrough a narrow channel in the rocks. In a moment I realized how I had\r\nescaped. My final kick had driven me beyond the sweep of the current, I\r\nhad been washed upon the edge of the waterfall, and my position had\r\nallowed the water to drain from my lungs. I was still terribly weak, I\r\nwas choking with the water I had swallowed, my head swam, and with the\r\nutmost difficulty I half crawled, half waded to the shore and threw\r\nmyself upon the moss-covered bank where rays of sunshine penetrated the\r\nfoliage overhead.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was saved from death in the river by the merest chance, still\r\nmy plight was desperate, for I was alone in the heart of the great\r\nwoods, miles from civilization or settlements and without food, weapons,\r\nshelter, or anything save the clothes upon my back and the few trifles\r\nmy pockets might contain. Possibly, I thought, the canoe might be washed\r\nashore with its contents, or Joe might be safe and in the vicinity; and\r\nwith these ideas strong in my mind I rose and slowly walked along the\r\nriver’s bank. I was now rapidly regaining strength, and, with the aid of\r\na stout pole of dead wood which I picked up, I had little trouble in\r\nmaking my way up the stream. Presently I called out Joe’s name, but only\r\nthe soft echo of the woods replied. Again I trudged on, frequently\r\ncalling and ever searching the edges of the stream and the eddies for\r\nthe wreckage of the canoe, but not a sign of my guide or of my outfit\r\ncould I find. At last, firmly convinced that Joe had been lost and that\r\nthe canoe and its contents were gone forever, I seated myself upon a log\r\nand strove to collect myself and look squarely at the future. It would\r\nhave been bad enough to be cast away in a country which I knew, but here\r\nI was completely at a loss. I had trusted entirely to Joe, and I knew\r\nnothing of this wilderness nor of the direction or route to the\r\nsettlements; while, to make matters still worse, my compass had been\r\nlost in the river.\r\n\r\nThe last was really the least of my troubles, for I had little doubt\r\nthat I could readily determine which direction was east and which west\r\nby the sun, and I had also heard that the moss grew thickest on one side\r\nof the trees; but as to whether that side was north or south I could not\r\nremember, cudgel my brains as I might. I also knew, in a general way,\r\nthat the settlements were southward from the camp we had left, and I\r\nknew that Joe had expected to reach them by running down with the\r\ncurrent, paddling across a lake, and tramping through the woods, and\r\nthat he had stated the entire trip would consume about five days.\r\nHowever, I could not even I guess how many miles we had traveled before\r\nthe canoe upset, and I had taken no notice of the turns and twists in\r\nthe river. For all I knew, the stream might flow east, or even north, at\r\nthe spot where I had crawled ashore, and if I attempted to travel in any\r\ndirection—using the flow of the current as my guide—I might easily\r\ntravel directly _away_ from my fellow-men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I CALLED OUT JOE’S NAME]\r\n\r\nMy sole hope of reaching civilization would be in following the banks of\r\nthe river, and this I realized would mean many weary days of tramping\r\nalone and unguided through the great forest.\r\n\r\nVainly I regretted having trusted so completely to Joe that I had paid\r\nno attention to the surroundings as we swept down the stream, and for\r\nthat matter had not even asked for information which would have proved\r\nso valuable to me now. But it was wasting valuable time to spend the few\r\nremaining hours of daylight in regrets, and I was thankful for the few\r\nodds and ends of woodcraft and forest lore I had picked up during my\r\nlife in the woods.\r\n\r\nMy clothing had partly dried, but with the passing of the bit of\r\nsunlight from the opening between the trees the air had become chilly\r\nand I was shivering with cold, the strain of my recent experience and my\r\nforebodings for the future. Rising from my seat, I strode back and\r\nforth, swinging my arms and striving by exercise to regain in some\r\nmeasure the circulation of my blood and a feeling of warmth. Activity,\r\neven of this forced sort, did me a world of good, and I began to plan\r\nfor my immediate wants. Shelter I must have, and warmth, before night\r\nfell, and while I was not at the moment hungry, I realized that food of\r\nsome sort would become a most pressing need by the following morning.\r\nShelter without warmth would be of little value, and I thought with\r\nlonging of the roaring fires which Joe had built before our camps each\r\nnight and about which we had lounged while telling tales of past\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nFire I _must_ obtain, and in a mad hope that at least one good match\r\nmight still remain in my pockets, I sought feverishly and emptied every\r\none of my pockets upon a smooth rock. My total possessions thus\r\ndisplayed consisted of a small bunch of keys, a few small coins, a\r\ncambric handkerchief, a heavy jackknife, and the headless sticks of some\r\nmatches from which the phosphorus had been completely soaked off. I\r\ngazed at these few articles with the bitterest disappointment, for of\r\nthem all the knife was, as far as I could see, the only thing of any\r\nvalue to me in my present plight. With it I thought I might be able to\r\nfashion a bow-drill and spindle and thus obtain fire, for in my youth I\r\nhad accomplished this feat when “playing Indian,” but I well knew the\r\ndifficulty in obtaining just the proper kinds of wood and I realized\r\nthat a search for them would consume much valuable time, whereas but an\r\nhour or two of daylight now remained. Then flint and steel occurred to\r\nme. I had the steel in my knife, but I did not know whether flint was to\r\nbe obtained in the vicinity. However, I rose, made my way to the stony\r\nedge of the river, and sought diligently for some bit of rock which\r\nresembled flint. Each piece that struck my fancy I tried with my knife,\r\nand several gave off faint, bright sparks. All these I pocketed and,\r\nhaving obtained quite an assortment, I retraced my way to the rock\r\nwhereon I had left my other possessions and prepared to try my hand at\r\nobtaining fire by means of my knife and the pebbles.\r\n\r\nI realized that the tiny sparks which I could obtain in this way would\r\nnever ignite a twig, or even a bit of bark, and that some inflammable\r\ntinder, which would catch the spark and which could then be fanned to a\r\nflame, must be secured before I could hope to succeed. As I was thinking\r\nof this my gaze fell upon a black-edged hole in my handkerchief. It had\r\nbeen burned, a couple of days before, by a spark from Joe’s pipe blown\r\nback by the wind. The incident was too trivial to have filled my\r\nthoughts for an instant at another time, but now all its details came\r\nback to me with a rush and I gave a shout of joy as I suddenly realized\r\nthat this burnt hole and the events which had caused it had actually\r\nsolved my puzzle. Seizing the square of cotton cloth, which was now\r\nquite dry, I weighted it down with bits of stone—for the apparently\r\nuseless handkerchief had now become of the utmost value to me—and\r\nhurried into the woods in search of dry twigs and other inflammable\r\nmaterial. I had not long to hunt, for dead and dried trees were all\r\nabout; several white birches furnished sheets of paper-like bark, and\r\nwith a great armful of fire-wood I returned to my rock. Gathering the\r\nhandkerchief into a loosely crumpled mass, I placed it on the rock, held\r\nthe most promising of my pebbles close to it, and struck the stone\r\nsharply with the back of my knife-blade. A little shower of sparks flew\r\nforth at the blow, but none fell upon the handkerchief. Again and again\r\nI tried, each time holding the stone in a different position and trying\r\nmy best to cause the sparks to fall upon the handkerchief. Finally I\r\ngathered the cloth in my hand, held the pebble in the midst of its\r\nfolds, and struck it.\r\n\r\nSparks gleamed against the handkerchief, but no sign of charring cloth\r\nor wisp of smoke rewarded me. Surely, I thought, these sparks must be as\r\nhot as the tiny, glowing ember from Joe’s pipe, and I unfolded and\r\nexamined the handkerchief about the burned spot. Perhaps, I thought,\r\nthis particular part of the cloth was more inflammable than the rest,\r\nand again gathering up the handkerchief, with the old burn close to the\r\npebble, I again struck it with my knife.\r\n\r\nCarefully I examined the cloth and the next instant dropped knife and\r\npebble and cried aloud in triumph, for at one edge of the charred hole a\r\ntiny speck of red glowed in the dusk of coming evening, and spread\r\nrapidly in size. Carefully I blew upon it, folded another corner of the\r\ncloth against it, and waved it back and forth. Brighter and brighter it\r\ngleamed; a tiny thread of pungent smoke arose from it and an instant\r\nlater a little tongue of flame sprang from the cambric, and I knew that\r\nfire, warmth, and comfort were mine. It was but an instant’s work to\r\nignite a piece of birch bark and push it among the pile of wood and\r\ntwigs, and then, carefully extinguishing the handkerchief—for it had now\r\ngrown very precious in my eyes—I squatted before the blazing fire and\r\nreveled in the comforting warmth from its glow. Although it was too late\r\nto consider ways and means of shelter that night, I knew that I could\r\nkeep warm, and as soon as the chill and stiffness had been driven from\r\nmy bones and muscles I set diligently at work gathering great piles of\r\nfuel to feed the flames during the night. Several large logs were close\r\nby, and these, with much labor, I dragged to the fire and placed near at\r\nhand to use later on when I went to sleep. By the time I had accumulated\r\na supply which I judged would last through the night, I discovered that\r\nI was very hungry. I had not eaten since the forenoon, and I had worked\r\nstrenuously, to say nothing of the utter exhaustion occasioned by my\r\nsemi-drowning. My efforts to obtain fire and the extent to which I had\r\nconcentrated my mind on this problem had kept me up and doing until now,\r\nbut, once the fire was blazing merrily and an ample supply of fuel was\r\nat hand, I felt weary beyond words, famished, and absolutely worn out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I EMPTIED THE CONTENTS OF MY POCKETS ON A ROCK”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I STRUCK THE STONE WITH MY KNIFE-BLADE”]\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and the forest was black as midnight, but the sky was\r\nstill faintly bright with the afterglow and the river shone silvery as\r\nit swirled and eddied between its shadowy banks. There was no hope of\r\nfinding berries, roots, or other edibles in the woods after dusk. I had\r\nno means of catching game or fish, which, I knew, were abundant, and I\r\ncommenced to think that I would die a miserable death of starvation\r\nbefore morning, when I suddenly recollected having seen a number of\r\nfresh-water mussels in some shallow backwaters of the river while\r\nhunting for my flinty pebbles. I had never eaten these shell-fish, but I\r\nfelt sure they were edible, and, seizing a blazing pine knot from the\r\nfire, I made my way to the shore and soon found the pools where I had\r\nnoticed the mollusks. There were not many—a bare dozen were all I could\r\nfind that night—but these I felt would be far better than nothing, and\r\nin a few moments I had them baking on a bed of hot coals. Hardly waiting\r\nfor them to cook, I raked them forth and devoured them ravenously, and\r\nnever did choicest food taste so delicate, so delicious, and so welcome\r\nto my lips as did those half-baked, slimy, unseasoned mussels eaten\r\nbeside my fire in the midst of the wilderness. Few as they were, they\r\nserved to refresh me greatly and to drive away the most pressing pangs\r\nof hunger, and, much as I desired more, I had not the strength or\r\nambition to trudge up and down the river-bank searching for the shells.\r\nPiling several huge logs on the fire, I formed a rude bed of fir twigs\r\nand, casting myself upon this, fell instantly into a deep, dreamless\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFOOD AND SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nI was awakened by a shaft of sunlight striking my face, and opened my\r\neyes to find the day well advanced. My first thought was of the fire,\r\nwhich had burned completely out. A thread of bluish smoke rose from the\r\nheap of ashes, however, and by raking these aside and thrusting bits of\r\nbirch bark amid the embers I soon had a new blaze started, which I piled\r\nhigh with dry wood. I was wonderfully strengthened and refreshed by my\r\nlong sleep, but I was all but famished, and as soon as the fire was\r\ngoing well I hurried to the river for more mussels. I found a few here\r\nand a few there, and with a dozen or two went back to the fire and\r\npresently was breakfasting off the shell-fish. I realized that while\r\nthese would serve to prevent me from dying of hunger and they were\r\nwonderfully welcome in my present starved condition, I would be forced\r\nto search for something else to eat very soon. In the first place, the\r\nsupply of the bivalves was limited. They would, I felt, prove far from\r\npalatable save when I was very hungry, and I doubted how much\r\nnourishment was contained in their flabby meat.\r\n\r\nHad I possessed firearms or even fishing-tackle my plight would not have\r\nbeen bad, for birds and animals could, I knew, be readily found in the\r\nwoods, while trout and other fish were abundant everywhere in the\r\nwilderness streams. As I ate my mussels I sought to devise some method\r\nof securing game, but every plan that occurred to me was spoiled by some\r\nunsurmountable obstacle which arose. I had often snared game and had\r\neven caught partridges with a slender noose on the end of a pole—for in\r\nthe north woods these birds sit stupidly upon the low fir-trees and\r\nallow the hunter to pull them from their perches without taking flight.\r\nBut a snare required a fine line, a slender wire, or a horsehair, and I\r\nhad none. Fishing with a line was cast aside as out of the question for\r\nthe same reason, with the added lack of a hook. Then a bow and arrow\r\noccurred to me, but I soon realized that arrows without feathers or\r\nsharp, heavy points would be impossible, and that neither heads nor\r\nfeathers were within reach. Then I thought of spears, for I knew that\r\nmany savage tribes used spears both in fishing and in hunting, and I\r\ndecided to try my skill at harpooning some unsuspicious fish or some\r\nunusually stupid partridge. It was a long time before I could find a\r\nstraight, light stick for a haft, but at last I found a slender pole of\r\nweathered, dried spruce cast up by the river, and, by dint of whittling\r\nand trimming, this was worked into a very straight, well-balanced shaft\r\nwhich I judged would fulfil my requirements. I tried throwing it several\r\ntimes and found it easy to handle, but that it could not be depended\r\nupon, for one end was nearly as heavy as the other and it would fly\r\nsideways and strike a glancing blow as frequently as it would strike end\r\non.\r\n\r\nI realized that a head of some sort was required, but this I could not\r\nfurnish, and rather than lose all the time I had spent on it I\r\ndetermined to try my hand at spearing a fish before throwing my weapon\r\naside. Whittling the end to a sharp point and cutting numerous barbs, or\r\nnotches, in it, I walked to the river and looked carefully into each\r\npool and backwater. I saw several fish, but each flitted out of view as\r\nthe spear was plunged downward, and I was about to abandon my attempts\r\nwhen luck favored me. Approaching one small pool, I gave a little start\r\nas a great bullfrog leaped almost from beneath my feet with a loud\r\ncroak. A moment later he appeared on the farther side of the pool, his\r\ngoggly eyes just showing above the water, and, approaching him\r\ncarefully, I drove my sharpened stick at his big, green body. It was a\r\nlucky stroke, for the frog was fairly impaled upon the stick, and I drew\r\nmy first victim from his watery home with a wonderful feeling of elation\r\nto think that unaided and alone I had actually succeeded in hunting and\r\ncapturing a live, wild creature to serve my needs.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, frogs had not occurred to me hitherto, but, now that I\r\nhad obtained one, I bestirred myself to capture a number. I realized\r\nthat with my crude spear I could not expect to kill many frogs, and that\r\nmy first success was pure luck more than anything else. Many a time when\r\na boy I had speared frogs when spending my summers on a farm, and now\r\nthat frogs were in my mind I remembered the two- or three-pronged spears\r\nwhich the farmers’ boys used. I was still hungry, and while my frog was\r\nbroiling I busied myself in making a real frog-spear. It was not a\r\ndifficult task. I had only to attach two slender, barbed pieces of hard\r\nwood to the sides of my spear. I had some trouble in binding them on,\r\nbut I sacrificed strips of my clothing for the purpose, and although the\r\ncompleted spear was very crude, I felt sure it would serve its purpose.\r\nI knew, however, that it would soon be blunted and broken among the\r\nrocks of the river and I also knew that in such spots frogs would be\r\nscarce and that in muddy or stagnant pools I would stand a much better\r\nchance of finding them. No swamps or pools were in the immediate\r\nvicinity, but I had little doubt that I could find some by a short\r\ntramp. I was very anxious to try my spear, but I also realized that I\r\nmust give time and thought to constructing a shelter to protect me in\r\ncase of rain, and, reluctantly abandoning my frog-hunt for the time\r\nbeing, I gave my whole attention to the problem of house-building. I had\r\nseen many a shack or “lean-to” built and had helped at the work myself,\r\nbut without an ax I knew that to build even the smallest and simplest\r\nshelter would necessitate a tremendous amount of hard labor and would\r\npresent almost insurmountable difficulties. With only a pocket-knife to\r\ncut the necessary trees, poles, and branches, I would be obliged to make\r\nthe shack of small stuff, and I trembled to think what fate might have\r\nin store for me if I should break my knife in an attempt to cut tough\r\nbranches from the trees.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I was to have a shelter at all it behooved me to begin at\r\nonce, and I started forth to select a site for my home. I found a\r\nsheltered, dry knoll with good drainage a short distance from the river\r\nand with plenty of building material in the form of balsam firs, pines,\r\nand birches near at hand. I first selected two young trees, about five\r\nfeet apart, and from these I cut the lower branches, leaving the stubs\r\nprojecting a few inches. Across two of these I placed a light spruce\r\npole and from the ends of this I laid other poles extending back at an\r\nangle to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis all sounds very simple and easy, now that I come to write it down,\r\nbut as a matter of fact it required hours of hard, back-breaking,\r\nhand-blistering work, and by the time this much was accomplished I was\r\nfaint with hunger. I succeeded in finding and eating a few mussels, but\r\nI had no time to devote to frog-hunting, and hurried back to my\r\nhouse-building. Across the two slanting poles other lighter poles were\r\nplaced, and over these the broad “fans” of fir were spread like\r\nshingles, the lowest layer being placed first with each succeeding layer\r\noverlapping the last. This was comparatively easy work, for the twigs\r\nwere small and easy to cut, and by late afternoon I had a shack which,\r\nthough not by any means complete, was far better than nothing but the\r\nblue sky for a shelter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE “LEAN-TO” WAS BUILT]\r\n\r\nI had an hour or two of daylight left, and determined to look for a\r\nlikely spot for frogs. I dared not walk far into the forest for fear of\r\nlosing my way in the fading afternoon light, but even a tramp of a few\r\nhundred yards away from the river was enough to convince me that there\r\nwere no swamps or ponds in the vicinity, for the ground was quite hilly\r\nand rocky. Deciding that my only chance lay in finding stray frogs in\r\nthe pools of the river, I walked down-stream for some distance,\r\nsearching carefully wherever there was a backwater or a puddle of water\r\nalong the shore. I found a number of mussels, which I pocketed, but no\r\nsign of frogs until I had traveled perhaps half a mile from my fire. At\r\nthis point a small brook fell in a tiny cascade over the bank into the\r\nriver, and, clambering up, I found that the little stream ran through an\r\nopen vale or glade luxuriant with ferns, brush, and rank-growing plants.\r\nThe stones over which it flowed were dark with a coating of moss, and in\r\nthe deep, still pools between the boulders I caught glimpses of great\r\nspeckled trout lurking in the shadows. It was an ideal trout-brook and I\r\ntried my best to spear one of the beautiful fish, but without success.\r\nHowever, I was rather pleased at my discovery, for even without\r\nfishing-tackle I felt confident that I could dam up one of the pools,\r\nbail out the water, and catch the trout with my hands. But there was no\r\ntime for this just then. In the hope of finding a frog I went on up the\r\nbrook. I had all but given up in despair when I reached a second\r\nminiature waterfall, and above this cascade I came upon a little pond\r\nsurrounded by alders and birches. It was a cool, shady spot and the\r\ndark, black water flecked with patches of green weeds and lily-pads gave\r\npromise of frogs. Hardly had I reached the edge of the pool when I spied\r\na fine bullfrog squatting among the weeds, and a moment later he had\r\nbeen successfully speared. I was delighted with the success of my crude\r\nweapon and crept cautiously around the pond, seeking more victims. Frogs\r\nwere plentiful and were very tame, for probably man had never disturbed\r\nthem, and before the growing dusk warned me that it was time to return\r\nto my camp I had obtained seven fine, big hoppers. As I was making my\r\nway toward the brook and the cascade I was startled by some good-sized\r\ncreature which sprang from the grass at the border of the pond and\r\nplunged into the water. A moment later I saw a furry, brown head\r\nfollowed by a silvery, rippling wake, cleaving the placid surface of the\r\npond, and realized that the animal which had caused my momentary fright\r\nwas merely a harmless muskrat. I stopped and watched the creature for\r\nseveral moments and longed to be able to secure him, for I well knew\r\nthat muskrats are edible and are even esteemed a delicacy. More than\r\nonce I had eaten their tender, white meat when cooked by Joe. It was\r\nuseless to give the matter any consideration, however, for without a gun\r\nthe muskrat was far beyond my reach, and reluctantly I proceeded on my\r\nway.\r\n\r\nPresently I noticed a path-like trail winding through the grass and\r\nweeds, and, looking closely, discovered the imprint of little feet upon\r\nthe soft and muddy ground. I recognized the muskrat’s runway, and with\r\nthe realization came the thought that I might trap the rats. To be sure,\r\nI had no traps at hand, but I had seen deadfalls set in the woods by the\r\nfur trappers and, while my memory was hazy as to just how they were\r\narranged, I felt quite confident that my ingenuity would find a way to\r\nrig up some sort of snare or deadfall which would serve my purpose. With\r\nmy mind filled with such thoughts I made my way back to my fire, which I\r\nreached just as darkness fell upon the wilderness. I dined well that\r\nnight on frogs, and placed my mussels in a pool beside the river as a\r\nreserve for another day.\r\n\r\nMuch of the evening I spent experimenting with bits of twigs and sticks\r\nof wood, endeavoring to devise a deadfall, and by dint of racking my\r\nmemory for details of traps I had seen, and by trying various methods, I\r\nfinally discovered several different triggers which I felt would work,\r\nand, well satisfied with my day’s labors and success, I fell asleep upon\r\na bed of soft fir branches in the lean-to.\r\n\r\nA couple of the frogs, which I had kept over, with a few mussels, served\r\nfor my breakfast the next morning, and I then set diligently at work to\r\ncomplete my shelter, for a light shower had fallen during the night and\r\nmy clothes were soaking wet when I awoke. To make the roof water-tight\r\nwas my first consideration and to accomplish this I peeled sheets of\r\nbirch bark from the trees, laid them like shingles on the roof, and\r\nsecured them in place by rocks from the river-bed. At first I had\r\ntrouble in preventing the stones from sliding and rolling off the\r\nslanting roof, but I soon devised a means of holding them in position by\r\nplacing light branches across the roof and catching their ends on the\r\nprojecting stubs of the roof timbers. In many ways I was greatly\r\nhandicapped for want of string or rope. It occurred to me that strips of\r\nbirch bark might serve, but I soon found that this had no strength to\r\nspeak of, and I determined to try other materials. The Indians, I well\r\nknew, used bark, roots, and withes for rope, but I had no knowledge of\r\nthe particular barks, roots, or withes which they employed, and I set\r\nmyself to experimenting with everything that grew in the neighborhood. I\r\nsoon eliminated many as useless, although certain roots appeared tough\r\nand fibrous, but these were all too gnarled and knobby or too short to\r\nserve as string. It was then that I began to realize how little I really\r\nknew of woodcraft or forest lore, although I had spent so many vacations\r\nin the woods. No doubt Joe or any other woodsman would have found life\r\neasy and simple if cast, as I was, upon his resources in the forest, but\r\nI had depended so completely upon others’ knowledge that I was obliged\r\nto seek blindly for the simplest things and only occasionally remembered\r\nsome trifling bit of woodcraft which I had seen when in Joe’s company in\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nWhile thinking of this I was sitting beside my hut. When I attempted to\r\nrise, my hand came in contact with a sharp stub projecting from the\r\nearth. It was a small thing—merely a twig which I had cut off while\r\nclearing the open space before my shelter—and to avoid further trouble\r\nwith it, I grasped it and strove to pull it up. Much to my surprise, it\r\nresisted my efforts. Seizing it with both hands, I jerked at it with all\r\nmy strength. Slowly it gave, and then, with a ripping sound, broke from\r\nthe loose, thin earth, and I tumbled backward and sprawled upon the\r\nground. I was curious to learn how such a small thing could be so\r\nstrongly embedded in the soil and I examined it carefully. Attached to\r\nthe bit of stem was a mass of long, fibrous roots. Seizing one of these,\r\nI attempted to break it. I twisted and pulled, but the root remained\r\nintact, and suddenly it dawned upon me that here was the very material I\r\ndesired—that these roots were as strong and tough as hempen rope, and\r\nthat by merest accident I had stumbled upon the very thing for which I\r\nhad been searching. Unfortunately, I did not know what plant the roots\r\nbelonged to, for only an inch or two of stem remained, and while the\r\nsupply of roots it bore would serve my present needs, I was very anxious\r\nto learn the identity of the useful growth in case I should require more\r\nroots in the future. With this end in view I set about comparing the\r\nbark and wood with other young sprouts in the vicinity, and whenever one\r\nresembled it I pulled it up and examined the roots. I searched for some\r\ntime before I was rewarded, and discovered that my lucky find was a\r\nyoung hemlock. Pine fir, spruce, and other trees I had tried in vain,\r\nbut hemlocks were not abundant, and those about were mostly large and\r\nhad been passed by in my former search. Now that I had discovered a\r\nsource of supply of binding materials, many problems which had\r\nconfronted me were simplified and I was greatly encouraged.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that during these first days of my life in the\r\nwilderness I had given no thought to making my way to the settlements.\r\nIn fact, this matter was ever present in my mind, but the very first day\r\nI had decided that before I attempted to make my way out of the woods I\r\nmust be equipped to secure food, provide shelter, and make fires.\r\nAnxious as I was to reach civilization, yet I knew how foolhardy it\r\nwould be to start blindly forth, trusting to luck for food or shelter,\r\nand with my limited knowledge of woodcraft. Here, where I had been cast\r\nashore, I was safe, at any rate, provided I could secure enough to eat,\r\nand I determined to make my headquarters at this spot until I could\r\nlearn by experience something of the resources of the forest and how to\r\nmake use of them. Already I had acquired much useful knowledge, and I\r\nfelt that if I could only succeed in trapping animals or snaring birds I\r\ncould start forth on my weary tramp in comparative safety as far as\r\nstarvation was concerned.\r\n\r\nI should have felt far more confident if I could have carried food with\r\nme, and I wondered if it would be possible to dry or cure frogs,\r\nmussels, or other meat. I knew that the Indians dried venison and made\r\npemmican, which I had frequently eaten, and I had heard of certain\r\ntribes who subsisted upon dried salmon, but venison was unattainable\r\nwith my present resources, and I was not at all sure that trout, even\r\nif I succeeded in obtaining them, would dry like salmon. Finally I\r\ndecided to experiment, and, lacking all else, to carry a supply of live\r\nmussels along when I set forth. These shells, I knew, would live for\r\nseveral hours without water, and, as I intended to follow the river, I\r\ncould easily keep them alive by frequent immersions in the water. Such\r\nthoughts brought up the question of vegetables, and I wondered if in\r\nthese woods there were edible roots or tubers of any kind.\r\n\r\nI remembered many boyhood books and stories telling of men lost in the\r\nwoods and subsisting upon roots and berries, but, try as I might, I\r\ncould not remember a single one which told just _what_ roots and berries\r\nprovided sustenance for the fictitious heroes.\r\n\r\nBerries, I felt sure, existed somewhere in the woods, but, aside from\r\nblueberries or blackberries and the tiny scarlet partridge berries, I\r\nknew of none which were edible, and I smiled to think how hungry I would\r\nbe if I depended upon the meager and uncertain supply of such things for\r\na livelihood. Once, when a youngster, I had dug up and eaten\r\nground-nuts, but they were gritty, tasteless things, and moreover I\r\ncould only tell where they grew by the delicate white flowers which\r\nbloomed only in the spring. Nuts did not exist in this forest, or, if\r\nthey did, they were not ripe at this season, and I therefore cast aside\r\nall ideas of securing a supply of vegetable food. Determined to try my\r\nhand at trapping and also to attempt to capture some trout, I started\r\nagain for the brook, carrying a supply of hemlock roots and my spear. It\r\noccurred to me that by braiding fine roots together I could devise a\r\nfishing-line, but the question of a hook then confronted me and I\r\ndecided to try my plan of bailing the water from a pool before\r\nexperimenting with hookmaking.\r\n\r\nI soon found a pool containing several fine fish, and cautiously, for\r\nfear the trout might slip out among the stones, I piled gravel and small\r\nrocks in all the visible crevices which connected the pool with the\r\nrunning waters of the brook. This accomplished, I piled rocks across the\r\nlittle channel where the brook ran into the pool, and by chinking all\r\nthe crevices with grass, twigs, and mud I at last had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the water diverted to one side. The pool, with its fish, now\r\nremained cut off from the surrounding water, and all I had to do was to\r\nscoop out the contents, leave the trout floundering about on the bottom,\r\nand pick them up with my hands. This all sounds very simple and easy,\r\nbut I had no scoop with which to bail out the water, and until I\r\nattempted the work I did not dream what a task I had set myself. I first\r\ntried bailing out the water with my hands, but as fast as I threw it out\r\nmore oozed in through tiny crevices and I soon gave this up as\r\nimpossible. Then it occurred to me that one of my shoes might serve as a\r\ndipper and, removing it from my foot, I tried to throw out the water by\r\nthis means. I _did_ succeed in making some progress, but very little,\r\nand I commenced to think that all my work had gone for naught when a bit\r\nof birch bark caught my eye and I had an inspiration. Many a time I had\r\nused birch-bark dippers and cups for drinking, when in camp with Joe,\r\nand I had seen boxes, packs, and other utensils made of the material. In\r\nfact, Joe had once proved to me that water could be boiled in a\r\nbirch-bark dish, and I laughed to think how I had so far overlooked the\r\nmanifold uses to which the bark could be put. It took but a few moments\r\nto strip a large sheet of bark from a convenient tree, and but a few\r\nmoments more to bend this into a deep, boxlike form. The ends were\r\neasily secured by means of the hemlock roots, and with the bark dipper,\r\nwhich would easily hold a gallon of water, I proceeded to empty the\r\npool. In a very short time the water was reduced to an inch or two at\r\nthe bottom and the flashing, bright-colored fish were flopping about\r\namong the stones.\r\n\r\nFour fine trout were the reward of my labors, and, placing them in my\r\nbirch-bark dipper and covering them with cool leaves, I set them among\r\nthe bushes beside the brook to await my return and then made my way\r\ntoward the muskrat runway to set the trap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SETTING THE DEADFALL]\r\n\r\nI did not know what sort of food the muskrat ate and I therefore decided\r\nto arrange a trap which would be sprung by the rat passing along the\r\ntrail. First I placed a smooth stick of wood across the run, and on\r\neither side among the grass I drove two stakes with a space of a few\r\ninches between them. In this space I slipped a fairly heavy log which I\r\nfound beside the pond, and I then lashed the tops of the stakes together\r\nso the log could slide readily up and down between the stakes which\r\nserved as guides, and across the lashing of roots I laid a light stick.\r\nFor a trigger I selected an “L”-shaped twig, and from one end of this I\r\ntied a strong root, with the other end of the fastening looped about the\r\nheavy log. This was adjusted until, when the trigger was placed across\r\nthe light stick between the uprights, the heavy log was raised a few\r\ninches above the log set in the pathway. Next a very light stick was\r\nplaced just above the lower log and the end of the trigger was placed\r\nresting against this, so that the pressure of the drop-log forced the\r\ntrigger against the stakes. It was a very simple arrangement, but I knew\r\nthat if any creature attempted to pass over the log upon the ground he\r\nwould of necessity move the trigger-stick and allow the log to drop upon\r\nhis back. The trap being set, I spent some time in securing a supply of\r\nfrogs about the pond, and then started toward camp. I soon reached the\r\nbrook and turned aside for the trout in their birch-bark receptacle,\r\nthinking with pleasurable anticipation of the fine meal in store for me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE DEADFALL WAS ARRANGED]\r\n\r\nI passed the pool, which was now rapidly filling up again, pushed aside\r\nthe bushes, and gave a gasp of astonishment—the birch-bark dish was\r\nlying on its side, absolutely empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was almost stunned by the discovery, but presently I\r\nrealized that some prowling creature had robbed me of the fish which I\r\nhad taken such pains to capture, and that I had only myself to blame for\r\nleaving the trout so carelessly within reach of any four-footed thief\r\nthat might pass by.\r\n\r\nIt was a keen disappointment to be deprived of my expected feast, but\r\nthere was nothing to be done save to drain another pool and capture more\r\nfish, if I wanted to eat trout that day.\r\n\r\nI was anxious, however, to discover what manner of beast had stolen my\r\nfish, and I sought carefully in the soft earth and among the vegetation\r\nfor signs of footprints. I had not long to search and soon discovered a\r\nnumber of tracks which I recognized as those of a fisher-cat, a large,\r\nmarten-like animal which every woodsman knows for an inveterate thief.\r\nMy first thought was to set a trap to capture the fisher, but, knowing\r\nthe flesh to be unfit to eat, I abandoned the idea as a waste of time\r\nand trouble and set about my work of draining another pool. This time I\r\nselected a rocky basin worn by the water of the brook in the ledge\r\nitself—a sort of pot-hole—with solid walls which obviated the necessity\r\nof chinking up the openings and crevices as I was obliged to do in the\r\npool I had drained before. With my birch-bark dipper the work of bailing\r\nout the pot-hole was simple and I soon secured a couple of good-sized\r\ntrout.\r\n\r\nWith these and my frogs I dined well and decided to set forth on my\r\ntramp as soon as possible, for, now that I could obtain fish so readily,\r\nI had little fear of starving, for I knew that every brook and river in\r\nthe forest swarmed with trout. I deemed it wise, however, first to wait\r\nuntil I could be sure of determining the exact points of the compass,\r\nand I also wished to determine the success or failure of my deadfall.\r\nAlthough the sun shone through the cleft in the forest formed by the\r\nstream, yet it gave me only a vague idea of direction, and while I knew\r\nby the sun that the river flowed in a more or less southerly course at\r\nthis spot, yet I wished to familiarize myself with the various compass\r\npoints and to discover some other means of distinguishing north from\r\nsouth and east from west, for I had little doubt that there would be\r\nmany days on which the sun would not shine. Accordingly, on the\r\nfollowing morning I started into the woods while the sun was yet low, to\r\nstudy and reason out any signs which would aid me in maintaining a\r\nstraight course through the forest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was well into the woods I looked about with minute care for\r\nany details which would be of use and also examined the trees very\r\ncarefully for moss and lichens, for, as I have already mentioned, I had\r\nheard that moss grew more abundantly on one side of trees than the\r\nother, but I had forgotten which side it was.\r\n\r\nNearly every tree was well covered with lichens and moss and I could not\r\nsee that these growths were any thicker on one side than the other. I\r\nwas about to abandon this scheme for determining direction when I made a\r\ndiscovery. Glancing up and down the trunks in search of the moss\r\ngrowths, I noticed that one side of every tree was dark-colored and\r\ndamp, whereas the other side was grayish and drier, and the damp side I\r\nsoon found corresponded to the north as determined by my glimpse of the\r\nsun above the river. I was quite elated by this and I now noticed that\r\nthe mosses _did_ appear heavier and more luxuriant on the damp side of\r\nthe trees than on the dry side. A further scrutiny and comparison of the\r\nvarious trees also convinced me that the branches, twigs, and leaves\r\nwere thicker and more regular on the south side of the trees than on the\r\nnorth, and that more dried and dead branches and stubs projected from\r\nthe north side of the trees than from the south side. Fixing these facts\r\nin my mind, I determined to test my discoveries by actual experiment,\r\nand without looking at the tree trunks I wandered aimlessly ahead for\r\nseveral hundred yards. Then, closing my eyes, I walked slowly about for\r\nsome time, bumping into numerous trees and tripping over fallen branches\r\nseveral times—until I felt that I had lost all sense of direction. Then,\r\nopening my eyes, I looked about. I was out of sight or sound of the\r\nriver, the only signs of sunshine were faint, bright patches amid the\r\nlofty foliage of the trees, and nothing was in view which seemed\r\nfamiliar. For a moment my heart thumped and I shuddered to think what\r\nmight happen if my signs failed and I could not find my way back to the\r\nriver. It was a dangerous experiment, the peril of which I did not fully\r\nrealize even then, but, pulling myself together, I focused my attention\r\non the trees about me. There was no question about it, scarcely a glance\r\nwas needed to show me which side of the trees faced the north and which\r\nthe south, and, knowing that the river flowed to the east of the woods\r\nwherein I stood, I turned and started to retrace my steps. Even as I did\r\nso I realized how important was my newly acquired knowledge of this\r\nfeature of woodcraft, for the direction which I had felt sure would lead\r\nme toward the river was _exactly opposite_ to that which was shown to be\r\nright by the trees.\r\n\r\nI was greatly pleased, for now I knew that in case rapids, cascades, or\r\ncliffs prevented me from following the river I could make detours\r\nthrough the forest, and, moreover, where the river turned and swung from\r\nits southerly course I could save miles of weary tramping by cutting\r\nacross through the woods.\r\n\r\nThinking of such matters and only glancing now and then at the trees to\r\nassure myself of my direction, I was suddenly aroused by a large hare or\r\nrabbit which leaped from beside a dead stump almost at my feet and\r\nscampered off among the shadows. For a moment I stood still, watching\r\nthe creature as he flashed across the open spaces and thinking\r\nregretfully what a fine supply of food was flitting beyond my reach.\r\nThen glancing down, I caught sight of a great mass of fungous growth\r\nupon the base of the stump from which the hare had jumped. The fungus\r\nwas dull orange or yellow and grew in a form resembling sponge or coral.\r\nI had often seen the same thing before and had never given it more than\r\na momentary glance, but this mass instantly riveted my attention, for\r\none side of it had been eaten away and bits of the nibbled fungus were\r\nstrewn upon the earth. This, then, was what the hare had been eating and\r\nI realized that by setting a snare or trap beside it I might be able to\r\ncapture the rabbit. There was no time like the present for attempting\r\nthe feat, and I at once set about preparing a trap. It was merely a\r\nsimple “twitch-up,” such as every farmer’s boy uses for catching\r\nrabbits, partridge, and other small creatures, and while a few days\r\nbefore it would have been beyond me, it was now simple, with my\r\nknowledge of hemlock roots and the self-reliance which I was so rapidly\r\nacquiring.\r\n\r\nCutting a number of short sticks, I pushed them into the earth about the\r\nfungus, thus inclosing it on all sides but one. On either side of the\r\nopening thus left I drove two stout stakes with notches near their upper\r\nends. From a bit of dead wood I then whittled out a spindle-shaped piece\r\njust long enough to reach from one of these stakes to the other. Then\r\nwith a fine hemlock root I formed a noose, tied the spindle to the fiber\r\njust above it, and fastened the end of the root to the tip of a small\r\nsapling close by. Bending down the latter, I slipped the spindle into\r\nthe notches in the stake, spread the noose across the opening, and my\r\nsnare was completed. I was very proud of my work, simple as it was, and\r\nwas quite confident that when the hare returned to finish his meal he\r\nwould push his head through the noose, dislodge the spindle, and would\r\nbe jerked into the air and killed by the spring of the sapling. I stood\r\nfor a moment looking at the snare and the fungus and suddenly roared\r\nwith laughter at my own stupidity. Here I had been working for nearly an\r\nhour to set a trap which might or might not catch the rabbit, and within\r\na few inches was a supply of food of far more value and to be had\r\nwithout the least effort. Surely if a rabbit could eat the fungus, so\r\ncould I, and I plucked a bit of the queer growth and tasted it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW I SET THE “TWITCH-UP” FOR THE HARES]\r\n\r\nIt had a rather musty but not unpleasant taste with a slight nutty\r\nflavor, and I judged that, cooked, it might be very palatable. The\r\nquestion of eating mushrooms had occurred to me before this, but I knew\r\nnothing as to the edible qualities of fungus except that certain species\r\nwere deadly and some nutritious, and I had not dared attempt eating\r\nthem. Now, by the merest chance, I had discovered an edible species, and\r\nwith a feeling of intense gratitude to the hare, I determined that his\r\nlife should not be forfeited to my appetite and that he should be\r\nrewarded by being spared. Without more ado I removed the snare which I\r\nhad taken so much trouble to prepare, and pocketed a large section of\r\nthe fungus. That there was an abundant supply of this growth in the\r\nforest I was confident, and as I walked toward the river I searched on\r\nevery log and stump for more. Several large masses were found, and, as\r\nmany of these had been partly devoured by small animals, I felt\r\nreassured as to the edible and nutritious qualities of the sponge-like\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I PLUCKED A BIT OF THE QUEER GROWTH AND TASTED IT”]\r\n\r\nI reached my shelter without further adventure and at once prepared to\r\ncook and sample the fungus. I was not at all sure as to the best method\r\nof cooking it, and decided to try a small quantity in various ways. I\r\ntherefore placed a lump among the hot coals to roast like a potato,\r\nwhile another lump was hung on a green stick before the fire to broil.\r\n\r\nHitherto broiling and roasting had been my sole means of cooking food,\r\nbut now, having remembered that Joe had once showed me how to boil water\r\nin birch bark, I made a rude pot of this material, placed water and\r\nfungus within, and set the whole over a bed of hot coals covered with\r\nashes. The bit of fungus to be broiled soon shriveled up and was\r\ntransformed into a leathery-like material, tasteless and useless, while\r\nthe piece roasting in the coals sputtered and sizzled, and might as well\r\nhave been a bit of pine bark at the end of a few minutes. Both of these\r\nmethods were undoubtedly failures, and I watched with some anxiety the\r\npiece boiling in the birch-bark pot. When it had boiled for some minutes\r\nI fished a bit out and, as soon as it had cooled, proceeded to taste it.\r\nMuch to my joy, it had quite lost its musty, woody flavor and was as\r\nsweet, nutty, and palatable as a boiled chestnut, and I at once drew\r\nforth all that remained in the pot and dumped in all I had left. Words\r\ncannot express the satisfaction I felt at thus having discovered a\r\nsource of vegetable food which I could gather as I traveled along and\r\nwhich would assure me a supply of provisions without the trouble and\r\nlabor of trapping animals, catching fish, or hunting frogs and mussels.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my meal of fungus was finished I arose and, taking my\r\nfrog-spear, made my way to the brook and my muskrat-trap. It was with\r\nquite a little excitement that I pushed my way through the thick growth\r\ntoward the runway where the deadfall was placed, for even with my newly\r\nacquired knowledge of edible fungus I felt that meat would be necessary,\r\nor at least welcome, during my tramp, and the success or failure of my\r\nfirst trap meant much to me. But I had no cause to worry, the deadfall\r\nhad been sprung and had served its purpose well, for projecting from\r\nbeneath the log was a furry head. Even before I reached the trap I\r\nthought it the largest muskrat I had ever seen, and as I stooped down to\r\nlift the log I uttered an involuntary cry of amazement. The creature I\r\nhad caught was no muskrat, but a great, fat beaver. Truly, my first\r\nattempt at trapping had been a huge success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nI SET FORTH ON MY JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I felt a hunter’s elation at having captured the beaver, he was\r\nreally of less value to me than a muskrat. His flesh, especially his\r\ntail, was edible, I knew, but I doubted if I would care to devour his\r\nmeat unless very hungry, for the scent and taste of castor would be too\r\nstrong. His fur, although thick, was by no means in good condition, and\r\neven if it had been “prime” it would have been of little value to me in\r\nthe forest, but, nevertheless, I foresaw that I might find use for\r\nskins, and very wisely, as it turned, decided to skin the creature and\r\ndry and preserve the hide.\r\n\r\nWhile skinning the beaver I was attracted by the strong, white tendons\r\nof his legs and tail, and, knowing how useful such tough, thread-like\r\nmaterial might prove, I carefully removed and washed the tendons and\r\nplaced them in a safe spot to dry.\r\n\r\nThe beaver’s meat looked white, clean, and tender and I decided to cook\r\nand taste some of it. The tail I also decided to cook, for I knew the\r\nIndians and trappers considered beaver tails a great delicacy. The meat\r\nwas placed to broil above the hot coals, and the tail, which seemed\r\ntough, was placed to boil in the birch-bark pot—or rather, in a fresh\r\nreceptacle—for I found that after once using the bark for boiling it was\r\nworthless and that a new dish must be provided each time I wished to\r\nboil anything.\r\n\r\nWhile the meat and tail were cooking I spread the skin of my beaver to\r\ndry and it then occurred to me that perhaps beaver flesh might be jerked\r\nor dried as well as venison. Accordingly, I cut strips from the carcass\r\nand hung them up. By the time this was done the meat was thoroughly\r\nbroiled and ready to taste. Much to my surprise, there was but a very\r\nslight musky taste to the flesh, and while it was far from delicious\r\nwithout salt or seasoning, yet it was much better than mussels, and I\r\ngreatly relished the flavor of real meat once more. The tail proved too\r\ngristly and tough to suit me and I doubt if I could have devoured it\r\nunless I were actually starving. It reminded me of pig’s feet, and I\r\nwondered how any human beings could like it. No doubt if properly\r\nprepared it might be far more palatable, but I then and there decided\r\nthat beavers’ tails would be eliminated from my menu unless I was face\r\nto face with starvation.\r\n\r\nI was not sorry to discover that beaver flesh was edible, for I knew\r\nthat where there was one beaver there were doubtless more, and that I\r\nmight reasonably expect to catch others, but unless the meat could be\r\ndried and preserved it would be of little value for my purposes. I\r\ndetermined to try to dry trout. While thinking of this my mind turned to\r\nthe matter of tackle with which to capture fish without the time and\r\nlabor of bailing out the pools—a slow method at best and only possible\r\nwhere there were deep pools or basins. With the hemlock roots I could\r\nbraid lines which I felt sure would serve my purpose, but I could not\r\nconceive of any way by which I could form a hook. I happened to notice\r\nthe carcass of the beaver and picked it up to throw it into the river,\r\nwhen I noticed the sharp, chisel-like teeth and strong bones. For a\r\nmoment I stood regarding them, turning over in my mind my various wants\r\nand striving to think of some purpose for which I could use either teeth\r\nor bones, for it seemed a pity to waste anything that might serve any\r\nuseful purpose. I thought of fish-hooks, for I had heard of certain\r\nsavage races using bone hooks, but I could not imagine a way of\r\ntransforming either teeth or bones into trout-hooks, and I was on the\r\npoint of throwing the body into the stream when bows and arrows again\r\ncame to my mind, and instantly it occurred to me that the bones of my\r\nbeaver might be sharpened and used for arrow-heads.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it was a scheme worth trying, and I promptly began to\r\ndissect out the leg bones from the remaining meat. Lest I should want\r\nother material at some future time, I also removed and set aside the\r\nhuge front teeth. This occupied a long time, and I had barely time to\r\nwalk out to the trout-brook, catch two fish, after a deal of labor, and\r\nreturn to camp ere night fell. One of the trout served for my supper and\r\nthe other was split, cleaned, and hung up to dry with the beaver meat.\r\n\r\nThe following morning I awoke to find the woods dripping and the world\r\ngray with a cold, drizzling rain. From my fire a thin, blue wisp of\r\nsmoke arose, and I hurried to replenish the fuel and save the little\r\nlife there was left in the embers. Before I could fan the coals into\r\nflame the lowering, gray sky poured forth a torrent of rain, and with a\r\nfaint hiss the last hot coals grew black and dead.\r\n\r\nSoaked through, chilled, miserable, and disgusted, I crept into my hut\r\nand, seeking a sheltered spot, sought to secure another fire with my\r\nknife, pebble, and handkerchief. What was my disappointment to find the\r\nhandkerchief damp and soggy with moisture, and while one or two spots\r\nappeared quite dry, my utmost endeavors failed to ignite the cotton\r\ncloth. For an hour or more I labored, until my hands were cut and\r\nbleeding and the back of my knife-blade was worn rough and battered, and\r\nthen, thoroughly disheartened, I gave up in despair. Hungry as I was, I\r\nhad nothing save uncooked fungus to eat, for I had not yet reached the\r\npoint where raw mussels, raw frogs, or raw fish could be considered.\r\n\r\nSitting in the partial shelter of my lean-to, I spent a dreary and\r\nforlorn morning, for while the roof was fairly tight the rain drove in\r\nat front and sides, and only in the very center of the hut could I\r\nremain fairly dry. My wet clothes clung to my skin, chilling me to the\r\nbone each time the cold wind whistled down the river, and my reflections\r\nwere far from cheering, for I knew that this was but a sample of what I\r\nmight expect. Summer was over and the autumn rains had begun, and in a\r\nfew weeks more icy winds and snow-squalls would succeed them. With a\r\nroaring fire all might have been well, and I could have laughed at the\r\nelements, but without fire I realized how helpless I was and ever\r\nuppermost in my mind was how to safeguard myself against the loss of my\r\nfire in the future, provided I again succeeded in starting a\r\nblaze—something which I considered very doubtful.\r\n\r\nToward noon, however, the rain ceased, the sky cleared, and by\r\nmid-afternoon the sun was shining brightly. I lost no time in finding a\r\nsunny stone whereon to spread my handkerchief, and as soon as the bit of\r\ncloth was dry I again essayed to ignite it with a spark from my flint.\r\nThis time I met with more success, and after several trials I obtained a\r\nblaze and soon had a roaring fire. As soon as the fire was burning well\r\nI cooked food and while this was being done busied myself in making a\r\nneat, tight box or case of birch bark in which to carry my handkerchief.\r\nI was fearful lest the cotton cloth should give out long before I\r\nreached the end of my journey, for only a small portion remained intact.\r\nTo provide against such a loss I tore bits of cloth from my shirt,\r\ncharred spots on the strips with coals from the fire, and packed these\r\ncarefully in additional birch-bark receptacles. To make doubly sure that\r\nthese were water-tight, I smeared the edges of the packages with pitch,\r\nas I had seen Joe repair rents in the canoe, and having thus provided\r\nagainst future showers as far as was possible, I sat down to my meager\r\nmeal and the world and my future took on a more roseate hue. While I was\r\nfireless during the forenoon I had determined to try a bow-drill and\r\nspindle for making fire, for I felt that if I could obtain the proper\r\nmaterials this would be a far easier and quicker way of making fire than\r\nby flint and steel, which could be reserved for emergencies.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view I entered the woods and searched diligently for\r\nmaterials for my fire-making apparatus. As I have already mentioned, I\r\nhad made fire by this crude, savage method when a boy and I knew by\r\nexperience the materials best suited to the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bow was an easy matter, for spruce was as good as anything, and this\r\ntree was abundant everywhere. While cutting the bow for fire-making I\r\nremembered my determination to attempt the manufacture of bow and arrows\r\nand I selected several likely-looking spruce boughs for this purpose. I\r\nnext looked about for a suitable stick for the drill and selected some\r\nstraight, old, dry fir roots from a tree which had been torn up and\r\nblown over by some winter’s storm years before. A piece of the dry,\r\nweathered wood from the same tree served as material from which to make\r\na fire-block, and from beneath the bark of a dead pine I secured a good\r\nsupply of “punk.” A hard pine knot was selected for a drill-socket, but\r\ndespite every endeavor I could find nothing which I was sure would serve\r\nas tinder. Shredded cedar bark I knew was as good as anything, but not a\r\ncedar could I find, and finally I decided to try the thin, papery, dried\r\nbirch bark which flaked in little curling rolls from the trees. Armed\r\nwith these various things, I returned to my lean-to and was soon busily\r\npreparing the materials for use. The flexible, springy spruce limb was\r\nwhittled down to a rude bow, and not until then did I remember that all\r\nmy youthful attempts at thus making fire had proved failures until I\r\nused a leather bowstring. For a moment I was nonplussed, for leather was\r\nout of the question, until I thought of my shoe-laces. One of these was\r\nsacrificed and replaced by hemlock roots, and I then whittled down a fir\r\nroot into a double-pointed, octagonal spindle about fifteen inches long.\r\nWith the tip of my knife-blade I dug out a recess in the pine knot and\r\nwhittled the outside to fit easily in my hand and then turned my\r\nattention to the fire-block. A piece of the dry, seasoned fir was split\r\ninto a little slab about three-fourths of an inch thick with notches cut\r\nalong one edge, and I was ready for my experiment at fire-making.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY FIRE-MAKING APPARATUS]\r\n\r\nUpon a smooth, dry stone I placed a piece of the dry pine punk, with\r\nanother piece close at hand. Next I set the fire-block upon the piece of\r\npine and with the bowstring took a turn about the center of the drill.\r\nSetting one end of the drill in a notch of the fire-block, I placed the\r\ndrill-socket, made from the knot, upon the other end of the drill, and\r\nsteadying the fire-block with my foot I pressed firmly down upon the\r\nsocket with my left hand and drew the bow back and forth with my right\r\nhand. With even, steady strokes I whirled the drill around and around,\r\nand presently a little mound of brownish, powdery sawdust began to\r\naccumulate on the punk beneath the fire-block. Gradually the pile\r\nincreased, the hole made by the drill in the block grew larger and\r\nlarger, and a faint smell of scorching wood greeted my nostrils. Harder\r\nand harder I pressed down on the socket, faster and faster I twirled the\r\ndrill, and an instant later the sawdust turned black and a slender\r\ncolumn of smoke rose from it. Dropping drill and bow, I stooped and blew\r\ngently on the smoldering powder, and as the smoke increased I lifted the\r\nfire-block from the punk beneath, slipped a few bits of the papery birch\r\nbark into the powder, clapped the second pine punk on top of all, and,\r\nseizing the whole in my hand, waved it swiftly back and forth. Hardly\r\nhad I swept it through the air when the bark burst into flame, and,\r\nknowing success was mine, I danced and capered about, as pleased as the\r\nfirst time I had accomplished the feat, years before. The tinder, punk,\r\nfire-block, and socket were inclosed in birch-bark packages, the drill\r\nand bow were laid carefully in the roof of my hut, and I felt sure that\r\nI would be able at any time to secure a fire in dry weather and, unless\r\nsoaked with rain, that I could be reasonably sure of kindling a flame\r\neven in wet weather—for I now had two distinct methods of obtaining\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WITH STEADY STROKES I WHIRLED THE DRILL AROUND AND\r\nAROUND”]\r\n\r\nMy fire-making apparatus was such a success that I was anxious to go\r\nahead with my bow and arrows, and I spent a long time scraping and\r\nwhittling down the best of my spruce branches to form a bow. The ones I\r\nhad selected were dead, seasoned limbs, for I well knew that green wood\r\nwould warp and would have a very limited spring. At last one of the\r\nboughs was fashioned to suit me and I looked about for a bowstring.\r\nHemlock roots seemed the only available material and a long time was\r\nspent in braiding enough of the fine roots together to form a string for\r\nthe bow. Eager to try the new weapon, I cut a notch in one end of a\r\nfairly straight stick, placed it on the string, and drew the bow. As I\r\nreleased the string the bow sprang straight with a delightful “twang,”\r\nand the stick went humming through the air, but with a loud snap the\r\nstring parted. I was so greatly pleased at the strength and elasticity\r\nof my bow that the mere matter of the parted string troubled me very\r\nlittle, for I felt confident I could make some sort of a cord which\r\nwould be strong enough for the purpose and I dropped my bow and hurried\r\ninto the woods to search for suitable sticks from which to make arrows.\r\nSticks there were in plenty, but, although I sought everywhere, I was\r\nunable to find one which was really straight and smooth. Cutting the\r\nbest I could find, in the hope that I might be able to whittle them into\r\npresentable shape, I made my way back to camp.\r\n\r\nI was exceedingly hungry, and with my mind on food I examined the beaver\r\nmeat and fish which I had hung up.\r\n\r\nIt was an ill-smelling mess, and without more ado I cast it into the\r\nriver and dined on mussels and fungus, for I was too tired to attempt a\r\ntrip to my frog-pond or the brook. The next morning, however, I visited\r\nthe brook and my deadfall, but the latter was empty, although sprung,\r\nand I failed to secure a single trout. The reason was simple. The brook\r\nhad been so swollen by the recent rains that it was impossible to dam up\r\nany of the pools, while the pond was filled to overflowing and only one\r\nsmall frog could be found by dint of the most careful search. Despite my\r\nill luck, however, I returned to camp quite elated, for while making my\r\nway about the little pond in search of frogs I had discovered some thick\r\nbushes with reddish stems so straight, smooth, and polished that they at\r\nonce struck me as being perfectly adapted for arrows. Not until long\r\nafterward did I learn that this bush was known as “arrow wood” and that\r\nthe Indians formerly used it for their arrows.\r\n\r\nWith a supply of this useful bush I busied myself at arrow-making, for\r\nalthough I had no feathers I thought that I might be able to make arrows\r\nwhich would serve to kill the tame and unsuspicious birds and animals,\r\nand I had but to kill one large bird in order to obtain feathers to make\r\nbetter arrows. Several times I had seen partridges or grouse, and on one\r\nor two occasions I had attempted to snare them by means of a\r\nhemlock-root noose on the end of a light pole, but the material was too\r\ncoarse for the purpose and the birds invariably avoided the snare. Once\r\nor twice I had attempted to kill them with stones or clubs, and once I\r\nhad even thrown my spear at them, but in every instance they had\r\nescaped. Perhaps it was the season, perhaps the birds were suspicious of\r\nthe first man they had seen, but whatever the reason, the fact remains\r\nthat they were far wiser and more wary than the grouse I had often seen\r\nwhen hunting in Joe’s company.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple matter to cut notches in one end of each arrow, but it\r\nwas a far more difficult job to fit heads. The beaver’s bones were the\r\nonly material I had for this purpose and I found it hard work indeed to\r\ncut and sharpen these into any semblance of an arrow-head. Indeed, I\r\nfound it so difficult that I even sought to chip arrow-heads from the\r\npebbles of the river, but I had not the remotest idea how stone\r\narrow-heads were made and my efforts in this direction resulted only in\r\nbruised fingers and irregular, broken stones of no earthly use for my\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBy dint of hard work and the expenditure of many hours I finally cut and\r\nground down some bones until they had sharp points at one end and a\r\nrecess at the other, and to these I bound my arrow sticks with the\r\nsinews taken from the beaver. I still had a bowstring to make, and as I\r\nworked away at the bones I busied my mind trying to invent some sort of\r\ncord which would stand the strain of the bow. I thought of the tendons\r\nof the beaver, but these were neither long enough to serve the purpose\r\nnor were there enough to braid together to form a string, and I was at\r\nlast compelled to fall back upon hemlock roots. An examination of the\r\nbroken bowstring revealed the fact that it had parted at the knot at one\r\nend, and to avoid this I decided to braid or lash a loop in the new\r\nstring. I made this new cord much heavier than the old, selected the\r\nfibers with greater care, and smeared the whole with pitch. The loops at\r\nthe ends were twisted in and lashed in place with tendons, and when all\r\nwas done I drew the bow with some trepidation for fear all my hard labor\r\nwould be wasted. Much to my satisfaction, the string withstood the\r\nstrain and I practised until dark with straight sticks which had bits of\r\nstone gummed on with pitch for heads, and I found that up to twenty feet\r\nI could frequently hit a mark the size of a partridge.\r\n\r\nAnxious to test my weapons on real game, I arose early the following\r\nmorning and entered the woods in search of partridge. I soon flushed a\r\nflock of grouse from among the young fir-trees, and as they perched upon\r\nthe branches and craned their heads to view the intruder I approached\r\nclosely, placed an arrow on the string, drew the bow, and let drive. I\r\ndoubt if I was a dozen feet distant from the birds and they were packed\r\nso closely together on the branch that I could scarcely have missed\r\nthem, but when the bone-tipped stick struck one of the grouse in the\r\nbreast and with a great flapping he came tumbling to earth, I felt as if\r\nI was the most marvelous archer in the world. As the partridge fell the\r\nothers took wing and whirred out of sight, but I paid little attention\r\nto them and hurried to pick up my first feathered game. The arrow was\r\nstill sticking in the bird’s flesh, although the stick had been broken\r\nin his fall, but the head was the only valuable portion, and I hurried\r\nback to my fire, happy in the thought that I now had a weapon with which\r\nI could actually kill game.\r\n\r\nThe wing-feathers of the grouse were carefully saved, and after I had\r\ndined from the delicate meat and had picked every bone clean I devoted\r\nall the rest of the day to feathering and pointing my arrows. How to\r\ncarry them was the next question, and here the beaver skin came into\r\nmind. I was learning rapidly to think out and to find ways and means,\r\nand was acquiring a store of useful knowledge, and I smiled to myself as\r\nI thought how far better equipped I was to make my journey out of the\r\nwoods now than I would have been when first I scrambled out of the river\r\nnot so many days before.\r\n\r\nThe beaver’s skin furnished an excellent quiver, or case, for my bow and\r\narrows, with plenty of room for a supply of mussels and fungus, and my\r\nfire-bow and drill in addition, and as there was nothing more to detain\r\nme here I decided to start on my tramp the next morning.\r\n\r\nI ate a plentiful breakfast of fungus and mussels, and then, with the\r\nskin filled with my possessions on my back, with pockets bulging with\r\nhemlock roots, tendons, bones, and flint, and with a number of mussels\r\nand some fungi tied in a bundle in one hand, and my frog-spear in the\r\nother, I set out on my long tramp. As I reached a bend of the river and\r\nglanced back for a last look at the little lean-to beside the river, I\r\nfelt as if I was leaving home. The wilderness had been kind to me and I\r\nhad fared far better than I had dared hope in this spot. As I turned\r\nagain toward the south and picked my way along the river-bank, little\r\ndid I dream what fate had in store for me or how many dreary months\r\nwould pass ere I reached my goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nI GO A-FISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day long I tramped onward, following the course of the river, but\r\nfrequently entering the woods and trudging through the forest for\r\nseveral miles to avoid impassable portions of the river-bank. Quite\r\nfrequently the shores rose in steep, rocky bluffs, between which the\r\ntorrent roared and foamed, while at other times fallen trees, driftwood,\r\nand logs made progress along the shore impossible. Many a time that\r\nfirst day of my journey did I have cause for thankfulness that had taken\r\nthe precaution to learn means for determining the points of the compass,\r\nfor the knowledge saved me many a weary mile.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon I made camp at a little cove where the river cut\r\ninto the woods and where a crystal brook babbled through a fern-grown\r\nravine and gave promise of trout and frogs. My first work was to build a\r\ntiny lean-to, and in doing this I saved myself a deal of labor by using\r\ndead and fallen branches for the timbers of my shelter instead of\r\ncutting them from living trees. I soon started a fire, and then walked\r\nup the brook in a search of game. I had expected to find a few frogs or\r\nperhaps to obtain some trout, but presently a flock of grouse whirred up\r\nfrom the ferns and alighted on a low spruce a few yards away. It took me\r\nbut an instant to fit an arrow to my bow and to let it fly at one of the\r\nbirds. I made a clean miss and, rather chagrined, I tried again. Once\r\nmore I missed, but the stupid birds remained motionless and not at all\r\nfrightened by the passing arrows. As I watched them and wondered if it\r\nwould be possible to approach more closely I remembered the beaver\r\nsinews and determined to attempt snaring the grouse. Rapidly forming a\r\nnoose with one of the fine tendons, I attached it to the butt of my\r\nfrog-spear and cautiously crept toward the unsuspecting birds. When\r\nwithin reach I slowly pushed the pole forward, and although the grouse\r\ncraned their necks, moved about a little, and showed some nervousness,\r\nthey remained upon their perches, and an instant later the noose was\r\nslipped over the head of the lowest and with a quick jerk I brought him\r\nfluttering to the ground. Even then the other birds did not take flight,\r\nand three fine grouse were mine ere the others realized their danger and\r\nwinged their way to safer quarters. I was greatly elated at my success\r\nand dined royally on partridge, and had enough left over for my food for\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAs I sat by my fire that evening I thought over my life since the day\r\nwhen I was cast into the river, and, much to my surprise, I found it\r\ndifficult to fix the days and the sequence of events in my mind. Then\r\nfor the first time I realized that if I was to keep account of time I\r\nmust devise some means of recording the days.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to cut notches in a stick, one for each day, but I at\r\nonce gave this up as impracticable, for I foresaw that the numerous\r\nnotches representing the days I had already passed in the woods would\r\nprove confusing, and that this method would merely enable me to tell how\r\nmany days had passed and would fail to give me an idea of the day of the\r\nweek or the month. Moreover, to carry sticks for this purpose would be a\r\nnuisance, and after some time I decided to make a rude calendar by means\r\nof beaver tendons. My scheme was very simple and consisted of using two\r\ntendons, one for the week-days and the other for the months. Each day I\r\nwould tie a knot in the week string and when the seventh day was reached\r\nI would tie a large knot. Then when the days made up a month I would tie\r\na knot in the month string. To think was to act, and selecting a smooth,\r\nlong tendon I tied knots to represent the seven days I had already been\r\nin the forest, with the last knot double the size of the others, and as\r\nthe canoe had been wrecked on Wednesday, the 2d of August, I tied nine\r\nknots in my month string, which gave Wednesday as the day of the week\r\nand the ninth day of the month as the correct date. I could easily\r\nremember the month itself and I had not the least expectation of being\r\nin the wilderness long enough to require a means of keeping track of\r\nfuture months, but as it turned out, many a month string was tied into\r\nknots ere I came to my journey’s end.\r\n\r\nFor several days I tramped onward without adventure or incident, save\r\nthat I fared ill for meat and was obliged to depend almost entirely upon\r\nthe mussels in the river and the fungus in the woods. Over and over\r\nagain I gave thanks to the rabbit which had first led me to this supply\r\nof food, for without the fungus I would have gone to bed hungry on many\r\na night. Several times I saw hares and once or twice I flushed\r\npartridges. I repeatedly tried to kill these creatures with my bow and\r\narrows, but I failed each time. Moreover, the grouse seemed wild and\r\nsuspicious and I could not approach closely enough to snare them, while\r\nthe brooks I passed, although alive with trout, had no deep pools or\r\nisolated basins which I could bail out to secure the fish. Anxious as I\r\nwas to get out of the woods without delay, my longing for better food\r\nfinally overcame my impatience and I decided to make a halt for a day\r\nand endeavor to trap or snare some sort of game.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I made camp at midday and spent the afternoon preparing\r\ntwitch-ups and deadfalls. It was while setting one of the latter that an\r\naccident gave me an idea which proved of the utmost value and made my\r\nlot far easier. Bending over and endeavoring to lift a log, my belt\r\nparted, and to my chagrin I discovered that the stitches which held the\r\nbuckle had ripped out. Holding it in my hand and thinking of a way of\r\nlashing it to the leather again, it suddenly occurred to me that in this\r\nbit of metal I had the means of fashioning a fish-hook. The buckle was a\r\nfairly large one, with a strong, sharp tongue, and one end of this was\r\nalready formed in an eye. All that was necessary was to detach the\r\ntongue from the buckle-frame and bend it into a hooked form. Instantly\r\nthe deadfall was forgotten and I set to work hammering the buckle with\r\nstones and bending it back and forth in order to remove the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe amount of labor which was required to accomplish this simple matter\r\nis almost incredible. My fingers were bruised and torn, my hands were\r\ncramped, and my arms ached ere the buckle-frame finally parted and the\r\ntongue was free. Even more difficult was the task of bending this, for\r\nmy only tools were the water-worn pebbles. Time and again the bit of\r\nmetal slipped and I yelled with pain as my crude stone hammer struck my\r\nfingertips. At last I hit upon the plan of heating it and placed the\r\ntongue amid the hot coals of my fire. While it was heating I cudgeled my\r\nbrains to devise some method of holding the hot metal while bending it,\r\nand at last hit upon what I considered a very clever scheme indeed. With\r\nmy knife I cut a notch in a piece of green wood and in the center of\r\nthis dug out, with great labor, a little depression at right angles to\r\nthe notch. The metal was now red-hot, and, carefully lifting it with a\r\ngreen stick, I laid it in the notch with its center above the hollow.\r\nThen a chip of stone, which I had already selected, was placed against\r\nthe steel and with a rock as a hammer I drove down upon the metal until\r\nit bent into the recess below and took its shape. The steel bent so\r\nreadily when hot and the whole operation was so simple that I mentally\r\ncalled myself a fool for spending so much time and mashing my fingers\r\ntrying to bend the metal when cold by means of stones. As soon as the\r\nbuckle-tongue was bent I threw water upon it to cool it and examined the\r\nresult of my ingenuity with the greatest pride. Undoubtedly it was a\r\nhook, but doubts assailed me as to its value for catching fish, for it\r\nwas large, coarse, and clumsy and was scarcely better than an enormous\r\nbent pin. However, I had seen trout caught with bent pins and the only\r\nway to prove whether or not my trouble had been for naught was to test\r\nthe hook. It required but a short time to gather a quantity of fine\r\nroots and tie these together in a line, but I found it a hard matter to\r\nsecure a root fine and strong enough to pass through the eye of my hook,\r\nwhich had been squeezed out of shape while bending it. Again the useful\r\nbeaver tendons came into mind and with one of these I readily attached\r\nthe crude hook to my line. Equipped with this primitive tackle and with\r\nworms, which I found beneath stones, for bait, I hurried to the\r\nneighboring stream and dropped the baited hook into a shaded, deep pool\r\namong the rocks. Hardly had the hook touched water before a silvery body\r\nflashed, and by the sharp, hard tug on the line I knew I had hooked a\r\ntrout. Fearful lest my captive should slip from the barbless hook, and\r\ntingling with excitement, I pulled in the line; but I was doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Scarcely had his flashing body reached the surface of\r\nthe water when, with a flap of his tail, the trout leaped into the air,\r\nshook himself free, and dropped back into the pool while I stood gazing\r\nstupidly at the empty hook dangling at the end of the line. I was filled\r\nwith bitter disappointment, for I had been confident that the fish was\r\nfirmly hooked, and for several moments I could not overcome my chagrin\r\nat the loss of the fine trout. However, I had learned patience and\r\nperseverance, and, again baiting the hook, I tried my luck once more.\r\nAgain came the sharp tug at the line as a fish took the bait, and this\r\ntime, instead of pulling slowly on the line, I gave a quick, hard jerk\r\nand to my intense joy saw the flashing trout flung from the pool and\r\nlanded safely upon the mossy bank. Now that I had learned the trick, I\r\nfound little difficulty in securing several more trout, and while one\r\nout of every two or three managed to escape, yet I had plenty of fish\r\nfor my meal by the time I had stopped. With a supply of trout thus\r\nassured, I had no need to worry over my food in the future, but I was\r\nterribly afraid of breaking my line and losing the precious hook, and to\r\navoid all chance of this I spent the remaining hours of daylight in\r\ncarefully braiding a better line from fine, selected hemlock roots.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were so fully occupied with fishing that I almost forgot\r\nabout the traps and snares I had set, and I was on the point of again\r\nsetting out on my tramp when I remembered them. One deadfall had been\r\nsprung and contained a tiny ground-squirrel, but a skunk or fisher-cat\r\nhad visited it before me and only a few bones and a little fur of the\r\nchipmunk remained in the trap. My twitch-ups were far more successful\r\nand in one I found a fine, fat hare and in another a red squirrel.\r\n\r\nThese I decided to use for my midday meal, and, well pleased with my\r\nprowess as a trapper and fisherman, I continued on my way.\r\n\r\nFor some time I made good progress, but soon the country grew rough and\r\nmore mountainous, while the river flowed for long distances between\r\nrocky, precipitous banks which compelled me to make my way through the\r\nforest. Here it was also difficult traveling, for fallen trees were\r\nscattered everywhere, the ground was rocky and full of holes and clefts,\r\nand I was compelled to go far out of my way in order to avoid such\r\nobstructions. So hard was the way that I longed again to be able to\r\nfollow the shores of the river and made frequent trips to the edge of\r\nthe bank, hoping each time to find the bluffs were passed and that I\r\ncould again travel in the open beside the stream. On one such occasion I\r\nwas standing at the verge of a high, steep bank with the river tumbling\r\nand roaring in masses of foam among the jagged rocks far below. Suddenly\r\nI felt the earth give way beneath me and with a cry of terror I clutched\r\nfrantically at the bushes about me. With a roar and rumble a great slice\r\nof the bank fell crashing down to the river. The branch which I had\r\nseized snapped, I felt myself slipping to certain death, and the next\r\ninstant found myself poised in midair above the precipice. Although the\r\nbranch had snapped off, it still supported me, and, sick with fear and\r\nwith pounding heart, I drew myself, hand over hand, up the edge of the\r\nbank and fell panting on the earth.\r\n\r\nTerribly shaken and helplessly weak from the shock, I lay trembling upon\r\nthe ground, for I had missed death, or terrible injuries, by a hair’s\r\nbreadth. I had been saved as by a miracle, and I breathed a prayer of\r\nthanks that Providence had guided my hand to grasp a branch which was\r\nstrong enough to withstand the terrific strain of my falling body. Then,\r\nhaving in a measure regained my breath and self-control, and curious to\r\nsee the sapling which had saved my life, I rose unsteadily to my feet\r\nand cautiously approached the precipitous bank. Lying prone on my\r\nstomach, I peered over the edge and a wave of faintness swept over me as\r\nI gazed down a the tumbling rapids and jagged black rock at the foot of\r\nthe sheer decline. Close at hand was the slender growth which had proved\r\nmy salvation; bent, bruised, and drooping from my struggles, but still\r\nintact. It was scarcely as large as my finger. Filled with amazement\r\nthat such a tiny bush could have supported me, I examined it with minute\r\ncare. The wood was cracked and broken in a dozen spots, the bark was\r\nsplit and separated from the wood, but it was still as tough as a\r\nleathern thong, flexible as whalebone, and fibrous as a rope. Carefully\r\ncutting the branch, I withdrew to a point of safety to investigate its\r\nmarvelous strength. Twist it, bend it, or pull it as I would, I could\r\nmake no impression upon it, and it came at once to my mind that here,\r\nindeed, was a natural rope of immense strength and which would be of\r\ninestimable value to me. I also discovered that the strength was all in\r\nthe bark, and by stripping off slender pieces I found that with them I\r\ncould form cords, threads, and lines equal to hempen strands. Once again\r\nan accident had led to a valuable discovery, and as the shrub was\r\nabundant everywhere along the river’s bank I knew that I now possessed\r\nan inexhaustible supply of lines and ropes which I could use for\r\nnumberless purposes. Not till long afterward did I learn that this was\r\n“moosewood”; that its properties were known to every woodsman, hunter,\r\nand trapper of the wilderness, and that to the Indians it served every\r\npurpose of string and rope and was in constant use a thousand and one\r\nways. I was still so upset by my terrible experience that I abandoned\r\nany idea of proceeding farther that day, and made camp a short distance\r\naway beside a little mountain stream. Fascinated by the tough and\r\nflexible character of the moosewood bark, I spent hours braiding and\r\ntwisting it into cords of various sizes, and it was so far superior to\r\nthe hemlock root that I made a new and better bowstring and a new\r\nfish-line from the material.\r\n\r\nThen having secured a good rest and having quite recovered from my\r\nfright and shock I tried my hand at fishing. It took me but a short time\r\nto catch a number of trout, as they were abundant in the brook and I had\r\nnow learned the knack of jerking them from the water so quickly that\r\nthey could not flap loose from the hook. The next morning I resumed my\r\ntramp and for five days walk steadily onward without any incident worth\r\nof record.\r\n\r\nWith every mile the river increased in width, sand-bars and rocky islets\r\nrose in its midst, the current became less swift, and by the sixth day\r\nthe stream stretched in a broad, sluggish expanse of silver a quarter of\r\na mile wide.\r\n\r\nLate in the forenoon of the seventh day I toiled up the slope of a low\r\nridge and amid the tree trunks on its summit I saw the bright sky\r\nglimmering through the forest ahead. My heart leaped with joy at the\r\nsight, for I knew that the wilderness must be nearly at an end, that\r\nopen country must be just beyond, and that my journey must be nearly\r\nover. Tired as I was, I hurried onward, thrilled to think that my tramp\r\nwould soon be finished, that but a few hundred yards more and I would\r\nbreak from the woods and look upon open fields, a clearing, or some\r\nsimilar scene of the outposts of civilization, and that ere nightfall I\r\nwould be talking with my fellow-men. Forgetting my weary, blistered\r\nfeet, forgetting that my clothes were torn and ragged, forgetting the\r\nhardships I had suffered, I pushed rapidly forward, my eyes fixed upon\r\nthe sunlit sky among the trees to the south, and all unmindful of the\r\nfallen branches, the thick underbrush, and the brambles that beset my\r\npath. Already the character of the woods had changed. Among the somber\r\nevergreens deciduous trees grew thickly; open, brush-filled glades were\r\nhere and there; patches of blueberry-bushes grew in the hollows beneath\r\nthe trees, and on every hand were indications that I was approaching the\r\nverge of the forest. A few moments more and between the tree trunks I\r\ncaught a glimpse of light, broken by breeze-swayed golden leaves, and\r\nwith a glad cry I broke into a run and dashed forward. I crashed through\r\nthe last small growth, burst forth into glorious sun-filled, open air,\r\nand the next instant sank, exhausted and bitterly disappointed, to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nI MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI had expected to see tilled fields, shingled houses, perhaps a distant\r\nvillage or at least a clearing, with blackened stumps, a tiny shack, or\r\nrude buildings marking the outposts of the settlements. Instead, I found\r\nmyself upon the banks of a great lake, the wooded shores unbroken by\r\nclearing, field, or house as far as eye could reach. A lake of the\r\nwilderness, silent, bathed in a vast solitude, and with naught but the\r\nforest-clad hills reflected on its placid blue bosom. Far out upon its\r\nsurface a solitary loon swam slowly, a tiny ripple marking his wake, and\r\nfrom his throat came a peal of weird, maniacal laughter.\r\n\r\nEchoing from the hills, multiplied a thousandfold, from every direction\r\nthe sounds poured forth, as though the woods were filled with demons,\r\nmocking my disappointment and my plight.\r\n\r\nA half-hour previously I had been filled with happiness and elation at\r\nthe thought that my journey was over. Now I was cast down, discouraged,\r\nand ready to give up, for I realized that to cross the lake was\r\nimpossible and that for miles and miles I must push through the forest\r\naround its shores ere I could hope to proceed on my southerly course.\r\nDimly I remembered that Joe had spoken of a lake and no doubt this was\r\nthe very one he had in mind, but whether the settlements were to the\r\nsouth, east, or west I knew not. With wistful, weary eyes I gazed across\r\nthe broad, blue expanse of waters, and the forests beyond seemed vast\r\nindeed, and to penetrate them and find my way to civilization through\r\ntheir labyrinths seemed a hopeless, endless task.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, a measure of common sense returned to me, and I\r\nrealized that I was terribly hungry and that here was as good a place as\r\nany in which to camp. No doubt the lake teemed with fish, and presently\r\nI had baited my hook and had cast the line into deep water from a\r\njutting ledge. Scarcely had the hook descended when it was seized and a\r\nmoment later a large salmon-trout was floundering about among the ferns\r\nbehind me. Three of the great fellows were landed, and, well satisfied\r\nwith my success, I soon had one broiling over my fire. After my meal I\r\nfelt far better and gradually my first disappointment wore away and I\r\nbegan to plan for the future. If I was compelled to walk about the lake\r\nI would not want for food, at any rate, and, moreover, I thought,\r\ntraveling along the shore would be far easier than tramping through the\r\nwoods or clambering among the boulders and up and down the high banks of\r\nthe river. By the time the setting sun painted the lake with crimson and\r\ngold and the distant forests turned purple and blue in the fading light\r\nI was again cheerful and went to sleep upon a bed of fragrant fir in a\r\nlean-to, fully expecting to resume my way upon the morrow.\r\n\r\nTraveling along the shore of the lake was by no means as easy as I had\r\nanticipated, for dense brush and a tangle of brambles grew close to the\r\nwater’s edge in many places and here and there deep alder swamps\r\ncompelled me to make long detours. But in the swamps I found frogs,\r\nwhich gave me a change of diet, and I managed to capture a fine, big\r\nturtle that was sunning himself on a log on the lake’s shore. Two days\r\nof weary tramping brought me to the western end of the lake and once\r\nmore I became utterly discouraged as I saw that my efforts had been in\r\nvain. The outlet of the lake was a broad, swiftly flowing river which\r\nbarred me from the farther shore as effectually as the lake itself. My\r\ncase seemed hopeless indeed, for the river, where it emptied into the\r\nlake, was, I knew, fully as wide and impassable as the outlet, and I\r\ncould see no way of reaching the country to the south save by retracing\r\nmy steps for miles, crossing the river where it was narrow, and then\r\nfollowing down its other bank. The very thought of this made me sick at\r\nheart, for it meant over a week’s steady walking through the forest.\r\nMoreover, my shoes—light, rubber-soled affairs which I had donned only\r\nto wear in the canoe—were almost worn out, my clothes were in rags and\r\ntatters, and my flesh was scratched, bruised, and torn by brambles,\r\nbrush, and stones. My coat, flannel shirt, hat, corduroy trousers, and\r\nheavy boots had all gone down with the canoe and I had been compelled to\r\njourney through the forest and endure all my hardships in light\r\ntennis-shoes and with only a white cotton shirt and a pair of thin\r\nworsted trousers for my costume.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had satisfied my most pressing needs, which were food, fire,\r\nand shelter, yet I had suffered a great deal from exposure, the bites of\r\nblack flies and mosquitoes, and the scratches of brush and brambles.\r\nHitherto my mind had been so filled with more important matters that I\r\nhad paid little heed to these discomforts, yet now my sufferings came\r\nback to me and I could scarce bring myself to think of again facing the\r\nlong journey necessary to carry me back to a spot where I could ford the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nTo add to my misery it commenced to rain and I was forced to build a\r\nlean-to and a fire and to camp where I was by the outlet of the lake. It\r\nwas no drizzle, such as I had experienced hitherto, but a torrential\r\ndownpour, the water falling in perfect sheets and at times completely\r\nblotting the farther shores from my view. Within a few hours the river\r\nwas a foaming torrent and the waters of the lake had risen perceptibly.\r\nHuddling in the shelter of my rude hut and striving to keep warm in the\r\nglow from my fire, I gazed upon the gray, wind-lashed lake and the\r\ndripping, sodden shores, feeling unutterably miserable. Near my camp a\r\nlarge log was stranded on the beach and idly I watched it as the waters\r\ncrept higher and higher, and I began to wonder if the lake might not\r\nrise to the spot whereon I had made my lean-to. I was pondering on this\r\nand had almost decided to brave the elements and make another shelter on\r\nhigher ground when a sudden gust of wind whipped the water into\r\nfoam-capped waves and with a final lurch the log slipped from the shore\r\nand floated, bobbing up and down, on the surface of the lake. A moment\r\nlater it had felt the suction of the current and, lurching and rolling,\r\nwas drawn rapidly toward the river. It was a small matter, but it was of\r\nthe greatest importance to me, as it pointed a way by which I might\r\nescape from the wilderness.\r\n\r\nFor the first time it now occurred to me that by means of a few logs I\r\ncould build a raft and cross the lake as soon as the storm passed and\r\nthe waters were again calm and peaceful.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to gather together logs which had been cast on the\r\nbeach, float them in shallow water to a spot near my camp, and then bind\r\nthem together with moosewood bark, vines, and roots until I had formed a\r\nraft which would support my weight. Accordingly, I set forth on the\r\nfollowing morning to gather my logs together, but I soon found that my\r\nscheme was worthless, for the high water and wind had carried off any\r\nstranded logs and trees which were buoyant enough to float, and during\r\nthe entire forenoon I did not succeed in finding a single log which\r\nwould serve my purpose. At one spot, however, I discovered a number of\r\ndead trees lying on the bank well away from the shore, and I decided\r\nthat if these could be rolled or pulled to the lake they would serve\r\nexcellently. It seemed an easy matter to accomplish, but the very first\r\nlog which I selected proved how futile were my efforts. The fallen tree\r\nwas some twenty feet in length and over eight inches in diameter at the\r\nlargest part, and while its weight was not so tremendous, yet its length\r\nand the numerous stubs of branches which projected from it prevented me\r\nfrom making the least headway. After hours of back-breaking toil I\r\nsucceeded in prying it up and in placing small limbs beneath it, but\r\ndespite every effort I was utterly unable to force the log sideways or\r\nendways or to roll it along. Finally exhausted, hungry, and discouraged,\r\nI gave up in despair and made my way to my fire to cook my meal. The\r\nfire had been built near a good-sized tree and as I approached my camp I\r\ndiscovered that the flames had spread to the tree, had eaten their way\r\nthrough the trunk, and that it had fallen upon my lean-to, which was a\r\nbroken, flattened mass of twigs and branches. It was a small loss, but I\r\nwas thankful that I had not been within the shelter when the tree came\r\ncrashing down upon it. The next instant I gave a shout of joy, for the\r\nfire had shown me a way to solve my difficulties with the logs. Dolt\r\nthat I was not to have thought of it before. I could cut the logs into\r\neasily handled lengths by means of fire, and for that matter could fell\r\nstanding trees by the same means, more easily, if more slowly, than by\r\nan ax.\r\n\r\nThe tree which had been accidentally cut down was scarcely six inches\r\nthrough, but it was a green, live tree and I realized that much larger\r\ndead trees could be cut in less time, and as soon as I had eaten I\r\ngathered up a firebrand and started toward the logs on which I had\r\nlabored so strenuously and with such poor success. Placing a pile of dry\r\ntwigs and branches under a log, I soon had them ablaze and threw more\r\ndry sticks around and over the trunk. Very soon the dry wood of the tree\r\nhad caught fire and was burning merrily, but, much to my chagrin, I\r\nfound that the flames were spreading along the surface of the log,\r\nfanned by the breeze from the lake. For a moment I was in a quandary to\r\nprevent the entire log from being consumed before it was cut through.\r\nThen, gathering up handfuls of the soft, damp earth and moss, I\r\nplastered it over the surface of the log on either side of the fire. Had\r\nI possessed a birch-bark dipper I could easily have thrown water upon\r\nit, but I had not used a birch-bark dish for days and had no time in\r\nwhich to fashion one at the moment. The wet earth checked the spread of\r\nthe flames, and as fast as the heat dried it off I threw on more, and\r\nwithin an hour the log cracked, sagged, and a moment later broke in two.\r\nMy experiment was a success, and, quickly raking away the fire, I\r\nstarted it in another place. All through the afternoon I worked and\r\nbefore nightfall had six lengths of smooth, dry logs cut and ready to\r\nroll to the lake. They were all free from projecting branches and stubs,\r\nwhich I had also burned off. My eyes were smarting with smoke, my skin\r\nwas scorched, and my hands black with muck and grime, and I was\r\ninexpressibly tired, but I was supremely happy, for I felt that the\r\nworst of my labors were over and that within a couple of days I would be\r\npaddling across the lake toward the southern shore.\r\n\r\nA bath in the lake did much to refresh me, for although the water was\r\nicy cold, it served to relieve my numerous burns and the irritation of\r\nmy eyes, and the next morning I felt well able to resume my work of\r\ngetting the logs to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to pry up the short, eight-foot lengths and to\r\nplace branches beneath them, and at the end of an hour I saw the first\r\nlog slip down the bank to the shore and splash into the water. I fairly\r\ncheered as the piece of trunk floated within a few feet of the beach and\r\nI felt as much elated and as proud as though I had launched a ship.\r\nHastily dragging it to the shore, I secured it to the bushes and climbed\r\nup the bank to attack a second log.\r\n\r\nExperience had taught me much and I found far less work in prying up and\r\nsliding this log than I had expended on the first. In a short time I had\r\nit beside its fellow on the beach, and when I at last ceased my labors\r\nto prepare my midday meal only two logs remained upon the bank.\r\n\r\nI was very tired, for I had worked ceaselessly since early morning, but\r\nI had accomplished a great deal and felt that I had earned a few hours’\r\nrest. It was a pleasant afternoon, warm and balmy, with a soft, blue\r\nhaze half-veiling the distant woods and hills, and had I possessed the\r\nnecessities of life and a canoe I would have been glad to spend many\r\ndays camping on the borders of the lovely forest lake. As I rested,\r\nlying upon the mossy bank and gazing off across the sparkling water, I\r\nwas attracted by a slight rustle near at hand, and, turning my head, saw\r\na graceful deer step forth from the ferns. For a moment the splendid\r\ncreature stood, suspiciously sniffing the air, and then, scenting no\r\ndanger, trotted to the water’s edge and plunged into the lake.\r\n\r\nStraight toward the opposite side he swam, his antlers, ears, and nose\r\nalone showing above the rippling surface of the water, and a long,\r\nsilvery wake trailing behind him. How I envied his powers of swimming\r\nand how I longed for a means to slay him, for my admiration of his\r\nbeauty and grace was as nothing compared with my longing for broiled\r\nvenison and for some tough buckskin with which to cover my poor,\r\nblistered, bruised feet. Perhaps, I thought, I might devise some trap\r\nwith which to capture a deer, or by finding a runway I might noose one,\r\nand I sighed to think how I was compelled to suffer and to win a bare\r\nexistence although surrounded by game which would furnish me with\r\ninnumerable comforts.\r\n\r\nBut if I was to complete my raft it was high time I resumed my labors.\r\nArising regretfully, for my rest upon the moss was delightful, I tramped\r\nthrough the woods to the two remaining logs.\r\n\r\nPresently I had pried one of the logs from behind some projecting stumps\r\nand, having placed branches beneath it to hold it up, I dropped my lever\r\nand started back to secure some pieces of wood I had used as rollers. In\r\ndoing this I stepped upon the other log, my foot slipped, I fell\r\ncrashing backward, my arm knocked the props from under the log, and with\r\na thud it dropped, pinning my foot beneath it.\r\n\r\nA terrific pain shot through my leg, I writhed and twisted, shrieking in\r\nagony as I strove to free my foot, and sweat poured from my face with\r\nthe torture, but still my leg remained fast wedged between the logs, and\r\nI saw before me a lingering, terrible death.\r\n\r\nOf what use had been all my trials my hard, weary tramping, and my\r\nstrivings to reach my fellow-men? Of what avail my brave conquering of\r\nnature and my struggle to live? Caught like a rat in a trap, I would die\r\nby inches here by the borders of the lake and years later some wandering\r\nhunter would find my whitened bones and in them read the story of my\r\nawful fate. Better by far if I had shared Joe’s death in the swirling\r\nwaters of the river. Half-crazed by pain and maddened to think of my\r\nhelplessness, I gathered all my strength, gritted my teeth, and with a\r\nlast despairing effort threw myself sideways and shoved with my free\r\nfoot upon the log. My foot seemed torn from the ankle, and my whole\r\nspine seemed seared with red-hot iron, but despite the agony I knew that\r\nI was free; I rolled forward on my face and mercifully lost\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCRIPPLED\r\n\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes to find that night had fallen. My first sensations were\r\nof unutterable pain; I was chilled through, racked with agony, and weak\r\nand faint from my injuries, and my first thought was to strive to reach\r\nmy camp. Groaning at each motion, I dragged myself forward a few inches,\r\nbut could scarce move a yard before I was compelled to sink again to the\r\nearth, for the torture of dragging my wounded foot through the brush and\r\nover the rough earth was more than I could bear.\r\n\r\nThinking to allay the pain somewhat, I sat up, tore off the rags of my\r\nshirt, and started to bind this about my foot, but with every motion and\r\nwith each touch I cried aloud, and only by gritting my teeth and by\r\nfrequently stopping to rest was I at last able to wrap the cloth about\r\nmy ankle. I judged that it was crushed and broken, but in the darkness I\r\ncould not tell the extent of the injury, and merely knew that the pain\r\nwas excruciating and that the leg and ankle were terribly swollen and\r\ncaked with blood.\r\n\r\nWith the wrapping protecting the foot, I found it pained me less as I\r\ndragged myself along, but even then the suffering it caused was more\r\nthan flesh and blood could stand, and before I had covered half the\r\ndistance to my camp I fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen I once more regained consciousness the sun was rising above the\r\ndark forest beyond the lake and a dull numbness had taken the place of\r\nthe pain in my leg and foot. I was burning with fever. I rolled and\r\ndragged myself to the edge of the lake, where I drank and bathed hands\r\nand face, and then lay there with my wounded leg soaking in the cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the cold revived me wonderfully, and as there was now no\r\nsensation whatever in my foot or leg I again started toward the camp. I\r\nhad crawled but a few feet when it occurred to me that a crutch might\r\nenable me to walk, and I soon found a stout stick with a fork near one\r\nend, which I thought would serve my purpose. Pulling myself up beside a\r\nsapling, I placed the stick beneath my arm and, much to my delight,\r\nfound that I could hobble along far more rapidly and with less exertion\r\nthan by crawling on all-fours.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I reached the camp, but the fire had long since burned\r\nout and it was some time before I could gather sufficient strength to\r\nstart a new one.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the fire was blazing and I had cooked and eaten some food,\r\nI felt much better, but I realized that something must be done for my\r\nfoot at once. To neglect it might result in blood-poisoning and death,\r\nand even if this did not occur I would be disabled and prevented from\r\nescaping from the forest before winter set in unless a rapid recovery\r\nwas assured.\r\n\r\nEven now I thought it might be too late, for, after lying on the damp\r\nground all night with the foot left to itself, I feared that cold might\r\nhave settled in the wound or that dangerous inflammation might have set\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMy first care, then, must be to make an attempt to reduce the swelling\r\nand bind up the wound with some pain-allaying and healing substance, and\r\nhere again my lack of knowledge of woodcraft and forest resources made\r\nme pitiably hopeless. I tried to remember any scraps of conversation or\r\nany incidents which I had heard or seen in the woods and which might\r\nhelp me, and at last I _did_ succeed in bringing to mind two instances\r\nin which my guides had made use of nature’s remedies in curing wounds.\r\nOn one occasion Joe had applied bear’s grease to a cut upon his hand,\r\nand at another time he had gathered some herbs as we passed through a\r\nlittle glade and to my questions had replied that it was arnica and was\r\nused in curing bruises and sprains.\r\n\r\nI had no bear’s grease and I did not know if arnica was found in the\r\nneighborhood, but I decided that the wound must be cleansed and\r\nbandaged, at any rate, and that the sooner it was done the better, for\r\nthe numbness was now passing off and the leg was commencing to pain\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nCarefully I unrolled the shirt, and as I exposed the limb I grew sick at\r\nthe sight, for leg and ankle were black with congested blood, terribly\r\nswollen and misshapen, and with the flesh and skin deeply torn and cut.\r\nI could not tell whether it was dislocated or broken; although when I\r\nfelt of it and moved it carefully with my hand it seemed so loose and\r\ncaused me such agony that I feared the worst.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, tedious, and torturing operation to bathe the foot and\r\nankle, wash out the cuts, and bind up the limb anew, but at last it was\r\naccomplished, and with sticks bound about it as splints to protect it, I\r\ndetermined to hobble about and try to discover some arnica plants before\r\nI became unable to move.\r\n\r\nBy means of a crutch I could travel fairly easily over the more open\r\nground near the lake, and I made my way slowly and painfully toward a\r\nlittle open spot I had noticed a few days before. Here rank weeds and\r\nplants grew in abundance, and after searching for some time I discovered\r\na clump of herbs which I felt sure were the same as those I had seen Joe\r\ngather.\r\n\r\nWhile searching for the arnica I had wandered to the farther side of the\r\nglade, and as I glanced about to get my bearings my eyes fell upon a\r\nwell-marked opening or trail leading into the woods close at hand.\r\nFilled with wonder at this, for I knew that the trail must have been\r\nmade by human hands, I examined it intently. Yes, there could be no\r\ndoubt of it. There were lichen-covered stumps showing the ax-marks and I\r\nrealized that by chance I had stumbled upon an old wood road. Thrilled\r\nwith excitement and almost forgetting the pain in my injured leg, I\r\nhobbled forward along the old road, for I knew that it must lead to some\r\ndefinite goal.\r\n\r\nI was too overcome with my discovery to think that the road might lead\r\nfor miles through the woods and that in my injured and weakened\r\ncondition I was running a grave risk in following it away from my camp,\r\nand it was fortunate for me that the end came so quickly.\r\n\r\nHardly had I hobbled forward for a dozen rods along the road when a turn\r\nahead disclosed a broad, sunlit clearing and in its center a house!\r\n\r\nFor an instant I was so utterly dumfounded that I could scarce believe\r\nmy eyes, for to find a human dwelling here in the forest and within a\r\nfew rods of my own camp seemed absolutely incredible. But there it\r\nstood, a tiny log cabin basking in the sunshine of the clearing, and\r\nwith a glad shout, and quite forgetting my injured leg, I hurried\r\nforward as fast as my condition enabled me.\r\n\r\nNo voice replied to my cry, and as I reached the open doorway I realized\r\nthat the hut had been long deserted and my heart sank. Across the floor\r\ndead leaves had drifted ankle-deep; moss grew upon the threshold;\r\nlichens covered the walls; sunlight streamed through many a hole and\r\ncrevice in the roof, and a squirrel scampered into the fireplace and up\r\nthe chimney as I stepped within the door. Along one side of the cabin\r\nextended a rude bunk, a table of slabs stood near the open fireplace,\r\nsome moldy, cobwebbed fragments of clothing hung from pegs driven in the\r\nwalls, a rusty iron pot stood upside down beside the hearth, and a small\r\ngrindstone was propped against one wall.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sensation to stand once more within the four walls of a\r\nbuilding, small and rude as it was, and I realized instantly how far\r\nsuperior it was to the best lean-to which I could build.\r\n\r\nWith my injured leg I would need rest and shelter, and here was a\r\nbuilding provided as if by a miracle for my needs.\r\n\r\nThrowing down my bundle of arnica, I made my way back to camp, gathered\r\nup my few simple belongings, and carried them to the cabin. Then,\r\ndespite my disabled condition, I made another trip and brought over some\r\nblazing brands to kindle a fire in my new home, for the trip of a few\r\nscore yards was less arduous than the labor of starting a new fire with\r\nmy crude appliances.\r\n\r\nMy first care was to make use of the arnica, for my leg was again\r\ntorturing me, and while I knew nothing of the method of using the herb,\r\nI assumed that it should be steeped or boiled and used as a compress, or\r\npoultice, and I soon had the freshly plucked plants simmering over the\r\nfire in the old iron pot.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I examined the interior of the hut with more care and found\r\nthat none of the openings in the roof were directly over the bunk, so\r\nthat I could be reasonably sure of protection from rain until I was able\r\nto repair the leaks. The leaves which had sifted within the door were\r\nsoft, clean, and dry, and I piled a great mass of these upon the bunk.\r\nUpon them I placed soft balsam-fir twigs and thus secured a bed which\r\nwas luxurious and comfortable indeed compared with the crude makeshifts\r\nto which I had become accustomed.\r\n\r\nBy the time the bed was prepared and the hut cleaned out the herbs in\r\nthe pot were thoroughly steeped, and as soon as the brew was\r\nsufficiently cooled I proceeded to place a dressing on my foot.\r\n\r\nThe swelling had not decreased, but the discoloration and angry\r\nappearance of the wound were less, and while the pain was still intense,\r\nI found it more bearable than when I had first bandaged it. The soggy,\r\nboiled leaves and stems of the arnica I used as a sort of poultice,\r\nbinding them upon the injured parts with strips of my rags soaked in the\r\nliquor, and then, quite exhausted with my efforts in my crippled\r\ncondition and the pain in my limb, I crawled into the bunk and at once\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke much refreshed and very hungry, and to my great relief I found\r\nthe pain in my foot had grown less and that the inflammation had not\r\nincreased or spread.\r\n\r\nAs I cooked my meal over the fire in the hearth I planned for the\r\nfuture, for my good fortune in finding the cabin had caused my spirits\r\nto rise and I cast aside the doleful forebodings of dying slowly from my\r\nwound, which had possessed me.\r\n\r\nThat I must remain in the hut until my leg and foot had completely\r\nrecovered was certain, for to attempt to cross the lake by raft, or to\r\nundertake any hard labor, with my foot in its present condition, would\r\nmerely result in more trouble and longer delay. And then a sudden light\r\ndawned upon me, and, had I been able, I would have danced for joy as I\r\nrealized that the presence of the cabin proved that it would not be\r\nnecessary to cross the lake, after all. Strange that it had not occurred\r\nto me before; for everything about the place spoke of its occupancy by\r\nwhite men, probably gum-gatherers, trappers, or lumbermen, and beyond a\r\ndoubt it was on a well-marked trail to the settlements, for, had its\r\noccupants come hither by canoe across the lake, the cabin would have\r\nbeen built close to shore and the trail would have led to the water’s\r\nedge instead of into the forest.\r\n\r\nAs I reasoned this out my mind was immensely relieved, for I felt that\r\nas soon as my foot would enable me to proceed I could follow the trail\r\nand reach the settlements in comparative ease.\r\n\r\nBut as I must remain a virtual prisoner in the cabin for the present, I\r\ndetermined to make the hut as comfortable as possible and then conserve\r\nall my strength and nurse my foot back to usefulness; and, having eaten,\r\nI proceeded to put my house in order.\r\n\r\nTo repair the leaks in the roof would, I felt, be a difficult matter\r\nwith my disabled leg, for I would be obliged to climb upon the roof from\r\noutside, and this I did not dare attempt. It occurred to me, however,\r\nthat by placing layers of evergreen branches over the roof a great deal\r\nof the rain might be kept out, and this I was able to do by means of a\r\nforked pole. The branches, I felt, would blow off with the first wind,\r\nand to secure them in position I laid long, light poles diagonally over\r\nthem, digging the upper ends of the poles into the old roof and lashing\r\nthe ends at the eaves to the walls of the hut.\r\n\r\nThis simple matter occupied me until dark and proved a tremendous task,\r\nfor I could use but one hand when hobbling about on my crutch and my\r\nprogress back and forth from the neighboring woods was slow and painful.\r\nWhen the roof was at last finished I was utterly exhausted, and as soon\r\nas I had eaten and had placed a fresh poultice on my foot I crawled into\r\nmy bunk. The door was still open, I had no coverings, and the night was\r\ncold, but the fire on the hearth warmed the interior of the cabin and I\r\nfelt little discomfort from the chill; in fact, I slept better and felt\r\nwarmer than I had for many nights, even though my shirt had been\r\nsacrificed to make bandages.\r\n\r\nFor several days thereafter I busied myself about the cabin, caught\r\ntrout for my food, and nursed my wounds, and, much to my satisfaction, I\r\nfound the ankle was growing no worse and that much of the pain had left\r\nit. Still, it did not recover as rapidly as I had hoped and I began to\r\nfear that it would be a long time before I would be able to use it\r\nagain, or that it might heal badly and become useless forever. In\r\nrummaging about the cabin I found several articles left by the former\r\nowners, such as a couple of empty bottles, some old tin cans, and a\r\nrusty old steel file.\r\n\r\nThe bottles proved useful for storing my arnica brew and the cans I used\r\nin cooking, but the file seemed of no value. The clothes which I had\r\nseen hanging upon the walls were far too rotten to be of any use as\r\nclothing—no doubt they were cast aside as worthless by their former\r\nowners—but they were better than nothing as coverings at night, and by\r\npiecing them together with hemlock roots I managed to form a ludicrous\r\nsort of patchwork quilt which was a real comfort.\r\n\r\nI had been at the cabin for about a week when I was aroused one night by\r\na strange sound. Some one or something was moving across the floor. At\r\nfirst I was startled. I had been so long accustomed to solitude that the\r\npresence of another alarmed me. Then it flashed upon me that perhaps a\r\nformer occupant of the cabin had returned and had entered, unsuspecting\r\nmy presence. Overjoyed at the thought and without stopping to consider\r\nthe consequences, I called out, “Hello!” and rose up in bed.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice the footsteps ceased, there was a strange\r\nguttural reply from near the fireplace, and a queer rattling sound as of\r\nsome one crumpling paper.\r\n\r\nPuzzled, and now rather alarmed, I spoke again, and instantly the grunt\r\nwas repeated and I heard the sound of shuffling footsteps hurriedly\r\napproaching my bed. Terrified, I shrank back, peering into the gloom of\r\nthe cabin in an endeavor to discern the outlines of my mysterious\r\nvisitor. The fire had died down, but a few red embers still gleamed upon\r\nthe hearth and cast a faint glow in the immediate vicinity. At the very\r\nedge of this dim light I thought I saw a moving shadow—a great, bulky,\r\nshapeless form, crouched low, and stealing toward me. My nerves were on\r\nedge, and at the sight of this mysterious, formless, threatening figure\r\nI uttered a scream of mortal terror. With a sudden sideways motion the\r\nshadowy something stepped within the glow of the fire, and then I broke\r\ninto a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT VISITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMy visitor was a porcupine, a great, clumsy creature who was far more\r\nfrightened at my presence than I at his. Realizing that here was food\r\ncome to my larder of its own free will, I scrambled out of bed, closed\r\nmy door, and, carefully avoiding my prickly visitor, made my way toward\r\nthe fire. Shoving a resinous stick into the coals, I soon had a flaming\r\ntorch, and by its light I discovered the porcupine scratching and\r\ngnawing at the door in an endeavor to escape. I ended his career by\r\nknocking him over the nose, and then, barring the door to prevent any\r\nother nocturnal visitors from disturbing my slumber, I returned to bed.\r\n\r\nThe roasted porcupine proved most toothsome, and as I gnawed at his\r\nbones I wondered why I had not thought of hunting these creatures\r\nbefore. That they were abundant in the forest I knew, and I also was\r\naware that they were considered excellent eating by all the guides and\r\nwoodsmen, and yet, until one of the brutes actually forced his presence\r\nupon me porcupines had never occurred to me as a source of food. Now,\r\nhowever, I made up my mind to hunt up a den of the creatures at the\r\nfirst opportunity, for I knew that where one was found there were\r\nusually numbers of them.\r\n\r\nI had met with some difficulty in removing the skin, with its\r\ninnumerable sharp quills, but I had noticed how tough the hide was and I\r\nvaguely wondered if I could not manage to tan and use it.\r\n\r\nWith its adhering quills it was quite useless, and I realized that if\r\nmerely dried, like the skin of the beaver, this tough, thick skin would\r\nbe as stiff and hard as a board. If I was to make use of the hide at all\r\nI must devise some method of removing hair and quills and must tan the\r\nskin so that it would be flexible and soft. In my youth I had often\r\nvisited a tannery and I knew that oak bark and sumach were used in\r\nmaking leather, but, rack my memory as I would, I could not remember\r\never having seen the process by which the hair was removed from the\r\nhides.\r\n\r\nI attempted to pluck out the quills by hand, but only pricked my\r\nfingers, and I found it also impossible to cut or shave the hair and\r\nquills from the skin with my knife. I had worked at this for some time\r\nand was becoming thoroughly disgusted with the matter when it flashed\r\nacross my mind that I might be able to remove the hair by decomposition.\r\nMany a time I had seen the hair or feathers drop from game which had\r\nbeen hung too long, and I knew that long before the meat was tainted or\r\nthe hide was seriously injured the hair would come away. Realizing that\r\nthe skin would dry before it would rot if hung up in the air, I buried\r\nit in the soft earth in a shady spot and spent some time gathering a\r\nquantity of oak and sumach bark, which I boiled in the iron pot.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished this, I decided to hunt for the porcupine’s home. My\r\nfoot was now paining me but slightly and I had become quite accustomed\r\nto the use of a crutch, so that I was able to start at once. Knowing\r\nthat porcupines frequented rocky ledges, I turned my steps toward a\r\nlittle wooded rise. A few hundred yards from the cabin I came upon a\r\nmass of rocks with great cavities and fissures between them. This seemed\r\na promising spot for a porcupine-den. In my crippled state it was\r\ndifficult to make my way over and between the boulders, but I had plenty\r\nof time and I crawled and scrambled about, peering into every crevice\r\nand cranny. I had been thus engaged for several hours when in a deep\r\nfissure I saw numerous quills scattered about, while projecting roots in\r\nthe vicinity were gnawed bare of bark. Here was the den, I felt sure,\r\nand without hesitation I scrambled down into it and peered into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nI could distinguish nothing at first, but as my eyes became accustomed\r\nto the obscurity of the cavern I saw a darker spot in the farther corner\r\nof the den and heard the rustling, rattling noise of a porcupine’s\r\nquills as the creature raised them in defense. Now that I had found my\r\nporcupine, the next question was how I was to capture him. I had no mind\r\nto attempt to grasp the rascal with my bare hands, and, like a fool, I\r\nhad not brought my primitive weapons with me. I thought of building a\r\nfire and smoking the creature out and then knocking him over the head\r\nwith a club, but my fire-making apparatus was in the cabin and I had no\r\nmind to make the journey again if it could be avoided. I was wondering\r\nhow I could solve the puzzle when it occurred to me that I might snare\r\nhim exactly as I had snared the partridges. In a few moments I had\r\nsecured a strong strip of moosewood bark, had formed a noose in it, and\r\nwith it attached lightly to the end of a slender pole I poked it into\r\nthe cave and tried to slip it over the porcupine’s head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARTRIDGE-SNARE]\r\n\r\nBut stupid and clumsy as he was, the brute backed away from the noose\r\neach time I poked it toward him, and if over and over again I was\r\ncompelled to withdraw it and form the slip-noose anew. I was tired and\r\ncramped and was about to give in despair when I felt a tug at the bark,\r\nand, pulling upon it, found I had at least secured a hold upon my prey.\r\nDropping the pole, I hauled on the strip of bark, and a moment later\r\ndrew the porcupine from his lair, grunting, scratching, and bristling\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\nHe was snared by one hind foot. I knocked him over the head and,\r\nslinging him to the end of a pole, returned to my hut, well pleased with\r\nthe hunt.\r\n\r\nThe next day I dug up his mate’s skin and, much to my delight, found the\r\nhair had started and the quills came away readily. The second skin was\r\nburied, and a few days later both were free of quills and hair, and\r\nafter washing them in the lake I placed them in the bark liquor which I\r\nhad prepared. Five days later I removed them, rinsed them off, and was\r\nimmensely elated to find that they had assumed a rich brown tint and had\r\nbeen transformed to tough leather. Now that my mind had turned to\r\ntanning, I recalled many little details. Among other matters I\r\nrecollected how the tanners worked the hides upon rounded timbers or\r\nhorses, and, while I did not know the reason why this was done, I\r\nassumed it was an essential part of the tanning process, and so I placed\r\nthe porcupines’ skins upon a fallen tree and worked at them diligently\r\nuntil they were thoroughly dried and all bits of adhering flesh and fat\r\nhad been removed. The results of my labor were two soft, brown pieces of\r\nleather nearly two feet in length by a foot in width, and I felt\r\nimmensely proud of my success at leathermaking. My only regret was that\r\nI could not find more of the prickly beasts, but, although I hunted\r\ndiligently, I was forced to the conclusion that there were no more in\r\nthe neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe pain had now quite gone from my foot, but it was still impossible to\r\nuse it. The slightest pressure upon it caused me excruciating torture\r\nand the ankle seemed to have no strength. I was terribly worried over\r\nit, for I feared I would never be able to use it again, and with only\r\none good foot I dared not wander far from the cabin, for fear I might\r\nslip or fall and injure my good leg and thus be left helpless in the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nOn one or two occasions I had hobbled off along the old trail for a mile\r\nor more, but it appeared to lead into the heart of the wilderness and I\r\nwas convinced that if it led to the settlements it must be by a long and\r\nroundabout route.\r\n\r\nThe weather was now becoming very cold, frosts were of nightly\r\noccurrence, and once or twice a thin layer of ice skimmed the water at\r\nthe edges of the pools. I suffered a great deal from the cold, hardened\r\nand accustomed as I was to exposure, and I knew that unless I made my\r\nway out of the forest or managed to invent some sort of covering for my\r\nbody I would soon succumb to the weather.\r\n\r\nHad I been able to secure enough porcupine-skins, or even rabbit-skins,\r\nI might have made some sort of garment, but both rabbits and porcupines\r\nwere very scarce. I had snared and shot a number of partridges, and\r\ntheir skins, sewed together, I made into a vest-like garment, but the\r\ndelicate skins tore apart with the least strain and I used the affair\r\nonly when sleeping or sitting in the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe ragged, rotten old clothes which I had used as a quilt were some\r\nprotection, but these soon gave out and I was faced with the serious\r\nproblem of freezing to death or securing enough hides to make a covering\r\nfor my nakedness. The chances seemed all in favor of freezing.\r\n\r\nMy shoes, or rather, my shoe—for I could use but one foot—had now worn\r\nthrough, and I determined to attempt making moccasins from the tough\r\nporcupine-hides. Fortunately I had seen Joe make moccasins, and after\r\none or two trials I succeeded in producing a very serviceable form of\r\nfoot-gear. I remembered that Joe always marked a pattern on the leather\r\naround his foot, but I did not feel sure how he gauged the size and,\r\nfearing to waste any of my valuable leather by a mistake, I hit upon the\r\nplan of ripping open my old shoe and using this for a pattern. Placing\r\nthe split shoe, sole down, upon the porcupine-skin, I marked around it\r\nwith a bit of charred stick and cut out the form with my knife. Then\r\nfrom the trimmings I cut tongues, as I had seen Joe do, and these I\r\nsewed to the uppers so that the latter were puckered, or gathered up,\r\nover the instep. Finally I sewed up the heels, cut string from the\r\nhides, and my first moccasin was complete.\r\n\r\nAll this occupied a great deal of time and labor and was far more\r\ndifficult than it sounds, for my only tool was my knife, and as I worked\r\nslowly and clumsily with this I longed for an awl or needle. With my\r\nmind on such things I remembered that I had heard of Indians using bone\r\nneedles, and I decided to try and make one with which to sew the other\r\nmoccasin. There were plenty of bones at hand, and I selected several and\r\ncommenced rubbing one upon a flat stone to grind it to a point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW I MADE MOCCASINS]\r\n\r\nI had worked diligently for some time when I suddenly remembered the old\r\ngrindstone and, laughing at my own stupidity, for I had repeatedly used\r\nthe stone for sharpening my knife, I proceeded to sharpen the bones in a\r\nsimple and easy manner.\r\n\r\nI had ground down one bone to form a fairly fine needle-pointed tool\r\nwhen my glance fell upon the old rusty file. The sharp tang of the file\r\nsuggested an awl at once, and, marveling that I had not thought of it\r\nsooner, I proceeded to grind it to a fine point.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes I had an excellent awl and with its aid I found the\r\ncompletion of my moccasins easy. The heavy file made the tool clumsy,\r\nhowever, and as soon as the moccasins were finished I set to work to\r\nbreak the awl-like end from the file itself. It seemed a simple matter\r\nand the reader may smile at my spending a moment’s thought over breaking\r\noff one end of a file, but to me it was an affair of great importance,\r\nfor I was afraid of snapping the steel in the wrong spot and thus\r\nruining the awl which I found so useful. With only stones as hammers, I\r\nrealized it would be difficult to break the metal in the desired place,\r\nand I pondered on the matter for some time before it occurred to me to\r\ncut the piece from the file by means of the grindstone.\r\n\r\nWhile I was cutting through the file it flashed upon me that the\r\nremaining portion of the tool might be transformed into a most efficient\r\nweapon. To be sure, I had no real need of a weapon, for my flimsy bow\r\nand arrows and frog-spear had served all my needs. But I had seen deer\r\ntracks on several occasions and had even caught a fleeting glimpse of\r\nthe creatures more than once, and while I had made no effort to molest\r\nthem, knowing the hopelessness of such an attempt, I had longed to\r\nsecure them and their hides. With a powerful spear, such as I could form\r\nfrom the old file, I thought it might be possible to kill a deer or some\r\nother large animal. Therefore I promptly set to work to grind the steel\r\ndown to sharp edges and a point. I soon found, however, that the\r\ngrindstone made scarcely any impression upon the file, and that, if I\r\nwas to succeed, I must soften the metal by means of fire. I hesitated to\r\ndo this, for fear that I would not be able to retemper it properly, but\r\nat last I thrust the file into the coals of my fire. When it was red-hot\r\nI raked it forth and allowed it to cool slowly. I now found the stone\r\nbit into the steel rapidly, and I felt genuine pride in my\r\naccomplishment as I watched the old file slowly assume the shape of a\r\nshining spear-head. It was hard work, however, and I stopped to rest\r\nmany times before the task was half finished. In fact, I spent a large\r\npart of two days at this labor, and several times I was on the point of\r\ngiving up the work as not being worth the trouble and exertion. At last,\r\nhowever, the spear-head was completed, and again placing it in the fire,\r\nI heated it to a cherry red, pulled it out from the coals, and dumped it\r\ninto the kettle full of cold water. I found it had taken an excellent\r\ntemper, and I then selected a straight, light pole of ash, bound the\r\nhead to it with sinews and roots, and my spear was completed. I was\r\nproud of the result of all my work, for it certainly looked like a most\r\nefficient weapon, but I was in some doubt as to my ability to throw it\r\naccurately. I hobbled forth to try my skill. I had no mind to ruin or\r\nbreak the weapon by using it against a tree, but I remembered a rotten\r\nold stump which I had seen near the edge of the woods. This offered an\r\nexcellent target.\r\n\r\nI approached within a dozen yards of the stump, steadied myself on my\r\ncrutch, and, balancing the spear, threw it with all my strength. The\r\nweapon fell far short of the mark and descended wrong end first. Then I\r\nrealized that the pole was far too heavy for the head.\r\n\r\nCutting off a foot or so of the haft, I tried again, and found that the\r\nspear traveled in a straighter line and it struck near the base of the\r\nstump. This was encouraging, and by trimming off the pole a little at a\r\ntime and by numerous trials I at last had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\nkeen point bury itself in the rotten wood.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I hurled the weapon, each time gaining greater skill and\r\nretreating farther from the stump, until I could drive the spear into\r\nthe stump at twenty paces every time.\r\n\r\nMy arm was now so tired with the unaccustomed exercise that I abandoned\r\nmy target practice and returned to the cabin, well pleased with the\r\nsuccess of my spear-making and quite convinced that if I could but find\r\na deer I would have a very good chance of killing him.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, while busy with my work, and interested, I felt quite\r\noptimistic and planned most wonderful things, but when alone in my cabin\r\nat night I often grew terribly despondent and saw matters in a very\r\ndifferent light. While throwing the spear in the bright sunshine it had\r\nnot seemed at all unreasonable to think of trailing a deer and killing\r\nhim like a primitive hunter, but as I thought over the matter that night\r\nit seemed a most visionary and ridiculous scheme. To trail a deer and\r\nbring him down with a javelin would be a difficult feat at any time, and\r\nnow, with my crippled foot, I realized that I would be hopelessly\r\nhandicapped. In vain I tried to persuade myself that, as I had seen deer\r\nbefore, I might see them again, and that chance might favor me; in vain\r\nI tried to think up some other method of obtaining the wherewithal for\r\nthe garments I so greatly needed. I could see nothing promising, nothing\r\nhopeful ahead, and, finally, convinced that I was doomed to die here in\r\nthis deserted cabin in the wilderness, I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI was aroused from my slumber by the sound of something scratching at\r\nthe door. Instantly I was wide awake, with all my faculties on the\r\nalert. Presently the sound was repeated; there was no doubt that some\r\ncreature was nosing about and endeavoring to enter the cabin. Another\r\nporcupine, I thought to myself, and, slipping cautiously from my bed, I\r\ngrasped my spear and, as silently as my injured foot would permit, stole\r\ntoward the door. This was a rude slab affair, without lock, bar, or\r\nlatch, and kept closed by a strip of bark looped over a peg in the wall.\r\n\r\nSlipping off this fastening, I threw the door open, and as I did so I\r\nstumbled back in terror, and only the heavy door saved me from tumbling\r\nhead over heels into the hut. I had expected to see a clumsy, harmless\r\nporcupine, and instead, clearly outlined in the bright moonlight, his\r\ngrinning teeth and gleaming wicked eyes fixed on my face, stood a great,\r\nshaggy figure. My visitor was an enormous bear!\r\n\r\nFor a brief second I stood transfixed with surprise and fear, and then,\r\nwithout stopping to think, I hurled my spear full at the creature with\r\nall my strength, slammed the door to, and braced myself against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWINTER SETS IN\r\n\r\n\r\nEach second I expected to feel the enraged bear tearing at the door\r\nbehind me, and I cursed my folly in having attacked him, for I realized\r\nthat, unmolested, he would have, no doubt, retreated at sight of a human\r\nbeing, whereas, maddened by the sting of my weapon, he might force the\r\ndoor and tear me to pieces. Even if he dared not do this, he might lie\r\nin wait outside and attack me as I went forth in the morning, and I\r\nshivered with cold and fear at the consequences of my rash act as I\r\nstood there against the door in the black darkness of the cabin.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed, and not a sound broke the silence outside, and at last,\r\nchilled to the bone, unable to stand the strain longer, and convinced\r\nthat the bear would not attempt to force his way in, I crept to the\r\nfireplace, fanned the coals into a blaze, and sat huddled within the\r\nwarmth of the hearth. Starting in terror at each sound outside, and not\r\ndaring to go back to bed, I passed the long hours until dawn.\r\n\r\nDaylight has a marvelous effect upon a man’s courage, and my fears of\r\nthe night seemed quite childish as the golden rays of the rising sun\r\npenetrated the chinks of my cabin and the scream of a blue jay reached\r\nmy ears.\r\n\r\nProbably my spear had missed the bear completely, I thought, and the\r\npoor brute, far more frightened than myself, had put many miles between\r\nhimself and the cabin where he had met with such a surprising reception.\r\nThus reasoning, and smiling at my foolish terror of a harmless bear, I\r\nrose, opened the door, and peered out. Not a sign of the bear could be\r\nseen, and I hobbled out into the crisp air with the glorious sunshine\r\nsparkling on the hoar frost. I glanced about for my spear and stopped\r\nshort; almost at my feet was a great crimson splotch of blood upon the\r\nfallen leaves. My spear had found its mark, and the next instant I\r\ncaught sight of it lying upon the ground a few yards away. I hurried to\r\nit and picked it up. It was covered with blood, blood was spattered upon\r\nthe leaves and bushes all about. Thrilled with the excitement of the\r\nchase, forgetting the risk I ran, and with spear in hand, I followed the\r\ncrimson trail toward the woods. Peering intently into each clump of\r\nbrush or tangled thicket, listening for some sound which might betray\r\nthe presence of the wounded bear, I traced the blood-drops. At one spot\r\namong a clump of high brakes he had stopped to rest, for the coarse\r\nferns were crushed and broken and stained with blood. In another spot he\r\nhad forced his way blindly through a tangle of brambles, for blood\r\nspattered the glossy leaves and bits of black hair clung to the sharp\r\nthorns. At any moment I might come upon him wounded and at bay, and I\r\nproceeded with greater caution. At last I reached the shadow of the\r\nwoods and on the dark moss and earth the trail became indistinct and\r\nhard to follow. A few yards ahead was an old fallen tree and,\r\napproaching this, I seated myself to rest and listen. As I did so I\r\nglanced to the other side, and there, within a yard of me, huddled in a\r\ngreat, shaggy heap, was the bear—stone-dead!\r\n\r\nFor a moment I could scarcely believe my eyes, but there was no doubt of\r\nit. The piggy little eyes were wide open and glassy, no breath heaved\r\nthe great, furry sides, and the gleaming, white teeth and lolling tongue\r\nwere thick with frothy blood.\r\n\r\nLeaning toward him, I poked the sharp tip of my spear into his nose, but\r\nthere was no response, no growl, no flicker of an eyelid, not even a\r\ntwitch of the nostrils, and, convinced that no spark of life remained, I\r\nhurried around the log and, like a man bereft of his senses, danced\r\nabout my victim. To an onlooker I would have been a strange, weird sight\r\nas, tattered and torn, half naked, with one foot bandaged in old rags, I\r\njumped and hopped about on my rude crutch, yelling like an Indian,\r\nbrandishing my spear, and crying taunts at the dead monster beside me.\r\nBut my actions did not seem ludicrous at the time. I had been\r\ntransformed to a primitive savage hunter glorying in his victory over\r\nthe brute beast. Thousands of years had been swept from me and I acted\r\nas my ancestors once acted when they slew the saber-toothed tiger or the\r\ngreat cave-bear. In the dim, distant past of the stone age.\r\n\r\nAt last I calmed down and examined my quarry with vast satisfaction.\r\nHere was food, warmth, and clothing, and I patted the rude spear which\r\nhad enabled me to secure them. It would be a hard job to skin the beast\r\nand to carry the hide and meat to my hut, I knew, but in view of the\r\ncomfort it would bring and its value to me the thought of the labor\r\ntroubled me little.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had not breakfasted and was very hungry, I determined to lose\r\nno time, and started in to skin the bear at once. It was a far harder\r\njob than I had counted on, for the creature weighed three or four\r\nhundred pounds. After I had stripped the hide from one side I was\r\nobliged to turn the carcass over, and this, with only sticks to aid me\r\nand with the handicap of my crippled foot, proved a difficult task.\r\nLuckily, there was a slight slope where the bear had fallen and this\r\nhelped me a great deal. By prying up the bear with a pole on one side,\r\nuntil his legs were uppermost, and then by hauling on withes attached to\r\nhis feet, I at last toppled him over. I now returned to camp for\r\nbreakfast and took with me a good-sized steak cut from the bear. The\r\nmeat was excellent. Refreshed and strengthened by my meal, I returned to\r\nthe bear’s carcass.\r\n\r\nBy noon I had finished skinning the creature and, with a vast amount of\r\nlabor, I dragged the hide to the cabin. Two more trips were made to\r\nsecure a supply of meat, and then, completely exhausted by my hard day’s\r\nwork, I ate my evening meal, threw myself into my bunk, and slept\r\nsoundly until the next morning.\r\n\r\nTo tan this great, shaggy skin was, I knew, quite beyond my powers, for\r\nI had no receptacle in which to place it, and I therefore decided to\r\nscrape it clean and dry it carefully, so that it would serve as a robe\r\nor covering, even though it was stiff and hard. I was determined,\r\nhowever, to use some of it for clothing, and for this purpose I cut off\r\na good-sized piece and put it in the tanning liquor with the hair on.\r\nEventually this was made into a shirt-like coat, which proved\r\nwonderfully warm and comfortable, although it was a most shapeless,\r\nill-made affair. The bear furnished far more meat than I could eat for a\r\nlong time, and I made up my mind to try to preserve a portion of it by\r\ndrying. My experiments with the beaver meat and fish had been a failure,\r\nbut, nevertheless, I decided to try once more, and this time I hung the\r\nstrips of meat in the chimney of the cabin to smoke. I cannot say that\r\nthe result of this method of preserving meat was a huge success, for the\r\nflesh was hard, dry, and smoky in flavor, but it was far better than\r\nnothing. After being soaked in water it was edible, and I knew that with\r\na supply on hand I could not starve.\r\n\r\nVery soon after I had killed the bear my foot became worse and I was\r\nobliged to spend most of my time in bed, for even the exertion of\r\nwalking on a crutch caused me agony. I did not know, at the time, what\r\ncaused the foot to become worse, but thought very likely I had struck or\r\npressed upon it while trailing or working at the bear, or that perhaps\r\nthe hard labor of those few days was too great. At any rate, the\r\nswelling recommenced, the leg became inflamed and pained me horribly,\r\nand I was fearful that blood-poisoning or gangrene had set in. I kept it\r\nconstantly poulticed with the arnica and, despite the agony it caused,\r\nrubbed it with bear’s grease. But while it grew no worse, it showed no\r\nsigns of getting better.\r\n\r\nThe weather had now become very cold, ice formed about the borders of\r\nthe lake at night, the sky was gray and lowering, the chill north winds\r\nswept the few remaining leaves from the trees, and I realized that I\r\ncould not hope to escape from the forest before winter set in.\r\n\r\nDay after day I lay upon my bunk, only moving forth to obtain water or\r\nfire-wood. Miserable as I was, I was thankful indeed for the comfortable\r\nbear-skin which covered me, the supply of rank, smoked meat which I had\r\nprovided, and, above all else, for the stout log cabin which I had so\r\nfortunately discovered.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had no comforts or luxuries, yet I had all of the real\r\nnecessities of life, and, had my foot been strong and well, I could have\r\nlooked forward to spending a winter in the woods without great\r\nforeboding. But with my bad foot I was in a desperate situation, for the\r\nsupply of bear meat was diminishing rapidly and I could not go forth to\r\nhunt for other food. At last, however, there seemed to be a change for\r\nthe better in my foot and then an abscess began to form. When this at\r\nlast broke and I drew forth a large sliver of wood from the wound, I\r\nfelt immediate relief and realized why the injury had proved so\r\ntroublesome.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the splinter was removed the ankle and foot commenced to\r\nrecover rapidly, and within a week the pain had left it and, much to my\r\njoy, I found that I could move the foot and could even rest some weight\r\nupon it. But I realized that it would take time for my foot to regain\r\nits full strength and that to use it too soon would only result in\r\nfurther trouble, and I nursed it with every possible care. Day by day it\r\nbecame stronger and soon I was able to limp about the cabin, although I\r\nstill used a crutch when out of doors. I began to plan for my tramp\r\ntoward the settlements and to hope for an escape from the forest very\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nThen one morning I awoke to find snow drifting through the crevices of\r\nmy cabin. Opening the door, I looked forth upon a strange world of\r\nwhite. Already the snow was ankle-deep upon the earth, the evergreens\r\ndrooped under its weight, the lake gleamed black and sullen in the midst\r\nof the vast white landscape. Ceaselessly, silently, the flakes fell from\r\nthe leaden sky, shutting off the farther shores and the interminable\r\nforests as with a dense, white curtain.\r\n\r\nAll day long the snow fell, all through that night and until noon of the\r\nnext day, and when the pale, wintry sun again broke through the clouds\r\nits watery rays glittered in dazzling brilliancy from a veritable\r\nfairyland. But to my eyes there was little to admire, for the earth was\r\nburied deep under many inches of snow, which had made me a helpless\r\nprisoner in the depths of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nHow hopeless it would be to attempt to tramp to the settlements under\r\nsuch conditions was borne upon me as I broke my way through the snow\r\ntoward the edge of the woods to secure a supply of wood, the next\r\nmorning; but while I was disgusted at thus being shut off by this first\r\nsnowfall just as my foot was becoming of use again, I realized that,\r\nafter all, the snow had helped me.\r\n\r\nEverywhere upon the surface of the fresh snow were the footprints of\r\nbirds and animals. It seemed incredible that there could be so many wild\r\ncreatures dwelling close at hand, unseen and unsuspected. Here, the\r\nwell-marked trail of a hare crossed the snow; back and forth across it\r\nzigzagged the snake-like track of a marten; to one side, and evidently\r\nfollowing the others, were the imprints of a fox’s feet, and I could\r\ndistinguish the marks left by partridges, squirrels, and many other\r\nwoodland denizens which I could not identify.\r\n\r\nSurely, with these trails to guide me, I could set traps and secure both\r\nfood and furs, and I grew greatly interested and wandered here and\r\nthere, striving to read the stories the creatures had written on the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nEven close to the hut many creatures had passed and repassed during the\r\nnight. I noticed where a hare had scampered about the cabin. Some larger\r\nanimal had dug through the snow before the door to secure some old bones\r\nI had dropped, and at least a dozen smaller creatures had made merry\r\nabout my dwelling while I slept, all unconscious of their presence.\r\n\r\nAs my foot was now strong enough to enable me to walk upon it with the\r\naid of a cane, I decided to start out after breakfast and set some\r\ntraps, and so, wrapping the bear-skin about me, armed with my bow and\r\narrows, and using my spear as a staff, I set forth. I must have been a\r\nwild and savage figure as I limped through the snow that morning,\r\nwrapped in the bear-skin, with my hair falling to my shoulders, and with\r\nan unkempt, ragged beard covering my face, and I might well have been\r\nmistaken for the original wild man. But no one was there to see me and I\r\ngave no thought to my appearance, but trudged away through the snow\r\ntoward the forest, my eyes fixed upon the trail before me, and well\r\nprotected from the icy wind by the thick fur bound about my body. The\r\ntracks I was following puzzled me, for they looked like those of a\r\nminiature bear, but they were easy to trail and led directly to an old\r\nhollow stub. As there seemed to be no other trail, I decided that this\r\nmust be the home of the creature, whatever it was. Curious to know what\r\nsort of animal had made the tracks and had visited my cabin, I pounded\r\nupon the stub and was rewarded by a slight scratching noise from within,\r\nand an instant later a queer, quizzical face peered forth from the\r\nopening above me and stared down questioningly at the strange being who\r\nhad knocked upon its home. The sharp nose and bright eyes were visible\r\nonly for an instant, but the brief glimpse was enough, and I recognized\r\nthe owner as a raccoon. Well, raccoons were good to eat and their fur\r\nwas warm, and I made up my mind to capture the ’coon that night. My\r\nfirst thought was to set a trap beside the tree, but a moment’s\r\nreflection changed my plans, for I realized that the ’coon would\r\nprobably return to the cabin again and that it would be far easier to\r\ntrap him by my own door than by his.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEADFALL SET WITH FIGURE-FOUR TRIGGER]\r\n\r\nThere were still plenty of tracks to be followed, and for several hours\r\nI busied myself locating the homes of hares and setting twitch-ups to\r\ncapture them. Then, as my hands were becoming numb and I feared catching\r\ncold in my weak ankle, I retraced my steps to the cabin. Late that\r\nafternoon I set a deadfall outside the door for the raccoon, building it\r\nlike the one in which I had caught the beaver, but furnishing it with a\r\nfigure-four trigger, and baiting it with scraps of meat.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I hurried to the door as soon as I awoke and, much to\r\nmy joy, found that a fine, fat raccoon had fallen a victim to my trap.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in skinning him, and dined off broiled ’coon, which I\r\nfound excellent. Then I set out for the woods to inspect my snares.\r\nSeveral were untouched, two were sprung but contained nothing, but in\r\nanother a fine, white hare was dangling.\r\n\r\nI cannot express the satisfaction which I felt upon the success of my\r\nfirst day’s trapping, for I realized that I would not want for food\r\nwhere animal life was so plentiful and so unaccustomed to man. I knew\r\nalso that rabbit and ’coon-skins could be made into the warmest and most\r\ncomfortable of garments.\r\n\r\nI was so much encouraged that I went much farther into the woods, set a\r\nnumber of new snares, and returned by another route to the cabin. This\r\nbrought me close to my old camp and the border of the lake, and as I\r\ncame out from the edge of the woods to the shore I heard a strange,\r\nsubdued chuckling sound from beyond a low, brushy point. Wondering what\r\ncreature was there, I crawled cautiously forward, peered at the little\r\ncove beyond, and looked upon a flock of wild ducks sunning themselves at\r\nthe edge of the lake where a spring kept the water free from ice.\r\n\r\nFitting an arrow to my bow, I rose silently, but, cautious as I was, the\r\nbirds caught sight of me and instantly took wing with loud quacks of\r\nalarm. In a vague hope of bringing one down I fired, but the arrow fell\r\nshort, and dropped into the lake beyond my reach, and the ducks safely\r\nwinged their way toward the farther shores. But I minded the loss of my\r\narrow far more than the loss of the ducks, for I had plenty of meat for\r\nmy present needs and the weather was now cold enough to enable me to\r\nkeep a supply on hand for a long time. For several days I spent my time\r\nsetting traps and skinning and tanning the hides, for each morning I\r\nfound hares in my twitch-ups, and I also succeeded in capturing another\r\nraccoon. The tanned rabbit-skins I sewed into rude mittens and a sort of\r\nundershirt, the two ’coon-skins provided leggings, and rabbit-skins were\r\nmade into a cap. As my feet suffered a great deal from the cold, I lined\r\nthem with rabbit-skin, with the fur inside, and when all this had been\r\naccomplished I found I was perfectly protected from the weather as long\r\nas I exercised, while my bear-skin robe made a splendid blanket at\r\nnight, or served as a cloak when I was sitting still during the days.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks had now elapsed since the first snowfall, my foot was\r\nstrong enough so that I could walk upon it without a cane, save on rough\r\nground, and I was well clothed in furs and was quite comfortable, and\r\ncould look forward without fear to spending the winter in the woods,\r\nwhich now seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the supply of meat I had suspended the carcasses of the\r\nhares on a pole at one side of the cabin, where they were frozen stiff\r\nand out of reach of prowling foxes or other creatures. Each evening I\r\nset the deadfall by the door to capture any ’coon or other animal which\r\nmight approach my hut to pick up scraps from my meals. Just as I was\r\nsnuggling down beneath my bear-skin robe one night I heard a slight thud\r\noutside, and, thinking some creature had sprung the deadfall, I threw\r\noff the robe and started to go forth to secure my prize. But ere my feet\r\ntouched the floor I was riveted to the spot and a cold shiver ran down\r\nmy spine as the silence of the night was pierced by a terrifying,\r\nmoaning wail, ending in a blood-curdling scream.\r\n\r\nFor one long second I sat motionless on the edge of my bunk while that\r\nawful sound echoed through the night, then, like a frightened child, I\r\nducked under my bear-skin robe, pulled it over my head, and lay huddled\r\nand quaking in superstitious terror. For a space there was silence, then\r\nsome heavy body landed with a crash upon the roof above my bunk, and the\r\nawful, banshee-like wail pealed forth within a few inches of my head. A\r\ncold sweat broke from my skin, I shivered with abject fear, my hair\r\nseemed to rise upon my scalp, and as the last sobbing note of the\r\nterrible sound died out and the awful something began tearing at the\r\nroof, my nerves gave way, and I shrieked aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBACK TO THE PRIMITIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound of my own voice was a great relief. Suddenly my foolish terror\r\nvanished, and with a sudden reaction of feeling I broke into peals of\r\nlaughter as I realized that the blood-curdling cry was that of a lynx\r\nand not the wail of a banshee or anything supernatural.\r\n\r\nNo doubt my screams frightened the creature quite as much as his cries\r\nhad terrorized me, for there was no further sound from the roof and the\r\nhowling was not repeated.\r\n\r\nFeeling confident that the lynx had left the vicinity, I again snuggled\r\ndown in my bunk and slept undisturbed until morning.\r\n\r\nBut when I stepped out of my cabin the next day the effects of the\r\nlynx’s visit were evident. The deadfall was sprung and the bait had been\r\ntaken, the snow was covered with the big footprints of the creature, and\r\nmy store of frozen meat was torn to pieces and scattered upon the snow,\r\nwhile a good portion of it had been devoured or carried off by the great\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nThat he would return for more food when darkness fell I was convinced,\r\nand I determined to capture him if it was possible. As long as he was at\r\nlarge I could not keep a store of frozen meat in safety, and I thought\r\nlongingly of his thick fur coat, which would be a most welcome addition\r\nto my wardrobe.\r\n\r\nAs I went into the woods to look at my traps and snares I traced the\r\nlynx tracks for some distance, until I reached a spot where he had\r\nleaped into a partly fallen tree and the trail was lost.\r\n\r\nThinking this tree might be a regular runway for the creature, I spent\r\nsome time setting a large and heavy deadfall upon it and then made the\r\nrounds of my traps. But I was doomed to disappointment, for a thieving\r\nfisher-cat had been before me and only fragments of torn skin and fur, a\r\nfew drops of blood, and some scattered feathers remained as proofs that\r\nmy snares had captured hares and partridges.\r\n\r\nAs long as this thief was about I could not expect to obtain game, for I\r\nwell knew that once the rascal had discovered my traps he would visit\r\nthem as regularly as myself, and that it would be necessary to capture\r\nhim to insure my food-supply.\r\n\r\nI had often heard Joe and the other woodsmen tell tales of the sagacity\r\nand cunning of the fisher-cats and I realized that I would have a hard\r\ntask to capture the creature which robbed my traps. Nevertheless, I\r\ncould but try, and with the greatest care I set a deadfall near each of\r\nmy traps and arranged the triggers as I had that of the beaver-trap.\r\nThen behind each trap I built a little inclosure or fence of sticks,\r\ncovered this with slabs of bark, and within these placed pieces of the\r\nfrozen hares left by the lynx.\r\n\r\nI then returned to the cabin and in the afternoon set two large\r\ndeadfalls and baited them with the remains of the hares’ carcasses.\r\nDuring the day I had given a great deal of thought to the capture of the\r\nlynx, and various plans had occurred to me which I cast aside as\r\nimpracticable. Had I possessed any sort of serviceable weapons it would\r\nnot have been such a difficult matter to kill the beast, for I knew\r\nthat, driven by hunger, a lynx will become very bold, and that by lying\r\nin wait I might easily obtain a good shot at him from within the cabin.\r\nI could not throw my spear from inside the hut, however, and I knew how\r\nhopeless it would be to attempt to approach the lynx in the open, while\r\nto fire at him with my flimsy, bone-tipped arrows would be utterly\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThis led me to consider the possibility of making a more powerful bow\r\nand better arrows. I knew that the Indians used stone-headed weapons in\r\nformer times and I had often seen the stone arrow-heads and had even\r\nfound many myself, and, while I was familiar with their appearance, I\r\nhad no idea how the savages formed them.\r\n\r\nBut I was convinced that if a naked primitive Indian could make a stone\r\narrow-head, a white man who had overcome as many difficulties as myself\r\nshould be able to accomplish the same feat, and I decided to try my hand\r\nat making stone arrow-heads at once.\r\n\r\nI had seen arrow-heads of white quartz, of flint, and of various other\r\nstones, and I therefore came to the conclusion that the kind of rock\r\nmade little difference; and as there were more pebbles and stones around\r\nthe borders of the lake than anywhere else in the vicinity, I made my\r\nway to the shore and picked up a number of stones which I thought might\r\nserve my purpose.\r\n\r\nAgain inside my hut, I proceeded to crack the pebbles with a large\r\nstone. While some of the rocks broke into small bits, or thick, squarish\r\npieces, others split into flakes or slivers which were quite thin and\r\nbore a remote resemblance to the forms I desired.\r\n\r\nI reasoned that the Indians must have worked with stones for tools, and\r\nmy common sense told me that the simplest and easiest method of\r\ntransforming a rough flake of stone to an arrow-head would be to chip or\r\nbreak off the edges by nicking them with a rock.\r\n\r\nSelecting a promising flake of quartz, I attempted to work it into shape\r\nand chipped away steadily for half an hour or so. It was work to which I\r\nwas not accustomed, and I scratched, bruised, and cut my hands, but the\r\nbit of stone gradually assumed a rough, spear-like shape. I was becoming\r\nelated at my success when, without warning, the quartz split in two. I\r\nwas thoroughly disgusted. Tossing the two pieces petulantly into the\r\nfire, I tried another piece of stone. This was even more disappointing\r\nthan the first, for with the third blow of my stone hammer the rock flew\r\nto pieces and this followed the other into the flames. Then it occurred\r\nto me that I might grind the stones on my grindstone, and I at once\r\ntried this scheme. Instead of cutting the rock the grindstone was cut by\r\nthe rock, and I realized that this method was impracticable. Then I\r\nthought that possibly some softer stone might be ground into shape, and\r\nI made another trip to the edge of the lake and returned with a number\r\nof pieces of a slate-like stone which seemed fairly soft. This gave way\r\nrapidly to the grindstone and I soon succeeded in grinding out two\r\narrow-heads which pleased me greatly. These I bound on to my arrows in\r\nplace of the bone heads, and then, in order to test them, I fired one at\r\na piece of hide. The arrow flew much straighter and harder than those\r\nwith the bone heads, but when it struck the skin the slate splintered\r\nand the arrow fell to the earth without even penetrating the hide.\r\n\r\nI was now thoroughly convinced that my attempts at making stone\r\narrow-heads was a complete failure and I seated myself before the fire\r\nto rest and think. As I sat there, gazing idly at the flames, I noticed\r\nthe bits of quartz glowing red among the coals, and, impelled by a vague\r\ncuriosity, I raked them out upon the hearth. Thinking to cool the stones\r\nso I could examine them, I poured some water upon them and instantly the\r\nhot quartz flew into pieces. Surprised at this, I picked up one of the\r\nfragments and was struck by its knife-like edge and smooth surface, and\r\nlike an inspiration it dawned upon me that here, perhaps, was a solution\r\nof my problem.\r\n\r\nIf water poured upon hot quartz would cause the stone to sliver off in\r\nthis way, why would it not be possible to heat stones, drop water upon\r\nthem in the proper places, and thus break off pieces until the desired\r\nshape was produced? It was certainly worth trying, and without more ado\r\nI set to work to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nPlacing a lump of quartz in the fire, I waited until it was red-hot, and\r\nthen, pulling it out, I poured a little water upon it. With a sharp\r\ncrack it burst into several pieces. Selecting the best of these, I again\r\nplaced them on the coals. When they were well heated I drew one out and\r\nvery carefully dropped water upon one edge. Pieces flaked from it\r\nwherever the water touched the hot stone. While my first attempt was a\r\nfailure and the piece of quartz refused to assume the form of an\r\narrow-head, yet I realized that this was due to my lack of skill and\r\ncare and that my theory was correct.\r\n\r\nOver and over again I heated stones and flaked them into shape by means\r\nof drops of cold water, and although I did not succeed in making a\r\nsingle arrow-head before darkness came and I was obliged to cease, yet I\r\nfelt convinced that with practice I could produce keen, well-shaped\r\narrow-points, and I went to bed determined to resume my labors on the\r\nmorrow and to persevere until I was successful.\r\n\r\nI heard no sound from the lynx, or any other prowler, that night, and\r\nfound the deadfalls undisturbed when I opened my door in the morning. As\r\nI approached the tree where I had placed the lynx-trap, I saw it was\r\nsprung, but the lynx was not in it, although a few wisps of dark-brown\r\nhair and numerous bloodstains proved that some creature had been struck\r\nby the heavy descending log. All about there were lynx tracks in the\r\nsnow. Here and there I saw smaller tracks, and for a few moments I was\r\npuzzled, for the hairs upon the tree trunk did not look exactly like\r\nthose of a lynx and much of the blood was trodden into the snow by the\r\ncreature’s feet. Then, as I examined the trap more carefully, I\r\ndiscovered the tip of a bushy black tail and realized what had happened.\r\nThe fisher-cat had been caught in the deadfall and had been found and\r\ndevoured by the lynx. I smiled as I thought how one thief had made away\r\nwith another, but I regretted the loss of the fisher’s warm skin. I\r\nreset the deadfall and then visited my other traps. Three hares were\r\nhanging in the twitch-ups, and the fact that they had not been disturbed\r\nproved that my surmises in regard to the fisher’s fate had been correct.\r\nOne of the deadfalls contained a skunk, which I did not use, although\r\nits fine coat of black-and-white fur was a great temptation despite its\r\nodor. Another deadfall contained a marten, while the others had not been\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day I devoted to working at my arrow-heads and before\r\nnoon I had the satisfaction of producing a very creditable arrow-head of\r\nquartz. I was anxious to test this, but I hesitated for fear of breaking\r\nit and thus wasting all the time and labor I had spent. Finally I\r\ndecided to take the risk and, having bound it to one of the\r\narrow-shafts, I fired it at one of the hares I had caught. With a thud\r\nit struck the carcass, penetrated skin, muscle, and bone, and came to\r\nrest with half its length projecting beyond the farther side of the\r\nhare. I hurried forward to examine the point, expecting to find it\r\nchipped or broken, but it was absolutely uninjured. I shouted with joy\r\nas I realized that my perseverance was rewarded, that I now possessed a\r\nweapon of real penetrating power, and that, provided my aim was true, I\r\ncould successfully bring down many a creature that otherwise would have\r\nbeen beyond my reach.\r\n\r\nI argued if my crude, weak bow could drive this stone-headed shaft\r\ncompletely through a half-frozen hare, that with a stronger bow I might\r\neven kill a deer or the lynx, and I at once went to work on more\r\narrow-heads, wisely deciding that I had best complete this work while I\r\nwas in practice and leaving the making of a new bow until later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRIMITIVE ARROW]\r\n\r\nBy nightfall a half-dozen arrow-points were finished, for, once I had\r\ndiscovered the “knack” of making them—by touching the red-hot flakes of\r\nstone with a wet stick where I wished to chip off the edges—I found I\r\ncould produce excellent results rapidly and easily. I had thought the\r\ntip which I tested on the hare was perfect, but by comparison with the\r\nlast one I made it seemed crude and rough, and I retired that night well\r\npleased with my success and skill, and I fell asleep planning the bow\r\nwhich I promised myself I would make the following day.\r\n\r\nThat night I was again aroused by the piercing scream of the lynx, and\r\nalthough I knew well what it was, yet I could not avoid shivering as the\r\nweird cadence rose and fell, echoing from the forest and ending in its\r\nunearthly moan, like a soul in mortal torment. I had always thought of\r\nlynxes with a feeling of contempt, and had looked upon them as cowardly,\r\novergrown cats—sneaking thieves and destroyers of small game—and I tried\r\nto laugh away my unreasonable fear. I told myself that I was perfectly\r\nsafe here in the cabin and that even outside the creature would turn\r\ntail and bound off at sight of a human being, but despite every effort,\r\nwhen the cries again rang out from close at hand I felt my knees shake,\r\nwhile strange, crawling sensations ran up and down the back of my neck.\r\n\r\nListening intently, I could plainly hear the light creak of snow beneath\r\nthe beast’s feet as he moved about outside, and, finding inaction\r\nutterly unbearable, I slipped out of my bunk, tiptoed to the door, and\r\npeered out through a crevice.\r\n\r\nOutside it was as bright as day, with the full moon shining upon the\r\nsnow, and there, within a dozen feet, was the lynx; a huge, tawny\r\ncreature whose strength showed in every movement.\r\n\r\nHe was nosing about near the deadfall, and his attitudes as he peered at\r\nthe trap, cocked his tufted ears forward, and turned his head first to\r\none side and then another—as if reasoning out a method of securing the\r\ncoveted bait without injuring himself—made him appear unnaturally human.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the creature my unreasonable fears disappeared, for here was\r\nsomething tangible and he was so close, so plainly visible, and\r\npresented such a splendid mark, that I determined to try a shot at him\r\nwith my stone-tipped arrow.\r\n\r\nThe crevice between the door and wall was very narrow, scarce an inch in\r\nwidth, and, had I stopped to think, I would have known that to attempt\r\nto fire an arrow through this and strike the mark was utterly foolish.\r\nPlacing the arrow on the bowstring, I slipped the head through the\r\nopening and started to draw the bow. As I did so the arrow touched the\r\nside of the crevice and dislodged a tiny bit of old bark, which dropped\r\nto the floor. Slight as the noise was, the keen ears of the lynx heard\r\nit, and with a startled growl he faced toward me. Never shall I forget\r\nthe fierce, malevolent gleam in those great, green eyes, the snarling\r\nlips and gleaming teeth, and the bristling fringe of white beard. No\r\nlonger did I see only a hulking lynx out there upon the snow; instead I\r\nseemed to gaze upon some supernatural, awful monster whose baleful eyes\r\nstared into mine and made me feel defenseless in spite of my shield of\r\nstout logs. His gaze filled me with a strange fear, an unnamed dread,\r\nand yet fascinated me as with hypnotic power.\r\n\r\nMotionless I stood there, as if transfixed, my bow half drawn, my arrow\r\npoised, while for a brief space the lynx stared at the blank wall. Then,\r\nas he crouched low as if about to spring, the spell was broken, my\r\nfingers released the string, there was a sharp twang, the rustle of the\r\nspeeding arrow, and the next second the cabin shook as the vicious brute\r\nhurled himself against the door with a piercing scream of rage. For an\r\ninstant I feared the door would give way if the lynx sprang again, and,\r\nterror-stricken at the fury I had aroused by my action in firing at him,\r\nI grasped my spear and knife, determined to sell my life dearly if the\r\nbeast gained entrance. But there was no repetition of the attack, and at\r\nlast, gathering up courage, I again looked forth from my peephole, but\r\nno sign of the lynx was to be seen. Still, I was afraid that he might\r\nreturn, and before climbing into my bunk I piled the table, all the\r\nfire-wood, the iron pot, and the grindstone against the door.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I lay awake, listening for some noise which would betray\r\nthe return of the lynx, but no sound, save the distant bark of a fox and\r\nthe querulous note of a screech-owl, broke the silence of the winter\r\nforest, and finally I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I again opened my eyes and, glancing about, saw the pile of things\r\nagainst the door, I laughed at my fears of the night, and, jumping out\r\nof bed and wrapping myself in my robe, stepped out of doors to see what\r\nsigns had been left by my midnight visitor.\r\n\r\nEvidently the brute had vented his ill-temper on my arrow, for the shaft\r\nwas broken and bitten to pieces, but the head was uninjured, and as no\r\nblood-spots were visible I decided that the lynx had not been hit. The\r\ndeadfall was still unsprung and the bait within it was untouched. By the\r\ndistance between his footprints I knew the first blind rage of the lynx\r\nhad been superseded by terror and that he had used all his speed in\r\ngetting as far from the cabin as possible.\r\n\r\nUpon the door deep, white grooves were cut into the wood where the sharp\r\nclaws of the lynx had struck and I shuddered to think of the injuries\r\nthose keen talons could inflict on human flesh. I was thankful indeed\r\nthat stout wood was between me and the giant cat when he launched\r\nhimself forward in a frenzy at being disturbed in his prowling.\r\n\r\nJudging by the fate of the fisher-cat, I rather expected to find that\r\nany game which I had captured had gone to feed the hungry lynx, and in\r\nthis surmise I was not at fault. Bits of white fur were all that\r\nremained of at least two hares, while scattered feathers told the tale\r\nof a snared partridge which had also helped to satisfy the lynx’s\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nMatters now began to look serious. If the lynx was to rob my traps\r\nnightly there was little use in setting them and I would soon be face to\r\nface with the problem of killing the lynx or starving. He was evidently\r\ntoo wise to be caught in any trap which I could make, and my only hope\r\nlay in securing a supply of game by means of my bow and arrows, or of\r\nkilling the lynx by the same method.\r\n\r\nFortunately I had quite a supply of frozen meat on hand, which I kept\r\ninside the cabin at night after freezing it during the day, and as I had\r\nno wish to become a purveyor to the lynx I left my snares unset and\r\nreturned to the hut prepared to make a new bow.\r\n\r\nNow that I was comfortably clothed and housed and could not hope to get\r\nout of the woods for a long time, I could devote more skill and time to\r\nmy bow-making. In the three months which had passed since I made my\r\nfirst bow I had learned a great deal about the forest’s resources, the\r\nproperties of various woods, and the skilful use of my knife.\r\n\r\nNow I determined to make a weapon which would be worth while and I spent\r\nseveral hours searching through the young growth at the edges of the\r\nwoods and near the lake for a suitable staff from which to make my bow.\r\nFinally I found what I sought, a thoroughly seasoned, but sound, pole of\r\nhornbeam which was so tough, springy, and hard that I felt confident it\r\nwould work into a bow of exceptional strength and power.\r\n\r\nAs I returned with this, I noticed that the sky had grown overcast and\r\nthat a few great flakes of snow were falling lazily through the cold,\r\nmotionless air. A short time before I would have been greatly troubled\r\nby the indications of a heavy snowfall, but now, with my foot completely\r\nrecovered, well clothed, and fully convinced that it was useless to\r\nthink of making my way to the settlements before spring, a few inches or\r\nfeet of snow, more or less, was of little moment.\r\n\r\nI found the hornbeam very hard to work, and by the time I was compelled\r\nto put it aside, on account of darkness, I had accomplished little save\r\nto whittle the staff to half-round form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I looked from my door the next morning I found a blizzard raging,\r\nwhile the snow was drifted almost to the eaves of my tiny cabin.\r\n\r\nI was indeed thankful that I had enough food on hand to satisfy my wants\r\nfor a number of days, for to hunt or trap in such weather was an utter\r\nimpossibility. My stock of fire-wood was none too large, however, and I\r\ndecided it would be wise to gather more before the storm prevented me\r\nfrom leaving my hut.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I bundled up in my furs and started out, but before I had\r\ntraveled a hundred feet I gave up in despair and retraced my way toward\r\nthe cabin, for the snow was up to my waist and to plow my way through it\r\nwas absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nI was hopelessly snow-bound, for the present at least, but I cheered\r\nmyself with the thought that when the storm eased the surface of the\r\nsnow might freeze and form a crust which would support my weight.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two, at any rate, I would not suffer, and as the snow,\r\nbanked around the hut, prevented the chill wind from entering, I was\r\nable to keep comfortably warm with a smaller fire than usual and could\r\nthus save a great deal of fuel. I was thinking on such matters, while\r\nworking at my bow, when the idea of snow-shoes occurred to me. It was\r\nstrange that I had not thought of them before, for I had used snow-shoes\r\nfor sport and knew that every camp and house in the northern woods had\r\nsnow-shoes hanging upon the walls for winter use. To think of snow-shoes\r\nwas easy, but to make them was a very different matter, as I soon\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nI knew full well that I would not be able to produce a really fine pair\r\nof shoes, such as were used by the guides and dwellers in the north, but\r\nI thought that I would have no trouble in making some sort of affairs\r\nwhich would serve my purpose and would prevent me from sinking into the\r\nsnow. My idea was to make the frames of elastic green wood, and string\r\nor net them with strips of hide or bark. To secure the withes for the\r\nframes I was obliged to face the storm and after a terrific struggle\r\nsucceeded in reaching a little clump of young growth close to the cabin.\r\nCutting a number of the slender shoots of birch, I fought my way back to\r\nthe hut and, utterly exhausted by my exertions, threw myself on the bunk\r\nto recover my breath and strength.\r\n\r\nI found little trouble in bending the birch withes in oval form. Lashing\r\nthe two ends of each together, I placed braces or spreaders between the\r\nsides to hold them apart and then started to put on the netting. But\r\nhere my troubles commenced. If I drew the thongs tight in one direction\r\nit loosened those which ran the other way; the strips of hide slipped on\r\nthe frames; the frames sprung out of shape and twisted, and finally I\r\ndiscovered that to cover the frames with netting, even if I succeeded in\r\nfixing it in place, would require more thongs of hide or more strips of\r\nbark than I could furnish. Until I attempted the work I had no idea of\r\nthe quantity of material which was required to cover snow-shoes with\r\ntheir netting, nor of the immense amount of labor necessary to make\r\nthem. My respect for the makers of snow-shoes was vastly increased by\r\nthe time I had labored for a few hours at my clumsy attempts, and I\r\nmarveled that articles entailing so much work and such ingenuity could\r\nbe sold at the prices I had heard quoted.\r\n\r\nAt last I _did_ succeed in producing a nondescript, ridiculous thing\r\nwhich bore a remote resemblance to a snow-shoe, and, anxious to test its\r\npracticability before attempting to make its mate, I placed it on the\r\nsnow outside my door and stepped cautiously upon it. For a moment it\r\nsupported me upon the surface of the snow, and I was just commencing to\r\ncongratulate myself upon my success when, without warning, the frame\r\ndoubled up, the netting collapsed, and my foot plunged into the snow,\r\nthrowing me sprawling in the drift. Floundering about, I extricated\r\nmyself, fished up the wrecked thing upon which I had spent so much toil,\r\nand re-entered the cabin, heartily sick of snow-shoe making.\r\n\r\nBut as I busied myself preparing a meal my thoughts constantly reverted\r\nto the snow-shoes, for I realized that they were a real necessity, and I\r\nstrove to reason out the causes for my failure and to devise some method\r\nof overcoming the difficulties. My experience with stone arrow-heads had\r\ntaught me a lesson and had showed me how simple an apparently difficult\r\nthing may be, once you discover the secret of doing it properly, and I\r\nhad little doubt that to make a serviceable pair of snow-shoes would\r\nprove very easy, if I only knew how.\r\n\r\nI decided that the main difficulty lay in making a network which was\r\nstrong enough to support my weight and which brought an equal strain\r\nupon all sides of the frame. Then I began to wonder why a net was really\r\nnecessary and why an unbroken flat center would not serve the purpose as\r\nwell or even better. The Norwegian skees, I knew, were merely narrow,\r\nflat boards, and yet they supported men upon the snow, and if this was\r\nthe case why shouldn’t any flat object of the same area support my\r\nweight, regardless of its form? This led me to enumerate the objects\r\nwhich were within my reach and which would present a broad, flat surface\r\nto the snow, and I thought of birch bark. This, however, I felt sure,\r\nwas too soft and pliable for the purpose, and I bent all my energies to\r\ndevising some method of stiffening the bark and keeping it spread flat.\r\n\r\nI thought of lashing sticks across it, but I realized that unless the\r\nbark was crisscrossed by a number of sticks such a method would be\r\nuseless, and that so many sticks would make the shoes far too heavy.\r\nThen it occurred to me that the bark might be lashed within a frame, but\r\nthis idea I also discarded, as I knew the bark would split and break\r\nunder my feet, and then, like a flash of light, I thought of skins. Why\r\nwas it not feasible to cut a piece of stout hide to the proper form,\r\nlash it within an oval frame to hold it taut, and thus make snow-shoes\r\nwithout the labor and difficulties of weaving a netting?\r\n\r\nI was so pleased at my idea that I immediately started to put my plan\r\ninto concrete form. Feeling that the frames must be far stronger than\r\nthose I had used before, I selected heavier poles, and then, finding it\r\nwas impossible to bend them in a complete circle or oval, I made each\r\nframe of two separate pieces, each forming half an oval, and joined the\r\nends together by lashings. Stout braces were then placed within these\r\nframes to spread them apart and to strengthen the ends of the withes\r\nwhere they were joined, and these were firmly secured by additional\r\nlashings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SNOW-SHOES WERE MADE]\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to fit the hide inside the frames, and here I once\r\nmore came face to face with a problem which took some time to solve. Of\r\nrabbit or hare skins I had an abundance, but these, I knew, were too\r\nfrail and delicate to serve my purpose. The ’coon-skins were about my\r\nlimbs as leggings, the two porcupine-skins had been converted into\r\nmoccasins, and nothing else remained save the bear-skin robe.\r\n\r\nI disliked cutting into this, and, moreover, I wanted hide minus hair,\r\nbut there was nothing else to be done and, with some misgivings, I cut\r\ntwo oval pieces, of the size and shape of the frames, from my bear-skin.\r\nWith my knife I cut and shaved the hair from these pieces of hide, and\r\nthen, by means of roots, thongs, and strips of bark, I lashed the oval\r\npieces of skin inside the frames. The result of all this work was a pair\r\nof platter-like objects of rawhide, and, while the stiff skin was far\r\nfrom smooth or tight, I judged that they might hold me up. I hurried out\r\nto try them. Placing the two queer contraptions upon the snow, I\r\nclambered upon them, and to my great delight found they scarcely sank\r\ninto the snow at all around the edges, but the centers sagged badly, and\r\nI found it difficult to maintain my balance upon them.\r\n\r\nI had not yet fitted straps or fastenings for my feet, but I felt sure\r\nthat to travel over the snow would be quite impossible if the centers of\r\nthe snow-shoes sagged to such an extent, and that, while the principle\r\nwas all right, I must manage to draw the hide smooth and tight before my\r\ninvention would prove a success.\r\n\r\nIt was now growing dark and I was compelled to stop work, but all\r\nthrough the preparation of my evening meal I was busily thinking and\r\ntrying to evolve some means for perfecting the shoes. Not until I had\r\nclimbed into my bunk did the simple expedient of wetting the skin, while\r\nlashing it in place, occur to me. This I felt positive would result in\r\nstretching the skin as tight as a drumhead when it shrunk in drying.\r\nHaving thus seemingly overcome this difficulty, I tried to conjure up a\r\nmental picture of the arrangement of foot-straps on the snow-shoes I had\r\nused years before. As my brain visualized the graceful, racquet-shaped\r\nshoes, with their amber-colored netting, their tiny, ornamental, worsted\r\ntassels, and their glossy hickory frames, each detail slowly came back\r\nto me. I remembered the slightly upturned toes, the broad, buckskin\r\nfoot-straps, and—yes—the open spaces in the centers of the network into\r\nwhich one’s toes sank as one’s feet bend when walking. As all this came\r\nback to me I wondered that I could have forgotten it, and then, feeling\r\nthat I would have a practical pair of snow-shoes before the next night,\r\nI fell asleep to the roar of the gale outside.\r\n\r\nMorning found the storm over, but with fully four feet of snow covering\r\nthe earth, while the drift before my door was so high that I could not\r\nsee over it. With the memories of the night before still fresh in my\r\nmind I unlashed the pieces of skin from the frames and placed them to\r\nsoak in water while I ate my breakfast. Now that I remembered that a\r\nhole _must_ be left for one’s toe in the center of a snow-shoe the task\r\nseemed greatly simplified. As soon as I had eaten I drew a piece of the\r\nsoggy, softened hide from the water and, cutting it in two, proceeded to\r\nlace one portion of it in the frame between the bowed, semicircular rim\r\nand the nearest brace. As soon as this piece was in place I laced the\r\nother piece in the opposite end, hung the shoe to the roof of the cabin\r\nto dry, and repeated the operations with the other shoe.\r\n\r\nBy the time this was completed the first shoe was partly dry, and I was\r\nwell pleased to find that, as I had foreseen, the skin was shrinking as\r\ntight and hard as a sheet of iron. I then busied myself with my bow and\r\nworked steadily until late in the afternoon, when, the snow-shoes having\r\ndried thoroughly, I hurried out to test them. They were a great success\r\nand supported my weight perfectly, scarcely sinking beneath the surface\r\nof the snow as I stood upon them. Tying the straps about my ankles, I\r\nstarted forward. For a few minutes I had some difficulty in walking, yet\r\nthe knack soon came back to me and I found no trouble in traveling about\r\non the primitive snow-shoes I had evolved.\r\n\r\nMy first need was fire-wood and I shuffled off across the snow to the\r\nwoods. It was a strange sensation to be thus walking into the forest on\r\na level with the “second floor,” so to speak, but it enabled me to\r\nobtain a fine lot of dry, resinous branches which had previously been\r\nfar beyond my reach.\r\n\r\nWell pleased with the success of my snow-shoes, and with a great load of\r\nwood, I returned to the cabin, and then spent the time until dark\r\ndigging away the drift before my door and using a snow-shoe for a\r\nshovel.\r\n\r\nRealizing that it would be useless to attempt to trap in the deep snow,\r\nI determined to set out on a hunt the next morning, hoping to find some\r\nbirds or animals which I might be able to kill with my bow and arrows.\r\nMy new bow was far from completed, but for my immediate purposes the old\r\nbow would serve and within a few days the new one would be ready for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWhen I started out the following morning I found numerous tracks of\r\nsmall creatures, and was soon within the forest searching each snowladen\r\nevergreen for partridges or other game.\r\n\r\nI had traveled for some distance without success when I came upon the\r\nunmistakable tracks of the lynx. His broad, padded, furry feet had\r\nserved him as well as snow-shoes and he had sunk but slightly into the\r\nsnow, but I could not tell whether he had passed that way within a few\r\nminutes or the day before. I felt that there was little danger of the\r\ncreature attacking me here in broad daylight, and I commenced trailing\r\nhis steps, glancing keenly at each tree as I proceeded. Presently I came\r\nto a spot where the lynx had crouched low, and then, for the first time,\r\nI realized that he had been trailing some other creature. Partly\r\nobliterated by the marks of the cat’s feet were other tracks, small,\r\ndeep, and with a furrow between them as if some animal had dragged\r\nhimself slowly through the snow into which his feet had sunk. I was\r\npuzzled to know what had made these tracks, and, curious to learn the\r\noutcome of the tragedy indicated by the telltale marks in the snow, I\r\ncrept cautiously forward.\r\n\r\nI had gone scarcely a hundred yards when I rounded a projecting ledge\r\nand came within sight of a little, open glade. Near the center of the\r\nswale a dark spot stood boldly out upon the snow, and before I had time\r\nto realize what it was the lynx leaped up and, bounding off, disappeared\r\nin the thick woods beyond. But the dark object still remained in the\r\ncenter of the glade, and, approaching it, I discovered that it was a\r\nfull-grown deer. It was evident that the lynx had overtaken and killed\r\nthe buck while the latter was floundering in the deep snow and was\r\nunable to travel rapidly enough to escape, for the deer’s throat was\r\ntorn open and a good portion of the shoulder had been eaten by the lynx.\r\nThere was plenty of good, fresh meat left upon the carcass, however, and\r\nthe skin was scarcely injured, and I congratulated myself upon having\r\nfollowed the lynx tracks, for my curiosity had thus led me to a supply\r\nof food which would last me for a long time. The lynx had unwittingly\r\nsaved me a deal of trouble, and I forgave him all the fright and loss he\r\nhad caused me hitherto.\r\n\r\nImmediately I set to work cleaning the deer, leaving the entrails for\r\nthe lynx, and then, tying the legs together, I shouldered the carcass\r\nand commenced my return journey. It was a heavy load, and the additional\r\nweight caused my snow-shoes to sink deeply into the snow. I found\r\nprogress slow and difficult, and decided to try dragging the deer\r\ninstead of carrying it.\r\n\r\nAs I stood resting for a few moments before resuming my journey, I had a\r\nstrange, uneasy sensation of being watched and I peered nervously about,\r\nbut no sign of a living thing could I see. Laughing at my own\r\nfoolishness, I picked up the strip of bark which I had fastened to the\r\ndeer’s antlers and resumed my journey. The deer slid along over the snow\r\nquite easily and, by keeping to the more open parts of the woods and\r\navoiding trees and branches which might catch upon the deer’s legs and\r\nfeet, I made fairly rapid progress. But despite every effort, I could\r\nnot shake off the feeling that I was being watched and followed. Several\r\ntimes I wheeled about quickly and swept the surrounding forest with my\r\neyes, but I saw nothing tangible, although once I thought I caught a\r\nglimpse of a flitting, shadowy form behind a clump of thick firs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, I thought, the lynx _is_ following me in the hope of regaining\r\nhis lost prey, and I began to fear that the creature might actually\r\ngather sufficient courage to attack me.\r\n\r\nThen that demoniacal face which I had seen outside my cabin in the\r\nmoonlight began to haunt me, and unconsciously I hurried faster and\r\nfaster until, as I approached the edge of the woods and saw the clearing\r\nwith my hut before me, I was making the best speed which my clumsy\r\nfoot-gear and the deer’s carcass would permit.\r\n\r\nOnce in the open, and with the forest behind me, I felt easier, and,\r\npanting for breath, stopped and wheeled about, and as I did so I knew\r\nthat my vague, unreasoning fear had not been unfounded. Squatting at the\r\nedge of the woods was the lynx, every hair bristling with fury, his\r\ngreen eyes gleaming with cruelty and hate, and his lips drawn back\r\nacross the great, white teeth in a threatening snarl.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he sat there, as if half minded to leap forth to the\r\nattack, and then, with a mighty spring, he bounded into a near-by\r\nspruce. The branches swayed and the snow came down in avalanches as he\r\nleaped from bough to bough, and from the shelter of the woods the\r\ncreature’s fearful cry of defiance rang out.\r\n\r\nEven there in the sunshine and within a few yards of my hut I shivered\r\nat the eerie sound, but I realized that, after all, the lynx was too\r\ncowardly to attack me in the open. Relieved, now that I knew my\r\nphantom-like pursuer was the lynx, I dragged the deer to the cabin,\r\nslammed the door to, and threw myself upon the bunk, thoroughly\r\nexhausted with my hard morning’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest and a hearty meal of broiled venison I felt greatly\r\nrefreshed. Then I skinned the deer and hung the hide upon the wall to\r\ndry. I had no means of tanning it, unless I cut it into small pieces,\r\nand I could not remove the hair by burying it, but I had no real need of\r\nmore leather at the time and this did not trouble me. Moreover, I felt\r\nsure that the skin could be softened and tanned later on, if it was\r\nrequired, and that meanwhile the rawhide, with its thick hair, would\r\nserve as a robe or blanket for my bunk.\r\n\r\nI soon found that the lynx had served me far better than I had thought\r\nat first, for the deer furnished a great many useful things which would\r\nprove of the utmost value.\r\n\r\nIn the hard, pointed horns I saw material which could be used in making\r\nawls, arrow-heads, and other objects. The strong leg-tendons were just\r\nwhat I required for my bowstring. The great cords of the neck would\r\nserve as thongs or lashings, and I even saved the hoofs in the hope of\r\nfinding use for them. By the time the skin was scraped and spread up,\r\nthe cords and tendons removed and stretched to dry, and the meat had\r\nbeen cut up and hung up to freeze, the afternoon was spent and darkness\r\nprevented further work.\r\n\r\nI had expected that the lynx would prowl about and disturb me, but I\r\nheard nothing of him that night. The next day I devoted all my time and\r\nenergies to finishing my new bow. It promised to be a powerful and\r\nbeautiful weapon. The following morning I fitted it with a string of\r\nbraided deer-sinew and, stepping outside, proceeded to test its power.\r\n\r\nI used one of my old bone-tipped shafts—for I had determined to discard\r\nthem for better ones. It took all my strength to draw the arrow to the\r\nhead. My target was a tree some fifty yards distant. The loud, musical\r\ntwang of the string, the speed of the whizzing shaft, and the sounding\r\nthump with which it struck the tree filled me with delight, and I\r\nhurried forward to examine the arrow where it stuck, quivering, in the\r\ntree trunk.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was a light, bone-headed affair, it had buried its tip for\r\nfully an inch in the frozen bark, and while the head was ruined and the\r\nshaft split and shattered from the blow, I was overjoyed at the result\r\nof the shot.\r\n\r\nReturning to the hut, I now gave my attention to making a supply of\r\narrows. I had already gathered a good number of straight sticks for the\r\nshafts, and I soon bound the stone heads I had made to these, using fine\r\ndeer-sinews for lashings, and by this means making a far neater and\r\nbetter job than I had been able to accomplish before. Moreover, I had\r\nprofited by my experience in shrinking hide upon the snow-shoes, and\r\nwrapped the arrows with wet sinew, which tightened until it sank into\r\nthe wood when it dried. These arrows I feathered with strips cut from\r\npartridge-wing quills, binding them on with slender, thread-like sinew.\r\nHaving used up all my stone arrow-points, I proceeded to make some more\r\ntips from the deer’s horns. This was an easy matter compared with many\r\nthings which I had accomplished, for I could cut off the tips of the\r\nantlers, grind them to sharp points, and work down the bases to fit the\r\nshafts, all by means of the grindstone. While engaged at this occupation\r\nI wondered how I would have fared had I not found the cabin, the\r\ngrindstone, the file, and the other contents of the hut. In an open\r\nlean-to I would doubtless have frozen to death long ago; the file had\r\nenabled me to kill the bear and secure a warm robe; while the grindstone\r\nhad provided means for making the spear. The hut had unquestionably\r\nsaved my life, but I felt that even without the file and the grindstone\r\nI might have succeeded very well, for my traps and snares had provided\r\nfood and clothing without the aid of the hut’s contents. I could have\r\nused birch-bark utensils instead of the kettle, and nothing which I had\r\nfound in the cabin had helped me in making stone arrow-heads. I was\r\ngrateful for everything I had found, however, for I realized how much I\r\nhad been helped by the odds and ends which the former occupants of the\r\ncabin had not thought worth taking away, and I breathed a blessing upon\r\nthem for what they had left behind.\r\n\r\nWith my strong, powerful bow and quartz-tipped arrows I felt well armed\r\nand able to attack any creature which I might meet—not excepting the\r\nabominable lynx. I was so anxious to test my new weapons on real game\r\nthat I decided to set out the next morning without waiting to complete\r\nmy horn-tipped arrows.\r\n\r\nAs I stood outside my hut, hesitating which way to go, I thought of the\r\ntrail which led away from the cabin and immediately decided to follow\r\nthis. I had given up all thoughts of making my way out of the forest\r\nuntil spring, but my snow-shoes were such a success that I could travel\r\nalmost as readily as if no snow covered the earth, and I became quite\r\nexcited as I reasoned that, after all, there was no reason why I should\r\nnot explore the trail for as far as I could walk and return in a day.\r\nFor all I knew the settlements might be much nearer than I suspected,\r\nand while I was far too wise to dream of cutting myself off from the\r\ncomforts and safety of my cabin by making a long trip through the winter\r\nwoods, I might learn something of value by following the old trail for a\r\nfew miles.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I had not gone in this direction since the snow fell and I\r\nwas as likely to find game there as anywhere else, and, so thinking, I\r\ntrudged off along the track. In the autumn, before snow had hidden the\r\nground, the trail had been easy to follow, for half-obliterated ax-marks\r\non the trees, old moss-grown stumps where trees had been felled to form\r\na rough road, and other signs made the way unmistakable. Now, however,\r\nthe old stumps and logs were many feet beneath the snow, while many of\r\nthe “blazes” on the trees were hidden by it, and only by using great\r\ncare and by noting the more open space in the forest—which indicated\r\nwhere the trees had been cut—was I able to follow the trail.\r\n\r\nI saw my first game when about a mile from my cabin—a sleek, red\r\nfox—which trotted out of the woods ahead and stopped short and gazed at\r\nme curiously as his keen nose caught my scent.\r\n\r\nHastily fitting an arrow to my bow, I drew it to the head and let drive\r\nat Reynard, but at the twang of the bowstring he was up and away like a\r\nflash of red light, and the whizzing, stone-tipped arrow buried itself\r\nharmlessly in the snow. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was also\r\nencouraged when I found the arrow had struck fair and square exactly\r\nwhere the fox had stood, for I knew then that there was no question of\r\nthe accuracy of my weapons.\r\n\r\nIt took me a long time to dig the arrow out, for it had penetrated\r\nseveral feet of snow, but I recovered it at last and resumed my tramp.\r\nSoon after this I started a white hare from a clump of drooping\r\nevergreen boughs and marked him down where he squatted beside a fallen\r\nbranch, a score of paces distant. Had I not actually seen him stop I\r\nshould never have been able to distinguish him, for his white fur\r\nrendered him invisible against the snow, and only by keeping my eyes\r\nfixed upon him could I be sure of his presence. As the speeding arrow\r\nstruck home there was a little commotion in the snow and, hurrying\r\nforward, I found the hare pierced through and through. It was really an\r\nexcellent shot, and I felt wonderfully proud of my skill as I slung the\r\nhare at my belt and continued on my way.\r\n\r\nI had traveled perhaps three miles from my cabin when the woods came\r\nsuddenly to an end and I found myself standing at the edge of a large\r\nclearing. I was so absolutely dumfounded that I could scarce believe my\r\neyes, for scattered about the clearing were half a dozen log houses. I\r\ncannot describe the sensations that swept over me in the few brief\r\nminutes that I stood there, gazing speechless at the tiny settlement.\r\nMingled with my overwhelming joy at sight of the buildings was a feeling\r\nof chagrin to think that I had lived alone for months, had suffered\r\nagonies, and had endured hardships and privations, when by an hour’s\r\nwalk I could have been once more among my fellow-men.\r\n\r\nWith a loud halloo I hurried forward, and then, for the first time, I\r\nnoticed that no smoke rose from the chimneys of the log buildings, that\r\nthe smooth expanse of snow was unbroken by human footprints or trodden\r\npaths, and that no yelping curs—invariable accessories to outlying\r\nsettlements—disputed my approach.\r\n\r\nBefore I reached the first house my spirits fell, for I realized that\r\nthe place was deserted, that no human being was there to welcome me, and\r\na sort of vague fear crept over me. There was something unnatural,\r\nsomething “creepy,” mysterious, and weird about this lifeless village in\r\nthe wilderness, and as I reached the first building I hesitated to push\r\nopen the door for dread of what I might find within.\r\n\r\nBut I had no need to fear; the house was empty, although garments hung\r\nupon the walls, the bunks were filled with moldy bedding, and utensils\r\nand rude furniture were scattered about. My curiosity now overcame my\r\ngroundless fears and I made the rounds of the entire settlement, but in\r\nevery building it was the same—not a sign of life anywhere—and yet\r\nsomehow I felt convinced that human beings had been there not long\r\nbefore. Where they had gone, what had caused them to leave, was a\r\nmystery, for the buildings were in good repair, there was an abundance\r\nof timber all about, and a few dry corn-stalks projecting above the snow\r\nshowed that the former inhabitants had cultivated the ground. That it\r\nwas a permanent settlement and not a temporary wood-cutters’ camp was\r\nevident, for articles of feminine apparel were upon the walls of some of\r\nthe houses and a few cheap toys were in two of the dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe buildings were so much better than my little cabin, that for a\r\nmoment I considered moving my belongings and taking possession of the\r\nplace, but the thought had scarcely entered my mind when I realized that\r\nI would feel far more lonely and depressed when surrounded by the\r\nsilent, deserted houses than in my own cabin in the heart of the woods.\r\nBut if I could not consider taking up my quarters in the village, I\r\ncould at least make my life far easier by helping myself to the many\r\nuseful articles the former inhabitants had left. Thus thinking, I\r\nstarted toward the first house, determined to make a systematic search\r\nof every building.\r\n\r\nI was about half-way across an open space near the center of the\r\nclearing, which I supposed had been cultivated land, when the toe of my\r\nsnow-shoe caught upon some object and I plunged forward into the snow.\r\nPicking myself up, I glanced around to see what had thus tripped me, and\r\nto my surprise saw a hewn timber, or plank, projecting through the snow.\r\n\r\nCurious to learn what this meant, I dug away the snow about it and in a\r\nfew moments disclosed a second timber nailed at right angles to the\r\nfirst. There was no doubt about it—the object over which I had stumbled\r\nwas a cross! At first its import did not dawn upon me. No doubt, I\r\nthought, the inhabitants had been French Canadians and had erected the\r\ncross above a little shrine, and, rising, I passed around it and was\r\nabout to continue on my way when I caught a glimpse of letters cut into\r\nthe wood. Scraping away the ice and snow which half concealed them, I\r\nstudied the inscription for a moment and a wave of deadly horror swept\r\nover me, for, in rudely carved, misspelled words I read the following:\r\n\r\n                    Joseph and Marie Bemis His Wife\r\n                      Dead of Smallpox October 25\r\n                     God Have Mercy on Their Souls\r\n\r\nInstantly I realized why the village was deserted, why no human being\r\nwas there, why clothing, household goods, and even the children’s toys\r\nhad been left behind. The place had been swept by the plague and those\r\nwho survived, if indeed any _had_ escaped, had left the stricken spot to\r\nits silent dead.\r\n\r\nAnd with the thought came terror; all unwittingly I had exposed myself\r\nto the awful malady. I had entered the houses reeking with pestilence,\r\nhad inhaled the stale air within the buildings where men and women had\r\nbreathed their last, and had handled the very clothes and bedding which\r\nhad covered their bodies during illness and death. Beyond a doubt I had\r\nalready contracted the dread disease; by now the germs of smallpox might\r\nbe coursing through my blood. Sick at the thought of what my fate might\r\nbe and haunted by the specter of loathsome death that stalked in the\r\nsilent village, I turned and dashed madly back along the trail.\r\n\r\nFrom my path a flock of partridges whirred up and, perching upon a\r\nnear-by tree, gazed curiously at the fur-clad being stumbling headlong\r\nthrough the woods. A hare leaped from the snow and scampered to one side\r\nwithin easy bow-shot; but I heeded neither bird nor beast, for my one\r\nthought was to leave the accursed buildings behind, to regain my cabin,\r\nand to throw myself upon my rude bunk to await the deadly sickness I\r\nfelt sure would be my fate.\r\n\r\nBreathless, exhausted, and panting I reached the hut, threw off my outer\r\ngarments, and huddled in my bed to spend an awful afternoon and night,\r\nas, alternately shaking with cold chills and burning with fever, I\r\nwaited for the first symptoms of the malady.\r\n\r\nTo add to my misery the lynx howled in the woods near by, and in its\r\nawful cries I seemed to hear a dire foreboding of my death; a note of\r\ntriumphant malice, as if the creature knew my plight and realized that\r\nere long I would be helpless, that, ill and dying, I could offer no\r\nresistance, and that, tearing his way through the flimsy roof, he could\r\nspring on me and glut himself upon my wasted flesh.\r\n\r\nLike some terrible nightmare the long hours passed, for I was more\r\nterrified than ever before in my life, and no savage creature, no danger\r\nof the forest, not even the dread of losing my foot, had filled me with\r\nsuch mortal fear as the thought of lying alone and uncared for in my hut\r\nwhile dying slowly of the smallpox.\r\n\r\nBut toward morning sheer exhaustion compelled me to sleep, and the day\r\nwas well advanced when I again awoke. Then, feeling strong, hungry, and\r\nas well as ever, much of my first fear left me and, pulling myself\r\ntogether, I looked the matter squarely in the face.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I reasoned, I might not have contracted the disease. I had\r\nbeen vaccinated a few years before, and even if this was no longer\r\nefficacious I might be naturally immune to smallpox. And then another\r\ncheering thought came to me. Perhaps the two who had died were the only\r\nvictims and the others had left before the disease had spread. Moreover,\r\nI now remembered there was no date other than October 25 upon the rude\r\nepitaph, and, for all I knew, the cross might have been erected several\r\nyears before and the village might have been occupied for long\r\nthereafter by healthy people. All these sensible thoughts comforted and\r\ncheered me and revived my spirits greatly. I decided there was no use of\r\nworrying over what might never happen and that if I _had_ contracted the\r\ndisease there would be time enough to fear the results when sickness\r\ncame on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I was busily preparing my breakfast, for I was very hungry,\r\nhaving quite forgotten to eat during my fright the day before. I was\r\nhalf through my meal when a new idea came to me.\r\n\r\nI had found this very cabin deserted. Was it not probable that its\r\noccupants had also been afflicted with smallpox? For an instant I was\r\nquite overcome with the thought that I might have been dwelling for many\r\nweeks where people had suffered or died with the contagious disease, but\r\nthe next moment I burst into a hearty laugh, for I realized that if, as\r\nI suspected, there _had_ been smallpox in the cabin, the fact that I had\r\nnot contracted it was proof that I had little need to fear. Thus\r\nreassured and casting all worry aside, I gathered up my weapons and went\r\nforth to search for game.\r\n\r\nThis morning I decided to take a new route and to cross the lake, which,\r\nI felt sure, was frozen hard enough to bear my weight in safety, for I\r\nstill had a lingering feeling that the way to the settlements lay across\r\nthe lake, and I was anxious to explore the farther side.\r\n\r\nTraveling upon the smooth, unobstructed surface of the lake was easy,\r\nand I soon reached the opposite shores. I found the forest far heavier\r\nhere, while rocky ledges, cliffs, and ravines made travel very\r\ndifficult. In fact, I found it impossible to penetrate far into the\r\nwoods, and in the hopes of finding some trail, pass, or opening I\r\nskirted the shore of the lake from one end to the other. But everywhere\r\nI found the same wild, impassable country, and, becoming firmly\r\nconvinced that the settlements did not lie in this direction, I headed\r\naround the upper end of the lake toward home.\r\n\r\nI had seen no game during my tramp, although tracks of foxes, hares, and\r\nother creatures were numerous, and, reaching my own side of the lake, I\r\nentered the forest and proceeded to seek carefully for game. I had\r\nwalked for some distance and was well within the woods when I again felt\r\nthe sensation of being followed and watched which I had experienced when\r\ndragging home the deer. At first I thought this was pure imagination,\r\nfor I had seen no signs of lynx tracks in the vicinity, but\r\nnevertheless, I could not resist the desire to glance furtively about\r\nfrom time to time. Finally the feeling became so strong that it got upon\r\nmy nerves and almost unconsciously I began to swing around on my tracks\r\ntoward my cabin. Presently I came upon my own trail, and then I knew for\r\na certainty that instinct had not played me false, for beside the broad,\r\noval marks of my snow-shoes were the unmistakable tracks of the lynx.\r\nThe beast was trailing me! At first I felt fear, but this quickly gave\r\nway to anger at the lynx for daring to track me, and I became possessed\r\nwith the determination to slay him and be rid of his presence once and\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to approach within reach of the lynx would, I felt, be\r\nuseless, and I knew he was far too sagacious to be caught in my traps. I\r\ndecided to match my own skill and cunning against his and to bring him\r\nto his death through his own persistence in following me.\r\n\r\nCarefully stepping in my former tracks I continued on for some distance\r\nand then, turning about, retraced my steps, still stepping in the marks\r\nalready made by my snow-shoes. Presently I came to a spot where a low\r\nlimb projected above the tracks and, grasping this, I drew myself up,\r\nuntied the snow-shoes from my feet, and very carefully worked my way\r\nalong the branch to the trunk of the tree. It was leafless and bare and\r\nafforded no shelter, and I knew that the lynx would see me long before I\r\nsaw him and so, dropping to the snow on the farther side of the trunk, I\r\nmade my way to a near-by evergreen and, climbing up, concealed myself\r\namong its thick branches.\r\n\r\nWith an arrow fitted to my bow I waited, peering forth through the\r\naisles of the forest in the direction whence I had come.\r\n\r\nThe time passed slowly. A great, scarlet-crested, pileated woodpecker\r\nflitted to a neighboring tree and the forest echoed to the resounding\r\nblows of his powerful beak. A flock of redpolls twittered among the\r\nbranches above my head, and crossbills clambered, parrot-like, among the\r\ndrooping cones, shearing off the scales with their scissors-like beaks\r\nin their search for pine seeds. A gray Canada jay alighted upon one of\r\nmy snow-shoes and pecked at the dry bear’s hide, eying me saucily\r\nmeanwhile. From a treetop a squirrel chattered, and from all about came\r\nthe plaintive calls of chickadees. The forest was full of busy life,\r\neach tiny creature busily gleaning its livelihood and all unmindful of\r\nmy presence.\r\n\r\nFive, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and then at last I saw him. Slouching\r\nalong in a loose-jointed stride, the lynx skulked on after me in the\r\ndistance, keeping as much as possible behind trees and fallen branches,\r\nsniffing at my footprints and ever and anon stopping to peer about,\r\nwhile turning his head first this way, then that, as if to smell the air\r\nfor a suspicious scent. Presently he reached the spot where my two\r\ntrails met and instantly the creature became all alert. For a few steps\r\nhe trotted back upon the old trail and then, turning, came back and went\r\nalong the new trail for a few feet. Evidently he was somewhat puzzled,\r\nfor his every action betrayed the fact. Then curiosity gave place to\r\nsuspicion, and with a single lithe bound he leaped into a tree and,\r\ncrouching close to the trunk, peered about as if striving to catch sight\r\nof me. But he could see nothing that resembled the being he was hunting\r\nand, reassured, he sprang down and, after a moment’s hesitation, came\r\ntrotting toward my hiding-place.\r\n\r\nAlready the wild things about had seen the great cat and had scented\r\ndanger in the tawny, threatening form. With a piercing cry the\r\nwoodpecker ceased his tattoo and winged his way swiftly out of sight.\r\nThe squirrels in the treetops ceased their chatter and hugged the bark,\r\nmotionless. The twitter of the redpolls and crossbills was silenced.\r\nEven the bold whisky-jack, deciding that discretion was the better part\r\nof valor, perched far out of reach and contented himself with taunting\r\nthe lynx with raucous cries. Only the chickadees seemed undisturbed.\r\nRegardless of the approaching form, they continued to flutter about and\r\nto utter their sweet calls, as if they realized they were too tiny to\r\nattract the savage creature with his lust for blood.\r\n\r\nNow the lynx was within a hundred yards; I could see his baleful green\r\neyes, his half-opened mouth, and his keen, white teeth. Each instant he\r\nwas approaching closer. Never had I suffered from buck-fever before, but\r\nnow my hands shook, my teeth chattered, and a strange, choking sensation\r\ngripped my throat. The lynx was within easy bow-shot, but still I\r\nhesitated, striving to steady my nerves, determined to take no chances,\r\nand watching with fixed gaze as he came nearer and nearer. At last he\r\nreached the spot where I had doubled on my tracks, sniffed about, raised\r\nhimself on his hind legs, and before I realized what he was about he\r\nsprang to the very branch upon which I had drawn myself. Instantly he\r\ncaught my scent upon the bark, crouched low with bristling fur, and\r\nturned his fierce eyes directly upon my hiding-place. By some\r\nsupernatural instinct he seemed to have divined my ruse and to have\r\ndiscovered me. Perhaps he did not actually see me, perhaps it was mere\r\nchance which led him to jump into the tree, but at the moment I felt\r\nconvinced that he saw me as plainly as I saw him, that he had overcome\r\nall his natural cowardice and was bent on attacking me, and that in\r\nanother instant he would launch himself across the intervening space and\r\nfly at my throat with those great, hooked claws and gleaming teeth.\r\nScarce a score of feet separated us. At any moment he might crouch and\r\nspring. Drawing back the bow with trembling fingers, I let the arrow\r\nfly. Even as I drew the bow I knew the lynx detected the motion, and as\r\nthe string twanged I saw his great form shoot into space, I had a\r\nglimpse of the outstretched feet and bared talons, I heard a snarl of\r\nrage, and the next second I fell crashing to the snow as the lynx\r\nplunged through the screen of branches about me.\r\n\r\nThe force of my fall buried me under the snow; before I could rise, even\r\nbefore I realized fully what had happened, something landed on me with a\r\nthud that knocked the little remaining breath from my body, and with a\r\nwild, frightened yell I struck out blindly with fists and feet. What\r\nfollowed was the madness of nightmare. Blinded by snow, frightened half\r\nout of my wits, dazed by my fall, struggling, kicking, striking, I was\r\nwhirled about like a giant teetotum, while my yells and shouts mingled\r\nwith snarls, growls, and piercing screams. Glimpses of evergreen-trees\r\nand blue sky, avalanches of snow and a brown, furry form, revolved in a\r\nkaleidoscopic blur. Suddenly all motion ceased; I found myself lying,\r\npanting but unharmed, in a crater of snow, and, sitting up, I rubbed my\r\neyes and glanced about. Instantly I realized what had happened. The lynx\r\nhad missed his mark, had fallen squarely on top of me, and together we\r\nhad fought and struggled in the snow, each more frightened than the\r\nother, each striving to break loose, and both scratching, striking, and\r\nscreaming with all our strength.\r\n\r\nNo wonder I had been dazed and my mind turned topsy-turvy. The marvel\r\nwas that I was still alive and well and not minus eyes, ears, and strips\r\nof flesh. My furs had saved me from the lynx’s claws, and the snow had\r\nacted as a pad, but my clothing was in tatters, bunches of lynx fur were\r\nscattered about, and all around the snow was churned, tossed, and\r\nfurrowed where we had spun hither and thither like a mad pinwheel.\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant I was filled with dread for fear the creature was\r\nwaiting close at hand to resume the attack, and then, the humor of the\r\nsituation dawning upon me, I roared with laughter until tears filled my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nMy bow was close at hand, where it had dropped from the tree, my\r\nsnow-shoes were lying half buried in the snow, and my various other\r\npossessions were scattered about, but not a sign of the lynx could I\r\nsee. But as I rose and started to gather up my belongings I saw drops of\r\nscarlet upon the snow beside the creature’s tracks. A little farther on\r\nI picked up the broken shaft of my arrow, covered with blood, and then I\r\nknew that my antagonist had not escaped unscathed.\r\n\r\nFor a few yards I followed the telltale blood-drops, until both the\r\nstains and tracks ended where the lynx had evidently taken to the trees.\r\nI was not sorry; I had had my fill of adventures for one day, and,\r\nturning on my tracks, I made my way back toward the cabin. How badly the\r\nlynx was wounded I could not tell. Perhaps it was merely a scratch from\r\nwhich he suffered little, or perchance the stone tip of my arrow buried\r\nitself in his vitals and caused his death. At any rate, he never\r\ntroubled me again and his weird cry never disturbed my slumbers in the\r\nfuture. This being the case, I cared little whether through fright he\r\nhad fled the country or whether he had slunk away to die within his den.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSPRING APPROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after my adventure with the lynx no event worth recording\r\noccurred and I led a humdrum, lonely life. I had much to be thankful\r\nfor, however, for I had little difficulty in obtaining game. With the\r\ndisappearance of the lynx I again resorted to traps. I was comfortably\r\nhoused and I suffered little from the cold. No symptoms of smallpox had\r\ndeveloped, my foot and ankle were as well and strong as ever, and I was\r\nin the best of health and condition.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be done save to hunt and trap, gather fire-wood, and\r\nsleep and eat. To occupy my time I made a large number of stone\r\narrow-heads and numerous arrows, for I realized that I would lose and\r\nbreak many, and that when I finally started away in the spring I must be\r\nwell provided with weapons.\r\n\r\nI also tried fishing in the lake, cutting holes through the ice with my\r\nknife and spear, and setting lines which would raise a signal when there\r\nwas a bite, as I had done when pickerel-fishing in my youth.\r\n\r\nOn these lines I used hooks of horn which I made by grinding down the\r\nforked portions of the deer’s antlers, where the prongs sprung from the\r\nmain branches. It was tedious work, cutting these on the grindstone and\r\nwith my knife, but the results more than repaid me for all the labor,\r\nfor I caught a number of pickerel, several bass, and a few splendid\r\nlake-trout, and the fish proved a most welcome change of diet.\r\n\r\nThere were many heavy snowfalls during the winter, and had it not been\r\nfor my snow-shoes I would have fared badly. Even as it was I was\r\ncompelled to remain indoors for days at a time as the storms raged\r\nwithout, and by the time the days began to lengthen and the worst of the\r\nwinter was over my hut was completely snowed under. Only the rude\r\nchimney and the tunnel-like entrance to my door were visible, but the\r\ndeeper the snow piled around the cabin the warmer and more comfortable\r\nit was within.\r\n\r\nBut if the weather kept me much indoors I made good use of my time, and\r\nduring the long winter I made many discoveries and accomplished many\r\nthings which added wonderfully to my happiness and comfort.\r\n\r\nOne of my greatest troubles was lack of light, for the winter days were\r\nshort, and within the windowless hut it was dark by mid-afternoon, and I\r\nwas thus obliged to cease work and sit idle for many hours each day. The\r\nfire gave enough light to enable me to see to cook and even to perform\r\ncertain tasks which required little care, such as cutting up fire-wood,\r\nwhittling sticks to form triggers for traps, and similar work, but the\r\nfitful, unsteady glare of the flames was not sufficient to enable me to\r\naccomplish any fine or delicate work.\r\n\r\nI had often thought of making an artificial light of some sort and had\r\ntried torches of birch bark, resinous sticks, and other devices, but\r\nnone of these was satisfactory. The bark burned brightly and cast a fine\r\nlight, but it flared wildly, sputtered, crackled, and soon burned out,\r\nwhile the pine knots made the interior of the cabin unbearable with\r\ntheir dense smoke.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to me that I might make tallow candles, for I had an\r\nabundance of fine bear’s grease and deer’s fat stored away, and this, I\r\njudged, would serve as well as mutton tallow. For wicks I decided to use\r\nstrips torn from the remnants of my civilized clothes, and, having\r\nconceived the idea, I immediately proceeded to put it into execution. I\r\nknew that I would have to melt the fat and cast it in molds to form the\r\ncandles, but I had now learned to make use of the resources at my\r\ncommand, and birch bark at once came to mind as suitable for making the\r\nmolds. By rolling strips of the bark around a smooth stick, wrapping\r\nthem with sinew, and then withdrawing the cylinders from the stick I\r\nformed the molds, but at my first attempt I found the melted grease ran\r\nout between the edges of the bark and from beneath the bottom of the\r\nmolds as fast as I poured it in.\r\n\r\nFor a time I was greatly puzzled to devise a method of sealing up the\r\ncylinders, and then a happy idea occurred to me, and stepping to the\r\ndoor I dug a quantity of snow and packed it solidly in a corner of the\r\nhut away from the fire. Slipping one of the birch-bark molds over the\r\nstick, I pushed both down into the cake of snow, and then, withdrawing\r\nthe stick, left the cylinder of bark remaining in the snow. By means of\r\na small, slender stick I pushed one end of a narrow strip of cotton into\r\nthe snow at the bottom of the mold, and poured in the melted tallow.\r\nAlthough the hot grease melted the surrounding snow somewhat, yet little\r\nescaped from the mold, and as soon as it commenced to thicken I moved\r\nthe wick to the center of the mass of grease and held it in position\r\nuntil the tallow hardened. I could hardly wait until the tallow was\r\nfully hard before withdrawing the mold from the snow to examine the\r\nresult of the experiment. By pushing on the lower end of the tallow with\r\nthe stick about which I had formed the mold I slipped the rude candle\r\nfrom the bark, set it upright on the table, and touched a blazing stick\r\nto the wick. Instantly it burst into flame and burned brightly, casting\r\na steady light about the room. I was immensely pleased, for with half a\r\ndozen such lights I could see to work despite the darkness outside. My\r\njoy was short-lived, however, for the wick burned rapidly, curled over\r\nto one side, flared and smoked, and melted the candle away.\r\n\r\nEvidently something was wrong, some small detail had been overlooked,\r\nand, casting the remnants of my first candle into the can of melted\r\ngrease, I sat down to try and reason it out. Soon it came to my mind\r\nthat all the candle-wicks I had ever seen were twisted or braided. I\r\nthought that with a braided wick my candles might succeed, and, tearing\r\na strip of cloth into narrow ribbons, I braided it tightly. But I soon\r\nfound the result would be far too coarse for a wick, and again I was at\r\na loss. Not for a long time did I hit upon the plan of unraveling cloth\r\nand braiding the yarns together to produce the compact, firm cord which\r\nI desired. When at last this was accomplished and another candle was\r\ncast, with the braided wick, it proved a great success and thereafter I\r\nnever wanted for light. But it was slow work making the birch-bark molds\r\nand casting the candles in them, and I sought for some easier and more\r\nrapid means of making them, and kept my eyes open for something better\r\nthan the birch-bark cylinders for molds. It was some time before I\r\nthought of anything better, but finally I remembered that as a boy I had\r\noften made willow whistles and had slipped the cylinders of bark from\r\nthe branches without splitting them. I had noticed willows near the\r\noutlet to the lake and soon I gathered a number of smooth, straight\r\nbranches free from knots or sprouts. At first the bark refused to budge,\r\nfor the wood was frozen, and, moreover, no sap was flowing through the\r\nbark, but I discovered that by steaming the branches or by soaking them\r\nin boiling water the bark stripped easily from the twigs, and thereafter\r\nI had little difficulty in casting my candles rapidly and easily,\r\nwithout wasting tallow or requiring the snow about the molds.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, my candle-making led me to two other most important\r\ndiscoveries, one of which was soap, the other a method of removing the\r\nhair or fur from hides without waiting for them to decompose.\r\n\r\nI discovered how to make soap quite by accident. While working at my\r\ncandles I upset a quantity of grease on the hearth, and this, running\r\ndown into a hollow at one side, formed quite a pool, which remained\r\nliquid, owing to the warmth of the fire. In order to cool it so I could\r\nscrape it up, I poured water upon it, but when I tried to remove it I\r\ndiscovered that it was full of wood-ashes and was soft, slippery, and\r\nstringy. Deciding that it was not worth bothering about, I abandoned the\r\nidea of recovering it, and proceeded to wash my hands. Much to my\r\nsurprise, the water bubbled and frothed and my hands became cleaner than\r\nthey had been for months. Then, all at once, it dawned upon me that I\r\nhad made soap—crude, greasy, imperfect soap, to be sure, but still soap\r\nwhich possessed wonderful cleansing properties.\r\n\r\nAny school-boy should have known that wood-ashes contained potash and\r\nthat potash or lye and water would transform fat to soap, but during all\r\nmy life in the woods it had never once occurred to me.\r\n\r\nNow, however, I lost no more time. By soaking fine wood-ashes in water\r\nand then boiling this with grease I soon succeeded in producing soft\r\nsoap which served my purposes exceedingly well.\r\n\r\nIt was a great comfort to be able to wash myself thoroughly, although\r\nthe free potash in the soap stung and burnt my skin.\r\n\r\nBut of far greater importance to me than the soap itself was the fact\r\nthat in making it I learned how to remove the hair or fur from hides\r\nboth rapidly and easily. The first batch of soap which I made was\r\nprepared with deer’s tallow, but I could ill afford to use this material\r\nfor such a purpose. I carefully gathered together all the fat which I\r\ncould obtain from the hares, partridges, and other game which I secured.\r\nIn addition I saved all the remnants of meat from my meals, as well as\r\nthe bones, all of which I boiled together with the lye-water. Among the\r\nother odds and ends were small pieces of skin, such as the feet of the\r\nhares, etc., and after the mass had boiled thoroughly I strained off the\r\nclear, liquid soap. While doing this I discovered that every sign of\r\nhair had been removed from the pieces of skin and this fact led me to\r\nexperiment, and I soon found that by soaking hides in a mixture of water\r\nand wood-ashes I could remove all the hair or fur without injuring the\r\nskin in the least. Moreover, the action of the potash removed the grease\r\nfrom the skin and left it clean and I was thus saved the tedious process\r\nof scraping the hides with my knife. Of course the first few trials of\r\nthis method were something of a failure, for the lye was too strong and\r\nthe skins were weak, rotten, and worthless, but by gradually decreasing\r\nthe quantity of ashes and the length of time the skins were allowed to\r\nsoak I found that the hair could be loosened so it was easily rubbed off\r\nwithout affecting the toughness of the skin itself.\r\n\r\nNow that I had learned how to remove the hair from the skins, I was\r\nanxious to devise a method of tanning them without cutting them up as I\r\nhad been obliged to do hitherto. My only means of tanning was to soak\r\nthe pieces of hide in the iron pot. But the pot was small and it was\r\nneeded for many other purposes. I could not use it while the skins were\r\nsoaking, and I was obliged to cleanse it most carefully after the\r\ntanning, yet there was no other receptacle which would serve and I had\r\nno means of making any. I had already thought of hollowing out a log to\r\nform a trough, but after several hours’ work which resulted only in a\r\ncavity hardly large enough to tan a chipmunk’s skin, I gave up in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nBirch bark seemed to offer the only solution, but I found that pieces of\r\nbark of sufficient size for my purpose were always full of holes and\r\ncracks. I pondered over the matter for a long time before I thought of\r\nmaking a vat, or tank, after the manner of a birch-bark canoe. I had\r\noften used Indian canoes and knew, in a general way, how the pieces of\r\nbark were sewed together and rendered water-tight by means of pitch and\r\ngum. While I had too little confidence in my skill to attempt building a\r\ncanoe, yet I decided it was quite possible to follow out similar methods\r\nand make a good-sized tank or basin.\r\n\r\nMy first step was to construct an oval frame about three feet in length\r\nby a foot and a half wide, which I formed from light birch withes. To\r\nthis I lashed other withes, in the manner of the ribs to a canoe, and\r\nthen by weaving small branches in and out and lashing them to the ribs I\r\nat last produced a sort of basket-like affair without any square corners\r\nor straight lines. This form was not intentional on my part, but was the\r\nresult of necessity. As this turned out, it was fortunate, for I\r\nultimately discovered that to make a good, tight joint at a sharp corner\r\nor a right angle was exceedingly difficult. The framework being\r\ncompleted, I placed it upon a large sheet of bark and by dint of a great\r\ndeal of work and many trials I drew the bark tightly over the frame and\r\nsecured it firmly to the edges with strips of moosewood bark and hemlock\r\nroots. Other kinds of bark were then secured over the frame until the\r\nwhole was covered, and then came the most difficult work of all, which\r\nwas to sew the overlapping edges of the various pieces of bark together.\r\nDespite every care, I found that holes made by my file-awl would tear\r\nout when I drew the root-threads tight, and it was not until I hit upon\r\nthe plan of burning holes through the bark with the hot awl that I met\r\nwith any success.\r\n\r\nBut practice makes perfect, even when one labors with primitive tools in\r\nthe heart of the wilderness, and before I had half finished with my work\r\nI learned to bore holes with a deer’s-horn awl and to run the roots at\r\nan angle, or crisscross, from hole to hole, so that the strain did not\r\ncome with the grain of the bark. It was slow, tedious work even then,\r\nhowever, and several days’ steady labor was required before the last\r\nseam was closed.\r\n\r\nRude and uncouth as was this great, bathtub-like affair, I was greatly\r\npleased at my handiwork and I was in a great hurry to patch up the seams\r\nand holes with pitch and to try it.\r\n\r\nThere was an abundance of pitch and gum to be had with little trouble,\r\nand I gathered a great quantity of it. This I melted and smeared over\r\nthe seams of the bark, and when at last I had daubed every crack, seam,\r\nand knot-hole with the sticky mess I felt that I had successfully\r\naccomplished a great undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe birch-bark tub held water, only leaking slightly in a few spots,\r\nwhich were readily closed up by daubing on more pitch, and I at once\r\nstarted in to prepare enough tanning liquor to fill it. Then I almost\r\nundid all my hard work by my own stupidity, for as soon as the first\r\npotful of liquor was ready I poured it into the bark tub and the hot\r\nliquor softened the pitch and the tan ran out over the floor.\r\n\r\nFortunately it opened up only one seam, and this I soon repaired, but it\r\nserved to teach me a lesson, and thereafter I cooled each lot of liquor\r\nby placing it outside in the intensely cold air before pouring it into\r\nthe vat.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all this was accomplished in a day or in\r\nseveral days. I was obliged to attend to my traps, hunt for game, cook\r\nmy meals, cut and gather fire-wood, and do many other necessary things\r\nmeanwhile, and, moreover, I found that a great deal of time was required\r\nto gather the oak and sumach bark. As I could only boil a small quantity\r\nof bark at one time and as I was obliged to use my pot for other\r\npurposes betweentimes, the work progressed very slowly, and fully two\r\nweeks elapsed from the time I finished the birch-bark tub until I had\r\nfilled it with sufficient liquor to tan a large skin.\r\n\r\nLong before the tub was quarter-full I commenced to make use of it,\r\nhowever, and after removing the fur from the skins, by means of\r\nwood-ashes and water, I had placed several hares’ hides in it. The\r\nresult was all I expected, and while the thin, papery rabbit-skins had\r\nlittle strength, yet I was greatly elated at being able to remove the\r\nhair and make leather. My intention was to attempt tanning the deer’s\r\nhide as soon as I had accumulated enough liquor to cover it. Since I\r\nreally had no need of a second fur robe, the bear’s skin serving all my\r\npurposes, I determined to try to remove the hair from the deer-skin.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, I had no second receptacle in which to soak the hide in\r\nwood-ashes and water, but by stringing up the hide by its four corners\r\nand filling it with water I softened it, and then, turning it over, I\r\nfilled the hair side with the potash solution. I was in some doubt about\r\nthe success of this experiment. I watched the skin with great care and\r\nfrequently tested the hair. At last I was rewarded by finding that it\r\ncame away readily. As soon as this happened I drained off the solution,\r\nscraped and rubbed off the hair, and placed the hide in the tanning\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nEach day I turned and soused it about and gradually it assumed the\r\ntexture and appearance of leather. When at last it was drawn out,\r\ndrained and worked and rubbed until dry, I possessed a fine, large piece\r\nof excellent buckskin which I knew would make splendid moccasins and\r\nstrong, durable garments for use in the spring, when my furs would have\r\nto be discarded and I started on my journey to the settlements.\r\n\r\nMy success was so great that I longed to tan the bear-skin with the fur\r\nupon it, for it was a stiff, ungainly thing in its plain dried state,\r\nbut I could not spare it while cold weather lasted, and I was compelled\r\nto continue using it as it was.\r\n\r\nNow that I had the means of making leather, I was most anxious to secure\r\nhides to tan, and I made long trips into the woods, searching for larger\r\ngame than hares and partridges. But either the larger creatures had\r\nmigrated to some part of the country where there was less snow, or else\r\nthey had seldom been in the vicinity, for, despite every effort, I found\r\nfew signs of their presence and secured still less. Only twice did I see\r\nwhere deer had passed, and one raccoon, a fox, and two martens were the\r\nsole results of all my hunts, aside from the hares and partridges which\r\nI had little difficulty in obtaining.\r\n\r\nAt first I was greatly puzzled by this scarcity of big game, for I was\r\nin a wilderness where deer, moose, bear, and even caribou might be\r\nfound, but after giving the matter due thought I came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was, no doubt, due to the proximity of the deserted settlement I\r\nhad found.\r\n\r\nEver since I had first devised my simple calendar I had kept account of\r\nthe days, weeks, and months, and now I knew that the worst of the winter\r\nwas past. With each day spring was approaching, and before many months\r\nwere over I would be on my way toward civilization and my life in the\r\nwilderness would be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nWith the thought I was filled with pride and happiness to think that I\r\nhad overcome all obstacles which had arisen, that the long winter—which\r\nI had so greatly dreaded—was nearly over, that, after all, it had not\r\nbeen such a terrible experience, and that I had managed to live in\r\ncomparative comfort and in plenty by my unaided efforts.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, I really felt rather sorry at the thought of\r\nleaving the cabin where I had lived so long, for I had become so\r\naccustomed to it that it seemed quite like home, and the woods about,\r\nthe friendly jays, the twittering redpolls, and gray-clad chickadees,\r\nand even the dainty little wild mouse that crept forth from its\r\nhiding-place to share my meals, all seemed like old friends. Even\r\nwithout my calendar I should have known that the backbone of winter was\r\nbroken, for each morning, when I stepped forth, the rays of sunlight\r\nwere brighter, the sky held a softer, warmer hue, at midday the snow\r\nupon the cabin roof melted and trickled down in little streams that\r\nturned to great icicles at night, and the snow was covered with a crust\r\neach morning.\r\n\r\nSlowly, imperceptibly, the height of the drifted snow about the hut\r\ndecreased, the roof and walls rose above the surrounding surface of\r\nwhite, and stumps and bushes long hidden from view jutted upward through\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\nGreat cracks spread across the vast, white plain that marked the lake; a\r\nfew days later broad, black spaces spoke of open water, and when, one\r\nmorning, I heard the honk of geese, and, looking up, saw a great,\r\nV-shaped flock of black specks winging swiftly toward the lake, I knew\r\nthat spring was near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nI FIND A COMPANION\r\n\r\n\r\nImpatient as I was to start on my journey, I had no intention of taking\r\nany risks, for I well knew the treachery of spring weather, and that a\r\nbelated snow-storm might yet arrive.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined to wait until the weather was unquestionably\r\nsettled and there was no further chance of a snowfall, which I knew\r\nwould not be for several months.\r\n\r\nThis enforced period of waiting seemed to pass more slowly than all the\r\ntime I had spent in the wilderness, and I strove to keep my hands and\r\nbrain busy. Already the spring thaws had set in, the lake was free from\r\nice, bare patches of earth showed here and there upon exposed hillsides,\r\nand brooks and rivulets were transformed to roaring torrents.\r\n\r\nThe weather had become so warm that I was glad to discard my fur\r\ngarments, and in their place I donned trouser-like leggings and a loose,\r\nshirt-like blouse which I had fashioned from deer-skin. They were\r\nroughly made, devoid of fit, but strong, warm, and comfortable. In this\r\nrude garb, with my face hidden under an untrimmed beard, and hair\r\nfalling to my shoulders, I was a veritable Crusoe of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nWith the breaking of winter game became more plentiful and I found many\r\ndeer tracks in the woods, and while following one of these I made a\r\ngreat discovery which, had I known of it sooner, would have made my life\r\nin the woods much more bearable.\r\n\r\nThe track I was following led to a portion of the forest which I had not\r\nvisited before, and soon it was joined by numerous other tracks, until I\r\nfound myself walking along a well-beaten path or trail.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently a much-traveled runway, and, feeling confident that I\r\nwould find deer close at hand, I moved forward with the utmost caution,\r\nstealing through the thickets, taking advantage of every bit of cover,\r\nand peering from behind trees at each turn or twist in the trail. I had\r\nthus proceeded for fully half a mile when I came in view of a small,\r\nopen space, bare of vegetation, and, standing near the center, with head\r\nbent to the ground as if feeding upon the mud, was a splendid deer.\r\n\r\nHere indeed was luck, for the creature was unaware of my presence and I\r\nwas within easy bow-shot. Raising myself cautiously above the fallen\r\ntree behind which I crouched, I fitted my best arrow to my bow, drew it\r\nto the head, and aimed at the sleek, brown body. At the twang of the\r\nstring the deer tossed up his head and leaped forward, but the speeding\r\narrow was swifter than his muscles; it struck fair behind his\r\nshoulder-blade, and he plunged forward to the earth, killed as quickly\r\nas if by a rifle-ball.\r\n\r\nMuch as I needed his hide and meat, I could not help regretting that it\r\nhad been necessary to destroy the life of such a splendid creature, and\r\nI marveled that I had ever been able to hunt and kill such harmless,\r\nbeautiful animals and call it sport.\r\n\r\nWhile bending over the deer I noticed for the first time that the spot\r\nwhereon I stood was covered with little patches of white and that the\r\ndeer’s muzzle was coated with the same white substance. Wondering at\r\nthis, I stooped, scraped up a bit of the strange material, and touched\r\nit to my tongue. It was salt.\r\n\r\nInstantly I realized why the numerous tracks had led hither, why the\r\ndeer had been so intently licking at the caked, muddy ground; the place\r\nwas a “salt-lick,” the first I had ever seen, but of which I had often\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I AIMED AT THE SLEEK, BROWN BODY”]\r\n\r\nThroughout my life in the woods I had missed salt terribly, and while I\r\nhad become accustomed to going without it, all my old longing came back\r\nto me as I tasted this muddy, bitter salt. I regretted deeply not having\r\nfound it before. But I intended to revel in it now, and that night I ate\r\nmeat with salt for the first time in many months, and it tasted\r\nwonderfully good.\r\n\r\nA short time after this I again bent my steps toward the salt-lick to\r\nobtain a fresh supply of the precious material, and, while I had no\r\nimmediate need of more venison or of additional hides, yet I approached\r\nas cautiously as before, for I was curious to see if more deer were at\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nI had almost reached the old tree behind which I had hidden on my former\r\ntrip when my ears caught a most unusual sound. It was low and faint and\r\nresembled the moaning wail of a sick child, and yet there was a whining\r\nnote to it which did not sound human.\r\n\r\nAt first I could not locate it, but, by turning my head and listening\r\nintently, I decided it issued from a thick clump of brush beyond the\r\nsalt-lick. No living creature was in sight, and, rising, I moved toward\r\nthe sound with bow and arrow ready for instant use, for I had no idea\r\nwhat danger might lurk within the thicket. As I drew near I noticed that\r\nthe bare earth was torn and that the salt and mud were reddened with\r\nblood, and I halted as it flashed upon me that the thicket might conceal\r\na lynx mouthing a deer which it had killed. But as I hesitated the sound\r\nagain issued from the bushes, and its wailing, sobbing sound was so\r\nunmistakably the cry of some suffering being in mortal pain that I cast\r\nfear aside and pushed into the brush.\r\n\r\nThe next instant I stopped short and drew back, for lying upon a\r\nblood-stained bed of dead leaves was a gaunt, gray wolf! I had no need\r\nto fear, however; the poor creature was absolutely helpless, and at\r\nsound of my footsteps merely turned his eyes inquiringly in my\r\ndirection, unable even to lift his head from off the ground. A great\r\ngash in his neck and innumerable cuts and tears upon his body showed how\r\nbadly he was wounded, and my first thought was to step to him and\r\nmercifully end his misery. But as I bent above him and drew my knife his\r\ndimming eyes gazed at me with such a pleading, wistful expression that\r\nmy heart revolted at the thought of killing him and I sheathed the\r\nknife, determined to do my utmost to ease his sufferings.\r\n\r\nHe was pitifully weak from loss of blood and was emaciated from lack of\r\nfood, and I doubted if anything could be done for him, but he seemed to\r\nread my thoughts and, instead of snapping or growling, licked my hand in\r\ndog-like fashion as I tenderly examined the gaping wound in his throat.\r\n\r\nIt was such a strange, friendly act that my heart was won, and I vowed\r\nthat if the creature _did_ survive his hurts I would strive to make him\r\nmy companion. I felt that at some time he must have been partially\r\ntamed. I soon found that none of his wounds were really serious in\r\nthemselves, for no vital organ had been injured and only loss of blood\r\nand his hunger-weakened state had brought him so near to death. As I\r\nbathed his wounds and poured water from a near-by spring into his\r\nparched mouth I wondered what woodland tragedy had resulted in the\r\nwolf’s condition, and came to the conclusion that he had attacked a deer\r\nand, being weak with hunger, had been beaten off, gored, and trampled\r\nupon by the victorious buck.\r\n\r\nThe water seemed to revive him greatly. To stop the flow of blood from\r\nhis wounds I bound them up as best I could with strips of bark and salt.\r\nAlthough I knew this must smart and burn the raw flesh terribly, yet the\r\nwolf scarcely uttered a sound of complaint, but bore the torture\r\nstoically while watching my every motion with his tawny eyes. As I\r\nworked I smiled to myself to think what a strange sight we presented—a\r\nwild man of the woods, clad in rude, uncouth garments, with unkempt hair\r\nand beard, ministering to a shaggy, wounded wolf in the heart of the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nAnd when at last the creature’s wounds were dressed and his moans had\r\nceased, I realized that he must have food, and, speaking to him as I\r\nwould to a child, and cautioning him to lie still and to be patient, I\r\nleft him and went into the woods in search of game with which to feed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBirds were abundant and the saucy Canada jays, or whisky-jacks, were\r\nvery tame, and while I had always left these feathered creatures\r\nunmolested, I felt no hesitation in killing one or two of the jays for\r\nthe sake of my wolf-patient.\r\n\r\nReturning with these, I cut them up and fed them to the wolf, who\r\ndevoured them ravenously and heaved an almost human sigh of satisfaction\r\nas he licked his chops over the last bit of raw flesh.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose as to what I was to do with the poor beast. He\r\nwas too weak to walk, and to carry him to my hut was out of the\r\nquestion, for to lift or move him would again open his wounds and start\r\nthe blood flowing afresh. On the other hand, if left here unprotected in\r\nthe woods he might succumb to the chill night air or else some prowling\r\ncreature might kill and devour him. Perhaps I was sentimentally foolish\r\nto waste time and thought over a wounded wolf, but to my lonesome mind\r\nhe was a fellow-being in distress, and already I had found great\r\npleasure in attending to his wants and talking to him, and I was as\r\nanxious for his safety and comfort as if he had been a faithful dog.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be but one thing to do, which was to build a shelter\r\nover him, provide him with food and water, and leave him alone until the\r\nfollowing day, and I at once set about to erect a lean-to above him.\r\nWhen the rude protection was at last completed I filled a birch-bark\r\ndish with water and placed it within reach of his head, cut up another\r\njay and laid this close by, and then, covering him with soft fir boughs\r\nand carefully placing others between his body and the damp earth, I left\r\nhim gazing gratefully after me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I hurried to the wolf as soon as I had eaten breakfast,\r\ncarrying a quantity of meat with me, and to my joy found the creature\r\nmuch stronger than on the previous afternoon. He was now able partly to\r\nraise his body, and ate the venison and drank water eagerly, and\r\napparently recognized me as his friend, for when I approached he thumped\r\nhis brushy tail upon the leaves in welcome—an act which pleased me\r\nimmensely and which also surprised me, for I had never heard that wolves\r\nexpressed their feelings in this dog-like manner.\r\n\r\nI had brought materials with me with which to dress his wounds properly,\r\nand while I was in some dread that he might snap at me or might resent\r\nmy acts while doing this, I soon found I had no cause for fear.\r\nThroughout the tedious and, no doubt, painful process of washing the\r\ncuts, smearing them with bear’s grease and arnica and bandaging them, he\r\nlay almost motionless, only now and then uttering a low moan or a\r\nsubdued growl to indicate an unusually severe twinge of pain. He was\r\nstill very weak and lame, but despite this he made a brave effort to\r\nrise and follow me when I finally left him, but, finding it impossible,\r\nhe sank back upon his bed of fir boughs and howled dismally as he saw me\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nThe next day I found the wolf well on the road toward recovery and\r\nsitting on his haunches, awaiting me. He greeted me with thumping tail\r\nand short yelps of pleasure, fawned upon me as I fed him, and, much to\r\nmy satisfaction, limped along behind me when I started toward my hut.\r\nKnowing how lame and weak he was, I walked very slowly, stopped often to\r\nlet him rest, and when at last we reached the clearing he seemed little\r\nthe worse for the trip. At sight of the cabin the wolf drew back, as if\r\nsuspecting danger or treachery, but when I entered the hut and returned\r\nwith a junk of venison, which I held toward him, his hunger overcame all\r\nscruples and he trotted to the door. For some time he sniffed about\r\nsuspiciously, with tail drooping and the hair on his neck bristling, and\r\nthen, apparently convinced that he had nothing to fear, he entered the\r\ncabin and threw himself down near the fire.\r\n\r\nI was genuinely surprised at this behavior, and in fact had marveled at\r\nhis tameness and dog-like manner from the first, for it was quite at\r\nvariance with all stories I had ever heard of wolves. Long afterward I\r\nlearned that a pet wolf-cub had been kept by one of the inhabitants of\r\nthe plague-stricken village I had found, and I was then convinced that\r\nLobo, as I called my wolf, was this same semi-domesticated cub who had\r\nbeen left to fare for himself when his master died of smallpox.\r\n\r\nOne who has never lived alone in the heart of a wilderness for many\r\nweary months cannot appreciate the comfort which Lobo was to me. Day and\r\nnight he was my constant companion and I talked to him as to a\r\nfellow-man, telling him my plans, asking his opinions on every question\r\nor problem that arose, and consulting him on all matters, to all of\r\nwhich he replied by wags of his tail, low growls, sharp yelps, or by\r\nlicking my hands or face as if he actually understood all that was said\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe soon recovered completely from his injuries, grew sleek and fat and,\r\nif the truth must be confessed, rather lazy, for he had plenty to eat\r\nwithout the trouble of hunting, and he much preferred the easy existence\r\nhe led to the wild life to which he had been accustomed.\r\n\r\nWith Lobo for a comrade the time passed rapidly, and, the snow having\r\nall disappeared and the “pussies” commencing to swell upon the willows\r\nby the lake, I began making plans for leaving the forest and setting out\r\non my tramp to the settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nI had thought the matter out many times already and had decided to set\r\nforth well provided with food, with all my weapons, my necessary\r\nutensils, and a supply of tanned skin, for I had no idea of how far I\r\nmight have to tramp or how long I might be on the journey.\r\n\r\nFew as were my possessions, yet I found that to carry them all would be\r\nimpossible and that many things which would be of great help to me would\r\nhave to be left behind. Among these were the pot and the grindstone and\r\nthe bear-skin robe, and as I thought with regret of abandoning these a\r\nscheme came to me of utilizing Lobo as a pack-horse. But tame and\r\ngood-natured as he was, the wolf would have none of this, and snarled,\r\nsnapped, and bristled threateningly when I started to strap a load upon\r\nhis back by way of experiment.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the objects I must leave were not essential, and without them\r\nI would be far better off and more comfortable than during the early\r\npart of my wilderness life. The bear-skin, to be sure, would be a great\r\ncomfort during the chilly spring nights, but I was well clad and a\r\nhare-skin undercoat would keep me warm enough, while I could broil my\r\nfood, or even boil it in birch-bark dishes as well as I could cook it in\r\nthe pot. The grindstone would be utterly useless, I knew, but I had\r\ngrown to depend upon it so much and by its aid had been able to solve so\r\nmany problems that I dreaded to think of being without it. However, it\r\nwas useless to fret over the matter; the less I carried the sooner I\r\nwould be out of the woods, and I had now become so self-reliant and so\r\naccustomed to overcoming difficulties that I had little fear of\r\nsuffering on the way.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I was sure the weather had settled and when the soggy,\r\nwater-soaked ground had dried sufficiently to make walking possible, I\r\ngathered up my weapons, shouldered my packs, closed the door of the\r\ncabin which had sheltered me so long, and, with Lobo trotting beside me,\r\nbade good-by to my wilderness home.\r\n\r\nAt a turn of the old trail I stopped for a last look at the little hut\r\nand a lump rose in my throat at thought of leaving the place forever. It\r\nhad served me well, the woods and waters had been kind to me, and I was\r\nabout to turn my back on the only home I had known for many months and\r\nto start into the unknown.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright spring morning; birds were twittering among the swelling\r\nbuds of trees and bushes, the sun was warm, and all about were signs of\r\nnature springing into life and beauty once more.\r\n\r\nThe broad green leaves of skunk cabbage spread above the black peat by\r\nthe lake, jack-in-the-pulpits reared their straight stems and unfolding\r\nleaves beside rocks and fallen trees, pale pink and lavender hepaticas\r\npeeped through the fallen leaves on sunny slopes, and trailing-arbutus\r\nvines were rich with odorous, waxen blooms. It was a day to make one\r\nhappy and light-hearted, to fill man or beast with the very joy of\r\nliving, and Lobo gamboled and frolicked about, chasing imaginary rabbits\r\ninto the thickets, yelping at the red squirrels who mocked him from the\r\nbranches overhead, and betweenwhiles trotting back and forth with keen\r\nnose to earth as if seeking for some trail to follow.\r\n\r\nI also felt that it was good to be afield on such a glorious morning,\r\nand, laughing at Lobo’s antics, talking to him as to an intelligent\r\nbeing, whistling gaily, and filled with happiness as I realized that\r\neach step was bringing me nearer to the end of my trail, I swung rapidly\r\nahead through the forest.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before we came in sight of the lonely, deserted\r\nbuildings I had found during the winter, and as Lobo saw them he\r\nbristled up, howled, and, placing his tail between his legs, slunk at my\r\nheels. Although I knew that I must pass this spot on my way, yet I\r\ndreaded to approach it, and Lobo’s actions added to my unreasonable fear\r\nand gave me a sort of “creepy” sensation, for somehow I could not shake\r\noff the foolish idea that he saw or heard things which were invisible to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the shadow of death which hung over it, perhaps it was\r\nthe contrast of the lifeless gray buildings with the bright sunshine and\r\njoyous spring air, or perhaps it was pure imagination on my part, but\r\nsomehow the place seemed uncanny and unnatural. In the little space\r\nbetween the buildings the gaunt, bare cross rose upward, sharply\r\noutlined against the dark background of the distant woods, and now I saw\r\nthat round about it were many smaller boards projecting from the ground.\r\nFor some minutes I hesitated, standing within the shelter of the woods,\r\nwhile Lobo whined cringingly beside me, for I could scarce bring myself\r\nto step forth into the clearing, to pass that tiny graveyard, and to run\r\nthe gauntlet of those blank, staring windows and doors. But pass them I\r\nmust if I was to reach the farther side where the trail led into the\r\nforest, and finally, summoning up my courage and calling myself a fool\r\nand worse, I started forward.\r\n\r\nI had never believed in haunted houses, I scoffed at ghosts and\r\neverything that savored of the supernatural, and I had no patience with\r\nsuperstitions, but, ridiculous as it seems to me now, I could not help\r\nglancing furtively to right and left as we walked through that deserted\r\nvillage in the wilderness and gave the pitiful little graveyard a wide\r\nberth. I tried to argue with myself, to pooh-pooh my own foolishness,\r\nand to try to make myself believe it was merely the dread of smallpox\r\nthat troubled me, and in a measure I succeeded. We had passed the\r\ngraveyard, had left most of the buildings behind, and were approaching\r\nthe entrance to an old wood road on the farther side. I breathed an\r\ninvoluntary sigh of relief to think that in a moment more we would be in\r\nthe woods with the village behind us. Suddenly, as we came abreast of\r\nthe last house with the patch of dead corn behind it, the door of the\r\nbuilding swung open with a bang, and the dried stalks of corn swayed and\r\nrustled as if some object was tearing through them. In my heart I knew\r\nit was but a sudden gust of wind, but as Lobo uttered a melancholy howl\r\nand dashed past me I lost all control of myself and, taking to my heels,\r\ntore after him as fast as I could run. Not until I was a hundred yards\r\ndown the road and the village was out of sight did I cease my wild race,\r\nand, overcoming my silly fright, seated myself upon a stump to regain my\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nLobo was nowhere to be seen, but presently he came trotting back along\r\nthe old road, looking heartily ashamed of himself and wagging his tail\r\nand fawning about me as if to ask forgiveness for his behavior.\r\n\r\nIt all seems very childish and unpardonably silly of me, as I look back\r\nupon it now, but at the time it was real and a most unpleasant\r\nexperience. Many animals seem to have an instinctive dread of a spot\r\nwhere human beings have lived and died. Lobo undoubtedly possessed such\r\na fear, and I had lived so long in the woods and had been such a close\r\ncompanion of the wolf that perhaps I had developed this same unreasoning\r\nterror—it is the only excuse I can offer, the only way I can account for\r\nmy sensations on that spring morning.\r\n\r\nBut the place was left behind. Our spirits rose again and, shouldering\r\nmy packs, I resumed my journey.\r\n\r\nThe trail was easy to follow, for it had evidently once served as a\r\nlogging-road, and for hour after hour we plodded on. That such a road\r\nmust inevitably lead to the settlements I felt sure, for no one would\r\nhave wasted time and labor in cutting a wide road for hauling lumber\r\nunless it led out of the forest. Even if it led me to an isolated\r\nsawmill or a rude lumbermen’s camp it would serve my purpose.\r\n\r\nAt noon we stopped to rest and ate our midday meal of venison, and once\r\nmore started on. My back ached from carrying the unaccustomed load of my\r\npacks, and my feet were sore. I had never walked long distances since\r\nfinding the log cabin, and during most of the time I had traveled on\r\nsnow-shoes.\r\n\r\nThe road wound and turned about and in several places forked or\r\nbranched, and I was often in doubt as to which trail to take. The only\r\nway was to investigate, and I went many miles out of my way, only to\r\nfind that these side trails led merely to cleared spots where the trees\r\nhad been felled and cut for timber.\r\n\r\nBut while it was disappointing to be led astray, yet the presence of the\r\ncleared spaces and the diverging roads encouraged me greatly, for I knew\r\nthat I was no longer in the heart of the vast wilderness, but was in a\r\ndistrict which had been visited by large numbers of men and it could not\r\nbe very far from the outposts of civilization.\r\n\r\nHow long a time had passed since the road had been cut or the lumbermen\r\nhad labored here I could only guess, but the size of the young shoots\r\nwhich had sprung up, the moss and lichens which had grown upon the\r\nrotting stumps and discarded branches of the felled trees, and the\r\nthickets or brush which had partially obliterated the roadway convinced\r\nme that no active work had been carried on here for several years. This\r\nrather surprised and discouraged me, for I could see no reason for\r\nabandoning work, since there was an abundance of good timber still\r\nstanding, and I rather feared that only a deserted camp or a burned and\r\nabandoned mill might lie at the end of my journey. However, I argued\r\nthat there were many other reasons which might account for the matter.\r\nPerhaps, I thought, the lumbermen had been stealing timber from\r\ngovernment land and had been driven off, or possibly better\r\ntransportation facilities in some other district had made lumbering less\r\nprofitable here. Finally I contented myself with the thought that even\r\nif I found no inhabited camp or village at the end of the trail there\r\nmust, at least, be a large river, an old railway, or a well-marked\r\nlumber road leading out to civilization, and once I struck this my way\r\nwould be easy.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-afternoon I heard the sound of rushing water ahead, and a few\r\nmoments later we came to the banks of a river with the road leading\r\ndirectly to the water’s edge. Before me stretched a hundred feet of\r\ntumbling, foaming torrent, and on the farther bank, opposite to where I\r\nstood, I could plainly see the continuation of the old wood road.\r\n\r\nI was as badly off as ever, and, thoroughly disheartened, I threw myself\r\nupon the ground. Evidently to follow the road and escape from the forest\r\nI must cross the stream, and I realized how inexcusably stupid I had\r\nbeen not to have thought of this contingency before. I might have known\r\nthat the lumber road had been used in winter and that on the ice the\r\nloads of timber could be hauled across brooks and rivers which would be\r\nimpassable now, but not until I had been brought face to face with such\r\nconditions did the idea enter my head.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, I thought, the stream might be forded later in the season, for\r\nit was now abnormally high with the spring freshets. But I was in no\r\nmood to wait for weeks, or perhaps months, for the water to fall enough\r\nto allow me to wade across, and I knew that to attempt to swim through\r\nthe icy current would be suicidal and would result in the loss of my\r\noutfit, even if I reached the other side alive. There seemed to be but\r\none thing to be done, which was to walk up the stream to some narrower,\r\nshallower spot where it could be forded, and then, after crossing,\r\nretrace my way on the farther side until I once more came to the road.\r\nSooner or later I knew that I must find a point where I could cross in\r\nsafety, and as anything was better than sitting here and cursing my\r\nluck, I rose and proceeded up the river.\r\n\r\nHad the stream been slightly lower I could have followed its shores at\r\nthe edge of the woods and traveling would have been comparatively easy,\r\nbut with the river in flood the water swept to the trees along the\r\nborders and I was compelled to make my way through the forest.\r\n\r\nFor hour after hour I trudged steadily on, encouraged somewhat by\r\nfinding the river was decreasing in width and that here and there ledges\r\nand boulders jutted above the surface of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking low in the west, the shadows were lengthening, and I\r\nwas considering the advisability of making camp for the night when Lobo\r\nuttered a sharp yelp, lifted his nose in the air, and rushed off\r\ndiagonally through the woods. Feeling sure that something unusual must\r\nhave attracted him and with a half-formed hope that it was a human being\r\nor an occupied habitation, I forgot my weariness and hurried after him.\r\n\r\nThe wolf was now out of sight, but I could hear him yelping a short\r\ndistance away, and presently I saw him standing at the edge of the\r\nwoods, wagging his tail and jumping about as if greatly excited. Beyond\r\nhim was open sky and my heart beat fast with anticipation, for I knew\r\nthat he was at the edge of a clearing which indicated the presence of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nA moment later I was by his side and, looking from the woods, gasped in\r\nastonishment, for at the farther side of the open space stood my own log\r\ncabin!\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds I stood motionless, feeling as if I had taken leave of\r\nmy senses, and I rubbed my eyes and stared again to see if my vision had\r\nnot played me false. It seemed incredible that I should once more be\r\ngazing at the same spot from which I had departed so many hours before,\r\nbut there was not the slightest doubt about it. There stood the hut I\r\nknew so well. I recognized the familiar trees and landmarks about it,\r\nand beyond, glimmering like molten gold in the rays of the setting sun,\r\nwere the distant waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly discouraged, tired, and disgusted to think that I had\r\nmerely traveled in a vast circle, that since early morning I had been\r\ntramping for many weary miles over the old road when by following the\r\nriver down for an hour or two I could have reached the end of the road\r\nwhere it was barred by the stream.\r\n\r\nHungry, footsore, and exhausted, I reached the cabin, tossed my\r\nbelongings on the floor, and threw myself on my bunk.\r\n\r\nThen, as Lobo, whining, licked my hand and looked inquiringly into my\r\nface, I rose, started the fire, and cooked our simple evening meal. The\r\nfood did much to revive my spirits, and I comforted myself by thinking\r\nthat, after all, the cabin was a far better spot to spend the night than\r\nan open camp; that I was no worse off than before, and that, knowing it\r\nwas useless to follow the old road, I could seek a spot to cross the\r\nriver close to my hut.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I made my way to the river, which I now knew was the\r\noutlet to the lake. I examined it carefully for a spot at which I might\r\ncross, but at its narrowest point it was far too wide and turbulent.\r\nThen it came to my mind that I might be able to ford the inlet to the\r\nlake, but as I remembered the wild, rough country which bordered the\r\nlake on its farther side I abandoned this idea. The next instant Lobo\r\nleaped up with a startled growl as I gave a shout of gladness, for I had\r\nthought of a way to solve the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt was so simple, now I had thought of it, that I marveled it had not\r\noccurred to me sooner, for my scheme was to finish the raft I had begun\r\nthe preceding autumn, cross the lake near the outlet, and thus reach the\r\nfarther shore of the stream.\r\n\r\nSo firmly had I been convinced that I could _walk_ out of the wilderness\r\nby following the old trail that my original idea of a raft had been\r\ncompletely forgotten, but now that it had come to my mind, I lost no\r\ntime in getting to work.\r\n\r\nThe logs which I had cut with so much labor were still where I had left\r\nthem when I had met with my accident. I shuddered when I saw the heavy\r\ntimber which had pinned me down and remembered the tortures I had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nI would be more careful this time and would make haste slowly. As I was\r\nfar better equipped to build a raft now than when I had first attempted\r\nthe undertaking, I had little fear of the outcome.\r\n\r\nMy life in the woods had added greatly to my health and strength and I\r\nfound little difficulty in handling logs which had formerly resisted all\r\nmy efforts.\r\n\r\nBut despite this, many hours were required to cut the logs by the slow\r\nprocess of burning, for I was obliged to cut several, since those which\r\nI had rolled to the lake in the autumn had been carried away by the ice.\r\n\r\nThen came the hard, tedious work of rolling the logs to the water, but\r\nat the close of the second day I had the satisfaction of seeing eight\r\nlengths of logs floating on the lake and securely moored to the bank.\r\n\r\nI had learned much during the months which had passed since I first\r\nreached the lake, and I went about building my raft with far greater\r\nconfidence and greater skill than would have been possible the preceding\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nSlipping strong pieces of saplings beneath the floating logs, I lashed\r\nthe projecting ends securely to corresponding crosspieces above the\r\nlogs, and I also passed withes of willow around these pieces between\r\neach two logs. To draw these lashings taut and to secure the logs firmly\r\nI slipped short sticks through the withes, twisted them tightly, and\r\nbound them in position, and as the wood and lashings swelled in the\r\nwater the strips of bark and twisted withes grew as hard and tight as\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nBut even then I was not satisfied, for I found that there was\r\nconsiderable play in the logs, and that instead of remaining rectangular\r\nin form the raft had a tendency to assume a diamond-shape.\r\n\r\nAs I had no wish to be dropped into the icy waters of the lake on my\r\nvoyage, I placed numerous saplings diagonally across the raft, from\r\ncorner to corner, lashed these firmly to the logs and crosspieces,\r\nsecured another row of diagonal pieces above these in the opposite\r\ndirection, and then found that the raft was as stiff, strong, and solid\r\nas one could wish.\r\n\r\nNearly a week had passed while I labored at my rude craft when at last\r\nit was finished and I prepared to set forth. I felt as if I was about to\r\nstart on a voyage of discovery. Indeed, it was in truth a voyage of\r\ndiscovery, for beyond the waters of the little lake was a new and\r\nunknown land which I felt held greater reward for me than Columbus\r\nsought for when he sailed westward in his caravels.\r\n\r\nAnd, like Columbus, I had trouble with my crew, and mutiny threatened\r\neven before the voyage commenced, for Lobo refused to go aboard and no\r\namount of coaxing, threats, or argument would induce him to change his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI hated to leave him behind, but I could scarce afford to remain a\r\nCrusoe of the wilderness on his account, and, thinking he might overcome\r\nhis fears when he saw I was actually abandoning him, I cast off the\r\nfastenings of the raft and with a long pole pushed it a few yards from\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nInstantly the wolf set up a dismal howl and ran up and down the shore,\r\nevidently in great distress at seeing me depart, and, feeling that he\r\nhad learned a lesson, I pushed the end of the raft against the bank. But\r\nno sooner did the logs grate upon the beach than the rascal retreated to\r\na safe distance and, squatting upon his haunches, grinned at me with his\r\ngreat red tongue hanging from his mouth.\r\n\r\nEvidently the wolf considered it was some sort of a game and had no\r\nintention of taking the matter seriously, and, somewhat irritated at his\r\nbehavior, I again poled the raft away from shore. For a few moments Lobo\r\nlooked at me curiously, evidently expecting me to return, and then,\r\nfinding the space of water was steadily widening between raft and shore,\r\nhe plunged into the lake and swam after me. I at once ceased to propel\r\nthe raft and waited for the wolf to come alongside and clamber aboard,\r\nbut he showed no intention of doing this and kept well out of reach,\r\nevidently preferring to trust to his own powers rather than to my\r\nmakeshift vessel.\r\n\r\nThe raft floated buoyantly and the crisscross layers of saplings kept my\r\nfeet dry and above the water which slopped over the logs and I was soon\r\nwell out upon the lake. And then I discovered that I had overlooked a\r\nmost important matter and that by my carelessness and short-sightedness\r\nI was in imminent peril.\r\n\r\nI had trusted to poling the raft across the lake, but the bottom was now\r\nbeyond my reach, I had no oars or paddle, and my raft was drifting\r\nsteadily in the sweep of the current toward the outlet of the lake.\r\n\r\nFuriously I strove to paddle the clumsy craft with the pole, but my\r\nefforts only served to whirl the raft round and round, and each moment\r\nit was drawing nearer to the rushing river and its speed was increasing.\r\n\r\nI was now filled with real terror, and not without reason, for the\r\nstream flowed from the lake in rocky rapids and I realized that in a few\r\nmoments I would be drawn into the torrent, that my raft would be dashed\r\nto pieces on the jagged rocks, and that I would be left struggling\r\nhopelessly in the icy current.\r\n\r\nThen, just as the raft shot toward the maelstrom my pole touched bottom,\r\nI threw all my weight upon it with a last, despairing shove, the raft\r\nlurched, tipped, and plunged, and the next instant I was thrown,\r\nspluttering and surprised, but safe, into a shallow backwater.\r\n\r\nScrambling to my feet, for the water was scarce six inches deep, I\r\nsplashed ashore, and, glancing back, saw my raft, splintered and rent,\r\nbobbing among the foam and rocks of the rapids.\r\n\r\nIt was a close shave, but I had accomplished my purpose and at last was\r\non the southern side of the lake, and a moment later Lobo came bounding\r\nto my side and shaking the water from his shaggy coat.\r\n\r\nMy pack containing provisions and hides had gone with the raft, for I\r\nhad slipped it from my shoulder to more easily handle the pole, but I\r\nstill retained my precious bow and arrows and I discovered my spear\r\nsticking in the shallow water where it had been cast by the final lurch\r\nof the raft.\r\n\r\nWith my weapons and fire-making appliances intact I had little cause to\r\nworry over the loss of my supplies. Thankful that I had escaped with so\r\nlittle damage, I set off down the banks of the stream.\r\n\r\nTo my left a high, wooded hill rose steeply, but the forest by the\r\nriverside was fairly open and level, and I had little trouble in making\r\nmy way down-stream, although several times I was obliged to make wide\r\ndetours to avoid jutting ledges and ramparts of rock.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours I reached the spot where the old wood road ended at the\r\nriver’s bank and, turning to the south, I left the brawling stream\r\nbehind and entered the old trail.\r\n\r\nOn either side were lofty, wooded hills, and these increased in height\r\nand steepness until, when some five miles from the river, I found myself\r\nin a deep, narrow cleft or pass. Then, rounding a precipitous,\r\nrock-strewn promontory, the road entered a wider valley with a low,\r\nrounded hill on the farther side and with a tiny brook babbling through\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nStepping to one side, I approached the brook to drink, when suddenly I\r\nstopped short—listening with bated breath and thumping heart, for my\r\nears had caught a faint, far-away sound of marvelous import—the whistle\r\nof a locomotive! Then breaking into a run, I tore madly up the hillside,\r\nwith Lobo at my heels.\r\n\r\nI reached the summit, peered through the thicket, and looked upon a\r\nbroad, fair valley with a silvery river winding through its fresh green\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nWildly, insanely, I shouted in a very delirium of joy, for gleaming in\r\nthe soft spring sunshine were the white buildings and shingled roofs of\r\na little village.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I LOOKED UPON A BROAD, FAIR VALLEY”]\r\n\r\nTears of happiness welled to my eyes as I stood feasting my gaze upon\r\nthe scene and then the hoarse screech of the locomotive again roared out\r\nand a train thundered past the base of the hill at my feet.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Lobo, and with a terrified howl he turned and sped\r\nback to the wild, leaving me standing alone upon the threshold of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Marooned in the Forest, by A.
