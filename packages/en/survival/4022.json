Many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight\r\ninto problems regarding the structure and changes of the earth’s\r\nsurface, and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical\r\ngeology and physiography in their application to special domains. The\r\nbooks themselves cannot be obtained for many times the price of the\r\npresent volume, and both the general reader, who desires to know more\r\nof Darwin’s work, and the student of geology, who naturally wishes to\r\nknow how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects,\r\nwill be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and\r\ncheap form.\r\n\r\nThe three introductions, which my friend Professor Judd has kindly\r\nfurnished, give critical and historical information which makes this\r\nedition of special value.\r\n\r\nG.T.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL REEFS.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nChapter I—ATOLLS OR LAGOON-ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n_Section I_—DESCRIPTION OF KEELING ATOLL.\r\nCorals on the outer margin.—Zone of Nulliporæ.—Exterior\r\nreef.—Islets.—Coral-conglomerate.—Lagoon.—Calcareous sediment.—Scari\r\nand Holuthuriæ subsisting on corals.—Changes in the condition of the\r\nreefs and islets.—Probable subsidence of the atoll.—Future state of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n_Section II_—GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ATOLLS.

When we are able to detect the\r\ngerms of thought in which such a discovery has originated, and to trace\r\nthe successive stages of the reasoning by which the crude idea has\r\ndeveloped into an epoch-making book, we have the materials for\r\nreconstructing an important chapter of scientific history. Such a\r\ncontribution to the story of the “making of science” may be furnished\r\nin respect to Darwin’s famous theory of coral-reefs, and the clearly\r\nreasoned treatise in which it was first fully set forth.\r\n\r\nThe subject of corals and coral-reefs is one concerning which much\r\npopular misconception has always prevailed. The misleading comparison\r\nof coral-rock with the combs of bees and the nests of wasps is perhaps\r\nresponsible for much of this misunderstanding; one writer has indeed\r\ndescribed a coral-reef as being “built by fishes by means of their\r\nteeth.” Scarcely less misleading, however, are the references we so\r\nfrequently meet with, both in prose and verse, to the “skill,”\r\n“industry,” and “perseverance” of the “coral-insect” in “building” his\r\n“home.” As well might we praise men for their cleverness in making\r\ntheir own skeletons, and laud their assiduity in filling churchyards\r\nwith the same. The polyps and other organisms, whose remains accumulate\r\nto form a coral-reef, simply live and perform their natural functions,\r\nand then die, leaving behind them, in the natural course of events, the\r\nhard calcareous portions of their structures to add to the growing\r\nreef.\r\n\r\nWhile the forms of coral-reefs and coral-islands are sometimes very\r\nremarkable and worthy of attentive study, there is no ground, it need\r\nscarcely be added, for the suggestion that they afford proofs of design\r\non the part of the living builders, or that, in the\r\nwords of Flinders, they constitute breastworks, defending the workshops\r\nfrom whence “infant colonies might be safely sent forth.”\r\n\r\nIt was not till the beginning of the present century that travellers\r\nlike Beechey, Chamisso, Quoy and Gaimard, Moresby, Nelson, and others,\r\nbegan to collect accurate details concerning the forms and structure of\r\ncoral-masses, and to make such observations on the habits of\r\nreef-forming polyps, as might serve as a basis for safe reasoning\r\nconcerning the origin of coral-reefs and islands. In the second volume\r\nof Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” published in 1832, the final\r\nchapter gives an admirable summary of all that was then known on the\r\nsubject. At that time, the ring-form of the atolls was almost\r\nuniversally regarded as a proof that they had grown up on submerged\r\nvolcanic craters; and Lyell gave his powerful support to that theory.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was never tired of acknowledging his indebtedness to\r\nLyell. In dedicating to his friend the second edition of his\r\n“Naturalist’s Voyage Round the World,” Darwin writes that he does so\r\n“with grateful pleasure, as an acknowledgment that the chief part of\r\nwhatever scientific merit this journal and the other works of the\r\nauthor may possess, has been derived from studying the well-known and\r\nadmirable ‘Principles of Geology.’”\r\n\r\nThe second volume of Lyell’s “Principles” appeared after Darwin had\r\nleft England; but it was doubtless sent on to him without delay by his\r\nfaithful friend and correspondent, Professor Henslow. It appears to\r\nhave reached Darwin at a most opportune moment, while, in fact, he was\r\nstudying the striking evidences of slow and long-continued, but often\r\ninterrupted movement on the west coast of South America. Darwin’s acute\r\nmind could not fail to detect the weakness of the then prevalent theory\r\nconcerning the origin of the ring-shaped atolls—and the difficulty\r\nwhich he found in accepting the volcanic theory, as an explanation of\r\nthe phenomena of coral-reefs, is well set forth in his book.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting fragment of autobiography, Darwin has given us a very\r\nclear account of the way in which the leading idea of the theory of\r\ncoral-reefs originated in his mind; he writes, “No other work of mine\r\nwas begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for the whole theory was\r\nthought out on the west coast of South America, before I had seen a\r\ntrue coral-reef. I had therefore only to verify and extend my views by\r\na careful examination of living reefs. But it should be observed that I\r\nhad during the two previous years been incessantly attending to the\r\neffects on the\r\nshores of South America of the intermittent elevation of the land,\r\ntogether with the denudation and deposition of sediment. This\r\nnecessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence, and it\r\nwas easy to replace in imagination the continued deposition of sediment\r\nby the upward growth of corals. To do this was to form my theory of the\r\nformation of barrier-reefs and atolls.”\r\n\r\nOn her homeward voyage, the _Beagle_ visited Tahiti, Australia, and\r\nsome of the coral-islands in the Indian Ocean, and Darwin had an\r\nopportunity of testing and verifying the conclusion at which he had\r\narrived by studying the statements of other observers.\r\n\r\nI well recollect a remarkable conversation I had with Darwin, shortly\r\nafter the death of Lyell. With characteristic modesty, he told me that\r\nhe never fully realised the importance of his theory of coral-reefs\r\ntill he had an opportunity of discussing it with Lyell, shortly after\r\nthe return of the _Beagle_. Lyell, on receiving from the lips of its\r\nauthor a sketch of the new theory, was so overcome with delight that he\r\ndanced about and threw himself into the wildest contortions, as was his\r\nmanner when excessively pleased. He wrote shortly afterwards to Darwin\r\nas follows:—“I could think of nothing for days after your lesson on\r\ncoral-reefs, but of the tops of submerged continents. It is all true,\r\nbut do not flatter yourself that you will be believed till you are\r\ngrowing bald like me, with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of\r\nthe world.” On May 24th, 1837, Lyell wrote to Sir John Herschel as\r\nfollows:—“I am very full of Darwin’s new theory of coral-islands, and\r\nhave urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give\r\nup my volcanic crater forever, though it cost me a pang at first, for\r\nit accounted for so much.” Dr. Whewell was president of the Geological\r\nSociety at the time, and on May 31st, 1837, Darwin read a paper\r\nentitled “On Certain Areas of Elevation and Subsidence in the Pacific\r\nand Indian oceans, as deduced from the Study of Coral Formations,” an\r\nabstract of which appeared in the second volume of the Society’s\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Darwin, having settled himself in lodgings\r\nat Great Marlborough Street, commenced the writing of his book on\r\n“Coral-Reefs.” Many delays from ill-health and the interruption of\r\nother work, caused the progress to be slow, and his journal speaks of\r\n“recommencing” the subject in February 1839, shortly after his\r\nmarriage, and again in October of the same year. In July 1841, he\r\nstates that he began once more “after more than thirteen month’s\r\ninterval,” and the last proof-sheet of\r\nthe book was not corrected till May 6th, 1842. Darwin writes in his\r\nautobiography, “This book, though a small one, cost me twenty months of\r\nhard work, as I had to read every work on the islands of the Pacific,\r\nand to consult many charts.” The task of elaborating and writing out\r\nhis books was, with Darwin, always a very slow and laborious one; but\r\nit is clear that in accomplishing the work now under consideration,\r\nthere was a long and constant struggle with the lethargy and weakness\r\nresulting from the sad condition of his health at that time.\r\n\r\nLyell’s anticipation that the theory of coral-reefs would be slow in\r\nmeeting with general acceptance was certainly not justified by the\r\nactual facts. On the contrary the new book was at once received with\r\ngeneral assent among both geologists and zoologists, and even attracted\r\na considerable amount of attention from the general public.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the coral-reef theory of Darwin found an able\r\nexponent and sturdy champion in the person of the great American\r\nnaturalist, Professor James D. Dana. Two years after the return of the\r\n_Beagle_ to England, the ships of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition set sail upon their four years’ cruise, under the command of\r\nCaptain Wilkes, and Dana was a member of the scientific staff. When, in\r\n1839, the expedition arrived at Sydney, a newspaper paragraph was found\r\nwhich gave the American naturalist the first intimation of Darwin’s new\r\ntheory of the origin of atolls and barrier-reefs. Writing in 1872, Dana\r\ndescribes the effect produced on his mind by reading this passage:—“The\r\nparagraph threw a flood of light over the subject, and called forth\r\nfeelings of peculiar satisfaction, and of gratefulness to Mr. Darwin,\r\nwhich still come up afresh whenever the subject of coral islands is\r\nmentioned. The Gambier Islands in the Paumotus, which gave him the key\r\nto the theory, I had not seen; but on reaching the Feejees, six months\r\nlater, in 1840, I found there similar facts on a still grander scale\r\nand of a more diversified character, so that I was afterward enabled to\r\nspeak of his theory as established with more positiveness than he\r\nhimself, in his philosophic caution, had been ready to adopt. His work\r\non coral-reefs appeared in 1842, when my report on the subject was\r\nalready in manuscript. It showed that the conclusions on other points,\r\nwhich we had independently reached, were for the most part the same.\r\nThe principal points of difference relate to the reason for the absence\r\nof corals from some coasts, and the evidence therefrom as to changes of\r\nlevel, and the distribution of the oceanic regions of\r\nelevation and subsidence—topics which a wide range of travel over the\r\nPacific brought directly and constantly to my attention.”\r\n\r\nAmong the Reports of the United States Exploring Expedition, two\r\nimportant works from the pen of Professor Dana made their\r\nappearance;—one on “Zoophytes,” which treats at length on “Corals and\r\nCoral-Animals,” and the other on “Coral-Reefs and Islands.” In 1872,\r\nDana prepared a work of a more popular character in which some of the\r\nchief results of his studies are described; it bore the title of\r\n“Corals and Coral-Islands.” Of this work, new and enlarged editions\r\nappeared in 1874 and 1890 in America, while two editions were published\r\nin this country in 1872 and 1875. In all these works their author,\r\nwhile maintaining an independent judgment on certain matters of detail,\r\nwarmly defends the views of Darwin on all points essential to the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nAnother able exponent and illustrator of the theory of coral-reefs was\r\nfound in Professor J. B. Jukes, who accompanied H.M.S. _Fly_, as\r\nnaturalist, during the survey of the Great Barrier-Reef—in the years\r\n1842 to 1846. Jukes, who was a man of great acuteness as well as\r\nindependence of mind, concludes his account of the great Australian\r\nreefs with the following words:—“After seeing much of the Great\r\nBarrier-Reefs, and reflecting much upon them, and trying if it were\r\npossible by any means to evade the conclusions to which Mr. Darwin has\r\ncome, I cannot help adding that his hypothesis is perfectly\r\nsatisfactory to my mind, and rises beyond a mere hypothesis into the\r\ntrue theory of coral-reefs.”\r\n\r\nAs the result of the clear exposition of the subject by Darwin, Lyell,\r\nDana, and Jukes, the theory of coral-reefs had, by the middle of the\r\npresent century, commanded the almost universal assent of both\r\nbiologists and geologists. In 1859 Baron von Richthofen brought forward\r\nnew facts in its support, by showing that the existence of the thick\r\nmasses of dolomitic limestone in the Tyrol could be best accounted for\r\nif they were regarded as of coralline origin and as being formed during\r\na period of long continued subsidence. The same views were maintained\r\nby Professor Mojsisovics in his “Dolomit-riffe von Südtirol und\r\nVenetien,” which appeared in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe first serious note of dissent to the generally accepted theory was\r\nheard in 1863, when a distinguished German naturalist, Dr. Karl Semper,\r\ndeclared that his study of the Pelew Islands showed that uninterrupted\r\nsubsidence could not have been going on in that region. Dr. Semper’s\r\nobjections were very carefully\r\nconsidered by Mr. Darwin, and a reply to them appeared in the second\r\nand revised edition of his “Coral-Reefs,” which was published in 1874.\r\nWith characteristic frankness and freedom from prejudice, Darwin\r\nadmitted that the facts brought forward by Dr. Semper proved that in\r\ncertain specified cases, subsidence could not have played the chief\r\npart in originating the peculiar forms of the coral-islands. But while\r\nmaking this admission, he firmly maintained that exceptional cases,\r\nlike those described in the Pelew Islands, were not sufficient to\r\ninvalidate the theory of subsidence as applied to the widely spread\r\natolls, encircling reefs, and barrier-reefs of the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans. It is worthy of note that to the end of his life Darwin\r\nmaintained a friendly correspondence with Semper concerning the points\r\non which they were at issue.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of Semper’s work, Dr. J. J. Rein published an\r\naccount of the Bermudas, in which he opposed the interpretation of the\r\nstructure of the islands given by Nelson and other authors, and\r\nmaintained that the facts observed in them are opposed to the views of\r\nDarwin. Although, so far as I am aware, Darwin had no opportunity of\r\nstudying and considering these particular objections, it may be\r\nmentioned that two American geologists have since carefully re-examined\r\nthe district—Professor W. N. Rice in 1884 and Professor A. Heilprin in\r\n1889—and they have independently arrived at the conclusion that Dr.\r\nRein’s objections cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe most serious opposition to Darwin’s coral-reef theory, however, was\r\nthat which developed itself after the return of H.M.S. _Challenger_\r\nfrom her famous voyage. Mr. John Murray, one of the staff of\r\nnaturalists on board that vessel, propounded a new theory of\r\ncoral-reefs, and maintained that the view that they were formed by\r\nsubsidence was one that was no longer tenable; these objections have\r\nbeen supported by Professor Alexander Agassiz in the United States, and\r\nby Dr. A. Geikie, and Dr. H. B. Guppy in this country.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Darwin did not live to bring out a third edition of his\r\n“Coral-Reefs,” I know from several conversations with him that he had\r\ngiven the most patient and thoughtful consideration to Mr. Murray’s\r\npaper on the subject. He admitted to me that had he known, when he\r\nwrote his work, of the abundant deposition of the remains of calcareous\r\norganisms on the sea floor, he might have regarded this cause as\r\nsufficient in a few cases to raise the summits of submerged volcanoes\r\nor other mountains\r\nto a level at which reef-forming corals can commence to flourish. But\r\nhe did not think that the admission that under certain favourable\r\nconditions, atolls might be thus formed without subsidence,\r\nnecessitated an abandonment of his theory in the case of the\r\ninnumerable examples of the kind which stud the Indian and Pacific\r\nOceans.\r\n\r\nA letter written by Darwin to Professor Alexander Agassiz in May 1881\r\nshows exactly the attitude which careful consideration of the subject\r\nled him to maintain towards the theory propounded by Mr. Murray:—“You\r\nwill have seen,” he writes, “Mr. Murray’s views on the formation of\r\natolls and barrier-reefs. Before publishing my book, I thought long\r\nover the same view, but only as far as ordinary marine organisms are\r\nconcerned, for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute\r\noceanic organisms. I rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made\r\nin the _Beagle_, in the south temperate regions, I concluded that\r\nshells, the smaller corals, etc., decayed and were dissolved when not\r\nprotected by the deposition of sediment, and sediment could not\r\naccumulate in the open ocean. Certainly, shells, etc., were in several\r\ncases completely rotten, and crumbled into mud between my fingers; but\r\nyou will know whether this is in any degree common. I have expressly\r\nsaid that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll, which\r\ncould not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence. I can,\r\nhowever, hardly believe in the existence of as many banks (there having\r\nbeen no subsidence) as there are atolls in the great oceans, within a\r\nreasonable depth, on which minute oceanic organisms could have\r\naccumulated to the depth of many hundred feet.”\r\n\r\nDarwin’s concluding words in the same letter written within a year of\r\nhis death, are a striking proof of the candour and openness of mind\r\nwhich he preserved so well to the end, in this as in other\r\ncontroversies.\r\n\r\n“If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the head and annihilated so\r\nmuch the better. It still seems to me a marvellous thing that there\r\nshould not have been much, and long-continued, subsidence in the beds\r\nof the great oceans. I wish some doubly rich millionaire would take it\r\ninto his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific and Indian\r\natolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500 or 600\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the objections to Darwin’s theory have for the\r\nmost part proceeded from zoologists, while those who have fully\r\nappreciated the geological aspect of the question, have been\r\nthe staunchest supporters of the theory of subsidence. The desirability\r\nof such boring operations in atolls has been insisted upon by several\r\ngeologists, and it may be hoped that before many years have passed\r\naway, Darwin’s hopes may be realised, either with or without the\r\nintervention of the “doubly rich millionaire.”\r\n\r\nThree years after the death of Darwin, the veteran Professor Dana\r\nre-entered the lists and contributed a powerful defence of the theory\r\nof subsidence in the form of a reply to an essay written by the ablest\r\nexponent of the anti-Darwinian views on this subject, Dr. A. Geikie.\r\nWhile pointing out that the Darwinian position had been to a great\r\nextent misunderstood by its opponents, he showed that the rival theory\r\npresented even greater difficulties than those which it professed to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, the whole question of the origin of\r\ncoral-reefs and islands has been re-opened, and a controversy has\r\narisen, into which, unfortunately, acrimonious elements have been very\r\nunnecessarily introduced. Those who desire it, will find clear and\r\nimpartial statements of the varied and often mutually destructive views\r\nput forward by different authors, in three works which have made their\r\nappearance within the last year,—“The Bermuda Islands,” by Professor\r\nAngelo Heilprin; “Corals and Coral-Islands,” new edition by Professor\r\nJ. D. Dana; and the third edition of Darwin’s “Coral-Reefs,” with Notes\r\nand Appendix by Professor T. G. Bonney.\r\n\r\nMost readers will, I think, rise from the perusal of these works with\r\nthe conviction that, while on certain points of detail it is clear\r\nthat, through the want of knowledge concerning the action of marine\r\norganisms in the open ocean, Darwin was betrayed into some grave\r\nerrors, yet the main foundations of his argument have not been\r\nseriously impaired by the new facts observed in the deep-sea\r\nresearches, or by the severe criticism to which his theory has been\r\nsubjected during the last ten years. On the other hand, I think it will\r\nappear that much misapprehension has been exhibited by some of Darwin’s\r\ncritics, as to what his views and arguments really were; so that the\r\nreprint and wide circulation of the book in its original form is\r\ngreatly to be desired, and cannot but be attended with advantage to all\r\nthose who will have the fairness to acquaint themselves with Darwin’s\r\nviews at first hand, before attempting to reply to them.\r\n\r\nJOHN W. JUDD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORAL-REEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe object of this volume is to describe from my own observation and\r\nthe works of others, the principal kinds of coral-reefs, more\r\nespecially those occurring in the open ocean, and to explain the origin\r\nof their peculiar forms. I do not here treat of the polypifers, which\r\nconstruct these vast works, except so far as relates to their\r\ndistribution, and to the conditions favourable to their vigorous\r\ngrowth. Without any distinct intention to classify coral-reefs, most\r\nvoyagers have spoken of them under the following heads:\r\n“lagoon-islands,” or “atolls,” “barrier” or “encircling reefs,” and\r\n“fringing” or “shore-reefs.” The lagoon-islands have received much the\r\nmost attention; and it is not surprising, for every one must be struck\r\nwith astonishment, when he first beholds one of these vast rings of\r\ncoral-rock, often many leagues in diameter, here and there surmounted\r\nby a low verdant island with dazzling white shores, bathed on the\r\noutside by the foaming breakers of the ocean, and on the inside\r\nsurrounding a calm expanse of water, which from reflection, is of a\r\nbright but pale green colour. The naturalist will feel this\r\nastonishment more deeply after having examined the soft and almost\r\ngelatinous bodies of these apparently insignificant creatures, and when\r\nhe knows that the solid reef increases only on the outer edge, which\r\nday and night is lashed by the breakers of an ocean never at rest. Well\r\ndid François Pyrard de Laval, in the year 1605, exclaim, “C’est une\r\nmérueille de voir chacun de ces atollons, enuironné d’un grand banc de\r\npierre tout autour, n’y ayant point d’artifice humain.” The\r\naccompanying sketch of Whitsunday island, in the South Pacific, taken\r\nfrom Captain Beechey’s admirable “Voyage,” although excellent of its\r\nkind, gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these\r\nlagoon-islands.\r\n\r\nWhitsunday Island is of small size, and the whole circle has been\r\nconverted into land, which is a comparatively rare circumstance. As the\r\nreef of a lagoon-island generally supports many separate small islands,\r\nthe word “island,” applied to the whole, is often the cause of\r\nconfusion; hence I have invariably used in this volume the term\r\n“atoll,” which is the name given to these circular groups of\r\ncoral-islets by their\r\ninhabitants in the Indian Ocean, and is synonymous with “lagoon-\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Whitsunday Island]\r\n\r\nBarrier-reefs, when encircling small islands, have been comparatively\r\nlittle noticed by voyagers; but they well deserve attention. In their\r\nstructure they are little less marvellous than atolls, and they give a\r\nsingular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the islands\r\nthey surround. In the accompanying sketch, taken from the “Voyage of\r\nthe _Coquille_,” the reef is seen from within, from one of the high\r\npeaks of the island of Bolabola.[1] Here, as in Whitsunday Island, the\r\nwhole of that part of the reef which is visible is converted into land.\r\nThis is a circumstance of rare occurrence; more usually a snow-white\r\nline of great breakers, with here and there an islet crowned by\r\ncocoa-nut trees, separates the smooth waters of the lagoon-like channel\r\nfrom the waves of the open sea. The barrier-reefs of Australia and of\r\nNew Caledonia, owing to their enormous dimensions, have excited much\r\nattention: in structure and form they resemble those encircling many of\r\nthe smaller islands in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n [1] I have taken the liberty of simplifying the foreground, and\r\n leaving out a mountainous island in the far distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Island of Bolabola]\r\n\r\nWith respect to fringing, or shore-reefs, there is little in their\r\nstructure which needs explanation; and their name expresses their\r\ncomparatively\r\nsmall extension. They differ from barrier-reefs in not lying so far\r\nfrom the shore, and in not having within a broad channel of deep water.\r\nReefs also occur around submerged banks of sediment and of worn-down\r\nrock; and others are scattered quite irregularly where the sea is very\r\nshallow; these in most respects are allied to those of the fringing\r\nclass, but they are of comparatively little interest.\r\n\r\nI have given a separate chapter to each of the above classes, and have\r\ndescribed some one reef or island, on which I possessed most\r\ninformation, as typical; and have afterwards compared it with others of\r\na like kind. Although this classification is useful from being obvious,\r\nand from including most of the coral-reefs existing in the open sea, it\r\nadmits of a more fundamental division into barrier and atoll-formed\r\nreefs on the one hand, where there is a great apparent difficulty with\r\nrespect to the foundation on which they must first have grown; and into\r\nfringing-reefs on the other, where, owing to the nature of the slope of\r\nthe adjoining land, there is no such difficulty. The two blue tints and\r\nthe red colour[2] on the map (Plate III), represent this main division,\r\nas explained in the beginning of the last chapter. In the Appendix,\r\nevery existing coral-reef, except some on the coast of Brazil not\r\nincluded in the map, is briefly described in geographical order, as far\r\nas I possessed information; and any particular spot may be found by\r\nconsulting the Index.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been advanced to explain the origin of atolls or\r\nlagoon-islands, but scarcely one to account for barrier-reefs. From the\r\nlimited depths at which reef-building polypifers can flourish, taken\r\ninto consideration with certain other circumstances, we are compelled\r\nto conclude, as it will be seen, that both in atolls and barrier-reefs,\r\nthe foundation on which the coral was primarily attached, has subsided;\r\nand that during this downward movement, the reefs have grown upwards.\r\nThis conclusion, it will be further seen, explains most satisfactorily\r\nthe outline and general form of atolls and barrier-reefs, and likewise\r\ncertain peculiarities in their structure. The distribution, also, of\r\nthe different kinds of coral-reefs, and their position with relation to\r\nthe areas of recent elevation, and to the points subject to volcanic\r\neruptions, fully accord with this theory of their origin.[3]\r\n\r\n [2] Replaced by numbers in this edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] A brief account of my views on coral formations, now published in\r\n my Journal of Researches, was read May 31st, 1837, before the\r\n Geological Society, and an abstract has appeared in the Proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the several original surveys, from which the small plans on this\r\nplate have been reduced, the coral-reefs are engraved in very different\r\nstyles. For the sake of uniformity, I have adopted the style used in\r\nthe charts of the Chagos Archipelago, published by the East Indian\r\nCompany, from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell. The\r\nsurface of the reef, which dries at low water, is represented by a\r\nsurface with small crosses: the coral-islets on the reef are marked by\r\nsmall linear spaces, on which a few cocoa-nut trees, out of all\r\nproportion too large, have been introduced for the sake of clearness.\r\nThe entire _annular reef_, which when surrounding an open expanse of\r\nwater, forms an “atoll,” and when surrounding one or more high islands,\r\nforms an encircling “barrier-reef,” has a nearly uniform structure. The\r\nreefs in some of the original surveys are represented merely by a\r\nsingle line with crosses, so that their breadth is not given; I have\r\nhad such reefs engraved of the width usually attained by coral-reefs. I\r\nhave not thought it worth while to introduce all those small and very\r\nnumerous reefs, which occur within the lagoons of most atolls and\r\nwithin the lagoon-channels of most barrier-reefs, and which stand\r\neither isolated, or are attached to the shores of the reef or land. At\r\nPeros Banhos none of the lagoon-reefs rise to the surface of the water;\r\na few of them have been introduced, and are marked by plain dotted\r\ncircles. A few of the deepest soundings are laid down within each reef;\r\nthey are in fathoms, of six English feet.\r\n\r\n_Plate I_—Map showing the resemblance in form between barrier\r\ncoral-reefs surrounding mountainous islands, and atolls or lagoon\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the resemblance in form.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1—VANIKORO, situated in the western part of the South Pacific;\r\ntaken from the survey by Captain D’Urville in the _Astrolabe_; the\r\nsoundings on the southern side of the island, namely, from thirty to\r\nforty fathoms, are given from the voyage of the Chev. Dillon; the other\r\nsoundings are laid down from the survey by D’Urville; height of the\r\nsummit of the island is 3,032 feet. The principal small detached reefs\r\nwithin the lagoon-channel have in this instance been represented. The\r\nsouthern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef: if the\r\nengraver had carried this reef entirely round both islands, this figure\r\nwould have served (by leaving out in imagination the barrier-reef) as a\r\ngood specimen of an abruptly-sided island, surrounded by a reef of the\r\nfringing class.\r\n\r\nFig. 2—HOGOLEU, or ROUG, in the Caroline Archipelago; taken from the\r\n“Atlas of the Voyage of the _Astrolabe,_” compiled from the surveys of\r\nCaptains Duperrey and D’Urville; the depth of the immense lagoon-like\r\nspace within the reef is not known.\r\n\r\nFig. 3—RAIATEA, in the Society Archipelago; from the map given in the\r\nquarto edition of “Cook’s First Voyage;” it is probably not accurate.\r\n\r\nFig. 4—BOW, or HEYOU ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Low Archipelago,\r\nfrom the survey by Captain Beechey, R.N.; the lagoon is choked up with\r\nreefs, but the average greatest depth of about twenty fathoms, is given\r\nfrom the published account of the voyage.\r\n\r\nFig. 5—BOLABOLA, in the Society Archipelago, from the survey of Captain\r\nDuperrey in the _ Coquille_: the soundings in this and the following\r\nfigures have been altered from French feet to English fathoms; height\r\nof highest point of the island 4,026 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the resemblance in form.]\r\n\r\nFig. 6.—MAURUA, in the Society Archipelago; from the survey by Captain\r\nDuperrey in the _ Coquille_: height of land about eight hundred feet.\r\n\r\nFig. 7—POUYNIPÈTE, or SENIAVINE, in the Caroline Archipelago; from the\r\nsurvey by Admiral Lutké.\r\n\r\nFig. 8—GAMBIER ISLANDS, in the southern part of the Low Archipelago;\r\nfrom the survey by Captain Beechey; height of highest island, 1,246\r\nfeet; the islands are surrounded by extensive and irregular reefs; the\r\nreef on the southern side is submerged.\r\n\r\nFig. 9—PEROS BANHOS ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Chagos group in\r\nthe Indian Ocean; from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant\r\nPowell; not nearly all the small submerged reefs in the lagoon are\r\nrepresented; the annular reef on the southern side is submerged.\r\n\r\nFig. 10—KEELING, or COCOS ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Indian\r\nOcean; from the survey by Captain Fitzroy; the lagoon south of the\r\ndotted line is very shallow, and is left almost bare at low water; the\r\npart north of the line is choked up with irregular reefs. The annular\r\nreef on the north-west side is broken, and blends into a shoal\r\nsandbank, on which the sea breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I ATOLLS OR LAGOON-ISLANDS\r\n\r\n_Section I_—KEELING ATOLL\r\n\r\nCorals on the outer margin.—Zone of Nulliporæ.—Exterior\r\nreef.—Islets.—Coral-conglomerate.—Lagoon.—Calcareous sediment.—Scari\r\nand Holuthuriæ subsisting on corals.—Changes in the condition of the\r\nreefs and islets.—Probable subsidence of the atoll.—Future state of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nKEELING or COCOS atoll is situated in the Indian Ocean, in 12° 5′ S.,\r\nand longitude 90° 55′ E.: a reduced chart of it was made from the\r\nsurvey of Captain Fitzroy and the Officers of H.M.S. _Beagle_, is given\r\nin Plate I, Fig. 10. The greatest width of this atoll is nine miles and\r\na half. Its structure is in most respects characteristic of the class\r\nto which it belongs, with the exception of the shallowness of the\r\nlagoon. The accompanying woodcut represents a vertical section,\r\nsupposed to be drawn at low water from the outer coast across one of\r\nthe low islets (one being taken of average dimensions) to within the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vertical section of one of the low islets.]\r\n\r\nA.—Level of the sea at low water: where the letter A is placed, the\r\ndepth is twenty-five fathoms, and the distance rather more than one\r\nhundred and fifty yards from the edge of the reef.\r\nB.—Outer edge of that flat part of the reef, which dries at low water:\r\nthe edge either consists of a convex mound, as represented, or of\r\nrugged points, like those a little farther seaward, beneath the water.\r\n C.—A flat of coral-rock, covered at high water.\r\n D.—A low projecting ledge of brecciated coral-rock washed by the waves\r\n at high water.\r\n E.—A slope of loose fragments, reached by the sea only during gales:\r\n the upper part, which is from six to twelve feet high, is clothed with\r\n vegetation. The surface of the islet gently slopes to the lagoon.\r\n F.—Level of the lagoon at low water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe section is true to the scale in a horizontal line, but it could not\r\nbe made so in a vertical one, as the average greatest height of the\r\nland is only between six and twelve feet above high-water mark.\r\nI will describe the section, commencing with the outer margin. I must\r\nfirst observe that the reef-building polypifers, not being tidal\r\nanimals, require to be constantly submerged or washed by the breakers.\r\nI was assured by Mr. Liesk, a very intelligent resident on these\r\nislands, as well as by some chiefs at Tahiti (Otaheite), that an\r\nexposure to the rays of the sun for a very short time invariably causes\r\ntheir destruction. Hence it is possible only under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, afforded by an unusually low tide and smooth water, to\r\nreach the outer margin, where the coral is alive. I succeeded only\r\ntwice in gaining this part, and found it almost entirely composed of a\r\nliving Porites, which forms great irregularly rounded masses (like\r\nthose of an Astræa, but larger) from four to eight feet broad, and\r\nlittle less in thickness. These mounds are separated from each other by\r\nnarrow crooked channels, about six feet deep, most of which intersect\r\nthe line of reef at right angles. On the furthest mound, which I was\r\nable to reach by the aid of a leaping-pole, and over which the sea\r\nbroke with some violence, although the day was quite calm and the tide\r\nlow, the polypifers in the uppermost cells were all dead, but between\r\nthree and four inches lower down on its side they were living, and\r\nformed a projecting border round the upper and dead surface. The coral\r\nbeing thus checked in its upward growth, extends laterally, and hence\r\nmost of the masses, especially those a little further inwards, had\r\nbroad flat dead summits. On the other hand I could see, during the\r\nrecoil of the breakers, that a few yards further seaward, the whole\r\nconvex surface of the Porites was alive; so that the point where we\r\nwere standing was almost on the exact upward and shoreward limit of\r\nexistence of those corals which form the outer margin of the reef. We\r\nshall presently see that there are other organic productions, fitted to\r\nbear a somewhat longer exposure to the air and sun.\r\n\r\nNext, but much inferior in importance to the Porites, is the _\r\nMillepora complanata._[1]\r\n\r\n [1] This Millepora (Palmipora of Blainville), as well as the _M.\r\n alcicornis_, possesses the singular property of stinging the skin\r\n where it is delicate, as on the face and arm.\r\n\r\nIt grows in thick vertical plates, intersecting each other at various\r\nangles, and forms an exceedingly strong honeycombed mass, which\r\ngenerally affects a circular form, the marginal plates alone being\r\nalive. Between these plates and in the protected crevices on the reef,\r\na multitude of branching zoophytes and other productions flourish, but\r\nthe Porites and Millepora alone seem able to resist the fury of the\r\nbreakers on its upper and outer edge: at the depth of a few fathoms\r\nother kinds of stony corals live. Mr. Liesk, who was intimately\r\nacquainted with every part of this reef, and likewise with that of\r\nNorth Keeling atoll, assured me that these corals invariably compose\r\nthe outer margin. The lagoon is inhabited by quite a distinct set of\r\ncorals, generally brittle and thinly branched; but a Porites,\r\napparently of the same species with that on the outside, is found\r\nthere, although it does not seem to thrive, and certainly does not\r\nattain the thousandth part in bulk of the masses opposed to the\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woodcut shows the form of the bottom off the reef: the water\r\ndeepens for a space between one and two hundred yards wide, very\r\ngradually to twenty-five fathoms (A in section), beyond which the sides\r\nplunge into the unfathomable ocean at an angle of 45°.[2] To the depth\r\nof ten or twelve fathoms the bottom is exceedingly rugged, and seems\r\nformed of great masses of living coral, similar to those on the margin.\r\nThe arming of the lead here invariably came up quite clean, but deeply\r\nindented, and chains and anchors which were lowered, in the hopes of\r\ntearing up the coral, were broken. Many small fragments, however, of _\r\nMillepora alcicornis_ were brought up; and on the arming from an\r\neight-fathom cast, there was a perfect impression of an Astræa,\r\napparently alive. I examined the rolled fragments cast on the beach\r\nduring gales, in order further to ascertain what corals grew outside\r\nthe reef. The fragments consisted of many kinds, of which the Porites\r\nalready mentioned and a Madrepora, apparently the _M. corymbosa_, were\r\nthe most abundant. As I searched in vain in the hollows on the reef and\r\nin the lagoon, for a living specimen of this Madrepore, I conclude that\r\nit is confined to a zone outside, and beneath the surface, where it\r\nmust be very abundant. Fragments of the _Millepora alcicornis_ and of\r\nan Astræa were also numerous; the former is found, but not in\r\nproportionate numbers, in the hollows on the reef; but the Astræa I did\r\nnot see living. Hence we may infer, that these are the kinds of coral\r\nwhich form the rugged sloping surface (represented in the woodcut by an\r\nuneven line), round and beneath the external margin. Between twelve and\r\ntwenty fathoms the arming came up an equal number of times smoothed\r\nwith sand, and indented with coral: an anchor and lead were lost at the\r\nrespective depths of thirteen and sixteen fathoms. Out of twenty-five\r\nsoundings taken at a greater depth than twenty fathoms, every one\r\nshowed that the bottom was covered with sand; whereas, at a less depth\r\nthan twelve fathoms, every sounding showed that it was exceedingly\r\nrugged, and free from all extraneous particles. Two soundings were\r\nobtained at the depth of 360 fathoms, and several between two hundred\r\nand three hundred fathoms. The sand brought up from these depths\r\nconsisted of finely triturated fragments of stony zoophytes, but not,\r\nas far as I could distinguish, of a particle of any lamelliform genus:\r\nfragments of shells were rare.\r\n\r\n [2] The soundings from which this section is laid down were taken with\r\n great care by Captain Fitzroy himself. He used a bell-shaped lead,\r\n having a diameter of four inches, and the armings each time were cut\r\n off and brought on board for me to examine. The arming is a\r\n preparation of tallow, placed in the concavity at the bottom of the\r\n lead. Sand, and even small fragments of rock, will adhere to it; and\r\n if the bottom be of rock it brings up an exact impression of its\r\n surface.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of 2,200 yards from the breakers, Captain Fitzroy found\r\nno bottom with a line of 7,200 feet in length; hence the submarine\r\nslope of this coral formation is steeper than that of any volcanic\r\ncone. Off the mouth of the lagoon, and likewise off the northern point\r\nof the atoll, where the currents act violently, the inclination, owing\r\nto the accumulation of sediment, is less. As the arming of the lead\r\nfrom\r\nall the greater depths showed a smooth sandy bottom, I at first\r\nconcluded that the whole consisted of a vast conical pile of calcareous\r\nsand, but the sudden increase of depth at some points, and the\r\ncircumstance of the line having been cut, as if rubbed, when between\r\nfive hundred and six hundred fathoms were out, indicate the probable\r\nexistence of submarine cliffs.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the reef, close within the line where the upper\r\nsurface of the Porites and of the Millepora is dead, three species of\r\nNullipora flourish. One grows in thin sheets, like a lichen on old\r\ntrees; the second in stony knobs, as thick as a man’s finger, radiating\r\nfrom a common centre; and the third, which is less common, in a\r\nmoss-like reticulation of thin, but perfectly rigid branches.[3] The\r\nthree species occur either separately or mingled together; and they\r\nform by their successive growth a layer two or three feet in thickness,\r\nwhich in some cases is hard, but where formed of the lichen-like kind,\r\nreadily yields an impression to the hammer: the surface is of a reddish\r\ncolour. These Nulliporæ, although able to exist above the limit of true\r\ncorals, seem to require to be bathed during the greater part of each\r\ntide by breaking water, for they are not found in any abundance in the\r\nprotected hollows on the back part of the reef, where they might be\r\nimmersed either during the whole or an equal proportional time of each\r\ntide. It is remarkable that organic productions of such extreme\r\nsimplicity, for the Nulliporæ undoubtedly belong to one of the lowest\r\nclasses of the vegetable kingdom, should be limited to a zone so\r\npeculiarly circumstanced. Hence the layer composed by their growth\r\nmerely fringes the reef for a space of about twenty yards in width,\r\neither under the form of separate mammillated projections, where the\r\nouter masses of coral are separate, or, more commonly, where the corals\r\nare united into a solid margin, as a continuous smooth convex mound (B\r\nin woodcut), like an artificial breakwater. Both the mound and\r\nmammillated projections stand about three feet higher than any other\r\npart of the reef, by which term I do not include the islets, formed by\r\nthe accumulation of rolled fragments. We shall hereafter see that other\r\ncoral reefs are protected by a similar thick growth of Nulliporæ on the\r\nouter margin, the part most exposed to the breakers, and this must\r\neffectually aid in preserving it from being worn down.\r\n\r\n [3] This last species is of a beautiful bright peach-blossom colour.\r\n Its branches are about as thick as crow-quills; they are slightly\r\n flattened and knobbed at the extremities. The extremities only are\r\n alive and brightly coloured. The two other species are of a dirty\r\n purplish-white. The second species is extremely hard; its short\r\n knob-like branches are cylindrical, and do not grow thicker at their\r\n extremities.\r\n\r\nThe woodcut represents a section across one of the islets on the reef,\r\nbut if all that part which is above the level of C were removed, the\r\nsection would be that of a simple reef, as it occurs where no islet has\r\nbeen formed. It is this reef which essentially forms the atoll. It is a\r\nring, enclosing the lagoon on all sides except at the northern end,\r\nwhere there are two open spaces, through one of which ships can enter.\r\nThe reef varies in width from two hundred and fifty to five\r\nhundred yards, its surface is level, or very slightly inclined towards\r\nthe lagoon, and at high tide the sea breaks entirely over it: the water\r\nat low tide thrown by the breakers on the reef, is carried by the many\r\nnarrow and shoal gullies or channels on its surface, into the lagoon: a\r\nreturn stream sets out of the lagoon through the main entrance. The\r\nmost frequent coral in the hollows on the reef is _Pocillopora\r\nverrucosa_, which grows in short sinuous plates, or branches, and when\r\nalive is of a beautiful pale lake-red: a Madrepora, closely allied or\r\nidentical with _M. pocillifera_, is also common. As soon as an islet is\r\nformed, and the waves are prevented breaking entirely over the reef,\r\nthe channels and hollows in it become filled up with cemented\r\nfragments, and its surface is converted into a hard smooth floor (C of\r\nwoodcut), like an artificial one of freestone. This flat surface varies\r\nin width from one hundred to two hundred, or even three hundred yards,\r\nand is strewed with a few large fragments of coral torn up during\r\ngales: it is uncovered only at low water. I could with difficulty, and\r\nonly by the aid of a chisel, procure chips of rock from its surface,\r\nand therefore could not ascertain how much of it is formed by the\r\naggregation of detritus, and how much by the outward growth of mounds\r\nof corals, similar to those now living on the margin. Nothing can be\r\nmore singular than the appearance at low tide of this “flat” of naked\r\nstone, especially where it is externally bounded by the smooth convex\r\nmound of Nulliporæ, appearing like a breakwater built to resist the\r\nwaves, which are constantly throwing over it sheets of foaming water.\r\nThe characteristic appearance of this “flat” is shown in the foregoing\r\nwoodcut of Whitsunday atoll.\r\n\r\nThe islets on the reef are first formed between two hundred and three\r\nhundred yards from its outer edge, through the accumulation of a pile\r\nof fragments, thrown together by some unusually strong gale. Their\r\nordinary width is under a quarter of a mile, and their length varies\r\nfrom a few yards to several miles. Those on the south-east and windward\r\nside of the atoll, increase solely by the addition of fragments on\r\ntheir outer side; hence the loose blocks of coral, of which their\r\nsurface is composed, as well as the shells mingled with them, almost\r\nexclusively consist of those kinds which live on the outer coast. The\r\nhighest part of the islets (excepting hillocks of blown sand, some of\r\nwhich are thirty feet high), is close to the outer beach (E of the\r\nwoodcut), and averages from six to ten feet above ordinary high-water\r\nmark. From the outer beach the surface slopes gently to the shores of\r\nthe lagoon, which no doubt has been caused by the breakers the further\r\nthey have rolled over the reef, having had less power to throw up\r\nfragments. The little waves of the lagoon heap up sand and fragments of\r\nthinly-branched corals on the inner side of the islets on the leeward\r\nside of the atoll; and these islets are broader than those to windward,\r\nsome being even eight hundred yards in width; but the land thus added\r\nis very low. The fragments beneath the surface are cemented into a\r\nsolid mass, which is exposed as a ledge (D of the woodcut), projecting\r\nsome yards in front of the outer shore and from two to four feet high.\r\nThis ledge is just reached by the waves at ordinary high-water:\r\nit extends in front of all the islets, and everywhere has a water-worn\r\nand scooped appearance. The fragments of coral which are occasionally\r\ncast on the “flat” are during gales of unusual violence swept together\r\non the beach, where the waves each day at high-water tend to remove and\r\ngradually wear them down; but the lower fragments having become firmly\r\ncemented together by the percolation of calcareous matter, resist the\r\ndaily tides longer, and hence project as a ledge. The cemented mass is\r\ngenerally of a white colour, but in some few parts reddish from\r\nferruginous matter; it is very hard, and is sonorous under the hammer;\r\nit is obscurely divided by seams, dipping at a small angle seaward; it\r\nconsists of fragments of the corals which grow on the outer margin,\r\nsome quite and others partially rounded, some small and others between\r\ntwo and three feet across; and of masses of previously formed\r\nconglomerate, torn up, rounded, and re-cemented; or it consists of a\r\ncalcareous sandstone, entirely composed of rounded particles, generally\r\nalmost blended together, of shells, corals, the spines of echini, and\r\nother such organic bodies; rocks, of this latter kind, occur on many\r\nshores, where there are no coral reefs. The structure of the coral in\r\nthe conglomerate has generally been much obscured by the infiltration\r\nof spathose calcareous matter; and I collected a very interesting\r\nseries, beginning with fragments of unaltered coral, and ending with\r\nothers, where it was impossible to discover with the naked eye any\r\ntrace of organic structure. In some specimens I was unable, even with\r\nthe aid of a lens, and by wetting them, to distinguish the boundaries\r\nof the altered coral and spathose limestone. Many even of the blocks of\r\ncoral lying loose on the beach, had their central parts altered and\r\ninfiltrated.\r\n\r\nThe lagoon alone remains to be described; it is much shallower than\r\nthat of most atolls of considerable size. The southern part is almost\r\nfilled up with banks of mud and fields of coral, both dead and alive,\r\nbut there are considerable spaces, between three and four fathoms, and\r\nsmaller basins, from eight to ten fathoms deep. Probably about half its\r\narea consists of sediment, and half of coral-reefs. The corals\r\ncomposing these reefs have a very different aspect from those on the\r\noutside; they are very numerous in kind, and most of them are thinly\r\nbranched. Meandrina, however, lives in the lagoon, and great rounded\r\nmasses of this coral are numerous, lying quite or almost loose on the\r\nbottom. The other commonest kinds consist of three closely allied\r\nspecies of true Madrepora in thin branches; of _Seriatapora subulata_;\r\ntwo species of Porites[4] with cylindrical branches, one of which forms\r\ncircular clumps, with the exterior branches only alive; and lastly, a\r\ncoral something like an Explanaria, but with stars on both surfaces,\r\ngrowing in thin, brittle, stony, foliaceous expansions, especially in\r\nthe deeper basins of the lagoon. The reefs on which\r\nthese corals grow are very irregular in form, are full of cavities, and\r\nhave not a solid flat surface of dead rock, like that surrounding the\r\nlagoon; nor can they be nearly so hard, for the inhabitants made with\r\ncrowbars a channel of considerable length through these reefs, in which\r\na schooner, built on the S.E. islet, was floated out. It is a very\r\ninteresting circumstance, pointed out to us by Mr. Liesk, that this\r\nchannel, although made less than ten years before our visit, was then,\r\nas we saw, almost choked up with living coral, so that fresh\r\nexcavations would be absolutely necessary to allow another vessel to\r\npass through it.\r\n\r\n [4] This Porites has somewhat the habit of _P. clavaria_, but the\r\n branches are not knobbed at their ends. When alive it is of a yellow\r\n colour, but after having been washed in fresh water and placed to dry,\r\n a jet-black slimy substance exuded from the entire surface, so that\r\n the specimen now appears as if it had been dipped in ink.\r\n\r\nThe sediment from the deepest parts in the lagoon, when wet, appeared\r\nchalky, but when dry, like very fine sand. Large soft banks of similar,\r\nbut even finer grained mud, occur on the S.E. shore of the lagoon,\r\naffording a thick growth of a Fucus, on which turtle feed: this mud,\r\nalthough discoloured by vegetable matter, appears from its entire\r\nsolution in acids to be purely calcareous. I have seen in the Museum of\r\nthe Geological Society, a similar but more remarkable substance,\r\nbrought by Lieutenant Nelson from the reefs of Bermuda, which, when\r\nshown to several experienced geologists, was mistaken by them for true\r\nchalk. On the outside of the reef much sediment must be formed by the\r\naction of the surf on the rolled fragments of coral; but in the calm\r\nwaters of the lagoon, this can take place only in a small degree. There\r\nare, however, other and unexpected agents at work here: large shoals of\r\ntwo species of Scarus, one inhabiting the surf outside the reef and the\r\nother the lagoon, subsist entirely, as I was assured by Mr. Liesk, the\r\nintelligent resident before referred to, by browsing on the living\r\npolypifers. I opened several of these fish, which are very numerous and\r\nof considerable size, and I found their intestines distended by small\r\npieces of coral, and finely ground calcareous matter. This must daily\r\npass from them as the finest sediment; much also must be produced by\r\nthe infinitely numerous vermiform and molluscous animals, which make\r\ncavities in almost every block of coral. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres, who\r\nhas enjoyed the best means of observation, informs me in a letter that\r\nthe Holothuriæ (a family of Radiata) subsist on living coral; and the\r\nsingular structure of bone within the anterior extremity of their\r\nbodies, certainly appears well adapted for this purpose. The number of\r\nthe species of Holothuria, and of the individuals which swarm on every\r\npart of these coral-reefs, is extraordinarily great; and many shiploads\r\nare annually freighted, as is well-known, for China with the trepang,\r\nwhich is a species of this genus. The amount of coral yearly consumed,\r\nand ground down into the finest mud, by these several creatures, and\r\nprobably by many other kinds, must be immense. These facts are,\r\nhowever, of more importance in another point of view, as showing us\r\nthat there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs, and that the\r\nalmost universal law of “consumed and be consumed,” holds good even\r\nwith the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks, which are able to\r\nwithstand the force of the open ocean.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Keeling atoll, like other coral formations, has been\r\nentirely formed by the growth of organic beings, and the accumulation\r\nof their detritus, one is naturally led to inquire how long it has\r\ncontinued, and how long it is likely to continue, in its present state.\r\nMr. Liesk informed me that he had seen an old chart in which the\r\npresent long island on the S.E. side was divided by several channels\r\ninto as many islets; and he assures me that the channels can still be\r\ndistinguished by the smaller size of the trees on them. On several\r\nislets, also, I observed that only young cocoa-nut trees were growing\r\non the extremities; and that older and taller trees rose in regular\r\nsuccession behind them; which shows that these islets have very lately\r\nincreased in length. In the upper and south-eastern part of the lagoon,\r\nI was much surprised by finding an irregular field of at least a mile\r\nsquare of branching corals, still upright, but entirely dead. They\r\nconsisted of the species already mentioned; they were of a brown\r\ncolour, and so rotten, that in trying to stand on them I sank halfway\r\nup the leg, as if through decayed brushwood. The tops of the branches\r\nwere barely covered by water at the time of lowest tide. Several facts\r\nhaving led me to disbelieve in any elevation of the whole atoll, I was\r\nat first unable to imagine what cause could have killed so large a\r\nfield of coral. Upon reflection, however, it appeared to me that the\r\nclosing up of the above-mentioned channels would be a sufficient cause;\r\nfor before this, a strong breeze by forcing water through them into the\r\nhead of the lagoon, would tend to raise its level. But now this cannot\r\nhappen, and the inhabitants observe that the tide rises to a less\r\nheight, during a high S.E. wind, at the head than at the mouth of the\r\nlagoon. The corals, which, under the former condition of things, had\r\nattained the utmost possible limit of upward growth, would thus\r\noccasionally be exposed for a short time to the sun, and be killed.\r\n\r\nBesides the increase of dry land, indicated by the foregoing facts, the\r\nexterior solid reef appears to have grown outwards. On the western side\r\nof the atoll, the “flat” lying between the margin of the reef and the\r\nbeach, is very wide; and in front of the regular beach with its\r\nconglomerate basis, there is, in most parts, a bed of sand and loose\r\nfragments with trees growing out of it, which apparently is not reached\r\neven by the spray at high water. It is evident some change has taken\r\nplace since the waves formed the inner beach; that they formerly beat\r\nagainst it with violence was evident, from a remarkably thick and\r\nwater-worn point of conglomerate at one spot, now protected by\r\nvegetation and a bank of sand; that they beat against it in the same\r\npeculiar manner in which the swell from windward now obliquely curls\r\nround the margin of the reef, was evident from the conglomerate having\r\nbeen worn into a point projecting from the beach in a similarly oblique\r\nmanner. This retreat in the line of action of the breakers might\r\nresult, either from the surface of the reef in front of the islets\r\nhaving been submerged at one time, and afterward having grown upwards,\r\nor from the mounds of coral on the margin having continued to grow\r\noutwards. That an outward growth of this part is in process, can hardly\r\nbe doubted from the fact already mentioned of the mounds of Porites\r\nwith their summits apparently lately killed, and their sides only three\r\nor four inches lower down thickened by a fresh layer of living coral.\r\nBut there is a difficulty on this supposition which I must not pass\r\nover. If the\r\nwhole, or a large part of the “flat,” had been formed by the outward\r\ngrowth of the margin, each successive margin would naturally have been\r\ncoated by the Nulliporæ, and so much of the surface would have been of\r\nequal height with the existing zone of living Nulliporæ: this is not\r\nthe case, as may be seen in the woodcut. It is, however, evident from\r\nthe abraded state of the “flat,” with its original inequalities filled\r\nup, that its surface has been much modified; and it is possible that\r\nthe hinder portions of the zone of Nulliporæ, perishing as the reef\r\ngrows outwards, might be worn down by the surf. If this has not taken\r\nplace, the reef can in no part have increased outwards in breadth since\r\nits formation, or at least since the Nulliporæ formed the convex mound\r\non its margin; for the zone thus formed, and which stands between two\r\nand three feet above the other parts of the reef, is nowhere much above\r\ntwenty yards in width.\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered facts, which indicate, with more or less\r\nprobability, the increase of the atoll in its different parts: there\r\nare others having an opposite tendency. On the south-east side,\r\nLieutenant Sulivan, to whose kindness I am indebted for many\r\ninteresting observations, found the conglomerate projecting on the reef\r\nnearly fifty yards in front of the beach: we may infer from what we see\r\nin all other parts of the atoll, that the conglomerate was not\r\noriginally so much exposed, but formed the base of an islet, the front\r\nand upper part of which has since been swept away. The degree to which\r\nthe conglomerate, round nearly the whole atoll, has been scooped,\r\nbroken up, and the fragments cast on the beach, is certainly very\r\nsurprising, even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales\r\nto pile up fragments, and of the daily tides to wear them away. On the\r\nwestern side, also, of the atoll, where I have described a bed of sand\r\nand fragments with trees growing out of it, in front of an old beach,\r\nit struck both Lieutenant Sulivan and myself, from the manner in which\r\nthe trees were being washed down, that the surf had lately recommenced\r\nan attack on this line of coast. Appearances indicating a slight\r\nencroachment of the water on the land, are plainer within the lagoon: I\r\nnoticed in several places, both on its windward and leeward shores, old\r\ncocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined, and the rotten\r\nstumps of others on the beach, where the inhabitants assured us the\r\ncocoa-nut could not now grow. Captain Fitzroy pointed out to me, near\r\nthe settlement, the foundation posts of a shed, now washed by every\r\ntide, but which the inhabitants stated, had seven years before stood\r\nabove high watermark. In the calm waters of the lagoon, directly\r\nconnected with a great, and therefore stable ocean, it seems very\r\nimprobable that a change in the currents, sufficiently great to cause\r\nthe water to eat into the land on all sides, should have taken place\r\nwithin a limited period. From these considerations I inferred, that\r\nprobably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount; and this\r\ninference was strengthened by the circumstance, that in 1834, two years\r\nbefore our visit, the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake,\r\nand by two slighter ones during the ten previous years. If, during\r\nthese subterranean disturbances, the atoll did subside, the downward\r\nmovement must have been very small, as we must\r\nconclude from the fields of dead coral still lipping the surface of the\r\nlagoon, and from the breakers on the western shore not having yet\r\nregained the line of their former action. The subsidence must, also,\r\nhave been preceded by a long period of rest, during which the islets\r\nextended to their present size, and the living margin of the reef grew\r\neither upwards, or as I believe outwards, to its present distance from\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nWhether this view be correct or not, the above facts are worthy of\r\nattention, as showing how severe a struggle is in progress on these low\r\ncoral formations between the two nicely balanced powers of land and\r\nwater. With respect to the future state of Keeling atoll, if left\r\nundisturbed, we can see that the islets may still extend in length; but\r\nas they cannot resist the surf until broken by rolling over a wide\r\nspace, their increase in breadth must depend on the increasing breadth\r\nof the reef; and this must be limited by the steepness of the submarine\r\nflanks, which can be added to only by sediment derived from the wear\r\nand tear of the coral. From the rapid growth of the coral in the\r\nchannel cut for the schooner, and from the several agents at work in\r\nproducing fine sediment, it might be thought that the lagoon would\r\nnecessarily become quickly filled up. Some of this sediment, however,\r\nis transported into the open sea, as appears from the soundings off the\r\nmouth of the lagoon, instead of being deposited within it. The\r\ndeposition, moreover, of sediment, checks the growth of coral-reefs, so\r\nthat these two agencies cannot act together with full effect in filling\r\nit up. We know so little of the habits of the many different species of\r\ncorals, which form the lagoon-reefs, that we have no more reasons for\r\nsupposing that their whole surface would grow up as quickly as the\r\ncoral did in the schooner-channel, than for supposing that the whole\r\nsurface of a peat-moss would increase as quickly as parts are known to\r\ndo in holes, where the peat has been cut away. These agencies,\r\nnevertheless, tend to fill up the lagoon; but in proportion as it\r\nbecomes shallower, so must the polypifers be subject to many injurious\r\nagencies, such as impure water and loss of food. For instance, Mr.\r\nLiesk informed me, that some years before our visit unusually heavy\r\nrain killed nearly all the fish in the lagoon, and probably the same\r\ncause would likewise injure the corals. The reefs also, it must be\r\nremembered, cannot possibly rise above the level of the lowest\r\nspring-tide, so that the final conversion of the lagoon into land must\r\nbe due to the accumulation of sediment; and in the midst of the clear\r\nwater of the ocean, and with no surrounding high land, this process\r\nmust be exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\n_Section II_—GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ATOLLS.\r\n\r\nGeneral form and size of atolls, their reefs and islets.—External\r\nslope.—Zone of Nulliporæ.—Conglomerate.—Depth of\r\nlagoons.—Sediment.—Reefs submerged wholly or in part.—Breaches in the\r\nreef.—Ledge-formed shores round certain lagoons.—Conversion of lagoons\r\ninto land.\r\n\r\nI will here give a sketch of the general form and structure of the many\r\natolls and atoll-formed reefs which occur in the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans, comparing them with Keeling atoll. The Maldiva atolls\r\nand the Great Chagos Bank differ in so many respects, that I shall\r\ndevote to them, besides occasional references, a third section of this\r\nchapter. Keeling atoll may be considered as of moderate dimensions and\r\nof regular form. Of the thirty-two islands surveyed by Captain Beechey\r\nin the Low Archipelago, the longest was found to be thirty miles, and\r\nthe shortest less than a mile; but Vliegen atoll, situated in another\r\npart of the same group, appears to be sixty miles long and twenty\r\nbroad. Most of the atolls in this group are of an elongated form; thus\r\nBow Island is thirty miles in length, and on an average only six in\r\nwidth (See Fig. 4, Plate I), and Clermont Tonnere has nearly the same\r\nproportions. In the Marshall Archipelago (the Ralick and Radack group\r\nof Kotzebue) several of the atolls are more than thirty miles in\r\nlength, and Rimsky Korsacoff is fifty-four long, and twenty wide, at\r\nthe broadest part of its irregular outline. Most of the atolls in the\r\nMaldiva Archipelago are of great size, one of them (which, however,\r\nbears a double name) measured in a medial and slightly curved line, is\r\nno less than eighty-eight geographical miles long, its greatest width\r\nbeing under twenty, and its least only nine and a half miles. Some\r\natolls have spurs projecting from them; and in the Marshall group there\r\nare atolls united together by linear reefs, for instance Menchikoff\r\nIsland (See Fig. 3, Plate II), which is sixty miles in length, and\r\nconsists of three loops tied together. In far the greater number of\r\ncases an atoll consists of a simple elongated ring, with its outline\r\nmoderately regular.\r\n\r\nThe average width of the annular wreath may be taken as about a quarter\r\nof a mile. Captain Beechey[5] says that in the atolls of the Low\r\nArchipelago it exceeded in no instance half a mile. The description\r\ngiven of the structure and proportional dimensions of the reef and\r\nislets of Keeling atoll, appears to apply perfectly to nearly all the\r\natolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The islets are first formed\r\nsome way back either on the projecting points of the reef, especially\r\nif its form be angular, or on the sides of the main entrances into the\r\nlagoon—that is in both cases, on points where the breakers can act\r\nduring gales of wind in somewhat different directions, so that the\r\nmatter thrown up from one side may accumulate against that before\r\nthrown up from another. In Lutké’s chart of the Caroline atolls, we see\r\nmany instances of the former case; and the occurrence of islets, as if\r\nplaced for beacons, on the points where there is a gateway or breach\r\nthrough the reef, has been noticed by several authors. There are some\r\natoll-formed reefs, rising to the surface of the sea and partly dry at\r\nlow water, on which from some cause islets have never been formed; and\r\nthere are others on which they have been formed, but have subsequently\r\nbeen worn away. In atolls of small dimensions the islets frequently\r\nbecome united into a single horse-shoe or ring-formed strip; but Diego\r\nGarcia, although an atoll of considerable size, being thirteen miles\r\nand a half in length, has its lagoon entirely surrounded, except at the\r\nnorthern end, by a belt of land, on an average a third of a mile in\r\nwidth. To show how small the total area of the annular reef and the\r\nland is in islands of this class,\r\nI may quote a remark from the voyage of Lutké, namely, that if the\r\nforty-three rings, or atolls, in the Caroline Archipelago, were put one\r\nwithin another, and over a steeple in the centre of St. Petersburg, the\r\nwhole world would not cover that city and its suburbs.\r\n\r\n [5] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific and Beering’s Straits,” chapter\r\n viii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of the bottom off Keeling atoll, which gradually slopes to\r\nabout twenty fathoms at the distance of between one and two hundred\r\nyards from the edge of the reef, and then plunges at an angle of 45°\r\ninto unfathomable depths, is exactly the same[6] with that of the\r\nsections of the atolls in the Low Archipelago given by Captain Beechey.\r\nThe nature, however, of the bottom seems to differ, for this officer[7]\r\ninforms me that all the soundings, even the deepest, were on coral, but\r\nhe does not know whether dead or alive. The slope round Christmas atoll\r\n(Lat. 1° 4′ N., 157° 45′ W.), described by Cook,[8] is considerably\r\nless, at about half a mile from the edge of the reef, the average depth\r\nwas about fourteen fathoms on a fine sandy bottom, and at a mile, only\r\nbetween twenty and forty fathoms. It has no doubt been owing to this\r\ngentle slope, that the strip of land surrounding its lagoon, has\r\nincreased in one part to the extraordinary width of three miles; it is\r\nformed of successive ridges of broken shells and corals, like those on\r\nthe beach. I know of no other instance of such width in the reef of an\r\natoll; but Mr. F. D. Bennett informs me that the inclination of the\r\nbottom round Caroline atoll in the Pacific, is like that off Christmas\r\nIsland, very gentle. Off the Maldiva and Chagos atolls, the inclination\r\nis much more abrupt; thus at Heawandoo Pholo, Lieutenant Powell[9]\r\nfound fifty and sixty fathoms close to the edge of the reef, and at 300\r\nyards distance there was no bottom with a 300-yard line. Captain\r\nMoresby informs me, that at 100 fathoms from the mouth of the lagoon of\r\nDiego Garcia, he found no bottom with 150 fathoms; this is the more\r\nremarkable, as the slope is generally less abrupt in front of channels\r\nthrough a reef, owing to the accumulation of sediment. At Egmont\r\nIsland, also, at 150 fathoms from the reef, soundings were struck with\r\n150 fathoms. Lastly, at Cardoo atoll, only sixty yards from the reef,\r\nno bottom was obtained, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, with a\r\nline of 200 fathoms! The currents run with great force round these\r\natolls, and where they are strongest, the inclination appears to be\r\nmost abrupt. I am informed by the same authority, that wherever\r\nsoundings were obtained off these islands, the bottom was invariably\r\nsandy: nor was there any reason to suspect the existence of submarine\r\ncliffs, as there was at Keeling Island.[10] Here then occurs a\r\ndifficulty; can sand accumulate on a slope, which, in some cases,\r\nappears to exceed fifty-five degrees? It must be observed, that I speak\r\nof slopes where soundings were obtained, and not of such cases, as that\r\nof Cardoo, where the nature of the bottom is unknown, and where its\r\ninclination must be nearly vertical. M. Elie de Beaumont[11] has\r\nargued, and there is no higher authority on this subject, from the\r\ninclination at which snow slides down in avalanches, that a bed of sand\r\nor mud cannot be formed at a greater angle than thirty degrees.\r\nConsidering the number of soundings on sand, obtained round the Maldiva\r\nand Chagos atolls, which appears to indicate a greater angle, and the\r\nextreme abruptness of the sand-banks in the West Indies, as will be\r\nmentioned in the Appendix, I must conclude that the adhesive property\r\nof wet sand counteracts its gravity, in a much greater ratio than has\r\nbeen allowed for by M. Elie de Beaumont. From the facility with which\r\ncalcareous sand becomes agglutinated, it is not necessary to suppose\r\nthat the bed of loose sand is thick.\r\n\r\n [6] The form of the bottom round the Marshall atolls in the Northern\r\n Pacific is probably similar: Kotzebue (“First Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 16)\r\n says: “We had at a small distance from the reef, forty fathoms depth,\r\n which increased a little further so much that we could find no\r\n bottom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] I must be permitted to express my obligation to Captain Beechey,\r\n for the very kind manner in which he has given me information on\r\n several points, and to own the great assistance I have derived from\r\n his excellent published work.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Cook’s “Third Voyage,” vol. ii, chap. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] This fact is taken from a MS. account of these groups lent me by\r\n Captain Moresby. See also Captain Moresby’s paper on the Maldiva\r\n atolls in the _Geographical Journal_, vol. v, p. 401.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] Off some of the islands in the Low Archipelago the bottom appears\r\n to descend by ledges. Off Elizabeth Island, which, however, consists\r\n of raised coral, Captain Beechey (page 45, 4to ed.) describes three\r\n ledges: the first had an easy slope from the beach to a distance of\r\n about fifty yards: the second extended two hundred yards with\r\n twenty-five fathoms on it, and then ended abruptly, like the first;\r\n and immediately beyond this there was no bottom with two hundred\r\n fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] “Memoires pour servir à une description Geolog. de France,” tome\r\n iv, p. 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Beechey has observed, that the submarine slope is much less at\r\nthe extremities of the more elongated atolls in the Low Archipelago,\r\nthan at their sides; in speaking of Ducie’s Island he says[12] the\r\nbuttress, as it may be called, which “has the most powerful enemy (the\r\nS.W. swell) to oppose, is carried out much further, and with less\r\nabruptness than the other.” In some cases, the less inclination of a\r\ncertain part of the external slope, for instance of the northern\r\nextremities of the two Keeling atolls, is caused by a prevailing\r\ncurrent which there accumulates a bed of sand. Where the water is\r\nperfectly tranquil, as within a lagoon, the reefs generally grow up\r\nperpendicularly, and sometimes even overhang their bases; on the other\r\nhand, on the leeward side of Mauritius, where the water is generally\r\ntranquil, although not invariably so, the reef is very gently inclined.\r\nHence it appears that the exterior angle varies much; nevertheless in\r\nthe close similarity in form between the sections of Keeling atoll and\r\nof the atolls in the Low Archipelago, in the general steepness of the\r\nreefs of the Maldiva and Chagos atolls, and in the perpendicularity of\r\nthose rising out of water always tranquil, we may discern the effects\r\nof uniform laws; but from the complex action of the surf and currents,\r\non the growing powers of the coral and on the deposition of sediment,\r\nwe can by no means follow out all the results.\r\n\r\n [12] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to ed., p. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere islets have been formed on the reef, that part which I have\r\nsometimes called the “flat” and which is partly dry at low water,\r\nappears similar in every atoll. In the Marshall group in the North\r\nPacific, it may be inferred from Chamisso’s description, that the reef,\r\nwhere islets have not been formed on it, slopes gently from the\r\nexternal margin to the shores of the lagoon; Flinders states that the\r\nAustralian barrier has a similar inclination inwards, and I have no\r\ndoubt it is of general occurrence, although, according to Ehrenberg,\r\nthe reefs of the Red Sea offer an exception. Chamisso observes that\r\n“the red colour of the reef (at the Marshall atolls) under the breakers\r\nis caused by a Nullipora, which covers the stone _wherever the waves\r\nbeat_; and, under favourable circumstances, assumes a stalactical\r\nform,”—a description perfectly applicable to the margin of Keeling\r\natoll.[13] Although Chamisso does not state that the masses of\r\nNulliporæ form points or a mound, higher than the flat, yet I believe\r\nthat this is the case; for Kotzebue,[14] in another part, speaks of the\r\nrocks on the edge of the reef “as visible for about two feet at low\r\nwater,” and these rocks we may feel quite certain are not formed of\r\ntrue coral,[15] Whether a smooth convex mound of Nulliporæ, like that\r\nwhich appears as if artificially constructed to protect the margin of\r\nKeeling Island, is of frequent occurrence round atolls, I know not; but\r\nwe shall presently meet with it, under precisely the same form, on the\r\nouter edge of the “barrier-reefs” which encircle the Society Islands.\r\n\r\n [13] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 142. Near Porto Praya, in\r\n the Cape de Verde Islands, some basaltic rocks, lashed by no\r\n inconsiderable surf, were completely enveloped with a layer of\r\n Nulliporæ. The entire surface over many square inches, was coloured of\r\n a peach-blossomed red; the layer, however, was of no greater thickness\r\n than paper. Another kind, in the form of projecting knobs, grew in the\r\n same situation. These Nulliporæ are closely related to those described\r\n on the coral-reefs, but I believe are of different species.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 16. Lieutenant Nelson, in\r\n his excellent memoir in the Geological Transactions (vol. ii, p. 105),\r\n alludes to the rocky points mentioned by Kotzebue, and infers that\r\n they consist of Serpulæ, which compose incrusting masses on the reefs\r\n of Bermudas, as they likewise do on a sandstone bar off the coast of\r\n Brazil (which I have described in _London Phil. Journal,_ October\r\n 1841). These masses of Serpulæ hold the same position, relatively to\r\n the action of the sea, with the Nulliporæ on the coral-reefs in the\r\n Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] Captain Moresby, in his valuable paper “on the Northern atolls of\r\n Maldivas” (_Geographical Journal_, vol. v), says that the edges of the\r\n reefs there stand above water at low spring-tides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere appears to be scarcely a feature in the structure of Keeling\r\nreef, which is not of common, if not of universal occurrence, in other\r\natolls. Thus Chamisso describes[16] a layer of coarse conglomerate,\r\noutside the islets round the Marshall atolls which “appears on its\r\nupper surface uneven and eaten away.” From drawings, with appended\r\nremarks, of Diego Garcia in the Chagos group and of several of the\r\nMaldiva atolls, shown me by Captain Moresby,[17] it is evident that\r\ntheir outer coasts are subject to the same round of decay and\r\nrenovation as those of Keeling atoll. From the description of the\r\natolls in the Low Archipelago, given in Captain Beechey’s “Voyage,” it\r\nis not apparent that any conglomerate coral-rock was there observed.\r\n\r\n [16] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] See also Moresby on the Northern atolls of the Maldivas,\r\n _Geographical Journal_, vol v, p. 400.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lagoon in Keeling atoll is shallow; in the atolls of the Low\r\nArchipelago the depth varies from 20 to 38 fathoms, and in the Marshall\r\nGroup, according to Chamisso, from 30 to 35; in the Caroline atolls it\r\nis only a little less. Within the Maldiva atolls there are large spaces\r\nwith 45 fathoms, and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms. The\r\ngreater part of the bottom in most lagoons, is formed of sediment;\r\nlarge spaces have exactly the same depth, or the depth varies so\r\ninsensibly, that it is evident that no other means, excepting aqueous\r\ndeposition, could have leveled the surface so equally. In the Maldiva\r\natolls this is very conspicuous, and likewise in some of the Caroline\r\nand Marshall Islands. In the former large spaces consist of sand and\r\n_soft clay_; and Kotzebue speaks of clay having been found within one\r\nof the Marshall atolls. No doubt this clay is calcareous mud, similar\r\nto that at Keeling Island, and to that at Bermuda already referred to,\r\nas undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk, and which Lieutenant\r\nNelson says is called there pipe-clay.[18]\r\n\r\n [18] I may here observe that on the coast of Brazil, where there is\r\n much coral, the soundings near the land are described by Admiral\r\n Roussin, in the _Pilote du Brésil_, as siliceous sand, mingled with\r\n much finely comminuted particles of shells and coral. Further in the\r\n offing, for a space of 1,300 miles along the coast, from the Abrolhos\r\n Islands to Maranham, the bottom in many places is composed of “tuf\r\n blanc, mêlé ou formé de madrépores broyés.” This white substance,\r\n probably, is analogous to that which occurs within the above-mentioned\r\n lagoons; it is sometimes, according to Roussin, firm, and he compares\r\n it to mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the waves act with unequal force on the two sides of an atoll,\r\nthe islets appear to be first formed, and are generally of greater\r\ncontinuity on the more exposed shore. The islets, also, which are\r\nplaced to leeward, are in most parts of the Pacific liable to be\r\noccasionally swept entirely away by gales, equalling hurricanes in\r\nviolence, which blow in an opposite direction to the ordinary\r\ntrade-wind. The absence of the islets on the leeward side of atolls, or\r\nwhen present their lesser dimensions compared with those to windward,\r\nis a comparatively unimportant fact; but in several instances the reef\r\nitself on the leeward side, retaining its usual defined outline, does\r\nnot rise to the surface by several fathoms. This is the case with the\r\nsouthern side of Peros Banhos (Plate 1, Fig. 9) in the Chagos group,\r\nwith Mourileu atoll,[19] in the Caroline Archipelago, and with the\r\nbarrier-reef (Plate I, Fig. 8) of the Gambier Islands. I allude to the\r\nlatter reef, although belonging to\r\nanother class, because Captain Beechey was first led by it to observe\r\nthe peculiarity in the question. At Peros Banhos the submerged part is\r\nnine miles in length, and lies at an average depth of about five\r\nfathoms; its surface is nearly level, and consists of hard stone, with\r\na thin covering of loose sand. There is scarcely any living coral on\r\nit, even on the outer margin, as I have been particularly assured by\r\nCaptain Moresby; it is, in fact, a wall of dead coral-rock, having the\r\nsame width and transverse section with the reef in its ordinary state,\r\nof which it is a continuous portion. The living and perfect parts\r\nterminate abruptly, and abut on the submerged portions, in the same\r\nmanner as on the sides of an ordinary passage through the reef. The\r\nreef to leeward in other cases is nearly or quite obliterated, and one\r\nside of the lagoon is left open; for instance, at Oulleay (Caroline\r\nArchipelago), where a crescent-formed reef is fronted by an irregular\r\nbank, on which the other half of the annular reef probably once stood.\r\nAt Namonouito, in the same Archipelago, both these modifications of the\r\nreef concur; it consists of a great flat bank, with from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five fathoms water on it; for a length of more than forty miles\r\non its southern side it is open and without any reef, whilst on the\r\nother sides it is bounded by a reef, in parts rising to the surface and\r\nperfectly characterised, in parts lying some fathoms submerged. In the\r\nChagos group there are annular reefs, entirely submerged, which have\r\nthe same structure as the submerged and defined portions just\r\ndescribed. The Speaker’s Bank offers an excellent example of this\r\nstructure; its central expanse, which is about twenty-two fathoms deep,\r\nis twenty-four miles across; the external rim is of the usual width of\r\nannular reefs, and is well-defined; it lies between six and eight\r\nfathoms beneath the surface, and at the same depth there are scattered\r\nknolls in the lagoon. Captain Moresby believes the rim consists of dead\r\nrock, thinly covered with sand, and he is certain this is the case with\r\nthe external rim of the Great Chagos Bank, which is also essentially a\r\nsubmerged atoll. In both these cases, as in the submerged portion of\r\nthe reef at Peros Banhos, Captain Moresby feels sure that the quantity\r\nof living coral, even on the outer edge overhanging the deep-sea water,\r\nis quite insignificant. Lastly, in several parts of the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans there are banks, lying at greater depths than in the\r\ncases just mentioned, of the same form and size with the neighbouring\r\natolls, but with their atoll-like structure wholly obliterated. It\r\nappears from the survey of Freycinet, that there are banks of this kind\r\nin the Caroline Archipelago, and, as is reported, in the Low\r\nArchipelago. When we discuss the origin of the different classes of\r\ncoral formations, we shall see that the submerged state of the whole of\r\nsome atoll-formed reefs, and of portions of others, generally but not\r\ninvariably on the leeward side, and the existence of more deeply\r\nsubmerged banks now possessing little or no signs of their original\r\natoll-like structure, are probably the effects of a uniform\r\ncause,—namely, the death of the coral, during the subsidence of the\r\narea, in which the atolls or banks are situated.\r\n\r\n [19] Frederick Lutké’s “Voyage autour du Monde,” vol. ii, p. 291. See\r\n also his account of Namonouito, at pp. 97 and 105, and the chart of\r\n Oulleay in the Atlas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is seldom, with the exception of the Maldiva atolls, more than\r\ntwo or three channels, and generally only one leading into the lagoon,\r\nof sufficient depth for a ship to enter. in small atolls, there is\r\nusually not even one. Where there is deep water, for instance above\r\ntwenty fathoms, in the middle of the lagoon, the channels through the\r\nreef are seldom as deep as the centre,—it may be said that the rim only\r\nof the saucer-shaped hollow forming the lagoon is notched. Mr.\r\nLyell[20] has observed that the growth of the coral would tend to\r\nobstruct all the channels through a reef, except those kept open by\r\ndischarging the water, which during high tide and the greater part of\r\neach ebb is thrown over its circumference. Several facts indicate that\r\na considerable quantity of sediment is likewise discharged through\r\nthese channels; and Captain Moresby informs me that he has observed,\r\nduring the change of the monsoon, the sea discoloured to a distance off\r\nthe entrances into the Maldiva and Chagos atolls. This, probably, would\r\ncheck the growth of the coral in them, far more effectually than a mere\r\ncurrent of water. In the many small atolls without any channel, these\r\ncauses have not prevented the entire ring attaining the surface. The\r\nchannels, like the submerged and effaced parts of the reef, very\r\ngenerally though not invariably occur on the leeward side of the atoll,\r\nor on that side, according to Beechey,[21] which, from running in the\r\nsame direction with the prevalent wind, is not fully exposed to it.\r\nPassages between the islets on the reef, through which boats can pass\r\nat high water, must not be confounded with ship-channels, by which the\r\nannular reef itself is breached. The passages between the islets occur,\r\nof course, on the windward as well as on the leeward side; but they are\r\nmore frequent and broader to leeward, owing to the lesser dimensions of\r\nthe islets on that side.\r\n\r\n [20] “Principles of Geology,” vol. iii, p. 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to ed., vol. i, p. 189.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Keeling atoll the shores of the lagoon shelve gradually, where the\r\nbottom is of sediment, and irregularly or abruptly where there are\r\ncoral-reefs; but this is by no means the universal structure in other\r\natolls. Chamisso,[22] speaking in general terms of the lagoons in the\r\nMarshall atolls, says the lead generally sinks “from a depth of two or\r\nthree fathoms to twenty or twenty-four, and you may pursue a line in\r\nwhich on one side of the boat you may see the bottom, and on the other\r\nthe azure-blue deep water.” The shores of the lagoon-like channel\r\nwithin the barrier-reef at Vanikoro have a similar structure. Captain\r\nBeechey has described a modification of this structure (and he believes\r\nit is not uncommon) in two atolls in the Low Archipelago, in which the\r\nshores of the lagoon descend by a few, broad, slightly inclined ledges\r\nor steps: thus at Matilda atoll,[23] the great exterior reef, the\r\nsurface of which is gently inclined towards and beneath the surface of\r\nthe lagoon, ends abruptly in a little cliff three fathoms deep; at its\r\nfoot, a ledge forty yards wide extends, shelving gently inwards\r\nlike the surface-reef, and terminated by a second little cliff five\r\nfathoms deep; beyond this, the bottom of the lagoon slopes to twenty\r\nfathoms, which is the average depth of its centre. These ledges seem to\r\nbe formed of coral-rock; and Captain Beechey says that the lead often\r\ndescended several fathoms through holes in them. In some atolls, all\r\nthe coral reefs or knolls in the lagoon come to the surface at low\r\nwater; in other cases of rarer occurrence, all lie at nearly the same\r\ndepth beneath it, but most frequently they are quite irregular,—some\r\nwith perpendicular, some with sloping sides,—some rising to the\r\nsurface, and others lying at all intermediate depths from the bottom\r\nupwards. I cannot, therefore, suppose that the union of such reefs\r\ncould produce even one uniformly sloping ledge, and much less two or\r\nthree, one beneath the other, and each terminated by an abrupt wall. At\r\nMatilda Island, which offers the best example of the step-like\r\nstructure, Captain Beechey observes that the coral-knolls within the\r\nlagoon are quite irregular in their height. We shall hereafter see that\r\nthe theory which accounts for the ordinary form of atolls, apparently\r\nincludes this occasional peculiarity in their structure.\r\n\r\n [22] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n [23] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to ed., vol. i, p. 160. At Whitsunday Island\r\n the bottom of the lagoon slopes gradually towards the centre, and then\r\n deepens suddenly, the edge of the bank being nearly perpendicular.\r\n This bank is formed of coral and dead shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a group of atolls, there sometimes occur small, flat,\r\nvery low islands of coral formation, which probably once included a\r\nlagoon, since filled up with sediment and coral-reefs. Captain Beechey\r\nentertains no doubt that this has been the case with the two small\r\nislands, which alone of thirty-one surveyed by him in the Low\r\nArchipelago, did not contain lagoons. Romanzoff Island (in lat. 15 deg\r\nS.) is described by Chamisso[24] as formed by a dam of madreporitic\r\nrock inclosing a flat space, thinly covered with trees, into which the\r\nsea on the leeward side occasionally breaks. North Keeling atoll\r\nappears to be in a rather less forward stage of conversion into land;\r\nit consists of a horse-shoe shaped strip of land surrounding a muddy\r\nflat, one mile in its longest axis, which is covered by the sea only at\r\nhigh water. When describing South Keeling atoll, I endeavoured to show\r\nhow slow the final process of filling up a lagoon must be;\r\nnevertheless, as all causes do tend to produce this effect, it is very\r\nremarkable that not one instance, as I believe, is known of a\r\nmoderately sized lagoon being filled up even to the low water-line at\r\nspring-tides, much less of such a one being converted into land. It is,\r\nlikewise, in some degree remarkable, how few atolls, except small ones,\r\nare surrounded by a single linear strip of land, formed by the union of\r\nseparate islets. We cannot suppose that the many atolls in the Pacific\r\nand Indian Oceans all have had a late origin, and yet should they\r\nremain at their present level, subjected only to the action of the sea\r\nand to the growing powers of the coral, during as many centuries as\r\nmust have elapsed since any of the earlier tertiary epochs, it cannot,\r\nI think, be doubted that their lagoons and the islets on their reef,\r\nwould present a totally different appearance from what they now do.\r\nThis consideration leads to the suspicion that some renovating agency\r\n(namely subsidence) comes into play at intervals, and perpetuates their\r\noriginal structure.\r\n\r\n [24] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 221.\r\n\r\n_Section III_—ATOLLS OF THE MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO—GREAT CHAGOS BANK\r\n\r\nMaldiva Archipelago.—Ring-formed reefs, marginal and central.—Great\r\ndepths in the lagoons of the southern atolls.—Reefs in the lagoons all\r\nrising to the surface.—Position of islets and breaches in the reefs,\r\nwith respect to the prevalent winds and action of the\r\nwaves.—Destruction of islets.—Connection in the position and submarine\r\nfoundation of distinct atolls.—The apparent disseverment of large\r\natolls.—The Great Chagos Bank.—Its submerged condition and\r\nextraordinary structure.\r\n\r\nAlthough occasional references have been made to the Maldiva atolls,\r\nand to the banks in the Chagos group, some points of their structure\r\ndeserve further consideration. My description is derived from an\r\nexamination of the admirable charts lately published from the survey of\r\nCaptain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell, and more especially from\r\ninformation which Captain Moresby has communicated to me in the kindest\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe Maldiva Archipelago is 470 miles in length, with an average breadth\r\nof about 50 miles. The form and dimensions of the atolls, and their\r\nsingular position in a double line, may be seen, but not well, in the\r\ngreatly reduced chart (Fig. 6) in  Plate II. The dimensions of the\r\nlongest atoll in the group (called by the double name of\r\nMilla-dou-Madou and Tilla-dou-Matte) have already been given; it is 88\r\nmiles in a medial and slightly curved line, and is less than 20 miles\r\nin its broadest part. Suadiva, also, is a noble atoll, being 44 miles\r\nacross in one direction, and 34 in another, and the great included\r\nexpanse of water has a depth of between 250 and 300 feet. The smaller\r\natolls in this group differ in no respect from ordinary ones; but the\r\nlarger ones are remarkable from being breached by numerous deep-water\r\nchannels leading into the lagoon; for instance, there are 42 channels,\r\nthrough which a ship could enter the lagoon of Suadiva. In the three\r\nsouthern large atolls, the separate portions of reef between these\r\nchannels have the ordinary structure, and are linear; but in the other\r\natolls, especially the more northern ones, these portions are\r\nring-formed, like miniature atolls. Other ring-formed reefs rise out of\r\nthe lagoons, in the place of those irregular ones which ordinarily\r\noccur there. In the reduction of the chart of Mahlos Mahdoo (Plate II,\r\nFig. 4), it was not found easy to define the islets and the little\r\nlagoons within each reef, so that the ring-formed structure is very\r\nimperfectly shown; in the large published charts of Tilla-dou-Matte,\r\nthe appearance of these rings, from standing further apart from each\r\nother, is very remarkable. The rings on the margin are generally\r\nelongated; many of them are three, and some even five miles, in\r\ndiameter; those within the lagoon are usually smaller, few being more\r\nthan two miles across, and the greater number rather less than one. The\r\ndepth of the little lagoon within these small annular reefs is\r\ngenerally from five to seven fathoms, but occasionally more; and in Ari\r\natoll many of the central ones are twelve, and some even more than\r\ntwelve fathoms deep. These rings rise abruptly from the platform or\r\nbank, on which they are placed; their outer margin is\r\ninvariably bordered by living coral[25] within which there is a flat\r\nsurface of coral rock; of this flat, sand and fragments have in many\r\ncases accumulated and been converted into islets, clothed with\r\nvegetation. I can, in fact, point out no essential difference between\r\nthese little ring-formed reefs (which, however, are larger, and contain\r\ndeeper lagoons than many true atolls that stand in the open sea), and\r\nthe most perfectly characterised atolls, excepting that the ring-formed\r\nreefs are based on a shallow foundation, instead of on the floor of the\r\nopen sea, and that instead of being scattered irregularly, they are\r\ngrouped closely together on one large platform, with the marginal rings\r\narranged in a rudely formed circle.\r\n\r\n [25] Captain Moresby informs me that _Millepora complanata_ is one of\r\n the commonest kinds on the outer margin, as it is at Keeling atoll.\r\n\r\nThe perfect series which can be traced from portions of simple linear\r\nreef, to others including long linear lagoons, and from these again to\r\noval or almost circular rings, renders it probable that the latter are\r\nmerely modifications of the linear or normal state. It is conformable\r\nwith this view, that the ring-formed reefs on the margin, even where\r\nmost perfect and standing furthest apart, generally have their longest\r\naxes directed in the line which the reef would have held, if the atoll\r\nhad been bounded by an ordinary wall. We may also infer that the\r\ncentral ring-formed reefs are modifications of those irregular ones,\r\nwhich are found in the lagoons of all common atolls. It appears from\r\nthe charts on a large scale, that the ring-like structure is contingent\r\non the marginal channels or breaches being wide; and, consequently, on\r\nthe whole interior of the atoll being freely exposed to the waters of\r\nthe open sea. When the channels are narrow or few in number, although\r\nthe lagoon be of great size and depth (as in Suadiva), there are no\r\nring-formed reefs; where the channels are somewhat broader, the\r\nmarginal portions of reef, and especially those close to the larger\r\nchannels, are ring-formed, but the central ones are not so; where they\r\nare broadest, almost every reef throughout the atoll is more or less\r\nperfectly ring-formed. Although their presence is thus contingent on\r\nthe openness of the marginal channels, the theory of their formation,\r\nas we shall hereafter see, is included in that of the parent atolls, of\r\nwhich they form the separate portions.\r\n\r\nThe lagoons of all the atolls in the southern part of the Archipelago\r\nare from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part.\r\nThis is well exemplified in the case of Addoo, the southernmost atoll\r\nin the group, for although only nine miles in its longest diameter, it\r\nhas a depth of thirty-nine fathoms, whereas all the other small atolls\r\nhave comparatively shallow lagoons; I can assign no adequate cause for\r\nthis difference in depth. In the central and deepest part of the\r\nlagoons, the bottom consists, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, of\r\nstiff clay (probably a calcareous mud); nearer the border it consists\r\nof sand, and in the channels through the reef, of hard sand-banks,\r\nsandstone, conglomerate rubble, and a little live coral. Close outside\r\nthe reef and the line joining its detached portions (where intersected\r\nby many channels), the bottom is sandy, and it slopes abruptly into\r\nunfathomable depths.\r\nIn most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in\r\nthe channels; but in Tilla-dou-Matte, where the marginal ring-formed\r\nreefs stand far apart, the same depth is carried across the entire\r\natoll, from the deep-water line on one side to that on the other. I\r\ncannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these\r\natolls,—a great sandy and generally concave disc rises abruptly from\r\nthe unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its border\r\nsymmetrically fringed with oval basins of coral-rock, just lipping the\r\nsurface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each\r\ncontaining a little lake of clear water!\r\n\r\nIn the southern Maldiva atolls, of which there are nine large ones, all\r\nthe small reefs within the lagoons come to the surface, and are dry at\r\nlow water spring-tides; hence in navigating them, there is no danger\r\nfrom submarine banks. This circumstance is very remarkable, as within\r\nsome atolls, for instance those of the neighbouring Chagos group, not a\r\nsingle reef comes to the surface, and in most other cases a few only\r\ndo, and the rest lie at all intermediate depths from the bottom\r\nupwards. When treating of the growth of coral I shall again refer to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the neighbourhood of the Maldiva Archipelago the winds,\r\nduring the monsoons, blow during nearly an equal time from opposite\r\nquarters, and although, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, the\r\nwesterly winds are the strongest, yet the islets are almost all placed\r\non the eastern side of the northern atolls, and on the south-eastern\r\nside of the southern atolls. That the formation of the islets is due to\r\ndetritus thrown up from the outside, as in the ordinary manner, and not\r\nfrom the interior of the lagoons, may, I think be safely inferred from\r\nseveral considerations, which it is hardly worth while to detail. As\r\nthe easterly winds are not the strongest, their action probably is\r\naided by some prevailing swell or current.\r\n\r\nIn groups of atolls, exposed to a trade-wind, the ship-channels into\r\nthe lagoons are almost invariably situated on the leeward or less\r\nexposed side of the reef, and the reef itself is sometimes either\r\nwanting there, or is submerged. A strictly analogous, but different\r\nfact, may be observed at the Maldiva atolls—namely, that where two\r\natolls stand in front of each other, the breaches in the reef are the\r\nmost numerous on their near, and therefore less exposed, sides. Thus on\r\nthe near sides of Ari and the two Nillandoo atolls, which face S. Mãle,\r\nPhaleedoo, and Moloque atolls, there are seventy-three deep-water\r\nchannels, and only twenty-five on their outer sides; on the near side\r\nof the three latter named atolls there are fifty-six openings, and only\r\nthirty-seven on their outsides. It is scarcely possible to attribute\r\nthis difference to any other cause than the somewhat different action\r\nof the sea on the two sides, which would ensue from the protection\r\nafforded by the two rows of atolls to each other. I may here remark\r\nthat in most cases, the conditions favourable to the greater\r\naccumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect\r\ncontinuity on one side of the atoll than on the other, have concurred,\r\nbut this has not been the case with the Maldivas; for we have seen that\r\nthe islets are placed on the eastern or south-eastern\r\nsides, whilst the breaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side,\r\nwhere protected by an opposite atoll. The reef being more continuous on\r\nthe outer and more exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each\r\nother, accords with the fact, that the reef of the southern atolls is\r\nmore continuous than that of the northern ones; for the former, as I am\r\ninformed by Captain Moresby, are more constantly exposed than the\r\nnorthern atolls to a heavy surf.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first formation of some of the islets in this\r\nArchipelago is known to the inhabitants; on the other hand, several\r\nislets, and even some of those which are believed to be very old, are\r\nnow fast wearing away. The work of destruction has, in some instances,\r\nbeen completed in ten years. Captain Moresby found on one water-washed\r\nreef the marks of wells and graves, which were excavated when it\r\nsupported an islet. In South Nillandoo atoll, the natives say that\r\nthree of the islets were formerly larger: in North Nillandoo there is\r\none now being washed away; and in this latter atoll Lieutenant Prentice\r\nfound a reef, about six hundred yards in diameter, which the natives\r\npositively affirmed was lately an island covered with cocoa-nut trees.\r\nIt is now only partially dry at low water spring-tides, and is (in\r\nLieutenant Prentice’s words) “entirely covered with live coral and\r\nmadrepore.” In the northern part, also, of the Maldiva Archipelago and\r\nin the Chagos group, it is known that some of the islets are\r\ndisappearing. The natives attribute these effects to variations in the\r\ncurrents of the sea. For my own part I cannot avoid suspecting that\r\nthere must be some further cause, which gives rise to such a cycle of\r\nchange in the action of the currents of the great and open ocean.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the atolls in this Archipelago are so related to each other\r\nin form and position, that at the first glance one is led to suspect\r\nthat they have originated in the disseverment of a single one. Mãle\r\nconsists of three perfectly characterised atolls, of which the shape\r\nand relative position are such, that a line drawn closely round all\r\nthree, gives a symmetrical figure; to see this clearly, a larger chart\r\nis required than that of the Archipelago in Plate II; the channel\r\nseparating the two northern Male atolls is only little more than a mile\r\nwide, and no bottom was found in it with 100 fathoms. Powell’s Island\r\nis situated at the distance of two miles and a half off the northern\r\nend of Mahlos Mahdoo (see Fig. 4, Plate II), at the exact point where\r\nthe two sides of the latter, if prolonged, would meet; no bottom,\r\nhowever, was found in the channel with 200 fathoms; in the wider\r\nchannel between Horsburgh atoll and the southern end of Mahlos Mahdoo,\r\nno bottom was found with 250 fathoms. In these and similar cases, the\r\nrelation consists only in the form and position of the atolls. But in\r\nthe channel between the two Nillandoo atolls, although three miles and\r\na quarter wide, soundings were struck at the depth of 200 fathoms; the\r\nchannel between Ross and Ari atolls is four miles wide, and only 150\r\nfathoms deep. Here then we have, besides the relation of form, a\r\nsubmarine connection. The fact of soundings having been obtained\r\nbetween two separate and perfectly characterised atolls is in itself\r\ninteresting, as it has never, I believe, been effected in any of the\r\nmany\r\nother groups of atolls in the Pacific and Indian seas. In continuing to\r\ntrace the connection of adjoining atolls, if a hasty glance be taken at\r\nthe chart (Fig. 4, Plate II) of Mahlos Mahdoo, and the line of\r\nunfathomable water be followed, no one will hesitate to consider it as\r\none atoll. But a second look will show that it is divided by a\r\nbifurcating channel, of which the northern arm is about one mile and\r\nthree-quarters in width, with an average depth of 125 fathoms, and the\r\nsouthern one three-quarters of a mile wide, and rather less deep. These\r\nchannels resemble in the slope of their sides and general form, those\r\nwhich separate atolls in every respect distinct; and the northern arm\r\nis wider than that dividing two of the Mãle atolls. The ring-formed\r\nreefs on the sides of this bifurcating channel are elongated, so that\r\nthe northern and southern portions of Mahlos Mahdoo may claim, as far\r\nas their external outline is concerned, to be considered as distinct\r\nand perfect atolls. But the intermediate portion, lying in the fork of\r\nthe channel, is bordered by reefs less perfect than those which\r\nsurround any other atoll in the group of equally small dimensions.\r\nMahlos Mahdoo, therefore, is in every respect in so intermediate a\r\ncondition, that it may be considered either as a single atoll nearly\r\ndissevered into three portions, or as three atolls almost perfect and\r\nintimately connected. This is an instance of a very early stage of the\r\napparent disseverment of an atoll, but a still earlier one in many\r\nrespects is exhibited at Tilla-dou-Matte. In one part of this atoll,\r\nthe ring-formed reefs stand so far apart from each other, that the\r\ninhabitants have given different names to the northern and southern\r\nhalves; nearly all the rings, moreover, are so perfect and stand so\r\nseparate, and the space from which they rise is so level and unlike a\r\ntrue lagoon, that we can easily imagine the conversion of this one\r\ngreat atoll, not into two or three portions, but into a whole group of\r\nminiature atolls. A perfect series such as we have here traced,\r\nimpresses the mind with an idea of actual change; and it will hereafter\r\nbe seen, that the theory of subsidence, with the upward growth of the\r\ncoral, modified by accidents of probable occurrence, will account for\r\nthe occasional disseverment of large atolls.\r\n\r\n_Plate II_—Great Chagos Bank, New Caledonia, Menchikoff Atoll, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great Chagos Bank]\r\n\r\nFig. 1.—GREAT CHAGOS BANK, in the Indian Ocean; taken from the survey\r\nby Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell; the parts which are shaded,\r\nwith the exception of two or three islets on the western and northern\r\nsides, do not rise to the surface, but are submerged from four to ten\r\nfathoms; the banks bounded by the dotted lines lie from fifteen to\r\ntwenty fathoms beneath the surface, and are formed of sand; the central\r\nspace is of mud, and from thirty to fifty fathoms deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2.—A vertical section, on the same scale, in an eastern and\r\nwestern line across the Great Chagos Bank, given for the sake of\r\nexhibiting more clearly its structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Caledonia, Menchikoff Atoll, etc.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3.—Menchikoff Atoll (or lagoon-island), in the Marshall\r\nArchipelago, Northern Pacific Ocean; from Krusenstern’s “Atlas of the\r\nPacific;” originally surveyed by Captain Hagemeister; the depth within\r\nthe lagoons is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4.—MAHLOS MAHDOO ATOLL, together with Horsburgh atoll, in the\r\nMaldiva Archipelago; from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant\r\nPowell; the white spaces in the middle of the separate small reefs,\r\nboth on the margin and in the middle part, are meant to represent\r\nlittle lagoons; but it was found not possible to distinguish them\r\nclearly from the small islets, which have been formed on these same\r\nsmall reefs; many of the smaller reefs could not be introduced; the\r\nnautical mark (dot over a dash) over the figures 250 and 200, between\r\nMahlos Mahdoo and Horsburgh atoll and Powell’s island, signifies that\r\nsoundings were not obtained at these depths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5.—NEW CALEDONIA, in the western part of the Pacific; from\r\nKrusenstern’s “Atlas,” compiled from several surveys; I have slightly\r\naltered the northern point of the reef, in accordance with the “Atlas\r\nof the Voyage of the _Astrolabe_.” In Krusenstern’s “Atlas,” the reef\r\nis represented by a single line with crosses; I have for the sake of\r\nuniformity added an interior line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6.—MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO, in the Indian Ocean; from the survey by\r\nCaptain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Chagos bank alone remains to be described. In the Chagos\r\ngroup there are some ordinary atolls, some annular reefs rising to the\r\nsurface but without any islets on them, and some atoll-formed banks,\r\neither quite submerged, or nearly so. Of the latter, the Great Chagos\r\nBank is much the largest, and differs in its structure from the others:\r\na plan of it is given in Plate II, Fig. 1, in which, for the sake of\r\nclearness, I have had the parts under ten fathoms deep finely shaded:\r\nan east and west vertical section is given in Fig. 2, in which the\r\nvertical scale has been necessarily exaggerated. Its longest axis is\r\nninety nautical miles, and another line drawn at right angles to the\r\nfirst, across the broadest part, is seventy. The central part consists\r\nof a level muddy flat, between forty and fifty fathoms deep, which is\r\nsurrounded on all sides, with the exception of some breaches, by the\r\nsteep edges of a set of banks, rudely arranged in a circle. These banks\r\nconsist of sand, with a very little live coral; they vary in breadth\r\nfrom five to twelve miles, and on an average lie about sixteen fathoms\r\nbeneath the surface;\r\nthey are bordered by the steep edges of a third narrow and upper bank,\r\nwhich forms the rim to the whole. This rim is about a mile in width,\r\nand with the exception of two or three spots where islets have been\r\nformed, is submerged between five and ten fathoms. It consists of\r\nsmooth hard rock, covered with a thin layer of sand, but with scarcely\r\nany live coral; it is steep on both sides, and outwards slopes abruptly\r\ninto unfathomable depths. At the distance of less than half a mile from\r\none part, no bottom was found with 190 fathoms; and off another point,\r\nat a somewhat greater distance, there was none with 210 fathoms. Small\r\nsteep-sided banks or knolls, covered with luxuriantly growing coral,\r\nrise from the interior expanse to the same level with the external rim,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, is formed only of dead rock. It is impossible\r\nto look at the plan (Fig. 1, Plate II), although reduced to so small a\r\nscale, without at once perceiving that the Great Chagos Bank is, in the\r\nwords of Captain Moresby,[26] “nothing more than a half-drowned atoll.”\r\nBut of what great dimensions, and of how extraordinary an internal\r\nstructure? We shall hereafter have to consider both the cause of its\r\nsubmerged condition, a state common to other banks in the group, and\r\nthe origin of the singular submarine terraces, which bound the central\r\nexpanse: these, I think, it can be shown, have resulted from a cause\r\nanalogous to that which has produced the bifurcating channel across\r\nMahlos Mahdoo.\r\n\r\n [26] This officer has had the kindness to lend me an excellent MS.\r\n account of the Chagos Islands; from this paper, from the published\r\n charts, and from verbal information communicated to me by Captain\r\n Moresby, the above account of the Great Chagos Bank is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II BARRIER REEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nClosely resemble in general form and structure atoll-reefs.—Width and\r\ndepth of the lagoon-channels.—Breaches through the reef in front of\r\nvalleys, and generally on the leeward side.—Checks to the filling up of\r\nthe lagoon-channels.—Size and constitution of the encircled\r\nislands.—Number of islands within the same reef.—Barrier-reefs of New\r\nCaledonia and Australia.—Position of the reef relative to the slope of\r\nthe adjoining land.—Probable great thickness of barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\nThe term “barrier” has been generally applied to that vast reef which\r\nfronts the N.E. shore of Australia, and by most voyagers likewise to\r\nthat on the western coast of New Caledonia. At one time I thought it\r\nconvenient thus to restrict the term, but as these reefs are similar in\r\nstructure, and in position relatively to the land, to those, which,\r\nlike a wall with a deep moat within, encircle many smaller islands, I\r\nhave classed them together. The reef, also, on the west coast of New\r\nCaledonia, circling round the extremities of the island, is an\r\nintermediate form between a small encircling reef and the Australian\r\nbarrier, which stretches for a thousand miles in nearly a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe geographer Balbi has in effect described those barrier-reefs, which\r\nencircle moderately sized islands, by calling them atolls with high\r\nland rising from within their central expanse. The general resemblance\r\nbetween the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes may be seen in the\r\nsmall, but accurately reduced charts on Plate I,[1] and this\r\nresemblance can be further shown to extend to every part of the\r\nstructure. Beginning with the outside of the reef; many scattered\r\nsoundings off Gambier, Oualan, and some other encircled islands, show\r\nthat close to the breakers there exists a narrow shelving margin,\r\nbeyond which the ocean becomes suddenly unfathomable; but off the west\r\ncoast of New Caledonia, Captain Kent[2] found no bottom with 150\r\nfathoms, at two ships’ length from the reef; so that the slope here\r\nmust be nearly as precipitous as off the Maldiva atolls.\r\n\r\n [1] The authorities from which these charts have been reduced,\r\n together with some remarks on them are given in a separately appended\r\n page, descriptive of the Plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Dalrymple, “Hydrog. Mem.” vol. iii.\r\n\r\nI can give little information regarding the kinds of corals which live\r\non the outer margin. When I visited the reef at Tahiti, although it was\r\nlow water, the surf was too violent for me to see the living masses;\r\nbut, according to what I heard from some intelligent native chiefs,\r\nthey resemble in their rounded and branchless forms, those on the\r\nmargin of Keeling atoll. The extreme verge of the reef, which was\r\nvisible between the breaking waves at low water, consisted of a\r\nrounded, convex, artificial-like breakwater, entirely coated with\r\nNulliporæ, and absolutely similar to that which I have described at\r\nKeeling atoll. From what I heard when at Tahiti, and from the writings\r\nof the Revs. W. Ellis and J. Williams, I conclude that this peculiar\r\nstructure is common to most of the encircled islands of the Society\r\nArchipelago. The reef within this mound or breakwater, has an extremely\r\nirregular surface, even more so than between the islets on the reef of\r\nKeeling atoll, with which alone (as there are no islets on the reef of\r\nTahiti) it can properly be compared. At Tahiti, the reef is very\r\nirregular in width; but round many other encircled islands, for\r\ninstance, Vanikoro or Gambier Islands (Figs 1 and 8, Plate I), it is\r\nquite as regular, and of the same average width, as in true atolls.\r\nMost barrier-reefs on the inner side slope irregularly into the\r\nlagoon-channel (as the space of deep water separating the reef from the\r\nincluded land may be called), but at Vanikoro the reef slopes only for\r\na short distance, and then terminates abruptly in a submarine wall,\r\nforty feet high,—a structure absolutely similar to that described by\r\nChamisso in the Marshall atolls.\r\n\r\nIn the Society Archipelago, Ellis[3] states, that the reefs generally\r\nlie at the distance of from one to one and a half miles, and,\r\noccasionally, even at more than three miles, from the shore. The\r\ncentral mountains are generally bordered by a fringe of flat, and often\r\nmarshy, alluvial\r\nland, from one to four miles in width. This fringe consists of\r\ncoral-sand and detritus thrown up from the lagoon-channel, and of soil\r\nwashed down from the hills; it is an encroachment on the channel,\r\nanalogous to that low and inner part of the islets in many atolls which\r\nis formed by the accumulation of matter from the lagoon. At Hogoleu\r\n(Fig. 2, Plate I), in the Caroline Archipelago,[4] the reef on the\r\nsouth side is no less than twenty miles; on the east side, five; and on\r\nthe north side, fourteen miles from the encircled high islands.\r\n\r\n [3] Consult, on this and other points, the “Polynesian Researches,” by\r\n the Rev. W. Ellis, an admirable work, full of curious information.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] See “Hydrographical Mem.” and the “Atlas of the Voyage of the\r\n _Astrolabe_,” by Captain Dumont D’Urville, p. 428.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lagoon channels may be compared in every respect with true lagoons.\r\nIn some cases they are open, with a level bottom of fine sand; in\r\nothers they are choked up with reefs of delicately branched corals,\r\nwhich have the same general character as those within the Keeling\r\natoll. These internal reefs either stand separately, or more commonly\r\nskirt the shores of the included high islands. The depth of the\r\nlagoon-channel round the Society Islands varies from two or three to\r\nthirty fathoms; in Cook’s[5] chart of Ulieta, however, there is one\r\nsounding laid down of forty-eight fathoms; at Vanikoro there are\r\nseveral of fifty-four and one of fifty-six and a half fathoms\r\n(English), a depth which even exceeds by a little that of the interior\r\nof the great Maldiva atolls. Some barrier-reefs have very few islets on\r\nthem; whilst others are surmounted by numerous ones; and those round\r\npart of Bolabola (Plate I, Fig. 5) form a single linear strip. The\r\nislets first appear either on the angles of the reef, or on the sides\r\nof the breaches through it, and are generally most numerous on the\r\nwindward side. The reef to leeward retaining its usual width, sometimes\r\nlies submerged several fathoms beneath the surface; I have already\r\nmentioned Gambier Island as an instance of this structure. Submerged\r\nreefs, having a less defined outline, dead, and covered with sand, have\r\nbeen observed (see Appendix) off some parts of Huaheine and Tahiti. The\r\nreef is more frequently breached to leeward than to windward; thus I\r\nfind in Krusenstern’s “Memoir on the Pacific,” that there are passages\r\nthrough the encircling reef on the leeward side of each of the seven\r\nSociety Islands, which possess ship-harbours; but that there are\r\nopenings to windward through the reef of only three of them. The\r\nbreaches in the reef are seldom as deep as the interior lagoon-like\r\nchannel; they generally occur in front of the main valleys, a\r\ncircumstance which can be accounted for, as will be seen in the fourth\r\nchapter, without much difficulty. The breaches being situated in front\r\nof the valleys, which descend indifferently on all sides, explains\r\ntheir more frequent occurrence through the windward side of\r\nbarrier-reefs than through the windward side of atolls,—for in atolls\r\nthere is no included land to influence the position of the breaches.\r\n\r\n [5] See the chart in vol. i of Hawkesworth’s 4to ed. of “Cook’s First\r\n Voyage.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the lagoon-channels round mountainous islands\r\nhave not in every instance been long ago filled up with coral and\r\nsediment; but it is more easily accounted for than appears at first\r\nsight. In cases like that of Hogoleu and the Gambier Islands, where a\r\nfew\r\nsmall peaks rise out of a great lagoon, the conditions scarcely differ\r\nfrom those of an atoll, and I have already shown, at some length, that\r\nthe filling up of a true lagoon must be an extremely slow process.\r\nWhere the channel is narrow, the agency, which on unprotected coasts is\r\nmost productive of sediment, namely the force of the breakers, is here\r\nentirely excluded, and the reef being breached in the front of the main\r\nvalleys, much of the finer mud from the rivers must be transported into\r\nthe open sea. As a current is formed by the water thrown over the edge\r\nof atoll-formed reefs, which carries sediment with it through the\r\ndeep-water breaches, the same thing probably takes place in\r\nbarrier-reefs, and this would greatly aid in preventing the\r\nlagoon-channel from being filled up. The low alluvial border, however,\r\nat the foot of the encircled mountains, shows that the work of filling\r\nup is in progress; and at Maura (Plate I, Fig. 6), in the Society\r\ngroup, it has been almost effected, so that there remains only one\r\nharbour for small craft.\r\n\r\nIf we look at a set of charts of barrier-reefs, and leave out in\r\nimagination the encircled land, we shall find that, besides the many\r\npoints already noticed of resemblance, or rather of identity in\r\nstructure with atolls, there is a close general agreement in form,\r\naverage dimensions, and grouping. Encircling barrier-reefs, like\r\natolls, are generally elongated, with an irregularly rounded, though\r\nsometimes angular outline. There are atolls of all sizes, from less\r\nthan two miles in diameter to sixty miles (excluding Tilla-dou-Matte,\r\nas it consists of a number of almost independent atoll-formed reefs);\r\nand there are encircling barrier-reefs from three miles and a half to\r\nforty-six miles in diameter,—Turtle Island being an instance of the\r\nformer, and Hogoleu of the latter. At Tahiti the encircled island is\r\nthirty-six miles in its longest axis, whilst at Maurua it is only a\r\nlittle more than two miles. It will be shown, in the last chapter in\r\nthis volume, that there is the strictest resemblance in the grouping of\r\natolls and of common islands, and consequently there must be the same\r\nresemblance in the grouping of atolls and of encircling barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\nThe islands lying within reefs of this class, are of very various\r\nheights. Tahiti[6] is 7,000 feet; Maurua about 800; Aitutaki 360, and\r\nManouai only 50. The geological nature of the included land varies: in\r\nmost cases it is of ancient volcanic origin, owing apparently to the\r\nfact that islands of this nature are most frequent within all great\r\nseas; some, however, are of madreporitic limestone, and others of\r\nprimary formation, of which latter kind New Caledonia offers the best\r\nexample. The central land consists either of one island, or of several:\r\nthus, in the Society group, Eimeo stands by itself; while Taha and\r\nRaiatea (Fig. 3, Plate I), both moderately large islands of nearly\r\nequal size, are included in one reef. Within the reef of the Gambier\r\ngroup there are four large and some smaller islands (Fig. 8, Plate I);\r\nwithin that of\r\nHogoleu (Fig. 2, Plate I) nearly a dozen small islands are scattered\r\nover the expanse of one vast lagoon.\r\n\r\n [6] The height of Tahiti is given from Captain Beechey; Maurua from\r\n Mr. F. D. Bennett (_Geograph. Journ._ vol. viii, p. 220); Aitutaki\r\n from measurements made on board the _Beagle_; and Manouai or Harvey\r\n Island, from an estimate by the Rev. J. Williams. The two latter\r\n islands, however, are not in some respects well characterised examples\r\n of the encircled class.\r\n\r\nAfter the details now given, it may be asserted that there is not one\r\npoint of essential difference between encircling barrier-reefs and\r\natolls: the latter enclose a simple sheet of water, the former encircle\r\nan expanse with one or more islands rising from it. I was much struck\r\nwith this fact, when viewing, from the heights of Tahiti, the distant\r\nisland of Eimeo standing within smooth water, and encircled by a ring\r\nof snow-white breakers. Remove the central land, and an annular reef\r\nlike that of an atoll in an early stage of its formation is left;\r\nremove it from Bolabola, and there remains a circle of linear\r\ncoral-islets, crowned with tall cocoa-nut trees, like one of the many\r\natolls scattered over the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\nThe barrier-reefs of Australia and of New Caledonia deserve a separate\r\nnotice from their great dimensions. The reef on the west coast of New\r\nCaledonia (Fig. 5, Plate II) is 400 miles in length; and for a length\r\nof many leagues it seldom approaches within eight miles of the shore;\r\nand near the southern end of the island, the space between the reef and\r\nthe land is sixteen miles in width. The Australian barrier extends,\r\nwith a few interruptions, for nearly a thousand miles; its average\r\ndistance from the land is between twenty and thirty miles; and in some\r\nparts from fifty to seventy. The great arm of the sea thus included, is\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five fathoms deep, with a sandy bottom; but towards\r\nthe southern end, where the reef is further from the shore, the depth\r\ngradually increases to forty, and in some parts to more than sixty\r\nfathoms. Flinders[7] has described the surface of this reef as\r\nconsisting of a hard white agglomerate of different kinds of coral,\r\nwith rough projecting points. The outer edge is the highest part; it is\r\ntraversed by narrow gullies, and at rare intervals is breached by\r\nship-channels. The sea close outside is profoundly deep; but, in front\r\nof the main breaches, soundings can sometimes be obtained. Some low\r\nislets have been formed on the reef.\r\n\r\n [7] Flinders’ “Voyage to Terra Australis,” vol. ii, p. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one important point in the structure of barrier-reefs which\r\nmust here be considered. The accompanying diagrams represent north and\r\nsouth vertical sections, taken through the highest points of Vanikoro,\r\nGambier, and Maurua Islands, and through their encircling reefs. The\r\nscale both in the horizontal and vertical direction is the same,\r\nnamely, a quarter of an inch to a nautical mile. The height and width\r\nof these islands is known; and I have attempted to represent the form\r\nof the land from the shading of the hills in the large published\r\ncharts. It has long been remarked, even from the time of Dampier, that\r\nconsiderable degree of relation subsists between the inclination of\r\nthat part of the land which is beneath water and that above it; hence\r\nthe dotted line in the three sections, probably, does not widely differ\r\nin inclination from the actual submarine prolongation of the land. If\r\nwe now look at the outer edge of the reef (AA), and bear in mind that\r\nthe plummet on the right hand represents a depth of 1,200 feet, we must\r\nconclude that the vertical thickness of these barrier coral-reefs is\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vertical thickness of Vanikoro, Gambier and Maurua.]\r\n\r\n1. VANIKORO, from the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,” by D.\r\nD’Urville.\r\n2. GAMBIER ISLAND, from Beechey.\r\n3. MAURUA, from the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _ Coquille_,” by\r\nDuperrey.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal line is the level of the sea, from which on the right\r\nhand a plummet descends, representing a depth of 200 fathoms, or 1,200\r\nfeet. The vertical shading shows the section of the land, and the\r\nhorizontal shading that of the encircling barrier-reef: from the\r\nsmallness of the scale, the lagoon-channel could not be represented.\r\nAA.—Outer edge of the coral-reefs, where the sea breaks.\r\nBB.—The shore of the encircled islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must observe that if the sections had been taken in any other\r\ndirection across these islands, or across other encircled islands,[8]\r\nthe result would have been the same. In the succeeding chapter it will\r\nbe shown that reef-building polypifers cannot flourish at great\r\ndepths,—for instance, it is highly improbable that they could exist at\r\na quarter of the depth represented by the plummet on the right hand of\r\nthe woodcut. Here there is a great _apparent_ difficulty—how were the\r\nbasal parts of these barrier-reef formed? It will, perhaps, occur to\r\nsome, that the actual reefs formed of coral are not of great thickness,\r\nbut that before their first growth, the coasts of these encircled\r\nislands were deeply eaten into, and a broad but shallow submarine ledge\r\nthus left, on the edge of which the coral grew; but if this had been\r\nthe case, the shore would have been invariably bounded by lofty cliffs,\r\nand not have sloped down to the lagoon-channel, as it does in many\r\ninstances. On this view,[9] moreover, the cause of the reef springing\r\nup at such a great distance from the land, leaving a deep and broad\r\nmoat within, remains altogether unexplained. A supposition of the same\r\nnature,\r\nand appearing at first more probable is, that the reefs sprung up from\r\nbanks of sediment, which had accumulated round the shore previously to\r\nthe growth of the coral; but the extension of a bank to the same\r\ndistance round an unbroken coast, and in front of those deep arms of\r\nthe sea (as in Raiatea, see Plate II, Fig. 3) which penetrate nearly to\r\nthe heart of some encircled islands, is exceedingly improbable. And\r\nwhy, again, should the reef spring up, in some cases steep on both\r\nsides like a wall, at a distance of two, three or more miles from the\r\nshore, leaving a channel often between two hundred and three hundred\r\nfeet deep, and rising from a depth which we have reason to believe is\r\ndestructive to the growth of coral? An admission of this nature cannot\r\npossibly be made. The existence, also, of the deep channel, utterly\r\nprecludes the idea of the reef having grown outwards, on a foundation\r\nslowly formed on its outside, by the accumulation of sediment and coral\r\ndetritus. Nor, again, can it be asserted, that the reef-building corals\r\nwill not grow, excepting at a great distance from the land; for, as we\r\nshall soon see, there is a whole class of reefs, which take their name\r\nfrom growing closely attached (especially where the sea is deep) to the\r\nbeach. At New Caledonia (see Plate II, Fig. 5) the reefs which run in\r\nfront of the west coast are prolonged in the same line 150 miles beyond\r\nthe northern extremity of the island, and this shows that some\r\nexplanation, quite different from any of those just suggested, is\r\nrequired. The continuation of the reefs on each side of the submarine\r\nprolongation of New Caledonia, is an exceedingly interesting fact, if\r\nthis part formerly existed as the northern extremity of the island, and\r\nbefore the attachment of the coral had been worn down by the action of\r\nthe sea, or if it originally existed at its present height, with or\r\nwithout beds of sediment on each flank, how can we possibly account for\r\nthe reefs, not growing on the crest of this submarine portion, but\r\nfronting its sides, in the same line with the reefs which front the\r\nshores of the lofty island? We shall hereafter see, that there is one,\r\nand I believe only one, solution of this difficulty.\r\n\r\n [8] In the fifth chapter an east and west section across the Island of\r\n Bolabola and its barrier-reefs is given, for the sake of illustrating\r\n another point. The unbroken line in it (woodcut No. 5) is the section\r\n referred to. The scale is .57 of an inch to a mile; it is taken from\r\n the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _Coquille_,” by Duperrey. The depth of\r\n the lagoon-channel is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] The Rev. D. Tyerman and Mr. Bennett (“Journal of Voyage and\r\n Travels,” vol. i, p. 215) have briefly suggested this explanation of\r\n the origin of the encircling reefs of the Society Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other supposition to account for the position of encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs remains, but it is almost too preposterous to be\r\nmentioned; namely, that they rest on enormous submarine craters,\r\nsurrounding the included islands. When the size, height, and form of\r\nthe islands in the Society group are considered, together with the fact\r\nthat all are thus encircled, such a notion will be rejected by almost\r\nevery one. New Caledonia, moreover, besides its size, is composed of\r\nprimitive formations, as are some of the Comoro Islands;[10] and\r\nAitutaki consists of calcareous rock. We must, therefore, reject these\r\nseveral explanations, and conclude that the vertical thickness of\r\nbarrier-reefs, from their outer edges to the foundation on which they\r\nrest (from AA in the section to the dotted lines) is really great; but\r\nin this, there is no difficulty, for it is not necessary to suppose\r\nthat the coral has sprung up from an immense depth, as will be evident\r\nwhen the theory of the upward growth of coral-reefs, during the slow\r\nsubsidence of their foundation, is discussed.\r\n\r\n [10] I have been informed that this is the case by Dr. Allan of\r\n Forres, who has visited this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III FRINGING OR SHORE-REEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nReefs of Mauritius.—Shallow channel within the reef.—Its slow filling\r\nup.—Currents of water formed within it.—Upraised reefs.—Narrow\r\nfringing-reefs in deep seas.—Reefs on the coast of East Africa and of\r\nBrazil.—Fringing-reefs in very shallow seas, round banks of sediment\r\nand on worn-down islands.—Fringing-reefs affected by currents of the\r\nsea.—Coral coating the bottom of the sea, but not forming reefs.\r\n\r\nFringing-reefs, or, as they have been called by some voyagers,\r\nshore-reefs, whether skirting an island or part of a continent, might\r\nat first be thought to differ little, except in generally being of less\r\nbreadth, from barrier-reefs. As far as the superficies of the actual\r\nreef is concerned this is the case; but the absence of an interior\r\ndeep-water channel, and the close relation in their horizontal\r\nextension with the probable slope beneath the sea of the adjoining\r\nland, present essential points of difference.\r\n\r\nThe reefs which fringe the island of Mauritius offer a good example of\r\nthis class. They extend round its whole circumference, with the\r\nexception of two or three parts,[1] where the coast is almost\r\nprecipitous, and where, if as is probable the bottom of the sea has a\r\nsimilar inclination, the coral would have no foundation on which to\r\nbecome attached. A similar fact may sometimes be observed even in reefs\r\nof the barrier class, which follow much less closely the outline of the\r\nadjoining land; as, for instance, on the south-east and precipitous\r\nside of Tahiti, where the encircling reef is interrupted. On the\r\nwestern side of the Mauritius, which was the only part I visited, the\r\nreef generally lies at the distance of about half a mile from the\r\nshore; but in some parts it is distant from one to two, and even three\r\nmiles. But even in this last case, as the coast-land is gently inclined\r\nfrom the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach, and as the soundings\r\noutside the reef indicate an equally gentle slope beneath the water,\r\nthere is no reason for supposing that the basis of the reef, formed by\r\nthe prolongation of the strata of the island, lies at a greater depth\r\nthan that at which the polypifers could begin constructing the reef.\r\nSome allowance, however, must be made for the outward extension of the\r\ncorals on a foundation of sand and detritus, formed from their own\r\nwear, which would give to the reef a somewhat greater vertical\r\nthickness, than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\n [1] This fact is stated on the authority of the Officier du Roi, in\r\n his extremely interesting “Voyage à l’Isle de France,” undertaken in\r\n 1768. According to Captain Carmichael (Hooker’s _Bot. Misc._ vol. ii,\r\n p. 316) on one part of the coast there is a space for sixteen miles\r\n without a reef.\r\n\r\nThe outer edge of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island\r\nis tolerably well defined, and is a little higher than any other part.\r\nIt chiefly consists of large strongly branched corals, of the genus\r\nMadrepora, which also form a sloping bed some way out to sea: the\r\nkinds of coral growing in this part will be described in the ensuing\r\nchapter. Between the outer margin and the beach, there is a flat space\r\nwith a sandy bottom and a few tufts of living coral; in some parts it\r\nis so shallow, that people, by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies,\r\ncan wade across it at low water; in other parts it is deeper, seldom\r\nhowever exceeding ten or twelve feet, so that it offers a safe coasting\r\nchannel for boats. On the eastern and windward side of the island,\r\nwhich is exposed to a heavy surf, the reef was described to me as\r\nhaving a hard smooth surface, very slightly inclined inwards, just\r\ncovered at low-water, and traversed by gullies; it appears to be quite\r\nsimilar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes.\r\n\r\nThe reef of Mauritius, in front of every river and streamlet, is\r\nbreached by a straight passage: at Grand Port, however, there is a\r\nchannel like that within a barrier-reef; it extends parallel to the\r\nshore for four miles, and has an average depth of ten or twelve\r\nfathoms; its presence may probably be accounted for by two rivers which\r\nenter at each end of the channel, and bend towards each other. The fact\r\nof reefs of the fringing class being always breached in front of\r\nstreams, even of those which are dry during the greater part of the\r\nyear, will be explained, when the conditions unfavourable to the growth\r\nof coral are considered. Low coral-islets, like those on barrier-reefs\r\nand atolls, are seldom formed on reefs of this class, owing apparently\r\nin some cases to their narrowness, and in others to the gentle slope of\r\nthe reef outside not yielding many fragments to the breakers. On the\r\nwindward side, however, of the Mauritius, two or three small islets\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nIt appears, as will be shown in the ensuing chapter, that the action of\r\nthe surf is favourable to the vigorous growth of the stronger corals,\r\nand that sand or sediment, if agitated by the waves, is injurious to\r\nthem. Hence it is probable that a reef on a shelving shore, like that\r\nof Mauritius, would at first grow up, not attached to the actual beach,\r\nbut at some little distance from it; and the corals on the outer margin\r\nwould be the most vigorous. A shallow channel would thus be formed\r\nwithin the reef, and as the breakers are prevented acting on the shores\r\nof the island, and as they do not ordinarily tear up many fragments\r\nfrom the outside, and as every streamlet has its bed prolonged in a\r\nstraight line through the reef, this channel could be filled up only\r\nvery slowly with sediment. But a beach of sand and of fragments of the\r\nsmaller kinds of coral seems, in the case of Mauritius, to be slowly\r\nencroaching on the shallow channel. On many shelving and sandy coasts,\r\nthe breakers tend to form a bar of sand a little way from the beach,\r\nwith a slight increase of depth within it; for instance, Captain\r\nGrey[2] states that the west coast of Australia, in latitude 24°, is\r\nfronted by a sand bar about two hundred yards in width, on which there\r\nis only two feet of water; but within it the depth increases to two\r\nfathoms. Similar bars, more or less perfect, occur on other coasts. In\r\nthese cases I suspect that the shallow channel (which no doubt during\r\nstorms is occasionally obliterated) is scooped out by the flowing away\r\nof the\r\nwater thrown beyond the line, on which the waves break with the\r\ngreatest force. At Pernambuco a bar of hard sandstone,[3] which has the\r\nsame external form and height as a coral-reef, extends nearly parallel\r\nto the coast; within this bar currents, apparently caused by the water\r\nthrown over it during the greater part of each tide, run strongly, and\r\nare wearing away its inner wall. From these facts it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, that within most fringing-reefs, especially within those lying\r\nsome distance from the land, a return stream must carry away the water\r\nthrown over the outer edge; and the current thus produced, would tend\r\nto prevent the channel being filled up with sediment, and might even\r\ndeepen it under certain circumstances. To this latter belief I am led,\r\nby finding that channels are almost universally present within the\r\nfringing-reefs of those islands which have undergone recent elevatory\r\nmovements; and this could hardly have been the case, if the conversion\r\nof the very shallow channel into land had not been counteracted to a\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\n [2] Captain Grey’s “Journal of Two Expeditions,” vol. i, p. 369.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I have described this singular structure in the _Lond. and Edin.\r\n Phil. Mag.,_ October 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fringing-reef, if elevated in a perfect condition above the level of\r\nthe sea, ought to present the singular appearance of a broad dry moat\r\nwithin a low mound. The author[4] of an interesting pedestrian tour\r\nround the Mauritius, seems to have met with a structure of this kind:\r\nhe says “J’observai que là, où la mer étale, indépendamment des rescifs\r\ndu large, il y à terre _une espèce d’effoncement_ ou chemin couvert\r\nnaturel. On y pourrait mettre du canon,” etc. In another place he adds,\r\n“Avant de passer le Cap, on remarque un gros banc de corail élevé de\r\nplus de quinze pieds: c’est une espèce de rescif, que la mer abandonné,\r\nil regne au pied une longue flaque d’eau, dont on pourrait faire un\r\nbassin pour de petits vaisseaux.” But the margin of the reef, although\r\nthe highest and most perfect part, from being most exposed to the surf,\r\nwould generally during a slow rise of the land be either partially or\r\nentirely worn down to that level, at which corals could renew their\r\ngrowth on its upper edge. On some parts of the coast-land of Mauritius\r\nthere are little hillocks of coral-rock, which are either the last\r\nremnants of a continuous reef, or of low islets formed on it. I\r\nobserved that two such hillocks between Tamarin Bay and the Great Black\r\nRiver; they were nearly twenty feet high, about two hundred yards from\r\nthe present beach, and about thirty feet above its level. They rose\r\nabruptly from a smooth surface, strewed with worn fragments of coral.\r\nThey consisted in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone, and in\r\ntheir upper of great blocks of several species of Astræa and Madrepora,\r\nloosely aggregated; they were divided into irregular beds, dipping\r\nseaward, in one hillock at an angle of 8°, and in the other at 18°. I\r\nsuspect that the superficial parts of the reefs, which have been\r\nupraised together with the islands they fringe, have generally been\r\nmuch more modified by the wearing action of the sea, than those of\r\nMauritius.\r\n\r\n [4] “Voyage à l’Isle de France, par un Officier du Roi,” part i, pp.\r\n 192, 200.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany islands[5] are fringed by reefs quite similar to those of\r\nMauritius; but on coasts where the sea deepens very suddenly the reefs\r\nare much narrower, and their limited extension seems evidently to\r\ndepend on the high inclination of the submarine slope; a relation,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, does not exist in reefs of the barrier class.\r\nThe fringing-reefs on steep coasts are frequently not more than from\r\nfifty to one hundred yards in width; they have a nearly smooth, hard\r\nsurface, scarcely uncovered at low water, and without any interior\r\nshoal channel, like that within those fringing-reefs, which lie at a\r\ngreater distance from the land. The fragments torn up during gales from\r\nthe outer margin are thrown over the reef on the shores of the island.\r\nI may give as instances, Wateeo, where the reef is described by Cook as\r\nbeing a hundred yards wide; and Mauti and Elizabeth[6] Islands, where\r\nit is only fifty yards in width: the sea round these islands is very\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n [5] I may give Cuba, as another instance; Mr. Taylor (_Loudon’s Mag.\r\n of Nat. Hist.,_ vol. ix, p. 449) has described a reef several miles in\r\n length between Gibara and Vjaro, which extends parallel to the shore\r\n at the distance of between half and the third part of a mile, and\r\n encloses a space of shallow water, with a sandy bottom and tufts of\r\n coral. Outside the edge of the reef, which is formed of great\r\n branching corals, the depth is six and seven fathoms. This coast has\r\n been upheaved at no very distant geological period.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Mauti is described by Lord Byron in the voyage of H.M.S. _\r\n Blonde_, and Elizabeth Island by Captain Beechey.\r\n\r\n\r\nFringing-reefs, like barrier-reefs, both surround islands, and front\r\nthe shores of continents. In the charts of the eastern coast of Africa,\r\nby Captain Owen, many extensive fringing-reefs are laid down; thus, for\r\na space of nearly forty miles, from latitude 1° 15′ to 1° 45′ S., a\r\nreef fringes the shore at an average distance of rather more than one\r\nmile, and therefore at a greater distance than is usual in reefs of\r\nthis class; but as the coast-land is not lofty, and as the bottom\r\nshoals very gradually (the depth being only from eight to fourteen\r\nfathoms at a mile and a half outside the reef), its extension thus far\r\nfrom the land offers no difficulty. The external margin of this reef is\r\ndescribed, as formed of projecting points, within which there is a\r\nspace, from six to twelve feet deep, with patches of living coral on\r\nit. At Mukdeesha (lat. 2° 1′ N.) “the port is formed,” it is said,[7]\r\n“by a long reef extending eastward, four or five miles, within which\r\nthere is a narrow channel, with ten to twelve feet of water at low\r\nspring-tides;” it lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the\r\nshore. Again, in the plan of Mombas (lat. 4° S.), a reef extends for\r\nthirty-six miles, at the distance of from half a mile to one mile and a\r\nquarter from the shore; within it, there is a channel navigable “for\r\ncanoes and small craft,” between six and fifteen feet deep: outside the\r\nreef the depth is about thirty fathoms at the distance of nearly half a\r\nmile. Part of this reef is very symmetrical, and has a uniform breadth\r\nof two hundred yards.\r\n\r\n [7] Owen’s “Africa,” vol. i, p. 357, from which work the foregoing\r\n facts are likewise taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast of Brazil is in many parts fringed by reefs. Of these, some\r\nare not of coral formation; for instance, those near Bahia and in front\r\nof Pernambuco; but a few miles south of this latter city, the reef\r\nfollows[8] so closely every turn of the shore, that I can hardly doubt\r\nit is of coral; it runs at the distance of three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the land, and within it the depth is from ten to fifteen feet. I\r\nwas assured by an intelligent pilot that at Ports Frances and Maceio,\r\nthe outer part of the reef consists of living coral, and the inner of a\r\nwhite stone, full of large irregular cavities, communicating with the\r\nsea. The bottom of the sea off the coast of Brazil shoals gradually to\r\nbetween thirty and forty fathoms, at the distance of between nine and\r\nten leagues from the land.\r\n\r\n [8] See Baron Roussin’s “Pilote du Brésil,” and accompanying\r\n hydrographical memoir.\r\n\r\nFrom the description now given, we must conclude that the dimensions\r\nand structure of fringing-reefs depend entirely on the greater or less\r\ninclination of the submarine slope, conjoined with the fact that\r\nreef-building polypifers can exist only at limited depths. It follows\r\nfrom this, that where the sea is very shallow, as in the Persian Gulf\r\nand in parts of the East Indian Archipelago, the reefs lose their\r\nfringing character, and appear as separate and irregularly scattered\r\npatches, often of considerable area. From the more vigorous growth of\r\nthe coral on the outside, and from the conditions being less favourable\r\nin several respects within, such reefs are generally higher and more\r\nperfect in their marginal than in their central parts; hence these\r\nreefs sometimes assume (and this circumstance ought not to be\r\noverlooked) the appearance of atolls; but they differ from atolls in\r\ntheir central expanse being much less deep, in their form being less\r\ndefined, and in being based on a shallow foundation. But when in a deep\r\nsea reefs fringe banks of sediment, which have accumulated beneath the\r\nsurface, round either islands or submerged rocks, they are\r\ndistinguished with difficulty on the one hand from encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs, and on the other from atolls. In the West Indies there\r\nare reefs, which I should probably have arranged under both these\r\nclasses, had not the existence of large and level banks, lying a little\r\nbeneath the surface, ready to serve as the basis for the attachment of\r\ncoral, been occasionally brought into view by the entire or partial\r\nabsence of reefs on them, and had not the formation of such banks,\r\nthrough the accumulation of sediment now in progress, been sufficiently\r\nevident. Fringing-reefs sometimes coat, and thus protect the\r\nfoundations of islands, which have been worn down by the surf to the\r\nlevel of the sea. According to Ehrenberg, this has been extensively the\r\ncase with the islands in the Red Sea, which formerly ranged parallel to\r\nthe shores of the mainland, with deep water within them: hence the\r\nreefs now coating their bases are situated relatively to the land like\r\nbarrier-reefs, although not belonging to that class; but there are, as\r\nI believe, in the Red Sea some true barrier-reefs. The reefs of this\r\nsea and of the West Indies will be described in the Appendix. In some\r\ncases, fringing-reefs appear to be considerably modified in outline by\r\nthe course of the prevailing currents. Dr. J. Allan informs me that on\r\nthe east coast of Madagascar almost every headland and low point of\r\nsand has a coral-reef extending from it in a S.W. and N.E. line,\r\nparallel\r\nto the currents on that shore. I should think the influence of the\r\ncurrents chiefly consisted in causing an extension, in a certain\r\ndirection, of a proper foundation for the attachment of the coral.\r\nRound many intertropical islands, for instance the Abrolhos on the\r\ncoast of Brazil surveyed by Captain Fitzroy, and, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Cuming, round the Philippines, the bottom of the sea is entirely\r\ncoated by irregular masses of coral, which although often of large\r\nsize, do not reach the surface and form proper reefs. This must be\r\nowing, either to insufficient growth, or to the absence of those kinds\r\nof corals which can withstand the breaking of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe three classes, atoll-formed, barrier, and fringing-reefs, together\r\nwith the modifications just described of the latter, include all the\r\nmost remarkable coral formations anywhere existing. At the commencement\r\nof the last chapter in the volume, where I detail the principles on\r\nwhich the map (Plate III) is coloured, the exceptional cases will be\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND GROWTH OF CORAL-REEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I will give all the facts which I have collected,\r\nrelating to the distribution of coral-reefs,—to the conditions\r\nfavourable to their increase,—to the rate of their growth,—and to the\r\ndepth at which they are formed.\r\n\r\nThese subjects have an important bearing on the theory of the origin of\r\nthe different classes of coral-reefs.\r\n\r\n_Section I_—ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS, AND ON THE CONDITIONS\r\nFAVOURABLE TO THEIR INCREASE\r\n\r\nWith regard to the limits of latitude, over which coral-reefs extend, I\r\nhave nothing new to add. The Bermuda Islands, in 32° 15′ N., is the\r\npoint furthest removed from the equator, in which they appear to exist;\r\nand it has been suggested that their extension so far northward in this\r\ninstance is owing to the warmth of the Gulf Stream. In the Pacific, the\r\nLoo Choo Islands, in latitude 27° N., have reefs on their shores, and\r\nthere is an atoll in 28° 30′, situated N.W. of the Sandwich\r\nArchipelago. In the Red Sea there are coral-reefs in latitude 30°. In\r\nthe southern hemisphere coral-reefs do not extend so far from the\r\nequatorial sea. In the Southern Pacific there are only a few reefs\r\nbeyond the line of the tropics, but Houtmans Abrolhos, on the western\r\nshores of Australia in latitude 29° S., are of coral formation.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of volcanic land, owing to the lime generally evolved\r\nfrom it, has been thought to be favourable to the increase of\r\ncoral-reefs.\r\nThere is, however, not much foundation for this view; for nowhere are\r\ncoral-reefs more extensive than on the shores of New Caledonia, and of\r\nnorth-eastern Australia, which consist of primary formations; and in\r\nthe largest groups of atolls, namely the Maldiva, Chagos, Marshall,\r\nGilbert, and Low Archipelagoes, there is no volcanic or other kind of\r\nrock, excepting that formed of coral.\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of coral-reefs in certain large areas within the\r\ntropical seas, is a remarkable fact. Thus no coral-reefs were observed,\r\nduring the surveying voyages of the _Beagle_ and her tender on the west\r\ncoast of South America south of the equator, or round the Galapagos\r\nIslands. It appears, also, that there are none[1] north of the equator;\r\nMr. Lloyd, who surveyed the Isthmus of Panama, remarked to me, that\r\nalthough he had seen corals living in the Bay of Panama, yet he had\r\nnever observed any reefs formed by them. I at first attributed this\r\nabsence of reefs on the coasts of Peru and of the Galapagos Islands,[2]\r\nto the coldness of the currents from the south, but the Gulf of Panama\r\nis one of the hottest pelagic districts in the world.[3] In the central\r\nparts of the Pacific there are islands entirely free from reefs; in\r\nsome few of these cases I have thought that this was owing to recent\r\nvolcanic action; but the existence of reefs round the greater part of\r\nHawaii, one of the Sandwich Islands, shows that recent volcanic action\r\ndoes not necessarily prevent their growth.\r\n\r\n [1] I have been informed that this is the case, by Lieutenant Ryder,\r\n R.N., and others who have had ample opportunities for observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The mean temperature of the surface sea from observations made by\r\n the direction of Captain Fitzroy on the shores of the Galapagos\r\n Islands, between the 16th of September and the 20th of October, 1835,\r\n was 68° Fahr. The lowest temperature observed was 58.5° at the\r\n south-west end of Albemarle Island; and on the west coast of this\r\n island, it was several times 62° and 63°. The mean temperature of the\r\n sea in the Low Archipelago of atolls, and near Tahiti, from similar\r\n observations made on board the _Beagle_, was (although further from\r\n the equator) 77.5°, the lowest any day being 76.5°. Therefore we have\r\n here a difference of 9.5° in mean temperature, and 18° in extremes; a\r\n difference doubtless quite sufficient to affect the distribution of\r\n organic beings in the two areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Humboldt’s “Personal Narrative,” vol. vii, p. 434.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I stated that the bottom of the sea round some\r\nislands is thickly coated with living corals, which nevertheless do not\r\nform reefs, either from insufficient growth, or from the species not\r\nbeing adapted to contend with the breaking waves.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by several people, that there are no coral-reefs on\r\nthe west coast of Africa,[4] or round the islands in the Gulf of\r\nGuinea. This perhaps may be attributed, in part, to the sediment\r\nbrought down by the many rivers debouching on that coast, and to the\r\nextensive mud-banks,\r\nwhich line great part of it. But the islands of St. Helena, Ascension,\r\nthe Cape Verdes, St. Paul’s, and Fernando Noronha, are, also, entirely\r\nwithout reefs, although they lie far out at sea, are composed of the\r\nsame ancient volcanic rocks, and have the same general form, with those\r\nislands in the Pacific, the shores of which are surrounded by gigantic\r\nwalls of coral-rock. With the exception of Bermuda, there is not a\r\nsingle coral-reef in the central expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. It\r\nwill, perhaps, be suggested that the quantity of carbonate of lime in\r\ndifferent parts of the sea, may regulate the presence of reefs. But\r\nthis cannot be the case, for at Ascension, the waves charged to excess\r\nprecipitate a thick layer of calcareous matter on the tidal rocks; and\r\nat St. Jago, in the Cape Verdes, carbonate of lime not only is abundant\r\non the shores, but it forms the chief part of some upraised\r\npost-tertiary strata. The apparently capricious distribution,\r\ntherefore, of coral-reefs, cannot be explained by any of these obvious\r\ncauses; but as the study of the terrestrial and better known half of\r\nthe world must convince every one that no station capable of supporting\r\nlife is lost,—nay more, that there is a struggle for each station,\r\nbetween the different orders of nature,—we may conclude that in those\r\nparts of the intertropical sea, in which there are no coral-reefs,\r\nthere are other organic bodies supplying the place of the reef-building\r\npolypifers. It has been shown in the chapter on Keeling atoll that\r\nthere are some species of large fish, and the whole tribe of Holothuriæ\r\nwhich prey on the tenderer parts of the corals. On the other hand, the\r\npolypifers in their turn must prey on some other organic beings; the\r\ndecrease of which from any cause would cause a proportionate\r\ndestruction of the living coral. The relations, therefore, which\r\ndetermine the formation of reefs on any shore, by the vigorous growth\r\nof the efficient kinds of coral, must be very complex, and with our\r\nimperfect knowledge quite inexplicable. From these considerations, we\r\nmay infer that changes in the condition of the sea, not obvious to our\r\nsenses, might destroy all the coral-reefs in one area, and cause them\r\nto appear in another: thus, the Pacific or Indian Ocean might become as\r\nbarren of coral-reefs as the Atlantic now is, without our being able to\r\nassign any adequate cause for such a change.\r\n\r\n [4] It might be concluded, from a paper by Captain Owen (_Geograph.\r\n Journ._, vol. ii, p. 89), that the reefs off Cape St. Anne and the\r\n Sherboro’ Islands were of coral, although the author states that they\r\n are not purely coralline. But I have been assured by Lieutenant\r\n Holland, R.N., that these reefs are not of coral, or at least that\r\n they do not at all resemble those in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been a question with some naturalists, which part of a reef is\r\nmost favourable to the growth of coral. The great mounds of living\r\nPorites and of Millepora round Keeling atoll occur exclusively on the\r\nextreme verge of the reef, which is washed by a constant succession of\r\nbreakers; and living coral nowhere else forms solid masses. At the\r\nMarshall islands the larger kinds of coral (chiefly species of Astræa,\r\na genus closely allied to Porites) “which form rocks measuring several\r\nfathoms in thickness,” prefer, according to Chamisso,[5] the most\r\nviolent surf. I have stated that the outer margin of the Maldiva atolls\r\nconsists of living corals (some of which, if not all, are of the same\r\nspecies with those at Keeling atoll), and here the surf is so\r\ntremendous, that even large ships have been thrown, by a single heave\r\nof the sea, high and dry on the reef, all on board thus escaping with\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nEhrenberg[6] remarks, that in the Red Sea the strongest corals live on\r\nthe outer reefs, and appear to love the surf; he adds, that the more\r\nbranched kinds abound a little way within, but that even these in still\r\nmore protected places, become smaller. Many other facts having a\r\nsimilar tendency might be adduced.[7] It has, however, been doubted by\r\nMM. Quoy and Gaimard, whether any kind of coral can even withstand,\r\nmuch less flourish in, the breakers of an open sea:[8] they affirm that\r\nthe saxigenous lithophytes flourish only where the water is tranquil,\r\nand the heat intense. This statement has passed from one geological\r\nwork to another; nevertheless, the protection of the whole reef\r\nundoubtedly is due to those kinds of coral, which cannot exist in the\r\nsituations thought by these naturalists to be most favourable to them.\r\nFor should the outer and living margin perish, of any one of the many\r\nlow coral-islands, round which a line of great breakers is incessantly\r\nfoaming, the whole, it is scarcely possible to doubt, would be washed\r\naway and destroyed, in less than half a century. But the vital energies\r\nof the corals conquer the mechanical power of the waves; and the large\r\nfragments of reef torn up by every storm, are replaced by the slow but\r\nsteady growth of the innumerable polypifers, which form the living zone\r\non its outer edge.\r\n\r\n [5] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage” (Eng. Trans.), vol. iii, pp. 142, 143,\r\n 331.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natur und Bildung der Corallen Bänke im\r\n rothen Meere,” p. 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] In the West Indies, as I am informed by Captain Bird Allen, R.N.,\r\n it is the common belief of those, who are best acquainted with the\r\n reefs, that the coral flourishes most, where freely exposed to the\r\n swell of the open sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] “Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” tome vi, pp. 276, 278.—“Là où\r\n les ondes sont agitées, les Lytophytés ne peuvent travailler, parce\r\n qu’elles détruiraient leurs fragiles édifices,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, it is certain, that the strongest and most massive\r\ncorals flourish, where most exposed. The less perfect state of the reef\r\nof most atolls on the leeward and less exposed side, compared with its\r\nstate to windward; and the analogous case of the greater number of\r\nbreaches on the near sides of those atolls in the Maldiva Archipelago,\r\nwhich afford some protection to each other, are obviously explained by\r\nthis circumstance. If the question had been, under what conditions the\r\ngreater number of species of coral, not regarding their bulk and\r\nstrength, were developed, I should answer,—probably in the situations\r\ndescribed by MM. Quoy and Gaimard, where the water is tranquil and the\r\nheat intense. The total number of species of coral in the\r\ncircumtropical seas must be very great: in the Red Sea alone, 120\r\nkinds, according to Ehrenberg,[9] have been observed.\r\n\r\n [9] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natur,” etc., p. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same author has observed that the recoil of the sea from a steep\r\nshore is injurious to the growth of coral, although waves breaking over\r\na bank are not so. Ehrenberg also states, that where there is much\r\nsediment, placed so as to be liable to be moved by the waves there is\r\nlittle or no coral; and a collection of living specimens placed by him\r\non a sandy shore died in the course of a few days.[10] An experiment,\r\nhowever, will presently be related in which some large masses of living\r\ncoral increased rapidly in size, after having been secured by stakes on\r\na sandbank. That loose sediment should be injurious to the living\r\npolypifers, appears, at first sight, probable; and accordingly, in\r\nsounding off Keeling atoll, and (as will hereafter be shown) off\r\nMauritius, the arming of the lead invariably came up clean, where the\r\ncoral was growing vigorously. This same circumstance has probably given\r\nrise to a strange belief, which, according to Captain Owen,[11] is\r\ngeneral amongst the inhabitants of the Maldiva atolls, namely that\r\ncorals have roots, and therefore that if merely broken down to the\r\nsurface, they grow up again; but, if rooted out, they are permanently\r\ndestroyed. By this means the inhabitants keep their harbours clear; and\r\nthus the French Governor of St. Mary’s in Madagascar, “cleared out and\r\nmade a beautiful little port at that place.” For it is probable that\r\nsand would accumulate in the hollows formed by tearing out the corals,\r\nbut not on the broken and projecting stumps, and therefore, in the\r\nformer case, the fresh growth of the coral might be thus prevented.\r\n\r\n [10] _Ibid_., p. 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Captain Owen on the Geography of the Maldiva Islands, _Geograph.\r\n Journal_, vol. ii, p. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I remarked that fringing-reefs are almost\r\nuniversally breached, where streams enter the sea.[12] Most authors\r\nhave attributed this fact to the injurious effects of the fresh water,\r\neven where it enters the sea only in small quantity, and during a part\r\nof the year. No doubt brackish water would prevent or retard the growth\r\nof coral; but I believe that the mud and sand which is deposited, even\r\nby rivulets when flooded, is a much more efficient check. The reef on\r\neach side of the channel leading into Port Louis at Mauritius, ends\r\nabruptly in a wall, at the foot of which I sounded and found a bed of\r\nthick mud. This steepness of the sides appears to be a general\r\ncharacter in such breaches. Cook,[13] speaking of one at Raiatea, says,\r\n“like all the rest, it is very steep on both sides.” Now, if it were\r\nthe fresh water mingling with the salt which prevented the growth of\r\ncoral, the reef certainly would not terminate abruptly, but as the\r\npolypifers nearest the impure stream would grow less vigorously than\r\nthose farther off, so would the reef gradually thin away. On the other\r\nhand, the sediment brought down from the land would only prevent the\r\ngrowth of the coral in the line of its deposition, but would not check\r\nit on the side, so that the reefs might increase till they overhung the\r\nbed of the channel. The breaches are much fewer in number, and front\r\nonly the larger valleys in reefs of the encircling barrier class. They\r\nprobably are kept open in the same manner as those into the lagoon of\r\nan atoll, namely, by the\r\nforce of the currents and the drifting outwards of fine sediment. Their\r\nposition in front of valleys, although often separated from the land by\r\ndeep water lagoon-channels, which it might be thought would entirely\r\nremove the injurious effects both of the fresh water and the sediment,\r\nwill receive a simple explanation when we discuss the origin of\r\nbarrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n [12] Lieutenant Wellstead and others have remarked that this is the\r\n case in the Red Sea; Dr. Rüppell (“Reise in Abyss.” Band. i, p. 142)\r\n says that there are pear-shaped harbours in the upraised coral-coast,\r\n into which periodical streams enter. From this circumstance, I\r\n presume, we must infer that before the upheaval of the strata now\r\n forming the coast-land, fresh water and sediment entered the sea at\r\n these points; and the coral being thus prevented growing, the\r\n pear-shaped harbours were produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] Cook’s “First Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 271 (Hawkesworth’s edit.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom every different station has its peculiar group\r\nof plants, and similar relations appear to prevail with corals. We have\r\nalready described the great difference between the corals within the\r\nlagoon of an atoll and those on its outer margin. The corals, also, on\r\nthe margin of Keeling Island occurred in zones; thus the _Porites_ and\r\n_Millepora complanata_ grow to a large size only where they are washed\r\nby a heavy sea, and are killed by a short exposure to the air; whereas,\r\nthree species of Nullipora also live amidst the breakers, but are able\r\nto survive uncovered for a part of each tide; at greater depths, a\r\nstrong Madrepora and _Millepora alcicornis_ are the commonest kinds,\r\nthe former appearing to be confined to this part, beneath the zone of\r\nmassive corals, minute encrusting corallines and other organic bodies\r\nlive. If we compare the external margin of the reef at Keeling atoll\r\nwith that on the leeward side of Mauritius, which are very differently\r\ncircumstanced, we shall find a corresponding difference in the\r\nappearance of the corals. At the latter place, the genus Madrepora is\r\npreponderant over every other kind, and beneath the zone of massive\r\ncorals there are large beds of Seriatopora. There is also a marked\r\ndifference, according to Captain Moresby,[14]between the great\r\nbranching corals of the Red Sea, and those on the reefs of the Maldiva\r\natolls.\r\n\r\n [14] Captain Moresby on the Northern Maldiva atolls, _Geograph.\r\n Journal_, vol. v, p. 401.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese facts, which in themselves are deserving of notice, bear,\r\nperhaps, not very remotely, on a remarkable circumstance which has been\r\npointed out to me by Captain Moresby, namely, that with very few\r\nexceptions, none of the coral-knolls within the lagoons of Peros\r\nBanhos, Diego Garcia, and the Great Chagos Bank (all situated in the\r\nChagos group), rise to the surface of the water; whereas all those,\r\nwith equally few exceptions, within Solomon and Egmont atolls in the\r\nsame group, and likewise within the large southern Maldiva atolls,\r\nreach the surface. I make these statements, after having examined the\r\ncharts of each atoll. In the lagoon of Peros Banhos, which is nearly\r\ntwenty miles across, there is only one single reef which rises to the\r\nsurface; in Diego Garcia there are seven, but several of these lie\r\nclose to the margin of the lagoon, and need scarcely have been\r\nreckoned; in the Great Chagos Bank there is not one. On the other hand,\r\nin the lagoons of some of the great southern Maldiva atolls, although\r\nthickly studded with reefs, every one without exception rises to the\r\nsurface; and on an average there are less than two submerged reefs in\r\neach atoll; in the northern atolls, however, the submerged lagoon-reefs\r\nare not quite so rare. The submerged reefs in the Chagos atolls\r\ngenerally have from one to seven fathoms water on them, but some have\r\nfrom seven to ten. Most of them are small with\r\nvery steep sides;[15] at Peros Banhos they rise from a depth of about\r\nthirty fathoms, and some of them in the Great Chagos Bank from above\r\nforty fathoms; they are covered, Captain Moresby informs me, with\r\nliving and healthy coral, two and three feet high, consisting of\r\nseveral species. Why then have not these lagoon-reefs reached the\r\nsurface, like the innumerable ones in the atolls above named? If we\r\nattempt to assign any difference in their external conditions, as the\r\ncause of this diversity, we are at once baffled. The lagoon of Diego\r\nGarcia is not deep, and is almost wholly surrounded by its reef; Peros\r\nBanhos is very deep, much larger, with many wide passages communicating\r\nwith the open sea. On the other hand, of those atolls, in which all or\r\nnearly all the lagoon-reefs have reached the surface, some are small,\r\nothers large, some shallow, others deep, some well-enclosed, and others\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n [15] Some of these statements were not communicated to me verbally by\r\n Captain Moresby, but are taken from the MS. account before alluded to,\r\n of the Chagos Group.\r\n\r\nCaptain Moresby informs me that he has seen a French chart of Diego\r\nGarcia made eighty years before his survey, and apparently very\r\naccurate; and from it he infers, that during this interval there has\r\nnot been the smallest change in the depth on any of the knolls within\r\nthe lagoon. It is also known that during the last fifty-one years, the\r\neastern channel into the lagoon has neither become narrower, nor\r\ndecreased in depth; and as there are numerous small knolls of living\r\ncoral within it, some change might have been anticipated. Moreover, as\r\nthe whole reef round the lagoon of this atoll has been converted into\r\nland—an unparalleled case, I believe, in an atoll of such large\r\nsize,—and as the strip of land is for considerable spaces more than\r\nhalf a mile wide—also a very unusual circumstance,—we have the best\r\npossible evidence, that Diego Garcia has remained at its present level\r\nfor a very long period. With this fact, and with the knowledge that no\r\nsensible change has taken place during eighty years in the\r\ncoral-knolls, and considering that every single reef has reached the\r\nsurface in other atolls, which do not present the smallest appearance\r\nof being older than Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos, and which are placed\r\nunder the same external conditions with them, one is led to conclude\r\nthat these submerged reefs, although covered with luxuriant coral, have\r\nno tendency to grow upwards, and that they would remain at their\r\npresent levels for an almost indefinite period.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of these knolls, from their position, size, and form,\r\nmany of them being only one or two hundred yards across, with a rounded\r\noutline, and precipitous sides,—it is indisputable that they have been\r\nformed by the growth of coral; and this makes the case much more\r\nremarkable. In Peros Banhos and in the Great Chagos Bank, some of these\r\nalmost columnar masses are 200 feet high, and their summits lie only\r\nfrom two to eight fathoms beneath the surface; therefore, a small\r\nproportional amount more of growth would cause them to attain the\r\nsurface, like those numerous knolls, which rise from an equally great\r\ndepth within the Maldiva atolls. We can hardly suppose that time has\r\nbeen wanting for the upward growth of\r\nthe coral, whilst in Diego Garcia, the broad annular strip of land,\r\nformed by the continued accumulation of detritus, shows how long this\r\natoll has remained at its present level. We must look to some other\r\ncause than the rate of growth; and I suspect it will be found in the\r\nreefs being formed of different species of corals, adapted to live at\r\ndifferent depths. The Great Chagos Bank is situated in the centre of\r\nthe Chagos Group, and the Pitt and Speaker Banks at its two extreme\r\npoints. These banks resemble atolls, except in their external rim being\r\nabout eight fathoms submerged, and in being formed of dead rock, with\r\nvery little living coral on it: a portion nine miles long of the\r\nannular reef of Peros Banhos atoll is in the same condition. These\r\nfacts, as will hereafter be shown, render it very probable that the\r\nwhole group at some former period subsided seven or eight fathoms; and\r\nthat the coral perished on the outer margin of those atolls which are\r\nnow submerged, but that it continued alive, and grew up to the surface\r\non those which are now perfect. If these atolls did subside, and if\r\nfrom the suddenness of the movement or from any other cause, those\r\ncorals which are better adapted to live at a certain depth than at the\r\nsurface, once got possession of the knolls, supplanting the former\r\noccupants, they would exert little or no tendency to grow upwards. To\r\nillustrate this, I may observe, that if the corals of the upper zone on\r\nthe outer edge of Keeling atoll were to perish, it is improbable that\r\nthose of the lower zone would grow to the surface, and thus become\r\nexposed to conditions for which they do not appear to be adapted. The\r\nconjecture, that the corals on the submerged knolls within the Chagos\r\natolls have analogous habits with those of the lower zone outside\r\nKeeling atoll, receives some support from a remark by Captain Moresby,\r\nnamely, that they have a different appearance from those on the reefs\r\nin the Maldiva atolls, which, as we have seen, all rise to the surface:\r\nhe compares the kind of difference to that of the vegetation under\r\ndifferent climates. I have entered at considerable length into this\r\ncase, although unable to throw much light on it, in order to show that\r\nan equal tendency to upward growth ought not to be attributed to all\r\ncoral-reefs,—to those situated at different depths,—to those forming\r\nthe ring of an atoll or those on the knolls within a lagoon,—to those\r\nin one area and those in another. The inference, therefore, that one\r\nreef could not grow up to the surface within a given time, because\r\nanother, not known to be covered with the same species of corals, and\r\nnot known to be placed under conditions exactly the same, has not\r\nwithin the same time reached the surface, is unsound.\r\n\r\n_Section II_—ON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF CORAL-REEFS\r\n\r\nThe remark made at the close of the last section, naturally leads to\r\nthis division of our subject, which has not, I think, hitherto been\r\nconsidered under a right point of view. Ehrenberg[16] has stated, that\r\nin\r\nthe Red Sea, the corals only coat other rocks in a layer from one to\r\ntwo feet in thickness, or at most to a fathom and a half; and he\r\ndisbelieves that, in any case, they form, by their own proper growth,\r\ngreat masses, stratum over stratum. A nearly similar observation has\r\nbeen made by MM. Quoy and Gaimard,[17] with respect to the thickness of\r\nsome upraised beds of coral, which they examined at Timor and some\r\nother places. Ehrenberg[18] saw certain large massive corals in the Red\r\nSea, which he imagines to be of such vast antiquity, that they might\r\nhave been beheld by Pharaoh; and according to Mr. Lyell[19] there are\r\ncertain corals at Bermuda, which are known by tradition, to have been\r\nliving for centuries. To show how slowly coral-reefs grow upwards,\r\nCaptain Beechey[20] has adduced the case of the Dolphin Reef off\r\nTahiti, which has remained at the same depth beneath the surface,\r\nnamely about two fathoms and a half, for a period of sixty-seven years.\r\nThere are reefs in the Red Sea, which certainly do not appear[21] to\r\nhave increased in dimensions during the last half-century, and from the\r\ncomparison of old charts with recent surveys, probably not during the\r\nlast two hundred years. These, and other similar facts, have so\r\nstrongly impressed many with the belief of the extreme slowness of the\r\ngrowth of corals, that they have even doubted the possibility of\r\nislands in the great oceans having been formed by their agency. Others,\r\nagain, who have not been overwhelmed by this difficulty, have admitted\r\nthat it would require thousands, and tens of thousands of years, to\r\nform a mass, even of inconsiderable thickness; but the subject has not,\r\nI believe, been viewed in the proper light.\r\n\r\n [16] Ehrenberg, as before cited, pp. 39, 46, and 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] “Annales des Sciences Nat.” tom. vi, p. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] Ehrenberg, _ut sup._, p. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” book iii, ch. xviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific,” ch. viii.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Ehrenberg, _ut sup._, p. 43.\r\n\r\nThat masses of considerable thickness have been formed by the growth of\r\ncoral, may be inferred with certainty from the following facts. In the\r\ndeep lagoons of Peros Banhos and of the Great Chagos Bank, there are,\r\nas already described, small steep-sided knolls covered with living\r\ncoral. There are similar knolls in the southern Maldiva atolls, some of\r\nwhich, as Captain Moresby assures me, are less than a hundred yards in\r\ndiameter, and rise to the surface from a depth of between two hundred\r\nand fifty and three hundred feet. Considering their number, form, and\r\nposition, it would be preposterous to suppose that they are based on\r\npinnacles of any rock, not of coral formation; or that sediment could\r\nhave been heaped up into such small and steep isolated cones. As no\r\nkind of living coral grows above the height of a few feet, we are\r\ncompelled to suppose that these knolls have been formed by the\r\nsuccessive growth and death of many individuals,—first one being broken\r\noff or killed by some accident, and then another, and one set of\r\nspecies being replaced by another set with different habits, as the\r\nreef rose nearer the surface, or as other changes supervened. The\r\nspaces between the corals would become filled up with fragments and\r\nsand, and such matter would probably soon be consolidated, for we learn\r\nfrom\r\nLieutenant Nelson,[22] that at Bermuda a process of this kind takes\r\nplace beneath water, without the aid of evaporation. In reefs, also, of\r\nthe barrier class, we may feel sure, as I have shown, that masses of\r\ngreat thickness have been formed by the growth of the coral; in the\r\ncase of Vanikoro, judging only from the depth of the moat between the\r\nland and the reef, the wall of coral-rock must be at least three\r\nhundred feet in vertical thickness.\r\n\r\n [22] “Geological Transactions,” vol. v, p. 113.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the upraised coral-islands in the Pacific have\r\nnot been examined by a geologist. The cliffs of Elizabeth Island, in\r\nthe Low Archipelago, are eighty feet high, and appear, from Captain\r\nBeechey’s description, to consist of a homogeneous coral-rock. From the\r\nisolated position of this island, we may safely infer that it is an\r\nupraised atoll, and therefore that it has been formed by masses of\r\ncoral, grown together. Savage Island seems, from the description of the\r\nyounger Forster,[23] to have a similar structure, and its shores are\r\nabout forty feet high: some of the Cook Islands also appear[24] to be\r\nsimilarly composed. Captain Belcher, R.N., in a letter which Captain\r\nBeaufort showed me at the admiralty, speaking of Bow atoll, says, “I\r\nhave succeeded in boring forty-five feet through coral-sand, when the\r\nauger became jammed by the falling in of the surrounding _ creamy_\r\nmatter.” On one of the Maldiva atolls, Captain Moresby bored to a depth\r\nof twenty-six feet, when his auger also broke: he has had the kindness\r\nto give me the matter brought up; it is perfectly white, and like\r\nfinely triturated coral-rock.\r\n\r\n [23] Forster’s “Voyage round the World with Cook,” vol. ii, pp. 163,\r\n 167.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] Williams’s “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,” p. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my description of Keeling atoll, I have given some facts, which show\r\nthat the reef probably has grown outwards; and I have found, just\r\nwithin the outer margin, the great mounds of Porites and of Millepora,\r\nwith their summits lately killed, and their sides subsequently\r\nthickened by the growth of the coral: a layer, also, of Nullipora had\r\nalready coated the dead surface. As the external slope of the reef is\r\nthe same round the whole of this atoll, and round many other atolls,\r\nthe angle of inclination must result from an adaption between the\r\ngrowing powers of the coral, and the force of the breakers, and their\r\naction on the loose sediment. The reef, therefore, could not increase\r\noutwards, without a nearly equal addition to every part of the slope,\r\nso that the original inclination might be preserved, and this would\r\nrequire a large amount of sediment, all derived from the wear of corals\r\nand shells, to be added to the lower part. Moreover, at Keeling atoll,\r\nand probably in many other cases, the different kinds of corals would\r\nhave to encroach on each other; thus the Nulliporæ cannot increase\r\noutwards without encroaching on the Porites and _ Millepora\r\ncomplanata,_ as is now taking place; nor these latter without\r\nencroaching on the strongly branched Madreporet, the _ Millepora\r\nalcicornis,_ and some Astræas; nor these again without a foundation\r\nbeing formed for them within the requisite depth, by the accumulation\r\nof sediment. How slow, then, must be the ordinary lateral or outward\r\ngrowth of such reefs. But off\r\nChristmas atoll, where the sea is much more shallow than is usual, we\r\nhave good reason to believe that, within a period not very remote, the\r\nreef has increased considerably in width. The land has the\r\nextraordinary breadth of three miles; it consists of parallel ridges of\r\nshells and broken corals, which furnish “an incontestable proof,” as\r\nobserved by Cook,[25] “that the island has been produced by accessions\r\nfrom the sea, and is in a state of increase.” The land is fronted by a\r\ncoral-reef, and from the manner in which islets are known to be formed,\r\nwe may feel confident that the reef was not three miles wide, when the\r\nfirst, or most backward ridge, was thrown up; and, therefore, we must\r\nconclude that the reef has grown outwards during the accumulation of\r\nthe successive ridges. Here then, a wall of coral-rock of very\r\nconsiderable breadth has been formed by the outward growth of the\r\nliving margin, within a period during which ridges of shells and\r\ncorals, lying on the bare surface, have not decayed. There can be\r\nlittle doubt, from the account given by Captain Beechey, that Matilda\r\natoll, in the Low Archipelago, has been converted in the space of\r\nthirty-four years, from being, as described by the crew of a wrecked\r\nwhaling vessel, a “reef of rocks” into a lagoon-island, fourteen miles\r\nin length, with “one of its sides covered nearly the whole way with\r\nhigh trees.”[26] The islets, also, on Keeling atoll, it has been shown,\r\nhave increased in length, and since the construction of an old chart,\r\nseveral of them have become united into one long islet; but in this\r\ncase, and in that of Matilda atoll, we have no proof, and can only\r\ninfer as probable, that the reef, that is the foundation of the islets,\r\nhas increased as well as the islets themselves.\r\n\r\n [25] Cook’s “Third Voyage,” book III, ch. x.\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific,” ch. vii and viii.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these considerations, I attach little importance, as indicating\r\nthe ordinary and still less the possible rate of _ outward_ growth of\r\ncoral-reefs, to the fact that certain reefs in the Red Sea have not\r\nincreased during a long interval of time; or to other such cases, as\r\nthat of Ouluthy atoll in the Caroline group, where every islet,\r\ndescribed a thousand years before by Cantova was found in the same\r\nstate by Lutké,[27]—without it could be shown that, in these cases, the\r\nconditions were favourable to the vigorous and unopposed growth of the\r\ncorals living in the different zones of depth, and that a proper basis\r\nfor the extent of the reef was present. The former conditions must\r\ndepend on many contingencies, and in the deep oceans where coral\r\nformations most abound, a basis within the requisite depth can rarely\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\n [27] F. Lutké’s “Voyage autour du Monde.” In the group Elato, however,\r\n it appears that what is now the islet Falipi, is called in Cantova’s\r\n Chart, the Banc de Falipi. It is not stated whether this has been\r\n caused by the growth of coral, or by the accumulation of sand.\r\n\r\nNor do I attach any importance to the fact of certain submerged reefs,\r\nas those off Tahiti, or those within Diego Garcia not now being nearer\r\nthe surface than they were many years ago, as an indication of the rate\r\nunder favourable circumstances of the _upward_ growth of reefs; after\r\nit has been shown, that all the reefs have grown to the surface in some\r\nof the Chagos atolls, but that in neighbouring atolls which appear to\r\nbe of equal antiquity and to be exposed to the same external\r\nconditions, every reef remains submerged; for we are almost driven to\r\nattribute this to a difference, not in the rate of growth, but in the\r\nhabits of the corals in the two cases.\r\n\r\nIn an old-standing reef, the corals, which are so different in kind on\r\ndifferent parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they\r\noccupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle\r\none with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that\r\ntheir growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly\r\nfavourable circumstances. Almost the only natural condition, allowing a\r\nquick upward growth of the whole surface of a reef, would be a slow\r\nsubsidence of the area in which it stood; if, for instance, Keeling\r\natoll were to subside two or three feet, can we doubt that the\r\nprojecting margin of live coral, about half an inch in thickness, which\r\nsurrounds the dead upper surfaces of the mounds of Porites, would in\r\nthis case form a concentric layer over them, and the reef thus increase\r\nupwards, instead of, as at present, outwards? The Nulliporæ are now\r\nencroaching on the Porites and Millepora, but in this case might we not\r\nconfidently expect that the latter would, in their turn, encroach on\r\nthe Nulliporæ? After a subsidence of this kind, the sea would gain on\r\nthe islets, and the great fields of dead but upright corals in the\r\nlagoon, would be covered by a sheet of clear water; and might we not\r\nthen expect that these reefs would rise to the surface, as they\r\nanciently did when the lagoon was less confined by islets, and as they\r\ndid within a period of ten years in the schooner-channel, cut by the\r\ninhabitants? In one of the Maldiva atolls, a reef, which within a very\r\nfew years existed as an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees, was found by\r\nLieutenant Prentice “_entirely covered with live coral and Madrepore._”\r\nThe natives believe that the islet was washed away by a change in the\r\ncurrents, but if, instead of this, it had quietly subsided, surely\r\nevery part of the island which offered a solid foundation, would in a\r\nlike manner have become coated with living coral.\r\n\r\nThrough steps such as these, any thickness of rock, composed of a\r\nsingular intermixture of various kinds of corals, shells, and\r\ncalcareous sediment, might be formed; but without subsidence, the\r\nthickness would necessarily be determined by the depth at which the\r\nreef-building polypifers can exist. If it be asked, at what rate in\r\nyears I suppose a reef of coral favourably circumstanced could grow up\r\nfrom a given depth; I should answer, that we have no precise evidence\r\non this point, and comparatively little concern with it. We see, in\r\ninnumerable points over wide areas, that the rate has been sufficient,\r\neither to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface, or, as\r\nis more probable, to keep them at the surface, during progressive\r\nsubsidences; and this is a much more important standard of comparison\r\nthan any cycle of years.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be inferred from the following facts, that the rate\r\nin years under favourable circumstances would be very far from slow.\r\nDr. Allan, of Forres, has, in his MS. Thesis deposited in the library\r\nof the Edinburgh University (extracts from which I owe to the kindness\r\nof Dr. Malcolmson), the following account of some experiments, which he\r\ntried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the east coast of\r\nMadagascar. “To ascertain the rise and progress of the coral-family,\r\nand fix the number of species met with at Foul Point (latitude 17° 40′)\r\ntwenty species of coral were taken off the reef and planted apart on a\r\nsand-bank _three feet deep at low water._ Each portion weighed ten\r\npounds, and was kept in its place by stakes. Similar quantities were\r\nplaced in a clump and secured as the rest. This was done in December\r\n1830. In July following, each detached mass was nearly level with the\r\nsea at low water, quite immovable, and several feet long, stretching as\r\nthe parent reef, with the coast current from north to south. The masses\r\naccumulated in a clump were found equally increased, but some of the\r\nspecies in such unequal ratios, as to be growing over each other.” The\r\nloss of Dr. Allan’s magnificent collection by shipwreck, unfortunately\r\nprevents its being known to what genera these corals belonged; but from\r\nthe numbers experimented on, it is certain that all the more\r\nconspicuous kinds must have been included. Dr. Allan informs me, in a\r\nletter, that he believes it was a Madrepora, which grew most\r\nvigorously. One may be permitted to suspect that the level of the sea\r\nmight possibly have been somewhat different at the two stated periods;\r\nnevertheless, it is quite evident that the growth of the ten-pound\r\nmasses, during the six or seven months, at the end of which they were\r\nfound immovably fixed[28] and several feet in length, must have been\r\nvery great. The fact of the different kinds of coral, when placed in\r\none clump, having increased in extremely unequal ratios, is very\r\ninteresting, as it shows the manner in which a reef, supporting many\r\nspecies of coral, would probably be affected by a change in the\r\nexternal conditions favouring one kind more than another. The growth of\r\nthe masses of coral in N. and S. lines parallel to the prevailing\r\ncurrents, whether due to the drifting of sediment or to the simple\r\nmovement of the water, is, also, a very interesting circumstance.\r\n\r\n [28] It is stated by De la Beche (“Geological Manual,” p. 143), on the\r\n authority of Mr. Lloyd, who surveyed the Isthmus of Panama, that some\r\n specimens of Polypifers, placed by him in a sheltered pool of water,\r\n were found in the course of a few days firmly fixed by the secretion\r\n of a stony matter, to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fact, communicated to me by Lieutenant Wellstead, I.N., in some\r\ndegree corroborates the result of Dr. Allan’s experiments: it is, that\r\nin the Persian Gulf a ship had her copper bottom encrusted in the\r\ncourse of twenty months with a layer of coral, _two feet_ in thickness,\r\nwhich it required great force to remove, when the vessel was docked: it\r\nwas not ascertained to what order this coral belonged. The case of the\r\nschooner-channel choked up with coral in an interval of less than ten\r\nyears, in the lagoon of Keeling atoll, should be here borne\r\nin mind. We may also infer, from the trouble which the inhabitants of\r\nthe Maldiva atolls take to root out, as they express it, the\r\ncoral-knolls from their harbours, that their growth can hardly be very\r\nslow.[29]\r\n\r\n [29] Mr. Stutchbury (_West of England Journal_, No. I, p. 50.) has\r\n described a specimen of Agaricia, “weighing 2 lbs. 9 oz., which\r\n surrounds a species of oyster, whose age could not be more than two\r\n years, and yet is completely enveloped by this dense coral.” I presume\r\n that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured; otherwise\r\n the fact tells nothing. Mr. Stutchbury also mentions an anchor, which\r\n had become entirely encrusted with coral in fifty years; other cases,\r\n however, are recorded of anchors which have long remained amidst\r\n coral-reefs without having become coated. The anchor of the _Beagle_,\r\n in 1832, after having been down exactly one month at Rio de Janeiro,\r\n was so thickly coated by two species of Tubularia, that large spaces\r\n of the iron were entirely concealed; the tufts of this horny zoophyte\r\n were between two and three inches in length. It has been attempted to\r\n compute, but I believe erroneously, the rate of growth of a reef, from\r\n the fact mentioned by Captain Beechey, of the _ Chama gigas_ being\r\n embedded in coral-rock. But it should be remembered, that some species\r\n of this genus invariably live, both whilst young and old, in cavities,\r\n which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth. I saw\r\n many of these shells thus embedded in the outer “flat” of Keeling\r\n atoll, which is composed of dead rock; and therefore the cavities in\r\n this case had no relation whatever with the growth of coral. M.\r\n Lesson, also, speaking of this shell (Partie Zoolog. “Voyage de la\r\n _Coquille_”), has remarked, “que constamment ses valves étaient\r\n engagés complétement dans la masse des Madrepores.”\r\n\r\nFrom the facts given in this section, it may be concluded, first, that\r\nconsiderable thicknesses of rock have certainly been formed within the\r\npresent geological area by the growth of coral and the accumulation of\r\nits detritus; and, secondly, that the increase of individual corals and\r\nof reefs, both outwards or horizontally and upwards or vertically,\r\nunder the peculiar conditions favourable to such increase, is not slow,\r\nwhen referred either to the standard of the average oscillations of\r\nlevel in the earth’s crust, or to the more precise but less important\r\none of a cycle of years.\r\n\r\n_Section III_—ON THE DEPTHS AT WHICH REEF-BUILDING POLYPIFERS CAN LIVE\r\n\r\nI have already described in detail, which might have appeared trivial,\r\nthe nature of the bottom of the sea immediately surrounding Keeling\r\natoll; and I will now describe with almost equal care the soundings off\r\nthe fringing-reefs of Mauritius. I have preferred this arrangement, for\r\nthe sake of grouping together facts of a similar nature. I sounded with\r\nthe wide bell-shaped lead which Captain Fitzroy used at Keeling Island,\r\nbut my examination of the bottom was confined to a few miles of coast\r\n(between Port Louis and Tomb Bay) on the leeward side of the island.\r\nThe edge of the reef is formed of great shapeless masses\r\nof branching Madrepores, which chiefly consist of two\r\nspecies,—apparently _M. corymbosa_ and _ pocillifera_,—mingled with a\r\nfew other kinds of coral. These masses are separated from each other by\r\nthe most irregular gullies and cavities, into which the lead sinks many\r\nfeet. Outside this irregular border of Madrepores, the water deepens\r\ngradually to twenty fathoms, which depth generally is found at the\r\ndistance of from half to three-quarters of a mile from the reef. A\r\nlittle further out the depth is thirty fathoms, and thence the bank\r\nslopes rapidly into the depths of the ocean. This inclination is very\r\ngentle compared with that outside Keeling and other atolls, but\r\ncompared with most coasts it is steep. The water was so clear outside\r\nthe reef, that I could distinguish every object forming the rugged\r\nbottom. In this part, and to a depth of eight fathoms, I sounded\r\nrepeatedly, and at each cast pounded the bottom with the broad lead,\r\nnevertheless the arming invariably came up perfectly clean, but deeply\r\nindented. From eight to fifteen fathoms a little calcareous sand was\r\noccasionally brought up, but more frequently the arming was simply\r\nindented. In all this space the two Madrepores above mentioned, and two\r\nspecies of Astræa, with rather large[30] stars, seemed the commonest\r\nkinds; and it must be noticed that twice at the depth of fifteen\r\nfathoms, the arming was marked with a clean impression of an Astræa.\r\nBesides these lithophytes, some fragments of the _Millepora\r\nalcicornis,_ which occurs in the same relative position at Keeling\r\nIsland, were brought up; and in the deeper parts there were large beds\r\nof a Seriatopora, different from _S. subulata_, but closely allied to\r\nit. On the beach within the reef, the rolled fragments consisted\r\nchiefly of the corals just mentioned, and of a massive Porites, like\r\nthat at Keeling atoll, of a Meandrina, _ Pocillopora verrucosa_, and of\r\nnumerous fragments of Nullipora. From fifteen to twenty fathoms the\r\nbottom was, with few exceptions, either formed of sand, or thickly\r\ncovered with Seriatopora: this delicate coral seems to form at these\r\ndepths extensive beds unmingled with any other kind. At twenty fathoms,\r\none sounding brought up a fragment of Madrepora apparently _M.\r\npocillifera_, and I believe it is the same species (for I neglected to\r\nbring specimens from both stations) which mainly forms the upper margin\r\nof the reef; if so, it grows in depths varying from\r\n0 to 20 fathoms. Between 20 and 23 fathoms I obtained several\r\nsoundings, and they all showed a sandy bottom, with one exception at 30\r\nfathoms, when the arming came up scooped out, as if by the margin of a\r\nlarge Caryophyllia. Beyond 33 fathoms I sounded only once; and from 86\r\nfathoms, at the distance of one mile and a third from the edge of the\r\nreef, the arming brought up calcareous sand with a pebble of volcanic\r\nrock. The circumstance of the arming having invariably come up quite\r\nclean, when sounding within a certain number of fathoms off the reefs\r\nof Mauritius and Keeling atoll (eight fathoms in the former case, and\r\ntwelve in the latter) and of its having always come up (with one\r\nexception) smoothed and covered with sand, when the depth exceeded\r\ntwenty fathoms, probably indicates a criterion, by which the limits of\r\nthe vigorous growth of coral might in all cases be readily ascertained.\r\nI do not, however, suppose that if a vast number of soundings were\r\nobtained round these islands, the limit above assigned would be found\r\nnever to vary, but I conceive the facts are sufficient to show, that\r\nthe exceptions would be few. The circumstance of a _gradual_ change, in\r\nthe two cases, from a field of clean coral to a smooth sandy bottom, is\r\nfar more important in indicating the depth at which the larger kinds of\r\ncoral flourish than almost any number of separate observations on the\r\ndepth, at which certain species have been dredged up. For we can\r\nunderstand the gradation, only as a prolonged struggle against\r\nunfavourable conditions. If a person were to find the soil clothed with\r\nturf on the banks of a stream of water, but on going to some distance\r\non one side of it, he observed the blades of grass growing thinner and\r\nthinner, with intervening patches of sand, until he entered a desert of\r\nsand, he would safely conclude, especially if changes of the same kind\r\nwere noticed in other places, that the presence of the water was\r\nabsolutely necessary to the formation of a thick bed of turf: so may we\r\nconclude, with the same feeling of certainty, that thick beds of coral\r\nare formed only at small depths beneath the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n [30] Since the preceding pages were printed off, I have received from\r\n Mr. Lyell a very interesting pamphlet, entitled “Remarks upon Coral\r\n Formations,” etc., by J. Couthouy, Boston, United States, 1842. There\r\n is a statement (p. 6), on the authority of the Rev. J. Williams,\r\n corroborating the remarks made by Ehrenberg and Lyell (p. 71 of this\r\n volume), on the antiquity of certain individual corals in the Red Sea\r\n and at Bermuda; namely, that at Upolu, one of the Navigator Islands,\r\n “particular clumps of coral are known to the fishermen by name,\r\n derived from either some particular configuration or tradition\r\n attached to them, and handed down from time immemorial.” With respect\r\n to the thickness of masses of coral-rock, it clearly appears, from the\r\n descriptions given by Mr. Couthouy (pp. 34, 58) that Mangaia and\r\n Aurora Islands are upraised atolls, composed of coral rock: the level\r\n summit of the former is about three hundred feet, and that of Aurora\r\n Island is two hundred feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to collect every fact, which might either invalidate\r\nor corroborate this conclusion. Captain Moresby, whose opportunities\r\nfor observation during his survey of the Maldiva and Chagos\r\nArchipelagoes have been unrivalled, informs me, that the upper part or\r\nzone of the steep-sided reefs, on the inner and outer coasts of the\r\natolls in both groups, invariably consists of coral, and the lower\r\nparts of sand. At seven or eight fathoms depth, the bottom is formed,\r\nas could be seen through the clear water, of great living masses of\r\ncoral, which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from\r\neach other, with patches of white sand between them, and at a little\r\ngreater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope,\r\nwithout any coral. Captain Moresby, also, informs me in support of his\r\nstatement, that he found only decayed coral on the Padua Bank (northern\r\npart of the Laccadive group) which has an average depth between\r\ntwenty-five and thirty-five fathoms, but that on some other banks in\r\nthe same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them (for\r\ninstance, the Tillacapeni bank), the coral was living.\r\nWith regard to the coral-reefs in the Red Sea, Ehrenberg has the\r\nfollowing passage:—“The living corals do not descend there into great\r\ndepths. On the edges of islets and near reefs, where the depth was\r\nsmall, very many lived; but we found no more even at six fathoms. The\r\npearl-fishers at Yemen and Massaua asserted that there was no coral\r\nnear the pearl-banks at nine fathoms depth, but only sand. We were not\r\nable to institute any more special researches.”[31] I am, however,\r\nassured both by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Wellstead, that in the\r\nmore northern parts of the Red Sea, there are extensive beds of living\r\ncoral at a depth of twenty-five fathoms, in which the anchors of their\r\nvessels were frequently entangled. Captain Moresby attributes the less\r\ndepth, at which the corals are able to live in the places mentioned by\r\nEhrenberg, to the greater quantity of sediment there; and the\r\nsituations, where they were flourishing at the depth of twenty-five\r\nfathoms, were protected, and the water was extraordinarily limpid. On\r\nthe leeward side of Mauritius where I found the coral growing at a\r\nsomewhat greater depth than at Keeling atoll, the sea, owing apparently\r\nto its tranquil state, was likewise very clear. Within the lagoons of\r\nsome of the Marshall atolls, where the water can be but little\r\nagitated, there are, according to Kotzebue, living beds of coral in\r\ntwenty-five fathoms. From these facts, and considering the manner in\r\nwhich the beds of clean coral off Mauritius, Keeling Island, the\r\nMaldiva and Chagos atolls, graduated into a sandy slope, it appears\r\nvery probable that the depth, at which reef-building polypifers can\r\nexist, is partly determined by the extent of inclined surface, which\r\nthe currents of the sea and the recoiling waves have the power to keep\r\nfree from sediment.\r\n\r\n [31] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natur,” etc., p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nMM. Quoy and Gaimard[32] believe that the growth of coral is confined\r\nwithin very limited depths; and they state that they never found any\r\nfragment of an Astræa (the genus they consider most efficient in\r\nforming reefs) at a depth above twenty-five or thirty feet. But we have\r\nseen that in several places the bottom of the sea is paved with massive\r\ncorals at more than twice this depth; and at fifteen fathoms (or twice\r\nthis depth) off the reefs of Mauritius, the arming was marked with the\r\ndistinct impression of a living Astræa. _Millepora alcicornis_ lives in\r\nfrom 0 to 12 fathoms, and the genera Madrepora and Seriatopora from 0\r\nto 20 fathoms. Captain Moresby has given me a specimen of _Sideropora\r\nscabra_ (Porites of Lamarck) brought up alive from 17 fathoms. Mr.\r\nCouthouy[33] states that he has dredged up on the Bahama banks\r\nconsiderable masses of Meandrina from 16 fathoms, and he has seen this\r\ncoral growing in 20 fathoms. A Caryophyllia, half an inch in diameter,\r\nwas dredged up alive from 80 fathoms off Juan Fernandez (latitude 33°\r\nS.) by Captain P. P. King:[34] this is the most remarkable fact with\r\nwhich I am acquainted, showing the depth at which a genus of\r\ncorals often found on reefs, can exist.[35] We ought, however, to feel\r\nless\r\nsurprise at this fact, as Caryophyllia alone of the lamelliform genera,\r\nranges far beyond the tropics; it is found in Zetland[36] in Lat. 60°\r\nN. in deep water, and I procured a small species from Tierra del Fuego\r\nin Lat. 53° S. Captain Beechey informs me, that branches of pink and\r\nyellow coral were frequently brought up from between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five fathoms off the Low atolls; and Lieutenant Stokes, writing\r\nto me from the N.W. coast of Australia, says that a strongly branched\r\ncoral was procured there from thirty fathoms; unfortunately it is not\r\nknown to what genera these corals belong.\r\n\r\n [32] “Annales des Sci. Nat.” tom. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n [33] “Remarks on Coral Formations,” p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n [34] I am indebted to Mr. Stokes for having kindly communicated this\r\n fact to me, together with much other valuable information.\r\n\r\n\r\n [35] I will record in the form of a note all the facts that I have\r\n been able to collect on the depths, both within and without the\r\n tropics, at which those corals and corallines can live, which there is\r\n no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a\r\n reef.\r\n    Ellis (“Nat. Hist. of Coralline,” p. 96) states that Ombellularia\r\n    was procured in latitude 79° N. _ sticking_ to a _line_ from the\r\n    depth of 236 fathoms; hence this coral either must have been\r\n    floating loose, or was entangled in stray line at the bottom. Off\r\n    Keeling atoll a compound Ascidia (Sigillina) was brought up from 39\r\n    fathoms, and a piece of sponge, apparently living, from 70, and a\r\n    fragment of Nullipora also apparently living from 92 fathoms. At a\r\n    greater depth than 90 fathoms off this coral island, the bottom was\r\n    thickly strewed with joints of Halimeda and small fragments of\r\n    other Nulliporæ, but all dead. Captain B. Allen, R.N., informs me\r\n    that in the survey of the West Indies it was noticed that between\r\n    the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms, the sounding lead very generally\r\n    came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda, of which he\r\n    showed me specimens. Off Pernambuco, in Brazil, in about twelve\r\n    fathoms, the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a\r\n    dull red Nullipora, and I infer from Roussin’s chart, that a bottom\r\n    of this kind extends over a wide area.

Beechey informed me of this fact in a letter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the limit of depth, at which each particular kind of coral\r\nceases to exist, is far from being accurately known; yet when we bear\r\nin mind the manner in which the clumps of coral gradually became\r\ninfrequent at about the same depth, and wholly disappeared at a greater\r\ndepth than twenty fathoms, on the slope round Keeling atoll, on the\r\nleeward side of the Mauritius, and at rather less depth, both without\r\nand within the atolls of the Maldiva and Chagos Archipelagoes; and when\r\nwe know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other\r\ncoral formations in their form and structure, we may, I think, conclude\r\nthat in ordinary cases, reef- building polypifers do not flourish at\r\ngreater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued[37] that reefs may possibly rise from very great\r\ndepths through the means of small corals, first making a platform for\r\nthe growth of the stronger kinds. This, however, is an arbitrary\r\nsupposition: it is not always remembered, that in such cases there is\r\nan antagonist power in action, namely, the decay of organic bodies,\r\nwhen not protected by a covering of sediment, or by their own rapid\r\ngrowth. We have, moreover, no right to calculate on unlimited time for\r\nthe accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses. Every fact\r\nin geology proclaims that neither the land, nor the bed of the sea\r\nretain for indefinite periods the same level. As well might it be\r\nimagined that the British Seas would in time become choked up with beds\r\nof oysters, or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable\r\nshores of Tierra del Fuego would in time form a solid and extensive\r\ncoral-reef.\r\n\r\n [37] _Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,_ 1831, p. 218.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V THEORY OF THE FORMATION OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF\r\nCORAL-REEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atolls of the larger archipelagoes are not formed on submerged\r\ncraters, or on banks of sediment.—Immense areas interspersed with\r\natolls.—Their subsidence.—The effects of storms and earthquakes on\r\natolls.—Recent changes in their state.—The origin of barrier-reefs and\r\nof atolls.—Their relative forms.—The step-formed ledges and walls round\r\nthe shores of some lagoons.—The ring-formed reefs of the Maldiva\r\natolls.—The submerged condition of parts or of the whole of some\r\nannular reefs.—The disseverment of large atolls.—The union of atolls by\r\nlinear reefs.—The Great Chagos Bank.—Objections from the area and\r\namount of subsidence required by the theory, considered.—The probable\r\ncomposition of the lower parts of atolls.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists who have visited the Pacific, seem to have had their\r\nattention riveted by the lagoon-islands, or atolls,—those singular\r\nrings of coral-land which rise abruptly out of the unfathomable\r\nocean—and have passed over, almost unnoticed, the scarcely less\r\nwonderful encircling barrier-reefs. The theory most generally received\r\non the formation of atolls, is that they are based on submarine\r\ncraters; but where can we find a crater of the shape of Bow atoll,\r\nwhich is five times as long as it is broad (Plate I, Fig. 4); or like\r\nthat of Menchikoff Island (Plate II, Fig. 3), with its three loops,\r\ntogether sixty miles in length; or like Rimsky Korsacoff, narrow,\r\ncrooked, and fifty-four miles long; or like the northern Maldiva\r\natolls, made up of numerous ring-formed reefs, placed on the margin of\r\na disc,—one of which discs is eighty-eight miles in length, and only\r\nfrom ten to twenty in breadth? It is, also, not a little improbable,\r\nthat there should have existed as many craters of immense size crowded\r\ntogether beneath the sea, as there are now in some parts atolls. But\r\nthis theory lies under a greater difficulty, as will be evident, when\r\nwe consider on what foundations the atolls of the larger archipelagoes\r\nrest: nevertheless, if the rim of a crater afforded a basis at the\r\nproper depth, I am far from denying that a reef like a perfectly\r\ncharacterised atoll might not be formed; some such, perhaps, now exist;\r\nbut I cannot believe in the possibility of the greater number having\r\nthus originated.\r\n\r\nAn earlier and better theory was proposed by Chamisso;[1] he supposes\r\nthat as the more massive kinds of corals prefer the surf, the outer\r\nportions, in a reef rising from a submarine basis, would first reach\r\nthe surface and consequently form a ring. But on this view it must be\r\nassumed, that in every case the basis consists of a flat bank; for if\r\nit were conically formed, like a mountainous mass, we can see no reason\r\nwhy the coral should spring up from the flanks, instead of from the\r\ncentral and highest parts: considering the number of the atolls in the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, this assumption is very improbable. As the\r\nlagoons of atolls are sometimes even more than forty fathoms deep, it\r\nmust, also, be assumed on this view, that at a depth at which the waves\r\ndo not break, the coral grows more vigorously on the edges of a bank\r\nthan on its central part; and this is an assumption without any\r\nevidence in support of it. I remarked, in the third chapter, that a\r\nreef, growing on a detached bank, would tend to assume an atoll-like\r\nstructure; if, therefore, corals were to grow up from a bank, with a\r\nlevel surface some fathoms submerged, having steep sides and being\r\nsituated in a deep sea, a reef not to be distinguished from an atoll,\r\nmight be formed: I believe some such exist in the West Indies. But a\r\ndifficulty of the same kind with that affecting the crater theory,\r\nrunners, as we shall presently see, this view inapplicable to the\r\ngreater number of atolls.\r\n\r\n [1] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 331.\r\n\r\nNo theory worthy of notice has been advanced to account for those\r\nbarrier-reefs, which encircle islands of moderate dimensions. The great\r\nreef which fronts the coast of Australia has been supposed, but without\r\nany special facts, to rest on the edge of a submarine precipice,\r\nextending parallel to the shore. The origin of the third class or of\r\nfringing-reefs presents, I believe, scarcely any difficulty, and is\r\nsimply consequent on the polypifers not growing up from great depths,\r\nand their not flourishing close to gently shelving beaches where the\r\nwater is often turbid.\r\n\r\nWhat cause, then, has given to atolls and barrier-reefs their\r\ncharacteristic forms? Let us see whether an important deduction will\r\nnot follow from the consideration of these two circumstances, first,\r\nthe reef-building corals flourishing only at limited depths; and\r\nsecondly, the vastness of the areas interspersed with coral-reefs and\r\ncoral-islets, none of which rise to a greater height above the level of\r\nthe sea, than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds.\r\nI do not make this latter statement vaguely; I have carefully sought\r\nfor descriptions of every island in the intertropical seas; and my task\r\nhas been in some degree abridged by a map of the Pacific, corrected in\r\n1834 by MM. D’Urville and Lottin, in which the low islands are\r\ndistinguished from the high ones (even from those much less than a\r\nhundred feet in height) by being written without a capital letter; I\r\nhave detected a few errors in this map, respecting the height of some\r\nof the islands, which will be noticed in the Appendix, where I treat of\r\ncoral formations in geographical order. To the Appendix, also, I must\r\nrefer for a more particular account of the data on which the statements\r\non the next page are grounded. I have ascertained, and chiefly from the\r\nwritings of Cook, Kotzebue, Bellinghausen, Duperrey, Beechey, and\r\nLutké, regarding the Pacific; and from Moresby[2] with respect to the\r\nIndian Ocean, that in the following cases the term “low island”\r\nstrictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up\r\nby the winds and the\r\nwaves of an open sea. If we draw a line (the plan I have always\r\nadopted) joining the external atolls of that part of the Low\r\nArchipelago in which the islands are numerous, the figure will be a\r\npointed ellipse (reaching from Hood to Lazaref Island), of which the\r\nlonger axis is 840 geographical miles, and the shorter 420 miles; in\r\nthis space[3] none of the innumerable islets united into great rings\r\nrise above the stated level. The Gilbert group is very narrow, and 300\r\nmiles in length. In a prolonged line from this group, at the distance\r\nof 240 miles, is the Marshall Archipelago, the figure of which is an\r\nirregular square, one end being broader than the other; its length is\r\n520 miles, with an average width of 240; these two groups together are\r\n1,040 miles in length, and all their islets are low. Between the\r\nsouthern end of the Gilbert and the northern end of Low Archipelago,\r\nthe ocean is thinly strewed with islands, all of which, as far as I\r\nhave been able to ascertain, are low; so that from nearly the southern\r\nend of the Low Archipelago, to the northern end of the Marshall\r\nArchipelago, there is a narrow band of ocean, more than 4,000 miles in\r\nlength, containing a great number of islands, all of which are low. In\r\nthe western part of the Caroline Archipelago, there is a space of 480\r\nmiles in length, and about 100 broad, thinly interspersed with low\r\nislands. Lastly, in the Indian Ocean, the archipelago of the Maldivas\r\nis 470 miles in length, and 60 in breadth; that of the Laccadives is\r\n150 by 100 miles; as there is a low island between these two groups,\r\nthey may be considered as one group of 1,000 miles in length. To this\r\nmay be added the Chagos group of low islands, situated 280 miles\r\ndistant, in a line prolonged from the southern extremity of the\r\nMaldivas. This group, including the submerged banks, is 170 miles in\r\nlength and 80 in breadth. So striking is the uniformity in direction of\r\nthese three archipelagoes, all the islands of which are low, that\r\nCaptain Moresby, in one of his papers, speaks of them as parts of one\r\ngreat chain, nearly 1,500 miles long. I am, then, fully justified in\r\nrepeating, that enormous spaces, both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans,\r\nare interspersed with islands, of which not one rises above that\r\nheight, to which the waves and winds in an open sea can heap up matter.\r\nOn what foundations, then, have these reefs and islets of coral been\r\nconstructed? A foundation must originally have been present beneath\r\neach atoll at that limited depth, which is indispensable for the first\r\ngrowth of the reef-building polypifers. A conjecture will perhaps be\r\nhazarded, that the requisite bases might have been afforded by the\r\naccumulation of great banks of sediment, which owing to the action of\r\nsuperficial currents (aided possibly by the undulatory movement of the\r\nsea) did not quite reach the surface,—as actually appears to have been\r\nthe case in some parts of the West Indian Sea. But in the form and\r\ndisposition of the groups of atolls, there is nothing to countenance\r\nthis notion; and the assumption without any proof, that a number of\r\nimmense piles of sediment have been heaped on the floor of the great\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, in their central parts far remote from land,\r\nand where the dark blue colour of the limpid water bespeaks its purity,\r\ncannot for one moment be admitted.\r\n\r\n [2] See also Captain Owen’s and Lieutenant Wood’s papers in the\r\n _Geographical Journal_, on the Maldiva and Laccadive Archipelagoes.\r\n These officers particularly refer to the lowness of the islets; but I\r\n chiefly ground my assertion respecting these two groups, and the\r\n Chagos group, from information communicated to me by Captain Moresby.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I find from Mr. Couthouy’s pamphlet (p. 58) that Aurora Island is\r\n about two hundred feet in height; it consists of coral-rock, and seems\r\n to have been formed by the elevation of an atoll. It lies north-east\r\n of Tahiti, close without the line bounding the space coloured dark\r\n blue in the map appended to this volume. Honden Island, which is\r\n situated in the extreme north-west part of the Low Archipelago,\r\n according to measurements made on board the _Beagle_, whilst sailing\r\n by, is 114 feet from the _summit of the trees_ to the water’s edge.\r\n This island appeared to resemble the other atolls of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe many widely-scattered atolls must, therefore, rest on rocky bases.\r\nBut we cannot believe that the broad summit of a mountain lies buried\r\nat the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll, and nevertheless\r\nthroughout the immense areas above-named, with not one point of rock\r\nprojecting above the level of the sea; for we may judge with some\r\naccuracy of mountains beneath the sea, by those on the land; and where\r\ncan we find a single chain several hundred miles in length and of\r\nconsiderable breadth, much less several such chains, with their many\r\nbroad summits attaining the same height, within from 120 to 180 feet?\r\nIf the data be thought insufficient, on which I have grounded my\r\nbelief, respecting the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can\r\nexist, and it be assumed that they can flourish at a depth of even one\r\nhundred fathoms, yet the weight of the above argument is but little\r\ndiminished, for it is almost equally improbable, that as many submarine\r\nmountains, as there are low islands in the several great and widely\r\nseparated areas above specified, should all rise within six hundred\r\nfeet of the surface of the sea and not one above it, as that they\r\nshould be of the same height within the smaller limit of one or two\r\nhundred feet. So highly improbable is this supposition, that we are\r\ncompelled to believe, that the bases of the many atolls did never at\r\nany one period all lie submerged within the depth of a few fathoms\r\nbeneath the surface, but that they were brought into the requisite\r\nposition or level, some at one period and some at another, through\r\nmovements in the earth’s crust. But this could not have been effected\r\nby elevation, for the belief that points so numerous and so widely\r\nseparated were successively uplifted to a certain level, but that not\r\none point was raised above that level, is quite as improbable as the\r\nformer supposition, and indeed differs little from it. It will probably\r\noccur to those who have read Ehrenberg’s account of the Reefs of the\r\nRed Sea, that many points in these great areas may have been elevated,\r\nbut that as soon as raised, the protuberant parts were cut off by the\r\ndestroying action of the waves: a moment’s reflection, however, on the\r\nbasin-like form of the atolls, will show that this is impossible; for\r\nthe upheaval and subsequent abrasion of an island would leave a flat\r\ndisc, which might become coated with coral, but not a deeply concave\r\nsurface; moreover, we should expect to see, in some parts at least, the\r\nrock of the foundation brought to the surface. If, then, the\r\nfoundations of the many atolls were not uplifted into the requisite\r\nposition, they must of necessity have subsided into it; and this at\r\nonce solves every difficulty,[4]\r\nfor we may safely infer, from the facts given in the last chapter, that\r\nduring a gradual subsidence the corals would be favourably\r\ncircumstanced for building up their solid frame works and reaching the\r\nsurface, as island after island slowly disappeared. Thus areas of\r\nimmense extent in the central and most profound parts of the great\r\noceans, might become interspersed with coral-islets, none of which\r\nwould rise to a greater height than that attained by detritus heaped up\r\nby the sea, and nevertheless they might all have been formed by corals,\r\nwhich absolutely required for their growth a solid foundation within a\r\nfew fathoms of the surface.\r\n\r\n [4] The additional difficulty on the crater hypothesis before alluded\r\n to, will now be evident; for on this view the volcanic action must be\r\n supposed to have formed within the areas specified a vast number of\r\n craters, all rising within a few fathoms of the surface, and not one\r\n above it. The supposition that the craters were at different times\r\n upraised above the surface, and were there abraded by the surf and\r\n subsequently coated by corals, is subject to nearly the same\r\n objections with those given above in this paragraph; but I consider it\r\n superfluous to detail all the arguments opposed to such a notion.\r\n Chamisso’s theory, from assuming the existence of so many banks, all\r\n lying at the proper depth beneath the water, is also vitally\r\n defective. The same observation applies to an hypothesis of Lieutenant\r\n Nelson’s (“Geolog. Trans.” vol. v, p. 122), who supposes that the\r\n ring-formed structure is caused by a greater number of germs of corals\r\n becoming attached to the declivity, than to the central plateau of a\r\n submarine bank: it likewise applies to the notion formerly entertained\r\n (Forster’s “Observ.,” p. 151), that lagoon-islands owe their peculiar\r\n form to the instinctive tendencies of the polypifers. According to\r\n this latter view, the corals on the outer margin of the reef\r\n instinctively expose themselves to the surf in order to afford\r\n protection to corals living in the lagoon, which belong to other\r\n genera, and to other families!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to do more than allude to the many facts,\r\nshowing that the supposition of a gradual subsidence over large areas\r\nis by no means improbable. We have the clearest proof that a movement\r\nof this kind is possible, in the upright trees buried under the strata\r\nmany thousand feet in thickness; we have also every reason for\r\nbelieving that there are now large areas gradually sinking, in the same\r\nmanner as others are rising. And when we consider how many parts of the\r\nsurface of the globe have been elevated within recent geological\r\nperiods, we must admit that there have been subsidences on a\r\ncorresponding scale, for otherwise the whole globe would have swollen.\r\nIt is very remarkable that Mr. Lyell,[5] even in the first edition of\r\nhis “Principles of Geology,” inferred that the amount of subsidence in\r\nthe Pacific must have exceeded that of elevation, from the area of land\r\nbeing very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it,\r\nnamely, the growth of coral and volcanic action. But it will be asked,\r\nare there any direct proofs of a subsiding movement in those areas, in\r\nwhich subsidence will explain a phenomenon otherwise inexplicable?\r\nThis, however, can hardly be expected, for it must ever be most\r\ndifficult, excepting in countries long civilised, to detect a movement,\r\nthe tendency of which is to conceal the part affected. In barbarous and\r\nsemi-civilised\r\nnations how long might not a slow movement, even of elevation such as\r\nthat now affecting Scandinavia, have escaped attention!\r\n\r\n [5] “Principles of Geology,” sixth edition, vol. iii, p. 386.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Williams[6] insists strongly that the traditions of the natives,\r\nwhich he has taken much pains in collecting, do not indicate the\r\nappearance of any new islands: but on the theory of a gradual\r\nsubsidence, all that would be apparent would be, the water sometimes\r\nencroaching slowly on the land, and the land again recovering by the\r\naccumulation of detritus its former extent, and perhaps sometimes the\r\nconversion of an atoll with coral islets on it, into a bare or into a\r\nsunken annular reef. Such changes would naturally take place at the\r\nperiods when the sea rose above its usual limits, during a gale of more\r\nthan ordinary strength; and the effects of the two causes would be\r\nhardly distinguishable. In Kotzebue’s “Voyage” there are accounts of\r\nislands, both in the Caroline and Marshall Archipelagoes, which have\r\nbeen partly washed away during hurricanes; and Kadu, the native who was\r\non board one of the Russian vessels, said “he saw the sea at Radack\r\nrise to the feet of the cocoa-nut trees; but it was conjured in\r\ntime.”[7] A storm lately entirely swept away two of the Caroline\r\nislands, and converted them into shoals; it partly, also, destroyed two\r\nother islands.[8] According to a tradition which was communicated to\r\nCaptain Fitzroy, it is believed in the Low Archipelago, that the\r\narrival of the first ship caused a great inundation, which destroyed\r\nmany lives. Mr. Stutchbury relates, that in 1825, the western side of\r\nChain Atoll, in the same group, was completely devastated by a\r\nhurricane, and not less than 300 lives lost: “in this instance it was\r\nevident, even to the natives, that the hurricane alone was not\r\nsufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean.”[9] That\r\nconsiderable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in\r\nthe Low Archipelago, appears certain from the case already given of\r\nMatilda Island: with respect to Whitsunday and Gloucester Islands in\r\nthis same group, we must either attribute great inaccuracy to their\r\ndiscoverer, the famous circumnavigator Wallis, or believe that they\r\nhave undergone a considerable change in the period of fifty-nine years,\r\nbetween his voyage and that of Captain Beechey’s. Whitsunday Island is\r\ndescribed by Wallis as “about four miles long, and three wide,” now it\r\nis only one mile and a half long. The appearance of Gloucester Island,\r\nin Captain Beechey’s words,[10] “has been accurately described by its\r\ndiscoverer, but its present form and extent differ materially.”\r\nBlenheim reef, in the Chagos group, consists of a water-washed annular\r\nreef, thirteen miles in circumference, surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms\r\ndeep: on its surface there were a few worn patches of conglomerate\r\ncoral-rock, of about the size of hovels; and these Captain Moresby\r\nconsidered as being, without doubt, the last remnants of islets; so\r\nthat here an atoll has been converted into an atoll-formed reef. The\r\ninhabitants of the Maldiva Archipelago, as long ago as 1605, declared,\r\n“that the high tides and violent currents were diminishing the number\r\nof the islands:”[11] and I have already shown, on the authority of\r\nCaptain Moresby, that the work of destruction is still in progress; but\r\nthat on the other hand the first formation of some islets is known to\r\nthe present inhabitants. In such cases, it would be exceedingly\r\ndifficult to detect a gradual subsidence of the foundation, on which\r\nthese mutable structures rest.\r\n\r\n [6] Williams’s “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,” p. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] M.

One of the islands in this group was formerly covered by a\r\nbed of mould, which, after an earthquake, disappeared, and was believed\r\nby the residents to have been washed by the rain through the broken\r\nmasses of underlying rock; the island was thus rendered unproductive.\r\nChamisso[12] states, that earthquakes are felt in the Marshall atolls,\r\nwhich are far from any high land, and likewise in the islands of the\r\nCaroline Archipelago. On one of the latter, namely Oulleay atoll,\r\nAdmiral Lutké, as he had the kindness to inform me, observed several\r\nstraight fissures about a foot in width, running for some hundred yards\r\nobliquely across the whole width of the reef. Fissures indicate a\r\nstretching of the earth’s crust, and, therefore, probably changes in\r\nits level; but these coral-islands, which have been shaken and\r\nfissured, certainly have not been elevated, and, therefore, probably\r\nthey have subsided. In the chapter on Keeling atoll, I attempted to\r\nshow by direct evidence, that the island underwent a movement of\r\nsubsidence, during the earthquakes lately felt there.\r\n\r\n [12] See Chamisso, in Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 182 and\r\n 136.\r\n\r\nThe facts stand thus;—there are many large tracts of ocean, without any\r\nhigh land, interspersed with reefs and islets, formed by the growth of\r\nthose kinds of corals, which cannot live at great depths; and the\r\nexistence of these reefs and low islets, in such numbers and at such\r\ndistant points, is quite inexplicable, excepting on the theory, that\r\nthe bases on which the reefs first became attached, slowly and\r\nsuccessively sank beneath the level of the sea, whilst the corals\r\ncontinued to grow upwards. No positive facts are opposed to this view,\r\nand some general considerations render it probable. There is evidence\r\nof change in form, whether or not from subsidence, on some of these\r\ncoral-islands; and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances\r\nbeneath them. Will then the theory, to which we have thus been led,\r\nsolve the curious problem,—what has given to each class of reef its\r\npeculiar form?\r\n\r\nLet us in imagination place within one of the subsiding areas, an\r\nisland surrounded by a “fringing-reef,”—that kind, which alone offers\r\nno difficulty in the explanation of its origin. Let the unbroken lines,\r\nand the oblique shading in the woodcut (No. 4) represent a vertical\r\nsection through such an island; and the horizontal shading will\r\nrepresent the section of the reef. Now, as the island sinks down,\r\neither a few feet at a time or quite insensibly, we may safely infer\r\nfrom what we know of the conditions favourable to the growth of coral,\r\nthat the living masses bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef,\r\nwill soon regain the surface. The water, however, will encroach, little\r\nby little, on the shore, the island becoming lower and smaller, and the\r\nspace between the edge of the reef and the beach proportionately\r\nbroader. A section of the reef and island in this state, after a\r\nsubsidence of several hundred feet, is given by the dotted lines:\r\ncoral-islets are supposed to have been formed on the new reef, and a\r\nship is anchored in the lagoon-channel. This section is in every\r\nrespect that of an encircling barrier-reef; it is, in fact, a section\r\ntaken[13] east and west through the highest point of the encircled\r\nisland of Bolabola; of which a plan is given in Plate I, Fig. 5. The\r\nsame section is more clearly shown in the following woodcut (No. 5) by\r\nthe unbroken lines. The width of the reef, and its slope, both on the\r\nouter and inner side, will have been determined by the growing powers\r\nof the coral, under the conditions (for instance the force of the\r\nbreakers and of the currents) to which it has been exposed; and the\r\nlagoon-channel will be deeper or shallower, in proportion to the growth\r\nof the delicately branched corals within the reef, and to the\r\naccumulation of sediment, relatively, also, to the rate of subsidence\r\nand the length of the intervening stationary periods.\r\n\r\n [13] The section has been made from the chart given in the “Atlas of\r\n the Voyage of the _Coquille_.” The scale is .57 of an inch to a mile.\r\n The height of the island, according to M. Lesson, is 4,026 feet. The\r\n deepest part of the lagoon-channel is 162 feet; its depth is\r\n exaggerated in the woodcut for the sake of clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vertical section of an island of Bolabola.]\r\n\r\nAA—Outer edge of the reef at the level of the sea.\r\nBB—Shores of the island.\r\nA′A′—Outer edge of the reef, after its upward growth during a period of\r\nsubsidence.\r\nCC—The lagoon-channel between the reef and the shores of the now\r\nencircled land.\r\nB′B′—The shores of the encircled island.\r\n\r\nN.B.—In this, and the following woodcut, the subsidence of the land\r\ncould only be represented by an apparent rise in the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is evident in this section, that a line drawn perpendicularly down\r\nfrom the outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock,\r\nexceeds by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence, that\r\nsmall limit of depth at which the effective polypifers can live—the\r\ncorals having grown up, as the whole sank down, from a basis formed of\r\nother corals and their consolidated fragments. Thus the difficulty on\r\nthis head, which before seemed so great, disappears.\r\n\r\nAs the space between the reef and the subsiding shore continued to\r\nincrease in breadth and depth, and as the injurious effects of the\r\nsediment and fresh water borne down from the land were consequently\r\nlessened, the greater number of the channels, with which the reef in\r\nits fringing state must have been breached, especially those which\r\nfronted the smaller streams, will have become choked up with the growth\r\nof coral: on the windward side of the reef, where the coral grows most\r\nvigorously, the breaches will probably have first been closed. In\r\nbarrier-reefs, therefore, the breaches kept open by draining the tidal\r\nwaters of the lagoon-channel, will generally be placed on the leeward\r\nside, and they will still face the mouths of the larger streams,\r\nalthough removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh\r\nwater;—and this, it has been shown, is commonly the case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vertical section of an island of Bolabola.]\r\n\r\nA′A′—Outer edges of the barrier-reef at the level of the sea. The\r\ncocoa-nut trees represent coral-islets formed on the reef.\r\nCC—The lagoon-channel.\r\nB′B′—The shores of the island, generally formed of low alluvial land\r\nand of coral detritus from the lagoon-channel.\r\nA″A″—The outer edges of the reef now forming an atoll.\r\nC′—The lagoon of the newly formed atoll. According to the scale, the\r\ndepth of the lagoon and of the lagoon-channel is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to the diagram shown above, in which the newly formed\r\nbarrier-reef is represented by unbroken lines, instead of by dots as in\r\nthe former woodcut, let the work of subsidence go on, and the doubly\r\npointed hill will form two small islands (or more, according to the\r\nnumber of the hills) included within one annular reef. Let the island\r\ncontinue subsiding, and the coral-reef will continue growing up on its\r\nown foundation, whilst the water gains inch by inch on the land, until\r\nthe last and highest pinnacle is covered, and there remains a perfect\r\natoll. A vertical section of this atoll is shown in the woodcut by the\r\ndotted lines;—a ship is anchored in its lagoon, but islets are not\r\nsupposed yet to have been formed on the reef. The depth of the lagoon\r\nand the\r\nwidth and slope of the reef, will depend on the circumstances just\r\nreferred to under barrier-reefs. Any further subsidence will produce no\r\nchange in the atoll, except perhaps a diminution in its size, from the\r\nreef not growing vertically upwards; but should the currents of the sea\r\nact violently upon it, and should the corals perish on part or on the\r\nwhole of its margin, changes would result during subsidence which will\r\nbe presently noticed. I may here observe, that a bank either of rock or\r\nof hardened sediment, level with the surface of the sea, and fringed\r\nwith living coral, would (if not so small as to allow the central space\r\nto be quickly filled up with detritus) by subsidence be converted\r\nimmediately into an atoll, without passing, as in the case of a reef\r\nfringing the shore of an island, through the intermediate form of a\r\nbarrier-reef. If such a bank lay a few fathoms submerged, the simple\r\ngrowth of the coral (as remarked in the third chapter) without the aid\r\nof subsidence, would produce a structure scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom a true atoll; for in all cases the corals on the outer margin of a\r\nreef, from having space and being freely exposed to the open sea, will\r\ngrow vigorously and tend to form a continuous ring whilst the growth of\r\nthe less massive kinds on the central expanse, will be checked by the\r\nsediment formed there, and by that washed inwards by the breakers; and\r\nas the space becomes shallower, their growth will, also, be checked by\r\nthe impurities of the water, and probably by the small amount of food\r\nbrought by the enfeebled currents, in proportion to the surface of\r\nliving reefs studded with innumerable craving mouths: the subsidence of\r\na reef based on a bank of this kind, would give depth to its central\r\nexpanse or lagoon, steepness to its flanks, and through the free growth\r\nof the coral, symmetry to its outline:—I may here repeat that the\r\nlarger groups of atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans cannot be\r\nsupposed to be founded on banks of this nature.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of the island in the diagram, the shore of a continent\r\nfringed by a reef had subsided, a great barrier-reef, like that on the\r\nnorth-east coast of Australia, would have necessarily resulted; and it\r\nwould have been separated from the main land by a deep-water channel,\r\nbroad in proportion to the amount of subsidence, and to the less or\r\ngreater inclination of the neighbouring coast-line. The effect of the\r\ncontinued subsidence of a great barrier-reef of this kind, and its\r\nprobable conversion into a chain of separate atolls, will be noticed,\r\nwhen we discuss the apparent progressive disseverment of the larger\r\nMaldiva atolls.\r\n\r\nWe now are able to perceive that the close similarity in form,\r\ndimensions, structure, and relative position (which latter point will\r\nhereafter be more fully noticed) between fringing and encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs, and between these latter and atolls, is the necessary\r\nresult of the transformation, during subsidence of the one class into\r\nthe other. On this view, the three classes of reefs ought to graduate\r\ninto each other. Reefs having intermediate character between those of\r\nthe fringing and barrier classes do exist; for instance, on the\r\nsouth-west coast of Madagascar, a reef extends for several miles,\r\nwithin which there is a broad channel from seven to eight fathoms deep,\r\nbut the sea does not deepen abruptly outside the reef. Such cases,\r\nhowever, are open to\r\nsome doubts, for an old fringing-reef, which had extended itself a\r\nlittle on a basis of its own formation, would hardly be distinguishable\r\nfrom a barrier-reef, produced by a small amount of subsidence, and with\r\nits lagoon-channel nearly filled up with sediment during a long\r\nstationary period. Between barrier-reefs, encircling either one lofty\r\nisland or several small low ones, and atolls including a mere expanse\r\nof water, a striking series can be shown: in proof of this, I need only\r\nrefer to the first plate in this volume, which speaks more plainly to\r\nthe eye, than any description could to the ear. The authorities from\r\nwhich the charts have been engraved, together with some remarks on them\r\nand descriptive of the plates, are given above. At New Caledonia (Plate\r\nII, Fig. 5.) the barrier-reefs extend for 150 miles on each side of the\r\nsubmarine prolongation of the island; and at their northern extremity\r\nthey appear broken up and converted into a vast atoll-formed reef,\r\nsupporting a few low coral-islets: we may imagine that we here see the\r\neffects of subsidence actually in progress, the water always\r\nencroaching on the northern end of the island, towards which the\r\nmountains slope down, and the reefs steadily building up their massive\r\nfabrics in the lines of their ancient growth.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet only considered the origin of barrier-reefs and atolls\r\nin their simplest form; but there remain some peculiarities in\r\nstructure and some special cases, described in the two first chapters,\r\nto be accounted for by our theory. These consist—in the inclined ledge\r\nterminated by a wall, and sometimes succeeded by a second ledge with a\r\nwall, round the shores of certain lagoons and lagoon-channels; a\r\nstructure which cannot, as I endeavoured to show, be explained by the\r\nsimple growing powers of the corals,—in the ring or basin-like forms of\r\nthe central reefs, as well as of the separate marginal portions of the\r\nnorthern Maldiva atolls,—in the submerged condition of the whole, or of\r\nparts of certain barrier and atoll-formed reefs; where only a part is\r\nsubmerged, this being generally to leeward,—in the apparent progressive\r\ndisseverment of some of the Maldiva atolls,—in the existence of\r\nirregularly formed atolls, some being tied together by linear reefs,\r\nand others with spurs projecting from them,—and, lastly, in the\r\nstructure and origin of the Great Chagos Bank.\r\n\r\n_Step-formed ledges round certain lagoons._—If we suppose an atoll to\r\nsubside at an extremely slow rate, it is difficult to follow out the\r\ncomplex results. The living corals would grow up on the outer margin;\r\nand likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the bare\r\nsurface of the annular reef; the water would encroach on the islets,\r\nbut the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their\r\nentire submergence. After a subsidence of this very slow nature, the\r\nsurface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon, would\r\nprobably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand,\r\nwhich line the shores of most lagoons. Should, however, the atoll be\r\ncarried down by a more rapid movement, the whole surface of the annular\r\nreef, where there was a foundation of solid matter, would be favourably\r\ncircumstanced for the fresh growth of coral; but as the corals grew\r\nupwards on its exterior margin, and the waves broke heavily on this\r\npart, the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be\r\nchecked from the want of water. Consequently, the exterior parts would\r\nfirst reach the surface, and the new annular reef thus formed on the\r\nold one, would have its summit inclined inwards, and be terminated by a\r\nsubaqueous wall, formed by the upward growth of the coral (before being\r\nmuch checked), from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef.\r\nThe inner portion of the new reef, from not having grown to the\r\nsurface, would be covered by the waters of the lagoon. Should a\r\nsubsidence of the same kind be repeated, the corals would again grow up\r\nin a wall, from all the solid parts of the resunken reef, and,\r\ntherefore, not from within the sandy shores of the lagoon; and the\r\ninner part of the new annular reef would, from being as before checked\r\nin its upward growth, be of less height than the exterior parts, and\r\ntherefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon. In this case the\r\nshores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges, one\r\nbeneath the other, and both abruptly terminated by subaqueous\r\ncliffs.[14]\r\n\r\n [14] According to Mr. Couthouy (p. 26) the external reef round many\r\n atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces. He attempts, I\r\n doubt whether successfully, to explain this structure somewhat in the\r\n same manner as I have attempted, with respect to the internal ledges\r\n round the lagoons of some atolls. More facts are wanted regarding the\r\n nature both of the interior and exterior step-like ledges: are all the\r\n ledges, or only the upper ones, covered with living coral? If they are\r\n all covered, are the kinds different on the ledges according to the\r\n depth? Do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same\r\n atolls; if so, what is their total width, and is the intervening\r\n surface-reef narrow, etc.?\r\n\r\n_The ring or basin-formed reefs of the northern Maldiva atolls._—I may\r\nfirst observe, that the reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within\r\nlagoon-channels, would, if favourably circumstanced, grow upwards\r\nduring subsidence in the same manner as the annular rim; and,\r\ntherefore, we might expect that such lagoon- reefs, when not surrounded\r\nand buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the rate of\r\nsubsidence, would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which\r\nthe efficient polypifers can flourish: we see this well exemplified in\r\nthe small abruptly-sided reefs, with which the deep lagoons of the\r\nChagos and Southern Maldiva atolls are studded. With respect to the\r\nring or basin-formed reefs of the Northern Maldiva atolls, it is\r\nevident, from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the\r\nmarginal rings, although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of\r\nordinary atolls, are only modified portions of such a reef; it is also\r\nevident that the central rings, although wider than the knolls or reefs\r\nwhich commonly occur in lagoons, occupy their place. The ring-like\r\nstructure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the\r\nlagoon being broad and numerous, so that all the reefs which are bathed\r\nby the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions\r\nwith the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea. Hence the\r\nexterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably\r\ncircumstanced for growing outwards, and increasing beyond the usual\r\nbreadth; and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for\r\ngrowing\r\nvigorously upwards, during the subsiding movements, to which by our\r\ntheory the whole archipelago has been subjected; and subsidence with\r\nthis upward growth of the margins would convert the central space of\r\neach little reef into a small lagoon. This, however, could only take\r\nplace with those reefs, which had increased to a breadth sufficient to\r\nprevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up\r\nwith the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides: hence it is\r\nthat few reefs, which are less than half a mile in diameter, even in\r\nthe atolls where the basin-like structure is most strikingly exhibited,\r\ninclude lagoons. This remark, I may add, applies to all coral-reefs\r\nwherever found. The basin-formed reefs of the Maldiva Archipelago may,\r\nin fact, be briefly described, as small atolls formed during subsidence\r\nover the separate portions of large and broken atolls, in the same\r\nmanner as these latter were formed over the barrier-reefs, which\r\nencircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged.\r\n\r\n_Submerged and dead reefs._—In the second section of the first chapter,\r\nI have shown that there are in the neighbourhood of atolls, some deeply\r\nsubmerged banks, with level surfaces; that there are others, less\r\ndeeply but yet wholly submerged, having all the characters of perfect\r\natolls, but consisting merely of dead coral-rock; that there are\r\nbarrier-reefs and atolls with merely a portion of their reef, generally\r\non the leeward side, submerged; and that such portions either retain\r\ntheir perfect outline, or they appear to be quite effaced, their former\r\nplace being marked only by a bank, conforming in outline with that part\r\nof the reef which remains perfect. These several cases are, I believe,\r\nintimately related together, and can be explained by the same means.\r\nThere, perhaps, exist some submerged reefs, covered with living coral\r\nand growing upwards, but to these I do not here refer. As we see that\r\nin those parts of the ocean, where coral-reefs are most abundant, one\r\nisland is fringed and another neighbouring one is not fringed; as we\r\nsee in the same archipelago, that all the reefs are more perfect in one\r\npart of it than in another, for instance, in the southern half compared\r\nwith the northern half of the Maldiva Archipelago, and likewise on the\r\nouter coasts compared with the inner coasts of the atolls in this same\r\ngroup, which are placed in a double row; as we know that the existence\r\nof the innumerable polypifers forming a reef, depends on their\r\nsustenance, and that they are preyed on by other organic beings; and,\r\nlastly, as we know that some inorganic causes are highly injurious to\r\nthe growth of coral, it cannot be expected that during the round of\r\nchange to which earth, air, and water are exposed, the reef-building\r\npolypifers should keep alive for perpetuity in any one place; and still\r\nless can this be expected, during the progressive subsidences, perhaps\r\nat some periods more rapid than at others, to which by our theory these\r\nreefs and islands have been subjected and are liable. It is, then, not\r\nimprobable that the corals should sometimes perish either on the whole\r\nor on part of a reef; if on part, the dead portion, after a small\r\namount of subsidence, would still retain its proper outline and\r\nposition beneath the water. After a more prolonged\r\nsubsidence, it would probably form, owing to the accumulation of\r\nsediment, only the margin of a flat bank, marking the limits of the\r\nformer lagoon. Such dead portions of reef would generally lie on the\r\nleeward side,[15] for the impure water and fine sediment would more\r\neasily flow out from the lagoon over this side of the reef, where the\r\nforce of the breakers is less than to windward; and therefore the\r\ncorals would be less vigorous on this side, and be less able to resist\r\nany destroying agent. It is likewise owing to this same cause, that\r\nreefs are more frequently breached to leeward by narrow channels,\r\nserving as by ship-channels, than to windward. If the corals perished\r\nentirely, or on the greater part of the circumference of an atoll, an\r\natoll-shaped bank of dead rock, more or less entirely submerged, would\r\nbe produced; and further subsidence, together with the accumulation of\r\nsediment, would often obliterate its atoll-like structure, and leave\r\nonly a bank with a level surface.\r\n\r\n [15] Mr. Lyell, in the first edition of his “Principles of Geology,”\r\n offered a somewhat different explanation of this structure. He\r\n supposes that there has been subsidence; but he was not aware that the\r\n submerged portions of reef were in most cases, if not in all, dead;\r\n and he attributes the difference in height in the two sides of most\r\n atolls, chiefly to the greater accumulation of detritus to windward\r\n than to leeward. But as matter is accumulated only on the backward\r\n part of the reef, the front part would remain of the same height on\r\n both sides. I may here observe that in most cases (for instance, at\r\n Peros Banhos, the Gambier group and the Great Chagos Bank), and I\r\n suspect in all cases, the dead and submerged portions do not blend or\r\n slope into the living and perfect parts, but are separated from them\r\n by an abrupt line. In some instances small patches of living reef rise\r\n to the surface from the middle of the submerged and dead parts.\r\n\r\nIn the Chagos group of atolls, within an area of 160 miles by 60, there\r\nare two atoll-formed banks of dead rock (besides another very imperfect\r\none), entirely submerged; a third, with merely two or three very small\r\npieces of living reef rising to the surface; and a fourth, namely,\r\nPeros Banhos (Plate I, Fig. 9), with a portion nine miles in length\r\ndead and submerged. As by our theory this area has subsided, and as\r\nthere is nothing improbable in the death, either from changes in the\r\nstate of the surrounding sea or from the subsidence being great or\r\nsudden, of the corals on the whole, or on portions of some of the\r\natolls, the case of the Chagos group presents no difficulty. So far\r\nindeed are any of the above-mentioned cases of submerged reefs from\r\nbeing inexplicable, that their occurrence might have been anticipated\r\non our theory, and as fresh atolls are supposed to be in progressive\r\nformation by the subsidence of encircling barrier-reefs, a weighty\r\nobjection, namely that the number of atolls must be increasing\r\ninfinitely, might even have been raised, if proofs of the occasional\r\ndestruction and loss of atolls could not have been adduced.\r\n\r\n_The disseverment of the larger Maldiva atolls._—The apparent\r\nprogressive disseverment in the Maldiva Archipelago of large atolls\r\ninto smaller ones, is, in many respects, an important consideration,\r\nand requires an explanation. The graduated series which marks, as I\r\nbelieve, this process, can be observed only in the northern half of the\r\ngroup, where the atolls have exceedingly imperfect margins, consisting\r\nof detached basin-formed reefs. The currents of the sea flow across\r\nthese atolls, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, with considerable\r\nforce, and drift the sediment from side to side during the monsoons,\r\ntransporting much of it seaward; yet the currents sweep with greater\r\nforce round their flanks. It is historically known that these atolls\r\nhave long existed in their present state; and we can believe, that even\r\nduring a very slow subsidence they might thus remain, the central\r\nexpanse being kept at nearly its original depth by the accumulation of\r\nsediment. But in the action of such nicely balanced forces during a\r\nprogressive subsidence (like that, to which by our theory this\r\narchipelago has been subjected), it would be strange if the currents of\r\nthe sea should never make a direct passage across some one of the\r\natolls, through the many wide breaches in their margins. If this were\r\nonce effected, a deep-water channel would soon be formed by the removal\r\nof the finer sediment, and the check to its further accumulation; and\r\nthe sides of the channel would be worn into a slope like that on the\r\nouter coasts, which are exposed to the same force of the currents. In\r\nfact, a channel precisely like that bifurcating one which divides\r\nMahlos Mahdoo (Plate II, Fig. 4), would almost necessarily be formed.\r\nThe scattered reefs situated near the borders of the new ocean-channel,\r\nfrom being favourably placed for the growth of coral, would, by their\r\nextension, tend to produce fresh margins to the dissevered portions;\r\nsuch a tendency is very evident (as may be seen in the large published\r\nchart) in the elongated reefs on the borders of the two channels\r\nintersecting Mahlos Mahdoo. Such channels would become deeper with\r\ncontinued subsidence, and probably from the reefs not growing up\r\nperpendicularly, somewhat broader. In this case, and more especially if\r\nthe channels had been formed originally of considerable breadth, the\r\ndissevered portions would become perfect and distinct atolls, like Ari\r\nand Ross atolls (Plate II, Fig. 6), or like the two Nillandoo atolls,\r\nwhich must be considered as distinct, although related in form and\r\nposition, and separated from each other by channels, which though deep\r\nhave been sounded. Further subsidence would render such channels\r\nunfathomable, and the dissevered portions would then resemble Phaleedoo\r\nand Moluque atolls, or Mahlos Mahdoo and Horsburgh atolls (Plate II,\r\nFig. 4), which are related to each other in no respect except in\r\nproximity and position. Hence, on the theory of subsidence, the\r\ndisseverment of large atolls, which have imperfect margins (for\r\notherwise their disseverment would be scarcely possible), and which are\r\nexposed to strong currents, is far from being an improbable event; and\r\nthe several stages, from close relation to entire isolation in the\r\natolls of the Maldiva Archipelago, are readily explicable.\r\n\r\nWe might go even further, and assert as not improbable, that the first\r\nformation of the Maldiva Archipelago was due to a barrier-reef, of\r\nnearly the same dimensions with that of New Caledonia (Plate II, Fig.\r\n5), for if, in imagination, we complete the subsidence of that great\r\nisland, we might anticipate from the present broken condition of the\r\nnorthern portion of the reef, and from the almost entire absence of\r\nreefs on the eastern coast, that the barrier-reef after repeated\r\nsubsidences, would become during its upward growth separated into\r\ndistinct portions; and these portions would tend to assume an\r\natoll-like structure, from the coral growing with vigour round their\r\nentire circumferences, when freely exposed to an open sea. As we have\r\nsome large islands partly submerged with barrier-reefs marking their\r\nformer limits, such as New Caledonia, so our theory makes it probable\r\nthat there should be other large islands wholly submerged; and these,\r\nwe may now infer, would be surmounted, not by one enormous atoll, but\r\nby several large elongated ones, like the atolls in the Maldiva group;\r\nand these again, during long periods of subsidence, would sometimes\r\nbecome dissevered into smaller atolls. I may add, that both in the\r\nMarshall and Caroline Archipelagoes, there are atolls standing close\r\ntogether, which have an evident relationship in form: we may suppose,\r\nin such cases, either that two or more encircled islands originally\r\nstood close together, and afforded bases for two or more atolls, or\r\nthat one atoll has been dissevered. From the position, as well as form,\r\nof three atolls in the Caroline Archipelago (the Namourrek and Elato\r\ngroup), which are placed in an irregular circle, I am strongly tempted\r\nto believe that they have originated by the process of\r\ndisseverment.[16]\r\n\r\n [16] The same remark is, perhaps, applicable to the islands of Ollap,\r\n Fanadik, and Tamatam in the Caroline Archipelago, of which charts are\r\n given in the atlas of Duperrey’s voyage: a line drawn through the\r\n linear reefs and lagoons of these three islands forms a semicircle.\r\n Consult also, the atlas of Lutké’s voyage; and for the Marshall group\r\n that of Kotzebue; for the Gilbert group consult the atlas of\r\n Duperrey’s voyage. Most of the points here referred to may, however,\r\n be seen in Krusenstern’s general Atlas of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Irregularly formed atolls._—In the Marshall group, Musquillo atoll\r\nconsists of two loops united in one point; and Menchikoff atoll is\r\nformed of three loops, two of which (as may be seen in Fig. 3, Plate\r\nII) are connected by a mere ribbon-shaped reef, and the three together\r\nare sixty miles in length. In the Gilbert group some of the atolls have\r\nnarrow strips of reef, like spurs, projecting from them. There occur\r\nalso in parts of the open sea, a few linear and straight reefs,\r\nstanding by themselves; and likewise some few reefs in the form of\r\ncrescents, with their extremities more or less curled inwards. Now, the\r\nupward growth of a barrier-reef which fronted only one side of an\r\nisland, or one side of an elongated island with its extremities (of\r\nwhich cases exist), would produce after the complete subsidence of the\r\nland, mere strips or crescent or hook-formed reefs: if the island thus\r\npartially fronted became divided during subsidence into two or more\r\nislands, these islands would be united together by linear reefs; and\r\nfrom the further growth of the coral along their shores together with\r\nsubsidence, reefs of various forms might ultimately be produced, either\r\natolls united together by linear reefs, or atolls with spurs projecting\r\nfrom them. Some, however, of the more simple forms above specified,\r\nmight, as we have seen, be equally well produced by the coral perishing\r\nduring\r\nsubsidence on part of the circumference of an atoll, whilst on the\r\nother parts it continued to grow up till it reached the surface.\r\n\r\n_The Great Chagos Bank._—I have already shown that the submerged\r\ncondition of the Great Chagos Bank (Plate II, Fig. 1, with its section\r\nFig. 2), and of some other banks in the Chagos group, may in all\r\nprobability be attributed to the coral having perished before or during\r\nthe movements of subsidence, to which this whole area by our theory has\r\nbeen subjected. The external rim or upper ledge (shaded in the chart),\r\nconsists of dead coral-rock thinly covered with sand; it lies at an\r\naverage depth of between five and eight fathoms, and perfectly\r\nresembles in form the annular reef of an atoll. The banks of the second\r\nlevel, the boundaries of which are marked by dotted lines in the chart,\r\nlie from about fifteen to twenty fathoms beneath the surface; they are\r\nseveral miles broad, and terminate in a very steep slope round the\r\ncentral expanse. This central expanse I have already described, as\r\nconsisting of a level muddy flat between thirty and forty fathoms deep.\r\nThe banks of the second level, might at first sight be thought\r\nanalogous to the internal step-like ledge of coral-rock which borders\r\nthe lagoons of some atolls, but their much greater width, and their\r\nbeing formed of sand, are points of essential difference. On the\r\neastern side of the atoll some of the banks are linear and parallel,\r\nresembling islets in a great river, and pointed directly towards a\r\ngreat breach on the opposite side of the atoll; these are best seen in\r\nthe large published chart. I inferred from this circumstance, that\r\nstrong currents sometimes set directly across this vast bank; and I\r\nhave since heard from Captain Moresby that this is the case. I\r\nobserved, also, that the channels or breaches through the rim, were all\r\nof the same depth as the central lagoon-like space into which they\r\nlead; whereas the channels into the other atolls of the Chagos group,\r\nand as I believe into most other large atolls, are not nearly as deep\r\nas their lagoons: for instance at Peros Banhos, the channels are only\r\nof the same depth, namely between ten and twenty fathoms, as the bottom\r\nof the lagoon for a space about a mile and a half in width round its\r\nshores, whilst the central expanse of the lagoon is from thirty-five to\r\nforty fathoms deep. Now, if an atoll during a gradual subsidence once\r\nbecame entirely submerged, like the Great Chagos Bank, and therefore no\r\nlonger exposed to the surf, very little sediment could be formed from\r\nit; and consequently the channels leading into the lagoon from not\r\nbeing filled up with drifted sand and coral detritus, would continue\r\nincreasing in depth, as the whole sank down. In this case, we might\r\nexpect that the currents of the open sea, instead of any longer\r\nsweeping round the submarine flanks, would flow directly through the\r\nbreaches across the lagoon, removing in their course the finer\r\nsediment, and preventing its further accumulation. We should then have\r\nthe submerged reef forming an external and upper rim of rock, and\r\nbeneath this portion of the sandy bottom of the old lagoon, intersected\r\nby deep-water channels or breaches, and thus formed into separate\r\nmarginal banks; and these would be cut off by steep slopes, overhanging\r\nthe central space, worn down by the passage of the oceanic currents.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy these means, I have scarcely any doubt that the Great Chagos Bank\r\nhas originated,—a structure which at first appeared to me far more\r\nanomalous than any I had met with. The process of formation is nearly\r\nthe same with that, by which Mahlos Mahdoo had been trisected; but in\r\nthe Chagos Bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at\r\nseveral different quarters, have united in a central space.\r\n\r\nThis great atoll-formed bank appears to be in an early stage of\r\ndisseverment; should the work of subsidence go on, from the submerged\r\nand dead condition of the whole reef, and the imperfection of the\r\nsouth-east quarter a mere wreck would probably be left. The Pitt’s\r\nBank, situated not far southward, appears to be precisely in this\r\nstate; it consists of a moderately level, oblong bank of sand, lying\r\nfrom 10 to 20 fathoms beneath the surface, with two sides protected by\r\na narrow ledge of rock which is submerged between 5 and 8 fathoms. A\r\nlittle further south, at about the same distance as the southern rim of\r\nthe Great Chagos Bank is from the northern rim, there are two other\r\nsmall banks with from 10 to 20 fathoms on them; and not far eastward\r\nsoundings were struck on a sandy bottom, with between 110 and 145\r\nfathoms. The northern portion with its ledge-like margin, closely\r\nresembles any one segment of the Great Chagos Bank, between two of the\r\ndeep-water channels, and the scattered banks, southward appear to be\r\nthe last wrecks of less perfect portions.\r\n\r\nI have examined with care the charts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans,\r\nand have now brought before the reader all the examples, which I have\r\nmet with, of reefs differing from the type of the class to which they\r\nbelong; and I think it has been satisfactorily shown, that they are all\r\nincluded in our theory, modified by occasional accidents which might\r\nhave been anticipated as probable. In this course we have seen, that in\r\nthe lapse of ages encircling barrier-reefs are occasionally converted\r\ninto atolls, the name of atoll being properly applicable, at the moment\r\nwhen the last pinnacle of encircled land sinks beneath the surface of\r\nthe sea. We have, also, seen that large atolls during the progressive\r\nsubsidence of the areas in which they stand, sometimes become\r\ndissevered into smaller ones; at other times, the reef-building\r\npolypifers having entirely perished, atolls are converted into\r\natoll-formed banks of dead rock; and these again through further\r\nsubsidence and the accumulation of sediment modified by the force of\r\nthe oceanic currents, pass into level banks with scarcely any\r\ndistinguishing character. Thus may the history of an atoll be followed\r\nfrom its first origin, through the occasional accidents of its\r\nexistence, to its destruction and final obliteration.\r\n\r\n_Objections to the theory of the formation of atolls and\r\nbarrier-reefs._—The vast amount of subsidence, both horizontally or in\r\narea, and vertically or in depth, necessary to have submerged every\r\nmountain, even the highest, throughout the immense spaces of ocean\r\ninterspersed with atolls, will probably strike most people as a\r\nformidable objection to my theory. But as continents, as large as the\r\nspaces supposed to have subsided, have been raised above the level of\r\nthe sea,—as whole regions are now rising, for instance, in Scandinavia\r\nand South America,—and as\r\nno reason can be assigned, why subsidences should not have occurred in\r\nsome parts of the earth’s crust on as great a scale both in extent and\r\namount as those of elevation, objections of this nature strike me as of\r\nlittle force. The remarkable point is that movements to such an extent\r\nshould have taken place within a period, during which the polypifers\r\nhave continued adding matter on and above the same reefs. Another and\r\nless obvious objection to the theory will perhaps be advanced from the\r\ncircumstance, of the lagoons within atolls and within barrier-reefs\r\nnever having become in any one instance during prolonged subsidences of\r\na greater depth than sixty fathoms, and seldom more than forty fathoms;\r\nbut we already admit, if the theory be worth considering, that the rate\r\nof subsidence has not exceeded that of the upward growth of the coral\r\non the exterior margin; we are, therefore, only further required to\r\nadmit, that the subsidence has not exceeded in rate the filling up of\r\nthe interior spaces by the growth of the corals living there, and by\r\nthe accumulation of sediment. As this filling up must take place very\r\nslowly within barrier-reefs lying far from the land, and within atolls\r\nwhich are of large dimensions and which have open lagoons with very few\r\nreefs, we are led to conclude that the subsidence thus\r\ncounter-balanced, must have been slow in an extraordinary degree; a\r\nconclusion which accords with our only means, namely, with what is\r\nknown of the rate and manner of recent elevatory movements, of judging\r\nby analogy what is the probable rate of subsidence.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it has, I think, been shown, that the theory of\r\nsubsidence, which we were compelled to receive from the necessity of\r\ngiving to the corals, in certain large areas, foundations at the\r\nrequisite depth, explains both the normal structure and the less\r\nregular forms of those two great classes of reefs, which have justly\r\nexcited the astonishment of all persons who have sailed through the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans. But further to test the truth of the theory,\r\na crowd of questions will occur to the reader: Do the different kinds\r\nof reefs, which have been produced by the same kind of movement,\r\ngenerally lie within the same areas? What is their relation of form and\r\nposition,—for instance, do adjoining groups of atolls, and the separate\r\natolls in these groups, bear the same relation to each other which\r\nislands do in common archipelagoes? Have we reason to believe, that\r\nwhere there are fringing-reefs, there has not lately been subsidence;\r\nor, for it is almost our only way of ascertaining this point, are there\r\nfrequently proofs of recent elevation? Can we by this means account for\r\nthe presence of certain classes of reefs in some large areas, and their\r\nentire absence in others? Do the areas which have subsided, as\r\nindicated by the presence of atolls and barrier-reefs, and the areas\r\nwhich have remained stationary or have been upraised, as shown by\r\nfringing-reefs, bear any determinate relation to each other; and are\r\nthe dimensions of these areas such as harmonise with the greatness of\r\nthe subterranean changes, which, it must be supposed, have lately taken\r\nplace beneath them? Is there any connection between the movements thus\r\nindicated, and recent volcanic action? All these questions ought to\r\nreceive answers in accordance with the theory; and if this can be\r\nsatisfactorily shown, not only is the theory\r\nconfirmed, but as deductions, the answers are in themselves important.\r\nUnder this latter point of view, these questions will be chiefly\r\nconsidered in the following chapter.[17]\r\n\r\n [17] I may take this opportunity of briefly considering the\r\n appearances, which would probably be presented by a vertical and deep\r\n section across a coral formation (referring chiefly to an atoll),\r\n formed by the upward growth of coral during successive subsidences.\r\n This is a subject worthy of attention, as a means of comparison with\r\n ancient coral-strata. The circumferential parts would consist of\r\n massive species, in a vertical position, with their interstices filled\r\n up with detritus; but this would be the part most subject to\r\n subsequent denudation and removal. It is useless to speculate how\r\n large a portion of the exterior annular reef would consist of upright\r\n coral, and how much of fragmentary rock, for this would depend on many\r\n contingencies,—such as on the rate of subsidence, occasionally\r\n allowing a fresh growth of coral to cover the whole surface, and on\r\n the breakers having force sufficient to throw fragments over this same\r\n space. The conglomerate which composes the base of the islets, would\r\n (if not removed by denudation together with the exterior reef on which\r\n it rests) be conspicuous from the size of the fragments,—the different\r\n degrees in which they have been rounded,—the presence of fragments of\r\n conglomerate torn up, rounded, and recemented,—and from the oblique\r\n stratification. The corals which lived in the lagoon-reefs at each\r\n successive level, would be preserved upright, and they would consist\r\n of many kinds, generally much branched. In this part, however, a very\r\n large proportion of the rock (and in some cases nearly all of it)\r\n would be formed of sedimentary matter, either in an excessively fine,\r\n or in a moderately coarse state, and with the particles almost blended\r\n together. The conglomerate which was formed of rounded pieces of the\r\n branched corals, on the shores of the lagoon, would differ from that\r\n formed on the islets and derived from the outer coast; yet both might\r\n have accumulated very near each other. I have seen a conglomerate\r\n limestone from Devonshire like a conglomerate now forming on the\r\n shores of the Maldiva atolls. The stratification taken as a whole,\r\n would be horizontal; but the conglomerate beds resting on the exterior\r\n reef, and the beds of sandstone on the shores of the lagoon (and no\r\n doubt on the external flanks) would probably be divided (as at Keeling\r\n atoll and at Mauritius) by numerous layers dipping at considerable\r\n angles in different directions. The calcareous sandstone and\r\n coral-rock would almost necessarily contain innumerable shells,\r\n echini, and the bones of fish, turtle, and perhaps of birds; possibly,\r\n also, the bones of small saurians, as these animals find their way to\r\n the islands far remote from any continent. The large shells of some\r\n species of Tridacna would be found vertically imbedded in the solid\r\n rock, in the position in which they lived. We might expect also to\r\n find a mixture of the remains of pelagic and littoral animals in the\r\n strata formed in the lagoon, for pumice and the seeds of plants are\r\n floated from distant countries into the lagoons of many atolls: on the\r\n outer coast of Keeling atoll, near the mouth of the lagoon, the case\r\n of a pelagic Pteropodous animal was brought up on the arming of the\r\n sounding lead. All the loose blocks of coral on Keeling atoll were\r\n burrowed by vermiform animals; and as every cavity, no doubt,\r\n ultimately becomes filled with spathose limestone, slabs of the rock\r\n taken from a considerable depth, would, if polished, probably exhibit\r\n the excavations of such burrowing animals. The conglomerate and\r\n fine-grained beds of coral-rock would be hard, sonorous, white and\r\n composed of nearly pure calcareous matter; in some few parts, judging\r\n from the specimens at Keeling atoll, they would probably contain a\r\n small quantity of iron. Floating pumice and scoriæ, and occasionally\r\n stones transported in the root of trees (see my “Journal of\r\n Researches,” page 549) appear the only sources, through which foreign\r\n matter is brought to coral-formations standing in the open ocean. The\r\n area over which sediment is transported from coral-reefs must be\r\n considerable: Captain Moresby informs me that during the change of\r\n monsoons the sea is discoloured to a considerable distance off the\r\n Maldiva and Chagos atolls. The sediment of fringing and barrier\r\n coral-reefs must be mingled with the mud, which is brought down from\r\n the land, and is transported seaward through the breaches, which occur\r\n in front of almost every valley. If the atolls of the larger\r\n archipelagoes were upraised, the bed of the ocean being converted into\r\n land, they would form flat-topped mountains, varying in diameter from\r\n a few miles (the smallest atolls being worn away) to sixty miles; and\r\n from being horizontally stratified and of similar composition, they\r\n would, as Mr. Lyell has remarked, falsely appear as if they had\r\n originally been united into one vast continuous mass. Such great\r\n strata of coral-rock would rarely be associated with erupted volcanic\r\n matter, for this could only take place, as may be inferred from what\r\n follows in the next chapter, when the area, in which they were\r\n situated, commenced to rise, or at least ceased to subside. During the\r\n enormous period necessary to effect an elevation of the kind just\r\n alluded to, the surface would necessarily be denuded to a great\r\n thickness; hence it is highly improbable that any fringing-reef, or\r\n even any barrier-reef, at least of those encircling small islands,\r\n would be preserved. From this same cause, the strata which were formed\r\n within the lagoons of atolls and lagoon-channels of barrier-reefs, and\r\n which must consist in a large part of sedimentary matter, would more\r\n often be preserved to future ages, than the exterior solid reef,\r\n composed of massive corals in an upright position; although it is on\r\n this exterior part that the present existence and further growth of\r\n atolls and barrier-reefs entirely depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ Plate III_—Map showing the distribution of coral-reefs and active\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing distribution of coral-reefs and active\r\nvolcanoes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing distribution of coral-reefs and active\r\nvolcanoes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing distribution of coral-reefs and active\r\nvolcanoes.]\r\n\r\nThe principles, on which this map was coloured, are explained in the\r\nbeginning of Chapter VI; and the authorities for each particular spot\r\nare detailed in the Appendix to _Coral Reefs._ The names not printed in\r\nupper case in the Index refer to the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS WITH REFERENCE TO THE\r\nTHEORY OF THEIR FORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the coloured map.—Proximity of atolls and\r\nbarrier-reefs.—Relation in form and position of atolls with ordinary\r\nislands.—Direct evidence of subsidence difficult to be detected.—Proofs\r\nof recent elevation where fringing-reefs occur.—Oscillations of\r\nlevel.—Absence of active volcanoes in the areas of\r\nsubsidence.—Immensity of the areas which have been elevated and have\r\nsubsided.—Their relation to the present distribution of the land.—Areas\r\nof subsidence elongated, their intersection and alternation with those\r\nof elevation.—Amount and slow rate of the subsidence.—Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to give here a short account of the appended map\r\n(Plate III):[1] a fuller one, with the data for colouring each spot, is\r\nreserved\r\nfor the Appendix; and every place there referred to may be found in the\r\nIndex. A larger chart would have been desirable; but, small as the\r\nadjoined one is, it is the result of many months’ labour. I have\r\nconsulted, as far as I was able, every original voyage and map; and the\r\ncolours were first laid down on charts on a larger scale. The same blue\r\ncolour, with merely a difference in the depth of tint, is used for\r\natolls or lagoon-islands, and barrier-reefs, for we have seen, that as\r\nfar as the actual coral-formation is concerned, they have no\r\ndistinguishing character. Fringing-reefs have been coloured red, for\r\nbetween them on the one hand, and barrier-reefs and atolls on the\r\nother, there is an important distinction with respect to the depth\r\nbeneath the surface, at which we are compelled to believe their\r\nfoundations lie. The two distinct colours, therefore, mark two great\r\ntypes of structure.\r\n\r\n [1] Inasmuch as the coloured map would have proved too costly to be\r\n given in this series, the indications of colour have been replaced by\r\n numbers referring to the dotted groups of reefs, etc. The author’s\r\n original wording, however, is retained in full, as it will be easy to\r\n refer to the map by the numbers, and thus the flow of the narrative is\r\n undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe _dark blue colour_ [represented by (3) in our plate] represents\r\natolls and submerged annular reefs, with deep water in their centres. I\r\nhave coloured as atolls, a few low and small coral-islands, without\r\nlagoons; but this has been done only when it clearly appeared that they\r\noriginally contained lagoons, since filled up with sediment: when there\r\nwere not good grounds for this belief, they have been left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe _pale blue colour_ [represented by (2)] represents barrier-reefs.\r\nThe most obvious character of reefs of this class is the broad and\r\ndeep-water moat within the reef: but this, like the lagoons of small\r\natolls, is liable to become filled up with detritus and with reefs of\r\ndelicately branched corals: when, therefore, a reef round the entire\r\ncircumference of an island extends very far into a profoundly deep sea,\r\nso that it can hardly be confounded with a fringing-reef which must\r\nrest on a foundation of rock within a small depth, it has been coloured\r\npale blue, although it does not include a deep-water moat: but this has\r\nonly been done rarely, and each case is distinctly mentioned in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nThe _red colour_ (4) represents reefs fringing the land quite closely\r\nwhere the sea is deep, and where the bottom is gently inclined\r\nextending to a moderate distance from it, but not having a deep-water\r\nmoat or lagoon-like space parallel to the shore. It must be remembered\r\nthat fringing-reefs are frequently _breached_ in front of rivers and\r\nvalleys by deepish channels, where mud has been deposited. A space of\r\nthirty miles in width has been coloured round or in front of the reefs\r\nof each class, in order that the colours might be conspicuous on the\r\nappended map, which is reduced to so small a scale.\r\n\r\nThe _vermillion spots_, and streaks (1) represent volcanoes now in\r\naction, or historically known to have been so. They are chiefly laid\r\ndown from Von Buch’s work on the Canary Islands; and my reasons for\r\nmaking a few alterations are given in the note below.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] I have also made considerable use of the geological part of\r\n Berghaus’ “Physical Atlas.” Beginning at the eastern side of the\r\n Pacific, I have added to the number of the volcanoes in the southern\r\n part of the Cordillera, and have coloured Juan Fernandez according to\r\n observations collected during the voyage of the _Beagle_ (“Geol.\r\n Trans.,” vol. v, p. 601). I have added a volcano to Albemarle Island,\r\n one of the Galapagos Archipelago (the author’s “Journal of\r\n Researches,” p. 457). In the Sandwich group there are no active\r\n volcanoes, except at Hawaii; but the Rev. W. Ellis informs me, there\r\n are streams of lava apparently modern on Maui, having a very recent\r\n appearance, which can be traced to the craters whence they flowed. The\r\n same gentleman informs me, that there is no reason to believe that any\r\n active volcano exists in the Society Archipelago; nor are there any\r\n known in the Samoa or Navigator group, although some of the streams of\r\n lava and craters there appear recent. In the Friendly group, the Rev.\r\n J. Williams says (“Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,” p. 29) that\r\n Toofoa and Proby Islands are active volcanoes. I infer from Hamilton’s\r\n “Voyage in the _Pandora_” (p. 95), that Proby Island is synonymous\r\n with Onouafou, but I have not ventured to colour it. There can be no\r\n doubt respecting Toofoa, and Captain Edwards (Von Buch, p. 386) found\r\n the lava of recent eruption at Amargura still smoking. Berghaus marks\r\n four active volcanoes actually within the Friendly group; but I do not\r\n know on what authority: I may mention that Maurelle describes Latte as\r\n having a burnt-up appearance: I have marked only Toofoa and Amargura.\r\n South of the New Hebrides lies Matthews Rock, which is drawn and\r\n described as an active crater in the “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_.”\r\n Between it and the volcano on the eastern side of New Zealand, lies\r\n Brimstone Island, which from the high temperature of the water in the\r\n crater, may be ranked as active (Berghaus “Vorbemerk,” II Lief. S.\r\n 56). Malte Brun, vol. xii, p. 231, says that there is a volcano near\r\n port St. Vincent in New Caledonia. I believe this to be an error,\r\n arising from a smoke seen on the _opposite_ coast by Cook (“Second\r\n Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 23) which smoke went out at night. The Mariana\r\n Islands, especially the northern ones, contain many craters (see\r\n Freycinet’s “Hydrog. Descript.”) which are not active. Von Buch,\r\n however, states (p. 462) on the authority of La Peyrouse, that there\r\n are no less than seven volcanoes between these islands and Japan.\r\n Gemelli Creri (Churchill’s “Collect.” vol. iv, p. 458), says there are\r\n two active volcanoes in latitude 23° 30′, and in latitude 24°: but I\r\n have not coloured them. From the statements in Beechey’s “Voyage” (p.\r\n 518, 4to edit.) I have coloured one in the northern part of the Bonin\r\n group. M. S. Julien has clearly made out from Chinese manuscripts not\r\n very ancient (“Comptes Rendus,” 1840, p. 832), that there are two\r\n active volcanoes on the eastern side of Formosa. In Torres Straits, on\r\n Cap Island (9° 48′ S., 142° 39′ E.) a volcano was seen burning with\r\n great violence in 1793 by Captain Bampton (see Introduction to\r\n Flinders’ “Voyage,” p. 41). Mr. M’Clelland (Report of Committee for\r\n investigating Coal in India, p. 39) has shown that the volcanic band\r\n passing through Barren Island must be extended northwards. It appears\r\n by an old chart, that Cheduba was once an active volcano (see also _\r\n Silliman’s North American Journal_, vol. xxxviii, p. 385). In\r\n Berghaus’ “Phys. Atlas,” 1840, No. 7 of Geological Part, a volcano on\r\n the coast of Pondicherry is said to have burst forth in 1757.\r\n Ordinaire (“Hist. Nat. des Volcans,” p. 218) says that there is one at\r\n the mouth of the Persian Gulf, but I have not coloured it, as he gives\r\n no particulars. A volcano in Amsterdam, or St. Paul’s, in the southern\r\n part of the Indian Ocean, has been seen (_Naut. Mag._ 1838, p. 842) in\r\n action. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres, informs me in a letter, that when he\r\n was at Joanna, he saw at night flames apparently volcanic, issuing\r\n from the chief Comoro Island, and that the Arabs assured him that they\r\n were volcanic, adding that the volcano burned more during the wet\r\n season. I have marked this as a volcano, though with some hesitation,\r\n on account of the possibility of the flame arising from gaseous\r\n sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uncoloured coasts consist, first and chiefly, of those, where there\r\nare no coral-reefs, or such small portions as to be quite\r\ninsignificant. Secondly, of those coasts where there are reefs, but\r\nwhere the sea is very shallow, for in this case the reefs generally lie\r\nfar from the land, and become very irregular, in their forms: where\r\nthey have not become irregular, they have been coloured. thirdly, if I\r\nhad the means of ascertaining the fact, I should not colour a reef\r\nmerely coating the edges of a submarine crater, or of a level submerged\r\nbank; for such superficial\r\nformations differ essentially, even when not in external appearance,\r\nfrom reefs whose foundations as well as superficies have been wholly\r\nformed by the growth of coral. Fourthly, in the Red Sea, and within\r\nsome parts of the East Indian Archipelago (if the imperfect charts of\r\nthe latter can be trusted), there are many scattered reefs, of small\r\nsize, represented in the chart by mere dots, which rise out of deep\r\nwater: these cannot be arranged under either of the three classes: in\r\nthe Red Sea, however, some of these little reefs, from their position,\r\nseem once to have formed parts of a continuous barrier. There exist,\r\nalso, scattered in the open ocean, some linear and irregularly formed\r\nstrips of coral-reef, which, as shown in the last chapter, are probably\r\nallied in their origin to atolls; but as they do not belong to that\r\nclass, they have not been coloured; they are very few in number and of\r\ninsignificant dimensions. Lastly, some reefs are left uncoloured from\r\nthe want of information respecting them, and some because they are of\r\nan intermediate structure between the barrier and fringing classes. The\r\nvalue of the map is lessened, in proportion to the number of reefs\r\nwhich I have been obliged to leave uncoloured, although, in a\r\ntheoretical point of view, few of them present any great difficulty:\r\nbut their number is not very great, as will be found by comparing the\r\nmap with the statements in the Appendix. I have experienced more\r\ndifficulty in colouring fringing-reefs than in colouring barrier-reefs,\r\nas the former, from their much less dimensions, have less attracted the\r\nattention of navigators. As I have had to seek my information from all\r\nkinds of sources, and often from indirect ones, I do not venture to\r\nhope that the map is free from many errors. Nevertheless, I trust it\r\nwill give an approximately correct view of the general distribution of\r\nthe coral-reefs over the whole world (with the exception of some\r\nfringing-reefs on the coast of Brazil, not included within the limits\r\nof the map), and of their arrangement into the three great classes,\r\nwhich, though necessarily very imperfect from the nature of the objects\r\nclassified, have been adopted by most voyagers. I may further remark,\r\nthat the dark blue colour represents land entirely composed of\r\ncoral-rock; the pale blue, land with a wide and thick border of\r\ncoral-rock; and the red, a mere narrow fringe of coral-rock.\r\n\r\nLooking now at the map under the theoretical point of view indicated in\r\nthe last chapter, the two blue tints signify that the foundations of\r\nthe reefs thus coloured have subsided to a considerable amount, at a\r\nslower rate than that of the upward growth of the corals, and that\r\nprobably in many cases they are still subsiding. The red signifies that\r\nthe shores which support fringing-reefs have not subsided (at least to\r\nany considerable\r\namount, for the effects of a subsidence on a small scale would in no\r\ncase be distinguishable); but that they have remained nearly stationary\r\nsince the period when they first became fringed by reefs; or that they\r\nare now rising or have been upraised, with new lines of reefs\r\nsuccessively formed on them: these latter alternatives are obviously\r\nimplied, as newly formed lines of shore, after elevations of the land,\r\nwould be in the same state with respect to the growth of\r\nfringing-reefs, as stationary coasts. If during the prolonged\r\nsubsidence of a shore, coral-reefs grew for the first time on it, or if\r\nan old barrier-reef were destroyed and submerged, and new reefs became\r\nattached to the land, these would necessarily at first belong to the\r\nfringing class, and, therefore, be coloured red, although the coast was\r\nsinking: but I have no reason to believe, that from this source of\r\nerror, any coast has been coloured wrongly with respect to movement\r\nindicated. Well characterised atolls and encircling barrier-reefs,\r\nwhere several occur in a group, or a single barrier-reef if of large\r\ndimensions, leave scarcely any doubt on the mind respecting the\r\nmovement by which they have been produced; and even a small amount of\r\nsubsequent elevation is soon betrayed. The evidence from a single atoll\r\nor a single encircling barrier-reef, must be received with some\r\ncaution, for the former may possibly be based upon a submerged crater\r\nor bank, and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment, or of\r\nworn-down rock. From these remarks we may with greater certainty infer\r\nthat the spaces, especially the larger ones, tinted blue in the map,\r\nhave subsided, than that the red spaces have remained stationary, or\r\nhave been upraised.\r\n\r\n_On the grouping of the different classes of reefs._—Having made these\r\npreliminary remarks, I will consider first how far the grouping of the\r\ndifferent kinds of coral-islands and reefs is corroborative of the\r\ntruth of the theory. A glance at the map shows that the reefs, coloured\r\nblue and red, produced under widely different conditions, are not\r\nindiscriminately mixed together. Atolls and barrier-reefs, on the other\r\nhand, as may be seen by the two blue tints, generally lie near each\r\nother; and this would be the natural result of both having been\r\nproduced during the subsidence of the areas in which they stand. Thus,\r\nthe largest group of encircled islands is that of the Society\r\nArchipelago; and these islands are surrounded by atolls, and only\r\nseparated by a narrow space from the large group of Low atolls. In the\r\nmidst of the Caroline atolls, there are three fine encircled islands.\r\nThe northern point of the barrier-reef of New Caledonia seems itself,\r\nas before remarked, to form a complete large atoll. The great\r\nAustralian barrier is described as including both atolls and small\r\nencircled islands. Captain King[3] mentions many atoll-formed and\r\nencircling coral-reefs, some of which lie within the barrier, and\r\nothers may be said (for instance between lat. 16° and 13°) to form part\r\nof it. Flinders[4] has described an atoll-formed reef in lat. 10°,\r\nseven miles long and from one to three broad, resembling a boot in\r\nshape, with apparently very deep water\r\nwithin. Eight miles westward of this, and forming part of the barrier,\r\nlie the Murray Islands, which are high and are encircled. In the\r\nCorallian Sea, between the two great barriers of Australia and New\r\nCaledonia, there are many low islets and coral-reefs, some of which are\r\nannular, or horse-shoe shaped. Observing the smallness of the scale of\r\nthe map, the parallels of latitude being nine hundred miles apart, we\r\nsee that none of the large groups of reefs and islands supposed to have\r\nbeen produced by long-continued subsidence, lie near extensive lines of\r\ncoast coloured red, which are supposed to have remained stationary\r\nsince the growth of their reefs, or to have been upraised and new lines\r\nof reefs formed on them. Where the red and blue circles do occur near\r\neach other, I am able, in several instances, to show that there have\r\nbeen oscillations of level, subsidence having preceded the elevation of\r\nthe red spots; and elevation having preceded the subsidence of the blue\r\nspots: and in this case the juxtaposition of reefs belonging to the two\r\ngreat types of structure is little surprising. We may, therefore,\r\nconclude that the proximity in the same areas of the two classes of\r\nreefs, which owe their origin to the subsidence of the earth’s crust,\r\nand their separation from those formed during its stationary or\r\nuprising condition, holds good to the full extent, which might have\r\nbeen anticipated by our theory.\r\n\r\n [3] Sailing directions, appended to vol. ii of his “Surveying Voyage\r\n to Australia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] “Voyage to Terra Australis,” vol. ii, p. 336.\r\n\r\nAs groups of atolls have originated in the upward growth, at each fresh\r\nsinking of the land, of those reefs which primarily fringed the shores\r\nof one great island, or of several smaller ones; so we might expect\r\nthat these rings of coral-rock, like so many rude outline charts, will\r\nstill retain some traces of the general form, or at least general\r\nrange, of the land, round which they were first modelled. That this is\r\nthe case with the atolls in the Southern Pacific as far as their range\r\nis concerned, seems highly probable, when we observe that the three\r\nprincipal groups are directed in north-west and south-east lines, and\r\nthat nearly all the land in the S. Pacific ranges in this same\r\ndirection; namely, N. Western Australia, New Caledonia, the northern\r\nhalf of New Zealand, the New Hebrides, Saloman, Navigator, Society,\r\nMarquesas, and Austral archipelagoes: in the Northern Pacific, the\r\nCaroline atolls abut against the north-west line of the Marshall\r\natolls, much in the same manner as the east and west line of islands\r\nfrom Ceram to New Britain do on New Ireland: in the Indian Ocean the\r\nLaccadive and Maldiva atolls extend nearly parallel to the western and\r\nmountainous coast of India. In most respects, there is a perfect\r\nresemblance with ordinary islands in the grouping of atolls and in\r\ntheir form: thus the outline of all the larger groups is elongated; and\r\nthe greater number of the individual atolls are elongated in the same\r\ndirection with the group, in which they stand. The Chagos group is less\r\nelongated than is usual with other groups, and the individual atolls in\r\nit are likewise but little elongated; this is strikingly seen by\r\ncomparing them with the neighbouring Maldiva atolls. In the Marshall\r\nand Maldiva archipelagoes, the atolls are ranged in two parallel lines,\r\nlike the mountains in a great double mountain-chain. Some of the\r\natolls, in the larger archipelagoes, stand so near to each other, and\r\nhave such an evident relationship in\r\nform, that they compose little sub-groups: in the Caroline Archipelago,\r\none such sub-group consists of Pouynipete, a lofty island encircled by\r\na barrier-reef, and separated by a channel only four miles and a half\r\nwide from Andeema atoll, with a second atoll a little further off. In\r\nall these respects an examination of a series of charts will show how\r\nperfectly groups of atolls resemble groups of common islands.\r\n\r\n_On the direct evidence of the blue spaces in the map having subsided\r\nduring the upward growth of the reefs so coloured, and of the red\r\nspaces having remained stationary, or having been upraised._—With\r\nrespect to subsidence, I have shown in the last chapter, that we cannot\r\nexpect to obtain in countries inhabited only by semi-civilised races,\r\ndemonstrative proofs of a movement, which invariably tends to conceal\r\nits own evidence. But on the coral-islands supposed to have been\r\nproduced by subsidence, we have proofs of changes in their external\r\nappearance—of a round of decay and renovation—of the last vestiges of\r\nland on some—of its first commencement on others: we hear of storms\r\ndesolating them to the astonishment of their inhabitants: we know by\r\nthe great fissures with which some of them are traversed, and by the\r\nearthquakes felt under others, that subterranean disturbances of some\r\nkind are in progress. These facts, if not directly connected with\r\nsubsidence, as I believe they are, at least show how difficult it would\r\nbe to discover proofs of such movement by ordinary means. At Keeling\r\natoll, however, I have described some appearances, which seem directly\r\nto show that subsidence did take place there during the late\r\nearthquakes. Vanikoro, according to Chevalier Dillon,[5] is often\r\nviolently shaken by earthquakes, and there, the unusual depth of the\r\nchannel between the shore and the reef,—the almost entire absence of\r\nislets on the reef,—its wall-like structure on the inner side, and the\r\nsmall quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains, all\r\nseem to show that this island has not remained long at its present\r\nlevel, with the lagoon-channel subjected to the accumulation of\r\nsediment, and the reef to the wear and tear of the breakers. At the\r\nSociety Archipelago, on the other hand, where a slight tremor is only\r\nrarely felt, the shoaliness of the lagoon-channels round some of the\r\nislands, the number of islets formed on the reefs of others, and the\r\nbroad belt of low land at the foot of the mountains, indicate that,\r\nalthough there must have been great subsidence to have produced the\r\nbarrier-reefs, there has since elapsed a long stationary period.[6]\r\n\r\n [5] See Captain Dillon’s “Voyage in search of La Peyrouse.” M. Cordier\r\n in his “Report on the Voyage of the ‘Astrolabe’” (p. cxi, vol. i),\r\n speaking of Vanikoro, says the shores are surrounded by reefs of\r\n madrepore, “qu’on assure etre de formation tout-a-fait moderne.” I\r\n have in vain endeavoured to learn some further particulars about this\r\n remarkable passage. I may here add, that according to our theory, the\r\n island of Pouynipete (Plate I, Fig. 7), in the Caroline Archipelago,\r\n being encircled by a barrier-reef, must have subsided. In the _ New S.\r\n Wales Lit. Advert._ February 1835 (which I have seen through the\r\n favour of Dr. Lloghtsky), there is an account of this island\r\n (subsequently confirmed by Mr. Campbell), in which it is said, “At the\r\n N.E. end, at a place called Tamen, there are ruins of a town, _now\r\n only_ accessible by boats, the waves _reaching to the steps of the\r\n houses._” Judging from this passage, one would be tempted to conclude\r\n that the island must have subsided, since these houses were built. I\r\n may, also, here append a statement in Malte Brun (vol. ix, p. 775,\r\n given without any authority), that the sea gains in an extraordinary\r\n manner on the coast of Cochin China, which lies in front and near the\r\n subsiding coral-reefs in the China Sea: as the coast is granitic, and\r\n not alluvial, it is scarcely possible that the encroachment of the sea\r\n can be owing to the washing away of the land; and if so, it must be\r\n due to subsidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Mr. Couthouy states (“Remarks,” p. 44) that at Tahiti and Eimeo\r\n the space between the reef and the shore has been nearly filled up by\r\n the extension of those coral-reefs, which within most barrier-reefs\r\n merely fringe the land. From this circumstance, he arrives at the same\r\n conclusion as I have done, that the Society Islands since their\r\n subsidence, have remained stationary during a long period; but he\r\n further believes that they have recently commenced rising, as well as\r\n the whole area of the Low Archipelago. He does not give any detailed\r\n proofs regarding the elevation of the Society Islands, but I shall\r\n refer to this subject in another part of this chapter. Before making\r\n some further comments, I may observe how satisfactory it is to me, to\r\n find Mr. Couthouy affirming, that “having personally examined a large\r\n number of coral-islands, and also residing eight months among the\r\n volcanic class, having shore and partially encircling reefs, I may be\r\n permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a\r\n conviction of the correctness of the theory of Mr. Darwin.”\r\n    This gentleman believes, that subsequently to the subsidence by\r\n    which the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced, the whole\r\n    area has been elevated to the amount of a few feet; this would\r\n    indeed be a remarkable fact; but as far as I am able to judge, the\r\n    grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong. He states\r\n    that he found in almost every atoll which he visited, the shores of\r\n    the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the\r\n    sea-level, and containing imbedded Tridacnæ and corals standing as\r\n    they grew; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts, but\r\n    below a certain line they continued to flourish. In the lagoons,\r\n    also, he frequently met with clusters of Madrepore, with their\r\n    extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of\r\n    the water. Now, these appearances are exactly what I should have\r\n    expected, without any subsequent elevation having taken place; and\r\n    I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact,\r\n    that corals, when constantly bathed by the surf, can exist at a\r\n    higher level than in quite tranquil water, as in a lagoon. As long,\r\n    therefore, as the waves continued at low water to break entirely\r\n    over parts of the annular reef of an atoll, submerged to a small\r\n    depth, the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue\r\n    living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon, into\r\n    which the waves rolled; but as soon as the outer edge of the reef\r\n    grew up to its utmost possible height, or if the reef were very\r\n    broad nearly to that height, the force of the breakers would be\r\n    checked, and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the\r\n    lagoon would occasionally be left dry, and thus be partially or\r\n    wholly destroyed. Even in atolls, which have not lately subsided,\r\n    if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth\r\n    seaward (each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical\r\n    height as at Keeling atoll), the line where the waves broke most\r\n    heavily would advance outwards, and therefore the corals, which\r\n    when living near the margin, were washed by the breaking waves\r\n    during the whole of each tide, would cease being so, and would\r\n    therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed\r\n    and dead. The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops\r\n    of their branches exposed, seems to be an analogous fact, to the\r\n    great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling\r\n    atoll; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show, has\r\n    resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and\r\n    choked up with reefs, so that during high winds, the rising of the\r\n    tide (as observed by the inhabitants) is checked, and the corals,\r\n    which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height, are\r\n    occasionally exposed, and thus are killed: and this is a condition\r\n    of things, towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its\r\n    subsidence must be tending. Or if we look to the state of an atoll\r\n    directly after a subsidence of some fathoms, the waves would roll\r\n    heavily over the entire circumference of the reef, and the surface\r\n    of the lagoon would, like the ocean, never be quite at rest, and\r\n    therefore the corals in the lagoon, from being constantly laved by\r\n    the rippling water, might extend their branches to a little greater\r\n    height than they could, when the lagoon became enclosed and\r\n    protected. Christmas atoll (2° N. lat.) which has a very shallow\r\n    lagoon, and differs in several respects from most atolls, possibly\r\n    may have been elevated recently; but its highest part appears\r\n    (Couthouy, p. 46) to be only ten feet above the sea-level. The\r\n    facts of a second class, adduced by Mr. Couthouy, in support of the\r\n    alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago, are not all\r\n    (especially those referring to a shelf of rock) quite intelligible\r\n    to me; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the\r\n    reef, must have been moved into their present position, when the\r\n    reef was at a lower level; but here again the force of the breakers\r\n    on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward\r\n    growth without any change in its level, has not, I think, been\r\n    borne in mind. We should, also, not overlook the occasional agency\r\n    of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes. Mr. Couthouy further\r\n    argues, that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed\r\n    on the reef, they have been elevated; he infers this from the\r\n    greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases, where they\r\n    are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides, but at some\r\n    height on their sides, near the line of high-water mark, as shown\r\n    in an accompanying diagram. My former remark again applies here,\r\n    with this further observation, that as the waves have to roll over\r\n    a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments, their force\r\n    must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the\r\n    tide rises, and therefore I should have expected that the chief\r\n    line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of\r\n    high-water mark; and if the reef had grown outwards, that there\r\n    would have been lines of erosion at greater heights. The\r\n    conclusion, to which I am finally led by the interesting\r\n    observations of Mr. Couthouy is, that the atolls in the Low\r\n    Archipelago have, like the Society Islands, remained at a\r\n    stationary level for a long period: and this probably is the\r\n    ordinary course of events, subsidence supervening after long\r\n    intervals of rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the red colour; as on our map, the areas which have sunk\r\nslowly downwards to great depths are many and large, we might naturally\r\nhave been led to conjecture, that with such great changes of level in\r\nprogress, the coasts which have been fringed probably for ages (for we\r\nhave no reason to believe that coral-reefs are of short duration),\r\nwould not have remained all this time stationary, but would frequently\r\nhave undergone movements of elevation. This supposition, we shall\r\nimmediately see, holds good to a remarkable extent; and although a\r\nstationary condition of the land can hardly ever be open to proof, from\r\nthe evidence being only negative, we are, in some degree, enabled to\r\nascertain the correctness of the parts coloured red on the map, by the\r\ndirect testimony of upraised organic remains of a modern date. Before\r\ngoing into the details on this head (printed in small type), I may\r\nmention, that when reading a memoir on coral formations by MM. Quoy and\r\nGaimard[7] I was astonished to find, for I knew that they had crossed\r\nboth the Pacific and Indian Oceans, that their descriptions were\r\napplicable only to reefs of the fringing class; but my astonishment\r\nended satisfactorily, when I discovered that, by a strange chance, all\r\nthe islands which these eminent naturalists had visited, though several\r\nin number, namely, the Mauritius, Timor, New Guinea, the Mariana, and\r\nSandwich Archipelagoes, could be shown by their own statements to have\r\nbeen elevated within a recent geological era.\r\n\r\n [7] “Annales des Sciences Nat.” tom. vi, p. 279, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eastern half of the Pacific, the _ Sandwich Islands_ are all\r\nfringed, and almost every naturalist who has visited them, has remarked\r\non the abundance of elevated corals and shells, apparently identical\r\nwith living species. The Rev. W. Ellis informs me, that he has noticed\r\nround several parts of Hawaii, beds of coral-detritus, about twenty\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and where the coast is low they extend\r\nfar inland. Upraised coral-rock forms a considerable part of the\r\nborders of Oahu; and at Elizabeth Island[8] it composes three strata,\r\neach about ten feet thick. Nihau, which forms the northern, as Hawaii\r\ndoes the southern end of the group (350 miles in length), likewise\r\nseems to consist of coral and volcanic rocks. Mr. Couthouy[9] has\r\nlately described with interesting details, several upraised beaches,\r\nancient reefs with their surfaces perfectly preserved, and beds of\r\nrecent shells and corals, at the islands of Maui, Morokai, Oahu, and\r\nTauai (or Kauai) in this group. Mr. Pierce, an intelligent resident at\r\nOahu, is convinced, from changes which have taken place within his\r\nmemory, during the last sixteen years, “that the elevation is at\r\npresent going forward at a very perceptible rate.” The natives at Kauai\r\nstate that the land is there gaining rapidly on the sea, and Mr.\r\nCouthouy has no doubt, from the nature of the strata, that this has\r\nbeen effected by an elevation of the land.\r\n\r\n [8] “Zoology of Captain Beechey’s Voyage,” p. 176. See also MM. Quoy\r\n and Gaimard in “Annales de Scien. Nat.” tom. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] “Remarks on Coral Formations,” p. 51.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the Low Archipelago, Elizabeth Island is\r\ndescribed by Captain Beechey,[10] as being quite flat, and about eighty\r\nfeet in height; it is entirely composed of dead corals, forming a\r\nhoneycombed, but compact rock. In cases like this, of an island having\r\nexactly the appearance, which the elevation of any one of the smaller\r\nsurrounding atolls with a shallow lagoon would present, one is led to\r\nconclude (with little better reason, however, than the improbability of\r\nsuch small and low fabrics lasting, for an immense period, exposed to\r\nthe many destroying agents of nature), that the elevation has taken\r\nplace at an epoch not geologically remote. When merely the surface of\r\nan island of ordinary formation is strewed with marine\r\nbodies, and that continuously, or nearly so, from the beach to a\r\ncertain height, and not above that height, it is exceedingly improbable\r\nthat such organic remains, although they may not have been specially\r\nexamined, should belong to any ancient period. It is necessary to bear\r\nthese remarks in mind, in considering the evidence of the elevatory\r\nmovements in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, as it does not often rest\r\non specific determinations, and therefore should be received with\r\ncaution. Six of the _Cook and Austral Islands_ (S.W. of the Society\r\ngroup), are fringed; of these, five were described to me by the Rev. J.\r\nWilliams, as formed of coral-rock, associated with some basalt in\r\nMangaia), and the sixth as lofty and basaltic. Mangaia is nearly three\r\nhundred feet high, with a level summit; and according to Mr. S.\r\nWilson[11] it is an upraised reef; “and there are in the central\r\nhollow, formerly the bed of the lagoon, many scattered patches of\r\ncoral-rock, some of them raised to a height of forty feet.” These\r\nknolls of coral-rock were evidently once separate reefs in the lagoon\r\nof an atoll. Mr. Martens, at Sydney, informed me that this island is\r\nsurrounded by a terrace-like plain at about the height of a hundred\r\nfeet, which probably marks a pause in its elevation. From these facts\r\nwe may infer, perhaps, that the Cook and Austral Islands have been\r\nupheaved at a period probably not very remote.\r\n\r\n [10] Beechey’s “Voyage in the Pacific,” p. 46, 4to ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Couthouy’s “Remarks,” p. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Savage Island_ (S.E. of the Friendly group), is about forty feet in\r\nheight. Forster[12] describes the plants as already growing out of the\r\ndead, but still upright and spreading trees of coral; and the younger\r\nForster[13] believes that an ancient lagoon is now represented by a\r\ncentral plain; here we cannot doubt that the elevatory forces have\r\nrecently acted. The same conclusion may be extended, though with\r\nsomewhat less certainty, to the islands of the _friendly group_, which\r\nhave been well described in the second and third voyages of Cook. The\r\nsurface of Tongatabou is low and level, but with some parts a hundred\r\nfeet high; the whole consists of coral-rock, “which yet shows the\r\ncavities and irregularities worn into it by the action of the\r\ntides.”[14] On Eoua the same appearances were noticed at an elevation\r\nof between two hundred and three hundred feet. Vavao, also, at the\r\nopposite or northern end of the group, consists, according to the Rev.\r\nJ. Williams, of coral-rock. Tongatabou, with its northern extensive\r\nreefs, resembles either an upraised atoll with one half originally\r\nimperfect, or one unequally elevated; and Anamouka, an atoll equally\r\nelevated. This latter island contains[15] in its centre a salt-water\r\nlake, about a mile-and-a-half in diameter, without any communication\r\nwith the sea, and around it the land rises gradually like a bank; the\r\nhighest part is only between twenty and thirty feet; but on this part,\r\nas well as on the rest of the land (which, as Cook observes, rises\r\nabove the height of true lagoon-islands), coral-rock, like that on the\r\nbeach, was found. In the _Navigator Archipelago_, Mr. Couthouy[16]\r\nfound on Manua many and very large fragments of coral at the height of\r\neighty feet, “on a steep hill-side, rising half a mile inland from a\r\nlow sandy plain abounding in marine remains.” The fragments were\r\nembedded in a mixture of decomposed lava and sand. It is not stated\r\nwhether they were accompanied by shells, or whether the corals\r\nresembled recent species; as these\r\nremains were embedded they possibly may belong to a remote epoch; but I\r\npresume this was not the opinion of Mr. Couthouy. Earthquakes are very\r\nfrequent in this archipelago.\r\n\r\n [12] “Observations made during Voyage round the World,” p. 147.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] “Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Cook’s “Third Voyage” (4to ed.), vol. i, p. 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] _Ibid_., vol. i, p. 235.\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] “Remarks on Coral-Formations,” p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill proceeding westward we come to the _New Hebrides_; on these\r\nislands, Mr. G. Bennett (author of “Wanderings in New South Wales”),\r\ninforms me he found much coral at a great altitude, which he considered\r\nof recent origin. Respecting _Santa Cruz_, and the _Solomon\r\nArchipelago_, I have no information; but at New Ireland, which forms\r\nthe northern point of the latter chain, both Labillardiere and Lesson\r\nhave described large beds of an apparently very modern madreporitic\r\nrock, with the form of the corals little altered. The latter author[17]\r\nstates that this formation composes a newer line of coast, modelled\r\nround an ancient one. There only remains to be described in the\r\nPacific, that curved line of fringed islands, of which the _ Marianas_\r\nform the main part. Of these Guam, Rota, Tiniam, Saypan, and some\r\nislets farther north, are described by Quoy and Gaimard,[18] and\r\nChamisso,[19] as chiefly composed of madreporitic limestone, which\r\nattains a considerable elevation, and is in several cases worn into\r\nsuccessively rising cliffs: the two former naturalists seem to have\r\ncompared the corals and shells with the existing ones, and state that\r\nthey are of recent species. _Fais_, which lies in the prolonged line of\r\nthe Marianas, is the only island in this part of the sea which is\r\nfringed; it is ninety feet high, and consists entirely of madreporitic\r\nrock.[20]\r\n\r\n [17] “Voyage de la _Coquille_,” Part.

M. Lesson[21] states, that near Port Dory, on the\r\nnorth coast of New Guinea, the shores are flanked, to the height of 150\r\nfeet, by madreporitic strata of modern date. He mentions similar\r\nformations at Waigiou, Amboina, Bourou, Ceram, Sonda, and Timor: at\r\nthis latter place, MM. Quoy and Gaimard[22] have likewise described the\r\nprimitive rocks, as coated to a considerable height with coral. Some\r\nsmall islets eastward of Timor are said in Kolff’s “Voyage,”[23] to\r\nresemble small coral islets upraised some feet above the sea. Dr.\r\nMalcolmson informs me that Dr. Hardie found in JAVA an extensive\r\nformation, containing an abundance of shells, of which the greater part\r\nappear to be of existing species. Dr. Jack[24] has described some\r\nupraised shells and corals, apparently recent, on Pulo Nias off\r\n_Sumatra_; and Marsden relates in his history of this great island,\r\nthat the names of many promontories, show that they were originally\r\nislands. On part of the west\r\ncoast of _Borneo_ and at the _Sooloo Islands_, the form of the land,\r\nthe nature of the soil, and the water-washed rocks, present\r\nappearances[25] (although it is doubtful whether such vague evidence is\r\nworthy of mention), of having recently been covered by the sea; and the\r\ninhabitants of the Sooloo Islands believe that this has been the case.\r\nMr. Cuming, who has lately investigated, with so much success, the\r\nnatural history of the _Philippines_, found near Cabagan, in Luzon,\r\nabout fifty feet above the level of the R. Cagayan, and seventy miles\r\nfrom its mouth, a large bed of fossil shells: these, he informs me, are\r\nof the same species with those now existing on the shores of the\r\nneighbouring islands. From the accounts given us by Captain Basil Hall\r\nand Captain Beechey[26] of the lines of inland reefs, and walls of\r\ncoral-rock worn into caves, above the present reach of the waves, at\r\nthe _Loo Choo_ Islands, there can be little doubt that they have been\r\nupraised at no very remote period.\r\n\r\n [21] Partie Zoolog., “Voyage de la _Coquille_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] “Ann. des Scien.

On the Peninsula\r\n of Malacca, in front of Pinang, 5° 30′ N., Dr. Ward collected some\r\n shells, which Dr. Malcolmson informs me, although not compared with\r\n existing species, had a recent appearance. Dr. Ward describes in this\r\n neighbourhood (“Trans. Asiat. Soc.” vol. xviii, part ii, p. 166) a\r\n single water-worn rock, with a conglomerate of sea-shells at its base,\r\n situated six miles inland, which, according to the traditions of the\r\n natives, was once surrounded by the sea. Captain Low has also\r\n described (_Ibid_., part i, p. 131) mounds of shells lying two miles\r\n inland on this line of coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] “Notices of the East Indian Arch.” Singapore, 1828, p. 6, and\r\n Append., p. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] Captain B.

There is\r\nalso some reason for believing that the western shores of India, north\r\nof Ceylon, have been upraised within the recent period.[28] _Mauritius_\r\nhas certainly been upraised within the recent period, as I have stated\r\nin the chapter on fringing-reefs. The northern extremity of\r\n_Madagascar_ is described by Captain Owen[29] as formed of madreporitic\r\nrock, as likewise are the shores and outlying islands along an immense\r\nspace of _ Eastern Africa_, from a little north of the equator for nine\r\nhundred miles southward. Nothing can be more vague than the expression\r\n“madreporitic rock;” but at the same time it is, I think, scarcely\r\npossible to look at the chart of the linear islets, which rise to a\r\ngreater height than can be accounted for by the growth of coral, in\r\nfront of the coast, from the equator to 2° S., without feeling\r\nconvinced that a line of fringing-reefs has been elevated at a period\r\nso recent, that no great changes have since taken place on the surface\r\nof this part of the globe. Some, also, of the\r\nhigher islands of madreporitic rock on this coast, for instance Pemba,\r\nhave very singular forms, which seem to show the combined effect of the\r\ngrowth of coral round submerged banks, and their subsequent upheaval.\r\nDr. Allan informs me that he never observed any elevated organic\r\nremains on the _Seychelles_, which come under our fringed class.\r\n\r\n [27] “Travels in Ceylon,” p. 13. This madreporitic formation is\r\n mentioned by M. Cordier in his report to the Institute (May 4th,\r\n 1839), on the voyage of the _Chevrette_, as one of immense extent, and\r\n belonging to the latest tertiary period.\r\n\r\n\r\n [28] Dr. Benza, in his “Journey through the N. Circars” (the _ Madras\r\n Lit. and Scient. Journ._ vol. v.) has described a formation with\r\n recent fresh-water and marine shells, occurring at the distance of\r\n three or four miles from the present shore. Dr. Benza, in conversation\r\n with me, attributed their position to a rise of the land. Dr.\r\n Malcolmson, however (and there cannot be a higher authority on the\r\n geology of India) informs me that he suspects that these beds may have\r\n been formed by the mere action of the waves and currents accumulating\r\n sediment. From analogy I should much incline to Dr. Benza’s opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n [29] Owen’s “Africa,” vol. ii, p. 37, for Madagascar; and for S.\r\n Africa, vol. i, pp. 412 and 426. Lieutenant Boteler’s narrative\r\n contains fuller particulars regarding the coral-rock, vol. i, p. 174,\r\n and vol. ii, pp. 41 and 54. See also Ruschenberger’s “Voyage round the\r\n World,” vol. i, p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the formations round the shores of the _Red Sea_, as\r\ndescribed by several authors, shows that the whole of this large area\r\nhas been elevated within a very recent tertiary epoch. A part of this\r\nspace in the appended map, is coloured blue, indicating the presence of\r\nbarrier-reefs: on which circumstance I shall presently make some\r\nremarks. Rüppell[30] states that the tertiary formation, of which he\r\nhas examined the organic remains, forms a fringe along the shores with\r\na uniform height of from thirty and forty feet from the mouth of the\r\nGulf of Suez to about latitude 26°; but that south of 26°, the beds\r\nattain only the height of from twelve to fifteen feet. This, however,\r\ncan hardly be quite accurate; although possibly there may be a decrease\r\nin the elevation of the shores in the middle parts of the Red Sea, for\r\nDr. Malcolmson (as he informs me) collected from the cliffs of Camaran\r\nIsland (lat. 15° 30′ S.) shells and corals, apparently recent, at a\r\nheight between thirty and forty feet; and Mr. Salt (“Travels in\r\nAbyssinia”) describes a similar formation a little southward on the\r\nopposite shore at Amphila. Moreover, near the mouth of the Gulf of\r\nSuez, although on the coast opposite to that on which Dr. Rüppell says\r\nthat the modern beds attain a height of only thirty to forty feet, Mr.\r\nBurton[31] found a deposit replete with existing species of shells, at\r\nthe height of 200 feet. In an admirable series of drawings by Captain\r\nMoresby, I could see how continuously the cliff-bounded low plains of\r\nthis formation extended with a nearly equable height, both on the\r\neastern and western shores. The southern coast of Arabia seems to have\r\nbeen subjected to the same elevatory movement, for Dr. Malcolmson found\r\nat Sahar low cliffs containing shells and corals, apparently of recent\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n [30] Rüppell, “Reise in Abyssinien,” Band i., s. 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n [31] Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” 5th ed., vol. iv, p. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Persian Gulf_ abounds with coral-reefs; but as it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from sand-banks in this shallow sea, I have coloured\r\nonly some near the mouth; towards the head of the gulf Mr.\r\nAinsworth[32] says that the land is worn into terraces, and that the\r\nbeds contain organic remains of existing forms. The _West Indian\r\nArchipelago_ of “fringed” islands, alone remains to be mentioned;\r\nevidence of an elevation within a late tertiary epoch of nearly the\r\nwhole of this great area, may be found in the works of almost all the\r\nnaturalists who have visited it. I will give some of the principal\r\nreferences in a note.[33]\r\n\r\n [32] Ainsworth’s “Assyria and Babylon,” p. 217.\r\n\r\n\r\n [33] On Florida and the north shores of the Gulf of Mexico, Rogers’\r\n “Report to Brit.

Soc., orally described some very modern beds\r\n lying on the N.W. parts of Cuba. I might have added many other less\r\n important references.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable on reviewing these details, to observe in how\r\nmany instances fringing-reefs round the shores, have coincided with the\r\nexistence on the land of upraised organic remains, which seem, from\r\nevidence more or less satisfactory, to belong to a late tertiary\r\nperiod. It may, however, be objected, that similar proofs of elevation,\r\nperhaps, occur on the coasts coloured blue in our map: but this\r\ncertainly is not the case with the few following and doubtful\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nThe entire area of the Red Sea appears to have been upraised within a\r\nmodern period; nevertheless I have been compelled (though on\r\nunsatisfactory evidence, as given in the Appendix) to class the reefs\r\nin the middle part, as barrier-reefs; should, however, the statements\r\nprove accurate to the less height of the tertiary bed in this middle\r\npart, compared with the northern and southern districts, we might well\r\nsuspect that it had subsided subsequently to the general elevation by\r\nwhich the whole area has been upraised. Several authors[34] have stated\r\nthat they have observed shells and corals high up on the mountains of\r\nthe Society Islands,—a group encircled by barrier-reefs, and,\r\ntherefore, supposed to have subsided: at Tahiti Mr. Stutchbury found on\r\nthe apex of one of the highest mountains, between 5,000 and 7,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, “a distinct and regular stratum of\r\nsemi-fossil coral.” At Tahiti, however, other naturalists, as well as\r\nmyself, have searched in vain at a low level near the coast, for\r\nupraised shells or masses of coral-reef, where if present they could\r\nhardly have been overlooked. From this fact, I concluded that probably\r\nthe organic remains strewed high up on the surface of the land, had\r\noriginally been embedded in the volcanic strata, and had subsequently\r\nbeen washed out by the rain. I have since heard from the Rev. W. Ellis,\r\nthat the remains which he met with, were (as he believes)\r\ninterstratified with an argillaceous tuff; this likewise was the case\r\nwith the shells observed by the Rev. D. Tyerman at Huaheine. These\r\nremains have not been specifically examined; they may, therefore, and\r\nespecially the stratum observed by Mr. Stutchbury at an immense height,\r\nbe contemporaneous with the first formation of the Society Islands, and\r\nbe of any degree of antiquity; or they may have been deposited at some\r\nsubsequent, but probably not very recent, period of elevation; for if\r\nthe period had been recent, the entire surface of the coast land of\r\nthese islands, where the reefs are so extensive, would have been coated\r\nwith upraised coral,\r\nwhich certainly is not the case. Two of the Harvey, or Cook Islands,\r\nnamely, Aitutaki and Manouai, are encircled by reefs, which extend so\r\nfar from the land, that I have coloured them blue, although with much\r\nhesitation, as the space within the reef is shallow, and the outline of\r\nthe land is not abrupt. These two islands consist of coral-rock; but I\r\nhave no evidence of their recent elevation, besides, the improbability\r\nof Mangaia, a fringed island in the same group (but distant 170 miles),\r\nhaving retained its nearly perfect atoll-like structure, during any\r\nimmense lapse of time after its upheaval. The Red Sea, therefore, is\r\nthe only area in which we have clear proofs of the recent elevation of\r\na district, which, by our theory (although the barrier-reefs are there\r\nnot well characterised), has lately subsided. But we have no reason to\r\nbe surprised at oscillation, of level of this kind having occasionally\r\ntaken place. There can be scarcely any doubt that Savage, Aurora,[35]\r\nand Mangaia Islands, and several of the islands in the Friendly group,\r\nexisted originally as atolls, and these have undoubtedly since been\r\nupraised to some height above the level of the sea; so that by our\r\ntheory, there has here, also, been an oscillation of level,—elevation\r\nhaving succeeded subsidence, instead of, as in the middle part of the\r\nRed Sea and at the Harvey Islands, subsidence having probably succeeded\r\nrecent elevation.\r\n\r\n [34] Ellis, in his “Polynesian Researches,” was the first to call\r\n attention to these remains (vol. i, p. 38), and the tradition of the\r\n natives concerning them. See also Williams, “Nar. of Missionary\r\n Enterprise,” p. 21; also Tyerman and G. Bennett, “Journal of Voyage,”\r\n vol. i, p. 213; also Mr. Couthouy’s “Remarks,” p. 51; but this\r\n principal fact, namely, that there is a mass of upraised coral on the\r\n narrow peninsula of Tiarubu, is from hearsay evidence; also Mr.\r\n Stutchbury, _West of England Journal_, No. i, p. 54. There is a\r\n passage in Von Zach, “Corres. Astronom.” vol. x, p. 266, inferring an\r\n uprising at Tahiti, from a footpath now used, which was formerly\r\n impassable; but I particularly inquired from several native chiefs,\r\n whether they knew of any change of this kind, and they were unanimous\r\n in giving me an answer in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n [35] Aurora Island is described by Mr. Couthouy (“Remarks,” p. 58); it\r\n lies 120 miles north-east of Tahiti; it is not coloured in the\r\n appended map, because it does not appear to be fringed by living\r\n reefs. Mr. Couthouy describes its summit as “presenting a broad\r\n table-land which declines a few feet towards the centre, where we may\r\n suppose the lagoon to have been placed.” It is about two hundred feet\r\n in height, and consists of reef-rock and conglomerate, with existing\r\n species of coral embedded in it. The island has been elevated at two\r\n successive periods; the cliffs being marked halfway up with a\r\n horizontal water-worn line of deep excavations. Aurora Island seems\r\n closely to resemble in structure Elizabeth Island, at the southern end\r\n of the Low Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, that Fais, which, from its composition,\r\nform, height, and situation at the western end of the Caroline\r\nArchipelago, one is strongly induced to believe existed before its\r\nupheaval as an atoll, lies exactly in the prolongation of the curved\r\nline of the Mariana group, which we know to be a line of recent\r\nelevation. I may add, that Elizabeth Island, in the southern part of\r\nthe Low Archipelago, which seems to have had the same kind of origin as\r\nFais, lies near Pitcairn Island, the only one in this part of the ocean\r\nwhich is high, and at the same time not surrounded by an encircling\r\nbarrier-reef.\r\n\r\n_On the absence of active volcanoes in the areas of subsidence, and on\r\ntheir frequent presence in the areas of elevation._—Before making some\r\nconcluding remarks on the relations of the spaces coloured blue and\r\nred, it will be convenient to consider the position on our map of the\r\nvolcanoes historically known to have been in action. It is impossible\r\nnot to be struck, first with the absence of volcanoes in the great\r\nareas of subsidence tinted pale and dark blue,—namely, in the central\r\nparts of the Indian Ocean, in the China Sea, in the sea between the\r\nbarriers\r\nof Australia and New Caledonia, in the Caroline, Marshall, Gilbert, and\r\nLow Archipelagoes; and, secondly, with the coincidence of the principal\r\nvolcanic chains with the parts coloured red, which indicates the\r\npresence of fringing-reefs; and, as we have just seen, the presence in\r\nmost cases of upraised organic remains of a modern date. I may here\r\nremark that the reefs were all coloured before the volcanoes were added\r\nto the map, or indeed before I knew of the existence of several of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe volcano in Torres Strait, at the northern point of Australia, is\r\nthat which lies nearest to a large subsiding area, although situated\r\n125 miles within the outer margin of the actual barrier-reef. The Great\r\nComoro Island, which probably contains a volcano, is only twenty miles\r\ndistant from the barrier-reef of Mohila; Ambil volcano, in the\r\nPhilippines, is distant only a little more than sixty miles from the\r\natoll-formed Appoo reef: and there are two other volcanoes in the map\r\nwithin ninety miles of circles coloured blue. These few cases, which\r\nthus offer partial exceptions to the rule, of volcanoes being placed\r\nremote from the areas of subsidence, lie either near single and\r\nisolated atolls, or near small groups of encircled islands; and these\r\nby our theory can have, in few instances, subsided to the same amount\r\nin depth or area, as groups of atolls. There is not one active volcano\r\nwithin several hundred miles of an archipelago, or even a small group\r\nof atolls. It is, therefore, a striking fact that in the Friendly\r\nArchipelago, which owes its origin to the elevation of a group of\r\natolls, two volcanoes, and, perhaps, others are known to be in action:\r\non the other hand, on several of the encircled islands in the Pacific,\r\nsupposed by our theory to have subsided, there are old craters and\r\nstreams of lava, which show the effects of past and ancient eruptions.\r\nIn these cases, it would appear as if the volcanoes had come into\r\naction, and had become extinguished on the same spots, according as the\r\nelevating or subsiding movements prevailed.\r\n\r\nThere are some other coasts on the map, where volcanoes in a state of\r\naction concur with proofs of recent elevation, besides those coloured\r\nred from being fringed by coral-reefs. Thus I hope to show in a future\r\nvolume, that nearly the whole line of the west coast of South America,\r\nwhich forms the greatest volcanic chain in the world, from near the\r\nequator for a space of between 2,000 and 3,000 miles southward, has\r\nundergone an upward movement during a late geological period. The\r\nislands on the north-western shores of the Pacific, which form the\r\nsecond greatest volcanic chain, are very imperfectly known; but Luzon,\r\nin the Philippines, and the Loo Choo Islands, have been recently\r\nelevated; and at Kamtschatka[36] there are extensive tertiary beds of\r\nmodern date. Evidence of the same nature, but not very satisfactory,\r\nmay be detected in Northern New Zealand where there are two volcanoes.\r\nThe co-existence in other parts of the world of active volcanoes, with\r\nupraised beds of a modern tertiary origin, will occur to\r\nevery geologist.[37] Nevertheless, until it could be shown that\r\nvolcanoes were inactive, or did not exist in subsiding areas, the\r\nconclusion that their distribution depended on the nature of the\r\nsubterranean movements in progress, would have been hazardous. But now,\r\nviewing the appended map, it may, I think, be considered as almost\r\nestablished, that volcanoes are often (not necessarily always) present\r\nin those areas where the subterranean motive power has lately forced,\r\nor is now forcing outwards, the crust of the earth, but that they are\r\ninvariably absent in those, where the surface has lately subsided or is\r\nstill subsiding.[38]\r\n\r\n [36] At Sedanka, in latitude 58° N. (Von Buch’s “Descrip. des Isles\r\n Canaries,” p. 455). In a forthcoming part, I shall give the evidence\r\n referred to with respect to the elevation of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n [37] During the subterranean disturbances which took place in Chile,\r\n in 1835, I have shown (“Geolog. Trans.” 2nd Ser., vol. v, p. 606) that\r\n at the same moment that a large district was upraised, volcanic matter\r\n burst forth at widely separated points, through both new and old\r\n vents.\r\n\r\n\r\n [38] We may infer from this rule, that in any old deposit, which\r\n contains interstratified beds of erupted matter, there was at the\r\n period, and in the area of its formation, a _tendency_ to an upward\r\n movement in the earth’s surface, and certainly no movement of\r\n subsidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the relations of the areas of subsidence and elevation._—The\r\nimmense surfaces on the map, which, both by our theory and by the plain\r\nevidence of upraised marine remains, have undergone a change of level\r\neither downwards or upwards during a late period, is a most remarkable\r\nfact. The existence of continents shows that the areas have been\r\nimmense which at some period have been upraised; in South America we\r\nmay feel sure, and on the north-western shores of the Indian Ocean we\r\nmay suspect, that this rising is either now actually in progress, or\r\nhas taken place quite recently. By our theory, we may conclude that the\r\nareas are likewise immense which have lately subsided, or, judging from\r\nthe earthquakes occasionally felt and from other appearances, are now\r\nsubsiding. The smallness of the scale of our map should not be\r\noverlooked: each of the squares on it contains (not allowing for the\r\ncurvature of the earth) 810,000 square miles. Look at the space of\r\nocean from near the southern end of the Low Archipelago to the northern\r\nend of the Marshall Archipelago, a length of 4,500 miles, in which, as\r\nfar as is known, every island, except Aurora which lies just without\r\nthe Low Archipelago, is atoll-formed. The eastern and western\r\nboundaries of our map are continents, and they are rising areas: the\r\ncentral spaces of the great Indian and Pacific Oceans, are mostly\r\nsubsiding; between them, north of Australia, lies the most broken land\r\non the globe, and there the rising parts are surrounded and penetrated\r\nby areas of subsidence,[39] so that the prevailing movements now in\r\nprogress, seem to accord with the actual states of surface of the great\r\ndivisions of the world.\r\n\r\n [39] I suspect that the Arru and Timor-laut Islands present an\r\n included small area of subsidence, like that of the China Sea, but I\r\n have not ventured to colour them from my imperfect information, as\r\n given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe blue spaces on the map are nearly all elongated; but it does not\r\nnecessarily follow from this (a caution, for which I am indebted to Mr.\r\nLyell), that the areas of subsidence were likewise elongated; for\r\nthe subsidence of a long, narrow space of the bed of the ocean,\r\nincluding in it a transverse chain of mountains, surmounted by atolls,\r\nwould only be marked on the map by a transverse blue band. But where a\r\nchain of atolls and barrier-reefs lies in an elongated area, between\r\nspaces coloured red, which therefore have remained stationary or have\r\nbeen upraised, this must have resulted either from the area of\r\nsubsidence having originally been elongated (owing to some tendency in\r\nthe earth’s crust thus to subside), or from the subsiding area having\r\noriginally been of an irregular figure, or as broad as long, and having\r\nsince been narrowed by the elevation of neighbouring districts. Thus\r\nthe areas, which subsided during the formation of the great north and\r\nsouth lines of atolls in the Indian Ocean,—of the east and west line of\r\nthe Caroline atolls,—and of the north-west and south-east line of the\r\nbarrier-reefs of New Caledonia and Louisiade, must have originally been\r\nelongated, or if not so, they must have since been made elongated by\r\nelevations, which we know to belong to a recent period.\r\n\r\nI infer from Mr. Hopkins’ researches,[40] that for the formation of a\r\nlong chain of mountains, with few lateral spurs, an area elongated in\r\nthe same direction with the chain, must have been subjected to an\r\nelevatory movement. Mountain-chains, however, when already formed,\r\nalthough running in very different directions, it seems[41] may be\r\nraised together by a widely-acting force: so, perhaps, mountain-chains\r\nmay subside together. Hence, we cannot tell, whether the Caroline and\r\nMarshall Archipelagoes, two groups of atolls running in different\r\ndirections and meeting each other, have been formed by the subsidence\r\nof two areas, or of one large area, including two distinct lines of\r\nmountains. We have, however, in the southern prolongation of the\r\nMariana Islands, probable evidence of a line of recent elevation having\r\nintersected one of recent subsidence. A view of the map will show that,\r\ngenerally, there is a tendency to alternation in the parallel areas\r\nundergoing opposite kinds of movement; as if the sinking of one area\r\nbalanced the rising of another.\r\n\r\n [40] “Researches in Physical Geology,” Transact. Cambridge Phil. Soc.,\r\n vol. vi, part i.\r\n\r\n\r\n [41] For instance in S. America from lat. 34°, for very many degrees\r\n southward there are upraised beds containing recent species of shells,\r\n on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of the continent, and from the\r\n gradual ascent of the land, although with very unequal slopes, on both\r\n sides towards the Cordillera, I think it can hardly be doubted that\r\n the entire width has been upraised in mass within the recent period.\r\n In this case the two W.N.W. and E.S.E. mountain-lines, namely the\r\n Sierra Ventana and the S. Tapalguen, and the great north and south\r\n line of the Cordillera have been together raised. In the West Indies\r\n the N. and S. line of the Eastern Antilles, and the E. and W. line of\r\n Jamaica, appear both to have been upraised within the latest\r\n geological period.\r\n\r\nThe existence in many parts of the world of high table-land, proves\r\nthat large surfaces have been upraised in mass to considerable heights\r\nabove the level of the ocean; although the highest points in almost\r\nevery country consist of upturned strata, or erupted matter: and from\r\nthe immense spaces scattered with atolls, which indicate that land\r\noriginally existed there, although not one pinnacle now remains above\r\nthe level of the sea, we may conclude that wide areas have subsided to\r\nan amount, sufficient to bury not only any formerly existing\r\ntable-land, but even the heights formed by fractured strata, and\r\nerupted matter. The effects produced on the land by the later elevatory\r\nmovements, namely, successively rising cliffs, lines of erosion, and\r\nbeds of literal shells and pebbles, all requiring time for their\r\nproduction, prove that these movements have been very slow; we can,\r\nhowever, infer this with safety, only with respect to the few last\r\nhundred feet of rise. But with reference to the whole vast amount of\r\nsubsidence, necessary to have produced the many atolls widely scattered\r\nover immense spaces, it has already been shown (and it is, perhaps, the\r\nmost interesting conclusion in this volume), that the movements must\r\neither have been uniform and exceedingly slow, or have been effected by\r\nsmall steps, separated from each other by long intervals of time,\r\nduring which the reef-constructing polypifers were able to bring up\r\ntheir solid frameworks to the surface. We have little means of judging\r\nwhether many considerable oscillations of level have generally occurred\r\nduring the elevation of large tracts; but we know, from clear\r\ngeological evidence, that this has frequently taken place; and we have\r\nseen on our map, that some of the same islands have both subsided and\r\nbeen upraised. I conclude, however, that most of the large blue spaces,\r\nhave subsided without many and great elevatory oscillations, because\r\nonly a few upraised atolls have been observed: the supposition that\r\nsuch elevations have taken place, but that the upraised parts have been\r\nworn down by the surf, and thus have escaped observation, is overruled\r\nby the very considerable depth of the lagoons of all the larger atolls;\r\nfor this could not have been the case, if they had suffered repeated\r\nelevations and abrasion. From the comparative observations made in\r\nthese latter pages, we may finally conclude, that the subterranean\r\nchanges which have caused some large areas to rise, and others to\r\nsubside, have acted in a very similar manner.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._—In the three first chapters, the principal kinds of\r\ncoral-reefs were described in detail, and they were found to differ\r\nlittle, as far as relates to the actual surface of the reef. An atoll\r\ndiffers from an encircling barrier-reef only in the absence of land\r\nwithin its central expanse; and a barrier-reef differs from a\r\nfringing-reef, in being placed at a much greater distance from the land\r\nwith reference to the probable inclination of its submarine foundation,\r\nand in the presence of a deep-water lagoon-like space or moat within\r\nthe reef. In the fourth chapter the growing powers of the\r\nreef-constructing polypifers were discussed; and it was shown, that\r\nthey cannot flourish beneath a very limited depth. In accordance with\r\nthis limit, there is no difficulty respecting the foundations on which\r\nfringing-reefs are based; whereas, with barrier-reefs and atolls, there\r\nis a great apparent difficulty on this head; in barrier-reefs from the\r\nimprobability of the rock of the coast or of banks of sediment\r\nextending, in every instance, so far seaward within the required\r\ndepth;—and in atolls, from the immensity of the\r\nspaces over which they are interspersed, and the apparent necessity for\r\nbelieving that they are all supported on mountain-summits, which\r\nalthough rising very near to the surface-level of the sea, in no one\r\ninstance emerge above it. To escape this latter most improbable\r\nadmission, which implies the existence of submarine chains of mountains\r\nof almost the same height, extending over areas of many thousand square\r\nmiles, there is but one alternative; namely, the prolonged subsidence\r\nof the foundations, on which the atolls were primarily based, together\r\nwith the upward growth of the reef-constructing corals. On this view\r\nevery difficulty vanishes; fringing reefs are thus converted into\r\nbarrier-reefs; and barrier-reefs, when encircling islands, are thus\r\nconverted into atolls, the instant the last pinnacle of land sinks\r\nbeneath the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThus the ordinary forms and certain peculiarities in the structure of\r\natolls and barrier-reefs can be explained;—namely, the wall-like\r\nstructure on their inner sides, the basin or ring-like shape both of\r\nthe marginal and central reefs in the Maldiva atolls—the union of some\r\natolls as if by a ribbon—the apparent disseverment of others—and the\r\noccurrence, in atolls as well as in barrier-reefs, of portions of reef,\r\nand of the whole of some reefs, in a dead and submerged state, but\r\nretaining the outline of living reefs. Thus can be explained the\r\nexistence of breaches through barrier-reefs in front of valleys, though\r\nseparated from them by a wide space of deep water; thus, also, the\r\nordinary outline of groups of atolls and the relative forms of the\r\nseparate atolls one to another; thus can be explained the proximity of\r\nthe two kinds of reefs formed during subsidence, and their separation\r\nfrom the spaces where fringing-reefs abound. On searching for other\r\nevidence of the movements supposed by our theory, we find marks of\r\nchange in atolls and in barrier-reefs, and of subterranean disturbances\r\nunder them; but from the nature of things, it is scarcely possible to\r\ndetect any direct proofs of subsidence, although some appearances are\r\nstrongly in favour of it. On the fringed coasts, however, the presence\r\nof upraised marine bodies of a recent epoch, plainly show, that these\r\ncoasts, instead of having remained stationary, which is all that can be\r\ndirectly inferred from our theory, have generally been elevated.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the two great types of structure, namely barrier-reefs\r\nand atolls on the one hand, and fringing-reefs on the other, were laid\r\ndown in colours on our map, a magnificent and harmonious picture of the\r\nmovements, which the crust of the earth has within a late period\r\nundergone, is presented to us. We there see vast areas rising, with\r\nvolcanic matter every now and then bursting forth through the vents or\r\nfissures with which they are traversed. We see other wide spaces slowly\r\nsinking without any volcanic outburst, and we may feel sure, that this\r\nsinking must have been immense in amount as well as in area, thus to\r\nhave buried over the broad face of the ocean every one of those\r\nmountains, above which atolls now stand like monuments, marking the\r\nplace of their former existence. Reflecting how powerful an agent with\r\nrespect to denudation, and consequently to the nature and thickness of\r\nthe deposits in accumulation, the sea must ever be, when acting\r\nfor prolonged periods on the land, during either its slow emergence or\r\nsubsidence; reflecting, also, on the final effects of these movements\r\nin the interchange of land and ocean-water on the climate of the earth,\r\nand on the distribution of organic beings, I may be permitted to hope,\r\nthat the conclusions derived from the study of coral-formations,\r\noriginally attempted merely to explain their peculiar forms, may be\r\nthought worthy of the attention of geologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\nCONTAINING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REEFS AND ISLANDS IN PLATE\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last chapter I stated the principles on which\r\nthe map is coloured. There only remains to be said, that it is an exact\r\ncopy of one by M. C. Gressier, published by the Dépôt Général de la\r\nMarine, in 1835. The names have been altered into English, and the\r\nlongitude has been reduced to that of Greenwich. The colours were first\r\nlaid down on accurate charts, on a large scale. The data, on which the\r\nvolcanoes historically known to have been in action, have been marked\r\nwith vermillion, were given in a note to the last chapter. I will\r\ncommence my description on the eastern side of the map, and will\r\ndescribe each group of islands consecutively, proceeding westward\r\nacross the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but ending with the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe WESTERN SHORES OF AMERICA appear to be entirely without\r\ncoral-reefs; south of the equator the survey of the _Beagle_, and north\r\nof it, the published charts show that this is the case. Even in the Bay\r\nof _Panama_, where corals flourish, there are no true coral-reefs, as I\r\nhave been informed by Mr. Lloyd. There are no coral-reefs in the\r\n_Galapagos_ Archipelago, as I know from personal inspection; and I\r\nbelieve there are none on the _ Cocos, Revilla-gigedo_, and other\r\nneighbouring islands. _ Clipperton_ rock, 10° N., 109° W., has lately\r\nbeen surveyed by Captain Belcher; in form it is like the crater of a\r\nvolcano. From a drawing appended to the MS. plan in the Admiralty, it\r\nevidently is not an atoll. The eastern parts of the Pacific present an\r\nenormous area, without any islands, except _E_, and _Sala_, and _Gomez_\r\nIslands, which do not appear to be surrounded by reefs.\r\n\r\nThe LOW ARCHIPELAGO.—This group consists of about eighty atolls: it\r\nwill be quite superfluous to refer to descriptions of each. In\r\nD’Urville and Lottin’s chart, one island (_Wolchonsky_) is written with\r\na capital letter, signifying, as explained in a former chapter, that it\r\nis a high island; but this must be a mistake, as the original chart by\r\nBellinghausen shows that it is a true atoll. Captain Beechey says of\r\nthe thirty-two groups which he examined (of the greater number of which\r\nI have seen beautiful MS. charts in the Admiralty), that twenty-nine\r\nnow contain lagoons, and he believes the other three originally did.\r\nBellinghausen (see an account of his Russian voyage, in the “Biblioth.\r\ndes Voyages,” 1834, p. 443) says, that the seventeen islands which he\r\ndiscovered resembled each other in structure, and he has given charts\r\non a large scale of all of them. Kotzebue has given plans of several;\r\nCook and Bligh mention others; a few were seen during the voyage of the\r\n_Beagle_; and notices of other atolls are scattered through several\r\npublications. The _ Actæon_ group in this archipelago has lately been\r\ndiscovered (_Geograph. Journ._, vol. vii, p. 454); it consists of three\r\nsmall and low islets, one of which has a lagoon. Another lagoon-island\r\nhas been discovered (_Naut. Mag._, 1839, p. 770), in 22° 4′ S., and\r\n136° 20′ W. Towards the S.E. part of the group, there are some islands\r\nof different formation: _ Elizabeth_ Island is described by Beechey (p.\r\n46, 4to ed.) as fringed by reefs, at the distance of between two and\r\nthree hundred yards; coloured red. _Pitcairn_ Island, in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, according to the same authority, has no reefs of any\r\nkind, although numerous pieces of coral are thrown up on the beach; the\r\nsea close to its shore is very deep (see “Zool. of Beechey’s Voyage,”\r\np. 164); it is left uncoloured. _Gambier_ Islands (see Plate I Fig. 8),\r\nare encircled by a barrier-reef; the greatest depth within is\r\nthirty-eight fathoms; coloured pale blue. _Aurora_ Island, which lies\r\nN.E. of Tahiti close to the large space coloured dark blue in the map,\r\nhas been already described in a note (), on the authority of Mr.\r\nCouthouy; it is an upraised atoll, but as it does not appear to be\r\nfringed by living reefs, it is left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe SOCIETY Arch. is separated by a narrow space from the Low\r\nArchipelago; and in their parallel direction they manifest some\r\nrelation to each other. I have already described the general character\r\nof the reefs of these fine encircled islands. In the “Atlas of the\r\n_Coquille’s_ Voyage” there is a good general chart of the group, and\r\nseparate plans of some of the islands. _ Tahiti_, the largest island in\r\nthe group, is almost surrounded, as seen in Cook’s chart, by a reef\r\nfrom half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore, with from ten to\r\nthirty fathoms within it. Some considerable submerged reefs lying\r\nparallel to the shore, with a broad and deep space within, have lately\r\nbeen discovered (_Naut. Mag._, 1836, p. 264) on the N.E. coast of the\r\nisland, where none are laid down by Cook. At _Eimeo_ the reef “which\r\nlike a ring surrounds it, is in some places one or two miles distant\r\nfrom the shore, in others united to the beach” (Ellis, “Polynesian\r\nResearches,” vol. i, p. 18, 12mo edition). Cook found deep water\r\n(twenty fathoms) in some of the harbours within the reef. Mr. Couthouy,\r\nhowever, states (“Remarks,” p. 45) that both at Tahiti and Eimeo, the\r\nspace between the barrier-reef and the shore, has been almost filled\r\nup,—“a nearly continuous fringing-reef surrounding the island, and\r\nvarying from a few yards to rather more than a mile in width, the\r\nlagoons merely forming canals between this and the sea-reef,” that is\r\nthe barrier-reef. _Tapamanoa_ is surrounded by a reef at a considerable\r\ndistance from the shore; from the island being small it is breached, as\r\nI am informed by the Rev. W.\r\nEllis, only by a narrow and crooked boat channel. This is the lowest\r\nisland in the group, its height probably not exceeding 500 feet. A\r\nlittle way north of Tahiti, the low coral-islets of _ Teturoa_ are\r\nsituated; from the description of them given me by the Rev. J. Williams\r\n(the author of the “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise”), I should have\r\nthought they had formed a small atoll, and likewise from the\r\ndescription given by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G. Bennett (“Journal of\r\nVoyage and Travels,” vol. i, p. 183), who say that ten low coral-islets\r\n“are comprehended within one general reef, and separated from each\r\nother by interjacent lagoons;” but as Mr. Stutchbury (_West of England\r\nJournal_, vol. i, p. 54) describes it as consisting of a mere narrow\r\nridge, I have left it uncoloured. _Maitea_, eastward of the group, is\r\nclassed by Forster as a high encircled island; but from the account\r\ngiven by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G. Bennett (vol. i, p. 57) it appears\r\nto be an exceedingly abrupt cone, rising from the sea without any reef;\r\nI have left it uncoloured. It would be superfluous to describe the\r\nnorthern islands in this group, as they may be well seen in the chart\r\naccompanying the 4to edition of Cook’s “Voyages,” and in the “Atlas of\r\nthe _Coquille’s_ Voyage.” _Maurua_ is the only one of the northern\r\nislands, in which the water within the reef is not deep, being only\r\nfour and a half fathoms; but the great width of the reef, stretching\r\nthree miles and a half southward of the land (which is represented in\r\nthe drawing in the “Atlas of the _ Coquille’s_ Voyage” as descending\r\nabruptly to the water) shows, on the principle explained in the\r\nbeginning of the last chapter, that it belongs to the barrier class. I\r\nmay here mention, from information communicated to me by the Rev. W.\r\nEllis, that on the N.E. side of _Huaheine_ there is a bank of sand,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile wide, extending parallel to the shore, and\r\nseparated from it by an extensive and deep lagoon; this bank of sand\r\nrests on coral-rock, and undoubtedly was originally a living reef.\r\nNorth of Bolabola lies the atoll of _Toubai_ (Motou-iti of the\r\n“_Coquille’s_ Atlas”) which is coloured dark blue; the other islands,\r\nsurrounded by barrier-reefs, are pale blue; three of them are\r\nrepresented in Figs 3, 4, and 5, in Plate I. There are three low\r\ncoral-groups lying a little E. of the Society Archipelago, and almost\r\nforming part of it, namely _ Bellinghausen_, which is said by Kotzebue\r\n(“Second Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 255), to be a lagoon-island; _Mopeha_,\r\nwhich, from Cook’s description (“Second Voyage,” book iii, chap. i), no\r\ndoubt is an atoll; and the _Scilly_ Islands, which are said by Wallis\r\n(“Voyage,” chap. ix) to form a _group_ of _low_ islets and shoals, and,\r\ntherefore, probably, they compose an atoll: the two former have been\r\ncoloured blue, but not the latter.\r\n\r\nMENDANA OR MARQUESAS Group.—These islands are entirely without reefs,\r\nas may be seen in Krusenstern’s Atlas, making a remarkable contrast\r\nwith the adjacent group of the Society Islands. Mr. F. D. Bennett has\r\ngiven some account of this group, in the seventh volume of the\r\n_Geograph. Journ._ He informs me that all the islands have the same\r\ngeneral character, and that the water is very deep close to their\r\nshores. He visited three of them, namely, _Dominicana, Christiana,_ and\r\n_Roapoa_; their beaches are strewed with rounded masses of coral, and\r\nalthough no regular reefs exist, yet the shore is in many places lined\r\nby coral-rock, so that a boat grounds on this formation. Hence these\r\nislands ought probably to come within the class of fringed islands and\r\nbe coloured red; but as I am determined to err on the cautious side, I\r\nhave left them uncoloured.\r\n\r\nCOOK or HARVEY and AUSTRAL ISLAND.—_Palmerston_ Island is minutely\r\ndescribed as an atoll by Captain Cook during his voyage in 1774;\r\ncoloured blue. _Aitutaki_ was partially surveyed by the _ Beagle_ (see\r\nmap accompanying “Voyages of _Adventure_ and _Beagle_”); the land is\r\nhilly, sloping gently to the beach; the highest point is 360 feet; on\r\nthe southern side the reef projects five miles from the land: off this\r\npoint the _Beagle_ found no bottom with 270 fathoms: the reef is\r\nsurmounted by many low coral-islets. Although within the reef the water\r\nis exceedingly shallow, not being more than a few feet deep, as I am\r\ninformed by the Rev. J. Williams, nevertheless, from the great\r\nextension of this reef into a profoundly deep ocean, this island\r\nprobably belongs, on the principle lately adverted to, to the barrier\r\nclass, and I have coloured it pale blue; although with much\r\nhesitation.—_Manouai_ or _Harvey_ Island. The highest point is about\r\nfifty feet: the Rev. J. Williams informs me that the reef here,\r\nalthough it lies far from the shore, is less distant than at Aitutaki,\r\nbut the water within the reef is rather deeper: I have also coloured\r\nthis pale blue with many doubts.—Round _Mitiaro_ Island, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Williams, the reef is attached to the shore; coloured\r\nred.—_Mauki_ or Maouti; the reef round this island (under the name of\r\nParry Island, in the “Voyage of H.M.S. _ Blonde_,” p. 209) is described\r\nas a coral-flat, only fifty yards wide, and two feet under water. This\r\nstatement has been corroborated by Mr. Williams, who calls the reef\r\nattached; coloured red.—_Aitu_, or Wateeo; a moderately elevated hilly\r\nisland, like the others of this group. The reef is described in Cook’s\r\n“Voyage,” as attached to the shore, and about one hundred yards wide;\r\ncoloured red.—_Fenoua-iti_; Cook describes this island as very low, not\r\nmore than six or seven feet high (vol. i, book ii, chap. iii, 1777); in\r\nthe chart published in the “_Coquille’s_ Atlas,” a reef is engraved\r\nclose to the shore: this island is not mentioned in the list given by\r\nMr. Williams (page 16) in the “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise;”\r\nnature doubtful. As it is so near Atiu, it has been unavoidably\r\ncoloured red.—_Rarotonga_; Mr. Williams informs me that it is a lofty\r\nbasaltic island with an attached reef; coloured red.—There are three\r\nislands, _Rourouti, Roxburgh_, and _Hull_, of which I have not been\r\nable to obtain any account, and have left them uncoloured. Hull Island,\r\nin the French chart, is written with small letters as being\r\nlow.—_Mangaia_; height about three hundred feet; “the surrounding reef\r\njoins the shore” (Williams, “Narrative,” p. 18); coloured\r\nred.—_Rimetara_; Mr. Williams informs me that the reef is rather close\r\nto the shore; but, from information given me by Mr. Ellis, the reef\r\ndoes not appear to be quite so closely attached to it as in the\r\nforegoing cases: the island is about three hundred feet high (_Naut.\r\nMag._, 1839, p. 738); coloured red.—_Rurutu_; Mr. Williams and Mr.\r\nEllis inform me that this island has an attached reef; coloured red. It\r\nis described by Cook under the name of Oheteroa: he says it is not\r\nsurrounded, like the neighbouring islands by a reef; he must have meant\r\na distant reef.—_Toubouai_; in Cook’s chart (“Second Voyage,” vol. ii,\r\np. 2) the reef is laid down in part one mile, and in part two miles\r\nfrom the shore. Mr. Ellis (“Polynes. Res.” vol. iii, p. 381) says the\r\nlow land round the base of the island is very extensive; and this\r\ngentleman informs me that the water within the reef appears deep;\r\ncoloured blue.—_Raivaivai_, or Vivitao; Mr. Williams informs me that\r\nthe reef is here distant: Mr. Ellis, however, says that this is\r\ncertainly not the case on one side of the island; and he believes that\r\nthe water within the reef is not deep; hence I have left it\r\nuncoloured.—_Lancaster_ Reef, described in _ Naut. Mag._, 1833 (p.\r\n693), as an extensive crescent-formed coral-reef. I have not coloured\r\nit.—_Rapa_, or Oparree; from the accounts given of it by Ellis and\r\nVancouver, there does not appear to be any reef.—_I. de Bass_ is an\r\nadjoining island, of which I cannot find any account.—_Kemin_ Island;\r\nKrusenstern seems hardly to know its position, and gives no further\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nISLANDS BETWEEN _the Low and Gilbert Archipelagoes._\r\n\r\n_Caroline_ Island (10° S., 150 deg W.) is described by Mr. F. D.\r\nBennett (_Geograph. Journ._, vol. vii, p. 225) as containing a fine\r\nlagoon; coloured blue.—_Flint_ Island (11° S., 151° W.); Krusenstern\r\nbelieves that it is the same with Peregrino, which is described by\r\nQuiros (Burney’s “Chron. Hist.,” vol. ii, p. 283) as “a cluster of\r\nsmall islands connected by a reef, and forming a lagoon in the middle;”\r\ncoloured blue.—_Wostock_ is an island a little more than half a mile in\r\ndiameter, and apparently quite flat and low, and was discovered by\r\nBellinghausen; it is situated a little west of Caroline Island, but it\r\nis not placed on the French charts; I have not coloured it, although I\r\nentertain little doubt from the chart of Bellinghausen, that it\r\noriginally contained a small lagoon.—_Penrhyn_ Island (9° S., 158° W.);\r\na plan of it in the “Atlas of the First Voyage” of Kotzebue, shows that\r\nit is an atoll; blue.—_Slarbuck_ Island (5° S., 156° W.) is described\r\nin Byron’s “Voyage in the _Blonde_” (p. 206) as formed of a flat\r\ncoral-rock, with no trees; the height not given; not coloured.—_Malden_\r\nIsland (4° S., 154° W.); in the same voyage (p. 205) this island is\r\nsaid to be of coral formation, and no part above forty feet high; I\r\nhave not ventured to colour it, although, from being of\r\ncoral-formation, it is probably fringed; in which case it should be\r\nred.—_Jarvis_, or _Bunker_ Island (0° 20′ S., 160° W.) is described by\r\nMr. F. D. Bennett (_Geograph. Journ._, vol. vii, p. 227) as a narrow,\r\nlow strip of coral-formation; not coloured.—_Brook_, is a small low\r\nisland between the two latter; the position, and perhaps even the\r\nexistence of it is doubtful; not coloured.—_Pescado_ and _Humphrey_\r\nIslands; I can find out nothing about these islands, except that the\r\nlatter appears to be small and low; not coloured.—_Rearson_, or Grand\r\nDuke Alexander’s (10° S., 161° W.); an atoll, of which a plan is given\r\nby Bellinghausen; blue.—_Souvoroff_ Islands (13° S., 163° W.); Admiral\r\nKrusenstern, in the most obliging manner, obtained for me an account of\r\nthese islands from Admiral Lazareff, who discovered them. They consist\r\nof five very low\r\nislands of coral-formation, two of which are connected by a reef, with\r\ndeep water close to it. They do not surround a lagoon, but are so\r\nplaced that a line drawn through them includes an oval space, part of\r\nwhich is shallow; these islets, therefore, probably once (as is the\r\ncase with some of the islands in the Caroline Archipelago) formed a\r\nsingle atoll; but I have not coloured them.—_Danger_ Island (10° S.,\r\n166° W.); described as low by Commodore Byron, and more lately surveyed\r\nby Bellinghausen; it is a small atoll with three islets on it;\r\nblue.—_Clarence_ Island (9° S., 172° W.); discovered in the _Pandora_\r\n(G. Hamilton’s “Voyage,” p. 75): it is said, “in running along the\r\nland, we saw several canoes crossing the _lagoons_;” as this island is\r\nin the close vicinity of other low islands, and as it is said, that the\r\nnatives make reservoirs of water in old cocoa-nut trees (which shows\r\nthe nature of the land), I have no doubt it is an atoll, and have\r\ncoloured it blue. _York_ Island (8° S., 172° W.) is described by\r\nCommodore Byron (chap. x of his “Voyage”) as an atoll; blue.—_Sydney_\r\nIsland (4° S., 172° W.) is about three miles in diameter, with its\r\ninterior occupied by a lagoon (Captain Tromelin, “Annal. Marit.” 1829,\r\np. 297); blue.—_Phoenix_ Island (4° S., 171° W.) is nearly circular,\r\nlow, sandy, not more than two miles in diameter, and very steep outside\r\n(Tromelin, “Annal. Marit.” 1829, p. 297); it may be inferred that this\r\nisland originally contained a lagoon, but I have not coloured it.—_New\r\nNantucket_ (0° 15′ N., 174° W.). From the French chart it must be a low\r\nisland; I can find nothing more about it or about _Mary_ Island; both\r\nuncoloured.—_Gardner_ Island (5° S., 174° W.) from its position is\r\ncertainly the same as _Kemin_ Island described (Krusenstern, p. 435,\r\nAppen. to Mem., published 1827) as having a lagoon in its centre; blue.\r\n\r\nISLANDS SOUTH _of the Sandwich Archipelago._\r\n\r\n_Christmas_ Island (2° N., 157° W.). Captain Cook, in his “Third\r\nVoyage” (vol. ii, chap. x), has given a detailed account of this atoll.\r\nThe breadth of the islets on the reef is unusually great, and the sea\r\nnear it does not deepen so suddenly as is generally the case. It has\r\nmore lately been visited by Mr. F. D. Bennett (_Geograph. Journ._, vol.\r\nvii, p. 226); and he assures me that it is low and of coral-formation:\r\nI particularly mention this, because it is engraved with a capital\r\nletter, signifying a high island, in D’Urville and Lottin’s chart. Mr.\r\nCouthouy, also, has given some account of it (“Remarks,” p. 46) from\r\nthe Hawaiian “Spectator”; he believes it has lately undergone a small\r\nelevation, but his evidence does not appear to me satisfactory; the\r\ndeepest part of the lagoon is said to be only ten feet; nevertheless, I\r\nhave coloured it blue.—_Fanning_ Island (4° N., 158° W.) according to\r\nCaptain Tromelin (“Ann. Maritim.,” 1829, p. 283), is an atoll: his\r\naccount as observed by Krusenstern, differs from that given in\r\nFanning’s “Voyage” (p. 224), which, however, is far from clear;\r\ncoloured blue.—_Washington_ Island (4° N., 159° W.) is engraved as a\r\nlow island in D’Urville’s chart, but is described by Fanning (p. 226)\r\nas having a much greater elevation than Fanning Island, and hence I\r\npresume it is not an atoll; not coloured.—_Palmyra_ Island (6° N., 162°\r\nW.) is an atoll divided into two parts (Krusenstern’s “Mem. Suppl.,” p.\r\n50, also Fanning’s “Voyage,” p. 233); blue.—_Smyth’s_ or Johnston’s\r\nIslands (17° N., 170° W.). Captain Smyth, R.N., has had the kindness to\r\ninform me that they consist of two very low, small islands, with a\r\ndangerous reef off the east end of them. Captain Smyth does not\r\nrecollect whether these islets, together with the reef, surrounded a\r\nlagoon; uncoloured.\r\n\r\nSANDWICH ARCHIPELAGO.—_Hawaii_; in the chart in Freycinet’s “Atlas,”\r\nsmall portions of the coast are fringed by reefs; and in the\r\naccompanying “Hydrog. Memoir,” reefs are mentioned in several places,\r\nand the coral is said to injure the cables. On one side of the islet of\r\nKohaihai there is a bank of sand and coral with five feet water on it,\r\nrunning parallel to the shore, and leaving a channel of about fifteen\r\nfeet deep within. I have coloured this island red, but it is very much\r\nless perfectly fringed than others of the group.—_Maui_; in Freycinet’s\r\nchart of the anchorage of Raheina, two or three miles of coast are seen\r\nto be fringed; and in the “Hydrog. Memoir,” “banks of coral along\r\nshore” are spoken of. Mr. F. D. Bennett informs me that the reefs, on\r\nan average, extend about a quarter of a mile from the beach; the land\r\nis not very steep, and outside the reefs the sea does not become deep\r\nvery suddenly; coloured red.—_Morotoi_, I presume, is fringed:\r\nFreycinet speaks of the breakers extending along the shore at a little\r\ndistance from it. From the chart, I believe it is fringed; coloured\r\nred.—_Oahu_; Freycinet, in his “Hydrog. Memoir,” mentions some of the\r\nreefs. Mr. F. D. Bennett informs me that the shore is skirted for forty\r\nor fifty miles in length. There is even a harbour for ships formed by\r\nthe reefs, but it is at the mouth of a valley; red.—_Atooi_, in La\r\nPeyrouse’s charts, is represented as fringed by a reef, in the same\r\nmanner as Oahu and Morotoi; and this, as I have been informed by Mr.\r\nEllis, on part at least of the shore, is of coral-formation: the reef\r\ndoes not leave a deep channel within; red.—_Oneehow_; Mr. Ellis\r\nbelieves that this island is also fringed by a coral-reef: considering\r\nits close proximity to the other islands, I have ventured to colour it\r\nred. I have in vain consulted the works of Cook, Vancouver, La\r\nPeyrouse, and Lisiansky, for any satisfactory account of the small\r\nislands and reefs, which lie scattered in a N.W. line prolonged from\r\nthe Sandwich group, and hence have left them uncoloured, with one\r\nexception; for I am indebted to Mr. F. D. Bennett for informing me of\r\nan atoll-formed reef, in latitude 28° 22′, longitude 178° 30′ W., on\r\nwhich the _ Gledstanes_ was wrecked in 1837. It is apparently of large\r\nsize, and extends in a N.W. and S.E. line: very few islets have been\r\nformed on it. The lagoon seems to be shallow; at least, the deepest\r\npart which was surveyed was only three fathoms. Mr. Couthouy\r\n(“Remarks,” p. 38) describes this island under the name of _ Ocean_\r\nisland. Considerable doubts should be entertained regarding the nature\r\nof a reef of this kind, with a very shallow lagoon, and standing far\r\nfrom any other atoll, on account of the possibility of a crater or flat\r\nbank of rock lying at the proper depth beneath the surface of the\r\nwater, thus affording a foundation for a ring-formed coral-reef. I\r\nhave, however, thought myself compelled, from its large size and\r\nsymmetrical outline, to colour it blue.\r\n\r\nSAMOA or NAVIGATOR GROUP.—Kotzebue, in his “Second Voyage,”\r\ncontrasts the structure of these islands with many others in the\r\nPacific, in not being furnished with harbours for ships, formed by\r\ndistant coral-reefs. The Rev. J. Williams, however, informs me, that\r\ncoral-reefs do occur in irregular patches on the shores of these\r\nislands; but that they do not form a continuous band, as round Mangaia,\r\nand other such perfect cases of fringed islands. From the charts\r\naccompanying La Peyrouse’s “Voyage,” it appears that the north shore of\r\n_Savaii, Maouna, Orosenga_, and _ Manua_, are fringed by reefs. La\r\nPeyrouse, speaking of Maouna (p. 126), says that the coral-reef\r\nsurrounding its shores, almost touches the beach; and is breached in\r\nfront of the little coves and streams, forming passages for canoes, and\r\nprobably even for boats. Further on (p. 159), he extends the same\r\nobservation to all the islands which he visited. Mr. Williams in his\r\n“Narrative,” speaks of a reef going round a small island attached to\r\n_Oyolava_, and returning again to it: all these islands have been\r\ncoloured red.—A chart of _Rose_ Island, at the extreme west end of the\r\ngroup, is given by Freycinet, from which I should have thought that it\r\nhad been an atoll; but according to Mr. Couthouy (“Remarks,” p. 43), it\r\nconsists of a reef, only a league in circuit, surmounted by a very few\r\nlow islets; the lagoon is very shallow, and is strewed with numerous\r\nlarge boulders of volcanic rock. This island, therefore, probably\r\nconsists of a bank of rock, a few feet submerged, with the outer margin\r\nof its upper surface fringed with reefs; hence it cannot be properly\r\nclassed with atolls, in which the foundations are always supposed to\r\nlie at a depth, greater than that at which the reef-constructing\r\npolypifers can live; not coloured.\r\n\r\n_Beveridge_ Reef, 20° S., 167° W., is described in the _Naut. Mag._\r\n(May 1833, p. 442) as ten miles long in a N. and S. line, and eight\r\nwide; “in the inside of the reef there appears deep water;” there is a\r\npassage near the S.W. corner: this therefore seems to be a submerged\r\natoll, and is coloured blue.\r\n\r\n_Savage_ Island, 19° S., 170° W., has been described by Cook and\r\nForster. The younger Forster (vol. ii, p. 163) says it is about forty\r\nfeet high: he suspects that it contains a low plain, which formerly was\r\nthe lagoon. The Rev. J. Williams informs me that the reef fringing its\r\nshores, resembles that round Mangaia; coloured red.\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY ARCHIPELAGO.—_Pylstaart_ Island. Judging from the chart in\r\nFreycinet’s “Atlas,” I should have supposed that it had been regularly\r\nfringed; but as nothing is said in the “Hydrog. Memoir” (or in the\r\n“Voyage” of Tasman, the discoverer) about coral-reefs, I have left it\r\nuncoloured.—_Tongatabou_: In the “Atlas of the Voyage of the\r\n_Astrolabe_,” the whole south side of the island is represented as\r\nnarrowly fringed by the same reef which forms an extensive platform on\r\nthe northern side. The origin of this latter reef, which might have\r\nbeen mistaken for a barrier-reef, has already been attempted to be\r\nexplained, when giving the proofs of the recent elevation of this\r\nisland.—In Cook’s charts the little outlying island also of _Eoaigee_,\r\nis represented as fringed; coloured red.—_Eoua._ I cannot make out from\r\nCaptain Cook’s charts and descriptions, that this island has any reef,\r\nalthough the bottom of the neighbouring sea seems to be corally, and\r\nthe island itself is formed of coral-rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nForster, however, distinctly (“Observations,” p. 14) classes it with\r\nhigh islands having reefs, but it certainly is not encircled by a\r\nbarrier-reef and the younger Forster (“Voyage,” vol. i, p. 426) says,\r\nthat “a bed of coral-rocks surrounded the coast towards the\r\nlanding-place.” I have therefore classed it with the fringed islands\r\nand coloured it red. The several islands lying N.W. of Tongatabou,\r\nnamely _Anamouka, Komango, Kotou, Lefouga, Foa_, etc., are seen in\r\nCaptain Cook’s chart to be fringed by reefs, in several of them are\r\nconnected together. From the various statements in the first volume of\r\nCook’s “Third Voyage,” and especially in the fourth and sixth chapters,\r\nit appears that these reefs are of coral-formation, and certainly do\r\nnot belong to the barrier class; coloured red.—_Toufoa and Kao_,\r\nforming the western part of the group, according to Forster have no\r\nreefs; the former is an active volcano.—_Vavao._ There is a chart of\r\nthis singularly formed island, by Espinoza: according to Mr. Williams\r\nit consists of coral-rock: the Chevalier Dillon informs me that it is\r\nnot fringed; not coloured. Nor are the islands of _Latte_ and\r\n_Amargura_, for I have not seen plans on a large scale of them, and do\r\nnot know whether they are fringed.\r\n\r\n_Niouha_, 16° S., 174° W., or _Keppel_ Island of Wallis, or _Cocos_\r\nIsland. From a view and chart of this island given in Wallis’s “Voyage”\r\n(4to ed.) it is evidently encircled by a reef; coloured blue: it is\r\nhowever remarkable that _Boscawen_ Island, immediately adjoining, has\r\nno reef of any kind; uncoloured.\r\n\r\n_Wallis_ Island, 13° S., 176° W., a chart and view of this island in\r\nWallis’s “Voyage” (4to ed.) shows that it is encircled. A view of it in\r\nthe _Naut. Mag._, July 1833, p. 376, shows the same fact; blue.\r\n\r\n_Alloufatou_, or _Horn_ Island, _Onouafu_, or _ Proby_ Island, and\r\n_Hunter_ Islands, lie between the Navigator and Fidji groups. I can\r\nfind no distinct accounts of them.\r\n\r\nFIDJI or VITI GROUP.—The best chart of the numerous islands of this\r\ngroup, will be found in the “Atlas of the _ Astrolabe’s_ Voyage.” From\r\nthis, and from the description given in the “Hydrog. Memoir,”\r\naccompanying it, it appears that many of these islands are bold and\r\nmountainous, rising to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. Most\r\nof the islands are surrounded by reefs, lying far from the land, and\r\noutside of which the ocean appears very deep. The _Astrolabe_ sounded\r\nwith ninety fathoms in several places about a mile from the reefs, and\r\nfound no bottom. Although the depth within the reef is not laid down,\r\nit is evident from several expressions, that Captain D’Urville believes\r\nthat ships could anchor within, if passages existed through the outer\r\nbarriers. The Chevallier Dillon informs me that this is the case: hence\r\nI have coloured this group blue. In the S.E. part lies _ Batoa_, or\r\n_Turtle_ Island of Cook (“Second Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 23, and chart,\r\n4to ed.) surrounded by a coral-reef, “which in some places extends two\r\nmiles from the shore;” within the reef the water appears to be deep,\r\nand outside it is unfathomable; coloured pale blue. At the distance of\r\na few miles, Captain Cook (_Ibid_., p. 24) found a circular coral-reef,\r\nfour or five leagues in circuit, with deep water within; “in short, the\r\nbank wants only a few little islets to make it exactly like one of the\r\nhalf-drowned isles so\r\noften mentioned,”—namely, atolls. South of Batoa, lies the high island\r\nof _Ono_, which appears in Bellinghausen’s “Atlas” to be encircled; as\r\ndo some other small islands to the south; coloured pale blue; near Ono,\r\nthere is an annular reef, quite similar to the one just described in\r\nthe words of Captain Cook; coloured dark blue.\r\n\r\n_Rotoumah_, 13° S., 179° E.—From the chart in Duperrey’s “Atlas,” I\r\nthought this island was encircled, and had coloured it blue, but the\r\nChevallier Dillon assures me that the reef is only a shore or fringing\r\none; red.\r\n\r\n_Independence_ Island, 10° S., 179° E., is described by Mr. G. Bennett,\r\n(_United Service Journ._, 1831, part ii, p. 197) as a low island of\r\ncoral-formation, it is small, and does not appear to contain a lagoon,\r\nalthough an opening through the reef is referred to. A lagoon probably\r\nonce existed, and has since been filled up; left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nELLICE GROUP.—_Oscar, Peyster_, and _Ellice_ Islands are figured in\r\nArrowsmith’s “Chart of the Pacific” (corrected to 1832) as atolls, and\r\nare said to be very low; blue.—_Nederlandisch_ Island. I am greatly\r\nindebted to the kindness of Admiral Krusenstern, for sending me the\r\noriginal documents concerning this island. From the plans given by\r\nCaptains Eeg and Khremtshenko, and from the detailed account given by\r\nthe former, it appears that it is a narrow coral-island, about two\r\nmiles long, containing a small lagoon. The sea is very deep close to\r\nthe shore, which is fronted by sharp coral-rocks. Captain Eeg compares\r\nthe lagoon with that of other coral-islands; and he distinctly says,\r\nthe land is “very low.” I have therefore coloured it blue. Admiral\r\nKrusenstern (“Memoir on the Pacific,” Append., 1835) states that its\r\nshores are eighty feet high; this probably arose from the height of the\r\ncocoa-nut trees, with which it is covered, being mistaken for\r\nland.—_Gran Cocal_ is said in Krusenstern’s “Memoir,” to be low, and to\r\nbe surrounded by a reef; it is small, and therefore probably once\r\ncontained a lagoon; uncoloured.—_St. Augustin._ From a chart and view\r\nof it, given in the “Atlas of the _Coquille’s_ Voyage,” it appears to\r\nbe a small atoll, with its lagoon partly filled up; coloured blue.\r\n\r\nGILBERT GROUP.—The chart of this group, given in the “Atlas of the\r\n_Coquille’s_ Voyage,” at once shows that it is composed of ten well\r\ncharacterised atolls. In D’Urville and Lottin’s chart, _Sydenham_ is\r\nwritten with a capital letter, signifying that it is high; but this\r\ncertainly is not the case, for it is a perfectly characterised atoll,\r\nand a sketch, showing how low it is, is given in the “_Coquille’s_\r\nAtlas.” Some narrow strip-like reefs project from the southern side of\r\n_Drummond_ atoll, and render it irregular. The southern island of the\r\ngroup is called _Chase_ (in some charts, _ Rotches_); of this I can\r\nfind no account, but Mr. F. D. Bennett discovered (_Geograph. Journ._,\r\nvol. vii, p. 229), a low extensive island in nearly the same latitude,\r\nabout three degrees westward of the longitude assigned to Rotches, but\r\nvery probably it is the same island. Mr. Bennett informs me that the\r\nman at the masthead reported an appearance of lagoon-water in the\r\ncentre; and, therefore, considering its position, I have coloured it\r\nblue.—_Pitt_ Island, at the extreme northern point of the group, is\r\nleft uncoloured, as its exact position and nature\r\nis not known.—_Byron_ Island, which lies a little to the eastward, does\r\nnot appear to have been visited since Commodore Byron’s voyage, and it\r\nwas then seen only from a distance of eighteen miles; it is said to be\r\nlow; uncoloured.\r\n\r\n_Ocean, Pleasant_, and _Atlantic_ Islands all lie considerably to the\r\nwest of the Gilbert group: I have been unable to find any distinct\r\naccount of them. Ocean Island is written with small letters in the\r\nFrench chart, but in Krusenstern’s “Memoir” it is said to be high.\r\n\r\nMARSHALL GROUP.—We are well acquainted with this group from the\r\nexcellent charts of the separate islands, made during the two voyages\r\nof Kotzebue: a reduced one of the whole group may be easily seen in\r\nKrusenstern’s “Atlas,” and in Kotzebue’s “Second Voyage.” The group\r\nconsists (with the exception of two _little_ islands which probably\r\nhave had their lagoon filled up) of a double row of twenty-three large\r\nand well-characterised atolls, from the examination of which Chamisso\r\nhas given us his well-known account of coral-formations. I include\r\n_Gaspar Rico_, or _Cornwallis_ Island in this group, which is described\r\nby Chamisso (Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” vol. iii, p. 179) “as a low\r\nsickle-formed group, with mould only on the windward side.” Gaspard\r\nIsland is considered by some geographers as a distinct island lying\r\nN.E. of the group, but it is not entered in the chart by Krusenstern;\r\nleft uncoloured. In the S.W. part of this group lies _Baring_ Island,\r\nof which little is known (see Krusenstern’s “Appendix,” 1835, p. 149).\r\nI have left it uncoloured; but _Boston_ Island I have coloured blue, as\r\nit is described (_Ibid_.) as consisting of fourteen small islands,\r\nwhich, no doubt, enclose a lagoon, as represented in a chart in the\r\n“‘Coquille’s’ Atlas.”—Two islands, _Aur Kawen_ and _Gaspar Rico_, are\r\nwritten in the French chart with capital letters; but this is an error,\r\nfor from the account given by Chamisso in Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,”\r\nthey are certainly low. The nature, position, and even existence, of\r\nthe shoals and small islands north of the Marshall group, are doubtful.\r\n\r\nNEW HEBRIDES.—Any chart, on even a small scale, of these islands, will\r\nshow that their shores are almost without reefs, presenting a\r\nremarkable contrast with those of New Caledonia on the one hand, and\r\nthe Fidji group on the other. Nevertheless, I have been assured by Mr.\r\nG. Bennett, that coral grows vigorously on their shores; as indeed,\r\nwill be further shown in some of the following notices. As, therefore,\r\nthese islands are not encircled, and as coral grows vigorously on their\r\nshores, we might almost conclude, without further evidence, that they\r\nwere fringed, and hence I have applied the red colour with rather\r\ngreater freedom than in other instances.—_Matthew’s Rock_, an active\r\nvolcano, some way south of the group (of which a plan is given in the\r\n“Atlas of the _Astrolabe’s_ Voyage”) does not appear to have reefs of\r\nany kind about it.—_Annatom_, the southernmost of the Hebrides; from a\r\nrough woodcut given in the _United Service Journal_ (1831, part iii, p.\r\n190), accompanying a paper by Mr. Bennett, it appears that the shore is\r\nfringed; coloured red.—_Tanna._ Forster, in his “Observations” (p. 22),\r\nsays Tanna has on its shores coral-rock and madrepores; and the younger\r\nForster, in his account (vol. ii, p. 269) speaking of the harbour\r\nsays, the whole S.E. side consists of coral-reefs, which are overflowed\r\nat high-water; part of the southern shore in Cook’s chart is\r\nrepresented as fringed; coloured red.—_Immer_ is described (_United\r\nService Journal,_ 1831, part iii, p. 192) by Mr. Bennett as being of\r\nmoderate elevation, with cliffs appearing like sandstone: coral grows\r\nin patches on its shore, but I have not coloured it; and I mention\r\nthese facts, because Immer might have been thought from Forster’s\r\nclassification (“Observations,” p. 14), to have been a low island or\r\neven an atoll.—_Erromango_ Island; Cook (“Second Voyage,” vol. ii, p.\r\n45, 4to ed.) speaks of rocks everywhere _lining_ the coast, and the\r\nnatives offered to haul his boat over the breakers to the sandy beach:\r\nMr. Bennett, in a letter to the Editor of the _Singapore Chron._,\r\nalludes to the _reefs_ on its shores. It may, I think, be safely\r\ninferred from these passages that the shore is fringed in parts by\r\ncoral-reefs; coloured red.—_Sandwich_ Island. The east coast is said\r\n(Cook’s “Second Voyage,” vol. ii, p. 41) to be low, and to be guarded\r\nby a chain of breakers. In the accompanying chart it is seen to be\r\nfringed by a reef; coloured red.—_Mallicollo._ Forster speaks of the\r\nreef-bounded shore: the reef is about thirty yards wide, and so shallow\r\nthat a boat cannot pass over it. Forster also (“Observations,” p. 23)\r\nsays, that the rocks of the sea-shore consist of madrepore. In the plan\r\nof Sandwich harbour, the headlands are represented as fringed; coloured\r\nred.—_Aurora_ and _Pentecost_ Islands, according to Bougainville,\r\napparently have no reefs; nor has the large island of _S. Espiritu_,\r\nnor _Bligh_ Island or _Banks’_ Islands, which latter lie to the N.E. of\r\nthe Hebrides. But in none of these cases, have I met with any detailed\r\naccount of their shores, or seen plans on a large scale; and it will be\r\nevident, that a fringing-reef of only thirty or even a few hundred\r\nyards in width, is of so little importance to navigation, that it will\r\nseldom be noticed, excepting by chance; and hence I do not doubt that\r\nseveral of these islands, now left uncoloured, ought to be red.\r\n\r\nSANTA CRUZ GROUP.—_Vanikoro_ (Fig. 1, Plate I) offers a striking\r\nexample of a barrier- reef: it was first described by the Chevalier\r\nDillon, in his voyage, and was surveyed in the _Astrolabe_; coloured\r\npale blue.—_Tikopia_ and _Fataka_ Islands appear, from the descriptions\r\nof Dillon and D’Urville, to have no reefs; _ Anouda_ is a low, flat\r\nisland, surrounded by cliffs (“_Astrolabe_ Hydrog.” and Krusenstern,\r\n“Mem.” vol. ii, p. 432); these are uncoloured. _Toupoua_ (_Otooboa_ of\r\nDillon) is stated by Captain Tromelin (“Annales Marit.” 1829, p. 289)\r\nto be almost entirely included in a reef, lying at the distance of two\r\nmiles from the shore. There is a space of three miles without any reef,\r\nwhich, although indented with bays, offers no anchorage from the\r\nextreme depth of the water close to the shore: Captain Dillon also\r\nspeaks of the reefs fronting this island; coloured blue.—_Santa-Cruz._\r\nI have carefully examined the works of Carteret, D’Entrecasteaux,\r\nWilson, and Tromelin, and I cannot discover any mention of reefs on its\r\nshores; left uncoloured.—_Tinakoro_ is a constantly active volcano\r\nwithout reefs.—_Mendana Isles_ (mentioned by Dillon under the name of\r\n_Mammee_, etc.); said by Krusenstern to be low, and intertwined with\r\nreefs. I do not believe they include a lagoon; I have left them\r\nuncoloured.—_Duff’s_ Islands compose a small group\r\ndirected in a N.W. and S.E. band; they are described by Wilson (p. 296,\r\n“Miss. Voy.” 4to ed.), as formed by bold-peaked land, with the islands\r\nsurrounded by coral-reefs, extending about half a mile from the shore;\r\nat a distance of a mile from the reefs he found only seven fathoms. As\r\nI have no reason for supposing there is deep water within these reefs,\r\nI have coloured them red. _Kennedy_ Island, N.E. of Duff’s. I have been\r\nunable to find any account of it.\r\n\r\nNEW CALEDONIA.—The great barrier-reefs on the shores of this island\r\nhave already been described (Fig. 5, Plate II). They have been visited\r\nby Labillardiere, Cook, and the northern point by D’Urville; this\r\nlatter part so closely resembles an atoll that I have coloured it dark\r\nblue. The _Loyalty_ group is situated eastward of this island; from the\r\nchart and description given in the “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,” they do\r\nnot appear to have any reefs; north of this group, there are some\r\nextensive low reefs (called _Astrolabe_ and _Beaupré_,) which do not\r\nseem to be atoll-formed; these are left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN BARRIER-REEF.—The limits of this great reef, which has\r\nalready been described, have been coloured from the charts of Flinders\r\nand King. In the northern parts, an atoll-formed reef, lying outside\r\nthe barrier, has been described by Bligh, and is coloured dark blue. In\r\nthe space between Australia and New Caledonia, called by Flinders the\r\nCorallian Sea, there are numerous reefs. Of these, some are represented\r\nin Krusenstern’s “Atlas” as having an atoll-like structure; namely,\r\n_Bampton_ shoal, _Frederic, Vine_ or Horse-shoe, and _ Alert_ reefs;\r\nthese have been coloured dark blue.\r\n\r\nLOUISIADE.—The dangerous reefs which front and surround the western,\r\nsouthern, and northern coasts of this so-called peninsula and\r\narchipelago, seem evidently to belong to the barrier class. The land is\r\nlofty, with a low fringe on the coast; the reefs are distant, and the\r\nsea outside them profoundly deep. Nearly all that is known of this\r\ngroup is derived from the labours of D’Entrecasteaux and Bougainville:\r\nthe latter has represented one continuous reef ninety miles long,\r\nparallel to the shore, and in places as much as ten miles from it;\r\ncoloured pale blue. A little distance northward we have the _Laughlan_\r\nIslands, the reefs round which are engraved in the “Atlas of the Voyage\r\nof the _Astrolabe_,” in the same manner as in the encircled islands of\r\nthe Caroline Archipelago, the reef is, in parts, a mile and a half from\r\nthe shore, to which it does not appear to be attached; coloured blue.\r\nAt some little distance from the extremity of the Louisiade lies the\r\n_Wells_ reef, described in G. Hamilton’s “Voyage in H.M.S. _Pandora_”\r\n(p. 100): it is said, “We found we had got embayed in a double reef,\r\nwhich will soon be an island.” As this statement is only intelligible\r\non the supposition of the reef being crescent or horse-shoe formed,\r\nlike so many other submerged annular reefs, I have ventured to colour\r\nit blue.\r\n\r\nSOLOMON ARCHIPELAGO.—The chart in Krusenstern’s “Atlas” shows that\r\nthese islands are not encircled, and as coral appears from the works of\r\nSurville, Bougainville, and Labillardiere, to grow on their shores,\r\nthis circumstance, as in the case of the New Hebrides, is a presumption\r\nthat they are fringed. I cannot find out anything from\r\nD’Entrecasteaux’s\r\n“Voyage,” regarding the southern islands of the group, so have left\r\nthem uncoloured.—_Malayta_ Island in a rough MS. chart in the Admiralty\r\nhas its northern shore fringed.—_Ysabel_ Island, the N.E. part of this\r\nisland, in the same chart, is also fringed: Mendana, speaking (Burney,\r\nvol. i, p. 280) of an islet adjoining the northern coast, says it is\r\nsurrounded by reefs; the shores, also of Port Praslin appear regularly\r\nfringed.—_Choiseul_ Island. In Bougainville’s “Chart of Choiseul Bay,”\r\nparts of the shores are fringed by coral-reefs.—_Bougainville_ Island.\r\nAccording to D’Entrecasteaux the western shore abounds with\r\ncoral-reefs, and the smaller islands are said to be attached to the\r\nlarger ones by reefs; all the before-mentioned islands have been\r\ncoloured red.—_Bouka_ Islands. Captain Duperrey has kindly informed me\r\nin a letter that he passed close round the northern side of this island\r\n(of which a plan is given in his “Atlas of the _Coquille’s_ Voyage”),\r\nand that it was “garnie d’une bande de récifs à fleur d’eau adherentes\r\nau rivage;” and he infers, from the abundance of coral on the islands\r\nnorth and south of Bouka, that the reef probably is of coral; coloured\r\nred.\r\n\r\nOff the north coast of the Solomon Archipelago there are several small\r\ngroups which are little known; they appear to be low, and of\r\ncoral-formation; and some of them probably have an atoll-like\r\nstructure; the Chevallier Dillon, however, informs me that this is not\r\nthe case with the B. de _Candelaria.—Outong Java_, according to the\r\nSpanish navigator, Maurelle, is thus characterised; but this is the\r\nonly one which I have ventured to colour blue.\r\n\r\nNEW IRELAND.—The shores of the S.W. point of this island and some\r\nadjoining islets, are fringed by reefs, as may be seen in the “Atlases\r\nof the Voyages of the _Coquille_ and _Astrolabe_.” M. Lesson observes\r\nthat the reefs are open in front of each streamlet. The _Duke of\r\nYork’s_ Island is also fringed; but with regard to the other parts of\r\n_New Ireland, New Hanover_, and the small islands lying northward, I\r\nhave been unable to obtain any information. I will only add that no\r\npart of New Ireland appears to be fronted by distant reefs. I have\r\ncoloured red only the above specified portions.\r\n\r\nNEW BRITAIN AND THE NORTHERN SHORE OF NEW GUINEA.—From the charts in\r\nthe “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,” and from the “Hydrog. Memoir,” it\r\nappears that these coasts are entirely without reefs, as are the\r\n_Schouten_ Islands, lying close to the northern shore of New Guinea.\r\nThe western and south-western parts of New Guinea, will be treated of\r\nwhen we come to the islands of the East Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY GROUP.—From the accounts by Bougainville, Maurelle,\r\nD’Entrecasteaux, and the scattered notices collected by Horsburgh, it\r\nappears, that some of the many islands composing it, are high, with a\r\nbold outline; and others are very low, small and interlaced with reefs.\r\nAll the high islands appear to be fronted by distant reefs rising\r\nabruptly from the sea, and within some of which there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the water is deep. I have therefore little doubt they are\r\nof the barrier class.—In the southern part of the group we have _\r\nElizabeth_ Island, which is surrounded by a reef at the distance of a\r\nmile; and two miles eastward of it (Krusenstern, “Append.” 1835, p. 42)\r\nthere is a little island\r\ncontaining a lagoon.—Near here, also lies _ Circular-reef_ (Horsburgh,\r\n“Direct.,” vol. i, p. 691, 4th ed.), “three or four miles in diameter\r\nhaving deep water inside with an opening at the N.N.W. part, and on the\r\noutside steep to.” I have from these data, coloured the group pale\r\nblue, and _ Circular-reef_ dark blue.—The _Anachorites, Echequier_, and\r\n_Hermites_, consist of innumerable low islands of coral-formation,\r\nwhich probably have atoll-like forms; but not being able to ascertain\r\nthis, I have not coloured them, nor _Durour_ Island, which is described\r\nby Carteret as low.\r\n\r\nThe CAROLINE ARCHIPELAGO is now well-known, chiefly from the\r\nhydrographical labours of Lutké; it contains about forty groups of\r\natolls, and three encircled islands, two of which are engraved in Figs\r\n2 and 7, Plate I. Commencing with the eastern part; the encircling reef\r\nround _Ualen_ appears to be only about half a mile from the shore; but\r\nas the land is low and covered with mangroves (“Voyage autour du\r\nMonde,” par F. Lutké, vol. i, p. 339), the real margin has not probably\r\nbeen ascertained. The extreme depth in one of the harbours within the\r\nreef is thirty-three fathoms (see charts in “Atlas of _Coquille’s_\r\nVoyage”), and outside at half a mile distant from the reef, no bottom\r\nwas obtained with two hundred and fifty fathoms. The reef is surmounted\r\nby many islets, and the lagoon-like channel within is mostly shallow,\r\nand appears to have been much encroached on by the low land surrounding\r\nthe central mountains; these facts show that time has allowed much\r\ndetritus to accumulate; coloured pale blue.—_Pouynipète_, or Seniavine.\r\nIn the greater part of the circumference of this island, the reef is\r\nabout one mile and three quarters distant; on the north side it is five\r\nmiles off the included high islets. The reef is broken in several\r\nplaces; and just within it, the depth in one place is thirty fathoms,\r\nand in another, twenty-eight, beyond which, to all appearance, there\r\nwas “un porte vaste et sur” (Lutké, vol. ii, p. 4); coloured pale\r\nblue.—_Hogoleu_ or _Roug_. This wonderful group contains at least\r\nsixty-two islands, and its reef is one hundred and thirty-five miles in\r\ncircuit. Of the islands, only a few, about six or eight (see “Hydrog.\r\nDescrip.” p. 428, of the “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,” and the large\r\naccompanying chart taken chiefly from that given by Duperrey) are high,\r\nand the rest are all small, low, and formed on the reef. The depth of\r\nthe great interior lake has not been ascertained; but Captain D’Urville\r\nappears to have entertained no doubt about the possibility of taking in\r\na frigate. The reef lies no less than fourteen miles distant from the\r\nnorthern coasts of the interior high islands, seven from their western\r\nsides, and twenty from the southern; the sea is deep outside. This\r\nisland is a likeness on a grand scale to the Gambier group in the Low\r\nArchipelago. Of the groups of low[1] islands forming the chief part of\r\nthe Caroline Archipelago, all those of larger size, have the true\r\natoll-structure (as may be seen in the “Atlas” by Captain Lutké), and\r\nsome even of the very small ones, as _ Macaskill_ and _Duperrey_, of\r\nwhich plans are given in the\r\n“Atlas of the _Coquille’s_ Voyage.” There are, however, some low small\r\nislands of coral-formation, namely _Ollap, Tamatam, Bigali, Satahoual_,\r\nwhich do not contain lagoons; but it is probable that lagoons\r\noriginally existed, but have since filled up: Lutké (vol. ii, p. 304)\r\nseems to have thought that all the low islands, with only one\r\nexception, contained lagoons. From the sketches, and from the manner in\r\nwhich the margins of these islands are engraved in the “Atlas of the\r\nVoyage of the _Coquille_,” it might have been thought that they were\r\nnot low; but by a comparison with the remarks of Lutké (vol. ii, p.\r\n107, regarding Bigali) and of Freycinet (“Hydrog. Memoir _ L’Uranie_\r\nVoyage,” p. 188, regarding Tamatam, Ollap, etc.), it will be seen that\r\nthe artist must have represented the land incorrectly. The most\r\nsouthern island in the group, namely _ Piguiram_, is not coloured,\r\nbecause I have found no account of it. _Nougouor_, or _Monte Verdison_,\r\nwhich was not visited by Lutké, is described and figured by Mr. Bennett\r\n(_United Service Journal_, January 1832) as an atoll. All the\r\nabove-mentioned islands have been coloured blue.\r\n\r\n [1] In D’Urville and Lottin’s chart, Peserare is written with capital\r\n letters; but this evidently is an error, for it is one of the low\r\n islets on the reef of Namonouyto (see Lutké’s charts)—a regular atoll.\r\n\r\nWESTERN PART OF THE CAROLINE ARCHIPELAGO.—_Fais_ Island is ninety feet\r\nhigh, and is surrounded, as I have been informed by Admiral Lutké, by a\r\nnarrow reef of living coral, of which the broadest part, as represented\r\nin the charts, is only 150 yards; coloured red.—_Philip_ Island., I\r\nbelieve, is low; but Hunter, in his “Historical Journal,” gives no\r\nclear account of it; uncoloured.—_Elivi_; from the manner in which the\r\nislets on the reefs are engraved, in the “Atlas of the _Astrolabe’s_\r\nVoyage,” I should have thought they were above the ordinary height, but\r\nAdmiral Lutké assures me this is not the case: they form a regular\r\natoll; coloured blue.—_Gouap_ (_Eap_ of Chamisso), is a high island\r\nwith a reef (see chart in “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_”), more than a\r\nmile distant in most parts from the shore, and two miles in one part.\r\nCaptain D’Urville thinks that there would be anchorage (“Hydrog.\r\nDescript. _Astrolabe_ Voyage,” p. 436) for ships within the reef, if a\r\npassage could be found; coloured pale blue.—_Goulou_, from the chart in\r\nthe “_Astrolabe’s_ Atlas,” appears to be an atoll. D’Urville (“Hydrog.\r\nDescript.” p. 437) speaks of the low islets on the reef; coloured dark\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nPELEW ISLANDS.—Krusenstern speaks of some of the islands being\r\nmountainous; the reefs are distant from the shore, and there are spaces\r\nwithin them, and not opposite valleys, with from ten to fifteen\r\nfathoms. According to a MS. chart of the group by Lieutenant Elmer in\r\nthe Admiralty, there is a large space within the reef with deepish\r\nwater; although the high land does not hold a central position with\r\nrespect to the reefs, as is generally the case, I have little doubt\r\nthat the reefs of the Pelew Islands ought to be ranked with the barrier\r\nclass, and I have coloured them pale blue. In Lieutenant Elmer’s chart\r\nthere is a horseshoe-formed shoal, laid down thirteen miles N.W. of\r\nPelew, with fifteen fathoms within the reef, and some dry banks on it;\r\ncoloured dark blue.—_Spanish, Martires, Sanserot, Pulo Anna_ and\r\n_Mariere_ Islands are not coloured, because I know nothing about them,\r\nexcepting that according to Krusenstern, the second, third, and fourth\r\nmentioned, are\r\nlow, placed on coral-reefs, and therefore, perhaps, contain lagoons;\r\nbut Pulo Mariere is a little higher.\r\n\r\nMARIANA ARCHIPELAGO, or LADRONES.—_Guahan._ Almost the whole of this\r\nisland is fringed by reefs, which extend in most parts about a third of\r\na mile from the land. Even where the reefs are most extensive, the\r\nwater within them is shallow. In several parts there is a navigable\r\nchannel for boats and canoes within the reefs. In Freycinet’s “Hydrog.\r\nMem.” there is an account of these reefs, and in the “Atlas,” a map on\r\na large scale; coloured red.—_Rota_. “L’ile est presque entièrement\r\nentourée des récifs” (p. 212, Freycinet’s “Hydrog. Mem.”). These reefs\r\nproject about a quarter of a mile from the shore; coloured\r\nred.—_Tinian. The eastern_ coast is precipitous, and is without reefs;\r\nbut the western side is fringed like the last island; coloured\r\nred.—_Saypan_. The N.E. coast, and likewise the western shores appear\r\nto be fringed; but there is a great, irregular, horn-like reef\r\nprojecting far from this side; coloured red.—_Farallon de Medinilla_,\r\nappears so regularly and closely fringed in Freycinet’s charts, that I\r\nhave ventured to colour it red, although nothing is said about reefs in\r\nthe “Hydrographical Memoir.” The several islands which form the\r\nnorthern part of the group are volcanic (with the exception perhaps of\r\nTorres, which resembles in form the madreporitic island of Medinilla),\r\nand appear to be without reefs.—_Mangs_, however, is described (by\r\nFreycinet, p. 219, “Hydrog.”) from some Spanish charts, as formed of\r\nsmall islands placed “au milieu des nombreux récifs;” and as these\r\nreefs in the general chart of the group do not project so much as a\r\nmile; and as there is no appearance from a double line, of the\r\nexistence of deep water within, I have ventured, although with much\r\nhesitation, to colour them red. Respecting _Folger_ and _ Marshall_\r\nIslands which lie some way east of the Marianas, I can find out\r\nnothing, excepting that they are probably low. Krusenstern says this of\r\nMarshall Island; and Folger Island is written with small letters in\r\nD’Urville’s chart; uncoloured.\r\n\r\nBONIN OR ARZOBISPO GROUP.—_Peel_ Island has been examined by Captain\r\nBeechey, to whose kindness I am much indebted for giving me information\r\nregarding it: “At Port Lloyd there is a great deal of coral; and the\r\ninner harbour is entirely formed by coral-reefs, which extend outside\r\nthe port along the coast.” Captain Beechey, in another part of his\r\nletter to me, alludes to the reefs fringing the island in all\r\ndirections; but at the same time it must be observed that the surf\r\nwashes the volcanic rocks of the coast in the greater part of its\r\ncircumference. I do not know whether the other islands of the\r\nArchipelago are fringed; I have coloured Peel Island red.—_Grampus_\r\nIsland to the eastward, does not appear (Meare’s “Voyage,” p. 95) to\r\nhave any reefs, nor does _ Rosario_ Island (from Lutké’s chart), which\r\nlies to the westward. Respecting the few other islands in this part of\r\nthe sea, namely the _Sulphur_ Islands, with an active volcano, and\r\nthose lying between Bonin and Japan (which are situated near the\r\nextreme limit in latitude, at which reefs are formed), I have not been\r\nable to find any clear account.\r\n\r\nWEST END OF NEW GUINEA.—_Port Dory._ From the charts in the “Voyage of\r\nthe _Coquille_,” it would appear that the coast in this part\r\nis fringed by coral-reefs; M. Lesson, however, remarks that the coral\r\nis sickly; coloured red.—_Waigiou._ A considerable portion of the\r\nnorthern shores of these islands is seen in the charts (on a large\r\nscale) in Freycinet’s “Atlas” to be fringed by coral-reefs. Forrest (p.\r\n21, “Voyage to New Guinea”) alludes to the coral-reefs lining the heads\r\nof Piapis Bay; and Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 599, 4th edit.), speaking of\r\nthe islands in Dampier Strait, says “sharp coral-rocks line their\r\nshores;” coloured red.—In the sea north of these islands, we have\r\n_Guedes_ (or _ Freewill_, or _St. David’s_), which from the chart given\r\nin the 4to edit. of Carteret’s “Voyage,” must be an atoll. Krusenstern\r\nsays the islets are very low; coloured blue.—_Carteret’s Shoals_, in 2°\r\n53′ N., are described as circular, with stony points showing all round,\r\nwith deeper water in the middle; coloured blue.—_Aiou_; the plan of\r\nthis group, given in the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,”\r\nshows that it is an atoll; and, from a chart in Forrest’s “Voyage,” it\r\nappears that there is twelve fathoms within the circular reef; coloured\r\nblue.—The S.W. coast of New Guinea appears to be low, muddy, and devoid\r\nof reefs. The _Arru, Timor-laut_, and _ Tenimber_ groups have lately\r\nbeen examined by Captain Kolff, the MS. translation of which, by Mr. W.\r\nEarl, I have been permitted to read, through the kindness of Captain\r\nWashington, R.N. These islands are mostly rather low, and are\r\nsurrounded by distant reefs (the Ki Islands, however, are lofty, and,\r\nfrom Mr. Stanley’s survey, appear without reefs); the sea in some parts\r\nis shallow, in others profoundly deep (as near Larrat). From the\r\nimperfection of the published charts, I have been unable to decide to\r\nwhich class these reefs belong. From the distance to which they extend\r\nfrom the land, where the sea is very deep, I am strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve they ought to come within the barrier class, and be coloured\r\nblue; but I have been forced to leave them uncoloured.—The\r\nlast-mentioned groups are connected with the east end of Ceram by a\r\nchain of small islands, of which the small groups of _Ceram-laut,\r\nGoram_ and _Keffing_ are surrounded by very extensive reefs, projecting\r\ninto deep water, which, as in the last case, I strongly suspect belong\r\nto the barrier class; but I have not coloured them. From the south side\r\nof Keffing, the reefs project five miles (Windsor Earl’s “Sailing\r\nDirect. for the Arafura Sea,” p. 9).\r\n\r\nCERAM.—In various charts which I have examined, several parts of the\r\ncoast are represented as fringed by reefs.—_Manipa_ Island, between\r\nCeram and Bourou, in an old MS. chart in the Admiralty, is fringed by a\r\nvery irregular reef, partly dry at low water, which I do not doubt is\r\nof coral-formation; both islands coloured red.—_Bourou_; parts of this\r\nisland appear fringed by coral-reefs, namely, the eastern coast, as\r\nseen in Freycinet’s chart; and _Cajeli Bay_, which is said by Horsburgh\r\n(vol. ii, p. 630) to be lined by coral-reefs, that stretch out a little\r\nway, and have only a few feet water on them. In several charts,\r\nportions of the islands forming the AMBOINA GROUP are fringed by reefs;\r\nfor instance, _Noessa, Harenca_, and _Ucaster_, in Freycinet’s charts.\r\nThe above-mentioned islands have been coloured red, although the\r\nevidence is not very satisfactory.—North of Bourou the parallel line of\r\nthe _ Xulla_ Isles extends: I have not been able to find out anything\r\nabout them, excepting\r\nthat Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 543) says that the northern shore is\r\nsurrounded by a reef at the distance of two or three miles;\r\nuncoloured.—_Mysol Group_; the Kanary Islands are said by Forrest\r\n(“Voyage,” p. 130) to be divided from each other by deep straits, and\r\nare lined with coral-rocks; coloured red.—_Guebe_, lying between\r\nWaigiou and Gilolo, is engraved as if fringed; and it is said by\r\nFreycinet, that all the soundings under five fathoms were on coral;\r\ncoloured red.—_Gilolo_. In a chart published by Dalrymple, the numerous\r\nislands on the western, southern (_Batchian_ and the _Strait of\r\nPatientia_), and eastern sides appear fringed by narrow reefs; these\r\nreefs, I suppose, are of coral, for it is said in “Malte Brun” (vol.\r\nxii, p. 156), “Sur les côtes (of Batchian) comme _dans les plupart_ des\r\niles de cet archipel, il y a de rocs de médrepores d’une beauté et\r\nd’une variété infimies.” Forrest, also (p. 50), says Seland, near\r\nBatchian, is a little island with reefs of coral; coloured red.—_Morty_\r\nIsland (north of Gilolo). Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 506) says the northern\r\ncoast is lined by reefs, projecting one or two miles, and having no\r\nsoundings close to them; I have left it uncoloured, although, as in\r\nsome former cases, it ought probably to be pale blue.—_Celebes._ The\r\nwestern and northern coasts appear in the charts to be bold and without\r\nreefs. Near the extreme northern point, however, an islet in the\r\n_Straits of Limbe_, and parts of the adjoining shore, appear to be\r\nfringed: the east side of the bay of _Manado_, has deep water, and is\r\nfringed by sand and coral (“_Astrol._ Voyage,” Hydrog. Part, pp.\r\n453-4); this extreme point, therefore, I have coloured red.—Of the\r\nislands leading from this point to Magindanao, I have not been able to\r\nfind any account, except of _ Serangani_, which appears surrounded by\r\nnarrow reefs; and Forrest (“Voyage,” p. 164) speaks of coral on its\r\nshores; I have, therefore, coloured this island red. To the eastward of\r\nthis chain lie several islands; of which I cannot find any account,\r\nexcept of _Karkalang_, which is said by Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 504) to\r\nbe lined by a dangerous reef, projecting several miles from the\r\nnorthern shore; not coloured.\r\n\r\nISLANDS NEAR TIMOR.—The account of the following islands is taken from\r\nCaptain D. Kolff’s “Voyage,” in 1825, translated by Mr. W. Earl, from\r\nthe Dutch.—_Lette_ has “reefs extending along shore at the distance of\r\nhalf a mile from the land.”—_Moa_ has reefs on the S.W. part.—_Lakor_\r\nhas a reef lining its shore; these islands are coloured red.—Still more\r\neastward, _ Luan_ has, differently from the last-mentioned islands, an\r\nextensive reef; it is steep outside, and within there is a depth of\r\ntwelve feet; from these facts, it is impossible to decide to which\r\nclass this island belongs.—_Kissa_, off the point of Timor, has its\r\n“shore fronted by a reef, steep too on the outer side, over which small\r\nproahs can go at the time of high water;” coloured red.—_Timor_; most\r\nof the points, and some considerable spaces of the northern shore, are\r\nseen in Freycinet’s chart to be fringed by coral-reefs; and mention is\r\nmade of them in the accompanying “Hydrog. Memoir;” coloured\r\nred.—_Savu_, S.E. of Timor, appears in Flinders’ chart to be fringed;\r\nbut I have not coloured it, as I do not know that the reefs are of\r\ncoral.—_Sandalwood_ Island has, according to Horsburgh (vol. ii, p.\r\n607), a reef on its southern shore, four miles distant from the land;\r\nas the neighbouring sea is deep,\r\nand generally bold, this probably is a barrier-reef, but I have not\r\nventured to colour it.\r\n\r\nN.W. COAST OF AUSTRALIA.—It appears, in Captain King’s Sailing\r\nDirections (“Narrative of Survey,” vol. ii, pp. 325-369), that there\r\nare many extensive coral-reefs skirting, often at considerable\r\ndistances, the N.W. shores, and encompassing the small adjoining\r\nislets. Deep water, in no instance, is represented in the charts\r\nbetween these reefs and the land; and, therefore, they probably belong\r\nto the fringing class. But as they extend far into the sea, which is\r\ngenerally shallow, even in places where the land seems to be somewhat\r\nprecipitous; I have not coloured them. Houtman’s Abrolhos (lat. 28° S.\r\non west coast) have lately been surveyed by Captain Wickham (as\r\ndescribed in _Naut. Mag._ 1841, p. 511): they lie on the edge of a\r\nsteeply shelving bank, which extends about thirty miles seaward, along\r\nthe whole line of coast. The two southern reefs, or islands, enclose a\r\nlagoon-like space of water, varying in depth from five to fifteen\r\nfathoms, and in one spot with twenty-three fathoms. The greater part of\r\nthe island has been formed on their inland sides, by the accumulation\r\nof fragments of coral; the seaward face consisting of nearly bare\r\nledges of rock. Some of the specimens, brought home by Captain Wickham,\r\ncontained fragments of marine shells, but others did not; and these\r\nclosely resembled a formation at King George’s Sound, principally due\r\nto the action of the wind on calcareous dust, which I shall describe in\r\na forthcoming part. From the extreme irregularity of these reefs with\r\ntheir lagoons, and from their position on a bank, the usual depth of\r\nwhich is only thirty fathoms, I have not ventured to class them with\r\natolls, and hence have left them uncoloured.—_Rowley Shoals._ These lie\r\nsome way from the N.W. coast of Australia: according to Captain King\r\n(“Narrative of Survey,” vol. i, p. 60), they are of coral-formation.\r\nThey rise abruptly from the sea, and Captain King had no bottom with\r\n170 fathoms close to them. Three of them are crescent-shaped; they are\r\nmentioned by Mr. Lyell, on the authority of Captain King, with\r\nreference to the direction of their open sides. “A third oval reef of\r\nthe same group is entirely submerged” (“Principles of Geology,” book\r\niii, chap. xviii); coloured blue.—_Scott’s Reefs_, lying north of\r\nRowley Shoals, are briefly described by Captain Wickham (_Naut. Mag._\r\n1841, p. 440): they appear to be of great size, of a circular form, and\r\n“with smooth water within, forming probably a lagoon of great extent.”\r\nThere is a break on the western side, where there probably is an\r\nentrance: the water is very deep off these reefs; coloured blue.\r\n\r\nProceeding westward along the great volcanic chain of the East Indian\r\nArchipelago, _Solor Strait_ is represented in a chart published by\r\nDalrymple from a Dutch MS., as fringed; as are parts of _Flores_, of\r\n_Adenara_, and of _Solor._ Horsburgh speaks of coral growing on these\r\nshores; and therefore I have no doubt that the reefs are of coral, and\r\naccordingly have coloured them red. We hear from Horsburgh (vol. ii, p.\r\n602) that a coral-flat bounds the shores of _Sapy_ Bay. From the same\r\nauthority it appears (p. 610) that reefs fringe the island of _\r\nTimor-Young_, on the N. shore of Sumbawa; and, likewise (p. 600),\r\nthat _Bally_ town in _Lombock_, is fronted by a reef, stretching along\r\nthe shore at a distance of a hundred fathoms, with channels through it\r\nfor boats; these places, therefore, have been coloured red.—_Bally_\r\nIsland. In a Dutch MS. chart on a large scale of Java, which was\r\nbrought from that island by Dr. Horsfield, who had the kindness to show\r\nit me at the India House, its western, northern, and southern shores\r\nappear very regularly fringed by a reef (see also Horsburgh, vol. ii,\r\np. 593); and as coral is found abundantly there, I have not the least\r\ndoubt that the reef is of coral, and therefore have coloured it red.\r\n\r\nJAVA.—My information regarding the reefs of this great island is\r\nderived from the chart just mentioned. The greater part of _Maduara_ is\r\nrepresented in it as regularly fringed, and likewise portions of the\r\ncoast of Java immediately south of it. Dr. Horsfield informs me that\r\ncoral is very abundant near _Sourabaya._ The islets and parts of the N.\r\ncoast of Java, west of _Point Buang_, or _Japara_, are fringed by\r\nreefs, said to be of coral. _Lubeck_, or _Bavian_ Islands, lying at\r\nsome distance from the shore of Java, are regularly fringed by\r\ncoral-reefs. _Carimon Java_ appears equally so, though it is not\r\ndirectly said that the reefs are of coral; there is a depth between\r\nthirty and forty fathoms round these islands. Parts of the shores of\r\n_Sunda Strait_, where the water is from forty to eighty fathoms deep,\r\nand the islets near _Batavia_ appear in several charts to be fringed.\r\nIn the Dutch chart the southern shore, in the narrowest part of the\r\nisland, is in two places fringed by reefs of coral. West of _\r\nSegorrowodee_ Bay, and the extreme S.E. and E. portions are likewise\r\nfringed by coral-reefs; all the above-mentioned places coloured red.\r\n\r\n_Macassar Strait_; the east coast of Borneo appears, in most parts,\r\nfree from reefs, and where they occur, as on the east coast of\r\n_Pamaroong_, the sea is very shallow; hence no part is coloured. In\r\n_Macassar_ Strait itself, in about lat. 2° S., there are many small\r\nislands with coral-shoals projecting far from them. There are also (old\r\ncharts by Dalrymple) numerous little flats of coral, not rising to the\r\nsurface of the water, and shelving suddenly from five fathoms to no\r\nbottom with fifty fathoms; they do not appear to have a lagoon-like\r\nstructure. There are similar coral-shoals a little farther south; and\r\nin lat. 4° 55′ there are two, which are engraved from modern surveys,\r\nin a manner which might represent an annular reef with deep water\r\ninside: Captain Moresby, however, who was formerly in this sea, doubts\r\nthis fact, so that I have left them uncoloured: at the same time I may\r\nremark, that these two shoals make a nearer approach to the atoll-like\r\nstructure than any other within the E. Indian Archipelago. Southward of\r\nthese shoals there are other low islands and irregular coral-reefs; and\r\nin the space of sea, north of the great volcanic chain, from Timor to\r\nJava, we have also other islands, such as the _Postillions, Kalatoa,\r\nTokan-Bessees_, etc., which are chiefly low, and are surrounded by very\r\nirregular and distant reefs. From the imperfect charts I have seen, I\r\nhave not been able to decide whether they belong to the atoll or\r\nbarrier-classes, or whether they merely fringe submarine banks, and\r\ngently sloping land. In the Bay of _Bonin_, between the two southern\r\narms of Celebes, there are numerous coral-reefs;\r\nbut none of them seem to have an atoll-like structure. I have,\r\ntherefore, not coloured any of the islands in this part of the sea; I\r\nthink it, however, exceedingly probable that some of them ought to be\r\nblue. I may add that there is a harbour on the S.E. coast of _Bouton_\r\nwhich, according to an old chart, is formed by a reef, parallel to the\r\nshore, with deep water within; and in the “Voyage of the _Coquille_,”\r\nsome neighbouring islands are represented with reefs a good way\r\ndistant, but I do not know whether with deep water within. I have not\r\nthought the evidence sufficient to permit me to colour them.\r\n\r\nSUMATRA.—Commencing with the west coast and outlying islands, _Engano\r\nIsland_ is represented in the published chart as surrounded by a narrow\r\nreef, and Napier, in his “Sailing Directions,” speaks of the reef being\r\nof coral (also Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 115); coloured red.—_Rat Island_\r\n(3° 51′ S.) is surrounded by reefs of coral, partly dry at low water,\r\n(Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 96).—_Trieste Island_ (4° 2′ S.). The shore is\r\nrepresented in a chart which I saw at the India House, as fringed in\r\nsuch a manner, that I feel sure the fringe consists of coral; but as\r\nthe island is so low, that the sea sometimes flows quite over it\r\n(Dampier, “Voyage,” vol. i, p. 474), I have not coloured it.—_Pulo\r\nDooa_ (lat. 3°). In an old chart it is said there are chasms in the\r\nreefs round the island, admitting boats to the watering-place, and that\r\nthe southern islet consists of a mass of sand and coral.—_Pulo Pisang_;\r\nHorsburgh (vol. ii, p. 86) says that the rocky coral-bank, which\r\nstretches about forty yards from the shore, is steep to all round: in a\r\nchart, also, which I have seen, the island is represented as regularly\r\nfringed.—_Pulo Mintao_ is lined with reefs on its west side (Horsburgh,\r\nvol. ii, p. 107).—_Pulo Baniak_; the same authority (vol. ii, p. 105),\r\nspeaking of a part, says it is faced with coral-rocks.—_Minguin_ (3°\r\n36′ N.). A coral-reef fronts this place, and projects into the sea\r\nnearly a quarter of a mile (“Notices of the Indian Arch.” published at\r\nSingapore, p. 105).—_Pulo Brassa_ (5° 46′ N.). A reef surrounds it at a\r\ncable’s length (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 60). I have coloured all the\r\nabove-specified points red. I may here add, that both Horsburgh and Mr.\r\nMoor (in the “Notices” just alluded to) frequently speak of the\r\nnumerous reefs and banks of coral on the west coast of Sumatra; but\r\nthese nowhere have the structure of a barrier-reef, and Marsden\r\n(“History of Sumatra”) states, that where the coast is flat, the\r\nfringing-reefs extend furthest from it. The northern and southern\r\npoints, and the greater part of the east coast, are low, and faced with\r\nmud banks, and therefore without coral.\r\n\r\nNICOBAR ISLANDS.—The chart represents the islands of this group as\r\nfringed by reefs. With regard to _Great Nicobar_, Captain Moresby\r\ninforms me, that it is fringed by reefs of coral, extending between two\r\nand three hundred yards from the shore. The _Northern Nicobars_ appear\r\nso regularly fringed in the published charts, that I have no doubt the\r\nreefs are of coral. This group, therefore, is coloured red.\r\n\r\nANDAMAN ISLANDS.—From an examination of the MS. chart, on a large\r\nscale, of this island, by Captain Arch. Blair, in the Admiralty,\r\nseveral portions of the coast appear fringed; and as Horsburgh speaks\r\nof coral-reefs being numerous in the vicinity of these islands, I\r\nshould have\r\ncoloured them red, had not some expressions in a paper in the “Asiatic\r\nResearches” (vol. iv, p. 402) led me to doubt the existence of reefs;\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe coast of _Malacca, Tenasserim_ and the coasts northward, appear in\r\nthe greater part to be low and muddy: where reefs occur, as in parts of\r\n_Malacca Straits_, and near _ Singapore_, they are of the fringing\r\nkind; but the water is so shoal, that I have not coloured them. In the\r\nsea, however, between Malacca and the west coast of Borneo, where there\r\nis a greater depth from forty to fifty fathoms, I have coloured red\r\nsome of the groups, which are regularly fringed. The northern _Natunas_\r\nand the _Anambas_ Islands are represented in the charts on a large\r\nscale, published in the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _ Favourite_,” as\r\nfringed by reefs of coral, with very shoal water within\r\nthem.—_Tumbelan_ and _Bunoa_ Islands (1° N.) are represented in the\r\nEnglish charts as surrounded by a very regular fringe.—_St. Barbes_ (0°\r\n15′ N.) is said by Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 279) to be fronted by a reef,\r\nover which boats can land only at high water.—The shore of _Borneo_ at\r\n_Tunjong Apee_ is also fronted by a reef, extending not far from the\r\nland (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 468). These places I have coloured red;\r\nalthough with some hesitation, as the water is shallow. I might perhaps\r\nhave added _Pulo Leat_, in Gaspar Strait, _Lucepara_, and _Carimata_;\r\nbut as the sea is confined and shallow, and the reefs not very regular,\r\nI have left them uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe water shoals gradually towards the whole west coast of _ Borneo_: I\r\ncannot make out that it has any reefs of coral. The islands, however,\r\noff the northern extremity, and near the S.W. end of _Palawan_, are\r\nfringed by very distant coral-reefs; thus the reefs in the case of\r\n_Balabac_ are no less than five miles from the land; but the sea, in\r\nthe whole of this district, is so shallow, that the reefs might be\r\nexpected to extend very far from the land. I have not, therefore,\r\nthought myself authorised to colour them. The N.E. point of Borneo,\r\nwhere the water is very shoal, is connected with Magindanao by a chain\r\nof islands called the _Sooloo Archipelago_, about which I have been\r\nable to obtain very little information; _Pangootaran_, although ten\r\nmiles long, entirely consists of a bed of coral-rock (“Notices of E.\r\nIndian Arch.” p. 58): I believe from Horsburgh that the island is low;\r\nnot coloured.—_Tahow Bank_, in some old charts, appears like a\r\nsubmerged atoll; not coloured. Forrest (“Voyage,” p. 21) states that\r\none of the islands near Sooloo is surrounded by coral-rocks; but there\r\nis no distant reef. Near the S. end of _ Basselan_, some of the islets\r\nin the chart accompanying Forrest’s “Voyage,” appear fringed with\r\nreefs; hence I have coloured, though unwillingly, parts of the Sooloo\r\ngroup red. The sea between Sooloo and Palawan, near the shoal coast of\r\nBorneo, is interspersed with irregular reefs and shoal patches; not\r\ncoloured: but in the northern part of this sea, there are two low\r\nislets, _ Cagayanes_ and _Cavilli_, surrounded by extensive\r\ncoral-reefs; the breakers round the latter (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 513)\r\nextend five or six miles from a sandbank, which forms the only dry\r\npart; these breakers are steep to outside; there appears to be an\r\nopening through them on one side, with four or five fathoms within:\r\nfrom this description, I strongly suspect that Cavilli\r\nought to be considered an atoll; but, as I have not seen any chart of\r\nit, on even a moderately large scale, I have not coloured it. The\r\nislets off the northern end of _Palawan_, are in the same case as those\r\noff the southern end, namely they are fringed by reefs, some way\r\ndistant from the shore, but the water is exceedingly shallow;\r\nuncoloured. The western shore of Palawan will be treated of under the\r\nhead of China Sea.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE ARCHIPELAGO.—A chart on a large scale of _Appoo Shoal_,\r\nwhich lies near the S.E. coast of Mindoro, has been executed by Captain\r\nD. Ross: it appears atoll-formed, but with rather an irregular outline;\r\nits diameter is about ten miles; there are two well-defined passages\r\nleading into the interior lagoon, which appears open; close outside the\r\nreef all round, there is no bottom with seventy fathoms; coloured\r\nblue.—_Mindoro_: the N.W. coast is represented in several charts, as\r\nfringed by a reef, and _Luban Island_ is said, by Horsburgh (vol. ii,\r\np. 436), to be “lined by a reef.”—_Luzon_: Mr. Cuming, who has lately\r\ninvestigated with so much success the Natural History of the\r\nPhilippines, informs me, that about three miles of the shore north of\r\nPoint St. Jago, is fringed by a reef; as are (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p.\r\n437) the Three Friars off Silanguin Bay. Between Point Capones and\r\nPlaya Honda, the coast is “lined by a coral-reef, stretching out nearly\r\na mile in some places,” (Horsburgh); and Mr. Cuming visited some\r\nfringing-reefs on parts of this coast, namely, near Puebla, Iba, and\r\nMansinglor. In the neighbourhood of Solon-solon Bay, the shore is lined\r\n(Horsburgh, ii, p. 439) by coral-reefs, stretching out a great way:\r\nthere are also reefs about the islets off Solamague; and as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Cuming, near St. Catalina, and a little north of it.\r\nThe same gentleman informs me there are reefs on the S.E. point of this\r\nisland in front of Samar, extending from Malalabon to Bulusan. These\r\nappear to be the principal fringing-reefs on the coasts of Luzon; and\r\nthey have all been coloured red. Mr. Cuming informs me that none of\r\nthem have deep water within; although it appears from Horsburgh that\r\nsome few extend to a considerable distance from the shore. Within the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago, the shores of the islands do not appear to be\r\ncommonly fringed, with the exception of the S. shore of _ Masbate_, and\r\nnearly the whole of _Bohol_; which are both coloured red. On the S.\r\nshore of _Magindanao_, Bunwoot Island is surrounded (according to\r\nForrest, “Voyage,” p. 253), by a coral-reef, which in the chart appears\r\none of the fringing class. With respect to the eastern coasts of the\r\nwhole Archipelago, I have not been able to obtain any account.\r\n\r\nBABUYAN ISLANDS.—Horsburgh says (vol. ii, p. 442), coral-reefs line the\r\nshores of the harbour in Fuga; and the charts show there are other\r\nreefs about these islands. Camiguin has its shore in parts lined by\r\ncoral-rock (Horsburgh, p. 443); about a mile off shore there is between\r\nthirty and thirty-five fathoms. The plan of Port San Pio Quinto shows\r\nthat its shores are fringed with coral; coloured red.—BASHEE ISLANDS:\r\nHorsburgh, speaking of the southern part of the group (vol. ii, p. 445)\r\nsays the shores of both islands are fortified by a reef, and through\r\nsome of the gaps in it, the natives can pass in their\r\nboats in fine weather; the bottom near the land is coral-rock. From the\r\npublished charts, it is evident that several of these islands are most\r\nregularly fringed; coloured red. The northern islands are left\r\nuncoloured, as I have been unable to find any account of them.—FORMOSA.\r\nThe shores, especially the western one, seem chiefly composed of mud\r\nand sand, and I cannot make out that they are anywhere lined by reefs;\r\nexcept in a harbour (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 449) at the extreme\r\nnorthern point: hence, of course, the whole of this island is left\r\nuncoloured. The small adjoining islands are in the same case.—PATCHOW,\r\nOR MADJIKO-SIMA GROUPS. _Patchuson_ has been described by Captain\r\nBroughton (“Voy. to the N. Pacific,” p. 191); he says, the boats, with\r\nsome difficulty, found a passage through the coral-reefs, which extend\r\nalong the coast, nearly half a mile off it. The boats were well\r\nsheltered within the reef; but it does not appear that the water is\r\ndeep there. Outside the reef the depth is very irregular, varying from\r\nfive to fifty fathoms; the form of the land is not very abrupt;\r\ncoloured red.—_Taypin-san_; from the description given (p. 195) by the\r\nsame author, it appears that a very irregular reef extends, to the\r\ndistance of several miles, from the southern island; but whether it\r\nencircles a space of deep water is not evident; nor, indeed, whether\r\nthese outlying reefs are connected with those more immediately\r\nadjoining the land; left uncoloured. I may here just add that the shore\r\nof _Kumi_ (lying west of Patchow), has a narrow reef attached to it in\r\nthe plan of it, in La Peyrouse’s “Atlas;” but it does not appear in the\r\naccount of the voyage that it is of coral; uncoloured.—LOO CHOO. The\r\ngreater part of the coast of this moderately hilly island, is skirted\r\nby reefs, which do not extend far from the shore, and which do not\r\nleave a channel of deep water within them, as may be seen in the charts\r\naccompanying Captain B. Hall’s voyage to Loo Choo (see also remarks in\r\nAppendix, pp. xxi. and xxv.). There are, however, some ports with deep\r\nwater, formed by reefs in front of valleys, in the same manner as\r\nhappens at Mauritius. Captain Beechey, in a letter to me, compares\r\nthese reefs with those encircling the Society Islands; but there\r\nappears to me a marked difference between them, in the less distance at\r\nwhich the Loo Choo reefs lie from the land with relation to the\r\nprobable submarine inclination, and in the absence of an interior deep\r\nwater-moat or channel, parallel to the land. Hence, I have classed\r\nthese reefs with fringing-reefs, and coloured them red.—PESCADORES\r\n(west of Formosa). Dampier (vol. i, p. 416), has compared the\r\nappearance of the land to the southern parts of England. The islands\r\nare interlaced with coral-reefs; but as the water is very shoal, and as\r\nspits of sand and gravel (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 450) extend far out\r\nfrom them, it is impossible to draw any inferences regarding the nature\r\nof the reefs.\r\n\r\nCHINA SEA.—Proceeding from north to south, we first meet the _Pratas\r\nShoal_ (lat. 20° N.) which, according to Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 335),\r\nis composed of coral, is of a circular form, and has a low islet on it.\r\nThe reef is on a level with the water’s edge, and when the sea runs\r\nhigh, there are breakers mostly all round, “but the water within seems\r\npretty deep in some places; although steep-to in most parts outside,\r\nthere appear to be several parts where a ship might find anchorage\r\noutside the breakers;” coloured blue.—The _ Paracells_ have been\r\naccurately surveyed by Captain D. Ross, and charts on a large scale\r\npublished: but few low islets have been formed on these shoals, and\r\nthis seems to be a general circumstance in the China Sea; the sea close\r\noutside the reefs is very deep; several of them have a lagoon-like\r\nstructure; or separate islets (_Prattle, Robert, Drummond_, etc.) are\r\nso arranged round a moderately shallow space, as to appear as if they\r\nhad once formed one large atoll.—_Bombay Shoal_ (one of the Paracells)\r\nhas the form of an annular reef, and is “apparently deep within;” it\r\nseems to have an entrance (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 332) on its west\r\nside; it is very steep outside.—_Discovery Shoal_, also is of an oval\r\nform, with a lagoon-like space within, and three openings leading into\r\nit, in which there is a depth from two to twenty fathoms. Outside, at\r\nthe distance (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 333) of only twenty yards from the\r\nreef, soundings could not be obtained. The Paracells are coloured\r\nblue.—_Macclesfield Bank_: this is a coral-bank of great size, lying\r\neast of the Paracells; some parts of the bank are level, with a sandy\r\nbottom, but, generally, the depth is very irregular. It is intersected\r\nby deep cuts or channels. I am not able to perceive in the published\r\ncharts (its limits, however, are not very accurately known) whether the\r\ncentral part is deeper, which I suspect is the case, as in the Great\r\nChagos Bank, in the Indian Ocean; not coloured.—_Scarborough Shoal_:\r\nthis coral-shoal is engraved with a double row of crosses, forming a\r\ncircle, as if there was deep water within the reef: close outside there\r\nwas no bottom, with a hundred fathoms; coloured blue.—The sea off the\r\nwest coast of Palawan and the northern part of Borneo is strewed with\r\nshoals: _Swallow Shoal_, according to Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 431) “is\r\nformed, _like most_ of the shoals hereabouts, of a belt of coral-rocks,\r\n“with a basin of deep water within.”—_Half-Moon Shoal_ has a similar\r\nstructure; Captain D. Ross describes it, as a narrow belt of\r\ncoral-rock, with a basin of deep water in the centre,” and deep sea\r\nclose outside.—_Bombay Shoal_ appears (Horsburgh, vol. ii, p. 432) “to\r\nbe a basin of smooth water surrounded by breakers.” These three shoals\r\nI have coloured blue.—The _Paraquas Shoals_ are of a circular form,\r\nwith deep gaps running through them; not coloured.—A bank gradually\r\nshoaling to the depth of thirty fathoms, extends to a distance of about\r\ntwenty miles from the northern part of _Borneo_, and to thirty miles\r\nfrom the northern part of _Palawan._ Near the land this bank appears\r\ntolerably free from danger, but a little further out it is thickly\r\nstudded with coral-shoals, which do not generally rise quite to the\r\nsurface; some of them are very steep-to, and others have a fringe of\r\nshoal-water round them. I should have thought that these shoals had\r\nlevel surfaces, had it not been for the statement made by Horsburgh\r\n“that most of the shoals hereabouts are formed of a belt of coral.”\r\nBut, perhaps that expression was more particularly applied to the\r\nshoals further in the offing. If these reefs of coral have a\r\nlagoon-like structure, they should have been coloured blue, and they\r\nwould have formed an imperfect barrier in front of Palawan and the\r\nnorthern part of Borneo. But, as the water\r\nis not very deep, these reefs may have grown up from inequalities on\r\nthe bank: I have not coloured them.—The coast of _China, Tonquin_, and\r\n_Cochin-China_, forming the western boundary of the China Sea, appear\r\nto be without reefs: with regard to the two last-mentioned coasts, I\r\nspeak after examining the charts on a large scale in the “Atlas of the\r\nVoyage of the _ Favourite_.”\r\n\r\nINDIAN OCEAN.—_South Keeling_ atoll has been specially described. Nine\r\nmiles north of it lies North Keeling, a very small atoll, surveyed by\r\nthe _ Beagle_, the lagoon of which is dry at low water.—_Christmas\r\nIsland_, lying to the east, is a high island, without, as I have been\r\ninformed by a person who passed it, any reefs at all.—CEYLON: a space\r\nabout eighty miles in length of the south-western and southern shores\r\nof these islands has been described by Mr. Twynam (_Naut. Mag._ 1836,\r\npp. 365 and 518); parts of this space appear to be very regularly\r\nfringed by coral-reefs, which extend from a quarter to half a mile from\r\nthe shore. These reefs are in places breached, and afford safe\r\nanchorage for the small trading craft. Outside, the sea gradually\r\ndeepens; there is forty fathoms about six miles off shore: this part I\r\nhave coloured red. In the published charts of Ceylon there appear to be\r\nfringing-reefs in several parts of the south-eastern shores, which I\r\nhave also coloured red.—At Venloos Bay the shore is likewise fringed.\r\nNorth of Trincomalee there are also reefs of the same kind. The sea off\r\nthe northern part of Ceylon is exceedingly shallow; and therefore I\r\nhave not coloured the reefs which fringe portions of its shores, and\r\nthe adjoining islets, as well as the Indian promontory of _Madura._\r\n\r\nCHAGOS, MALDIVA, AND LACCADIVE ARCHIPELAGOES.—These three great groups\r\nwhich have already been often noticed, are now well-known from the\r\nadmirable surveys of Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell. The\r\npublished charts, which are worthy of the most attentive examination,\r\nat once show that the _Chagos_ and _Maldiva_ groups are entirely formed\r\nof great atolls, or lagoon-formed reefs, surmounted by islets. In the\r\n_Laccadive_ group, this structure is less evident; the islets are low,\r\nnot exceeding the usual height of coral-formations (see Lieutenant\r\nWood’s account, _Geograph. Journ._, vol. vi, p. 29), and most of the\r\nreefs are circular, as may be seen in the published charts; and within\r\nseveral of them, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, there is deepish\r\nwater; these, therefore, have been coloured blue. Directly north, and\r\nalmost forming part of this group, there is a long, narrow, slightly\r\ncurved bank, rising out of the depths of the ocean, composed of sand,\r\nshells, and decayed coral, with from twenty-three to thirty fathoms on\r\nit. I have no doubt that it has had the same origin with the other\r\nLaccadive banks; but as it does not deepen towards the centre I have\r\nnot coloured it. I might have referred to other authorities regarding\r\nthese three archipelagoes; but after the publication of the charts by\r\nCaptain Moresby, to whose personal kindness in giving me much\r\ninformation I am exceedingly indebted, it would have been superfluous.\r\n\r\n_Sahia de Malha_ bank consists of a series of narrow banks, with from\r\neight to sixteen fathoms on them; they are arranged in a semicircular\r\nmanner, round a space about forty fathoms deep, which slopes on the\r\nS.E. quarter to unfathomable depths; they are steep-to on both sides,\r\nbut more especially on the ocean-side. Hence this bank closely\r\nresembles in structure, and I may add from Captain Moresby’s\r\ninformation in composition, the Pitt’s Bank in the Chagos group; and\r\nthe Pitt’s Bank, must, after what has been shown of the Great Chagos\r\nBank, be considered as a sunken, half-destroyed atoll; hence coloured\r\nblue.—_Cargados Carajos Bank._ Its southern portion consists of a\r\nlarge, curved, coral-shoal, with some low islets on its eastern edge,\r\nand likewise some on the western side, between which there is a depth\r\nof about twelve fathoms. Northward, a great bank extends. I cannot\r\n(probably owing to the want of perfect charts) refer this reef and bank\r\nto any class;—therefore not coloured.—_Ile de Sable_ is a little\r\nisland, lying west of C. Carajos, only some toises in height (“Voyage\r\nof the _Favourite_,” vol. i, p. 130); it is surrounded by reefs; but\r\nits structure is unintelligible to me. There are some small banks north\r\nof it, of which I can find no clear account.—_Mauritius._ The reefs\r\nround this island have been described in the chapter on fringing-reefs;\r\ncoloured red.—_Rodriguez._ The coral-reefs here are exceedingly\r\nextensive; in one part they project even five miles from the shore. As\r\nfar as I can make out, there is no deep-water moat within them; and the\r\nsea outside does not deepen very suddenly. The outline, however, of the\r\nland appears to be (“Life of Sir J. Makintosh,” vol. ii, p. 165) hilly\r\nand rugged. I am unable to decide whether these reefs belong to the\r\nbarrier class; as seems probable from their great extension, or to the\r\nfringing class; uncoloured.—_Bourbon._ The greater part of the shores\r\nof this island are without reefs; but Captain Carmichael (Hooker’s\r\n“Bot. Misc.”) states that a portion, fifteen miles in length, on the\r\nS.E. side, is imperfectly fringed with coral reefs: I have not thought\r\nthis sufficient to colour the island.\r\n\r\nSEYCHELLES.—The rocky islands of primary formation, composing this\r\ngroup, rise from a very extensive and tolerably level bank, having a\r\ndepth between twenty and forty fathoms. In Captain Owen’s chart, and in\r\nthat in the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _Favourite_,” it appears that\r\nthe east side of _Mahe_ and the adjoining islands of _St. Anne_ and _\r\nCerf_, are regularly fringed by coral-reefs. A portion of the S.E. part\r\nof _Curieuse Island_, the N., and part of the S.W. shore of _Praslin\r\nIsland_, and the whole west side of _Digue Island_, appear fringed.\r\nFrom a MS. account of these islands by Captain F. Moresby, in the\r\nAdmiralty, it appears that _ Silhouette_ is also fringed; he states\r\nthat all these islands are formed of granite and quartz, that they rise\r\nabruptly from the sea, and that “coral-reefs have grown round them, and\r\nproject for some distance.” Dr. Allan, of Forres, who visited these\r\nislands, informs me that there is no deep water between the reefs and\r\nthe shore. The above specified points have been coloured red. _\r\nAmirantes Islands_: The small islands of this neighbouring group,\r\naccording to the MS. account of them by Captain F. Moresby, are\r\nsituated on an extensive bank; they consist of the debris of corals and\r\nshells; are only about twenty feet in height, and are environed by\r\nreefs, some attached to the shore, and some rather distant from it.—I\r\nhave taken great pains to procure plans and\r\ninformation regarding the several islands lying between S.E. and S.W.\r\nof the Amirantes, and the Seychelles; relying chiefly on Captain F.\r\nMoresby and Dr. Allan, it appears that the greater number,\r\nnamely—_Platte, Alphonse, Coetivi, Galega, Providence, St. Pierre,\r\nAstova, Assomption_, and _ Glorioso_, are low, formed of sand or\r\ncoral-rock, and irregularly shaped; they are situated on very extensive\r\nbanks, and are connected with great coral-reefs. Galega is said by Dr.\r\nAllan, to be rather higher than the other islands; and St. Pierre is\r\ndescribed by Captain F. Moresby, as being cavernous throughout, and as\r\nnot consisting of either limestone or granite. These islands, as well\r\nas the Amirantes, certainly are not atoll-formed, and they differ as a\r\ngroup from every other group with which I am acquainted; I have not\r\ncoloured them; but probably the reefs belong to the fringing class.\r\nTheir formation is attributed, both by Dr. Allan and Captain F.\r\nMoresby, to the action of the currents, here exceedingly violent, on\r\nbanks, which no doubt have had an independent geological origin. They\r\nresemble in many respects some islands and banks in the West Indies,\r\nwhich owe their origin to a similar agency, in conjunction with an\r\nelevation of the entire area. In close vicinity to the several islands,\r\nthere are three others of an apparently different nature: first, _Juan\r\nde Nova_, which appears from some plans and accounts to be an atoll;\r\nbut from others does not appear to be so; not coloured. Secondly\r\n_Cosmoledo_; “this group consists of a ring of coral, ten leagues in\r\ncircumference, and a quarter of a mile broad in some places, enclosing\r\na magnificent lagoon, into which there did not appear a single opening”\r\n(Horsburgh, vol. i, p. 151); coloured blue. Thirdly, _Aldabra_; it\r\nconsists of three islets, about twenty-five feet in height, with red\r\ncliffs (Horsburgh, vol. i, p. 176) surrounding a very shallow basin or\r\nlagoon. The sea is profoundly deep close to the shore. Viewing this\r\nisland in a chart, it would be thought an atoll; but the foregoing\r\ndescription shows that there is something different in its nature; Dr.\r\nAllan also states that it is cavernous, and that the coral-rock has a\r\nvitrified appearance. Is it an upheaved atoll, or the crater of a\r\nvolcano?—uncoloured.\r\n\r\nCOMORO GROUP.—_Mayotta_, according to Horsburgh (vol. i, p. 216, 4th\r\ned.), is completely surrounded by a reef, which runs at the distance of\r\nthree, four, and in some places even five miles from the land; in an\r\nold chart, published by Dalrymple, a depth in many places of thirty-six\r\nand thirty-eight fathoms is laid down within the reef. In the same\r\nchart, the space of open water within the reef in some parts is even\r\nmore than three miles wide: the land is bold and peaked; this island,\r\ntherefore, is encircled by a well-characterised barrier-reef, and is\r\ncoloured pale blue.—_Johanna_; Horsburgh says (vol. i, p. 217) this\r\nisland from the N.W. to the S.W. point, is bounded by a reef, at the\r\ndistance of two miles from the shore; in some parts, however, the reef\r\nmust be attached, since Lieutenant Boteler (“Narr.” vol. i, p. 161)\r\ndescribes a passage through it, within which there is room only for a\r\nfew boats. Its height, as I am informed by Dr. Allan, is about 3,500\r\nfeet; it is very precipitous, and is composed of granite, greenstone,\r\nand quartz; coloured blue.—_Mohilla_; on the S. side of this island\r\nthere is\r\nanchorage, in from thirty to forty-five fathoms, between a reef and the\r\nshore (Horsburgh, vol. i, p. 214); in Captain Owen’s chart of\r\nMadagascar, this island is represented as encircled; coloured\r\nblue.—_Great Comoro Island_ is, as I am informed by Dr. Allan, about\r\n8,000 feet high, and apparently volcanic; it is not regularly\r\nencircled; but reefs of various shapes and dimensions, jut out from\r\nevery headland on the W., S., and S.E. coasts, inside of which reefs\r\nthere are channels, often parallel with the shore, with deep water. On\r\nthe north-western coasts the reefs appear attached to the shores. The\r\nland near the coast is in some places bold, but generally speaking it\r\nis flat; Horsburgh says (vol. i, p. 214) the water is profoundly deep\r\nclose to the _shore_, from which expression I presume some parts are\r\nwithout reefs. From this description I apprehend the reef belongs to\r\nthe barrier class; but I have not coloured it, as most of the charts\r\nwhich I have seen, represent the reefs round it as very much less\r\nextensive than round the other islands in the group.\r\n\r\nMADAGASCAR.—My information is chiefly derived from the published charts\r\nby Captain Owen, and the accounts given by him and by Lieutenant\r\nBoteler. Commencing at the S.W. extremity of the island; towards the\r\nnorthern part of the _Star Bank_ (in lat. 25° S.) the coast for ten\r\nmiles is fringed by a reef; coloured red. The shore immediately S. of\r\n_St. Augustine’s Bay_ appears fringed; but _Tullear_ Harbour, directly\r\nN. of it, is formed by a narrow reef ten miles long, extending parallel\r\nto the shore, with from four to ten fathoms within it. If this reef had\r\nbeen more extensive, it must have been classed as a barrier-reef; but\r\nas the line of coast falls inwards here, a submarine bank perhaps\r\nextends parallel to the shore, which has offered a foundation for the\r\ngrowth of the coral; I have left this part uncoloured. From lat. 22°\r\n16′ to 21° 37′, the shore is fringed by coral-reefs (see Lieutenant\r\nBoteler’s “Narrative,” vol. ii, p. 106), less than a mile in width, and\r\nwith shallow water within. There are outlying coral-shoals in several\r\nparts of the offing, with about ten fathoms between them and the shore,\r\nand the depth of the sea one mile and a half seaward, is about thirty\r\nfathoms. The part above specified is engraved on a large scale; and as\r\nin the charts on rather a smaller scale the same fringe of reef extends\r\nas far as lat. 33° 15′; I have coloured the whole of this part of the\r\ncoast red. The islands of _Juan de Nova_ (in lat. 17° S.) appear in the\r\ncharts on a large scale to be fringed, but I have not been able to\r\nascertain whether the reefs are of coral; uncoloured. The main part of\r\nthe west coast appears to be low, with outlying sandbanks, which,\r\nLieutenant Boteler (vol. ii, p. 106) says, “are faced on the edge of\r\ndeep water by a line of sharp-pointed coral-rocks.” Nevertheless I have\r\nnot coloured this part, as I cannot make out by the charts that the\r\ncoast itself is fringed. The headlands of _Narrenda_ and _Passandava_\r\nBays (14° 40′) and the islands in front of _Radama Harbour_ are\r\nrepresented in the plans as regularly fringed, and have accordingly\r\nbeen coloured red. With respect to the _East coast of Madagascar_, Dr.\r\nAllan informs me in a letter, that the whole line of coast, from\r\n_Tamatave_, in 18° 12′, to _C. Amber_, at the extreme northern point of\r\nthe island, is bordered by coral-reefs. The land is low, uneven,\r\nand gradually rising from the coast. From Captain Owen’s charts, also,\r\nthe existence of these reefs, which evidently belong to the fringing\r\nclass, on some parts, namely N. of _British Sound_, and near _Ngoncy_,\r\nof the above line of coast might have been inferred. Lieutenant Boteler\r\n(vol. i, p. 155) speaks of “the reef surrounding the island of _St.\r\nMary’s_ at a small distance from the shore.” In a previous chapter I\r\nhave described, from the information of Dr. Allan, the manner in which\r\nthe reefs extend in N.E. lines from the headlands on this coast, thus\r\nsometimes forming rather deep channels within them, this seems caused\r\nby the action of the currents, and the reefs spring up from the\r\nsubmarine prolongations of the sandy headlands. The above specified\r\nportion of the coast is coloured red. The remaining S.E. portions do\r\nnot appear in any published chart to possess reefs of any kind; and the\r\nRev. W. Ellis, whose means of information regarding this side of\r\nMadagascar have been extensive, informs me he believes there are none.\r\n\r\nEAST COAST OF AFRICA.—Proceeding from the northern part, the coast\r\nappears, for a considerable space, without reefs. My information, I may\r\nhere observe, is derived from the survey by Captain Owen, together with\r\nhis narrative; and that by Lieutenant Boteler. At _Mukdeesha_ (10° 1′\r\nN.) there is a coral-reef extending four or five miles along the shore\r\n(Owen’s “Narr.” vol. i, p. 357) which in the chart lies at the distance\r\nof a quarter of a mile from the shore, and has within it from six to\r\nten feet water: this then is a fringing-reef, and is coloured red. From\r\n_ Juba_, a little S. of the equator, to _Lamoo_ (in 2° 20′ S.) “the\r\ncoast and islands are formed of madrepore” (Owen’s “Narrative,” vol. i,\r\np. 363). The chart of this part (entitled _ Dundas Islands_), presents\r\nan extraordinary appearance; the coast of the mainland is quite\r\nstraight and it is fronted at the average distance of two miles, by\r\nexceedingly narrow, straight islets, fringed with reefs. Within the\r\nchain of islets, there are extensive tidal flats and muddy bays, into\r\nwhich many rivers enter; the depths of these spaces varies from one to\r\nfour fathoms—the latter depth not being common, and about twelve feet\r\nthe average. Outside the chain of islets, the sea, at the distance of a\r\nmile, varies in depth from eight to fifteen fathoms. Lieutenant Boteler\r\n(“Narr.,” vol. i, p. 369) describes the muddy bay of _Patta_, which\r\nseems to resemble other parts of this coast, as fronted by small,\r\nnarrow, level islets formed of decomposing coral, the margin of which\r\nis seldom of greater height than twelve feet, overhanging the rocky\r\nsurface from which the islets rise. Knowing that the islets are formed\r\nof coral, it is, I think, scarcely possible to view the coast, and not\r\nat once conclude that we here see a fringing-reef, which has been\r\nupraised a few feet: the unusual depth of from two to four fathoms\r\nwithin some of these islets, is probably due to muddy rivers having\r\nprevented the growth of coral near the shore. There is, however, one\r\ndifficulty on this view, namely, that before the elevation took place,\r\nwhich converted the reef into a chain of islets, the water must\r\napparently have been still deeper; on the other hand it may be supposed\r\nthat the formation of a nearly perfect barrier in front, of so large an\r\nextent of coast, would cause the currents (especially in front of the\r\nrivers), to deepen their muddy beds. When describing in\r\nthe chapter on fringing-reefs, those of Mauritius, I have given my\r\nreasons for believing that the shoal spaces within reefs of this kind,\r\nmust, in many instances, have been deepened. However this may be, as\r\nseveral parts of this line of coast are undoubtedly fringed by living\r\nreefs, I have coloured it red.—_Maleenda_ (3° 20′ S.). In the plan of\r\nthe harbour, the south headland appears fringed; and in Owen’s chart on\r\na larger scale, the reefs are seen to extend nearly thirty miles\r\nsouthward; coloured red.—_Mombas_ (4° 5′ S.). The island which forms\r\nthe harbour, “is surrounded by cliffs of madrepore, capable of being\r\nrendered almost impregnable” (Owen’s “Narr.,” vol. i, p. 412). The\r\nshore of the mainland N. and S. of the harbour, is most regularly\r\nfringed by a coral-reef at a distance from half a mile to one mile and\r\na quarter from the land; within the reef the depth is from nine to\r\nfifteen feet; outside the reef the depth at rather less than half a\r\nmile is thirty fathoms. From the charts it appears that a space about\r\nthirty-six miles in length, is here fringed; coloured red.—_Pemba_ (5°\r\nS.) is an island of coral-formation, level, and about two hundred feet\r\nin height (Owen’s “Narr.,” vol. i, p. 425); it is thirty-five miles\r\nlong, and is separated from the mainland by a deep sea. The outer coast\r\nis represented in the chart as regularly fringed; coloured red. The\r\nmainland in front of Pemba is likewise fringed; but there also appear\r\nto be some outlying reefs with deep water between them and the shore. I\r\ndo not understand their structure, either from the charts or the\r\ndescription, therefore have not coloured them.—_Zanzibar_ resembles\r\nPemba in most respects; its southern half on the western side and the\r\nneighbouring islets are fringed; coloured red. On the mainland, a\r\nlittle S. of Zanzibar, there are some banks parallel to the coast,\r\nwhich I should have thought had been formed of coral, had it not been\r\nsaid (Boteler’s “Narr.,” vol. ii, p. 39) that they were composed of\r\nsand; not coloured.—_Latham’s Bank_ is a small island, fringed by\r\ncoral-reefs; but being only ten feet high, it has not been\r\ncoloured.—_Monfeea_ is an island of the same character as Pemba; its\r\nouter shore is fringed, and its southern extremity is connected with\r\nKeelwa Point on the mainland by a chain of islands fringed by reefs;\r\ncoloured red. The four last-mentioned islands resemble in many respects\r\nsome of the islands in the Red Sea, which will presently be\r\ndescribed.—_Keelwa._ In a plan of the shore, a space of twenty miles N.\r\nand S. of this place is fringed by reefs, apparently of coral: these\r\nreefs are prolonged still further southward in Owen’s general chart.\r\nThe coast in the plans of the rivers _Lindy_ and _Monghow_ (9° 59′ and\r\n10° 7′ S.) has the same structure; coloured red.—_Querimba Islands_\r\n(from 10° 40′ to 13° S.). A chart on a large scale is given of these\r\nislands; they are low, and of coral-formation (Boteler’s “Narr.,” vol.\r\nii, p. 54); and generally have extensive reefs projecting from them\r\nwhich are dry at low water, and which on the outside rise abruptly from\r\na deep sea: on their insides they are separated from the continent by a\r\nchannel, or rather a succession of bays, with an average depth of ten\r\nfathoms. The small headlands on the continent also have coral-banks\r\nattached to them; and the Querimba islands and banks are placed on the\r\nlines of prolongation of these headlands, and are\r\nseparated from them by very shallow channels. It is evident that\r\nwhatever cause, whether the drifting of sediment or subterranean\r\nmovements, produced the headlands, likewise produced, as might have\r\nbeen expected, submarine prolongations to them; and these towards their\r\nouter extremities, have since afforded a favourable basis for the\r\ngrowth of coral-reefs, and subsequently for the formation of islets. As\r\nthese reefs clearly belong to the fringing class, the Querimba islands\r\nhave been coloured red.—_Monabila_ (13° 32′ S.). In the plan of this\r\nharbour, the headlands outside are fringed by reefs apparently of\r\ncoral; coloured red.—_Mozambique_ (150° S.) The outer part of the\r\nisland on which the city is built, and the neighbouring islands, are\r\nfringed by coral-reefs; coloured red. From the description given in\r\nOwen’s “Narr.” (vol. i, p. 162), the shore from _ Mozambique_ to\r\n_Delagoa Bay_ appears to be low and sandy; many of the shoals and\r\nislets off this line of coast are of coral-formation; but from their\r\nsmall size and lowness, it is not possible, from the charts, to know\r\nwhether they are truly fringed. Hence this portion of coast is left\r\nuncoloured, as are likewise those parts more northward, of which no\r\nmention has been made in the foregoing pages from the want of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nPERSIAN GULF.—From the charts lately published on a large scale by the\r\nEast India Company, it appears that several parts, especially the\r\nsouthern shores of this gulf, are fringed by coral-reefs; but as the\r\nwater is very shallow, and as there are numerous sandbanks, which are\r\ndifficult to distinguish on the chart from reefs, I have not coloured\r\nthe upper part red. Towards the mouth, however, where the water is\r\nrather deeper, the islands of _Ormuz_ and _Larrack_, appear so\r\nregularly fringed, that I have coloured them red. There are certainly\r\nno atolls in the Persian Gulf. The shores of _ Immaum_, and of the\r\npromontory forming the southern headland of the Persian Gulf, seem to\r\nbe without reefs. The whole S.W. part (except one or two small patches)\r\nof _Arabia Felix_, and the shores of _Socotra_ appear from the charts\r\nand memoir of Captain Haines (_Geograph. Journ._, 1839, p. 125) to be\r\nwithout any reefs. I believe there are no extensive coral-reefs on any\r\npart of the coasts of _India_, except on the low promontory of _Madura_\r\n(as already mentioned) in front of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nRED SEA.—My information is chiefly derived from the admirable charts\r\npublished by the East India Company in 1836, from personal\r\ncommunication with Captain Moresby, one of the surveyors, and from the\r\nexcellent memoir, “Über die Natur der Corallen-Bänken des Rothen\r\nMeeres,” by Ehrenberg. The plains immediately bordering the Red Sea\r\nseem chiefly to consist of a sedimentary formation of the newer\r\ntertiary period. The shore is, with the exception of a few parts,\r\nfringed by coral-reefs. The water is generally profoundly deep close to\r\nthe shore; but this fact, which has attracted the attention of most\r\nvoyagers, seems to have no necessary connection with the presence of\r\nreefs; for Captain Moresby particularly observed to me, that, in lat.\r\n24° 10′ on the eastern side, there is a piece of coast, with very deep\r\nwater close to it, without any reefs, but not differing in other\r\nrespects from the usual nature of the coast-line. The most remarkable\r\nfeature in the Red Sea\r\nis the chain of submerged banks, reefs, and islands, lying some way\r\nfrom the shore, chiefly on the eastern side; the space within being\r\ndeep enough to admit a safe navigation in small vessels. The banks are\r\ngenerally of an oval form, and some miles in width; but some of them\r\nare very long in proportion to their width. Captain Moresby informs me\r\nthat any one, who had not made actual plans of them, would be apt to\r\nthink that they were much more elongated than they really are. Many of\r\nthem rise to the surface, but the greater number lie from five to\r\nthirty fathoms beneath it, with irregular soundings on them. They\r\nconsist of sand and living coral; coral on most of them, according to\r\nCaptain Moresby, covering the greater part of their surface. They\r\nextend parallel to the shore, and they are not unfrequently connected\r\nin their middle parts by short transverse banks with the mainland. The\r\nsea is generally profoundly deep quite close to them, as it is near\r\nmost parts of the coast of the mainland; but this is not universally\r\nthe case, for between lat. 15° and 17° the water deepens quite\r\ngradually from the banks, both on the eastern and western shores,\r\ntowards the middle of the sea. Islands in many parts arise from these\r\nbanks; they are low, flat-topped, and consist of the same horizontally\r\nstratified formation with that forming the plain-like margin of the\r\nmainland. Some of the smaller and lower islands consist of mere sand.\r\nCaptain Moresby informs me, that small masses of rock, the remnants of\r\nislands, are left on many banks where there is now no dry land.\r\nEhrenberg also asserts that most of the islets, even the lowest, have a\r\nflat abraded basis, composed of the same tertiary formation: he\r\nbelieves that as soon as the surf wears down the protuberant parts of a\r\nbank, just beneath the level of the sea, the surface becomes protected\r\nfrom further abrasion by the growth of coral, and he thus accounts for\r\nthe existence of so many banks standing on a level with the surface of\r\nthis sea. It appears that most of the islands are certainly decreasing\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nThe form of the banks and islands is most singular in the part just\r\nreferred to, namely, from lat. 15° to 17°, where the sea deepens quite\r\ngradually: the _Dhalac_ group, on the western coast, is surrounded by\r\nan intricate archipelago of islets and shoals; the main island is very\r\nirregularly shaped, and it includes a bay seven miles long, by four\r\nacross, in which no bottom was found with 252 feet: there is only one\r\nentrance into this bay, half a mile wide, and with an island in front\r\nof it. The submerged banks on the eastern coast, within the same\r\nlatitudes, round _ Farsan Island_, are, likewise, penetrated by many\r\nnarrow creeks of deep water; one is twelve miles long, in the form of a\r\nhatchet, in which, close to its broad upper end, soundings were not\r\nstruck with 360 feet, and its entrance is only half a mile wide: in\r\nanother creek of the same nature, but even with a more irregular\r\noutline, there was no bottom with 480 feet. The island of Farsan,\r\nitself, has as singular a form as any of its surrounding banks. The\r\nbottom of the sea round the Dhalac and Farsan Islands consists chiefly\r\nof sand and agglutinated fragments, but, in the deep and narrow creeks,\r\nit consists of mud; the islands themselves consist of thin,\r\nhorizontally stratified, modern tertiary\r\nbeds, containing but little broken coral,[2] their shores are fringed\r\nby living coral-reefs.\r\n\r\n [2] Rüppell, “Reise in Abyssinie,” Band. i, S. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the account given by Rüppell[3] of the manner in which Dhalac has\r\nbeen rent by fissures, the opposite sides of which have been unequally\r\nelevated (in one instance to the amount of fifty feet), it seems\r\nprobable that its irregular form, as well as probably that of Farsan,\r\nmay have been partly caused by unequal elevations; but, considering the\r\ngeneral form of the banks, and of the deep-water creeks, together with\r\nthe composition of the land, I think their configuration is more\r\nprobably due in great part to strong currents having drifted sediment\r\nover an uneven bottom: it is almost certain that their form cannot be\r\nattributed to the growth of coral. Whatever may have been the precise\r\norigin of the Dhalac and Farsan Archipelagoes, the greater number of\r\nthe banks on the eastern side of the Red Sea seem to have originated\r\nthrough nearly similar means. I judge of this from their similarity in\r\nconfiguration (in proof of which I may instance a bank on the east\r\ncoast in lat. 22°; and although it is true that the northern banks\r\ngenerally have a less complicated outline), and from their similarity\r\nin composition, as may be observed in their upraised portions. The\r\ndepth within the banks northward of lat. 17°, is usually greater, and\r\ntheir outer sides shelve more abruptly (circumstances which seem to go\r\ntogether) than in the Dhalac and Farsan Archipelagoes; but this might\r\neasily have been caused by a difference in the action of the currents\r\nduring their formation: moreover, the greater quantity of living coral,\r\nwhich, according to Captain Moresby, exists on the northern banks,\r\nwould tend to give them steeper margins.\r\n\r\n [3] _Ibid_., S. 245.\r\n\r\nFrom this account, brief and imperfect as it is, we can see that the\r\ngreat chain of banks on the eastern coast, and on the western side in\r\nthe southern portion, differ greatly from true barrier-reefs wholly\r\nformed by the growth of coral. It is indeed the direct conclusion of\r\nEhrenberg (“Über die,” etc., pp. 45 and 51), that they are connected in\r\ntheir origin quite secondarily with the growth of coral; and he remarks\r\nthat the islands off the coast of Norway, if worn down level with the\r\nsea, and merely coated with living coral, would present a nearly\r\nsimilar appearance. I cannot, however, avoid suspecting, from\r\ninformation given me by Dr. Malcolmson and Captain Moresby, that\r\nEhrenberg has rather under-rated the influence of corals, in some\r\nplaces at least, on the formation of the tertiary deposits of the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n_The west coast of the Red Sea between lat. 19° and 22°._—There are, in\r\nthis space, reefs, which, if I had known nothing of those in other\r\nparts of the Red Sea, I should unhesitatingly have considered as\r\nbarrier-reefs; and, after deliberation, I have come to the same\r\nconclusion. One of these reefs, in 20° 15′, is twenty miles long, less\r\nthan a mile in width (but expanding at the northern end into a disc),\r\nslightly sinuous, and extending parallel to the mainland at the\r\ndistance of five miles from it, with very deep water within; in one\r\nspot soundings were not obtained with 205 fathoms. Some leagues further\r\nsouth, there is another linear reef, very narrow, ten miles long, with\r\nother small portions\r\nof reef, north and south, almost connected with it; and within this\r\nline of reefs (as well as outside) the water is profoundly deep. There\r\nare also some small linear and sickle-formed reefs, lying a little way\r\nout at sea. All these reefs are covered, as I am informed by Captain\r\nMoresby, by living corals. Here, then, we have all the characters of\r\nreefs of the barrier class; and in some outlying reefs we have an\r\napproach to the structure of atolls. The source of my doubts about the\r\nclassification of these reefs, arises from having observed in the\r\nDhalac and Farsan groups the narrowness and straightness of several\r\nspits of sand and rock: one of these spits in the Dhalac group is\r\nnearly fifteen miles long, only two broad, and it is bordered on each\r\nside with deep water; so that, if worn down by the surf, and coated\r\nwith living corals, it would form a reef nearly similar to those within\r\nthe space under consideration. There is, also, in this space (lat. 21°)\r\na peninsula, bordered by cliffs, with its extremity worn down to the\r\nlevel of the sea, and its basis fringed with reefs: in the line of\r\nprolongation of this peninsula, there lies the island of _ Macowa_\r\n(formed, according to Captain Moresby, of the usual tertiary deposit),\r\nand some smaller islands, large parts of which likewise appear to have\r\nbeen worn down, and are now coated with living corals. If the removal\r\nof the strata in these several cases had been more complete, the reefs\r\nthus formed would have nearly resembled those barrier-like ones now\r\nunder discussion. Notwithstanding these facts, I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat the many very small, isolated, and sickle-formed reefs and others,\r\nlong, nearly straight, and very narrow, with the water unfathomably\r\ndeep close round them, could possibly have been formed by corals merely\r\ncoating banks of sediment, or the abraded surfaces of irregularly\r\nshaped islands. I feel compelled to believe that the foundations of\r\nthese reefs have subsided, and that the corals, during their upward\r\ngrowth, have given to these reefs their present forms: I may remark\r\nthat the subsidence of narrow and irregularly-shaped peninsulas and\r\nislands, such as those existing on the coasts of the Red Sea, would\r\nafford the requisite foundations for the reefs in question.\r\n\r\n_The west coast from lat. 22° to 24°._—This part of the coast (north of\r\nthe space coloured blue on the map) is fronted by an irregularly\r\nshelving bank, from about ten to thirty fathoms deep; numerous little\r\nreefs, some of which have the most singular shapes, rise from this\r\nbank. It may be observed, respecting one of them, in lat. 23° 10′, that\r\nif the promontory in lat. 24° were worn down to the level of the sea,\r\nand coated with corals, a very similar and grotesquely formed reef\r\nwould be produced. Many of the reefs on this part of the coast may thus\r\nhave originated; but there are some sickle, and almost atoll-formed\r\nreefs lying in deep water off the promontory in lat. 24°, which lead me\r\nto suppose that all these reefs are more probably allied to the barrier\r\nor atoll classes. I have not, however, ventured to colour this portion\r\nof coast. _On the west coast from lat. 19° to 17°_ (south of space\r\ncoloured blue on the map), there are many low islets of very small\r\ndimensions, not much elongated, and rising out of great depths at a\r\ndistance from the coast; these cannot be classed either with atolls, or\r\nbarrier- or fringing-reefs. I may here remark that the outlying reefs\r\non the west\r\ncoast, between lat. 19° and 24°, are the only ones in the Red Sea,\r\nwhich approach in structure to the true atolls of the Indian and\r\nPacific Oceans, but they present only imperfect miniature likenesses of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Eastern coast._—I have felt the greatest doubt about colouring any\r\nportion of this coast, north of the fringing-reefs round the Farsan\r\nIslands in 16° 10′. There are many small outlying coral-reefs along the\r\nwhole line of coast; but as the greater number rise from banks not very\r\ndeeply submerged (the formation of which has been shown to be only\r\nsecondarily connected with the growth of coral), their origin may be\r\ndue simply to the growth of knolls of corals, from an irregular\r\nfoundation situated within a limited depth. But between lat. 18° and\r\n20°, there are so many linear, elliptic, and extremely small reefs,\r\nrising abruptly out of profound depths, that the same reasons, which\r\nled me to colour blue a portion of the west coast, have induced me to\r\ndo the same in this part. There exist some small outlying reefs rising\r\nfrom deep water, north of lat. 20° (the northern limit coloured blue),\r\non the east coast; but as they are not very numerous and scarcely any\r\nof them linear, I have thought it right to leave them uncoloured.\r\n\r\nIn the _southern parts_ of the Red Sea, considerable spaces of the\r\nmainland, and of some of the Dhalac islands, are skirted by reefs,\r\nwhich, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, are of living coral, and\r\nhave all the characters of the fringing class. As in these latitudes,\r\nthere are no outlying linear or sickle-formed reefs, rising out of\r\nunfathomable depths, I have coloured these parts of the coast red. On\r\nsimilar grounds, I have coloured red the _northern parts of the western\r\ncoast_ (north of lat. 24° 30′), and likewise the shores of the chief\r\npart of the _Gulf of Suez._ In the _Gulf of Acaba_, as I am informed by\r\nCaptain Moresby there are no coral-reefs, and the water is profoundly\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nWEST INDIES.—My information regarding the reefs of this area, is\r\nderived from various sources, and from an examination of numerous\r\ncharts; especially of those lately executed during the survey under\r\nCaptain Owen, R.N. I lay under particular obligation to Captain Bird\r\nAllen, R.N., one of the members of the late survey, for many personal\r\ncommunications on this subject. As in the case of the Red Sea, it is\r\nnecessary to make some preliminary remarks on the submerged banks of\r\nthe West Indies, which are in some degree connected with coral-reefs,\r\nand cause considerable doubts in their classification. That large\r\naccumulations of sediment are in progress on the West Indian shores,\r\nwill be evident to any one who examines the charts of that sea,\r\nespecially of the portion north of a line joining Yucutan and Florida.\r\nThe area of deposition seems less intimately connected with the\r\ndebouchement of the great rivers, than with the course of the\r\nsea-currents; as is evident from the vast extension of the banks from\r\nthe promontories of Yucutan and Mosquito.\r\n\r\nBesides the coast-banks, there are many of various dimensions which\r\nstand quite isolated; these closely resemble each other, they lie from\r\ntwo or three to twenty or thirty fathoms under water, and are composed\r\nof sand, sometimes firmly agglutinated, with little or no coral; their\r\nsurfaces are smooth and nearly level, shelving only to the amount of a\r\nfew fathoms, very gradually all round towards their edges, where they\r\nplunge abruptly into the unfathomable sea. This steep inclination of\r\ntheir sides, which is likewise characteristic of the coast-banks, is\r\nvery remarkable: I may give as an instance, the Misteriosa Bank, on the\r\nedges of which the soundings change in 250 fathoms horizontal distance,\r\nfrom 11 to 210 fathoms; off the northern point of the bank of Old\r\nProvidence, in 200 fathoms horizontal distance, the change is from 19\r\nto 152 fathoms; off the Great Bahama Bank, in 160 fathoms horizontal\r\ndistance, the inclination is in many places from 10 fathoms to no\r\nbottom with 190 fathoms. On coasts in all parts of the world, where\r\nsediment is accumulating, something of this kind may be observed; the\r\nbanks shelve very gently far out to sea, and then terminate abruptly.\r\nThe form and composition of the banks standing in the middle parts of\r\nthe W. Indian Sea, clearly show that their origin must be chiefly\r\nattributed to the accumulation of sediment; and the only obvious\r\nexplanation of their isolated position is the presence of a nucleus,\r\nround which the currents have collected fine drift matter. Any one who\r\nwill compare the character of the bank surrounding the hilly island of\r\nOld Providence, with those banks in its neighbourhood which stand\r\nisolated, will scarcely doubt that they surround submerged mountains.\r\nWe are led to the same conclusion by examining the bank called Thunder\r\nKnoll, which is separated from the Great Mosquito Bank by a channel\r\nonly seven miles wide, and 145 fathoms deep. There cannot be any doubt\r\nthat the Mosquito Bank has been formed by the accumulation of sediment\r\nround the promontory of the same name; and Thunder Knoll resembles the\r\nMosquito Bank, in the state of its surface submerged twenty fathoms, in\r\nthe inclinations of its sides, in composition, and in every other\r\nrespect. I may observe, although the remark is here irrelevant, that\r\ngeologists should be cautious in concluding that all the outlyers of\r\nany formation have once been connected together, for we here see that\r\ndeposits, doubtless of exactly the same nature, may be deposited with\r\nlarge valley-like spaces between them.\r\n\r\nLinear strips of coral-reefs and small knolls project from many of the\r\nisolated, as well as coast-banks; sometimes they occur quite\r\nirregularly placed, as on the Mosquito Bank, but more generally they\r\nform crescents on the windward side, situated some little distance\r\nwithin the outer edge of the banks:—thus on the Serranilla Bank they\r\nform an interrupted chain which ranges between two and three miles\r\nwithin the windward margin: generally they occur, as on Roncador,\r\nCourtown, and Anegada Banks, nearer the line of deep water. Their\r\noccurrence on the windward side is conformable to the general rule, of\r\nthe efficient kinds of corals flourishing best where most exposed; but\r\ntheir position some way within the line of deep water I cannot explain,\r\nwithout it be, that a depth somewhat less than that close to the outer\r\nmargin of the banks, is most favourable to their growth. Where the\r\ncorals have formed a nearly continuous rim, close to the windward edge\r\nof a bank some fathoms submerged, the reef closely resembles an atoll;\r\nbut if the bank surrounds an island (as in the case of Old Providence),\r\nthe reef resembles an encircling barrier-reef. I should undoubtedly\r\nhave classed some of these fringed banks as imperfect atolls, or\r\nbarrier-reefs, if the sedimentary nature of their foundations had not\r\nbeen evident from the presence of other neighbouring banks, of similar\r\nforms and of similar composition, but without the crescent-like\r\nmarginal reef: in the third chapter, I observed that probably some\r\natoll-like reefs did exist, which had originated in the manner here\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nProofs of elevation within recent tertiary periods abound, as referred\r\nto in the sixth chapter, over nearly the whole area of the West Indies.\r\nHence it is easy to understand the origin of the low land on the\r\ncoasts, where sediment is now accumulating; for instance on the\r\nnorthern part of Yucutan, and on the N.E. part of Mosquito, where the\r\nland is low, and where extensive banks appear to be in progressive\r\nformation. Hence, also, the origin of the Great Bahama Banks, which are\r\nbordered on their western and southern edges by very narrow, long,\r\nsingularly shaped islands, formed of sand, shells, and coral-rock, and\r\nsome of them about a hundred feet in height, is easily explained by the\r\nelevation of banks fringed on their windward (western and southern)\r\nsides by coral-reefs. On this view, however, we must suppose either\r\nthat the chief part of the surfaces of the great Bahama sandbanks were\r\nall originally deeply submerged, and were brought up to their present\r\nlevel by the same elevatory action, which formed the linear islands; or\r\nthat during the elevation of the banks, the superficial currents and\r\nswell of the waves continued wearing them down and keeping them at a\r\nnearly uniform level: the level is not quite uniform; for, in\r\nproceeding from the N.W. end of the Bahama group towards the S.E. end,\r\nthe depth of the banks increases, and the area of land decreases, in a\r\nvery gradual and remarkable manner. The latter view, namely, that these\r\nbanks have been worn down by the currents and swell during their\r\nelevation, seems to me the most probable one. It is, also, I believe,\r\napplicable to many banks, situated in widely distant parts of the West\r\nIndian Sea, which are wholly submerged; for, on any other view, we must\r\nsuppose, that the elevatory forces have acted with astonishing\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the Gulf of Mexico, for the space of many hundred miles,\r\nis formed by a chain of lagoons, from one to twenty miles in breadth\r\n(“Columbian Navigator,” p. 178, etc.), containing either fresh or salt\r\nwater, and separated from the sea by linear strips of sand. Great\r\nspaces of the shores of Southern Brazil,[4] and of the United States\r\nfrom Long Island (as observed by Professor Rogers) to Florida have the\r\nsame character. Professor Rogers, in his “Report to the British\r\nAssociation” (vol. iii, p. 13), speculates on the origin of these low,\r\nsandy, linear islets; he states that the layers of which they are\r\ncomposed are too homogeneous, and contain too large a proportion of\r\nshells, to permit the common supposition of their formation being\r\nsimply due to matter thrown up, where it now lies, by the surf: he\r\nconsiders these islands as upheaved bars or shoals, which were\r\ndeposited in lines where opposed currents met. It is evident that these\r\nislands and spits of sand parallel to the coast, and separated from it\r\nby shallow lagoons, have no necessary connection with coral-formations.\r\nBut in Southern Florida, from the accounts I have received from persons\r\nwho have resided there, the upraised islands seem to be formed of\r\nstrata, containing a good deal of coral, and they are extensively\r\nfringed by living reefs; the channels within these islands are in some\r\nplaces between two and three miles wide, and five or six fathoms deep,\r\nthough generally[5] they are less in depth than width. After having\r\nseen how frequently banks of sediment in the West Indian Sea are\r\nfringed by reefs, we can readily conceive that bars of sediment might\r\nbe greatly aided in their formation along a line of coast, by the\r\ngrowth of corals; and such bars would, in that case, have a deceptive\r\nresemblance with true barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n [4] In the _London and Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,_ 1841, p. 257,\r\n I have described a singular bar of sandstone lying parallel to the\r\n coast off Pernambuco in Brazil, which probably is an analogous\r\n formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] In the ordinary sea-charts, no lagoons appear on the coast of\r\n Florida, north of 26°; but Major Whiting (_Silliman’s Journal_, vol.\r\n xxxv, p. 54) says that many are formed by sand thrown up along the\r\n whole line of coast from St. Augustine’s to Jupiter Inlet.\r\n\r\nHaving now endeavoured to remove some sources of doubt in classifying\r\nthe reefs of the West Indies, I will give my authorities for colouring\r\nsuch portions of the coast as I have thought myself warranted in doing.\r\nCaptain Bird Allen informs me, that most of the islands on the _Bahama\r\nBanks_ are fringed, especially on their windward sides, with living\r\nreefs; and hence I have coloured those, which are thus represented in\r\nCaptain Owen’s late chart, red. The same officer informs me, that the\r\nislands along the southern part of _Florida_ are similarly fringed;\r\ncoloured red. CUBA: Proceeding along the northern coast, at the\r\ndistance of forty miles from the extreme S.E. point, the shores are\r\nfringed by reefs, which extend westward for a space of 160 miles, with\r\nonly a few breaks. Parts of these reefs are represented in the plans of\r\nthe harbours on this coast by Captain Owen; and an excellent\r\ndescription is given of them by Mr. Taylor (Loudon’s “Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.,” vol. ix, p. 449); he states that they enclosed a space called\r\nthe “_baxo_,” from half to three-quarters of a mile in width, with a\r\nsandy bottom, and a little coral. In most parts people can wade, at low\r\nwater, to the reef; but in some parts the depth is between two and\r\nthree fathoms. Close outside the reef, the depth is between six and\r\nseven fathoms; these well-characterised fringing-reefs are coloured\r\nred. Westward of longitude 77° 30′, on the northern side of Cuba, a\r\ngreat bank commences, which extends along the coast for nearly four\r\ndegrees of longitude. In the place of its commencement, in its\r\nstructure, and in the “_cays_,” or low islands on its edge, there is a\r\nmarked correspondence (as observed by Humboldt, “Pers. Narr.,” vol.\r\nvii, p. 88) between it and the Great Bahama and Sal Banks, which lie\r\ndirectly in front. Hence one is led to attribute the same origin to\r\nboth these sets of banks; namely, the accumulation of sediment,\r\nconjoined with an elevatory movement, and the growth of\r\ncoral on their outward edges; those parts which appear fringed by\r\nliving reefs are coloured red. Westward of these banks, there is a\r\nportion of coast apparently without reefs, except in the harbours, the\r\nshores of which seem in the published plans to be fringed. The\r\n_Colorado Shoals_ (see Captain Owen’s charts), and the low land at the\r\nwestern end of Cuba, correspond as closely in relative position and\r\nstructure to the banks at the extreme point of Florida, as the banks\r\nabove described on the north side of Cuba, do to the Bahamas, the depth\r\nwithin the islets and reefs on the outer edge of the _Colorados_, is\r\ngenerally between two and three fathoms, increasing to twelve fathoms\r\nin the southern part, where the bank becomes nearly open, without\r\nislets or coral-reefs; the portions which are fringed are coloured red.\r\nThe southern shore of Cuba is deeply concave, and the included space is\r\nfilled up with mud and sandbanks, low islands and coral-reefs. Between\r\nthe mountainous _Isle of Pines_ and the southern shore of Cuba, the\r\ngeneral depth is only between two and three fathoms; and in this part\r\nsmall islands, formed of fragmentary rock and broken madrepores\r\n(Humboldt, “Pers. Narr.,” vol. vii, pp. 51, 86 to 90, 291, 309, 320),\r\nrise abruptly, and just reach the surface of the sea. From some\r\nexpressions used in the “Columbian Navigator” (vol. i, pt ii, p. 94),\r\nit appears that considerable spaces along the outer coast of Southern\r\nCuba are bounded by cliffs of coral-rock, formed probably by the\r\nupheaval of coral-reefs and sandbanks. The charts represent the\r\nsouthern part of the Isle of Pines as fringed by reefs, which the\r\n“Columb. Navig.” says extend some way from the coast, but have only\r\nfrom nine to twelve feet water on them; these are coloured red.—I have\r\nnot been able to procure any detailed description of the large groups\r\nof banks and “cays” further eastward on the southern side of Cuba;\r\nwithin them there is a large expanse, with a muddy bottom, from eight\r\nto twelve fathoms deep; although some parts of this line of coast are\r\nrepresented in the general charts of the West Indies, as fringed, I\r\nhave not thought it prudent to colour them. The remaining portion of\r\nthe south coast of Cuba appears to be without coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nYUCUTAN.—The N.E. part of the promontory appears in Captain Owen’s\r\ncharts to be fringed; coloured red. The eastern coast, from 20° to 18°\r\nis fringed. South of lat. 18°, there commences the most remarkable reef\r\nin the West Indies: it is about one hundred and thirty miles in length,\r\nranging in a N. and S. line, at an average distance of fifteen miles\r\nfrom the coast. The islets on it are all low, as I have been informed\r\nby Captain B. Allen; the water deepens suddenly on the outside of the\r\nreef, but not more abruptly than off many of the sedimentary banks:\r\nwithin its southern extremity (off _Honduras_) the depth is twenty-five\r\nfathoms; but in the more northern parts, the depth soon increases to\r\nten fathoms, and within the northernmost part, for a space of twenty\r\nmiles, the depth is only from one to two fathoms. In most of these\r\nrespects we have the characteristics of a barrier-reef; nevertheless,\r\nfrom observing, first, that the channel within the reef is a\r\ncontinuation of a great irregular bay, which penetrates the mainland to\r\nthe depth of fifty miles; and secondly, that considerable spaces of\r\nthis barrier-like reef are\r\ndescribed in the charts (for instance, in lat. 16° 45′ and 16° 12′) as\r\nformed of pure sand; and thirdly, from knowing that sediment is\r\naccumulating in many parts of the West Indies in banks parallel to the\r\nshore; I have not ventured to colour this reef as a barrier, without\r\nfurther evidence that it has really been formed by the growth of\r\ncorals, and that it is not merely in parts a spit of sand, and in other\r\nparts a worn down promontory, partially coated and fringed by reefs; I\r\nlean, however, to the probability of its being a barrier-reef, produced\r\nby subsidence. To add to my doubts, immediately on the outside of this\r\nbarrier-like reef, _Turneffe, Lighthouse_, and _Glover_ reefs are\r\nsituated, and these reefs have so completely the form of atolls, that\r\nif they had occurred in the Pacific, I should not have hesitated about\r\ncolouring them blue. _Turneffe Reef_ seems almost entirely filled up\r\nwith low mud islets; and the depth within the other two reefs is only\r\nfrom one to three fathoms. From this circumstance and from their\r\nsimilarity in form, structure, and relative position, both to the bank\r\ncalled _Northern Triangles_, on which there is an islet between seventy\r\nand eighty feet, and to _Cozumel_ Island, the level surface of which is\r\nlikewise between seventy and eighty feet in height, I consider it more\r\nprobable that the three foregoing banks are the worn down bases of\r\nupheaved shoals, fringed with corals, than that they are true atolls,\r\nwholly produced by the growth of coral during subsidence; left\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\nIn front of the eastern _Mosquito_ coast, there are between lat. 12°\r\nand 16° some extensive banks (already mentioned, p. 148), with high\r\nislands rising from their centres; and there are other banks wholly\r\nsubmerged, both of which kinds of banks are bordered, near their\r\nwindward margins, by crescent-shaped coral-reefs. But it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, as was observed in the preliminary remarks, that these banks\r\nowe their origin, like the great bank extending from the Mosquito\r\npromontory, almost entirely to the accumulation of sediment, and not to\r\nthe growth of corals; hence I have not coloured them.\r\n\r\n_Cayman Island:_ this island appears in the charts to be fringed; and\r\nCaptain B. Allen informs me that the reefs extend about a mile from the\r\nshore, and have only from five to twelve feet water within them;\r\ncoloured red.—_Jamaica:_ judging from the charts, about fifteen miles\r\nof the S.E. extremity, and about twice that length on the S.W.\r\nextremity, and some portions on the S. side near Kingston and Port\r\nRoyal, are regularly fringed, and therefore are coloured red. From the\r\nplans of some harbours on the N. side of Jamaica, parts of the coast\r\nappear to be fringed; but as these are not represented in the charts of\r\nthe whole island, I have not coloured them.—_St. Domingo:_ I have not\r\nbeen able to obtain sufficient information, either from plans of the\r\nharbours, or from general charts, to enable me to colour any part of\r\nthe coast, except sixty miles from Port de Plata westward, which seems\r\nvery regularly fringed; many other parts, however, of the coast are\r\nprobably fringed, especially towards the eastern end of the\r\nisland.—_Puerto Rico:_ considerable portions of the southern, western,\r\nand eastern coasts, and some parts of the northern coast, appear in the\r\ncharts to be fringed; coloured red.—Some miles in length of the\r\nsouthern side of the Island of _St. Thomas_ is fringed; most of the\r\n_Virgin Gorda_ Islands, as I am informed by Mr. Schomburgk, are\r\nfringed; the shores of _Anegada_, as well as the bank on which it\r\nstands, are likewise fringed; these islands have been coloured red. The\r\ngreater part of the southern side of _Santa Cruz_ appears in the Danish\r\nsurvey to be fringed (see also Prof. Hovey’s account of this island, in\r\n_Silliman’s Journal_, vol. xxxv, p. 74); the reefs extend along the\r\nshore for a considerable space, and project rather more than a mile;\r\nthe depth within the reef is three fathoms; coloured red.—The _\r\nAntilles_, as remarked by Von Buch (“Descrip. Iles Canaries,” p. 494),\r\nmay be divided into two linear groups, the western row being volcanic,\r\nand the eastern of modern calcareous origin; my information is very\r\ndefective on the whole group. Of the eastern islands, _Barbuda_ and the\r\nwestern coasts of _Antigua_ and _Mariagalante_ appear to be fringed:\r\nthis is also the case with _Barbadoes_, as I have been informed by a\r\nresident; these islands are coloured red. On the shores of the Western\r\nAntilles, of volcanic origin, very few coral-reefs appear to exist. The\r\nisland of _Martinique_, of which there are beautifully executed French\r\ncharts, on a very large scale, alone presents any appearance worthy of\r\nspecial notice. The south-western, southern, and eastern coasts,\r\ntogether forming about half the circumference of the island, are\r\nskirted by very irregular banks, projecting generally rather less than\r\na mile from the shore, and lying from two to five fathoms submerged. In\r\nfront of almost every valley, they are breached by narrow, crooked,\r\nsteep-sided passages. The French engineers ascertained by boring, that\r\nthese submerged banks consisted of madreporitic rocks, which were\r\ncovered in many parts by thin layers of mud or sand. From this fact,\r\nand especially from the structure of the narrow breaches, I think there\r\ncan be little doubt that these banks once formed living reefs, which\r\nfringed the shores of the island, and like other reefs probably reached\r\nthe surface. From some of these submerged banks reefs of living coral\r\nrise abruptly, either in small detached patches, or in lines parallel\r\nto, but some way within the outer edges of the banks on which they are\r\nbased. Besides the above banks which skirt the shores of the island,\r\nthere is on the eastern side a range of linear banks, similarly\r\nconstituted, twenty miles in length, extending parallel to the coast\r\nline, and separated from it by a space between two and four miles in\r\nwidth, and from five to fifteen fathoms in depth. From this range of\r\ndetached banks, some linear reefs of living coral likewise rise\r\nabruptly; and if they had been of greater length (for they do not front\r\nmore than a sixth part of the circumference of the island), they would\r\nnecessarily from their position have been coloured as barrier-reefs; as\r\nthe case stands they are left uncoloured. I suspect that after a small\r\namount of subsidence, the corals were killed by sand and mud being\r\ndeposited on them, and the reefs being thus prevented from growing\r\nupwards, the banks of madreporitic rock were left in their present\r\nsubmerged condition.\r\n\r\nTHE BERMUDA ISLANDS have been carefully described by Lieutenant Nelson,\r\nin an excellent Memoir in the “Geological Transactions” (vol. v, part\r\ni, p. 103). In the form of the bank or reef, on one side of which\r\nthe islands stand, there is a close general resemblance to an atoll;\r\nbut in the following respects there is a considerable\r\ndifference,—first, in the margin of the reef not forming (as I have\r\nbeen informed by Mr. Chaffers, R.N.) a flat, solid surface, laid bare\r\nat low water, and regularly bounding the internal space of shallow\r\nwater or lagoon; secondly, in the border of gradually shoaling water,\r\nnearly a mile and a half in width, which surrounds the entire outside\r\nof the reef (as is laid down in Captain Hurd’s chart); and thirdly, in\r\nthe size, height, and extraordinary form of the islands, which present\r\nlittle resemblance to the long, narrow, simple islets, seldom exceeding\r\nhalf a mile in breadth, which surmount the annular reefs of almost all\r\nthe atolls in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Moreover, there are\r\nevident proofs (Nelson, _ Ibid_., p. 118), that islands similar to the\r\nexisting ones, formerly extended over other parts of the reef. It\r\nwould, I believe, be difficult to find a true atoll with land exceeding\r\nthirty feet in height; whereas, Mr. Nelson estimates the highest point\r\nof the Bermuda Islands to be 260 feet; if, however, Mr. Nelson’s view,\r\nthat the whole of the land consists of sand drifted by the winds, and\r\nagglutinated together, were proved correct, this difference would be\r\nimmaterial; but, from his own account (p. 118), there occur in one\r\nplace, five or six layers of red earth, interstratified with the\r\nordinary calcareous rock, and including stones too heavy for the wind\r\nto have moved, without having at the same time utterly dispersed every\r\ngrain of the accompanying drifted matter. Mr. Nelson attributes the\r\norigin of these several layers, with their embedded stones, to as many\r\nviolent catastrophes; but further investigation in such cases has\r\ngenerally succeeded in explaining phenomena of this kind by ordinary\r\nand simpler means. Finally, I may remark, that these islands have a\r\nconsiderable resemblance in shape to Barbuda in the West Indies, and to\r\nPemba on the eastern coast of Africa, which latter island is about two\r\nhundred feet in height, and consists of coral-rock. I believe that the\r\nBermuda Islands, from being fringed by living reefs, ought to have been\r\ncoloured red; but I have left them uncoloured, on account of their\r\ngeneral resemblance in external form to a lagoon-island or atoll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON VOLCANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the series of works published under the general\r\ntitle “Geology of the Voyage of the _Beagle_” occupied a great part of\r\nDarwin’s time during the ten years that followed his return to England.\r\nThe second volume of the series, entitled “Geological Observations on\r\nVolcanic Islands, with Brief Notices on the Geology of Australia and\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope,” made its appearance in 1844. The materials for\r\nthis volume were collected in part during the outward voyage, when the\r\n_Beagle_ called at St. Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands, and St.\r\nPaul’s Rocks, and at Fernando Noronha, but mainly during the homeward\r\ncruise; then it was that the Galapagos Islands were surveyed, the Low\r\nArchipelago passed through, and Tahiti visited; after making calls at\r\nthe Bay of Islands, in New Zealand, and also at Sydney, Hobart Town and\r\nKing George’s Sound in Australia, the _Beagle_ sailed across the Indian\r\nOcean to the little group of the Keeling or Cocos Islands, which Darwin\r\nhas rendered famous by his observations, and thence to Mauritius;\r\ncalling at the Cape of Good Hope on her way, the ship then proceeded\r\nsuccessively to St. Helena and Ascension, and revisited the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands before finally reaching England.\r\n\r\nAlthough Darwin was thus able to gratify his curiosity by visits to a\r\ngreat number of very interesting volcanic districts, the voyage opened\r\nfor him with a bitter disappointment. He had been reading Humboldt’s\r\n“Personal Narrative” during his last year’s residence in Cambridge, and\r\nhad copied out from it long passages about Teneriffe. He was actually\r\nmaking inquiries as to the best means of visiting that island, when the\r\noffer was made to him to accompany Captain Fitzroy in the _Beagle._ His\r\nfriend Henslow too, on parting with him, had given him the advice to\r\nprocure and read the recently published first volume of the\r\n“Principles of Geology,” though he warned him against accepting the\r\nviews advocated by its author. During the time the _ Beagle_ was\r\nbeating backwards and forwards when the voyage commenced, Darwin,\r\nalthough hardly ever able to leave his berth, was employing all the\r\nopportunities which the terrible sea-sickness left him, in studying\r\nHumboldt and Lyell. We may therefore form an idea of his feelings when,\r\non the ship reaching Santa Cruz, and the Peak of Teneriffe making its\r\nappearance among the clouds, they were suddenly informed that an\r\noutbreak of cholera would prevent any landing!\r\n\r\nAmple compensation for this disappointment was found, however, when the\r\nship reached Porta Praya in St. Jago, the largest of the Cape de Verde\r\nIslands. Here he spent three most delightful weeks, and really\r\ncommenced his work as a geologist and naturalist. Writing to his father\r\nhe says, “Geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides\r\nthe interest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and\r\nretired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine\r\nthe pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and\r\ncoffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island,\r\nthat has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most\r\nuninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage.\r\nIt certainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more\r\nexquisitely beautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to\r\nsay anything about the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to\r\na blind man colours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the\r\ntotal dissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I\r\nalways look forward to writing it down, either in my log-book (which\r\nincreases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and\r\nthose raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing\r\nwonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThe indelible impression made on Darwin’s mind by this first visit to a\r\nvolcanic island, is borne witness to by a remarkable passage in the\r\n“Autobiography” written by him in 1876. “The geology of St. Jago is\r\nvery striking, yet simple; a stream of lava formerly flowed over the\r\nbed of the sea, formed of triturated recent shells and corals, which it\r\nhas baked into a hard white rock. Since then the whole island has been\r\nupheaved. But the line of white rock revealed to me a new and important\r\nfact, namely that there had been afterwards subsidence round the\r\ncraters which had\r\nsince been in action, and had poured forth lava. It then first dawned\r\non me that I might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various\r\ncountries visited, and this made me thrill with delight. That was a\r\nmemorable hour to me, and how distinctly I can call to mind the low\r\ncliff of lava beneath which I rested, with the sun glaring hot, a few\r\nstrange desert plants growing near and with living corals in the tidal\r\npools at my feet.”\r\n\r\nOnly five years before, when listening to poor Professor Jameson’s\r\nlectures on the effete Wernerianism, which at that time did duty for\r\ngeological teaching, Darwin had found them “incredibly dull,” and he\r\ndeclared that “the sole effect they produced on me was a determination\r\nnever so long as I lived to read a book on Geology, or in any way to\r\nstudy the science.”\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast we find in the expressions which he makes use of in\r\nreferring to Geological Science, in his letters written home from the\r\n_Beagle_! After alluding to the delight of collecting and studying\r\nmarine animals, he exclaims, “But Geology carries the day!” Writing to\r\nHenslow he says, “I am quite charmed with Geology, but, like the wise\r\nanimal between two bundles of hay, I do not know which to like best;\r\nthe old crystalline group of rocks, or the softer and more\r\nfossiliferous beds.” And just as the long voyage is about to come to a\r\nclose he again writes, “I find in Geology a never-failing interest; as\r\nit has been remarked, it creates the same grand ideas respecting this\r\nworld which Astronomy does for the Universe.” In this passage Darwin\r\ndoubtless refers to a remark of Sir John Herschel’s in his admirable\r\n“Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy,”—a book\r\nwhich exercised a most remarkable and beneficial influence on the mind\r\nof the young naturalist.\r\n\r\nIf there cannot be any doubt as to the strong predilection in Darwin’s\r\nmind for geological studies, both during and after the memorable\r\nvoyage, there is equally little difficulty in perceiving the school of\r\ngeological thought which, in spite of the warnings of Sedgwick and\r\nHenslow, had obtained complete ascendancy over his mind. He writes in\r\n1876: “The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the\r\nCape de Verde Islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of\r\nLyell’s manner of treating Geology, compared with that of any other\r\nauthor, whose works I had with me, or ever afterwards read.” And again,\r\n“The science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell—more so, as I\r\nbelieve, than to any other man who ever lived . . . I am proud to\r\nremember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the Cape de\r\nVerde Archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the infinite\r\nsuperiority of Lyell’s views over those advocated in any other work\r\nknown to me.”\r\n\r\nThe passages I have cited will serve to show the spirit in which Darwin\r\nentered upon his geological studies, and the perusal of the following\r\npages will furnish abundant proofs of the enthusiasm, acumen, and\r\ncaution with which his researches were pursued.\r\n\r\nLarge collections of rocks and minerals were made by Darwin during his\r\nresearches, and sent home to Cambridge, to be kept under the care of\r\nhis faithful friend Henslow. After visiting his relations and friends,\r\nDarwin’s first care on his return to England was to unpack and examine\r\nthese collections. He accordingly, at the end of 1836, took lodgings\r\nfor three months in Fitzwilliam Street, Cambridge, so as to be near\r\nHenslow; and in studying and determining his geological specimens\r\nreceived much valuable aid from the eminent crystallographer and\r\nmineralogist, Professor William Hallows Miller.\r\n\r\nThe actual writing of the volume upon volcanic islands was not\r\ncommenced till 1843, when Darwin had settled in the spot which became\r\nhis home for the rest of his life—the famous house at Down, in Kent.\r\nWriting to his friend Mr. Fox, on March 28th, 1843, he says, “I am very\r\nslowly progressing with a volume, or rather pamphlet, on the volcanic\r\nislands which we visited: I manage only a couple of hours per day, and\r\nthat not very regularly. It is uphill work writing books, which cost\r\nmoney in publishing, and which are not read even by geologists.”\r\n\r\nThe work occupied Darwin during the whole of the year 1843, and was\r\nissued in the spring of the following year, the actual time engaged in\r\npreparing it being recorded in his diary as “from the summer of 1842 to\r\nJanuary 1844;” but the author does not appear to have been by any means\r\nsatisfied with the result when the book was finished. He wrote to\r\nLyell, “You have pleased me much by saying that you intend looking\r\nthrough my ‘Volcanic Islands;’ it cost me eighteen months!!! and I have\r\nheard of very few who have read it. Now I shall feel, whatever little\r\n(and little it is) there is confirmatory of old work, or new, will work\r\nits effect and not be lost.” To Sir Joseph Hooker he wrote, “I have\r\njust finished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited.\r\nI do not know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I hope you\r\nwill let me send you a copy.”\r\n\r\nEvery geologist knows how full of interest and suggestiveness is\r\nthis book of Darwin’s on volcanic islands. Probably the scant\r\nsatisfaction which its author seemed to find in it may be traced to the\r\neffect of a contrast which he felt between the memory of glowing\r\ndelights he had experienced when, hammer in hand, he roamed over new\r\nand interesting scenes, and the slow, laborious, and less congenial\r\ntask of re-writing and arranging his notes in book-form.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, in writing an account of the ancient volcanoes of the\r\nHebrides, I had frequent occasion to quote Mr. Darwin’s observations on\r\nthe Atlantic volcanoes, in illustration of the phenomena exhibited by\r\nthe relics of still older volcanoes in our own islands. Darwin, in\r\nwriting to his old friend Sir Charles Lyell upon the subject, says, “I\r\nwas not a little pleased to see my volcanic book quoted, for I thought\r\nit was completely dead and forgotten.”\r\n\r\nTwo years later the original publishers of this book and of that on\r\nSouth America proposed to re-issue them. Darwin at first hesitated, for\r\nhe seemed to think there could be little of abiding interest in them;\r\nhe consulted me upon the subject in one of the conversations which I\r\nused to have with him at that time, and I strongly urged upon him the\r\nreprint of the works. I was much gratified when he gave way upon the\r\npoint, and consented to their appearing just as originally issued. In\r\nhis preface he says, “Owing to the great progress which Geology has\r\nmade in recent times, my views on some few points may be somewhat\r\nantiquated, but I have thought it best to leave them as they originally\r\nappeared.”\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to indicate, as briefly as possible, the chief\r\ngeological problem upon which the publication of Darwin’s “Volcanic\r\nIslands” threw new and important light. The merit of the work consisted\r\nin supplying interesting observations, which in some cases have proved\r\nof crucial value in exploding prevalent fallacies; in calling attention\r\nto phenomena and considerations that had been quite overlooked by\r\ngeologists, but have since exercised an important influence in moulding\r\ngeological speculation; and lastly in showing the importance which\r\nattaches to small and seemingly insignificant causes, some of which\r\nafford a key to the explanation of very curious geological problems.\r\n\r\nVisiting as he did the districts in which Von Buch and others had found\r\nwhat they thought to be evidence of the truth of “Elevation-craters,”\r\nDarwin was able to show that the facts were capable of a totally\r\ndifferent interpretation. The views originally put forward by the old\r\nGerman geologist and traveller, and almost\r\nuniversally accepted by his countrymen, had met with much support from\r\nElie de Beaumont and Dufrenoy, the leaders of geological thought in\r\nFrance. They were, however, stoutly opposed by Scrope and Lyell in this\r\ncountry, and by Constant Prevost and Virlet on the other side of the\r\nchannel. Darwin, in the work before us, shows how little ground there\r\nis for the assumption that the great ring-craters of the Atlantic\r\nislands have originated in gigantic blisters of the earth’s surface\r\nwhich, opening at the top, have given origin to the craters. Admitting\r\nthe influence of the injection of lava into the structure of the\r\nvolcanic cones, in increasing their bulk and elevation, he shows that,\r\nin the main, the volcanoes are built up by repeated ejections causing\r\nan accumulation of materials around the vent.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, agreeing on the whole with Scrope and Lyell, as to the\r\nexplosive origin of ordinary volcanic craters, Darwin clearly saw that,\r\nin some cases, great craters might be formed or enlarged, by the\r\nsubsidence of the floors after eruptions. The importance of this\r\nagency, to which too little attention has been directed by geologists,\r\nhas recently been shown by Professor Dana, in his admirable work on\r\nKilauea and the other great volcanoes of the Hawaiian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe effects of subsidence at a volcanic centre in producing a downward\r\ndip of the strata around it, was first pointed out by Darwin, as the\r\nresult of his earliest work in the Cape de Verde Islands. Striking\r\nillustrations of the same principle have since been pointed out by M.\r\nRobert and others in Iceland, by Mr. Heaphy in New Zealand, and by\r\nmyself in the Western Isles of Scotland.\r\n\r\nDarwin again and again called attention to the evidence that volcanic\r\nvents exhibit relations to one another which can only be explained by\r\nassuming the existence of lines of fissure in the earth’s crust, along\r\nwhich the lavas have made their way to the surface. But he, at the same\r\ntime, clearly saw that there was no evidence of the occurrence of great\r\ndeluges of lava along such fissures; he showed how the most remarkable\r\nplateaux, composed of successive lava sheets, might be built up by\r\nrepeated and moderate ejections from numerous isolated vents; and he\r\nexpressly insists upon the rapidity with which the cinder-cones around\r\nthe orifices of ejection and the evidences of successive outflows of\r\nlava would be obliterated by denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking parts of the book is that in which he deals\r\nwith the effects of denudation in producing “basal wrecks”\r\nor worn down stumps of volcanoes. He was enabled to examine a series of\r\ncases in which could be traced every gradation, from perfect volcanic\r\ncones down to the solidified plugs which had consolidated in the vents\r\nfrom which ejections had taken place. Darwin’s observations on these\r\npoints have been of the greatest value and assistance to all who have\r\nessayed to study the effects of volcanic action during earlier periods\r\nof the earth’s history. Like Lyell, he was firmly persuaded of the\r\ncontinuity of geological history, and ever delighted in finding\r\nindications, in the present order of nature, that the phenomena of the\r\npast could be accounted for by means of causes which are still in\r\noperation. Lyell’s last work in the field was carried on about his home\r\nin Forfarshire, and only a few months before his death he wrote to\r\nDarwin: “All the work which I have done has confirmed me in the belief\r\nthat the only difference between Palæozoic and recent volcanic rocks is\r\nno more than we must allow for, by the enormous time to which the\r\nproducts of the oldest volcanoes have been subjected to chemical\r\nchanges.”\r\n\r\nDarwin was greatly impressed, as the result of his studies of volcanic\r\nphenomena, followed by an examination of the great granite-masses of\r\nthe Andes, with the relations between the so-called Plutonic rocks and\r\nthose of undoubtedly volcanic origin. It was indeed a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, that after studying some excellent examples of recent\r\nvolcanic rocks, he proceeded to examine in South America many fine\r\nillustrations of the older igneous rock-masses, and especially of the\r\nmost highly crystalline types of the same, and then on his way home had\r\nopportunities of reviving the impression made upon him by the fresh and\r\nunaltered volcanic rocks. Some of the general considerations suggested\r\nby these observations were discussed in a paper read by him before the\r\nGeological Society, on March 7th, 1838, under the title “On the\r\nConnection of Certain Volcanic Phenomena, and On the Formation of\r\nMountain-chains, and the Effect of Continental Elevations.” The exact\r\nbearing of these two classes of facts upon one another are more fully\r\ndiscussed in his book on South American geology.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of recent elevation around many of the volcanic islands led\r\nDarwin to conclude that volcanic areas were, as a rule, regions in\r\nwhich upward movements were taking place, and he was naturally led to\r\ncontrast them with the areas in which, as he showed, the occurrence of\r\natolls, encircling reefs, and barrier-reefs afford indication of\r\nsubsidence. In this way he was able to\r\nmap out the oceanic areas in different zones, along which opposite\r\nkinds of movement were taking place. His conclusions on this subject\r\nwere full of novelty and suggestiveness.\r\n\r\nVery clearly did Darwin recognise the importance of the fact that most\r\nof the oceanic islands appear to be of volcanic origin, though he was\r\ncareful to point out the remarkable exceptions which somewhat\r\ninvalidate the generalisation. In his “Origin of Species” he has\r\nelaborated the idea and suggested the theory of the permanence of\r\nocean-basins, a suggestion which has been adopted and pushed farther by\r\nsubsequent authors, than we think its originator would have approved.\r\nHis caution and fairness of mind on this and similar speculative\r\nquestions was well-known to all who were in the habit of discussing\r\nthem with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years before the voyage of the _Beagle,_ Mr. Poulett Scrope had\r\npointed out the remarkable analogies that exist between certain igneous\r\nrocks of banded structure, as seen in the Ponza Islands, and the\r\nfoliated crystalline schists. It does not appear that Darwin was\r\nacquainted with this remarkable memoir, but quite independently he\r\ncalled attention to the same phenomena when he came to study some very\r\nsimilar rocks which occur in the island of Ascension. Coming fresh from\r\nthe study of the great masses of crystalline schist in the South\r\nAmerican continent, he was struck by the circumstance that in the\r\nundoubtedly igneous rocks of Ascension we find a similar separation of\r\nthe constituent minerals along parallel “folia.” These observations led\r\nDarwin to the same conclusion as that arrived at some time before by\r\nScrope—namely that when crystallisation takes place in rock masses\r\nunder the influence of great deforming stresses, a separation and\r\nparallel arrangement of the constituent minerals will result. This is a\r\nprocess which is now fully recognised as having been a potent factor in\r\nthe production of the metamorphic rock, and has been called by more\r\nrecent writers “dynamo-metamorphism.”\r\n\r\nIn this, and in many similar discussions, in which exact mineralogical\r\nknowledge was required, it is remarkable how successful Darwin was in\r\nmaking out the true facts with regard to the rocks he studied by the\r\nsimple aid of a penknife and pocket-lens, supplemented by a few\r\nchemical tests and the constant use of the blowpipe. Since his day, the\r\nmethod of study of rocks by thin sections under the microscope has been\r\ndevised, and has become a most efficient aid in all petrographical\r\ninquiries. During the voyage of H.M.S. _Challenger,_ many of the\r\nislands studied by\r\nDarwin have been revisited and their rocks collected. The results of\r\ntheir study by one of the greatest masters of the science of\r\nmicropetrography—Professor Renard of Brussels—have been recently\r\npublished in one of the volumes of “Reports on the _Challenger_\r\nExpedition.” While much that is new and valuable has been contributed\r\nto geological science by these more recent investigations, and many\r\nchanges have been made in nomenclature and other points of detail, it\r\nis interesting to find that all the chief facts described by Darwin and\r\nhis friend Professor Miller have stood the test of time and further\r\nstudy, and remain as a monument of the acumen and accuracy in minute\r\nobservation of these pioneers in geological research.\r\n\r\nJOHN W. JUDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I ST. JAGO, IN THE CAPE DE VERDE ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks of the lowest series.—A calcareous sedimentary deposit, with\r\nrecent shells, altered by the contact of superincumbent lava, its\r\nhorizontality and extent.—Subsequent volcanic eruptions, associated\r\nwith calcareous matter in an earthy and fibrous form, and often\r\nenclosed within the separate cells of the scoriæ.—Ancient and\r\nobliterated orifices of eruption of small size. Difficulty of tracing\r\nover a bare plain recent streams of lava.—Inland hills of more ancient\r\nvolcanic rock.—Decomposed olivine in large masses. Feldspathic rocks\r\nbeneath the upper crystalline basaltic strata. Uniform structure and\r\nform of the more ancient volcanic hills.—Form of the valleys near the\r\ncoast. Conglomerate now forming on the sea beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Jago extends in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, thirty\r\nmiles in length by about twelve in breadth. My observations, made\r\nduring two visits, were confined to the southern portion within the\r\ndistance of a few leagues from Porto Praya. The country, viewed from\r\nthe sea, presents a varied outline: smooth conical hills of a reddish\r\ncolour (like Red Hill in Fig. 1[1]) and others less regular,\r\nflat-topped, and of a blackish colour (like A, B, C,) rise from\r\nsuccessive, step-formed plains of lava. At a distance, a chain of\r\nmountains, many thousand feet in height, traverses the interior of the\r\nisland. There is no active volcano in St. Jago, and only one in the\r\ngroup, namely at Fogo. The island since being inhabited has not\r\nsuffered from destructive earthquakes.\r\n\r\n [1] The outline of the coast, the position of the villages,\r\n streamlets, and of most of the hills in this woodcut, are copied from\r\n the chart made on board H.M.S. _Leven._ The square-topped hills (A, B,\r\n C, etc.) are put in merely by eye, to illustrate my description.\r\n\r\nThe lowest rocks exposed on the coast near Porto Praya, are highly\r\ncrystalline and compact; they appear to be of ancient, submarine,\r\nvolcanic origin; they are unconformably covered by a thin, irregular,\r\ncalcareous deposit, abounding with shells of a late tertiary period;\r\nand this again is capped by a wide sheet of basaltic lava, which has\r\nflowed in successive streams from the interior of the island, between\r\nthe square-topped hills marked A, B, C, etc. Still more recent streams\r\nof lava have been erupted from the scattered cones, such as Red and\r\nSignal Post Hills. The upper strata of the square-topped hills are\r\nintimately related in mineralogical composition, and in other respects,\r\nwith the lowest series of the coast-rocks, with which they seem to be\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verde islands.]\r\n\r\nPart of St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verde islands.\r\n\r\n_Mineralogical description of the rocks of the lowest series._—These\r\nrocks possess an extremely varying character; they consist of black,\r\nbrown, and grey, compact, basaltic bases, with numerous crystals of\r\naugite, hornblende, olivine, mica, and sometimes glassy feldspar. A\r\ncommon variety is almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with\r\nolivine. Mica, it is known, seldom occurs where augite abounds; nor\r\nprobably does the present case offer a real exception, for the mica (at\r\nleast in my best characterised specimen, in which one nodule of this\r\nmineral is nearly half an inch in length) is as perfectly rounded as a\r\npebble in a conglomerate, and evidently has not been crystallised in\r\nthe base, in which it is now enclosed, but has proceeded from the\r\nfusion of some pre-existing rock. These compact lavas alternate with\r\ntuffs, amygdaloids, and wacke, and in some places with coarse\r\nconglomerate. Some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green\r\ncolour, others, pale yellowish-green, and others nearly white; I was\r\nsurprised to find that some of the latter varieties, even where\r\nwhitest, fused into a jet black enamel, whilst some of the green\r\nvarieties afforded only a pale gray bead. Numerous dikes, consisting\r\nchiefly of highly compact augitic rocks, and of gray amygdaloidal\r\nvarieties, intersect the strata, which have in several places been\r\ndislocated with considerable violence, and thrown into highly inclined\r\npositions. One line of disturbance crosses the northern end of Quail\r\nIsland (an islet in the Bay of Porto Praya), and can be followed to the\r\nmainland. These disturbances took place before the deposition of the\r\nrecent sedimentary bed; and the\r\nsurface, also, had previously been denuded to a great extent, as is\r\nshown by many truncated dikes.\r\n\r\n_Description of the calcareous deposit overlying the foregoing volcanic\r\nrocks._—This stratum is very conspicuous from its white colour, and\r\nfrom the extreme regularity with which it ranges in a horizontal line\r\nfor some miles along the coast. Its average height above the sea,\r\nmeasured from the upper line of junction with the superincumbent\r\nbasaltic lava, is about sixty feet; and its thickness, although varying\r\nmuch from the inequalities of the underlying formation, may be\r\nestimated at about twenty feet. It consists of quite white calcareous\r\nmatter, partly composed of organic _débris_, and partly of a substance\r\nwhich may be aptly compared in appearance with mortar. Fragments of\r\nrock and pebbles are scattered throughout this bed, often forming,\r\nespecially in the lower part, a conglomerate. Many of the fragments of\r\nrock are whitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter. At Quail\r\nIsland, the calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest part by a\r\nsoft, brown, earthy tuff, full of Turritellæ; this is covered by a bed\r\nof pebbles, passing into sandstone, and mixed with fragments of echini,\r\nclaws of crabs, and shells; the oyster-shells still adhering to the\r\nrock on which they grew. Numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic\r\nconcretions, from the size of a walnut to that of an apple, are\r\nembedded in this deposit; they usually have a small pebble in their\r\ncentres. Although so like concretions, a close examination convinced me\r\nthat they were Nulliporæ, retaining their proper forms, but with their\r\nsurfaces slightly abraded: these bodies (plants as they are now\r\ngenerally considered to be) exhibit under a microscope of ordinary\r\npower, no traces of organisation in their internal structure. Mr.\r\nGeorge R. Sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which I\r\ncollected: there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect\r\ncondition for their characters to be made out with some degree of\r\ncertainty, and four which can be referred only to their genera. Of the\r\nfourteen shells, of which a list is given in the Appendix, eleven are\r\nrecent species; one, though undescribed, is perhaps identical with a\r\nspecies which I found living in the harbour of Porto Praya; the two\r\nremaining species are unknown, and have been described by Mr. Sowerby.\r\nUntil the shells of this Archipelago and of the neighbouring coasts are\r\nbetter known, it would be rash to assert that even these two latter\r\nshells are extinct. The number of species which certainly belong to\r\nexisting kinds, although few in number, are sufficient to show that the\r\ndeposit belongs to a late tertiary period. From its mineralogical\r\ncharacter, from the number and size of the embedded fragments, and from\r\nthe abundance of Patellæ, and other littoral shells, it is evident that\r\nthe whole was accumulated in a shallow sea, near an ancient coast-line.\r\n\r\n_Effects produced by the flowing of the superincumbent basaltic lava\r\nover the calcareous deposit._—These effects are very curious. The\r\ncalcareous matter is altered to the depth of about a foot beneath the\r\nline of junction; and a most perfect gradation can be traced, from\r\nloosely aggregated, small, particles of shells, corallines, and\r\nNulliporæ, into a rock, in which not a trace of mechanical origin can\r\nbe discovered,\r\neven with a microscope. Where the metamorphic change has been greatest,\r\ntwo varieties occur. The first is a hard, compact, white, fine-grained\r\nrock, striped with a few parallel lines of black volcanic particles,\r\nand resembling a sandstone, but which, upon close examination, is seen\r\nto be crystallised throughout, with the cleavages so perfect that they\r\ncan be readily measured by the reflecting goniometer. In specimens,\r\nwhere the change has been less complete, when moistened and examined\r\nunder a strong lens, the most interesting gradation can be traced, some\r\nof the rounded particles retaining their proper forms, and others\r\ninsensibly melting into the granulo-crystalline paste. The weathered\r\nsurface of this stone, as is so frequently the case with ordinary\r\nlimestones, assumes a brick-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock, but without\r\nany crystalline structure. It consists of a white, opaque, compact,\r\ncalcareous stone, thickly mottled with rounded, though regular, spots\r\nof a soft, earthy, ochraceous substance. This earthy matter is of a\r\npale yellowish-brown colour, and appears to be a mixture of carbonate\r\nof lime with iron; it effervesces with acids, is infusible, but\r\nblackens under the blowpipe, and becomes magnetic. The rounded form of\r\nthe minute patches of earthy substance, and the steps in the progress\r\nof their perfect formation, which can be followed in a suit of\r\nspecimens, clearly show that they are due either to some power of\r\naggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves, or more\r\nprobably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of\r\nline, and consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous\r\nmatter. I was much interested by this fact, because I have often seen\r\nquartz rocks (for instance, in the Falkland Islands, and in the lower\r\nSilurian strata of the Stiper-stones in Shropshire), mottled in a\r\nprecisely analogous manner, with little spots of a white, earthy\r\nsubstance (earthy feldspar?); and these rocks, there was good reason to\r\nsuppose, had undergone the action of heat,—a view which thus receives\r\nconfirmation. This spotted structure may possibly afford some\r\nindication in distinguishing those formations of quartz, which owe\r\ntheir present structure to igneous action, from those produced by the\r\nagency of water alone; a source of doubt, which I should think from my\r\nown experience, that most geologists, when examining arenaceo-quartzose\r\ndistricts must have experienced.\r\n\r\nThe lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava, in rolling over the\r\nsedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea, has caught up large\r\nquantities of calcareous matter, which now forms a snow-white, highly\r\ncrystalline basis to a breccia, including small pieces of black, glossy\r\nscoriæ. A little above this, where the lime is less abundant, and the\r\nlava more compact, numerous little balls, composed of spicula of\r\ncalcareous spar, radiating from common centres, occupy the interstices.\r\nIn one part of Quail Island, the lime has thus been crystallised by the\r\nheat of the superincumbent lava, where it is only thirteen feet in\r\nthickness; nor had the lava been originally thicker, and since reduced\r\nby degradation, as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its\r\nsurface. I have already observed that the sea must have been shallow\r\nin which the calcareous deposit was accumulated. In this case,\r\ntherefore, the carbonic acid gas has been retained under a pressure,\r\ninsignificant compared with that (a column of water, 1,708 feet in\r\nheight) originally supposed by Sir James Hall to be requisite for this\r\nend: but since his experiments, it has been discovered that pressure\r\nhas less to do with the retention of carbonic acid gas, than the nature\r\nof the circumjacent atmosphere; and hence, as is stated to be the case\r\nby Mr. Faraday,[2] masses of limestone are sometimes fused and\r\ncrystallised even in common limekilns. Carbonate of lime can be heated\r\nto almost any degree, according to Faraday, in an atmosphere of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, without being decomposed; and Gay-Lussac found that\r\nfragments of limestone, placed in a tube and heated to a degree, not\r\nsufficient by itself to cause their decomposition, yet immediately\r\nevolved their carbonic acid, when a stream of common air or steam was\r\npassed over them: Gay-Lussac attributes this to the mechanical\r\ndisplacement of the nascent carbonic acid gas. The calcareous matter\r\nbeneath the lava, and especially that forming the crystalline spicula\r\nbetween the interstices of the scoriæ, although heated in an atmosphere\r\nprobably composed chiefly of steam, could not have been subjected to\r\nthe effects of a passing stream; and hence it is, perhaps, that they\r\nhave retained their carbonic acid, under a small amount of pressure.\r\n\r\n [2] I am much indebted to Mr. E. W. Brayley in having given me the\r\n following references to papers on this subject: Faraday in the\r\n _Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, vol. xv, p. 398; Gay-Lussac in\r\n _Annales de Chem. et Phys.,_ tome lxiii, p. 219, translated in the\r\n _London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine,_ vol. x, p. 496.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of scoriæ, embedded in the crystalline calcareous basis,\r\nare of a jet black colour, with a glossy fracture like pitchstone.\r\nTheir surfaces, however, are coated with a layer of a reddish-orange,\r\ntranslucent substance, which can easily be scratched with a knife;\r\nhence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin. Some of the\r\nsmaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance:\r\na change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition. At\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago (as will be described in a future chapter),\r\ngreat beds are formed of volcanic ashes and particles of scoriæ, which\r\nhave undergone a closely similar change.\r\n\r\n_The extent and horizontality of the calcareous stratum._—The upper\r\nline of surface of the calcareous stratum, which is so conspicuous from\r\nbeing quite white and so nearly horizontal, ranges for miles along the\r\ncoast, at the height of about sixty feet above the sea. The sheet of\r\nbasalt, by which it is capped, is on an average eighty feet in\r\nthickness. Westward of Porto Praya beyond Red Hill, the white stratum\r\nwith the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams.\r\nNorthward of Signal Post Hill, I could follow it with my eye, trending\r\naway for several miles along the sea cliffs. The distance thus observed\r\nis about seven miles; but I cannot doubt from its regularity that it\r\nextends much farther. In some ravines at right angles to the coast, it\r\nis seen gently dipping towards the sea, probably with the same\r\ninclination\r\nas when deposited round the ancient shores of the island. I found only\r\none inland section, namely, at the base of the hill marked A, where, at\r\nthe height of some hundred feet, this bed was exposed; it here rested\r\non the usual compact augitic rock associated with wacke, and was\r\ncovered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic lava. Some\r\nexceptions occur to the horizontality of the white stratum: at Quail\r\nIsland, its upper surface is only forty feet above the level of the\r\nsea; here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and fifteen\r\nfeet in thickness; on the other hand, at the north-east side of Porto\r\nPraya harbour, the calcareous stratum, as well as the rock on which it\r\nrests, attain a height above the average level: the inequality of level\r\nin these two cases is not, as I believe, owing to unequal elevation,\r\nbut to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea. Of this fact,\r\nat Quail Island, there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit\r\nbeing in one part of much greater than the average thickness, and in\r\nanother part being entirely absent; in this latter case, the modern\r\nbasaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin.\r\n\r\nFig. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signal Post Hill]\r\n\r\nSIGNAL POST HILL\r\nA—Ancient volcanic rocks.  B—Calcareous stratum. C—Upper balastic lava.\r\n\r\nUnder Signal Post Hill, the white stratum dips into the sea in a\r\nremarkable manner. This hill is conical, 450 feet in height, and\r\nretains some traces of having had a crateriform structure; it is\r\ncomposed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of the\r\ngreat basaltic plain, but partly of lava of apparently submarine origin\r\nand of considerable antiquity. The surrounding plain, as well as the\r\neastern flank of this hill, has been worn into steep precipices,\r\noverhanging the sea. In these precipices, the white calcareous stratum\r\nmay be seen, at the height of about seventy feet above the beach,\r\nrunning for some miles both northward and southward of the hill, in a\r\nline appearing to be perfectly horizontal; but for a space of a quarter\r\nof a mile directly under the hill, it dips into the sea and disappears.\r\nOn the south side the dip is gradual, on the north side it is more\r\nabrupt, as is shown in Fig. 2. As neither the calcareous stratum, nor\r\nthe superincumbent basaltic lava (as far as the latter can be\r\ndistinguished from the more modern ejections), appears to thicken as it\r\ndips, I infer that these strata were not originally accumulated in a\r\ntrough, the centre of which afterwards became a point of eruption; but\r\nthat they have subsequently been disturbed and bent. We may suppose\r\neither that Signal Post Hill subsided after its elevation with the\r\nsurrounding country, or that it never was uplifted to the same height\r\nwith it. This latter seems to me the most probable alternative, for\r\nduring the slow and equable elevation of this portion of the island,\r\nthe subterranean motive\r\npower, from expending part of its force in repeatedly erupting volcanic\r\nmatter from beneath this point, would, it is likely, have less force to\r\nuplift it. Something of the same kind seems to have occurred near Red\r\nHill, for when tracing upwards the naked streams of lava from near\r\nPorto Praya towards the interior of the island, I was strongly induced\r\nto suspect, that since the lava had flowed, the slope of the land had\r\nbeen slightly modified, either by a small subsidence near Red Hill, or\r\nby that portion of the plain having been uplifted to a less height\r\nduring the elevation of the whole area.\r\n\r\n_The basaltic lava, superincumbent on the calcareous deposit._—This\r\nlava is of a pale grey colour, fusing into a black enamel; its fracture\r\nis rather earthy and concretionary; it contains olivine in small\r\ngrains. The central parts of the mass are compact, or at most\r\ncrenulated with a few minute cavities, and are often columnar. At Quail\r\nIsland this structure was assumed in a striking manner; the lava in one\r\npart being divided into horizontal laminæ, which became in another part\r\nsplit by vertical fissures into five-sided plates; and these again,\r\nbeing piled on each other, insensibly became soldered together, forming\r\nfine symmetrical columns. The lower surface of the lava is vesicular,\r\nbut sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches; the upper surface,\r\nwhich is likewise vesicular, is divided into balls, frequently as much\r\nas three feet in diameter, made up of concentric layers. The mass is\r\ncomposed of more than one stream; its total thickness being, on an\r\naverage, about eighty feet: the lower portion has certainly flowed\r\nbeneath the sea, and probably likewise the upper portion. The chief\r\npart of this lava has flowed from the central districts, between the\r\nhills marked A, B, C, etc., in the woodcut-map. The surface of the\r\ncountry, near the coast, is level and barren; towards the interior, the\r\nland rises by successive terraces, of which four, when viewed from a\r\ndistance, could be distinctly counted.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic eruptions subsequent to the elevation of the coastland; the\r\nejected matter associated with earthy lime._—These recent lavas have\r\nproceeded from those scattered, conical, reddish-coloured hills, which\r\nrise abruptly from the plain-country near the coast. I ascended some of\r\nthem, but will describe only one, namely, _Red Hill_, which may serve\r\nas a type of its class, and is remarkable in some especial respects.\r\nIts height is about six hundred feet; it is composed of bright red,\r\nhighly scoriaceous rock of a basaltic nature; on one side of its summit\r\nthere is a hollow, probably the last remnant of a crater. Several of\r\nthe other hills of this class, judging from their external forms, are\r\nsurmounted by much more perfect craters. When sailing along the coast,\r\nit was evident that a considerable body of lava had flowed from Red\r\nHill, over a line of cliff about one hundred and twenty feet in height,\r\ninto the sea: this line of cliff is continuous with that forming the\r\ncoast, and bounding the plain on both sides of this hill; these\r\nstreams, therefore, were erupted, after the formation of the\r\ncoast-cliffs, from Red Hill, when it must have stood, as it now does,\r\nabove the level of the sea. This conclusion accords with the highly\r\nscoriaceous condition of all the rock on it, appearing to be of\r\nsubaerial formation: and this is\r\nimportant, as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its summit,\r\nwhich might, at a hasty glance, have been mistaken for a submarine\r\ndeposit. These beds consist of white, earthy, carbonate of lime,\r\nextremely friable so as to be crushed with the least pressure; the most\r\ncompact specimens not resisting the strength of the fingers. Some of\r\nthe masses are as white as quicklime, and appear absolutely pure; but\r\non examining them with a lens, minute particles of scoriæ can always be\r\nseen, and I could find none which, when dissolved in acids, did not\r\nleave a residue of this nature. It is, moreover, difficult to find a\r\nparticle of the lime which does not change colour under the blowpipe,\r\nmost of them even becoming glazed. The scoriaceous fragments and the\r\ncalcareous matter are associated in the most irregular manner,\r\nsometimes in obscure beds, but more generally as a confused breccia,\r\nthe lime in some parts and the scoriæ in others being most abundant.\r\nSir H. De la Beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest\r\nspecimens analysed, with a view to discover, considering their volcanic\r\norigin, whether they contained much magnesia; but only a small portion\r\nwas found, such as is present in most limestones.\r\n\r\nFragments of the scoriæ embedded in the calcareous mass, when broken,\r\nexhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white,\r\ndelicate, excessively fragile, moss-like, or rather conferva-like,\r\nreticulation of carbonate of lime. These fibres, examined under a lens\r\nof one-tenth of an inch focal distance, appear cylindrical; they are\r\nrather above one-thousandth of an inch in diameter; they are either\r\nsimply branched, or more commonly united into an irregular mass of\r\nnetwork, with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers\r\nof sides. Some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute\r\nspicula, occasionally aggregated into little tuffs; and hence they have\r\na hairy appearance. These spicula are of the same diameter throughout\r\ntheir length; they are easily detached, so that the object-glass of the\r\nmicroscope soon becomes scattered over with them. Within the cells of\r\nmany fragments of the scoria, the lime exhibits this fibrous structure,\r\nbut generally in a less perfect degree. These cells do not appear to be\r\nconnected with one another. There can be no doubt, as will presently be\r\nshown, that the lime was erupted, mingled with the lava in its fluid\r\nstate, and therefore I have thought it worth while to describe minutely\r\nthis curious fibrous structure, of which I know nothing analogous. From\r\nthe earthy condition of the fibres, this structure does not appear to\r\nbe related to crystallisation.\r\n\r\nOther fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill, when broken,\r\nare often seen marked with short and irregular white streaks, which are\r\nowing to a row of separate cells being partly, or quite, filled with\r\nwhite calcareous powder. This structure immediately reminded me of the\r\nappearance in badly kneaded dough, of balls and drawn-out streaks of\r\nflour, which have remained unmixed with the paste; and I cannot doubt\r\nthat small masses of the lime, in the same manner remaining unmixed\r\nwith the fluid lava, have been drawn out when the whole was in motion.\r\nI carefully examined, by trituration and solution in acids, pieces of\r\nthe scoriæ, taken from within half-an-inch of those\r\ncells which were filled with the calcareous powder, and they did not\r\ncontain an atom of free lime. It is obvious that the lava and lime have\r\non a large scale been very imperfectly mingled; and where small\r\nportions of the lime have been entangled within a piece of the viscid\r\nlava, the cause of their now occupying, in the form of a powder or of a\r\nfibrous reticulation, the vesicular cavities, is, I think, evidently\r\ndue to the confined gases having most readily expanded at the points\r\nwhere the incoherent lime rendered the lava less adhesive.\r\n\r\nA mile eastward of the town of Praya, there is a steep-sided gorge,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty yards in width, cutting through the\r\nbasaltic plain and underlying beds, but since filled up by a stream of\r\nmore modern lava. This lava is dark grey, and in most parts compact and\r\nrudely columnar; but at a little distance from the coast, it includes\r\nin an irregular manner a brecciated mass of red scoriæ mingled with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of white, friable, and in some parts, nearly pure\r\nearthy lime, like that on the summit of Red Hill. This lava, with its\r\nentangled lime, has certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream;\r\nand, judging from the shape of the gorge, towards which the drainage of\r\nthe country (feeble though it now be) still is directed, and from the\r\nappearance of the bed of loose water-worn blocks with their interstices\r\nunfilled, like those in the bed of a torrent, on which the lava rests,\r\nwe may conclude that the stream was of subaerial origin. I was unable\r\nto trace it to its source, but, from its direction, it seemed to have\r\ncome from Signal Post Hill, distant one mile and a quarter, which, like\r\nRed Hill, has been a point of eruption subsequent to the elevation of\r\nthe great basaltic plain. It accords with this view, that I found on\r\nSignal Post Hill, a mass of earthy, calcareous matter of the same\r\nnature, mingled with scoriæ. I may here observe that part of the\r\ncalcareous matter forming the horizontal sedimentary bed, especially\r\nthe finer matter with which the embedded fragments of rock are\r\nwhitewashed, has probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions,\r\nas well as from triturated organic remains: the underlying, ancient,\r\ncrystalline rocks, also, are associated with much carbonate of lime,\r\nfilling amygdaloidal cavities, and forming irregular masses, the nature\r\nof which latter I was unable to understand.\r\n\r\nConsidering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of Red Hill, a\r\nvolcanic cone six hundred feet in height, of subaerial\r\ngrowth,—considering the intimate manner in which minute particles and\r\nlarge masses of scoriæ are embedded in the masses of nearly pure lime,\r\nand on the other hand, the manner in which small kernels and streaks of\r\nthe calcareous powder are included in solid pieces of the\r\nscoriæ,—considering, also, the similar occurrence of lime and scoriæ\r\nwithin a stream of lava, also supposed, with good reason, to have been\r\nof modern subaerial origin, and to have flowed from a hill, where\r\nearthy lime also occurs: I think, considering these facts, there can be\r\nno doubt that the lime has been erupted, mingled with the molten lava.\r\nI am not aware that any similar case has been described: it appears to\r\nme an interesting one, inasmuch as most geologists must have speculated\r\non the probable effects of a volcanic focus, bursting through\r\ndeep-seated beds\r\nof different mineralogical composition. The great abundance of free\r\nsilex in the trachytes of some countries (as described by Beudant in\r\nHungary, and by P. Scrope in the Panza Islands), perhaps solves the\r\ninquiry with respect to deep-seated beds of quartz; and we probably\r\nhere see it answered, where the volcanic action has invaded subjacent\r\nmasses of limestone. One is naturally led to conjecture in what state\r\nthe now earthy carbonate of lime existed, when ejected with the\r\nintensely heated lava: from the extreme cellularity of the scoriæ on\r\nRed Hill, the pressure cannot have been great, and as most volcanic\r\neruptions are accompanied by the emission of large quantities of steam\r\nand other gases, we here have the most favourable conditions, according\r\nto the views at present entertained by chemists, for the expulsion of\r\nthe carbonic acid.[3] Has the slow re-absorption of this gas, it may be\r\nasked, given to the lime in the cells of the lava, that peculiar\r\nfibrous structure, like that of an efflorescing salt? Finally, I may\r\nremark on the great contrast in appearance between this earthy lime,\r\nwhich must have been heated in a free atmosphere of steam and other\r\ngases, while the white, crystalline, calcareous spar, produced by a\r\nsingle thin sheet of lava (as at Quail Island) rolling over similar\r\nearthy lime and the _débris_ of organic remains, at the bottom of a\r\nshallow sea.\r\n\r\n [3] Whilst deep beneath the surface, the carbonate of lime was, I\r\n presume, in a fluid state. Hutton, it is known, thought that all\r\n amygdaloids were produced by drops of molten limestone floating in the\r\n trap, like oil in water: this no doubt is erroneous, but if the matter\r\n forming the summit of Red Hill had been cooled under the pressure of a\r\n moderately deep sea, or within the walls of a dike, we should, in all\r\n probability, have had a trap rock associated with large masses of\r\n compact, crystalline, calcareous spar, which, according to the views\r\n entertained by many geologists, would have been wrongly attributed to\r\n subsequent infiltration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Signal Post Hill._—This hill has already been several times mentioned,\r\nespecially with reference to the remarkable manner in which the white\r\ncalcareous stratum, in other parts so horizontal (Fig. 2), dips under\r\nit into the sea. It has a broad summit, with obscure traces of a\r\ncrateriform structure, and is composed of basaltic rocks,[4] some\r\ncompact, others highly cellular with inclined beds of loose scoriæ, of\r\nwhich some are associated with earthy lime. Like Red Hill, it has been\r\nthe source of eruptions, subsequently to the elevation of the\r\nsurrounding basaltic plain; but unlike that hill, it has undergone\r\nconsiderable denudation, and has been the seat of volcanic action at a\r\nremote period, when beneath the sea. I judge of this latter\r\ncircumstance from finding on its inland flank the last remnants of\r\nthree small\r\npoints of eruption. These points are composed of glossy scoriæ,\r\ncemented by crystalline calcareous spar, exactly like the great\r\nsubmarine calcareous deposit, where the heated lava has rolled over it:\r\ntheir demolished state can, I think, be explained only by the denuding\r\naction of the waves of the sea. I was guided to the first orifice by\r\nobserving a sheet of lava, about two hundred yards square, with\r\nsteepish sides, superimposed on the basaltic plain with no adjoining\r\nhillock, whence it could have been erupted; and the only trace of a\r\ncrater which I was able to discover, consisted of some inclined beds of\r\nscoriæ at one of its corners. At the distance of fifty yards from a\r\nsecond level-topped patch of lava, but of much smaller size, I found an\r\nirregular circular group of masses of cemented, scoriaceous breccia,\r\nabout six feet in height, which doubtless had once formed the point of\r\neruption. The third orifice is now marked only by an irregular circle\r\nof cemented scoriæ, about four yards in diameter, and rising in its\r\nhighest point scarcely three feet above the level of the plain, the\r\nsurface of which, close all round, exhibits its usual appearance: here\r\nwe have a horizontal basal section of a volcanic spiracle, which,\r\ntogether with all its ejected matter, has been almost totally\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\n [4] Of these, one common variety is remarkable for being full of small\r\n fragments of a dark jasper-red earthy mineral, which, when examined\r\n carefully, shows an indistinct cleavage; the little fragments are\r\n elongated in form, are soft, are magnetic before and after being\r\n heated, and fuse with difficulty into a dull enamel. This mineral is\r\n evidently closely related to the oxides of iron, but I cannot\r\n ascertain what it exactly is. The rock containing this mineral is\r\n crenulated with small angular cavities, which are lined and filled\r\n with yellowish crystals of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stream of lava, which fills the narrow gorge[5] eastward of the\r\ntown of Praya, judging from its course, seems, as before remarked, to\r\nhave come from Signal Post Hill, and to have flowed over the plain,\r\nafter its elevation: the same observation applies to a stream (possibly\r\npart of the same one) capping the sea cliffs, a little eastward of the\r\ngorge. When I endeavoured to follow these streams over the stony level\r\nplain, which is almost destitute of soil and vegetation, I was much\r\nsurprised to find, that although composed of hard basaltic matter, and\r\nnot having been exposed to marine denudation, all distant traces of\r\nthem soon became utterly lost. But I have since observed at the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, that it is often impossible to follow even great\r\ndeluges of quite recent lava across older streams, except by the size\r\nof the bushes growing on them, or by the comparative states of\r\nglossiness of their surfaces,—characters which a short lapse of time\r\nwould be sufficient quite to obscure. I may remark, that in a level\r\ncountry, with a dry climate, and with the wind blowing always in one\r\ndirection (as at the Cape de Verde Archipelago), the effects of\r\natmospheric degradation are probably much greater than would at first\r\nbe expected; for soil in this case accumulates only in a few protected\r\nhollows, and being blown in one direction, it is always travelling\r\ntowards the sea in the form of the finest dust, leaving the surface of\r\nthe rocks bare, and exposed to the full effects of renewed meteoric\r\naction.\r\n\r\n [5] The sides of this gorge, where the upper basaltic stratum is\r\n intersected, are almost perpendicular. The lava, which has since\r\n filled it up, is attached to these sides, almost as firmly as a dike\r\n is to its walls. In most cases, where a stream of lava has flowed down\r\n a valley, it is bounded on each side by loose scoriaceous masses.\r\n\r\n_Inland hills of more ancient volcanic rocks._—These hills are laid\r\ndown by eye, and marked as A, B, C, etc., in Map 1. They are related in\r\nmineralogical composition, and are probably directly\r\ncontinuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast. These hills,\r\nviewed from a distance, appear as if they had once formed part of an\r\nirregular tableland, and from their corresponding structure and\r\ncomposition this probably has been the case. They have flat, slightly\r\ninclined summits, and are, on an average, about six hundred feet in\r\nheight; they present their steepest slope towards the interior of the\r\nisland, from which point they radiate outwards, and are separated from\r\neach other by broad and deep valleys, through which the great streams\r\nof lava, forming the coast-plains, have descended. Their inner and\r\nsteeper escarpments are ranged in an irregular curve, which rudely\r\nfollows the line of the shore, two or three miles inland from it. I\r\nascended a few of these hills, and from others, which I was able to\r\nexamine with a telescope, I obtained specimens, through the kindness of\r\nMr. Kent, the assistant-surgeon of the _Beagle_; although by these\r\nmeans I am acquainted with only a part of the range, five or six miles\r\nin length, yet I scarcely hesitate, from their uniform structure, to\r\naffirm that they are parts of one great formation, stretching round\r\nmuch of the circumference of the island.\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in\r\ncomposition. The upper are basaltic, generally compact, but sometimes\r\nscoriaceous and amygdaloidal, with associated masses of wacke: where\r\nthe basalt is compact, it is either fine-grained or very coarsely\r\ncrystallised; in the latter case it passes into an augitic rock,\r\ncontaining much olivine; the olivine is either colourless, or of the\r\nusual yellow and dull reddish shades. On some of the hills, beds of\r\ncalcareous matter, both in an earthy and in a crystalline form,\r\nincluding fragments of glossy scoriæ, are associated with the basaltic\r\nstrata. These strata differ from the streams of basaltic lava forming\r\nthe coast-plains, only in being more compact, and in the crystals of\r\naugite, and in the grains of olivine being of much greater\r\nsize;—characters which, together with the appearance of the associated\r\ncalcareous beds, induce me to believe that they are of submarine\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nSome considerable masses of wacke, which are associated with these\r\nbasaltic strata, and which likewise occur in the basal series on the\r\ncoast, especially at Quail Island, are curious. They consist of a pale\r\nyellowish-green argillaceous substance, of a crumbling texture when\r\ndry, but unctuous when moist: in its purest form, it is of a beautiful\r\ngreen tint, with translucent edges, and occasionally with obscure\r\ntraces of an original cleavage. Under the blowpipe it fuses very\r\nreadily into a dark grey, and sometimes even black bead, which is\r\nslightly magnetic. From these characters, I naturally thought that it\r\nwas one of the pale species, decomposed, of the genus augite;—a\r\nconclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate\r\ncrystals of black augite, and of balls and irregular streaks of dark\r\ngrey augitic rock. As the basalt ordinarily consists of augite, and of\r\nolivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour, I was led to examine\r\nthe stages of decomposition of this latter mineral, and I found, to my\r\nsurprise, that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered\r\nolivine to the green wacke. Part of the same grain under the blowpipe\r\nwould in some instances\r\nbehave like olivine, its colour being only slightly changed, and part\r\nwould give a black magnetic bead. Hence I can have no doubt that the\r\ngreenish wacke originally existed as olivine; but great chemical\r\nchanges must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to\r\nhave altered a very hard, transparent, infusible mineral, into a soft,\r\nunctuous, easily melted, argillaceous substance.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] D’Aubuisson “Traité de Géognosie” (tome ii, p. 569) mentions, on\r\n the authority of M. Marcel de Serres, masses of green earth near\r\n Montpellier, which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of\r\n olivine. I do not, however, find, that the action of this mineral\r\n under the blowpipe being entirely altered, as it becomes decomposed,\r\n has been noticed; and the knowledge of this fact is important, as at\r\n first it appears highly improbable that a hard, transparent,\r\n refractory mineral should be changed into a soft, easily fused clay,\r\n like this of St. Jago. I shall hereafter describe a green substance,\r\n forming threads within the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in\r\n Van Diemen’s Land, which behave under the blowpipe like the green\r\n wacke of St. Jago; but its occurrence in cylindrical threads, shows it\r\n cannot have resulted from the decomposition of olivine, a mineral\r\n always existing in the form of grains or crystals.\r\n\r\nThe basal strata of these hills, as well as some neighbouring,\r\nseparate, bare, rounded hillocks, consist of compact, fine-grained,\r\nnon-crystalline (or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible),\r\nferruginous, feldspathic rocks, and generally in a state of\r\nsemi-decomposition. Their fracture is exceedingly irregular, and\r\nsplintery; yet small fragments are often very tough. They contain much\r\nferruginous matter, either in the form of minute grains with a metallic\r\nlustre, or of brown hair-like threads: the rock in this latter case\r\nassuming a pseudo-brecciated structure. These rocks sometimes contain\r\nmica and veins of agate. Their rusty brown or yellowish colour is\r\npartly due to the oxides of iron, but chiefly to innumerable,\r\nmicroscopically minute, black specks, which, when a fragment is heated,\r\nare easily fused, and evidently are either hornblende or augite. These\r\nrocks, therefore, although at first appearing like baked clay or some\r\naltered sedimentary deposit, contain all the essential ingredients of\r\ntrachyte; from which they differ only in not being harsh, and in not\r\ncontaining crystals of glassy feldspar. As is so often the case with\r\ntrachytic formation, no stratification is here apparent. A person would\r\nnot readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava; yet at\r\nSt. Helena there are well-characterised streams (as will be described\r\nin an ensuing chapter) of nearly similar composition. Amidst the\r\nhillocks composed of these rocks, I found in three places, smooth\r\nconical hills of phonolite, abounding with fine crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, and with needles of hornblende. These cones of phonolite, I\r\nbelieve, bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata\r\nwhich some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock, in another\r\npart of the island, bear to the surrounding basalt, namely, that both\r\nhave been injected. The rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in\r\norigin to the basaltic strata, which cap them, as well as to the\r\nbasaltic streams of the coast-plains, accords with the usual order of\r\nsuccession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strata of most of these hills in the upper part, where alone the\r\nplanes of division are distinguishable, are inclined at a small angle\r\nfrom the interior of the island towards the sea-coast. The inclination\r\nis not the same in each hill; in that marked A it is less than in B, D,\r\nor E; in C the strata are scarcely deflected from a horizontal plane,\r\nand in F (as far as I could judge without ascending it) they are\r\nslightly inclined in a reverse direction, that is, inwards and towards\r\nthe centre of the island. Notwithstanding these differences of\r\ninclination, their correspondence in external form, and in the\r\ncomposition both of their upper and lower parts,—their relative\r\nposition in one curved line, with their steepest sides turned\r\ninwards,—all seem to show that they originally formed parts of one\r\nplatform; which platform, as before remarked, probably extended round a\r\nconsiderable portion of the circumference of the island. The upper\r\nstrata certainly flowed as lava, and probably beneath the sea, as\r\nperhaps did the lower feldspathic masses: how then come these strata to\r\nhold their present position, and whence were they erupted?\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the island[7] there are lofty mountains, but they are\r\nseparated from the steep inland flanks of these hills by a wide space\r\nof lower country: the interior mountains, moreover, seem to have been\r\nthe source of those great streams of basaltic lava which, contracting\r\nas they pass between the bases of the hills in question, expand into\r\nthe coast-plains. Round the shores of St. Helena there is a rudely\r\nformed ring of basaltic rocks, and at Mauritius there are remnants of\r\nanother such a ring round part, if not round the whole, of the island;\r\nhere again the same question immediately occurs, how came these masses\r\nto hold their present position, and whence were they erupted? The same\r\nanswer, whatever it may be, probably applies in these three cases; and\r\nin a future chapter we shall recur to this subject.\r\n\r\n [7] I saw very little of the inland parts of the island. Near the\r\n village of St. Domingo, there are magnificent cliffs of rather\r\n coarsely crystallised basaltic lava. Following the little stream in\r\n this valley, about a mile above the village, the base of the great\r\n cliff was formed of a compact fine-grained basalt, conformably covered\r\n by a bed of pebbles. Near Fuentes, I met with pap-formed hills of the\r\n compact feldspathic series of rocks.\r\n\r\n_Valleys near the coast._—These are broad, very flat, and generally\r\nbounded by low cliff-formed sides. Portions of the basaltic plain are\r\nsometimes nearly or quite isolated by them; of which fact, the space on\r\nwhich the town of Praya stands offers an instance. The great valley\r\nwest of the town has its bottom filled up to a depth of more than\r\ntwenty feet by well-rounded pebbles, which in some parts are firmly\r\ncemented together by white calcareous matter. There can be no doubt,\r\nfrom the form of these valleys, that they were scooped out by the waves\r\nof the sea, during that equable elevation of the land, of which the\r\nhorizontal calcareous deposit, with its existing species of marine\r\nremains, gives evidence. Considering how well shells have been\r\npreserved in this stratum, it is singular that I could not find even a\r\nsingle small fragment of shell in the conglomerate at the bottom of the\r\nvalleys. The bed of pebbles in the valley west of the town is\r\nintersected by a second valley joining it as a tributary, but even this\r\nvalley appears much too wide and flat-bottomed to have been formed by\r\nthe small quantity of water, which falls only during one short wet\r\nseason; for at other times of the year these valleys are absolutely\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n_Recent conglomerate._—On the shores of Quail Island, I found fragments\r\nof brick, bolts of iron, pebbles, and large fragments of basalt, united\r\nby a scanty base of impure calcareous matter into a firm conglomerate.\r\nTo show how exceedingly firm this recent conglomerate is, I may\r\nmention, that I endeavoured with a heavy geological hammer to knock out\r\na thick bolt of iron, which was embedded a little above low-water mark,\r\nbut was quite unable to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II FERNANDO NORONHA; TERCEIRA; TAHITI, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA.—Precipitous hill of phonolite.

Their singular\r\nmineralogical composition.\r\n\r\n_Fernando Noronha._—During our short visit at this and the four\r\nfollowing islands, I observed very little worthy of description.\r\nFernando Noronha is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 3° 50′ S.,\r\nand 230 miles distant from the coast of South America. It consists of\r\nseveral islets, together nine miles in length by three in breadth. The\r\nwhole seems to be of volcanic origin; although there is no appearance\r\nof any crater, or of any one central eminence. The most remarkable\r\nfeature is a hill 1,000 feet high, of which the upper 400 feet consist\r\nof a precipitous, singularly shaped pinnacle, formed of columnar\r\nphonolite, containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar, and a few\r\nneedles of hornblende. From the highest accessible point of this hill,\r\nI could distinguish in different parts of the group several other\r\nconical hills, apparently of the same nature. At St. Helena there are\r\nsimilar, great, conical, protuberant masses of phonolite, nearly one\r\nthousand feet in height, which have been formed by the injection of\r\nfluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata. If this hill has had, as\r\nis probable, a similar origin, denudation has been here effected on an\r\nenormous scale. Near the base of this hill, I observed beds of white\r\ntuff, intersected by numerous dikes, some of amygdaloidal basalt and\r\nothers of trachyte; and beds of slaty phonolite with the planes of\r\ncleavage directed N.W. and S.E. Parts of this rock, where the crystals\r\nwere scanty, closely resembled common clay-slate, altered by the\r\ncontact of a trap-dike. The lamination of rocks, which undoubtedly have\r\nonce been fluid, appears to me a subject well deserving attention. On\r\nthe beach there were numerous\r\nfragments of compact basalt, of which rock a distant façade of columns\r\nseemed to be formed.\r\n\r\n_Terceira in the Azores._—The central parts of this island consist of\r\nirregularly rounded mountains of no great elevation, composed of\r\ntrachyte, which closely resembles in general character the trachyte of\r\nAscension, presently to be described. This formation is in many parts\r\noverlaid, in the usual order of superposition, by streams of basaltic\r\nlava, which near the coast compose nearly the whole surface. The course\r\nwhich these streams have followed from their craters, can often be\r\nfollowed by the eye. The town of Angra is overlooked by a crateriform\r\nhill (Mount Brazil), entirely built of thin strata of fine-grained,\r\nharsh, brown-coloured tuff. The upper beds are seen to overlap the\r\nbasaltic streams on which the town stands. This hill is almost\r\nidentical in structure and composition with numerous crateriformed\r\nhills in the Galapagos Archipelago.\r\n\r\n_Effects of steam on the trachytic rocks._—In the central part of the\r\nisland there is a spot, where steam is constantly issuing in jets from\r\nthe bottom of a small ravine-like hollow, which has no exit, and which\r\nabuts against a range of trachytic mountains. The steam is emitted from\r\nseveral irregular fissures: it is scentless, soon blackens iron, and is\r\nof much too high temperature to be endured by the hand. The manner in\r\nwhich the solid trachyte is changed on the borders of these orifices is\r\ncurious: first, the base becomes earthy, with red freckles evidently\r\ndue to the oxidation of particles of iron; then it becomes soft; and\r\nlastly, even the crystals of glassy feldspar yield to the dissolving\r\nagent. After the mass is converted into clay, the oxide of iron seems\r\nto be entirely removed from some parts, which are left perfectly white,\r\nwhilst in other neighbouring parts, which are of the brightest red\r\ncolour, it seems to be deposited in greater quantity; some other masses\r\nare marbled with two distinct colours. Portions of the white clay, now\r\nthat they are dry, cannot be distinguished by the eye from the finest\r\nprepared chalk; and when placed between the teeth they feel equally\r\nsoft-grained; the inhabitants use this substance for white-washing\r\ntheir houses. The cause of the iron being dissolved in one part, and\r\nclose by being again deposited, is obscure; but the fact has been\r\nobserved in several other places.[1] In some half-decayed specimens, I\r\nfound small, globular aggregations of yellow hyalite, resembling\r\ngum-arabic, which no doubt had been deposited by the steam.\r\n\r\n [1] Spallanzani, Dolomieu, and Hoffman have described similar cases in\r\n the Italian volcanic islands. Dolomieu says the iron at the Panza\r\n Islands is redeposited in the form of veins (p. 86 “Mémoire sur les\r\n Isles Ponces”). These authors likewise believe that the steam deposits\r\n silica: it is now experimentally known that vapour of a high\r\n temperature is able to dissolve silica.\r\n\r\nAs there is no escape for the rain-water, which trickles down the sides\r\nof the ravine-like hollow, whence the steam issues, it must all\r\npercolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom. Some of the\r\ninhabitants informed me that it was on record that flames (some\r\nluminous appearance?) had originally proceeded from these cracks,\r\nand that the flames had been succeeded by the steam; but I was not able\r\nto ascertain how long this was ago, or anything certain on the subject.\r\nWhen viewing the spot, I imagined that the injection of a large mass of\r\nrock. like the cone of phonolite at Fernando Noronha, in a semi-fluid\r\nstate, by arching the surface might have caused a wedge-shaped hollow\r\nwith cracks at the bottom, and that the rain-water percolating to the\r\nneighbourhood of the heated mass, would during many succeeding years be\r\ndriven back in the form of steam.\r\n\r\n_Tahiti (Otaheite)._—I visited only a part of the north-western side of\r\nthis island, and this part is entirely composed of volcanic rocks. Near\r\nthe coast there are several varieties of basalt, some abounding with\r\nlarge crystals of augite and tarnished olivine, others compact and\r\nearthy,—some slightly vesicular, and others occasionally amygdaloidal.\r\nThese rocks are generally much decomposed, and to my surprise, I found\r\nin several sections that it was impossible to distinguish, even\r\napproximately, the line of separation between the decayed lava and the\r\nalternating beds of tuff. Since the specimens have become dry, it is\r\nrather more easy to distinguish the decomposed igneous rocks from the\r\nsedimentary tuffs. This gradation in character between rocks having\r\nsuch widely different origins, may I think be explained by the yielding\r\nunder pressure of the softened sides of the vesicular cavities, which\r\nin many volcanic rocks occupy a large proportion of their bulk. As the\r\nvesicles generally increase in size and number in the upper parts of a\r\nstream of lava, so would the effects of their compression increase; the\r\nyielding, moreover, of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the\r\nsoftened matter above it. Hence we might expect to trace a perfect\r\ngradation from an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the\r\nparticles (although originally forming part of the same solid mass) had\r\nundergone mechanical displacement; and such particles could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from others of similar composition, which had been\r\ndeposited as sediment. As lavas are sometimes laminated in their upper\r\nparts even horizontal lines, appearing like those of aqueous\r\ndeposition, could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of\r\nsedimentary origin. From these considerations it is not surprising that\r\nformerly many geologists believed in real transitions from aqueous\r\ndeposits, through wacke, into igneous traps.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of Tia-auru, the commonest rocks are basalts with much\r\nolivine, and in some cases almost composed of large crystals of augite.\r\nI picked up some specimens, with much glassy feldspar, approaching in\r\ncharacter to trachyte. There were also many large blocks of vesicular\r\nbasalt, with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie (?), and\r\nradiating bundles of mesotype. Some of these specimens presented a\r\ncurious appearance, owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled\r\nup with a white, soft, earthy mesotypic mineral, which intumesced under\r\nthe blowpipe in a remarkable manner. As the upper surfaces in all the\r\nhalf-filled cells are exactly parallel, it is evident that this\r\nsubstance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight.\r\nSometimes, however, it entirely fills the cells. Other cells are either\r\nquite\r\nfilled, or lined, with small crystals, apparently of chabasie; these\r\ncrystals, also, frequently line the upper half of the cells partly\r\nfilled with the earthy mineral, as well as the upper surface of this\r\nsubstance itself, in which case the two minerals appear to blend into\r\neach other. I have never seen any other amygdaloid[2] with the cells\r\nhalf filled in the manner here described; and it is difficult to\r\nimagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its\r\ngravity to the bottom of the cells, and the crystalline mineral to\r\nadhere in a coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells.\r\n\r\n [2] MacCulloch, however, has described and given a plate of (“Geolog.\r\n Trans.” 1st series, vol. iv, p. 225) a trap rock, with cavities filled\r\n up horizontally with quartz and chalcedony. The upper halves of these\r\n cavities are often filled by layers, which follow each irregularity of\r\n the surface, and by little depending stalactites of the same siliceous\r\n substances.\r\n\r\nThe basic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined\r\nseaward, and I nowhere observed any sign of disturbance; the strata are\r\nseparated from each other by thick, compact beds of conglomerate, in\r\nwhich the fragments are large, some being rounded, but most angular.\r\nFrom the character of these beds, from the compact and crystalline\r\ncondition of most of the lavas, and from the nature of the infiltrated\r\nminerals, I was led to conjecture that they had originally flowed\r\nbeneath the sea. This conclusion agrees with the fact that the Rev. W.\r\nEllis found marine remains at a considerable height, which he believes\r\nwere interstratified with volcanic matter; as is likewise described to\r\nbe the case by Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett at Huaheine, an island in\r\nthis same archipelago. Mr. Stutchbury also discovered near the summit\r\nof one of the loftiest mountains of Tahiti, at the height of several\r\nthousand feet, a stratum of semi-fossil coral. None of these remains\r\nhave been specifically examined. On the coast, where masses of\r\ncoral-rock would have afforded the clearest evidence, I looked in vain\r\nfor any signs of recent elevation. For references to the above\r\nauthorities, and for more detailed reasons for not believing that\r\nTahiti has been recently elevated, I must refer to the “Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral-Reefs.”\r\n\r\n_Mauritius._—Approaching this island on the northern or north-western\r\nside, a curved chain of bold mountains, surmounted by rugged pinnacles,\r\nis seen to rise from a smooth border of cultivated land, which gently\r\nslopes down to the coast. At the first glance, one is tempted to\r\nbelieve that the sea lately reached the base of these mountains, and\r\nupon examination, this view, at least with respect to the inferior\r\nparts of the border, is found to be perfectly correct. Several\r\nauthors[3] have described masses of upraised coral-rock round the\r\ngreater part of the circumference of the island. Between Tamarin Bay\r\nand the Great Black River I observed, in company with Captain Lloyd,\r\ntwo hillocks of coral-rock, formed in their lower part of hard\r\ncalcareous sandstone, and in their upper of great blocks, slightly\r\naggregated, of Astræa and Madrepora, and of fragments of basalt; they\r\nwere divided into beds dipping seaward, in one case at an angle of 8°,\r\nand in the other at 18°; they had a water-worn appearance, and they\r\nrose abruptly from a smooth surface, strewed with rolled débris of\r\norganic remains, to a height of about twenty feet. The Officier du Roi,\r\nin his most interesting tour in 1768 round the island, has described\r\nmasses of upraised coral-rocks, still retaining that moat-like\r\nstructure (see my “Coral Reefs”) which is characteristic of the living\r\nreefs. On the coast northward of Port Louis, I found the lava concealed\r\nfor a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of corals and shells,\r\nlike those on the beach, but in parts consolidated by red ferruginous\r\nmatter. M. Bory St. Vincent has described similar calcareous beds over\r\nnearly the whole of the plain of Pamplemousses. Near Port Louis, when\r\nturning over some large stones, which lay in the bed of a stream at the\r\nhead of a protected creek, and at the height of some yards above the\r\nlevel of spring tides, I found several shells of serpula still adhering\r\nto their under sides.\r\n\r\n [3] Captain Carmichael, in Hooker’s “Bot. Misc.,” vol. ii, p. 301.\r\n Captain Lloyd has lately, in the “Proceedings of the Geological\r\n Society” (vol. iii, p. 317), described carefully some of these masses.\r\n In the “Voyage à l’Isle de France, par un Officier du Roi,” many\r\n interesting facts are given on this subject. Consult also “Voyage aux\r\n Quatre Isles d’Afrique, par M. Bory St. Vincent.”\r\n\r\nThe jagged mountains near Port Louis rise to a height of between two\r\nand three thousand feet; they consist of strata of basalt, obscurely\r\nseparated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of fragmentary\r\nmatter; and they are intersected by a few vertical dikes. The basalt in\r\nsome parts abounds with large crystals of augite and olivine, and is\r\ngenerally compact. The interior of the island forms a plain, raised\r\nprobably about a thousand feet above the level of the sea, and composed\r\nof streams of lava which have flowed round and between the rugged\r\nbasaltic mountains. These more recent lavas are also basaltic, but less\r\ncompact, and some of them abound with feldspar, so that they even fuse\r\ninto a pale coloured glass. On the banks of the Great River, a section\r\nis exposed nearly five hundred feet deep, worn through numerous thin\r\nsheets of the lava of this series, which are separated from each other\r\nby beds of scoriæ. They seem to have been of subaerial formation, and\r\nto have flowed from several points of eruption on the central platform,\r\nof which the Piton du Milieu is said to be the principal one. There are\r\nalso several volcanic cones, apparently of this modern period, round\r\nthe circumference of the island, especially at the northern end, where\r\nthey form separate islets.\r\n\r\nThe mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline basalt, form\r\nthe main skeleton of the island. M. Bailly[4] states that they all “se\r\ndéveloppent autour d’elle comme une ceinture d’immenses remparts,\r\ntoutes affectant une pente plus ou moins enclinée vers le rivage de la\r\nmer; tandis, au contraire, que vers le centre de l’ile elles presentent\r\nune coupe abrupte, et souvent taillée à pic. Toutes ces montagnes sont\r\nformées de couches parallèles inclinées du centre de l’ile vers la\r\nmer.” These statements have been disputed, though not in detail, by M.\r\nQuoy, in the voyage of Freycinet. As far as my limited means of\r\nobservation went, I found\r\nthem perfectly correct.[5] The mountains on the N.W. side of the\r\nisland, which I examined, namely, La Pouce, Peter Botts, Corps de\r\nGarde, Les Mamelles, and apparently another farther southward, have\r\nprecisely the external shape and stratification described by M. Bailly.\r\nThey form about a quarter of his girdle of ramparts. Although these\r\nmountains now stand quite detached, being separated from each other by\r\nbreaches, even several miles in width, through which deluges of lava\r\nhave flowed from the interior of the island; nevertheless, seeing their\r\nclose general similarity, one must feel convinced that they originally\r\nformed parts of one continuous mass. Judging from the beautiful map of\r\nthe Mauritius, published by the Admiralty from a French MS., there is a\r\nrange of mountains (M. Bamboo) on the opposite side of the island,\r\nwhich correspond in height, relative position, and external form, with\r\nthose just described. Whether the girdle was ever complete may well be\r\ndoubted; but from M. Bailly’s statements, and my own observations, it\r\nmay be safely concluded that mountains with precipitous inland flanks,\r\nand composed of strata dipping outwards, once extended round a\r\nconsiderable portion of the circumference of the island. The ring\r\nappears to have been oval and of vast size; its shorter axis, measured\r\nacross from the inner sides of the mountains near Port Louis and those\r\nnear Grand Port, being no less than thirteen geographical miles in\r\nlength. M. Bailly boldly supposes that this enormous gulf, which has\r\nsince been filled up to a great extent by streams of modern lava, was\r\nformed by the sinking in of the whole upper part of one great volcano.\r\n\r\n [4] “Voyage aux Terres Australes,” tome i, p. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] M. Lesson, in his account of this island, in the “Voyage of the\r\n _Coquille_,” seems to follow M. Bailly’s views.\r\n\r\nIt is singular in how many respects those portions of St. Jago and of\r\nMauritius which I visited agree in their geological history. At both\r\nislands, mountains of similar external form, stratification, and (at\r\nleast in their upper beds) composition, follow in a curved chain the\r\ncoast-line. These mountains in each case appear originally to have\r\nformed parts of one continuous mass. The basaltic strata of which they\r\nare composed, from their compact and crystalline structure, seem, when\r\ncontrasted with the neighbouring basaltic streams of subaerial\r\nformation, to have flowed beneath the pressure of the sea, and to have\r\nbeen subsequently elevated. We may suppose that the wide breaches\r\nbetween the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves, during\r\ntheir gradual elevation—of which process, within recent times, there is\r\nabundant evidence on the coast-land of both islands. At both, vast\r\nstreams of more recent basaltic lavas have flowed from the interior of\r\nthe island, round and between the ancient basaltic hills; at both,\r\nmoreover, recent cones of eruption are scattered around the\r\ncircumference of the island; but at neither have eruptions taken place\r\nwithin the period of history. As remarked in the last chapter, it is\r\nprobable that these ancient basaltic mountains, which resemble (at\r\nleast in many respects) the basal and disturbed remnants of two\r\ngigantic volcanoes, owe their present form, structure, and position, to\r\nthe action of similar causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Paul’s Rocks._—This small island is situated in the Atlantic\r\nOcean, nearly one degree north of the equator, and 540 miles distant\r\nfrom South America, in 29° 15′ west longitude. Its highest point is\r\nscarcely fifty feet above the level of the sea; its outline is\r\nirregular, and its entire circumference barely three-quarters of a\r\nmile. This little point of rock rises abruptly out of the ocean; and,\r\nexcept on its western side, soundings were not obtained, even at the\r\nshort distance of a quarter of a mile from its shore. It is not of\r\nvolcanic origin; and this circumstance, which is the most remarkable\r\npoint in its history (as will hereafter be referred to), properly ought\r\nto exclude it from the present volume. It is composed of rocks, unlike\r\nany which I have met with, and which I cannot characterise by any name,\r\nand must therefore describe.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, and one of the most abundant kinds, is a very compact,\r\nheavy, greenish-black rock, having an angular, irregular fracture, with\r\nsome points just hard enough to scratch glass, and infusible. This\r\nvariety passes into others of paler green tints, less hard, but with a\r\nmore crystalline fracture, and translucent on their edges; and these\r\nare fusible into a green enamel. Several other varieties are chiefly\r\ncharacterised by containing innumerable threads of dark-green\r\nserpentine, and by having calcareous matter in their interstices. These\r\nrocks have an obscure, concretionary structure, and are full of\r\nvariously coloured angular pseudo fragments. These angular pseudo\r\nfragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of a brown\r\nsofter kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which,\r\nperhaps, is related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular,\r\ncalcareo-ferruginous, soft stones. There is no distinct stratification,\r\nbut parts are imperfectly laminated; and the whole abounds with\r\ninnumerable veins, and vein-like masses, both small and large. Of these\r\nvein-like masses, some calcareous ones, which contain minute fragments\r\nof shells, are clearly of subsequent origin to the others.\r\n\r\n_A glossy incrustation._—Extensive portions of these rocks are coated\r\nby a layer of a glossy polished substance, with a pearly lustre and of\r\na greyish white colour; it follows all the inequalities of the surface,\r\nto which it is firmly attached. When examined with a lens, it is found\r\nto consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers, their aggregate\r\nthickness being about the tenth of an inch. It is considerably harder\r\nthan calcareous spar, but can be scratched with a knife; under the\r\nblowpipe it scales off, decrepitates, slightly blackens, emits a fetid\r\nodour, and becomes strongly alkaline: it does not effervesce in\r\nacids.[6] I presume this substance has been deposited by water draining\r\nfrom the birds’ dung, with which the rocks are covered. At Ascension,\r\nnear a cavity in the rocks which was filled with a laminated mass of\r\ninfiltrated birds’ dung, I found some irregularly formed, stalactitical\r\nmasses of apparently the same nature. These masses, when broken, had an\r\nearthy texture; but on their outsides, and especially at their\r\nextremities, they were formed of a pearly substance, generally in\r\nlittle globules, like the\r\nenamel of teeth, but more translucent, and so hard as just to scratch\r\nplate-glass. This substance slightly blackens under the blowpipe, emits\r\na bad smell, then becomes quite white, swelling a little, and fuses\r\ninto a dull white enamel; it does not become alkaline; nor does it\r\neffervesce in acids. The whole mass had a collapsed appearance, as if\r\nin the formation of the hard glossy crust the whole had shrunk much. At\r\nthe Abrolhos Islands on the coast of Brazil, where also there is much\r\nbirds’ dung, I found a great quantity of a brown, arborescent substance\r\nadhering to some trap-rock. In its arborescent form, this substance\r\nsingularly resembles some of the branched species of Nullipora. Under\r\nthe blowpipe, it behaves like the specimens from Ascension; but it is\r\nless hard and glossy, and the surface has not the shrunk appearance.\r\n\r\n [6] In my “Journal” I have described this substance; I then believed\r\n that it was an impure phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III ASCENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasaltic lavas.—Numerous craters truncated on the same side.—Singular\r\nstructure of volcanic bombs.—Aeriform explosions.—Ejected granitic\r\nfragments.—Trachytic rocks.—Singular veins.—Jasper, its manner of\r\nformation.—Concretions in pumiceous tuff.—Calcareous deposits and\r\nfrondescent incrustations on the coast.—Remarkable laminated beds,\r\nalternating with, and passing into, obsidian.—Origin of\r\nobsidian.—Lamination of volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 8° S., long. 14°\r\nW. It has the form of an irregular triangle (see map below), each side\r\nbeing about six miles in length. Its highest point is 2,870 feet[1]\r\nabove the level of the sea. The whole is volcanic, and, from the\r\nabsence of proofs to the contrary, I believe of subaerial origin. The\r\nfundamental rock is everywhere of a pale colour, generally compact, and\r\nof a feldspathic nature. In the S.E. portion of the island, where the\r\nhighest land is situated, well characterised trachyte, and other\r\ncongenerous rocks of that varying here and there a hill or single point\r\nof rock (one of which near the sea-coast, north of the Fort, is only\r\ntwo or three yards across) of the trachyte still remaining exposed.\r\n\r\n [1] _Geographical Journal_, vol. v, p. 243.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Island of Ascension PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n_Basaltic rocks._—The overlying basaltic lava is in some parts\r\nextremely vesicular, in others little so; it is of a black colour, but\r\nsometimes contains crystals of glassy feldspar, and seldom much\r\nolivine. These streams appear to have possessed singularly little\r\nfluidity; their side walls and lower ends being very steep, and even as\r\nmuch as between twenty and thirty feet in height. Their surface is\r\nextraordinarily rugged,\r\nand from a short distance appears as if studded with small craters.\r\nThese projections consist of broad, irregularly conical, hillocks,\r\ntraversed by fissures, and composed of the same unequally scoriaceous\r\nbasalt with the surrounding streams, but having an obscure tendency to\r\na columnar structure; they rise to a height between ten and thirty feet\r\nabove the general surface, and have been formed, as I presume, by the\r\nheaping up of the viscid lava at points of greater resistance. At the\r\nbase of several of these hillocks, and occasionally likewise on more\r\nlevel parts, solid ribs, composed of angulo-globular masses of basalt,\r\nresembling in size and outline arched sewers or gutters of brickwork,\r\nbut not being hollow, project between two or three feet above the\r\nsurface of the streams; what their origin may have been, I do not know.\r\nMany of the superficial fragments from these basaltic streams present\r\nsingularly convoluted forms; and some specimens could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from logs of dark-coloured wood without their bark.\r\n\r\nMany of the basaltic streams can be traced, either to points of\r\neruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte, or to\r\nseparate, conical, red-coloured hills, which are scattered over the\r\nnorthern and western borders of the island. Standing on the central\r\neminence, I counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of\r\neruption. The greater number of them had their truncated summits cut\r\noff obliquely, and they all sloped towards the S.E., whence the\r\ntrade-wind blows.[2] This structure no doubt has been caused by the\r\nejected fragments and ashes being always blown, during eruptions, in\r\ngreater quantity towards one side than towards the other. M. Moreau de\r\nJonnes has made a similar observation with respect to the volcanic\r\norifices in the West Indian Islands.\r\n\r\n [2] M. Lesson in the “Zoology of the Voyage of the _Coquille_,” p. 490\r\n has observed this fact. Mr. Hennah (“Geolog. Proceedings,” 1835, p.\r\n 189) further remarks that the most extensive beds of ashes at\r\n Ascension invariably occur on the leeward side of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volcanic bombs._—These occur in great numbers strewed on the ground,\r\nand some of them lie at considerable distances from any points of\r\neruption. They vary in size from that of an apple to that of a man’s\r\nbody; they are either spherical or pear-shaped, or with the hinder part\r\n(corresponding to the tail of a comet) irregular, studded with\r\nprojecting points, and even concave. Their surfaces are rough, and\r\nfissured with branching cracks; their internal structure is either\r\nirregularly scoriaceous and compact, or it presents a symmetrical and\r\nvery curious appearance. An irregular segment of a bomb of this latter\r\nkind, of which I found several, is accurately represented in figure No.\r\n3. Its size was about that of a man’s head. The whole interior is\r\ncoarsely cellular; the cells averaging in diameter about the tenth of\r\nan inch; but nearer the outside they gradually decrease in size. This\r\npart is succeeded by a well-defined shell of compact lava, having a\r\nnearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch; and the shell\r\nis overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely cellular lava (the\r\ncells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth of an inch in\r\ndiameter), which forms the external surface: the line separating the\r\nshell of compact\r\nlava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined. This\r\nstructure is very simply explained, if we suppose a mass of viscid,\r\nscoriaceous matter, to be projected with a rapid, rotatory motion\r\nthrough the air; for whilst the external crust, from cooling, became\r\nsolidified (in the state we now see it), the centrifugal force, by\r\nrelieving the pressure in the interior parts of the bomb, would allow\r\nthe heated vapours to expand their cells; but these being driven by the\r\nsame force against the already-hardened crust, would become, the nearer\r\nthey were to this part, smaller and smaller or less expanded, until\r\nthey became packed into a solid, concentric shell. As we know that\r\nchips from a grindstone[3] can be flirted off, when made to revolve\r\nwith sufficient velocity, we need not doubt that the centrifugal force\r\nwould have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb, in the\r\nmanner here supposed. Geologists have remarked, that the external form\r\nof a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its aerial course, and few\r\nnow see that the internal structure can speak, with almost equal\r\nplainness, of its rotatory movement.\r\n\r\n [3] Nichol’s “Architecture of the Heavens.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fragment of a spherical volcanic bomb.]\r\n\r\nFragment of a spherical volcanic bomb, with the inferior parts coarsely\r\ncellular, coated by a concentric layer of compact lava, and this again\r\nby a crust of finely cellular rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Volcanic bomb of obsidian from Australia.]\r\n\r\nVolcanic bomb of obsidian from Australia. The figure at left gives a\r\nfront view; the figure at right a side view of the same object.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Bory St. Vincent[4] has described some balls of lava from the Isle\r\nof Bourbon, which have a closely similar structure. His explanation,\r\nhowever (if I understand it rightly), is very different from that which\r\nI have given; for he supposes that they have rolled, like snowballs,\r\ndown the sides of the crater. M. Beudant,[5] also, has described some\r\nsingular little balls of obsidian, never more than six or eight inches\r\nin diameter, which he found strewed on the surface of the ground: their\r\nform is always oval; sometimes they are much swollen in the middle, and\r\neven spindle-shaped: their surface is regularly marked with concentric\r\nridges and furrows, all of which on the same ball are at right angles\r\nto one axis: their interior is compact and glassy. M. Beudant supposes\r\nthat masses of lava, when soft, were shot into the air, with a rotatory\r\nmovement round the same axis, and that the form and superficial ridges\r\nof the bombs were thus produced. Sir Thomas Mitchell has given me what\r\nat first appears to be the half of a much flattened oval ball of\r\nobsidian; it has a singular artificial-like appearance, which is well\r\nrepresented (of the natural size) in figure No. 4. It was found in its\r\npresent state, on a great sandy plain between the rivers Darling and\r\nMurray, in Australia, and at the distance of several hundred miles from\r\nany known volcanic region. It seems to have been embedded in some\r\nreddish tufaceous matter; and may have been transported either by the\r\naborigines or by natural means. The external saucer consists of compact\r\nobsidian, of a bottle-green colour, and is filled with finely cellular\r\nblack lava, much less transparent and glassy than the obsidian. The\r\nexternal surface is marked with four or five not quite perfect ridges,\r\nwhich are represented rather too distinctly in figure No. 4. Here,\r\nthen, we have the external structure described by M. Beudant, and the\r\ninternal cellular condition of the bombs from Ascension. The lip of the\r\nsaucer is slightly concave, exactly like the margin of a soup-plate,\r\nand its inner edge overlaps a little the central cellular lava. This\r\nstructure is so symmetrical round the entire circumference, that one is\r\nforced to suppose that the bomb burst during its rotatory course,\r\nbefore being quite solidified, and that the lip and edges were thus\r\nslightly modified and turned inwards. It may be remarked that the\r\nsuperficial ridges are in planes, at right angles to an axis,\r\ntransverse to the longer axis of the flattened oval: to explain this\r\ncircumstance, we may suppose that when the bomb burst, the axis of\r\nrotation changed.\r\n\r\n [4] “Voyage aux Quatre Isles d’Afrique” tome i, p. 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] “Voyage en Hongrie,” tome ii, p. 214.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aeriform explosions._—The flanks of Green Mountain and the surrounding\r\ncountry are covered by a great mass, some hundred feet in thickness, of\r\nloose fragments. The lower beds generally consist of fine-grained,\r\nslightly consolidated tuffs,[6] and the upper beds of great\r\nloose fragments, with alternating finer beds.[7] One white ribbon-like\r\nlayer of decomposed, pumiceous breccia, was curiously bent into deep\r\nunbroken curves, beneath each of the large fragments in the\r\nsuperincumbent stratum. From the relative position of these beds, I\r\npresume that a narrow-mouthed crater, standing nearly in the position\r\nof Green Mountain, like a great air-gun, shot forth, before its final\r\nextinction, this vast accumulation of loose matter. Subsequently to\r\nthis event, considerable dislocations have taken place, and an oval\r\ncircus has been formed by subsidence. This sunken space lies at the\r\nnorth-eastern foot of Green Mountain, and is well represented in Map 2.\r\nIts longer axis, which is connected with a N.E. and S.W. line of\r\nfissure, is three-fifths of a nautical mile in length; its sides are\r\nnearly perpendicular, except in one spot, and about four hundred feet\r\nin height; they consist, in the lower part, of a pale basalt with\r\nfeldspar, and in the upper part, of the tuff and loose ejected\r\nfragments; the bottom is smooth and level, and under almost any other\r\nclimate a deep lake would have been formed here. From the thickness of\r\nthe bed of loose fragments, with which the surrounding country is\r\ncovered, the amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection\r\nmust have been enormous; hence we may suppose it probable that after\r\nthe explosions vast subterranean caverns were left, and that the\r\nfalling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here\r\ndescribed. At the Galapagos Archipelago, pits of a similar character,\r\nbut of a much smaller size, frequently occur at the bases of small\r\ncones of eruption.\r\n\r\n [6] Some of this peperino, or tuff, is sufficiently hard not to be\r\n broken by the greatest force of the fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] On the northern side of the Green Mountain a thin seam, about an\r\n inch in thickness, of compact oxide of iron, extends over a\r\n considerable area; it lies conformably in the lower part of the\r\n stratified mass of ashes and fragments. This substance is of a\r\n reddish-brown colour, with an almost metallic lustre; it is not\r\n magnetic, but becomes so after having been heated under the blowpipe,\r\n by which it is blackened and partly fused. This seam of compact stone,\r\n by intercepting the little rain-water which falls on the island, gives\r\n rise to a small dripping spring, first discovered by Dampier. It is\r\n the only fresh water on the island, so that the possibility of its\r\n being inhabited has entirely depended on the occurrence of this\r\n ferruginous layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ejected granitic fragments._—In the neighbourhood of Green Mountain,\r\nfragments of extraneous rock are not unfrequently found embedded in the\r\nmidst of masses of scoriæ. Lieutenant Evans, to whose kindness I am\r\nindebted for much information, gave me several specimens, and I found\r\nothers myself. They nearly all have a granitic structure, are brittle,\r\nharsh to the touch, and apparently of altered colours. _First_, a white\r\nsyenite, streaked and mottled with red; it consists of\r\nwell-crystallised feldspar, numerous grains of quartz, and brilliant,\r\nthough small, crystals of hornblende. The feldspar and hornblende in\r\nthis and the succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting\r\ngoniometer, and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe. The\r\nfeldspar in these ejected fragments, like the glassy kind in the\r\ntrachyte, is from its cleavage a potash-feldspar. _Secondly_, a\r\nbrick-red mass of feldspar, quartz, and small dark patches of a decayed\r\nmineral; one minute particle of which I was able to ascertain, by its\r\ncleavage, to be hornblende.\r\n_Thirdly_, a mass of confusedly crystallised white feldspar, with\r\nlittle nests of a dark-coloured mineral, often carious, externally\r\nrounded, having a glossy fracture, but no distinct cleavage: from\r\ncomparison with the second specimen, I have no doubt that it is fused\r\nhornblende. _Fourthly_, a rock, which at first appears a simple\r\naggregation of distinct and large-sized crystals of dusty-coloured\r\nLabrador feldspar;[8] but in their interstices there is some white\r\ngranular feldspar, abundant scales of mica, a little altered\r\nhornblende, and, as I believe, no quartz. I have described these\r\nfragments in detail, because it is rare[9] to find granitic rocks\r\nejected from volcanoes with their _minerals unchanged_, as is the case\r\nwith the first specimen, and partially with the second. One other large\r\nfragment, found in another spot, is deserving of notice; it is a\r\nconglomerate, containing small fragments of granitic, cellular, and\r\njaspery rocks, and of hornstone porphyries, embedded in a base of\r\nwacke, threaded by numerous thin layers of a concretionary pitchstone\r\npassing into obsidian. These layers are parallel, slightly tortuous,\r\nand short; they thin out at their ends, and resemble in form the layers\r\nof quartz in gneiss. It is probable that these small embedded fragments\r\nwere not separately ejected, but were entangled in a fluid volcanic\r\nrock, allied to obsidian; and we shall presently see that several\r\nvarieties of this latter series of rock assume a laminated structure.\r\n\r\n [8] Professor Miller has been so kind as to examine this mineral. He\r\n obtained two good cleavages of 86° 30′ and 86° 50′. The mean of\r\n several, which I made, was 86° 30′. Professor Miller states that these\r\n crystals, when reduced to a fine powder, are soluble in hydrochloric\r\n acid, leaving some undissolved silex behind; the addition of oxalate\r\n of ammonia gives a copious precipitate of lime. He further remarks,\r\n that according to Von Kobell, anorthite (a mineral occurring in the\r\n ejected fragments at Mount Somma) is always white and transparent, so\r\n that if this be the case, these crystals from Ascension must be\r\n considered as Labrador feldspar. Professor Miller adds, that he has\r\n seen an account, in Erdmann’s “Journal für tecnische Chemie,” of a\r\n mineral ejected from a volcano which had the external characters of\r\n Labrador feldspar, but differed in the analysis from that given by\r\n mineralogists of this mineral: the author attributed this difference\r\n to an error in the analysis of Labrador feldspar, which is very old.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] Daubeny, in his work on Volcanoes (p. 386), remarks that this is\r\n the case; and Humboldt, in his “Personal Narrative,” vol. i, p. 236,\r\n says “In general, the masses of known primitive rocks, I mean those\r\n which perfectly resemble our granites, gneiss, and mica-slate, are\r\n very rare in lavas: the substances we generally denote by the name of\r\n granite, thrown out by Vesuvius, are mixtures of nepheline, mica, and\r\n pyroxene.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trachytic series of rocks._—Those occupy the more elevated and\r\ncentral, and likewise the south-eastern, parts of the island. The\r\ntrachyte is generally of a pale brown colour, stained with small darker\r\npatches; it contains broken and bent crystals of glassy feldspar,\r\ngrains of specular iron, and black microscopical points, which latter,\r\nfrom being easily fused, and then becoming magnetic, I presume are\r\nhornblende. The greater number of the hills, however, are composed of a\r\nquite white, friable stone, appearing like a trachytic tuff. Obsidian,\r\nhornstone, and several kinds of laminated feldspathic rocks, are\r\nassociated with the trachyte. There is no distinct stratification; nor\r\ncould I distinguish a crateriform structure in any of the hills of this\r\nseries. Considerable dislocations have taken place; and many fissures\r\nin these rocks are yet left open, or are only partially filled with\r\nloose fragments. Within the space,[10] mainly formed of trachyte, some\r\nbasaltic streams have burst forth; and not far from the summit of Green\r\nMountain, there is one stream of quite black, vesicular basalt,\r\ncontaining minute crystals of glassy feldspar, which have a rounded\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n [10] This space is nearly included by a line sweeping round Green\r\n Mountain, and joining the hills, called the Weather Port Signal,\r\n Holyhead, and that denominated (improperly in a geological sense) “the\r\n Crater of an old volcano.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its singular\r\nresemblance, when viewed in mass, to a sedimentary tuff: it was long\r\nbefore I could persuade myself that such was not its origin; and other\r\ngeologists have been perplexed by closely similar formations in\r\ntrachytic regions. In two cases, this white earthy stone formed\r\nisolated hills; in a third, it was associated with columnar and\r\nlaminated trachyte; but I was unable to trace an actual junction. It\r\ncontains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and black microscopical\r\nspecks, and is marked with small darker patches, exactly as in the\r\nsurrounding trachyte. Its basis, however, when viewed under the\r\nmicroscope, is generally quite earthy; but sometimes it exhibits a\r\ndecidedly crystalline structure. On the hill marked “Crater of an old\r\nvolcano,” it passes into a pale greenish-grey variety, differing only\r\nin its colour, and in not being so earthy; the passage was in one case\r\neffected insensibly; in another, it was formed by numerous, rounded and\r\nangular, masses of the greenish variety, being embedded in the white\r\nvariety;—in this latter case, the appearance was very much like that of\r\na sedimentary deposit, torn up and abraded during the deposition of a\r\nsubsequent stratum. Both these varieties are traversed by innumerable\r\ntortuous veins (presently to be described), which are totally unlike\r\ninjected dikes, or indeed any other veins which I have ever seen. Both\r\nvarieties include a few scattered fragments, large and small, of\r\ndark-coloured scoriaceous rocks, the cells of some of which are\r\npartially filled with the white earthy stone; they likewise include\r\nsome huge blocks of a cellular porphyry.[11] These fragments project\r\nfrom the weathered surface, and perfectly resemble fragments embedded\r\nin a true sedimentary tuff. But as it is known that extraneous\r\nfragments of cellular rock are sometimes included in columnar trachyte,\r\nin phonolite,[12] and in other compact lavas, this circumstance is not\r\nany real argument for the sedimentary origin of the white earthy\r\nstone.[13] The insensible passage of the greenish variety\r\ninto the white one, and likewise the more abrupt passage by fragments\r\nof the former being embedded in the latter, might result from slight\r\ndifferences in the composition of the same mass of molten stone, and\r\nfrom the abrading action of one such part still fluid on another part\r\nalready solidified. The curiously formed veins have, I believe, been\r\nformed by siliceous matter being subsequently segregated. But my chief\r\nreason for believing that these soft earthy stones, with their\r\nextraneous fragments, are not of sedimentary origin, is the extreme\r\nimprobability of crystals of feldspar, black microscopical specks, and\r\nsmall stains of a darker colour occurring in the same proportional\r\nnumbers in an aqueous deposit, and in masses of solid trachyte.\r\nMoreover, as I have remarked, the microscope occasionally reveals a\r\ncrystalline structure in the apparently earthy basis. On the other\r\nhand, the partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte,\r\nforming whole mountains, is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n [11] The porphyry is dark coloured; it contains numerous, often\r\n fractured, crystals of white opaque feldspar, also decomposing\r\n crystals of oxide of iron; its vesicles include masses of delicate,\r\n hair-like, crystals, apparently of analcime.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] D’Aubuisson, “Traité de Géognosie,” tome ii, p. 548.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] Dr. Daubeny (on Volcanoes, p. 180) seems to have been led to\r\n believe that certain trachytic formations of Ischia and of the Puy de\r\n Dôme, which closely resemble these of Ascension, were of sedimentary\r\n origin, chiefly from the frequent presence in them “of scoriform\r\n portions, different in colour from the matrix.” Dr. Daubeny adds, that\r\n on the other hand, Brocchi, and other eminent geologists, have\r\n considered these beds as earthy varieties of trachyte; he considers\r\n the subject deserving of further attention.\r\n\r\n_Veins in the earthy trachytic masses._—These veins are extraordinarily\r\nnumerous, intersecting in the most complicated manner both coloured\r\nvarieties of the earthy trachyte: they are best seen on the flanks of\r\nthe “Crater of the old volcano.” They contain crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, black microscopical specks and little dark stains, precisely\r\nas in the surrounding rock; but the basis is very different, being\r\nexceedingly hard, compact, somewhat brittle, and of rather less easy\r\nfusibility. The veins vary much, and suddenly, from the tenth of an\r\ninch to one inch in thickness; they often thin out, not only on their\r\nedges, but in their central parts, thus leaving round, irregular\r\napertures; their surfaces are rugged. They are inclined at every\r\npossible angle with the horizon, or are horizontal; they are generally\r\ncurvilinear, and often interbranch one with another. From their\r\nhardness they withstand weathering, and projecting two or three feet\r\nabove the ground, they occasionally extend some yards in length; these\r\nplate-like veins, when struck, emit a sound, almost like that of a\r\ndrum, and they may be distinctly seen to vibrate; their fragments,\r\nwhich are strewed on the ground, clatter like pieces of iron when\r\nknocked against each other. They often assume the most singular forms;\r\nI saw a pedestal of the earthy trachyte, covered by a hemispherical\r\nportion of a vein, like a great umbrella, sufficiently large to shelter\r\ntwo persons. I have never met with, or seen described, any veins like\r\nthese; but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams, due to some\r\nprocess of segregation, occurring not uncommonly in sandstones,—for\r\ninstance, in the New Red sandstone of England. Numerous veins of jasper\r\nand of siliceous sinter, occurring on the summit of this same hill,\r\nshow that there has been some abundant source of silica, and as these\r\nplate-like veins differ from the trachyte\r\nonly in their greater hardness, brittleness, and less easy fusibility,\r\nit appears probable that their origin is due to the segregation or\r\ninfiltration of siliceous matter, in the same manner as happens with\r\nthe oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n_Siliceous sinter and jasper._—The siliceous sinter is either quite\r\nwhite, of little specific gravity, and with a somewhat pearly fracture,\r\npassing into pinkish pearl quartz; or it is yellowish white, with a\r\nharsh fracture, and it then contains an earthy powder in small\r\ncavities. Both varieties occur, either in large irregular masses in the\r\naltered trachyte, or in seams included in broad, vertical, tortuous,\r\nirregular veins of a compact, harsh stone of a dull red colour,\r\nappearing like a sandstone. This stone, however, is only altered\r\ntrachyte; and a nearly similar variety, but often honeycombed,\r\nsometimes adheres to the projecting plate-like veins, described in the\r\nlast paragraph. The jasper is of an ochre yellow or red colour; it\r\noccurs in large irregular masses, and sometimes in veins, both in the\r\naltered trachyte and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt. The\r\ncells of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or filled with fine,\r\nconcentric layers of chalcedony, coated and studded with bright-red\r\noxide of iron. In this rock, especially in the rather more compact\r\nparts, irregular angular patches of the red jasper are included, the\r\nedges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding mass; other\r\npatches occur having an intermediate character between perfect jasper\r\nand the ferruginous, decomposed, basaltic base. In these patches, and\r\nlikewise in the large vein-like masses of jasper, there occur little\r\nrounded cavities, of exactly the same size and form with the air-cells,\r\nwhich in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined with layers of\r\nchalcedony. Small fragments of the jasper, examined under the\r\nmicroscope, seem to resemble the chalcedony with its colouring matter\r\nnot separated into layers, but mingled in the siliceous paste, together\r\nwith some impurities. I can understand these facts,—namely, the\r\nblending of the jasper into the semi-decomposed basalt,—its occurrence\r\nin angular patches, which clearly do not occupy pre-existing hollows in\r\nthe rock,—and its containing little vesicles filled with chalcedony,\r\nlike those in the scoriaceous lava,—only on the supposition that a\r\nfluid, probably the same fluid which deposited the chalcedony in the\r\nair-cells, removed in those parts where there were no cavities, the\r\ningredients of the basaltic rock, and left in their place silica and\r\niron, and thus produced the jasper. In some specimens of silicified\r\nwood, I have observed, that in the same manner as in the basalt, the\r\nsolid parts were converted into a dark-coloured homogeneous stone,\r\nwhereas the cavities formed by the larger sap-vessels (which may be\r\ncompared with the air-vesicles in the basaltic lava) and other\r\nirregular hollows, apparently produced by decay, were filled with\r\nconcentric layers of chalcedony; in this case, there can be little\r\ndoubt that the same fluid deposited the homogeneous base and the\r\nchalcedonic layers. After these considerations, I cannot doubt but that\r\nthe jasper of Ascension may be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified, in\r\nprecisely the same sense as this term is applied to wood, when\r\nsilicified; we are equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of\r\nwood, whilst in a perfect state, is\r\nremoved and replaced by atoms of silica, as we are of the means by\r\nwhich the constituent parts of a volcanic rock could be thus acted\r\non.[14] I was led to the careful examination of these rocks, and to the\r\nconclusion here given, from having heard the Rev. Professor Henslow\r\nexpress a similar opinion, regarding the origin in trap-rocks of many\r\nchalcedonies and agates. Siliceous deposits seem to be very general, if\r\nnot of universal occurrence, in partially decomposed trachytic\r\ntuffs;[15] and as these hills, according to the view above given,\r\nconsist of trachyte softened and altered in situ, the presence of free\r\nsilica in this case may be added as one more instance to the list.\r\n\r\n [14] Beudant (“Voyage en Hongrie,” tome iii, pp. 502, 504) describes\r\n kidney-shaped masses of jasper-opal, which either blend into the\r\n surrounding trachytic conglomerate, or are embedded in it like\r\n chalk-flints; and he compares them with the fragments of opalised\r\n wood, which are abundant in this same formation. Beudant, however,\r\n appears to have viewed the process of their formation rather as one of\r\n simple infiltration than of molecular exchange; but the presence of a\r\n concretion, wholly different from the surrounding matter, if not\r\n formed in a pre-existing hollow, clearly seems to me to require,\r\n either a molecular or mechanical displacement of the atoms, which\r\n occupied the space afterwards filled by it. The jasper-opal of Hungary\r\n passes into chalcedony, and therefore in this case, as in that of\r\n Ascension, jasper seems to be intimately related in origin with\r\n chalcedony.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] Beudant (“Voyage Min.,” tome iii, p. 507) enumerates cases in\r\n Hungary, Germany, Central France, Italy, Greece, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Concretions in pumiceous tuff._—The hill, marked in Map 2 “Crater of\r\nan old volcano,” has no claims to this appellation, which I could\r\ndiscover, except in being surmounted by a circular, very shallow,\r\nsaucer-like summit, nearly half a mile in diameter. This hollow has\r\nbeen nearly filled up with many successive sheets of ashes and scoriæ,\r\nof different colours, and slightly consolidated. Each successive\r\nsaucer-shaped layer crops out all round the margin, forming so many\r\nrings of various colours, and giving to the hill a fantastic\r\nappearance. The outer ring is broad, and of a white colour; hence it\r\nresembles a course round which horses have been exercised, and has\r\nreceived the name of the Devil’s Riding School, by which it is most\r\ngenerally known. These successive layers of ashes must have fallen over\r\nthe whole surrounding country, but they have all been blown away except\r\nin this one hollow, in which probably moisture accumulated, either\r\nduring an extraordinary year when rain fell, or during the storms often\r\naccompanying volcanic eruptions. One of the layers of a pinkish colour,\r\nand chiefly derived from small, decomposed fragments of pumice, is\r\nremarkable, from containing numerous concretions. These are generally\r\nspherical, from half an inch to three inches in diameter; but they are\r\noccasionally cylindrical, like those of iron-pyrites in the chalk of\r\nEurope. They consist of a very tough, compact, pale-brown stone, with a\r\nsmooth and even fracture. They are divided into concentric layers by\r\nthin white partitions, resembling the external superficies; six or\r\neight of such layers are distinctly defined near the outside; but those\r\ntowards the inside generally become indistinct, and blend into a\r\nhomogeneous\r\nmass. I presume that these concentric layers were formed by the\r\nshrinking of the concretion, as it became compact. The interior part is\r\ngenerally fissured by minute cracks or septaria, which are lined, both\r\nby black, metallic, and by other white and crystalline specks, the\r\nnature of which I was unable to ascertain. Some of the larger\r\nconcretions consist of a mere spherical shell, filled with slightly\r\nconsolidated ashes. The concretions contain a small proportion of\r\ncarbonate of lime: a fragment placed under the blowpipe decrepitates,\r\nthen whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel, but does not become\r\ncaustic. The surrounding ashes do not contain any carbonate of lime;\r\nhence the concretions have probably been formed, as is so often the\r\ncase, by the aggregation of this substance. I have not met with any\r\naccount of similar concretions; and considering their great toughness\r\nand compactness, their occurrence in a bed, which probably has been\r\nsubjected only to atmospheric moisture, is remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Formation of calcareous rocks on the sea-coast._—On several of the\r\nsea-beaches, there are immense accumulations of small, well-rounded\r\nparticles of shells and corals, of white, yellowish, and pink colours,\r\ninterspersed with a few volcanic particles. At the depth of a few feet,\r\nthese are found cemented together into stone, of which the softer\r\nvarieties are used for building; there are other varieties, both coarse\r\nand fine-grained, too hard for this purpose: and I saw one mass divided\r\ninto even layers half an inch in thickness, which were so compact that\r\nwhen struck with a hammer they rang like flint. It is believed by the\r\ninhabitants, that the particles become united in the course of a single\r\nyear. The union is effected by calcareous matter; and in the most\r\ncompact varieties, each rounded particle of shell and volcanic rock can\r\nbe distinctly seen to be enveloped in a husk of pellucid carbonate of\r\nlime. Extremely few perfect shells are embedded in these agglutinated\r\nmasses; and I have examined even a large fragment under a microscope,\r\nwithout being able to discover the least vestige of striæ or other\r\nmarks of external form: this shows how long each particle must have\r\nbeen rolled about, before its turn came to be embedded and\r\ncemented.[16] One of the most compact varieties, when placed in acid,\r\nwas entirely dissolved, with the exception of some flocculent animal\r\nmatter; its specific gravity was 2·63. The specific gravity of ordinary\r\nlimestone varies from 2·6 to 2·75; pure Carrara marble was found by Sir\r\nH. De la Beche[17] to be 2·7. It is remarkable that these rocks of\r\nAscension, formed close to the surface, should be nearly as compact as\r\nmarble, which has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the\r\nplutonic regions.\r\n\r\n [16] The eggs of the turtle being buried by the parent, sometimes\r\n become enclosed in the solid rock. Mr. Lyell has given a figure\r\n (“Principles of Geology,” book iii, ch. 17) of some eggs, containing\r\n the bones of young turtles, found thus entombed.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] “Researches in Theoretical Geology,” p. 12.\r\n\r\nThe great accumulation of loose calcareous particles, lying on the\r\nbeach near the Settlement, commences in the month of October, moving\r\ntowards the S.W., which, as I was informed by Lieutenant\r\nEvans, is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the\r\ncurrents. At this period the tidal rocks, at the S.W. end of the beach,\r\nwhere the calcareous sand is accumulating, and round which the currents\r\nsweep, become gradually coated with a calcareous incrustation, half an\r\ninch in thickness. It is quite white, compact, with some parts slightly\r\nspathose, and is firmly attached to the rock. After a short time it\r\ngradually disappears, being either redissolved, when the water is less\r\ncharged with lime, or more probably is mechanically abraded. Lieutenant\r\nEvans has observed these facts, during the six years he has resided at\r\nAscension. The incrustation varies in thickness in different years: in\r\n1831 it was unusually thick. When I was there in July, there was no\r\nremnant of the incrustation; but on a point of basalt, from which the\r\nquarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone, the\r\nincrustation was perfectly preserved. Considering the position of the\r\ntidal-rocks, and the period at which they become coated, there can be\r\nno doubt that the movement and disturbance of the vast accumulation of\r\ncalcareous particles, many of them being partially agglutinated\r\ntogether, cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime, that they deposit it on the first objects against\r\nwhich they impinge. I have been informed by Lieutenant Holland, R.N.,\r\nthat this incrustation is formed on many parts of the coast, on most of\r\nwhich, I believe, there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells.\r\n\r\n_A frondescent calcareous incrustation._—In many respects this is a\r\nsingular deposit; it coats throughout the year the tidal volcanic\r\nrocks, that project from the beaches composed of broken shells. Its\r\ngeneral appearance is well represented in Figure 5; but the fronds or\r\ndiscs, of which it is composed, are generally so closely crowded\r\ntogether as to touch. These fronds have their sinuous edges finely\r\ncrenulated, and they project over their pedestals or supports; their\r\nupper surfaces are either slightly concave, or slightly convex; they\r\nare highly polished, and of a dark grey or jet black colour; their form\r\nis irregular, generally circular, and from the tenth of an inch to one\r\ninch and a half in diameter; their thickness, or amount of their\r\nprojection from the rock on which they stand, varies much, about a\r\nquarter of an inch being perhaps most usual. The fronds occasionally\r\nbecome more and more convex, until they pass into botryoidal masses\r\nwith their summits fissured; when in this state, they are glossy and of\r\nan intense black, so as to resemble some fused metallic substance. I\r\nhave shown the incrustation, both in this latter and in its ordinary\r\nstate to several geologists, but not one could conjecture its origin,\r\nexcept that perhaps it was of volcanic nature!\r\n\r\nNo. 5\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An incrustration of calcareous and animal matter.]\r\n\r\nAn incrustation of calcareous and animal matter, coating the\r\ntidal-rocks at Ascension.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often almost\r\ncrystalline fracture; the edges being translucent, and hard enough\r\neasily to scratch calcareous spar. Under the blowpipe it immediately\r\nbecomes white, and emits a strong animal odour, like that from fresh\r\nshells. It is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime; when placed in\r\nmuriatic acid it froths much, leaving a residue of sulphate of lime,\r\nand of an oxide of iron, together with a black powder, which is not\r\nsoluble in heated acids. This latter substance seems to be\r\ncarbonaceous,\r\nand is evidently the colouring matter. The sulphate of lime is\r\nextraneous, and occurs in distinct, excessively minute, lamellar\r\nplates, studded on the surface of the fronds, and embedded between the\r\nfine layers of which they are composed; when a fragment is heated in\r\nthe blowpipe, these lamellæ are immediately rendered visible. The\r\noriginal outline of the fronds may often be traced, either to a minute\r\nparticle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock, or to several\r\ncemented together; these first become deeply corroded, by the\r\ndissolving power of the waves, into sharp ridges, and then are coated\r\nwith successive layers of the glossy, grey, calcareous incrustation.\r\nThe inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every\r\nsuccessive layer, in the same manner as may often be seen in\r\nbezoar-stones, when an object like a nail forms the centre of\r\naggregation. The crenulated edges, however, of the frond appear to be\r\ndue to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit, alternating\r\nwith fresh depositions. On some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of\r\nSt. Jago, I found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter,\r\nwhich under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and\r\npolished fronds of Ascension; in this case a basis was not afforded by\r\nany projecting extraneous particles. Although the incrustation at\r\nAscension is persistent throughout the year; yet from the abraded\r\nappearance of some parts, and from the fresh appearance of other parts,\r\nthe whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation, due\r\nprobably to changes in the form of the shifting beach, and consequently\r\nin the action of the breakers: hence probably it is, that the\r\nincrustation never acquires a great thickness. Considering the position\r\nof the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach, together\r\nwith its composition, I think there can be no doubt that its origin is\r\ndue to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter\r\ncomposing the rounded particles of shells and corals.[18] From this\r\nsource\r\nit derives its animal matter, which is evidently the colouring\r\nprinciple. The nature of the deposit, in its incipient stage, can often\r\nbe well seen upon a fragment of white shell, when jammed between two of\r\nthe fronds; it then appears exactly like the thinnest wash of a pale\r\ngrey varnish. Its darkness varies a little, but the jet blackness of\r\nsome of the fronds and of the botryoidal masses seems due to the\r\ntranslucency of the successive grey layers. There is, however, this\r\nsingular circumstance, that when deposited on the under side of ledges\r\nof rock or in fissures, it appears always to be of a pale, pearly grey\r\ncolour, even when of considerable thickness: hence one is led to\r\nsuppose, that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of\r\nthe dark colour, in the same manner as seems to be the case with the\r\nupper and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca, which are\r\nalways dark, compared with their under surfaces and with the parts\r\nhabitually covered by the mantle of the animal. In this\r\ncircumstance,—in the immediate loss of colour and in the odour emitted\r\nunder the blowpipe,—in the degree of hardness and translucency of the\r\nedges,—and in the beautiful polish of the surface,[19] rivalling when\r\nin a fresh state that of the finest Oliva, there is a striking analogy\r\nbetween this inorganic incrustation and the shells of living molluscous\r\nanimals.[20] This appears to me to be an interesting physiological\r\nfact.[21]\r\n\r\n [18] The selenite, as I have remarked is extraneous, and must have\r\n been derived from the sea-water. It is an interesting circumstance\r\n thus to find the waves of the ocean, sufficiently charged with\r\n sulphate of lime, to deposit it on the rocks, against which they dash\r\n every tide. Dr. Webster has described (“Voyage of the _Chanticleer,_”\r\n vol. ii, p. 319) beds of gypsum and salt, as much as two feet in\r\n thickness, left by the evaporation of the spray on the rocks on the\r\n windward coast. Beautiful stalactites of selenite, resembling in form\r\n those of carbonate of lime, are formed near these beds. Amorphous\r\n masses of gypsum, also, occur in caverns in the interior of the\r\n island; and at Cross Hill (an old crater) I saw a considerable\r\n quantity of salt oozing from a pile of scoriæ. In these latter cases,\r\n the salt and gypsum appear to be volcanic products.)\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] From the fact described in my “Journal of Researches” of a\r\n coating of oxide of iron, deposited by a streamlet on the rocks in its\r\n bed (like a nearly similar coating at the great cataracts of the\r\n Orinoco and Nile), becoming finely polished where the surf acts, I\r\n presume that the surf in this instance, also, is the polishing agent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] In the section descriptive of St. Paul’s Rocks, I have described\r\n a glossy, pearly substance, which coats the rocks, and an allied\r\n stalactitical incrustation from Ascension, the crust of which\r\n resembles the enamel of teeth, but is hard enough to scratch\r\n plate-glass. Both these substances contain animal matter, and seem to\r\n have been derived from water in filtering through birds’ dung.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described (“Philosophical\r\n Transactions,” 1836, p. 65) a singular “artificial substance,\r\n resembling shell.” It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly\r\n polished, brown-coloured laminæ, possessing peculiar optical\r\n properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared\r\n with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water. It\r\n is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter,\r\n than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the\r\n strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to\r\n form a solid substance allied to shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singular laminated beds alternating with and passing into\r\nobsidian._—These beds occur within the trachytic district, at the\r\nwestern base of Green Mountain, under which they dip at a high\r\ninclination. They are only partially exposed, being covered up by\r\nmodern ejections; from this cause, I was unable to trace their junction\r\nwith the trachyte, or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream\r\nof lava, or had been injected amidst the overlying strata. There are\r\nthree principal beds of obsidian, of which the thickest forms the base\r\nof the section. The alternating stony layers appear to me eminently\r\ncurious, and shall be first described, and afterwards their passage\r\ninto the obsidian. They have an extremely diversified appearance; five\r\nprincipal varieties may be noticed, but these insensibly blend into\r\neach other by endless gradations.\r\n\r\nFirst.—A pale grey, irregularly and coarsely laminated,[22]\r\nharsh-feeling rock, resembling clay-slate which has been in contact\r\nwith a trap-dike, and with a fracture of about the same degree of\r\ncrystalline structure. This rock, as well as the following varieties,\r\neasily fuses into a pale glass. The greater part is honeycombed with\r\nirregular, angular, cavities, so that the whole has a curious\r\nappearance, and some fragments resemble in a remarkable manner\r\nsilicified logs of decayed wood. This variety, especially where more\r\ncompact, is often marked with thin whitish streaks, which are either\r\nstraight or wrap round, one behind the other, the elongated carious\r\nhollows.\r\n\r\n [22] This term is open to some misinterpretation, as it may be applied\r\n both to rocks divided into laminæ of exactly the same composition, and\r\n to layers firmly attached to each other, with no fissile tendency, but\r\n composed of different minerals, or of different shades of colour. The\r\n term “laminated,” in this chapter, is applied in these latter senses;\r\n where a homogeneous rock splits, as in the former sense, in a given\r\n direction, like clay-slate, I have used the term “fissile.”\r\n\r\nSecondly.—A bluish grey or pale brown, compact, heavy, homogeneous\r\nstone, with an angular, uneven, earthy fracture; viewed, however, under\r\na lens of high power, the fracture is seen to be distinctly\r\ncrystalline, and even separate minerals can be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThirdly.—A stone of the same kind with the last, but streaked with\r\nnumerous, parallel, slightly tortuous, white lines of the thickness of\r\nhairs. These white lines are more crystalline than the parts between\r\nthem; and the stone splits along them: they frequently expand into\r\nexceedingly thin cavities, which are often only just perceptible with a\r\nlens. The matter forming the white lines becomes better crystallised in\r\nthese cavities, and Professor Miller was fortunate enough, after\r\nseveral trials, to ascertain that the white crystals, which are the\r\nlargest, were of quartz,[23] and that the minute green transparent\r\nneedles were augite, or, as they would more generally be called,\r\ndiopside: besides these crystals, there are some minute, dark specks\r\nwithout a trace of\r\ncrystalline, and some fine, white, granular, crystalline matter which\r\nis probably feldspar. Minute fragments of this rock are easily fusible.\r\n\r\n [23] Professor Miller informs me that the crystals which he measured\r\n had the faces _P, z, m_ of the figure (147) given by Haidinger in his\r\n Translation of Mohs; and he adds, that it is remarkable, that none of\r\n them had the slightest trace of faces _r_ of the regular six-sided\r\n prism.\r\n\r\nFourthly.—A compact crystalline rock, banded in straight lines with\r\ninnumerable layers of white and grey shades of colour, varying in width\r\nfrom the thirtieth to the two-hundredth of an inch; these layers seem\r\nto be composed chiefly of feldspar, and they contain numerous perfect\r\ncrystals of glassy feldspar, which are placed lengthways; they are also\r\nthickly studded with microscopically minute, amorphous, black specks,\r\nwhich are placed in rows, either standing separately, or more\r\nfrequently united, two or three or several together, into black lines,\r\nthinner than a hair. When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe,\r\nthe black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads, which\r\nbecome magnetic,—characters that apply to no common mineral except\r\nhornblende or augite. With the black specks there are mingled some\r\nothers of a red colour, which are magnetic before being heated, and no\r\ndoubt are oxide of iron. Round two little cavities, in a specimen of\r\nthis variety, I found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals,\r\nappearing like those of augite or hornblende, but too dull and small to\r\nbe measured by the goniometer; in the specimen, also, I could\r\ndistinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar, grains, which had the\r\naspect of quartz. By trying with a parallel ruler, I found that the\r\nthin grey layers and the black hair-like lines were absolutely straight\r\nand parallel to each other. It is impossible to trace the gradation\r\nfrom the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties, or indeed\r\nthe character of the different layers in the same specimen, without\r\nfeeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the\r\ncrystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect\r\naggregation of diffused matter, into the black and red specks of\r\nhornblende and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nFifthly.—A compact heavy rock, not laminated, with an irregular,\r\nangular, highly crystalline, fracture; it abounds with distinct\r\ncrystals of glassy feldspar, and the crystalline feldspathic base is\r\nmottled with a black mineral, which on the weathered surface is seen to\r\nbe aggregated into small crystals, some perfect, but the greater number\r\nimperfect. I showed this specimen to an experienced geologist, and\r\nasked him what it was; he answered, as I think every one else would\r\nhave done, that it was a primitive greenstone. The weathered surface,\r\nalso, of the banded variety in figure No. 4, strikingly resembles a\r\nworn fragment of finely laminated gneiss.\r\n\r\nThese five varieties, with many intermediate ones, pass and repass into\r\neach other. As the compact varieties are quite subordinate to the\r\nothers, the whole may be considered as laminated or striped. The\r\nlaminæ, to sum up their characteristics, are either quite straight, or\r\nslightly tortuous, or convoluted; they are all parallel to each other,\r\nand to the intercalating strata of obsidian; they are generally of\r\nextreme thinness; they consist either of an apparently homogeneous,\r\ncompact rock, striped with different shades of grey and brown colours,\r\nor of crystalline feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of\r\npurity, and of different thicknesses, with distinct crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar\r\nplaced lengthways, or of very thin layers chiefly composed of minute\r\ncrystals of quartz and augite, or composed of black and red specks of\r\nan augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron, either not crystallised or\r\nimperfectly so. After having fully described the obsidian, I shall\r\nreturn to the subject of the lamination of rocks of the trachytic\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is\r\neffected in several ways: first, angulo-modular masses of obsidian,\r\nboth large and small, abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty, or in an\r\namorphous, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, with a somewhat pearly\r\nfracture. Secondly, small irregular nodules of the obsidian, either\r\nstanding separately, or united into thin layers, seldom more than the\r\ntenth of an inch in thickness, alternate repeatedly with very thin\r\nlayers of a feldspathic rock, which is striped with the finest parallel\r\nzones of colour, like an agate, and which sometimes passes into the\r\nnature of pitchstone; the interstices between the nodules of obsidian\r\nare generally filled by soft white matter, resembling pumiceous ashes.\r\nThirdly, the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into\r\nan angulo-concretionary mass of obsidian. Such masses (as well as the\r\nsmall nodules) of obsidian are of a pale green colour, and are\r\ngenerally streaked with different shades of colour, parallel to the\r\nlaminæ of the surrounding rock; they likewise generally contain minute\r\nwhite sphærulites, of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one\r\nshade of colour, and half in a zone of another shade. The obsidian\r\nassumes its jet black colour and perfectly conchoidal fracture, only\r\nwhen in large masses; but even in these, on careful examination and on\r\nholding the specimens in different lights, I could generally\r\ndistinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness.\r\n\r\nNo. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Opaque brown sphærulites, drawn on an enlarged scale.]\r\n\r\nOpaque brown sphærulites, drawn on an enlarged scale. The upper ones\r\nare externally marked with parallel ridges. The internal radiating\r\nstructure of the lower ones, is much too plainly represented.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A layer, formed by the union of minute brown\r\nsphærulites.\r\n\r\nA layer, formed by the union of minute brown sphærulites, intersecting\r\ntwo other similar layers: the whole represented of nearly the natural\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several respects a\r\nfurther description. It is of a very complicated nature, and consists\r\nof numerous thin, slightly tortuous layers of a pale-coloured\r\nfeldspathic stone, often passing into an imperfect pitchstone,\r\nalternating with layers formed of numberless little globules of two\r\nvarieties of obsidian, and of two kinds of sphærulites, embedded in a\r\nsoft or in a hard pearly base. The sphærulites are either white and\r\ntranslucent, or dark brown and opaque; the former are quite spherical,\r\nof small size, and distinctly radiated from their centre. The dark\r\nbrown sphærulites are less perfectly round, and vary in diameter from\r\nthe twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch; when broken they exhibit\r\ntowards their centres, which are whitish, an obscure radiating\r\nstructure; two of them when united sometimes have only one central\r\npoint of radiation; there is occasionally a trace of or a hollow\r\ncrevice in their centres. They stand either separately, or are united\r\ntwo or three or many together into irregular groups, or more commonly\r\ninto layers, parallel to the stratification of the mass. This union in\r\nmany cases is so perfect, that the two sides of the layer thus formed,\r\nare quite even; and these layers, as they become less brown and opaque,\r\ncannot be distinguished from the alternating layers of the\r\npale-coloured feldspathic stone. The sphærulites, when not united, are\r\ngenerally compressed in the plane of the lamination of the mass; and in\r\nthis same plane, they are often marked internally, by zones of\r\ndifferent\r\nshades of colour, and externally by small ridges and furrows. In the\r\nupper part of figure No. 6, the sphærulites with the parallel ridges\r\nand furrows are represented on an enlarged scale, but they are not well\r\nexecuted; and in the lower part, their usual manner of grouping is\r\nshown. In another specimen, a thin layer formed of the brown\r\nsphærulites closely united together, intersects, as represented in\r\nfigure No. 7, a layer of similar composition; and after running for a\r\nshort space in a slightly curved line, again intersects it, and\r\nlikewise a second layer lying a little way beneath that first\r\nintersected. The small nodules also of obsidian are sometimes\r\nexternally marked with ridges and furrows, parallel to the lamination\r\nof the mass, but always less plainly than the sphærulites. These\r\nobsidian nodules are generally angular, with their edges blunted: they\r\nare often impressed with the form of the adjoining sphærulites, than\r\nwhich they are always larger; the separate nodules seldom appear to\r\nhave drawn each other out by exerting a mutually attractive force. Had\r\nI not found in some cases, a distinct centre of attraction in these\r\nnodules of obsidian, I should have\r\nbeen led to have considered them as residuary matter, left during the\r\nformation of the pearlstone, in which they are embedded, and of the\r\nsphærulitic globules.\r\n\r\nThe sphærulites and the little nodules of obsidian in these rocks so\r\nclosely resemble, in general form and structure, concretions in\r\nsedimentary deposits, that one is at once tempted to attribute to them\r\nan analogous origin. They resemble ordinary concretions in the\r\nfollowing respects: in their external form,—in the union of two or\r\nthree, or of several, into an irregular mass, or into an even-sided\r\nlayer,—in the occasional intersection of one such layer by another, as\r\nin the case of chalk-flints,—in the presence of two or three kinds of\r\nnodules, often close together, in the same basis,—in their fibrous,\r\nradiating structure, with occasional hollows in their centres,—in the\r\nco-existence of a laminary, concretionary, and radiating structure, as\r\nis so well developed in the concretions of magnesian limestone,\r\ndescribed by Professor Sedgwick.[24] Concretions in sedimentary\r\ndeposits, it is known, are due to the separation from the surrounding\r\nmass of the whole or part of some mineral substance, and its\r\naggregation round certain points of attraction. Guided by this fact, I\r\nhave endeavoured to discover whether obsidian and the sphærulites (to\r\nwhich may be added marekanite and pearlstone, both of them occurring in\r\nnodular concretions in the trachytic series) differ in their\r\nconstituent parts, from the minerals generally composing trachytic\r\nrocks. It appears from three analyses, that obsidian contains on an\r\naverage 76 per cent of silica; from one analysis, that sphærulites\r\ncontain 79·12; from two, that marekanite contains 79·25; and from two\r\nother analyses, that pearlstone contains 75·62 of silica.[25] Now, the\r\nconstituent parts of trachyte, as far as they can be distinguished\r\nconsist of feldspar, containing 65·21 of silica; or of albite,\r\ncontaining 69·09; of hornblende, containing 55·27,[26] and of oxide of\r\niron: so that the foregoing glassy concretionary substances all contain\r\na larger proportion of silica than that occurring in ordinary\r\nfeldspathic or trachytic rocks. D’Aubuisson,[27] also, has remarked on\r\nthe large proportion of silica compared with alumina, in six analyses\r\nof obsidian and pearlstone given in Brongniart’s “Mineralogy.” Hence I\r\nconclude, that the foregoing concretions have been formed by a process\r\nof aggregation, strictly analogous to that which takes place in aqueous\r\ndeposits, acting chiefly on the silica, but likewise on some of the\r\nother elements of the surrounding mass, and thus producing the\r\ndifferent concretionary varieties. From the well-known effects of rapid\r\ncooling[28] in giving glassiness of\r\ntexture, it is probably necessary that the entire mass, in cases like\r\nthat of Ascension, should have cooled at a certain rate; but\r\nconsidering the repeated and complicated alterations of nodules and\r\nthin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or\r\ncrystalline, all within the space of a few feet or even inches, it is\r\nhardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates, and\r\nthus have acquired their different textures.\r\n\r\n [24] “Geological Transactions,” vol. 3, part i, p. 37.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] The foregoing analyses are taken from Beudant “Traité de\r\n Minéralogie,” tome ii, p. 113; and one analysis of obsidian from\r\n Phillips’s “Mineralogy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] These analyses are taken from Von Kobell’s “Grundzüge der\r\n Mineralogie,” 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n [27] “Traité de Géogn.,” tome ii, p. 535.\r\n\r\n\r\n [28] This is seen in the manufacture of common glass, and in Gregory\r\n Watts’s experiments on molten trap; also on the natural surfaces of\r\n lava-streams, and on the side-walls of dikes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural sphærulites in these rocks[29] very closely resemble those\r\nproduced in glass, when slowly cooled. In some fine specimens of\r\npartially devitrified glass, in the possession of Mr. Stokes, the\r\nsphærulites are united into straight layers with even sides, parallel\r\nto each other, and to one of the outer surfaces, exactly as in the\r\nobsidian. These layers sometimes interbranch and form loops; but I did\r\nnot see any case of actual intersection. They form the passage from the\r\nperfectly glassy portions, to those nearly homogeneous and stony, with\r\nonly an obscure concretionary structure. In the same specimen, also,\r\nsphærulites differing slightly in colour and in structure, occur\r\nembedded close together. Considering these facts, it is some\r\nconfirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of the\r\nobsidian and natural sphærulites, to find that M. Dartigues,[30] in his\r\ncurious paper on this subject, attributes the production of sphærulites\r\nin glass, to the different ingredients obeying their own laws of\r\nattraction and becoming aggregated. He is led to believe that this\r\ntakes place, from the difficulty in remelting sphærulitic glass,\r\nwithout the whole be first thoroughly pounded and mixed together; and\r\nlikewise from the fact, that the change takes place most readily in\r\nglass composed of many ingredients. In confirmation of M. Dartigues’\r\nview, I may remark, that M. Fleuriau de Bellevue[31] found that the\r\nsphærulitic portions of devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric\r\nacid and under the blowpipe, in a different manner from the compact\r\npaste in which they were embedded.\r\n\r\n [29] I do not know whether it is generally known, that bodies having\r\n exactly the same appearance as sphærulites, sometimes occur in agates.\r\n Mr. Robert Brown showed me in an agate, formed within a cavity in a\r\n piece of silicified wood, some little specks, which were only just\r\n visible to the naked eye: these specks, when placed by him under a\r\n lens of high power, presented a beautiful appearance: they were\r\n perfectly circular, and consisted of the finest fibres of a brown\r\n colour, radiating with great exactness from a common centre. These\r\n little radiating stars are occasionally intersected, and portions are\r\n quite cut off by the fine, ribbon-like zones of colour in the agate.\r\n In the obsidian of Ascension, the halves of a sphærulite often lie in\r\n different zones of colour, but they are not cut off by them, as in the\r\n agate.\r\n\r\n\r\n [30] _Journal de Physique,_ tome 59 (1804), pp. 10, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n [31] _Idem,_ tome 60 (1805), p. 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparison of the obsidian beds and alternating strata of ascension,\r\nwith those of other countries._—I have been struck with much surprise,\r\nhow closely the excellent description of the obsidian rocks of Hungary,\r\ngiven by Beudant,[32] and that by Humboldt, of the same formation in\r\nMexico and Peru,[33] and likewise the descriptions given by several\r\nauthors[34] of the trachytic regions in the Italian islands, agree with\r\nmy observations at Ascension. Many passages might have been transferred\r\nwithout alteration from the works of the above authors, and would have\r\nbeen applicable to this island. They all agree in the laminated and\r\nstratified character of the whole series; and Humboldt speaks of some\r\nof the beds of obsidian being ribboned like jasper.[35] They all agree\r\nin the nodular or concretionary character of the obsidian, and of the\r\npassage of these nodules into layers. They all refer to the repeated\r\nalterations, often in undulatory planes, of glassy, pearly, stony, and\r\ncrystalline layers: the crystalline layers, however, seem to be much\r\nmore perfectly developed at Ascension, than in the above-named\r\ncountries. Humboldt compares some of the stony beds, when viewed from a\r\ndistance, to strata of a schistose sandstone. Sphærulites are described\r\nas occurring abundantly in all cases; and they everywhere seem to mark\r\nthe passage, from the perfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline\r\nbeds.

The obsidians are finely zoned, in quite straight or\r\n curved lines, with exceedingly slight differences of tint, of\r\n cellularity, and of more or less perfect degrees of glassiness.\r\n Tracing some of the less perfectly glassy zones, they are seen to\r\n become studded with minute white sphærulites, which become more and\r\n more numerous, until at last they unite and form a distinct layer: on\r\n the other hand, at Ascension, only the brown sphærulites unite and\r\n form layers; the white ones always being irregularly disseminated.\r\n Some specimens at the Geological Society, said to belong to an\r\n obsidian formation from Mexico, have an earthy fracture, and are\r\n divided in the finest parallel laminæ, by specks of a black mineral,\r\n like the augitic or hornblendic specks in the rocks at Ascension.\r\n\r\n\r\n [36] Beudant’s “Voyage,” tome iii, p. 373.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the close similarity in so many respects, between the obsidian\r\nformations of Hungary, Mexico, Peru, and of some of the Italian\r\nislands, with that of Ascension, I can hardly doubt that in all these\r\ncases, the obsidian and the sphærulites owe their origin to a\r\nconcretionary aggregation of the silica, and of some of the other\r\nconstituent elements, taking place whilst the liquified mass cooled at\r\na certain required rate. It is, however, well-known, that in several\r\nplaces, obsidian has flowed in streams like lava; for instance, at\r\nTeneriffe, at the Lipari Islands, and at Iceland.[37] In these cases,\r\nthe superficial parts are the most\r\nperfectly glassy, the obsidian passing at the depth of a few feet into\r\nan opaque stone. In an analysis by Vauquelin of a specimen of obsidian\r\nfrom Hecla, which probably flowed as lava, the proportion of silica is\r\nnearly the same as in the nodular or concretionary obsidian from\r\nMexico. It would be interesting to ascertain, whether the opaque\r\ninterior portions and the superficial glassy coating contained the same\r\nproportional constituent parts: we know from M. Dufrénoy[38] that the\r\nexterior and interior parts of the same stream of lava sometimes differ\r\nconsiderably in their composition. Even should the whole body of the\r\nstream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed with nodular\r\nobsidian, it would only be necessary, in accordance with the foregoing\r\nfacts, to suppose that lava in these instances had been erupted with\r\nits ingredients mixed in the same proportion, as in the concretionary\r\nobsidian.\r\n\r\n [37] For Teneriffe, see von Buch, “Descript. des Isles Canaries,” pp.\r\n 184 and 190; for the Lipari Islands, see Dolomieu’s “Voyage,” p. 34;\r\n for Iceland, see Mackenzie’s “Travels,” p. 369.\r\n\r\n\r\n [38] “Mémoires pour servir a une Descript. Géolog. de la France,” tome\r\n iv, p. 371.\r\n\r\n_Lamination of volcanic rocks of the trachytic series._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in several and widely distant countries, the strata\r\nalternating with beds of obsidian, are highly laminated. The nodules,\r\nalso, both large and small, of the obsidian, are zoned with different\r\nshades of colour; and I have seen a specimen from Mexico in Mr. Stokes’\r\ncollection, with its external surface weathered[39] into ridges and\r\nfurrows, corresponding with the zones of different degrees of\r\nglassiness: Humboldt,[40] moreover, found on the Peak of Teneriffe, a\r\nstream of obsidian divided by very thin, alternating, layers of pumice.\r\nMany other lavas of the feldspathic series are laminated; thus, masses\r\nof common trachyte at Ascension are divided by fine earthy lines, along\r\nwhich the rock splits, separating thin layers of slightly different\r\nshades of colour; the greater number, also, of the embedded crystals of\r\nglassy feldspar are placed lengthways in the same direction. Mr. P.\r\nScrope[41] has described a remarkable columnar trachyte in the Panza\r\nIslands, which seems to have been injected into an overlying mass of\r\ntrachytic conglomerate: it is striped with zones, often of extreme\r\ntenuity, of different textures and colours; the harder and darker zones\r\nappearing to contain a larger proportion of silica. In another part of\r\nthe island, there are layers of pearlstone and pitchstone, which in\r\nmany respects resemble those of Ascension. The zones in the columnar\r\ntrachyte are generally contorted; they extend uninterruptedly for a\r\ngreat length in a vertical direction, and apparently parallel to the\r\nwalls of the dike-like mass. Von Buch[42] has described at Teneriffe, a\r\nstream of lava\r\ncontaining innumerable thin, plate-like crystals of feldspar, which are\r\narranged like white threads, one behind the other, and which mostly\r\nfollow the same direction. Dolomieu[43] also states, that the grey\r\nlavas of the modern cone of Vulcano, which have a vitreous texture, are\r\nstreaked with parallel white lines: he further describes a solid\r\npumice-stone which possesses a fissile structure, like that of certain\r\nmicaceous schists. Phonolite, which I may observe is often, if not\r\nalways, an injected rock, also, often has a fissile structure; this is\r\ngenerally due to the parallel position of the embedded crystals of\r\nfeldspar, but sometimes, as at Fernando Noronha, seems to be nearly\r\nindependent of their presence.[44] From these facts we see, that\r\nvarious rocks of the feldspathic series have either a laminated or\r\nfissile structure, and that it occurs both in masses which have\r\ninjected into overlying strata, and in others which have flowed as\r\nstreams of lava.\r\n\r\n [39] MacCulloch states (“Classification of Rocks,” p. 531), that the\r\n exposed surfaces of the pitchstone dikes in Arran are furrowed “with\r\n undulating lines, resembling certain varieties of marbled paper, and\r\n which evidently result from some corresponding difference of laminar\r\n structure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [40] “Personal Narrative,” vol. i, p. 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n [41] “Geological Transactions,” vol. ii (second series), p. 195.\r\n\r\n\r\n [42] “Description des Iles Canaries,” p. 184.\r\n\r\n\r\n [43] “Voyage aux Isles de Lipari,” pp. 35 and 85.\r\n\r\n\r\n [44] In this case, and in that of the fissile pumice-stone, the\r\n structure is very different from that in the foregoing cases, where\r\n the laminæ consist of alternate layers of different composition or\r\n texture. In some sedimentary formations, however, which apparently are\r\n homogeneous and fissile, as in glossy clay-slate, there is reason to\r\n believe, according to D’Aubuisson, that the laminæ are really due to\r\n excessively thin, alternating, layers of mica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laminæ of the beds, alternating with the obsidian at Ascension, dip\r\nat a high angle under the mountain, at the base of which they are\r\nsituated; and they do not appear as if they had been inclined by\r\nviolence. A high inclination is common to these beds in Mexico, Peru,\r\nand in some of the Italian islands:[45] on the other hand, in Hungary,\r\nthe layers are horizontal; the laminæ, also, of some of the\r\nlava-streams above referred to, as far as I can understand the\r\ndescriptions given of them, appear to be highly inclined or vertical. I\r\ndoubt whether in any of these cases, the laminæ have been tilted into\r\ntheir present position; and in some instances, as in that of the\r\ntrachyte described by Mr. Scrope, it is almost certain that they have\r\nbeen originally formed with a high inclination. In many of these cases,\r\nthere is evidence that the mass of liquified rock has moved in the\r\ndirection of the laminæ. At Ascension, many of the air-cells have a\r\ndrawn out appearance, and are crossed by coarse semi-glassy fibres, in\r\nthe direction of the laminæ; and some of the layers, separating the\r\nsphærulitic globules, have a scored appearance, as if produced by the\r\ngrating of the globules. I have seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from\r\nMexico, in Mr. Stokes’ collection, with the surfaces of the\r\nbest-defined layers streaked or furrowed with parallel lines; and these\r\nlines or streaks precisely resembled those, produced on the surface of\r\na mass of artificial glass by its having been poured out of a vessel.\r\nHumboldt, also, has described little cavities, which he compares to the\r\ntails of comets, behind sphærulites in laminated obsidian rocks from\r\nMexico, and Mr. Scrope has\r\ndescribed other cavities behind fragments embedded in his laminated\r\ntrachyte, and which he supposes to have been produced during the\r\nmovement of the mass.[46] From such facts, most authors have attributed\r\nthe lamination of these volcanic rocks to their movement whilst\r\nliquified. Although it is easy to perceive, why each separate air-cell,\r\nor each fibre in pumice-stone,[47] should be drawn out in the direction\r\nof the moving mass; it is by no means at first obvious why such\r\nair-cells and fibres should be arranged by the movement, in the same\r\nplanes, in laminæ absolutely straight and parallel to each other, and\r\noften of extreme tenuity; and still less obvious is it, why such layers\r\nshould come to be of slightly different composition and of different\r\ntextures.\r\n\r\n [45] See Phillips’ “Mineralogy,” for the Italian Islands, p. 136. For\r\n Mexico and Peru, see Humboldt’s “Essai Géognostique.” Mr. Edwards also\r\n describes the high inclination of the obsidian rocks of the Cerro del\r\n Navaja in Mexico in the _Proc. of the Geolog. Soc._ June 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n [46] “Geological Transactions,” vol. ii (second series), p. 200 etc.\r\n These embedded fragments, in some instances, consist of the laminated\r\n trachyte broken off and “enveloped in those parts, which still\r\n remained liquid.” Beudant, also, frequently refers in his great work\r\n on “Hungary” (tome iii, p. 386), to trachytic rocks, irregularly\r\n spotted with fragments of the same varieties, which in other parts\r\n form the parallel ribbons. In these cases, we must suppose, that after\r\n part of the molten mass had assumed a laminated structure, a fresh\r\n irruption of lava broke up the mass, and involved fragments, and that\r\n subsequently the whole became relaminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n [47] Dolomieu’s “Voyage,” p. 64.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of these\r\nigneous feldspathic rocks, let us return to the facts so minutely\r\ndescribed at Ascension. We there see, that some of the thinnest layers\r\nare chiefly formed by numerous, exceedingly minute, though perfect,\r\ncrystals of different minerals; that other layers are formed by the\r\nunion of different kinds of concretionary globules, and that the layers\r\nthus formed, often cannot be distinguished from the ordinary\r\nfeldspathic and pitchstone layers, composing a large portion of the\r\nentire mass. The fibrous radiating structure of the sphærulites seems,\r\njudging from many analogous cases, to connect the concretionary and\r\ncrystalline forces: the separate crystals, also, of feldspar all lie in\r\nthe same parallel planes.[48] These allied forces, therefore, have\r\nplayed an important part in the lamination of the mass, but they cannot\r\nbe considered the primary force; for the several kinds of nodules, both\r\nthe smallest and largest, are internally zoned with excessively fine\r\nshades of colour, parallel to the lamination of the whole; and many of\r\nthem are, also, externally marked in the same direction with parallel\r\nridges and furrows, which have not been produced by weathering.\r\n\r\n [48] The formation, indeed, of a large crystal of any mineral in a\r\n rock of mixed composition implies an aggregation of the requisite\r\n atoms, allied to concretionary action. The cause of the crystals of\r\n feldspar in these rocks of Ascension, being all placed lengthways, is\r\n probably the same with that which elongates and flattens all the brown\r\n sphærulitic globules (which behave like feldspar under the blowpipe)\r\n in this same direction.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers, alternating\r\nwith the obsidian, can be distinctly seen to be due to an incipient\r\ncrystallisation of the constituent minerals. The extent to which the\r\nminerals have crystallised can, also, be distinctly seen to be\r\nconnected\r\nwith the greater or less size, and with the number, of the minute,\r\nflattened, crenulated air-cavities or fissures. Numerous facts, as in\r\nthe case of geodes, and of cavities in silicified wood, in primary\r\nrocks, and in veins, show that crystallisation is much favoured by\r\nspace. Hence, I conclude, that, if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock,\r\nany cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures or\r\nzones of less tension (which from the pent-up vapours would often be\r\nexpanded into crenulated air-cavities), the crystallisation of the\r\nconstituent parts, and probably the formation of concretions, would be\r\nsuperinduced or much favoured in such planes; and thus, a laminated\r\nstructure of the kind we are here considering would be generated.\r\n\r\nThat some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic\r\nrocks, during their consolidation, we must admit in the case of the\r\nthin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described by Humboldt, and\r\nof the small, flattened, crenulated air-cells in the laminated rocks of\r\nAscension; for on no other principle can we conceive why the confined\r\nvapours should through their expansion form air-cells or fibres in\r\nseparate, parallel planes, instead of irregularly throughout the mass.\r\nIn Mr. Stokes’ collection, I have seen a beautiful example of this\r\nstructure, in a specimen of obsidian from Mexico, which is shaded and\r\nzoned, like the finest agate, with numerous, straight, parallel layers,\r\nmore or less opaque and white, or almost perfectly glassy; the degree\r\nof opacity and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically\r\nminute, flattened air-cells; in this case, it is scarcely possible to\r\ndoubt but that the mass, to which the fragment belonged, must have been\r\nsubjected to some, probably prolonged, action, causing the tension\r\nslightly to vary in the successive planes.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension,\r\nin masses semi-liquified by heat. In a fragment of devitrified glass, I\r\nhave observed layers of sphærulites which appeared, from the manner in\r\nwhich they were abruptly bent, to have been produced by the simple\r\ncontraction of the mass in the vessel, in which it cooled. In certain\r\ndikes on Mount Etna, described by M. Elie de Beaumont,[49] as bordered\r\nby alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock, one is led to\r\nsuppose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata, which\r\noriginally produced the fissures, continued whilst the injected rock\r\nremained fluid. Guided, however, by Professor Forbes’[50] clear\r\ndescription of the zoned structure of glacier-ice, far the most\r\nprobable explanation of the laminated structure of these feldspathic\r\nrocks appears to be, that they have been stretched whilst slowly\r\nflowing onwards in a pasty condition,[51] in precisely the same manner\r\nas Professor Forbes believes, that the ice of moving glaciers is\r\nstretched and fissured. In both cases,\r\nthe zones may be compared to those in the finest agates; in both, they\r\nextend in the direction in which the mass has flowed, and those exposed\r\non the surface are generally vertical: in the ice, the porous laminæ\r\nare rendered distinct by the subsequent congelation of infiltrated\r\nwater, in the stony feldspathic lavas, by subsequent crystalline and\r\nconcretionary action. The fragment of glassy obsidian in Mr. Stokes’\r\ncollection, which is zoned with minute air-cells must strikingly\r\nresemble, judging from Professor Forbes’ descriptions, a fragment of\r\nthe zoned ice; and if the rate of cooling and nature of the mass had\r\nbeen favourable to its crystallisation or to concretionary action, we\r\nshould here have had the finest parallel zones of different composition\r\nand texture. In glaciers, the lines of porous ice and of minute\r\ncrevices seem to be due to an incipient stretching, caused by the\r\ncentral parts of the frozen stream moving faster than the sides and\r\nbottom, which are retarded by friction: hence in glaciers of certain\r\nforms and towards the lower end of most glaciers, the zones become\r\nhorizontal. May we venture to suppose that in the feldspathic lavas\r\nwith horizontal laminæ, we see an analogous case? All geologists, who\r\nhave examined trachytic regions, have come to the conclusion, that the\r\nlavas of this series have possessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity;\r\nand as it is evident that only matter thus characterised would be\r\nsubject to become fissured and to be formed into zones of different\r\ntensions, in the manner here supposed, we probably see the reason why\r\naugitic lavas, which appear generally to have possessed a high degree\r\nof fluidity, are not,[52] like the feldspathic lavas, divided into\r\nlaminæ of different composition and texture. Moreover, in the augitic\r\nseries, there never appears to be any tendency to concretionary action,\r\nwhich we have seen plays an important part in the lamination of rocks,\r\nof the trachytic series, or at least in rendering that structure\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n [49] “Mém. pour servir,” etc., tome iv, p. 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n [50] _Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,_ 1842, p. 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n [51] I presume that this is nearly the same explanation which Mr.\r\n Scrope had in his mind, when he speaks (“Geolog. Transact.,” vol. ii,\r\n second series, p. 228) of the ribboned structure of his trachytic\r\n rocks, having arisen, from “a linear extension of the mass, while in a\r\n state of imperfect liquidity, coupled with a concretionary process.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [52] Basaltic lavas, and many other rocks, are not unfrequently\r\n divided into thick laminæ or plates, of the same composition, which\r\n are either straight or curved; these being crossed by vertical lines\r\n of fissure, sometimes become united into columns. This structure seems\r\n related, in its origin, to that by which many rocks, both igneous and\r\n sedimentary, become traversed by parallel systems of fissures.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the explanation here advanced of the\r\nlaminated structure of the rocks of the trachytic series, I venture to\r\ncall the attention of geologists to the simple fact, that in a body of\r\nrock at Ascension, undoubtedly of volcanic origin, layers often of\r\nextreme tenuity, quite straight, and parallel to each other, have been\r\nproduced;—some composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside,\r\nmingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldspar,—others\r\nentirely composed of these black augitic specks, with granules of oxide\r\nof iron,—and lastly, others formed of crystalline feldspar, in a more\r\nor less perfect state of purity, together with numerous crystals of\r\nfeldspar, placed lengthways. At this island, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, and in some analogous cases, it is certainly known, that the\r\nlaminæ have originally been formed with their present high inclination.\r\nFacts of this nature are manifestly of importance, with relation to the\r\nstructural\r\norigin of that grand series of plutonic rocks, which like the volcanic\r\nhave undergone the action of heat, and which consist of alternate\r\nlayers of quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV ST. HELENA\r\n\r\n\r\nLavas of the feldspathic, basaltic, and submarine series.—Section of\r\nFlagstaff Hill and of the Barn.—Dikes.—Turk’s Cap and Prosperous\r\nBays.—Basaltic ring.—Central crateriform ridge, with an internal ledge\r\nand a parapet. Cones of phonolite. Superficial beds of calcareous\r\nsandstone.—Extinct land-shells.—Beds of detritus.—Elevation of the\r\nland.—Denudation.—Craters of elevation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole island is of volcanic origin; its circumference, according to\r\nBeatson,[1] is about twenty-eight miles. The central and largest part\r\nconsists of rocks of a feldspathic nature, generally decomposed to an\r\nextraordinary degree; and when in this state, presenting a singular\r\nassemblage of alternating, red, purple, brown, yellow, and white, soft,\r\nargillaceous beds. From the shortness of our visit, I did not examine\r\nthese beds with care; some of them, especially those of the white,\r\nyellow, and brown shades, originally existed as streams of lava, but\r\nthe greater number were probably ejected in the form of scoriæ and\r\nashes: other beds of a purple tint, porphyritic with crystal-shaped\r\npatches of a white, soft substance, which are now unctuous, and yield,\r\nlike wax, a polished streak to the nail, seem once to have existed as\r\nsolid claystone-porphyries: the red argillaceous beds generally have a\r\nbrecciated structure, and no doubt have been formed by the\r\ndecomposition of scoriæ. Several extensive streams, however, belonging\r\nto this series, retain their stony character; these are either of a\r\nblackish-green colour, with minute acicular crystals of feldspar, or of\r\na very pale tint, and almost composed of minute, often scaly, crystals\r\nof feldspar, abounding with microscopical black specks; they are\r\ngenerally compact and laminated; others, however, of similar\r\ncomposition, are cellular and somewhat decomposed. None of these rocks\r\ncontain large crystals of feldspar, or have the harsh fracture peculiar\r\nto trachyte. These feldspathic lavas and tuffs are the uppermost or\r\nthose last erupted; innumerable dikes, however, and great masses of\r\nmolten rock, have subsequently been injected into them. They converge,\r\nas they rise, towards the central curved ridge, of which one point\r\nattains the elevation of 2,700 feet. This ridge is the highest land in\r\nthe island; and it once formed the northern rim of a great crater,\r\nwhence the lavas of this series flowed: from its ruined condition, from\r\nthe southern half having been removed, and from the violent dislocation\r\nwhich the whole island has undergone, its structure is rendered very\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n [1] Governor Beatson’s “Account of St. Helena.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basaltic series._—The margin of the island is formed by a rude circle\r\nof great, black, stratified, ramparts of basalt, dipping seaward, and\r\nworn into cliffs, which are often nearly perpendicular, and vary in\r\nheight from a few hundred feet to two thousand. This circle, or rather\r\nhorse-shoe shaped ring, is open to the south, and is breached by\r\nseveral other wide spaces. Its rim or summit generally projects little\r\nabove the level of the adjoining inland country; and the more recent\r\nfeldspathic lavas, sloping down from the central heights, generally\r\nabut against and overlap its inner margin; on the north-western side of\r\nthe island, however, they appear (judging from a distance) to have\r\nflowed over and concealed portions of it. In some parts, where the\r\nbasaltic ring has been breached, and the black ramparts stand detached,\r\nthe feldspathic lavas have passed between them, and now overhang the\r\nsea-coast in lofty cliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour and\r\nthinly stratified; they are generally highly vesicular, but\r\noccasionally compact; some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron; others abound with\r\ncrystals of augite and grains of olivine. The vesicles are frequently\r\nlined with minute crystals (of chabasie?) and even become amygdaloidal\r\nwith them. The streams are separated from each other by cindery matter,\r\nor by a bright red, friable, saliferous tuff, which is marked by\r\nsuccessive lines like those of aqueous deposition; and sometimes it has\r\nan obscure, concretionary structure. The rocks of this basaltic series\r\noccur nowhere except near the coast. In most volcanic districts the\r\ntrachytic lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we\r\nsee, that a great pile of rock, closely related in composition to the\r\ntrachytic family, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata:\r\nthe number, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite,\r\nwith which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps some\r\ntendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition.\r\n\r\n_Basal submarine lavas._—The lavas of this basal series lie immediately\r\nbeneath both the basaltic and feldspathic rocks. According to Mr.\r\nSeale,[2] they may be seen at intervals on the sea-beach round the\r\nentire island. In the sections which I examined, their nature varied\r\nmuch; some of the strata abound with crystals of augite; others are of\r\na brown colour, either laminated or in a rubbly condition; and many\r\nparts are highly amygdaloidal with calcareous matter. The successive\r\nsheets are either closely united together, or are separated from each\r\nother by beds of scoriaceous rock and of laminated tuff, frequently\r\ncontaining well-rounded fragments. The interstices of these beds are\r\nfilled with gypsum and salt; the gypsum also sometimes occurring in\r\nthin layers. From the large quantity of these two substances, from the\r\npresence of rounded pebbles in the tuffs, and from the abundant\r\namygdaloids, I cannot doubt that these basal volcanic strata flowed\r\nbeneath the sea. This remark ought perhaps to be extended to a part of\r\nthe superincumbent basaltic rocks; but on this point, I was not able to\r\nobtain clear evidence. The\r\nstrata of the basal series, whenever I examined them, were intersected\r\nby an extraordinary number of dikes.\r\n\r\n [2] “Geognosy of the Island of St. Helena.” Mr. Seale has constructed\r\n a gigantic model of St. Helena, well worth visiting, which is now\r\n deposited at Addiscombe College, in Surrey.\r\n\r\n_Flagstaff Hill and the Barn._—I will now describe some of the more\r\nremarkable sections, and will commence with these two hills, which form\r\nthe principal external feature on the north-eastern side of the island.\r\nThe square, angular outline, and black colour of the Barn, at once show\r\nthat it belongs to the basaltic series; whilst the smooth, conical\r\nfigure, and the varied bright tints of Flagstaff Hill, render it\r\nequally clear, that it is composed of the softened, feldspathic rocks.\r\nThese two lofty hills are connected (as is shown in figure No. 8) by a\r\nsharp ridge, which is composed of the rubbly lavas of the basal series.\r\nThe strata of this ridge dip westward, the inclination becoming less\r\nand less towards the Flagstaff; and the upper feldspathic strata of\r\nthis hill can be seen, though with some difficulty, to dip conformably\r\nto the W.S.W. Close to the Barn, the strata of the ridge are nearly\r\nvertical, but are much obscured by innumerable dikes; under this hill,\r\nthey probably change from being vertical into being inclined into an\r\nopposite direction; for the upper or basaltic strata, which are about\r\neight hundred or one thousand feet in thickness, are inclined\r\nnorth-eastward, at an angle between thirty and forty degrees.\r\n\r\nNo. 8\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flagstaff Hill and the Barn.]\r\n\r\nThe double lines represent the basaltic strata; the single, the basal\r\nsubmarine strata; the dotted, the upper feldspathic strata; the dikes\r\nare shaded transversely.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ridge, and likewise the Barn and Flagstaff Hills, are interlaced\r\nby dikes, many of which preserve a remarkable parallelism in a N.N.W.\r\nand S.S.E. direction. The dikes chiefly consist of a rock, porphyritic\r\nwith large crystals of augite; others are formed of a fine-grained and\r\nbrown-coloured trap. Most of these dikes are coated by a glossy\r\nlayer,[3] from one to two-tenths of an inch in thickness, which, unlike\r\ntrue pitchstone, fuses into a black enamel; this layer is evidently\r\nanalogous to the glossy superficial coating of many lava streams. The\r\ndikes can often be followed for great lengths both horizontally and\r\nvertically, and\r\nthey seem to preserve a nearly uniform thickness:[4] Mr. Seale states,\r\nthat one near the Barn, in a height of 1,260 feet, decreases in width\r\nonly four inches,—from nine feet at the bottom, to eight feet and eight\r\ninches at the top. On the ridge, the dikes appear to have been guided\r\nin their course, to a considerable degree, by the alternating soft and\r\nhard strata: they are often firmly united to the harder strata, and\r\nthey preserve their parallelism for such great lengths, that in very\r\nmany instances it was impossible to conjecture, which of the beds were\r\ndikes, and which streams of lava. The dikes, though so numerous on this\r\nridge, are even more numerous in the valleys a little south of it, and\r\nto a degree I never saw equalled anywhere else: in these valleys they\r\nextend in less regular lines, covering the ground with a network, like\r\na spider’s web, and with some parts of the surface even appearing to\r\nconsist wholly of dikes, interlaced by other dikes.\r\n\r\n [3] This circumstance has been observed (Lyell, “Principles of\r\n Geology,” vol. iv, chap. x, p. 9) in the dikes of the Atrio del\r\n Cavallo, but apparently it is not of very common occurrence. Sir G.\r\n Mackenzie, however, states (p. 372, “Travels in Iceland”) that all the\r\n veins in Iceland have a “black vitreous coating on their sides.”\r\n Captain Carmichael, speaking of the dikes in Tristan d’Acunha, a\r\n volcanic island in the Southern Atlantic, says (“Linnæan\r\n Transactions,” vol. xii, p. 485) that their sides, “where they come in\r\n contact with the rocks, are invariably in a semi-vitrified state.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] “Geognosy of the Island of St. Helena,” plate 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the complexity produced by the dikes, from the high inclination\r\nand anticlinal dip of the strata of the basal series, which are\r\noverlaid, at the opposite ends of the short ridge, by two great masses\r\nof different ages and of different composition, I am not surprised that\r\nthis singular section has been misunderstood. It has even been supposed\r\nto form part of a crater; but so far is this from having been the case,\r\nthat the summit of Flagstaff Hill once formed the lower extremity of a\r\nsheet of lava and ashes, which were erupted from the central,\r\ncrateriform ridge. Judging from the slope of the contemporaneous\r\nstreams in an adjoining and undisturbed part of the island, the strata\r\nof the Flagstaff Hill must have been upturned at least twelve hundred\r\nfeet, and probably much more, for the great truncated dikes on its\r\nsummit show that it has been largely denuded. The summit of this hill\r\nnow nearly equals in height the crateriform ridge; and before having\r\nbeen denuded, it was probably higher than this ridge, from which it is\r\nseparated by a broad and much lower tract of country; we here,\r\ntherefore, see that the lower extremities of a set of lava-streams have\r\nbeen tilted up to as great a height as, or perhaps greater height than,\r\nthe crater, down the flanks of which they originally flowed. I believe\r\nthat dislocations on so grand a scale are extremely rare[5] in volcanic\r\ndistricts. The formation of such numbers of dikes in this part of the\r\nisland shows that the surface must here have been stretched to a quite\r\nextraordinary degree: this stretching, on the ridge between Flagstaff\r\nand Barn Hills, probably took place subsequently (though perhaps\r\nimmediately so) to the strata being tilted; for had the strata at that\r\ntime extended horizontally, they would in all probability have been\r\nfissured and injected transversely, instead of in the planes of their\r\nstratification. Although the space between the Barn and Flagstaff Hill\r\npresents a distinct anticlinal line extending north and south, and\r\nthough most of the dikes range with much regularity in the same line,\r\nnevertheless, at only a mile due south of the ridge the strata lie\r\nundisturbed. Hence the disturbing force seems to have acted under\r\na point, rather than along a line. The manner in which it has acted, is\r\nprobably explained by the structure of Little Stony-top, a mountain\r\n2,000 feet high, situated a few miles southward of the Barn; we there\r\nsee, even from a distance, a dark-coloured, sharp, wedge of compact\r\ncolumnar rock, with the bright-coloured feldspathic strata, sloping\r\naway on each side from its uncovered apex. This wedge, from which it\r\nderives its name of Stony-top, consists of a body of rock, which has\r\nbeen injected whilst liquified into the overlying strata; and if we may\r\nsuppose that a similar body of rock lies injected, beneath the ridge\r\nconnecting the Barn and Flagstaff, the structure there exhibited would\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\n [5] M. Constant Prevost (“Mém. de la Soc. Géolog.,” tome ii) observes\r\n that “les produits volcaniques n’ont que localement et rarement même\r\n dérangé le sol, à travers lequel ils se sont fait jour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prosperous Hill and The Barn.]\r\n\r\nThe double lines represent the basaltic strata; the single, the basal\r\nsubmarine strata; the dotted, the upper feldspathic strata.\r\n\r\n_Turk’s Cap and Prosperous Bays._—Prosperous Hill is a great, black,\r\nprecipitous mountain, situated two miles and a half south of the Barn,\r\nand composed, like it, of basaltic strata. These rest, in one part, on\r\nthe brown-coloured, porphyritic beds of the basal series, and in\r\nanother part, on a fissured mass of highly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal\r\nrock, which seems to have formed a small point of eruption beneath the\r\nsea, contemporaneously with the basal series. Prosperous Hill, like the\r\nBarn, is traversed by many dikes, of which the greater number range\r\nnorth and south, and its strata dip, at an angle of about 20 degrees,\r\nrather obliquely from the island towards the sea. The space between\r\nProsperous Hill and the Barn, as represented in figure No. 9, consists\r\nof lofty cliffs, composed of the lavas of the upper or feldspathic\r\nseries, which rest, though unconformably, on the basal submarine\r\nstrata, as we have seen that they do at Flagstaff Hill. Differently,\r\nhowever, from in that hill, these upper strata are nearly horizontal,\r\ngently rising towards the interior of the island; and they are composed\r\nof greenish-black, or more commonly, pale brown, compact lavas, instead\r\nof softened and highly coloured matter. These brown-coloured, compact\r\nlavas, consist almost entirely of small glimmering scales, or of minute\r\nacicular crystals, of feldspar, placed close by the side of each other,\r\nand abounding with minute black specks, apparently of hornblende. The\r\nbasaltic strata of Prosperous Hill project only a little above the\r\nlevel of the gently-sloping, feldspathic streams, which wind round and\r\nabut against their upturned edges. The inclination of the basaltic\r\nstrata seems to be too great to have been caused by their having flowed\r\ndown a slope, and they must have been tilted into their present\r\nposition before the eruption of the feldspathic streams.\r\n\r\n_Basaltic ring._—Proceeding round the Island, the lavas of the upper\r\nseries, southward of Prosperous Hill, overhang the sea in lofty\r\nprecipices. Further on, the headland, called Great Stony-top, is\r\ncomposed, as I\r\nbelieve, of basalt; as is Long Range Point, on the inland side of which\r\nthe coloured beds abut. On the southern side of the island, we see the\r\nbasaltic strata of the South Barn, dipping obliquely seaward at a\r\nconsiderable angle; this headland, also, stands a little above the\r\nlevel of the more modern, feldspathic lavas. Further on, a large space\r\nof coast, on each side of Sandy Bay, has been much denuded, and there\r\nseems to be left only the basal wreck of the great, central crater. The\r\nbasaltic strata reappear, with their seaward dip, at the foot of the\r\nhill, called Man-and-Horse; and thence they are continued along the\r\nwhole north-western coast to Sugar-Loaf Hill, situated near to the\r\nFlagstaff; and they everywhere have the same seaward inclination, and\r\nrest, in some parts at least, on the lavas of the basal series. We thus\r\nsee that the circumference of the island is formed by a much-broken\r\nring, or rather, a horse-shoe, of basalt, open to the south, and\r\ninterrupted on the eastern side by many wide breaches. The breadth of\r\nthis marginal fringe on the north-western side, where alone it is at\r\nall perfect, appears to vary from a mile to a mile and a half. The\r\nbasaltic strata, as well as those of the subjacent basal series, dip,\r\nwith a moderate inclination, where they have not been subsequently\r\ndisturbed, towards the sea. The more broken state of the basaltic ring\r\nround the eastern half, compared with the western half of the island,\r\nis evidently due to the much greater denuding power of the waves on the\r\neastern or windward side, as is shown by the greater height of the\r\ncliffs on that side, than to leeward. Whether the margin of basalt was\r\nbreached, before or after the eruption of the lavas of the upper\r\nseries, is doubtful; but as separate portions of the basaltic ring\r\nappear to have been tilted before that event, and from other reasons,\r\nit is more probable, that some at least of the breaches were first\r\nformed. Reconstructing in imagination, as far as is possible, the ring\r\nof basalt, the internal space or hollow, which has since been filled up\r\nwith the matter erupted from the great central crater, appears to have\r\nbeen of an oval figure, eight or nine miles in length by about four\r\nmiles in breadth, and with its axis directed in a N.E. and S.W. line,\r\ncoincident with the present longest axis of the island.\r\n\r\n_The central curved ridge._—This ridge consists, as before remarked, of\r\ngrey feldspathic lavas, and of red, brecciated, argillaceous tuffs,\r\nlike the beds of the upper coloured series. The grey lavas contain\r\nnumerous, minute, black, easily fusible specks; and but very few large\r\ncrystals of feldspar. They are generally much softened; with the\r\nexception of this character, and of being in many parts highly\r\ncellular, they are quite similar to those great sheets of lava which\r\noverhang the coast at Prosperous Bay. Considerable intervals of time\r\nappear to have elapsed, judging from the marks of denudation, between\r\nthe formation of the successive beds, of which this ridge is composed.\r\nOn the steep northern slope, I observed in several sections a much worn\r\nundulating surface of red tuff, covered by grey, decomposed,\r\nfeldspathic lavas, with only a thin earthy layer interposed between\r\nthem. In an adjoining part, I noticed a trap-dike, four feet wide, cut\r\noff and covered up by the feldspathic lava, as is represented in figure\r\nNo. 9. The ridge ends on the eastern side in a hook, which is not\r\nrepresented clearly enough in any\r\nmap which I have seen; towards the western end, it gradually slopes\r\ndown and divides into several subordinate ridges. The best defined\r\nportion between Diana’s Peak and Nest Lodge, which supports the highest\r\npinnacles in the island varying from 2,000 to 2,700 feet, is rather\r\nless than three miles long in a straight line. Throughout this space\r\nthe ridge has a uniform appearance and structure; its curvature\r\nresembles that of the coast-line of a great bay, being made up of many\r\nsmaller curves, all open to the south. The northern and outer side is\r\nsupported by narrow ridges or buttresses, which slope down to the\r\nadjoining country. The inside is much steeper, and is almost\r\nprecipitous; it is formed of the basset edges of the strata, which\r\ngently decline outwards. Along some parts of the inner side, a little\r\nway beneath the summit, a flat ledge extends, which imitates in outline\r\nthe smaller curvatures of the crest. Ledges of this kind occur not\r\nunfrequently within volcanic craters, and their formation seems to be\r\ndue to the sinking down of a level sheet of hardened lava, the edges of\r\nwhich remain (like the ice round a pool, from which the water has been\r\ndrained) adhering to the sides.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] A most remarkable instance of this structure is described in Ellis\r\n “Polynesian Researches” (second edition), where an admirable drawing\r\n is given of the successive ledges or terraces, on the borders of the\r\n immense crater at Hawaii, in the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 10\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dike]\r\n\r\n1—Grey feldspathic lava.\r\n2—A layer, one inch in thickness, of a reddish earthy matter.\r\n3—Brecciated, red, argillaceous tuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some parts, the ridge is surmounted by a wall or parapet,\r\nperpendicular on both sides. Near Diana’s Peak this wall is extremely\r\nnarrow. At the Galapagos Archipelago I observed parapets, having a\r\nquite similar structure and appearance, surmounting several of the\r\ncraters; one, which I more particularly examined, was composed of\r\nglossy, red scoriæ firmly cemented together; being externally\r\nperpendicular, and extending round nearly the whole circumference of\r\nthe crater, it rendered it almost inaccessible. The Peak of Teneriffe\r\nand Cotopaxi, according to Humboldt, are similarly constructed; he\r\nstates[7] that “at their summits a circular wall surrounds the crater,\r\nwhich wall, at a distance, has the appearance of a small cylinder\r\nplaced on a truncated cone. On Cotopaxi[8] this peculiar structure is\r\nvisible to the naked eye at more than two thousand toises’ distance;\r\nand no person has ever reached its crater. On the Peak of Teneriffe,\r\nthe parapet is so high, that it would be impossible to reach the\r\ncaldera, if on the eastern side there did not exist a breach.” The\r\norigin of these circular parapets is probably due to the heat or\r\nvapours from the crater, penetrating and hardening the sides to a\r\nnearly equal depth, and afterwards to the mountain being slowly acted\r\non by the weather, which would leave the hardened part, projecting in\r\nthe form of a cylinder or circular parapet.\r\n\r\n [7] “Personal Narrative,” vol. i, p. 171.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Humboldt’s “Picturesque Atlas,” folio, pl. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the points of structure in the central ridge, now\r\nenumerated,—namely, from the convergence towards it of the beds of the\r\nupper series,—from the lavas there becoming highly cellular,—from the\r\nflat ledge, extending along its inner and precipitous side, like that\r\nwithin some still active craters,—from the parapet-like wall on its\r\nsummit,—and lastly, from its peculiar curvature, unlike that of any\r\ncommon line of elevation, I cannot doubt that this curved ridge forms\r\nthe last remnant of a great crater. In endeavouring, however, to trace\r\nits former outline, one is soon baffled; its western extremity\r\ngradually slopes down, and, branching into other ridges, extends to the\r\nsea-coast; the eastern end is more curved, but it is only a little\r\nbetter defined. Some appearances lead me to suppose that the southern\r\nwall of the crater joined the present ridge near Nest Lodge; in this\r\ncase the crater must have been nearly three miles long, and about a\r\nmile and a half in breadth. Had the denudation of the ridge and the\r\ndecomposition of its constituent rocks proceeded a few steps further,\r\nand had this ridge, like several other parts of the island, been broken\r\nup by great dikes and masses of injected matter, we should in vain have\r\nendeavoured to discover its true nature. Even now we have seen that at\r\nFlagstaff Hill the lower extremity and most distant portion of one\r\nsheet of the erupted matter has been upheaved to as great a height as\r\nthe crater down which it flowed, and probably even to a greater height.\r\nIt is interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a\r\nvolcanic district becomes obscured, and finally obliterated: so near to\r\nthis last stage is St. Helena, that I believe no one has hitherto\r\nsuspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is the last\r\nwreck of the crater, whence the most modern volcanic streams were\r\npoured forth.\r\n\r\nThe great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved ridge,\r\nacross which the half of the crater must once have extended, is formed\r\nof bare, water-worn hillocks and ridges of red, yellow, and brown\r\nrocks, mingled together in chaos-like confusion, interlaced by dikes,\r\nand without any regular stratification. The chief part consists of red\r\ndecomposing scoriæ, associated with various kinds of tuff and yellow\r\nargillaceous beds, full of broken crystals, those of augite being\r\nparticularly large. Here and there masses of highly cellular and\r\namygdaloidal lavas protrude. From one of the ridges in the midst of the\r\nvalley, a conical precipitous hill, called Lot, boldly stands up, and\r\nforms a most singular and conspicuous object. It is composed of\r\nphonolite, divided in one part into great curved laminæ, in another,\r\ninto angular concretionary balls, and in a third part into outwardly\r\nradiating columns. At its base the strata of lava, tuff, and scoriæ,\r\ndip away on all sides;[9] the uncovered portion is 197 feet[10] in\r\nheight, and its horizontal section gives an oval figure. The phonolite\r\nis of a greenish-grey\r\ncolour, and is full of minute acicular crystals of feldspar; in most\r\nparts it has a conchoidal fracture, and is sonorous, yet it is\r\ncrenulated with minute air-cavities. In a S.W. direction from Lot,\r\nthere are some other remarkable columnar pinnacles, but of a less\r\nregular shape, namely, Lot’s Wife, and the Asses’ Ears, composed of\r\nallied kinds of rock. From their flattened shape, and their relative\r\nposition to each other, they are evidently connected on the same line\r\nof fissure. It is, moreover, remarkable that this same N.E. and S.W.\r\nline, joining Lot and Lot’s Wife, if prolonged would intersect\r\nFlagstaff Hill, which, as before stated, is crossed by numerous dikes\r\nrunning in this direction, and which has a disturbed structure,\r\nrendering it probable that a great body of once fluid rock lies\r\ninjected beneath it.\r\n\r\n [9] Abich in his “Views of Vesuvius” (plate vi), has shown the manner\r\n in which beds, under nearly similar circumstances, are tilted up. The\r\n upper beds are more turned up than the lower; and he accounts for\r\n this, by showing that the lava insinuates itself horizontally between\r\n the lower beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] This height is given by Mr. Seale in his Geognosy of the island.\r\n The height of the summit above the level of the sea is said to be\r\n 1,444 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this same great valley there are several other conical masses of\r\ninjected rock (one, I observed, was composed of compact greenstone),\r\nsome of which are not connected, as far as is apparent, with any line\r\nof dike; whilst others are obviously thus connected. Of these dikes,\r\nthree or four great lines stretch across the valley in a N.E. and S.W.\r\ndirection, parallel to that one connecting the Asses’ Ears, Lot’s Wife,\r\nand probably Lot. The number of these masses of injected rock is a\r\nremarkable feature in the geology of St. Helena. Besides those just\r\nmentioned, and the hypothetical one beneath Flagstaff Hill, there is\r\nLittle Stony-top and others, as I have reason to believe, at the\r\nMan-and-Horse, and at High Hill. Most of these masses, if not all of\r\nthem, have been injected subsequently to the last volcanic eruptions\r\nfrom the central crater. The formation of conical bosses of rock on\r\nlines of fissure, the walls of which are in most cases parallel, may\r\nprobably be attributed to inequalities in the tension, causing small\r\ntransverse fissures, and at these points of intersection the edges of\r\nthe strata would naturally yield, and be easily turned upwards.\r\nFinally, I may remark, that hills of phonolite everywhere are apt[11]\r\nto assume singular and even grotesque shapes, like that of Lot: the\r\npeak at Fernando Noronha offers an instance; at St. Jago, however, the\r\ncones of phonolite, though tapering, have a regular form. Supposing, as\r\nseems probable, that all such hillocks or obelisks have originally been\r\ninjected, whilst liquified, into a mould formed by yielding strata, as\r\ncertainly has been the case with Lot, how are we to account for the\r\nfrequent abruptness and singularity of their outlines, compared with\r\nsimilarly injected masses of greenstone and basalt? Can it be due to a\r\nless perfect degree of fluidity, which is generally supposed to be\r\ncharacteristic of the allied trachytic lavas?\r\n\r\n [11] D’Aubuisson, in his “Traité de Géognosie” (tome ii, p. 540)\r\n particularly remarks that this is the case.\r\n\r\n_Superficial deposits._—Soft calcareous sandstone occurs in extensive,\r\nthough thin, superficial beds, both on the northern and southern shores\r\nof the island. It consists of very minute, equal-sized, rounded\r\nparticles of shells, and other organic bodies, which partially retain\r\ntheir yellow, brown, and pink colours, and occasionally, though very\r\nrarely, present an obscure trace of their original external forms. I in\r\nvain endeavoured to find a single unrolled fragment of a shell. The\r\ncolour of the particles\r\nis the most obvious character by which their origin can be recognised,\r\nthe tints being affected (and an odour produced) by a moderate heat, in\r\nthe same manner as in fresh shells. The particles are cemented\r\ntogether, and are mingled with some earthy matter: the purest masses,\r\naccording to Beatson, contain 70 per cent of carbonate of lime. The\r\nbeds, varying in thickness from two or three feet to fifteen feet, coat\r\nthe surface of the ground; they generally lie on that side of the\r\nvalley which is protected from the wind, and they occur at the height\r\nof several hundred feet above the level of the sea. Their position is\r\nthe same which sand, if now drifted by the trade-wind, would occupy;\r\nand no doubt they thus originated, which explains the equal size and\r\nminuteness of the particles, and likewise the entire absence of whole\r\nshells, or even of moderately-sized fragments. It is remarkable that at\r\nthe present day there are no shelly beaches on any part of the coast,\r\nwhence calcareous dust could be drifted and winnowed; we must,\r\ntherefore, look back to a former period when before the land was worn\r\ninto the present great precipices, a shelving coast, like that of\r\nAscension, was favourable to the accumulation of shelly detritus. Some\r\nof the beds of this limestone are between six hundred and seven hundred\r\nfeet above the sea; but part of this height may possibly be due to an\r\nelevation of the land, subsequent to the accumulation of the calcareous\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThe percolation of rain-water has consolidated parts of these beds into\r\na solid rock, and has formed masses of dark brown, stalagmitic\r\nlimestone. At the Sugar-Loaf quarry, fragments of rock on the adjoining\r\nslopes[12] have been thickly coated by successive fine layers of\r\ncalcareous matter. It is singular, that many of these pebbles have\r\ntheir entire surfaces coated, without any point of contact having been\r\nleft uncovered; hence, these pebbles must have been lifted up by the\r\nslow deposition between them of the successive films of carbonate of\r\nlime. Masses of white, finely oolitic rock are attached to the outside\r\nof some of these coated pebbles. Von Buch has described a compact\r\nlimestone at Lanzarote, which seems perfectly to resemble the\r\nstalagmitic deposition just mentioned: it coats pebbles, and in parts\r\nis finely oolitic: it forms a far-extended layer, from one inch to two\r\nor three feet in thickness, and it occurs at the height of 800 feet\r\nabove the sea, but only on that side of the island exposed to the\r\nviolent north-western winds. Von Buch remarks,[13] that it is not found\r\nin hollows, but only on the unbroken and inclined surfaces of the\r\nmountain. He believes, that it has been deposited by the spray which is\r\nborne over the whole island by these violent winds. It appears,\r\nhowever, to me much more probable that it has been formed, as at St.\r\nHelena, by the percolation of water through finely comminuted shells:\r\nfor when sand is blown on\r\na much-exposed coast, it always tends to accumulate on broad, even\r\nsurfaces, which offer a uniform resistance to the winds. At the\r\nneighbouring island, moreover, of Feurteventura,[14] there is an earthy\r\nlimestone, which, according to Von Buch, is quite similar to specimens\r\nwhich he has seen from St. Helena, and which he believes to have been\r\nformed by the drifting of shelly detritus.\r\n\r\n [12] In the earthy detritus on several parts of this hill, irregular\r\n masses of very impure, crystallised sulphate of lime occur. As this\r\n substance is now being abundantly deposited by the surf at Ascension,\r\n it is possible that these masses may thus have originated; but if so,\r\n it must have been at a period when the land stood at a much lower\r\n level. This earthy selenite is now found at a height of between six\r\n hundred and seven hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] “Description des Isles Canaries,” p. 293.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] _Idem,_ pp. 314 and 374.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upper beds of the limestone, at the above-mentioned quarry on the\r\nSugar-Loaf Hill, are softer, finer-grained and less pure, than the\r\nlower beds. They abound with fragments of land-shells, and with some\r\nperfect ones; they contain, also, the bones of birds, and the large\r\neggs,[15] apparently of water-fowl. It is probable that these upper\r\nbeds remained long in an unconsolidated form, during which time, these\r\nterrestrial productions were embedded. Mr. G. R. Sowerby has kindly\r\nexamined three species of land-shells, which I procured from this bed,\r\nand has described them in detail. One of them is a Succinea, identical\r\nwith a species now living abundantly on the island; the two others,\r\nnamely, _ Cochlogena fossilis_ and _Helix biplicata_, are not known in\r\na recent state: the latter species was also found in another and\r\ndifferent locality, associated with a species of Cochlogena which is\r\nundoubtedly extinct.\r\n\r\n [15] Colonel Wilkes, in a catalogue presented with some specimens to\r\n the Geological Society, states that as many as ten eggs were found by\r\n one person. Dr. Buckland has remarked (“Geolog. Trans.,” vol. v, p.\r\n 474) on these eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beds of extinct land-shells._—Land-shells, all of which appear to be\r\nspecies now extinct, occur embedded in earth, in several parts of the\r\nisland. The greater number have been found at a considerable height on\r\nFlagstaff Hill. On the N.W. side of this hill, a rain-channel exposes a\r\nsection of about twenty feet in thickness, of which the upper part\r\nconsists of black vegetable mould, evidently washed down from the\r\nheights above, and the lower part of less black earth, abounding with\r\nyoung and old shells, and with their fragments: part of this earth is\r\nslightly consolidated by calcareous matter, apparently due to the\r\npartial decomposition of some of the shells. Mr. Seale, an intelligent\r\nresident, who first called attention to these shells, gave me a large\r\ncollection from another locality, where the shells appear to have been\r\nembedded in very black earth. Mr. G. R. Sowerby has examined these\r\nshells, and has described them. There are seven species, namely, one\r\nCochlogena, two species of the genus Cochlicopa, and four of Helix;\r\nnone of these are known in a recent state, or have been found in any\r\nother country. The smaller species were picked out of the inside of the\r\nlarge shells of the _Cochlogena aurisvulpina._ This last-mentioned\r\nspecies is in many respects a very singular one; it was classed, even\r\nby Lamarck, in a marine genus, and having thus been mistaken for a\r\nsea-shell, and the smaller accompanying species having been overlooked,\r\nthe exact localities where it was found have been measured, and the\r\nelevation of this island thus deduced! It is very remarkable that all\r\nthe shells of this species found by me in one spot, form a distinct\r\nvariety, as described by Mr. Sowerby, from those\r\nprocured from another locality by Mr. Seale. As this Cochlogena is a\r\nlarge and conspicuous shell, I particularly inquired from several\r\nintelligent countrymen whether they had ever seen it alive; they all\r\nassured me that they had not, and they would not even believe that it\r\nwas a land animal: Mr. Seale, moreover, who was a collector of shells\r\nall his life at St. Helena, never met with it alive. Possibly some of\r\nthe smaller species may turn out to be yet living kinds; but, on the\r\nother hand, the two land-shells which are now living on the island in\r\ngreat numbers, do not occur embedded, as far as is yet known, with the\r\nextinct species. I have shown in my “Journal,”[16] that the extinction\r\nof these land-shells possibly may not be an ancient event; as a great\r\nchange took place in the state of the island about one hundred and\r\ntwenty years ago, when the old trees died, and were not replaced by\r\nyoung ones, these being destroyed by the goats and hogs, which had run\r\nwild in numbers, from the year 1502. Mr. Seale states, that on\r\nFlagstaff Hill, where we have seen that the embedded land-shells are\r\nespecially numerous, traces are everywhere discoverable, which plainly\r\nindicate that it was once thickly clothed with trees; at present not\r\neven a bush grows there. The thick bed of black vegetable mould which\r\ncovers the shell-bed, on the flanks of this hill, was probably washed\r\ndown from the upper part, as soon as the trees perished, and the\r\nshelter afforded by them was lost.\r\n\r\n [16] “Journal of Researches,” p. 582.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elevation of the land._—Seeing that the lavas of the basal series,\r\nwhich are of submarine origin, are raised above the level of the sea,\r\nand at some places to the height of many hundred feet, I looked out for\r\nsuperficial signs of the elevation of the land. The bottoms of some of\r\nthe gorges, which descend to the coast, are filled up to the depth of\r\nabout a hundred feet, by rudely divided layers of sand, muddy clay, and\r\nfragmentary masses; in these beds, Mr. Seale has found the bones of the\r\ntropic-bird and of the albatross; the former now rarely, and the latter\r\nnever visiting the island. From the difference between these layers,\r\nand the sloping piles of detritus which rest on them, I suspect that\r\nthey were deposited, when the gorges stood beneath the sea. Mr. Seale,\r\nmoreover, has shown that some of the fissure-like gorges[17] become,\r\nwith a concave outline, gradually rather wider at the bottom than at\r\nthe top; and this peculiar structure was probably caused by the wearing\r\naction of the sea, when it entered the lower part of these gorges. At\r\ngreater heights, the evidence of the rise of the land is even less\r\nclear: nevertheless, in a bay-like depression on the table-land behind\r\nProsperous Bay, at the height of about a thousand feet, there are\r\nflat-topped masses of rock, which it is scarcely conceivable, could\r\nhave been insulated from the surrounding and similar strata, by any\r\nother agency than the denuding action of a sea-beach. Much denudation,\r\nindeed, has been effected at great elevations, which it would not be\r\neasy to explain by any other means: thus, the flat summit of the Barn,\r\nwhich is 2,000 feet high, presents, according to Mr. Seale, a perfect\r\nnetwork of truncated dikes; on hills like the Flagstaff, formed of soft\r\nrock, we might suppose that the dikes had been worn down and cut off by\r\nmeteoric agency, but we can hardly suppose this possible with the hard,\r\nbasaltic strata of the Barn.\r\n\r\n [17] A fissure-like gorge, near Stony-top, is said by Mr. Seale to be\r\n 840 feet deep, and only 115 feet in width.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coast denudation._—The enormous cliffs, in many parts between one and\r\ntwo thousand feet in height, with which this prison-like island is\r\nsurrounded, with the exception of only a few places, where narrow\r\nvalleys descend to the coast, is the most striking feature in its\r\nscenery. We have seen that portions of the basaltic ring, two or three\r\nmiles in length by one or two miles in breadth, and from one to two\r\nthousand feet in height, have been wholly removed. There are, also,\r\nledges and banks of rock, rising out of profoundly deep water, and\r\ndistant from the present coast between three and four miles, which,\r\naccording to Mr. Seale, can be traced to the shore, and are found to be\r\nthe continuations of certain well-known great dikes. The swell of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean has obviously been the active power in forming these\r\ncliffs; and it is interesting to observe that the lesser, though still\r\ngreat, height of the cliffs on the leeward and partially protected side\r\nof the island (extending from the Sugar-Loaf Hill to South West Point),\r\ncorresponds with the lesser degree of exposure. When reflecting on the\r\ncomparatively low coasts of many volcanic islands, which also stand\r\nexposed in the open ocean, and are apparently of considerable\r\nantiquity, the mind recoils from an attempt to grasp the number of\r\ncenturies of exposure, necessary to have ground into mud and to have\r\ndispersed the enormous cubic mass of hard rock which has been pared off\r\nthe circumference of this island. The contrast in the superficial state\r\nof St. Helena, compared with the nearest island, namely, Ascension, is\r\nvery striking. At Ascension, the surfaces of the lava-streams are\r\nglossy, as if just poured forth, their boundaries are well defined, and\r\nthey can often be traced to perfect craters, whence they were erupted;\r\nin the course of many long walks, I did not observe a single dike; and\r\nthe coast round nearly the entire circumference is low, and has been\r\neaten back (though too much stress must not be placed on this fact, as\r\nthe island may have been subsiding) into a little wall only from ten to\r\nthirty feet high. Yet during the 340 years, since Ascension has been\r\nknown, not even the feeblest signs of volcanic action have been\r\nrecorded.[18] On the other hand, at St. Helena, the course of no one\r\nstream of lava can be traced, either by the state of its boundaries or\r\nof its superficies; the mere wreck of one great crater is left; not the\r\nvalleys only, but the surfaces of some of the highest hills, are\r\ninterlaced by worn-down dikes, and, in many\r\nplaces, the denuded summits of great cones of injected rock stand\r\nexposed and naked; lastly, as we have seen, the entire circuit of the\r\nisland has been deeply worn back into the grandest precipices.\r\n\r\n [18] In the _Nautical Magazine_ for 1835, p. 642, and for 1838, p.\r\n 361, and in the “Comptes Rendus,” April 1838, accounts are given of a\r\n series of volcanic phenomena—earthquakes—troubled water—floating\r\n scoriæ and columns of smoke—which have been observed at intervals\r\n since the middle of the last century, in a space of open sea between\r\n longitudes 20° and 22° west, about half a degree south of the equator.\r\n These facts seem to show, that an island or an archipelago is in\r\n process of formation in the middle of the Atlantic: a line joining St.\r\n Helena and Ascension, prolonged, intersects this slowly nascent focus\r\n of volcanic action.\r\n\r\n_Craters of Elevation._\r\n\r\nThere is much resemblance in structure and in geological history\r\nbetween St. Helena, St. Jago, and Mauritius. All three islands are\r\nbounded (at least in the parts which I was able to examine) by a ring\r\nof basaltic mountains, now much broken, but evidently once continuous.\r\nThese mountains have, or apparently once had, their escarpments steep\r\ntowards the interior of the island, and their strata dip outwards. I\r\nwas able to ascertain, only in a few cases, the inclination of the\r\nbeds; nor was this easy, for the stratification was generally obscure,\r\nexcept when viewed from a distance. I feel, however, little doubt that,\r\naccording to the researches of M. Elie de Beaumont, their average\r\ninclination is greater than that which they could have acquired,\r\nconsidering their thickness and compactness, by flowing down a sloping\r\nsurface. At St. Helena, and at St. Jago, the basaltic strata rest on\r\nolder and probably submarine beds of different composition. At all\r\nthree islands, deluges of more recent lavas have flowed from the centre\r\nof the island, towards and between the basaltic mountains; and at St.\r\nHelena the central platform has been filled up by them. All three\r\nislands have been raised in mass. At Mauritius the sea, within a late\r\ngeological period, must have reached to the foot of the basaltic\r\nmountains, as it now does at St. Helena; and at St. Jago it is cutting\r\nback the intermediate plain towards them. In these three islands, but\r\nespecially at St. Jago and at Mauritius, when, standing on the summit\r\nof one of the old basaltic mountains, one looks in vain towards the\r\ncentre of the island,—the point towards which the strata beneath one’s\r\nfeet, and of the mountains on each side, rudely converge,—for a source\r\nwhence these strata could have been erupted; but one sees only a vast\r\nhollow platform stretched beneath, or piles of matter of more recent\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThese basaltic mountains come, I presume, into the class of Craters of\r\nelevation: it is immaterial whether the rings were ever completely\r\nformed, for the portions which now exist have so uniform a structure,\r\nthat, if they do not form fragments of true craters, they cannot be\r\nclassed with ordinary lines of elevation. With respect to their origin,\r\nafter having read the works of Mr. Lyell,[19] and of MM. C. Prevost and\r\nVirlet, I cannot believe that the great central hollows have been\r\nformed by a simple dome-shaped elevation, and the consequent arching of\r\nthe strata. On the other hand, I have very great difficulty in\r\nadmitting that these basaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments\r\nof great volcanoes, of which the summits have either been blown off, or\r\nmore probably swallowed up by subsidence. These rings are, in some\r\ninstances, so immense, as at St. Jago and at Mauritius, and their\r\noccurrence is so frequent, that I can hardly persuade myself to adopt\r\nthis explanation. Moreover, I suspect that the following circumstances,\r\nfrom their frequent concurrence, are someway connected together,—a\r\nconnection not implied in either of the above views: namely, first, the\r\nbroken state of the ring; showing that the now detached portions have\r\nbeen exposed to great denudation, and in some cases, perhaps, rendering\r\nit probable that the ring never was entire; secondly, the great amount\r\nof matter erupted from the central area after or during the formation\r\nof the ring; and thirdly, the elevation of the district in mass. As far\r\nas relates to the inclination of the strata being greater than that\r\nwhich the basal fragments of ordinary volcanoes would naturally\r\npossess, I can readily believe that this inclination might have been\r\nslowly acquired by that amount of elevation, of which, according to M.\r\nElie de Beaumont, the numerous upfilled fissures or dikes are the\r\nevidence and the measure,—a view equally novel and important, which we\r\nowe to the researches of that geologist on Mount Etna.\r\n\r\n [19] “Principles of Geology” (fifth edit.), vol. ii, p. 171.\r\n\r\n\r\nA conjecture, including the above circumstances, occurred to me, when,—\r\nwith my mind fully convinced, from the phenomena of 1835 in South\r\nAmerica,[20] that the forces which eject matter from volcanic orifices\r\nand raise continents in mass are identical,—I viewed that part of the\r\ncoast of St. Jago, where the horizontally upraised, calcareous stratum\r\ndips into the sea, directly beneath a cone of subsequently erupted\r\nlava. The conjecture is that, during the slow elevation of a volcanic\r\ndistrict or island, in the centre of which one or more orifices\r\ncontinue open, and thus relieve the subterranean forces, the borders\r\nare elevated more than the central area; and that the portions thus\r\nupraised do not slope gently into the central, less elevated area, as\r\ndoes the calcareous stratum under the cone at St. Jago, and as does a\r\nlarge part of the circumference of Iceland,[21] but that they are\r\nseparated from it by curved faults.\r\nWe might expect, from what we see along ordinary faults, that the\r\nstrata on the upraised side, already dipping outwards from their\r\noriginal formation as lava-streams, would be tilted from the line of\r\nfault, and thus have their inclination increased. According to this\r\nhypothesis, which I am tempted to extend only to some few cases, it is\r\nnot probable that the ring would ever be formed quite perfect; and from\r\nthe elevation being slow, the upraised portions would generally be\r\nexposed to much denudation, and hence the ring become broken; we might\r\nalso expect to find occasional inequalities in the dip of the upraised\r\nmasses, as is the case at St. Jago. By this hypothesis the elevation of\r\nthe districts in mass, and the flowing of deluges of lava from the\r\ncentral platforms, are likewise connected together. On this view the\r\nmarginal basaltic mountains of the three foregoing islands might still\r\nbe considered as forming “Craters of elevation;” the kind of elevation\r\nimplied having been slow, and the central hollow or platform having\r\nbeen formed, not by the arching of the surface, but simply by that part\r\nhaving been upraised to a less height.\r\n\r\n [20] I have given a detailed account of these phenomena, in a paper\r\n read before the Geological Society in March 1838. At the instant of\r\n time, when an immense area was convulsed and a large tract elevated,\r\n the districts immediately surrounding several of the great vents in\r\n the Cordillera remained quiescent; the subterranean forces being\r\n apparently relieved by the eruptions, which then recommenced with\r\n great violence. An event of somewhat the same kind, but on an\r\n infinitely smaller scale, appears to have taken place, according to\r\n Abich (“Views of Vesuvius,” plates i and ix), within the great crater\r\n of Vesuvius, where a platform on one side of a fissure was raised in\r\n mass twenty feet, whilst on the other side, a train of small volcanoes\r\n burst forth in eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] It appears, from information communicated to me in the most\r\n obliging manner by M. E. Robert, that the circumferential parts of\r\n Iceland, which are composed of ancient basaltic strata alternating\r\n with tuff, dip inland, thus forming a gigantic saucer. M. Robert found\r\n that this was the case, with a few and quite local exceptions, for a\r\n space of coast several hundred miles in length. I find this statement\r\n corroborated, as far as regards one place, by Mackenzie in his\r\n “Travels” (p. 377), and in another place by some MS. notes kindly lent\r\n me by Dr. Holland. The coast is deeply indented by creeks, at the head\r\n of which the land is generally low. M. Robert informs me, that the\r\n inwardly dipping strata appear to extend as far as this line, and that\r\n their inclination usually corresponds with the slope of the surface,\r\n from the high coast-mountains to the low land at the head of these\r\n creeks. In the section described by Sir G. Mackenzie, the dip is 120.\r\n The interior parts of the island chiefly consist, as far as is known,\r\n of recently erupted matter. The great size, however, of Iceland,\r\n equalling the bulkiest part of England, ought perhaps to exclude it\r\n from the class of islands we have been considering; but I cannot avoid\r\n suspecting that if the coast-mountains, instead of gently sloping into\r\n the less elevated central area, had been separated from it by\r\n irregularly curved faults, the strata would have been tilted seaward,\r\n and a “Crater of elevation,” like that of St. Jago or that of\r\n Mauritius, but of much vaster dimensions, would have been formed. I\r\n will only further remark, that the frequent occurrence of extensive\r\n lakes at the foot of large volcanoes, and the frequent association of\r\n volcanic and fresh-water strata, seem to indicate that the areas\r\n around volcanoes are apt to be depressed beneath the level of the\r\n adjoining country, either from having been less elevated, or from the\r\n effects of subsidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V GALAPAGOS ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nChatham Island.—Craters composed of a peculiar kind of tuff.—Small\r\nbasaltic craters, with hollows at their bases.—Albemarle Island, fluid\r\nlavas, their composition.—Craters of tuff, inclination of their\r\nexterior diverging strata, and structure of their interior converging\r\nstrata.—James Island, segment of a small basaltic crater; fluidity and\r\ncomposition of its lava-streams, and of its ejected\r\nfragments.—Concluding remarks on the craters of tuff, and on the\r\nbreached condition of their southern sides.—Mineralogical composition\r\nof the rocks of the archipelago.—Elevation of the land. Direction of\r\nthe fissures of eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis archipelago is situated under the equator, at a distance of\r\nbetween five and six hundred miles from the west coast of South\r\nAmerica. It consists of five principal islands, and of several small\r\nones, which together are equal in area,[1] but not in extent of land,\r\nto Sicily, conjointly with the Ionian Islands. They are all volcanic:\r\non two, craters have been seen in eruption, and on several of the other\r\nislands, streams of lava have a recent appearance. The larger islands\r\nare chiefly composed of solid rock, and they rise with a tame outline\r\nto a height of between one and four thousand feet. They are sometimes,\r\nbut not generally, surmounted by one principal orifice. The craters\r\nvary in size from mere spiracles to huge caldrons several miles in\r\ncircumference; they are extraordinarily numerous, so that I should\r\nthink, if enumerated, they would be found to exceed two thousand; they\r\nare formed either of scoriæ and lava, or of a brown-coloured tuff; and\r\nthese latter craters are in several respects remarkable. The whole\r\ngroup was surveyed by the officers of the _Beagle._ I visited myself\r\nfour of the principal islands, and received specimens from all the\r\nothers. Under the head of the different islands I will describe only\r\nthat which appears to me deserving of attention.\r\n\r\n [1] I exclude from this measurement, the small volcanic islands of\r\n Culpepper and Wenman, lying seventy miles northward of the group.\r\n Craters were visible on all the islands of the group, except on Towers\r\n Island, which is one of the lowest; this island is, however, formed of\r\n volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 11\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galapagos Archipelago.]\r\n\r\nGalapagos Archipelago\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATHAM ISLAND. _Craters composed of a singular kind of tuff._—Towards\r\nthe eastern end of this island there occur two craters composed of two\r\nkinds of tuff; one kind being friable, like slightly consolidated\r\nashes; and the other compact, and of a different nature from anything\r\nwhich I have met with described. This latter substance, where it is\r\nbest characterised, is of a yellowish-brown colour, translucent, and\r\nwith a lustre somewhat resembling resin; it is brittle, with an\r\nangular, rough, and very irregular fracture, sometimes, however, being\r\nslightly granular, and even obscurely crystalline: it can readily be\r\nscratched with a knife, yet some points are hard enough just to mark\r\ncommon glass; it fuses with ease into a blackish-green glass. The mass\r\ncontains numerous broken crystals of olivine and augite, and small\r\nparticles of black and brown scoriæ; it is often traversed by thin\r\nseams of calcareous matter. It generally affects a nodular or\r\nconcretionary structure. In a hand specimen, this substance would\r\ncertainly be mistaken for a pale and peculiar variety of pitchstone;\r\nbut when seen in mass its stratification, and the numerous layers of\r\nfragments of basalt, both angular and rounded, at once render its\r\nsubaqueous origin evident. An examination of a series of specimens\r\nshows that this resin-like substance results from a chemical change on\r\nsmall particles of pale and dark-coloured scoriaceous rocks; and this\r\nchange could be distinctly traced in different stages round the edges\r\nof even the same particle. The position near the coast of all the\r\ncraters composed of this kind of tuff or peperino, and their breached\r\ncondition, renders it probable that they were all formed when standing\r\nimmersed in the sea; considering this circumstance, together with the\r\nremarkable absence of large beds of ashes in the whole archipelago, I\r\nthink it highly probable that much the greater part of the tuff has\r\noriginated from the trituration of fragments of the grey, basaltic\r\nlavas in the mouths of craters standing in the sea. It may be asked\r\nwhether the heated water within these craters has produced this\r\nsingular change in the small scoriaceous particles and given to them\r\ntheir translucent, resin-like fracture. Or has the associated lime\r\nplayed any part in this change? I ask these questions from having found\r\nat St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde Islands, that where a great stream of\r\nmolten lava has flowed over a calcareous bottom into the sea, the\r\noutermost film, which in other parts resembles pitchstone, is changed,\r\napparently by its contact with the carbonate of lime, into a resin-like\r\nsubstance, precisely like the best characterised specimens of the tuff\r\nfrom this archipelago.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] The concretions containing lime, which I have described at\r\n Ascension, as formed in a bed of ashes, present some degree of\r\n resemblance to this substance, but they have not a resinous fracture.\r\n At St. Helena, also, I found veins of a somewhat similar, compact, but\r\n non-resinous substance, occurring in a bed of pumiceous ashes,\r\n apparently free from calcareous matter: in neither of these cases\r\n could heat have acted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the two craters: one of them stands at the distance of a\r\nleague from the coast, the intervening tract consisting of a calcareous\r\ntuff, apparently of submarine origin. This crater consists of a circle\r\nof hills some of which stand quite detached, but all have a very\r\nregular,\r\nquâ-quâ versal dip, at an inclination of between thirty and forty\r\ndegrees. The lower beds, to the thickness of several hundred feet,\r\nconsist of the resin-like stone, with embedded fragments of lava. The\r\nupper beds, which are between thirty and forty feet in thickness, are\r\ncomposed of a thinly stratified, fine-grained, harsh, friable,\r\nbrown-coloured tuff, or peperino.[3] A central mass without any\r\nstratification, which must formerly have occupied the hollow of the\r\ncrater, but is now attached only to a few of the circumferential hills,\r\nconsists of a tuff, intermediate in character between that with a\r\nresin-like, and that with an earthy fracture. This mass contains white\r\ncalcareous matter in small patches. The second crater (520 feet in\r\nheight) must have existed until the eruption of a recent, great stream\r\nof lava, as a separate islet; a fine section, worn by the sea, shows a\r\ngrand funnel-shaped mass of basalt, surrounded by steep, sloping flanks\r\nof tuff, having in parts an earthy, and in others a semi-resinous\r\nfracture. The tuff is traversed by several broad, vertical dikes, with\r\nsmooth and parallel sides, which I did not doubt were formed of basalt,\r\nuntil I actually broke off fragments. These dikes, however, consist of\r\ntuff like that of the surrounding strata, but more compact, and with a\r\nsmoother fracture; hence we must conclude, that fissures were formed\r\nand filled up with the finer mud or tuff from the crater, before its\r\ninterior was occupied, as it now is, by a solidified pool of basalt.\r\nOther fissures have been subsequently formed, parallel to these\r\nsingular dikes, and are merely filled with loose rubbish. The change\r\nfrom ordinary scoriaceous particles to the substance with a\r\nsemi-resinous fracture, could be clearly followed in portions of the\r\ncompact tuff of these dikes.\r\n\r\n [3] Those geologists who restrict the term of “tuff” to ashes of a\r\n white colour, resulting from the attrition of feldspathic lavas, would\r\n call these brown-coloured strata “peperino.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 12\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Kicker Rock.]\r\n\r\nThe Kicker Rock, 400 feet high.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a few miles from these two craters, stands the\r\nKicker Rock, or islet, remarkable from its singular form. It is\r\nunstratified, and is composed of compact tuff, in parts having the\r\nresin-like fracture. It is probable that this amorphous mass, like that\r\nsimilar mass in the case first described, once filled up the central\r\nhollow of a crater, and that its flanks, or sloping walls, have since\r\nbeen worn quite away by the sea, in which it stands exposed.\r\n\r\n_Small basaltic craters._—A bare, undulating tract, at the eastern end\r\nof Chatham Island, is remarkable from the number, proximity, and form\r\nof the small basaltic craters with which it is studded. They consist,\r\neither\r\nof a mere conical pile, or, but less commonly, of a circle, of black\r\nand red, glossy scoriæ, partially cemented together. They vary in\r\ndiameter from thirty to one hundred and fifty yards, and rise from\r\nabout fifty to one hundred feet above the level of the surrounding\r\nplain. From one small eminence, I counted sixty of these craters, all\r\nof which were within a third of a mile from each other, and many were\r\nmuch closer. I measured the distance between two very small craters,\r\nand found that it was only thirty yards from the summit-rim of one to\r\nthe rim of the other. Small streams of black, basaltic lava, containing\r\nolivine and much glassy feldspar, have flowed from many, but not from\r\nall of these craters. The surfaces of the more recent streams were\r\nexceedingly rugged, and were crossed by great fissures; the older\r\nstreams were only a little less rugged; and they were all blended and\r\nmingled together in complete confusion. The different growth, however,\r\nof the trees on the streams, often plainly marked their different ages.\r\nHad it not been for this latter character, the streams could in few\r\ncases have been distinguished; and, consequently, this wide undulatory\r\ntract might have (as probably many tracts have) been erroneously\r\nconsidered as formed by one great deluge of lava, instead of by a\r\nmultitude of small streams, erupted from many small orifices.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of this tract, and especially at the base of the small\r\ncraters, there are circular pits, with perpendicular sides, from twenty\r\nto forty feet deep. At the foot of one small crater, there were three\r\nof these pits. They have probably been formed, by the falling in of the\r\nroofs of small caverns.[4] In other parts, there are mammiform\r\nhillocks, which resemble great bubbles of lava, with their summits\r\nfissured by irregular cracks, which appeared, upon entering them, to be\r\nvery deep; lava has not flowed from these hillocks. There are, also,\r\nother very regular, mammiform hillocks, composed of stratified lava,\r\nand surmounted by circular, steep-sided hollows, which, I suppose have\r\nbeen formed by a body of gas, first, arching the strata into one of the\r\nbubble-like hillocks, and then, blowing off its summit. These several\r\nkinds of hillocks and pits, as well as the numerous, small, scoriaceous\r\ncraters, all show that this tract has been penetrated, almost like a\r\nsieve, by the passage of heated vapours. The more regular hillocks\r\ncould only have been heaved up, whilst the lava was in a softened\r\nstate.[5]\r\n\r\n [4] (M. Elie de Beaumont has described (“Mém. pour servir,” etc., tome\r\n iv, p. 113) many “petits cirques d’eboulement” on Etna, of some of\r\n which the origin is historically known.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] Sir G. Mackenzie (“Travels in Iceland,” pp. 389 to 392) has\r\n described a plain of lava at the foot of Hecla, everywhere heaved up\r\n into great bubbles or blisters. Sir George states that this cavernous\r\n lava composes the uppermost stratum; and the same fact is affirmed by\r\n Von Buch (“Descript. des Isles Canaries,” p. 159), with respect to the\r\n basaltic stream near Rialejo, in Teneriffe. It appears singular that\r\n it should be the upper streams that are chiefly cavernous, for one\r\n sees no reason why the upper and lower should not have been equally\r\n affected at different times;—have the inferior streams flowed beneath\r\n the pressure of the sea, and thus been flattened, after the passage\r\n through them, of bodies of gas?\r\n\r\n\r\nALBEMARLE ISLAND.—This island consists of five, great, flat-topped\r\ncraters, which, together with the one on the adjoining island of\r\nNarborough, singularly resemble each other, in form and height. The\r\nsouthern one is 4,700 feet high, two others are 3,720 feet, a third\r\nonly 50 feet higher, and the remaining ones apparently of nearly the\r\nsame height. Three of these are situated on one line, and their craters\r\nappear elongated in nearly the same direction. The northern crater,\r\nwhich is not the largest, was found by the triangulation to measure,\r\nexternally, no less than three miles and one-eighth of a mile in\r\ndiameter. Over the lips of these great, broad caldrons, and from little\r\norifices near their summits, deluges of black lava have flowed down\r\ntheir naked sides.\r\n\r\n_Fluidity of different lavas._—Near Tagus or Banks’ Cove, I examined\r\none of these great streams of lava, which is remarkable from the\r\nevidence of its former high degree of fluidity, especially when its\r\ncomposition is considered. Near the sea-coast this stream is several\r\nmiles in width. It consists of a black, compact base, easily fusible\r\ninto a black bead, with angular and not very numerous air-cells, and\r\nthickly studded with large, fractured crystals of glassy albite,[6]\r\nvarying from the tenth of an inch to half an inch in diameter. This\r\nlava, although at first sight appearing eminently porphyritic, cannot\r\nproperly be considered so, for the crystals have evidently been\r\nenveloped, rounded, and penetrated by the lava, like fragments of\r\nforeign rock in a trap-dike. This was very clear in some specimens of a\r\nsimilar lava, from Abingdon Island, in which the only difference was,\r\nthat the vesicles were spherical and more numerous. The albite in these\r\nlavas is in a similar condition with the leucite of Vesuvius, and with\r\nthe olivine, described by Von Buch,[7] as projecting in great balls\r\nfrom the basalt of Lanzarote. Besides the albite, this lava contains\r\nscattered grains of a green mineral, with no distinct cleavage, and\r\nclosely resembling olivine;[8] but as it fuses easily into a green\r\nglass, it belongs probably to the augitic family: at James Island,\r\nhowever, a similar lava contained true olivine. I obtained specimens\r\nfrom the actual\r\nsurface, and from a depth of four feet, but they differed in no\r\nrespect. The high degree of fluidity of this lava-stream was at once\r\nevident, from its smooth and gently sloping surface, from the manner in\r\nwhich the main stream was divided by small inequalities into little\r\nrills, and especially from the manner in which its edges, far below its\r\nsource, and where it must have been in some degree cooled, thinned out\r\nto almost nothing; the actual margin consisting of loose fragments, few\r\nof which were larger than a man’s head. The contrast between this\r\nmargin, and the steep walls, above twenty feet high, bounding many of\r\nthe basaltic streams at Ascension, is very remarkable. It has generally\r\nbeen supposed that lavas abounding with large crystals, and including\r\nangular vesicles,[9] have possessed little fluidity; but we see that\r\nthe case has been very different at Albemarle Island. The degree of\r\nfluidity in different lavas, does not seem to correspond with any\r\n_apparent_ corresponding amount of difference in their composition: at\r\nChatham Island, some streams, containing much glassy albite and some\r\nolivine, are so rugged, that they may be compared to a sea frozen\r\nduring a storm; whilst the great stream at Albemarle Island is almost\r\nas smooth as a lake when ruffled by a breeze. At James Island, black\r\nbasaltic lava, abounding with small grains of olivine, presents an\r\nintermediate degree of roughness; its surface being glossy, and the\r\ndetached fragments resembling, in a very singular manner, folds of\r\ndrapery, cables, and pieces of the bark of trees.[10]\r\n\r\n [6] In the Cordillera of Chile, I have seen lava very closely\r\n resembling this variety at the Galapagos Archipelago. It contained,\r\n however, besides the albite, well-formed crystals of augite, and the\r\n base (perhaps in consequence of the aggregation of the augitic\r\n particles) was a shade lighter in colour. I may here remark, that in\r\n all these cases, I call the feldspathic crystals, _albite_, from their\r\n cleavage-planes (as measured by the reflecting goniometer)\r\n corresponding with those of that mineral. As, however, other species\r\n of this genus have lately been discovered to cleave in nearly the same\r\n planes with albite, this determination must be considered as only\r\n provisional. I examined the crystals in the lavas of many different\r\n parts of the Galapagos group, and I found that none of them, with the\r\n exception of some crystals from one part of James Island, cleaved in\r\n the direction of orthite or potash-feldspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] “Description des Isles Canaries,” p. 295.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Humboldt mentions that he mistook a green augitic mineral,\r\n occurring in the volcanic rocks of the Cordillera of Quito, for\r\n olivine.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] The irregular and angular form of the vesicles is probably caused\r\n by the unequal yielding of a mass composed, in almost equal\r\n proportion, of solid crystals and of a viscid base. It certainly seems\r\n a general circumstance, as might have been expected, that in lava,\r\n which has possessed a high degree of fluidity, _as well as an\r\n even-sized grain_, the vesicles are internally smooth and spherical.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] A specimen of basaltic lava, with a few small broken crystals of\r\n albite, given me by one of the officers, is perhaps worthy of\r\n description. It consists of cylindrical ramifications, some of which\r\n are only the twentieth of an inch in diameter, and are drawn out into\r\n the sharpest points. The mass has not been formed like a stalactite,\r\n for the points terminate both upwards and downwards. Globules, only\r\n the fortieth of an inch in diameter, have dropped from some of the\r\n points, and adhere to the adjoining branches. The lava is vesicular,\r\n but the vesicles never reach the surface of the branches, which are\r\n smooth and glossy. As it is generally supposed that vesicles are\r\n always elongated in the direction of the movement of the fluid mass, I\r\n may observe, that in these cylindrical branches, which vary from a\r\n quarter to only the twentieth of an inch in diameter, every air-cell\r\n is spherical.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craters of tuff._—About a mile southward of Banks’ Cove, there is a\r\nfine elliptic crater, about five hundred feet in depth, and\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in diameter. Its bottom is occupied by a lake\r\nof brine, out of which some little crateriform hills of tuff rise. The\r\nlower beds are formed of compact tuff, appearing like a subaqueous\r\ndeposit; whilst the upper beds, round the entire circumference, consist\r\nof a harsh, friable tuff, of little specific gravity, but often\r\ncontaining fragments of rock in layers. This upper tuff contains\r\nnumerous pisolitic balls, about the size of small bullets, which differ\r\nfrom the surrounding matter, only in being slightly\r\nharder and finer grained. The beds dip away very regularly on all\r\nsides, at angles varying, as I found by measurement, from twenty-five\r\nto thirty degrees. The external surface of the crater slopes at a\r\nnearly similar inclination, and is formed by slightly convex ribs, like\r\nthose on the shell of a pecten or scallop, which become broader as they\r\nextend from the mouth of the crater to its base. These ribs are\r\ngenerally from eight to twenty feet in breadth, but sometimes they are\r\nas much as forty feet broad; and they resemble old, plastered, much\r\nflattened vaults, with the plaster scaling off in plates: they are\r\nseparated from each other by gullies, deepened by alluvial action. At\r\ntheir upper and narrow ends, near the mouth of the crater, these ribs\r\noften consist of real hollow passages, like, but rather smaller than,\r\nthose often formed by the cooling of the crust of a lava-stream, whilst\r\nthe inner parts have flowed onward;—of which structure I saw many\r\nexamples at Chatham Island. There can be no doubt but that these hollow\r\nribs or vaults have been formed in a similar manner, namely, by the\r\nsetting or hardening of a superficial crust on streams of mud, which\r\nhave flowed down from the upper part of the crater. In another part of\r\nthis same crater, I saw open concave gutters between one and two feet\r\nwide, which appear to have been formed by the hardening of the lower\r\nsurface of a mud stream, instead of, as in the former case, of the\r\nupper surface. From these facts I think it is certain that the tuff\r\nmust have flowed as mud.[11] This mud may have been formed either\r\nwithin the crater, or from ashes deposited on its upper parts, and\r\nafterwards washed down by torrents of rain. The former method, in most\r\nof the cases, appears the more probable one; at James Island, however,\r\nsome beds of the friable kind of tuff extend so continuously over an\r\nuneven surface, that probably they were formed by the falling of\r\nshowers of ashes.\r\n\r\n [11] This conclusion is of some interest, because M. Dufrenoy (“Mém.\r\n pour servir,” tome iv, p. 274) has argued from strata of tuff,\r\n apparently of similar composition with that here described, being\r\n inclined at angles between 18° and 20°, that Monte Nuevo and some\r\n other craters of Southern Italy have been formed by upheaval. From the\r\n facts given above, of the vaulted character of the separate rills, and\r\n from the tuff not extending in horizontal sheets round these\r\n crateriform hills, no one will suppose that the strata have here been\r\n produced by elevation; and yet we see that their inclination is above\r\n 20°, and often as much as 30°. The consolidated strata also, of the\r\n internal talus, as will be immediately seen, dips at an angle of above\r\n 30°.\r\n\r\nWithin this same crater, strata of coarse tuff, chiefly composed of\r\nfragments of lava, abut, like a consolidated talus, against the inside\r\nwalls. They rise to a height of between one hundred and one hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the surface of the internal brine-lake; they dip\r\ninwards, and are inclined at an angle varying from thirty to thirty-six\r\ndegrees. They appear to have been formed beneath water, probably at a\r\nperiod when the sea occupied the hollow of the crater. I was surprised\r\nto observe that beds having this great inclination did not, as far as\r\nthey could be followed, thicken towards their lower extremities.\r\n\r\n_Banks’ Cove._—This harbour occupies part of the interior of a\r\nshattered crater of tuff larger than that last described. All the tuff\r\nis\r\ncompact, and includes numerous fragments of lava; it appears like a\r\nsubaqueous deposit. The most remarkable feature in this crater is the\r\ngreat development of strata converging inwards, as in the last case, at\r\na considerable inclination, and often deposited in irregular curved\r\nlayers. These interior converging beds, as well as the proper,\r\ndiverging crateriform strata, are represented in figure No. 13, a rude,\r\nsectional sketch of the headlands, forming this Cove. The internal and\r\nexternal strata differ little in composition, and the former have\r\nevidently resulted from the wear and tear, and redeposition of the\r\nmatter forming the external crateriform strata. From the great\r\ndevelopment of these inner beds, a person walking round the rim of this\r\ncrater might fancy himself on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified\r\nsandstone and conglomerate. The sea is wearing away the inner and outer\r\nstrata, and especially the latter; so that the inwardly converging\r\nstrata will, perhaps, in some future age, be left standing alone—a case\r\nwhich might at first perplex a geologist.[12]\r\n\r\n [12] I believe that this case actually occurs in the Azores, where Dr.\r\n Webster (“Description,” p. 185) has described a basin-formed, little\r\n island, composed of _strata of tuff_, dipping inwards and bounded\r\n externally by steep sea-worn cliffs. Dr. Daubeny supposes (on\r\n Volcanoes, p. 266), that this cavity must have been formed by a\r\n circular subsidence. It appears to me far more probable, that we here\r\n have strata which were originally deposited within the hollow of a\r\n crater, of which the exterior walls have since been removed by the\r\n sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 13\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sectional sketch of headlands forming Banks’ Cove.]\r\n\r\nA sectional sketch of the headlands forming Banks’ Cove, showing the\r\ndiverging craterform strata, and the converging stratified talus. The\r\nhighest point of these hills is 817 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nJAMES ISLAND.—Two craters of tuff on this island are the only remaining\r\nones which require any notice. One of them lies a mile and a half\r\ninland from Puerto Grande: it is circular, about the third of a mile in\r\ndiameter, and 400 feet in depth. It differs from all the other\r\ntuff-craters which I examined, in having the lower part of its cavity,\r\nto the height of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet,\r\nformed by a precipitous wall of basalt, giving to the crater the\r\nappearance of having burst through a solid sheet of rock. The upper\r\npart of this crater consists of strata of the altered tuff, with a\r\nsemi-resinous fracture. Its bottom is\r\noccupied by a shallow lake of brine, covering layers of salt, which\r\nrest on deep black mud. The other crater lies at the distance of a few\r\nmiles, and is only remarkable from its size and perfect condition. Its\r\nsummit is 1,200 feet above the level of the sea, and the interior\r\nhollow is 600 feet deep. Its external sloping surface presented a\r\ncurious appearance from the smoothness of the wide layers of tuff,\r\nwhich resembled a vast plastered floor. Brattle Island is, I believe,\r\nthe largest crater in the Archipelago composed of tuff; its interior\r\ndiameter is nearly a nautical mile. At present it is in a ruined\r\ncondition, consisting of little more than half a circle open to the\r\nsouth; its great size is probably due, in part, to internal\r\ndegradation, from the action of the sea.\r\n\r\nNo. 14\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Segment of very small orifice of eruption.]\r\n\r\nSegment of a very small orifice of eruption, on the beach of\r\nFresh-water Bay.\r\n\r\n_Segment of a basaltic crater._—One side of Fresh-water Bay, in James\r\nIsland, is bounded by a promontory, which forms the last wreck of a\r\ngreat crater. On the beach of this promontory, a quadrant-shaped\r\nsegment of a small subordinate point of eruption stands exposed. It\r\nconsists of nine separate little streams of lava piled upon each other;\r\nand of an irregular pinnacle, about fifteen feet high, of\r\nreddish-brown, vesicular basalt, abounding with large crystals of\r\nglassy albite, and with fused augite. This pinnacle, and some adjoining\r\npaps of rock on the beach, represent the axis of the crater. The\r\nstreams of lava can be followed up a little ravine, at right angles to\r\nthe coast, for between ten and fifteen yards, where they are hidden by\r\ndetritus: along the beach they are visible for nearly eighty yards, and\r\nI do not believe that they extend much further. The three lower streams\r\nare united to the pinnacle; and at the point of junction (as shown in\r\nfigure No. 14, a rude sketch made on the spot), they are slightly\r\narched, as if in the act of flowing over the lip of the crater. The six\r\nupper streams no doubt were originally united to this same column\r\nbefore it was worn down by the sea. The lava of these streams is of\r\nsimilar composition with that of the pinnacle, excepting that the\r\ncrystals of albite appear to be more comminuted, and the grains of\r\nfused augite are absent. Each stream is separated from the one above it\r\nby a few inches, or at most by one or two feet in thickness, of loose\r\nfragmentary scoriæ,\r\napparently derived from the abrasion of the streams in passing over\r\neach other. All these streams are very remarkable from their thinness.\r\nI carefully measured several of them; one was eight inches thick, but\r\nwas firmly coated with three inches above, and three inches below, of\r\nred scoriaceous rock (which is the case with all the streams), making\r\naltogether a thickness of fourteen inches: this thickness was preserved\r\nquite uniformly along the entire length of the section. A second stream\r\nwas only eight inches thick, including both the upper and lower\r\nscoriaceous surfaces. Until examining this section, I had not thought\r\nit possible that lava could have flowed in such uniformly thin sheets\r\nover a surface far from smooth. These little streams closely resemble\r\nin composition that great deluge of lava at Albemarle Island, which\r\nlikewise must have possessed a high degree of fluidity.\r\n\r\n_Pseudo-extraneous, ejected fragments._—In the lava and in the scoriæ\r\nof this little crater, I found several fragments, which, from their\r\nangular form, their granular structure, their freedom from air-cells,\r\ntheir brittle and burnt condition, closely resembled those fragments of\r\nprimary rocks which are occasionally ejected, as at Ascension, from\r\nvolcanoes. These fragments consist of glassy albite, much mackled, and\r\nwith very imperfect cleavages, mingled with semi-rounded grains, having\r\ntarnished, glossy surfaces, of a steel-blue mineral. The crystals of\r\nalbite are coated by a red oxide of iron, appearing like a residual\r\nsubstance; and their cleavage-planes also are sometimes separated by\r\nexcessively fine layers of this oxide, giving to the crystals the\r\nappearance of being ruled like a glass micrometer. There was no quartz.\r\nThe steel-blue mineral, which is abundant in the pinnacle, but which\r\ndisappears in the streams derived from the pinnacle, has a fused\r\nappearance, and rarely presents even a trace of cleavage; I obtained,\r\nhowever, one measurement, which proved that it was augite; and in one\r\nother fragment, which differed from the others, in being slightly\r\ncellular, and in gradually blending into the surrounding matrix the\r\nsmall grains of this mineral were tolerably well crystallised. Although\r\nthere is so wide a difference in appearance between the lava of the\r\nlittle streams, and especially of their red scoriaceous crusts, and one\r\nof these angular ejected fragments, which at first sight might readily\r\nbe mistaken for syenite, yet I believe that the lava has originated\r\nfrom the melting and movement of a mass of rock of absolutely similar\r\ncomposition with the fragments. Besides the specimen above alluded to,\r\nin which we see a fragment becoming slightly cellular, and blending\r\ninto the surrounding matrix, some of the grains of the steel-blue\r\naugite also have their surfaces becoming very finely vesicular, and\r\npassing into the nature of the surrounding paste; other grains are\r\nthroughout, in an intermediate condition. The paste seems to consist of\r\nthe augite more perfectly fused, or, more probably, merely disturbed in\r\nits softened state by the movement of the mass, and mingled with the\r\noxide of iron and with finely comminuted, glassy albite. Hence probably\r\nit is that the fused albite, which is abundant in the pinnacle,\r\ndisappears in the streams. The albite is in exactly the same state,\r\nwith the exception of most of the crystals being smaller in the lava\r\nand in the embedded fragments; but\r\nin the fragments they appear to be less abundant: this, however, would\r\nnaturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base, and its\r\nconsequent apparent increase in bulk. It is interesting thus to trace\r\nthe steps by which a compact granular rock becomes converted into a\r\nvesicular, pseudo-porphyritic lava, and finally into red scoriæ. The\r\nstructure and composition of the embedded fragments show that they are\r\nparts either of a mass of primary rock which has undergone considerable\r\nchange from volcanic action, or more probably of the crust of a body of\r\ncooled and crystallised lava, which has afterwards been broken up and\r\nre-liquified; the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on the tuff-craters._—These craters, from the\r\npeculiarity of the resin-like substance which enters largely into their\r\ncomposition, from their structure, their size and number, present the\r\nmost striking feature in the geology of this Archipelago. The majority\r\nof them form either separate islets, or promontories attached to the\r\nlarger islands; and those which now stand at some little distance from\r\nthe coast are worn and breached, as if by the action of the sea. From\r\nthis general circumstance of their position, and from the small\r\nquantity of ejected ashes in any part of the Archipelago, I am led to\r\nconclude, that the tuff has been chiefly produced, by the grinding\r\ntogether of fragments of lava within active craters, communicating with\r\nthe sea. In the origin and composition of the tuff, and in the frequent\r\npresence of a central lake of brine and of layers of salt, these\r\ncraters resemble, though on a gigantic scale, the “salses,” or hillocks\r\nof mud, which are common in some parts of Italy and in other\r\ncountries.[13] Their closer connection, however, in this Archipelago,\r\nwith ordinary volcanic action, is shown by the pools of solidified\r\nbasalt, with which they are sometimes filled up.\r\n\r\n [13] D’Aubuisson’s “Traité de Géognosie,” tome i, p. 189. I may\r\n remark, that I saw at Terceira, in the Azores, a crater of tuff or\r\n peperino, very similar to these of the Galapagos Archipelago. From the\r\n description given in Freycinet “Voyage,” similar ones occur at the\r\n Sandwich Islands; and probably they are present in many other places.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt at first appears very singular, that all the craters formed of tuff\r\nhave their southern sides, either quite broken down and wholly removed,\r\nor much lower than the other sides. I saw and received accounts of\r\ntwenty-eight of these craters; of these, twelve form separate\r\nislets,[14] and now exist as mere crescents quite open to the south,\r\nwith occasionally a few points of rock marking their former\r\ncircumference: of the remaining sixteen, some form promontories, and\r\nothers stand at a little distance inland from the shore; but all have\r\ntheir southern sides either the lowest, or quite broken down. Two,\r\nhowever, of the sixteen had\r\ntheir northern sides also low, whilst their eastern and western sides\r\nwere perfect. I did not see, or hear of, a single exception to the\r\nrule, of these craters being broken down or low on the side, which\r\nfaces a point of the horizon between S.E. and S.W. This rule does not\r\napply to craters composed of lava and scoriæ. The explanation is\r\nsimple: at this Archipelago, the waves from the trade-wind, and the\r\nswell propagated from the distant parts of the open ocean, coincide in\r\ndirection (which is not the case in many parts of the Pacific), and\r\nwith their united forces attack the southern sides of all the islands;\r\nand consequently the southern slope, even when entirely formed of hard\r\nbasaltic rock, is invariably steeper than the northern slope. As the\r\ntuff-craters are composed of a soft material, and as probably all, or\r\nnearly all, have at some period stood immersed in the sea, we need not\r\nwonder that they should invariably exhibit on their exposed sides the\r\neffects of this great denuding power. Judging from the worn condition\r\nof many of these craters, it is probable that some have been entirely\r\nwashed away. As there is no reason to suppose, that the craters formed\r\nof scoriæ and lava were erupted whilst standing in the sea, we can see\r\nwhy the rule does not apply to them. At Ascension, it was shown that\r\nthe mouths of the craters, which are there all of terrestrial origin,\r\nhave been affected by the trade-wind; and this same power might here,\r\nalso, aid in making the windward and exposed sides of some of the\r\ncraters originally the lowest.\r\n\r\n [14] These consist of the three Crossman Islets, the largest of which\r\n is 600 feet in height; Enchanted Island; Gardner Island (760 feet\r\n high); Champion Island (331 feet high); Enderby Island; Brattle\r\n Island; two islets near Indefatigable Island; and one near James\r\n Island. A second crater near James Island (with a salt lake in its\r\n centre) has its southern side only about twenty feet high, whilst the\r\n other parts of the circumference are about three hundred feet in\r\n height.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mineralogical composition of the rocks._—In the northern islands, the\r\nbasaltic lavas seem generally to contain more albite than they do in\r\nthe southern half of the Archipelago; but almost all the streams\r\ncontain some. The albite is not unfrequently associated with olivine. I\r\ndid not observe in any specimen distinguishable crystals of hornblende\r\nor augite; I except the fused grains in the ejected fragments, and in\r\nthe pinnacle of the little crater, above described. I did not meet with\r\na single specimen of true trachyte; though some of the paler lavas,\r\nwhen abounding with large crystals of the harsh and glassy albite,\r\nresemble in some degree this rock; but in every case the basis fuses\r\ninto a black enamel. Beds of ashes and far-ejected scoriæ, as\r\npreviously stated, are almost absent; nor did I see a fragment of\r\nobsidian or of pumice. Von Buch[15] believes that the absence of pumice\r\non Mount Etna is consequent on the feldspar being of the Labrador\r\nvariety; if the presence of pumice depends on the constitution of the\r\nfeldspar, it is remarkable, that it should be absent in this\r\narchipelago, and abundant in the Cordillera of South America, in both\r\nof which regions the feldspar is of the albitic variety. Owing to the\r\nabsence of ashes, and the general indecomposable character of the lava\r\nin this Archipelago, the islands are slowly clothed with a poor\r\nvegetation, and the scenery has a desolate and frightful aspect.\r\n\r\n [15] “Description des Isles Canaries,” p. 328.\r\n\r\n_Elevation of the land._—Proofs of the rising of the land are scanty\r\nand imperfect. At Chatham Island, I noticed some great blocks of lava,\r\ncemented by calcareous matter, containing recent shells; but they\r\noccurred at the height of only a few feet above high-water mark. One\r\nof the officers gave me some fragments of shells, which he found\r\nembedded several hundred feet above the sea, in the tuff of two\r\ncraters, distant from each other. It is possible, that these fragments\r\nmay have been carried up to their present height in an eruption of mud;\r\nbut as, in one instance, they were associated with broken\r\noyster-shells, almost forming a layer, it is more probable that the\r\ntuff was uplifted with the shells in mass. The specimens are so\r\nimperfect that they can be recognised only as belonging to recent\r\nmarine genera. On Charles Island, I observed a line of great rounded\r\nblocks, piled on the summit of a vertical cliff, at the height of\r\nfifteen feet above the line, where the sea now acts during the heaviest\r\ngales. This appeared, at first, good evidence in favour of the\r\nelevation of the land; but it was quite deceptive, for I afterwards saw\r\non an adjoining part of this same coast, and heard from eye-witnesses,\r\nthat wherever a recent stream of lava forms a smooth inclined plane,\r\nentering the sea, the waves during gales have the power of _rolling up\r\nrounded_ blocks to a great height, above the line of their ordinary\r\naction. As the little cliff in the foregoing case is formed by a stream\r\nof lava, which, before being worn back, must have entered the sea with\r\na gently sloping surface, it is possible or rather it is probable, that\r\nthe rounded boulders, now lying on its summit, are merely the remnants\r\nof those which had been _rolled up_ during storms to their present\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n_Direction of the fissures of eruption._—The volcanic orifices in this\r\ngroup cannot be considered as indiscriminately scattered. Three great\r\ncraters on Albermarle Island form a well-marked line, extending N.W. by\r\nN. and S.E. by S. Narborough Island, and the great crater on the\r\nrectangular projection of Albemarle Island, form a second parallel\r\nline. To the east, Hood’s Island, and the islands and rocks between it\r\nand James Island, form another nearly parallel line, which, when\r\nprolonged, includes Culpepper and Wenman Islands, lying seventy miles\r\nto the north. The other islands lying further eastward, form a less\r\nregular fourth line. Several of these islands, and the vents on\r\nAlbemarle Island, are so placed, that they likewise fall on a set of\r\nrudely parallel lines, intersecting the former lines at right angles;\r\nso that the principal craters appear to lie on the points where two\r\nsets of fissures cross each other. The islands themselves, with the\r\nexception of Albemarle Island, are not elongated in the same direction\r\nwith the lines on which they stand. The direction of these islands is\r\nnearly the same with that which prevails in so remarkable a manner in\r\nthe numerous archipelagoes of the great Pacific Ocean. Finally, I may\r\nremark, that amongst the Galapagos Islands there is no one dominant\r\nvent much higher than all the others, as may be observed in many\r\nvolcanic archipelagoes: the highest is the great mound on the\r\nsouth-western extremity of Albemarle Island, which exceeds by barely a\r\nthousand feet several other neighbouring craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI TRACHYTE AND BASALT.—DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANIC ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sinking of crystals in fluid lava.—Specific gravity of the\r\nconstituent parts of trachyte and of basalt, and their consequent\r\nseparation.—Obsidian.—Apparent non-separation of the elements of\r\nplutonic rocks.—Origin of trap-dikes in the plutonic\r\nseries.—Distribution of volcanic islands; their prevalence in the great\r\noceans.—They are generally arranged in lines.—The central volcanoes of\r\nVon Buch doubtful.—Volcanic islands bordering continents.—Antiquity of\r\nvolcanic islands, and their elevation in mass.—Eruptions on parallel\r\nlines of fissure within the same geological period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the separation of the constituent minerals of lava, according to\r\ntheir specific gravities._—One side of Fresh-water Bay, in James\r\nIsland, is formed by the wreck of a large crater, mentioned in the last\r\nchapter, of which the interior has been filled up by a pool of basalt,\r\nabout two hundred feet in thickness. This basalt is of a grey colour,\r\nand contains many crystals of glassy albite, which become much more\r\nnumerous in the lower, scoriaceous part. This is contrary to what might\r\nhave been expected, for if the crystals had been originally\r\ndisseminated in equal numbers, the greater intumescence of this lower\r\nscoriaceous part would have made them appear fewer in number. Von\r\nBuch[1] has described a stream of obsidian on the Peak of Teneriffe, in\r\nwhich the crystals of feldspar become more and more numerous, as the\r\ndepth or thickness increases, so that near the lower surface of the\r\nstream the lava even resembles a primary rock. Von Buch further states,\r\nthat M. Dree, in his experiments in melting lava, found that the\r\ncrystals of feldspar always tended to precipitate themselves to the\r\nbottom of the crucible. In these cases, I presume there can be no\r\ndoubt[2] that the crystals sink from their weight. The specific gravity\r\nof feldspar varies[3] from 2·4 to 2·58, whilst obsidian seems commonly\r\nto be from 2·3 to 2·4; and in a fluidified state its specific gravity\r\nwould probably be less, which would\r\nfacilitate the sinking of the crystals of feldspar. At James Island,\r\nthe crystals of albite, though no doubt of less weight than the grey\r\nbasalt, in the parts where compact, might easily be of greater specific\r\ngravity than the scoriaceous mass, formed of melted lava and bubbles of\r\nheated gas.\r\n\r\n [1] “Description des Isles Canaries,” pp. 190 and 191.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] In a mass of molten iron, it is found (_Edinburgh New\r\n Philosophical Journal_, vol. xxiv, p. 66) that the substances, which\r\n have a closer affinity for oxygen than iron has, rise from the\r\n interior of the mass to the surface. But a similar cause can hardly\r\n apply to the separation of the crystals of these lava-streams. The\r\n cooling of the surface of lava seems, in some cases, to have affected\r\n its composition; for Dufrenoy (“Mém. pour servir,” tome iv, p. 271)\r\n found that the interior parts of a stream near Naples contained\r\n two-thirds of a mineral which was acted on by acids, whilst the\r\n surface consisted chiefly of a mineral unattackable by acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I have taken the specific gravities of the simple minerals from\r\n Von Kobell, one of the latest and best authorities, and of the rocks\r\n from various authorities. Obsidian, according to Phillips, is 2·35;\r\n and Jameson says it never exceeds 2·4; but a specimen from Ascension,\r\n weighed by myself, was 2·42.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sinking of crystals through a viscid substance like molten rock, as\r\nis unequivocally shown to have been the case in the experiments of M.\r\nDrée, is worthy of further consideration, as throwing light on the\r\nseparation of the trachytic and basaltic series of lavas. Mr. P. Scrope\r\nhas speculated on this subject; but he does not seem to have been aware\r\nof any positive facts, such as those above given; and he has overlooked\r\none very necessary element, as it appears to me, in the\r\nphenomenon—namely, the existence of either the lighter or heavier\r\nmineral in globules or in crystals. In a substance of imperfect\r\nfluidity, like molten rock, it is hardly credible, that the separate,\r\ninfinitely small atoms, whether of feldspar, augite, or of any other\r\nmineral, would have power from their slightly different gravities to\r\novercome the friction caused by their movement; but if the atoms of any\r\none of these minerals became, whilst the others remained fluid, united\r\ninto crystals or granules, it is easy to perceive that from the\r\nlessened friction, their sinking or floating power would be greatly\r\nincreased. On the other hand, if all the minerals became granulated at\r\nthe same time, it is scarcely possible, from their mutual resistance,\r\nthat any separation could take place. A valuable, practical discovery,\r\nillustrating the effect of the granulation of one element in a fluid\r\nmass, in aiding its separation, has lately been made: when lead\r\ncontaining a small proportion of silver, is constantly stirred whilst\r\ncooling, it becomes granulated, and the grains of imperfect crystals of\r\nnearly pure lead sink to the bottom, leaving a residue of melted metal\r\nmuch richer in silver; whereas if the mixture be left undisturbed,\r\nalthough kept fluid for a length of time, the two metals show no signs\r\nof separating.[4] The sole use of the stirring seems to be, the\r\nformation of detached granules. The specific gravity of silver is 10·4,\r\nand of lead 11·35: the granulated lead, which sinks, is never\r\nabsolutely pure, and the residual fluid metal contains, when richest,\r\nonly 1/119 part of silver. As the difference in specific gravity,\r\ncaused by the different proportions of the two metals, is so\r\nexceedingly small, the separation is probably aided in a great degree\r\nby the difference in gravity between the lead, when granular though\r\nstill hot, and when fluid.\r\n\r\n [4] A full and interesting account of this discovery, by Mr.\r\n Pattinson, was read before the British Association in September 1838.\r\n In some alloys, according to Turner (“Chemistry,” p. 210), the\r\n heaviest metal sinks, and it appears that this takes place whilst both\r\n metals are fluid. Where there is a considerable difference in gravity,\r\n as between iron and the slag formed during the fusion of the ore, we\r\n need not be surprised at the atoms separating, without either\r\n substance being granulated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a body of liquified volcanic rock, left for some time without any\r\nviolent disturbance, we might expect, in accordance with the above\r\nfacts, that if one of the constituent minerals became aggregated into\r\ncrystals or granules, or had been enveloped in this state from some\r\npreviously existing mass, such crystals or granules would rise or sink,\r\naccording to their specific gravity. Now we have plain evidence of\r\ncrystals being embedded in many lavas, whilst the paste or basis has\r\ncontinued fluid. I need only refer, as instances, to the several,\r\ngreat, pseudo-porphyritic streams at the Galapagos Islands, and to the\r\ntrachytic streams in many parts of the world, in which we find crystals\r\nof feldspar bent and broken by the movement of the surrounding,\r\nsemi-fluid matter. Lavas are chiefly composed of three varieties of\r\nfeldspar, varying in specific gravity from 2·4 to 2·74; of hornblende\r\nand augite, varying from 3·0 to 3·4; of olivine, varying from 3·3 to\r\n3·4; and lastly, of oxides of iron, with specific gravities from 4·8 to\r\n5·2. Hence crystals of feldspar, enveloped in a mass of liquified, but\r\nnot highly vesicular lava, would tend to rise to the upper parts; and\r\ncrystals or granules of the other minerals, thus enveloped, would tend\r\nto sink. We ought not, however, to expect any perfect degree of\r\nseparation in such viscid materials. Trachyte, which consists chiefly\r\nof feldspar, with some hornblende and oxide of iron, has a specific\r\ngravity of about 2·45;[5] whilst basalt, composed chiefly of augite and\r\nfeldspar, often with much iron and olivine, has a gravity of about 3·0.\r\nAccordingly we find, that where both trachytic and basaltic streams\r\nhave proceeded from the same orifice, the trachytic streams have\r\ngenerally been first erupted owing, as we must suppose, to the molten\r\nlava of this series having accumulated in the upper parts of the\r\nvolcanic focus. This order of eruption has been observed by Beudant,\r\nScrope, and by other authors; three instances, also, have been given in\r\nthis volume. As the later eruptions, however, from most volcanic\r\nmountains, burst through their basal parts, owing to the increased\r\nheight and weight of the internal column of molten rock, we see why, in\r\nmost cases, only the lower flanks of the central, trachytic masses, are\r\nenveloped by basaltic streams. The separation of the ingredients of a\r\nmass of lava, would, perhaps, sometimes take place within the body of a\r\nvolcanic mountain, if lofty and of great dimensions, instead of within\r\nthe underground focus; in which case, trachytic streams might be poured\r\nforth, almost contemporaneously, or at short recurrent intervals, from\r\nits summit, and basaltic streams from its base: this seems to have\r\ntaken place at Teneriffe.[6] I need only further remark, that from\r\nviolent disturbances the separation of the two series, even under\r\notherwise favourable conditions, would naturally often be prevented,\r\nand likewise their usual order of eruption be inverted. From the high\r\ndegree of fluidity of most basaltic lavas, these perhaps, alone, would\r\nin many cases reach the surface.\r\n\r\n [5] Trachyte from Java was found by Von Buch to be 2·47; from\r\n Auvergne, by De la Beche, it was 2·42; from Ascension, by myself, it\r\n was 2·42. Jameson and other authors give to basalt a specific gravity\r\n of 3·0; but specimens from Auvergne were found, by De la Beche, to be\r\n only 2·78; and from the Giant’s Causeway, to be 2·91.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Consult Von Buch’s well-known and admirable “Description Physique”\r\n of this island, which might serve as a model of descriptive geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen that crystals of feldspar, in the instance described by\r\nVon Buch, sink in obsidian, in accordance with their known greater\r\nspecific gravity, we might expect to find in every trachytic district,\r\nwhere obsidian has flowed as lava, that it had proceeded from the upper\r\nor highest orifices. This, according to Von Buch, holds good in a\r\nremarkable manner both at the Lipari Islands and on the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe; at this latter place obsidian has never flowed from a less\r\nheight than 9,200 feet. Obsidian, also, appears to have been erupted\r\nfrom the loftiest peaks of the Peruvian Cordillera. I will only further\r\nobserve, that the specific gravity of quartz varies from 2·6 to 2·8;\r\nand therefore, that when present in a volcanic focus, it would not tend\r\nto sink with the basaltic bases; and this, perhaps, explains the\r\nfrequent presence, and the abundance of this mineral, in the lavas of\r\nthe trachytic series, as observed in previous parts of this volume.\r\n\r\nAn objection to the foregoing theory will, perhaps, be drawn from the\r\nplutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently distinct series,\r\nof different specific gravities; although, like the volcanic, they have\r\nbeen liquified. In answer, it may first be remarked, that we have no\r\nevidence of the atoms of any one of the constituent minerals in the\r\nplutonic series having been aggregated, whilst the others remained\r\nfluid, which we have endeavoured to show is an almost necessary\r\ncondition of their separation; on the contrary, the crystals have\r\ngenerally impressed each other with their forms.[7]\r\n\r\n [7] The crystalline paste of phonolite is frequently penetrated by\r\n long needles of hornblende; from which it appears that the hornblende,\r\n though the more fusible mineral, has crystallised before, or at the\r\n same time with a more refractory substance. Phonolite, as far as my\r\n observations serve, in every instance appears to be an injected rock,\r\n like those of the plutonic series; hence probably, like these latter,\r\n it has generally been cooled without repeated and violent\r\n disturbances. Those geologists who have doubted whether granite could\r\n have been formed by igneous liquefaction, because minerals of\r\n different degrees of fusibility impress each other with their forms,\r\n could not have been aware of the fact of crystallised hornblende\r\n penetrating phonolite, a rock undoubtedly of igneous origin. The\r\n viscidity, which it is now known, that both feldspar and quartz retain\r\n at a temperature much below their points of fusion, easily explains\r\n their mutual impressment. Consult on this subject Mr. Horner’s paper\r\n on Bonn, “Geolog. Transact.,” vol. iv, p. 439; and “L’Institut,” with\r\n respect to quartz, 1839, p. 161.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the perfect tranquillity, under which it is\r\nprobable that the plutonic masses, buried at profound depths, have\r\ncooled, would, most likely, be highly unfavourable to the separation of\r\ntheir constituent minerals; for, if the attractive force, which during\r\nthe progressive cooling draws together the molecules of the different\r\nminerals, has power sufficient to keep them together, the friction\r\nbetween such half-formed crystals or pasty globules would effectually\r\nprevent the heavier ones from sinking, or the lighter ones from rising.\r\nOn the other hand, a small amount of disturbance, which would probably\r\noccur in most volcanic foci, and which we have seen does not prevent\r\nthe separation of granules of lead from a mixture of molten lead and\r\nsilver, or crystals of feldspar from streams of lava, by breaking\r\nand dissolving the less perfectly formed globules, would permit the\r\nmore perfect and therefore unbroken crystals, to sink or rise,\r\naccording to their specific gravity.\r\n\r\nAlthough in plutonic rocks two distinct species, corresponding to the\r\ntrachytic and basaltic series, do not exist, I much suspect that a\r\ncertain amount of separation of their constituent parts has often taken\r\nplace. I suspect this from having observed how frequently dikes of\r\ngreenstone and basalt intersect widely extended formations of granite\r\nand the allied metamorphic rocks. I have never examined a district in\r\nan extensive granitic region without discovering dikes; I may instance\r\nthe numerous trap-dikes, in several districts of Brazil, Chile, and\r\nAustralia, and at the Cape of Good Hope: many dikes likewise occur in\r\nthe great granitic tracts of India, in the north of Europe, and in\r\nother countries. Whence, then, has the greenstone and basalt, forming\r\nthese dikes, come? Are we to suppose, like some of the elder\r\ngeologists, that a zone of trap is uniformly spread out beneath the\r\ngranitic series, which composes, as far as we know, the foundations of\r\nthe earth’s crust? Is it not more probable, that these dikes have been\r\nformed by fissures penetrating into partially cooled rocks of the\r\ngranitic and metamorphic series, and by their more fluid parts,\r\nconsisting chiefly of hornblende, oozing out, and being sucked into\r\nsuch fissures? At Bahia, in Brazil, in a district composed of gneiss\r\nand primitive greenstone, I saw many dikes, of a dark augitic (for one\r\ncrystal certainly was of this mineral) or hornblendic rock, which, as\r\nseveral appearances clearly proved, either had been formed before the\r\nsurrounding mass had become solid, or had together with it been\r\nafterwards thoroughly softened.[8] On both sides of one of these dikes,\r\nthe gneiss was penetrated, to the distance of several yards, by\r\nnumerous, curvilinear threads or streaks of dark matter, which\r\nresembled in form clouds of the class called cirrhi-comæ; some few of\r\nthese threads could be traced to their junction with the dike. When\r\nexamining them, I doubted whether such hair-like and curvilinear veins\r\ncould have been injected, and I now suspect, that instead of having\r\nbeen injected from the dike, they were its feeders. If the foregoing\r\nviews of the origin of trap-dikes in widely extended granitic regions\r\nfar from rocks of any other formation, be admitted as probable, we may\r\nfurther admit, in the case of a great body of plutonic rock, being\r\nimpelled by repeated movements into the axis of a mountain-chain, that\r\nits more liquid constituent parts might drain into deep and unseen\r\nabysses; afterwards, perhaps, to be brought to the surface under the\r\nform, either of injected masses of greenstone and augitic porphyry,[9]\r\nor of basaltic eruptions. Much of\r\nthe difficulty which geologists have experienced when they have\r\ncompared the composition of volcanic with plutonic formations, will, I\r\nthink, be removed, if we may believe that most plutonic masses have\r\nbeen, to a certain extent, drained of those comparatively weighty and\r\neasily liquified elements, which compose the trappean and basaltic\r\nseries of rocks.\r\n\r\n [8] Portions of these dikes have been broken off, and are now\r\n surrounded by the primary rocks, with their laminæ conformably winding\r\n round them. Dr. Hubbard also (_Silliman’s Journal,_ vol. xxxiv, p.\r\n 119), has described an interlacement of trap-veins in the granite of\r\n the White Mountains, which he thinks must have been formed when both\r\n rocks were soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] Mr. Phillips (“Lardner’s Encyclop.,” vol. ii, p. 115) quotes Von\r\n Buch’s statement, that augitic porphyry ranges parallel to, and is\r\n found constantly at the base of, great chains of mountains. Humboldt,\r\n also, has remarked the frequent occurrence of trap-rock, in a similar\r\n position; of which fact I have observed many examples at the foot of\r\n the Chilian Cordillera. The existence of granite in the axes of great\r\n mountain chains is always probable, and I am tempted to suppose, that\r\n the laterally injected masses of augitic porphyry and of trap, bear\r\n nearly the same relation to the granitic axes which basaltic lavas\r\n bear to the central trachytic masses, round the flanks of which they\r\n have so frequently been erupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the distribution of volcanic islands._—During my investigations on\r\ncoral-reefs, I had occasion to consult the works of many voyagers, and\r\nI was invariably struck with the fact, that with rare exceptions, the\r\ninnumerable islands scattered throughout the Pacific, Indian, and\r\nAtlantic Oceans, were composed either of volcanic, or of modern\r\ncoral-rocks. It would be tedious to give a long catalogue of all the\r\nvolcanic islands; but the exceptions which I have found are easily\r\nenumerated: in the Atlantic, we have St. Paul’s Rock, described in this\r\nvolume, and the Falkland Islands, composed of quartz and clay-slate;\r\nbut these latter islands are of considerable size, and lie not very far\r\nfrom the South American coast:[10] in the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles\r\n(situated in a line prolonged from Madagascar) consist of granite and\r\nquartz: in the Pacific Ocean, New Caledonia, an island of large size,\r\nbelongs (as far as is known) to the primary class. New Zealand, which\r\ncontains much volcanic rock and some active volcanoes, from its size\r\ncannot be classed with the small islands, which we are now considering.\r\nThe presence of a small quantity of non-volcanic rock, as of clay-slate\r\non three of the Azores,[11] or of tertiary limestone at Madeira, or of\r\nclay-slate at Chatham Island in the Pacific, or of lignite at Kerguelen\r\nLand, ought not to exclude such islands or archipelagoes, if formed\r\nchiefly of erupted matter, from the volcanic class.\r\n\r\n [10] Judging from Forster’s imperfect observation, perhaps Georgia is\r\n not volcanic. Dr. Allan is my informant with regard to the Seychelles.\r\n I do not know of what formation Rodriguez, in the Indian Ocean, is\r\n composed.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] This is stated on the authority of Count V. de Bedemar, with\r\n respect to Flores and Graciosa (Charlsworth, “Magazine of Nat. Hist.,”\r\n vol. i, p. 557). St. Maria has no volcanic rock, according to Captain\r\n Boyd (Von Buch “Descript.,” p. 365). Chatham Island has been described\r\n by Dr. Dieffenbach in the “Geographical Journal,” 1841, p. 201. As yet\r\n we have received only imperfect notices on Kerguelen Land, from the\r\n Antarctic Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the numerous islands scattered through the great\r\noceans being with such rare exceptions volcanic, is evidently an\r\nextension of that law, and the effect of those same causes, whether\r\nchemical or mechanical, from which it results, that a vast majority of\r\nthe volcanoes now in action stand either as islands in the sea, or near\r\nits shores. This fact of the ocean-islands being so generally volcanic\r\nis also interesting in relation to the nature of the mountain-chains on\r\nour\r\ncontinents, which are comparatively seldom volcanic; and yet we are led\r\nto suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean once extended.\r\nDo volcanic eruptions, we may ask, reach the surface more readily\r\nthrough fissures formed during the first stages of the conversion of\r\nthe bed of the ocean into a tract of land?\r\n\r\nLooking at the charts of the numerous volcanic archipelagoes, we see\r\nthat the islands are generally arranged either in single, double, or\r\ntriple rows, in lines which are frequently curved in a slight\r\ndegree.[12] Each separate island is either rounded, or more generally\r\nelongated in the same direction with the group in which it stands, but\r\nsometimes transversely to it. Some of the groups which are not much\r\nelongated present little symmetry in their forms; M. Virlet[13] states\r\nthat this is the case with the Grecian Archipelago: in such groups I\r\nsuspect (for I am aware how easy it is to deceive oneself on these\r\npoints), that the vents are generally arranged on one line, or on a set\r\nof short parallel lines, intersecting at nearly right angles another\r\nline, or set of lines. The Galapagos Archipelago offers an example of\r\nthis structure, for most of the islands and the chief orifices on the\r\nlargest island are so grouped as to fall on a set of lines ranging\r\nabout N.W. by N., and on another set ranging about W.S.W.: in the\r\nCanary Archipelago we have a simpler structure of the same kind: in the\r\nCape de Verde group, which appears to be the least symmetrical of any\r\noceanic volcanic archipelago, a N.W. and S.E. line formed by several\r\nislands, if prolonged, would intersect at right angles a curved line,\r\non which the remaining islands are placed. Von Buch[14] has classed all\r\nvolcanoes under two heads, namely, _central volcanoes_, round which\r\nnumerous eruptions have taken place on all sides, in a manner almost\r\nregular, and _volcanic chains._ In the examples given of the first\r\nclass, as far as position is concerned, I can see no grounds for their\r\nbeing called “central;” and the evidence of any difference in\r\nmineralogical nature between _central volcanoes_ and _volcanic chains_\r\nappears slight. No doubt some one island in most small volcanic\r\narchipelagoes is apt to be considerably higher than the others; and in\r\na similar manner, whatever the cause may be, that on the same island\r\none vent is generally higher than all the others. Von Buch does not\r\ninclude in his class of volcanic chains small archipelagoes, in which\r\nthe islands are admitted by him, as at the Azores, to be arranged in\r\nlines; but when viewing on a map of the world how perfect a series\r\nexists from a few volcanic islands placed in a row to a train of linear\r\narchipelagoes following each other in a straight line, and so on to a\r\ngreat wall like the Cordillera of America, it is difficult to believe\r\nthat there exists any essential difference between short and long\r\nvolcanic chains. Von Buch[15] states that his volcanic chains surmount,\r\nor are closely connected with, mountain-ranges of primary formation:\r\nbut if trains of linear archipelagoes are, in the course of time, by\r\nthe long-continued action of the elevatory and volcanic forces,\r\nconverted into mountain-ranges, it would naturally result that the\r\ninferior primary rocks would often be uplifted and brought into view.\r\n\r\n [12] Professors William and Henry Darwin Rogers have lately insisted\r\n much, in a memoir read before the American Association, on the\r\n regularly curved lines of elevation in parts of the Appalachian range.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] “Bulletin de la Soc. Géolog.,” tome iii, p. 110.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] “Description des Isles Canaries,” p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] _Idem,_ p. 393.\r\n\r\nSome authors have remarked that volcanic islands occur scattered,\r\nthough at very unequal distances, along the shores of the great\r\ncontinents, as if in some measure connected with them. In the case of\r\nJuan Fernandez, situated 330 miles from the coast of Chile, there was\r\nundoubtedly a connection between the volcanic forces acting under this\r\nisland and under the continent, as was shown during the earthquake of\r\n1835. The islands, moreover, of some of the small volcanic groups which\r\nthus border continents, are placed in lines, related to those along\r\nwhich the adjoining shores of the continents trend; I may instance the\r\nlines of intersection at the Galapagos, and at the Cape de Verde\r\nArchipelagoes, and the best marked line of the Canary Islands. If these\r\nfacts be not merely accidental, we see that many scattered volcanic\r\nislands and small groups are related not only by proximity, but in the\r\ndirection of the fissures of eruption to the neighbouring continents—a\r\nrelation, which Von Buch considers, characteristic of his great\r\nvolcanic chains.\r\n\r\nIn volcanic archipelagoes, the orifices are seldom in activity on more\r\nthan one island at a time; and the greater eruptions usually recur only\r\nafter long intervals. Observing the number of craters, that are usually\r\nfound on each island of a group, and the vast amount of matter which\r\nhas been erupted from them, one is led to attribute a high antiquity\r\neven to those groups, which appear, like the Galapagos, to be of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. This conclusion accords with the\r\nprodigious amount of degradation, by the slow action of the sea, which\r\ntheir originally sloping coasts must have suffered, when they are worn\r\nback, as is so often the case, into grand precipices. We ought not,\r\nhowever, to suppose, in hardly any instance, that the whole body of\r\nmatter, forming a volcanic island, has been erupted at the level, on\r\nwhich it now stands: the number of dikes, which seem invariably to\r\nintersect the interior parts of every volcano, show, on the principles\r\nexplained by M. Elie de Beaumont, that the whole mass has been uplifted\r\nand fissured. A connection, moreover, between volcanic eruptions and\r\ncontemporaneous elevations in mass[16] has, I think, been shown to\r\nexist in my work on Coral-Reefs, both from the frequent presence of\r\nupraised organic remains, and from the structure of the accompanying\r\ncoral-reefs. Finally, I may remark, that in the same Archipelago,\r\neruptions have taken place within the historical period on more than\r\none of the parallel lines of fissure: thus, at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, eruptions have taken place from a vent on Narborough\r\nIsland, and from one on Albemarle Island, which vents do not fall on\r\nthe same line; at the Canary Islands, eruptions have taken place in\r\nTeneriffe and Lanzarote; and at\r\nthe Azores, on the three parallel lines of Pico, St. Jorge, and\r\nTerceira. Believing that a mountain-axis differs essentially from a\r\nvolcano, only in plutonic rocks having been injected, instead of\r\nvolcanic matter having been ejected, this appears to me an interesting\r\ncircumstance; for we may infer from it as probable, that in the\r\nelevation of a mountain-chain, two or more of the parallel lines\r\nforming it may be upraised and injected within the same geological\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n [16] A similar conclusion is forced on us, by the phenomena, which\r\n accompanied the earthquake of 1835, at Concepcion, and which are\r\n detailed in my paper (vol. v, p. 601) in the “Geological\r\n Transactions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII AUSTRALIA; NEW ZEALAND; CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew South Wales.—Sandstone formation.—Embedded pseudo-fragments of\r\nshale.—Stratification.—Current-cleavage.—Great valleys.—Van Diemen’s\r\nLand.—Palæozoic formation.—Newer formation with volcanic\r\nrocks.—Travertin with leaves of extinct plants.—Elevation of the\r\nland.—New Zealand.—King George’s Sound.—Superficial ferruginous\r\nbeds.—Superficial calcareous deposits, with casts of branches.—Their\r\norigin from drifted particles of shells and corals.—Their extent.—Cape\r\nof Good Hope.—Junction of the granite and clay-slate.—Sandstone\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_, in her homeward voyage, touched at New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, Van Diemen’s Land, and the Cape of Good Hope. In order to\r\nconfine the Third Part of these Geological Observations to South\r\nAmerica, I will here briefly describe all that I observed at these\r\nplaces worthy of the attention of geologists.\r\n\r\n_New South Wales._—My opportunities of observation consisted of a ride\r\nof ninety geographical miles to Bathurst, in a W.N.W. direction from\r\nSydney. The first thirty miles from the coast passes over a sandstone\r\ncountry, broken up in many places by trap-rocks, and separated by a\r\nbold escarpment overhanging the river Nepean, from the great sandstone\r\nplatform of the Blue Mountains. This upper platform is 1,000 feet high\r\nat the edge of the escarpment, and rises in a distance of twenty-five\r\nmiles to between three and four thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea. At this distance the road descends to a country rather less\r\nelevated, and composed in chief part of primary rocks. There is much\r\ngranite, in one part passing into a red porphyry with octagonal\r\ncrystals of quartz, and intersected in some places by trap-dikes. Near\r\nthe Downs of Bathurst I passed over much pale-brown, glossy clay-slate,\r\nwith the shattered laminæ running north and south; I mention this fact,\r\nbecause Captain King informs me that, in the country a hundred miles\r\nsouthward, near Lake George, the mica-slate ranges so invariably north\r\nand south that the inhabitants take advantage of it in finding their\r\nway through the forests.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone of the Blue Mountains is at least 1,200 feet thick, and\r\nin some parts is apparently of greater thickness; it consists of\r\nsmall grains of quartz, cemented by white earthy matter, and it abounds\r\nwith ferruginous veins. The lower beds sometimes alternate with shales\r\nand coal: at Wolgan I found in carbonaceous shale leaves of the\r\n_Glossopteris Brownii_, a fern which so frequently accompanies the coal\r\nof Australia. The sandstone contains pebbles of quartz; and these\r\ngenerally increase in number and size (seldom, however, exceeding an\r\ninch or two in diameter) in the upper beds: I observed a similar\r\ncircumstance in the grand sandstone formation at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nOn the South American coast, where tertiary and supra-tertiary beds\r\nhave been extensively elevated, I repeatedly noticed that the uppermost\r\nbeds were formed of coarser materials than the lower: this appears to\r\nindicate that, as the sea became shallower, the force of the waves or\r\ncurrents increased. On the lower platform, however, between the Blue\r\nMountains and the coast, I observed that the upper beds of the\r\nsandstone frequently passed into argillaceous shale,—the effect,\r\nprobably, of this lower space having been protected from strong\r\ncurrents during its elevation. The sandstone of the Blue Mountains\r\nevidently having been of mechanical origin, and not having suffered any\r\nmetamorphic action, I was surprised at observing that, in some\r\nspecimens, nearly all the grains of quartz were so perfectly\r\ncrystallised with brilliant facets that they evidently had not in their\r\n_present_ form been aggregated in any previously existing rock.[1] It\r\nis difficult to imagine how these crystals could have been formed; one\r\ncan hardly believe that they were separately precipitated in their\r\npresent crystallised state. Is it possible that rounded grains of\r\nquartz may have been acted on by a fluid corroding their surfaces, and\r\ndepositing on them fresh silica? I may remark that, in the sandstone\r\nformation of the Cape of Good Hope, it is evident that silica has been\r\nprofusely deposited from aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n [1] I have lately seen, in a paper by Smith (the father of English\r\n geologists), in the _Magazine of Natural History_, that the grains of\r\n quartz in the millstone grit of England are often crystallised. Sir\r\n David Brewster, in a paper read before the British Association, 1840,\r\n states, that in old decomposed glass, the silex and metals separate\r\n into concentric rings, and that the silex regains its crystalline\r\n structure, as is shown by its action on light.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the sandstone I noticed patches of shale which\r\nmight at the first glance have been mistaken for extraneous fragments;\r\ntheir horizontal laminæ, however, being parallel with those of the\r\nsandstone, showed that they were the remnants of thin, continuous beds.\r\nOne such fragment (probably the section of a long narrow strip) seen in\r\nthe face of a cliff, was of greater vertical thickness than breadth,\r\nwhich proves that this bed of shale must have been in some slight\r\ndegree consolidated, after having been deposited, and before being worn\r\naway by the currents. Each patch of the shale shows, also, how slowly\r\nmany of the successive layers of sandstone were deposited. These\r\npseudo-fragments of shale will perhaps explain, in some cases, the\r\norigin of apparently extraneous fragments in crystalline metamorphic\r\nrocks. I mention this, because I found near Rio de Janeiro a\r\nwell-defined angular fragment, seven yards long by two yards in\r\nbreadth, of gneiss\r\ncontaining garnets and mica in layers, enclosed in the ordinary,\r\nstratified, porphyritic gneiss of the country. The laminæ of the\r\nfragment and of the surrounding matrix ran in exactly the same\r\ndirection, but they dipped at different angles. I do not wish to affirm\r\nthat this singular fragment (a solitary case, as far as I know) was\r\noriginally deposited in a layer, like the shale in the Blue Mountains,\r\nbetween the strata of the porphyritic gneiss, before they were\r\nmetamorphosed; but there is sufficient analogy between the two cases to\r\nrender such an explanation possible.\r\n\r\n_Stratification of the escarpment._—The strata of the Blue Mountains\r\nappear to the eye horizontal; but they probably have a similar\r\ninclination with the surface of the platform, which slopes from the\r\nwest towards the escarpment over the Nepean, at an angle of one degree,\r\nor of one hundred feet in a mile.[2] The strata of the escarpment dip\r\nalmost conformably with its steeply inclined face, and with so much\r\nregularity, that they appear as if thrown into their present position;\r\nbut on a more careful examination, they are seen to thicken and to thin\r\nout, and in the upper part to be succeeded and almost capped by\r\nhorizontal beds. These appearances render it probable, that we here see\r\nan original escarpment, not formed by the sea having eaten back into\r\nthe strata, but by the strata having originally extended only thus far.\r\nThose who have been in the habit of examining accurate charts of\r\nsea-coasts, where sediment is accumulating, will be aware, that the\r\nsurfaces of the banks thus formed, generally slope from the coast very\r\ngently towards a certain line in the offing, beyond which the depth in\r\nmost cases suddenly becomes great. I may instance the great banks of\r\nsediment within the West Indian Archipelago,[3] which terminate in\r\nsubmarine slopes, inclined at angles of between thirty and forty\r\ndegrees, and sometimes even at more than forty degrees: every one knows\r\nhow steep such a slope would appear on the land. Banks of this nature,\r\nif uplifted, would probably have nearly the same external form as the\r\nplatform of the Blue Mountains, where it abruptly terminates over the\r\nNepean.\r\n\r\n [2] This is stated on the authority of Sir T. Mitchell, in his\r\n “Travels,” vol. ii, p. 357.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I have described these very curious banks in the Appendix to my\r\n volume on the structure of Coral-Reefs. I have ascertained the\r\n inclination of the edges of the banks, from information given me by\r\n Captain B. Allen, one of the surveyors, and by carefully measuring the\r\n horizontal distances between the last sounding on the bank and the\r\n first in the deep water. Widely extended banks in all parts of the\r\n West Indies have the same general form of surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Current-cleavage._—The strata of sandstone in the low coast country,\r\nand likewise on the Blue Mountains, are often divided by cross or\r\ncurrent laminæ, which dip in different directions, and frequently at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees. Most authors have attributed these cross\r\nlayers to successive small accumulations on an inclined surface; but\r\nfrom a careful examination in some parts of the New Red Sandstone of\r\nEngland, I believe that such layers generally form parts of a series of\r\ncurves, like gigantic tidal ripples, the tops of which have since been\r\ncut off, either by nearly horizontal layers, or by another set of great\r\nripples, the folds of which do not exactly coincide with those below\r\nthem. It is well-known to surveyors that mud and sand are disturbed\r\nduring storms at considerable depths, at least from three hundred to\r\nfour hundred and fifty feet,[4] so that the nature of the bottom even\r\nbecomes temporarily changed; the bottom, also, at a depth between sixty\r\nand seventy feet, has been observed[5] to be broadly rippled. One may,\r\ntherefore, be allowed to suspect, from the appearance just mentioned in\r\nthe New Red Sandstone, that at greater depths, the bed of the ocean is\r\nheaped up during gales into great ripple-like furrows and depressions,\r\nwhich are afterwards cut off by the currents during more tranquil\r\nweather, and again furrowed during gales.\r\n\r\n [4] See Martin White, on “Soundings in the British Channel,” pp. 4 and\r\n 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] M. Siau on the “Action of Waves,” _Edin. New Phil. Journ.,_ vol.\r\n xxxi, p. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valleys in the sandstone platforms._—The grand valleys, by which the\r\nBlue Mountains and the other sandstone platforms of this part of\r\nAustralia are penetrated, and which long offered an insuperable\r\nobstacle to the attempts of the most enterprising colonist to reach the\r\ninterior country, form the most striking feature in the geology of New\r\nSouth Wales. They are of grand dimensions, and are bordered by\r\ncontinuous links of lofty cliffs. It is not easy to conceive a more\r\nmagnificent spectacle, than is presented to a person walking on the\r\nsummit-plains, when without any notice he arrives at the brink of one\r\nof these cliffs, which are so perpendicular, that he can strike with a\r\nstone (as I have tried) the trees growing, at the depth of between one\r\nthousand and one thousand five hundred feet below him; on both hands he\r\nsees headland beyond headland of the receding line of cliff, and on the\r\nopposite side of the valley, often at the distance of several miles, he\r\nbeholds another line rising up to the same height with that on which he\r\nstands, and formed of the same horizontal strata of pale sandstone. The\r\nbottoms of these valleys are moderately level, and the fall of the\r\nrivers flowing in them, according to Sir T. Mitchell, is gentle. The\r\nmain valleys often send into the platform great baylike arms, which\r\nexpand at their upper ends; and on the other hand, the platform often\r\nsends promontories into the valley, and even leaves in them great,\r\nalmost insulated, masses. So continuous are the bounding lines of\r\ncliff, that to descend into some of these valleys, it is necessary to\r\ngo round twenty miles; and into others, the surveyors have only lately\r\npenetrated, and the colonists have not yet been able to drive in their\r\ncattle. But the most remarkable point of structure in these valleys,\r\nis, that although several miles wide in their upper parts, they\r\ngenerally contract towards their mouths to such a degree as to become\r\nimpassable. The Surveyor-General, Sir T. Mitchell,[6] in vain\r\nendeavoured, first on foot and then by crawling between the great\r\nfallen\r\nfragments of sandstone, to ascend through the gorge by which the river\r\nGrose joins the Nepean; yet the valley of the Grose in its upper part,\r\nas I saw, forms a magnificent basin some miles in width, and is on all\r\nsides surrounded by cliffs, the summits of which are believed to be\r\nnowhere less than 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. When cattle\r\nare driven into the valley of the Wolgan by a path (which I descended)\r\npartly cut by the colonists, they cannot escape; for this valley is in\r\nevery other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs, and eight miles\r\nlower down, it contracts, from an average width of half a mile, to a\r\nmere chasm impassable to man or beast. Sir T. Mitchell[7] states, that\r\nthe great valley of the Cox river with all its branches contracts,\r\nwhere it unites with the Nepean, into a gorge 2,200 yards wide, and\r\nabout one thousand feet in depth. Other similar cases might have been\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n [6] “Travels in Australia,” vol. i, p. 154.—I must express my\r\n obligation to Sir T. Mitchell for several interesting personal\r\n communications on the subject of these great valleys of New South\r\n Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] _Idem_, vol. ii, p. 358.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first impression, from seeing the correspondence of the horizontal\r\nstrata, on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatre-like\r\ndepressions, is that they have been in chief part hollowed out, like\r\nother valleys, by aqueous erosion; but when one reflects on the\r\nenormous amount of stone, which on this view must have been removed, in\r\nmost of the above cases through mere gorges or chasms, one is led to\r\nask whether these spaces may not have subsided. But considering the\r\nform of the irregularly branching valleys, and of the narrow\r\npromontories, projecting into them from the platforms, we are compelled\r\nto abandon this notion. To attribute these hollows to alluvial action,\r\nwould be preposterous; nor does the drainage from the summit-level\r\nalways fall, as I remarked near the Weatherboard, into the head of\r\nthese valleys, but into one side of their bay-like recesses. Some of\r\nthe inhabitants remarked to me, that they never viewed one of these\r\nbaylike recesses, with the headlands receding on both hands, without\r\nbeing struck with their resemblance to a bold sea-coast. This is\r\ncertainly the case; moreover, the numerous fine harbours, with their\r\nwidely branching arms, on the present coast of New South Wales, which\r\nare generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth, from one mile\r\nto a quarter of a mile in width, passing through the sandstone\r\ncoast-cliffs, present a likeness, though on a miniature scale, to the\r\ngreat valleys of the interior. But then immediately occurs the\r\nstartling difficulty, why has the sea worn out these great, though\r\ncircumscribed, depressions on a wide platform, and left mere gorges,\r\nthrough which the whole vast amount of triturated matter must have been\r\ncarried away? The only light I can throw on this enigma, is by showing\r\nthat banks appear to be forming in some seas of the most irregular\r\nforms, and that the sides of such banks are so steep (as before stated)\r\nthat a comparatively small amount of subsequent erosion would form them\r\ninto cliffs: that the waves have power to form high and precipitous\r\ncliffs, even in landlocked harbours, I have observed in many parts of\r\nSouth America. In the Red Sea, banks with an extremely irregular\r\noutline and composed of sediment, are penetrated by the most singularly\r\nshaped creeks with narrow mouths: this is likewise the case, though on\r\na larger scale,\r\nwith the Bahama Banks. Such banks, I have been led to suppose,[8] have\r\nbeen formed by currents heaping sediment on an irregular bottom. That\r\nin some cases, the sea, instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform\r\nsheet, heaps it round submarine rocks and islands, it is hardly\r\npossible to doubt, after having examined the charts of the West Indies.\r\nTo apply these ideas to the sandstone platforms of New South Wales, I\r\nimagine that the strata might have been heaped on an irregular bottom\r\nby the action of strong currents, and of the undulations of an open\r\nsea; and that the valley-like spaces thus left unfilled might, during a\r\nslow elevation of the land, have had their steeply sloping flanks worn\r\ninto cliffs; the worn-down sandstone being removed, either at the time\r\nwhen the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea, or subsequently\r\nby alluvial action.\r\n\r\n [8] See the “Appendix” to the Part on Coral-Reefs. The fact of the sea\r\n heaping up mud round a submarine nucleus, is worthy of the notice of\r\n geologists: for outlyers of the same composition with the coast banks\r\n are thus formed; and these, if upheaved and worn into cliffs, would\r\n naturally be thought to have been once connected together.\r\n\r\n_Van Diemen’s Land._\r\n\r\nThe southern part of this island is mainly formed of mountains of\r\ngreenstone, which often assumes a syenitic character, and contains much\r\nhypersthene. These mountains, in their lower half, are generally\r\nencased by strata containing numerous small corals and some shells.\r\nThese shells have been examined by Mr. G. B. Sowerby, and have been\r\ndescribed by him: they consist of two species of Producta, and of six\r\nof Spirifera; two of these, namely, _P. rugata_ and _S. rotundata_,\r\nresemble, as far as their imperfect condition allows of comparison,\r\nBritish mountain-limestone shells. Mr. Lonsdale has had the kindness to\r\nexamine the corals; they consist of six undescribed species, belonging\r\nto three genera. Species of these genera occur in the Silurian,\r\nDevonian, and Carboniferous strata of Europe. Mr. Lonsdale remarks,\r\nthat all these fossils have undoubtedly a Palæozoic character, and that\r\nprobably they correspond in age to a division of the system above the\r\nSilurian formations.\r\n\r\nThe strata containing these remains are singular from the extreme\r\nvariability of their mineralogical composition. Every intermediate form\r\nis present, between flinty-slate, clay-slate passing into grey wacke,\r\npure limestone, sandstone, and porcellanic rock; and some of the beds\r\ncan only be described as composed of a siliceo-calcareo-clay-slate. The\r\nformation, as far as I could judge, is at least a thousand feet in\r\nthickness: the upper few hundred feet usually consist of a siliceous\r\nsandstone, containing pebbles and no organic remains; the inferior\r\nstrata, of which a pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant, are\r\nthe most variable; and these chiefly abound with the remains. Between\r\ntwo beds of hard crystalline limestone, near Newtown, a layer of white\r\nsoft calcareous matter is quarried, and is used for whitewashing\r\nhouses. From information given to me by Mr. Frankland, the\r\nSurveyor-General,\r\nit appears that this Palæozoic formation is found in different parts of\r\nthe whole island; from the same authority, I may add, that on the\r\nnorth-eastern coast and in Bass’ Straits primary rocks extensively\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Storm Bay are skirted, to the height of a few hundred\r\nfeet, by strata of sandstone, containing pebbles of the formation just\r\ndescribed, with its characteristic fossils, and therefore belonging to\r\na subsequent age. These strata of sandstone often pass into shale, and\r\nalternate with layers of impure coal; they have in many places been\r\nviolently disturbed. Near Hobart Town, I observed one dike, nearly a\r\nhundred yards in width, on one side of which the strata were tilted at\r\nan angle of 60 degrees, and on the other they were in some parts\r\nvertical, and had been altered by the effects of the heat. On the west\r\nside of Storm Bay, I found these strata capped by streams of basaltic\r\nlava with olivine; and close by there was a mass of brecciated scoriæ,\r\ncontaining pebbles of lava, which probably marks the place of an\r\nancient submarine crater. Two of these streams of basalt were separated\r\nfrom each other by a layer of argillaceous wacke, which could be traced\r\npassing into partially altered scoriæ. The wacke contained numerous\r\nrounded grains of a soft, grass-green mineral, with a waxy lustre, and\r\ntranslucent on its edges: under the blowpipe it instantly blackened,\r\nand the points fused into a strongly magnetic, black enamel. In these\r\ncharacters, it resembles those masses of decomposed olivine, described\r\nat St. Jago in the Cape de Verde group; and I should have thought that\r\nit had thus originated, had I not found a similar substance, in\r\ncylindrical threads, within the cells of the vesicular basalt,—a state\r\nunder which olivine never appears; this substance,[9] I believe, would\r\nbe classed as bole by mineralogists.\r\n\r\n [9] Chlorophæite, described by Dr. MacCulloch (“Western Islands,” vol.\r\n i, p. 504) as occurring in a basaltic amygdaloid, differs from this\r\n substance, in remaining unchanged before the blowpipe, and in\r\n blackening from exposure to the air. May we suppose that olivine, in\r\n undergoing the remarkable change described at St. Jago, passes through\r\n several states?\r\n\r\n_Travertin with extinct plants._—Behind Hobart Town there is a small\r\nquarry of a hard travertin, the lower strata of which abound with\r\ndistinct impressions of leaves. Mr. Robert Brown has had the kindness\r\nto look at my specimens, and he informed me that there are four or five\r\nkinds, none of which he recognises as belonging to existing species.\r\nThe most remarkable leaf is palmate, like that of a fan-palm, and no\r\nplant having leaves of this structure has hitherto been discovered in\r\nVan Diemen’s Land. The other leaves do not resemble the most usual form\r\nof the Eucalyptus (of which tribe the existing forests are chiefly\r\ncomposed), nor do they resemble that class of exceptions to the common\r\nform of the leaves of the Eucalyptus, which occur in this island. The\r\ntravertin containing this remnant of a lost vegetation, is of a pale\r\nyellow colour, hard, and in parts even crystalline; but not compact,\r\nand is everywhere penetrated by minute, tortuous, cylindrical pores. It\r\ncontains a very few pebbles of quartz, and occasionally layers of\r\nchalcedonic nodules, like those of chert in our Greensand. From\r\nthe pureness of this calcareous rock, it has been searched for in other\r\nplaces, but has never been found. From this circumstance, and from the\r\ncharacter of the deposit, it was probably formed by a calcareous spring\r\nentering a small pool or narrow creek. The strata have subsequently\r\nbeen tilted and fissured; and the surface has been covered by a\r\nsingular mass, with which, also, a large fissure has been filled up,\r\nformed of balls of trap embedded in a mixture of wacke and a white,\r\nearthy, alumino-calcareous substance. Hence it would appear, as if a\r\nvolcanic eruption had taken place on the borders of the pool, in which\r\nthe calcareous matter was depositing, and had broken it up and drained\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Elevation of the land._—Both the eastern and western shores of the\r\nbay, in the neighbourhood of Hobart Town, are in most parts covered to\r\nthe height of thirty feet above the level of high-water mark, with\r\nbroken shells, mingled with pebbles. The colonists attribute these\r\nshells to the aborigines having carried them up for food: undoubtedly,\r\nthere are many large mounds, as was pointed out to me by Mr. Frankland,\r\nwhich have been thus formed; but I think from the numbers of the\r\nshells, from their frequent small size, from the manner in which they\r\nare thinly scattered, and from some appearances in the form of the\r\nland, that we must attribute the presence of the greater number to a\r\nsmall elevation of the land. On the shore of Ralph Bay (opening into\r\nStorm Bay) I observed a continuous beach about fifteen feet above\r\nhigh-water mark, clothed with vegetation, and by digging into it,\r\npebbles encrusted with Serpulæ were found: along the banks, also, of\r\nthe river Derwent, I found a bed of broken sea-shells above the surface\r\nof the river, and at a point where the water is now much too fresh for\r\nsea-shells to live; but in both these cases, it is just possible, that\r\nbefore certain spits of sand and banks of mud in Storm Bay were\r\naccumulated, the tides might have risen to the height where we now find\r\nthe shells.[10]\r\n\r\n [10] It would appear that some changes are now in progress in Ralph\r\n Bay, for I was assured by an intelligent farmer, that oysters were\r\n formerly abundant in it, but that about the year 1834 they had,\r\n without any apparent cause, disappeared. In the “Transactions of the\r\n Maryland Academy” (vol. i, part i, p. 28) there is an account by Mr.\r\n Ducatel of vast beds of oysters and clams having been destroyed by the\r\n gradual filling up of the shallow lagoons and channels, on the shores\r\n of the southern United States. At Chiloe, in South America, I heard of\r\n a similar loss, sustained by the inhabitants, in the disappearance\r\n from one part of the coast of an edible species of Ascidia.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence more or less distinct of a change of level between the land\r\nand water, has been detected on almost all the land on this side of the\r\nglobe. Captain Grey, and other travellers, have found in Southern\r\nAustralia upraised shells, belonging either to the recent, or to a late\r\ntertiary period. The French naturalists in Baudin’s expedition, found\r\nshells similarly circumstanced on the S.W. coast of Australia. The Rev.\r\nW. B. Clarke[11] finds proofs of the elevation of the land, to the\r\namount of 400 feet, at the Cape of Good Hope. In the neighbourhood\r\nof the Bay of Islands in New Zealand,[12] I observed that the shores\r\nwere scattered to some height, as at Van Diemen’s Land, with\r\nsea-shells, which the colonists attribute to the natives. Whatever may\r\nhave been the origin of these shells, I cannot doubt, after having seen\r\na section of the valley of the Thames River (37 degrees S.), drawn by\r\nthe Rev. W. Williams, that the land has been there elevated: on the\r\nopposite sides of this great valley, three step-like terraces, composed\r\nof an enormous accumulation of rounded pebbles, exactly correspond with\r\neach other: the escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in\r\nheight. No one after having examined the terraces in the valleys on the\r\nwestern shores of South America, which are strewed with sea-shells, and\r\nhave been formed during intervals of rest in the slow elevation of the\r\nland, could doubt that the New Zealand terraces have been similarly\r\nformed. I may add, that Dr. Dieffenbach, in his description of the\r\nChatham Islands[13] (S.W. of New Zealand), states that it is manifest\r\n“that the sea has left many places bare which were once covered by its\r\nwaters.”\r\n\r\n [11] “Proceedings of the Geological Society,” vol. iii, p. 420.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] I will here give a catalogue of the rocks which I met with near\r\n the Bay of Islands, in New Zealand:—1st, Much basaltic lava, and\r\n scoriform rocks, forming distinct craters;—2nd, A castellated hill of\r\n horizontal strata of flesh-coloured limestone, showing when fractured\r\n distinct crystalline facets: the rain has acted on this rock in a\r\n remarkable manner, corroding its surface into a miniature model of an\r\n Alpine country: I observed here layers of chert and clay ironstone;\r\n and in the bed of a stream, pebbles of clay-slate;—3rd, The shores of\r\n the Bay of Islands are formed of a feldspathic rock, of a bluish-grey\r\n colour, often much decomposed, with an angular fracture, and crossed\r\n by numerous ferruginous seams, but without any distinct stratification\r\n or cleavage. Some varieties are highly crystalline, and would at once\r\n be pronounced to be trap; others strikingly resembled clay-slate,\r\n slightly altered by heat: I was unable to form any decided opinion on\r\n this formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] _Geographical Journal_, vol. xi, pp. 202, 205.\r\n\r\n_King George’s Sound._\r\n\r\nThis settlement is situated at the south-western angle of the\r\nAustralian continent: the whole country is granitic, with the\r\nconstituent minerals sometimes obscurely arranged in straight or curved\r\nlaminæ. In these cases, the rock would be called by Humboldt,\r\ngneiss-granite, and it is remarkable that the form of the bare conical\r\nhills, appearing to be composed of great folding layers, strikingly\r\nresembles, on a small scale, those composed of gneiss-granite at Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and those described by Humboldt at Venezuela. These plutonic\r\nrocks are, in many places, intersected by trappean-dikes; in one place,\r\nI found ten parallel dikes ranging in an E. and W. line; and not far\r\noff another set of eight dikes, composed of a different variety of\r\ntrap, ranging at right angles to the former ones. I have observed in\r\nseveral primary districts, the occurrence of systems of dikes parallel\r\nand close to each other.\r\n\r\n_Superficial ferruginous beds._—The lower parts of the country are\r\neverywhere covered by a bed, following the inequalities of the surface,\r\nof a honeycombed sandstone, abounding with oxides of iron. Beds of\r\nnearly similar composition are common, I believe, along the whole\r\nwestern coast of Australia, and on many of the East Indian islands. At\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, at the base of the mountains formed of granite\r\nand capped with sandstone, the ground is everywhere coated either by a\r\nfine-grained, rubbly, ochraceous mass, like that at King George’s\r\nSound, or by a coarser sandstone with fragments of quartz, and rendered\r\nhard and heavy by an abundance of the hydrate of iron, which presents,\r\nwhen freshly broken, a metallic lustre. Both these varieties have a\r\nvery irregular texture, including spaces either rounded or angular,\r\nfull of loose sand: from this cause the surface is always honeycombed.\r\nThe oxide of iron is most abundant on the edges of the cavities, where\r\nalone it affords a metallic fracture. In these formations, as well as\r\nin many true sedimentary deposits, it is evident that iron tends to\r\nbecome aggregated, either in the form of a shell, or of a network. The\r\norigin of these superficial beds, though sufficiently obscure, seems to\r\nbe due to alluvial action on detritus abounding with iron.\r\n\r\n_ Superficial calcareous deposit._—A calcareous deposit on the summit\r\nof Bald Head, containing branched bodies, supposed by some authors to\r\nhave been corals, has been celebrated by the descriptions of many\r\ndistinguished voyagers.[14] It folds round and conceals irregular\r\nhummocks of granite, at the height of 600 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. It varies much in thickness; where stratified, the beds are often\r\ninclined at high angles, even as much as at thirty degrees, and they\r\ndip in all directions. These beds are sometimes crossed by oblique and\r\neven-sided laminæ. The deposit consists either of a fine, white\r\ncalcareous powder, in which not a trace of structure can be discovered,\r\nor of exceedingly minute, rounded grains, of brown, yellowish, and\r\npurplish colours; both varieties being generally, but not always, mixed\r\nwith small particles of quartz, and being cemented into a more or less\r\nperfect stone. The rounded calcareous grains, when heated in a slight\r\ndegree, instantly lose their colours; in this and in every other\r\nrespect, closely resembling those minute, equal-sized particles of\r\nshells and corals, which at St. Helena have been drifted up the side of\r\nthe mountains, and have thus been winnowed of all coarser fragments. I\r\ncannot doubt that the coloured calcareous particles here have had a\r\nsimilar origin. The impalpable powder has probably been derived from\r\nthe decay of the rounded particles; this certainly is possible, for on\r\nthe coast of Peru, I have traced _large unbroken_ shells gradually\r\nfalling into a substance as fine as powdered chalk. Both of the\r\nabove-mentioned varieties of calcareous sandstone frequently alternate\r\nwith, and blend into, thin layers of a hard substalagmitic[15] rock,\r\nwhich, even\r\nwhen the stone on each side contains particles of quartz, is entirely\r\nfree from them: hence we must suppose that these layers, as well as\r\ncertain vein-like masses, have been formed by rain dissolving the\r\ncalcareous matter and re-precipitating it, as has happened at St.\r\nHelena. Each layer probably marks a fresh surface, when the, now firmly\r\ncemented, particles existed as loose sand. These layers are sometimes\r\nbrecciated and re-cemented, as if they had been broken by the slipping\r\nof the sand when soft. I did not find a single fragment of a sea-shell;\r\nbut bleached shells of the _Helix melo_, an existing land species,\r\nabound in all the strata; and I likewise found another Helix, and the\r\ncase of an Oniscus.\r\n\r\n [14] I visited this hill, in company with Captain Fitzroy, and we came\r\n to a similar conclusion regarding these branching bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] I adopt this term from Lieutenant Nelson’s excellent paper on the\r\n Bermuda Islands (“Geolog. Trans.,” vol. v, p. 106), for the hard,\r\n compact, cream- or brown-coloured stone, without any crystalline\r\n structure, which so often accompanies superficial calcareous\r\n accumulations. I have observed such superficial beds, coated with\r\n substalagmitic rock, at the Cape of Good Hope, in several parts of\r\n Chile, and over wide spaces in La Plata and Patagonia. Some of these\r\n beds have been formed from decayed shells, but the origin of the\r\n greater number is sufficiently obscure. The causes which determine\r\n water to dissolve lime, and then soon to redeposit it, are not, I\r\n think, known. The surface of the substalagmitic layers appears always\r\n to be corroded by the rain-water. As all the above-mentioned countries\r\n have a long dry season, compared with the rainy one, I should have\r\n thought that the presence of the substalagmitic was connected with the\r\n climate, had not Lieutenant Nelson found this substance forming under\r\n sea-water. Disintegrated shell seems to be extremely soluble; of which\r\n I found good evidence, in a curious rock at Coquimbo in Chile, which\r\n consisted of small, pellucid, empty husks, cemented together. A series\r\n of specimens clearly showed that these husks had originally contained\r\n small rounded particles of shells, which had been enveloped and\r\n cemented together by calcareous matter (as often happens on\r\n sea-beaches), and which subsequently had decayed, and been dissolved\r\n by water, that must have penetrated through the calcareous husks,\r\n without corroding them,—of which processes every stage could be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe branches are absolutely undistinguishable in shape from the broken\r\nand upright stumps of a thicket; their roots are often uncovered, and\r\nare seen to diverge on all sides; here and there a branch lies\r\nprostrate. The branches generally consist of the sandstone, rather\r\nfirmer than the surrounding matter, with the central parts filled,\r\neither with friable, calcareous matter, or with a substalagmitic\r\nvariety; this central part is also frequently penetrated by linear\r\ncrevices, sometimes, though rarely, containing a trace of woody matter.\r\nThese calcareous, branching bodies, appear to have been formed by fine\r\ncalcareous matter being washed into the casts or cavities, left by the\r\ndecay of branches and roots of thickets, buried under drifted sand. The\r\nwhole surface of the hill is now undergoing disintegration, and hence\r\nthe casts, which are compact and hard, are left projecting. In\r\ncalcareous sand at the Cape of Good Hope, I found the casts, described\r\nby Abel, quite similar to these at Bald Head; but their centres are\r\noften filled with black carbonaceous matter not yet removed. It is not\r\nsurprising, that the woody matter should have been almost entirely\r\nremoved from the casts on Bald Head; for it is certain, that many\r\ncenturies must have elapsed since the thickets were buried; at present,\r\nowing to the form and height of the narrow promontory, no sand is\r\ndrifted up, and the whole surface, as I have remarked, is wearing away.\r\nWe must, therefore,\r\nlook back to a period when the land stood lower, of which the French\r\nnaturalists[16] found evidence in upraised shells of recent species,\r\nfor the drifting on Bald Head of the calcareous and quartzose sand, and\r\nthe consequent embedment of the vegetable remains. There was only one\r\nappearance which at first made me doubt concerning the origin of the\r\ncast,—namely, that the finer roots from different stems sometimes\r\nbecame united together into upright plates or veins; but when the\r\nmanner is borne in mind in which fine roots often fill up cracks in\r\nhard earth, and that these roots would decay and leave hollows, as well\r\nas the stems, there is no real difficulty in this case. Besides the\r\ncalcareous branches from the Cape of Good Hope, I have seen casts, of\r\nexactly the same forms, from Madeira[17] and from Bermuda; at this\r\nlatter place, the surrounding calcareous rocks, judging from the\r\nspecimens collected by Lieutenant Nelson, are likewise similar, as is\r\ntheir subaerial formation. Reflecting on the stratification of the\r\ndeposit on Bald Head,—on the irregularly alternating layers of\r\nsubstalagmitic rock,—on the uniformly sized, and rounded particles,\r\napparently of sea-shells and corals,—on the abundance of land-shells\r\nthroughout the mass,—and finally, on the absolute resemblance of the\r\ncalcareous casts, to the stumps, roots, and branches of that kind of\r\nvegetation, which would grow on sand-hillocks, I think there can be no\r\nreasonable doubt, notwithstanding the different opinion of some\r\nauthors, that a true view of their origin has been here given.\r\n\r\n [16] See M. Péron’s “Voyage,” tome i, p. 204.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] Dr. J. Macaulay has fully described (_Edinb. New Phil. Journ.,_\r\n vol. xxix, p. 350) the casts from Madeira. He considers (differently\r\n from Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill) these bodies to be corals, and the\r\n calcareous deposit to be of subaqueous origin. His arguments chiefly\r\n rest (for his remarks on their structure are vague) on the great\r\n quantity of the calcareous matter, and on the casts containing animal\r\n matter, as shown by their evolving ammonia. Had Dr. Macaulay seen the\r\n enormous masses of rolled particles of shells and corals on the beach\r\n of Ascension, and especially on coral-reefs; and had he reflected on\r\n the effects of long-continued, gentle winds, in drifting up the finer\r\n particles, he would hardly have advanced the argument of quantity,\r\n which is seldom trustworthy in geology. If the calcareous matter has\r\n originated from disintegrated shells and corals, the presence of\r\n animal matter is what might have been expected. Mr. Anderson analysed\r\n for Dr. Macaulay part of a cast, and he found it composed of—\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime\t73·15 Silica\t11·90 Phosphate of lime\t8·81\r\nAnimal matter\t4·25 Sulphate of lime\ta trace ——— 98·11\r\n\r\nCalcareous deposits, like these of King George’s Sound, are of vast\r\nextent on the Australian shores. Dr. Fitton remarks, that “recent\r\ncalcareous breccia (by which term all these deposits are included) was\r\nfound during Baudin’s voyage, over a space of no less than twenty-five\r\ndegrees\r\nof latitude and an equal extent of longitude, on the southern, western,\r\nand north-western coasts.”[18] It appears also from M. Peron, with\r\nwhose observations and opinions on the origin of the calcareous matter\r\nand branching casts mine entirely accord, that the deposit is generally\r\nmuch more continuous than near King George’s Sound. At Swan River,\r\nArchdeacon Scott[19] states that in one part it extends ten miles\r\ninland. Captain Wickham, moreover, informs me that during his late\r\nsurvey of the western coast, the bottom of the sea, wherever the vessel\r\nanchored, was ascertained, by crowbars being let down, to consist of\r\nwhite calcareous matter. Hence it seems that along this coast, as at\r\nBermuda and at Keeling Atoll, submarine and subaerial deposits are\r\ncontemporaneously in process of formation, from the disintegration of\r\nmarine organic bodies. The extent of these deposits, considering their\r\norigin, is very striking; and they can be compared in this respect only\r\nwith the great coral-reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In other\r\nparts of the world, for instance in South America, there are\r\n_superficial_ calcareous deposits of great extent, in which not a trace\r\nof organic structure is discoverable; these observations would lead to\r\nthe inquiry, whether such deposits may not, also, have been formed from\r\ndisintegrated shells and corals.\r\n\r\n [18] For ample details on this formation consult Dr. Fitton’s\r\n “Appendix to Captain King’s Voyage.” Dr. Fitton is inclined to\r\n attribute a concretionary origin to the branching bodies: I may\r\n remark, that I have seen in beds of sand in La Plata cylindrical stems\r\n which no doubt thus originated; but they differed much in appearance\r\n from these at Bald Head, and the other places above specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] “Proceedings of the Geolog. Soc.,” vol. i, p. 320.\r\n\r\n_Cape of Good Hope._\r\n\r\nAfter the accounts given by Barrow, Carmichael, Basil Hall, and W. B.\r\nClarke of the geology of this district, I shall confine myself to a few\r\nobservations on the junction of the three principal formations. The\r\nfundamental rock is granite,[20] overlaid by clay-slate: the latter is\r\ngenerally hard, and glossy from containing minute scales of mica; it\r\nalternates with, and passes into, beds of slightly crystalline,\r\nfeldspathic, slaty rock. This clay-slate is remarkable from being in\r\nsome places (as on the Lion’s Rump) decomposed, even to the depth of\r\ntwenty feet, into a pale-coloured, sandstone-like rock, which has been\r\nmistaken, I believe, by some observers, for a separate formation. I was\r\nguided by Dr. Andrew Smith to a fine junction at Green Point between\r\nthe granite and clay-slate: the latter at the distance of a quarter of\r\na mile\r\nfrom the spot, where the granite appears on the beach (though,\r\nprobably, the granite is much nearer underground), becomes slightly\r\nmore compact and crystalline. At a less distance, some of the beds of\r\nclay-slate are of a homogeneous texture, and obscurely striped with\r\ndifferent zones of colour, whilst others are obscurely spotted. Within\r\na hundred yards of the first vein of granite, the clay-slate consists\r\nof several varieties; some compact with a tinge of purple, others\r\nglistening with numerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly\r\ncrystallised feldspar; some obscurely granular, others porphyritic with\r\nsmall, elongated spots of a soft white mineral, which being easily\r\ncorroded, gives to this variety a vesicular appearance. Close to the\r\ngranite, the clay-slate is changed into a dark-coloured, laminated\r\nrock, having a granular fracture, which is due to imperfect crystals of\r\nfeldspar, coated by minute, brilliant scales of mica.\r\n\r\n [20] In several places I observed in the granite, small dark-coloured\r\n balls, composed of minute scales of black mica in a tough basis. In\r\n another place, I found crystals of black schorl radiating from a\r\n common centre. Dr. Andrew Smith found, in the interior parts of the\r\n country, some beautiful specimens of granite, with silvery mica\r\n radiating or rather branching, like moss, from central points. At the\r\n Geological Society, there are specimens of granite with crystallised\r\n feldspar branching and radiating in like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual junction between the granitic and clay-slate districts\r\nextends over a width of about two hundred yards, and consists of\r\nirregular masses and of numerous dikes of granite, entangled and\r\nsurrounded by the clay-slate: most of the dikes range in a N.W. and\r\nS.E. line, parallel to the cleavage of the slate. As we leave the\r\njunction, thin beds, and lastly, mere films of the altered clay-slate\r\nare seen, quite isolated, as if floating, in the coarsely crystallised\r\ngranite; but although completely detached, they all retain traces of\r\nthe uniform N.W. and S.E. cleavage. This fact has been observed in\r\nother similar cases, and has been advanced by some eminent\r\ngeologists,[21] as a great difficulty on the ordinary theory, of\r\ngranite having been injected whilst liquified; but if we reflect on the\r\nprobable state of the lower surface of a laminated mass, like\r\nclay-slate, after having been violently arched by a body of molten\r\ngranite, we may conclude that it would be full of fissures parallel to\r\nthe planes of cleavage; and that these would be filled with granite, so\r\nthat wherever the fissures were close to each other, mere parting\r\nlayers or wedges of the slate would depend into the granite. Should,\r\ntherefore, the whole body of rock afterwards become worn down and\r\ndenuded, the lower ends of these dependent masses or wedges of slate\r\nwould be left quite isolated in the granite; yet they would retain\r\ntheir proper lines of cleavage, from having been united, whilst the\r\ngranite was fluid, with a continuous covering of clay-slate.\r\n\r\n [21] See M. Keilhau’s “Theory on Granite” translated in the _Edinburgh\r\n New Philosophical Journal,_ vol.xxiv, p. 402.\r\n\r\nFollowing, in company with Dr. A. Smith, the line of junction between\r\nthe granite and the slate, as it stretched inland, in a S.E. direction,\r\nwe came to a place, where the slate was converted into a fine-grained,\r\nperfectly characterised gneiss, composed of yellow-brown granular\r\nfeldspar, of abundant black brilliant mica, and of few and thin laminæ\r\nof quartz. From the abundance of the mica in this gneiss, compared with\r\nthe small quantity and excessively minute scales, in which it exists in\r\nthe glossy clay-slate, we must conclude, that it has been here formed\r\nby the metamorphic action—a circumstance doubted, under nearly similar\r\ncircumstances, by some authors. The laminæ of the clay-slate are\r\nstraight; and it was interesting to observe, that as they assumed\r\nthe character of gneiss, they became undulatory with some of the\r\nsmaller flexures angular, like the laminæ of many true metamorphic\r\nschists.\r\n\r\n_Sandstone formation._—This formation makes the most imposing feature\r\nin the geology of Southern Africa. The strata are in many parts\r\nhorizontal, and attain a thickness of about two thousand feet. The\r\nsandstone varies in character; it contains little earthy matter, but is\r\noften stained with iron; some of the beds are very fine-grained and\r\nquite white; others are as compact and homogeneous as quartz rock. In\r\nsome places I observed a breccia of quartz, with the fragments almost\r\ndissolved in a siliceous paste. Broad veins of quartz, often including\r\nlarge and perfect crystals, are very numerous; and it is evident in\r\nnearly all the strata, that silica has been deposited from solution in\r\nremarkable quantity. Many of the varieties of quartzite appeared quite\r\nlike metamorphic rocks; but from the upper strata being as siliceous as\r\nthe lower, and from the undisturbed junctions with the granite, which\r\nin many places can be examined, I can hardly believe that these\r\nsandstone-strata have been exposed to heat.[22] On the lines of\r\njunction between these two great formations, I found in several places\r\nthe granite decayed to the depth of a few inches, and succeeded, either\r\nby a thin layer of ferruginous shale, or by four or five inches in\r\nthickness of the re-cemented crystals of the granite, on which the\r\ngreat pile of sandstone immediately rested.\r\n\r\n [22] The Rev. W. B. Clarke, however, states, to my surprise (“Geolog.\r\n Proceedings,” vol. iii, p. 422), that the sandstone in some parts is\r\n penetrated by granitic dikes: such dikes must belong to an epoch\r\n altogether subsequent to that when the molten granite acted on the\r\n clay-slate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Schomburgk has described[23] a great sandstone formation in\r\nNorthern Brazil, resting on granite, and resembling to a remarkable\r\ndegree, in composition and in the external form of the land, this\r\nformation of the Cape of Good Hope. The sandstones of the great\r\nplatforms of Eastern Australia, which also rest on granite, differ in\r\ncontaining more earthy and less siliceous matter. No fossil remains\r\nhave been discovered in these three vast deposits. Finally, I may add\r\nthat I did not see any boulders of far-transported rocks at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, or on the eastern and western shores of Australia, or at Van\r\nDiemen’s Land. In the northern island of New Zealand, I noticed some\r\nlarge blocks of greenstone, but whether their parent rock was far\r\ndistant, I had no opportunity of determining.\r\n\r\n [23] _Geographical Journal,_ vol. x, p. 246.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the remarkable “trilogy” constituted by Darwin’s writings which deal\r\nwith the geology of the _Beagle_, the member which has perhaps\r\nattracted least attention, up to the present time is that which treats\r\nof the geology of South America. The actual writing of this book\r\nappears to have occupied Darwin a shorter period than either of the\r\nother volumes of the series; his diary records that the work was\r\naccomplished within ten months, namely, between July 1844 and April\r\n1845; but the book was not actually issued till late in the year\r\nfollowing, the preface bearing the date “September 1846.” Altogether,\r\nas Darwin informs us in his “Autobiography,” the geological books\r\n“consumed four and a half years’ steady work,” most of the remainder of\r\nthe ten years that elapsed between the return of the _Beagle_, and the\r\ncompletion of his geological books being, it is sad to relate, “lost\r\nthrough illness!”\r\n\r\nConcerning the “Geological Observations on South America,” Darwin wrote\r\nto his friend Lyell, as follows:—“My volume will be about 240 pages,\r\ndreadfully dull, yet much condensed. I think whenever you have time to\r\nlook through it, you will think the collection of facts on the\r\nelevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good.”\r\n\r\n“Much condensed” is the verdict that everyone must endorse, on rising\r\nfrom the perusal of this remarkable book; but by no means “dull.” The\r\nthree and a half years from April 1832 to September 1835, were spent by\r\nDarwin in South America, and were devoted to continuous scientific\r\nwork; the problems he dealt with were either purely geological or those\r\nwhich constitute the borderland between the geological and biological\r\nsciences. It is impossible to read the journal which he kept during\r\nthis time without being impressed by the conviction\r\nthat it contains all the germs of thought which afterwards developed\r\ninto the “Origin of Species.” But it is equally evident that after his\r\nreturn to England, biological speculations gradually began to exercise\r\na more exclusive sway over Darwin’s mind, and tended to dispossess\r\ngeology, which during the actual period of the voyage certainly\r\nengrossed most of his time and attention. The wonderful series of\r\nobservations made during those three and a half years in South America\r\ncould scarcely be done justice to, in the 240 pages devoted to their\r\nexposition. That he executed the work of preparing the book on South\r\nAmerica in somewhat the manner of a task, is shown by many references\r\nin his letters. Writing to Sir Joseph Hooker in 1845, he says, “I hope\r\nthis next summer to finish my South American Geology, then to get out a\r\nlittle Zoology, and _hurrah for my species work!_”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the feeling of disappointment, which Darwin so often\r\nexperienced in comparing a book when completed, with the observations\r\nand speculations which had inspired it, was more keenly felt in the\r\ncase of his volume on South America than any other. To one friend he\r\nwrites, “I have of late been slaving extra hard, to the great\r\ndiscomfiture of wretched digestive organs, at South America, and thank\r\nall the fates, I have done three-fourths of it. Writing plain English\r\ngrows with me more and more difficult, and never attainable. As for\r\nyour pretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure\r\ngeological descriptions, lay not such a flattering unction on my soul,\r\nfor it is incredible.” To another friend he writes, “You do not know\r\nwhat you threaten when you propose to read it—it is purely geological.\r\nI said to my brother, ‘You will of course read it,’ and his answer was,\r\n‘Upon my life, I would sooner even buy it.’”\r\n\r\nIn spite of these disparaging remarks, however, we are strongly\r\ninclined to believe that this book, despised by its author, and\r\nneglected by his contemporaries, will in the end be admitted to be one\r\nof Darwin’s chief titles to fame. It is, perhaps, an unfortunate\r\ncircumstance that the great success which he attained in biology by the\r\npublication of the “Origin of Species” has, to some extent,\r\novershadowed the fact that Darwin’s claims as a geologist, are of the\r\nvery highest order. It is not too much to say that, had Darwin not been\r\na geologist, the “Origin of Species” could never have been written by\r\nhim. But apart from those geological questions, which have an important\r\nbearing on biological thought and speculation, such as the proofs of\r\nimperfection in the geological record, the relations of the later\r\ntertiary faunas to the recent ones in the same areas, and the apparent\r\nintermingling of types belonging to distant geological epochs, when we\r\nstudy the palæontology of remote districts,—there are other purely\r\ngeological problems, upon which the contributions made by Darwin are of\r\nthe very highest value. I believe that the verdict of the historians of\r\nscience will be that if Darwin had not taken a foremost place among the\r\nbiologists of this century, his position as a geologist would have been\r\nan almost equally commanding one.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Darwin’s principal geological work—that relating to\r\nthe origin of the crystalline schists,—geologists were not at the time\r\nprepared to receive his revolutionary teachings. The influence of\r\npowerful authority was long exercised, indeed, to stifle his teaching,\r\nand only now, when this unfortunate opposition has disappeared, is the\r\ntrue nature and importance of Darwin’s purely geological work beginning\r\nto be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe two first chapters of the “Geological Observations on South\r\nAmerica,” deal with the proofs which exist of great, but frequently\r\ninterrupted, movements of elevation during very recent geological\r\ntimes. In connection with this subject, Darwin’s particular attention\r\nwas directed to the relations between the great earthquakes of South\r\nAmerica—of some of which he had impressive experience—and the permanent\r\nchanges of elevation which were taking place. He was much struck by the\r\nrapidity with which the evidence of such great earth movements is\r\nfrequently obliterated; and especially with the remarkable way in which\r\nthe action of rain-water, percolating through deposits on the earth’s\r\nsurface, removes all traces of shells and other calcareous organisms.\r\nIt was these considerations which were the parents of the\r\ngeneralisation that a palæontological record can only be preserved\r\nduring those periods in which long-continued slow subsidence is going\r\non. This in turn, led to the still wider and more suggestive conclusion\r\nthat the geological record as a whole is, and never can be more than, a\r\nseries of more or less isolated fragments. The recognition of this\r\nimportant fact constitutes the keystone to any theory of evolution\r\nwhich seeks to find a basis in the actual study of the types of life\r\nthat have formerly inhabited our globe.\r\n\r\nIn his third chapter, Darwin gives a number of interesting facts,\r\ncollected during his visits to the plains and valleys of Chili, which\r\nbear on the question of the origin of saliferous deposits—the\r\naccumulation of salt, gypsum, and nitrate of soda. This is a\r\nproblem that has excited much discussion among geologists, and which,\r\nin spite of many valuable observations, still remains to a great extent\r\nvery obscure. Among the important considerations insisted upon by\r\nDarwin is that relating to the absence of marine shells in beds\r\nassociated with such deposits. He justly argues that if the strata were\r\nformed in shallow waters, and then exposed by upheaval to subaerial\r\naction, all shells and other calcareous organisms would be removed by\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nFollowing Lyell’s method, Darwin proceeds from the study of deposits\r\nnow being accumulated on the earth’s surface, to those which have been\r\nformed during the more recent periods of the geological history.\r\n\r\nHis account of the great Pampean formation, with its wonderful\r\nmammalian remains—_Mastodon, Toxodon, Scelidotherium, Macrauchenia,\r\nMegatherium, Megalonyx, Mylodon,_ and _ Glyptodon_—this full of\r\ninterest. His discovery of the remains of a true _Equus_ afforded a\r\nremarkable confirmation of the fact—already made out in North\r\nAmerica—that species of horse had existed and become extinct in the New\r\nWorld, before their introduction by the Spaniards in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Fully perceiving the importance of the microscope in studying\r\nthe nature and origin of such deposits as those of the Pampas, Darwin\r\nsubmitted many of his specimens both to Dr. Carpenter in this country,\r\nand to Professor Ehrenberg in Berlin. Many very important notes on the\r\nmicroscopic organisms contained in the formation will be found\r\nscattered through the chapter.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s study of the older tertiary formations, with their abundant\r\nshells, and their relics of vegetable life buried under great sheets of\r\nbasalt, led him to consider carefully the question of climate during\r\nthese earlier periods. In opposition to prevalent views on this\r\nsubject, Darwin points out that his observations are opposed to the\r\nconclusion that a higher temperature prevailed universally over the\r\nglobe during early geological periods. He argues that “the causes which\r\ngave to the older tertiary productions of the quite temperate zones of\r\nEurope a tropical character, _were of a local character and did not\r\naffect the whole globe._” In this, as in many similar instances, we see\r\nthe beneficial influence of extensive travel in freeing Darwin’s mind\r\nfrom prevailing prejudices. It was this widening of experience which\r\nrendered him so especially qualified to deal with the great problem of\r\nthe origin of species, and in doing so to emancipate himself from ideas\r\nwhich were received with unquestioning faith by\r\ngeologists whose studies had been circumscribed within the limits of\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordilleras of Northern and Central Chili, Darwin, when studying\r\nstill older formations, clearly recognised that they contain an\r\nadmixture of the forms of life, which in Europe are distinctive of the\r\nCretaceous and Jurassic periods respectively. He was thus led to\r\nconclude that the classification of geological periods, which fairly\r\nwell expresses the facts that had been discovered in the areas where\r\nthe science was first studied, is no longer capable of being applied\r\nwhen we come to the study of widely distant regions. This important\r\nconclusion led up to the further generalisation that each great\r\ngeological period has exhibited a geographical distribution of the\r\nforms of animal and vegetable life, comparable to that which prevails\r\nin the existing fauna and flora. To those who are familiar with the\r\nextent to which the doctrine of universal formations has affected\r\ngeological thought and speculation, both long before and since the time\r\nthat Darwin wrote, the importance of this new standpoint to which he\r\nwas able to attain will be sufficiently apparent. Like the idea of the\r\nextreme imperfection of the Geological Record, the doctrine of _ local_\r\ngeological formations is found permeating and moulding all the\r\npalæontological reasonings of his great work.\r\n\r\nIn one of Darwin’s letters, written while he was in South America,\r\nthere is a passage we have already quoted, in which he expresses his\r\ninability to decide between the rival claims upon his attention of “the\r\nold crystalline group of rocks,” and “the softer fossiliferous beds”\r\nrespectively. The sixth chapter of the work before us, entitled\r\n“Plutonic and Metamorphic Rocks—Cleavage and Foliation,” contains a\r\nbrief summary of a series of observations and reasonings upon these\r\ncrystalline rocks, which are, we believe, calculated to effect a\r\nrevolution in geological science, and—though their value and importance\r\nhave long been overlooked—are likely to entitle Darwin in the future to\r\na position among geologists, scarcely, if at all, inferior to that\r\nwhich he already occupies among biologists.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s studies of the great rock-masses of the Andes convinced him of\r\nthe close relations between the granitic or Plutonic rocks, and those\r\nwhich were undoubtedly poured forth as lavas. Upon his return, he set\r\nto work, with the aid of Professor Miller, to make a careful study of\r\nthe minerals composing the granites and those which occur in the lavas,\r\nand he was able to show that in all essential respects they are\r\nidentical. He was further able to\r\nprove that there is a complete gradation between the highly crystalline\r\nor granitic rock-masses, and those containing more or less glassy\r\nmatter between their crystals, which constitute ordinary lavas. The\r\nimportance of this conclusion will be realised when we remember that it\r\nwas then the common creed of geologists—and still continues to be so on\r\nthe Continent—that all highly crystalline rocks are of great geological\r\nantiquity, and that the igneous ejections which have taken place since\r\nthe beginning of the tertiary periods differ essentially, in their\r\ncomposition, their structure, and their mode of occurrence, from those\r\nwhich have made their appearance at earlier periods of the world’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nVery completely have the conclusions of Darwin upon these subjects been\r\njustified by recent researches. In England, the United States, and\r\nItaly, examples of the gradual passage of rocks of truly granitic\r\nstructure into ordinary lavas have been described, and the reality of\r\nthe transition has been demonstrated by the most careful studies with\r\nthe microscope. Recent researches carried on in South America by\r\nProfessor Stelzner, have also shown the existence of a class of highly\r\ncrystalline rocks—the “Andengranites”—which combine in themselves many\r\nof the characteristics which were once thought to be distinctive of the\r\nso-called Plutonic and volcanic rocks. No one familiar with recent\r\ngeological literature—even in Germany and France, where the old views\r\nconcerning the distinction of igneous products of different ages have\r\nbeen most stoutly maintained—can fail to recognise the fact that the\r\nprinciples contended for by Darwin bid fair at no distant period to win\r\nuniversal acceptance among geologists all over the globe.\r\n\r\nStill more important are the conclusions at which Darwin arrived with\r\nrespect to the origin of the schists and gneisses which cover so large\r\nan area in South America.\r\n\r\nCarefully noting, by the aid of his compass and clinometer, at every\r\npoint which he visited, the direction and amount of inclination of the\r\nparallel divisions in these rocks, he was led to a very important\r\ngeneralisation—namely, that over very wide areas the direction (strike)\r\nof the planes of cleavage in slates, and of foliation in schists and\r\ngneisses, remained constant, though the amount of their inclination\r\n(dip) often varied within wide limits. Further than this it appeared\r\nthat there was always a close correspondence between the strike of the\r\ncleavage and foliation and the direction of the great axes along which\r\nelevation had taken place in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, Darwin found striking evidence that the cleavage\r\nintersecting great masses of slate-rocks was quite independent of their\r\noriginal stratification, and could often, indeed, be seen cutting\r\nacross it at right angles. He was also able to verify Sedgwick’s\r\nobservation that, in some slates, glossy surfaces on the planes of\r\ncleavage arise from the development of new minerals, chlorite, epidote\r\nor mica, and that in this way a complete graduation from slates to true\r\nschists may be traced.\r\n\r\nDarwin further showed that in highly schistose rocks, the folia bend\r\naround and encircle any foreign bodies in the mass, and that in some\r\ncases they exhibit the most tortuous forms and complicated puckerings.\r\nHe clearly saw that in all cases the forces by which these striking\r\nphenomena must have been produced were persistent over wide areas, and\r\nwere connected with the great movements by which the rocks had been\r\nupheaved and folded.\r\n\r\nThat the distinct folia of quartz, feldspar, mica, and other minerals\r\ncomposing the metamorphic schists could not have been separately\r\ndeposited as sediment was strongly insisted upon by Darwin; and in\r\ndoing so he opposed the view generally prevalent among geologists at\r\nthat time. He was thus driven to the conclusion that foliation, like\r\ncleavage, is not an original, but a superinduced structure in\r\nrock-masses, and that it is the result of re-crystallisation, under the\r\ncontrolling influence of great pressure, of the materials of which the\r\nrock was composed.\r\n\r\nIn studying the lavas of Ascension, as we have already seen, Darwin was\r\nled to recognise the circumstance that, when igneous rocks are\r\nsubjected to great differential movements during the period of their\r\nconsolidation, they acquire a foliated structure, closely analogous to\r\nthat of the crystalline schists. Like his predecessor in this field of\r\ninquiry, Mr. Poulett Scrope, Charles Darwin seems to have been greatly\r\nimpressed by these facts, and he argued from them that the rocks\r\nexhibiting the foliated structure must have been in a state of\r\nplasticity, like that of a cooling mass of lava. At that time the\r\nsuggestive experiments of Tresca, Daubree, and others, showing that\r\nsolid masses under the influence of enormous pressure become actually\r\nplastic, had not been published. Had Darwin been aware of these facts\r\nhe would have seen that it was not necessary to assume a state of\r\nimperfect solidity in rock-masses in order to account for their having\r\nyielded to pressure and tension, and, in doing so, acquiring the new\r\ncharacters which distinguish the crystalline schists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe views put forward by Darwin on the origin of the crystalline\r\nschists found an able advocate in Mr. Daniel Sharpe, who in 1852 and\r\n1854 published two papers, dealing with the geology of the Scottish\r\nHighlands and of the Alps respectively, in which he showed that the\r\nprinciples arrived at by Darwin when studying the South American rocks\r\nafford a complete explanation of the structure of the two districts in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the conclusions of Darwin and Sharpe were met\r\nwith the strongest opposition by Sir Roderick Murchison and Dr. A.\r\nGeikie, who in 1861 read a paper before the Geological Society “On the\r\nCoincidence between Stratification and Foliation in the Crystalline\r\nRocks of the Scottish Highlands,” in which they insisted that their\r\nobservations in Scotland tended to entirely disprove the conclusions of\r\nDarwin that foliation in rocks is a secondary structure, and entirely\r\nindependent of the original stratification of the rock-masses.\r\n\r\nNow it is a most significant circumstance that, no sooner did the\r\nofficers of the Geological Survey commence the careful and detailed\r\nstudy of the Scottish Highlands than they found themselves compelled to\r\nmake a formal retraction of the views which had been put forward by\r\nMurchison and Geikie in opposition to the conclusions of Darwin. The\r\nofficers of the Geological Survey have completely abandoned the view\r\nthat the foliation of the Highland rocks has been determined by their\r\noriginal stratification, and admit that the structure is the result of\r\nthe profound movements to which the rocks have been subjected. The same\r\nconclusions have recently been supported by observations made in many\r\ndifferent districts—among which we may especially refer to those of Dr.\r\nH. Reusch in Norway, and those of Dr. J. Lehmann in Saxony. At the\r\npresent time the arguments so clearly stated by Darwin in the work\r\nbefore us, have, after enduring opposition or neglect for a whole\r\ngeneration, begun to “triumph all along the line,” and we may look\r\nforward confidently to the near future, when his claim to be regarded\r\nas one of the greatest of geological discoverers shall be fully\r\nvindicated.\r\n\r\nJOHN W. JUDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I ON THE ELEVATION OF THE EASTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpraised shells of La Plata.—Bahia Blanca, Sand-dunes and\r\nPumice-pebbles.—Step-formed plains of Patagonia, with upraised\r\nShells.—Terrace-bounded Valley of Santa Cruz, formerly a\r\nSea-strait.—Upraised shells of Tierra del Fuego.—Length and breadth of\r\nthe elevated area.—Equability of the movements, as shown by the similar\r\nheights of the plains.—Slowness of the elevatory process.—Mode of\r\nformation of the step-formed plains.—Summary.—Great Shingle Formation\r\nof Patagonia; its extent, origin, and distribution.—Formation of\r\nsea-cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn the following Volume, which treats of the geology of South America,\r\nand almost exclusively of the parts southward of the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn, I have arranged the chapters according to the age of the\r\ndeposits, occasionally departing from this order, for the sake of\r\ngeographical simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the land within the recent period, and the\r\nmodifications of its surface through the action of the sea (to which\r\nsubjects I paid particular attention) will be first discussed; I will\r\nthen pass on to the tertiary deposits, and afterwards to the older\r\nrocks. Only those districts and sections will be described in detail\r\nwhich appear to me to deserve some particular attention; and I will, at\r\nthe end of each chapter, give a summary of the results. We will\r\ncommence with the proofs of the upheaval of the eastern coast of the\r\ncontinent, from the Rio Plata southward; and, in the Second Chapter,\r\nfollow up the same subject along the shores of Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\nOn the northern bank of the great estuary of the Rio Plata, near\r\nMaldonado, I found at the head of a lake, sometimes brackish but\r\ngenerally containing fresh water, a bed of muddy clay, six feet in\r\nthickness, with numerous shells of species still existing in the Plata,\r\nnamely, the _Azara labiata_, d’Orbigny, fragments of _Mytilus\r\neduliformis_, d’Orbigny, _Paludestrina Isabellei_, d’Orbigny, and the\r\n_Solen Caribæus_, Lam., which last was embedded vertically in the\r\nposition in which it had lived. These shells lie at the height of only\r\ntwo feet above the lake, nor would they have been worth mentioning,\r\nexcept in connection with analogous facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Monte Video, I noticed near the town, and along the base of the\r\nmount, beds of a living Mytilus, raised some feet above the surface of\r\nthe Plata: in a similar bed, at a height from thirteen to sixteen feet,\r\nM. Isabelle collected eight species, which,[1] according to M.\r\nd’Orbigny, now live at the mouth of the estuary. At Colonia del\r\nSacramiento, further westward, I observed at the height of about\r\nfifteen feet above the river, there of quite fresh water, a small bed\r\nof the same Mytilus, which lives in brackish water at Monte Video. Near\r\nthe mouth of Uruguay, and for at least thirty-five miles northward,\r\nthere are at intervals large sandy tracts, extending several miles from\r\nthe banks of the river, but not raised much above its level, abounding\r\nwith small bivalves, which occur in such numbers that at the Agraciado\r\nthey are sifted and burnt for lime. Those which I examined near the A.\r\nS. Juan were much worn: they consisted of _Mactra Isabellei_,\r\nd’Orbigny, mingled with few of _Venus sinuosa_, Lam., both inhabiting,\r\nas I am informed by M. d’Orbigny, brackish water at the mouth of the\r\nPlata, nearly or quite as salt as the open sea. The loose sand, in\r\nwhich these shells are packed, is heaped into low, straight, long lines\r\nof dunes, like those left by the sea at the head of many bays. M.\r\nd’Orbigny has described[2] an analogous phenomenon on a greater scale,\r\nnear San Pedro on the river Parana, where he found widely extended beds\r\nand hillocks of sand, with vast numbers of the _Azara labiata_, at the\r\nheight of nearly 100 feet (English) above the surface of that river.\r\nThe Azara inhabits brackish water, and is not known to be found nearer\r\nto San Pedro than Buenos Ayres, distant above a hundred miles in a\r\nstraight line. Nearer Buenos Ayres, on the road from that place to San\r\nIsidro, there are extensive beds, as I am informed by Sir Woodbine\r\nParish,[3] of the _Azara labiata_, lying at about forty feet above the\r\nlevel of the river, and distant between two and three miles from it.\r\nThese shells are always found on the highest banks in the district:\r\nthey are embedded in a stratified earthy mass, precisely like that of\r\nthe great Pampean deposit hereafter to be described. In one collection\r\nof these shells, there were some valves of the _Venus sinuosa_, Lam.,\r\nthe same species found with the Mactra on the banks of the Uruguay.\r\nSouth of Buenos Ayres, near Ensenada, there are other beds of the\r\nAzara, some of which seem to have been embedded in yellowish,\r\ncalcareous, semi-crystalline matter; and Sir W. Parish has given me\r\nfrom the banks of the Arroyo del Tristan, situated in this same\r\nneighbourhood, at the distance of about a league from the Plata, a\r\nspecimen of a pale-reddish, calcereo-argillaceous stone (precisely like\r\nparts of the Pampean deposit the importance of which fact will be\r\nreferred to in a succeeding chapter), abounding with shells of an\r\nAzara, much worn, but which in general form and appearance closely\r\nresemble, and are probably identical with, the _A. labiata._ Besides\r\nthese shells, cellular, highly crystalline rock, formed of the casts of\r\nsmall bivalves, is found near Ensenada; and likewise beds of\r\nsea-shells, which from their appearance\r\nappear to have lain on the surface. Sir W. Parish has given me some of\r\nthese shells, and M. d’Orbigny pronounces them to be:—\r\n\r\nBuccinanops globulosum, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nOlivancillaria auricularia, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nVenus flexuosa, Lam.\r\n\r\nCytheræa (imperfect).\r\n\r\nMactra Isabellei, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nOstrea pulchella, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these, Sir W. Parish procured[4] (as named by Mr. G. B.\r\nSowerby) the following shells:—\r\n\r\nVoluta colocynthis.\r\n\r\nVoluta angulata.\r\n\r\nBuccinum (not spec.?).\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] “Voyage dans l’Amérique Mérid.: Part. Géolog.,” p. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] _Ibid._, p. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] “Buenos Ayres,” etc., by Sir Woodbine Parish, p. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] “Buenos Ayres,” etc., by Sir W. Parish, p. 168.\r\n\r\nAll these species (with, perhaps, the exception of the last) are\r\nrecent, and live on the South American coast. These shell-beds extend\r\nfrom one league to six leagues from the Plata, and must lie many feet\r\nabove its level. I heard, also, of beds of shells on the Somborombon,\r\nand on the Rio Salado, at which latter place, as M. d’Orbigny informs\r\nme, the _Mactra Isabellei_ and _Venus sinuosa_ are found.\r\n\r\nDuring the elevation of the Provinces of La Plata, the waters of the\r\nancient estuary have but little affected (with the exception of the\r\nsand-hills on the banks of the Parana and Uruguay) the outline of the\r\nland. M. Parchappe,[5] however, has described groups of sand dunes\r\nscattered over the wide extent of the Pampas southward of Buenos Ayres,\r\nwhich M. d’Orbigny attributes with much probability to the action of\r\nthe sea, before the plains were raised above its level.[6]\r\n\r\n [5] D’Orbigny’s “Voyage Géolog.,” p. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Before proceeding to the districts southward of La Plata, it may\r\n be worth while just to state, that there is some evidence that the\r\n coast of Brazil has participated in a small amount of elevation. Mr.\r\n Burchell informs me, that he collected at Santos (lat. 24° S.)\r\n oyster-shells, apparently recent, some miles from the shore, and quite\r\n above the tidal action. Westward of Rio de Janeiro, Captain Elliot is\r\n asserted (see Harlan, “Med. and Phys. Res.,” p. 35, and Dr. Meigs, in\r\n “Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc.”), to have found human bones, encrusted with\r\n sea-shells, between fifteen and twenty feet above the level of the\r\n sea. Between Rio de Janeiro and Cape Frio I crossed sandy tracts\r\n abounding with sea-shells, at a distance of a league from the coast;\r\n but whether these tracts have been formed by upheaval, or through the\r\n mere accumulation of drift sand, I am not prepared to assert. At Bahia\r\n (lat. 13° S.), in some parts near the coast, there are traces of\r\n sea-action at the height of about twenty feet above its present level;\r\n there are also, in many parts, remnants of beds of sandstone and\r\n conglomerate with numerous recent shells, raised a little above the\r\n sea-level. I may add, that at the head of Bahia Bay there is a\r\n formation, about forty feet in thickness, containing tertiary shells\r\n apparently of fresh-water origin, now washed by the sea and encrusted\r\n with Balini; this appears to indicate a small amount of subsidence\r\n subsequent to its deposition. At Pernambuco (lat. 8° S.), in the\r\n alluvial or tertiary cliffs, surrounding the low land on which the\r\n city stands, I looked in vain for organic remains, or other evidence\r\n of changes in level.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southward of the Plata._—The coast as far as Bahia Blanca (in lat. 39°\r\nS.) is formed either of a horizontal range of cliffs, or of immense\r\naccumulations of sand-dunes. Within Bahia Blanca, a small piece of\r\ntableland, about twenty feet above high-water mark, called Punta Alta,\r\nis formed of strata of cemented gravel and of red earthy mud, abounding\r\nwith shells (with others lying loose on the surface), and the bones of\r\nextinct mammifers. These shells, twenty in number, together with a\r\nBalanus and two corals, are all recent species, still inhabiting the\r\nneighbouring seas. They will be enumerated in the Fourth Chapter, when\r\ndescribing the Pampean formation; five of them are identical with the\r\nupraised ones from near Buenos Ayres. The northern shore of Bahia\r\nBlanca is, in main part, formed of immense sand-dunes, resting on\r\ngravel with recent shells, and ranging in lines parallel to the shore.\r\nThese ranges are separated from each other by flat spaces, composed of\r\nstiff impure red clay, in which, at the distance of about two miles\r\nfrom the coast, I found by digging a few minute fragments of\r\nsea-shells. The sand-dunes extend several miles inland, and stand on a\r\nplain, which slopes up to a height of between one hundred and two\r\nhundred feet. Numerous, small, well-rounded pebbles of pumice lie\r\nscattered both on the plain and sand-hillocks: at Monte Hermoso, on the\r\nflat summit of a cliff, I found many of them at a height of 120 feet\r\n(angular measurement) above the level of the sea. These pumice pebbles,\r\nno doubt, were originally brought down from the Cordillera by the\r\nrivers which cross the continent, in the same way as the river Negro\r\nanciently brought down, and still brings down, pumice, and as the river\r\nChupat brings down scoriæ: when once delivered at the mouth of a river,\r\nthey would naturally have travelled along the coasts, and been cast up\r\nduring the elevation of the land, at different heights. The origin of\r\nthe argillaceous flats, which separate the parallel ranges of\r\nsand-dunes, seems due to the tides here having a tendency (as I believe\r\nthey have on most shoal, protected coasts) to throw up a bar parallel\r\nto the shore, and at some distance from it; this bar gradually becomes\r\nlarger, affording a base for the accumulation of sand-dunes, and the\r\nshallow space within then becomes silted up with mud. The repetition of\r\nthis process, without any elevation of the land, would form a level\r\nplain traversed by parallel lines of sand-hillocks; during a slow\r\nelevation of the land, the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined\r\nsurface, like that on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. I did not\r\nobserve any shells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than\r\ntwenty feet; and therefore the age of the sea-drifted pebbles of\r\npumice, now standing at the height of 120 feet, must remain uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe main plain surrounding Bahia Blanca I estimated at from two hundred\r\nto three hundred feet; it insensibly rises towards the distant Sierra\r\nVentana. There are in this neighbourhood some other and lower plains,\r\nbut they do not abut one at the foot of the other, in the manner\r\nhereafter to be described, so characteristic of Patagonia. The plain on\r\nwhich the settlement stands is crossed by many low sand-dunes,\r\nabounding with the minute shells of the _ Paludestrina australis_,\r\nd’Orbigny, which now lives in the bay. This low plain is bounded to the\r\nsouth, at\r\nthe Cabeza del Buey, by the cliff-formed margin of a wide plain of the\r\nPampean formation, which I estimated at sixty feet in height. On the\r\nsummit of this cliff there is a range of high sand-dunes extending\r\nseveral miles in an east and west line.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Bahia Blanca, the river Colorado flows between two plains,\r\napparently from thirty to forty feet in height. Of these plains, the\r\nsouthern one slopes up to the foot of the great sandstone plateau of\r\nthe Rio Negro; and the northern one against an escarpment of the\r\nPampean deposit; so that the Colorado flows in a valley fifty miles in\r\nwidth, between the upper escarpments. I state this, because on the low\r\nplain at the foot of the northern escarpment, I crossed an immense\r\naccumulation of high sand-dunes, estimated by the Gauchos at no less\r\nthan eight miles in breadth. These dunes range westward from the coast,\r\nwhich is twenty miles distant, to far inland, in lines parallel to the\r\nvalley; they are separated from each other by argillaceous flats,\r\nprecisely like those on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. At present\r\nthere is no source whence this immense accumulation of sand could\r\nproceed; but if, as I believe, the upper escarpments once formed the\r\nshores of an estuary, in that case the sandstone formation of the river\r\nNegro would have afforded an inexhaustible supply of sand, which would\r\nnaturally have accumulated on the northern shore, as on every part of\r\nthe coast open to the south winds between Bahia Blanca and Buenos\r\nAyres.\r\n\r\nAt San Blas (40° 40′ S.) a little south of the mouth of the Colorado,\r\nM. d’Orbigny[7] found fourteen species of existing shells (six of them\r\nidentical with those from Bahia Blanca), embedded in their natural\r\npositions. From the zone of depth which these shells are known to\r\ninhabit, they must have been uplifted thirty-two feet. He also found,\r\nat from fifteen to twenty feet above this bed, the remains of an\r\nancient beach.\r\n\r\n [7] “Voyage,” etc., p. 54.\r\n\r\nTen miles southward, but 120 miles to the west, at Port S. Antonio, the\r\nOfficers employed on the Survey assured me that they saw many old\r\nsea-shells strewed on the surface of the ground, similar to those found\r\non other parts of the coast of Patagonia. At San Josef, ninety miles\r\nsouth in nearly the same longitude, I found, above the gravel, which\r\ncaps an old tertiary formation, an irregular bed and hillock of sand,\r\nseveral feet in thickness, abounding with shells of _Patella deaurita,\r\nMytilus Magellanicus,_ the latter retaining much of its colour; _Fusus\r\nMagellanicus_ (and a variety of the same), and a large Balanus\r\n(probably _B. Tulipa_), all now found on this coast: I estimated this\r\nbed at from eighty to one hundred feet above the level of the sea. To\r\nthe westward of this bay, there is a plain estimated at between two\r\nhundred and three hundred feet in height: this plain seems, from many\r\nmeasurements, to be a continuation of the sandstone platform of the\r\nriver Negro. The next place southward, where I landed, was at Port\r\nDesire, 340 miles distant; but from the intermediate districts I\r\nreceived, through the kindness of the Officers of the Survey,\r\nespecially from Lieutenant Stokes and Mr. King, many specimens and\r\nsketches, quite\r\nsufficient to show the general uniformity of the whole line of coast. I\r\nmay here state, that the whole of Patagonia consists of a tertiary\r\nformation, resting on and sometimes surrounding hills of porphyry and\r\nquartz: the surface is worn into many wide valleys and into level\r\nstep-formed plains, rising one above another, all capped by irregular\r\nbeds of gravel, chiefly composed of porphyritic rocks. This gravel\r\nformation will be separately described at the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the following diagrams:\r\nBaseline is Level of sea.\r\nScale is 1/20 of inch to 100 feet vertical.\r\n\r\nHeight is shown in feet thus:\r\nAn.

Round the\r\nsouthern parts of Nuevo Gulf, as far as the River Chupat (seventy miles\r\nsouthward of San Josef), there appear to be several plains, of which\r\nthe best defined are here represented.\r\n\r\nThe upper plain is here well defined (called Table Hills); its edge\r\nforms a cliff or line of escarpment many miles in length, projecting\r\nover a lower plain. The lowest plain corresponds with that at San Josef\r\nwith the recent shells on its surface. Between this lowest and the\r\nuppermost plain, there is probably more than one step-formed terrace:\r\nseveral measurements show the existence of the intermediate one of the\r\nheight given in diagram No. 1.\r\n\r\nNo. 2\r\nSection of plains in the Bay of St. George.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of plains in the Bay of St. George.]\r\n\r\nNear the north headland of the great Bay of St. George (100 miles south\r\nof the Chupat), two well-marked plains of 250 and 330 feet were\r\nmeasured: these are said to sweep round a great part of the Bay. At its\r\nsouth headland, 120 miles distant from the north headland, the 250 feet\r\nplain was again measured. In the middle of the bay, a higher plain was\r\nfound at two neighbouring places (Tilli Roads and C. Marques) to be 580\r\nfeet in height. Above this plain, towards the interior, Mr. Stokes\r\ninforms me that there were several other step-formed plains, the\r\nhighest of which was estimated at 1,200 feet, and was seen ranging at\r\napparently the same height for 150 miles northward. All these plains\r\nhave been worn into great valleys and much denuded. The section in\r\ndiagram No. 3 is illustrative of the general structure of the great Bay\r\nof St. George. At the south headland of the Bay of St. George (near C.\r\nThree Points) the 250 plain is very extensive. At Port Desire (forty\r\nmiles southward) I made several measurements with the barometer of a\r\nplain, which extends along the north side of the port and along the\r\nopen coast, and which varies from 245 to 255 feet in height: this plain\r\nabuts against the foot of a higher plain of 330 feet, which extends\r\nalso far northward along the coast, and likewise into the interior. In\r\nthe distance a higher inland platform was seen, of which I do not know\r\nthe height. In three separate places, I observed the cliff of the\r\n245-255 feet plain, fringed by a terrace or narrow plain estimated at\r\nabout one hundred feet in height. These plains are represented in the\r\nfollowing section:—\r\n\r\nNo. 3\r\nSection of plains at Port Desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of plains at Port Desire.]\r\n\r\nIn many places, even at the distance of three and four miles from the\r\ncoast, I found on the gravel-capped surface of the 245-255 feet, and of\r\nthe 330 feet plain, shells of _Mytilus Magellanicus, M. edulis, Patella\r\ndeaurita_, and another Patella, too much worn to be identified, but\r\napparently similar to one found abundantly adhering to the leaves of\r\nthe kelp. These species are the commonest now living on this coast. The\r\nshells all appeared very old; the blue of the mussels was much faded;\r\nand only traces of colour could be perceived in the Patellas, of which\r\nthe outer surfaces were scaling off. They lay scattered on the smooth\r\nsurface of the gravel, but abounded most in certain patches, especially\r\nat the heads of the smaller valleys: they generally contained sand in\r\ntheir insides; and I presume that they have been washed by alluvial\r\naction out of thin sandy layers, traces of which may sometimes be seen\r\ncovering the gravel. The several plains have very level surfaces; but\r\nall are scooped out by numerous broad, winding, flat-bottomed valleys,\r\nin which, judging from the bushes, streams never flow. These remarks on\r\nthe state of the shells, and on the\r\nnature of the plains, apply to the following cases, so need not be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Port Desire, the plains have been greatly denuded, with\r\nonly small pieces of tableland marking their former extension. But\r\nopposite Bird Island, two considerable step-formed plains were\r\nmeasured, and found respectively to be 350 and 590 feet in height. This\r\nlatter plain extends along the coast close to Port St. Julian (110\r\nmiles south of Port Desire); where we have the following section:—\r\n\r\nNo. 4\r\nSection of plains at Port St. Julian.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of plains at Port St. Julian.]\r\n\r\nThe lowest plain was estimated at ninety feet: it is remarkable from\r\nthe usual gravel-bed being deeply worn into hollows, which are filled\r\nup with, as well as the general surface covered by, sandy and reddish\r\nearthy matter: in one of the hollows thus filled up, the skeleton of\r\nthe Macrauchenia Patachonica, as will hereafter be described, was\r\nembedded. On the surface and in the upper parts of this earthy mass,\r\nthere were numerous shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and M. edulis,\r\nPatella deaurita, and fragments of other species. This plain is\r\ntolerably level, but not extensive; it forms a promontory seven or\r\neight miles long, and three or four wide. The upper plains in Diagram 4\r\nwere measured by the Officers of the Survey; they were all capped by\r\nthick beds of gravel, and were all more or less denuded; the 950 plain\r\nconsists merely of separate, truncated, gravel-capped hills, two of\r\nwhich, by measurement, were found to differ only three feet. The 430\r\nfeet plain extends, apparently with hardly a break, to near the\r\nnorthern entrance of the Rio Santa Cruz (fifty miles to the south); but\r\nit was there found to be only 330 feet in height.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of the mouth of the Santa Cruz we have Diagram 5,\r\nwhich I am able to give with more detail than in the foregoing cases:—\r\n\r\nNo. 5\r\nSection of plains at the mouth of the Rio Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of plains at the mouth of the Rio Santa Cruz.]\r\n\r\nThe plain marked 355 feet (as ascertained by the barometer and by\r\nangular measurement) is a continuation of the above-mentioned 330\r\nfeet plain: it extends in a N.W. direction along the southern shores of\r\nthe estuary. It is capped by gravel, which in most parts is covered by\r\na thin bed of sandy earth, and is scooped out by many flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys. It appears to the eye quite level, but in proceeding in a\r\nS.S.W. course, towards an escarpment distant about six miles, and\r\nlikewise ranging across the country in a N.W. line, it was found to\r\nrise at first insensibly, and then for the last half-mile, sensibly,\r\nclose up to the base of the escarpment: at this point it was 463 feet\r\nin height, showing a rise of 108 feet in the six miles. On this 355-463\r\nfeet plain, I found several shells of _Mytilus Magellanicus_ and of a\r\nMytilus, which Mr. Sowerby informs me is yet unnamed, though well-known\r\nas recent on this coast; _Patella deaurita_; _Fusus_, I believe, _\r\nMagellanicus_, but the specimen has been lost; and at the distance of\r\nfour miles from the coast, at the height of about four hundred feet,\r\nthere were fragments of the same Patella and of a Voluta (apparently\r\n_V. ancilla_) partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. All\r\nthese shells had the same ancient appearance with those from the\r\nforegoing localities. As the tides along this part of the coast rise at\r\nthe Syzygal period forty feet, and therefore form a well-marked\r\nbeach-line, I particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this\r\nplain, which, as we have seen, rises 108 feet in about six miles, but I\r\ncould not see any traces of such. The next highest plain is 710 feet\r\nabove the sea; it is very narrow, but level, and is capped with gravel;\r\nit abuts to the foot of the 840 feet plain. This summit-plain extends\r\nas far as the eye can range, both inland along the southern side of the\r\nvalley of the Santa Cruz, and southward along the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n_The Valley of the R. Santa Cruz._—This valley runs in an east and west\r\ndirection to the Cordillera, a distance of about one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles. It cuts through the great Patagonian tertiary formation,\r\nincluding, in the upper half of the valley, immense streams of basaltic\r\nlava, which as well as the softer beds, are capped by gravel; and this\r\ngravel, high up the river, is associated with a vast boulder\r\nformation.[8] In ascending the valley, the plain which at the mouth on\r\nthe southern side is 355 feet high, is seen to trend towards the\r\ncorresponding plain on the northern side, so that their escarpments\r\nappear like the shores of a former estuary, larger than the existing\r\none: the escarpments, also, of the 840 feet summit-plain (with a\r\ncorresponding northern one, which is met with some way up the valley),\r\nappear like the shores of a still larger estuary. Farther up the\r\nvalley, the sides are bounded throughout its entire length by level,\r\ngravel-capped terraces, rising above each other in steps. The width\r\nbetween the upper escarpments is on an average between seven and ten\r\nmiles; in one spot, however, where cutting through the basaltic lava,\r\nit was only one mile and a half. Between the escarpments of the second\r\nhighest terrace the average width is about four or five miles. The\r\nbottom of the valley, at the distance of 110 miles from its mouth,\r\nbegins sensibly\r\nto expand, and soon forms a considerable plain, 440 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, through which the river flows in a gut from twenty to\r\nforty feet in depth. I here found, at a point 140 miles from the\r\nAtlantic, and seventy miles from the nearest creek of the Pacific, at\r\nthe height of 410 feet, a very old and worn shell of _Patella\r\ndeaurita._ Lower down the valley, 105 miles from the Atlantic (long.\r\n71° W.), and at an elevation of about 300 feet, I also found, in the\r\nbed of the river, two much worn and broken shells of the _Voluta\r\nancilla_, still retaining traces of their colours; and one of the\r\n_Patella deaurita._ It appeared that these shells had been washed from\r\nthe banks into the river; considering the distance from the sea, the\r\ndesert and absolutely unfrequented character of the country, and the\r\nvery ancient appearance of the shells (exactly like those found on the\r\nplains nearer the coast), there is, I think, no cause to suspect that\r\nthey could have been brought here by Indians.\r\n\r\n [8] I have described this formation in a paper in the “Geological\r\n Transactions,” vol. vi, p. 415.\r\n\r\nThe plain at the head of the valley is tolerably level, but water-worn,\r\nand with many sand-dunes on it like those on a sea-coast. At the\r\nhighest point to which we ascended, it was sixteen miles wide in a\r\nnorth and south line; and forty-five miles in length in an east and\r\nwest line. It is bordered by the escarpments, one above the other, of\r\ntwo plains, which diverge as they approach the Cordillera, and\r\nconsequently resemble, at two levels, the shores of great bays facing\r\nthe mountains; and these mountains are breached in front of the lower\r\nplain by a remarkable gap. The valley, therefore, of the Santa Cruz\r\nconsists of a straight broad cut, about ninety miles in length,\r\nbordered by gravel-capped terraces and plains, the escarpments of which\r\nat both ends diverge or expand, one over the other, after the manner of\r\nthe shores of great bays. Bearing in mind this peculiar form of the\r\nland—the sand-dunes on the plain at the head of the valley—the gap in\r\nthe Cordillera, in front of it—the presence in two places of very\r\nancient shells of existing species—and lastly, the circumstance of the\r\n355-453 feet plain, with the numerous marine remains on its surface,\r\nsweeping from the Atlantic coast, far up the valley, I think we must\r\nadmit, that within the recent period, the course of the Santa Cruz\r\nformed a sea-strait intersecting the continent. At this period, the\r\nsouthern part of South America consisted of an archipelago of islands\r\n360 miles in a north and south line. We shall presently see, that two\r\nother straits also, since closed, then cut through Tierra del Fuego; I\r\nmay add, that one of them must at that time have expanded at the foot\r\nof the Cordillera into a great bay (now Otway Water) like that which\r\nformerly covered the 440 feet plain at the head of the Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nI have said that the valley in its whole course is bordered by\r\ngravel-capped plains. The section (diagram No. 6), supposed to be drawn\r\nin a north and south line across the valley, can scarcely be considered\r\nas more than illustrative; for during our hurried ascent it was\r\nimpossible to measure all the plains at any one place. At a point\r\nnearly midway between the Cordillera and the Atlantic, I found the\r\nplain (A north) 1,122 feet above the river; all the lower plains on\r\nthis side were here united into one great broken cliff: at a point\r\nsixteen miles lower down\r\nthe stream, I found by measurement and estimation that B (_n_) was 869\r\nabove the river: very near to where A (_n_) was measured, C (_n_) was\r\n639 above the same level: the terrace D (_n_) was nowhere measured: the\r\nlowest E (_n_) was in many places about twenty feet above the river.\r\nThese plains or terraces were best developed where the valley was\r\nwidest; the whole five, like gigantic steps, occurred together only at\r\na few points. The lower terraces are less continuous than the higher\r\nones, and appear to be entirely lost in the upper third of the valley.\r\nTerrace C (_s_), however was traced continuously for a great distance.\r\nThe terrace B (_n_), at a point fifty-five miles from the mouth of the\r\nriver, was four miles in width; higher up the valley this terrace (or\r\nat least the second highest one, for I could not always trace it\r\ncontinuously) was about eight miles wide. This second plain was\r\ngenerally wider than the lower ones—as indeed follows from the valley\r\nfrom A (_n_) to A (_s_) being generally nearly double the width of from\r\nB (_n_) to B (_s_).\r\n\r\nNo. 6\r\nNorth and South Section across the terraces bounding the valley of the\r\nRiver Santa Cruz, high up its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North and South Section across the terraces bounding the\r\nRiver Santa Cruz.]\r\n\r\nLow down the valley, the summit-plain A (_s_) is continuous with the\r\n840 feet plain on the coast, but it is soon lost or unites with the\r\nescarpment of B (_s_). The corresponding plain A (_n_), on the north\r\nside of the valley, appears to range continuously from the Cordillera\r\nto the head of the present estuary of the Santa Cruz, where it trends\r\nnorthward towards Port St. Julian. Near the Cordillera the summit-plain\r\non both sides of the valley is between 3,200 and 3,300 feet in height;\r\nat 100 miles from the Atlantic, it is 1,416 feet, and on the coast 840\r\nfeet, all above the sea-beach; so that in a distance of 100 miles the\r\nplain rises 576 feet, and much more rapidly near to the Cordillera. The\r\nlower terraces B and C also appear to rise as they run up the valley;\r\nthus D (_n_), measured at two points twenty-four miles apart, was found\r\nto have risen 185 feet. From several reasons I suspect, that this\r\ngradual inclination of the plains up the valley, has been chiefly\r\ncaused by the elevation of the continent in mass, having been the\r\ngreater the nearer to the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nAll the terraces are capped with well-rounded gravel, which rests\r\neither on the denuded and sometimes furrowed surface of the soft\r\ntertiary deposits, or on the basaltic lava. The difference in height\r\nbetween some of the lower steps or terraces seems to be entirely owing\r\nto a difference in the thickness of the capping gravel. Furrows and\r\ninequalities in the gravel, where such occur, are filled up and\r\nsmoothed over with sandy earth. The pebbles, especially on the higher\r\nplains, are often whitewashed, and even cemented together by a white\r\naluminous substance, and I occasionally found this to be the case with\r\nthe gravel on the terrace D. I could not perceive any trace of a\r\nsimilar deposition on the pebbles now thrown up by the river, and\r\ntherefore I do not think that terrace D was river-formed. As the\r\nterrace E generally stands about twenty feet above the bed of the\r\nriver, my first impression was to doubt whether even this lowest one\r\ncould have been so formed; but it should always be borne in mind, that\r\nthe horizontal upheaval of a district, by increasing the total descent\r\nof the streams, will always tend to increase, first near the sea-coast\r\nand then further and further up the valley, their corroding and\r\ndeepening powers: so that an alluvial plain, formed almost on a level\r\nwith a stream, will, after an elevation of this kind, in time be cut\r\nthrough, and left standing at a height never again to be reached by the\r\nwater. With respect to the three upper terraces of the Santa Cruz, I\r\nthink there can be no doubt, that they were modelled by the sea, when\r\nthe valley was occupied by a strait, in the same manner (hereafter to\r\nbe discussed) as the greater step-formed, shell-strewed plains along\r\nthe coast of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nTo return to the shores of the Atlantic: the 840 feet plain, at the\r\nmouth of the Santa Cruz, is seen extending horizontally far to the\r\nsouth; and I am informed by the Officers of the Survey, that bending\r\nround the head of Coy Inlet (sixty-five miles southward), it trends\r\ninland. Outliers of apparently the same height are seen forty miles\r\nfarther south, inland of the river Gallegos; and a plain comes down to\r\nCape Gregory (thirty-five miles southward), in the Strait of Magellan,\r\nwhich was estimated at between eight hundred and one thousand feet in\r\nheight, and which, rising towards the interior, is capped by the\r\nboulder formation. South of the Strait of Magellan, there are large\r\noutlying masses of apparently the same great tableland, extending at\r\nintervals along the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego: at two places\r\nhere, 110 miles a part, this plain was found to be 950 and 970 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nFrom Coy Inlet, where the high summit-plain trends inland, a plain\r\nestimated at 350 feet in height, extends for forty miles to the river\r\nGallegos. From this point to the Strait of Magellan, and on each side\r\nof that Strait, the country has been much denuded and is less level. It\r\nconsists chiefly of the boulder formation, which rises to a height of\r\nbetween one hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty feet, and is\r\noften capped by beds of gravel. At N.S. Gracia, on the north side of\r\nthe Inner Narrows of the Strait of Magellan, I found on the summit of a\r\ncliff, 160 feet in height, shells of existing Patellæ and Mytili,\r\nscattered on the surface and partially embedded in earth. On the\r\neastern coast, also, of Tierra del Fuego, in latitude 53° 20′ south, I\r\nfound many Mytili on some level land, estimated at 200 feet in height.\r\nAnterior to the elevation attested by these shells, it is evident by\r\nthe present form of the land, and by the distribution of the great\r\nerratic boulders[9] on the surface, that two sea-channels connected the\r\nStrait of Magellan both with Sebastian Bay and with Otway Water.\r\n\r\n [9] “Geolog. Transactions,” vol. vi, p. 419.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on the recent elevation of the south-eastern coasts\r\nof America, and on the action of the sea on the land._—Upraised shells\r\nof species, still existing as the commonest kinds in the adjoining sea,\r\noccur, as we have seen, at heights of between a few feet and 410 feet,\r\nat intervals from latitude 33° 40′ to 53° 20′ south. This is a distance\r\nof 1,180 geographical miles—about equal from London to the North Cape\r\nof Sweden. As the boulder formation extends with nearly the same height\r\n150 miles south of 53° 20′, the most southern point where I landed and\r\nfound upraised shells; and as the level Pampas ranges many hundred\r\nmiles northward of the point, where M. d’Orbigny found at the height of\r\n100 feet beds of the Azara, the space in a north and south line, which\r\nhas been uplifted within the recent period, must have been much above\r\nthe 1,180 miles. By the term “recent,” I refer only to that period\r\nwithin which the now living mollusca were called into existence; for it\r\nwill be seen in the Fourth Chapter, that both at Bahia Blanca and P. S.\r\nJulian, the mammiferous quadrupeds which co-existed with these shells\r\nbelong to extinct species. I have said that the upraised shells were\r\nfound only at intervals on this line of coast, but this in all\r\nprobability may be attributed to my not having landed at the\r\nintermediate points; for wherever I did land, with the exception of the\r\nriver Negro, shells were found: moreover, the shells are strewed on\r\nplains or terraces, which, as we shall immediately see, extend for\r\ngreat distances with a uniform height. I ascended the higher plains\r\nonly in a few places, owing to the distance at which their escarpments\r\ngenerally range from the coast, so that I am far from knowing that 410\r\nfeet is the maximum of elevation of these upraised remains. The shells\r\nare those now most abundant in a living state in the adjoining sea.[10]\r\nAll of them have an ancient appearance; but some, especially the\r\nmussels, although lying fully exposed to the weather, retain to a\r\nconsiderable extent their colours: this circumstance appears at first\r\nsurprising, but it is now known that the colouring principle of the\r\nMytilus is so enduring, that it is preserved when the shell itself is\r\ncompletely disintegrated.[11] Most of the shells are broken; I nowhere\r\nfound two valves united; the fragments are not rounded, at least in\r\nnone of the specimens which I brought home.\r\n\r\n [10] Captain King, “Voyages of _Adventure_ and _Beagle_,” vol. i, 1\r\n pp. 6 and 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] See Mr. Lyell “Proofs of a Gradual Rising in Sweden,” in the\r\n “Philosoph. Transact.,” 1835, p. 1. See also Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill\r\n in the _Edin. New Phil. Journal_, vol. xxv, p. 393.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the breadth of the upraised area in an east and west\r\nline, we know from the shells found at the Inner Narrows of the\r\nStrait of Magellan, that the entire width of the plain, although there\r\nvery narrow, has been elevated. It is probable that in this\r\nsouthernmost part of the continent, the movement has extended under the\r\nsea far eastward; for at the Falkland Islands, though I could not find\r\nany shells, the bones of whales have been noticed by several competent\r\nobservers, lying on the land at a considerable distance from the sea,\r\nand at the height of some hundred feet above it.[12] Moreover, we know\r\nthat in Tierra del Fuego the boulder formation has been uplifted within\r\nthe recent period, and a similar formation occurs[13] on the\r\nnorth-western shores (Byron Sound) of these islands. The distance from\r\nthis point to the Cordillera of Tierra del Fuego, is 360 miles, which\r\nwe may take as the probable width of the recently upraised area. In the\r\nlatitude of the R. Santa Cruz, we know from the shells found at the\r\nmouth and head, and in the middle of the valley, that the entire width\r\n(about 160 miles) of the surface eastward of the Cordillera has been\r\nupraised. From the slope of the plains, as shown by the course of the\r\nrivers, for several degrees northward of the Santa Cruz, it is probable\r\nthat the elevation attested by the shells on the coast has likewise\r\nextended to the Cordillera. When, however, we look as far northward as\r\nthe provinces of La Plata, this conclusion would be very hazardous; not\r\nonly is the distance from Maldonado (where I found upraised shells) to\r\nthe Cordillera great, namely, 760 miles, but at the head of the estuary\r\nof the Plata, a N.N.E. and S.S.W. range of tertiary volcanic rocks has\r\nbeen observed,[14] which may well indicate an axis of elevation quite\r\ndistinct from that of the Andes. Moreover, in the centre of the Pampas\r\nin the chain of Cordova, severe earthquakes have been felt;[15] whereas\r\nat Mendoza, at the eastern foot of the Cordillera, only gentle\r\noscillations, transmitted from the shores of the Pacific, have ever\r\nbeen experienced. Hence the elevation of the Pampas may be due to\r\nseveral distinct axes of movement; and we cannot judge, from the\r\nupraised shells round the estuary of the Plata, of the breadth of the\r\narea uplifted within the recent period.\r\n\r\n [12] “Voyages of the _Adventure_ and _ Beagle_,” vol. ii, p. 227. And\r\n Bougainville’s “Voyage,” tome i, p. 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] I owe this fact to the kindness of Captain Sulivan, R.N., a\r\n highly competent observer. I mention it more especially, as in my\r\n Paper (p. 427) on the Boulder Formation, I have, after having examined\r\n the northern and middle parts of the eastern island, said that the\r\n formation was here wholly absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] This volcanic formation will be described in Chapter IV. It is\r\n not improbable that the height of the upraised shells at the head of\r\n the estuary of the Plata, being greater than at Bahia Blanca or at San\r\n Blas, may be owing to the upheaval of these latter places having been\r\n connected with the distant line of the Cordillera, whilst that of the\r\n provinces of La Plata was in connection with the adjoining tertiary\r\n volcanic axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] See Sir W. Parish’s work on “La Plata,” p. 242. For a notice of\r\n an earthquake which drained a lake near Cordova, see also Temple’s\r\n “Travels in Peru.” Sir W. Parish informs me, that a town between Salta\r\n and Tucuman (north of Cordova) was formerly utterly overthrown by an\r\n earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only has the above specified long range of coast been elevated\r\nwithin the recent period, but I think it may be safely inferred from\r\nthe similarity in height of the gravel-capped plains at distant points,\r\nthat there has been a remarkable degree of equability in the elevatory\r\nprocess. I may premise, that when I measured the plains, it was simply\r\nto ascertain the heights at which shells occurred; afterwards,\r\ncomparing these measurements with some of those made during the Survey,\r\nI was struck with their uniformity, and accordingly tabulated all those\r\nwhich represented the summit-edges of plains. The extension of the 330\r\nto 355 feet plain is very striking, being found over a space of 500\r\ngeographical miles in a north and south line. A table (Table 1) of the\r\nmeasurements is given below. The angular measurements and all the\r\nestimations (in feet) are by the Officers of the Survey; the\r\nbarometrical ones by myself:—\r\n\r\n \tFeet Gallegos River to Coy Inlet (partly angular partly\r\n \testimation)\t350 South Side of Santa Cruz (angular and\r\n \tbarometric)\t355 North Side of Santa Cruz (angular and\r\n \tbarometric)\t330 Bird Island, plain opposite to (angular)\t350\r\n \tPort Desire, plain extending far along coast (barometric)\t330\r\n \tSt. George’s Bay, north promontory (angular)\t330 Table Land,\r\n \tsouth of New Bay (angular)\t350\r\n\r\nA plain, varying from 245 to 255 feet, seems to extend with much\r\nuniformity from Port Desire to the north of St. George’s Bay, a\r\ndistance of 170 miles; and some approximate measurements (in feet),\r\nalso given in the table below, indicate the much greater extension of\r\n780 miles:—\r\n\r\n \tFeet Coy Inlet, south of (partly angular and partly\r\n \testimation)\t200 to 300 Port Desire (barometric)\t245 to 255\r\n \tC. Blanco (angular)\t250 North Promontory of St. George’s Bay\r\n \t(angular)\t250 South of New Bay (angular)\t200 to 220 North of\r\n \tS. Josef (estimation)\t200 to 300 Plain of Rio Negro\r\n \t(angular)\t200 to 220 Bahia Blanca (estimation)\t200 to 300\r\n\r\nThe extension, moreover, of the 560 to 580, and of the 80 to 100 feet,\r\nplains is remarkable, though somewhat less obvious than in the former\r\ncases. Bearing in mind that I have not picked these measurements out of\r\na series, but have used all those which represented the edges of\r\nplains, I think it scarcely possible that these coincidences in height\r\nshould be accidental. We must therefore conclude that the action,\r\nwhatever it may have been, by which these plains have been modelled\r\ninto their present forms, has been singularly uniform.\r\n\r\nThese plains or great terraces, of which three and four often rise like\r\nsteps one behind the other, are formed by the denudation of the old\r\nPatagonian tertiary beds, and by the deposition on their surfaces of a\r\nmass of well-rounded gravel, varying, near the coast, from ten to\r\nthirty-five\r\nfeet in thickness, but increasing in thickness towards the interior.\r\nThe gravel is often capped by a thin irregular bed of sandy earth. The\r\nplains slope up, though seldom sensibly to the eye, from the summit\r\nedge of one escarpment to the foot of the next highest one. Within a\r\ndistance of 150 miles, between Santa Cruz to Port Desire, where the\r\nplains are particularly well developed, there are at least seven stages\r\nor steps, one above the other. On the three lower ones, namely, those\r\nof 100 feet, 250 feet, and 350 feet in height, existing littoral shells\r\nare abundantly strewed, either on the surface, or partially embedded in\r\nthe superficial sandy earth. By whatever action these three lower\r\nplains have been modelled, so undoubtedly have all the higher ones, up\r\nto a height of 950 feet at S. Julian, and of 1,200 feet (by estimation)\r\nalong St. George’s Bay. I think it will not be disputed, considering\r\nthe presence of the upraised marine shells, that the sea has been the\r\nactive power during stages of some kind in the elevatory process.\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly consider this subject: if we look at the existing\r\ncoast-line, the evidence of the great denuding power of the sea is very\r\ndistinct; for, from Cape St. Diego, in lat. 54° 30′ to the mouth of the\r\nRio Negro, in lat. 31° (a length of more than eight hundred miles), the\r\nshore is formed, with singularly few exceptions, of bold and naked\r\ncliffs: in many places the cliffs are high; thus, south of the Santa\r\nCruz, they are between eight and nine hundred feet in height, with\r\ntheir horizontal strata abruptly cut off, showing the immense mass of\r\nmatter which has been removed. Nearly this whole line of coast consists\r\nof a series of greater or lesser curves, the horns of which, and\r\nlikewise certain straight projecting portions, are formed of hard\r\nrocks; hence the concave parts are evidently the effect and the measure\r\nof the denuding action on the softer strata. At the foot of all the\r\ncliffs, the sea shoals very gradually far outwards; and the bottom, for\r\na space of some miles, everywhere consists of gravel. I carefully\r\nexamined the bed of the sea off the Santa Cruz, and found that its\r\ninclination was exactly the same, both in amount and in its peculiar\r\ncurvature, with that of the 355 feet plain at this same place. If,\r\ntherefore, the coast, with the bed of the adjoining sea, were now\r\nsuddenly elevated one or two hundred feet, an inland line of cliffs,\r\nthat is an escarpment, would be formed, with a gravel-capped plain at\r\nits foot gently sloping to the sea, and having an inclination like that\r\nof the existing 355 feet plain. From the denuding tendency of the sea,\r\nthis newly formed plain would in time be eaten back into a cliff: and\r\nrepetitions of this elevatory and denuding process would produce a\r\nseries of gravel-capped sloping terraces, rising one above another,\r\nlike those fronting the shores of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty (for there are other inconsiderable ones) on this\r\nview, is the fact,—as far as I can trust two continuous lines of\r\nsoundings carefully taken between Santa Cruz and the Falkland Islands,\r\nand several scattered observations on this and other coasts,—that the\r\npebbles at the bottom of the sea _quickly_ and _regularly_ decrease in\r\nsize with the increasing depth and distance from the shore, whereas in\r\nthe gravel on the sloping plains, no such decrease in size was\r\nperceptible.\r\nThe following table gives the average result of many soundings off the\r\nSanta Cruz:—\r\n\r\nUnder two miles from the shore, many of the pebbles were of large size,\r\nmingled with some small ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistance in miles from shore\tDepth in fathoms\tSize of Pebbles 3\r\nto 4\t11 to 12\tAs large as walnuts; mingled in every case with\r\nsome smaller ones. 6 to 7\t17 to 19\tAs large as hazel-nuts. 10 to\r\n11\t23 to 25\tFrom three- to four-tenths of an inch in diameter.\r\n12\t30 to 40\tTwo-tenths of an inch. 22 to 150\t45 to\r\n65\tOne-tenth of an inch, to the finest sand.\r\n\r\nI particularly attended to the size of the pebbles on the 355 feet\r\nSanta Cruz plain, and I noticed that on the summit-edge of the present\r\nsea cliffs many were as large as half a man’s head; and in crossing\r\nfrom these cliffs to the foot of the next highest escarpment, a\r\ndistance of six miles, I could not observe any increase in their size.\r\nWe shall presently see that the theory of a slow and almost insensible\r\nrise of the land, will explain all the facts connected with the\r\ngravel-capped terraces, better than the theory of sudden elevations of\r\nfrom one to two hundred feet.\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny has argued, from the upraised shells at San Blas being\r\nembedded in the positions in which they lived, and from the valves of\r\nthe _Azara labiata_ high on the banks of the Parana being united and\r\nunrolled, that the elevation of Northern Patagonia and of La Plata must\r\nhave been sudden; for he thinks, if it had been gradual, these shells\r\nwould all have been rolled on successive beach-lines. But in\r\n_protected_ bays, such as in that of Bahia Blanca, wherever the sea is\r\naccumulating extensive mud-banks, or where the winds quietly heap up\r\nsand-dunes, beds of shells might assuredly be preserved buried in the\r\npositions in which they had lived, even whilst the land retained the\r\nsame level; any, the smallest, amount of elevation would directly aid\r\nin their preservation. I saw a multitude of spots in Bahia Blanca where\r\nthis might have been effected; and at Maldonado it almost certainly has\r\nbeen effected. In speaking of the elevation of the land having been\r\nslow, I do not wish to exclude the small starts which accompany\r\nearthquakes, as on the coast of Chile; and by such movements beds of\r\nshells might easily be uplifted, even in positions exposed to a heavy\r\nsurf, without undergoing any attrition: for instance, in 1835, a rocky\r\nflat off the island of Santa Maria was at one blow upheaved above\r\nhigh-water mark, and was left covered with gaping and putrefying\r\nmussel-shells, still attached to the bed on which they had lived. If M.\r\nd’Orbigny had been aware of the many long parallel lines of\r\nsand-hillocks, with infinitely numerous shells of the Mactra and Venus,\r\nat\r\na low level near the Uruguay; if he had seen at Bahia Blanca the\r\nimmense sand-dunes, with water-worn pebbles of pumice, ranging in\r\nparallel lines, one behind the other, up a height of at least 120 feet;\r\nif he had seen the sand-dunes, with the countless Paludestrinas, on the\r\nlow plain near the Fort at this place, and that long line on the edge\r\nof the cliff, sixty feet higher up; if he had crossed that long and\r\ngreat belt of parallel sand-dunes, eight miles in width, standing at\r\nthe height of from forty to fifty feet above the Colorado, where sand\r\ncould not now collect,—I cannot believe he would have thought that the\r\nelevation of this great district had been sudden. Certainly the\r\nsand-dunes (especially when abounding with shells), which stand in\r\nranges at so many different levels, must all have required long time\r\nfor their accumulation; and hence I do not doubt that the last 100 feet\r\nof elevation of La Plata and Northern Patagonia has been exceedingly\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nIf we extend this conclusion to Central and Southern Patagonia, the\r\ninclination of the successively rising gravel-capped plains can be\r\nexplained quite as well, as by the more obvious view already given of a\r\nfew comparatively great and sudden elevations; in either case we must\r\nadmit long periods of rest, during which the sea ate deeply into the\r\nland. Let us suppose the present coast to rise at a nearly equable,\r\nslow rate, yet sufficiently quick to prevent the waves quite removing\r\neach part as soon as brought up; in this case every portion of the\r\npresent bed of the sea will successively form a beach-line, and from\r\nbeing exposed to a like action will be similarly affected. It cannot\r\nmatter to what height the tides rise, even if to forty feet as at Santa\r\nCruz, for they will act with equal force and in like manner on each\r\nsuccessive line. Hence there is no difficulty in the fact of the 355\r\nfeet plain at Santa Cruz sloping up 108 feet to the foot of the next\r\nhighest escarpment, and yet having no marks of any one particular\r\nbeach-line on it; for the whole surface on this view has been a beach.\r\nI cannot pretend to follow out the precise action of the tidal-waves\r\nduring a rise of the land, slow, yet sufficiently quick to prevent or\r\ncheck denudation: but if it be analogous to what takes place on\r\nprotected parts of the present coast, where gravel is now accumulating\r\nin large quantities,[16] an inclined surface, thickly capped by\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of about the same size, would be ultimately left.\r\nOn the gravel now accumulating, the waves, aided by the wind, sometimes\r\nthrow up a thin covering of sand, together with the common\r\ncoast-shells. Shells thus cast up by gales, would, during an elevatory\r\nperiod, never again be touched by the sea. Hence, on this view of a\r\nslow and gradual rising of the land, interrupted by periods of rest and\r\ndenudation, we can understand the pebbles being of about the same size\r\nover the entire width of the step-like plains,—the occasional thin\r\ncovering of sandy earth,—and the presence of broken, unrolled fragments\r\nof those shells, which now live exclusively near the coast.\r\n\r\n [16] On the eastern side of Chiloe, which island we shall see in the\r\n next chapter is now rising, I observed that all the beaches and\r\n extensive tidal-flats were formed of shingle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of results._—It may be concluded that the coast on this side\r\nof the continent, for a space of at least 1,180 miles, has been\r\nelevated to a height of 100 feet in La Plata, and of 400 feet in\r\nSouthern Patagonia, within the period of existing shells, but not of\r\nexisting mammifers. That in La Plata the elevation has been very slowly\r\neffected: that in Patagonia the movement may have been by considerable\r\nstarts, but much more probably slow and quiet. In either case, there\r\nhave been long intervening periods of comparative rest,[17] during\r\nwhich the sea corroded deeply, as it is still corroding, into the land.\r\nThat the periods of denudation and elevation were contemporaneous and\r\nequable over great spaces of coast, as shown by the equable heights of\r\nthe plains; that there have been at least eight periods of denudation,\r\nand that the land, up to a height of from 950 to 1,200 feet, has been\r\nsimilarly modelled and affected: that the area elevated, in the\r\nsouthernmost part of the continent, extended in breadth to the\r\nCordillera, and probably seaward to the Falkland Islands; that\r\nnorthward, in La Plata, the breadth is unknown, there having been\r\nprobably more than one axis of elevation; and finally, that, anterior\r\nto the elevation attested by these upraised shells, the land was\r\ndivided by a Strait where the River Santa Cruz now flows, and that\r\nfurther southward there were other sea-straits, since closed. I may\r\nadd, that at Santa Cruz, in lat. 50° S., the plains have been uplifted\r\nat least 1,400 feet, since the period when gigantic boulders were\r\ntransported between sixty and seventy miles from their parent rock, on\r\nfloating icebergs.\r\n\r\n [17] I say _comparative_ and not _ absolute_ rest, because the sea\r\n acts, as we have seen, with great denuding power on this whole line of\r\n coast; and therefore, during an elevation of the land, if excessively\r\n slow (and of course during a subsidence of the land), it is quite\r\n possible that lines of cliff might be formed.)\r\n\r\nLastly, considering the great upward movements which this long line of\r\ncoast has undergone, and the proximity of its southern half to the\r\nvolcanic axis of the Cordillera, it is highly remarkable that in the\r\nmany fine sections exposed in the Pampean, Patagonian tertiary, and\r\nBoulder formations, I nowhere observed the smallest fault or abrupt\r\ncurvature in the strata.\r\n\r\n_Gravel Formation of Patagonia._\r\n\r\nI will here describe in more detail than has been as yet incidentally\r\ndone, the nature, origin, and extent of the great shingle covering of\r\nPatagonia: but I do not mean to affirm that all of this shingle,\r\nespecially that on the higher plains, belongs to the recent period. A\r\nthin bed of sandy earth, with small pebbles of various porphyries and\r\nof quartz, covering a low plain on the north side of the Rio Colorado,\r\nis the extreme northern limit of this formation. These little pebbles\r\nhave probably been derived from the denudation of a more regular bed of\r\ngravel, capping the old tertiary sandstone plateau of the Rio Negro.\r\nThe gravel-bed near the Rio Negro is, on an average, about ten or\r\ntwelve feet in thickness; and the pebbles are larger than on the\r\nnorthern side of the Colorado, being from one or two inches in\r\ndiameter, and composed chiefly of rather dark-tinted porphyries.\r\nAmongst them I here first noticed a variety often to be referred to,\r\nnamely, a peculiar gallstone-yellow siliceous porphyry, frequently, but\r\nnot invariably, containing grains of quartz. The pebbles are embedded\r\nin a white, gritty, calcareous matrix, very like mortar, sometimes\r\nmerely coating with a whitewash the separate stones, and sometimes\r\nforming the greater part of the mass. In one place I saw in the gravel\r\nconcretionary nodules (not rounded) of crystallised gypsum, some as\r\nlarge as a man’s head. I traced this bed for forty-five miles inland,\r\nand was assured that it extended far into the interior. As the surface\r\nof the calcareo-argillaceous plain of Pampean formation, on the\r\nnorthern side of the wide valley of the Colorado, stands at about the\r\nsame height with the mortar-like cemented gravel capping the sandstone\r\non the southern side, it is probable, considering the apparent\r\nequability of the subterranean movements along this side of America,\r\nthat this gravel of the Rio Negro and the upper beds of the Pampean\r\nformation northward of the Colorado, are of nearly contemporaneous\r\norigin, and that the calcareous matter has been derived from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Rio Negro, the cliffs along the great bay of S.\r\nAntonio are capped with gravel: at San Josef, I found that the pebbles\r\nclosely resembled those on the plain of the Rio Negro, but that they\r\nwere not cemented by calcareous matter. Between San Josef and Port\r\nDesire, I was assured by the Officers of the Survey that the whole face\r\nof the country is coated with gravel. At Port Desire and over a space\r\nof twenty-five miles inland, on the three step-formed plains and in the\r\nvalleys, I everywhere passed over gravel which, where thickest, was\r\nbetween thirty and forty feet. Here, as in other parts of Patagonia,\r\nthe gravel, or its sandy covering, was, as we have seen, often strewed\r\nwith recent marine shells. The sandy covering sometimes fills up\r\nfurrows in the gravel, as does the gravel in the underlying tertiary\r\nformations. The pebbles are frequently whitewashed and even cemented\r\ntogether by a peculiar, white, friable, aluminous, fusible substance,\r\nwhich I believe is decomposed feldspar. At Port Desire, the gravel\r\nrested sometimes on the basal formation of porphyry, and sometimes on\r\nthe upper or the lower denuded tertiary strata. It is remarkable that\r\nmost of the porphyritic pebbles differ from those varieties of porphyry\r\nwhich occur here abundantly _in situ._ The peculiar gallstone-yellow\r\nvariety was common, but less numerous than at Port S. Julian, where it\r\nformed nearly one-third of the mass of the gravel; the remaining part\r\nthere consisting of pale grey and greenish porphyries with many\r\ncrystals of feldspar. At Port S. Julian, I ascended one of the\r\nflat-topped hills, the denuded remnant of the highest plain, and found\r\nit, at the height of 950 feet, capped with the usual bed of gravel.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Santa Cruz, the bed of gravel on the 355 feet\r\nplain is from twenty to about thirty-five feet in thickness. The\r\npebbles vary from minute ones to the size of a hen’s egg, and even to\r\nthat of half a man’s head; they consist of paler varieties of porphyry\r\nthan those found further northward, and there are fewer of the\r\ngallstone-yellow kind; pebbles of compact black clay-slate were here\r\nfirst observed. The gravel, as we have seen, covers the step-formed\r\nplains at the mouth, head, and on the sides of the great valley of the\r\nSanta Cruz. At a distance of 110 miles from the coast, the plain has\r\nrisen to the height of 1,416 feet above the sea; and the gravel, with\r\nthe associated great boulder formation, has attained a thickness of 212\r\nfeet. The plain, apparently with its usual gravel covering, slopes up\r\nto the foot of the Cordillera to the height of between 3,200 and 3,300\r\nfeet. In ascending the valley, the gravel gradually becomes entirely\r\naltered in character: high up, we have pebbles of crystalline\r\nfeldspathic rocks, compact clay-slate, quartzose schists, and\r\npale-coloured porphyries; these rocks, judging both from the gigantic\r\nboulders in the surface and from some small pebbles embedded beneath\r\n700 feet in thickness of the old tertiary strata, are the prevailing\r\nkinds in this part of the Cordillera; pebbles of basalt from the\r\nneighbouring streams of basaltic lava are also numerous; there are few\r\nor none of the reddish or of the gallstone-yellow porphyries so common\r\nnear the coast. Hence the pebbles on the 350 feet plain at the mouth of\r\nthe Santa Cruz cannot have been derived (with the exception of those of\r\ncompact clay-slate, which, however, may equally well have come from the\r\nsouth) from the Cordillera in this latitude; but probably, in chief\r\npart, from farther north.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Santa Cruz, the gravel may be seen continuously\r\ncapping the great 840 feet plain: at the Rio Gallegos, where this plain\r\nis succeeded by a lower one, there is, as I am informed by Captain\r\nSulivan, an irregular covering of gravel from ten to twelve feet in\r\nthickness over the whole country. The district on each side of the\r\nStrait of Magellan is covered up either with gravel or the boulder\r\nformation: it was interesting to observe the marked difference between\r\nthe perfectly rounded state of the pebbles in the great shingle\r\nformation of Patagonia, and the more or less angular fragments in the\r\nboulder formation. The pebbles and fragments near the Strait of\r\nMagellan nearly all belong to rocks known to occur in Fuegia. I was\r\ntherefore much surprised in dredging south of the Strait to find, in\r\nlat. 54° 10′ south, many pebbles of the gallstone-yellow siliceous\r\nporphyry; I procured others from a great depth off Staten Island, and\r\nothers were brought me from the western extremity of the Falkland\r\nIslands.[18] The distribution of the pebbles of this peculiar porphyry,\r\nwhich I venture to affirm is not found _in situ_ either in Fuegia, the\r\nFalkland Islands, or on the coast of Patagonia, is very remarkable, for\r\nthey are\r\nfound over a space of 840 miles in a north and south line, and at the\r\nFalklands, 300 miles eastward of the coast of Patagonia. Their\r\noccurrence in Fuegia and the Falklands may, however, perhaps be due to\r\nthe same ice-agency by which the boulders have been there transported.\r\n\r\n [18] At my request, Mr. Kent collected for me a bag of pebbles from\r\n the beach of White Rock harbour, in the northern part of the sound,\r\n between the two Falkland Islands. Out of these well-rounded pebbles,\r\n varying in size from a walnut to a hen’s egg, with some larger,\r\n thirty-eight evidently belonged to the rocks of these islands;\r\n twenty-six were similar to the pebbles of porphyry found on the\r\n Patagonian plains, which rocks do not exist _in situ_ in the\r\n Falklands; one pebble belonged to the peculiar yellow siliceous\r\n porphyry; thirty were of doubtful origin.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that porphyritic pebbles of a small size are first met\r\nwith on the northern side of the Rio Colorado, the bed becoming well\r\ndeveloped near the Rio Negro: from this latter point I have every\r\nreason to believe that the gravel extends uninterruptedly over the\r\nplains and valleys of Patagonia for at least 630 nautical miles\r\nsouthward to the Rio Gallegos. From the slope of the plains, from the\r\nnature of the pebbles, from their extension at the Rio Negro far into\r\nthe interior, and at the Santa Cruz close up to the Cordillera, I think\r\nit highly probable that the whole breadth of Patagonia is thus covered.\r\nIf so, the average width of the bed must be about two hundred miles.\r\nNear the coast the gravel is generally from ten to thirty feet in\r\nthickness; and as in the valley of Santa Cruz it attains, at some\r\ndistance from the Cordillera, a thickness of 214 feet, we may, I think,\r\nsafely assume its average thickness over the whole area of 630 by 200\r\nmiles, at fifty feet!\r\n\r\nThe transportal and origin of this vast bed of pebbles is an\r\ninteresting problem. From the manner in which they cap the step-formed\r\nplains, worn by the sea within the period of existing shells, their\r\ndeposition, at least on the plains up to a height of 400 feet, must\r\nhave been a recent geological event. From the form of the continent, we\r\nmay feel sure that they have come from the westward, probably, in chief\r\npart from the Cordillera, but, perhaps, partly from unknown rocky\r\nridges in the central districts of Patagonia. That the pebbles have not\r\nbeen transported by rivers, from the interior towards the coast, we may\r\nconclude from the fewness and smallness of the streams of Patagonia:\r\nmoreover, in the case of the one great and rapid river of Santa Cruz,\r\nwe have good evidence that its transporting power is very trifling.\r\nThis river is from two to three hundred yards in width, about seventeen\r\nfeet deep in its middle, and runs with a singular degree of uniformity\r\nfive knots an hour, with no lakes and scarcely any still reaches:\r\nnevertheless, to give one instance of its small transporting power,\r\nupon careful examination, pebbles of compact basalt could not be found\r\nin the bed of the river at a greater distance than ten miles below the\r\npoint where the stream rushes over the debris of the great basaltic\r\ncliffs forming its shore: fragments of the _ cellular_ varieties have\r\nbeen washed down twice or thrice as far. That the pebbles in Central\r\nand Northern Patagonia have not been transported by ice-agency, as\r\nseems to have been the case to a considerable extent farther south, and\r\nlikewise in the northern hemisphere, we may conclude, from the absence\r\nof all angular fragments in the gravel, and from the complete contrast\r\nin many other respects between the shingle and neighbouring boulder\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nLooking to the gravel on any one of the step-formed plains, I cannot\r\ndoubt, from the several reasons assigned in this chapter, that it has\r\nbeen spread out and leveled by the long-continued action of the sea,\r\nprobably during the slow rise of the land. The smooth and perfectly\r\nrounded\r\ncondition of the innumerable pebbles alone would prove long-continued\r\naction. But how the whole mass of shingle on the coast-plains has been\r\ntransported from the mountains of the interior, is another and more\r\ndifficult question. The following considerations, however, show that\r\nthe sea by its ordinary action has considerable power in distributing\r\npebbles. A table has already been given, showing how very uniformly and\r\ngradually[19] the pebbles decrease in size with the gradually seaward\r\nincreasing depth and distance. A series of this kind irresistibly leads\r\nto the conclusion, that the sea has the power of sifting and\r\ndistributing the loose matter on its bottom. According to Martin\r\nWhite,[20] the bed of the British Channel is disturbed during gales at\r\ndepths of sixty-three and sixty-seven fathoms, and at thirty fathoms,\r\nshingle and fragments of shells are often deposited, afterwards to be\r\ncarried away again. Groundswells, which are believed to be caused by\r\ndistant gales, seem especially to affect the bottom: at such times,\r\naccording to Sir R. Schomburgk,[21] the sea to a great distance round\r\nthe West Indian Islands, at depths from five to fifteen fathoms,\r\nbecomes discoloured, and even the anchors of vessels have been moved.\r\nThere are, however, some difficulties in understanding how the sea can\r\ntransport pebbles lying at the bottom, for, from experiments instituted\r\non the power of running water, it would appear that the currents of the\r\nsea have not sufficient velocity to move stones of even moderate size:\r\nmoreover, I have repeatedly found in the most exposed situations that\r\nthe pebbles which lie at the bottom are encrusted with full-grown\r\nliving corallines, furnished with the most delicate, yet unbroken\r\nspines: for instance, in ten fathoms water off the mouth of the Santa\r\nCruz, many pebbles, under half an inch in diameter, were thus coated\r\nwith Flustracean zoophytes.[22] Hence we must conclude\r\nthat these pebbles are not often violently disturbed: it should,\r\nhowever, be borne in mind that the growth of corallines is rapid. The\r\nview, propounded by Professor Playfair, will, I believe, explain this\r\napparent difficulty,—namely, that from the undulations of the sea\r\n_tending_ to lift up and down pebbles or other loose bodies at the\r\nbottom, such are liable, when thus quite or partially raised, to be\r\nmoved even by a very small force, a little onwards. We can thus\r\nunderstand how oceanic or tidal currents of no great strength, or that\r\nrecoil movement of the bottom-water near the land, called by sailors\r\nthe “undertow” (which I presume must extend out seaward as far as the\r\n_breaking_ waves impel the surface-water towards the beach), may gain\r\nthe power during storms of sifting and distributing pebbles even of\r\nconsiderable size, and yet without so violently disturbing them as to\r\ninjure the encrusting corallines.[23]\r\n\r\n [19] I may mention, that at the distance of 150 miles from the\r\n Patagonian shore I carefully examined the minute rounded particles in\r\n the sand, and found them to be fusible like the porphyries of the\r\n great shingle bed. I could even distinguish particles of the\r\n gallstone-yellow porphyry. It was interesting to notice how gradually\r\n the particles of white quartz increased, as we approached the Falkland\r\n Islands, which are thus constituted. In the whole line of soundings\r\n between these islands and the coast of Patagonia dead or living\r\n organic remains were most rare. On the relations between the depth of\r\n water and the nature of the bottom, see Martin White on “Soundings in\r\n the Channel,” pp. 4, 6, 175; also Captain Beechey’s “Voyage to the\r\n Pacific,” chap. xviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] “Soundings in the Channel,” pp. 4, 166. M. Siau states (_Edin.\r\n New Phil. Jour._, vol. xxxi, p. 246), that he found the sediment, at a\r\n depth of 188 metres, arranged in ripples of different degrees of\r\n fineness. There are some excellent discussions on this and allied\r\n subjects in Sir H. De la Beche’s “Theoretical Researches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] _Journal of Royal Geograph. Soc.,_ vol. v, p. 25. It appears from\r\n Mr. Scott Russell’s investigations (see Mr. Murchison’s “Anniver.\r\n Address Geolog. Soc.,” 1843, p. 40), that in waves of translation the\r\n motion of the particles of water is nearly as great at the bottom as\r\n at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] (A pebble, one and a half inch square and half an inch thick, was\r\n given me, dredged up from twenty-seven fathoms depth off the western\r\n end of the Falkland Islands, where the sea is remarkably stormy, and\r\n subject to violent tides. This pebble was encrusted on all sides by a\r\n delicate living coralline. I have seen many pebbles from depths\r\n between forty and seventy fathoms thus encrusted; one from the latter\r\n depth off Cape Horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n [23] I may take this opportunity of remarking on a singular, but very\r\n common character in the form of the bottom, in the creeks which deeply\r\n penetrate the western shores of Tierra del Fuego; namely, that they\r\n are almost invariably much shallower close to the open sea at their\r\n mouths than inland. Thus, Cook, in entering Christmas Sound, first had\r\n soundings in thirty-seven fathoms, then in fifty, then in sixty, and a\r\n little farther in no bottom with 170 fathoms. The sealers are so\r\n familiar with this fact, that they always look out for anchorage near\r\n the entrances of the creeks. See, also, on this subject, the “Voyages\r\n of the _ Adventure_ and _Beagle_,” vol. i, p. 375 and “Appendix,” p.\r\n 313. This Shoalness of the sea-channels near their entrances probably\r\n results from the quantity of sediment formed by the wear and tear of\r\n the outer rocks exposed to the full force of the open sea. I have no\r\n doubt that many lakes, for instance in Scotland, which are very deep\r\n within, and are separated from the sea apparently only by a tract of\r\n detritus, were originally sea-channels with banks of this nature near\r\n their mouths, which have since been upheaved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea acts in another and distinct manner in the distribution of\r\npebbles, namely by the waves on the beach. Mr. Palmer,[24] in his\r\nexcellent memoir on this subject, has shown that vast masses of shingle\r\ntravel with surprising quickness along lines of coast, according to the\r\ndirection with which the waves break on the beach and that this is\r\ndetermined by the prevailing direction of the winds. This agency must\r\nbe powerful in mingling together and disseminating pebbles derived from\r\ndifferent sources: we may, perhaps, thus understand the wide\r\ndistribution of the gallstone-yellow porphyry; and likewise, perhaps,\r\nthe great difference in the nature of the pebbles at the mouth of the\r\nSanta Cruz from those in the same latitude at the head of the valley.\r\n\r\n [24] “Philosophical Transactions,” 1834, p. 576.\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to assign to these several and complicated agencies\r\ntheir shares in the distribution of the Patagonian shingle: but from\r\nthe several considerations given in this chapter, and I may add, from\r\nthe frequency of a capping of gravel on tertiary deposits in all parts\r\nof the world, as I have myself observed and seen stated in the works of\r\nvarious authors, I cannot doubt that the power of widely dispersing\r\ngravel is an ordinary contingent on the action of the sea; and that\r\neven in the case of the great Patagonian shingle-bed we have no\r\noccasion to call in the aid of debacles. I at one time imagined that\r\nperhaps an immense accumulation of shingle had originally been\r\ncollected at the foot of the Cordillera; and that this accumulation,\r\nwhen upraised above the level of the sea, had been eaten into and\r\npartially spread out (as off the present line of coast); and that the\r\nnewly-spread out bed had in its turn been upraised, eaten into, and\r\nre-spread out; and so onwards, until the shingle, which was first\r\naccumulated in great thickness at the foot of the Cordillera, had\r\nreached in thinner beds its present extension. By whatever means the\r\ngravel formation of Patagonia may have been distributed, the vastness\r\nof its area, its thickness, its superficial position, its recent\r\norigin, and the great degree of similarity in the nature of its\r\npebbles, all appear to me well deserving the attention of geologists,\r\nin relation to the origin of the widely-spread beds of conglomerate\r\nbelonging to past epochs.\r\n\r\nNo. 7\r\nSection of coast-cliffs and bottom of sea, off the island of St.\r\nHelena.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of clast-cliffs and bottom of sea, off the\r\nisland of St. Helena.]\r\n\r\n_Formation of Cliffs._—When viewing the sea-worn cliffs of Patagonia,\r\nin some parts between eight hundred and nine hundred feet in height,\r\nand formed of horizontal tertiary strata, which must once have extended\r\nfar seaward—or again, when viewing the lofty cliffs round many volcanic\r\nislands, in which the gentle inclination of the lava-streams indicates\r\nthe former extension of the land, a difficulty often occurred to me,\r\nnamely, how the strata could possibly have been removed by the action\r\nof the sea at a considerable depth beneath its surface. The section in\r\ndiagram No. 7, which represents the general form of the land on the\r\nnorthern and leeward side of St. Helena (taken from Mr. Seale’s large\r\nmodel and various measurements), and of the bottom of the adjoining sea\r\n(taken chiefly from Captain Austin’s survey and some old charts), will\r\nshow the nature of this difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems probable, the basaltic streams were originally prolonged\r\nwith nearly their present inclination, they must, as shown by the\r\ndotted line in the section, once have extended at least to a point, now\r\ncovered\r\nby the sea to a depth of nearly thirty fathoms: but I have every reason\r\nto believe they extended considerably further, for the inclination of\r\nthe streams is less near the coast than further inland. It should also\r\nbe observed, that other sections on the coast of this island would have\r\ngiven far more striking results, but I had not the exact measurements;\r\nthus, on the windward side, the cliffs are about two thousand feet in\r\nheight and the cut-off lava streams very gently inclined, and the\r\nbottom of the sea has nearly a similar slope all round the island. How,\r\nthen, has all the hard basaltic rock, which once extended beneath the\r\nsurface of the sea, been worn away? According to Captain Austin, the\r\nbottom is uneven and rocky only to that very small distance from the\r\nbeach within which the depth is from five to six fathoms; outside this\r\nline, to a depth of about one hundred fathoms, the bottom is smooth,\r\ngently inclined, and formed of mud and sand; outside the one hundred\r\nfathoms, it plunges suddenly into unfathomable depths, as is so very\r\ncommonly the case on all coasts where sediment is accumulating. At\r\ngreater depths than the five or six fathoms, it seems impossible, under\r\nexisting circumstances, that the sea can both have worn away hard rock,\r\nin parts to a thickness of at least 150 feet, and have deposited a\r\nsmooth bed of fine sediment. Now, if we had any reason to suppose that\r\nSt. Helena had, during a long period, gone on slowly subsiding, every\r\ndifficulty would be removed: for looking at the diagram, and imagining\r\na fresh amount of subsidence, we can see that the waves would then act\r\non the coast-cliffs with fresh and unimpaired vigour, whilst the rocky\r\nledge near the beach would be carried down to that depth, at which sand\r\nand mud would be deposited on its bare and uneven surface: after the\r\nformation near the shore of a new rocky shoal, fresh subsidence would\r\ncarry it down and allow it to be smoothly covered up. But in the case\r\nof the many cliff-bounded islands, for instance in some of the Canary\r\nIslands and of Madeira, round which the inclination of the strata shows\r\nthat the land once extended far into the depths of the sea, where there\r\nis no apparent means of hard rock being worn away—are we to suppose\r\nthat all these islands have slowly subsided? Madeira, I may remark,\r\nhas, according to Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, subsided. Are we to extend\r\nthis conclusion to the high, cliff-bound, horizontally stratified\r\nshores of Patagonia, off which, though the water is not deep even at\r\nthe distance of several miles, yet the smooth bottom of pebbles\r\ngradually decreasing in size with the increasing depth, and derived\r\nfrom a foreign source, seem to declare that the sea is now a depositing\r\nand not a corroding agent? I am much inclined to suspect, that we shall\r\nhereafter find in all such cases, that the land with the adjoining bed\r\nof the sea has in truth subsided: the time will, I believe, come, when\r\ngeologists will consider it as improbable, that the land should have\r\nretained the same level during a whole geological period, as that the\r\natmosphere should have remained absolutely calm during an entire\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II ON THE ELEVATION OF THE WESTERN COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChonos Archipelago.—Chiloe, recent and gradual elevation of, traditions\r\nof the inhabitants on this subject.—Concepcion, earthquake and\r\nelevation of.—VALPARAISO, great elevation of, upraised shells, earth of\r\nmarine origin, gradual rise of the land within the historical\r\nperiod.—COQUIMBO, elevation of, in recent times; terraces of marine\r\norigin, their inclination, their escarpments not horizontal.—Guasco,\r\ngravel terraces of.—Copiapo.—PERU.—Upraised shells of Cobija, Iquique,\r\nand Arica.—Lima, shell-beds and sea-beach on San Lorenzo, human\r\nremains, fossil earthenware, earthquake debacle, recent subsidence. On\r\nthe decay of upraised shells.—General summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommencing at the south and proceeding northward, the first place at\r\nwhich I landed, was at Cape Tres Montes, in lat. 46° 35′. Here, on the\r\nshores of Christmas Cove, I observed in several places a beach of\r\npebbles with recent shells, about twenty feet above high-water mark.\r\nSouthward of Tres Montes (between lat. 47° and 48°), Byron[1] remarks,\r\n“We thought it very strange, that upon the summits of the highest hills\r\nwere found beds of shells, a foot or two thick.” In the Chonos\r\nArchipelago, the island of Lemus (lat. 44° 30′) was, according to M.\r\nCoste,2 suddenly elevated eight feet, during the earthquake of 1829: he\r\nadds, “Des roches jadis toujours couvertes par la mer, restant\r\naujourd’hui constamment decouvertes.” In other parts of this\r\narchipelago, I observed two terraces of gravel, abutting to the foot of\r\neach other: at Lowe’s Harbour (43° 48′), under a great mass of the\r\nboulder formation, about three hundred feet in thickness, I found a\r\nlayer of sand, with numerous comminuted fragments of sea-shells, having\r\na fresh aspect, but too small to be identified.\r\n\r\n [1] “Narrative of the Loss of the _Wager_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] “Comptes Rendus,” October 1838, p. 706.\r\n\r\n_The Island of Chiloe._—The evidence of recent elevation is here more\r\nsatisfactory. The bay of San Carlos is in most parts bounded by\r\nprecipitous cliffs from about ten to forty feet in height, their bases\r\nbeing separated from the present line of tidal action by a talus, a few\r\nfeet in height, covered with vegetation. In one sheltered creek (west\r\nof P. Arena), instead of a loose talus, there was a bare sloping bank\r\nof tertiary mudstone, perforated, above the line of the highest tides,\r\nby numerous shells of a Pholas now common in the harbour. The upper\r\nextremities of these shells, standing upright in their holes with grass\r\ngrowing out of them, were abraded about a quarter of an inch, to the\r\nsame level with the surrounding worn strata. In other parts, I observed\r\n(as at Pudeto) a great beach, formed of comminuted shells, twenty feet\r\nabove the present shore. In other parts again, there were small caves\r\nworn into the foot of the low cliffs, and protected from the waves by\r\nthe talus with its vegetation: one such cave, which I examined, had its\r\nmouth about twenty feet, and its bottom, which was filled with sand\r\ncontaining fragments of shells and legs of crabs, from eight to ten\r\nfeet above high-water mark. From these several facts, and from the\r\nappearance of the upraised shells, I inferred that the elevation had\r\nbeen quite recent; and on inquiring from Mr. Williams, the Portmaster,\r\nhe told me he was convinced that the land had risen, or the sea fallen,\r\nfour feet within the last four years. During this period, there had\r\nbeen one severe earthquake, but no particular change of level was then\r\nobserved; from the habits of the people who all keep boats in the\r\nprotected creeks, it is absolutely impossible that a rise of four feet\r\ncould have taken place suddenly and been unperceived. Mr. Williams\r\nbelieves that the change has been quite gradual. Without the elevatory\r\nmovement continues at a quick rate, there can be no doubt that the sea\r\nwill soon destroy the talus of earth at the foot of the cliffs round\r\nthe bay, and will then reach its former lateral extension, but not of\r\ncourse its former level: some of the inhabitants assured me that one\r\nsuch talus, with a footpath on it, was even already sensibly decreasing\r\nin width. I received several accounts of beds of shells, existing at\r\nconsiderable heights in the inland parts of Chiloe; and to one of\r\nthese, near Catiman, I was guided by a countryman. Here, on the south\r\nside of the peninsula of Lacuy, there was an immense bed of the _Venus\r\ncostellata_ and of an oyster, lying on the summit-edge of a piece of\r\ntableland, 350 feet (by the barometer) above the level of the sea. The\r\nshells were closely packed together, embedded in and covered by a very\r\nblack, damp, peaty mould, two or three feet in thickness, out of which\r\na forest of great trees was growing. Considering the nature and\r\ndampness of this peaty soil, it is surprising that the fine ridges on\r\nthe outside of the Venus are perfectly preserved, though all the shells\r\nhave a blackened appearance. I did not doubt that the black soil, which\r\nwhen dry, cakes hard, was entirely of terrestrial origin, but on\r\nexamining it under the microscope, I found many very minute rounded\r\nfragments of shells, amongst which I could distinguish bits of Serpulæ\r\nand mussels. The _Venus costellata_, and the Ostrea (_O. edulis_,\r\naccording to Captain King) are now the commonest shells in the\r\nadjoining bays. In a bed of shells, a few feet below the 350 feet bed,\r\nI found a horn of the little _Cervus humilis_, which now inhabits\r\nChiloe.\r\n\r\nThe eastern or inland side of Chiloe, with its many adjacent islets,\r\nconsists of tertiary and boulder deposits, worn into irregular plains\r\ncapped by gravel. Near Castro, and for ten miles southward, and on the\r\nislet of Lemuy, I found the surface of the ground to a height of\r\nbetween twenty and thirty feet above high-water mark, and in several\r\nplaces apparently up to fifty feet, thickly coated by much comminuted\r\nshells, chiefly of the _Venus costellata_ and _Mytilus Chiloensis_; the\r\nspecies now most abundant on this line of coast. As the inhabitants\r\ncarry immense numbers of these shells inland, the continuity of the bed\r\nat the same height was often the only means of recognising its natural\r\norigin. Near Castro, on each side of the creek and rivulet of the\r\nGamboa, three distinct terraces are seen: the lowest was estimated at\r\nabout one hundred and fifty feet in height, and the highest at about\r\nfive hundred feet, with the country irregularly rising behind it;\r\nobscure\r\ntraces, also, of these same terraces could be seen along other parts of\r\nthe coast. There can be no doubt that their three escarpments record\r\npauses in the elevation of the island. I may remark that several\r\npromontories have the word Huapi, which signifies in the Indian tongue,\r\nisland, appended to them, such as Huapilinao, Huapilacuy, Caucahuapi,\r\netc.; and these, according to Indian traditions, once existed as\r\nislands. In the same manner the term Pulo in Sumatra is appended[3] to\r\nthe names of promontories, traditionally said to have been islands; in\r\nSumatra, as in Chiloe, there are upraised recent shells. The Bay of\r\nCarelmapu, on the mainland north of Chiloe, according to Agüerros,[4]\r\nwas in 1643 a good harbour; it is now quite useless, except for boats.\r\n\r\n [3] Marsden’s “Sumatra,” p. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] “Descripcion Hist. de la Provincia de Chiloé,” p. 78. From the\r\n account given by the old Spanish writers, it would appear that several\r\n other harbours, between this point and Concepcion, were formerly much\r\n deeper than they now are.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valdivia._—I did not observe here any distinct proofs of recent\r\nelevation; but in a bed of very soft sandstone, forming a fringe-like\r\nplain, about sixty feet in height, round the hills of mica-slate, there\r\nare shells of Mytilus, Crepidula, Solen, Novaculina, and Cytheræa, too\r\nimperfect to be specifically recognised. At Imperial, seventy miles\r\nnorth of Valdivia, Agüerros[5] states that there are large beds of\r\nshells, at a considerable distance from the coast, which are burnt for\r\nlime. The island of Mocha, lying a little north of Imperial, was\r\nuplifted two feet,[6] during the earthquake of 1835.\r\n\r\n [5] _Ibid.,_ p. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] “Voyages of _Adventure_ and _Beagle_,” vol. ii, p. 415.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concepcion._—I cannot add anything to the excellent account by Captain\r\nFitzroy[7] of the elevation of the land at this place, which\r\naccompanied the earthquake of 1835. I will only recall to the\r\nrecollection of geologists, that the southern end of the island of St.\r\nMary was uplifted eight feet, the central part nine, and the northern\r\nend ten feet; and the whole island more than the surrounding districts.\r\nGreat beds of mussels, patellæ, and chitons still adhering to the rocks\r\nwere upraised above high-water mark; and some acres of a rocky flat,\r\nwhich was formerly always covered by the sea, was left standing dry,\r\nand exhaled an offensive smell, from the many attached and putrefying\r\nshells. It appears from the researches of Captain Fitzroy that both the\r\nisland of St. Mary and Concepcion (which was uplifted only four or five\r\nfeet) in the course of some weeks subsided, and lost part of their\r\nfirst elevation. I will only add as a lesson of caution, that round the\r\nsandy shores of the great Bay of Concepcion, it was most difficult,\r\nowing to the obliterating effects of the great accompanying wave, to\r\nrecognise any distinct\r\nevidence of this considerable upheaval; one spot must be excepted,\r\nwhere there was a detached rock which before the earthquake had always\r\nbeen covered by the sea, but afterwards was left uncovered.\r\n\r\n [7] _Ibid.,_ vol. ii, p. 412, _et seq._ In vol. v, p. 601 of the\r\n “Geological Transactions” I have given an account of the remarkable\r\n volcanic phenomena, which accompanied this earthquake. These phenomena\r\n appear to me to prove that the action, by which large tracts of land\r\n are uplifted, and by which volcanic eruptions are produced, is in\r\n every respect identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the island of Quiriquina (in the Bay of Concepcion), I found, at an\r\nestimated height of four hundred feet, extensive layers of shells,\r\nmostly comminuted, but some perfectly preserved and closely packed in\r\nblack vegetable mould; they consisted of Concholepas, Fissurella,\r\nMytilus, Trochus, and Balanus. Some of these layers of shells rested on\r\na thick bed of bright-red, dry, friable earth, capping the surface of\r\nthe tertiary sandstone, and extending, as I observed whilst sailing\r\nalong the coast, for 150 miles southward: at Valparaiso, we shall\r\npresently see that a similar red earthy mass, though quite like\r\nterrestrial mould, is really in chief part of recent marine origin. On\r\nthe flanks of this island of Quiriquina, at a less height than the 400\r\nfeet, there were spaces several feet square, thickly strewed with\r\nfragments of similar shells. During a subsequent visit of the _Beagle_\r\nto Concepcion, Mr. Kent, the assistant-surgeon, was so kind as to make\r\nfor me some measurements with the barometer: he found many marine\r\nremains along the shores of the whole bay, at a height of about twenty\r\nfeet; and from the hill of Sentinella behind Talcahuano, at the height\r\nof 160 feet, he collected numerous shells, packed together close\r\nbeneath the surface in black earth, consisting of two species of\r\nMytilus, two of Crepidula, one of Concholepas, of Fissurella, Venus,\r\nMactra, Turbo, Monoceros, and the _Balanus psittacus._ These shells\r\nwere bleached, and within some of the Balani other Balani were growing,\r\nshowing that they must have long lain dead in the sea. The above\r\nspecies I compared with living ones from the bay, and found them\r\nidentical; but having since lost the specimens, I cannot give their\r\nnames: this is of little importance, as Mr. Broderip has examined a\r\nsimilar collection, made during Captain Beechey’s expedition, and\r\nascertained that they consisted of ten recent species, associated with\r\nfragments of Echini, crabs, and Flustræ; some of these remains were\r\nestimated by Lieutenant Belcher to lie at the height of nearly a\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea.[8] In some places round the\r\nbay, Mr. Kent observed that there were beds formed exclusively of the\r\n_Mytilus Chiloensis_: this species now lives in parts never uncovered\r\nby the tides. At considerable heights, Mr. Kent found only a few\r\nshells; but from the summit of one hill, 625 feet high, he brought me\r\nspecimens of the Concholepas, _Mytilus Chiloensis_, and a Turbo. These\r\nshells were softer and more brittle than those from the height of 164\r\nfeet; and these latter had obviously a much more ancient appearance\r\nthan the same species from the height of only twenty feet.\r\n\r\n [8] “Zoology of Captain Beechey’s Voyage,” p. 162.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coast north of Concepcion._—The first point examined was at the mouth\r\nof the Rapel (160 miles north of Concepcion and sixty miles south of\r\nValparaiso), where I observed a few shells at the height of 100 feet,\r\nand some barnacles adhering to the rocks three or four feet above the\r\nhighest tides: M. Gay[9] found here recent shells at the distance\r\nof two leagues from the shore. Inland there are some wide,\r\ngravel-capped plains, intersected by many broad, flat-bottomed valleys\r\n(now carrying insignificant streamlets), with their sides cut into\r\nsuccessive wall-like escarpments, rising one above another, and in many\r\nplaces, according to M. Gay, worn into caves. The one cave (C. del\r\nObispo) which I examined, resembled those formed on many sea-coasts,\r\nwith its bottom filled with shingle. These inland plains, instead of\r\nsloping towards the coast, are inclined in an opposite direction\r\ntowards the Cordillera, like the successively rising terraces on the\r\ninland or eastern side of Chiloe: some points of granite, which project\r\nthrough the plains near the coast, no doubt once formed a chain of\r\noutlying islands, on the inland shores of which the plains were\r\naccumulated. At Bucalemu, a few miles northward of the Rapel, I\r\nobserved at the foot, and on the summit-edge of a plain, ten miles from\r\nthe coast, many recent shells, mostly comminuted, but some perfect.\r\nThere were, also, many at the bottom of the great valley of the Maypu.\r\nAt San Antonio, shells are said to be collected and burnt for lime. At\r\nthe bottom of a great ravine (Quebrada Onda, on the road to Casa\r\nBlanca), at the distance of several miles from the coast, I noticed a\r\nconsiderable bed, composed exclusively of _Mesodesma donaciforme_,\r\nDesh., lying on a bed of muddy sand: this shell now lives associated\r\ntogether in great numbers, on tidal-flats on the coast of Chile.\r\n\r\n [9] “Annales des Scienc. Nat.,” Avril 1833.\r\n\r\n_Valparaiso._\r\n\r\nDuring two successive years I carefully examined, part of the time in\r\ncompany with Mr. Alison, into all the facts connected with the recent\r\nelevation of this neighbourhood. In very many parts a beach of broken\r\nshells, about fourteen or fifteen feet above high-water mark, may be\r\nobserved; and at this level the coast-rocks, where precipitous, are\r\ncorroded in a band. At one spot, Mr. Alison, by removing some birds’\r\ndung, found at this same level barnacles adhering to the rocks. For\r\nseveral miles southward of the bay, almost every flat little headland,\r\nbetween the heights of 60 and 230 feet (measured by the barometer), is\r\nsmoothly coated by a thick mass of comminuted shells, of the same\r\nspecies, and apparently in the same proportional numbers with those\r\nexisting in the adjoining sea. The Concholepas is much the most\r\nabundant, and the best preserved shell; but I extracted perfectly\r\npreserved specimens of the _Fissurella biradiata_, a Trochus and\r\nBalanus (both well-known, but according to Mr. Sowerby yet unnamed) and\r\nparts of the _Mytilus Chiloensis._ Most of these shells, as well as an\r\nencrusting Nullipora, partially retain their colour; but they are\r\nbrittle, and often stained red from the underlying brecciated mass of\r\nprimary rocks; some are packed together, either in black or reddish\r\nmoulds; some lie loose on the bare rocky surfaces. The total number of\r\nthese shells is immense; they are less numerous, though still far from\r\nrare, up a height of 1,000 feet above the sea. On the summit of a hill,\r\nmeasured 557 feet, there was a small horizontal band of comminuted\r\nshells, of which _many_ consisted (and likewise from lesser heights) of\r\nvery young and small\r\nspecimens of the still living Concholepas, Trochus, Patellæ, Crepidulæ,\r\nand of _Mytilus Magellanicus_ (?):[10] several of these shells were\r\nunder a quarter of an inch in their greatest diameter. My attention was\r\ncalled to this circumstance by a native fisherman, whom I took to look\r\nat these shell-beds; and he ridiculed the notion of such small shells\r\nhaving been brought up for food; nor could some of the species have\r\nadhered when alive to other larger shells. On another hill, some miles\r\ndistant, and 648 feet high, I found shells of the Concholepas and\r\nTrochus, perfect, though very old, with fragments of _Mytilus\r\nChiloensis_, all embedded in reddish-brown mould: I also found these\r\nsame species, with fragments of an Echinus and of _Balanus psittacus_,\r\non a hill 1,000 feet high. Above this height, shells became very rare,\r\nthough on a hill 1,300 feet high,[11] I collected the Concholepas,\r\nTrochus, Fissurella, and a Patella. At these greater heights the shells\r\nare almost invariably embedded in mould, and sometimes are exposed only\r\nby tearing up bushes. These shells obviously had a very much more\r\nancient appearance than those from the lesser heights; the apices of\r\nthe Trochi were often worn down; the little holes made by burrowing\r\nanimals were greatly enlarged; and the Concholepas was often perforated\r\nquite through, owing to the inner plates of shell having scaled off.\r\n\r\n [10] Mr. Cuming informs me that he does not think this species\r\n identical with, though closely resembling, the true _M. Magellanicus_\r\n of the southern and eastern coast of South America; it lives\r\n abundantly on the coast of Chile.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Measured by the barometer: the highest point in the range behind\r\n Valparaiso I found to be 1,626 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nMany of these shells, as I have said, were packed in, and were quite\r\nfilled with, blackish or reddish-brown earth, resting on the granitic\r\ndetritus. I did not doubt until lately that this mould was of purely\r\nterrestrial origin, when with a microscope examining some of it from\r\nthe inside of a Concholepas from the height of about one hundred feet,\r\nI found that it was in considerable part composed of minute fragments\r\nof the spines, mouth-bones, and shells of Echini, and of minute\r\nfragments, of chiefly very young Patellæ, Mytili, and other species. I\r\nfound similar microscopical fragments in earth filling up the central\r\norifices of some large Fissurellæ. This earth when crushed emits a\r\nsickly smell, precisely like that from garden-mould mixed with guano.\r\nThe earth accidentally preserved within the shells, from the greater\r\nheights, has the same general appearance, but it is a little redder; it\r\nemits the same smell when rubbed, but I was unable to detect with\r\ncertainty any marine remains in it. This earth resembles in general\r\nappearance, as before remarked, that capping the rocks of Quiriquina in\r\nthe Bay of Concepcion, on which beds of sea-shells lay. I have, also,\r\nshown that the black, peaty soil, in which the shells at the height of\r\n350 feet at Chiloe were packed, contained many minute fragments of\r\nmarine animals. These facts appear to me interesting, as they show that\r\nsoils, which would naturally be considered of purely terrestrial\r\nnature, may owe their origin in chief part to the sea.\r\n\r\nBeing well aware from what I have seen at Chiloe and in Tierra del\r\nFuego, that vast quantities of shells are carried, during successive\r\nages, far inland, where the inhabitants chiefly subsist on these\r\nproductions, I am bound to state that at greater heights than 557 feet,\r\nwhere the number of very young and small shells proved that they had\r\nnot been carried up for food, the only evidence of the shells having\r\nbeen naturally left by the sea, consists in their invariable and\r\nuniform appearance of extreme antiquity—in the distance of some of the\r\nplaces from the coast, in others being inaccessible from the nearest\r\npart of the beach, and in the absence of fresh water for men to\r\ndrink—in the shells _not lying in heaps_,—and, lastly, in the close\r\nsimilarity of the soil in which they are embedded, to that which lower\r\ndown can be unequivocally shown to be in great part formed from the\r\ndebris of the sea animals.[12]\r\n\r\n [12] In the “Proceedings of the Geolog. Soc.,” vol. ii, p. 446, I have\r\n given a brief account of the upraised shells on the coast of Chile,\r\n and have there stated that the proofs of elevation are not\r\n satisfactory above the height of 230 feet. I had at that time\r\n unfortunately overlooked a separate page written during my second\r\n visit to Valparaiso, describing the shells now in my possession from\r\n the 557 feet hill; I had not then unpacked my collections, and had not\r\n reconsidered the obvious appearance of greater antiquity of the shells\r\n from the greater heights, nor had I at that time discovered the marine\r\n origin of the earth in which many of the shells are packed.\r\n Considering these facts, I do not now feel a shadow of doubt that the\r\n shells, at the height of 1,300 feet, have been upraised by natural\r\n causes into their present position.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the position in which the shells lie, I was repeatedly\r\nstruck here, at Concepcion, and at other places, with the frequency of\r\ntheir occurrence on the summits and edges either of separate hills, or\r\nof little flat headlands often terminating precipitously over the sea.\r\nThe several above-enumerated species of mollusca, which are found\r\nstrewed on the surface of the land from a few feet above the level of\r\nthe sea up to the height of 1,300 feet, all now live either on the\r\nbeach, or at only a few fathoms’ depth: Mr. Edmondston, in a letter to\r\nProfessor E. Forbes, states that in dredging in the Bay of Valparaiso,\r\nhe found the common species of Concholepas, Fissurella, Trochus,\r\nMonoceros, Chitons, etc., living in abundance from the beach to a depth\r\nof seven fathoms; and dead shells occurred only a few fathoms deeper.\r\nThe common _Turritella cingulata_ was dredged up living at even from\r\nten to fifteen fathoms; but this is a species which I did not find here\r\namongst the upraised shells. Considering this fact of the species being\r\nall littoral or sub-littoral, considering their occurrence at various\r\nheights, their vast numbers, and their generally comminuted state,\r\nthere can be little doubt that they were left on successive beach-lines\r\nduring a gradual elevation of the land. The presence, however, of so\r\nmany whole and perfectly preserved shells appears at first a difficulty\r\non this view, considering that the coast is exposed to the full force\r\nof an open ocean: but we may suppose, either that these shells were\r\nthrown during gales on flat ledges of rock just above the level of\r\nhigh-water mark, and that during the elevation of the land they are\r\nnever again touched by the waves, or, that during earthquakes, such as\r\nthose of\r\n1822, 1835, and 1837, rocky reefs covered with marine-animals were it\r\none blow uplifted above the future reach of the sea. This latter\r\nexplanation is, perhaps, the most probable one with respect to the beds\r\nat Concepcion entirely composed of the _Mytilus Chiloensis_, a species\r\nwhich lives below the lowest tides; and likewise with respect to the\r\ngreat beds occurring both north and south of Valparaiso, of the\r\n_Mesodesma donaciforme_,—a shell which, as I am informed by Mr. Cuming,\r\ninhabits sandbanks at the level of the lowest tides. But even in the\r\ncase of shells having the habits of this Mytilus and Mesodesma, beds of\r\nthem, wherever the sea gently throws up sand or mud, and thus protects\r\nits own accumulations, might be upraised by the slowest movement, and\r\nyet remain undisturbed by the waves of each new beach-line.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that nowhere near Valparaiso above the height\r\nof twenty feet, or rarely of fifty feet, I saw any lines of erosion on\r\nthe solid rocks, or any beds of pebbles; this, I believe, may be\r\naccounted for by the disintegrating tendency of most of the rocks in\r\nthis neighbourhood. Nor is the land here modelled into terraces: Mr.\r\nAlison, however, informs me, that on both sides of one narrow ravine,\r\nat the height of 300 feet above the sea, he found a succession of\r\nrather indistinct step-formed beaches, composed of broken shells, which\r\ntogether covered a space of about eighty feet vertical.\r\n\r\nI can add nothing to the accounts already published of the elevation of\r\nthe land at Valparaiso,[13] which accompanied the earthquake of 1822:\r\nbut I heard it confidently asserted, that a sentinel on duty,\r\nimmediately after the shock, saw a part of a fort, which previously was\r\nnot within the line of his vision, and this would indicate that the\r\nuplifting was not horizontal: it would even appear from some facts\r\ncollected by Mr. Alison, that only the eastern half of the bay was then\r\nelevated. Through the kindness of this same gentleman, I am able to\r\ngive an interesting account of the changes of level, which have\r\nsupervened here within historical periods: about the year 1680 a long\r\nsea-wall (or Prefil) was built, of which only a few fragments now\r\nremain; up to the year 1817, the sea often broke over it, and washed\r\nthe houses on the opposite side of the road (where the prison now\r\nstands); and even in 1819, Mr. J. Martin remembers walking at the foot\r\nof this wall, and being often obliged to climb over it to escape the\r\nwaves. There now stands (1834) on the seaward side of this wall, and\r\nbetween it and the beach, in one part a single row of houses, and in\r\nanother part two rows with a street between them. This great extension\r\nof the beach in so short a time cannot be attributed simply to the\r\naccumulation of detritus; for a resident engineer measured for me the\r\nheight between the lowest part of the wall visible, and the present\r\nbeach-line at spring-tides, and the difference was eleven feet six\r\ninches. The church of S. Augustin is believed to have been built in\r\n1614, and there is a tradition that the sea formerly flowed very near\r\nit; by levelling, its foundations were found\r\nto stand nineteen feet six inches above the highest beach-line; so that\r\nwe see in a period of 220 years, the elevation cannot have been as much\r\nas nineteen feet six inches. From the facts given with respect to the\r\nsea-wall, and from the testimony of the elder inhabitants, it appears\r\ncertain that the change in level began to be manifest about the year\r\n1817. The only sudden elevation of which there is any record occurred\r\nin 1822, and this seems to have been less than three feet. Since that\r\nyear, I was assured by several competent observers, that part of an old\r\nwreck, which is firmly embedded near the beach, has sensibly emerged;\r\nhence here, as at Chiloe, a slow rise of the land appears to be now in\r\nprogress. It seems highly probable that the rocks which are corroded in\r\na band at the height of fourteen feet above the sea were acted on\r\nduring the period, when by tradition the base of S. Augustin church,\r\nnow nineteen feet six inches above the highest water-mark, was\r\noccasionally washed by the waves.\r\n\r\n [13] Dr. Meyen (“Reise um Erde,” Th. I, s. 221) found in 1831 seaweed\r\n and other bodies still adhering to some rocks which during the shock\r\n of 1822 were lifted above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valparaiso to Coquimbo._—For the first seventy-five miles north of\r\nValparaiso I followed the coast-road, and throughout this space I\r\nobserved innumerable masses of upraised shells. About Quintero there\r\nare immense accumulations (worked for lime) of the _Mesodesma\r\ndonaciforme_, packed in sandy earth; they abound chiefly about fifteen\r\nfeet above high-water, but shells are here found, according to Mr.\r\nMiers,[14] to a height of 500 feet, and at a distance of three leagues\r\nfrom the coast: I here noticed barnacles adhering to the rocks three or\r\nfour feet above the highest tides. In the neighbourhood of Plazilla and\r\nCatapilco, at heights of between two hundred and three hundred feet,\r\nthe number of comminuted shells, with some perfect ones, especially of\r\nthe Mesodesma, packed in layers, was truly immense: the land at\r\nPlazilla had evidently existed as a bay, with abrupt rocky masses\r\nrising out of it, precisely like the islets in the broken bays now\r\nindenting this coast. On both sides of the rivers Ligua, Longotomo,\r\nGuachen, and Quilimari, there are plains of gravel about two hundred\r\nfeet in height, in many parts absolutely covered with shells. Close to\r\nConchalee, a gravel-plain is fronted by a lower and similar plain about\r\nsixty feet in height, and this again is separated from the beach by a\r\nwide tract of low land: the surfaces of all three plains or terraces\r\nwere strewed with vast numbers of the Concholepas, Mesodesma, an\r\nexisting Venus, and other still existing littoral shells. The two upper\r\nterraces closely resemble in miniature the plains of Patagonia; and\r\nlike them are furrowed by dry, flat-bottomed, winding valleys.\r\nNorthward of this place I turned inward; and therefore found no more\r\nshells: but the valleys of Chuapa, Illapel, and Limari, are bounded by\r\ngravel-capped plains, often including a lower terrace within. These\r\nplains send bay-like arms between and into the surrounding hills; and\r\nthey are continuously united with other extensive gravel-capped plains,\r\nseparating the coast mountain-ranges from the Cordillera.\r\n\r\n [14] “Travels in Chile,” vol. i, pp. 395, 458. I received several\r\n similar accounts from the inhabitants, and was assured that there are\r\n many shells on the plain of Casa Blanca, between Valparaiso and\r\n Santiago, at the height of 800 feet.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo._\r\n\r\nA narrow fringe-like plain, gently inclined towards the sea, here\r\nextends for eleven miles along the coast, with arms stretching up\r\nbetween the coast-mountains, and likewise up the valley of Coquimbo: at\r\nits southern extremity it is directly connected with the plain of\r\nLimari, out of which hills abruptly rise like islets, and other hills\r\nproject like headlands on a coast. The surface of the fringe-like plain\r\nappears level, but differs insensibly in height, and greatly in\r\ncomposition, in different parts.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the valley of Coquimbo, the surface consists wholly of\r\ngravel, and stands from 300 to 350 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nbeing about one hundred feet higher than in other parts. In these other\r\nand lower parts the superficial beds consist of calcareous matter, and\r\nrest on ancient tertiary deposits hereafter to be described. The\r\nuppermost calcareous layer is cream-coloured, compact,\r\nsmooth-fractured, sub-stalactiform, and contains some sand, earthy\r\nmatter, and recent shells. It lies on, and sends wedge-like veins\r\ninto,[15] a much more friable, calcareous, tuff-like variety; and both\r\nrest on a mass about twenty feet in thickness, formed of fragments of\r\nrecent shells, with a few whole ones, and with small pebbles firmly\r\ncemented together. This latter rock is called by the inhabitants\r\n_losa_, and is used for building: in many parts it is divided into\r\nstrata, which dip at an angle of ten degrees seaward, and appear as if\r\nthey had originally been heaped in successive layers (as may be seen on\r\ncoral-reefs) on a steep beach. This stone is remarkable from being in\r\nparts entirely formed of empty, pellucid capsules or cells of\r\ncalcareous matter, of the size of small seeds: a series of specimens\r\nunequivocally showed that all these capsules once contained minute\r\nrounded fragments of shells which have since been gradually dissolved\r\nby water percolating through the mass.[16]\r\n\r\n [15] In many respects this upper hard, and the underlying more\r\n friable, varieties, resemble the great superficial beds at King\r\n George’s Sound in Australia, which I have described in my “Geological\r\n Observations on Volcanic Islands.” There could be little doubt that\r\n the upper layers there have been hardened by the action of rain on the\r\n friable, calcareous matter, and that the whole mass has originated in\r\n the decay of minutely comminuted sea-shells and corals.\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] I have incidentally described this rock in the above work on\r\n Volcanic Islands.\r\n\r\nThe shells embedded in the calcareous beds forming the surface of this\r\nfringe-like plain, at the height of from 200 to 250 feet above the sea,\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\nVenus opaca.\r\n\r\nMulinia Byronensis.\r\n\r\nPecten purpuratus.\r\n\r\nMesodesma donaciforme.\r\n\r\nTurritella cingulata.\r\n\r\nMonoceros costatum.\r\n\r\nConcholepas Peruviana.\r\n\r\nTrochus (common Valparaiso species).\r\n\r\nCalyptræa Byronensis.\r\n\r\nAlthough these species are all recent, and are all found in the\r\nneighbouring sea, yet I was particularly struck with the difference in\r\nthe\r\nproportional numbers of the several species, and of those now cast up\r\non the present beach. I found only one specimen of the Concholepas, and\r\nthe Pecten was very rare, though both these shells are now the\r\ncommonest kinds, with the exception, perhaps, of the _Calyptræa\r\nradians_, of which I did not find one in the calcareous beds. I will\r\nnot pretend to determine how far this difference in the proportional\r\nnumbers depends on the age of the deposit, and how far on the\r\ndifference in nature between the present sandy beaches and the\r\ncalcareous bottom, on which the embedded shells must have lived.\r\n\r\nNo. 8\r\nSection of plain of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of plain of Coquimbo.]\r\n\r\nOn the bare surface of the calcareous plain, or in a thin covering of\r\nsand, there were lying, at a height from 200 to 252 feet, many recent\r\nshells, which had a much fresher appearance than the embedded ones:\r\nfragments of the Concholepas, and of the common Mytilus, still\r\nretaining a tinge of its colour, were numerous, and altogether there\r\nwas manifestly a closer approach in proportional numbers to those now\r\nlying on the beach. In a mass of stratified, slightly agglutinated\r\nsand, which in some places covers up the lower half of the seaward\r\nescarpment of the plain, the included shells appeared to be in exactly\r\nthe same proportional numbers with those on the beach. On one side of a\r\nsteep-sided ravine, cutting through the plain behind Herradura Bay, I\r\nobserved a narrow strip of stratified sand, containing similar shells\r\nin similar proportional numbers; a section of the ravine is represented\r\nin Diagram 8, which serves also to show the general composition of the\r\nplain. I mention this case of the ravine chiefly because without the\r\nevidence of the marine shells in the sand, any one would have supposed\r\nthat it had been hollowed out by simple alluvial action.\r\n\r\nThe escarpment of the fringe-like plain, which stretches for eleven\r\nmiles along the coast, is in some parts fronted by two or three narrow,\r\nstep-formed terraces, one of which at Herradura Bay expands into a\r\nsmall plain. Its surface was there formed of gravel, cemented together\r\nby calcareous matter; and out of it I extracted the following recent\r\nshells, which are in a more perfect condition than those from the upper\r\nplain:—\r\n\r\nCalyptræa radians.\r\n\r\nTurritella cingulata.\r\n\r\nOliva Peruviana.\r\n\r\nMurex labiosus, var.\r\n\r\nNassa (identical with a living species).\r\n\r\nSolen Dombeiana.\r\n\r\nPecten purpuratus.\r\n\r\nVenus Chilensis.\r\n\r\nAmphidesma rugulosum. The small irregular wrinkles of the posterior\r\npart of this shell are rather stronger than in the recent specimens of\r\nthis species from Coquimbo. (G. B. Sowerby.)\r\n\r\nBalanus (identical with living species).\r\n\r\nOn the syenitic ridge, which forms the southern boundary of Herradura\r\nBay and Plain, I found the Concholepas and _Turritella cingulata_\r\n(mostly in fragments), at the height of 242 feet above the sea. I could\r\nnot have told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by\r\nman, if I had not found one very small mass of them cemented together\r\nin a friable calcareous tuff. I mention this fact more particularly,\r\nbecause I carefully looked, in many apparently favourable spots, at\r\nlesser heights on the side of this ridge, and could not find even the\r\nsmallest fragment of a shell. This is only one instance out of many,\r\nproving that the absence of sea-shells on the surface, though in many\r\nrespects inexplicable, is an argument of very little weight in\r\nopposition to other evidence on the recent elevation of the land. The\r\nhighest point in this neighbourhood at which I found upraised shells of\r\nexisting species was on an inland calcareous plain, at the height of\r\n252 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Mr. Caldcleugh’s researches,[17] that a rise has\r\ntaken place here within the last century and a half; and as no sudden\r\nchange of level has been observed during the not very severe\r\nearthquakes, which have occasionally occurred here, the rising has\r\nprobably been slow, like that now, or quite lately, in progress at\r\nChiloe and at Valparaiso: there are three well-known rocks, called the\r\nPelicans, which in 1710, according to Feuillèe, were _à fleur d’eau_,\r\nbut now are said to stand twelve feet above low-water mark: the\r\nspring-tides rise here only five feet. There is another rock, now nine\r\nfeet above high-water mark, which in the time of Frezier and Feuillèe\r\nrose only five or six feet out of water. Mr. Caldcleugh, I may add,\r\nalso shows (and I received similar accounts) that there has been a\r\nconsiderable decrease in the soundings during the last twelve years in\r\nthe Bays of Coquimbo, Concepcion, Valparaiso, and Guasco; but as in\r\nthese cases it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the\r\naccumulation of sediment and the upheavement of the bottom, I have not\r\nentered into any details.\r\n\r\n [17] “Proceedings of the Geological Society,” vol. ii, p. 446.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valley of Coquimbo._—The narrow coast-plain sends, as before stated,\r\nan arm, or more correctly a fringe, on both sides, but chiefly on the\r\nsouthern side, several miles up the valley. These fringes are worn into\r\nsteps or terraces, which present a most remarkable appearance, and have\r\nbeen compared (though not very correctly) by Captain Basil\r\nHall, to the parallel roads of Glen Roy in Scotland: their origin has\r\nbeen ably discussed by Mr. Lyell.[18] The first section which I will\r\ngive (Figure 9), is not drawn across the valley, but in an east and\r\nwest line at its mouth, where the step-formed terraces debouch and\r\npresent their very gently inclined surfaces towards the Pacific.\r\n\r\n [18] “Principles of Geology” (1st edit.), vol. iii, p. 131.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9\r\nEast and west section through the terraces at Coquimbo, where they\r\ndebouch from the valley, and front the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: East and west section through terraces at Coquimbo.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom plain (A) is about a mile in width, and rises quite\r\ninsensibly from the beach to a height of twenty-five feet at the foot\r\nof the next plain; it is sandy, and abundantly strewed with shells.\r\n\r\nPlain or terrace B is of small extent, and is almost concealed by the\r\nhouses of the town, as is likewise the escarpment of terrace C. On both\r\nsides of a ravine, two miles south of the town, there are two little\r\nterraces, one above the other, evidently corresponding with B and C;\r\nand on them marine remains of the species already enumerated were\r\nplentiful. Terrace E is very narrow, but quite distinct and level; a\r\nlittle southward of the town there were traces of a terrace D\r\nintermediate between E and C. Terrace F is part of the fringe-like\r\nplain, which stretches for the eleven miles along the coast; it is here\r\ncomposed of shingle, and is 100 feet higher than where composed of\r\ncalcareous matter. This greater height is obviously due to the quantity\r\nof shingle, which at some former period has been brought down the great\r\nvalley of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nConsidering the many shells strewed over the terraces A, B, and C, and\r\na few miles southward on the calcareous plain, which is continuously\r\nunited with the upper step-like plain F, there cannot, I apprehend, be\r\nany doubt, that these six terraces have been formed by the action of\r\nthe sea; and that their five escarpments mark so many periods of\r\ncomparative rest in the elevatory movement, during which the sea wore\r\ninto the land. The elevation between these periods may have been sudden\r\nand on _an average_ not more than seventy-two feet each time, or it may\r\nhave been gradual and insensibly slow. From the shells on the three\r\nlower terraces, and on the upper one, and I may add on the three\r\ngravel-capped terraces at Conchalee, being all littoral and\r\nsub-littoral species, and from the analogical facts given at\r\nValparaiso, and lastly from the evidence of a slow rising lately or\r\nstill in progress here, it appears to me far more probable that the\r\nmovement has been slow. The existence of these successive escarpments,\r\nor old cliff-lines, is in another respect highly instructive, for they\r\nshow periods of comparative rest in the elevatory movement, and of\r\ndenudation, which would never even have been suspected from a close\r\nexamination of many miles of coast southward of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the terraces on the opposite sides of the east and west\r\nvalley of Coquimbo: the section in figure No. 10 is taken in a north\r\nand south line across the valley at a point about three miles from the\r\nsea. The valley measured from the edges of the escarpments of the upper\r\nplain FF is about a mile in width; but from the bases of the bounding\r\nmountains it is from three to four miles wide. The terraces marked with\r\nan interrogative do not exist on that side of the valley, but are\r\nintroduced merely to render the diagram more intelligible.\r\n\r\nNo. 10\r\nNorth and south section across the valley of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North and south section across the valley of Coquimbo.]\r\n\r\nTerraces marked with ? do not occur on that side of the valley, and are\r\nintroduced only to make the diagram more intelligible. A river and\r\nbottom-plain of valley C, E, and F, on the south side of valley, are\r\nrespectively, 197, 377, and 420 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n AA. The bottom of the valley, believed to be 100 feet above the sea:\r\n it is continuously united with the lowest plain A of figure No. 9.\r\n B. This terrace higher up the valley expands considerably; seaward it\r\n is soon lost, its escarpment being united with that of C: it is not\r\n developed at all on the south side of the valley.\r\n C. This terrace, like the last, is considerably expanded higher up the\r\n valley. These two terraces apparently correspond with B and C of\r\n figure No. 9.\r\n D is not well developed in the line of this section; but seaward it\r\n expands into a plain: it is not present on the south side of the\r\n valley; but it is met with, as stated under the former section, a\r\n little south of the town.\r\n E is well developed on the south side, but absent on the north side of\r\n the valley: though not continuously united with E of figure No. 9, it\r\n apparently corresponds with it.\r\n F. This is the surface-plain, and is continuously united with that\r\n which stretches like a fringe along the coast. In ascending the valley\r\n it gradually becomes narrower, and is at last, at the distance of\r\n about ten miles from the sea, reduced to a row of flat-topped patches\r\n on the sides of the mountains. None of the lower terraces extend so\r\n far up the valley.\r\n\r\nThese five terraces are formed of shingle and sand; three of them, as\r\nmarked by Captain B. Hall (namely, B, C, and F), are much more\r\nconspicuous than the others. From the marine remains copiously strewed\r\nat the mouth of the valley on the lower terraces, and southward of the\r\ntown on the upper one, they are, as before remarked, undoubtedly of\r\nmarine origin; but within the valley, and this fact well deserves\r\nnotice, at a distance of from only a mile and a half to three or four\r\nmiles from the sea, I could not find even a fragment of a shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the inclination of the terraces of Coquimbo, and on the upper and\r\nbasal edges of their escarpments not being horizontal._—The surfaces of\r\nthese terraces slope in a slight degree, as shown by the two last\r\nsections taken conjointly, both towards the centre of the valley, and\r\nseawards towards its mouth. This double or diagonal inclination, which\r\nis not the same in the several terraces, is, as we shall immediately\r\nsee, of simple explanation. There are, however, some other points which\r\nat first appear by no means obvious,—namely, first, that each terrace,\r\ntaken in its whole breadth from the summit-edge of one escarpment to\r\nthe base of that above it, and followed up the valley, is not\r\nhorizontal; nor have the several terraces, when followed up the valley,\r\nall the same inclination; thus I found the terraces C, E, and F,\r\nmeasured at a point about two miles from the mouth of the valley, stood\r\nseverally between fifty-six to seventy-seven feet higher than at the\r\nmouth. Again, if we look to any one line of cliff or escarpment,\r\nneither its summit-edge nor its base is horizontal. On the theory of\r\nthe terraces having been formed during a slow and equable rise of the\r\nland, with as many intervals of rest as there are escarpments, it\r\nappears at first very surprising that horizontal lines of some kind\r\nshould not have been left on the land.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the diagonal inclination in the different terraces\r\nbeing different,—in some being directed more towards the middle of the\r\nvalley, in others more towards its mouth,—naturally follows on the view\r\nof each terrace, being an accumulation of successive beach-lines round\r\nbays, which must have been of different forms and sizes when the land\r\nstood at different levels: for if we look to the actual beach of a\r\nnarrow creek, its slope is directed towards the middle; whereas, in an\r\nopen bay, or slight concavity on a coast, the slope is towards the\r\nmouth, that is, almost directly seaward; hence as a bay alters in form\r\nand size, so will the direction of the inclination of its successive\r\nbeaches become changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A bay in the district which has begun slowly rising.]\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to trace any one of the many beach-lines, composing\r\neach sloping terrace, it would of course be horizontal; but the only\r\nlines of demarcation are the summit and basal edges of the escarpments.\r\nNow the summit-edge of one of these escarpments marks the furthest line\r\nor point to which the sea has cut into a mass of gravel sloping\r\nseaward; and as the sea will generally have greater power at the mouth\r\nthan at the protected head of the bay, so will the escarpment at the\r\nmouth be cut deeper into the land, and its summit-edge be higher;\r\nconsequently it will not be horizontal. With respect to the basal or\r\nlower edges of the escarpments, from picturing in one’s mind ancient\r\nbays _ entirely_ surrounded at successive periods by cliff-formed\r\nshores, one’s first impression is that they at least necessarily must\r\nbe horizontal, if the elevation has been horizontal. But here is a\r\nfallacy: for after the sea has, during a cessation of the elevation,\r\nworn cliffs all round the shores of a bay, when the movement\r\nrecommences, and especially if it recommences slowly, it might well\r\nhappen that, at the exposed mouth of the bay, the waves might continue\r\nfor some time wearing into the land, whilst in the protected and upper\r\nparts\r\nsuccessive beach-lines might be accumulating in a sloping surface or\r\nterrace at the foot of the cliffs which had been lately reached: hence,\r\nsupposing the whole line of escarpment to be finally uplifted above the\r\nreach of the sea, its basal line or foot near the mouth will run at a\r\nlower level than in the upper and protected parts of the bay;\r\nconsequently this basal line will not be horizontal. And it has already\r\nbeen shown that the summit-edges of each escarpment will generally be\r\nhigher near the mouth (from the seaward sloping land being there most\r\nexposed and cut into) than near the head of the bay; therefore the\r\ntotal height of the escarpments will be greatest near the mouth; and\r\nfurther up the old bay or valley they will on both sides generally thin\r\nout and die away: I have observed this thinning out of the successive\r\nescarpment at other places besides Coquimbo; and for a long time I was\r\nquite unable to understand its meaning. The rude diagram in Figure 11\r\nwill perhaps render what I mean more intelligible; it represents a bay\r\nin a district which has begun slowly rising. Before the movement\r\ncommenced, it is supposed that the waves had been enabled to eat into\r\nthe land and form cliffs, as far up, but with gradually diminishing\r\npower, as the points AA: after the movement had commenced and gone on\r\nfor a little time, the sea is supposed still to have retained the\r\npower, at the exposed mouth of the bay, of cutting down and into the\r\nland as it slowly emerged; but in the upper parts of the bay it is\r\nsupposed soon to have lost this power, owing to the more protected\r\nsituation and to the quantity of detritus brought down by the river;\r\nconsequently low land was there accumulated. As this low land was\r\nformed during a slow elevatory movement, its surface will gently slope\r\nupwards from the beach on all sides. Now, let us imagine the bay, not\r\nto make the diagram more complicated, suddenly converted into a valley:\r\nthe basal line of the cliffs will of course be horizontal, as far as\r\nthe beach is now seen extending in the diagram; but in the upper part\r\nof the valley, this line will be higher, the level of the district\r\nhaving been raised whilst the low land was accumulating at the foot of\r\nthe inland cliffs. If, instead of the bay in the diagram being suddenly\r\nconverted into a valley, we suppose with much more probability it to be\r\nupraised slowly, then the waves in the upper parts of the bay will\r\ncontinue very gradually to fail to reach the cliffs, which are now in\r\nthe diagram represented as washed by the sea, and which, consequently,\r\nwill be left standing higher and higher above its level; whilst at the\r\nstill exposed mouth, it might well happen that the waves might be\r\nenabled to cut deeper and deeper, both down and into the cliffs, as the\r\nland slowly rose.\r\n\r\nThe greater or lesser destroying power of the waves at the mouths of\r\nsuccessive bays, comparatively with this same power in their upper and\r\nprotected parts, will vary as the bays become changed in form and size,\r\nand therefore at different levels, at their mouths and heads, more or\r\nless of the surfaces between the escarpments (that is, the accumulated\r\nbeach-lines or terraces) will be left undestroyed: from what has gone\r\nbefore we can see that, according as the elevatory movements after each\r\ncessation recommence more or less slowly, according to the amount of\r\ndetritus delivered by the river at the heads of the successive bays,\r\nand according to the degree of protection afforded by their altered\r\nforms, so will a greater or less extent of terrace be accumulated in\r\nthe upper part, to which there will be no surface at a corresponding\r\nlevel at the mouth: hence we can perceive why no one terrace, taken in\r\nits whole breadth and followed up the valley, is horizontal, though\r\neach separate beach-line must have been so; and why the inclination of\r\nthe several terraces, both transversely, and longitudinally up the\r\nvalley, is not alike.\r\n\r\nI have entered into this case in some detail, for I was long perplexed\r\n(and others have felt the same difficulty) in understanding how, on the\r\nidea of an equable elevation with the sea at intervals eating into the\r\nland, it came that neither the terraces nor the upper nor lower edges\r\nof the escarpments were horizontal. Along lines of coast, even of great\r\nlengths, such as that of Patagonia, if they are nearly uniformly\r\nexposed, the corroding power of the waves will be checked and conquered\r\nby the elevatory movement, as often as it recommences, at about the\r\nsame period; and hence the terraces, or accumulated beach-lines, will\r\ncommence being formed at nearly the same levels: at each succeeding\r\nperiod of rest, they will, also, be eaten into at nearly the same rate,\r\nand consequently there will be a much closer coincidence in their\r\nlevels and inclinations, than in the terraces and escarpments formed\r\nround bays with their different parts very differently exposed to the\r\naction of the sea. It is only where the waves are enabled, after a long\r\nlapse of time, slowly to corrode hard rocks, or to throw up, owing to\r\nthe supply of sediment being small and to the surface being steeply\r\ninclined, a narrow beach or mound, that we can expect, as at Glen Roy\r\nin Scotland,[19] a distinct line marking an old sea-level, and which\r\nwill be strictly horizontal, if the subsequent elevatory movements have\r\nbeen so: for in these cases no discernible effects will be produced,\r\nexcept during the long intervening periods of rest; whereas in the case\r\nof step-formed coasts, such as those described in this and the\r\npreceding chapter, the terraces themselves are accumulated during the\r\nslow elevatory process, the accumulation commencing sooner in protected\r\nthan in exposed situations, and sooner where there is copious supply of\r\ndetritus than where there is little; on the other hand, the steps or\r\nescarpments are formed during the stationary periods, and are more\r\ndeeply cut down and into the coast-land in exposed than in protected\r\nsituations;—the cutting action, moreover, being prolonged in the most\r\nexposed parts, both during the beginning and ending, if slow, of the\r\nupward movement.\r\n\r\n [19] “Philosophical Transactions,” 1839, p. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the foregoing discussion I have assumed the elevation to\r\nhave been horizontal, it may be suspected, from the considerable\r\nseaward slope of the terraces, both up the valley of S. Cruz and up\r\nthat of Coquimbo, that the rising has been greater inland than nearer\r\nthe coast. There is reason to believe,[20] from the effects produced on\r\nthe water-course of a mill during the earthquake of 1822 in Chile, that\r\nthe upheaval one mile inland was nearly double, namely, between five\r\nand seven feet, to what it was on the Pacific. We know, also, from the\r\nadmirable researches of M. Bravais,[21] that in Scandinavia the ancient\r\nsea-beaches gently slope from the interior mountain-ranges towards the\r\ncoast, and that they are not parallel one to the other showing that the\r\nproportional difference in the amount of elevation on the coast and in\r\nthe interior, varied at different periods.\r\n\r\n [20] Mr. Place in the _Quarterly Journal of Science,_ 1824, vol. xvii,\r\n p. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] “Voyages de la Comm. du Nord,” etc., also “Comptes Rendus,” Oct.\r\n 1842.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo to Guasco._—In this distance of ninety miles, I found in\r\nalmost every part marine shells up to a height of apparently from two\r\nhundred to three hundred feet. The desert plain near Choros is thus\r\ncovered; it is bounded by the escarpment of a higher plain, consisting\r\nof pale-coloured, earthy, calcareous stone, like that of Coquimbo, with\r\nthe same recent shells embedded in it. In the valley of Chaneral, a\r\nsimilar bed occurs in which, differently from that of Coquimbo, I\r\nobserved many shells of the Concholepas: near Guasco the same\r\ncalcareous bed is likewise met with.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of Guasco, the step-formed terraces of gravel are\r\ndisplaced in a more striking manner than at any other point. I followed\r\nthe valley for thirty-seven miles (as reckoned by the inhabitants) from\r\nthe coast to Ballenar; in nearly the whole of this distance, five grand\r\nterraces, running at corresponding heights on both sides of the broad\r\nvalley, are more conspicuous than the three best-developed ones at\r\nCoquimbo. They give to the landscape the most singular and formal\r\naspect; and when the clouds hung low, hiding the neighbouring\r\nmountains, the valley resembled in the most striking manner that of\r\nSanta Cruz. The whole thickness of these terraces or plains seems\r\ncomposed of gravel, rather firmly aggregated together, with occasional\r\nparting seams of clay: the pebbles on the upper plain are often\r\nwhitewashed with an aluminous substance, as in Patagonia. Near the\r\ncoast I observed many sea-shells on the lower plains. At Freyrina\r\n(twelve miles up the valley), there are six terraces beside the\r\nbottom-surface of the valley: the two lower ones are here only from two\r\nhundred to three hundred yards in width, but higher up the valley they\r\nexpand into plains; the third terrace is generally narrow; the fourth I\r\nsaw only in one place, but there it was distinct for the length of a\r\nmile; the fifth is very broad; the sixth is the summit-plain, which\r\nexpands inland into a great basin. Not having a barometer with me, I\r\ndid not ascertain the height of these plains, but they appeared\r\nconsiderably higher than those at Coquimbo. Their width varies much,\r\nsometimes being very broad, and sometimes contracting into mere fringes\r\nof separate flat-topped projections, and then quite disappearing: at\r\nthe one spot, where the fourth terrace was visible, the whole six\r\nterraces were cut off for a short space by one single bold escarpment.\r\nNear Ballenar (thirty-seven miles from the mouth of the river), the\r\nvalley between the summit-edges of the highest escarpments is several\r\nmiles in width, and the five terraces on both sides are broadly\r\ndeveloped: the highest cannot be less than six hundred feet above the\r\nbed of the river, which itself must, I conceive, be some hundred feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nNo. 12\r\nNorth and south section across the valley of Guasco, and of a plain\r\nnorth of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North and south section across the valley of Guasco.]\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the valley the summit-plain of gravel (A) has\r\ntwo escarpments, one facing the valley, and the other a great\r\nbasin-like plain (B), which stretches for several leagues northward.\r\nThis narrow plain (A) with the double escarpment, evidently once formed\r\na spit or promontory of gravel, projecting into and dividing two great\r\nbays, and subsequently was worn on both sides into steep cliffs.\r\nWhether the several escarpments in this valley were formed during the\r\nsame stationary periods with those of Coquimbo, I will not pretend to\r\nconjecture; but if so the intervening and subsequent elevatory\r\nmovements must have been here much more energetic, for these plains\r\ncertainly stand at a much higher level than do those of Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n_Copiapo._—From Guasco to Copiapo, I followed the road near the foot of\r\nthe Cordillera, and therefore saw no upraised remains. At the mouth,\r\nhowever, of the valley of Copiapo there is a plain, estimated by\r\nMeyen[22] between fifty and seventy feet in height, of which the upper\r\npart consists chiefly of gravel, abounding with recent shells, chiefly\r\nof the Concholepas, _Venus Dombeyi_, and _Calyptræa trochiformis._ A\r\nlittle\r\ninland, on a plain estimated by myself at nearly three hundred feet,\r\nthe upper stratum was formed of broken shells and sand cemented by\r\nwhite calcareous matter, and abounding with embedded recent shells, of\r\nwhich the _Mulinia Byronensis_ and _Pecten purpuratus_ were the most\r\nnumerous. The lower plain stretches for some miles southward, and for\r\nan unknown distance northward, but not far up the valley; its seaward\r\nface, according to Meyen, is worn into caves above the level of the\r\npresent beach. The valley of Copiapo is much less steeply inclined and\r\nless direct in its course than any other valley which I saw in Chile;\r\nand its bottom does not generally consist of gravel: there are no\r\nstep-formed terraces in it, except at one spot near the mouth of the\r\ngreat lateral valley of the Despoblado where there are only two, one\r\nabove the other: lower down the valley, in one place I observed that\r\nthe solid rock had been cut into the shape of a beach, and was smoothed\r\nover with shingle.\r\n\r\n [22] “Reise um die Erde,” Th. I, s. 372, _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthward of Copiapo, in lat. 26° S., the old voyager Wafer[23] found\r\nimmense numbers of sea-shells some miles from the coast. At Cobija\r\n(lat. 22° 34′) M. d’Orbigny observed beds of gravel and broken shells,\r\ncontaining ten species of recent shells; he also found, on projecting\r\npoints of porphyry, at a height of 300 feet, shells of Concholepas,\r\nChiton, Calyptræa, Fissurella, and Patella, still attached to the spots\r\non which they had lived. M. d’Orbigny argues from this fact, that the\r\nelevation must have been great and sudden:[24] to me it appears far\r\nmore probable that the movement was gradual, with small starts as\r\nduring the earthquakes of 1822 and 1835, by which whole beds of shells\r\nattached to the rocks were lifted above the subsequent reach of the\r\nwaves. M. d’Orbigny also found rolled pebbles extending up the mountain\r\nto a height of at least six hundred feet. At Iquique (lat. 20° 12′ S.),\r\nin a great accumulation of sand, at a height estimated between one\r\nhundred and fifty and two hundred feet, I observed many large\r\nsea-shells which I thought could not have been blown up by the wind to\r\nthat height. Mr. J. H. Blake has lately[25] described these\r\nshells: he states that “inland toward the mountains they form a compact\r\nuniform bed, scarcely a trace of the original shells being discernible;\r\nbut as we approach the shore, the forms become gradually more distinct\r\ntill we meet with the living shells on the coast.” This interesting\r\nobservation, showing by the gradual decay of the shells how slowly and\r\ngradually the coast must have been uplifted, we shall presently see\r\nfully confirmed at Lima. At Arica (lat. 18° 28′), M. d’Orbigny[26]\r\nfound a great range of sand-dunes, fourteen leagues in length,\r\nstretching towards Tacna, including recent shells and bones of Cetacea,\r\nand reaching up to a height of 300 feet above the sea. Lieutenant\r\nFreyer has given some more precise facts: he states[27] that the Morro\r\nof Arica is about four hundred feet high; it is worn into obscure\r\nterraces, on the bare rock of which he found Balini and Milleporæ\r\nadhering. At the height of between twenty and thirty feet the shells\r\nand corals were in a quite fresh state, but at fifty feet they were\r\nmuch abraded; there were, however, traces of organic remains at greater\r\nheights. On the road from Tacna to Arequipa, between Loquimbo and\r\nMoquegua, Mr. M. Hamilton[28] found numerous recent sea shells in sand,\r\nat a considerable distance from the sea.\r\n\r\n [23] Burnett’s “Collection of Voyages,” vol. iv, p. 193.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] “Voyage, Part Géolog.,” p. 94. M. d’Orbigny (p. 98), in summing\r\n up, says: “S’il est certain (as he believes) que tous les terrains en\r\n pente, compris entre la mer et les montagnes sont l’ancien rivage de\r\n la mer, on doit supposer, pour l’ensemble, un exhaussement que ce ne\r\n serait pas moindre de deux cent mètres; il faudrait supposer encore\r\n que ce soulèvement n’a point été graduel; . . . mais qu’il résulterait\r\n d’une seule et même cause fortuite,” etc. Now, on this view, when the\r\n sea was forming the beach at the foot of the mountains, many shells of\r\n Concholepas, Chiton, Calyptræa, Fissurella, and Patella (which are\r\n known to live close to the beach), were attached to rocks at a depth\r\n of 300 feet, and at a depth of 600 feet several of these same shells\r\n were accumulating in great numbers in horizontal beds. From what I\r\n have myself seen in dredging, I believe this to be improbable in the\r\n highest degree, if not impossible; and I think everyone who has read\r\n Professor E. Forbes’s excellent researches on the subject, will\r\n without hesitation agree in this conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] _Silliman’s Amer.

Journ.,_ vol. xxx, p. 155.\r\n\r\n_Lima._\r\n\r\nNorthward of Arica, I know nothing of the coast for about a space of\r\nfive degrees of latitude; but near Callao, the port of Lima, there is\r\nabundant and very curious evidence of the elevation of the land. The\r\nisland of San Lorenzo is upwards of one thousand feet high; the basset\r\nedges of the strata composing the lower part are worn into three\r\nobscure, narrow, sloping steps or ledges, which can be seen only when\r\nstanding on them: they probably resemble those described by Lieutenant\r\nFreyer at Arica. The surface of the lower ledge, which extends from a\r\nlow cliff overhanging the sea to the foot of the next upper escarpment,\r\nis covered by an enormous accumulation of recent shells.[29] The bed is\r\nlevel, and in some parts more than two feet in thickness; I traced it\r\nover a space of one mile in length, and heard of it in other places:\r\nthe uppermost part is eighty-five feet by the barometer above\r\nhigh-water mark. The shells are packed together, but not stratified:\r\nthey are mingled with earth and stones, and are generally covered by a\r\nfew inches of detritus; they rest on a mass of nearly angular fragments\r\nof the underlying sandstone, sometimes cemented together by common\r\nsalt. I collected eighteen species of shells of all ages and sizes.\r\nSeveral of the univalves had evidently long lain dead at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, for their _ insides_ were incrusted with Balani and Serpulæ.\r\nAll, according to Mr. G.B. Sowerby, are recent species: they consist\r\nof:—\r\n\r\nMytilus Magellanicus: same as that found at Valparaiso, and there\r\nstated to be probably distinct from the true _M. Magellanicus_ of the\r\neast coast.\r\n\r\nVenus costellata, Sowerby “Zoological Proceedings.”\r\n\r\nPecten purpuratus, Lam.\r\n\r\nChama, probably echinulata, Brod.\r\n\r\nCalyptræa Byronensis, Gray.\r\n\r\nCalyptræa radians (Trochus, Lam.)\r\n\r\nFissurella affinis, Gray.\r\n\r\nFissurella biradiata, Trembly.\r\n\r\nPurpura chocolatta, Duclos.\r\n\r\nPurpura Peruviana, Gray.\r\n\r\nPurpura labiata, Gray.\r\n\r\nPurpura buxea (Murex, Brod.).\r\n\r\nConcholepas Peruviana.\r\n\r\nNassa, related to reticulata.\r\n\r\nTriton rudis, Brod.\r\n\r\nTrochus, not yet described, but well-known and very common.\r\n\r\nand 18. Balanus, two species, both common on the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n [29] M. Chevalier, in the “Voyage of the _Bonite_,” observed these\r\n shells; but his specimens were lost.—“L’Institut,” 1838, p. 151.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese upraised shells appear to be nearly in the same proportional\r\nnumbers—with the exception of the Crepidulæ being more numerous—with\r\nthose on the existing beach. The state of preservation of the different\r\nspecies differed much; but most of them were much corroded, brittle,\r\nand bleached: the upper and lower surfaces of the Concholepas had\r\ngenerally quite scaled off: some of the Trochi and Fissurellæ still\r\npartially retain their colours. It is remarkable that these shells,\r\ntaken all together, have fully as ancient an appearance, although the\r\nextremely arid climate appears highly favourable for their\r\npreservation, as those from 1,300 feet at Valparaiso, and certainly a\r\nmore ancient appearance than those from five to six hundred feet from\r\nValparaiso and Concepcion; at which places I have seen grass and other\r\nvegetables actually growing out of the shells. Many of the univalves\r\nhere at San Lorenzo were filled with, and united together by, pure\r\nsalt, probably left by the evaporation of the sea-spray, as the land\r\nslowly emerged.[30] On the highest parts of the ledge, small fragments\r\nof the shells were mingled with, and evidently in process of reduction\r\ninto, a yellowish-white, soft, calcareous powder, tasting strongly of\r\nsalt, and in some places as fine as prepared medicinal chalk.\r\n\r\n [30] The underlying sandstone contains true layers of salt; so that\r\n the salt may possibly have come from the beds in the higher parts of\r\n the island; but I think more probably from the sea-spray. It is\r\n generally asserted that rain never falls on the coast of Peru; but\r\n this is not quite accurate; for, on several days, during our visit,\r\n the so-called Peruvian dew fell in sufficient quantity to make the\r\n streets muddy, and it would certainly have washed so deliquescent a\r\n substance as salt into the soil. I state this because M. d’Orbigny, in\r\n discussing an analogous subject, supposes that I had forgotten that it\r\n never rains on this whole line of coast. See Ulloa’s “Voyage” (vol.\r\n ii, Eng. Trans., p. 67) for an account of the muddy streets of Lima,\r\n and on the continuance of the mists during the whole winter. Rain,\r\n also, falls at rare intervals even in the driest districts, as, for\r\n instance, during forty days, in 1726, at Chocope (7° 46′); this rain\r\n entirely ruined (“Ulloa,” etc., p. 18) the mud houses of the\r\n inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossil-remains of human art._—In the midst of these shells on San\r\nLorenzo, I found light corallines, the horny ovule-cases of Mollusca,\r\nroots of seaweed,[31] bones of birds, the heads of Indian corn and\r\nother vegetable matter, a piece of woven rushes, and another of nearly\r\ndecayed _cotton_ string. I extracted these remains by digging a hole,\r\non a level spot; and they had all indisputably been embedded with the\r\nshells. I compared the plaited rush, the _cotton_ string, and Indian\r\ncorn, at the house of an antiquary, with similar objects, taken from\r\nthe Huacas or burial-grounds of the ancient Peruvians, and they were\r\nundistinguishable; it should be observed that the Peruvians used string\r\nonly of cotton. The small quantity of sand or gravel with the shells,\r\nthe absence of large stones, the width and thickness of the bed, and\r\nthe time requisite for a ledge to be cut into the sandstone, all show\r\nthat these remains were not thrown high up by an earthquake-wave: on\r\nthe other hand, these facts, together with the number of dead shells,\r\nand of floating objects, both marine and terrestrial, both natural and\r\nhuman, render it almost certain that they were accumulated on a true\r\nbeach, since upraised eighty-five feet, and upraised this much since\r\n_Indian man inhabited Peru._ The elevation may have been, either by\r\nseveral small sudden starts, or quite gradual; in this latter case the\r\nunrolled shells having been thrown up during gales beyond the reach of\r\nthe waves which afterwards broke on the slowly emerging land. I have\r\nmade these remarks, chiefly because I was at first surprised at the\r\ncomplete difference in nature, between this broad, smooth, upraised bed\r\nof shells, and the present shingle-beach at the foot of the low\r\nsandstone-cliffs; but a beach formed, when the sea is cutting into the\r\nland, as is shown now to be the case by the low bare sandstone-cliffs,\r\nought not to be compared with a beach accumulated on a gently inclined\r\nrocky surface, at a period when the sea (probably owing to the\r\nelevatory movement in process) was not able to eat into the land. With\r\nrespect to the mass of nearly angular, salt-cemented fragments of\r\nsandstone, which lie under the shells, and which are so unlike the\r\nmaterials of an ordinary sea-beach; I think it probable after having\r\nseen the remarkable effects[32] of the earthquake of 1835, in\r\nabsolutely shattering as if by gunpowder the _surface_ of the primary\r\nrocks near Concepcion, that a smooth bare surface of stone was left by\r\nthe sea covered by the shelly mass, and that afterwards when upraised,\r\nit was superficially shattered by the severe shocks so often\r\nexperienced here.\r\n\r\n [31] Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill found pieces of seaweed in an upraised\r\n pleistocene deposit in Scotland. See his admirable Paper in the _Edin.\r\n New Phil. Journal,_ vol. xxv, p. 384.\r\n\r\n\r\n [32] I have described this in my “Journal of Researches,” p. 303, 2nd\r\n edit.\r\n\r\nThe very low land surrounding the town of Callao, is to the south\r\njoined by an obscure escarpment to a higher plain (south of Bella\r\nVista), which stretches along the coast for a length of about eight\r\nmiles. This plain appears to the eye quite level; but the sea-cliffs\r\nshow that its height varies (as far as I could estimate) from seventy\r\nto one hundred and twenty feet. It is composed of thin, sometimes\r\nwaving, beds of clay, often of bright red and yellow colours, of layers\r\nof impure sand, and in one part with a great stratified mass of\r\ngranitic pebbles. These\r\nbeds are capped by a remarkable mass, varying from two to six feet in\r\nthickness, of reddish loam or mud, containing many scattered and broken\r\nfragments of recent marine shells, sometimes though rarely single large\r\nround pebble, more frequently short irregular layers of fine gravel,\r\nand very many pieces of red coarse earthenware, which from their\r\ncurvatures must once have formed parts of large vessels. The\r\nearthenware is of Indian manufacture; and I found exactly similar\r\npieces accidentally included within the bricks, of which the\r\nneighbouring ancient Peruvian burial-mounds are built. These fragments\r\nabounded in such numbers in certain spots, that it appeared as if\r\nwaggon-loads of earthenware had been smashed to pieces. The broken\r\nsea-shells and pottery are strewed both on the surface, and throughout\r\nthe whole thickness of this upper loamy mass. I found them wherever I\r\nexamined the cliffs, for a space of between two and three miles, and\r\nfor half a mile inland; and there can be little doubt that this same\r\nbed extends with a smooth surface several miles further over the entire\r\nplain. Besides the little included irregular layers of small pebbles,\r\nthere are occasionally very obscure traces of stratification.\r\n\r\nAt one of the highest parts of the cliff, estimated 120 feet above the\r\nsea, where a little ravine came down, there were two sections, at right\r\nangles to each other, of the floor of a shed or building. In both\r\nsections or faces, two rows, one over the other, of large round stones\r\ncould be distinctly seen; they were packed close together on an\r\nartificial layer of sand two inches thick, which had been placed on the\r\nnatural clay-beds; the round stones were covered by three feet in\r\nthickness of the loam with broken sea-shells and pottery. Hence, before\r\nthis widely spread-out bed of loam was deposited, it is certain that\r\nthe plain was inhabited; and it is probable, from the broken vessels\r\nbeing so much more abundant in certain spots than in others, and from\r\nthe underlying clay being fitted for their manufacture, that the kilns\r\nstood here.\r\n\r\nThe smoothness and wide extent of the plain, the bulk of matter\r\ndeposited, and the obscure traces of stratification seem to indicate\r\nthat the loam was deposited under water; on the other hand, the\r\npresence of sea-shells, their broken state, the pebbles of various\r\nsizes, and the artificial floor of round stones, almost prove that it\r\nmust have originated in a rush of water from the sea over the land. The\r\nheight of the plain, namely, 120 feet, renders it improbable that an\r\nearthquake-wave, vast as some have here been, could have broken over\r\nthe surface at its present level; but when the land stood eighty-five\r\nfeet lower, at the period when the shells were thrown up on the ledge\r\nat S. Lorenzo, and when as we know man inhabited this district, such an\r\nevent might well have occurred; and if we may further suppose, that the\r\nplain was at that time converted into a temporary lake, as actually\r\noccurred, during the earthquakes of 1713 and 1746, in the case of the\r\nlow land round Callao owing to its being encircled by a high\r\nshingle-beach, all the appearances above described will be perfectly\r\nexplained. I must add, that at a lower level near the point where the\r\npresent low land round Callao joins the higher plain, there are\r\nappearances of two\r\ndistinct deposits both apparently formed by debacles: in the upper one,\r\na horse’s tooth and a dog’s jaw were embedded; so that both must have\r\nbeen formed after the settlement of the Spaniards: according to Acosta,\r\nthe earthquake-wave of 1586 rose eighty-four feet.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Callao do not believe, as far as I could ascertain,\r\nthat any change in level is now in progress. The great fragments of\r\nbrickwork, which it is asserted can be seen at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand which have been adduced as a proof of a late subsidence, are, as I\r\nam informed by Mr. Gill, a resident engineer, loose fragments; this is\r\nprobable, for I found on the beach, and not near the remains of any\r\nbuilding, masses of brickwork, three and four feet square, which had\r\nbeen washed into their present places, and smoothed over with shingle\r\nduring the earthquake of 1746. The spit of land, on which the ruins of\r\n_Old_ Callao stand, is so extremely low and narrow, that it is\r\nimprobable in the highest degree that a town should have been founded\r\non it in its present state; and I have lately heard[33] that M. Tschudi\r\nhas come to the conclusion, from a comparison of old with modern\r\ncharts, that the coast both south and north of Callao has subsided. I\r\nhave shown that the island of San Lorenzo has been upraised eighty-five\r\nfeet since the Peruvians inhabited this country; and whatever may have\r\nbeen the amount of recent subsidence, by so much more must the\r\nelevation have exceeded the eighty-five feet. In several places[34] in\r\nthis neighbourhood, marks of sea-action have been observed: Ulloa gives\r\na detailed account of such appearances at a point five leagues\r\nnorthward of Callao: Mr. Cruikshank found near Lima successive lines of\r\nsea-cliffs, with rounded blocks at their bases, at a height of 700 feet\r\nabove the present level of the sea.\r\n\r\n [33] I am indebted for this fact to Dr. E. Dieffenbach. I may add that\r\n there is a tradition, that the islands of San Lorenzo and Fronton were\r\n once joined, and that the channel between San Lorenzo and the\r\n mainland, now above two miles in width, was so narrow that cattle used\r\n to swim over.\r\n\r\n\r\n [34] “Observaciones sobre el Clima del Lima” par Dr. H. Unanùe, p.\r\n 4.—Ulloa’s “Voyage,” vol. ii, Eng. Trans., p. 97.—For Mr. Cruikshank’s\r\n observations, see Mr. Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” (1st edition)\r\n vol. iii, p. 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the decay of upraised sea-shells._—I have stated that many of the\r\nshells on the lower inclined ledge or terrace of San Lorenzo are\r\ncorroded in a peculiar manner, and that they have a much more ancient\r\nappearance than the same species at considerably greater heights on the\r\ncoast of Chile. I have, also, stated that these shells in the upper\r\npart of the ledge, at the height of eighty-five feet above the sea, are\r\nfalling, and in some parts are quite changed into a fine, soft, saline,\r\ncalcareous powder. The finest part of this powder has been analysed for\r\nme, at the request of Sir H. De la Beche, by the kindness of Mr.\r\nTrenham Reeks of the Museum of Economic Geology; it consists of\r\ncarbonate of lime in abundance, of sulphate and muriate of lime, and of\r\nmuriate and sulphate of soda. The carbonate of lime is obviously\r\nderived from the shells; and common salt is so abundant in parts of\r\nthe bed, that, as before remarked, the univalves are often filled with\r\nit. The sulphate of lime may have been derived, as has probably the\r\ncommon salt, from the evaporation of the sea-spray, during the\r\nemergence of the land; for sulphate of lime is now copiously deposited\r\nfrom the spray on the shores of Ascension.[35] The other saline bodies\r\nmay perhaps have been partially thus derived, but chiefly, as I\r\nconclude from the following facts, through a different means.\r\n\r\n [35] See “Volcanic Islands,” etc., by the Author.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn most parts of the second ledge or old sea-beach, at a height of 170\r\nfeet, there is a layer of white powder of variable thickness, as much\r\nin some parts as two inches, lying on the angular, salt-cemented\r\nfragments of sandstone and under about four inches of earth, which\r\npowder, from its close resemblance in nature to the upper and most\r\ndecayed parts of the shelly mass, I can hardly doubt originally existed\r\nas a bed of shells, now much collapsed and quite disintegrated. I could\r\nnot discover with the microscope a trace of organic structure in it;\r\nbut its chemical constituents, according to Mr. Reeks, are the same as\r\nin the powder extracted from amongst the decaying shells on the lower\r\nledge, with the marked exception that the carbonate of lime is present\r\nin only very small quantity. On the third and highest ledge, I observed\r\nsome of this powder in a similar position, and likewise occasionally in\r\nsmall patches at considerably greater heights near the summit of the\r\nisland. At Iquique, where the whole face of the country is covered by a\r\nhighly saliferous alluvium, and where the climate is extremely dry, we\r\nhave seen that, according to Mr. Blake, the shells which are perfect\r\nnear the beach become, in ascending, gradually less and less perfect,\r\nuntil scarcely a trace of their original structure can be discovered.\r\nIt is known that carbonate of lime and common salt left in a mass\r\ntogether,[36] and slightly moistened, partially decompose each other:\r\nnow we have at San Lorenzo and at Iquique, in the shells and salt\r\npacked together, and occasionally moistened by the so-called Peruvian\r\ndew, the proper elements for this action. We can thus understand the\r\npeculiar corroded appearance of the shells on San Lorenzo, and the\r\ngreat decrease of quantity in the carbonate of lime in the powder on\r\nthe upper ledge. There is, however, a great difficulty on this view,\r\nfor the resultant salts should be carbonate of soda and muriate of\r\nlime; the latter is present, but not the carbonate of soda. Hence I am\r\nled to the perhaps unauthorised conjecture (which I shall hereafter\r\nhave to refer to) that the carbonate of soda, by some unexplained\r\nmeans, becomes converted into a sulphate. If the above remarks be just,\r\nwe are led to the very unexpected conclusion, that a dry climate, by\r\nleaving the salt from the sea-spray\r\nundissolved, is much less favourable to the preservation of upraised\r\nshells than a humid climate. However this may be, it is interesting to\r\nknow the manner in which masses of shells, gradually upraised above the\r\nsea-level, decay and finally disappear.\r\n\r\n [36] I am informed by Dr. Kane, through Mr. Reeks, that a manufactory\r\n was established on this principle in France, but failed from the small\r\n quantity of carbonate of soda produced. Sprengel (_Gardeners’ Chron.,_\r\n 1845, p. 157) states, that salt and carbonate of lime are liable to\r\n mutual decomposition in the soil. Sir H. De la Beche informs me, that\r\n calcareous rocks washed by the spray of the sea, are often corroded in\r\n a peculiar manner; see also on this latter subject _Gardeners’\r\n Chron.,_ p. 675, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary on the recent elevation of the west coast of South\r\nAmerica._—We have seen that upraised marine remains occur at intervals,\r\nand in some parts almost continuously, from lat. 45° 35′ to 12° S.,\r\nalong the shores of the Pacific. This is a distance, in a north and\r\nsouth line, of 2,075 geographical miles. From Byron’s observations, the\r\nelevation has no doubt extended sixty miles further south; and from the\r\nsimilarity in the form of the country near Lima, it has probably\r\nextended many leagues further north.[37] Along this great line of\r\ncoast, besides the organic remains, there are in very many parts, marks\r\nof erosion, caves, ancient beaches, sand-dunes, and successive terraces\r\nof gravel, all above the present level of the sea. From the steepness\r\nof the land on this side of the continent, shells have rarely been\r\nfound at greater distances inland than from two to three leagues; but\r\nthe marks of sea-action are evident farther from the coast; for\r\ninstance, in the valley of Guasco, at a distance of between thirty and\r\nforty miles. Judging from the upraised shells alone, the elevation in\r\nChiloe has been 350 feet, at Concepcion certainly 625 feet; and by\r\nestimation 1,000 feet; at Valparaiso 1,300 feet; at Coquimbo 252 feet;\r\nnorthward of this place, sea-shells have not, I believe, been found\r\nabove 300 feet; and at Lima they were falling into decay (hastened\r\nprobably by the salt) at 85 feet. Not only has this amount of elevation\r\ntaken place within the period of existing Mollusca and Cirripedes; but\r\ntheir proportional numbers in the neighbouring sea have in most cases\r\nremained the same. Near Lima, however, a small change in this respect\r\nbetween the living and the upraised was observed: at Coquimbo this was\r\nmore evident, all the shells being existing species, but with those\r\nembedded in the uppermost calcareous plain not approximating so closely\r\nin proportional numbers, as do those that lie loose on its surface at\r\nthe height of 252 feet, and still less closely than those which are\r\nstrewed on the lower plains, which latter are identical in proportional\r\nnumbers with those now cast up on the beach. From this circumstance,\r\nand from not finding, upon careful examination, near Coquimbo any\r\nshells at a greater height than 252 feet, I believe that the recent\r\nelevation there has been much less than at Valparaiso, where it has\r\nbeen 1,300 feet, and I may add, than at Concepcion. This considerable\r\ninequality in the amount of elevation at Coquimbo and Valparaiso,\r\nplaces only 200 miles apart, is not improbable, considering, first, the\r\ndifference in the force and number of the shocks now yearly affecting\r\ndifferent parts of this coast; and, secondly, the fact of single areas,\r\nsuch as that of the province of Concepcion, having been uplifted very\r\nunequally during the same earthquake. It would, in most cases, be very\r\nhazardous to infer an inequality\r\nof elevation, from shells being found on the surface or in superficial\r\nbeds at different heights; for we do not know on what their rate of\r\ndecay depends; and at Coquimbo one instance out of many has been given,\r\nof a promontory, which, from the occurrence of one very small\r\ncollection of lime-cemented shells, has indisputably been elevated 242\r\nfeet, and yet on which, not even a fragment of shell could be found on\r\ncareful examination between this height and the beach, although many\r\nsites appeared very favourable for the preservation of organic remains:\r\nthe absence, also, of shells on the gravel-terraces a short distance up\r\nthe valley of Coquimbo, though abundant on the corresponding terraces\r\nat its mouth, should be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n [37] I may take this opportunity of stating that in a MS. in the\r\n Geological Society by Mr. Weaver, it is stated that beds of oysters\r\n and other recent shells are found thirty feet above the level of the\r\n sea, in many parts of Tampico, in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere are other epochs, besides that of the existence of recent\r\nMollusca, by which to judge of the changes of level on this coast. At\r\nLima, as we have just seen, the elevation has been at least eighty-five\r\nfeet, within the Indo-human period; and since the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards in 1530, there has apparently been a sinking of the surface.\r\nAt Valparaiso, in the course of 220 years, the rise must have been less\r\nthan nineteen feet; but it has been as much as from ten to eleven feet\r\nin the seventeen years subsequently to 1817, and of this rise only a\r\npart can be attributed to the earthquake of 1822, the remainder having\r\nbeen insensible and apparently still, in 1834, in progress. At Chiloe\r\nthe elevation has been gradual, and about four feet during four years.\r\nAt Coquimbo, also, it has been gradual, and in the course of 150 years\r\nhas amounted to several feet. The sudden small upheavals, accompanied\r\nby earthquakes, as in 1822 at Valparaiso, in 1835 at Concepcion, and in\r\n1837 in the Chonos Archipelago, are familiar to most geologists, but\r\nthe gradual rising of the coast of Chile has been hardly noticed; it\r\nis, however, very important, as connecting together these two orders of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Lima, having been eighty-five feet within the period of\r\nman, is the more surprising if we refer to the eastern coast of the\r\ncontinent, for at Port S. Julian, in Patagonia, there is good evidence\r\n(as we shall hereafter see) that when the land stood ninety feet lower,\r\nthe Macrauchenia, a mammiferous beast, was alive; and at Bahia Blanca,\r\nwhen it stood only a few feet lower than it now does, many gigantic\r\nquadrupeds ranged over the adjoining country. But the coast of\r\nPatagonia is some way distant from the Cordillera, and the movement at\r\nBahia Blanca is perhaps noways connected with this great range, but\r\nrather with the tertiary volcanic rocks of Banda Oriental, and\r\ntherefore the elevation at these places may have been infinitely slower\r\nthan on the coast of Peru. All such speculations, however, must be\r\nvague, for as we know with certainty that the elevation of the whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia has been interrupted by many and long pauses, who\r\nwill pretend to say that, in such cases, many and long periods of\r\nsubsidence may not also have been intercalated?\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the coast of Chile and Peru there are marks of the\r\naction of the sea at successive heights on the land, showing that the\r\nelevation has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest in the\r\nupward movement, and of denudation in the action of the sea. These\r\nare plainest at Chiloe, where, in a height of about five hundred feet,\r\nthere are three escarpments,—at Coquimbo, where in a height of 364\r\nfeet, there are five,—at Guasco, where there are six, of which five may\r\nperhaps correspond with those at Coquimbo, but if so, the subsequent\r\nand intervening elevatory movements have been here much more\r\nenergetic,—at Lima, where, in a height of about 250 feet there are\r\nthree terraces, and others, as it is asserted, at considerably greater\r\nheights. The almost entire absence of ancient marks of sea-action at\r\ndefined levels along considerable spaces of coast, as near Valparaiso\r\nand Concepcion, is highly instructive, for as it is improbable that the\r\nelevation at these places alone should have been continuous, we must\r\nattribute the absence of such marks to the nature and form of the\r\ncoast-rocks. Seeing over how many hundred miles of the coast of\r\nPatagonia, and on how many places on the shores of the Pacific, the\r\nelevatory process has been interrupted by periods of comparative rest,\r\nwe may conclude, conjointly with the evidence drawn from other quarters\r\nof the world, that the elevation of the land is generally an\r\nintermittent action. From the quantity of matter removed in the\r\nformation of the escarpments, especially of those of Patagonia, it\r\nappears that the periods of rest in the movement, and of denudation of\r\nthe land, have generally been very long. In Patagonia, we have seen\r\nthat the elevation has been equable, and the periods of denudation\r\nsynchronous over very wide spaces of coast; on the shores of the\r\nPacific, owing to the terraces chiefly occurring in the valleys, we\r\nhave not equal means of judging on this point; and the very different\r\nheights of the upraised shells at Coquimbo, Valparaiso, and Concepcion\r\nseem directly opposed to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhether on this side of the continent the elevation, between the\r\nperiods of comparative rest when the escarpments were formed, has been\r\nby small sudden starts, such as those accompanying recent earthquakes,\r\nor, as is most probable, by such starts conjointly with a gradual\r\nupward movement, or by great and sudden upheavals, I have no direct\r\nevidence. But as on the eastern coast, I was led to think, from the\r\nanalogy of the last hundred feet of elevation in La Plata, and from the\r\nnearly equal size of the pebbles over the entire width of the terraces,\r\nand from the upraised shells being all littoral species, that the\r\nelevation had been gradual; so do I on this western coast, from the\r\nanalogy of the movements now in progress, and from the vast numbers of\r\nshells now living exclusively on or close to the beach, which are\r\nstrewed over the whole surface of the land up to very considerable\r\nheights, conclude, that the movement here also has been slow and\r\ngradual, aided probably by small occasional starts. We know at least\r\nthat at Coquimbo, where five escarpments occur in a height of 364 feet,\r\nthe successive elevations, if they have been sudden, cannot have been\r\nvery great. It has, I think, been shown that the occasional\r\npreservation of shells, unrolled and unbroken, is not improbable even\r\nduring a quite gradual rising of the land; and their preservation, if\r\nthe movement has been aided by small starts, is quite conformable with\r\nwhat actually takes place during recent earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudging from the present action of the sea, along the shores of the\r\nPacific, on the deposits of its own accumulation, the present time\r\nseems in most places to be one of comparative rest in the elevatory\r\nmovement, and of denudation of the land. Undoubtedly this is the case\r\nalong the whole great length of Patagonia. At Chiloe, however, we have\r\nseen that a narrow sloping fringe, covered with vegetation, separates\r\nthe present sea-beach from a line of low cliffs, which the waves lately\r\nreached; here, then, the land is gaining in breadth and height, and the\r\npresent period is not one of rest in the elevation and of contingent\r\ndenudation; but if the rising be not prolonged at a quick rate, there\r\nis every probability that the sea will soon regain its former\r\nhorizontal limits. I observed similar low sloping fringes on several\r\nparts of the coast, both northward of Valparaiso and near Coquimbo; but\r\nat this latter place, from the change in form which the coast has\r\nundergone since the old escarpments were worn, it may be doubted\r\nwhether the sea, acting for any length of time at its present level,\r\nwould eat into the land; for it now rather tends to throw up great\r\nmasses of sand. It is from facts such as these that I have generally\r\nused the term _comparative rest_, as applied to the elevation of the\r\nland; the rest or cessation in the movement being comparative both with\r\nwhat has preceded it and followed it, and with the sea’s power of\r\ncorrosion at each spot and at each level. Near Lima, the cliff-formed\r\nshores of San Lorenzo, and on the mainland south of Callao, show that\r\nthe sea is gaining on the land; and as we have here some evidence that\r\nits surface has lately subsided or is still sinking, the periods of\r\ncomparative rest in the elevation and of contingent denudation, may\r\nprobably in many cases include periods of subsidence. It is only, as\r\nwas shown in detail when discussing the terraces of Coquimbo, when the\r\nsea with difficulty and after a long lapse of time has either corroded\r\na narrow ledge into solid rock, or has heaped up on a steep surface a\r\n_narrow_ mound of detritus, that we can confidently assert that the\r\nland at that level and at that period long remained absolutely\r\nstationary. In the case of terraces formed of gravel or sand, although\r\nthe elevation may have been strictly horizontal, it may well happen\r\nthat no one level beach-line may be traceable, and that neither the\r\nterraces themselves nor the summit nor basal edges of their escarpments\r\nmay be horizontal.\r\n\r\nFinally, comparing the extent of the elevated area, as deduced from the\r\nupraised recent organic remains, on the two sides of the continent, we\r\nhave seen that on the Atlantic, shells have been found at intervals\r\nfrom Eastern Tierra del Fuego for 1,180 miles northward, and on the\r\nPacific for a space of 2,075 miles. For a length of 775 miles, they\r\noccur in the same latitudes on both sides of the continent. Without\r\ntaking this circumstance into consideration, it is probable from the\r\nreasons assigned in the last chapter, that the entire breadth of the\r\ncontinent in Central Patagonia has been uplifted in mass; but from\r\nother reasons there given, it would be hazardous to extend this\r\nconclusion to La Plata. From the continent being narrow in the\r\nsouthern-most parts of Patagonia, and from the shells found at the\r\nInner Narrows of the Strait of Magellan, and likewise far up the valley\r\nof the Santa Cruz,\r\nit is probable that the southern part of the western coast, which was\r\nnot visited by me, has been elevated within the period of recent\r\nMollusca: if so, the shores of the Pacific have been continuously,\r\nrecently, and in a geological sense synchronously upraised, from Lima\r\nfor a length of 2,480 nautical miles southward,—a distance equal to\r\nthat from the Red Sea to the North Cape of Scandinavia!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III ON THE PLAINS AND VALLEYS OF CHILE:—SALIFEROUS SUPERFICIAL\r\nDEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasin-like plains of Chile; their drainage, their marine origin.—Marks\r\nof sea-action on the eastern flanks of the Cordillera.—Sloping\r\nterrace-like fringes of stratified shingle within the valleys of the\r\nCordillera; their marine origin.—Boulders in the valley of\r\nCachapual.—Horizontal elevation of the Cordillera.—Formation of\r\nvalleys.—Boulders moved by earthquake-waves.—Saline superficial\r\ndeposits.—Bed of nitrate of soda at Iquique.—Saline\r\nincrustations.—Salt-lakes of La Plata and Patagonia; purity of the\r\nsalt; its origin.\r\n\r\nThe space between the Cordillera and the coast of Chile is on a rude\r\naverage from eighty to above one hundred miles in width; it is formed,\r\neither of an almost continuous mass of mountains, or more commonly of\r\nseveral nearly parallel ranges, separated by plains; in the more\r\nsouthern parts of this province the mountains are quite subordinate to\r\nthe plains; in the northern part the mountains predominate.\r\n\r\nThe basin-like plains at the foot of the Cordillera are in several\r\nrespects remarkable; that on which the capital of Chile stands is\r\nfifteen miles in width, in an east and west line, and of much greater\r\nlength in a north and south line; it stands 1,750 feet above the sea;\r\nits surface appears smooth, but really falls and rises in wide gentle\r\nundulations, the hollows corresponding with the main valleys of the\r\nCordillera: the striking manner in which it abruptly comes up to the\r\nfoot of this great range has been remarked by every author[1] since the\r\ntime of Molina. Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass\r\nof pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders: near\r\nits western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay, containing\r\nsome pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes passes\r\ninto pure sand or into volcanic ashes. At Podaguel, on this western\r\nside of the plain, beds of sand are capped by a calcareous tuff, the\r\nuppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic, and the lower\r\nones white and friable, both together precisely resembling the beds at\r\nCoquimbo, which\r\ncontain recent marine shells. Abrupt, but rounded, hummocks of rock\r\nrise out of this plain: those of Sta. Lucia and S. Cristoval are formed\r\nof greenstone-porphyry almost entirely denuded of its original covering\r\nof porphyritic claystone breccia; on their summits, many fragments of\r\nrock (some of them kinds not found in situ) are coated and united\r\ntogether by a white, friable, calcareous tuff, like that found at\r\nPodaguel. When this matter was deposited on the summit of S. Cristoval,\r\nthe water must have stood 946 feet[2] above the surface of the\r\nsurrounding plain.\r\n\r\n [1] This plain is partially separated into two basins by a range of\r\n hills; the southern half, according to Meyen (“Reise um Erde,” Th. i,\r\n s. 274), falls in height, by an abrupt step, of between fifteen and\r\n twenty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Or 2,690 feet above the sea, as measured barometrically by Mr.\r\n Eck. This tuff appears to the eye nearly pure; but when placed in acid\r\n it leaves a considerable residue of sand and broken crystals,\r\n apparently of feldspar. Dr. Meyen (“Reise,” Th. i, s. 269) says he\r\n found a similar substance on the neighbouring hill of Dominico (and I\r\n found it also on the Cerro Blanco), and he attributes it to the\r\n weathering of the stone. In some places which I examined, its bulk put\r\n this view of its origin quite out of the question; and I should much\r\n doubt whether the decomposition of a porphyry would, in any case,\r\n leave a crust chiefly composed of carbonate of lime. The white crust,\r\n which is commonly seen on weathered feldspathic rocks, does not appear\r\n to contain any free carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the south this basin-like plain contracts, and rising scarcely\r\nperceptibly with a smooth surface, passes through a remarkable level\r\ngap in the mountains, forming a true land-strait, and called the\r\nAngostura. It then immediately expands into a second basin-formed\r\nplain: this again to the south contracts into another land-strait, and\r\nexpands into a third basin, which, however, falls suddenly in level\r\nabout forty feet. This third basin, to the south, likewise contracts\r\ninto a strait, and then again opens into the great plain of San\r\nFernando, stretching so far south that the snowy peaks of the distant\r\nCordillera are seen rising above its horizon as above the sea. These\r\nplains, near the Cordillera, are generally formed of a thick stratified\r\nmass of shingle;[3] in other parts, of a red sandy clay, often with an\r\nadmixture of pumiceous matter. Although these basins are connected\r\ntogether like a necklace, in a north and south line, by smooth\r\nland-straits, the streams which drain them do not all flow north and\r\nsouth, but mostly westward, through breaches worn in the bounding\r\nmountains; and in the case of the second basin, or that of Rancagua,\r\nthere are two distinct breaches. Each basin, moreover, is not drained\r\nsingly; thus, to give the most striking instance, but not the only one,\r\nin proceeding southward over the plain of Rancagua, we first find the\r\nwater flowing northward to and through the northern land-strait; then,\r\nwithout crossing any marked ridge or watershed, we see it flowing\r\nsouth-westward towards the northern one of the two breaches in the\r\nwestern mountainous boundary; and lastly, again without any ridge, it\r\nflows towards the southern breach in these same\r\nmountains. Hence the surface of this one basin-like plain, appearing to\r\nthe eye so level, has been modelled with great nicety, so that the\r\ndrainage, without any conspicuous watersheds, is directed towards three\r\nopenings in the encircling mountains.[4] The streams flowing from the\r\nsouthern basin-like plains, after passing through the breaches to the\r\nwest, unite and form the river Rapel, which enters the Pacific near\r\nNavidad. I followed the southernmost branch of this river, and found\r\nthat the basin or plain of San Fernando is continuously and smoothly\r\nunited with those plains, which were described in the Second Chapter,\r\nas being worn near the coast into successive cave-eaten escarpments,\r\nand still nearer to the coast, as being strewed with upraised recent\r\nmarine remains. I might have given descriptions of numerous other\r\nplains of the same general form, some at the foot of the Cordillera,\r\nsome near the coast, and some halfway between these points. I will\r\nallude only to one other, namely, the plain of Uspallata, lying on the\r\neastern or opposite side of the Cordillera, between that great range\r\nand the parallel lower range of Uspallata. According to Miers, its\r\nsurface is 6,000 feet above the level of the sea: it is from ten to\r\nfifteen miles in width, and is said to extend with an unbroken surface\r\nfor 180 miles northwards: it is drained by two rivers passing through\r\nbreaches in the mountains to the east. On the banks of the River\r\nMendoza it is seen to be composed of a great accumulation of stratified\r\nshingle, estimated at 400 feet in thickness. In general appearance, and\r\nin numerous points of structure, this plain closely resembles those of\r\nChile.\r\n\r\n [3] The plain of San Fernando has, according to MM. Meyen and Gay\r\n “Reise,” etc., Th. i, ss. 295 and 298, near the Cordillera, an upper\r\n step-formed plain of clay, on the surface of which they found numerous\r\n blocks of rocks, from two to three feet long, either lying single or\r\n piled in heaps, but all arranged in nearly straight lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] It appears from Captain Herbert’s account of the Diluvium of the\r\n Himalaya, (“Gleanings of Science,” Calcutta, vol. ii, p. 164), that\r\n precisely similar remarks apply to the drainage of the plains or\r\n valleys between those great mountains.\r\n\r\nThe origin and manner of formation of the thick beds of gravel, sandy\r\nclay, volcanic detritus, and calcareous tuff, composing these\r\nbasin-like plains, is very important; because, as we shall presently\r\nshow, they send arms or fringes far up the main valleys of the\r\nCordillera. Many of the inhabitants believe that these plains were once\r\noccupied by lakes, suddenly drained; but I conceive that the number of\r\nthe separate breaches at nearly the same level in the mountains\r\nsurrounding them quite precludes this idea. Had not such distinguished\r\nnaturalists as MM. Meyen and Gay stated their belief that these\r\ndeposits were left by great debacles rushing down from the Cordillera,\r\nI should not have noticed a view, which appears to me from many reasons\r\nimprobable in the highest degree—namely, from the vast accumulation of\r\n_well-rounded pebbles_—their frequent stratification with layers of\r\nsand—the overlying beds of calcareous tuff—this same substance coating\r\nand uniting the fragments of rock on the hummocks in the plain of\r\nSantiago—and lastly even from the worn, rounded, and much denuded state\r\nof these hummocks, and of the headlands which project from the\r\nsurrounding mountains. On the other hand, these several circumstances,\r\nas well as the continuous union of the basins at the foot of the\r\nCordillera, with the great plain of the Rio Rapel which still retains\r\nthe marks of sea-action\r\nat various levels, and their general similarity in form and composition\r\nwith the many plains near the coast, which are either similarly marked\r\nor are strewed with upraised marine remains, fully convince me that the\r\nmountains bounding these basin-plains were breached, their islet-like\r\nprojecting rocks worn, and the loose stratified detritus forming their\r\nnow level surfaces deposited, by the sea, as the land slowly emerged.\r\nIt is hardly possible to state too strongly the perfect resemblance in\r\noutline between these basin-like, long, and narrow plains of Chile\r\n(especially when in the early morning the mists hanging low represented\r\nwater), and the creeks and fiords now intersecting the southern and\r\nwestern shores of the continent. We can on this view of the sea, when\r\nthe land stood lower, having long and tranquilly occupied the spaces\r\nbetween the mountain-ranges, understand how the boundaries of the\r\nseparate basins were breached in more than one place; for we see that\r\nthis is the general character of the inland bays and channels of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego; we there, also, see in the sawing action of the tides, which\r\nflow with great force in the cross channels, a power sufficient to keep\r\nthe breaches open as the land emerged. We can further see that the\r\nwaves would naturally leave the smooth bottom of each great bay or\r\nchannel, as it became slowly converted into land, gently inclined to as\r\nmany points as there were mouths, through which the sea finally\r\nretreated, thus forming so many watersheds, without any marked ridges,\r\non a nearly level surface. The absence of marine remains in these high\r\ninland plains cannot be properly adduced as an objection to their\r\nmarine origin: for we may conclude, from shells not being found in the\r\ngreat shingle beds of Patagonia, though copiously strewed on their\r\nsurfaces, and from many other analogous facts, that such deposits are\r\neminently unfavourable for the embedment of such remains; and with\r\nrespect to shells not being found strewed on the surface of these\r\nbasin-like plains, it was shown in the last chapter that remains thus\r\nexposed in time decay and disappear.\r\n\r\nNo. 13\r\nSection of the plain at the eastern foot of the Chilian Cordillera.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the plain at the eastern foot of the Chilian\r\nCordillera.]\r\n\r\nI observed some appearances on the plains at the eastern and opposite\r\nfoot of the Cordillera which are worth notice, as showing that the sea\r\nthere long acted at nearly the same level as on the basin-plains of\r\nChile. The mountains on this eastern side are exceedingly abrupt; they\r\nrise out of a smooth, talus-like, very gentle, slope, from five to ten\r\nmiles in width (as represented in Figure 13), entirely composed of\r\nperfectly rounded pebbles, often white-washed with an aluminous\r\nsubstance like decomposed feldspar. This sloping plain or talus blends\r\ninto a perfectly flat space a few miles in width, composed\r\nof reddish impure clay, with small calcareous concretions as in the\r\nPampean deposit,—of fine white sand with small pebbles in layers,—and\r\nof the above-mentioned white aluminous earth, all interstratified\r\ntogether. This flat space runs as far as Mendoza, thirty miles\r\nnorthward, and stands probably at about the same height, namely, 2,700\r\nfeet (Pentland and Miers) above the sea. To the east it is bounded by\r\nan escarpment, eighty feet in height, running for many miles north and\r\nsouth, and composed of perfectly round pebbles, and loose,\r\nwhite-washed, or embedded in the aluminous earth: behind this\r\nescarpment there is a second and similar one of gravel. Northward of\r\nMendoza, these escarpments become broken and quite obliterated; and it\r\ndoes not appear that they ever enclosed a lake-like area: I conclude,\r\ntherefore, that they were formed by the sea, when it reached the foot\r\nof the Cordillera, like the similar escarpments occurring at so many\r\npoints on the coasts of Chile and Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe talus-like plain slopes up with a smooth surface into the great dry\r\nvalleys of the Cordillera. On each hand of the Portillo valley, the\r\nmountains are formed of red granite, mica-slate, and basalt, which all\r\nhave suffered a truly astonishing amount of denudation; the gravel in\r\nthe valley, as well as on the talus-like plain in front of it, is\r\ncomposed of these rocks; but at the mouth of the valley, in the middle\r\n(height probably about three thousand five hundred feet above the sea),\r\na few small isolated hillocks of several varieties of porphyry project,\r\nround which, on all sides, smooth and often white-washed pebbles of\r\nthese same porphyries, to the exclusion of all others, extend to a\r\ncircumscribed distance. Now, it is difficult to conceive any other\r\nagency, except the quiet and long-continued action of the sea on these\r\nhillocks, which could have rounded and whitewashed the fragments of\r\nporphyry, and caused them to radiate from such small and quite\r\ninsignificant centres, in the midst of that vast stream of stones which\r\nhas descended from the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\n_Sloping terraces of gravel in the valleys of the Cordillera._—All the\r\nmain valleys on both flanks of the Chilean Cordillera have formerly\r\nhad, or still have, their bottoms filled up to a considerable thickness\r\nby a mass of rudely stratified shingle. In Central Chile the greater\r\npart of this mass has been removed by the torrents; cliff-bounded\r\nfringes, more or less continuous, being left at corresponding heights\r\non both sides of the valleys. These fringes, or as they may be called\r\nterraces, have a smooth surface, and as the valleys rise, they gently\r\nrise with them: hence they are easily irrigated, and afford great\r\nfacilities for the construction of the roads. From their uniformity,\r\nthey give a remarkable character to the scenery of these grand, wild,\r\nbroken valleys. In width, the fringes vary much, sometimes being only\r\nbroad enough for the roads, and sometimes expanding into narrow plains.\r\nTheir surfaces, besides gently rising up the valley, are slightly\r\ninclined towards its centre in such a manner as to show that the whole\r\nbottom must once have been filled up with a smooth and slightly concave\r\nmass, as still are the dry unfurrowed valleys of Northern Chile. Where\r\ntwo valleys unite into one, these terraces are particularly well\r\nexhibited, as is represented in Figure 14. The thickness of the gravel\r\nforming these fringes, on a rude average, may be said to vary from\r\nthirty to sixty or eighty feet; but near the mouths of the valleys it\r\nwas in several places from two to three hundred feet. The amount of\r\nmatter removed by the torrents has been immense; yet in the lower parts\r\nof the valleys the terraces have seldom been entirely worn away on\r\neither side, nor has the solid underlying rock been reached: higher up\r\nthe valleys, the terraces have frequently been removed on one or the\r\nother side, and sometimes on both sides; but in this latter case they\r\nreappear after a short interval on the line, which they would have held\r\nhad they been unbroken. Where the solid rock has been reached, it has\r\nbeen cut into deep and narrow gorges. Still higher up the valleys, the\r\nterraces gradually become more and more broken, narrower, and less\r\nthick, until, at a height of from seven to nine thousand feet, they\r\nbecome lost, and blended with the piles of fallen detritus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground plan of a bifurcating valley in the Cordillera.]\r\n\r\nI carefully examined in many places the state of the gravel, and almost\r\neverywhere found the pebbles equally and perfectly rounded,\r\noccasionally with great blocks of rock, and generally distinctly\r\nstratified, often with parting seams of sand. The pebbles were\r\nsometimes coated with a white aluminous, and less frequently with a\r\ncalcareous, crust. At great heights up the valleys the pebbles become\r\nless rounded; and as the terraces become obliterated, the whole mass\r\npasses into the nature of ordinary detritus. I was repeatedly struck\r\nwith the great difference between this detritus high up the valleys,\r\nand the gravel of the terraces low down, namely, in the greater number\r\nof the quite angular fragments in the detritus,—in the unequal degree\r\nto which the other fragments have been rounded,—in the quantity of\r\nassociated earth,—in the absence of stratification,—and in the\r\nirregularity of the upper surfaces. This difference was likewise well\r\nshown at points low down the valleys, where precipitous ravines,\r\ncutting through mountains of highly coloured rock, have thrown down\r\nwide, fan-shaped accumulations of detritus on the terraces: in such\r\ncases, the line of separation between the detritus and the terrace\r\ncould be pointed out to within an inch or two; the detritus consisting\r\nentirely of angular and only partially rounded fragments of the\r\nadjoining coloured rocks; the stratified shingle (as I ascertained by\r\nclose inspection, especially in one case, in the valley of the River\r\nMendoza) containing only a small proportion of these fragments, and\r\nthose few well rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nI particularly attended to the appearance of the terraces where the\r\nvalleys made abrupt and considerable bends, but I could perceive no\r\ndifference in their structure: they followed the bends with their usual\r\nnearly equable inclination. I observed, also, in several valleys, that\r\nwherever large blocks of any rock became numerous, either on the\r\nsurface of the terrace or embedded in it, this rock soon appeared\r\nhigher up _in situ_: thus I have noticed blocks of porphyry, of\r\nandesitic syenite, of porphyry and of syenite, alternately becoming\r\nnumerous, and in each case succeeded by mountains thus constituted.\r\nThere is, however, one remarkable exception to this rule; for along the\r\nvalley of the Cachapual, M. Gay found numerous large blocks of white\r\ngranite, which does not occur in the neighbourhood. I observed these\r\nblocks, as well as others of andesitic syenite (not occurring here _in\r\nsitu_), near the baths of Cauquenes at a height of between two and\r\nthree hundred feet above the river, and therefore quite above the\r\nterrace or fringe which borders that river; some miles up the valleys\r\nthere were other blocks at about the same height. I also noticed, at a\r\nless height, just above the terrace, blocks of porphyries (apparently\r\nnot found in the immediately impending mountains), arranged in rude\r\nlines, as on a sea-beach. All these blocks were rounded, and though\r\nlarge, not gigantic, like the true erratic boulders of Patagonia and\r\nFuegia. M. Gay[5] states that the granite does not occur in situ within\r\na distance of twenty leagues; I suspect, for several reasons, that it\r\nwill ultimately be found at a much less distance, though certainly not\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood. The boulders found by MM. Meyen and Gay\r\non the upper plain of San Fernando (mentioned in a previous note)\r\nprobably belong to this same class of phenomena.\r\n\r\n [5] “Annales des Science Nat.” (I. séries, tome 28). M. Gay, as I was\r\n informed, penetrated the Cordillera by the great oblique valley of Los\r\n Cupressos, and not by the most direct line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fringes of stratified gravel occur along all the great valleys of\r\nthe Cordillera, as well as along their main branches; they are\r\nstrikingly developed in the valleys of the Maypu, Mendoza, Aconcagua,\r\nCachapual, and according to Meyen,[6] in the Tinguirica. XIn the\r\nvalleys, however, of Northern Chile, and in some on the eastern flank\r\nof the Cordillera, as in the Portillo Valley, where streams have never\r\nflowed, or are quite insignificant in volume, the presence of a mass of\r\nstratified gravel can be inferred only from the smooth slightly concave\r\nform of the bottom. One naturally seeks for some explanation of so\r\ngeneral and striking a phenomenon; that the matter forming the fringes\r\nalong the valleys, or still filling up their entire beds, has not\r\nfallen from the adjoining mountains like common detritus, is evident\r\nfrom the complete contrast in every respect between the gravel and the\r\npiles of detritus, whether seen high up the valleys on their sides, or\r\nlow down in front of the more precipitous ravines; that the matter has\r\nnot been deposited by debacles, even if we could believe in debacles\r\nhaving rushed down _every_ valley, and all their branches, eastward and\r\nwestward from the central pinnacles of the Cordillera, we must admit\r\nfrom the following\r\nreasons,—from the distinct stratification of the mass,—its smooth upper\r\nsurface,—the well-rounded and sometimes encrusted state of the pebbles,\r\nso different from the loose debris on the mountains,—and especially\r\nfrom the terraces preserving their uniform inclination round the most\r\nabrupt bends. To suppose that as the land now stands, the rivers\r\ndeposited the shingle along the course of every valley, and all their\r\nmain branches, appears to me preposterous, seeing that these same\r\nrivers not only are now removing and have removed much of this deposit,\r\nbut are everywhere tending to cut deep and narrow gorges in the hard\r\nunderlying rocks.\r\n\r\n [6] “Reise,” etc., Th. I, s. 302.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have stated that these fringes of gravel, the origin of which are\r\ninexplicable on the notion of debacles or of ordinary alluvial action,\r\nare directly continuous with the similarly-composed basin-like plains\r\nat the foot of the Cordillera, which, from the several reasons before\r\nassigned, I cannot doubt were modelled by the agency of the sea. Now if\r\nwe suppose that the sea formerly occupied the valleys of the Chilean\r\nCordillera, in precisely the same manner as it now does in the more\r\nsouthern parts of the continent, where deep winding creeks penetrate\r\ninto the very heart of, and in the case of Obstruction Sound quite\r\nthrough, this great range; and if we suppose that the mountains were\r\nupraised in the same slow manner as the eastern and western coasts have\r\nbeen upraised within the recent period, then the origin and formation\r\nof these sloping, terrace-like fringes of gravel can be simply\r\nexplained. For every part of the bottom of each valley will, on this\r\nview, have long stood at the head of a sea creek, into which the then\r\nexisting torrents will have delivered fragments of rocks, where, by the\r\naction of the tides, they will have been rolled, sometimes encrusted,\r\nrudely stratified, and the whole surface levelled by the blending\r\ntogether of the successive beach lines.[7] As the land rose, the\r\ntorrents in every valley will have tended to have removed the matter\r\nwhich just before had been arrested on, or near, the beach-lines; the\r\ntorrents, also, having continued to gain in force by the continued\r\nelevation increasing their total descent from their sources to the sea.\r\nThis slow rising of the Cordillera, which explains so well the\r\notherwise inexplicable origin and structure of the terraces, judging\r\nfrom all known analogies, will probably have been interrupted by many\r\nperiods of rest; but we ought not to expect to find any evidence of\r\nthese periods in the structure of the gravel-terraces: for, as the\r\nwaves at the heads of deep creeks have little erosive power, so the\r\nonly effect of the sea having long remained at the same level will be\r\nthat the upper parts of the creeks will have\r\nbecome filled up at such periods to the level of the water with gravel\r\nand sand; and that afterwards the rivers will have thrown down on the\r\nfilled-up parts a talus of similar matter, of which the inclination (as\r\nat the head of a partially filled-up lake) will have been determined by\r\nthe supply of detritus, and the force of the stream.[8] Hence, after\r\nthe final conversion of the creeks into valleys, almost the only\r\ndifference in the terraces at those points at which the sea stood long,\r\nwill be a somewhat more gentle inclination, with river-worn instead of\r\nsea-worn detritus on the surface.\r\n\r\n [7] Sloping terraces of precisely similar structure have been\r\n described by me (“Philosoph. Transactions,” 1839, p. 58) in the\r\n valleys of Lochaber in Scotland, where, at higher levels, the parallel\r\n roads of Glen Roy show the marks of the long and quiet residence of\r\n the sea. I have no doubt that these sloping terraces would have been\r\n present in the valleys of most of the European ranges, had not every\r\n trace of them, and all wrecks of sea-action, been swept away by the\r\n glaciers which have since occupied them. I have shown that this is the\r\n case with the mountains (_London and Edin. Phil. Journal,_ vol. xxi,\r\n p. 187) of North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] I have attempted to explain this process in a more detailed\r\n manner, in a letter to Mr. Maclaren, published in the _Edinburgh New\r\n Phil. Journal,_ vol. xxxv, p. 288.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know of only one difficulty on the foregoing view, namely, the\r\nfar-transported blocks of rock high on the sides of the valley of the\r\nCachapual: I will not attempt any explanation of this phenomenon, but I\r\nmay state my belief that a mountain-ridge near the Baths of Cauquenes\r\nhas been upraised long subsequently to all the other ranges in the\r\nneighbourhood, and that when this was effected the whole face of the\r\ncountry must have been greatly altered. In the course of ages,\r\nmoreover, in this and other valleys, events may have occurred like, but\r\neven on a grander scale than, that described by Molina,[9] when a slip\r\nduring the earthquake of 1762 banked up for ten days the great River\r\nLontue, which then bursting its barrier “inundated the whole country,”\r\nand doubtless transported many great fragments of rock. Finally,\r\nnotwithstanding\r\nthis one case of difficulty, I cannot entertain any doubt, that these\r\nterrace-like fringes, which are continuously united with the\r\nbasin-shaped plains at the foot of the Cordillera, have been formed by\r\nthe arrestment of river-borne detritus at successive levels, in the\r\nsame manner as we see now taking place at the heads of all those many,\r\ndeep, winding fiords intersecting the southern coasts. To my mind, this\r\nhas been one of the most important conclusions to which my observations\r\non the geology of South America have led me; for we thus learn that one\r\nof the grandest and most symmetrical mountain-chains in the world, with\r\nits several parallel lines,[10] has been together uplifted in mass\r\nbetween seven and nine thousand feet, in the same gradual manner as\r\nhave the eastern and western coasts within the recent period.\r\n\r\n [9] “Compendio de la Hist.,” etc., tome i, p. 30. M. Brongniart, in\r\n his report on M. Gay’s labours (“Annales des Sciences” 1833),\r\n considers that the boulders in the Cachapual belong to the same class\r\n with the erratic boulders of Europe. As the blocks which I saw are not\r\n gigantic, and especially as they are not angular, and as they have not\r\n been transported fairly across low spaces or wide valleys, I am\r\n unwilling to class them with those which, both in the northern and\r\n southern hemisphere (“Geolog. Transac.,” vol. vi, p. 415), have been\r\n transported by ice. It is to be hoped that when M. Gay’s\r\n long-continued and admirable labours in Chile are published, more\r\n light will be thrown on this subject. However, the boulders may have\r\n been primarily transported; the final position of those of porphyry,\r\n which have been described as arranged at the foot of the mountain in\r\n rude lines, I cannot doubt, has been due to the action of waves on a\r\n beach. The valley of the Cachapual, in the part where the boulders\r\n occur, bursts through the high ridge of Cauquenes, which runs parallel\r\n to, but at some distance from, the Cordillera. This ridge has been\r\n subjected to excessive violence; trachytic lava has burst from it, and\r\n hot springs yet flow at its base. Seeing the enormous amount of\r\n denudation of solid rock in the upper and much broader parts of this\r\n valley where it enters the Cordillera, and seeing to what extent the\r\n ridge of Cauquenes now protects the great range, I could not help\r\n believing (as alluded to in the text) that this ridge with its\r\n trachytic eruptions had been thrown up at a much later period than the\r\n Cordillera. If this has been the case, the boulders, after having been\r\n transported to a low level by the torrents (which exhibit in every\r\n valley proofs of their power of moving great fragments), may have been\r\n raised up to their present height, with the land on which they rested.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] I do not wish to affirm that all the lines have been uplifted\r\n quite equally; slight differences in the elevation would leave no\r\n perceptible effect on the terraces. It may, however, be inferred,\r\n perhaps with one exception, that since the period when the sea\r\n occupied these valleys, the several ranges have not been dislocated by\r\n _great_ and _abrupt_ faults or upheavals; for if such had occurred,\r\n the terraces of gravel at these points would not have been continuous.\r\n The one exception is at the lower end of a plain in the Valle del Yeso\r\n (a branch of the Maypu), where, at a great height, the terraces and\r\n valley appear to have been broken through by a line of upheaval, of\r\n which the evidence is plain in the adjoining mountains; this\r\n dislocation, perhaps, occurred _after the elevation_ of this part of\r\n the valley above the level of the sea. The valley here is almost\r\n blocked up by a pile about one thousand feet in thickness, formed, as\r\n far as I could judge, from three sides, entirely, or at least in chief\r\n part, of gravel and detritus. On the south side, the river has cut\r\n quite through this mass; on the northern side, and on the very summit,\r\n deep ravines, parallel to the line of the valley, are worn, as if the\r\n drainage from the valley above had passed by these two lines before\r\n following its present course.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Valleys._\r\n\r\nThe bulk of solid rock which has been removed in the lower parts of the\r\nvalleys of the Cordillera has been enormous. It is only by reflecting\r\non such cases as that of the gravel beds of Patagonia, covering so many\r\nthousand square leagues of surface, and which, if heaped into a ridge,\r\nwould form a mountain-range almost equal to the Cordillera, that the\r\namount of denudation becomes credible. The valleys within this range\r\noften follow anticlinal but rarely synclinal lines; that is, the strata\r\non the two sides more often dip from the line of valley than towards\r\nit. On the flanks of the range, the valleys most frequently run neither\r\nalong anticlinal nor synclinal axes, but along lines of flexure or\r\nfaults: that is, the strata on both sides dip in the same direction,\r\nbut with different, though often only slightly different, inclinations.\r\nAs most of the nearly parallel ridges which together form the\r\nCordillera run approximately north and south, the east and west valleys\r\ncross them in zig-zag lines, bursting through the points where the\r\nstrata have been\r\nleast inclined. No doubt the greater part of the denudation was\r\naffected at the periods when tidal-creeks occupied the valleys, and\r\nwhen the outer flanks of the mountains were exposed to the full force\r\nof an open ocean. I have already alluded to the power of the tidal\r\naction in the channels connecting great bays; and I may here mention\r\nthat one of the surveying vessels in a channel of this kind, though\r\nunder sail, was whirled round and round by the force of the current. We\r\nshall hereafter see, that of the two main ridges forming the Chilean\r\nCordillera, the eastern and loftiest one owes the greater part of its\r\n_angular_ upheaval to a period subsequent to the elevation of the\r\nwestern ridge; and it is likewise probable that many of the other\r\nparallel ridges have been angularly upheaved at different periods;\r\nconsequently many parts of the surfaces of these mountains must\r\nformerly have been exposed to the full force of the waves, which, if\r\nthe Cordillera were now sunk into the sea, would be protected by\r\nparallel chains of islands. The torrents in the valleys certainly have\r\ngreat power in wearing the rocks; as could be told by the dull rattling\r\nsound of the many fragments night and day hurrying downwards; and as\r\nwas attested by the vast size of certain fragments, which I was assured\r\nhad been carried onwards during floods; yet we have seen in the lower\r\nparts of the valleys, that the torrents have seldom removed all the\r\nsea-checked shingle forming the terraces, and have had time since the\r\nlast elevation in mass only to cut in the underlying rocks, gorges,\r\ndeep and narrow, but quite insignificant in dimensions compared with\r\nthe entire width and depth of the valleys.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of the Pacific, I never ceased during my many and long\r\nexcursions to feel astonished at seeing every valley, ravine, and even\r\nlittle inequality of surface, both in the hard granitic and soft\r\ntertiary districts, retaining the exact outline, which they had when\r\nthe sea left their surfaces coated with organic remains. When these\r\nremains shall have decayed, there will be scarcely any difference in\r\nappearance between this line of coast-land and most other countries,\r\nwhich we are accustomed to believe have assumed their present features\r\nchiefly through the agency of the weather and fresh-water streams. In\r\nthe old granitic districts, no doubt it would be rash to attribute all\r\nthe modifications of outline exclusively to the sea-action; for who can\r\nsay how often this lately submerged coast may not previously have\r\nexisted as land, worn by running streams and washed by rain? This\r\nsource of doubt, however, does not apply to the districts superficially\r\nformed of the modern tertiary deposits. The valleys worn by the sea,\r\nthrough the softer formations, both on the Atlantic and Pacific sides\r\nof the continent, are generally broad, winding, and flat-bottomed: the\r\nonly district of this nature now penetrated by arms of the sea, is the\r\nisland of Chiloe.\r\n\r\nFinally, the conclusion at which I have arrived, with respect to the\r\nrelative powers of rain and sea water on the land, is, that the latter\r\nis far the most efficient agent, and that its chief tendency is to\r\nwiden the valleys; whilst torrents and rivers tend to deepen them, and\r\nto remove the wreck of the sea’s destroying action. As the waves have\r\nmore\r\npower, the more open and exposed the space may be, so will they always\r\ntend to widen more and more the mouths of valleys compared with their\r\nupper parts: hence, doubtless, it is, that most valleys expand at their\r\nmouths,—that part, at which the rivers flowing in them, generally have\r\nthe least wearing power.\r\n\r\nWhen reflecting on the action of the sea on the land at former levels,\r\nthe effect of the great waves, which generally accompany earthquakes,\r\nmust not be overlooked: few years pass without a severe earthquake\r\noccurring on some part of the west coast of South America; and the\r\nwaves thus caused have great power. At Concepcion, after the shock of\r\n1835, I saw large slabs of sandstone, one of which was six feet long,\r\nthree in breadth, and two in thickness, thrown high up on the beach;\r\nand from the nature of the marine animals still adhering to it, it must\r\nhave been torn up from a considerable depth. On the other hand, at\r\nCallao, the recoil-wave of the earthquake of 1746 carried great masses\r\nof brickwork, between three and four feet square, some way out seaward.\r\nDuring the course of ages, the effect thus produced at each successive\r\nlevel, cannot have been small; and in some of the tertiary deposits on\r\nthis line of coast, I observed great boulders of granite and other\r\nneighbouring rocks, embedded in fine sedimentary layers, the\r\ntransportal of which, except by the means of earthquake-waves, always\r\nappeared to me inexplicable.\r\n\r\n_Superficial Saline Deposits._\r\n\r\nThis subject may be here conveniently treated of: I will begin with the\r\nmost interesting case, namely, the superficial saline beds near Iquique\r\nin Peru. The porphyritic mountains on the coast rise abruptly to a\r\nheight of between one thousand nine hundred and three thousand feet:\r\nbetween their summits and an inland plain, on which the celebrated\r\ndeposit of nitrate of soda lies, there is a high undulatory district,\r\ncovered by a remarkable superficial saliferous crust, chiefly composed\r\nof common salt, either in white, hard, opaque nodules, or mingled with\r\nsand, in this latter case forming a compact sandstone. This saliferous\r\nsuperficial crust extends from the edge of the coast-escarpment, over\r\nthe whole face of the country; but never attains, as I am assured by\r\nMr. Bollaert (long resident here) any great thickness. Although a very\r\nslight shower falls only at intervals of many years, yet small\r\nfunnel-shaped cavities show that the salt has been in some parts\r\ndissolved.[11] In several places I saw large patches of sand, quite\r\nmoist, owing to the quantity of muriate of lime (as ascertained by Mr.\r\nT. Reeks) contained in them. From the compact salt-cemented sand being\r\neither red, purplish, or yellow, according to the colour of the rocky\r\nstrata on which\r\nit rested, I imagined that this[12] substance had probably been derived\r\nthrough common alluvial action from the layers of salt which occur\r\ninterstratified in the surrounding mountains: but from the interesting\r\ndetails given by M. d’Orbigny, and from finding on a fresh examination\r\nof this agglomerated sand, that it is not irregularly cemented, but\r\nconsists of thin layers of sand of different tints of colour,\r\nalternating with excessively fine parallel layers of salt, I conclude\r\nthat it is not of alluvial origin. M. d’Orbigny[13] observed analogous\r\nsaline beds extending from Cobija for five degrees of latitude\r\nnorthward, and at heights varying from six hundred to nine hundred\r\nfeet: from finding recent sea-shells strewed on these saliferous beds,\r\nand under them, great well-rounded blocks, exactly like those on the\r\nexisting beach, he believes that the salt, which is invariably\r\nsuperficial, has been left by the evaporation of the sea-water. This\r\nsame conclusion must, I now believe, be extended to the superficial\r\nsaliferous beds of Iquique, though they stand about three thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n [11] It is singular how slowly, according to the observations of M.\r\n Cordier on the salt-mountain of Cardona in Spain (“Ann. des Mines,\r\n Transl. of Geolog. Mem.” by De la Beche, p. 60), salt is dissolved,\r\n where the amount of rain is supposed to be as much as 31·4 of an inch\r\n in the year. It is calculated that only five feet in thickness is\r\n dissolved in the course of a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] “Journal of Researches,” p. 444, first edit.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] “Voyage,” etc., p. 102. M. d’Orbigny found this deposit\r\n intersected, in many places, by deep ravines, in which there was no\r\n salt. Streams must once, though historically unknown, have flowed in\r\n them; and M. d’Orbigny argues from the presence of undissolved salt\r\n over the whole surrounding country, that the streams must have arisen\r\n from rain or snow having fallen, not in the adjoining country, but on\r\n the now arid Cordillera. I may remark, that from having observed ruins\r\n of Indian buildings in absolutely sterile parts of the Chilian\r\n Cordillera (“Journal,” 2nd edit., p. 357), I am led to believe that\r\n the climate, at a time when Indian man inhabited this part of the\r\n continent, was in some slight degree more humid than it is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated with the salt in the superficial beds, there are numerous,\r\nthin, horizontal layers of impure, dirty-white, friable, gypseous and\r\ncalcareous tuffs. The gypseous beds are very remarkable, from abounding\r\nwith, so as sometimes to be almost composed of, irregular concretions,\r\nfrom the size of an egg to that of a man’s head, of very hard, compact,\r\nheavy gypsum, in the form of anhydrite. This gypsum contains some\r\nforeign particles of stone; it is stained, judging from its action with\r\nborax, with iron, and it exhales a strong aluminous odour. The surfaces\r\nof the concretions are marked by sharp, radiating, or bifurcating\r\nridges, as if they had been (but not really) corroded: internally they\r\nare penetrated by branching veins (like those of calcareous spar in the\r\nseptaria of the London clay) of pure white anhydrite. These veins might\r\nnaturally have been thought to have been formed by subsequent\r\ninfiltration, had not each little embedded fragment of rock been\r\nlikewise edged in a very remarkable manner by a narrow border of the\r\nsame white anhydrite: this shows that the veins must have been formed\r\nby a process of segregation, and not of infiltration. Some of the\r\nlittle included and _cracked_ fragments of foreign rock are penetrated\r\nby the anhydrite, and portions have evidently been thus mechanically\r\ndisplaced: at St. Helena, I observed that calcareous matter, deposited\r\nby rain water, also had the power to\r\nseparate small fragments of rock from the larger masses.[14] I believe\r\nthe superficial gypseous deposit is widely extended: I received\r\nspecimens of it from Pisagua, forty miles north of Iquique, and\r\nlikewise from Arica, where it coats a layer of pure salt. M.\r\nd’Orbigny[15] found at Cobija a bed of clay, lying above a mass of\r\nupraised recent shells, which was saturated with sulphate of soda, and\r\nincluded thin layers of fibrous gypsum. These widely extended,\r\nsuperficial, beds of salt and gypsum, appear to me an interesting\r\ngeological phenomenon, which could be presented only under a very dry\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n [14] “Volcanic Islands,” etc., p. 87.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] “Voyage Géolog.,” etc., p. 95.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plain or basin, on the borders of which the famous bed of nitrate\r\nof soda lies, is situated at the distance of about thirty miles from\r\nthe sea, being separated from it by the saliferous district just\r\ndescribed. It stands at a height of 3,300 feet; its surface is level,\r\nand some leagues in width; it extends forty miles northward, and has a\r\ntotal length (as I was informed by Mr. Belford Wilson, the\r\nConsul-General at Lima) of 420 miles. In a well near the works,\r\nthirty-six yards in depth, sand, earth, and a little gravel were found:\r\nin another well, near Almonte, fifty yards deep, the whole consisted,\r\naccording to Mr. Blake,[16] of clay, including a layer of sand two feet\r\nthick, which rested on fine gravel, and this on coarse gravel, with\r\nlarge rounded fragments of rock. In many parts of this now utterly\r\ndesert plain, rushes and large prostrate trees in a hardened state,\r\napparently Mimosas, are found buried, at a depth from three to six\r\nfeet; according to Mr. Blake, they have all fallen to the south-west.\r\nThe bed of nitrate of soda is said to extend for forty to fifty leagues\r\nalong the western margin of the plain, but is not found in its central\r\nparts: it is from two to three feet in thickness, and is so hard that\r\nit is generally blasted with gunpowder; it slopes gently upwards from\r\nthe edge of the plain to between ten and thirty feet above its level.\r\nIt rests on sand in which, it is said, vegetable remains and broken\r\nshells have been found; shells have also been found, according to Mr.\r\nBlake, both on and in the nitrate of soda. It is covered by a\r\nsuperficial mass of sand, containing nodules of common salt, and, as I\r\nwas assured by a miner, much soft gypseous matter, precisely like that\r\nin the superficial crust already described: certainly this crust, with\r\nits characteristic concretions of anhydrite, comes close down to the\r\nedge of the plain.\r\n\r\n [16] See an admirable paper “Geolog. and Miscell. Notices of\r\n Tarapaca,” in _Silliman’s American Journal_, vol. xliv, p. 1.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate of soda varies in purity in different parts, and often\r\ncontains nodules of common salt. According to Mr. Blake, the proportion\r\nof nitrate of soda varies from 20 to 75 per cent. An analysis by Mr. A.\r\nHayes, of an average specimen, gave:—\r\n\r\nNitrate of Soda\t\t64·98 Sulphate of Soda\t\t3·00 Chloride of\r\nSoda\t\t28·69 Iodic Salts\t\t0·63 Shells and Marl\t\t2·60\r\n———\r\n99.90\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “mother-water” at some of the refineries is very rich in iodic\r\nsalts, and is supposed[17] to contain much muriate of lime. In an\r\nunrefined specimen brought home by myself, Mr. T. Reeks has ascertained\r\nthat the muriate of lime is very abundant. With respect to the origin\r\nof this saline mass, from the manner in which the gently inclined,\r\ncompact bed follows for so many miles the sinuous margin of the plain,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it was deposited from a sheet of water: from\r\nthe fragments of embedded shells, from the abundant iodic salts, from\r\nthe superficial saliferous crust occurring at a higher level and being\r\nprobably of marine origin, and from the plain resembling in form those\r\nof Chile and that of Uspallata, there can be little doubt that this\r\nsheet of water was, at least originally, connected with the sea.[18]\r\n\r\n [17] _Literary Gazette_, 1841, p. 475.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] (From an official document, shown me by Mr. Belford Wilson, it\r\n appears that the first export of nitrate of soda to Europe was in July\r\n 1830, on French account, in a British ship:—\r\n\r\nEntire export in\t\tQuintals 1830\t\t17,300 1831\t\t40,885\r\n1832\t\t51,400 1833\t\t91,335 1834\t\t149,538\r\n\r\nThe Spanish quintal nearly equals 100 English pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thin, superficial, saline incrustations._—These saline incrustations\r\nare common in many parts of America: Humboldt met with them on the\r\ntableland of Mexico, and the Jesuit Falkner and other authors[19] state\r\nthat they occur at intervals over the vast plains extending from the\r\nmouth of the Plata to Rioja and Catamarca. Hence it is that during\r\ndroughts, most of the streams in the Pampas are saline. I nowhere met\r\nwith these incrustations so abundantly as near Bahia Blanca: square\r\nmiles of the mud-flats, which near that place are raised only a few\r\nfeet above the sea, just enough to protect them from being overflowed,\r\nappear, after dry weather, whiter than the ground after the thickest\r\nhoar-frost. After rain the salts disappear, and every puddle of water\r\nbecomes highly saline; as the surface dries, the capillary action draws\r\nthe moisture up pieces of broken earth, dead sticks, and tufts of\r\ngrass, where the salt effloresces. The incrustation, where thickest,\r\ndoes not exceed a quarter of an inch. M. Parchappe[20] has analysed it;\r\nand finds that the specimens collected at the extreme head of the low\r\nplain, near the River Manuello, consist of 93 per cent of sulphate of\r\nsoda, and 7 of common salt; whilst the specimens taken close to the\r\ncoast contain only 63 per cent of the sulphate, and 37 of the muriate\r\nof soda. This remarkable fact, together with our knowledge that the\r\nwhole of this low muddy plain has been covered by the sea within the\r\nrecent period, must lead to the suspicion that\r\nthe common salt, by some unknown process, becomes in time changed into\r\nthe sulphate. Friable, calcareous matter is here abundant, and the case\r\nof the apparent double decomposition of the shells and salt on San\r\nLorenzo, should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n [19] Azara (“Travels,” vol. i, p. 55) considers that the Parana is the\r\n eastern boundary of the saliferous region; but I heard of “salitrales”\r\n in the Province of Entre Rios.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] M. d’Orbigny’s “Voyage,” etc., Part. Hist., tome i, p. 664.\r\n\r\nThe saline incrustations, near Bahia Blanca, are not confined to,\r\nthough most abundant on, the low muddy flats; for I noticed some on a\r\ncalcareous plain between thirty and forty feet above the sea, and even\r\na little occurs in still higher valleys. Low alluvial tracts in the\r\nvalleys of the Rivers Negro and Colorado are also encrusted, and in the\r\nlatter valley such spaces appeared to be occasionally overflowed by the\r\nriver. I observed saline incrustations in some of the valleys of\r\nSouthern Patagonia. At Port Desire a low, flat, muddy valley was\r\nthickly incrusted by salts, which on analysis by Mr. T. Reeks, are\r\nfound to consist of a mixture of sulphate and muriate of soda, with\r\ncarbonate of lime and earthy matter. On the western side of the\r\ncontinent, the southern coasts are much too humid for this phenomenon;\r\nbut in Northern Chile I again met with similar incrustations. On the\r\nhardened mud, in parts of the broad, flat-bottomed valley of Copiapo,\r\nthe saline matter encrusts the ground to the thickness of some inches:\r\nspecimens, sent by Mr. Bingley to Apothecaries’ Hall for analysis, were\r\nsaid to consist of carbonate and sulphate of soda. Much sulphate of\r\nsoda is found in the desert of Atacama. In all parts of South America,\r\nthe saline incrustations occur most frequently on low damp surfaces of\r\nmud, where the climate is rather dry; and these low surfaces have, in\r\nalmost every case, been upraised above the level of the sea, within the\r\nrecent period.\r\n\r\n_Salt-lakes of Patagonia and La Plata._—Salinas, or natural salt-lakes,\r\noccur in various formations on the eastern side of the continent,—in\r\nthe argillaceo-calcareous deposit of the Pampas, in the sandstone of\r\nthe Rio Negro, where they are very numerous, in the pumiceous and other\r\nbeds of the Patagonian tertiary formation, and in small primary\r\ndistricts in the midst of this latter formation. Port S. Julian is the\r\nmost southerly point (lat. 49° to 50°) at which salinas are known to\r\noccur.[21] The depressions, in which these salt-lakes lie, are from a\r\nfew feet to sixty metres, as asserted by M. d’Orbigny,[22] below the\r\nsurface of the surrounding plains; and, according to this same author,\r\nnear the Rio Negro they all trend, either in the N.E. and S.W. or in E.\r\nand W. lines, coincident with the general slope of the plain. These\r\ndepressions in the plain generally have one side lower than the others,\r\nbut there are no outlets for drainage. Under a less dry climate, an\r\noutlet would soon have been formed, and the salt washed away. The\r\nsalinas occur at different elevations above the sea; they are often\r\nseveral leagues in diameter; they are generally very shallow, but there\r\nis a deep one in a quartz-rock formation near C. Blanco. In the wet\r\nseason, the whole, or\r\na part, of the salt is dissolved, being redeposited during the\r\nsucceeding dry season. At this period the appearance of the snow-white\r\nexpanse of salt crystallised in great cubes, is very striking. In a\r\nlarge salina, northward of the Rio Negro, the salt at the bottom,\r\nduring the whole year, is between two and three feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n [21] According to Azara (“Travels,” vol. i, p. 56) there are\r\n salt-lakes as far north as Chaco (lat. 25°), on the banks of the\r\n Vermejo. The salt-lakes of Siberia appear (Pallas’s “Travels,” English\r\n Trans., vol. i, p. 284) to occur in very similar depressions to those\r\n of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] “Voyage Géolog.,” p. 63.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe salt rests almost always on a thick bed of black muddy sand, which\r\nis fetid, probably from the decay of the burrowing worms inhabiting\r\nit.[23] In a salina, situated about fifteen miles above the town of El\r\nCarmen on the Rio Negro, and three or four miles from the banks of that\r\nriver, I observed that this black mud rested on gravel with a\r\ncalcareous matrix, similar to that spread over the whole surrounding\r\nplains: at Port S. Julian the mud, also, rested on the gravel: hence\r\nthe depressions must have been formed anteriorly to, or\r\ncontemporaneously with, the spreading out of the gravel. I was informed\r\nthat one small salina occurs in an alluvial plain within the valley of\r\nthe Rio Negro, and therefore its origin must be subsequent to the\r\nexcavation of that valley. When I visited the salina, fifteen miles\r\nabove the town, the salt was beginning to crystallise, and on the muddy\r\nbottom there were lying many crystals, generally placed crossways of\r\nsulphate of soda (as ascertained by Mr. Reeks), and embedded in the\r\nmud, numerous crystals of sulphate of lime, from one to three inches in\r\nlength: M. d’Orbigny[24] states that some of these crystals are\r\nacicular and more than even nine inches in length; others are macled\r\nand of great purity: those I found all contained some sand in their\r\ncentres. As the black and fetid sand overlies the gravel, and that\r\noverlies the regular tertiary strata, I think there can be no doubt\r\nthat these remarkable crystals of sulphate of lime have been deposited\r\nfrom the waters of the lake. The inhabitants call the crystals of\r\nselenite, the _padre del sal_, and those of the sulphate of soda, the\r\n_madre del sal_; they assured me that both are found under the same\r\ncircumstances in several of the neighbouring salinas; and that the\r\nsulphate of soda is annually dissolved, and is always crystallised\r\nbefore the common salt on the muddy bottom.[25] The association of\r\ngypsum and salt in this case, as well as in the superficial deposits of\r\nIquique, appears to me interesting, considering how generally these\r\nsubstances are associated in the older stratified formations.\r\n\r\n [23] Professor Ehrenberg examined some of this muddy sand, but was\r\n unable to find in it any infusoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] “Voyage Géolog.,” p. 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] This is what might have been expected; for M. Ballard asserts\r\n (_Acad. des Sciences_, Oct. 7, 1844, that sulphate of soda is\r\n precipitated from solution more readily from water containing muriate\r\n of soda in excess, than from pure water.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Reeks has analysed for me some of the salt from the salina near the\r\nRio Negro; he finds it composed entirely of chloride of sodium, with\r\nthe exception of 0·26 of sulphate of lime and of 0·22 of earthy matter:\r\nthere are no traces of iodic salts. Some salt from the salina\r\nChiquitos, in the Pampean formation, is equally pure. It is a singular\r\nfact, that the salt from these salinas does not serve so well for\r\npreserving meat,  as sea-salt from the Cape de Verde Islands; and a\r\nmerchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as 50 per cent\r\nless valuable. The purity of the Patagonian salt, or absence from it of\r\nthose other saline bodies found in all sea-water, is the only\r\nassignable cause for this inferiority; a conclusion which is supported\r\nby the fact lately ascertained,[26] that those salts answer best for\r\npreserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent chlorides.[27]\r\n\r\n [26] _Hort. and Agricult. Gazette_, 1845, p. 93.\r\n\r\n\r\n [27] It would probably well answer for the merchants of Buenos Ayres\r\n (considering the great consumption there of salt for preserving meat)\r\n to import the deliquescent chlorides to mix with the salt from the\r\n salinas: I may call attention to the fact, that at Iquique, a large\r\n quantity of muriate of lime, left in the _ mother-water_ during the\r\n refinement of the nitrate of soda, is annually thrown away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the salt in the salinas, the foregoing\r\nanalysis seems opposed to the view entertained by M. d’Orbigny and\r\nothers, and which seems so probable considering the recent elevation of\r\nthis line of coast, namely, that it is due to the evaporation of\r\nsea-water and to the drainage from the surrounding strata impregnated\r\nwith sea-salt. I was informed (I know not whether accurately) that on\r\nthe northern side of the salina on the Rio Negro, there is a small\r\nbrine spring which flows at all times of the year: if this be so, the\r\nsalt in this case at least, probably is of subterranean origin. It at\r\nfirst appears very singular that fresh water can often be procured in\r\nwells,[28] and is sometimes found in small lakes, quite close to these\r\nsalinas. I am not aware that this fact bears particularly on the origin\r\nof the salt; but perhaps it is rather opposed to the view of the salt\r\nhaving been washed out of the surrounding superficial strata, but not\r\nto its having been the residue of sea-water, left in depressions as the\r\nland was slowly elevated.\r\n\r\n [28] Sir W. Parish states (“Buenos Ayres,” etc., pp. 122 and 170) that\r\n this is the case near the great salinas westward of the S. Ventana. I\r\n have seen similar statements in an ancient MS. Journal lately\r\n published by S. Angelis. At Iquique, where the surface is so thickly\r\n encrusted with saline matter, I tasted water only slightly brackish,\r\n procured in a well thirty-six yards deep; but here one feels less\r\n surprise at its presence, as pure water might percolate under ground\r\n from the not very distant Cordillera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV ON THE FORMATIONS OF THE PAMPAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineralogical constitution.—Microscopical structure.—Buenos Ayres,\r\nshells embedded in tosca-rock.—Buenos Ayres to the Colorado.—San\r\nVentana.—Bahia Blanca; M.

It has upon the whole a very uniform character:\r\nconsisting of a more or less dull reddish, slightly indurated,\r\nargillaceous earth or mud, often, but not always, including in\r\nhorizontal lines concretions of marl, and frequently passing into a\r\ncompact marly rock. The mud, wherever I examined it, even close to the\r\nconcretions, did not contain any carbonate of lime. The concretions are\r\ngenerally nodular, sometimes rough externally, sometimes\r\nstalactiformed; they are of a compact structure, but often penetrated\r\n(as well as the mud) by hair-like serpentine cavities, and occasionally\r\nwith irregular fissures in their centres, lined with minute crystals of\r\ncarbonate of lime; they are of white, brown, or pale pinkish tints,\r\noften marked by black dendritic manganese or iron; they are either\r\ndarker or lighter tinted than the surrounding mass; they contain much\r\ncarbonate of lime, but exhale a strong aluminous odour, and leave, when\r\ndissolved in acids, a large but varying residue, of which the greater\r\npart consists of sand. These concretions often unite into irregular\r\nstrata; and over very large tracts of country, the entire mass consists\r\nof a hard, but generally cavernous marly rock: some of the varieties\r\nmight be called calcareous tuffs.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter has kindly examined under the microscope, sliced and\r\npolished specimens of these concretions, and of the solid marl-rock,\r\ncollected in various places between the Colorado and Santa Fe Bajada.\r\nIn the greater number, Dr. Carpenter finds that the whole substance\r\npresents a tolerably uniform amorphous character, but with traces of\r\nincipient crystalline metamorphosis; in other specimens he finds\r\nmicroscopically minute rounded concretions of an amorphous substance\r\n(resembling in size those in oolitic rocks, but not having a concentric\r\nstructure), united by a cement which is often crystalline. In some, Dr.\r\nCarpenter can perceive distinct traces of shells, corals, Polythalamia,\r\nand rarely of spongoid bodies. For the sake of comparison, I sent Dr.\r\nCarpenter specimens of the calcareous rock, formed chiefly of fragments\r\nof recent shells, from Coquimbo in Chile: in one of these specimens,\r\nDr. Carpenter finds, besides the larger fragments, microscopical\r\nparticles of shells, and a varying quantity of opaque amorphous matter;\r\nin another specimen from the same bed, he finds the whole composed of\r\nthe amorphous matter, with layers showing indications of\r\nan incipient crystalline metamorphosis: hence these latter specimens,\r\nboth in external appearance and in microscopical structure, closely\r\nresemble those of the Pampas. Dr. Carpenter informs me that it is well\r\nknown that chemical precipitation throws down carbonate of lime in the\r\nopaque amorphous state; and he is inclined to believe that the\r\nlong-continued attrition of a calcareous body in a state of crystalline\r\nor semi-crystalline aggregation (as, for instance, in the ordinary\r\nshells of Mollusca, which, when sliced, are transparent) may yield the\r\nsame result. From the intimate relations between all the Coquimbo\r\nspecimens, I can hardly doubt that the amorphous carbonate of lime in\r\nthem has resulted from the attrition and decay of the larger fragments\r\nof shell: whether the amorphous matter in the marly rocks of the Pampas\r\nhas likewise thus originated, it would be hazardous to conjecture.\r\n\r\nFor convenience’ sake, I will call the marly rock by the name given to\r\nit by the inhabitants, namely, Tosca-rock; and the reddish argillaceous\r\nearth, Pampean mud. This latter substance, I may mention, has been\r\nexamined for me by Professor Ehrenberg, and the result of his\r\nexamination will be given under the proper localities.\r\n\r\nI will commence my descriptions at a central spot, namely, at Buenos\r\nAyres, and thence proceed first southward to the extreme limit of the\r\ndeposit, and afterwards northward. The plain on which Buenos Ayres\r\nstands is from thirty to forty feet in height. The Pampean mud is here\r\nof a rather pale colour, and includes small nearly white nodules, and\r\nother irregular strata of an unusually arenaceous variety of\r\ntosca-rock. In a well at the depth of seventy feet, according to\r\nIgnatio Nunez, much tosca-rock was met with, and at several points, at\r\none hundred feet deep, beds of sand have been found. I have already\r\ngiven a list of the recent marine and estuary shells found in many\r\nparts on the surface near Buenos Ayres, as far as three or four leagues\r\nfrom the Plata. Specimens from near Ensenada, given me by Sir W.\r\nParish, where the rock is quarried just beneath the surface of the\r\nplain, consist of broken bivalves, cemented by and converted into white\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime. I have already alluded, in the first\r\nchapter, to a specimen (also given me by Sir W. Parish) from the A. del\r\nTristan, in which shells, resembling in every respect the _Azara\r\nlabiata_, d’Orbigny, as far as their worn condition permits of\r\ncomparison, are embedded in a reddish, softish, somewhat arenaceous\r\nmarly rock: after careful comparison, with the aid of a microscope and\r\nacids, I can perceive no difference between the basis of this rock and\r\nthe specimens collected by me in many parts of the Pampas. I have also\r\nstated, on the authority of Sir W. Parish, that northward of Buenos\r\nAyres, on the highest parts of the plain, about forty feet above the\r\nPlata, and two or three miles from it, numerous shells of the _Azara\r\nlabiata_ (and I believe of _Venus sinuosa_) occur embedded in a\r\nstratified earthy mass, including small marly concretions, and said to\r\nbe precisely like the great Pampean deposit. Hence we may conclude that\r\nthe mud of the Pampas continued to be deposited to within the period of\r\nthis existing estuary shell. Although this formation is of such immense\r\nextent, I know of no other instance of the presence of shells in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buenos Ayres to the Rio Colorado._—With the exception of a few\r\nmetamorphic ridges, the country between these two points, a distance of\r\n400 geographical miles, belongs to the Pampean formation, and in the\r\nsouthern part is generally formed of the harder and more calcareous\r\nvarieties. I will briefly describe my route: about twenty-five miles\r\nS.S.W. of the capital, in a well forty yards in depth, the upper part,\r\nand, as I was assured, the entire thickness, was formed of dark red\r\nPampean mud without concretions. North of the River Salado, there are\r\nmany lakes; and on the banks of one (near the Guardia) there was a\r\nlittle cliff similarly composed, but including many nodular and\r\nstalactiform concretions: I found here a large piece of tessellated\r\narmour, like that of the Glyptodon, and many fragments of bones. The\r\ncliffs on the Salado consist of pale-coloured Pampean mud, including\r\nand passing into great masses of tosca-rock: here a skeleton of the\r\nMegatherium and the bones of other extinct quadrupeds (see the list at\r\nthe end of this chapter) were found. Large quantities of crystallised\r\ngypsum (of which specimens were given me) occur in the cliffs of this\r\nriver; and likewise (as I was assured by Mr. Lumb) in the Pampean mud\r\non the River Chuelo, seven leagues from Buenos Ayres: I mention this\r\nbecause M. d’Orbigny lays some stress on the supposed absence of this\r\nmineral in the Pampean formation.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Salado the country is low and swampy, with tosca-rock\r\nappearing at long intervals at the surface. On the banks, however, of\r\nthe Tapalguen (sixty miles south of the Salado) there is a large extent\r\nof tosca-rock, some highly compact and even semi-crystalline, overlying\r\npale Pampean mud with the usual concretions. Thirty miles further\r\nsouth, the small quartz-ridge of Tapalguen is fringed on its northern\r\nand southern flank, by little, narrow, flat-topped hills of tosca-rock,\r\nwhich stand higher than the surrounding plain. Between this ridge and\r\nthe Sierra of Guitru-gueyu, a distance of sixty miles, the country is\r\nswampy, with the tosca-rock appearing only in four or five spots: this\r\nsierra, precisely like that of Tapalguen, is bordered by horizontal,\r\noften cliff-bounded, little hills of tosca-rock, higher than the\r\nsurrounding plain. Here, also, a new appearance was presented in some\r\nextensive and level banks of alluvium or detritus of the neighbouring\r\nmetamorphic rocks; but I neglected to observe whether it was stratified\r\nor not. Between Guitru-gueyu and the Sierra Ventana, I crossed a dry\r\nplain of tosca-rock higher than the country hitherto passed over, and\r\nwith small pieces of denuded tableland of the same formation, standing\r\nstill higher.\r\n\r\nThe marly or calcareous beds not only come up nearly horizontally to\r\nthe northern and southern foot of the great quartzose mountains of the\r\nSierra Ventana, but interfold between the parallel ranges. The\r\nsuperficial beds (for I nowhere obtained sections more than twenty feet\r\ndeep) retain, even close to the mountains, their usual character: the\r\nuppermost layer, however, in one place included pebbles of quartz, and\r\nrested on a mass of detritus of the same rock. At the very foot of the\r\nmountains, there were some few piles of quartz and tosca-rock detritus,\r\nincluding land-shells; but at the distance of only half a mile\r\nfrom these lofty, jagged, and battered mountains, I could not, to my\r\ngreat surprise, find on the boundless surface of the calcareous plain\r\neven a single pebble. Quartz-pebbles, however, of considerable size\r\nhave at some period been transported to a distance of between forty and\r\nfifty miles to the shores of Bahia Blanca.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Schmidtmeyer (“Travels in Chile,” p. 150) states that he first\r\n noticed on the Pampas, very small bits of red granite, when fifty\r\n miles distant from the southern extremity of the mountains of Cordova,\r\n which project on the plain, like a reef into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest peak of the St. Ventana is, by Captain Fitzroy’s\r\nmeasurement, 3,340 feet, and the calcareous plain at its foot (from\r\nobservations taken by some Spanish officers[2]) 840 feet above the\r\nsea-level. On the flanks of the mountains, at a height of three hundred\r\nor four hundred feet above the plain, there were a few small patches of\r\nconglomerate and breccia, firmly cemented by ferruginous matter to the\r\nabrupt and battered face of the quartz—traces being thus exhibited of\r\nancient sea-action. The high plain round this range sinks quite\r\ninsensibly to the eye on all sides, except to the north, where its\r\nsurface is broken into low cliffs. Round the Sierras Tapalguen,\r\nGuitru-gueyu, and between the latter and the Ventana we have seen (and\r\nshall hereafter see round some hills in Banda Oriental), that the\r\ntosca-rock forms low, flat-topped, cliff-bounded hills, higher than the\r\nsurrounding plains of similar composition. From the horizontal\r\nstratification and from the appearance of the broken cliffs, the\r\ngreater height of the Pampean formation round these primary hills ought\r\nnot to be altogether or in chief part attributed to these several\r\npoints having been uplifted more energetically than the surrounding\r\ncountry, but to the argillaceo-calcareous mud having collected round\r\nthem, when they existed as islets or submarine rocks, at a greater\r\nheight, than at the bottom of the adjoining open sea;—the cliffs having\r\nbeen subsequently worn during the elevation of the whole country in\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n [2] “La Plata,” etc., by Sir W. Parish, p. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthward of the Ventana, the plain extends farther than the eye can\r\nrange; its surface is not very level, having slight depressions with no\r\ndrainage exits; it is generally covered by a few feet in thickness of\r\nsandy earth; and in some places, according to M. Parchappe,[3] beds of\r\nclay two yards thick. On the banks of the Sauce, four leagues S.E. of\r\nthe Ventana, there is an imperfect section about two hundred feet in\r\nheight, displaying in the upper part tosca-rock and in the lower part\r\nred Pampean mud. At the settlement of Bahia Blanca, the uppermost plain\r\nis composed of very compact, stratified tosca-rock, containing rounded\r\ngrains of quartz distinguishable by the naked eye: the lower plain, on\r\nwhich the fortress stands, is described by M. Parchappe[4] as composed\r\nof solid tosca-rock; but the sections which I examined appeared more\r\nlike a redeposited mass of this rock, with small pebbles and fragments\r\nof quartz. I shall immediately return to the important sections on the\r\nshores of Bahia Blanca. Twenty miles southward of\r\nthis place, there is a remarkable ridge extending W. by N. and E. by\r\nS., formed of small, separate, flat-topped, steep-sided hills, rising\r\nbetween one hundred and two hundred feet above the Pampean plain at its\r\nsouthern base, which plain is a little lower than that to the north.\r\nThe uppermost stratum in this ridge consists of pale, highly\r\ncalcareous, compact tosca-rock, resting (as seen in one place) on\r\nreddish Pampean mud, and this again on a paler kind: at the foot of the\r\nridge, there is a well in reddish clay or mud. I have seen no other\r\ninstance of a chain of hills belonging to the Pampean formation; and as\r\nthe strata show no signs of disturbance, and as the direction of the\r\nridge is the same with that common to all the metamorphic lines in this\r\nwhole area, I suspect that the Pampean sediment has in this instance\r\nbeen accumulated on and over a ridge of hard rocks, instead of, as in\r\nthe case of the above-mentioned Sierras, round their submarine flanks.\r\nSouth of this little chain of tosca-rock, a plain of Pampean mud\r\ndeclines towards the banks of the Colorado: in the middle a well has\r\nbeen dug in red Pampean mud, covered by two feet of white, softish,\r\nhighly calcareous tosca-rock, over which lies sand with small pebbles\r\nthree feet in thickness—the first appearance of that vast shingle\r\nformation described in the First Chapter. In the first section after\r\ncrossing the Colorado, an old tertiary formation, namely, the Rio Negro\r\nsandstone (to be described in the next chapter), is met with: but from\r\nthe accounts given me by the Gauchos, I believe that at the mouth of\r\nthe Colorado the Pampean formation extends a little further southwards.\r\n\r\n [3] M. d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Géolog., pp. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bahia Blanca._—To return to the shores of this bay. At Monte Hermoso\r\nthere is a good section, about one hundred feet in height, of four\r\ndistinct strata, appearing to the eye horizontal, but thickening a\r\nlittle towards the N.W. The uppermost bed, about twenty feet in\r\nthickness, consists of obliquely laminated, soft sandstone, including\r\nmany pebbles of quartz, and falling at the surface into loose sand. The\r\nsecond bed, only six inches thick, is a hard, dark-coloured sandstone.\r\nThe third bed is pale-coloured Pampean mud; and the fourth is of the\r\nsame nature, but darker coloured, including in its lower part\r\nhorizontal layers and lines of concretions of not very compact pinkish\r\ntosca-rock. The bottom of the sea, I may remark, to a distance of\r\nseveral miles from the shore, and to a depth of between sixty and one\r\nhundred feet, was found by the anchors to be composed of tosca-rock and\r\nreddish Pampean mud. Professor Ehrenberg has examined for me specimens\r\nof the two lower beds, and finds in them three Polygastrica and six\r\nPhytolitharia.[5] Of these, only one (_Spongolithis\r\nFustis?_) is a marine form; five of them are identical with\r\nmicroscopical structures of brackish-water origin, hereafter to be\r\nmentioned, which form a central point in the Pampean formation. In\r\nthese two beds, especially in the lower one, bones of extinct\r\nmammifers, some embedded in their proper relative positions and others\r\nsingle, are very numerous in a small extent of the cliffs. These\r\nremains consist of, first, the head of Ctenomys antiquus, allied to the\r\nliving Ctenomys Braziliensis; secondly, a fragment of the remains of a\r\nrodent; thirdly, molar teeth and other bones of a large rodent, closely\r\nallied to, but distinct from, the existing species of Hydrochoerus, and\r\ntherefore probably an inhabitant of fresh water; fourth and fifthly,\r\nportions of vertebræ, limbs, ribs, and other bones of two rodents;\r\nsixthly, bones of the extremities of some great megatheroid\r\nquadruped.[6] The number of the remains of rodents gives to this\r\ncollection a peculiar character, compared with those found in any other\r\nlocality. All these bones are compact and heavy; many of them are\r\nstained red, with their surfaces polished; some of the smaller ones are\r\nas black as jet.\r\n\r\n [5] The following list is given in the “Monatsberichten der könig.\r\n Akad. zu Berlin,” April 1845:—\r\n\r\nPOLYGASTRICA.\r\n    Fragilaria rhabdosoma.\r\n    Gallionella distans.\r\n    Pinnularia?\r\nPHYTOLITHARIA.\r\n    Lithodontium Bursa.\r\n    Lithodontium furcatum.\r\n    Lithostylidium exesum.\r\n    Lithostylidium rude.\r\n    Lithostylidium Serra.\r\n    Spongolithis Fustis?\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] See “Fossil Mammalia” (p. 109) by Professor Owen, in the “Zoology\r\n of the Voyage of the _Beagle_;” and Catalogue (p. 36) of Fossil\r\n Remains in Museum of Royal College of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nMonte Hermoso is between fifty and sixty miles distant in a S.E. line\r\nfrom the Ventana, with the intermediate country gently rising towards\r\nit, and all consisting of the Pampean formation. What relation, then,\r\ndo these beds, at the level of the sea and under it, bear to those on\r\nthe flanks of the Ventana, at the height of 840 feet, and on the flanks\r\nof the other neighbouring sierras, which, from the reasons already\r\nassigned, do not appear to owe their greater height to unequal\r\nelevation? When the tosca-rock was accumulating round the Ventana, and\r\nwhen, with the exception of a few small rugged primary islands, the\r\nwhole wide surrounding plains must have been under water, were the\r\nstrata at Monte Hermoso depositing at the bottom of a great open sea,\r\nbetween eight hundred and one thousand feet in depth? I much doubt\r\nthis; for if so, the almost perfect carcasses of the several small\r\nrodents, the remains of which are so very numerous in so limited a\r\nspace, must have been drifted to this spot from the distance of many\r\nhundred miles. It appears to me far more probable, that during the\r\nPampean period this whole area had commenced slowly rising (and in the\r\ncliffs, at several different heights we have proofs of the land having\r\nbeen exposed to sea-action at several levels), and that tracts of land\r\nhad thus been formed of Pampean sediment round the Ventana and the\r\nother primary ranges, on which the several rodents and other quadrupeds\r\nlived, and that a stream (in which perhaps the extinct aquatic\r\nHydrochoerus lived) drifted their bodies into the adjoining sea, into\r\nwhich the Pampean mud continued to be poured from the north. As the\r\nland continued to rise, it appears that this source of sediment was cut\r\noff; and in its place sand and pebbles were borne down by stronger\r\ncurrents, and conformably deposited over the Pampean strata.\r\n\r\nPunta Alta is situated about thirty miles higher up on the northern\r\nside of this same bay: it consists of a small plain, between twenty and\r\nthirty feet in height, cut off on the shore by a line of low cliffs\r\nabout a mile in length, represented in figure No. 15 with its vertical\r\nscale necessarily exaggerated. The lower bed (A) is more extensive than\r\nthe upper ones; it consists of stratified gravel or conglomerate,\r\ncemented by calcareo-arenaceous matter, and is divided by curvilinear\r\nlayers of pinkish marl, of which some are precisely like tosca-rock,\r\nand some more sandy. The beds are curvilinear, owing to the action of\r\ncurrents, and dip in different directions; they include an\r\nextraordinary number of bones of gigantic mammifers and many shells.\r\nThe pebbles are of considerable size, and are of hard sandstone, and of\r\nquartz, like that of the Ventana: there are also a few well-rounded\r\nmasses of tosca-rock.\r\n\r\nNo. 15\r\nSection of beds with recent shells and extinct mammifers, at Punta Alta\r\nin Bahia Blanca.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of beds at Punta Alta in Bahia Blanca.]\r\n\r\nThe second bed (B) is about fifteen feet in thickness, but towards both\r\nextremities of the cliff (not included in the diagram) it either thins\r\nout and dies away, or passes insensibly into an overlying bed of\r\ngravel. It consists of red, tough clayey mud, with minute linear\r\ncavities; it is marked with faint horizontal shades of colour; it\r\nincludes a few pebbles, and rarely a minute particle of shell: in one\r\nspot, the dermal armour and a few bones of a Dasypoid quadruped were\r\nembedded in it: it fills up furrows in the underlying gravel. With the\r\nexception of the few pebbles and particles of shells, this bed\r\nresembles the true Pampean mud; but it still more closely resembles the\r\nclayey flats (mentioned in the First Chapter) separating the\r\nsuccessively rising parallel ranges of sand-dunes.\r\n\r\nThe bed (C) is of stratified gravel, like the lowest one; it fills up\r\nfurrows in the underlying red mud, and is sometimes interstratified\r\nwith it, and sometimes insensibly passes into it; as the red mud thins\r\nout, this upper gravel thickens. Shells are more numerous in it than in\r\nthe lower gravel; but the bones, though some are still present, are\r\nless numerous. In one part, however, where this gravel and the red mud\r\npassed into each other, I found several bones and a tolerably perfect\r\nhead of the Megatherium. Some of the large Volutas, though embedded in\r\nthe gravel-bed (C), were filled with the red mud, including great\r\nnumbers of the little recent _Paludestrina australis._ These three\r\nlower beds are covered by an unconformable mantle (D) of stratified\r\nsandy earth, including many pebbles of quartz, pumice and phonolite,\r\nland and sea-shells.\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny has been so obliging as to name for me the twenty species\r\nof Mollusca embedded in the two gravel beds: they consist of:—\r\n\r\n\r\nVolutella angulata, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Mollusq. and Pal.\r\n\r\nVoluta Braziliana, Sol.\r\n\r\nOlicancilleria Braziliensis, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nOlicancilleria auricularia, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nOlivina puelchana, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nBuccinanops cochlidium, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nBuccinanops globulosum, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nColombella sertulariarum, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nTrochus Patagonicus, and var. of ditto, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nPaludestrina Australis, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nFissurella Patagonica, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nCrepidula muricata, Lam.\r\n\r\nVenus purpurata, Lam.\r\n\r\nVenus rostrata, Phillippi.\r\n\r\nMytilus Darwinianus, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nNucula semiornata, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nCardita Patagonica, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nCorbula Patagonica (?), d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nPecten tethuelchus, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nOstrea puelchana, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nA living species of Balanus.\r\n\r\nand 23. An Astræ and encrusting Flustra, apparently identical with\r\nspecies now living in the bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these shells now live on this coast, and most of them in this same\r\nbay. I was also struck with the fact, that the proportional numbers of\r\nthe different kinds appeared to be the same with those now cast up on\r\nthe beach: in both cases specimens of Voluta, Crepidula, Venus, and\r\nTrochus are the most abundant. Four or five of the species are the same\r\nwith the upraised shells on the Pampas near Buenos Ayres. All the\r\nspecimens have a very ancient and bleached appearance,[7] and do not\r\nemit, when heated, an animal odour: some of them are changed throughout\r\ninto a white, soft, fibrous substance; others have the space between\r\nthe external walls, either hollow, or filled up with crystalline\r\ncarbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n [7] A Bulinus, mentioned in the Introduction to the “Fossil Mammalia”\r\n in the “Zoology of the Voyage of the _ Beagle_” has so much fresher an\r\n appearance, than the marine species, that I suspect it must have\r\n fallen amongst the others, and been collected by mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remains of the extinct mammiferous animals, from the two gravel\r\nbeds have been described by Professor Owen in the “Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the _Beagle_:” they consist of, 1st, one nearly perfect head\r\nand three fragments of heads of the _ Megatherium Cuvierii_; 2nd, a\r\nlower jaw of _Megalonyx Jeffersonii_; 3rd, lower jaw of _Mylodon\r\nDarwinii_; 4th, fragments of a head of some gigantic Edental quadruped;\r\n5th, an almost entire skeleton of the great _Scelidotherium\r\nleptocephalum_, with most of the bones, including the head, vertebræ,\r\nribs, some of the extremities to the claw-bone, and even, as remarked\r\nby Professor Owen, the knee-cap, all nearly in their proper relative\r\npositions; 6th, fragments of the jaw and a separate tooth of a Toxodon,\r\nbelonging either to _T. Platensis_, or to a second species lately\r\ndiscovered near Buenos Ayres; 7th, a tooth of _Equus curvidens_; 8th,\r\ntooth of a Pachyderm, closely allied to Palæotherium, of which parts of\r\nthe head have been lately sent from Buenos Ayres to the British Museum;\r\nin all probability this pachyderm is identical with the _ Macrauchenia\r\nPatagonica_ from Port S. Julian, hereafter to be referred to. Lastly,\r\nand 9thly, in a cliff of the red clayey bed (B), there was a double\r\npiece, about three feet long and two wide, of the bony armour of a\r\nlarge Dasypoid quadruped, with the two sides pressed nearly close\r\ntogether: as the\r\ncliff is now rapidly washing away, this fossil probably was lately much\r\nmore perfect; from between its doubled-up sides, I extracted the middle\r\nand ungual phalanges, united together, of one of the feet, and likewise\r\na separate phalanx: hence one or more of the limbs must have been\r\nattached to the dermal case, when it was embedded. Besides these\r\nseveral remains in a distinguishable condition, there were very many\r\nsingle bones: the greater number were embedded in a space 200 yards\r\nsquare. The preponderance of the Edental quadrupeds is remarkable; as\r\nis, in contrast with the beds of Monte Hermoso, the absence of Rodents.\r\nMost of the bones are now in a soft and friable condition, and, like\r\nthe shells, do not emit when burnt an animal odour. The decayed state\r\nof the bones may be partly owing to their late exposure to the air and\r\ntidal-waves. Barnacles, Serpulæ, and corallines are attached to many of\r\nthe bones, but I neglected to observe[8] whether these might not have\r\ngrown on them since being exposed to the present tidal action; but I\r\nbelieve that some of the barnacles must have grown on the\r\nScelidotherium, soon after being deposited, and before being _wholly_\r\ncovered up by the gravel. Besides the remains in the condition here\r\ndescribed, I found one single fragment of bone very much rolled, and as\r\nblack as jet, so as perfectly to resemble some of the remains from\r\nMonte Hermoso.\r\n\r\n [8] After having packed up my specimens at Bahia Blanca, this point\r\n occurred to me, and I noted it; but forgot it on my return, until the\r\n remains had been cleaned and oiled: my attention has been lately\r\n called to the subject by some remarks by M. d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nVery many of the bones had been broken, abraded, and rolled, before\r\nbeing embedded. Others, even some of those included in the coarsest\r\nparts of the the now hard conglomerate, still retain all their minutest\r\nprominences perfectly preserved; so that I conclude that they probably\r\nwere protected by skin, flesh, or ligaments, whilst being covered up.\r\nIn the case of the Scelidotherium, it is quite certain that the whole\r\nskeleton was held together by its ligaments, when deposited in the\r\ngravel in which I found it. Some cervical vertebræ and a humerus of\r\ncorresponding size lay so close together, as did some ribs and the\r\nbones of a leg, that I thought that they must originally have belonged\r\nto two skeletons, and not have been washed in single; but as remains\r\nwere here very numerous, I will not lay much stress on these two cases.\r\nWe have just seen that the armour of the Dasypoid quadruped was\r\ncertainly embedded together with some of the bones of the feet.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg[9] has examined for me specimens of the finer\r\nmatter from in contact with these mammiferous remains: he finds in them\r\ntwo Polygastrica, decidedly marine forms; and six Phytolitharia, of\r\nwhich one is probably marine, and the others either of fresh-water or\r\nterrestrial origin. Only one of these eight microscopical bodies is\r\ncommon to the nine from Monte Hermoso: but five of them are in common\r\nwith those from the Pampean mud on the banks of the Parana. The\r\npresence of any fresh-water infusoria, considering the aridity of the\r\nsurrounding country, is here remarkable: the most probable explanation\r\nappears to be, that these microscopical organisms were washed out of\r\nthe adjoining great Pampean formation during its denudation, and\r\nafterwards redeposited.\r\n\r\n [9] “Monatsberichten der Akad. zu Berlin,” April 1845. The list\r\n consists of:—\r\n\r\nPOLYGASTRICA.\r\n    Gallionella sulcata.\r\n    Stauroptera aspera? fragm.\r\n PHYTOLITHARIA.\r\n    Lithasteriscus tuberculatus.\r\n    Lithostylidium Clepsammidium.\r\n    Lithostylidium quadratum.\r\n    Lithostylidium rude.\r\n    Lithostylidium unidentatum.\r\n    Spongolithis acicularis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now see what conclusions may be drawn from the facts above\r\ndetailed. It is certain that the gravel-beds and intermediate red mud\r\nwere deposited within the period, when existing species of Mollusca\r\nheld to each other nearly the same relative proportions as they do on\r\nthe present coast. These beds, from the number of littoral species,\r\nmust have been accumulated in shallow water; but not, judging from the\r\nstratification of the gravel and the layers of marl, on a beach. From\r\nthe manner in which the red clay fills up furrows in the underlying\r\ngravel, and is in some parts itself furrowed by the overlying gravel,\r\nwhilst in other parts it either insensibly passes into, or alternates\r\nwith, this upper gravel, we may infer several local changes in the\r\ncurrents, perhaps caused by slight changes, up or down, in the level of\r\nthe land. By the elevation of these beds, to which period the alluvial\r\nmantle with pumice-pebbles, land and sea-shells belongs, the plain of\r\nPunta Alta, from twenty to thirty feet in height, was formed. In this\r\nneighbourhood there are other and higher sea-formed plains and lines of\r\ncliffs in the Pampean formation worn by the denuding action of the\r\nwaves at different levels. Hence we can easily understand the presence\r\nof rounded masses of tosca-rock in this lowest plain; and likewise, as\r\nthe cliffs at Monte Hermoso with their mammiferous remains stand at a\r\nhigher level, the presence of the one much-rolled fragment of bone\r\nwhich was as black as jet: possibly some few of the other much-rolled\r\nbones may have been similarly derived, though I saw only the one\r\nfragment, in the same condition with those from Monte Hermoso. M.\r\nd’Orbigny has suggested[10] that all these mammiferous remains may have\r\nbeen washed out of the Pampean formation, and afterwards redeposited\r\ntogether with the recent shells. Undoubtedly it is a marvellous fact\r\nthat these numerous gigantic quadrupeds, belonging, with the exception\r\nof the _Equus curvidens_, to seven extinct genera, and one, namely, the\r\nToxodon, not falling into any existing family, should have co-existed\r\nwith Mollusca, all of which are still living species; but analogous\r\nfacts have been observed in North America and in Europe. In the first\r\nplace, it should not be overlooked, that most of the co-embedded shells\r\nhave a more ancient and altered appearance than the bones. In the\r\nsecond place, is it probable that numerous bones not hardened by silex\r\nor any other mineral, could have retained their delicate prominences\r\nand surfaces perfect if they\r\nhad been washed out of one deposit, and re-embedded in another:—this\r\nlater deposit being formed of large, hard pebbles, arranged by the\r\naction of currents or breakers in shallow water into variously curved\r\nand inclined layers? The bones which are now in so perfect a state of\r\npreservation, must, I conceive, have been fresh and sound when\r\nembedded, and probably were protected by skin, flesh, or ligaments. The\r\nskeleton of the Scelidotherium indisputably was deposited entire: shall\r\nwe say that when held together by its matrix it was washed out of an\r\nold gravel-bed (totally unlike in character to the Pampean formation),\r\nand re-embedded in another gravel-bed, composed (I speak after careful\r\ncomparison) of exactly the same kind of pebbles, in the same kind of\r\ncement? I will lay no stress on the two cases of several ribs and bones\r\nof the extremities having _apparently_ been embedded in their proper\r\nrelative position: but will any one be so bold as to affirm that it is\r\npossible, that a piece of the thin tessellated armour of a Dasypoid\r\nquadruped, at least three feet long and two in width, and now so tender\r\nthat I was unable with the utmost care to extract a fragment more than\r\ntwo or three inches square, could have been washed out of one bed, and\r\nre-embedded in another, together with some of the small bones of the\r\nfeet, without having been dashed into atoms? We must then wholly reject\r\nM. d’Orbigny’s supposition, and admit as certain, that the\r\nScelidotherium and the large Dasypoid quadruped, and as highly\r\nprobable, that the Toxodon, Megatherium, etc., some of the bones of\r\nwhich are perfectly preserved, were embedded for the first time, and in\r\na fresh condition, in the strata in which they were found entombed.\r\nThese gigantic quadrupeds, therefore, though belonging to extinct\r\ngenera and families, coexisted with the twenty above-enumerated\r\nMollusca, the barnacle and two corals, still living on this coast. From\r\nthe rolled fragment of black bone, and from the plain of Punta Alta\r\nbeing lower than that of Monte Hermoso, I conclude that the coarse\r\nsub-littoral deposits of Punta Alta, are of subsequent origin to the\r\nPampean mud of Monte Hermoso; and the beds at this latter place, as we\r\nhave seen, are probably of subsequent origin to the high tosca-plain\r\nround the Sierra Ventana: we shall, however, return, at the end of this\r\nchapter, to the consideration of these several stages in the great\r\nPampean formation.\r\n\r\n [10] “Voyage,” Part. Géolog., p. 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buenos Ayres to St. Fé Bajada, in Entre Rios._—For some distance\r\nnorthward of Buenos Ayres, the escarpment of the Pampean formation does\r\nnot approach very near to the Plata, and it is concealed by vegetation:\r\nbut in sections on the banks of the Rios Luxan, Areco, and Arrecifes, I\r\nobserved both pale and dark reddish Pampean mud, with small, whitish\r\nconcretions of tosca; at all these places mammiferous remains have been\r\nfound. In the cliffs on the Parana, at San Nicolas, the Pampean mud\r\ncontains but little tosca; here M. d’Orbigny found the remains of two\r\nrodents (_Ctenomys Bonariensis_ and _Kerodon antiquus_) and the jaw of\r\na Canis: when on the river I could clearly distinguish in this fine\r\nline of cliffs, “horizontal lines of variation both in tint and\r\ncompactness.”[11] The plain northward of this point is very\r\nlevel, but with some depressions and lakes; I estimated its height at\r\nfrom forty to sixty feet above the Parana. At the A. Medio the bright\r\nred Pampean mud contains scarcely any tosca-rock; whilst at a short\r\ndistance the stream of the Pabon, forms a cascade, about twenty feet in\r\nheight, over a cavernous mass of two varieties of tosca-rock; of which\r\none is very compact and semi-crystalline, with seams of crystallised\r\ncarbonate of lime: similar compact varieties are met with on the\r\nSalidillo and Seco. The absolute identity (I speak after a comparison\r\nof my specimens) between some of these varieties, and those from\r\nTapalguen, and from the ridge south of Bahia Blanca, a distance of 400\r\nmiles of latitude, is very striking.\r\n\r\n [11] I quote these words from my note-book, as written down on the\r\n spot, on account of the general absence of stratification in the\r\n Pampean formation having been insisted on by M. d’Orbigny as a proof\r\n of the diluvial origin of this great deposit.\r\n\r\nAt Rosario there is but little tosca-rock: near this place I first\r\nnoticed at the edge of the river traces of an underlying formation,\r\nwhich, twenty-five miles higher up in the estancia of Gorodona,\r\nconsists of a pale yellowish clay, abounding with concretionary\r\ncylinders of a ferruginous sandstone. This bed, which is probably the\r\nequivalent of the older tertiary marine strata, immediately to be\r\ndescribed in Entre Rios, only just rises above the level of the Parana\r\nwhen low. The rest of the cliff at Gorodona, is formed of red Pampean\r\nmud, with, in the lower part, many concretions of tosca, some\r\nstalacti-formed, and with only a few in the upper part: at the height\r\nof six feet above the river, two gigantic skeletons of the _Mastodon\r\nAndium_ were here embedded; their bones were scattered a few feet\r\napart, but many of them still held their proper relative positions:\r\nthey were much decayed and as soft as cheese, so that even one of the\r\ngreat molar teeth fell into pieces in my hand. We here see that the\r\nPampean deposit contains mammiferous remains close to its base. On the\r\nbanks of the Carcarana, a few miles distant, the lowest bed visible was\r\npale Pampean mud, with masses of tosca-rock, in one of which I found a\r\nmuch decayed tooth of the Mastodon: above this bed, there was a thin\r\nlayer almost composed of small concretions of white tosca, out of which\r\nI extracted a well preserved, but slightly broken tooth of _Toxodon\r\nPlatensis_: above this there was an unusual bed of very soft impure\r\nsandstone. In this neighbourhood I noticed many single embedded bones,\r\nand I heard of others having been found in so perfect a state that they\r\nwere long used as gate-posts: the Jesuit Falkner found here the dermal\r\narmour of some gigantic Edental quadruped.\r\n\r\nIn some of the red mud scraped from a tooth of one of the Mastodons at\r\nGorodona, Professor Ehrenberg finds seven Polygastrica and thirteen\r\nPhytolitharia,[12] all of them, I believe, with two exceptions, already\r\nknown species. Of these twenty, the preponderating number are of\r\nfresh-water origin; only two species of Coscinodiscus and a\r\nSpongolithis show the direct influence of the sea; therefore Professor\r\nEhrenberg arrives at the important conclusion that the deposit must\r\nhave been of brackish-water origin. Of the thirteen Phytolitharia, nine\r\nare met with in the two deposits in Bahia Blanca, where there is\r\nevidence from two other species of Polygastrica that the beds were\r\naccumulated in brackish water. The traces of coral, sponges, and\r\nPolythalamia, found by Dr. Carpenter in the tosca-rock (of which I must\r\nobserve the greater number of specimens were from the upper beds in the\r\nsouthern parts of the formation), apparently show a more purely marine\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n [12] “Monatsberichten der könig. Akad. zu Berlin,” April 1845. The\r\n list consists of:—\r\n\r\n POLYGASTRICA.\r\n    Campylodiscus clypeus.\r\n    Coscinodiscus subtilis.\r\n    Coscinodiscus al. sp.\r\n    Eunotia.\r\n    Gallionella granulata.\r\n    Himantidium gracile.\r\n    Pinnularia borealis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt _St. Fé Bajada_, in Entre Rios, the cliffs, estimated at between\r\nsixty and seventy feet in height, expose an interesting section: the\r\nlower half consists of tertiary strata with marine shells, and the\r\nupper half of the Pampean formation. The lowest bed is an obliquely\r\nlaminated, blackish, indurated mud, with distinct traces of vegetable\r\nremains.[13] Above this there is a thick bed of yellowish sandy clay,\r\nwith much crystallised gypsum and many shells of Ostreæ, Pectens, and\r\nArcæ: above this there generally comes an arenaceous crystalline\r\nlimestone, but there is sometimes interposed a bed, about twelve feet\r\nthick, of dark green, soapy clay, weathering into small angular\r\nfragments. The limestone, where purest, is white, highly crystalline,\r\nand full of cavities: it includes small pebbles of quartz, broken\r\nshells, teeth of sharks, and sometimes, as I was informed, large bones:\r\nit often contains so much sand as to pass into a calcareous sandstone,\r\nand in such parts the great _Ostrea Patagonica_[14] chiefly abounds. In\r\nthe upper part, the limestone alternates with layers of fine white\r\nsand. The shells included in these beds have been named for me by M.\r\nd’Orbigny: they consist of:—\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Pal.\r\n\r\nOstrea Alvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Pal.\r\n\r\nPecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Pal.\r\n\r\nPecten Darwinianus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus Munsterii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nArca Bonplandiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nCardium Platense, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nTellina, probably nov. spec., but too imperfect for description.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLITHARIA.\r\n    Lithasteriscus tuberculatus.\r\n    Lithodontium bursa.\r\n    Lithodontium furcatum.\r\n    Lithodontium rostratum.\r\n    Lithostylidium Amphiodon.\r\n    Lithostylidium Clepsammidium.\r\n    Lithostylidium Hamus.\r\n    Lithostylidium polyedrum.\r\n    Lithostylidium quadratum.\r\n    Lithostylidium rude.\r\n    Lithostylidium Serra.\r\n    Lithostylidium unidentatum.\r\n    Spongolithis Fustis.\r\n\r\n [13] M. d’Orbigny has given (“Voyage,” Part. Géolog., p. 37) a\r\n detailed description of this section, but as he does not mention this\r\n lowest bed, it may have been concealed when he was there by the river.\r\n There is a considerable discrepancy between his description and mine,\r\n which I can only account for by the beds themselves varying\r\n considerably in short distances.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Captain Sulivan, R.N., has given me a specimen of this shell,\r\n which he found in the cliffs at Point Cerrito, between twenty and\r\n thirty miles above the Bajada.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese species are all extinct: the six first were found by M. d’Orbigny\r\nand myself in the formations of the Rio Negro, S. Josef, and other\r\nparts of Patagonia; and therefore, as first observed by M. d’Orbigny,\r\nthese beds certainly belong to the great Patagonian formation, which\r\nwill be described in the ensuing chapter, and which we shall see must\r\nbe considered as a very ancient tertiary one. North of the Bajada, M.\r\nd’Orbigny found, in beds which he considers as lying beneath the strata\r\nhere described, remains of a Toxodon, which he has named as a distinct\r\nspecies from the _T. Platensis_ of the Pampean formation. Much\r\nsilicified wood is found on the banks of the Parana (and likewise on\r\nthe Uruguay), and I was informed that they come out of these lower\r\nbeds; four specimens collected by myself are dicotyledonous.\r\n\r\nThe upper half of the cliff, to a thickness of about thirty feet,\r\nconsists of Pampean mud, of which the lower part is pale-coloured, and\r\nthe upper part of a brighter red, with some irregular layers of an\r\narenaceous variety of tosca, and a few small concretions of the\r\nordinary kind. Close above the marine limestone, there is a thin\r\nstratum with a concretionary outline of white hard tosca-rock or marl,\r\nwhich may be considered either as the uppermost bed of the inferior\r\ndeposits, or the lowest of the Pampean formation; at one time I\r\nconsidered this bed as marking a passage between the two formations:\r\nbut I have since become convinced that I was deceived on this point. In\r\nthe section on the Parana, I did not find any mammiferous remains; but\r\nat two miles distance on the A. Tapas (a tributary of the Conchitas),\r\nthey were extremely numerous in a low cliff of red Pampean mud with\r\nsmall concretions, precisely like the upper bed on the Parana. Most of\r\nthe bones were solitary and much decayed; but I saw the dermal armour\r\nof a gigantic Edental quadruped, forming a caldron-like hollow, four or\r\nfive feet in diameter, out of which, as I was informed, the almost\r\nentire skeleton had been lately removed. I found single teeth of the\r\n_Mastodon Andium, Toxodon Platensis_, and _Equus curvidens_, near to\r\neach other. As this latter tooth approaches closely to that of the\r\ncommon horse, I paid particular attention to its true embedment, for I\r\ndid not at that time know that there was a similar tooth hidden in the\r\nmatrix with the other mammiferous remains from Punta Alta. It is an\r\ninteresting circumstance, that Professor Owen finds that the teeth of\r\nthis horse approach more closely in their peculiar curvature to a\r\nfossil specimen brought by Mr. Lyell[15] from North America, than to\r\nthose of any other species of Equus.\r\n\r\n [15] Lyell’s “Travels in North America,” vol. i, p. 164 and “Proc. of\r\n Geolog. Soc.,” vol. iv, p. 39.\r\n\r\nThe underlying marine tertiary strata extend over a wide area: I was\r\nassured that they can be traced in ravines in an east and west line\r\nacross Entre Rios to the Uruguay, a distance of about 135 miles. In a\r\nS.E. direction I heard of their existence at the head of the R. Nankay;\r\nand at P. Gorda in Banda Oriental, a distance of\r\n170 miles, I found the same limestone, containing the same fossil\r\nshells, lying at about the same level above the river as at St. Fe. In\r\na southerly direction, these beds sink in height, for at another P.\r\nGorda in Entre Rios, the limestone is seen at a much less height; and\r\nthere can be little doubt that the yellowish sandy clay, on a level\r\nwith the river, between the Carcarana and S. Nicholas, belongs to this\r\nsame formation; as perhaps do the beds of sand at Buenos Ayres, which\r\nlie at the bottom of the Pampean formation, about sixty feet beneath\r\nthe surface of the Plata. The southerly declination of these beds may\r\nperhaps be due, not to unequal elevation, but to the original form of\r\nthe bottom of the sea, sloping from land situated to the north; for\r\nthat land existed at no great distance, we have evidence in the\r\nvegetable remains in the lowest bed at St. Fe; and in the silicified\r\nwood and in the bones of _Toxodon Paranensis_, found (according to M.\r\nd’Orbigny) in still lower strata.\r\n\r\n_Banda Oriental._—This province lies on the northern side of the Plata,\r\nand eastward of the Uruguay: it has a gentle undulatory surface, with a\r\nbasis of primary rocks; and is in most parts covered up with an\r\nunstratified mass, of no great thickness, of reddish Pampean mud. In\r\nthe eastern half, near Maldonado, this deposit is more arenaceous than\r\nin the Pampas, it contains many though small concretions of marl or\r\ntosca-rock, and others of highly ferruginous sandstone; in one section,\r\nonly a few yards in depth, it rested on stratified sand. Near Monte\r\nVideo this deposit in some spots appears to be of greater thickness;\r\nand the remains of the Glyptodon and other extinct mammifers have been\r\nfound in it. In the long line of cliffs, between fifty and sixty feet\r\nin height, called the Barrancas de S. Gregorio, which extend westward\r\nof the Rio S. Lucia, the lower half is formed of coarse sand of quartz\r\nand feldspar without mica, like that now cast up on the beach near\r\nMaldonado; and the upper half of Pampean mud, varying in colour and\r\ncontaining honeycombed veins of soft calcareous matter and small\r\nconcretions of tosca-rock arranged in lines, and likewise a few pebbles\r\nof quartz. This deposit fills up hollows and furrows in the underlying\r\nsand; appearing as if water charged with mud had invaded a sandy beach.\r\nThese cliffs extend far westward, and at a distance of sixty miles,\r\nnear Colonia del Sacramiento, I found the Pampean deposit resting in\r\nsome places on this sand, and in others on the primary rocks: between\r\nthe sand and the reddish mud, there appeared to be interposed, but the\r\nsection was not a very good one, a thin bed of shells of an existing\r\nMytilus, still partially retaining their colour. The Pampean formation\r\nin Banda Oriental might readily be mistaken for an alluvial deposit:\r\ncompared with that of the Pampas, it is often more sandy, and contains\r\nsmall fragments of quartz; the concretions are much smaller, and there\r\nare no extensive masses of tosca-rock.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme western parts of this province, between the Uruguay and\r\na line drawn from Colonia to the R. Perdido (a tributary of the R.\r\nNegro), the formations are far more complicated. Besides primary rocks,\r\nwe meet with extensive tracts and many flat-topped, horizontally\r\nstratified, cliff-bounded, isolated hills of tertiary strata, varying\r\nextraordinarily in mineralogical nature, some identical with the old\r\nmarine beds of St. Fé Bajada, and some with those of the much more\r\nrecent Pampean formation. There are, also, extensive _low_ tracts of\r\ncountry covered with a deposit containing mammiferous remains,\r\nprecisely like that just described in the more eastern parts of the\r\nprovince. Although from the smooth and unbroken state of the country, I\r\nnever obtained a section of this latter deposit close to the foot of\r\nthe higher tertiary hills, yet I have not the least doubt that it is of\r\nquite subsequent origin; having been deposited after the sea had worn\r\nthe tertiary strata into the cliff-bounded hills. This later formation,\r\nwhich is certainly the equivalent of that of the Pampas, is well seen\r\nin the valleys in the estancia of Berquelo, near Mercedes; it here\r\nconsists of reddish earth, full of rounded grains of quartz, and with\r\nsome small concretions of tosca-rock arranged in horizontal lines, so\r\nas perfectly to resemble, except in containing a little calcareous\r\nmatter, the formation in the eastern parts of Banda Oriental, in Entre\r\nRios, and at other places: in this estancia the skeleton of a great\r\nEdental quadruped was found. In the valley of the Sarandis, at the\r\ndistance of only a few miles, this deposit has a somewhat different\r\ncharacter, being whiter, softer, finer-grained, and full of little\r\ncavities, and consequently of little specific gravity; nor does it\r\ncontain any concretions or calcareous matter: I here procured a head,\r\nwhich when first discovered must have been quite perfect, of the\r\n_Toxodon Platensis_, another of a Mylodon,[16] perhaps _M. Darwinii_,\r\nand a large piece of dermal armour, differing from that of the\r\n_Glyptodon clavipes._ These bones are remarkable from their\r\nextraordinarily fresh appearance; when held over a lamp of spirits of\r\nwine, they give out a strong odour and burn with a small flame; Mr. T.\r\nReeks has been so kind as to analyse some of the fragments, and he\r\nfinds that they contain about 7 per cent of animal matter, and 8 per\r\ncent of water.[17]\r\n\r\n [16] This head was at first considered by Professor Owen (in the\r\n “Zoology of the _Beagle_’s Voyage”) as belonging to a distinct genus,\r\n namely, Glossotherium.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] Liebig (“Chemistry of Agriculture,” p. 194) states that fresh dry\r\n bones contain from 32 to 33 per cent of dry gelatine. See also Dr.\r\n Daubeny, in _Edin. New Phil. Journ._, vol. xxxvii, p. 293.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe older tertiary strata, forming the higher isolated hills and\r\nextensive tracts of country, vary, as I have said, extraordinarily in\r\ncomposition: within the distance of a few miles, I sometimes passed\r\nover crystalline limestone with agate, calcareous tuffs, and marly\r\nrocks, all passing into each other,—red and pale mud with concretions\r\nof tosca-rock, quite like the Pampean formation,—calcareous\r\nconglomerates and sandstones,—bright red sandstones passing either into\r\nred conglomerate, or into white sandstone,—hard siliceous sandstones,\r\njaspery and chalcedonic rocks, and numerous other subordinate\r\nvarieties. I was unable to mark out the relations of all these strata,\r\nand will describe only a few distinct sections:—in the cliffs between\r\nP. Gorda on the Uruguay and the A. de Vivoras, the upper bed is\r\ncrystalline\r\ncellular limestone often passing into calcareous sandstone, with\r\nimpressions of some of the same shells as at St. Fé Bajada; at P.\r\nGorda,[18] this limestone is interstratified with and rests on, white\r\nsand, which covers a bed about thirty feet thick of pale-coloured clay,\r\nwith many shells of the great _Ostrea Patagonica_: beneath this, in the\r\nvertical cliff, nearly on a level with the river, there is a bed of red\r\nmud absolutely like the Pampean deposit, with numerous often large\r\nconcretions of perfectly characterised white, compact tosca-rock. At\r\nthe mouth of the Vivoras, the river flows over a pale cavernous\r\ntosca-rock, quite like that in the Pampas, and this _appeared_ to\r\nunderlie the crystalline limestone; but the section was not unequivocal\r\nlike that at P. Gorda. These beds now form only a narrow and much\r\ndenuded strip of land; but they must once have extended much further;\r\nfor on the next stream, south of the S. Juan, Captain Sulivan, R.N.,\r\nfound a little cliff, only just above the surface of the river, with\r\nnumerous shells of the _Venus Munsterii_, D’Orbigny,—one of the species\r\noccurring at St. Fé, and of which there are casts at P. Gorda: the line\r\nof cliffs of the subsequently deposited true Pampean mud, extend from\r\nColonia to within half a mile of this spot, and no doubt once covered\r\nup this denuded marine stratum. Again at Colonia, a Frenchman found, in\r\ndigging the foundations of a house, a great mass of the _Ostrea\r\nPatagonica_ (of which I saw many fragments), packed together just\r\nbeneath the surface, and directly superimposed on the gneiss. These\r\nsections are important: M. d’Orbigny is unwilling to believe that beds\r\nof the same nature with the Pampean formation ever underlie the ancient\r\nmarine tertiary strata; and I was as much surprised at it as he could\r\nhave been; but the vertical cliff at P. Gorda allowed of no mistake,\r\nand I must be permitted to affirm, that after having examined the\r\ncountry from the Colorado to St. Fé Bajada, I could not be deceived in\r\nthe mineralogical character of the Pampean deposit.\r\n\r\n [18] In my “Journal” (p. 171, 1st edit.), I have hastily and\r\n inaccurately stated that the Pampean mud, which is found over the\r\n eastern part of B. Oriental, lies _over_ the limestone at P. Gorda; I\r\n should have said that there was reason to infer that it was a\r\n subsequent or superior deposit.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in a precipitous part of the ravine of Las Bocas, a red\r\nsandstone is distinctly seen to overlie a thick bed of pale mud, also\r\nquite like the Pampean formation, abounding with concretions of true\r\ntosca-rock. This sandstone extends over many miles of country: it is as\r\nred as the brightest volcanic scoriæ; it sometimes passes into a coarse\r\nred conglomerate composed of the underlying primary rocks; and often\r\npasses into a soft white sandstone with red streaks. At the Calera de\r\nlos Huerfanos, only a quarter of a mile south of where I first met with\r\nthe red sandstone, the crystalline white limestone is quarried: as this\r\nbed is the uppermost, and as it often passes into calcareous sandstone,\r\ninterstratified with pure sand; and as the red sandstone likewise\r\npasses into soft white sandstone, and is also the uppermost bed, I\r\nbelieve that these two beds, though so different, are equivalents. A\r\nfew leagues southward of these two places, on each side of the low\r\nprimary range of S. Juan, there are some flat-topped, cliff-bounded,\r\nseparate little hills,\r\nvery similar to those fringing the primary ranges in the great plain\r\nsouth of Buenos Ayres: they are composed—1st, of calcareous tuff with\r\nmany particles of quartz, sometimes passing into a coarse conglomerate;\r\n2nd, of a stone undistinguishable on the closest inspection from the\r\ncompacter varieties of tosca-rock; and 3rd, of semi-crystalline\r\nlimestone, including nodules of agate: these three varieties pass\r\ninsensibly into each other, and as they form the uppermost stratum in\r\nthis district, I believe that they, also, are the equivalents of the\r\npure crystalline limestone, and of the red and white sandstones and\r\nconglomerates.\r\n\r\nBetween these points and Mercedes on the Rio Negro, there are scarcely\r\nany good sections, the road passing over limestone, tosca-rock,\r\ncalcareous and bright red sandstones, and near the source of the San\r\nSalvador over a wide extent of jaspery rocks, with much milky agate,\r\nlike that in the limestone near San Juan. In the estancia of Berquelo,\r\nthe separate, flat-topped, cliff-bounded hills are rather higher than\r\nin the other parts of the country; they range in a N.E. and S.W.\r\ndirection; their uppermost beds consist of the same bright red\r\nsandstone, passing sometimes into a conglomerate, and in the lower part\r\ninto soft white sandstone, and even into loose sand: beneath this\r\nsandstone, I saw in two places layers of calcareous and marly rocks,\r\nand in one place red Pampean-like earth; at the base of these sections,\r\nthere was a hard, stratified, white sandstone, with chalcedonic layers.\r\nNear Mercedes, beds of the same nature and apparently of the same age,\r\nare associated with compact, white, crystalline limestone, including\r\nmuch botryoidal agate, and singular masses, like porcelain, but really\r\ncomposed of a calcareo-siliceous paste. In sinking wells in this\r\ndistrict the chalcedonic strata seem to be the lowest. Beds, such as\r\nthere described, occur over the whole of this neighbourhood; but twenty\r\nmiles further up the R. Negro, in the cliffs of Perika, which are about\r\nfifty feet in height, the upper bed is a prettily variegated\r\nchalcedony, mingled with a pure white tallowy limestone; beneath this\r\nthere is a conglomerate of quartz and granite; beneath this many\r\nsandstones, some highly calcareous; and the whole lower two-thirds of\r\nthe cliff consists of earthy calcareous beds of various degrees of\r\npurity, with one layer of reddish Pampean-like mud.\r\n\r\nWhen examining the agates, the chalcedonic and jaspery rocks, some of\r\nthe limestones, and even the bright red sandstones, I was forcibly\r\nstruck with their resemblance to deposits formed in the neighbourhood\r\nof volcanic action. I now find that M. Isabelle, in his “Voyage a\r\nBuenos Ayres,” has described closely similar beds on Itaquy and Ibicuy\r\n(which enter the Uruguay some way north of the R. Negro) and these beds\r\ninclude fragments of red decomposed true scoriæ hardened by zeolite,\r\nand of black retinite: we have then here good evidence of volcanic\r\naction during our tertiary period. Still further north, near S.\r\nAnna,[19] where the Parana makes a remarkable bend, M. Bonpland found\r\nsome singular amygdaloidal rocks, which perhaps may belong to this same\r\nepoch. I may remark that, judging from the size and well-rounded\r\ncondition of the blocks of rock in the above-described conglomerates,\r\nmasses of primary formation probably existed at this tertiary period\r\nabove water: there is, also, according to M. Isabelle, much\r\nconglomerate further north, at Salto.\r\n\r\n [19] M. d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part. Géolog., p. 29.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever source and through whatever means the great Pampean\r\nformation originated, we here have, I must repeat, unequivocal evidence\r\nof a similar action at a period before that of the deposition of the\r\nmarine tertiary strata with extinct shells, at Santa Fé and P. Gorda.\r\nDuring also the deposition of these strata, we have in the intercalated\r\nlayers of red Pampean-like mud and tosca-rock, and in the passage near\r\nS. Juan of the semi-crystalline limestones with agate into tosca\r\nundistinguishable from that of the Pampas, evidence of the same action,\r\nthough continued only at intervals and in a feeble manner. We have\r\nfurther seen that in this district, at a period not only subsequent to\r\nthe deposition of the tertiary strata, but to their upheavement and\r\nmost extensive denudation, true Pampean mud with its usual characters\r\nand including mammiferous remains, was deposited round and between the\r\nhills or islets formed of these tertiary strata, and over the whole\r\neastern and low primary districts of Banda Oriental.\r\n\r\nNo. 16\r\nSection of the lowest plain at Port S. Julian.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the lowest plain at Port S. Julian.]\r\n\r\n_Earthy mass, with extinct mammiferous remains, over the porphyritic\r\ngravel at S. Julian, lat. 49° 14′ S., in Patagonia._—This case, though\r\nnot coming strictly under the Pampean formation, may be conveniently\r\ngiven here. On the south side of the harbour, there is a nearly level\r\nplain (mentioned in the First Chapter) about seven miles long, and\r\nthree or four miles wide, estimated at ninety feet in height, and\r\nbordered by perpendicular cliffs, of which a section is represented\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe lower old tertiary strata (to be described in the next chapter) are\r\ncovered by the usual gravel bed; and this by an irregular earthy,\r\nsometimes sandy mass, seldom more than two or three feet in thickness,\r\nexcept where it fills up furrows or gullies worn not only through the\r\nunderlying gravel, but even through the upper tertiary beds. This\r\nearthy mass is of a pale reddish colour, like the less pure varieties\r\nof Pampean mud in Banda Oriental; it includes small calcareous\r\nconcretions, like those of tosca-rock but more arenaceous, and other\r\nconcretions of a greenish, indurated argillaceous substance: a few\r\npebbles, also, from the underlying gravel-bed are also included in it,\r\nand these being occasionally arranged in horizontal lines, show that\r\nthe mass is of sub-aqueous origin. On the surface and embedded in the\r\nsuperficial parts, there are numerous shells, partially retaining their\r\ncolours, of three or four of the now commonest littoral species. Near\r\nthe bottom of one deep furrow (represented in figure No. 16), filled up\r\nwith this earthy deposit, I found a large part of the skeleton of the\r\n_Macrauchenia Patachonica_—a gigantic and most extraordinary pachyderm,\r\nallied, according to Professor Owen, to the Palæotherium, but with\r\naffinities to the Ruminants, especially to the American division of the\r\nCamelidæ. Several of the vertebræ in a chain, and nearly all the bones\r\nof one of the limbs, even to the smallest bones of the foot, were\r\nembedded in their proper relative positions: hence the skeleton was\r\ncertainly united by its flesh or ligaments, when enveloped in the mud.\r\nThis earthy mass, with its concretions and mammiferous remains, filling\r\nup furrows in the underlying gravel, certainly presents a very striking\r\nresemblance to some of the sections (for instance, at P. Alta in B.\r\nBlanca, or at the Barrancas de S. Gregorio) in the Pampean formation;\r\nbut I must believe that this resemblance is only accidental. I suspect\r\nthat the mud which at the present day is accumulating in deep and\r\nnarrow gullies at the head of the harbour, would, after elevation,\r\npresent a very similar appearance. The southernmost part of the true\r\nPampean formation, namely, on the Colorado, lies 560 miles of latitude\r\nnorth of this point.[20]\r\n\r\n [20] In the succeeding chapter I shall have to refer to a great\r\n deposit of extinct mammiferous remains, lately discovered by Captain\r\n Sulivan, R.N., at a point still further south, namely, at the R.\r\n Gallegos; their age must at present remain doubtful.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the age of the Macrauchenia, the shells on the surface\r\nprove that the mass in which the skeleton was enveloped has been\r\nelevated above the sea within the recent period: I did not see any of\r\nthe shells embedded at a sufficient depth to assure me (though it be\r\nhighly probable) that the whole thickness of the mass was\r\ncontemporaneous with these _individual specimens._ That the\r\nMacrauchenia lived subsequently to the spreading out of the gravel on\r\nthis plain is certain; and that this gravel, at the height of ninety\r\nfeet, was spread out long after the existence of recent shells, is\r\nscarcely less certain. For, it was shown in the First Chapter, that\r\nthis line of coast has been upheaved with remarkable equability, and\r\nthat over a vast space both north and south of S. Julian, recent\r\nspecies of shells are strewed on (or embedded in) the surface of the\r\n250 feet plain, and of the 350 feet plain up to a height of 400 feet.\r\nThese wide step-formed plains have been formed by the denuding action\r\nof the coast-waves on the old tertiary strata; and therefore, when the\r\nsurface of the 350 feet plain, with the shells on it, first rose above\r\nthe level of the sea, the 250 feet plain did not exist, and its\r\nformation, as well as the spreading out of the gravel on its summit,\r\nmust have taken place subsequently. So also the denudation and the\r\ngravel-covering of the 90 feet plain must have taken\r\nplace subsequently to the elevation of the 250 feet plain, on which\r\nrecent shells are also strewed. Hence there cannot be any doubt that\r\nthe Macrauchenia, which certainly was entombed in a fresh state, and\r\nwhich must have been alive after the spreading out of the gravel on the\r\n90 feet plain, existed, not only subsequently to the upraised shells on\r\nthe surface of the 250 feet plain, but also to those on the 350 to 400\r\nfeet plain: these shells, eight in number (namely, three species of\r\nMytilus, two of Patella, one Fusus, Voluta, and Balanus), are\r\nundoubtedly recent species, and are the commonest kinds now living on\r\nthis coast. At Punta Alta in B. Blanca, I remarked how marvellous it\r\nwas, that the Toxodon, a mammifer so unlike to all known genera, should\r\nhave co-existed with twenty-three still living marine animals; and now\r\nwe find that the Macrauchenia, a quadruped only a little less anomalous\r\nthan the Toxodon, also co-existed with eight other still existing\r\nMollusca: it should, moreover, be borne in mind, that a tooth of a\r\npachydermatous animal was found with the other remains at Punta Alta,\r\nwhich Professor Owen thinks almost certainly belonged to the\r\nMacrauchenia.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell[21] has arrived at a highly important conclusion with respect\r\nto the age of the North American extinct mammifers (many of which are\r\nclosely allied to, and even identical with, those of the Pampean\r\nformation), namely, that they lived subsequently to the period when\r\nerratic boulders were transported by the agency of floating ice in\r\ntemperate latitudes. Now in the valley of the Santa Cruz, only fifty\r\nmiles of latitude south of the spot where the Macrauchenia was\r\nentombed, vast numbers of gigantic, angular boulders, which must have\r\nbeen transported from the Cordillera on icebergs, lie strewed on the\r\nplain, at the height of 1,400 feet above the level of the sea. In\r\nascending to this level, several step-formed plains must be crossed,\r\nall of which have necessarily required long time for their formation;\r\nhence the lowest or ninety feet plain, with its superficial bed\r\ncontaining the remains of the Macrauchenia, must have been formed very\r\nlong subsequently to the period when the 1,400 feet plain was beneath\r\nthe sea, and boulders were dropped on it from floating masses of\r\nice.[22] Mr. Lyell’s conclusion, therefore, is thus far confirmed in\r\nthe southern hemisphere; and it is the more important, as one is\r\nnaturally tempted to admit so simple an explanation, that it was the\r\nice-period that caused the extinction of the numerous great mammifers\r\nwhich so lately swarmed over the two Americas.\r\n\r\n [21] “Geological Proceedings,” vol. iv, p. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] It must not be inferred from these remarks, that the ice-action\r\n ceased in South America at this comparatively ancient period; for in\r\n Tierra del Fuego boulders were probably transported contemporaneously\r\n with, if not subsequently to, the formation of the ninety feet plain\r\n at S. Julian, and at other parts of the coast of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n_Summary and concluding remarks on the Pampean formation._—One of its\r\nmost striking features is its great extent; I passed continuously over\r\nit from the Colorado to St. Fe Bajada, a distance of 500 geographical\r\nmiles; and M. d’Orbigny traced it for 250 miles further north. In\r\nthe latitude of the Plata, I examined this formation at intervals over\r\nan east and west line of 300 miles from Maldonado to the R. Carcarana;\r\nand M. d’Orbigny believes it extends 100 miles further inland: from Mr.\r\nCaldcleugh’s travels, however, I should have thought that it had\r\nextended, south of the Cordovese range, to near Mendoza, and I may add\r\nthat I heard of great bones having been found high up the R. Quinto.\r\nHence the area of the Pampean formation, as remarked by M. d’Orbigny,\r\nis probably at least equal to that of France, and perhaps twice or\r\nthrice as great. In a basin, surrounded by gravel-cliff (at a height of\r\nnearly three thousand feet), south of Mendoza, there is, as described\r\nin the Third Chapter, a deposit very like the Pampean, interstratified\r\nwith other matter; and again at S. Julian’s, in Patagonia, 560 miles\r\nsouth of the Colorado, a small irregular bed of a nearly similar nature\r\ncontains, as we have just seen, mammiferous remains. In the provinces\r\nof Moxos and Chiquitos (1,000 miles northward of the Pampas), and in\r\nBolivia, at a height of 4,000 metres, M. d’Orbigny has described\r\nsimilar deposits, which he believes to have been formed by the same\r\nagency contemporaneously with the Pampean formation. Considering the\r\nimmense distances between these several points, and their different\r\nheights, it appears to me infinitely more probable, that this\r\nsimilarity has resulted not from contemporaneousness of origin, but\r\nfrom the similarity of the rocky framework of the continent: it is\r\nknown that in Brazil an immense area consists of gneissic rocks, and we\r\nshall hereafter see, over how great a length the plutonic rocks of the\r\nCordillera, the overlying purple porphyries, and the trachytic\r\nejections, are almost identical in nature.\r\n\r\nThree theories on the origin of the Pampean formation have been\r\npropounded:—First, that of a great debacle by M. d’Orbigny; this seems\r\nfounded chiefly on the absence of stratification, and on the number of\r\nembedded remains of terrestrial quadrupeds. Although the Pampean\r\nformation (like so many argillaceous deposits) is not divided into\r\ndistinct and separate strata, yet we have seen that in one good section\r\nit was striped with horizontal zones of colour, and that in several\r\nspecified places the upper and lower parts differed, not only\r\nconsiderably in colour, but greatly in constitution. In the southern\r\npart of the Pampas the upper mass (to a certain extent stratified)\r\ngenerally consists of hard tosca-rock, and the lower part of red\r\nPampean mud, often itself divided into two or more masses, varying in\r\ncolour and in the quantity of included calcareous matter. In Western\r\nBanda Oriental, beds of a similar nature, but of a greater age,\r\nconformably underlie and are intercalated with the regularly stratified\r\ntertiary formation. As a general rule, the marly concretions are\r\narranged in horizontal lines, sometimes united into irregular strata:\r\nsurely, if the mud had been tumultuously deposited in mass, the\r\nincluded calcareous matter would have segregated itself irregularly,\r\nand not into nodules arranged in horizontal lines, one above the other\r\nand often far apart: this arrangement appears to me to prove that mud,\r\ndiffering slightly in composition, was successively and quietly\r\ndeposited. On the theory of a debacle, a prodigious amount of mud,\r\nwithout a single pebble, is supposed to have been borne over the wide\r\nsurface of the Pampas, when under water: on the other hand, over the\r\nwhole of Patagonia, the same or another debacle is supposed to have\r\nborne nothing but gravel,—the gravel and the fine mud in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Rios Negro and Colorado having been borne to an\r\nequal distance from the Cordillera, or imagined line of disturbance:\r\nassuredly directly opposite effects ought not to be attributed to the\r\nsame agency. Where, again, could a mass of fine sediment, charged with\r\ncalcareous matter in a fit state for chemical segregation, and in\r\nquantity sufficient to cover an area at least 750 miles long, and 400\r\nmiles broad, to a depth of from twenty to thirty feet to a hundred\r\nfeet, have been accumulated, ready to be transported by the supposed\r\ndebacle? To my mind it is little short of demonstration, that a great\r\nlapse of time was necessary for the production and deposition of the\r\nenormous amount of mudlike matter forming the Pampas; nor should I have\r\nnoticed the theory of a debacle, had it not been adduced by a\r\nnaturalist so eminent as M. d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\nA second theory, first suggested, I believe, by Sir W. Parish, is that\r\nthe Pampean formation was thrown down on low and marshy plains by the\r\nrivers of this country before they assumed their present courses. The\r\nappearance and composition of the deposit, the manner in which it\r\nslopes up and round the primary ranges, the nature of the underlying\r\nmarine beds, the estuary and sea-shells on the surface, the overlying\r\nsandstone beds at M. Hermoso, are all quite opposed to this view. Nor\r\ndo I believe that there is a single instance of a skeleton of one of\r\nthe extinct mammifers having been found in an upright position, as if\r\nit had been mired.\r\n\r\nThe third theory, of the truth of which I cannot entertain the smallest\r\ndoubt, is that the Pampean formation was slowly accumulated at the\r\nmouth of the former estuary of the Plata and in the sea adjoining it. I\r\nhave come to this conclusion from the reasons assigned against the two\r\nforegoing theories, and from simple geographical considerations. From\r\nthe numerous shells of the _Azara labiata_ lying loose on the surface\r\nof the plains, and near Buenos Ayres embedded in the tosca-rock, we\r\nknow that this formation not only was formerly covered by, but that the\r\nuppermost parts were deposited in, the brackish water of the ancient La\r\nPlata. Southward and seaward of Buenos Ayres, the plains were upheaved\r\nfrom under water inhabited by true marine shells. We further know from\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg’s examination of the twenty microscopical organisms\r\nin the mud round the tooth of the Mastodon high up the course of the\r\nParana, that the bottom-most part of this formation was of\r\nbrackish-water origin. A similar conclusion must be extended to the\r\nbeds of like composition, at the level of the sea and under it, at M.\r\nHermoso in Bahia Blanca. Dr. Carpenter finds that the harder varieties\r\nof tosca-rock, collected chiefly to the south, contain marine spongoid\r\nbodies, minute fragments of shells, corals, and Polythalamia; these\r\nperhaps may have been drifted inwards by the tides, from the more open\r\nparts of the sea. The absence of shells, throughout this deposit, with\r\nthe exception of the uppermost layers near Buenos Ayres, is a\r\nremarkable fact: can it be explained by the brackish condition of the\r\nwater, or by the deep mud at the bottom? I have stated that both the\r\nreddish mud and the concretions of tosca-rock are\r\noften penetrated by minute, linear cavities, such as frequently may be\r\nobserved in fresh-water calcareous deposits:—were they produced by the\r\nburrowing of small worms? Only on this view of the Pampean formation\r\nhaving been of estuary origin, can the extraordinary numbers (presently\r\nto be alluded to) of the embedded mammiferous remains be explained.[23]\r\n\r\n [23] It is almost superfluous to give the numerous cases (for\r\n instance, in Sumatra; Lyell’s “Principles,” vol. iii, p. 325, sixth\r\n edit.), of the carcasses of animals having been washed out to sea by\r\n swollen rivers; but I may refer to a recent account by Mr. Bettington\r\n (“Asiatic Soc.,” 1845, June 21st), of oxen, deer, and bears being\r\n carried into the Gulf of Cambray; see also the account in my “Journal”\r\n (2nd edit., p. 133), of the numbers of animals drowned in the Plata\r\n during the great, often recurrent, droughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first origin of the reddish mud, I will only\r\nremark, that the enormous area of Brazil consists in chief part of\r\ngneissic and other granitic rocks, which have suffered decomposition,\r\nand been converted into a red, gritty, argillaceous mass, to a greater\r\ndepth than in any other country which I have seen. The mixture of\r\nrounded grains, and even of small fragments and pebbles of quartz, in\r\nthe Pampean mud of Banda Oriental, is evidently due to the neighbouring\r\nand underlying primary rocks. The estuary mud was drifted during the\r\nPampean period in a much more southerly course, owing probably to the\r\neast and west primary ridges south of the Plata not having been then\r\nelevated, than the mud of the Plata at present is; for it was formerly\r\ndeposited as far south as the Colorado. The quantity of calcareous\r\nmatter in this formation, especially in those large districts where the\r\nwhole mass passes into tosca-rock, is very great: I have already\r\nremarked on the close resemblance in external and microscopical\r\nappearance, between this tosca-rock and the strata at Coquimbo, which\r\nhave certainly resulted from the decay and attrition of recent\r\nshells:[24] I dare not, however, extend this conclusion to the\r\ncalcareous rocks of the Pampas, more especially as the underlying\r\ntertiary strata in western Banda Oriental show that at that period\r\nthere was a copious emission of carbonate of lime, in connection with\r\nvolcanic action.\r\n\r\n [24] I may add, that there are nearly similar superficial calcareous\r\n beds at King George’s Sound in Australia; and these undoubtedly have\r\n been formed by the disintegration of marine remains (see “Volcanic\r\n Islands,” etc., p. 144). There is, however, something very remarkable\r\n in the frequency of superficial, thin beds of earthy calcareous\r\n matter, in districts where the surrounding rocks are not calcareous.\r\n Major Charters, in a Paper read before the Geographical Society (April\r\n 13th, 1840, and abstracted in the _ Athenæum_, p. 317), states that\r\n this is the case in parts of Mexico, and that he has observed similar\r\n appearances in many parts of South Africa. The circumstance of the\r\n uppermost stratum round the ragged Sierra Ventana, consisting of\r\n calcareous or marly matter, without any covering of alluvial matter,\r\n strikes me as very singular, in whatever manner we view the deposition\r\n and elevation of the Pampean formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pampean formation, judging from its similar composition, and from\r\nthe apparent absolute specific identity of some of its mammiferous\r\nremains, and from the generic resemblance of others, belongs over its\r\nvast area—throughout Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and the wide extent of\r\nthe Pampas as far south as the Colorado,—to the same geological epoch.\r\nThe mammiferous remains occur at all depths from the top to the bottom\r\nof the deposit; and I may add that nowhere in the Pampas is there any\r\nappearance of much superficial denudation: some bones which I found\r\nnear the Guardia del Monte were embedded close to the surface; and this\r\nappears to have been the case with many of those discovered in Banda\r\nOriental: on the Matanzas, twenty miles south of Buenos Ayres, a\r\nGlyptodon was embedded five feet beneath the surface; numerous remains\r\nwere found by S. Muniz, near Luxan, at an average depth of eighteen\r\nfeet; in Buenos Ayres a skeleton was disinterred at sixty feet depth,\r\nand on the Parana I have described two skeletons of the Mastodon only\r\nfive or six feet above the very base of the deposit. With respect to\r\nthe age of this formation, as judged of by the ordinary standard of the\r\nexistence of Mollusca, the only evidence within the limits of the true\r\nPampas which is at all trustworthy, is afforded by the still living\r\n_Azara labiata_ being embedded in tosca-rock near Buenos Ayres. At\r\nPunta Alta, however, we have seen that several of the extinct\r\nmammifers, most characteristic of the Pampean formation, co-existed\r\nwith twenty species of Mollusca, a barnacle and two corals, all still\r\nliving on this same coast;—for when we remember that the shells have a\r\nmore ancient appearance than the bones; that many of the bones, though\r\nembedded in a coarse conglomerate, are perfectly preserved; that almost\r\nall the parts of the skeleton of the Scelidotherium, even to the\r\nknee-cap, were lying in their proper relative positions; and that a\r\nlarge piece of the fragile dermal armour of a Dasypoid quadruped,\r\nconnected with some of the bones of the foot, had been entombed in a\r\ncondition allowing the two sides to be doubled together, it must\r\nassuredly be admitted that these mammiferous remains were embedded in a\r\nfresh state, and therefore that the living animals co-existed with the\r\nco-embedded shells. Moreover, the _Macrauchenia Patachonica_ (of which,\r\naccording to Professor Owen, remains also occur in the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres, and at Punta Alta) has been shown by satisfactory evidence of\r\nanother kind, to have lived on the plains of Patagonia long after the\r\nperiod when the adjoining sea was first tenanted by its present\r\ncommonest molluscous animals. We must, therefore, conclude that the\r\nPampean formation belongs, in the ordinary geological sense of the\r\nword, to the Recent Period.[25]\r\n\r\n [25] M. d’Orbigny believes (“Voyage,” Part. Géolog., p. 81) that this\r\n formation, though “très voisine de la nôtre, est néanmoins de beaucoup\r\n antérieure à notre création.”\r\n\r\nAt St. Fé Bajada, the Pampean estuary formation, with its mammiferous\r\nremains, conformably overlies the marine tertiary strata, which (as\r\nfirst shown by M. d’Orbigny) are contemporaneous with those of\r\nPatagonia, and which, as we shall hereafter see, belong to a very\r\nancient tertiary stage. When examining the junction between these two\r\nformations, I thought that the concretionary layer of marl marked a\r\npassage between the marine and estuary stages. M. d’Orbigny\r\ndisputes this view (as given in my “Journal”), and I admit that it is\r\nerroneous, though in some degree excusable, from their conformability\r\nand from both abounding with calcareous matter. It would, indeed, have\r\nbeen a great anomaly if there had been a true passage between a deposit\r\ncontemporaneous with existing species of mollusca, and one in which all\r\nthe mollusca appear to be extinct. Northward of Santa Fe, M. d’Orbigny\r\nmet with ferruginous sandstones, marly rocks, and other beds, which he\r\nconsiders as a distinct and lower formation; but the evidence that they\r\nare not parts of the same with an altered mineralogical character, does\r\nnot appear to me quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn Western Banda Oriental, while the marine tertiary strata were\r\naccumulating, there were volcanic eruptions, much silex and lime were\r\nprecipitated from solution, coarse conglomerates were formed, being\r\nderived probably from adjoining land, and layers of red mud and marly\r\nrocks, like those of the Pampean formation, were occasionally\r\ndeposited. The true Pampean deposit, with mammiferous remains, instead\r\nof as at Santa Fe overlying conformably the tertiary strata, is here\r\nseen at a lower level folding round and between the flat-topped,\r\ncliff-bounded hills, formed by a upheaval and denudation of these same\r\ntertiary strata. The upheaval, having occurred here earlier than at\r\nSanta Fe, may be naturally accounted for by the contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic action. At the Barrancas de S. Gregorio, the Pampean deposit,\r\nas we have seen, overlies and fills up furrows in coarse sand,\r\nprecisely like that now accumulating on the shores near the mouth of\r\nthe Plata. I can hardly believe that this loose and coarse sand is\r\ncontemporaneous with the old tertiary and often crystalline strata of\r\nthe more western parts of the province; and am induced to suspect that\r\nit is of subsequent origin. If that section near Colonia could be\r\nimplicitly trusted, in which, at a height of only fifteen feet above\r\nthe Plata, a bed of fresh-looking mussels, of an existing _littoral_\r\nspecies, appeared to lie between the sand and the Pampean mud, I should\r\nconclude that Banda Oriental must have stood, when the coarse sand was\r\naccumulating, at only a little below its present level, and had then\r\nsubsided, allowing the estuary Pampean mud to cover far and wide its\r\nsurface up to a height of some hundred feet; and that after this\r\nsubsidence the province had been uplifted to its present level.\r\n\r\nIn Western Banda Oriental, we know, from two unequivocal sections that\r\nthere is a mass, absolutely undistinguishable from the true Pampean\r\ndeposit, beneath the old tertiary strata. This inferior mass must be\r\nvery much more ancient than the upper deposit with its mammiferous\r\nremains, for it lies beneath the tertiary strata in which all the\r\nshells are extinct. Nevertheless, the lower and upper masses, as well\r\nas some intermediate layers, are so similar in mineralogical character,\r\nthat I cannot doubt that they are all of estuary origin, and have been\r\nderived from the same great source. At first it appeared to me\r\nextremely improbable, that mud of the same nature should have been\r\ndeposited on nearly the same spot, during an immense lapse of time,\r\nnamely, from a period equivalent perhaps to the Eocene of Europe to\r\nthat of the Pampean formation. But as, at the very commencement of the\r\nPampean\r\nperiod, if not at a still earlier period, the Sierra Ventana formed a\r\nboundary to the south,—the Cordillera or the plains in front of them to\r\nthe west,—the whole province of Corrientes probably to the north, for,\r\naccording to M. d’Orbigny, it is not covered by the Pampean\r\ndeposit,—and Brazil, as known by the remains in the caves, to the\r\nnorth-east; and as again, during the older tertiary period, land\r\nalready existed in Western Banda Oriental and near St. Fé Bajada, as\r\nmay be inferred from the vegetable debris, from the quantities of\r\nsilicified wood, and from the remains of a Toxodon found, according to\r\nM. d’Orbigny, in still lower strata, we may conclude, that at this\r\nancient period a great expanse of water was surrounded by the same\r\nrocky framework which now bounds the plains of Pampean formation. This\r\nhaving been the case, the circumstance of sediment of the same nature\r\nhaving been deposited in the same area during an immense lapse of time,\r\nthough highly remarkable, does not appear incredible.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the Pampas, at least of the southern parts, has been\r\nslow and interrupted by several periods of rest, as may be inferred\r\nfrom the plains, cliffs, and lines of sand-dunes (with shells and\r\npumice-pebbles) standing at different heights. I believe, also, that\r\nthe Pampean mud continued to be deposited, after parts of this\r\nformation had already been elevated, in the same manner as mud would\r\ncontinue to be deposited in the estuary of the Plata, if the mud-banks\r\non its shores were now uplifted and changed into plains: I believe in\r\nthis from the improbability of so many skeletons and bones having been\r\naccumulated at one spot, where M. Hermoso now stands, at a depth of\r\nbetween eight hundred and one thousand feet, and at a vast distance\r\nfrom any land except small rocky islets,—as must have been the case, if\r\nthe high tosca-plain round the Ventana and adjoining Sierras, had not\r\nbeen already uplifted and converted into land, supporting mammiferous\r\nanimals. At Punta Alta we have good evidence that the gravel-strata,\r\nwhich certainly belong to the true Pampean period, were accumulated\r\nafter the elevation in that neighbourhood of the main part of the\r\nPampean deposit, whence the rounded masses of tosca-rock were derived,\r\nand that rolled fragment of black bone in the same peculiar condition\r\nwith the remains at Monte Hermoso.\r\n\r\nThe number of the mammiferous remains embedded in the Pampas is, as I\r\nhave remarked, wonderful: it should be borne in mind that they have\r\nalmost exclusively been found in the cliffs and steep banks of rivers,\r\nand that, until lately, they excited no attention amongst the\r\ninhabitants: I am firmly convinced that a deep trench could not be cut\r\nin any line across the Pampas, without intersecting the remains of some\r\nquadruped. It is difficult to form an opinion in what part of the\r\nPampas they are most numerous; in a limited spot they could not well\r\nhave been more numerous than they were at P. Alta; the number, however,\r\nlately found by Senor F. Muniz, near Luxan, in a central spot in the\r\nPampas, is extraordinarily great: at the end of this chapter I will\r\ngive a list of all the localities at which I have heard of remains\r\nhaving been discovered. Very frequently the remains consist of almost\r\nperfect\r\nskeletons; but there are, also, numerous single bones, as for instance\r\nat St. Fé. Their state of preservation varies much, even when embedded\r\nnear each other: I saw none others so perfectly preserved as the heads\r\nof the Toxodon and Mylodon from the white soft earthy bed on the\r\nSarandis in Banda Oriental. It is remarkable that in two limited\r\nsections I found no less than five teeth separately embedded, and I\r\nheard of teeth having been similarly found in other parts: may we\r\nsuppose that the skeletons or heads were for a long time gently drifted\r\nby currents over the soft muddy bottom, and that the teeth\r\noccasionally, here and there, dropped out?\r\n\r\nIt may be naturally asked, where did these numerous animals live? From\r\nthe remarkable discoveries of MM. Lund and Clausen, it appears that\r\nsome of the species found in the Pampas inhabited the highlands of\r\nBrazil: the _Mastodon Andium_ is embedded at great heights in the\r\nCordillera from north of the equator[26] to at least as far south as\r\nTarija; and as there is no higher land, there can be little doubt that\r\nthis Mastodon must have lived on the plains and valleys of that great\r\nrange. These countries, however, appear too far distant for the\r\nhabitation of the individuals entombed in the Pampas: we must probably\r\nlook to nearer points, for instance to the province of Corrientes,\r\nwhich, as already remarked, is said not to be covered by the Pampean\r\nformation, and may therefore, at the period of its deposition, have\r\nexisted as dry land. I have already given my reasons for believing that\r\nthe animals embedded at M. Hermoso and at P. Alta in Bahia Blanca,\r\nlived on adjoining land, formed of parts of the already elevated\r\nPampean deposit. With respect to the food of these many great extinct\r\nquadrupeds, I will not repeat the facts given in my “Journal” (second\r\nedit., p. 85), showing that there is no correlation between the\r\nluxuriance of the vegetation of a country and the size of its\r\nmammiferous inhabitants. I do not doubt that large animals could now\r\nexist, as far as the amount, not kind, of vegetation is concerned, on\r\nthe sterile plains of Bahia Blanca and of the R. Negro, as well as on\r\nthe equally, if not more sterile plains of Southern Africa. The\r\nclimate, however, may perhaps have somewhat deteriorated since the\r\nmammifers embedded at Bahia Blanca lived there; for we must not infer,\r\nfrom the continued existence of the same shells on the present coasts,\r\nthat there has been no change in climate; for several of these shells\r\nnow range northward along the shores of Brazil, where the most\r\nluxuriant vegetation flourishes under a tropical temperature. With\r\nrespect to the extinction, which at first fills the mind with\r\nastonishment, of the many great and small mammifers of this period, I\r\nmay also refer to the work above cited (second edit., p. 173), in which\r\nI have endeavoured to show, that however unable we may be to explain\r\nthe precise cause, we ought not properly to feel more surprised at a\r\nspecies becoming extinct than at one being rare; and yet we are\r\naccustomed to\r\nview the rarity of any particular species as an ordinary event, not\r\nrequiring any extraordinary agency.\r\n\r\n [26] Humboldt states that the Mastodon has been discovered in New\r\n Granada: it has been found in Quito. When at Lima, I saw a tooth of a\r\n Mastodon in the possession of Don M. Rivero, found at Playa Chica on\r\n the Maranon, near the Guallaga. Every one has heard of the numerous\r\n remains of Mastodon in Bolivia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe several mammifers embedded in the Pampean formation, which mostly\r\nbelong to extinct genera, and some even to extinct families or orders,\r\nand which differ nearly, if not quite, as much as do the Eocene\r\nmammifers of Europe from living quadrupeds having existed\r\ncontemporaneously with mollusca, all still inhabiting the adjoining\r\nsea, is certainly a most striking fact. It is, however, far from being\r\nan isolated one; for, during the late tertiary deposits of Britain, an\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus co-existed with many recent land\r\nand fresh-water shells; and in North America, we have the best evidence\r\nthat a mastodon, elephant, megatherium, megalonyx, mylodon, an extinct\r\nhorse and ox, likewise co-existed with numerous land, fresh-water, and\r\nmarine recent shells.[27] The enumeration of these extinct North\r\nAmerican animals naturally leads me to refer to the former closer\r\nrelation of the mammiferous inhabitants of the two Americas, which I\r\nhave discussed in my “Journal,” and likewise to the vast extent of\r\ncountry over which some of them ranged: thus the same species of the\r\n_Megatherium, Megalonyx, Equus_ (as far as the state of their remains\r\npermits of identification), extended from the Southern United States of\r\nNorth America to Bahia Blanca, in lat. 39° S., on the coast of\r\nPatagonia. The fact of these animals having inhabited tropical and\r\ntemperate regions, does not appear to me any great difficulty, seeing\r\nthat at the Cape of Good Hope several quadrupeds, such as the elephant\r\nand hippopotamus, range from the equator to lat. 35° south. The case of\r\nthe Mastodon Andium is one of more difficulty, for it is found from\r\nlat. 36° S., over, as I have reason to believe, nearly the whole of\r\nBrazil, and up the Cordillera to regions which, according to M.\r\nd’Orbigny, border on perpetual snow, and which are almost destitute of\r\nvegetation: undoubtedly the climate of the Cordillera must have been\r\ndifferent when the mastodon inhabited it; but we should not forget the\r\ncase of the Siberian mammoth and rhinoceros, as showing how severe a\r\nclimate the larger pachydermata can endure; nor overlook the fact of\r\nthe guanaco ranging at the present day over the hot low deserts of\r\nPeru, the lofty pinnacles of the Cordillera, and the damp forest-clad\r\nland of Southern Tierra del Fuego; the puma, also, is found from the\r\nequator to the Strait of Magellan, and I have seen its footsteps only a\r\nlittle below the limits of perpetual snow in the Cordillera of Chile.\r\n\r\n [27] Many original observations, and a summary on this subject, are\r\n given in Mr. Lyell’s paper in the “Geolog. Proc.,” vol. iv, p. 3 and\r\n in his “Travels in North America,” vol. i, p. 164 and vol. ii, p. 60.\r\n For the European analogous cases see Mr. Lyell’s “Principles of\r\n Geology” (6th edit.), vol. i, p. 37.\r\n\r\nAt the period, so recent in a geological sense, when these extinct\r\nmammifers existed, the two Americas must have swarmed with quadrupeds,\r\nmany of them of gigantic size; for, besides those more particularly\r\nreferred to in this chapter, we must include in this same period those\r\nwonderfully numerous remains, some few of them specifically, and others\r\ngenerically related to those of the Pampas, discovered by\r\nMM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. Finally, the facts here\r\ngiven show how cautious we ought to be in judging of the antiquity of a\r\nformation from even a great amount of difference between the extinct\r\nand living species in any one class of animals;—we ought even to be\r\ncautious in accepting the general proposition, that change in organic\r\nforms and lapse of time are at all, necessarily, correlatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Localities within the region of the Pampas where great bones have been\r\nfound._\r\n\r\nThe following list, which includes every account which I have hitherto\r\nmet with of the discovery of fossil mammiferous remains in the Pampas,\r\nmay be hereafter useful to a geologist investigating this region, and\r\nit tends to show their extraordinary abundance. I heard of and saw many\r\nfossils, the original position of which I could not ascertain; and I\r\nreceived many statements too vague to be here inserted. Beginning to\r\nthe south:—we have the two stations in Bahia Blanca, described in this\r\nchapter, where at P. Alta, the Megatherium, Megalonyx, Scelidotherium,\r\nMylodon, Holophractus (or an allied genus), Toxodon, Macrauchenia, and\r\nan Equus were collected; and at M. Hermoso a Ctenomys, Hydrochærus,\r\nsome other rodents and the bones of a great megatheroid quadruped.\r\nClose north-east of the S. Tapalguen, we have the Rios ‘Huesos’ (i.e.\r\n_bones_), which probably takes its name from large fossil bones. Near\r\nVilla Nuevo, and at Las Averias, not far from the Salado, three nearly\r\nperfect skeletons, one of the Megatherium, one of the _Glyptodon\r\nclavipes_, and one of some great Dasypoid quadruped, were found by the\r\nagent of Sir W. Parish (see his work “Buenos Ayres,” etc., p. 171). I\r\nhave seen the tooth of a Mastodon from the Salado; a little northward\r\nof this river, on the borders of a lake near the G. del Monte, I saw\r\nmany bones, and one large piece of dermal armour; higher up the Salado,\r\nthere is a place called Monte “Huesos.” On the Matanzas, about twenty\r\nmiles south of Buenos Ayres, the skeleton (_vide_ p. 178 of “Buenos\r\nAyres,” etc., by Sir W. Parish) of a Glyptodon was found about five\r\nfeet beneath the surface; here also (see Catalogue of Royal College of\r\nSurgeons) remains of _Glyptodon clavipes, G. ornatus_, and _G.\r\nreticulatus_ were found. Signor Angelis, in a letter which I have seen,\r\nrefers to some great remains found in Buenos Ayres, at a depth of\r\ntwenty varas from the surface. Seven leagues north of this city the\r\nsame author found the skeletons of _Mylodon robustus_ and _Glyptodon\r\nornatus._ From this neighbourhood he has lately sent to the British\r\nMuseum the following fossils:—Remains of three or four individuals of\r\nMegatherium; of three species of Glyptodon; of three individuals of the\r\n_Mastodon Andium_; of Macrauchenia; of a second species of Toxodon,\r\ndifferent from _T. Platensis_; and lastly, of the Machairodus, a\r\nwonderful large carnivorous animal. M. d’Orbigny has lately received\r\nfrom the Recolate (“Voyage,” Pal., p. 144), near Buenos Ayres, a tooth\r\nof _Toxodon Platensis._\r\n\r\nProceeding northward, along the west bank of the Parana, we come to the\r\nRio Luxan, where two skeletons of the Megatherium have been found; and\r\nlately, within eight leagues of the town of Luxan, Dr. F. X. Muniz has\r\ncollected (_British Packet_, Buenos Ayres, September 25, 1841), from an\r\naverage depth of eighteen feet, very numerous remains, of no less than,\r\nas he believes, nine distinct species of mammifers. At Areco, large\r\nbones have been found, which are believed, by the inhabitants, to have\r\nbeen changed\r\nfrom small bones, by the water of the river! At Arrecifes, the\r\nGlyptodon, sent to the College of Surgeons, was found; and I have seen\r\ntwo teeth of a Mastodon from this quarter. At S. Nicolas, M. d’Orbigny\r\nfound remains of a Canis, Ctenomys, and Kerodon; and M. Isabelle\r\n(“Voyage,” p. 332) refers to a gigantic Armadillo found there. At S.\r\nCarlos, I heard of great bones. A little below the mouth of the\r\nCarcarana, the two skeletons of Mastodon were found; on the banks of\r\nthis river, near S. Miguel, I found teeth of the Mastodon and Toxodon;\r\nand “Falkner” (p. 55) describes the osseous armour of some great\r\nanimal; I heard of many other bones in this neighbourhood. I have seen,\r\nI may add, in the possession of Mr. Caldcleugh, the tooth of a\r\n_Mastodon Andium_, said to have been found in Paraguay; I may here also\r\nrefer to a statement in this gentleman’s travels (vol. i, p. 48), of a\r\ngreat skeleton having been found in the province of Bolivia in Brazil,\r\non the R. de las Contas. The furthest point westward in the Pampas, at\r\nwhich I have _heard_ of fossil bones, was high up on the banks of R.\r\nQuinto.\r\n\r\nIn Entre Rios, besides the remains of the Mastodon, Toxodon, Equus, and\r\na great Dasypoid quadruped near St. Fe Bajada, I received an account of\r\nbones having been found a little S.E. of P. Gorda (on the Parana), and\r\nof an entire skeleton at Matanzas, on the Arroyo del Animal.\r\n\r\nIn Banda Oriental, besides the remains of the Toxodon, Mylodon, and two\r\nskeletons of great animals with osseous armour (distinct from that of\r\nthe Glyptodon), found on the Arroyos Sarandis and Berquelo, M. Isabelle\r\n(“Voyage,” p. 322) says, many bones have been found near the R. Negro,\r\nand on the R. Arapey, an affluent of the Paraguay, in lat. 30° 40′\r\nsouth. I heard of bones near the source of the A. Vivoras. I saw the\r\nremains of a Dasypoid quadruped from the Arroyo Seco, close to M.\r\nVideo; and M. d’Orbigny refers (“Voyage,” Géolog., p. 24), to another\r\nfound on the Pedernal, an affluent of the St. Lucia; and Signor\r\nAngelis, in a letter, states that a third skeleton of this family has\r\nbeen found, near Canelones. I saw a tooth of the Mastodon from Talas,\r\nanother affluent of the St. Lucia. The most eastern point at which I\r\nheard of great bones having been found, was at Solis Grande, between M.\r\nVideo and Maldonado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V ON THE OLDER TERTIARY FORMATIONS OF PATAGONIA AND CHILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRio Negro.—S.

America.—On the\r\ncontemporaneous deposition and preservation of sedimentary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rio Negro._—I can add little to the details given by M. d’Orbigny[1]\r\non the sandstone formation of this district. The cliffs to the south of\r\nthe\r\nriver are about two hundred feet in height, and are composed of\r\nsandstone of various tints and degrees of hardness. One layer, which\r\nthinned out at both ends, consisted of earthy matter, of a pale reddish\r\ncolour, with some gypsum, and very like (I speak after comparison of\r\nthe specimens brought home) Pampean mud: above this was a layer of\r\ncompact marly rock with dendritic manganese. Many blocks of a\r\nconglomerate of pumice-pebbles embedded in hard sandstone were strewed\r\nat the foot of the cliff, and had evidently fallen from above. A few\r\nmiles N.E. of the town, I found, low down in the sandstone, a bed, a\r\nfew inches in thickness, of a white, friable, harsh-feeling sediment,\r\nwhich adheres to the tongue, is of easy fusibility, and of little\r\nspecific gravity; examined under the microscope, it is seen to be\r\npumiceous tuff, formed of broken transparent crystals. In the cliffs\r\nsouth of the river, there is, also, a thin layer of nearly similar\r\nnature, but finer grained, and not so white; it might easily have been\r\nmistaken for a calcareous tuff, but it contains no lime: this substance\r\nprecisely resembles a most widely extended and thick formation in\r\nSouthern Patagonia, hereafter to be described, and which is remarkable\r\nfor being partially formed of infusoria. These beds, conjointly with\r\nthe conglomerate of pumice, are interesting, as showing the nature of\r\nthe volcanic action in the Cordillera during this old tertiary period.\r\n\r\n [1] “Voyage,” Part. Géolog., pp. 57-65.\r\n\r\nIn a bed at the base of the southern cliffs, M. d’Orbigny found two\r\nextinct fresh-water shells, namely, a Unio and Chilina. This bed rested\r\non one with bones of an extinct rodent, namely, the _ Megamys\r\nPatagoniensis_; and this again on another with extinct marine shells.\r\nThe species found by M. d’Orbigny in different parts of this formation\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé, and whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia).\r\n\r\nOstrea Ferrarisi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.”\r\n\r\nOstrea Alvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé, and S.\r\nJosef).\r\n\r\nPecten Patagoniensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.”\r\n\r\nVenus Munsterii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé).\r\n\r\nArca Bonplandiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé).\r\n\r\nAccording to M. d’Orbigny, the sandstone extends westward along the\r\ncoast as far as Port S. Antonio, and up the R. Negro far into the\r\ninterior: northward I traced it to the southern side of the Rio\r\nColorado, where it forms a low denuded plain. This formation, though\r\ncontemporaneous with that of the rest of Patagonia, is quite different\r\nin mineralogical composition, being connected with it only by the one\r\nthin white layer: this difference may be reasonably attributed to the\r\nsediment brought down in ancient times by the Rio Negro; by which\r\nagency, also, we can understand the presence of the fresh-water shells,\r\nand of the bones of land animals. Judging from the identity of four of\r\nthe above shells, this formation is contemporaneous (as remarked by M.\r\nd’Orbigny) with that under the Pampean deposit in Entre Rios and in\r\nBanda Oriental. The gravel capping the sandstone plain, with its\r\ncalcareous cement and nodules of gypsum, is probably, from the reasons\r\ngiven in the First Chapter, contemporaneous with the uppermost beds of\r\nthe Pampean formation on the upper plain north of the Colorado.\r\n\r\n_San Josef._—My examination here was very short: the cliffs are about a\r\nhundred feet high; the lower third consists of yellowish-brown, soft,\r\nslightly calcareous, muddy sandstone, parts of which when struck emit a\r\nfetid smell. In this bed the great Ostræa Patagonica, often marked with\r\ndendritic manganese and small coral-lines, were extraordinarily\r\nnumerous. I found here the following shells:—\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé and whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia).\r\n\r\nOstrea Alvarezii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé and R.\r\nNegro).\r\n\r\nPecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé, S.\r\nJulian, and Port Desire).\r\n\r\nPecten Darwinianus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé).\r\n\r\nPecten actinodes, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTerebratula Patagonica, G. B. Sowerby (also S. Julian).\r\n\r\nCasts of a Turritella.\r\n\r\nThe four first of these species occur at St. Fé in Entre Rios, and the\r\ntwo first in the sandstone of the Rio Negro. Above this fossiliferous\r\nmass, there is a stratum of very fine-grained, pale brown mudstone,\r\nincluding numerous laminæ of selenite. All the strata appear\r\nhorizontal, but when followed by the eye for a long distance, they are\r\nseen to have a small easterly dip. On the surface we have the\r\nporphyritic gravel, and on it sand with recent shells.\r\n\r\n_Nuevo Gulf._—From specimens and notes given me by Lieutenant Stokes,\r\nit appears that the lower bed consists of soft muddy sandstone, like\r\nthat of S. Josef, with many imperfect shells, including the _Pecten\r\nParanensis_, d’Orbigny, casts of a Turritella and Scutella. On this\r\nthere are two strata of the pale brown mudstone, also like that of _S.\r\nJosef_, separated by a darker-coloured, more argillaceous variety,\r\nincluding the _Ostrea Patagonica._ Professor Ehrenberg has examined\r\nthis mudstone for me: he finds in it three already known microscopic\r\norganisms, enveloped in a fine-grained pumiceous tuff, which I shall\r\nhave immediately to describe in detail. Specimens brought to me from\r\nthe uppermost bed, north of the Rio Chupat, consist of this same\r\nsubstance, but of a whiter colour.\r\n\r\nTertiary strata, such as here described, appear to extend along the\r\nwhole coast between Rio Chupat and Port Desire, except where\r\ninterrupted by the underlying claystone porphyry, and by some\r\nmetamorphic rocks; these hard rocks, I may add, are found at intervals\r\nover a space of about five degrees of latitude, from Point Union to a\r\npoint between Port S. Julian and S. Cruz, and will be described in the\r\nensuing chapter. Many gigantic specimens of the _Ostrea Patagonica_\r\nwere collected in the Gulf of St. George.\r\n\r\n_Port Desire._—A good section of the lowest fossiliferous mass, about\r\nforty feet in thickness, resting on claystone porphyry, is exhibited a\r\nfew miles south of the harbour. The shells sufficiently perfect to be\r\nrecognised consist of:—\r\n\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, (also at St. Fé, and whole coast of\r\nPatagonia).\r\n\r\nPecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé, S. Josef,\r\nS. Julian).\r\n\r\nPecten centralis, G. B. Sowerby (also at S. Julian and S. Cruz).\r\n\r\nCucullæa alta, G. B. Sowerby (also at S. Cruz).\r\n\r\nNucula ornata, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTurritella Patagonica, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fossiliferous strata, when not denuded, are conformably covered by\r\na considerable thickness of the fine-grained pumiceous mudstone,\r\ndivided into two masses: the lower half is very fine-grained, slightly\r\nunctuous, and so compact as to break with a semi-conchoidal fracture,\r\nthough yielding to the nail; it includes laminæ of selenite: the upper\r\nhalf precisely resembles the one layer at the Rio Negro, and with the\r\nexception of being whiter, the upper beds at San Josef and Nuevo Gulf.\r\nIn neither mass is there any trace to the naked eye of organic forms.\r\nTaking the entire deposit, it is generally quite white, or yellowish,\r\nor feebly tinted with green; it is either almost friable under the\r\nfinger, or as hard as chalk; it is of easy fusibility, of little\r\nspecific gravity, is not harsh to the touch, adheres to the tongue, and\r\nwhen breathed on exhales a strong aluminous odour; it sometimes\r\ncontains a very little calcareous matter, and traces (besides the\r\nincluded laminæ) of gypsum. Under the microscope, according to\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg,[2] it consists of minute, triturated, cellular,\r\nglassy fragments of pumice, with some broken crystals. In the minute\r\nglassy fragments, Professor Ehrenberg recognises organic structures,\r\nwhich have been affected by volcanic heat: in the specimens from this\r\nplace, and from Port S. Julian, he finds sixteen Polygastrica and\r\ntwelve Phytolitharia. Of these organisms, seven are new forms, the\r\nothers being previously known: all are of marine, and chiefly of\r\noceanic, origin. This deposit to the naked eye resembles the crust\r\nwhich often appears on weathered surfaces of feldspathic rocks; it\r\nlikewise resembles those beds of earthy feldspathic matter, sometimes\r\ninterstratified with porphyritic rocks, as is the case in this very\r\ndistrict with the underlying purple claystone porphyry. From examining\r\nspecimens under a common microscope, and comparing them with other\r\nspecimens undoubtedly of volcanic origin, I had come to the same\r\nconclusion with Professor Ehrenberg, namely, that this great deposit,\r\nin its first origin, is of volcanic nature.\r\n\r\n [2] “Monatsberichten de könig. Akad. zu Berlin,” vom April 1845.\r\n\r\n_Port S. Julian._—On the south side of the harbour, the following\r\nsection (figure No. 17) gives the nature of the beds seen in the cliffs\r\nof the ninety feet plain. Beginning at the top:—first, the earthy mass\r\n(AA), including the remains of the Macrauchenia, with recent shells on\r\nthe surface; second, the porphyritic shingle (B), which in its lower\r\npart is interstratified (owing, I believe, to redisposition during\r\ndenudation) with the white pumiceous mudstone; third, this white\r\nmudstone, about twenty feet in thickness, and divided into two\r\nvarieties (C and D), both closely resembling the lower, fine-grained,\r\nmore unctuous\r\nand compact kind at Port Desire; and, as at that place, including much\r\nselenite; fourth, a fossiliferous mass, divided into three main beds,\r\nof which the uppermost is thin, and consists of ferruginous sandstone,\r\nwith many shells of the great oyster and _ Pecten Paranensis_; the\r\nmiddle bed (E) is a yellowish earthy sandstone abounding with Scutellæ;\r\nand the lowest bed (F) is an indurated, greenish, sandy clay, including\r\nlarge concretions of calcareous sandstone, many shells of the great\r\noyster, and in parts almost made up of fragments of Balanidæ. Out of\r\nthese three beds, I procured the following twelve species, of which the\r\ntwo first were exceedingly numerous in individuals, as were the\r\nTerebratulæ and Turritellæ in certain layers:—\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé, and whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia).\r\n\r\nPecten Paranensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (St. Fé, S. Josef, Port\r\nDesire).\r\n\r\nPecten centralis, G. B. Sowerby (also at Port Desire and S. Cruz).\r\n\r\nPecten geminatus, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTerebratula Patagonica, G. B. Sowerby (also S. Josef).\r\n\r\nStruthiolaria ornata, G. B. Sowerby (also S. Cruz).\r\n\r\nFusus Patagonicus, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nFusus Noachinus, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nScalaria rugulosa, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTurritella ambulacrum, G. B. Sowerby (also S. Cruz).\r\n\r\nPyrula, cast of, like P. ventricosa of Sowerby, Tank Cat.\r\n\r\nBalanus varians, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nScutella, differing from the species from Nuevo Gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 17\r\nSection of the strata exhibited in the cliffs of the ninety feet plain\r\nat Port S. Julian.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the strata exhibited in the cliffs of the\r\nninety feet plain at Port S. Julian.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the inner harbour of Port S. Julian, the fossiliferous\r\nmass is not displayed, and the sea-cliffs from the water’s edge to a\r\nheight of between one and two hundred feet are formed of the white\r\npumiceous mudstone, which here includes innumerable, far-extended,\r\nsometimes horizontal, sometimes inclined or vertical laminæ of\r\ntransparent gypsum, often about an inch in thickness. Further inland,\r\nwith the exception of the superficial gravel, the whole thickness of\r\nthe truncated hills, which represent a formerly continuous plain 950\r\nfeet in height, appears to be formed of this white mudstone: here and\r\nthere, however, at various heights, thin earthy layers, containing the\r\ngreat oyster, _Pecten Paranensis_ and _Turritella ambulacrum_, are\r\ninterstratified;\r\nthus showing that the whole mass belongs to the same epoch. I nowhere\r\nfound even a fragment of a shell actually in the white deposit, and\r\nonly a single cast of a Turritella. Out of the eighteen microscopic\r\norganisms discovered by Ehrenberg in the specimens from this place, ten\r\nare common to the same deposit at Port Desire. I may add that specimens\r\nof this white mudstone, with the same identical characters were brought\r\nme from two points,—one twenty miles north of S. Julian, where a wide\r\ngravel-capped plain, 350 feet in height, is thus composed; and the\r\nother forty miles south of S. Julian, where, on the old charts, the\r\ncliffs are marked as “_Chalk Hills._”\r\n\r\n_Santa Cruz._—The gravel-capped cliffs at the mouth of the river are\r\n355 feet in height: the lower part, to a thickness of fifty or sixty\r\nfeet, consists of a more or less hardened, darkish, muddy, or\r\nargillaceous sandstone (like the lowest bed of Port Desire), containing\r\nvery many shells, some silicified and some converted into yellow\r\ncalcareous spar. The great oyster is here numerous in layers; the\r\nTrigonocelia and Turritella are also very numerous: it is remarkable\r\nthat the _Pecten Paranensis_, so common in all other parts of the\r\ncoast, is here absent: the shells consist of:—\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Pal.” (also at St. Fé and whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia).\r\n\r\nPecten centralis, G. B. Sowerby (also P. Desire and S. Julian).\r\n\r\nVenus meridionalis of G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCrassatella Lyellii, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCardium puelchum, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCardita Patagonica, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nMactra rugata, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nMactra Darwinii, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCucullæa alta, G. B. Sowerby (also P. Desire).\r\n\r\nTrigonocelia insolita, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nNucula (?) glabra, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCrepidula gregaria, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nVoluta alta, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTrochus collaris, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nNatica solida (?), G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nStruthiolaria ornata, G. B. Sowerby (also P. Desire).\r\n\r\nTurritella ambulacrum, G. B. Sowerby (also P. S. Julian).\r\nImperfect fragments of the genera Byssoarca, Artemis, and Fusus.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the cliff is generally divided into three great\r\nstrata, differing slightly in composition, but essentially resembling\r\nthe pumiceous mudstone of the places farther north; the deposit,\r\nhowever, here is more arenaceous, of greater specific gravity, and not\r\nso white: it is interlaced with numerous thin veins, partially or quite\r\nfilled with transverse fibres of gypsum; these fibres were too short to\r\nreach across the vein, have their extremities curved or bent: in the\r\nsame veins with the gypsum, and likewise in separate veins as well as\r\nin little nests, there is much powdery sulphate of magnesia (as\r\nascertained by Mr. Reeks) in an uncompressed form: I believe that this\r\nsalt has not heretofore\r\nbeen found in veins. Of the three beds, the central one is the most\r\ncompact, and more like ordinary sandstone: it includes numerous\r\nflattened spherical concretions, often united like a necklace, composed\r\nof hard calcareous sandstone, containing a few shells: some of these\r\nconcretions were four feet in diameter, and in a horizontal line nine\r\nfeet apart, showing that the calcareous matter must have been drawn to\r\nthe centres of attraction, from a distance of four feet and a half on\r\nboth sides. In the upper and lower finer-grained strata, there were\r\nother concretions of a grey colour, containing calcareous matter, and\r\nso fine-grained and compact, as almost to resemble porcelain-rock: I\r\nhave seen exactly similar concretions in a volcanic tufaceous bed in\r\nChiloe. Although in this upper fine-grained strata, organic remains\r\nwere very rare, yet I noticed a few of the great oyster; and in one\r\nincluded soft ferruginous layer, there were some specimens of the _\r\nCucullæa alta_ (found at Port Desire in the lower fossiliferous mass)\r\nand of the _Mactra rugata_, which latter shell has been partially\r\nconverted into gypsum.\r\n\r\nNo. 18\r\nSection of the plain at Patagonia, on the banks of the S. Cruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the plain at Patagonia, on the banks of the\r\nS. Cruz.]\r\n\r\nIn ascending the valley of the S. Cruz, the upper strata of the\r\ncoast-cliffs are prolonged, with nearly the same characters, for fifty\r\nmiles: at about this point, they begin in the most gradual and scarcely\r\nperceptible manner, to be banded with white lines; and after ascending\r\nten miles farther, we meet with distinct thin layers of whitish,\r\ngreenish, and yellowish fine-grained, fusible sediments. At eighty\r\nmiles from the coast,[3] in a cliff thus composed, there were a few\r\nlayers of ferruginous\r\nsandstone, and of an argillaceous sandstone with concretions of marl\r\nlike those in the Pampas. At one hundred miles from the coast, that is\r\nat a central point between the Atlantic and the Cordillera, we have the\r\nsection in figure No. 18.\r\n\r\n [3] At this spot, for a space of three-quarters of a mile along the\r\n north side of the river, and for a width of half a mile, there has\r\n been a great slip, which has formed hills between sixty and seventy\r\n feet in height, and has tilted the strata into highly inclined and\r\n even vertical positions. The strata generally dipped at an angle of\r\n 45° towards the cliff from which they had slided. I have observed in\r\n slips, both on a small and large scale, that this inward dip is very\r\n general. Is it due to the hydrostatic pressure of water percolating\r\n with difficulty through the strata acting with greater force at the\r\n base of the mass than against the upper part?\r\n\r\nThe upper half of the sedimentary mass, under the basaltic lava,\r\nconsists of innumerable zones of perfectly white bright green,\r\nyellowish and brownish, fine-grained, sometimes incoherent, sedimentary\r\nmatter. The white, pumiceous, trachytic tuff-like varieties are of\r\nrather greater specific gravity than the pumiceous mudstone on the\r\ncoast to the north; some of the layers, especially the browner ones,\r\nare coarser, so that the broken crystals are distinguishable with a\r\nweak lens. The layers vary in character in short distances. With the\r\nexception of a few of the _Ostrea Patagonica_, which appeared to have\r\nrolled down from the cliff above, no organic remains were found. The\r\nchief difference between these layers taken as a whole, and the upper\r\nbeds both at the mouth of the river and on the coast northward, seems\r\nto lie in the occasional presence of more colouring matter, and in the\r\nsupply having been intermittent; these characters, as we have seen,\r\nvery gradually disappear in descending the valley, and this fact may\r\nperhaps be accounted for by the currents of a more open sea having\r\nblended together the sediment from a distant and intermittent source.\r\n\r\nThe coloured layers in the foregoing section rest on a mass, apparently\r\nof great thickness (but much hidden by the talus), of soft sandstone,\r\nalmost composed of minute pebbles, from one-tenth to two-tenths of an\r\ninch in diameter, of the rocks (with the entire exception of the\r\nbasaltic lava) composing the great boulders on the surface of the\r\nplain, and probably composing the neighbouring Cordillera. Five miles\r\nhigher up the valley, and again thirty miles higher up[4] (that is\r\ntwenty miles from the nearest range of the Cordillera), the lower plain\r\nincluded within the upper escarpments, is formed, as seen on the banks\r\nof the river, of a nearly similar but finer-grained, more earthy,\r\nlaminated sandstone, alternating with argillaceous beds, and containing\r\nnumerous moderately sized pebbles of the same rocks, and some shells of\r\nthe great _Ostrea Patagonica._ As most of these shells had been rolled\r\nbefore being here embedded, their presence does not prove that the\r\nsandstone belongs to the great Patagonian tertiary formation, for they\r\nmight have been redeposited in it, when the valley existed as a\r\nsea-strait;\r\nbut as amongst the pebbles there were none of basalt, although the\r\ncliffs on both sides of the valley are composed of this rock, I believe\r\nthat the sandstone does belong to this formation. At the highest point\r\nto which we ascended, twenty miles distant from the nearest slope of\r\nthe Cordillera, I could see the horizontally zoned white beds,\r\nstretching under the black basaltic lava, close up to the mountains; so\r\nthat the valley of the S. Cruz gives a fair idea of the constitution of\r\nthe whole width of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n [4] I found at both places, but not _in situ_, quantities of\r\n coniferous and ordinary dicotyledonous silicified wood, which was\r\n examined for me by Mr. R. Brown.\r\n\r\n_Basaltic lava of the S. Cruz._—This formation is first met with\r\nsixty-seven miles from the mouth of the river; thence it extends\r\nuninterruptedly, generally but not exclusively on the northern side of\r\nthe valley, close up to the Cordillera. The basalt is generally black\r\nand fine-grained, but sometimes grey and laminated; it contains some\r\nolivine, and high up the valley much glassy feldspar, where, also, it\r\nis often amygdaloidal; it is never highly vesicular, except on the\r\nsides of rents and on the upper and lower, spherically laminated\r\nsurfaces. It is often columnar; and in one place I saw magnificent\r\ncolumns, each face twelve feet in width, with their interstices filled\r\nup with calcareous tuff. The streams rest conformably on the white\r\nsedimentary beds, but I nowhere saw the actual junction; nor did I\r\nanywhere see the white beds actually superimposed on the lava; but some\r\nway up the valley at the foot of the uppermost escarpments, they must\r\nbe thus superimposed. Moreover, at the lowest point down the valley,\r\nwhere the streams thin out and terminate in irregular projections, the\r\nspaces or intervals between these projections are filled up to the\r\nlevel of the now denuded and gravel-capped surfaces of the plains, with\r\nthe white-zoned sedimentary beds; proving that this matter continued to\r\nbe deposited after the streams had flowed. Hence we may conclude that\r\nthe basalt is contemporaneous with the upper parts of the great\r\ntertiary formation.\r\n\r\nThe lava where first met with is 130 feet in thickness: it there\r\nconsists of two, three, or perhaps more streams, divided from each\r\nother by vesicular spheroids like those on the surface. From the\r\nstreams having, as it appears, extended to different distances, the\r\nterminal points are of unequal heights. Generally the surface of the\r\nbasalt is smooth them in one part high up the valley, it was so uneven\r\nand hummocky, that until I afterwards saw the streams extending\r\ncontinuously on both sides of the valley up to a height of about three\r\nthousand feet close to the Cordillera, I thought that the craters of\r\neruption were probably close at hand. This hummocky surface I believe\r\nto have been caused by the crossing and heaping up of different\r\nstreams. In one place, there were several rounded ridges about twenty\r\nfeet in height, some of them as broad as high, and some broader, which\r\ncertainly had been formed whilst the lava was fluid, for in transverse\r\nsections each ridge was seen to be concentrically laminated, and to be\r\ncomposed of imperfect columns radiating from common centres, like the\r\nspokes of wheels.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic mass where first met with is, as I have said, 130 feet in\r\nthickness, and, thirty-five miles higher up the valley, it increases to\r\n322 feet. In the first fourteen and a half miles of this distance, the\r\nupper surface of the lava, judging from three measurements taken above\r\nthe level of the river (of which the apparently very uniform\r\ninclination has been calculated from its total height at a point 135\r\nmiles from the mouth), slopes towards the Atlantic at an angle of only\r\n0° 7′ 20″: this must be considered only as an approximate measurement,\r\nbut it cannot be far wrong. Taking the whole thirty-five miles, the\r\nupper surface slopes at an angle of 0° 10′ 53″; but this result is of\r\nno value in showing the inclination of any one stream, for halfway\r\nbetween the two points of measurement, the surface suddenly rises\r\nbetween one hundred and two hundred feet, apparently caused by some of\r\nthe uppermost streams having extended thus far and no farther. From the\r\nmeasurement made at these two points, thirty-five miles apart, the mean\r\ninclination of the sedimentary beds, over which the lava has flowed, is\r\n_now_ (after elevation from under the sea) only 0° 7′ 52″: for the sake\r\nof comparison, it may be mentioned that the bottom of the present sea\r\nin a line from the mouth of the S. Cruz to the Falkland Islands, from a\r\ndepth of seventeen fathoms to a depth of eighty-five fathoms, declines\r\nat an angle of 0° 1′ 22″; between the beach and the depth of seventeen\r\nfathoms, the slope is greater. From a point about half-way up the\r\nvalley, the basaltic mass rises more abruptly towards the foot of the\r\nCordillera, namely, from a height of 1,204 feet, to about 3,000 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nThis great deluge of lava is worthy, in its dimensions, of the great\r\ncontinent to which it belongs. The aggregate streams have flowed from\r\nthe Cordillera to a distance (unparalleled, I believe, in any case yet\r\nknown) of about one hundred geographical miles. Near their furthest\r\nextremity their total thickness is 130 feet, which increase thirty-five\r\nmiles farther inland, as we have just seen, to 322 feet. The least\r\ninclination given by M. E. de Beaumont of the upper surface of a\r\nlava-stream, namely 0° 30′, is that of the great subaerial eruption in\r\n1783 from Skaptar Jukul in Iceland; and M. E. de Beaumont shows[5] that\r\nit must have flowed down a mean inclination of less than 0° 20′. But we\r\nnow see that under the pressure of the sea, successive streams have\r\nflowed over a smooth bottom with a mean inclination of not more than 0°\r\n7′ 52″; and that the upper surface of the terminal portion (over a\r\nspace of fourteen and a half miles) has an inclination of not more than\r\n0° 7′ 20″. If the elevation of Patagonia has been greater nearer the\r\nCordillera than near the Atlantic (as is probable), then these angles\r\nare now all too large. I must repeat, that although the foregoing\r\nmeasurements, which were all carefully taken with the barometer, may\r\nnot be absolutely correct, they cannot be widely erroneous.\r\n\r\n [5] “Mémoires pour servir,” etc., pp. 178 and 217.\r\n\r\nSouthward of the S. Cruz, the cliffs of the 840 feet plain extend to\r\nCoy Inlet, and owing to the naked patches of the white sediment, they\r\nare said on the charts to be “like the coast of Kent.” At Coy Inlet the\r\nhigh plain trends inland, leaving flat-topped outliers. At Port\r\nGallegos (lat. 51° 35′, and ninety miles south of S. Cruz), I am\r\ninformed by Captain Sulivan, R.N., that there is a gravel-capped plain\r\nfrom two to\r\nthree hundred feet in height, formed of numerous strata, some\r\nfine-grained and pale-coloured, like the upper beds at the mouth of the\r\nS. Cruz, others rather dark and coarser, so as to resemble gritstones\r\nor tuffs; these latter include rather large fragments of apparently\r\ndecomposed volcanic rocks; there are, also, included layers of gravel.\r\nThis formation is highly remarkable, from abounding with mammiferous\r\nremains, which have not as yet been examined by Professor Owen, but\r\nwhich include some large, but mostly small, species of Pachydermata,\r\nEdentata, and Rodentia. From the appearance of the pale-coloured,\r\nfine-grained beds, I was inclined to believe that they corresponded\r\nwith the upper beds of the S. Cruz; but Professor Ehrenberg, who has\r\nexamined some of the specimens, informs me that the included\r\nmicroscopical organisms are wholly different, being fresh and\r\nbrackish-water forms. Hence the two to three hundred feet plain at Port\r\nGallegos is of unknown age, but probably of subsequent origin to the\r\ngreat Patagonian tertiary formation.\r\n\r\n_Eastern Tierra del Fuego._—Judging from the height, the general\r\nappearance, and the white colour of the patches visible on the hill\r\nsides, the uppermost plain, both on the north and western side of the\r\nStrait of Magellan, and along the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego as\r\nfar south as near Port St. Polycarp, probably belongs to the great\r\nPatagonian tertiary formation. These higher table-ranges are fringed by\r\nlow, irregular, extensive plains, belonging to the boulder\r\nformation,[6] and composed of coarse unstratified masses, sometimes\r\nassociated (as north of C. Virgin’s) with fine, laminated, muddy\r\nsandstones. The cliffs in Sebastian Bay are 200 feet in height, and are\r\ncomposed of fine sandstones, often in curvilinear layers, including\r\nhard concretions of calcareous sandstone, and layers of gravel. In\r\nthese beds there are fragments of wood, legs of crabs, barnacles\r\nencrusted with corallines still partially retaining their colour,\r\nimperfect fragments of a Pholas distinct from any known species, and of\r\na Venus, approaching very closely to, but slightly different in form\r\nfrom, the _V. lenticularis_, a species living on the coast of Chile.\r\nLeaves of trees are numerous between the laminæ of the muddy sandstone;\r\nthey belong, as I am informed by Dr. J. D. Hooker,[7] to three species\r\nof deciduous beech, different from the two species which compose the\r\ngreat proportion of trees in this forest-clad land. From these facts it\r\nis difficult to conjecture, whether we here see the basal part of the\r\ngreat Patagonian formation, or some later deposit.\r\n\r\n [6] Described in the “Geological Transactions,” vol. vi, p. 415.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] “Botany of the Antarctic Voyage,” p. 212.\r\n\r\n_Summary on the Patagonian tertiary formation._—Four out of the seven\r\nfossil shells, from St. Fé in Entre Rios, were found by M. d’Orbigny in\r\nthe sandstone of the Rio Negro, and by me at San Josef. Three out of\r\nthe six from San Josef are identical with those from Port Desire and S.\r\nJulian, which two places have together fifteen species, out of which\r\nthree are common to both. Santa Cruz has seventeen species, out of\r\nwhich five are common to Port Desire and S. Julian. Considering the\r\ndifference in latitude between these several places, and\r\nthe small number of species altogether collected, namely thirty-six, I\r\nconceive the above proportional number of species in common, is\r\nsufficient to show that the lower fossiliferous mass belongs nearly, I\r\ndo not say absolutely, to the same epoch. What this epoch may be,\r\ncompared with the European tertiary stages, M. d’Orbigny will not\r\npretend to determine. The thirty-six species (including those collected\r\nby myself and by M. d’Orbigny) are all extinct, or at least unknown;\r\nbut it should be borne in mind, that the present coast consists of\r\nshingle, and that no one, I believe, has dredged here for shells; hence\r\nit is not improbable that some of the species may hereafter be found\r\nliving. Some few of the species are closely related with existing ones;\r\nthis is especially the case, according to M. d’Orbigny and Mr. Sowerby,\r\nwith the _ Fusus Patagonicus_; and, according to Mr. Sowerby, with the\r\n_ Pyrula_, the _Venus meridionalis_, the _Crepidula gregaria_, and the\r\n_Turritella ambulacrum_, and _T. Patagonica._ At least three of the\r\ngenera, namely, Cucullæa, Crassatella, and (as determined by Mr.\r\nSowerby) Struthiolaria, are not found in this quarter of the world; and\r\nTrigonocelia is extinct. The evidence taken altogether indicates that\r\nthis great tertiary formation is of considerable antiquity; but when\r\ntreating of the Chilean beds, I shall have to refer again to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe white pumiceous mudstone, with its abundant gypsum, belongs to the\r\nsame general epoch with the underlying fossiliferous mass, as may be\r\ninferred from the shells included in the intercalated layers at Nuevo\r\nGulf, S. Julian, and S. Cruz. Out of the twenty-seven marine\r\nmicroscopic structures found by Professor Ehrenberg in the specimens\r\nfrom S. Julian and Port Desire, ten are common to these two places: the\r\nthree found at Nuevo Gulf are distinct. I have minutely described this\r\ndeposit, from its remarkable characters and its wide extension. From\r\nCoy Inlet to Port Desire, a distance of 230 miles, it is certainly\r\ncontinuous; and I have reason to believe that it likewise extends to\r\nthe Rio Chupat, Nuevo Gulf, and San Josef, a distance of 570 miles: we\r\nhave, also, seen that a single layer occurs at the Rio Negro. At Port\r\nS. Julian it is from eight to nine hundred feet in thickness; and at S.\r\nCruz it extends, with a slightly altered character, up to the\r\nCordillera. From its microscopic structure, and from its analogy with\r\nother formations in volcanic districts, it must be considered as\r\noriginally of volcanic origin: it may have been formed by the\r\nlong-continued attrition of vast quantities of pumice, or judging from\r\nthe manner in which the mass becomes, in ascending the valley of S.\r\nCruz, divided into variously coloured layers, from the long-continued\r\neruption of clouds of fine ashes. In either case, we must conclude,\r\nthat the southern volcanic orifices of the Cordillera, now in a dormant\r\nstate, were at about this period over a wide space, and for a great\r\nlength of time, in action. We have evidence of this fact, in the\r\nlatitude of the Rio Negro, in the sandstone-conglomerate with pumice,\r\nand demonstrative proof of it, at S. Cruz, in the vast deluges of\r\nbasaltic lava: at this same tertiary period, also, there is distinct\r\nevidence of volcanic action in Western Banda Oriental.\r\n\r\nThe Patagonian tertiary formation extends continuously, judging\r\nfrom fossils alone, from S. Cruz to near the Rio Colorado, a distance\r\nof above six hundred miles, and reappears over a wide area in Entre\r\nRios and Banda Oriental, making a total distance of 1,100 miles; but\r\nthis formation undoubtedly extends (though no fossils were collected)\r\nfar south of the S. Cruz, and, according to M. d’Orbigny, 120 miles\r\nnorth of St. Fé. At S. Cruz we have seen that it extends across the\r\ncontinent; being on the coast about eight hundred feet in thickness\r\n(and rather more at S. Julian), and rising with the contemporaneous\r\nlava-streams to a height of about three thousand feet at the base of\r\nthe Cordillera. It rests, wherever any underlying formation can be\r\nseen, on plutonic and metamorphic rocks. Including the newer Pampean\r\ndeposit, and those strata in Eastern Tierra del Fuego of doubtful age,\r\nas well as the boulder formation, we have a line of more than\r\ntwenty-seven degrees of latitude, equal to that from the Straits of\r\nGibraltar to the south of Iceland, continuously composed of tertiary\r\nformations. Throughout this great space the land has been upraised,\r\nwithout the strata having been in a single instance, as far as my means\r\nof observation went, unequally tilted or dislocated by a fault.\r\n\r\n_Tertiary Formations on the West Coast._\r\n\r\n_Chonos Archipelago._—The numerous islands of this group, with the\r\nexception of Lemus, Ypun, consist of metamorphic schists; these two\r\nislands are formed of softish grey and brown, fusible, often laminated\r\nsandstones, containing a few pebbles, fragments of black lignite, and\r\nnumerous mammillated concretions of hard calcareous sandstone. Out of\r\nthese concretions at Ypun (lat. 40° 30′ S.), I extracted the four\r\nfollowing extinct species of shells:—\r\n\r\nTurritella suturalis, G. B. Sowerby (also Navidad).\r\n\r\nSigaretus subglobosus, G. B. Sowerby (also Navidad).\r\n\r\nCytheræa (?) sulculosa (?), G. B. Sowerby (also Chiloe and Huafo?).\r\n\r\nVoluta, fragments of.\r\n\r\nIn the northern parts of this group there are some cliffs of gravel and\r\nof the boulder formation. In the southern part (at P. Andres in Tres\r\nMontes), there is a volcanic formation, probably of tertiary origin.\r\nThe lavas attain a thickness of from two to three hundred feet; they\r\nare extremely variable in colour and nature, being compact, or\r\nbrecciated, or cellular, or amygdaloidal with zeolite, agate and bole,\r\nor porphyritic with glassy albitic feldspar. There is also much\r\nimperfect rubbly pitchstone, with the interstices charged with powdery\r\ncarbonate of lime apparently of contemporaneous origin. These lavas are\r\nconformably associated with strata of breccia and of brown tuff\r\ncontaining lignite. The whole mass has been broken up and tilted at an\r\nangle of 45°, by a series of great volcanic dikes, one of which was\r\nthirty yards in breadth. This volcanic formation resembles one,\r\npresently to be described, in Chiloe.\r\n\r\n_Huafo._—This island lies between the Chonos and Chiloe groups: it is\r\nabout eight hundred feet high, and perhaps has a nucleus of metamorphic\r\nrocks. The strata which I examined consisted of fine-grained\r\nmuddy sandstones, with fragments of lignite and concretions of\r\ncalcareous sandstone. I collected the following extinct shells, of\r\nwhich the Turritella was in great numbers:—\r\n\r\nBulla cosmophila, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nPleurotoma subæqualis, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nFusus cleryanus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage Pal.” (also at Coquimbo).\r\n\r\nTriton leucostomoides, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTurritella Chilensis, G. B. Sowerby (also Mocha).\r\n\r\nVenus, probably a distinct species, but very imperfect.\r\n\r\nCytheræa (?) sulculosa (?), probably a distinct species, but very\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nDentalium majus, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\n_Chiloe._—This fine island is about one hundred miles in length. The\r\nentire southern part, and the whole western coast, consists of\r\nmica-schist, which likewise is seen in the ravines of the interior. The\r\ncentral mountains rise to a height of 3,000 feet, and are said to be\r\npartly formed of granite and greenstone: there are two small volcanic\r\ndistricts. The eastern coast, and large parts of the northern extremity\r\nof the island are composed of gravel, the boulder formation, and\r\nunderlying horizontal strata. The latter are well displayed for twenty\r\nmiles north and south of Castro; they vary in character from common\r\nsandstone to fine-grained, laminated mudstones: all the specimens which\r\nI examined are easily fusible, and some of the beds might be called\r\nvolcanic grit-stones. These latter strata are perhaps related to a mass\r\nof columnar trachyte which occurs behind Castro. The sandstone\r\noccasionally includes pebbles, and many fragments and layers of\r\nlignite; of the latter, some are apparently formed of wood and others\r\nof leaves: one layer on the N.W. side of Lemuy is nearly two feet in\r\nthickness. There is also much silicified wood, both common\r\ndicotyledonous and coniferous: a section of one specimen in the\r\ndirection of the medullary rays has, as I am informed by Mr. R. Brown,\r\nthe discs in a double row placed alternately, and not opposite as in\r\nthe true Araucaria. I found marine remains only in one spot, in some\r\nconcretions of hard calcareous sandstone: in several other districts I\r\nhave observed that organic remains were exclusively confined to such\r\nconcretions; are we to account for this fact, by the supposition that\r\nthe shells lived only at these points, or is it not more probable that\r\ntheir remains were preserved only where concretions were formed? The\r\nshells here are in a bad state, they consist of:—\r\n\r\nTellinides (?) oblonga, G. B. Sowerby (a solenella in M. d’Orbigny’s\r\nopinion).\r\n\r\nNatica striolata, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nNatica (?) pumila, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nCytheræa (?) sulculosa, G. B. Sowerby (also Ypun and Huafo?).\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the northern extremity of the island, near S. Carlos, there is a\r\nlarge volcanic formation, between five and seven hundred feet in\r\nthickness. The commonest lava is blackish-grey or brown, either\r\nvesicular, or amygdaloidal with calcareous spar and bole: most even of\r\nthe darkest varieties fuse into a pale-coloured glass. The next\r\ncommonest variety is a rubbly, rarely well characterised pitchstone\r\n(fusing into a white glass) which passes in the most irregular manner\r\ninto stony grey lavas. This pitchstone, as well as some purple\r\nclaystone porphyry, certainly flowed in the form of streams. These\r\nvarious lavas often pass, at a considerable depth from the surface, in\r\nthe most abrupt and singular manner into wacke. Great masses of the\r\nsolid rock are brecciated, and it was generally impossible to discover\r\nwhether the recementing process had been an igneous or aqueous\r\naction.[8] The beds are obscurely separated from each other; they are\r\nsometimes parted by seams of tuff and layers of pebbles. In one place\r\nthey rested on, and in another place were capped by, tuffs and\r\ngirt-stones, apparently of submarine origin.\r\n\r\n [8] In a cliff of the hardest fragmentary mass, I found several\r\n tortuous, vertical veins, varying in thickness from a few tenths of an\r\n inch to one inch and a half, of a substance which I have not seen\r\n described. It is glossy, and of a brown colour; it is thinly\r\n laminated, with the laminæ transparent and elastic; it is a little\r\n harder than calcareous spar; it is infusible under the blowpipe,\r\n sometimes decrepitates, gives out water, curls up, blackens, and\r\n becomes magnetic. Borax easily dissolves a considerable quantity of\r\n it, and gives a glass tinged with green. I have no idea what its true\r\n nature is. On first seeing it, I mistook it for lignite!\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring peninsula of Lacuy is almost wholly formed of\r\ntufaceous deposits, connected probably in their origin with the\r\nvolcanic hills just described. The tuffs are pale-coloured, alternating\r\nwith laminated mudstones and sandstones (all easily fusible), and\r\npassing sometimes into fine-grained white beds strikingly resembling\r\nthe great upper infusorial deposit of Patagonia, and sometimes into\r\nbrecciolas with pieces of pumice in the last stage of decay; these\r\nagain pass into ordinary coarse breccias and conglomerates of hard\r\nrocks. Within very short distances, some of the finer tuffs often\r\npassed into each other in a peculiar manner, namely, by irregular\r\npolygonal concretions of one variety increasing so much and so suddenly\r\nin size, that the second variety, instead of any longer forming the\r\nentire mass, was left merely in thin veins between the concretions. In\r\na straight line of cliffs, at Point Tenuy, I examined the following\r\nremarkable section (figure No. 19):—\r\n\r\nNo. 19\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section at Point Tenuy]\r\n\r\nOn the left hand, the lower part (AA) consists of regular, alternating\r\nstrata of brown tuffs and greenish laminated mudstone, gently inclined\r\nto the right, and conformably covered by a mass (B _left_) of a white,\r\ntufaceous and brecciolated deposit. On the right hand, the whole cliff\r\n(BB _right_) consists of the same white tufaceous matter, which on this\r\nside presents scarcely a trace of stratification, but to the left\r\nbecomes very gradually and rather indistinctly divided into strata\r\nquite conformable with the underlying beds (AA): moreover, a few\r\nhundred yards further to the left, where the surface has been less\r\ndenuded, the tufaceous strata (B _left_) are conformably covered by\r\nanother set of strata, like the underlying ones (AA) of this section.\r\nIn the middle of the diagram, the beds (AA) are seen to be abruptly cut\r\noff, and to abut against the tufaceous non-stratified mass; but the\r\nline of junction has\r\nbeen accidentally not represented steep enough, for I particularly\r\nnoticed that before the beds had been tilted to the right, this line\r\nmust have been nearly vertical. It appears that a current of water cut\r\nfor itself a deep and steep submarine channel, and at the same time or\r\nafterwards filled it up with the tufaceous and brecciolated matter, and\r\nspread the same over the surrounding submarine beds; the matter\r\nbecoming stratified in these more distant and less troubled parts, and\r\nbeing moreover subsequently covered up by other strata (like AA) not\r\nshown in the diagram. It is singular that three of the beds (of AA) are\r\nprolonged in their proper direction, as represented, beyond the line of\r\njunction into the white tufaceous matter: the prolonged portions of two\r\nof the beds are rounded; in the third, the terminal fragment has been\r\npushed upwards: how these beds could have been left thus prolonged, I\r\nwill not pretend to explain. In another section on the opposite side of\r\na promontory, there was at the foot of this same line of junction, that\r\nis at the bottom of the old submarine channel, a pile of fragments of\r\nthe strata (AA), with their interstices filled up with white tufaceous\r\nmatter: this is exactly what might have been anticipated under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nNo. 20\r\nGround plan showing the relation between veins and concretionary zones\r\nin a mass of tuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground plan showing the relation between veins and\r\nconcretionary zones in a mass of tuff.]\r\n\r\nThe various tufaceous and other beds at this northern end of Chiloe\r\nprobably belong to about the same age with those near Castro, and they\r\ncontain, as there, many fragments of black lignite and of silicified\r\nand pyritous wood, often embedded close together. They also contain\r\nmany and singular concretions: some are of hard calcareous sandstone,\r\nin which it would appear that broken volcanic crystals and scales of\r\nmica have been better preserved (as in the case of the\r\norganic remains near Castro) than in the surrounding mass. Other\r\nconcretions in the white brecciola are of a hard, ferruginous, yet\r\nfusible, nature; they are as round as cannon-balls, and vary from two\r\nor three inches to two feet in diameter; their insides generally\r\nconsist either of fine, scarcely coherent volcanic sand,[9] or of an\r\nargillaceous tuff; in this latter case, the external crust was quite\r\nthin and hard. Some of these spherical balls were encircled in the line\r\nof their equators, by a necklace-like row of smaller concretions. Again\r\nthere were other concretions, irregularly formed, and composed of a\r\nhard, compact, ash-coloured stone, with an almost porcelainous\r\nfracture, adhesive to the tongue, and without any calcareous matter.\r\nThese beds are, also, interlaced by many veins, containing gypsum,\r\nferruginous matter, calcareous spar, and agate. It was here seen with\r\nremarkable distinctness, how intimately concretionary action and the\r\nproduction of fissures and veins are related together. Figure 20 is an\r\naccurate representation of a horizontal space of tuff, about four feet\r\nlong by two and a half in width: the double lines represent the\r\nfissures partially filled with oxide of iron and agate: the curvilinear\r\nlines show the course of the innumerable, concentric, concretionary\r\nzones of different shades of colour and of coarseness in the particles\r\nof tuff. The symmetry and complexity of the arrangement gave the\r\nsurface an elegant appearance.\r\nIt may be seen how obviously the fissures determine (or have been\r\ndetermined by) the shape, sometimes of the whole concretion, and\r\nsometimes only of its central parts. The fissures also determine the\r\ncurvatures of the long undulating zones of concretionary action. From\r\nthe varying composition of the veins and concretions, the amount of\r\nchemical action which the mass has undergone is surprisingly great; and\r\nit would likewise appear from the difference in size in the particles\r\nof the concretionary zones, that the mass, also, has been subjected to\r\ninternal mechanical movements.\r\n\r\n [9] The frequent tendency in iron to form hollow concretions or shell\r\n containing incoherent matter is singular; D’Aubuisson (“Traité de\r\n Géogn.” tome i, p. 318) remarks on this circumstance.\r\n\r\nIn the peninsula of Lacuy, the strata over a width of four miles have\r\nbeen upheaved by three distinct, and some other indistinct, lines of\r\nelevation, ranging within a point of north and south. One line, about\r\ntwo hundred feet in height, is regularly anticlinal, with the strata\r\ndipping away on both sides, at an angle of 15°, from a central “valley\r\nof elevation,” about three hundred yards in width. A second narrow\r\nsteep ridge, only sixty feet high, is uniclinal, the strata throughout\r\ndipping westward; those on both flanks being inclined at an angle of\r\nfrom ten to fifteen degrees; whilst those on the ridge dip in the same\r\ndirection at an angle of between thirty and forty degrees. This ridge,\r\ntraced northwards, dies away; and the beds at its terminal point,\r\ninstead of dipping westward, are inclined 12° to the north. This case\r\ninterested me, as being the first in which I found in South America,\r\nformations perhaps of tertiary origin, broken by lines of elevation.\r\n\r\n_Valdivia: Island of Mocha._—The formations of Chiloe seem to extend\r\nwith nearly the same character to Valdivia, and for some leagues\r\nnorthward of it: the underlying rocks are micaceous schists, and are\r\ncovered up with sandstone and other sedimentary beds, including, as I\r\nwas assured, in many places layers of lignite. I did not land on Mocha\r\n(lat. 38° 20′), but Mr. Stokes brought me specimens of the grey,\r\nfine-grained, slightly calcareous sandstone, precisely like that of\r\nHuafo, containing lignite and numerous Turritellæ. The island is flat\r\ntopped, 1,240 feet in height, and appears like an outlier of the\r\nsedimentary beds on the mainland. The few shells collected consist of:—\r\n\r\nTurritella Chilensis, G. B. Sowerby (also at Huafo).\r\n\r\nFusus, very imperfect, somewhat resembling F. subreflexus of Navidad,\r\nbut probably different.\r\n\r\nVenus, fragments of.\r\n\r\n_Concepcion._—Sailing northward from Valdivia, the coast-cliffs are\r\nseen, first to assume near the R. Tolten, and thence for 150 miles\r\nnorthward, to be continued with the same mineralogical characters,\r\nimmediately to be described at Concepcion. I heard in many places of\r\nbeds of lignite, some of it fine and glossy, and likewise of silicified\r\nwood; near the Tolten the cliffs are low, but they soon rise in height;\r\nand the horizontal strata are prolonged, with a nearly level surface,\r\nuntil coming to a more lofty tract between points Rumena and Lavapie.\r\nHere the beds have been broken up by at least eight or nine parallel\r\nlines of elevation, ranging E. or E.N.E. and W. or W.S.W. These lines\r\ncan be followed with the eye many miles into the interior; they\r\nare all uniclinal, the strata in each dipping to a point between S. and\r\nS.S.E. with an inclination in the central lines of about forty degrees,\r\nand in the outer ones of under twenty degrees. This band of\r\nsymmetrically troubled country is about eight miles in width.\r\n\r\nThe island of Quiriquina, in the Bay of Concepcion, is formed of\r\nvarious soft and often ferruginous sandstones, with bands of pebbles,\r\nand with the lower strata sometimes passing into a conglomerate resting\r\non the underlying metamorphic schists. These beds include subordinate\r\nlayers of greenish impure clay, soft micaceous and calcareous\r\nsandstones, and reddish friable earthy matter with white specks like\r\ndecomposed crystals of feldspar; they include, also, hard concretions,\r\nfragments of shells, lignite, and silicified wood. In the upper part\r\nthey pass into white, soft sediments and brecciolas, very like those\r\ndescribed at Chiloe; as indeed is the whole formation. At Lirguen and\r\nother places on the eastern side of the bay, there are good sections of\r\nthe lower sandstones, which are generally ferruginous, but which vary\r\nin character, and even pass into an argillaceous nature; they contain\r\nhard concretions, fragments of lignite, silicified wood, and pebbles\r\n(of the same rocks with the pebbles in the sandstones of Quiriquina),\r\nand they alternate with numerous, often very thin layers of imperfect\r\ncoal, generally of little specific gravity. The main bed here is three\r\nfeet thick; and only the coal of this one bed has a glossy fracture.\r\nAnother irregular, curvilinear bed of brown, compact lignite, is\r\nremarkable for being included in a mass of coarse gravel. These\r\nimperfect coals, when placed in a heap, ignite spontaneously. The\r\ncliffs on this side of the bay, as well as on the island of Quiriquina,\r\nare capped with red friable earth, which, as stated in the Second\r\nChapter, is of recent formation. The stratification in this\r\nneighbourhood is generally horizontal; but near Lirguen the beds dip\r\nN.W. at an angle of 23°; near Concepcion they are also inclined: at the\r\nnorthern end of Quiriquina they have been tilted at an angle of 30°,\r\nand at the southern end at angles varying from 15° to 40°: these\r\ndislocations must have taken place under the sea.\r\n\r\nA collection of shells, from the island of Quiriquina, has been\r\ndescribed by M. d’Orbigny: they are all extinct, and from their generic\r\ncharacter, M. d’Orbigny inferred that they were of tertiary origin:\r\nthey consist of:—\r\n\r\nScalaria Chilensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nNatica Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nNatica australis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nFusus difficilis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nPyrula longirostra, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nPleurotoma Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nCardium auca, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nCardium acuticostatum, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nVenus auca, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nMactra cecileana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nMactra Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nArca Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nNucula Largillierti, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nTrigonia Hanetiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nDuring a second visit of the _Beagle_ to Concepcion, Mr. Kent collected\r\nfor me some silicified wood and shells out of the concretions in the\r\nsandstone from Tome, situated a short distance north of Lirguen. They\r\nconsist of:—\r\n\r\n\r\nNatica australis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nMactra Araucana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nTrigonia Hanetiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\n\r\nPecten, fragments of, probably two species, but too imperfect for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBaculites vagina, E. Forbes.\r\n\r\nNautilus d’Orbignyanus, E. Forbes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these shells, Captain Belcher[10] found here an _Ammonite_,\r\nnearly three feet in diameter, and so heavy that he could not bring it\r\naway; fragments are deposited at Haslar Hospital: he also found the\r\nsilicified vertebræ of some very large animal. From the identity in\r\nmineralogical nature of the rocks, and from Captain Belcher’s minute\r\ndescription of the coast between Lirguen and Tome, the fossiliferous\r\nconcretions at this latter place certainly belong to the same formation\r\nwith the beds examined by myself at Lirguen; and these again are\r\nundoubtedly the same with the strata of Quiriquina; moreover; the three\r\nfirst of the shells from Tome, though associated in the same\r\nconcretions with the Baculite, are identical with the species from\r\nQuiriquina. Hence all the sandstone and lignitiferous beds in this\r\nneighbourhood certainly belong to the same formation. Although the\r\ngeneric character of the Quiriquina fossils naturally led M. d’Orbigny\r\nto conceive that they were of tertiary origin, yet as we now find them\r\nassociated with the _Baculites vagina_ and with an Ammonite, we must,\r\nin the opinion of M. d’Orbigny, and if we are guided by the analogy of\r\nthe northern hemisphere, rank them in the Cretaceous system. Moreover,\r\nthe _Baculites vagina_, which is in a tolerable state of preservation,\r\nappears to Professor E. Forbes certainly to be identical with a\r\nspecies, so named by him, from Pondicherry in India; where it is\r\nassociated with numerous decidedly cretaceous species, which approach\r\nmost nearly to Lower Greensand or Neocomian forms: this fact,\r\nconsidering the vast distance between Chile and India, is truly\r\nsurprising. Again, the _Nautilus d’Orbignyanus_, as far as its\r\nimperfect state allows of comparison, resembles, as I am informed by\r\nProfessor Forbes, both in its general form and in that of its chambers,\r\ntwo species from the Upper Greensand. It may be added that every one of\r\nthe above-named genera from Quiriquina, which have an apparently\r\ntertiary character, are found in the Pondicherry strata. There are,\r\nhowever, some difficulties on this view of the formations at Concepcion\r\nbeing cretaceous, which I shall afterwards allude to; and I will here\r\nonly state that the _Cardium auca_ is found also at Coquimbo, the beds\r\nat which place, there can be no doubt, are tertiary.\r\n\r\n [10] “Zoology of Captain Beechey’s Voyage,” p. 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Navidad._[11]—The Concepcion formation extends some distance\r\nnorthward, but how far I know not; for the next point at which I landed\r\nwas at Navidad, 160 miles north of Concepcion, and 60 miles south of\r\nValparaiso. The cliffs here are about eight hundred feet in height:\r\nthey consist, wherever I could examine them, of fine-grained,\r\nyellowish, earthy sandstones, with ferruginous veins, and with\r\nconcretions of\r\nhard calcareous sandstone. In one part, there were many pebbles of the\r\ncommon metamorphic porphyries of the Cordillera: and near the base of\r\nthe cliff, I observed a single rounded boulder of greenstone, nearly a\r\nyard in diameter. I traced this sandstone formation beneath the\r\nsuperficial covering of gravel, for some distance inland: the strata\r\nare slightly inclined from the sea towards the Cordillera, which\r\napparently has been caused by their having been accumulated against or\r\nround outlying masses of granite, of which some points project near the\r\ncoast. The sandstone contains fragments of wood, either in the state of\r\nlignite or partially silicified, sharks’ teeth, and shells in great\r\nabundance, both high up and low down the sea-cliffs. Pectunculus and\r\nOliva were most numerous in individuals, and next to them Turritella\r\nand Fusus. I collected in a short time, though suffering from illness,\r\nthe following thirty-one species, all of which are extinct, and several\r\nof the genera do not now range (as we shall hereafter show) nearly so\r\nfar south:—\r\n\r\nGastridium cepa, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nMonoceros, fragments of, considered by M. d’Orbigny as a new species.\r\n\r\nVoluta alta, G. B.

Sowerby (fragments of).\r\n\r\nTrochus lævis, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nTrochus collaris, G. B. Sowerby (considered by M. d’Orbigny as the\r\nyoung of the T. lævis).\r\n\r\nCassis monilifer, G. B.

Cytheræa and Mactra, fragments of (considered by M. d’Orbigny\r\nas new species).\r\n\r\nPecten, fragments of.\r\n\r\n [11] I was guided to this locality by the Report on M. Gay’s\r\n “Geological Researches,” in the “Annales des Scienc. Nat.” (1st\r\n series, tome 28.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo._—For more than two hundred miles northward of Navidad, the\r\ncoast consists of plutonic and metamorphic rocks, with the exception of\r\nsome quite insignificant superficial beds of recent origin. At Tonguay,\r\ntwenty-five miles south of Coquimbo, tertiary beds recommence. I have\r\nalready minutely described in the Second Chapter, the step-formed\r\nplains of Coquimbo, and the upper calcareous beds (from twenty to\r\nthirty feet in thickness) containing shells of recent species, but in\r\ndifferent proportions from those on the beach. There remains to be\r\ndescribed only the underlying ancient tertiary beds, represented in\r\nFigure 21 by the letters F and E:—\r\n\r\nNo. 21\r\nSection of the tertiary formation at Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the tertiary formation at Coquimbo.]\r\n\r\nI obtained good sections of bed (F) only in Herradura Bay: it consists\r\nof soft whitish sandstone, with ferruginous veins, some pebbles of\r\ngranite, and concretionary layers of hard calcareous sandstone. These\r\nconcretions are remarkable from the great number of large silicified\r\nbones, apparently of cetaceous animals, which they contain; and\r\nlikewise of a shark’s teeth, closely resembling those of the\r\n_Carcharias megalodon._ Shells of the following species, of which the\r\ngigantic Oyster and Perna are the most conspicuous, are numerously\r\nembedded in the concretions:—\r\n\r\nBulla ambigua, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nMonoceros Blainvillii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nCardium auca, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nPanopæa Coquimbensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nPerna Gaudichaudi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Pal.\r\n\r\nArtemis ponderosa; Mr. Sowerby can find no distinguishing character\r\nbetween this fossil and the recent A. ponderosa; it is certainly an\r\nArtemis, as shown by the pallial impression.\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica (?); Mr. Sowerby can point out no distinguishing\r\ncharacter between this species and that so eminently characteristic of\r\nthe great Patagonian formation; but he will not pretend to affirm that\r\nthey are identical.\r\n\r\nFragments of a Venus and Natica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cliffs on one side of Herradura Bay are capped by a mass of\r\nstratified shingle, containing a little calcareous matter, and I did\r\nnot doubt that it belonged to the same recent formation with the gravel\r\non the surrounding plains, also cemented by calcareous matter, until to\r\nmy surprise, I found in the midst of it, a single thin layer almost\r\nentirely composed of the above gigantic oyster.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance inland, I obtained several sections of the bed\r\n(E), which, though different in appearance from the lower bed (F),\r\nbelongs to the same formation: it consists of a highly ferruginous\r\nsandy mass, almost composed, like the lowest bed at Port S. Julian, of\r\nfragments of Balanidæ; it includes some pebbles, and layers of\r\nyellowish-brown mudstone. The embedded shells consist of:—\r\n\r\nMonoceros Blainvillii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nMonoceros ambiguus, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nAnomia alternans, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nPecten rudis, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nPerna Gaudichaudi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica (?), d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOstrea, small species, in imperfect state; it appeared to me like a\r\nsmall kind now living in, but very rare in the bay.\r\n\r\nMytilus Chiloensis; Mr. Sowerby can find no distinguishing character\r\nbetween this fossil, as far as its not very perfect condition allows of\r\ncomparison, and the recent species.\r\n\r\nBalanus Coquimbensis, G. B. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nBalanus psittacus? King. This appears to Mr. Sowerby and myself\r\nidentical with a very large and common species now living on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost layers of this ferrugino-sandy mass are conformably\r\ncovered by, and impregnated to the depth of several inches with, the\r\ncalcareous matter of the bed (D) called _ losa_: hence I at one time\r\nimagined that there was a gradual passage between them; but as all the\r\nspecies are recent in the bed (D), whilst the most characteristic\r\nshells of the uppermost layers of (E) are the extinct Perna, Pecten,\r\nand Monoceros, I agree with M. d’Orbigny, that this view is erroneous,\r\nand that there is only a mineralogical passage between them, and no\r\ngradual transition in the nature of their organic remains. Besides the\r\nfourteen species enumerated from these two lower beds, M. d’Orbigny has\r\ndescribed ten other species given to him from this locality; namely:—\r\n\r\nFusus Cleryanus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nFusus petitianus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus hanetiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus incerta (?) d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus Cleryana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus petitiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus Chilensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nSolecurtus hanetianus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nMactra auca, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOliva serena, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOf these twenty-four shells, all are extinct, except, according to Mr.\r\nSowerby, the _Artemis ponderosa, Mytilus Chiloensis,_ and probably the\r\ngreat Balanus.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo to Copiapo._—A few miles north of Coquimbo, I met with\r\nthe ferruginous, balaniferous mass (E) with many silicified bones; I\r\nwas informed that these silicified bones occur also at Tonguay, south\r\nof Coquimbo: their number is certainly remarkable, and they seem to\r\ntake the place of the silicified wood, so common on the\r\ncoast-formations of Southern Chile. In the valley of Chañeral, I again\r\nsaw this same formation, capped with the recent calcareous beds. I here\r\nleft the coast, and did not see any more of the tertiary formations,\r\nuntil descending to the sea at Copiapo: here in one place I found\r\nvariously coloured layers of sand and soft sandstone, with seams of\r\ngypsum, and in another place, a comminuted shelly mass, with layers of\r\nrotten-stone and seams of gypsum, including many of the extinct\r\ngigantic oyster: beds with these oysters are said to occur at English\r\nHarbour, a few miles north of Copiapo.\r\n\r\n_Coast of Peru._—With the exception of deposits containing recent\r\nshells and of quite insignificant dimensions, no tertiary formations\r\nhave been observed on this coast, for a space of twenty-two degrees of\r\nlatitude north of Copiapo, until coming to Payta, where there is said\r\nto be a considerable calcareous deposit: a few fossils have been\r\ndescribed by M. d’Orbigny from this place, namely:—\r\n\r\nRostellaria Gaudichaudi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nPectunculus Paytensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nVenus petitiana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Pal.\r\n\r\nOstrea Patagonica? This great oyster (of which specimens have been\r\ngiven me) cannot be distinguished by Mr. Sowerby from some of the\r\nvarieties from Patagonia; though it would be hazardous to assert it is\r\nthe same with that species, or with that from Coquimbo.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._—The formations described in this chapter, have,\r\nin the case of Chiloe and probably in that of Concepcion and Navidad,\r\napparently been accumulated in troughs formed by submarine ridges\r\nextending parallel to the ancient shores of the continent; in the case\r\nof the islands of Mocha and Huafo it is highly probable, and in that of\r\nYpun and Lemus almost certain, that they were accumulated round\r\nisolated rocky centres or nuclei, in the same manner as mud and sand\r\nare now collecting round the outlying islets and reefs in the West\r\nIndian Archipelago. Hence, I may remark, it does not follow that the\r\noutlying tertiary masses of Mocha and Huafo were ever continuously\r\nunited at the same level with the formations on the mainland, though\r\nthey may have been of contemporaneous origin, and been subsequently\r\nupraised to the same height. In the more northern parts of Chile, the\r\ntertiary strata seem to have been separately accumulated in bays, now\r\nforming the mouths of valleys.\r\n\r\nThe relation between these several deposits on the shores of the\r\nPacific, is not nearly so clear as in the case of the tertiary\r\nformations on the Atlantic. Judging from the form and height of the\r\nland (evidence which I feel sure is here much more trustworthy than it\r\ncan ever be in such broken continents as that of Europe), from the\r\nidentity of mineralogical composition, from the presence of fragments\r\nof lignite and of silicified wood, and from the intercalated layers of\r\nimperfect coal, I must believe\r\nthat the coast-formations from Central Chiloe to Concepcion, a distance\r\nof 400 miles, are of the same age: from nearly similar reasons, I\r\nsuspect that the beds of Mocha, Huafo, and Ypun, belong also to the\r\nsame period. The commonest shell in Mocha and Huafo is the same species\r\nof Turritella; and I believe the same Cytheræa is found on the islands\r\nof Huafo, Chiloe, and Ypun; but with these trifling exceptions, the few\r\norganic remains found at these places are distinct. The numerous shells\r\nfrom Navidad, with the exception of two, namely, the Sigaretus and\r\nTurritella found at Ypun, are likewise distinct from those found in any\r\nother part of this coast. Coquimbo has _Cardium auca_ in common with\r\nConcepcion, and _Fusus Cleryanus_ with Huafo; I may add, that Coquimbo\r\nhas _Venus petitiana_, and a gigantic oyster (said by M. d’Orbigny also\r\nto be found a little south of Concepcion) in common with Payta, though\r\nthis latter place is situated twenty-two degrees northward of lat. 27°,\r\nto which point the Coquimbo formation extends.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, and from the generic resemblance of the fossils from\r\nthe different localities, I cannot avoid the suspicion that they all\r\nbelong to nearly the same epoch, which epoch, as we shall immediately\r\nsee, must be a very ancient tertiary one. But as the Baculite,\r\nespecially considering its apparent identity with the Cretaceous\r\nPondicherry species, and the presence of an Ammonite, and the\r\nresemblance of the Nautilus to two upper greensand species, together\r\nafford very strong evidence that the formation of Concepcion is a\r\nSecondary one; I will, in my remarks on the fossils from the other\r\nlocalities, put on one side those from Concepcion and from Eastern\r\nChiloe, which, whatever their age may be, appear to me to belong to one\r\ngroup. I must, however, again call attention to the fact that the\r\n_Cardium auca_ is found both at Concepcion and in the undoubtedly\r\ntertiary strata of Coquimbo: nor should the possibility be overlooked,\r\nthat as Trigonia, though known in the northern hemisphere only as a\r\nSecondary genus, has living representatives in the Australian seas, so\r\na Baculite, Ammonite, and Trigonia may have survived in this remote\r\npart of the southern ocean to a somewhat later period than to the north\r\nof the equator.\r\n\r\nBefore passing in review the fossils from the other localities, there\r\nare two points, with respect to the formations between Concepcion and\r\nChiloe, which deserve some notice. First, that though the strata are\r\ngenerally horizontal, they have been upheaved in Chiloe in a set of\r\nparallel anticlinal and uniclinal lines ranging north and south,—in the\r\ndistrict near P. Rumena by eight or nine far-extended, most\r\nsymmetrical, uniclinal lines ranging nearly east and west,—and in the\r\nneighbourhood of Concepcion by less regular single lines, directed both\r\nN.E. and S.W., and N.W. and S.E. This fact is of some interest, as\r\nshowing that within a period which cannot be considered as very ancient\r\nin relation to the history of the continent, the strata between the\r\nCordillera and the Pacific have been broken up in the same variously\r\ndirected manner as have the old plutonic and metamorphic rocks in this\r\nsame district. The second point is, that the sandstone between\r\nConcepcion and Southern Chiloe is everywhere lignitiferous, and\r\nincludes much silicified wood; whereas the formations in Northern Chile\r\ndo not\r\ninclude beds of lignite or coal, and in place of the fragments of\r\nsilicified wood there are silicified bones. Now, at the present day,\r\nfrom Cape Horn to near Concepcion, the land is entirely concealed by\r\nforests, which thin out at Concepcion, and in Central and Northern\r\nChile entirely disappear. This coincidence in the distribution of the\r\nfossil wood and the living forests may be quite accidental; but I\r\nincline to take a different view of it; for, as the difference in\r\nclimate, on which the presence of forests depends, is here obviously in\r\nchief part due to the form of the land, and as the Cordillera\r\nundoubtedly existed when the lignitiferous beds were accumulating, I\r\nconceive it is not improbable that the climate, during the\r\nlignitiferous period, varied on different parts of the coast in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner as it now does. Looking to an earlier epoch,\r\nwhen the strata of the Cordillera were depositing, there were islands\r\nwhich even in the latitude of Northern Chile, where now all is\r\nirreclaimably desert, supported large coniferous forests.\r\n\r\nSeventy-nine species of fossil shells, in a tolerably recognisable\r\ncondition, from the coast of Chile and Peru, are described in this\r\nvolume, and in the Palæontological part of M. d’Orbigny’s “Voyage”: if\r\nwe put on one side the twenty species exclusively found at Concepcion\r\nand Chiloe, fifty-nine species from Navidad and the other specified\r\nlocalities remain. Of these fifty-nine species only an Artemis, a\r\nMytilus and Balanus, all from Coquimbo, are (in the opinion of Mr.\r\nSowerby, but not in that of M. d’Orbigny) identical with living shells;\r\nand it would certainly require a better series of specimens to render\r\nthis conclusion certain. Only the _Turritella Chilensis_ from Huafo and\r\nMocha, the _T. Patagonica_ and _Venus meridionalis_ from Navidad, come\r\nvery near to recent South American shells, namely, the two Turritellas\r\nto _T. cingulata_, and the Venus to _V. exalbida_: some few other\r\nspecies come rather less near; and some few resemble forms in the older\r\nEuropean tertiary deposits: none of the species resemble secondary\r\nforms. Hence I conceive there can be no doubt that these formations are\r\ntertiary,—a point necessary to consider, after the case of Concepcion.\r\nThe fifty-nine species belong to thirty-two genera; of these,\r\nGastridium is extinct, and three or four of the genera (viz. Panopæa,\r\nRostellaria, Corbis (?), and I believe Solecurtus) are not now found on\r\nthe west coast of South America. Fifteen of the genera have on this\r\ncoast living representatives in about the same latitudes with the\r\nfossil species; but twelve genera now range very differently to what\r\nthey formerly did. The idea of the table on the following page, in\r\nwhich the difference between the extension in latitude of the fossil\r\nand existing species is shown, is taken from M. d’Orbigny’s work; but\r\nthe range of the living shells is given on the authority of Mr. Cuming,\r\nwhose long-continued researches on the conchology of South America are\r\nwell-known.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that very few, if any, of the fifty-nine fossil shells\r\nare identical with, or make any close approach to, living species; when\r\nwe consider that some of the genera do not now exist on the west coast\r\nof South America, and that no less than twelve genera out of the\r\nthirty-two formerly ranged very differently from the existing species\r\nof the\r\nsame genera, we must admit that these deposits are of considerable\r\nantiquity, and that they probably verge on the commencement of the\r\ntertiary era. May we not venture to believe, that they are of nearly\r\ncontemporaneous origin with the Eocene formations of the northern\r\nhemisphere?\r\n\r\nGenera, with living and tertiary species on the west coast of S.\r\nAmerica.[12]\tLatitudes, in which found fossil on the coasts of Chile\r\nand Peru.\tSouthernmost latitude, in which found living on the west\r\ncoast of\r\nS.

Scalaria was\r\n found at Valparaiso; Arca, at Iquique, in lat. 20°, by Mr. Cuming;\r\n Arca, also, was found by Captain King, at Juan Fernandez, in lat. 33°\r\n 30′.\r\n\r\nComparing the fossil remains from the coast of Chile (leaving out, as\r\nbefore, Concepcion and Chiloe) with those from Patagonia, we may\r\nconclude, from their generic resemblance, and from the small number of\r\nthe species which from either coast approach closely to living forms,\r\nthat the formations of both belong to nearly the same epoch; and this\r\nis the opinion of M. D’Orbigny. Had not a single fossil shell been\r\ncommon to the two coasts, it could not have been argued that the\r\nformations belonged to different ages; for Messrs. Cuming and Hinds\r\nhave found, on the comparison of nearly two thousand living species\r\nfrom the opposite sides of South America, only one in common, namely,\r\nthe _Purpura lapillus_ from both sides of the Isthmus of Panama: even\r\nthe shells collected by myself amongst the Chonos Islands and on the\r\ncoast of Patagonia, are dissimilar, and we must descend to the apex of\r\nthe\r\ncontinent, to Tierra del Fuego, to find these two great conchological\r\nprovinces united into one. Hence it is remarkable that four or five of\r\nthe fossil shells from Navidad, namely, _ Voluta alta, Turritella\r\nPatagonica, Trochus collaris, Venus meridionalis,_ perhaps (Natica\r\nsolida), and perhaps the large oyster from Coquimbo, are considered by\r\nMr. Sowerby as identical with species from Santa Cruz and P. Desire. M.\r\nd’Orbigny, however, admits the perfect identity only of the Trochus.\r\n\r\n_On the temperature of the Tertiary period._—As the number of the\r\nfossil species and genera from the western and eastern coasts is\r\nconsiderable, it will be interesting to consider the probable nature of\r\nthe climate under which they lived. We will first take the case of\r\nNavidad, in lat. 34°, where thirty-one species were collected, and\r\nwhich, as we shall presently see, must have inhabited shallow water,\r\nand therefore will necessarily well exhibit the effects of temperature.\r\nReferring to the table given in the previous page, we find that the\r\nexisting species of the genera Cassis, Pyrula, Pleurotoma, Terebra, and\r\nSigaretus, which are generally (though by no means invariably)\r\ncharacteristic of warmer latitudes, do not at the present day range\r\nnearly so far south on this line of coast as the fossil species\r\nformerly did. Including Coquimbo, we have Perna in the same\r\npredicament. The first impression from this fact is, that the climate\r\nmust formerly have been warmer than it now is; but we must be very\r\ncautious in admitting this, for Cardium, Bulla, and Fusus (and, if we\r\ninclude Coquimbo, Anomia and Artemis) likewise formerly ranged farther\r\nsouth than they now do; and as these genera are far from being\r\ncharacteristic of hot climates, their former greater southern range may\r\nwell have been owing to causes quite distinct from climate: Voluta,\r\nagain, though generally so tropical a genus, is at present confined on\r\nthe west coast to colder or more southern latitudes than it was during\r\nthe tertiary period. The _Trochus collaris_, moreover, and, as we have\r\njust seen according to Mr. Sowerby, two or three other species,\r\nformerly ranged from Navidad as far south as Santa Cruz in latitude 50\r\ndegrees. If, instead of comparing the fossils of Navidad, as we have\r\nhitherto done, with the shells now living on the west coast of South\r\nAmerica, we compare them with those found in other parts of the world,\r\nunder nearly similar latitudes; for instance, in the southern parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean or of Australia, there is no evidence that the sea\r\noff Navidad was formerly hotter than what might have been expected from\r\nits latitude, even if it was somewhat warmer than it now is when cooled\r\nby the great southern polar current. Several of the most tropical\r\ngenera have no representative fossils at Navidad; and there are only\r\nsingle species of Cassis, Pyrula, and Sigaretus, two of Pleurotoma and\r\ntwo of Terebra, but none of these species are of conspicuous size. In\r\nPatagonia, there is even still less evidence in the character of the\r\nfossils, of the climate having been formerly warmer.[13]\r\nAs from the various reasons already assigned, there can be little doubt\r\nthat the formations of Patagonia and at least of Navidad and Coquimbo\r\nin Chile, are the equivalents of an ancient stage in the tertiary\r\nformations of the northern hemisphere, the conclusion that the climate\r\nof the southern seas at this period was not hotter than what might have\r\nbeen expected from the latitude of each place, appears to me highly\r\nimportant; for we must believe, in accordance with the views of Mr.\r\nLyell, that the causes which gave to the older tertiary productions of\r\nthe quite temperate zones of Europe a tropical character, _were of a\r\nlocal character and did not affect the entire globe._ On the other\r\nhand, I have endeavoured to show, in the “Geological Transactions,”\r\nthat, at a much later period, Europe and North and South America were\r\nnearly contemporaneously subjected to ice-action, and consequently to a\r\ncolder, or at least more equable, climate than that now characteristic\r\nof the same latitudes.\r\n\r\n [13] It may be worth while to mention that the shells living at the\r\n present day on this eastern side of South America, in lat. 40°, have\r\n perhaps a more tropical character than those in corresponding\r\n latitudes on the shores of Europe: for at Bahia Blanca and S. Blas,\r\n there are two fine species of Voluta and four of Oliva.\r\n\r\n_On the absence of extensive modern conchiferous deposits in South\r\nAmerica; and on the contemporaneousness of the older Tertiary deposits\r\nat distant points being due to contemporaneous movements of\r\nsubsidence._—Knowing from the researches of Professor E. Forbes, that\r\nmolluscous animals chiefly abound within a depth of 100 fathoms and\r\nunder, and bearing in mind how many thousand miles of both coasts of\r\nSouth America have been upraised within the recent period by a slow,\r\nlong-continued, intermittent movement,—seeing the diversity in nature\r\nof the shores and the number of shells now living on them,—seeing also\r\nthat the sea off Patagonia and off many parts of Chile, was during the\r\ntertiary period highly favourable to the accumulation of sediment,—the\r\nabsence of extensive deposits including recent shells over these vast\r\nspaces of coast is highly remarkable. The conchiferous calcareous beds\r\nat Coquimbo, and at a few isolated points northward, offer the most\r\nmarked exception to this statement; for these beds are from twenty to\r\nthirty feet in thickness, and they stretch for some miles along shore,\r\nattaining, however, only a very trifling breadth. At Valdivia there is\r\nsome sandstone with imperfect casts of shells, which _possibly_ may\r\nbelong to the recent period: parts of the boulder formation and the\r\nshingle-beds on the lower plains of Patagonia probably belong to this\r\nsame period, but neither are fossiliferous: it also so happens that the\r\ngreat Pampean formation does not include, with the exception of the\r\nAzara, any mollusca. There cannot be the smallest doubt that the\r\nupraised shells along the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific, whether\r\nlying on the bare surface, or embedded in mould or in sand-hillocks,\r\nwill in the course of ages be destroyed by alluvial action: this\r\nprobably will be the case even with the calcareous beds of Coquimbo, so\r\nliable to dissolution by rain-water. If we take into consideration the\r\nprobability of oscillations of level and the consequent action of the\r\ntidal-waves at different heights, their destruction will appear almost\r\ncertain. Looking to an epoch as far distant in futurity as we now are\r\nfrom the past Miocene period, there seems to me scarcely a chance,\r\nunder existing conditions, of the numerous shells now living in those\r\nzones of depths most fertile in life, and found exclusively on the\r\nwestern and south-eastern coasts of S. America, being preserved to this\r\nimaginary distant epoch. A whole conchological series will in time be\r\nswept away, with no memorials of their existence preserved in the\r\nearth’s crust.\r\n\r\nCan any light be thrown on this remarkable absence of recent\r\nconchiferous deposits on these coasts, on which, at an ancient tertiary\r\nepoch, strata abounding with organic remains were extensively\r\naccumulated? I think there can, namely, by considering the conditions\r\nnecessary for the preservation of a formation to a distant age. Looking\r\nto the enormous amount of denudation which on all sides of us has been\r\neffected,—as evidenced by the lofty cliffs cutting off on so many\r\ncoasts horizontal and once far-extended strata of no great antiquity\r\n(as in the case of Patagonia),—as evidenced by the level surface of the\r\nground on both sides of great faults and dislocations,—by inland lines\r\nof escarpments, by outliers, and numberless other facts, and by that\r\nargument of high generality advanced by Mr. Lyell, namely, that every\r\n_sedimentary_ formation, whatever its thickness may be, and over\r\nhowever many hundred square miles it may extend, is the result and the\r\nmeasure of an equal amount of wear and tear of pre-existing formations;\r\nconsidering these facts, we must conclude that, as an ordinary rule, a\r\nformation to resist such vast destroying powers, and to last to a\r\ndistant epoch, must be of wide extent, and either in itself, or\r\ntogether with superincumbent strata, be of great thickness. In this\r\ndiscussion, we are considering only formations containing the remains\r\nof marine animals, which, as before mentioned, live, with some\r\nexceptions within (most of them much within) depths of 100 fathoms.\r\nHow, then, can a thick and widely extended formation be accumulated,\r\nwhich shall include such organic remains? First, let us take the case\r\nof the bed of the sea long remaining at a stationary level: under these\r\ncircumstances it is evident that _conchiferous_ strata can accumulate\r\nonly to the same thickness with the depth at which the shells can live;\r\non gently inclined coasts alone can they accumulate to any considerable\r\nwidth; and from the want of superincumbent pressure, it is probable\r\nthat the sedimentary matter will seldom be much consolidated: such\r\nformations have no very good chance, when in the course of time they\r\nare upraised, of long resisting the powers of denudation. The chance\r\nwill be less if the submarine surface, instead of having remained\r\nstationary, shall have gone on slowly rising during the deposition of\r\nthe strata, for in this case their total thickness must be less, and\r\neach part, before being consolidated or thickly covered up by\r\nsuperincumbent matter, will have had successively to pass through the\r\nordeal of the beach; and on most coasts, the waves on the beach tend to\r\nwear down and disperse every object exposed to their action. Now, both\r\non the south-eastern and western shores of S. America, we have had\r\nclear proofs that the land has been slowly rising, and in the long\r\nlines of lofty cliffs, we have seen that the tendency of the sea is\r\nalmost everywhere to eat into the land. Considering these facts, it\r\nceases, I think, to be surprising, that extensive recent conchiferous\r\ndeposits are entirely absent on the southern and western shores of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us take the one remaining case, of the bed of the sea slowly\r\nsubsiding during a length of time, whilst sediment has gone on being\r\ndeposited. It is evident that strata might thus accumulate to any\r\nthickness, each stratum being deposited in shallow water, and\r\nconsequently abounding with those shells which cannot live at great\r\ndepths: the pressure, also, I may observe, of each fresh bed would aid\r\nin consolidating all the lower ones. Even on a rather steep coast,\r\nthough such must ever be unfavourable to widely extended deposits, the\r\nformations would always tend to increase in breadth from the water\r\nencroaching on the land. Hence we may admit that periods of slow\r\nsubsidence will commonly be most favourable to the accumulation of\r\n_conchiferous_ deposits, of sufficient thickness, extension, and\r\nhardness, to resist the average powers of denudation.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at an ancient tertiary epoch, fossiliferous deposits\r\nwere extensively deposited on the coasts of S. America; and it is a\r\nvery interesting fact, that there is evidence that these ancient\r\ntertiary beds were deposited during a period of subsidence. Thus, at\r\nNavidad, the strata are about eight hundred feet in thickness, and the\r\nfossil shells are abundant both at the level of the sea and some way up\r\nthe cliffs; having sent a list of these fossils to Professor E. Forbes,\r\nhe thinks they must have lived in water between one and ten fathoms in\r\ndepth: hence the bottom of the sea on which these shells once lived\r\nmust have subsided at least 700 feet to allow of the superincumbent\r\nmatter being deposited. I must here remark, that, as all these and the\r\nfollowing fossil shells are extinct species, Professor Forbes\r\nnecessarily judges of the depths at which they lived only from their\r\ngeneric character, and from the analogical distribution of shells in\r\nthe northern hemisphere; but there is no just cause from this to doubt\r\nthe general results. At Huafo the strata are about the same thickness,\r\nnamely, 800 feet, and Professor Forbes thinks the fossils found there\r\ncannot have lived at a greater depth than fifty fathoms, or 300 feet.\r\nThese two points, namely, Navidad and Huafo, are 570 miles apart, but\r\nnearly halfway between them lies Mocha, an island 1,200 feet in height,\r\napparently formed of tertiary strata up to its level summit, and with\r\nmany shells, including the same Turritella with that found at Huafo,\r\nembedded close to the level of the sea. In Patagonia, shells are\r\nnumerous at Santa Cruz, at the foot of the 350 feet plain, which has\r\ncertainly been formed by the denudation of the 840 feet plain, and\r\ntherefore was originally covered by strata that number of feet in\r\nthickness, and these shells, according to Professor Forbes, probably\r\nlived at a depth of between seven and fifteen fathoms: at Port S.\r\nJulian, sixty miles to the north, shells are numerous at the foot of\r\nthe ninety feet plain (formed by the denudation of the 950 feet plain),\r\nand likewise occasionally at the height of several hundred feet in the\r\nupper strata; these shells must have lived in water somewhere between\r\nfive and fifty fathoms in depth. Although in other parts of Patagonia I\r\nhave no direct evidence of shoal-water shells having been buried under\r\na great thickness of superincumbent submarine strata, yet it should be\r\nborne in mind that the lower fossiliferous strata with several of the\r\nsame species of Mollusca, the\r\nupper tufaceous beds, and the high summit-plain, stretch for a\r\nconsiderable distance southward, and for hundreds of miles northward;\r\nseeing this uniformity of structure, I conceive it may be fairly\r\nconcluded that the subsidence by which the shells at Santa Cruz and S.\r\nJulian were carried down and covered up, was not confined to these two\r\npoints, but was co-extensive with a considerable portion of the\r\nPatagonian tertiary formation. In a succeeding chapter it will be seen,\r\nthat we are led to a similar conclusion with respect to the secondary\r\nfossiliferous strata of the Cordillera, namely, that they also were\r\ndeposited during a long-continued and great period of subsidence.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing reasoning, and from the facts just given, I think we\r\nmust admit the probability of the following proposition: namely, that\r\nwhen the bed of the sea is either stationary or rising, circumstances\r\nare far less favourable, than when the level is sinking, to the\r\naccumulation of _conchiferous_ deposits of sufficient thickness and\r\nextension to resist, when upheaved, the average vast amount of\r\ndenudation. This result appears to me, in several respects, very\r\ninteresting: every one is at first inclined to believe that at\r\ninnumerable points, wherever there is a supply of sediment,\r\nfossiliferous strata are now forming, which at some future distant\r\nepoch will be upheaved and preserved; but on the views above given, we\r\nmust conclude that this is far from being the case; on the contrary, we\r\nrequire (1st), a long-continued supply of sediment; (2nd), an extensive\r\nshallow area; and (3rd), that this area shall slowly subside to a great\r\ndepth, so as to admit the accumulation of a widely extended thick mass\r\nof superincumbent strata. In how few parts of the world, probably, do\r\nthese conditions at the present day concur! We can thus, also,\r\nunderstand the general want of that close sequence in fossiliferous\r\nformations which we might theoretically have anticipated; for, without\r\nwe suppose a subsiding movement to go on at the same spot during an\r\nenormous period, from one geological era to another, and during the\r\nwhole of this period sediment to accumulate at the proper rate, so that\r\nthe depth should not become too great for the continued existence of\r\nmolluscous animals, it is scarcely possible that there should be a\r\nperfect sequence at the same spot in the fossil shells of the two\r\ngeological formations.[14] So far from a very long-continued subsidence\r\nbeing probable, many facts lead to the belief that the earth’s surface\r\noscillates up and down; and we have seen that during the elevatory\r\nmovements there is but a small chance of _durable_ fossiliferous\r\ndeposits accumulating.\r\n\r\n [14] Professor H. D. Rogers, in his excellent address to the\r\n Association of American Geologists (_Silliman’s Journal,_ vol. xlvii,\r\n p. 277) makes the following remark: “I question if we are at all aware\r\n how _completely_ the whole history of all departed time lies indelibly\r\n recorded with the amplest minuteness of detail in the successive\r\n sediments of the globe, how effectually, in other words, every period\r\n of time _has written its own history_, carefully preserving every\r\n created form and every trace of action.” I think the correctness of\r\n such remarks is more than doubtful, even if we except (as I suppose he\r\n would) all those numerous organic forms which contain no hard parts.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, these same considerations appear to throw some light on the\r\nfact that certain periods appear to have been favourable to the\r\ndeposition, or at least to the preservation, of contemporaneous\r\nformations at very distant points. We have seen that in S. America an\r\nenormous area has been rising within the recent period; and in other\r\nquarters of the globe immense spaces appear to have risen\r\ncontemporaneously. From my examination of the coral-reefs of the great\r\noceans, I have been led to conclude that the bed of the sea has gone on\r\nslowly sinking within the present era, over truly vast areas: this,\r\nindeed, is in itself probable, from the simple fact of the rising areas\r\nhaving been so large. In South America we have distinct evidence that\r\nat nearly the same tertiary period, the bed of the sea off parts of the\r\ncoast of Chile and off Patagonia was sinking, though these regions are\r\nvery remote from each other. If, then, it holds good, as a general\r\nrule, that in the same quarter of the globe the earth’s crust tends to\r\nsink and rise contemporaneously over vast spaces, we can at once see,\r\nthat we have at distant points, at the same period, those very\r\nconditions which appear to be requisite for the accumulation of\r\nfossiliferous masses of sufficient extension, thickness, and hardness,\r\nto resist denudation, and consequently to last unto an epoch distant in\r\nfuturity.[15]\r\n\r\n [15] Professor Forbes has some admirable remarks on this subject, in\r\n his “Report on the Shells of the Ægean Sea.” In a letter to Mr.\r\n Maclaren (_Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,_ January 1843), I partially\r\n entered into this discussion, and endeavoured to show that it was\r\n highly improbable, that upraised atolls or barrier-reefs, though of\r\n great thickness, should, owing to their small extension or breadth, be\r\n preserved to a distant future period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI PLUTONIC AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS:—CLEAVAGE AND FOLIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil, Bahia, gneiss with disjointed metamorphosed dikes.—Strike of\r\nfoliation.—Rio de Janeiro, gneiss-granite, embedded fragment in,\r\ndecomposition of.—La Plata, metamorphic and old volcanic rocks of.—S.\r\nVentana.—Claystone porphyry formation of Patagonia; singular\r\nmetamorphic rocks; pseudo-dikes.—Falkland Islands, Palæozoic fossils\r\nof.—Tierra del Fuego, clay-slate formation, cretaceous fossils of;\r\ncleavage and foliation; form of land.—Chonos Archipelago, mica-schists,\r\nfoliation disturbed by granitic axis; dikes.—Chiloe.—Concepcion, dikes,\r\nsuccessive formation of.—Central and Northern Chile.—Concluding remarks\r\non cleavage and foliation.—Their close analogy and similar origin.\r\n—Stratification of metamorphic schists.—Foliation of intrusive\r\nrocks.—Relation of cleavage and foliation to the lines of tension\r\nduring metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic and plutonic formations of the several districts\r\nvisited by the _Beagle_ will be here chiefly treated of, but only such\r\ncases as appear to me new, or of some special interest, will be\r\ndescribed in detail; at the end of the chapter I will sum up all the\r\nfacts on cleavage and foliation,—to which I particularly attended.\r\n\r\n_Bahia, Brazil: lat. 13° south._—The prevailing rock is gneiss, often\r\npassing, by the disappearance of the quartz and mica, and by the\r\nfeldspar losing its red colour, into a brilliantly grey primitive\r\ngreenstone. Not unfrequently quartz and hornblende are arranged in\r\nlayers in almost amorphous feldspar. There is some fine-grained\r\nsyenitic granite, orbicularly marked by ferruginous lines, and\r\nweathering into vertical, cylindrical holes, almost touching each\r\nother. In the gneiss, concretions of granular feldspar and others of\r\ngarnets with mica occur. The gneiss is traversed by numerous dikes\r\ncomposed of black, finely crystallised, hornblendic rock, containing a\r\nlittle glassy feldspar and sometimes mica, and varying in thickness\r\nfrom mere threads to ten feet: these threads, which are often\r\ncurvilinear, could sometimes be traced running into the larger dikes.\r\nOne of these dikes was remarkable from having been in two or three\r\nplaces laterally disjointed, with unbroken gneiss interposed between\r\nthe broken ends, and in one part with a portion of the gneiss driven,\r\napparently whilst in a softened state, into its side or wall. In\r\nseveral neighbouring places, the gneiss included angular, well-defined,\r\nsometimes bent, masses of hornblende rock, quite like, except in being\r\nmore perfectly crystallised, that forming the dikes, and, at least in\r\none instance, containing (as determined by Professor Miller) augite as\r\nwell as hornblende. In one or two cases these angular masses, though\r\nnow quite separate from each other by the solid gneiss, had, from their\r\nexact correspondence in size and shape, evidently once been united;\r\nhence I cannot doubt that most or all of the fragments have been\r\nderived from the breaking up of the dikes, of which we see the first\r\nstage in the above-mentioned laterally disjointed one. The gneiss close\r\nto the fragments generally contained many large crystals of hornblende,\r\nwhich are entirely absent or rare in other parts: its folia or laminæ\r\nwere gently bent round the fragments, in the same manner as they\r\nsometimes are round concretions. Hence the gneiss has certainly been\r\nsoftened, its composition modified, and its folia arranged,\r\nsubsequently to the breaking up of the dikes,[1] these latter also\r\nhaving been at the same time bent and softened.\r\n\r\n [1] Professor Hitchcock (“Geology of Massachusetts,” vol. ii, p. 673,\r\n gives a closely similar case of a greenstone dike in syenite.\r\n\r\nI must here take the opportunity of premising, that by the term\r\n_cleavage_ I imply those planes of division which render a rock,\r\nappearing to the eye quite or nearly homogeneous, fissile. By the term\r\n_foliation_, I refer to the layers or plates of different mineralogical\r\nnature of which most metamorphic schists are composed; there are, also,\r\noften included in such masses, alternating, homogeneous, fissile layers\r\nor folia, and in this case the rock is both foliated and has a\r\ncleavage. By _ stratification_, as applied to these formations, I mean\r\nthose alternate, parallel, large masses of different composition, which\r\nare themselves frequently either foliated or fissile,—such as the\r\nalternating so-called strata of mica-slate, gneiss, glossy clay-slate,\r\nand marble.\r\n\r\nThe folia of the gneiss within a few miles round Bahia generally\r\nstrike irregularly, and are often curvilinear, dipping in all\r\ndirections at various angles: but where best defined, they extended\r\nmost frequently in a N.E. by N. (or East 50° N.) and S.W. by S. line,\r\ncorresponding nearly with the coast-line northwards of the bay. I may\r\nadd that Mr. Gardner[2] found in several parts of the province of\r\nCeara, which lies between four and five hundred miles north of Bahia,\r\ngneiss with the folia extending E. 45° N.; and in Guyana according to\r\nSir R. Schomburgk, the same rock strikes E. 57° N. Again, Humboldt\r\ndescribes the gneiss-granite over an immense area in Venezuela and even\r\nin Colombia, as striking E. 50° N., and dipping to the N.W. at an angle\r\nof fifty degrees. Hence all the observations hitherto made tend to show\r\nthat the gneissic rocks over the whole of this part of the continent\r\nhave their folia extending generally within almost a point of the\r\ncompass of the same direction.[3]\r\n\r\n [2] “Geological Section of the Brit. Assoc.,” 1840. For Sir R.\r\n Schomburgk’s observations see _Geograph. Journal,_ 1842, p. 190. See\r\n also Humboldt’s discussion on Loxodrism in the “Personal Narrative.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I landed at only one place north of Bahia, namely, at Pernambuco.\r\n I found there only soft, horizontally stratified matter, formed from\r\n disintegrated granitic rocks, and some yellowish impure limestone,\r\n probably of a tertiary epoch. I have described a most singular natural\r\n bar of hard sandstone, which protects the harbour, in the 19th vol.\r\n (1841) p. 258 of the _ London and Edin. Phil. Magazine._\r\n    ABROLHOS ISLETS, _lat. 18° S. off the coast of Brazil._—Although\r\n    not strictly in place, I do not know where I can more conveniently\r\n    describe this little group of small islands. The lowest bed is a\r\n    sandstone with ferruginous veins; it weathers into an extraordinary\r\n    honeycombed mass; above it there is a dark-coloured argillaceous\r\n    shale; above this a coarser sandstone—making a total thickness of\r\n    about sixty feet; and lastly, above these sedimentary beds, there\r\n    is a fine conformable mass of greenstone, in some parts having a\r\n    columnar structure. All the strata, as well as the surface of the\r\n    land, dip at an angle of about 12° to N. by W. Some of the islets\r\n    are composed entirely of the sedimentary, others of the trappean\r\n    rocks, generally, however, with the sandstone, cropping out on the\r\n    southern shores.\r\n\r\n_Rio de Janeiro._—This whole district is almost exclusively formed of\r\ngneiss, abounding with garnets, and porphyritic with large crystals,\r\neven three and four inches in length, of orthoclase feldspar: in these\r\ncrystals mica and garnets are often enclosed. At the western base of\r\nthe Corcovado, there is some ferruginous carious quartz-rock; and in\r\nthe Tijeuka range, much fine-grained granite. I observed boulders of\r\ngreenstone in several places; and on the islet of Villegagnon, and\r\nlikewise on the coast some miles northward, two large trappean dikes.\r\nThe porphyritic gneiss, or gneiss-granite as it has been called by\r\nHumboldt, is only so far foliated that the constituent minerals are\r\narranged with a certain degree of regularity, and may be said to have a\r\n“_grain_,” but they are not separated into distinct folia or laminæ.\r\nThere are, however, several other varieties of gneiss regularly\r\nfoliated, and alternating with each other in so-called strata. The\r\nstratification and foliation of the ordinary gneisses, and the\r\nfoliation or “grain” of the gneiss-granite, are parallel to each other,\r\nand generally strike within\r\na point of N.E. and S.W. dipping at a high angle (between 50° and 60°)\r\ngenerally to S.E.: so that here again we meet with the strike so\r\nprevalent over the more northern parts of this continent. The mountains\r\nof gneiss-granite are to a remarkable degree abruptly conical, which\r\nseems caused by the rock tending to exfoliate in thick, conically\r\nconcentric layers: these peaks resemble in shape those of phonolite and\r\nother injected rocks on volcanic islands; nor is the grain or foliation\r\n(as we shall afterwards see) any difficulty on the idea of the\r\ngneiss-granite having been an intrusive rather than a metamorphic\r\nformation. The lines of mountains, but not always each separate hill,\r\nrange nearly in the same direction with the foliation and so-called\r\nstratification, but rather more easterly.\r\n\r\nNo. 22\r\nFragment of gneiss embedded in another variety of the same rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fragment of gneiss embedded in another variety of the\r\nsame rock.]\r\n\r\nOn a bare gently inclined surface of the porphyritic gneiss in Botofogo\r\nBay, I observed the appearance here represented.\r\n\r\nA fragment seven yards long and two in width, with angular and\r\ndistinctly defined edges, composed of a peculiar variety of gneiss with\r\ndark layers of mica and garnets, is surrounded on all sides by the\r\nordinary gneiss-granite; both having been dislocated by a granitic\r\nvein. The folia in the fragment and in the surrounding rock strike in\r\nthe same N.N.E. and S.S.W. line; but in the fragment they are vertical,\r\nwhereas in the gneiss-granite they dip at a small angle, as shown by\r\nthe arrows, to S.S.E. This fragment, considering its great size, its\r\nsolitary position, and its foliated structure parallel to that of the\r\nsurrounding rock, is, as far as I know, a unique case: and I will not\r\nattempt any explanation of its origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numerous travellers[4] in this country, have all been greatly\r\nsurprised at the depth to which the gneiss and other granitic rocks, as\r\nwell as the talcose slates of the interior, have been decomposed. Near\r\nRio, every mineral except the quartz has been completely softened, in\r\nsome places to a depth little less than one hundred feet.[5] The\r\nminerals retain their positions in folia ranging in the usual\r\ndirection; and fractured quartz veins may be traced from the solid\r\nrock, running for some distance into the softened, mottled, highly\r\ncoloured, argillaceous mass. It is said that these decomposed rocks\r\nabound with gems of various kinds, often in a fractured state, owing,\r\nas some have supposed, to the collapse of geodes, and that they contain\r\ngold and diamonds. At Rio, it appeared to me that the gneiss had been\r\nsoftened before the excavation (no doubt by the sea) of the existing,\r\nbroad, flat-bottomed valleys; for the depth of decomposition did not\r\nappear at all conformable with the present undulations of the surface.\r\nThe porphyritic gneiss, where now exposed to the air, seems to\r\nwithstand decomposition remarkably well; and I could see no signs of\r\nany tendency to the production of argillaceous masses like those here\r\ndescribed. I was also struck with the fact, that where a bare surface\r\nof this rock sloped into one of the quiet bays, there were no marks of\r\nerosion at the level of the water, and the parts both beneath and above\r\nit preserved a uniform curve. At Bahia, the gneiss rocks are similarly\r\ndecomposed, with the upper parts insensibly losing their foliation, and\r\npassing, without any distinct line of separation, into a bright red\r\nargillaceous earth, including partially rounded fragments of quartz and\r\ngranite. From this circumstance, and from the rocks appearing to have\r\nsuffered decomposition before the excavation of the valleys, I suspect\r\nthat here, as at Rio, the decomposition took place under the sea. The\r\nsubject appeared to me a curious one, and would probably well repay\r\ncareful examination by an able mineralogist.\r\n\r\n [4] Spix and Martius have collected in an Appendix to their “Travels,”\r\n the largest body of facts on this subject. See also some remarks by M.\r\n Lund in his communications to the Academy at Copenhagen; and others by\r\n M. Gaudichaud in Freycinet’s “Voyage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] Dr. Benza describes granitic rock (_Madras Journal of Lit.,_ etc.,\r\n Oct. 183? p. 246), in the Neelgherries, decomposed to a depth of forty\r\n feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Northern Provinces of La Plata._—According to some observations\r\ncommunicated to me by Mr. Fox, the coast from Rio de Janeiro to the\r\nmouth of the Plata seems everywhere to be granitic, with a few trappean\r\ndikes. At Port Alegre, near the boundary of Brazil, there are\r\nporphyries and diorites.[6] At the mouth of the Plata, I examined the\r\ncountry for twenty-five miles west, and for about seventy miles north\r\nof Maldonado: near this town, there is some common gneiss, and much, in\r\nall parts of the country, of a coarse-grained mixture of quartz and\r\nreddish feldspar, often, however, assuming a little dark-green\r\nimperfect hornblende, and then immediately becoming foliated. The\r\nabrupt hillocks thus composed, as well as the highly inclined folia of\r\nthe\r\ncommon varieties of gneiss, strike N.N.E. or a little more easterly,\r\nand S.S.W. Clay-slate is occasionally met with, and near the L. del\r\nPotrero, there is white marble, rendered fissile from the presence of\r\nhornblende, mica, and asbestus; the cleavage of these rocks and their\r\nstratification, that is the alternating masses thus composed, strike\r\nN.N.E. and S.S.W. like the foliated gneisses, and have an almost\r\nvertical dip. The Sierra Larga, a low range five miles west of\r\nMaldonado, consists of quartzite, often ferruginous, having an\r\narenaceous feel, and divided into excessively thin, almost vertical\r\nlaminæ or folia by microscopically minute scales, apparently of mica,\r\nand striking in the usual N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. The range itself\r\nis formed of one principal line with some subordinate ones; and it\r\nextends with remarkable uniformity far northward (it is said even to\r\nthe confines of Brazil), in the same line with the vertically ribboned\r\nquartz rock of which it is composed. The S. de Las Animas is the\r\nhighest range in the country; I estimated it at 1,000 feet; it runs\r\nnorth and south, and is formed of feldspathic porphyry; near its base\r\nthere is a N.N.W. and S.S.E. ridge of a conglomerate in a highly\r\nporphyritic basis.\r\n\r\n [6] M. Isabelle, “Voyage à Buenos Ayres,” p. 479.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Maldonado, and south of Las Minas, there is an E. and W.\r\nhilly band of country, some miles in width, formed of siliceous\r\nclay-slate, with some quartz, rock, and limestone, having a tortuous\r\nirregular cleavage, generally ranging east and west. E. and S.E. of Las\r\nMinas there is a confused district of imperfect gneiss and laminated\r\nquartz, with the hills ranging in various directions, but with each\r\nseparate hill generally running in the same line with the folia of the\r\nrocks of which it is composed: this confusion appears to have been\r\ncaused by the intersection of the [E. and W.] and [N.N.E. and S.S.W.]\r\nstrikes. Northward of Las Minas, the more regular northerly ranges\r\npredominate: from this place to near Polanco, we meet with the\r\ncoarse-grained mixture of quartz and feldspar, often with the imperfect\r\nhornblende, and then becoming foliated in a N. and S. line—with\r\nimperfect clay-slate, including laminæ of red crystallised\r\nfeldspar—with white or black marble, sometimes containing asbestus and\r\ncrystals of gypsum—with quartz-rock—with syenite—and lastly, with much\r\ngranite. The marble and granite alternate repeatedly in apparently\r\nvertical masses: some miles northward of the Polanco, a wide district\r\nis said to be entirely composed of marble. It is remarkable, how rare\r\nmica is in the whole range of country north and westward of Maldonado.\r\nThroughout this district, the cleavage of the clay-slate and marble—the\r\nfoliation of the gneiss and the quartz—the stratification or\r\nalternating masses of these several rocks—and the range of the hills,\r\nall coincide in direction; and although the country is only hilly, the\r\nplanes of division are almost everywhere very highly inclined or\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\nSome ancient submarine volcanic rocks are worth mentioning, from their\r\nrarity on this eastern side of the continent. In the valley of the\r\nTapas (fifty or sixty miles N. of Maldonado) there is a tract three or\r\nfour miles in length, composed of various trappean rocks with glassy\r\nfeldspar—of apparently metamorphosed grit-stones—of purplish\r\namygdaloids with large kernels of carbonate of lime[7]—and much of a\r\nharshish rock with glassy feldspar intermediate in character between\r\nclaystone porphyry and trachyte. This latter rock was in one spot\r\nremarkable from being full of drusy cavities, lined with quartz\r\ncrystals, and arranged in planes, dipping at an angle of 50° to the\r\neast, and striking parallel to the foliation of an adjoining hill\r\ncomposed of the common mixture of quartz, feldspar, and imperfect\r\nhornblende: this fact perhaps indicates that these volcanic rocks have\r\nbeen metamorphosed, and their constituent parts rearranged, at the same\r\ntime and according to the same laws, with the granitic and metamorphic\r\nformations of this whole region. In the valley of the Marmaraya, a few\r\nmiles south of the Tapas, a band of trappean and amygdaloidal rock is\r\ninterposed between a hill of granite and an extensive surrounding\r\nformation of red conglomerate, which (like that at the foot of the S.\r\nAnimas) has its basis porphyritic with crystals of feldspar, and which\r\nhence has certainly suffered metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n [7] Near the Pan de Azucar there is some greenish porphyry, in one\r\n place amygdaloidal with agate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monte Video._—The rocks here consist of several varieties of gneiss,\r\nwith the feldspar often yellowish, granular and imperfectly\r\ncrystallised, alternating with, and passing insensibly into, beds, from\r\na few yards to nearly a mile in thickness, of fine or coarse grained,\r\ndark-green hornblendic slate; this again often passing into chloritic\r\nschist. These passages seem chiefly due to changes in the mica, and its\r\nreplacement by other minerals. At Rat Island I examined a mass of\r\nchloritic schist, only a few yards square, irregularly surrounded on\r\nall sides by the gneiss, and intricately penetrated by many curvilinear\r\nveins of quartz, which gradually _blend_ into the gneiss: the cleavage\r\nof the chloritic schist and the foliation of the gneiss were exactly\r\nparallel. Eastward of the city there is much fine-grained,\r\ndark-coloured gneiss, almost assuming the character of\r\nhornblende-slate, which alternates in thin laminæ with laminæ of\r\nquartz, the whole mass being transversely intersected by numerous large\r\nveins of quartz: I particularly observed that these veins were\r\nabsolutely continuous with the alternating laminæ of quartz. In this\r\ncase and at Rat Island, the passage of the gneiss into imperfect\r\nhornblendic or into chloritic slate, seemed to be connected with the\r\nsegregation of the veins of quartz.[8]\r\n\r\n [8] Mr. Greenough (p. 78, “Critical Examination,” etc.) observes that\r\n quartz in mica-slate sometimes appears in beds and sometimes in veins.\r\n Von Buch also in his “Travels in Norway” (p. 236), remarks on\r\n alternating laminæ of quartz and hornblende-slate replacing\r\n mica-schist.\r\n\r\nThe Mount, a hill believed to be 450 feet in height, from which the\r\nplace takes its name, is much the highest land in this neighbourhood:\r\nit consists of hornblendic slate, which (except on the eastern and\r\ndisturbed base) has an east and west nearly vertical cleavage; the\r\nlonger axis of the hill also ranges in this same line. Near the summit\r\nthe hornblende-slate gradually becomes more and more coarsely\r\ncrystallised, and less plainly laminated, until it passes into a heavy,\r\nsonorous greenstone, with a slaty conchoidal fracture; the laminæ on\r\nthe north\r\nand south sides near the summit dip inwards, as if this upper part had\r\nexpanded or bulged outwards. This greenstone must, I conceive, be\r\nconsidered as metamorphosed hornblende-slate. The Cerrito, the next\r\nhighest, but much less elevated point, is almost similarly composed. In\r\nthe more western parts of the province, besides gneiss, there is\r\nquartz-rock, syenite, and granite; and at Colla, I heard of marble.\r\n\r\nNear M. Video, the space which I more accurately examined was about\r\nfifteen miles in an east and west line, and here I found the foliation\r\nof the gneiss and the cleavage of the slates generally well developed,\r\nand extending parallel to the alternating strata composed of the\r\ngneiss, hornblendic and chloritic schists. These planes of division all\r\nrange within one point of east and west, frequently east by south and\r\nwest by north; their dip is generally almost vertical, and scarcely\r\nanywhere under 45°: this fact, considering how slightly undulatory the\r\nsurface of the country is, deserves attention. Westward of M. Video,\r\ntowards the Uruguay, wherever the gneiss is exposed, the highly\r\ninclined folia are seen striking in the same direction; I must except\r\none spot where the strike was N.W. by W. The little Sierra de S. Juan,\r\nformed of gneiss and laminated quartz, must also be excepted, for it\r\nranges between [N. to N.E.] and [S. to S.W.] and seems to belong to the\r\nsame system with the hills in the Maldonado district. Finally, we have\r\nseen that, for many miles northward of Maldonado and for twenty-five\r\nmiles westward of it, as far as the S. de las Animas, the foliation,\r\ncleavage, so-called stratification and lines of hills, all range N.N.E.\r\nand S.S.W., which is nearly coincident with the adjoining coast of the\r\nAtlantic. Westward of the S. de las Animas, as far as even the Uruguay,\r\nthe foliation, cleavage, and stratification (but not lines of hills,\r\nfor there are no defined ones) all range about E. by S. and W. by N.,\r\nwhich is nearly coincident with the direction of the northern shore of\r\nthe Plata; in the confused country near Las Minas, where these two\r\ngreat systems appear to intersect each other, the cleavage, foliation,\r\nand stratification run in various directions, but generally coincide\r\nwith the line of each separate hill.\r\n\r\n_Southern La Plata._—The first ridge, south of the Plata, which\r\nprojects through the Pampean formation, is the Sierra Tapalguen and\r\nVulcan, situated 200 miles southward of the district just described.\r\nThis ridge is only a few hundred feet in height, and runs from C.\r\nCorrientes in a W.N.W. line for at least 150 miles into the interior:\r\nat Tapalguen, it is composed of unstratified granular quartz,\r\nremarkable from forming tabular masses and small plains, surrounded by\r\nprecipitous cliffs: other parts of the range are said to consist of\r\ngranite: and marble is found at the S. Tinta. It appears from M.\r\nParchappe’s[9] observations, that at Tandil there is a range of\r\nquartzose gneiss, very like the rocks of the S. Larga near Maldonado,\r\nrunning in the same N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction; so that the framework\r\nof the country here is very similar to that on the northern shore of\r\nthe Plata.\r\n\r\n [9] M. d’Orbigny’s “Voyage,” Part. Géolog., p. 46. I have given a\r\n short account of the peculiar forms of the quartz hills of Tapalguen,\r\n so unusual in a metamorphic formation, in my “Journal of Researches”\r\n (2nd edit.), p. 116.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Guitru-gueyu is situated sixty miles south of the S.\r\nTapalguen: it consists of numerous parallel, sometimes blended together\r\nridges, about twenty-three miles in width, and five hundred feet in\r\nheight above the plain, and extending in a N.W. and S.E. direction.\r\nSkirting round the extreme S.E. termination, I ascended only a few\r\npoints, which were composed of a fine-grained gneiss, almost composed\r\nof feldspar with a little mica, and passing in the upper parts of the\r\nhills into a rather compact purplish clay-slate. The cleavage was\r\nnearly vertical, striking in a N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. line, nearly,\r\nthough not quite, coincident with the direction of the parallel ridges.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Ventana lies close south of that of Guitru-gueyu; it is\r\nremarkable from attaining a height, very unusual on this side of the\r\ncontinent, of 3,340 feet. It consists up to its summit, of quartz,\r\ngenerally pure and white, but sometimes reddish, and divided into thick\r\nlaminæ or strata: in one part there is a little glossy clay-slate with\r\na tortuous cleavage. The thick layers of quartz strike in a W. 30° N.\r\nline, dipping southerly at an angle of 45° and upwards. The principal\r\nline of mountains, with some quite subordinate parallel ridges, range\r\nabout W. 45° N.: but at their S.E. termination, only W. 25° N. This\r\nSierra is said to extend between twenty and thirty leagues into the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n_Patagonia._—With the exception perhaps of the hill of S. Antonio (600\r\nfeet high) in the Gulf of S. Matias, which has never been visited by a\r\ngeologist, crystalline rocks are not met with on the coast of Patagonia\r\nfor a space of 380 miles south of the S. Ventana. At this point (lat.\r\n43° 50′), at Points Union and Tombo, plutonic rocks are said to appear,\r\nand are found, at rather wide intervals, beneath the Patagonian\r\ntertiary formation for a space of about three hundred miles southward,\r\nto near Bird Island, in latitude 48° 56′. Judging from specimens kindly\r\ncollected for me by Mr. Stokes, the prevailing rock at Ports St. Elena,\r\nCamerones, Malaspina, and as far south as the Paps of Pineda, is a\r\npurplish-pink or brownish claystone porphyry, sometimes laminated,\r\nsometimes slightly vesicular, with crystals of opaque feldspar and with\r\na few grains of quartz; hence these porphyries resemble those\r\nimmediately to be described at Port Desire, and likewise a series which\r\nI have seen from P. Alegre on the southern confines of Brazil. This\r\nporphyritic formation further resembles in a singularly close manner\r\nthe lowest stratified formation of the Cordillera of Chile, which, as\r\nwe shall hereafter see, has a vast range, and attains a great\r\nthickness. At the bottom of the Gulf of St. George, only tertiary\r\ndeposits appear to be present. At Cape Blanco, there is quartz rock,\r\nvery like that of the Falkland Islands, and some hard, blue siliceous\r\nclay-slate.\r\n\r\nAt Port Desire there is an extensive formation of the claystone\r\nporphyry, stretching at least twenty-five miles into the interior: it\r\nhas been denuded and deeply worn into gullies before being covered up\r\nby the tertiary deposits, through which it here and there projects in\r\nhills; those north of the bay being 440 feet in height. The strata have\r\nin several places been tilted at small angles, generally either to\r\nN.N.W. or S.S.E. By gradual passages and alternations, the porphyries\r\nchange incessantly in nature. I will describe only some of the\r\nprincipal\r\nmineralogical changes, which are highly instructive, and which I\r\ncarefully examined. The prevailing rock has a compact purplish base,\r\nwith crystals of earthy or opaque feldspar, and often with grains of\r\nquartz. There are other varieties, with an almost truly trachytic base,\r\nfull of little angular vesicles and crystals of glassy feldspar; and\r\nthere are beds of black perfect pitchstone, as well as of a\r\nconcretionary imperfect variety. On a casual inspection, the whole\r\nseries would be thought to be of the same plutonic or volcanic nature\r\nwith the trachytic varieties and pitchstone; but this is far from being\r\nthe case, as much of the porphyry is certainly of metamorphic origin.\r\nBesides the true porphyries, there are many beds of earthy, quite white\r\nor yellowish, friable, easily fusible matter, resembling chalk, which\r\nunder the microscope is seen to consist of minute broken crystals, and\r\nwhich, as remarked in a former chapter, singularly resembles the upper\r\ntufaceous beds of the Patagonian tertiary formation. This earthy\r\nsubstance often becomes coarser, and contains minute rounded fragments\r\nof porphyries and rounded grains of quartz, and in one case so many of\r\nthe latter as to resemble a common sandstone. These beds are sometimes\r\nmarked with true lines of aqueous deposition, separating particles of\r\ndifferent degrees of coarseness; in other cases there are parallel\r\nferruginous lines not of true deposition, as shown by the arrangement\r\nof the particles, though singularly resembling them. The more indurated\r\nvarieties often include many small and some larger angular cavities,\r\nwhich appear due to the removal of earthy matter: some varieties\r\ncontain mica. All these earthy and generally white stones insensibly\r\npass into more indurated sonorous varieties, breaking with a conchoidal\r\nfracture, yet of small specific gravity; many of these latter varieties\r\nassume a pale purple tint, being singularly banded and veined with\r\ndifferent shades, and often become plainly porphyritic with crystals of\r\nfeldspar. The formation of these crystals could be most clearly traced\r\nby minute angular and often partially hollow patches of earthy matter,\r\nfirst assuming a _fibrous structure_, then passing into opaque\r\nimperfectly shaped crystals, and lastly, into perfect glassy crystals.\r\nWhen these crystals have appeared, and when the basis has become\r\ncompact, the rock in many places could not be distinguished from a true\r\nclaystone porphyry without a trace of mechanical structure.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, these earthy or tufaceous beds pass into jaspery and\r\ninto beautifully mottled and banded porcelain rocks, which break into\r\nsplinters, translucent at their edges, hard enough to scratch glass,\r\nand fusible into white transparent beads: grains of quartz included in\r\nthe porcelainous varieties can be seen melting into the surrounding\r\npaste. In other parts, the earthy or tufaceous beds either insensibly\r\npass into, or alternate with, breccias composed of large and small\r\nfragments of various purplish porphyries, with the matrix generally\r\nporphyritic: these breccias, though their subaqueous origin is in many\r\nplaces shown both by the arrangement of their smaller particles and by\r\nan oblique or current lamination, also pass into porphyries, in which\r\nevery trace of mechanical origin and stratification has been\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nSome highly porphyritic though coarse-grained masses, evidently\r\nof sedimentary origin, and divided into thin layers, differing from\r\neach other chiefly in the number of embedded grains of quartz,\r\ninterested me much from the peculiar manner in which here and there\r\nsome of the layers terminated in abrupt points, quite unlike those\r\nproduced by a layer of sediment naturally thinning out, and apparently\r\nthe result of a subsequent process of metamorphic aggregation. In\r\nanother common variety of a finer texture, the aggregating process had\r\ngone further, for the whole mass consisted of quite short, parallel,\r\noften slightly curved layers or patches, of whitish or reddish finely\r\ngranulo-crystalline feldspathic matter, generally terminating at both\r\nends in blunt points; these layers or patches further tended to pass\r\ninto wedge or almond-shaped little masses, and these finally into true\r\ncrystals of feldspar, with their centres often slightly drusy. The\r\nseries was so perfect that I could not doubt that these large crystals,\r\nwhich had their longer axes placed parallel to each other, had\r\nprimarily originated in the metamorphosis and aggregation of\r\nalternating layers of tuff; and hence their parallel position must be\r\nattributed (unexpected though the conclusion may be), not to laws of\r\nchemical action, but to the original planes of deposition. I am tempted\r\nbriefly to describe three other singular allied varieties of rock; the\r\nfirst without examination would have passed for a stratified\r\nporphyritic breccia, but all the included angular fragments consisted\r\nof a border of pinkish crystalline feldspathic matter, surrounding a\r\ndark translucent siliceous centre, in which grains of quartz not quite\r\nblended into the paste could be distinguished: this uniformity in the\r\nnature of the fragments shows that they are not of mechanical, but of\r\nconcretionary origin, having resulted perhaps from the self-breaking up\r\nand aggregation of layers of indurated tuff containing numerous grains\r\nof quartz,—into which, indeed, the whole mass in one part passed. The\r\nsecond variety is a reddish non-porphyritic claystone, quite full of\r\nspherical cavities, about half an inch in diameter, each lined with a\r\ncollapsed crust formed of crystals of quartz. The third variety also\r\nconsists of a pale purple non-porphyritic claystone, almost wholly\r\nformed of concretionary balls, obscurely arranged in layers, of a less\r\ncompact and paler coloured claystone; each ball being on one side\r\npartly hollow and lined with crystals of quartz.\r\n\r\n_Pseudo-dikes._—Some miles up the harbour, in a line of cliffs formed\r\nof slightly metamorphosed tufaceous and porphyritic claystone beds, I\r\nobserved three vertical dikes, so closely resembling in general\r\nappearance ordinary volcanic dikes, that I did not doubt, until closely\r\nexamining their composition, that they had been injected from below.\r\nThe first is straight, with parallel sides, and about four feet wide;\r\nit consists of whitish, indurated tufaceous matter, precisely like some\r\nof the beds intersected by it. The second dike is more remarkable; it\r\nis slightly tortuous, about eighteen inches thick, and can be traced\r\nfor a considerable distance along the beach; it is of a purplish-red or\r\nbrown colour, and is formed chiefly of _ rounded_ grains of quartz,\r\nwith broken crystals of earthy feldspar, scales of black mica, and\r\nminute fragments of claystone porphyry, all firmly united together in a\r\nhard sparing base. The structure of this dike shows obviously that it\r\nis of mechanical and\r\nsedimentary origin; yet it thinned out upwards, and did not cut through\r\nthe uppermost strata in the cliffs. This fact at first appears to\r\nindicate that the matter could not have been washed in from above;[10]\r\nbut if we reflect on the suction which would result from a deep-seated\r\nfissure being formed, we may admit that if the fissure were in any part\r\nopen to the surface, mud and water might well be drawn into it along\r\nits whole course. The third dike consisted of a hard, rough, white\r\nrock, almost composed of broken crystals of glassy feldspar, with\r\nnumerous scales of black mica, cemented in a scanty base; there was\r\nlittle in the appearance of this rock, to preclude the idea of its\r\nhaving been a true injected feldspathic dike. The matter composing\r\nthese three pseudo-dikes, especially the second one, appears to have\r\nsuffered, like the surrounding strata, a certain degree of metamorphic\r\naction; and this has much aided the deceptive appearance. At Bahia, in\r\nBrazil, we have seen that a true injected hornblendic dike, not only\r\nhas suffered metamorphosis, but has been dislocated and even diffused\r\nin the surrounding gneiss, under the form of separate crystals and of\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n [10] Upfilled fissures are known to occur both in volcanic and in\r\n ordinary sedimentary formations. At the Galapagos Archipelago\r\n (“Volcanic Islands” etc.), there are some striking examples of\r\n pseudo-dikes composed of hard tuff.\r\n\r\n_Falkland Islands._—I have described these islands in a paper published\r\nin the third volume of the _Geological Journal._ The mountain-ridges\r\nconsist of quartz, and the lower country of clay-slate and sandstone,\r\nthe latter containing Palæozoic fossils. These fossils have been\r\nseparately described by Messrs. Morris and Sharpe: some of them\r\nresemble Silurian, and others Devonian forms. In the eastern part of\r\nthe group the several parallel ridges of quartz extend in a west and\r\neast line; but further westward the line becomes W.N.W. and E.S.E., and\r\neven still more northerly. The cleavage-planes of the clay-slate are\r\nhighly inclined, generally at an angle of above 50°, and often\r\nvertical; they strike almost invariably in the same direction with the\r\nquartz ranges. The outline of the indented shores of the two main\r\nislands, and the relative positions of the smaller islets, accord with\r\nthe strike both of the main axes of elevation and of the cleavage of\r\nthe clay-slate.\r\n\r\n_Tierra del Fuego._—My notes on the geology of this country are\r\ncopious, but as they are unimportant, and as fossils were found only in\r\none district, a brief sketch will be here sufficient. The east coast\r\nfrom the S. of Magellan (where the boulder formation is largely\r\ndeveloped) to St. Polycarp’s Bay is formed of horizontal tertiary\r\nstrata, bounded some way towards the interior by a broad mountainous\r\nband of clay-slate. This great clay-slate formation extends from St. Le\r\nMaire westward for 140 miles, along both sides of the Beagle Channel to\r\nnear its bifurcation. South of this channel, it forms all Navarin\r\nIsland, and the eastern half of Hoste Island and of Hardy Peninsula;\r\nnorth of the Beagle Channel it extends in a north-west line on both\r\nsides of Admiralty Sound to Brunswick Peninsula in the St. of Magellan,\r\nand I have reason to believe, stretches far up the eastern\r\nside of the Cordillera. The western and broken side of Tierra del Fuego\r\ntowards the Pacific is formed of metamorphic schists, granite and\r\nvarious trappean rocks: the line of separation between the crystalline\r\nand clay-slate formations can generally be distinguished, as remarked\r\nby Captain King,[11] by the parallelism in the clay-slate districts of\r\nthe shores and channels, ranging in a line between [W. 20° to 40° N.]\r\nand [E. 20° to 40° S.].\r\n\r\n [11] _Geographical Journal,_ vol. i, p. 155.\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate is generally fissile, sometimes siliceous or\r\nferruginous, with veins of quartz and calcareous spar; it often\r\nassumes, especially on the loftier mountains, an altered feldspathic\r\ncharacter, passing into feldspathic porphyry: occasionally it is\r\nassociated with breccia and grauwacke. At Good Success Bay, there is a\r\nlittle intercalated black crystalline limestone. At Port Famine much of\r\nthe clay-slate is calcareous, and passes either into a mudstone or into\r\ngrauwacke, including odd-shaped concretions of dark argillaceous\r\nlimestone. Here alone, on the shore a few miles north of Port Famine,\r\nand on the summit of Mount Tarn (2,600 feet high), I found organic\r\nremains; they consist of:—\r\n\r\nAncyloceras simplex, d’Orbigny, “Pal Franc,” Mount Tarn.\r\n\r\nFusus (in imperfect state), d’Orbigny, “Pal Franc,” Mount Tarn.\r\n\r\nNatica, d’Orbigny, “Pal Franc,” Mount Tarn.\r\n\r\nPentacrimus, d’Orbigny, “Pal Franc,” Mount Tarn.\r\n\r\nLucina excentrica, G. B. Sowerby, Port Famine.\r\n\r\nVenus (in imperfect state), G. B. Sowerby, Port Famine.\r\n\r\nTurbinolia (?), G. B. Sowerby, Port Famine.\r\n\r\nHamites elatior, G. B. Sowerby, Port Famine.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. d’Orbigny states[12] that MM. Hombron and Grange found in this\r\nneighbourhood an Ancyloceras, perhaps _A. simplex_, an Ammonite, a\r\nPlicatula and Modiola. M. d’Orbigny believes from the general character\r\nof these fossils, and from the Ancyloceras being identical (as far as\r\nits imperfect condition allows of comparison) with the _A. simplex_ of\r\nEurope, that the formation belongs to an early stage of the Cretaceous\r\nsystem. Professor E. Forbes, judging only from my specimens, concurs in\r\nthe probability of this conclusion. The _Hamites elatior_ of the above\r\nlist, of which a description has been given by Mr. Sowerby, and which\r\nis remarkable from its large size, has not been seen either by M.\r\nd’Orbigny or Professor E. Forbes, as, since my return to England, the\r\nspecimens have been lost. The great clay-slate formation of Tierra del\r\nFuego being cretaceous, is certainly a very interesting fact,—whether\r\nwe consider the appearance of the country, which, without the evidence\r\nafforded by the fossils, would form the analogy of most known\r\ndistricts, probably have been considered as belonging to the Palæozoic\r\nseries,—or whether we view it as showing that the age of this terminal\r\nportion of the great axis of South America, is the same (as will\r\nhereafter be seen) with the Cordillera of Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\n [12] “Voyage,” Part Géolog., p. 242.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate in many parts of Tierra del Fuego, is broken by\r\ndikes[13] and by great masses of greenstone, often highly hornblendic:\r\nalmost all the small islets within the clay-slate districts are thus\r\ncomposed. The slate near the dikes generally becomes paler-coloured,\r\nharder, less fissile, of a feldspathic nature, and passes into a\r\nporphyry or greenstone: in one case, however, it became more fissile,\r\nof a red colour, and contained minute scales of mica, which were absent\r\nin the unaltered rock. On the east side of Ponsonby Sound some dikes\r\ncomposed of a pale sonorous feldspathic rock, porphyritic with a little\r\nfeldspar, were remarkable from their number,—there being within the\r\nspace of a mile at least one hundred,—from their nearly equalling in\r\nbulk the intermediate slate,—and more especially from the excessive\r\nfineness (like the finest inlaid carpentry) and perfect parallelism of\r\ntheir junctions with the almost vertical laminæ of clay-slate. I was\r\nunable to persuade myself that these great parallel masses had been\r\ninjected, until I found one dike which abruptly thinned out to half its\r\nthickness, and had one of its walls jagged, with fragments of the slate\r\nembedded in it.\r\n\r\n [13] In a greenstone-dike in the Magdalen Channel, the feldspar\r\n cleaved with the angle of albite. This dike was crossed, as well as\r\n the surrounding slate, by a large vein of quartz, a circumstance of\r\n unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Southern Tierra del Fuego, the clay-slate towards its S.W. boundary,\r\nbecomes much altered and feldspathic. Thus on Wollaston Island slate\r\nand grauwacke can be distinctly traced passing into feldspathic rocks\r\nand greenstones, including iron pyrites and epidote, but still\r\nretaining traces of cleavage with the usual strike and dip. One such\r\nmetamorphosed mass was traversed by large vein-like masses of a\r\nbeautiful mixture (as ascertained by Professor Miller) of green\r\nepidote, garnets, and white calcareous spar. On the northern point of\r\nthis same island, there were various ancient submarine volcanic rocks,\r\nconsisting of amygdaloids with dark bole and agate,—of basalt with\r\ndecomposed olivine—of compact lava with glassy feldspar,—and of a\r\ncoarse conglomerate of red scoriæ, parts being amygdaloidal with\r\ncarbonate of lime. The southern part of Wollaston Island and the whole\r\nof Hermite and Horn Islands, seem formed of cones of greenstone; the\r\noutlying islets of Il Defenso and D. Raminez are said[14] to consist of\r\nporphyritic lava. In crossing Hardy Peninsula, the slate still\r\nretaining traces of its usual cleavage, passes into columnar\r\nfeldspathic rocks, which are succeeded by an irregular tract of\r\ntrappean and basaltic rocks, containing glassy feldspar and much iron\r\npyrites: there is, also, some harsh red claystone porphyry, and an\r\nalmost true trachyte, with needles of hornblende, and in one spot a\r\ncurious slaty rock divided into quadrangular columns, having a base\r\nalmost like trachyte, with drusy cavities lined by crystals, too\r\nimperfect, according to Professor Miller, to be measured, but\r\nresembling Zeagonite.[15] In the midst of these singular rocks, no\r\ndoubt of ancient submarine volcanic origin, a high hill of feldspathic\r\nclay-slate projected, retaining\r\nits usual cleavage. Near this point, there was a small hillock, having\r\nthe aspect of granite, but formed of white albite, brilliant crystals\r\nof hornblende (both ascertained by the reflecting goniometer) and mica;\r\nbut with no quartz. No recent volcanic district has been observed in\r\nany part of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n [14] Determined by Professor Jameson. Weddell’s “Voyage,” p. 169.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] See Mr. Brooke’s Paper in the _London Phil. Mag.,_ vol. x. This\r\n mineral occurs in an ancient volcanic rock near Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive miles west of the bifurcation of the Beagle Channel, the\r\nslate-formation, instead of becoming, as in the more southern parts of\r\nTierra del Fuego, feldspathic, and associated with trappean or old\r\nvolcanic rocks, passes by alternations into a great underlying mass of\r\nfine gneiss and glossy clay-slate, which at no great distance is\r\nsucceeded by a grand formation of mica-slate containing garnets. The\r\nfolia of these metamorphic schists strike parallel to the\r\ncleavage-planes of the clay-slate, which have a very uniform direction\r\nover the whole of this part of the country: the folia, however, are\r\nundulatory and tortuous, whilst the cleavage-laminæ of the slate are\r\nstraight. These schists compose the chief mountain-chain of Southern\r\nTierra del Fuego, ranging along the north side of the northern arm of\r\nthe Beagle Channel, in a short W.N.W. and E.S.E. line, with two points\r\n(Mounts Sarmiento and Darwin) rising to heights of 6,800 and 6,900\r\nfeet. On the south-western side of this northern arm of the Beagle\r\nChannel, the clay-slate is seen with its _strata_ dipping from the\r\ngreat chain, so that the metamorphic schists here form a ridge bordered\r\non each side by clay-slate. Further north, however, to the west of this\r\ngreat range, there is no clay-slate, but only gneiss, mica, and\r\nhornblendic slates, resting on great barren hills of true granite, and\r\nforming a tract about sixty miles in width. Again, westward of these\r\nrocks, the outermost islands are of trappean formation, which, from\r\ninformation obtained during the voyages of the _Adventure_ and\r\n_Beagle,_[16] seem, together with granite, chiefly to prevail along the\r\nwestern coast as far north as the entrance of the St. of Magellan: a\r\nlittle more inland, on the eastern side of Clarence Island and S.\r\nDesolation, granite, greenstone, mica-slate, and gneiss appear to\r\npredominate. I am tempted to believe, that where the clay-slate has\r\nbeen metamorphosed at great depths beneath the surface, gneiss,\r\nmica-slate, and other allied rocks have been formed, but where the\r\naction has taken place nearer the surface, feldspathic porphyries,\r\ngreenstones, etc., have resulted, often accompanied by submarine\r\nvolcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n [16] See the Paper by Captain King in the _ Geograph. Journal_; also a\r\n Letter to Dr. Fitton in “Geolog. Proc.,” vol. i, p. 29; also some\r\n observations by Captain Fitzroy, “Voyages,” vol. i, p. 375. I am\r\n indebted also to Mr. Lyell for a series of specimens collected by\r\n Lieutenant Graves.\r\n\r\nOnly one other rock, met with in both arms of the Beagle Channel,\r\ndeserves any notice, namely a granulo-crystalline mixture of white\r\nalbite, black hornblende (ascertained by measurement of the crystals,\r\nand confirmed by Professor Miller), and more or less of brown mica, but\r\nwithout any quartz. This rock occurs in large masses, closely\r\nresembling in external form granite or syenite: in the southern arm of\r\nthe Channel, one such mass underlies the mica-slate, on which\r\nclay-slate was superimposed: this peculiar plutonic rock which, as we\r\nhave\r\nseen, occurs also in Hardy Peninsula, is interesting, from its perfect\r\nsimilarity with that (hereafter often to be referred to under the name\r\nof andesite) forming the great injected axes of the Cordillera of\r\nChile.\r\n\r\nThe stratification of the clay-slate is generally very obscure, whereas\r\nthe cleavage is remarkably well defined: to begin with the extreme\r\neastern parts of Tierra del Fuego; the cleavage-planes near the St. of\r\nLe Maire strike either W. and E. or W.S.W. and E.N.E., and are highly\r\ninclined; the form of the land, including Staten Island, indicates that\r\nthe axes of elevation have run in this same line, though I was unable\r\nto distinguish the planes of stratification. Proceeding westward, I\r\naccurately examined the cleavage of the clay-slate on the northern,\r\neastern, and western sides (thirty-five miles apart) of Navarin Island,\r\nand everywhere found the laminæ ranging with extreme regularity, W.N.W.\r\nand E.S.E., seldom varying more than one point of the compass from this\r\ndirection.[17] Both on the east and west coasts, I crossed at right\r\nangles the cleavage-planes for a space of about eight miles, and found\r\nthem dipping at an angle of between 45° and 90°, generally to S.S.W.,\r\nsometimes to N.N.E., and often quite vertically. The S.S.W. dip was\r\noccasionally succeeded abruptly by a N.N.E. dip, and this by a vertical\r\ncleavage, or again by the S.S.W. dip; as in a lofty cliff on the\r\neastern end of the island the laminæ of slate were seen to be folded\r\ninto very large steep curves, ranging in the usual W.N.W. line, I\r\nsuspect that the varying and opposite dips may possibly be accounted\r\nfor by the cleavage-laminæ, though to the eye appearing straight, being\r\nparts of large abrupt curves, with their summits cut off and worn down.\r\n\r\n [17] The clay-slate in this island was in many places crossed by\r\n parallel smooth joints. Out of five cases, the angle of intersection\r\n between the strike of these joints and that of the cleavage-laminæ was\r\n in two cases 45° and in two others 79°.\r\n\r\nIn several places I was particularly struck with the fact, that the\r\nfine laminæ of the clay-slate, where cutting straight through the bands\r\nof stratification, and therefore indisputably true cleavage-planes,\r\ndiffered slightly in their greyish and greenish tints of colour, in\r\ncompactness, and in some of the laminæ having a rather more jaspery\r\nappearance than others. I have not seen this fact recorded, and it\r\nappears to me important, for it shows that the same cause which has\r\nproduced the highly fissile structure, has altered in a slight degree\r\nthe mineralogical character of the rock in the same planes. The bands\r\nof stratification, just alluded to, can be distinguished in many\r\nplaces, especially in Navarin Island, but only on the weathered\r\nsurfaces of the slate; they consist of slightly undulatory zones of\r\ndifferent shades of colour and of thicknesses, and resemble the marks\r\n(more closely than anything else to which I can compare them) left on\r\nthe inside of a vessel by the draining away of some dirty slightly\r\nagitated liquid: no difference in composition, corresponding with these\r\nzones, could be seen in freshly fractured surfaces. In the more level\r\nparts of Navarin Island, these bands of stratification were nearly\r\nhorizontal; but on the flanks of the mountains they were inclined from\r\nthem, but in no instance that I saw at a very high angle. There can, I\r\nthink, be no doubt that these zones,\r\nwhich appear only on the weathered surfaces, are the last vestiges of\r\nthe original planes of stratification, now almost obliterated by the\r\nhighly fissile and altered structure which the mass has assumed.\r\n\r\nThe clay-slate cleaves in the same W.N.W. and E.S.E. direction, as on\r\nNavarin Island, on both sides of the Beagle Channel, on the eastern\r\nside of Hoste Island, on the N.E. side of Hardy Peninsula, and on the\r\nnorthern point of Wollaston Island; although in these two latter\r\nlocalities the cleavage has been much obscured by the metamorphosed and\r\nfeldspathic condition of the slate. Within the area of these several\r\nislands, including Navarin Island, the direction of the stratification\r\nand of the mountain-chains is very obscure; though the mountains in\r\nseveral places appeared to range in the same W.N.W. line with the\r\ncleavage: the outline of the coast, however, does not correspond with\r\nthis line. Near the bifurcation of the Beagle Channel, where the\r\nunderlying metamorphic schists are first seen, they are foliated (with\r\nsome irregularities), in this same W.N.W. line, and parallel, as before\r\nstated, to the main mountain-axis of this part of the country. Westward\r\nof this main range, the metamorphic schists are foliated, though less\r\nplainly, in the same direction, which is likewise common to the zone of\r\nold erupted trappean rocks, forming the outermost islets. Hence the\r\narea, over which the cleavage of the slate and the foliation of the\r\nmetamorphic schists extends with an average W.N.W. and E.S.E. strike,\r\nis about forty miles in a north and south line, and ninety miles in an\r\neast and west line.\r\n\r\nFurther northward, near Port Famine, the stratification of the\r\nclay-slate and of the associated rocks, is well defined, and there\r\nalone the cleavage and strata-planes are parallel. A little north of\r\nthis port there is an anticlinal axis ranging N.W. (or a little more\r\nwesterly) and S.E.: south of the port, as far as Admiralty Sound and\r\nGabriel Channel, the outline of the land clearly indicates the\r\nexistence of several lines of elevation in this same N.W. direction,\r\nwhich, I may add, is so uniform in the western half of the St. of\r\nMagellan, that, as Captain King[18] has remarked, “a parallel ruler\r\nplaced on the map upon the projecting points of the south shore, and\r\nextended across the strait, will also touch the headlands on the\r\nopposite coast.” It would appear, from Captain King’s observations,\r\nthat over all this area the cleavage extends in the same line.\r\nDeep-water channels, however, in all parts of Tierra del Fuego have\r\nburst through the trammels both of stratification and cleavage; most of\r\nthem may have been formed during the elevation of the land by\r\nlong-continued erosion, but others, for instance the Beagle Channel,\r\nwhich stretches like a narrow canal for 120 miles obliquely through the\r\nmountains, can hardly have thus originated.\r\n\r\n [18] _Geograph. Journal,_ vol. i, p. 170.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that in the extreme eastern point of Tierra del\r\nFuego, the cleavage and coast-lines extend W. and E. and even W.S.W.\r\nand E.N.E.: over a large area westward, the cleavage, the main range of\r\nmountains, and some subordinate ranges, but not the outlines of the\r\ncoast, strike W.N.W., and E.S.E.: in the central and western parts of\r\nthe St. of Magellan, the stratification, the mountain-ranges, the\r\noutlines of the coast, and the cleavage all strike nearly N.W. and S.E.\r\nNorth of the strait, the outline of the coast, and the mountains on the\r\nmainland, run nearly north and south. Hence we see, at this southern\r\npoint of the continent, how gradually the Cordillera bend, from their\r\nnorth and south course of so many thousand miles in length, into an E.\r\nand even E.N.E. direction.\r\n\r\n_West coast, from the Southern Chonos Islands to Northern Chile._—The\r\nfirst place at which we landed north of the St. of Magellan was near\r\nCape Tres Montes, in lat. 47° S. Between this point and the Northern\r\nChonos Islands, a distance of 200 miles, the _Beagle_ visited several\r\npoints, and specimens were collected for me from the intermediate\r\nspaces by Lieutenant Stokes. The predominant rock is mica-slate, with\r\nthick folia of quartz, very frequently alternating with and passing\r\ninto a chloritic, or into a black, glossy, often striated, slightly\r\nanthracitic schist, which soils paper, and becomes white under a great\r\nheat, and then fuses. Thin layers of feldspar, swelling at intervals\r\ninto well crystallised kernels, are sometimes included in these black\r\nschists; and I observed one mass of the ordinary black variety\r\ninsensibly lose its fissile structure, and pass into a singular mixture\r\nof chlorite, epidote, feldspar, and mica. Great veins of quartz are\r\nnumerous in the mica-schists; wherever these occur the folia are much\r\nconvoluted. In the southern part of the Peninsula of Tres Montes, a\r\ncompact altered feldspathic rock with crystals of feldspar and grains\r\nof quartz is the commonest variety; this rock[19] exhibits occasionally\r\ntraces of an original brecciated structure, and often presents (like\r\nthe altered state of Tierra del Fuego) traces of cleavage-planes, which\r\nstrike in the same direction with the folia of mica-schist further\r\nnorthward. At Inchemo Island, a similar rock gradually becomes\r\ngranulo-crystalline and acquires scales of mica; and this variety at S.\r\nEstevan becomes highly laminated, and though still exhibiting some\r\nrounded grains of quartz, passes into the black, glossy, slightly\r\nanthracitic schist, which, as we have seen, repeatedly alternates with\r\nand passes into the micaceous and chloritic schists. Hence all the\r\nrocks on this line of coast belong to one series, and insensibly vary\r\nfrom an altered feldspathic clay-slate into largely foliated, true\r\nmica-schist.\r\n\r\n [19] The peculiar, abruptly conical form of the hills in this\r\n neighbourhood, would have led any one at first to have supposed that\r\n they had been formed of injected or intrusive rocks.\r\n\r\nThe cleavage of the homogeneous schists, the foliation of those\r\ncomposed of more or less distinct minerals in layers, and the planes of\r\nalternation of the different varieties or so-called stratification, are\r\nall parallel, and preserve over this 200 miles of coast a remarkable\r\ndegree of uniformity in direction. At the northern end of the group, at\r\nLow’s Harbour, the well-defined folia of mica-schist everywhere ranged\r\nwithin eight degrees (or less than one point of the compass) of N. 19°\r\nW. and S. 19° E.; and even the point of dip varied very little, being\r\nalways directed to the west and generally at an angle of forty degrees;\r\nI should mention that I had here good opportunities of observation, for\r\nI followed the naked rock on the beach, transversely to the strike, for\r\na distance of four miles and a half, and all the way attended to the\r\ndip. Along the outer islands for 100 miles south of Low’s Harbour,\r\nLieutenant Stokes, during his boat-survey, kindly observed for me the\r\nstrike of the foliation, and he assures me that it was invariably\r\nnortherly, and the dip with one single exception to the west. Further\r\nsouth at Vallenar Bay, the strike was almost universally N. 25° W. and\r\nthe dip, generally at an angle of about 40° to W. 25° S., but in some\r\nplaces almost vertical. Still farther south, in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe harbours of Anna Pink, S. Estevan and S. Andres, and (judging from\r\na distance) along the southern part of Tres Montes, the foliation and\r\ncleavage extended in a line between [N. 11° to 22° W.] and [S. 11° to\r\n22° E.]; and the planes dipped generally westerly, but often easterly,\r\nat angles varying from a gentle inclination to vertical. At A. Pink’s\r\nHarbour, where the schists generally dipped easterly, wherever the\r\nangle became very high, the strike changed from N. 11° W. to even as\r\nmuch as N. 45° W.: in an analogous manner at Vallenar Bay, where the\r\ndip was westerly (viz. on an average directed to W. 25° S.), as soon as\r\nthe angle became very high, the planes struck in a line more than 25°\r\nwest of north. The average result from all the observations on this 200\r\nmiles of coast, is a strike of N. 19° W. and S. 19° E.: considering\r\nthat in each specified place my examination extended over an area of\r\nseveral miles, and that Lieutenant Stokes’ observations apply to a\r\nlength of 100 miles, I think this remarkable uniformity is pretty well\r\nestablished. The prevalence, throughout the northern half of this line\r\nof coast, of a dip in one direction, that is to the west, instead of\r\nbeing sometimes west and sometimes east, is, judging from what I have\r\nelsewhere seen, an unusual circumstance. In Brazil, La Plata, the\r\nFalkland Islands, and Tierra del Fuego, there is generally an obvious\r\nrelation between the axis of elevation, the outline of the coast, and\r\nthe strike of the cleavage or foliation: in the Chonos Archipelago,\r\nhowever, neither the minor details of the coast-line, nor the chain of\r\nthe Cordillera, nor the subordinate transverse mountain-axes, accord\r\nwith the strike of the foliation and cleavage: the seaward face of the\r\nnumerous islands composing this Archipelago, and apparently the line of\r\nthe Cordillera, range N. 11° E., whereas, as we have just seen, the\r\naverage strike of the foliation is N. 19° W.\r\n\r\nThere is one interesting exception to the uniformity in the strike of\r\nthe foliation. At the northern point of Tres Montes (lat. 45° 52′) a\r\nbold chain of granite, between two and three thousand feet in height,\r\nruns from the coast far into the interior,[20] in an E.S.E. line, or\r\nmore strictly E. 28° S. and W. 28° N. In a bay, at the northern foot of\r\nthis range, there are a few islets of mica-slate, with the folia in\r\nsome parts horizontal, but mostly inclined at an average angle of 20°\r\nto the north. On the northern steep flank of the range, there are a few\r\npatches (some quite isolated, and not larger than half-a-crown!) of the\r\nmica-schist, foliated with the same northerly dip. On the broad summit,\r\nas far as the\r\nsouthern crest, there is much mica-slate, in some places even 400 feet\r\nin thickness, with the folia all dipping north, at angles varying from\r\n5° to 20°, but sometimes mounting up to 30°. The southern flank\r\nconsists of bare granite. The mica-slate is penetrated by small\r\nveins[21] of granite, branching from the main body. Leaving out of view\r\nthe prevalent strike of the folia in other parts of this Archipelago,\r\nit might have been expected that they would have dipped N. 28° E., that\r\nis directly from the ridge, and, considering its abruptness, at a high\r\ninclination; but the real dip, as we have just seen, both at the foot\r\nand on the northern flank, and over the entire summit, is at a small\r\nangle, and directed nearly due north. From these considerations it\r\noccurred to me, that perhaps we here had the novel and curious case of\r\nalready inclined laminæ obliquely tilted at a subsequent period by the\r\ngranitic axis. Mr. Hopkins, so well known from his mathematical\r\ninvestigations, has most kindly calculated the problem: the proposition\r\nsent was,—Take a district composed of laminæ, dipping at an angle of 40\r\ndegrees to W. 19° S., and let an axis of elevation traverse it in an E.\r\n28° S. line, what will the position of the laminæ be on the northern\r\nflank after a tilt, we will first suppose, of 45°? Mr. Hopkins informs\r\nme, that the angle of the dip will be 28° 31′, and its direction to\r\nnorth 30° 33′ west.[22] By varying the supposed angle of the tilt, our\r\npreviously inclined folia can be thrown into any angle between 26°,\r\nwhich is the least possible angle, and 90°; but if a small inclination\r\nbe thus given to them, their point of dip will depart far from the\r\nnorth, and therefore not accord with the actual position of the folia\r\nof mica-schist on our granitic range. Hence it appears very difficult,\r\nwithout varying considerably the elements of the problem, thus to\r\nexplain the anomalous strike and dip of the foliated mica-schist,\r\nespecially in those parts, namely, at the base of the range, where the\r\nfolia are almost horizontal. Mr. Hopkins, however, adds, that great\r\nirregularities and lateral thrusts might be expected in every great\r\nline of elevation, and that these would account for considerable\r\ndeviations from the calculated results: considering that the granitic\r\naxis, as shown by the veins, has indisputably been injected after the\r\nperfect formation of the mica-slate, and considering the uniformity of\r\nthe strike of the folia throughout the rest of the Archipelago, I\r\ncannot but still think that their anomalous position at this one point\r\nis someway directly and mechanically related to the intrusion of this\r\nW.N.W. and E.S.E. mountain-chain of granite.\r\n\r\n [20] In the distance, other mountains could be seen apparently ranging\r\n N.N.E. and S.S.W. at right angles to this one. I may add, that not far\r\n from Vallenar Bay there is a fine range, apparently of granite, which\r\n has burst through the mica-slate in a N.E. by E. and S.W. by S. line.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] The granite within these veins, as well as generally at the\r\n junction with the mica-slate, is more quartzose than elsewhere. The\r\n granite, I may add, is traversed by dikes running for a very great\r\n length in the line of the mountains; they are composed of a somewhat\r\n laminated eurite, containing crystals of feldspar, hornblende, and\r\n octagons of quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] On the south side of the axis (where, however, I did not see any\r\n mica-slate) the dip of the folia would be at an angle of 77° 55′,\r\n directed to west 35° 33′ south. Hence the two points of dip on the\r\n opposite sides of the range, instead of being as in ordinary cases\r\n directly opposed to each other at an angle of 180°, would here be only\r\n 86° 50′ apart.\r\n\r\nDikes are frequent in the metamorphic schists of the Chonos Islands,\r\nand seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient\r\nvolcanic rocks on the south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego. At S.\r\nAndres I observed in the space of half-a-mile, seven broad, parallel\r\ndikes, composed of three varieties of trap, running in a N.W. and S.E.\r\nline, parallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges of altered\r\nclay-slate; but they must be of long subsequent origin to these\r\nmountains; for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the\r\nlast chapter. North of Tres Montes, I noticed three dikes differing\r\nfrom each other in composition, one of them having a euritic base\r\nincluding large octagons of quartz; these dikes, as well as several of\r\nporphyritic greenstone at Vallenar Bay, extended N.E. and S.W., nearly\r\nat right angles to the foliation of the schists, but in the line of\r\ntheir joints. At Low’s Harbour, however, a set of great parallel dikes,\r\none ninety yards and another sixty yards in width, have been guided by\r\nthe foliation of the mica-schist, and hence are inclined westward at an\r\nangle of 45°: these dikes are formed of various porphyritic traps, some\r\nof which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded grains of\r\nquartz. A porphyritic trap of this latter kind, passed in one of the\r\ndikes into a most curious hornstone, perfectly white, with a waxy\r\nfracture and pellucid edges, fusible, and containing many grains of\r\nquartz and specks of iron pyrites. In the ninety-yard dike several\r\nlarge, apparently now quite isolated, fragments of mica-slate were\r\nembedded: but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the\r\nsurrounding solid rock, no doubt these new separate fragments\r\noriginally formed wedge-shaped depending portions of a continuous vault\r\nor crust, once extending over the dike, but since worn down and\r\ndenuded.\r\n\r\n_Chiloe, Valdivia, Concepcion._—In Chiloe, a great formation of\r\nmica-schist strikingly resembles that of the Chonos Islands. For a\r\nspace of eleven miles on the S.E. coast, the folia were very distinct,\r\nthough slightly convoluted, and ranged within a point of N.N.W. and\r\nS.S.E., dipping either E.N.E. or more commonly W.S.W., at an average\r\nangle of 22° (in one spot, however, at 60°), and therefore decidedly at\r\na lesser inclination than amongst the Chonos Islands. On the west and\r\nnorth-western shores, the foliation was often obscure, though, where\r\nbest defined, it ranged within a point of N. by W. and S. by E.,\r\ndipping either easterly or westerly, at varying and generally very\r\nsmall angles. Hence, from the southern part of Tres Montes to the\r\nnorthern end of Chiloe, a distance of 300 miles, we have closely allied\r\nrocks with their folia striking on an average in the same direction,\r\nnamely between N. 11° and 22° W. Again, at Valdivia, we meet with the\r\nsame mica-schist, exhibiting nearly the same mineralogical passages as\r\nin the Chonos Archipelago, often, however, becoming more ferruginous,\r\nand containing so much feldspar as to pass into gneiss. The folia were\r\ngenerally well defined; but nowhere else in South America did I see\r\nthem varying so much in direction: this seemed chiefly caused by their\r\nforming parts, as I could sometimes distinctly trace, of large flat\r\ncurves: nevertheless, both near the settlement and towards the\r\ninterior, a N.W. and S.E. strike seemed more frequent than any other\r\ndirection; the angle of the dip was generally small. At Concepcion, a\r\nhighly\r\nglossy clay-slate had its cleavage often slightly curvilinear, and\r\ninclined, seldom at a high angle, towards various points of the\r\ncompass:[23] but here, as at Valdivia, a N.W. and S.E. strike seemed to\r\nbe the most frequent one. In certain spots large quartz veins were\r\nnumerous, and near them, the cleavage, as was the case with the\r\nfoliation of the schists in the Chonos Archipelago, became extremely\r\ntortuous.\r\n\r\n [23] I observed in some parts that the tops of the laminæ of the\r\n clay-slate (_b_ of the diagram) under the superficial detritus and\r\n soil (_a_) were bent, sometimes without being broken, as represented\r\n in the accompanying diagram, which is copied from one given by Sir H.\r\n De la Beche (p. 42 “Geological Manual”) of an exactly similar\r\n phenomenon in Devonshire. Mr. R. A. C. Austen, also, in his excellent\r\n paper on S.E. Devon (“Geolog. Transact.,” vol. vi, p. 437), has\r\n described this phenomenon; he attributes it to the action of frosts,\r\n but at the same time doubts whether the frosts of the present day\r\n penetrate to a sufficient depth. As it is known that earthquakes\r\n particularly affect the surface of the ground, it occurred to me that\r\n this appearance might perhaps be due, at least at Concepcion, to their\r\n frequent occurrence; the superficial layers of detritus being either\r\n jerked in one direction, or, where the surface was inclined, pushed a\r\n little downwards during each strong vibration. In North Wales I have\r\n seen a somewhat analogous but less regular appearance, though on a\r\n greater scale (_London Phil. Mag.,_ vol. xxi, p. 184), and produced by\r\n a quite different cause, namely, by the stranding of great icebergs;\r\n this latter appearance has also been observed in N. America.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram described in note 23.]\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of Quiriquina Island, in the Bay of Concepcion, at\r\nleast eight rudely parallel dikes, which have been guided to a certain\r\nextent by the cleavage of the slate, occur within the space of a\r\nquarter of a mile. They vary much in composition, resembling in many\r\nrespects the dikes at Low’s Harbour: the greater number consist of\r\nfeldspathic porphyries, sometimes containing grains of quartz: one,\r\nhowever, was black and brilliant, like an augitic rock, but really\r\nformed of feldspar; others of a feldspathic nature were perfectly\r\nwhite, with either an earthy or crystalline fracture, and including\r\ngrains and regular octagons of quartz; these white varieties passed\r\ninto ordinary greenstones. Although, both here and at Low’s Harbour,\r\nthe nature of the rock varied considerably in the same dike, yet I\r\ncannot but think that at these two places and in other parts of the\r\nChonos group, where the dikes, though close to each other and running\r\nparallel, are of different composition, that they must have been formed\r\nat different periods. In the case of Quiriquina this is a rather\r\ninteresting conclusion, for these eight parallel dikes cut through the\r\nmetamorphic schists in a N.W. and S.E. line, and since their injection\r\nthe overlying cretaceous or tertiary strata have been tilted (whilst\r\nstill under the sea) from a N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. line; and again,\r\nduring the great earthquake of February 1835, the ground in this\r\nneighbourhood was fissured in N.W. and S.E. lines; and from the manner\r\nin which buildings were\r\nthrown down, it was evident that the surface undulated in this same\r\ndirection.[24]\r\n\r\n [24] “Geolog. Trans.,” vol. vi, pp. 602 and 617. “Journal of\r\n Researches” (2nd edit.), p. 307.\r\n\r\n_Central and Northern Chile._—Northward of Concepcion, as far as\r\nCopiapo, the shores of the Pacific consist, with the exception of some\r\nsmall tertiary basins, of gneiss, mica-schist, altered clay-slate,\r\ngranite, greenstone and syenite: hence the coast from Tres Montes to\r\nCopiapo, a distance of 1,200 miles, and I have reason to believe for a\r\nmuch greater space, is almost similarly constituted.\r\n\r\nNear Valparaiso the prevailing rock is gneiss, generally including much\r\nhornblende: concretionary balls formed of feldspar, hornblende and\r\nmica, from two or three feet in diameter, are in very many places\r\nconformably enfolded by the foliated gneiss: veins of quartz and\r\nfeldspar, including black schorl and well-crystallised epidote, are\r\nnumerous. Epidote likewise occurs in the gneiss in thin layers,\r\nparallel to the foliation of the mass. One large vein of a coarse\r\ngranitic character was remarkable from in one part quite changing its\r\ncharacter, and insensibly passing into a blackish porphyry, including\r\nacicular crystals of glassy feldspar and of hornblende: I have never\r\nseen any other such case.[25]\r\n\r\n [25] Humboldt (“Personal Narrative,” vol. iv, p. 60) has described\r\n with much surprise, concretionary balls, with concentric divisions,\r\n composed of partially vitreous feldspar, hornblende, and garnets,\r\n included within great veins of gneiss, which cut across the mica-slate\r\n near Venezuela.\r\n\r\nI shall in the few following remarks on the rocks of Chile allude\r\nexclusively to their foliation and cleavage. In the gneiss round\r\nValparaiso the strike of the foliation is very variable, but I think\r\nabout N. by W. and S. by E. is the commonest direction; this likewise\r\nholds good with the cleavage of the altered feldspathic clay-slates,\r\noccasionally met with on the coast for ninety miles north of\r\nValparaiso. Some feldspathic slate, alternating with strata of\r\nclaystone porphyry in the Bell of Quillota and at Jajuel, and\r\ntherefore, perhaps, belonging to a later period than the metamorphic\r\nschists on the coast, cleaved in this same direction. In the Eastern\r\nCordillera, in the Portillo Pass, there is a grand mass of mica-slate,\r\nfoliated in a north and south line, and with a high westerly dip: in\r\nthe Uspallata range, clay-slate and grauwacke have a highly inclined,\r\nnearly north and south cleavage, though in some parts the strike is\r\nirregular: in the main or Cumbre range, the direction of the cleavage\r\nin the feldspathic clay-slate is N.W. and S.E.\r\n\r\nBetween Coquimbo and Guasco there are two considerable formations of\r\nmica-slate, in one of which the rock passed sometimes into common\r\nclay-slate and sometimes into a glossy black variety, very like that in\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago. The folia and cleavage of these rocks ranged\r\nbetween [N. and N.W. by N.] and [S. and S.W. by S.]. Near the Port of\r\nGuasco several varieties of altered clay-slate have a quite irregular\r\ncleavage. Between Guasco and Copiapo, there are some siliceous and\r\ntalcaceous slates cleaving in a north and south line, with an easterly\r\ndip of between 60° and 70°: high up, also, the main valley of Copiapo,\r\nthere is mica-slate with a high easterly dip. In the whole space\r\nbetween Valparaiso and Copiapo an easterly dip is much more common than\r\nan opposite or westerly one.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on Cleavage and Foliation._\r\n\r\nIn this southern part of the southern hemisphere, we have seen that the\r\ncleavage-laminæ range over wide areas with remarkable uniformity,\r\ncutting straight through the planes of stratification,[26] but yet\r\nbeing parallel in strike to the main axes of elevation, and generally\r\nto the outlines of the coast. The dip, however, is as variable, both in\r\nangle and in direction (that is, sometimes being inclined to the one\r\nside and sometimes to the directly opposite side), as the strike is\r\nuniform. In all these respects there is a close agreement with the\r\nfacts given by Professor Sedgwick in his celebrated memoir in the\r\n“Geological Transactions,” and by Sir R. I. Murchison in his various\r\nexcellent discussions on this subject. The Falkland Islands, and more\r\nespecially Tierra del Fuego, offer striking instances of the lines of\r\ncleavage, the principle axes of elevation, and the outlines of the\r\ncoast, gradually changing together their courses. The direction which\r\nprevails throughout Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands, namely,\r\nfrom west with some northing to east with some southing, is also common\r\nto the several ridges in Northern Patagonia and in the western parts of\r\nBanda Oriental: in this latter province, in the Sierra Tapalguen, and\r\nin the Western Falkland Island, the W. by N., or W.N.W. and E.S.E.,\r\nridges, are crossed at right angles by others ranging N.N.E. and S.S.W.\r\n\r\n [26] In my paper on the Falkland Islands (_Geological Journal,_ vol.\r\n iii, p. 267), I have given a curious case on the authority of Captain\r\n Sulivan, R.N., of much folded beds of clay-slate, in some of which the\r\n cleavage is perpendicular to the horizon, and in others it is\r\n perpendicular to each curvature or fold of the bed: this appears a new\r\n case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact of the cleavage-laminæ in the clay-slate of Tierra del Fuego,\r\nwhere seen cutting straight through the planes of stratification, and\r\nwhere consequently there could be no doubt about their nature,\r\ndiffering slightly in colour, texture, and hardness, appears to me very\r\ninteresting. In a thick mass of laminated, feldspathic and altered\r\nclay-slate, interposed between two great strata of porphyritic\r\nconglomerate in Central Chile, and where there could be but little\r\ndoubt about the bedding, I observed similar slight differences in\r\ncomposition, and likewise some distinct thin layers of epidote,\r\nparallel to the highly inclined cleavage of the mass. Again, I\r\nincidentally noticed in North Wales,[27] where glaciers had passed over\r\nthe truncated edges of the highly inclined laminæ of clay-slate, that\r\nthe surface, though smooth, was worn into small parallel undulations,\r\ncaused by the competent laminæ being of slightly different degrees of\r\nhardness. With reference to the slates of North Wales, Professor\r\nSedgwick describes the planes of cleavage, as “coated over with\r\nchlorite and semi-crystalline matter, which not only merely define the\r\nplanes in question, but strike in parallel flakes through the whole\r\nmass of the rock.”[28] In some of those\r\nglossy and hard varieties of clay-slate, which may often be seen\r\npassing into mica-schist, it has appeared to me that the\r\ncleavage-planes were formed of excessively thin, generally slighted\r\nconvoluted, folia, composed of microscopically minute scales of mica.\r\nFrom these several facts, and more especially from the case of the\r\nclay-slate in Tierra del Fuego, it must, I think, be concluded, that\r\nthe same power which has impressed on the slate its fissile structure\r\nor cleavage has tended to modify its mineralogical character in\r\nparallel planes.\r\n\r\n [27] _London Phil. Mag._, vol. xxi, p. 182.\r\n\r\n\r\n [28] “Geological Trans.,” vol. iii, p. 471.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the foliation of the metamorphic schists, a subject\r\nwhich has been much less attended to. As in the case of\r\ncleavage-laminæ, the folia preserve over very large areas a uniform\r\nstrike: thus Humboldt[29] found for a distance of 300 miles in\r\nVenezuela, and indeed over a much larger space, gneiss, granite, mica,\r\nand clay-slate, striking very uniformly N.E. and S.W., and dipping at\r\nan angle of between 60° and 70° to N.W.; it would even appear from the\r\nfacts given in this chapter, that the metamorphic rocks throughout the\r\nnorth-eastern part of South America are generally foliated within two\r\npoints of N.E. and S.W. Over the eastern parts of Banda Oriental, the\r\nfoliation strikes with a high inclination, very uniformly N.N.E. to\r\nS.S.W., and over the western parts, in a W. by N. and E. by S. line.\r\nFor a space of 300 miles on the shores of the Chonos and Chiloe\r\nIslands, we have seen that the foliation seldom deviates more than a\r\npoint of the compass from a N. 19° W. and S. 19° E. strike. As in the\r\ncase of cleavage, the angle of the dip in foliated rocks is generally\r\nhigh but variable, and alternates from one side of the line of strike\r\nto the other side, sometimes being vertical: in the Northern Chonos\r\nIslands, however, the folia are inclined almost always to the west; in\r\nnearly the same manner, the cleavage-laminæ in Southern Tierra del\r\nFuego certainly dip much more frequently to S.S.W. than to the opposite\r\npoint. In Eastern Banda Oriental, in parts of Brazil, and in some other\r\ndistricts, the foliation runs in the same direction with the\r\nmountain-ranges and adjoining coast-lines: amongst the Chonos Islands,\r\nhowever, this coincidence fails, and I have given my reasons for\r\nsuspecting that one granitic axis has burst through and tilted the\r\nalready inclined folia of mica-schist: in the case of cleavage,[30] the\r\ncoincidence between its strike and that of the main stratification\r\nseems sometimes to fail. Foliation and cleavage resemble each other in\r\nthe planes winding round concretions, and in becoming tortuous where\r\nveins of quartz abound.[31] On the flanks of\r\nthe mountains both in Tierra del Fuego and in other countries, I have\r\nobserved that the cleavage-planes frequently dip at a high angle\r\ninwards; and this was long ago observed by Von Buch to be the case in\r\nNorway: this fact is perhaps analogous to the folded, fan-like or\r\nradiating structure in the metamorphic schists of the Alps,[32] in\r\nwhich the folia in the central crests are vertical and on the two\r\nflanks inclined inwards. Where masses of fissile and foliated rocks\r\nalternate together, the cleavage and foliation, in all cases which I\r\nhave seen, are parallel. Where in one district the rocks are fissile,\r\nand in another adjoining district they are foliated, the planes of\r\ncleavage and foliation are likewise generally parallel: this is the\r\ncase with the feldspathic homogeneous slates in the southern part of\r\nthe Chonos group, compared with the fine foliated mica-schists of the\r\nnorthern part; so again the clay-slate of the whole eastern side of\r\nTierra del Fuego cleaves in exactly the same line with the foliated\r\ngneiss and mica-slate of the western coast; other analogous instances\r\nmight have been adduced.[33]\r\n\r\n [29] “Personal Narrative,” vol. vi, p. 59 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\n [30] Cases are given by Mr. Jukes in his “Geology of Newfoundland,” p.\r\n 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n [31] I have seen in Brazil and Chile concretions thus enfolded by\r\n foliated gneiss; and Macculloch (“Highlands,” vol. i, p. 64) has\r\n described a similar case. For analogous cases in clay-slate, see\r\n Professor Henslow’s Memoir in “Cambridge Phil. Trans.,” vol. i, p.\r\n 379, and Macculloch’s “Class. of Rocks,” p. 351. With respect to both\r\n foliation and cleavage becoming tortuous where quartz-veins abound, I\r\n have seen instances near Monte Video, at Concepcion, and in the Chonos\r\n Islands. See also Mr. Greenough’s “Critical Examination,” p. 78.\r\n\r\n\r\n [32] Studer in _Edin. New Phil. Journal,_ vol. xxiii, p. 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n [33] I have given a case in Australia. See my “Volcanic Islands.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the folia of quartz, mica, feldspar, and\r\nother minerals composing the metamorphic schists, Professor Sedgwick,\r\nMr. Lyell, and most authors believe, that the constituent parts of each\r\nlayer were separately deposited as sediment, and then metamorphosed.\r\nThis view, in the majority of cases, I believe to be quite untenable.\r\nIn those not uncommon instances, where a mass of clay-slate, in\r\napproaching granite, gradually passes into gneiss,[34] we clearly see\r\nthat folia of distinct minerals can originate through the metamorphosis\r\nof a homogeneous fissile rock. The deposition, it may be remarked, of\r\nnumberless alternations of pure quartz, and of the elements of mica or\r\nfeldspar does not appear a probable event.[35] In those districts in\r\nwhich the metamorphic schists are foliated in planes parallel to the\r\ncleavage of the rocks in an adjoining district, are we to believe that\r\nthe folia are due to sedimentary layers, whilst the cleavage-laminæ,\r\nthough parallel, have no relation whatever to such planes of\r\ndeposition? On this view, how can we reconcile the vastness of the\r\nareas over which the strike of the foliation is uniform, with what we\r\nsee in disturbed districts composed of true strata: and especially, how\r\ncan we understand the high and even vertical dip throughout many wide\r\ndistricts, which are not mountainous, and throughout some, as in\r\nWestern Banda Oriental, which are not even hilly? Are we to admit that\r\nin the northern part of the Chonos Archipelago, mica-slate was first\r\naccumulated in parallel horizontal folia to a thickness of about four\r\ngeographical miles, and then upturned at an angle of forty degrees;\r\nwhilst, in the southern part of this same Archipelago, the\r\ncleavage-laminæ of closely allied rocks, which none would imagine had\r\never been horizontal, dip at nearly the same angle, to nearly the same\r\npoint?\r\n\r\n [34] I have described in “Volcanic Islands” a good instance of such a\r\n passage at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n [35] See some excellent remarks on this subject, in D’Aubuisson’s\r\n “Traité de Géog.,” tome i, p. 297. Also some remarks by Mr. Dana in\r\n _Silliman’s American Journ.,_ vol. xlv, p. 108.\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that foliated schists indisputably are sometimes produced\r\nby the metamorphosis of homogeneous fissile rocks; seeing that\r\nfoliation and cleavage are so closely analogous in the several\r\nabove-enumerated respects; seeing that some fissile and almost\r\nhomogeneous rocks show incipient mineralogical changes along the planes\r\nof their cleavage, and that other rocks with a fissile structure\r\nalternate with, and pass into varieties with a foliated structure, I\r\ncannot doubt that in most cases foliation and cleavage are parts of the\r\nsame process: in cleavage there being only an incipient separation of\r\nthe constituent minerals; in foliation a much more complete separation\r\nand crystallisation.\r\n\r\nThe fact often referred to in this chapter, of the foliation and the\r\nso-called strata in the metamorphic series,—that is, the alternating\r\nmasses of different varieties of gneiss, mica-schist, and\r\nhornblende-slate, etc.,—being parallel to each other, at first appears\r\nquite opposed to the view, that the folia have no relation to the\r\nplanes of original deposition. Where the so-called beds are not very\r\nthick and of widely different mineralogical composition from each\r\nother, I do not think that there is any difficulty in supposing that\r\nthey have originated in an analogous manner with the separate folia. We\r\nshould bear in mind what thick strata, in ordinary sedimentary masses,\r\nhave obviously been formed by a concretionary process. In a pile of\r\nvolcanic rocks on the Island of Ascension, there are strata, differing\r\nquite as much in appearance as the ordinary varieties of the\r\nmetamorphic schists, which undoubtedly have been produced, not by\r\nsuccessive flowings of lava, but by internal molecular changes. Near\r\nMonte Video, where the stratification, as it would be called, of the\r\nmetamorphic series is, in most parts, particularly well developed,\r\nbeing as usual, parallel to the foliation, we have seen that a mass of\r\nchloritic schist, netted with quartz-veins, is entangled in gneiss, in\r\nsuch a manner as to show that it had certainly originated in some\r\nprocess of segregation: again, in another spot, the gneiss tended to\r\npass into hornblendic schist by alternating with layers of quartz; but\r\nthese layers of quartz almost certainly had never been separately\r\ndeposited, for they were absolutely continuous with the numerous\r\nintersecting veins of quartz. I have never had an opportunity of\r\ntracing for any distance, along the line both of strike and of dip, the\r\nso-called beds in the metamorphic schists, but I strongly suspect that\r\nthey would not be found to extend with the same character, very far in\r\nthe line either of their dip or strike. Hence I am led to believe, that\r\nmost of the so-called beds are of the nature of complex folia, and have\r\nnot been separately deposited. Of course, this view cannot be extended\r\nto _thick_ masses included in the metamorphic series, which are of\r\ntotally different composition from the adjoining schists, and which are\r\nfar extended, as is sometimes the case with quartz and marble; these\r\nmust generally be of the nature of true\r\nstrata.[36] Such strata, however, will almost always strike in the same\r\ndirection with the folia, owing to the axes of elevation being in most\r\ncountries parallel to the strike of the foliation; but they will\r\ngenerally dip at a different angle from that of the foliation; and the\r\nangle of the foliation in itself almost always varies much: hence, in\r\ncrossing a metamorphosed schistose district, it would require especial\r\nattention to discriminate between true strata of deposition and complex\r\nfoliated masses. The mere presence of true strata in the midst of a set\r\nof metamorphic schists, is no argument that the foliation is of\r\nsedimentary origin, without it be further shown in each case, that the\r\nfolia not only strike, but dip throughout in parallel planes with those\r\nof the true stratification.\r\n\r\n [36] Macculloch states (“Classification of Rocks,” p. 364) states that\r\n primary limestones are often found in irregular masses or great\r\n nodules, “which can scarcely be said to possess a stratified shape!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in some cases it appears that where a fissile rock has been exposed\r\nto partial metamorphic action, for instance from the irruption of\r\ngranite, the foliation has supervened on the already existing\r\ncleavage-planes; so perhaps in some instances, the foliation of a rock\r\nmay have been determined by the original planes of deposition or of\r\noblique current-laminæ: I have, however, myself, never seen such a\r\ncase, and I must maintain that in most extensive metamorphic areas, the\r\nfoliation is the extreme result of that process, of which cleavage is\r\nthe first effect. That foliation may arise without any previous\r\nstructural arrangement in the mass, we may infer from injected, and\r\ntherefore once liquified, rocks, both of volcanic and plutonic origin,\r\nsometimes having a “grain” (as expressed by Professor Sedgwick), and\r\nsometimes being composed of distinct folia or laminæ of different\r\ncompositions. In my work on “Volcanic Islands,” I have given several\r\ninstances of this structure in volcanic rocks, and it is not uncommonly\r\nseen in plutonic masses—thus, in the Cordillera of Chile, there are\r\ngigantic mountain-like masses of red granite, which have been injected\r\nwhilst liquified, and which, nevertheless, display in parts a decidedly\r\nlaminar structure.[37]\r\n\r\n [37] As remarked in a former part of this chapter, I suspect that the\r\n boldly conical mountains of gneiss-granite, near Rio de Janeiro, in\r\n which the constituent minerals are arranged in parallel planes, are of\r\n intrusive origin. We must not, however, forget the lesson of caution\r\n taught by the curious claystone porphyries of Port Desire, in which we\r\n have seen that the breaking up and aggregation of a thinly stratified\r\n tufaceous mass, has yielded a rock semi-porphyritic with crystals of\r\n feldspar, arranged in the planes of original deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that the planes of cleavage and of foliation,\r\nthat is, of the incipient process and of the final result, generally\r\nstrike parallel to the principal axes of elevation, and to the outline\r\nof the land: the strike of the axes of elevation (that is, of the lines\r\nof fissures with the strata on their edges upturned), according to the\r\nreasoning of Mr. Hopkins, is determined by the form of the area\r\nundergoing changes of level, and the consequent direction of the lines\r\nof tension and fissure. Now, in that remarkable pile of volcanic rocks\r\nat Ascension, which has\r\nseveral times been alluded to (and in some other cases), I have\r\nendeavoured to show,[38] that the lamination of the several varieties,\r\nand their alternations, have been caused by the moving mass, just\r\nbefore its final consolidation, having been subjected (as in a glacier)\r\nto planes of different tension; this difference in the tension\r\naffecting the crystalline and concretionary processes. One of the\r\nvarieties of rock thus produced at Ascension, at first sight,\r\nsingularly resembles a fine-grained gneiss; it consists of quite\r\nstraight and parallel zones of excessive tenuity, of more or less\r\ncoloured crystallised feldspar, of distinct crystals of quartz,\r\ndiopside, and oxide of iron. These considerations, notwithstanding the\r\nexperiments made by Mr. Fox, showing the influence of electrical\r\ncurrents in producing a structure like that of cleavage, and\r\nnotwithstanding the apparently inexplicable variation, both in the\r\ninclination of the cleavage-laminæ and in their dipping first to one\r\nside and then to the other side of the line of strike, lead me to\r\nsuspect that the planes of cleavage and foliation are intimately\r\nconnected with the planes of different tension, to which the area was\r\nlong subjected, _after_ the main fissures or axes of upheavement had\r\nbeen formed, but _before_ the final consolidation of the mass and the\r\ntotal cessation of all molecular movement.\r\n\r\n [38] In “Volcanic Islands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geological sections through the Cordilleras.]\r\n\r\nFor enlargements of the above plate use the following links:\r\nleft section\r\ncenter section\r\nright section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII CENTRAL CHILE:—STRUCTURE OF THE CORDILLERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Chile.—Basal formations of the Cordillera.—Origin of the\r\nporphyritic clay-stone conglomerate.—Andesite.—Volcanic rocks.—Section\r\nof the Cordillera by the Peuquenes are Portillo Pass.—Great gypseous\r\nformation.—Peuquenes line; thickness of strata, fossils of.—Portillo\r\nline.—Conglomerate, orthitic granite, mica-schist, volcanic rocks\r\nof.—Concluding remarks on the denudation and elevation of the Portillo\r\nline.—Section by the Cumbre, or Uspallata Pass.—Porphyries.—Gypseous\r\nstrata.—Section near the Puente del Inca; fossils of.—Great\r\nsubsidence.—Intrusive porphyries.—Plain of Uspallata.—Section of the\r\nUspallata chain.—Structure and nature of the strata.—Silicified\r\nvertical trees.—Great subsidence.—Granitic rocks of axis.—Concluding\r\nremarks on the Uspallata range; origin subsequent to that of the main\r\nCordillera; two periods of subsidence; comparison with the Portillo\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district between the Cordillera and the Pacific, on a rude average,\r\nis from about eighty to one hundred miles in width. It is crossed by\r\nmany chains of mountains, of which the principal ones, in the latitude\r\nof Valparaiso and southward of it, range nearly north and south; but in\r\nthe more northern parts of the province, they run in almost every\r\npossible direction. Near the Pacific, the mountain-ranges are generally\r\nformed of syenite or granite, and or of an allied euritic porphyry; in\r\nthe low country, besides these granitic rocks and greenstone, and much\r\ngneiss, there are, especially northward of Valparaiso, some\r\nconsiderable districts of true clay-slate with quartz veins, passing\r\ninto a feldspathic and porphyritic slate; there is also some grauwacke\r\nand quartzose and jaspery rocks, the latter occasionally assuming the\r\ncharacter of the basis of claystone porphyry: trap-dikes are numerous.\r\nNearer the Cordillera the ranges (such as those of S. Fernando, the\r\nPrado,[1] and Aconcagua) are formed partly of granitic rocks, and\r\npartly of purple porphyritic conglomerates, claystone porphyry,\r\ngreenstone porphyry, and other rocks, such as we shall immediately see,\r\nform the basal strata of the main Cordillera. In the more northern\r\nparts of Chile, this porphyritic series extends over large tracts of\r\ncountry far from the Cordillera; and even in Central Chile such\r\noccasionally occur in outlying positions.\r\n\r\n [1] Meyen “Reise um Erde” Th. I, s. 235.\r\n\r\nI will describe the Campana of Quillota, which stands only fifteen\r\nmiles from the Pacific, as an instance of one of these outlying masses.\r\nThis hill is conspicuous from rising to the height of 6,400 feet: its\r\nsummit shows a nucleus, uncovered for a height of 800 feet, of fine\r\ngreenstone, including epidote and octahedral magnetic iron ore; its\r\nflanks are formed of great strata of porphyritic claystone conglomerate\r\nassociated with various true porphyries and amygdaloids, alternating\r\nwith thick masses of a highly feldspathic, sometimes porphyritic,\r\npale-coloured slaty rock, with its cleavage-laminæ dipping inwards at a\r\nhigh angle. At the base of the hill there are syenites, a granular\r\nmixture of quartz and feldspar, and harsh quartzose rocks, all\r\nbelonging to the basal metamorphic series. I may observe that at the\r\nfoot of several hills of this class, where the porphyries are first\r\nseen (as near S. Fernando, the Prado, Las Vacas, etc.), similar harsh\r\nquartzose rocks and granular mixtures of quartz and feldspar occur, as\r\nif the more fusible constituent parts of the granitic series had been\r\ndrawn off to form the overlying porphyries.\r\n\r\nIn Central Chile, the flanks of the main Cordillera, into which I\r\npenetrated by four different valleys, generally consist of distinctly\r\nstratified rocks. The strata are inclined at angles varying from\r\nsometimes even under ten, to twenty degrees, very rarely exceeding\r\nforty degrees: in some, however, of the quite small, exterior,\r\nspur-like ridges, the inclination was not unfrequently greater. The dip\r\nof the strata in the main outer lines was usually outwards or from the\r\nCordillera, but in Northern Chile frequently inwards,—that is, their\r\nbasset-edges fronted the Pacific. Dikes occur in extraordinary numbers.\r\nIn the great, central, loftiest ridges, the strata, as we shall\r\npresently see, are almost always highly inclined and often vertical.\r\nBefore giving a detailed account of my two sections across the\r\nCordillera, it will, I think, be convenient to describe the basal\r\nstrata as seen, often to a thickness of four or five thousand feet, on\r\nthe flanks of the outer lines.\r\n\r\n_Basal strata of the Cordillera._—The prevailing rock is a purplish or\r\ngreenish, porphyritic claystone conglomerate. The embedded fragments\r\nvary in size from mere particles to blocks as much as six or eight\r\ninches (rarely more) in diameter; in many places, where the fragments\r\nwere minute, the signs of aqueous deposition were unequivocally\r\ndistinct; where they were large, such evidence could rarely be\r\ndetected. The basis is generally porphyritic with perfect crystals of\r\nfeldspar, and resembles that of a true injected claystone porphyry:\r\noften, however, it has a mechanical or sedimentary aspect, and\r\nsometimes (as at Jajuel) is jaspery. The included fragments are either\r\nangular, or partially or quite rounded;[2] in some parts the rounded,\r\nin others the angular fragments prevail, and usually both kinds are\r\nmixed together: hence the word _breccia_ ought strictly to be appended\r\nto the term _porphyritic conglomerate._ The fragments consist of many\r\nvarieties of claystone porphyry, usually of nearly the same colour with\r\nthe surrounding basis, namely, purplish-reddish, brownish, mottled or\r\nbright green; occasionally fragments of a laminated, pale-coloured,\r\nfeldspathic rock, like altered clay-slate are included; as are\r\nsometimes grains of quartz, but only in one instance in Central Chile\r\n(namely, at the mines of Jajuel) a few pebbles of quartz. I nowhere\r\nobserved mica in this formation, and rarely hornblende; where the\r\nlatter mineral did occur, I was generally in doubt whether the mass\r\nreally belonged to this formation, or was of intrusive origin.\r\nCalcareous spar occasionally occurs in small cavities; and nests and\r\nlayers of epidote are common. In some few places in the finer-grained\r\nvarieties (for instance, at Quillota), there were short, interrupted\r\nlayers of earthy feldspar, which could be traced, exactly as at Port\r\nDesire, passing into large crystals of feldspar: I doubt, however,\r\nwhether in this instance the layers had ever been separately deposited\r\nas tufaceous sediment.\r\n\r\n [2] Some of the rounded fragments in the porphyritic conglomerate near\r\n the Baths of Cauquenes, were marked with radii and concentric zones of\r\n different shades of colour: any one who did not know that pebbles, for\r\n instance flint pebbles from the chalk, are sometimes zoned\r\n concentrically with their worn and rounded surfaces, might have been\r\n led to infer, that these balls of porphyry were not true pebbles, but\r\n had originated in concretionary action.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of porphyritic conglomerates and breccias pass into\r\neach other, and by innumerable gradations into porphyries no longer\r\nretaining the least trace of mechanical origin: the transition appears\r\nto have been effected much more easily in the finer-grained, than in\r\nthe coarser-grained varieties. In one instance, near Cauquenes, I\r\nnoticed that a porphyritic conglomerate assumed a spheroidal structure,\r\nand tended to become columnar. Besides the porphyritic conglomerates\r\nand the perfectly characterised porphyries, of metamorphic origin,\r\nthere are other porphyries, which, though differing not at all or only\r\nslightly in composition, certainly have had a different origin: these\r\nconsist of pink or purple claystone porphyries, sometimes including\r\ngrains of quartz,—of greenstone porphyry, and of other dusky rocks, all\r\ngenerally porphyritic with fine, large, tabular, opaque crystals, often\r\nplaced crosswise, of feldspar cleaving like albite (judging from\r\nseveral measurements), and often amygdaloidal with silex, agate,\r\ncarbonate of\r\nlime, green and brown bole.[3] These several porphyritic and\r\namygdaloidal varieties never show any signs of passing into masses of\r\nsedimentary origin: they occur both in great and small intrusive\r\nmasses, and likewise in strata alternating with those of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, and with the planes of junction often quite\r\ndistinct, yet not seldom blended together. In some of these intrusive\r\nmasses, the porphyries exhibit, more or less plainly, a brecciated\r\nstructure, like that often seen in volcanic masses. These brecciated\r\nporphyries could generally be distinguished at once from the\r\nmetamorphosed, porphyritic breccia-conglomerates, by all the fragments\r\nbeing angular and being formed of the same variety, and by the absence\r\nof every trace of aqueous deposition. One of the porphyries above\r\nspecified, namely, the greenstone porphyry with large tabular crystals\r\nof albite, is particularly abundant, and in some parts of the\r\nCordillera (as near St. Jago) seemed more common even than the purplish\r\nporphyritic conglomerate. Numerous dikes likewise consist of this\r\ngreenstone porphyry; others are formed of various fine-grained trappean\r\nrocks; but very few of claystone porphyry: I saw no true basaltic\r\ndikes.\r\n\r\n [3] This bole is a very common mineral in the amygdaloidal rocks; it\r\n is generally of a greenish-brown colour, with a radiating structure;\r\n externally it is black with an almost metallic lustre, but often\r\n coated by a bright green film. It is soft and can be scratched by a\r\n quill; under the blowpipe swells greatly and becomes scaly, then fuses\r\n easily into a black magnetic bead. This substance is evidently similar\r\n to that which often occurs in submarine volcanic rocks. An examination\r\n of some very curious specimens of a fine porphyry (from Jajuel) leads\r\n me to suspect that some of these amygdaloidal balls, instead of having\r\n been deposited in pre-existing air-vesicles, are of concretionary\r\n origin; for in these specimens, some of the pea-shaped little masses\r\n (often externally marked with minute pits) are formed of a mixture of\r\n green earth with stony matter, like the basis of the porphyry,\r\n including minute imperfect crystals of feldspar; and these pea-shaped\r\n little masses are themselves amygdaloidal with minute spheres of the\r\n green earth, each enveloped by a film of white, apparently\r\n feldspathic, earthy matter: so that the porphyry is doubly\r\n amygdaloidal. It should not, however, be overlooked, that all the\r\n strata here have undergone metamorphic action, which may have caused\r\n crystals of feldspar to appear, and other changes to be effected, in\r\n the originally simple amygdaloidal balls. Mr. J. D. Dana, in an\r\n excellent paper on Trap-rocks (_Edin. New Phil. Journ.,_ vol. xli, p.\r\n 198), has argued with great force, that all amygdaloidal minerals have\r\n been deposited by aqueous infiltration. I may take this opportunity of\r\n alluding to a curious case, described in my work on “Volcanic\r\n Islands,” of an amygdaloid with many of its cells only half filled up\r\n with a mesotypic mineral.\r\n    M. Rose has described an amygdaloid, brought by Dr. Meyen (“Reise\r\n    um Erde,” Th. I, s. 316) from Chile, as consisting of crystallised\r\n    quartz, with crystals of stilbite within, and lined externally by\r\n    green earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn several places in the lower part of the series, but not everywhere,\r\nthick masses of a highly feldspathic, often porphyritic, slaty rock\r\noccur interstratified with the porphyritic conglomerate; I believe in\r\none or two cases blackish limestone has been found in a similar\r\nposition. The feldspathic rock is of a pale grey or greenish colour; it\r\nis easily fusible;\r\nwhere porphyritic, the crystals of feldspar are generally small and\r\nvitreous: it is distinctly laminated, and sometimes includes parallel\r\nlayers of epidote;[4] the lamination appears to be distinct from\r\nstratification. Occasionally this rock is somewhat curious; and at one\r\nspot, namely, at the C. of Quillota, it had a brecciated structure.\r\nNear the mines of Jajuel, in a thick stratum of this feldspathic,\r\nporphyritic slate, there was a layer of hard, blackish, siliceous,\r\ninfusible, compact clay-slate, such as I saw nowhere else; at the same\r\nplace I was able to follow for a considerable distance the junction\r\nbetween the slate and the conformably underlying porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and they certainly passed gradually into each other.\r\nWherever these slaty feldspathic rocks abound, greenstone seems common;\r\nat the C. of Quillota a bed of well-crystallised greenstone lay\r\nconformably in the midst of the feldspathic slate, with the upper and\r\nlower junctions passing insensibly into it. From this point, and from\r\nthe frequently porphyritic condition of the slate, I should perhaps\r\nhave considered this rock as an erupted one (like certain laminated\r\nfeldspathic lavas in the trachytic series), had I not seen in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego how readily true clay-slate becomes feldspathic and\r\nporphyritic, and had I not seen at Jajuel the included layer of black,\r\nsiliceous clay-slate, which no one could have thought of igneous\r\norigin. The gentle passage of the feldspathic slate, at Jajuel, into\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate, which is certainly of aqueous origin,\r\nshould also be taken in account.\r\n\r\n [4] This mineral is extremely common in all the formations of Chile;\r\n in the gneiss near Valparaiso and in the granitic veins crossing it,\r\n in the injected greenstone crowning the C. of Quillota, in some\r\n granitic porphyries, in the porphyritic conglomerate, and in the\r\n feldspathic clay-slates.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternating strata of porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate, and\r\nwith the occasionally included beds of feldspathic slate, together make\r\na grand formation; in several places within the Cordillera, I estimated\r\nits thickness at from six to seven thousand feet. It extends for many\r\nhundred miles, forming the western flank of the Chilean Cordillera; and\r\neven at Iquique in Peru, 850 miles north of the southernmost point\r\nexamined by me in Chile, the coast-escarpment which rises to a height\r\nof between two and three thousand feet is thus composed. In several\r\nparts of Northern Chile this formation extends much further towards the\r\nPacific, over the granitic and metamorphic lower rocks, than it does in\r\nCentral Chile; but the main Cordillera may be considered as its central\r\nline, and its breadth in an east and west direction is never great. At\r\nfirst the origin of this thick, massive, long but narrow formation,\r\nappeared to me very anomalous: whence were derived, and how were\r\ndispersed the innumerable fragments, often of large size, sometimes\r\nangular and sometimes rounded, and almost invariably composed of\r\nporphyritic rocks? Seeing that the interstratified porphyries are never\r\nvesicular and often not even amygdaloidal, we must conclude that the\r\npile was formed in deep water; how then came so many fragments to be\r\nwell rounded and so many to remain angular, sometimes the two kinds\r\nbeing equally mingled, sometimes one and sometimes the other\r\npreponderating? That the claystone,\r\ngreenstone, and other porphyries and amygdaloids, which lie\r\n_conformably_ between the beds of conglomerate, are ancient submarine\r\nlavas, I think there can be no doubt; and I believe we must look to the\r\ncraters whence these streams were erupted, as the source of the\r\nbreccia-conglomerate; after the great explosion, we may fairly imagine\r\nthat the water in the heated and scarcely quiescent crater would remain\r\nfor a considerable time[5] sufficiently agitated to triturate and round\r\nthe loose fragments, few or many in number, would be shot forth at the\r\nnext eruption, associated with few or many angular fragments, according\r\nto the strength of the explosion. The porphyritic conglomerate being\r\npurple or reddish, even when alternating with dusty-coloured or bright\r\ngreen porphyries and amygdaloids, is probably an analogous circumstance\r\nto the scoriæ of the blackish basalts being often bright red. The\r\nancient submarine orifices whence the porphyries and their fragments\r\nwere ejected having been arranged in a band, like most still active\r\nvolcanoes, accounts for the thickness, the narrowness, and linear\r\nextension of this formation.\r\n\r\n [5] This certainly seems to have taken place in some recent volcanic\r\n archipelagos, as at the Galapagos, where numerous craters are\r\n exclusively formed of tuff and fragments of lava.\r\n\r\nThis whole great pile of rock has suffered much metamorphic action, as\r\nis very obvious in the gradual formation and appearance of the crystals\r\nof albitic feldspar and of epidote—in the bending together of the\r\nfragments—in the appearance of a laminated structure in the feldspathic\r\nslate—and, lastly, in the disappearance of the planes of\r\nstratification, which could sometimes be seen on the same mountain\r\nquite distinct in the upper part, less and less plain on the flanks,\r\nand quite obliterated at the base. Partly owing to this metamorphic\r\naction, and partly to the close relationship in origin, I have seen\r\nfragments of porphyries—taken from a metamorphosed conglomerate—from a\r\nneighbouring stream of lava—from the nucleus or centre (as it appeared\r\nto me) of the whole submarine volcano—and lastly from an intrusive mass\r\nof quite subsequent origin, all of which were absolutely\r\nundistinguishable in external characters.\r\n\r\nOne other rock, of plutonic origin, and highly important in the history\r\nof the Cordillera, from having been injected in most of the great axes\r\nof elevation, and from having apparently been instrumental in\r\nmetamorphosing the superincumbent strata, may be conveniently described\r\nin this preliminary discussion. It has been called by some authors\r\n_Andesite_: it mainly consists of well-crystallised white albite[6] (as\r\ndetermined with the goniometer in numerous specimens both by\r\nProfessor Miller and myself), of less perfectly crystallised green\r\nhornblende, often associated with much mica, with chlorite and epidote,\r\nand occasionally with a few grains of quartz: in one instance in\r\nNorthern Chile, I found crystals of orthitic or potash feldspar,\r\nmingled with those of albite. Where the mica and quartz are abundant,\r\nthe rock cannot be distinguished from granite; and it may be called\r\nandesitic granite. Where these two minerals are quite absent, and when,\r\nas often then happens, the crystals of albite are imperfect and blend\r\ntogether, the rock may be called andesitic porphyry, which bears nearly\r\nthe same relation to andesitic granite that euritic porphyry does to\r\ncommon granite. These andesitic rocks form mountain masses of a white\r\ncolour, which, in their general outline and appearance—in their\r\njoints—in their occasionally including dark-coloured, angular\r\nfragments, apparently of some pre-existing rock—and in the great dikes\r\nbranching from them into the superincumbent strata, manifest a close\r\nand striking resemblance to masses of common granite and syenite: I\r\nnever, however, saw in these andesitic rocks, those granitic veins of\r\nsegregation which are so common in true granites. We have seen that\r\nandesite occurs in three places in Tierra del Fuego; in Chile, from S.\r\nFernando to Copiapo, a distance of 450 miles, I found it under most of\r\nthe axes of elevation; in a collection of specimens from the Cordillera\r\nof Lima in Peru, I immediately recognised it; and Erman[7] states that\r\nit occurs in Eastern Kamtschatka. From its wide range, and from the\r\nimportant part it has played in the history of the Cordillera, I think\r\nthis rock has well deserved its distinct name of Andesite.\r\n\r\n [6] I here, and elsewhere, call by this name, those feldspathic\r\n minerals which cleave like albite: but it now appears (_Edin. New\r\n Phil. Journal.,_ vol. xxiv, p. 181) that Abich has analysed a mineral\r\n from the Cordillera, associated with hornblende and quartz (probably\r\n the same rock with that here under discussion), which cleaves like\r\n albite, but which is a new and distinct kind, called by him\r\n _Andesine._ It is allied to leucite, with the greater proportion of\r\n its potash replaced by lime and soda. This mineral seems scarcely\r\n distinguishable from albite, except by analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] _Geograph. Journal,_ vol. ix, p. 510.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe few still active volcanoes in Chile are confined to the central and\r\nloftiest ranges of the Cordillera; and volcanic matter, such as appears\r\nto have been of subaerial eruption, is everywhere rare. According to\r\nMeyen,[8] there is a hill of pumice high up the valley of the Maypu,\r\nand likewise a trachytic formation at Colina, a village situated north\r\nof St. Jago. Close to this latter city, there are two hills formed of a\r\npale feldspathic porphyry, remarkable from being doubly columnar, great\r\ncylindrical columns being subdivided into smaller four- or five-sided\r\nones; and a third hillock (Cerro Blanco) is formed of a fragmentary\r\nmass of rock, which I believed to be of volcanic origin, intermediate\r\nin character between the above feldspathic porphyry and common\r\ntrachyte, and containing needles of hornblende and granular oxide of\r\niron. Near the Baths of Cauquenes, between two short parallel lines of\r\nelevation, where they are intersected by the valley, there is a small,\r\nthough distinct volcanic district; the rock is a dark grey (andesitic)\r\ntrachyte, which fuses into a greenish-grey bead, and is formed of long\r\ncrystals of fractured glassy albite (judging from one measurement)\r\nmingled with well-formed crystals, often twin, of augite. The whole\r\nmass is vesicular, but the surface is darker coloured and much more\r\nvesicular than any other part. This trachyte forms a cliff-bounded,\r\nhorizontal, narrow strip on the steep southern side of the valley, at\r\nthe height of four or five hundred feet above the river-bed; judging\r\nfrom an apparently\r\ncorresponding line of cliff on the northern side, the valley must once\r\nhave been filled up to this height by a field of lava. On the summit of\r\na lofty mountain some leagues higher up this same valley of the\r\nCachapual, I found columnar pitchstone porphyritic with feldspar; I do\r\nnot suppose this rock to be of volcanic origin, and only mention it\r\nhere, from its being intersected by masses and dikes of a _vesicular_\r\nrock, approaching in character to trachyte; in no other part of Chile\r\ndid I observe vesicular or amygdaloidal dikes, though these are so\r\ncommon in ordinary volcanic districts.\r\n\r\n [8] “Reise um Erde,” Th. I, ss. 338 and 362.\r\n\r\n_Passage of the Andes by the Portillo or Pequenes Pass._\r\n\r\nAlthough I crossed the Cordillera only once by this pass, and only once\r\nby that of the Cumbre or Uspallata (presently to be described), riding\r\nslowly and halting occasionally to ascend the mountains, there are many\r\ncircumstances favourable to obtaining a more faithful sketch of their\r\nstructure than would at first be thought possible from so short an\r\nexamination. The mountains are steep and absolutely bare of vegetation;\r\nthe atmosphere is resplendently clear; the stratification distinct; and\r\nthe rocks brightly and variously coloured: some of the natural sections\r\nmight be truly compared for distinctness to those coloured ones in\r\ngeological works. Considering how little is known of the structure of\r\nthis gigantic range, to which I particularly attended, most travellers\r\nhaving collected only specimens of the rocks, I think my\r\nsketch-sections, though necessarily imperfect, possess some interest.\r\nPlate V sections (between  and 441) which I will now describe in\r\ndetail, is on a horizontal scale of a third of an inch to a nautical\r\nmile, and on a vertical scale of one inch to a mile (or 6,000 feet).\r\nThe width of the range (excluding a few outlying hillocks), from the\r\nplain on which St. Jago the capital of Chile stands, to the Pampas, is\r\nsixty miles, as far as I can judge from the maps, which differ from\r\neach other and are all _ exceedingly_ imperfect. The St. Jago plain at\r\nthe mouth of the Maypu, I estimate from adjoining known points at 2,300\r\nfeet, and the Pampas at 3,500 feet, both above the level of the sea.\r\nThe height of the Pequenes line, according to Dr. Gillies,[9] is 13,210\r\nfeet; and that of the Portillo line (both in the gaps where the road\r\ncrosses them) is 14,345 feet; the lowest part of the intermediate\r\nvalley of Tenuyan is 7,530 feet—all above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n [9] _Journal of Nat. and Geograph. Science,_ August 1830.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera here, and indeed I believe throughout Chile, consist of\r\nseveral parallel, anticlinal and uniclinal mountain-lines, ranging\r\nnorth, or north with a little westing, and south. Some exterior and\r\nmuch lower ridges often vary considerably from this course, projecting\r\nlike oblique spurs from the main ranges: in the district towards the\r\nPacific, the mountains, as before remarked, extend in various\r\ndirections, even east and west. In the main exterior lines, the strata,\r\nas also before remarked, are seldom inclined at a high angle; but in\r\nthe central lofty ridges they are almost always highly inclined, broken\r\nby many\r\ngreat faults, and often vertical. As far as I could judge, few of the\r\nranges are of great length: and in the central parts of the Cordillera,\r\nI was frequently able to follow with my eye a ridge gradually becoming\r\nhigher and higher, as the stratification increased in inclination, from\r\none end where its height was trifling and its strata gently inclined to\r\nthe other end where vertical strata formed snow-clad pinnacles. Even\r\noutside the main Cordillera, near the baths of Cauquenes, I observed\r\none such case, where a north and south ridge had its strata in the\r\nvalley inclined at 37°, and less than a mile south of it at 67°:\r\nanother parallel and similarly inclined ridge rose at the distance of\r\nabout five miles, into a lofty mountain with absolutely vertical\r\nstrata. Within the Cordillera, the height of the ridges and the\r\ninclination of the strata often became doubled and trebled in much\r\nshorter distances than five miles; this peculiar form of upheaval\r\nprobably indicates that the stratified crust was thin, and hence\r\nyielded to the underlying intrusive masses unequally, at certain points\r\non the lines of fissure.\r\n\r\nThe valleys, by which the Cordillera are drained, follow the anticlinal\r\nor rarely synclinal troughs, which deviate most from the usual north\r\nand south course; or still more commonly those lines of faults or of\r\nunequal curvature (that is, lines with the strata on both hands dipping\r\nin the same direction, but at a somewhat different angle) which deviate\r\nmost from a northerly course. Occasionally the torrents run for some\r\ndistance in the north and south valleys, and then recover their eastern\r\nor western course by bursting through the ranges at those points where\r\nthe strata have been least inclined and the height consequently is\r\nless. Hence the valleys, along which the roads run, are generally\r\nzigzag; and, in drawing an east and west section, it is necessary to\r\ncontract greatly that which is actually seen on the road.\r\n\r\nCommencing at the western end of our section [Plate V] where the R.\r\nMaypu debouches on the plain of St. Jago, we immediately enter on the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation, and in the midst of it find some\r\nhummocks [A] of granite and syenite, which probably (for I neglected to\r\ncollect specimens) belong to the andesitic class. These are succeeded\r\nby some rugged hills [B] of dark-green, crystalline, feldspathic and in\r\nsome parts slaty rocks, which I believe belong to the altered\r\nclay-slate formation. From this point, great mountains of purplish and\r\ngreenish, generally thinly stratified, highly porphyritic\r\nconglomerates, including many strata of amygdaloidal and greenstone\r\nporphyries, extend up the valley to the junction of the rivers Yeso and\r\nVolcan. As the valley here runs in a very southerly course, the width\r\nof the porphyritic conglomerate formation is quite conjectural; and\r\nfrom the same cause, I was unable to make out much about the\r\nstratification. In most of the exterior mountains the dip was gentle\r\nand directed inwards; and at only one spot I observed an inclination as\r\nhigh as 50°. Near the junction of the R. Colorado with the main stream,\r\nthere is a hill of whitish, brecciated, partially decomposed\r\nfeldspathic porphyry, having a volcanic aspect but not being really of\r\nthat nature: at Tolla, however, in this valley, Dr. Meyen[10] met with\r\na hill\r\nof pumice containing mica. At the junction of the Yeso and Volcan [D]\r\nthere is an extensive mass, in white conical hillocks, of andesite,\r\ncontaining some mica, and passing either into andesitic granite, or\r\ninto a spotted, semi-granular mixture of albitic (?) feldspar and\r\nhornblende: in the midst of this formation Dr. Meyen found true\r\ntrachyte. The andesite is covered by strata of dark-coloured,\r\ncrystalline, obscurely porphyritic rocks, and above them by the\r\nordinary porphyritic conglomerates,—the strata all dipping away at a\r\nsmall angle from the underlying mass. The surrounding lofty mountains\r\nappear to be entirely composed of the porphyritic conglomerate, and I\r\nestimated its thickness here at between six and seven thousand feet.\r\n\r\n [10] “Reise um Erde,” Th. I, ss. 338, 341.)\r\n\r\nBeyond the junction of the Yeso and Volcan, the porphyritic strata\r\nappear to dip towards the hillocks of andesite at an angle of 40°; but\r\nat some distant points on the same ridge they are bent up and vertical.\r\nFollowing the valley of the Yeso, trending N.E. (and therefore still\r\nunfavourable for our transverse section), the same porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation is prolonged to near the Cuestadel Indio,\r\nsituated at the western end of the basin (like a drained lake) of Yeso.\r\nSome way before arriving at this point, distant lofty pinnacles capped\r\nby coloured strata belonging to the great gypseous formation could\r\nfirst be seen. From the summit of the Cuesta, looking southward, there\r\nis a magnificent sectional view of a mountain-mass, at least 2,000 feet\r\nin thickness [E], of fine andesite granite (containing much black mica,\r\na little chlorite and quartz), which sends great white dikes far into\r\nthe superincumbent, dark-coloured, porphyritic conglomerates. At the\r\nline of junction the two formations are wonderfully interlaced\r\ntogether: in the lower part of the porphyritic conglomerate, the\r\nstratification has been quite obliterated, whilst in the upper part it\r\nis very distinct, the beds composing the crests of the surrounding\r\nmountains being inclined at angles of between 70 and 80 degrees, and\r\nsome being even vertical. On the northern side of the valley, there is\r\na great corresponding mass of andesitic granite, which is encased by\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, dipping both on the western and eastern\r\nsides, at about 80° to west, but on the eastern side with the tips of\r\nthe strata bent in such a manner, as to render it probable that the\r\nwhole mass has been on that side thrown over and inverted.\r\n\r\nIn the valley basin of the Yeso, which I estimated at 7,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, we first reach at [F] the gypseous formation. Its\r\nthickness is very great. It consists in most parts of snow-white, hard,\r\ncompact gypsum, which breaks with a saccharine fracture, having\r\ntranslucent edges; under the blowpipe gives out much vapour; it\r\nfrequently includes nests and exceedingly thin layers of crystallised,\r\nblackish carbonate of lime. Large, irregularly shaped concretions\r\n(externally still exhibiting lines of aqueous deposition) of\r\nblackish-grey, but sometimes white, coarsely and brilliantly\r\ncrystallised, hard anhydrite, abound within the common gypsum.\r\nHillocks, formed of the hardest and purest varieties of the white\r\ngypsum, stand up above the surrounding parts, and have their surfaces\r\ncracked and marked, just like newly baked bread. There is much pale\r\nbrown, soft argillaceous\r\ngypsum; and there were some intercalated green beds which I had not\r\ntime to reach. I saw only one fragment of selenite or transparent\r\ngypsum, and that perhaps may have come from some subsequently formed\r\nvein. From the mineralogical characters here given, it is probable that\r\nthese gypseous beds have undergone some metamorphic action. The strata\r\nare much hidden by detritus, but they appeared in most parts to be\r\nhighly inclined; and in an adjoining lofty pinnacle they could be\r\ndistinctly seen bending up, and becoming vertical, conformably with the\r\nunderlying porphyritic conglomerate. In very many parts of the great\r\nmountain-face [F], composed of thin gypseous beds, there were\r\ninnumerable masses, irregularly shaped and not like dikes, yet with\r\nwell-defined edges, of an imperfectly granular, pale greenish, or\r\nyellowish-white rock, essentially composed of feldspar, with a little\r\nchlorite or hornblende, epidote, iron-pyrites, and ferruginous powder:\r\nI believe that these curious trappean masses have been injected from\r\nthe not far distant mountain-mass [E] of andesite whilst still fluid,\r\nand that owing to the softness of the gypseous strata they have not\r\nacquired the ordinary forms of dikes. Subsequently to the injection of\r\nthese feldspathic rocks, a great dislocation has taken place; and the\r\nmuch shattered gypseous strata here overlie a hillock [G], composed of\r\nvertical strata of impure limestone and of black highly calcareous\r\nshale including threads of gypsum: these rocks, as we shall presently\r\nsee, belong to the upper parts of the gypseous series, and hence must\r\nhere have been thrown down by a vast fault.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the valley-basin of the Yeso, and taking our section\r\nsometimes on one hand and sometimes on the other, we come to a great\r\nhill of stratified porphyritic conglomerate [H] dipping at 45° to the\r\nwest; and a few hundred yards farther on, we have a bed between three\r\nor four hundred feet thick of gypsum [I] dipping eastward at a very\r\nhigh angle: here then we have a fault and anticlinal axis. On the\r\nopposite side of the valley, a vertical mass of red conglomerate,\r\nconformably underlying the gypsum, appears gradually to lose its\r\nstratification and passes into a mountain of porphyry. The gypsum [I]\r\nis covered by a bed [K], at least 1,000 feet in thickness, of a\r\npurplish-red, compact, heavy, fine-grained sandstone or mudstone, which\r\nfuses easily into a white enamel, and is seen under a lens to contain\r\ntriturated crystals. This is succeeded by a bed [L], 1,000 feet thick\r\n(I believe I understate the thickness) of gypsum, exactly like the beds\r\nbefore described; and this again is capped by another great bed [M] of\r\npurplish-red sandstone. All these strata dip eastward; but the\r\ninclination becomes less and less, as we leave the first and almost\r\nvertical bed [I] of gypsum.\r\n\r\nLeaving the basin-plain of Yeso, the road rapidly ascends, passing by\r\nmountains composed of the gypseous and associated beds, with their\r\nstratification greatly disturbed and therefore not easily intelligible:\r\nhence this part of the section has been left uncoloured. Shortly before\r\nreaching the great Pequenes ridge, the lowest stratum visible [N] is a\r\nred sandstone or mudstone, capped by a vast thickness of black,\r\ncompact, calcareous, shaly rock [O], which has been thrown into four\r\nlofty,\r\nthough small ridges: looking northward, the strata in these ridges are\r\nseen gradually to rise in inclination, becoming in some distant\r\npinnacles absolutely vertical.\r\n\r\nThe ridge of Pequenes, which divides the waters flowing into the\r\nPacific and Atlantic Oceans, extends in a nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E.\r\nline; its strata dip eastward at an angle of between 30° and 45°, but\r\nin the higher peaks bending up and becoming almost vertical. Where the\r\nroad crosses this range, the height is 13,210 feet above the sea-level,\r\nand I estimated the neighbouring pinnacles at from fourteen to fifteen\r\nthousand feet. The lowest stratum visible in this ridge is a red\r\nstratified sandstone [P]; on it are superimposed two great masses [Q\r\nand S] of black, hard, compact, even having a conchoidal fracture,\r\ncalcareous, more or less laminated shale, passing into limestone: this\r\nrock contains organic remains, presently to be enumerated. The\r\ncompacter varieties fuse easily in a white glass; and this I may add is\r\na very general character with all the sedimentary beds in the\r\nCordillera: although this rock when broken is generally quite black, it\r\neverywhere weathers into an ash-grey tint. Between these two great\r\nmasses [Q and S], a bed [R] of gypsum is interposed, about three\r\nhundred feet in thickness, and having the same characters as heretofore\r\ndescribed. I estimated the total thickness of these three beds [Q, R,\r\nS] at nearly three thousand feet; and to this must be added, as will be\r\nimmediately seen, a great overlying mass of red sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn descending the eastern slope of this great central range, the\r\nstrata, which in the upper part dip eastward at about an angle of 40°,\r\nbecome more and more curved, till they are nearly vertical; and a\r\nlittle further onwards there is seen on the further side of a ravine, a\r\nthick mass of strata of bright red sandstone [T], with their upper\r\nextremities slightly curved, showing that they were once conformably\r\nprolonged over the beds [S]: on the southern and opposite side of the\r\nroad, this red sandstone and the underlying black shaly rocks stand\r\nvertical, and in actual juxtaposition. Continuing to descend, we come\r\nto a synclinal valley filled with rubbish, beyond which we have the red\r\nsandstone [T2] corresponding with [T], and now dipping, as is seen both\r\nnorth and south of the road, at 45° to the west; and under it, the beds\r\n[S2, R2, Q2, and I believe P2] in corresponding order and of similar\r\ncomposition, with those on the western flank of the Pequenes range, but\r\ndipping westward. Close to the synclinal valley the dip of these strata\r\nis 45°, but at the eastern or farther end of the series it increases to\r\n60°. Here the great gypseous formation abruptly terminates, and is\r\nsucceeded eastward by a pile of more modern strata. Considering how\r\nviolently these central ranges have been dislocated, and how very\r\nnumerous dikes are in the exterior and lower parts of the Cordillera,\r\nit is remarkable that I did not here notice a single dike. The\r\nprevailing rock in this neighbourhood is the black, calcareous, compact\r\nshale, whilst in the valley-basin of the Yeso the purplish red\r\nsandstone or mudstone predominates,—both being associated with gypseous\r\nstrata of exactly the same nature. It would be very difficult to\r\nascertain the relative superposition of these several masses, for we\r\nshall afterwards see in the Cumbre Pass that\r\nthe gypseous and intercalated beds are lens-shaped, and that they thin\r\nout, even where very thick, and disappear in short horizontal\r\ndistances: it is quite possible that the black shales and red\r\nsandstones may be contemporaneous, but it is more probable that the\r\nformer compose the uppermost parts of the series.\r\n\r\nThe fossils above alluded to in the black calcareous shales are few in\r\nnumber, and are in an imperfect condition; they consist, as named for\r\nme by M. d’Orbigny, of:—\r\n\r\nAmmonite, indeterminable, near to _A. recticostatus,_ d’Orbigny, “Pal.\r\nFranc.” (Neocomian formation).\r\n\r\nGryphæa, near to _G. Couloni_ (Neocomian formations of France and\r\nNeufchâtel).\r\n\r\nNatica, indeterminable.\r\n\r\nCyprina rostrata, d’Orbigny, “Pal. Franc.” (Neocomian formation).\r\n\r\nRostellaria angulosa (?), d’Orbigny, “Pal. de l’Amér. Mer.”\r\n\r\nTerebratula (?).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the fragments of Ammonites were as thick as a man’s arm: the\r\nGryphæa is much the most abundant shell. These fossils M. d’Orbigny\r\nconsiders as belonging to the Neocomian stage of the Cretaceous system.\r\nDr. Meyen,[11] who ascended the valley of the Rio Volcan, a branch of\r\nthe Yeso, found a nearly similar, but apparently more calcareous\r\nformation, with much gypsum, and no doubt the equivalent of that here\r\ndescribed: the beds were vertical, and were prolonged up to the limits\r\nof perpetual snow; at the height of 9,000 feet above the sea, they\r\nabounded with fossils, consisting, according to Von Buch,[12] of:—\r\n\r\nExogyra (Gryphæa) Couloni, absolutely identical with specimens from the\r\nJura and South of France.\r\n\r\nTrigonia costata, identical with those found in the upper Jurassic beds\r\nat Hildesheim.\r\n\r\nPecten striatus, identical with those found in the upper Jurassic beds\r\nat Hildesheim.\r\n\r\nCucullæa, corresponding in form to _C. longirostris,_ so frequent in\r\nthe upper Jurassic beds of Westphalia.\r\n\r\nAmmonites resembling _A. biplex._\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] “Reise um Erde,” etc., Th. I, s. 355.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] “Descript. Phys. des Iles Canaries,” p. 471.\r\n\r\nVon Buch concludes that this formation is intermediate between the\r\nlimestone of the Jura and the chalk, and that it is analogous with the\r\nuppermost Jurassic beds forming the plains of Switzerland. Hence M.\r\nD’Orbigny and Von Buch, under different terms, compare these fossils to\r\nthose from the same late stage in the secondary formations of Europe.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossils which I collected were found a good way down the\r\nwestern slope of the main ridge, and hence must originally have been\r\ncovered up by a great thickness of the black shaly rock, independently\r\nof the now denuded, thick, overlying masses of red sandstone. I\r\nneglected at the time to estimate how many hundred or rather thousand\r\nfeet thick the superincumbent strata must have been: and I will not now\r\nattempt to do so. This, however, would have been a highly\r\ninteresting point, as indicative of a great amount of subsidence, of\r\nhich we shall hereafter find in other parts of the Cordillera analogous\r\nevidence during this same period. The altitude of the Peuquenes Range,\r\nconsidering its not great antiquity, is very remarkable; many of the\r\nfossils were embedded at the height of 13,210 feet, and the same beds\r\nare prolonged up to at least from fourteen to fifteen thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n_The Portillo or Eastern Chain._—The valley of Tenuyan, separating the\r\nPeuquenes and Portillo lines, is, as estimated by Dr. Gillies and\r\nmyself, about twenty miles in width; the lowest part, where the road\r\ncrosses the river, being 7,500 feet above the sea-level. The pass on\r\nthe Portillo line is 14,365 feet high (1,100 feet higher than that on\r\nthe Peuquenes), and the neighbouring pinnacles must, I conceive, rise\r\nto nearly 16,000 feet above the sea. The river draining the\r\nintermediate valley of Tenuyan, passes through the Portillo line. To\r\nreturn to our section:—shortly after leaving the lower beds [P2] of the\r\ngypseous formation, we come to grand masses of a coarse, red\r\nconglomerate [V], totally unlike any strata hitherto seen in the\r\nCordillera. This conglomerate is distinctly stratified, some of the\r\nbeds being well defined by the greater size of the pebbles: the cement\r\nis calcareous and sometimes crystalline, though the mass shows no signs\r\nof having been metamorphosed. The included pebbles are either perfectly\r\nor only partially rounded: they consist of purplish sandstones, of\r\nvarious porphyries, of brownish limestone, of black calcareous, compact\r\nshale precisely like that in situ in the Peuquenes range, and\r\n_containing some of the same fossil shells_; also very many pebbles of\r\nquartz, some of micaceous schist, and numerous, broken, rounded\r\ncrystals of a reddish orthitic or potash feldspar (as determined by\r\nProfessor Miller), and these from their size must have been derived\r\nfrom a coarse-grained rock, probably granite. From this feldspar being\r\northitic, and even from its external appearance, I venture positively\r\nto affirm that it has not been derived from the rocks of the western\r\nranges; but, on the other hand, it may well have come, together with\r\nthe quartz and metamorphic schists, from the eastern or Portillo line,\r\nfor this line mainly consists of coarse orthitic granite. The pebbles\r\nof the fossiliferous slate and of the purple sandstone, certainly have\r\nbeen derived from the Peuquenes or western ranges.\r\n\r\nThe road crosses the valley of Tenuyan in a nearly east and west line,\r\nand for several miles we have on both hands the conglomerate,\r\neverywhere dipping west and forming separate great mountains. The\r\nstrata, where first met with, after leaving the gypseous formation, are\r\ninclined westward at an angle of only 20°, which further on increases\r\nto about 45°. The gypseous strata, as we have seen, are also inclined\r\nwestward: hence, when looking from the eastern side of the valley\r\ntowards the Peuquenes range, a most deceptive appearance is presented,\r\nas if the newer beds of conglomerate dipped directly under the much\r\nolder beds of the gypseous formation. In the middle of the valley, a\r\nbold mountain of unstratified lilac-coloured porphyry (with crystals of\r\nhornblende) projects; and further on, a little south of the road, there\r\nis another mountain, with its strata inclined at a small angle\r\neastwards,\r\nwhich in its general aspect and colour, resembles the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation, so rare on this side of the Peuquenes line and\r\nso grandly developed throughout the western ranges.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate is of great thickness: I do not suppose that the\r\nstrata forming the separate mountain-masses [V, V, V] have ever been\r\nprolonged over each other, but that one mass has been broken up by\r\nseveral, distinct, parallel, uniclinal lines of elevation. Judging\r\ntherefore of the thickness of the conglomerate, as seen in the separate\r\nmountain-masses, I estimated it at least from one thousand five hundred\r\nto two thousand feet. The lower beds rest conformably on some\r\nsingularly coloured, soft strata [W], which I could not reach to\r\nexamine; and these again rest conformably on a thick mass of micaceous,\r\nthinly laminated, siliceous sandstone [X], associated with a little\r\nblack clay-slate. These lower beds are traversed by several dikes of\r\ndecomposing porphyry. The laminated sandstone is directly superimposed\r\non the vast masses of granite [Y, Y] which mainly compose the Portillo\r\nrange. The line of junction between this latter rock, which is of a\r\nbright red colour, and the whitish sandstone was beautifully distinct;\r\nthe sandstone being penetrated by numerous, great, tortuous dikes\r\nbranching from the granite, and having been converted into a granular\r\nquartz rock (singularly like that of the Falkland Islands), containing\r\nspecks of an ochrey powder, and black crystalline atoms, apparently of\r\nimperfect mica. The quartzose strata in one spot were folded into a\r\nregular dome.\r\n\r\nThe granite which composes the magnificent bare pinnacles and the steep\r\nwestern flank of the Portillo chain, is of a brick-red colour, coarsely\r\ncrystallised, and composed of orthitic or potash feldspar, quartz, and\r\nimperfect mica in small quantity, sometimes passing into chlorite.\r\nThese minerals occasionally assume a laminar or foliated arrangement.\r\nThe fact of the feldspar being orthitic in this range, is very\r\nremarkable, considering how rare, or rather, as I believe, entirely\r\nabsent, this mineral is throughout the western ranges, in which\r\nsoda-feldspar, or at least a variety cleaving like albite, is so\r\nextremely abundant. In one spot on the western flank, and on the\r\neastern flank near Los Manantiales and near the crest, I noticed some\r\ngreat masses of a whitish granite, parts of it fine- grained, and parts\r\ncontaining large crystals of feldspar; I neglected to collect\r\nspecimens, so I do not know whether this feldspar is also orthitic,\r\nthough I am inclined to think so from its general appearance. I saw\r\nalso some syenite and one mass which resembled andesite, but of which I\r\nlikewise neglected to collect specimens. From the manner in which the\r\nwhitish granites formed separate mountain-masses in the midst of the\r\nbrick-red variety, and from one such mass near the crest being\r\ntraversed by numerous veins of flesh-coloured and greenish eurite (into\r\nwhich I occasionally observed the brick-red granite insensibly\r\npassing), I conclude that the white granites probably belong to an\r\nolder formation, almost overwhelmed and penetrated by the red granite.\r\n\r\nOn the crest I saw also, at a short distance, some coloured stratified\r\nbeds, apparently like those [W] at the western base, but was prevented\r\nexamining them by a snowstorm: Mr. Caldcleugh,[13] however, collected\r\nhere specimens of ribboned jasper, magnesian limestone, and other\r\nminerals. A little way down the eastern slope a few fragments of quartz\r\nand mica-slate are met with; but the great formation of this latter\r\nrock [Z], which covers up much of the eastern flank and base of the\r\nPortillo range, cannot be conveniently examined until much lower down\r\nat a place called Mal Paso. The mica-schist here consists of thick\r\nlayers of quartz, with intervening folia of finely-scaly mica, often\r\npassing into a substance like black glossy clay-slate: in one spot, the\r\nlayers of the quartz having disappeared, the whole mass became\r\nconverted into glossy clay-slate. Where the folia were best defined,\r\nthey were inclined at a high angle westward, that is, towards the\r\nrange. The line of junction between the dark mica-slate and the coarse\r\nred granite was most clearly distinguishable from a vast distance: the\r\ngranite sent many small veins into the mica-slate, and included some\r\nangular fragments of it. As the sandstone on the western base has been\r\nconverted by the red granite into a granular quartz-rock, so this great\r\nformation of mica-schist may possibly have been metamorphosed at the\r\nsame time and by the same means; but I think it more probable,\r\nconsidering its more perfect metamorphic character and its\r\nwell-pronounced foliation, that it belongs to an anterior epoch,\r\nconnected with the white granites: I am the more inclined to this view,\r\nfrom having found at the foot of the range the mica-schist surrounding\r\na hummock [Y2], exclusively composed of white granite. Near Los\r\nArenales, the mountains on all sides are composed of the mica-slate;\r\nand looking backwards from this point up to the bare gigantic peaks\r\nabove, the view was eminently interesting. The colours of the red\r\ngranite and the black mica-slate are so distinct, that with a bright\r\nlight these rocks could be readily distinguished even from the Pampas,\r\nat a level of at least 9,000 feet below. The red granite, from being\r\ndivided by parallel joints, has weathered into sharp pinnacles, on some\r\nof which, even on some of the loftiest, little caps of mica-schist\r\ncould be clearly seen: here and there isolated patches of this rock\r\nadhered to the mountain-flanks, and these often corresponded in height\r\nand position on the opposite sides of the immense valleys. Lower down\r\nthe schist prevailed more and more, with only a few quite small points\r\nof granite projecting through. Looking at the entire eastern face of\r\nthe Portillo range, the red colour far exceeds in area the black; yet\r\nit was scarcely possible to doubt that the granite had once been almost\r\nwholly encased by the mica-schist.\r\n\r\n [13] “Travels,” etc., vol. i, p. 308.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Los Arenales, low down on the eastern flank, the mica-slate is\r\ntraversed by several closely adjoining, broad dikes, parallel to each\r\nother and to the foliation of the schist. The dikes are formed of three\r\ndifferent varieties of rock, of which a pale brown feldspathic porphyry\r\nwith grains of quartz was much the most abundant. These dikes with\r\ntheir granules of quartz, as well as the mica-schist itself, strikingly\r\nresemble the rocks of the Chonos Archipelago. At a height of about\r\ntwelve hundred feet above the dikes, and perhaps connected with them,\r\nthere is a range of cliffs formed of successive lava-streams [AA],\r\nbetween three and four hundred feet in thickness, and in places finely\r\ncolumnar. The lava consists of dark-greyish, harsh rocks, intermediate\r\nin character between trachyte and basalt, containing glassy feldspar,\r\nolivine, and a little mica, and sometimes amygdaloidal with zeolite:\r\nthe basis is either quite compact, or crenulated with air-vesicles\r\narranged in laminæ. The streams are separated from each other by beds\r\nof fragmentary brown scoriæ, firmly cemented together, and including a\r\nfew well-rounded pebbles of lava. From their general appearance, I\r\nsuspect that these lava-streams flowed at an ancient period under the\r\npressure of the sea, when the Atlantic covered the Pampas and washed\r\nthe eastern foot of the Cordillera.[14] On the opposite and northern\r\nside of the valley there is another line of lava-cliffs at a\r\ncorresponding height; the valley between being of considerable breadth,\r\nand as nearly as I could estimate 1,500 feet in depth. This field of\r\nlava is confined on both sides by the mountains of mica-schist, and\r\nslopes down rapidly but irregularly to the edge of the Pampas, where,\r\nhaving a thickness of about two hundred feet, it terminates against a\r\nlittle range of claystone porphyry. The valley in this lower part\r\nexpands into a bay-like, gentle slope, bordered by the cliffs of lava,\r\nwhich must certainly once have extended across this wide expanse. The\r\ninclination of the streams from Los Arenales to the mouth of the valley\r\nis so great, that at the time (though ignorant of M. Elie de Beaumont’s\r\nresearches on the extremely small slope over which lava can flow, and\r\nyet retain a compact structure and considerable thickness) I concluded\r\nthat they must subsequently to their flowing have been upheaved and\r\ntilted from the mountains; of this conclusion I can now entertain not\r\nthe smallest doubt.\r\n\r\n [14] This conclusion might, perhaps, even have been anticipated, from\r\n the general rarity of volcanic action, except near the sea or large\r\n bodies of water. Conformably with this rule, at the present day, there\r\n are no active volcanoes on this eastern side of the Cordillera; nor\r\n are severe earthquakes experienced here.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the valley, within the cliffs of the above lava-field,\r\nthere are remnants, in the form of separate small hillocks and of lines\r\nof low cliffs, of a considerable deposit of compact white tuff\r\n(quarried for filtering-stones), composed of broken pumice, volcanic\r\ncrystals, scales of mica, and fragments of lava. This mass has suffered\r\nmuch denudation; and the hard mica-schist has been deeply worn, since\r\nthe period of its deposition; and this period must have been subsequent\r\nto the denudation of the basaltic lava-streams, as attested by their\r\nencircling cliffs standing at a higher level. At the present day, under\r\nthe existing arid climate, ages might roll past without a square yard\r\nof rock of any kind being denuded, except perhaps in the rarely\r\nmoistened drainage-channel of the valley. Must we then look back to\r\nthat ancient period, when the waves of the sea beat against the eastern\r\nfoot of the Cordillera, for a power sufficient to denude extensively,\r\nthough superficially, this tufaceous deposit, soft although it be?\r\n\r\nThere remains only to mention some little water-worn hillocks [BB],\r\na few hundred feet in height, and mere mole-hills compared with the\r\ngigantic mountains behind them, which rise out of the sloping,\r\nshingle-covered margin of the Pampas. The first little range is\r\ncomposed of a brecciated purple porphyritic claystone, with obscurely\r\nmarked strata dipping at 70° to the S.W.; the other ranges consist of—a\r\npale-coloured feldspathic porphyry,—a purple claystone porphyry with\r\ngrains of quartz,—and a rock almost exclusively composed of brick-red\r\ncrystals of feldspar. These outermost small lines of elevation extend\r\nin a N.W. by W. and S.E. by S. direction.\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on the Portillo range._—When on the Pampas and\r\nlooking southward, and whilst travelling northward, I could see for\r\nvery many leagues the red granite and dark mica-schist forming the\r\ncrest and eastern flank of the Portillo line. This great range,\r\naccording to Dr. Gillies, can be traced with little interruption for\r\n140 miles southward to the R. Diamante, where it unites with the\r\nwestern ranges: northward, according to this same author, it terminates\r\nwhere the R. Mendoza debouches from the mountains; but a little further\r\nnorth in the eastern part of the Cumbre section, there are, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, some mountain-masses of a brick-red porphyry, the last\r\ninjected amidst many other porphyries, and having so close an analogy\r\nwith the coarse red granite of the Portillo line, that I am tempted to\r\nbelieve that they belong to the same axis of injection; if so, the\r\nPortillo line is at least 200 miles in length. Its height, even in the\r\nlowest gap in the road, is 14,365 feet, and some of the pinnacles\r\napparently attain an elevation of about 16,000 feet above the sea. The\r\ngeological history of this grand chain appears to me eminently\r\ninteresting. We may safely conclude, that at a former period the valley\r\nof Tenuyan existed as an arm of the sea, about twenty-miles in width,\r\nbordered on one hand by a ridge or chain of islets of the black\r\ncalcareous shales and purple sandstones of the gypseous formation; and\r\non the other hand, by a ridge or chain of islets composed of\r\nmica-slate, white granite, and perhaps to a partial extent of red\r\ngranite. These two chains, whilst thus bordering the old sea-channel,\r\nmust have been exposed for a vast lapse of time to alluvial and\r\nlittoral action, during which the rocks were shattered, the fragments\r\nrounded, and the strata of conglomerate accumulated to a thickness of\r\nat least fifteen hundred or two thousand feet. The red orthitic granite\r\nnow forms, as we have seen, the main part of the Portillo chain: it is\r\ninjected in dikes not only into the mica-schist and white granites, but\r\ninto the laminated sandstone, which it has metamorphosed, and which it\r\nhas thrown off, together with the conformably overlying coloured beds\r\nand stratified conglomerate, at an angle of forty-five degrees. To have\r\nthrown off so vast a pile of strata at this angle, is a proof that the\r\nmain part of the red granite (whether or not portions, as perhaps is\r\nprobable, previously existed) was injected in a liquified state after\r\nthe accumulation both of the laminated sandstone and of the\r\nconglomerate; this conglomerate, we know, was accumulated, not only\r\nafter the deposition of the fossiliferous strata of the Peuquenes line,\r\nbut after their elevation and long-continued denudation: and these\r\nfossiliferous strata belong to the early part of the Cretaceous system.\r\nLate, therefore, in a geological sense, as must be the age of the main\r\npart of the red granite, I can conceive nothing more impressive than\r\nthe eastern view of this great range, as forcing the mind to grapple\r\nwith the idea of the thousands of thousands of years requisite for the\r\ndenudation of the strata which originally encased it,—for that the\r\nfluidified granite was once encased, its mineralogical composition and\r\nstructure, and the bold conical shape of the mountain-masses, yield\r\nsufficient evidence. Of the encasing strata we see the last vestiges in\r\nthe coloured beds on the crest, in the little caps of mica-schist on\r\nsome of the loftiest pinnacles, and in the isolated patches of this\r\nsame rock at corresponding heights on the now bare and steep flanks.\r\n\r\nThe lava-streams at the eastern foot of the Portillo are interesting,\r\nnot so much from the great denudation which they have suffered at a\r\ncomparatively late period as from the evidence they afford by their\r\ninclination taken conjointly with their thickness and compactness, that\r\nafter the great range had assumed its present general outline, it\r\ncontinued to rise as an axis of elevation. The plains extending from\r\nthe base of the Cordillera to the Atlantic show that the continent has\r\nbeen upraised in mass to a height of 3,500 feet, and probably to a much\r\ngreater height, for the smooth shingle-covered margin of the Pampas is\r\nprolonged in a gentle unbroken slope far up many of the great valleys.\r\nNor let it be assumed that the Peuquenes and Portillo ranges have\r\nundergone only movements of elevation; for we shall hereafter see, that\r\nthe bottom of the sea subsided several thousand feet during the\r\ndeposition of strata, occupying the same relative place in the\r\nCordillera, with those of the Peuquenes ridge; moreover, we shall see\r\nfrom the unequivocal evidence of buried upright trees, that at a\r\nsomewhat later period, during the formation of the Uspallata chain,\r\nwhich corresponds geographically with that of the Portillo, there was\r\nanother subsidence of many thousand feet: here, indeed, in the valley\r\nof Tenuyan, the accumulation of the coarse stratified conglomerate to a\r\nthickness of fifteen hundred or two thousand feet, offers strong\r\npresumptive evidence of subsidence; for all existing analogies lead to\r\nthe belief that large pebbles can be transported only in shallow water,\r\nliable to be affected by currents and movements of undulation—and if\r\nso, the shallow bed of the sea on which the pebbles were first\r\ndeposited must necessarily have sunk to allow of the accumulation of\r\nthe superincumbent strata. What a history of changes of level, and of\r\nwear and tear, all since the age of the latter secondary formations of\r\nEurope, does the structure of this one great mountain-chain reveal!\r\n\r\n_Passage of the Andes by the Cumbre or Uspallata Pass._\r\n\r\nThis Pass crosses the Andes about sixty miles north of that just\r\ndescribed: the section given in Plate V, Section 1/2, [see map page\r\n440] is on the same scale as before, namely, at one-third of an inch to\r\na mile in distance, and one inch to a mile (or 6,000 feet) in height.\r\nLike the last section, it is a mere sketch, and cannot pretend to\r\naccuracy, though made under favourable circumstances. We will commence\r\nas before, with the\r\nwestern half, of which the main range bears the name of the Cumbre\r\n(that is the Ridge), and corresponds to the Peuquenes line in the\r\nformer section; as does the Uspallata range, though on a much smaller\r\nscale, to that of the Portillo. Near the point where the river\r\nAconcagua debouches on the basin plain of the same name, at a height of\r\nabout two thousand three hundred feet above the sea, we meet with the\r\nusual purple and greenish porphyritic claystone conglomerate. Beds of\r\nthis nature, alternating with numerous compact and amygdaloidal\r\nporphyries, which have flowed as submarine lavas, and associated with\r\ngreat mountain-masses of various, injected, non-stratified porphyries,\r\nare prolonged the whole distance up to the Cumbre or central ridge. One\r\nof the commonest stratified porphyries is of a green colour, highly\r\namygdaloidal with the various minerals described in the preliminary\r\ndiscussion, and including fine tabular crystals of albite. The\r\nmountain-range north (often with a little westing) and south. The\r\nstratification, wherever I could clearly distinguish it, was inclined\r\nwestward or towards the Pacific, and, except near the Cumbre, seldom at\r\nangles above 25°. Only at one spot on this western side, on a lofty\r\npinnacle not far from the Cumbre, I saw strata apparently belonging to\r\nthe gypseous formation, and conformably capping a pile of stratified\r\nporphyries. Hence, both in composition and in stratification, the\r\nstructure of the mountains on this western side of the divortium\r\naquarum, is far more simple than in the corresponding part of the\r\nPeuquenes section. In the porphyritic claystone conglomerate, the\r\nmechanical structure and the planes of stratification have generally\r\nbeen much obscured and even quite obliterated towards the base of the\r\nseries, whilst in the upper parts, near the summits of the mountains,\r\nboth are distinctly displayed. In these upper portions the porphyries\r\nare generally lighter coloured. In three places [X, Y, Z] masses of\r\nandesite are exposed: at [Y], this rock contained some quartz, but the\r\ngreater part consisted of andesitic porphyry, with only a few\r\nwell-developed crystals of albite, and forming a great white mass,\r\nhaving the external aspect of granite, capped by much dark unstratified\r\nporphyry. In many parts of the mountains, there are dikes of a green\r\ncolour, and other white ones, which latter probably spring from\r\nunderlying masses of andesite.\r\n\r\nThe Cumbre, where the road crosses it, is, according to Mr. Pentland,\r\n12,454 feet above the sea; and the neighbouring peaks, composed of dark\r\npurple and whitish porphyries, some obscurely stratified with a\r\nwesterly dip, and others without a trace of stratification, must exceed\r\n13,000 feet in height. Descending the eastern slope of the Cumbre, the\r\nstructure becomes very complicated, and generally differs on the two\r\nsides of the east and west line of road and section. First we come to a\r\ngreat mass [A] of nearly vertical, singularly contorted strata,\r\ncomposed of highly compact red sandstones, and of often calcareous\r\nconglomerates, and penetrated by green, yellow, and reddish dikes; but\r\nI shall presently have an opportunity of describing in some detail an\r\nanalogous pile of strata. These vertical beds are abruptly succeeded by\r\nothers [B], of apparently nearly the same nature but more\r\nmetamorphosed,\r\nalternating with porphyries and limestones; these dip for a short space\r\nwestward, but there has been here an extraordinary dislocation, which,\r\non the north side of the road, appears to have determined the\r\nexcavation of the north and south valley of the R. de las Cuevas. On\r\nthis northern side of the road, the strata [B] are prolonged till they\r\ncome in close contact with a jagged lofty mountain [D] of\r\ndark-coloured, unstratified, intrusive porphyry, where the beds have\r\nbeen more highly inclined and still more metamorphosed. This mountain\r\nof porphyry seems to form a short axis of elevation, for south of the\r\nroad in its line there is a hill [C] of porphyritic conglomerate with\r\nabsolutely vertical strata.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the gypseous formation: I will first describe the\r\nstructure of the several mountains, and then give in one section a\r\ndetailed account of the nature of the rocks. On the north side of the\r\nroad, which here runs in an east and west valley, the mountain of\r\nporphyry [D] is succeeded by a hill [E] formed of the upper gypseous\r\nstrata tilted, at an angle of between 70° and 80° to the west, by a\r\nuniclinal axis of elevation which does not run parallel to the other\r\nneighbouring ranges, and which is of short length; for on the south\r\nside of the valley its prolongation is marked only by a small flexure\r\nin a pile of strata inclined by a quite separate axis. A little further\r\non the north and south valley of Horcones enters at right angles our\r\nline of section; its western side is bounded by a hill of gypseous\r\nstrata [F] dipping westward at about 45°, and its eastern side by a\r\nmountain of similar strata [G] inclined westward at 70°, and\r\nsuperimposed by an oblique fault on another mass of the same strata\r\n[H], also inclined westward, but at an angle of about 30°: the\r\ncomplicated relation of these three masses [F, G, H] is explained by\r\nthe structure of a great mountain-range lying some way to the north, in\r\nwhich a regular anticlinal axis (represented in the section by dotted\r\nlines) is seen, with the strata on its eastern side again bending up\r\nand forming a distinct uniclinal axis, of which the beds marked [H]\r\nform the lower part. This great uniclinal line is intersected, near the\r\nPuente del Inca, by the valley along which the road runs, and the\r\nstrata composing it will be immediately described. On the south side of\r\nthe road, in the space corresponding with the mountains [E, F, and G],\r\nthe strata everywhere dip westward generally at an angle of 30°,\r\noccasionally mounting up to 45°, but not in an unbroken line, for there\r\nare several vertical faults, forming separate uniclinal masses, all\r\ndipping in the same direction,—a form of elevation common in the\r\nCordillera. We thus see that within a narrow space, the gypseous strata\r\nhave been upheaved and crushed together by a great uniclinal,\r\nanticlinal, and one lesser uniclinal line [E] of elevation; and that\r\nbetween these three lines and the Cumbre, in the sandstones,\r\nconglomerates and porphyritic formation, there have been at least two\r\nor three other great elevatory axes.\r\n\r\nThe uniclinal axis [I] intersected near the Puente del Inca[15] (of\r\nwhich\r\nthe strata at [H] form a part) ranges N. by W. and S. by E., forming a\r\nchain of mountains, apparently little inferior in height to the Cumbre:\r\nthe strata, as we have seen, dip at an average angle of 30° to the\r\nwest. The flanks of the mountains are here quite bare and steep,\r\naffording an excellent section; so that I was able to inspect the\r\nstrata to a thickness of about 4,000 feet, and could clearly\r\ndistinguish their general nature for 1,000 feet higher, making a total\r\nthickness of 5,000 feet, to which must be added about 1,000 feet of the\r\ninferior strata seen a little lower down the valley, I will describe\r\nthis one section in detail, beginning at the bottom.\r\n\r\n [15] At this place, there are some hot and cold springs, the warmest\r\n having a temperature, according to Lieutenant Brand (“Travels,” p.\r\n 240), of 91°; they emit much gas. According to Mr. Brande, of the\r\n Royal Institution, ten cubical inches contain forty-five grains of\r\n solid matter, consisting chiefly of salt, gypsum, carbonate of lime,\r\n and oxide of iron. The water is charged with carbonic acid and\r\n sulphuretted hydrogen. These springs deposit much tufa in the form of\r\n spherical balls. They burst forth, as do those of Cauquenes, and\r\n probably those of Villa Vicencio, on a line of elevation.\r\n\r\n1st. The lowest mass is the altered clay-slate described in the\r\npreliminary discussion, and which in this line of section was here\r\nfirst met with. Lower down the valley, at the R. de las Vacas, I had a\r\nbetter opportunity of examining it; it is there in some parts well\r\ncharacterised, having a distinct, nearly vertical, tortuous cleavage,\r\nranging N.W. and S.E., and intersected by quartz veins: in most parts,\r\nhowever, it is crystalline and feldspathic, and passes into a true\r\ngreenstone often including grains of quartz. The clay-slate, in its\r\nupper half, is frequently brecciated, the embedded angular fragments\r\nbeing of nearly the same nature with the paste.\r\n\r\n2nd. Several strata of purplish porphyritic conglomerate, of no very\r\ngreat thickness, rest conformably upon the feldspathic slate. A thick\r\nbed of fine, purple, claystone porphyry, obscurely brecciated (but not\r\nof metamorphosed sedimentary origin), and capped by porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, was the lowest bed actually examined in this section at\r\nthe Puente del Inca.\r\n\r\n3rd. A stratum, eighty feet thick, of hard and very compact impure\r\nwhitish limestone, weathering bright red, with included layers\r\nbrecciated and recemented. Obscure marks of shell are distinguishable\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n4th. A red, quartzose, fine-grained conglomerate, with grains of\r\nquartz, and with patches of white earthy feldspar, apparently due to\r\nsome process of concretionary crystalline action; this bed is more\r\ncompact and metamorphosed than any of the overlying conglomerates.\r\n\r\n5th. A whitish cherty limestone, with nodules of bluish argillaceous\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n6th. A white conglomerate, with many particles of quartz, almost\r\nblending into the paste.\r\n\r\n7th. Highly siliceous, fine-grained white sandstone.\r\n\r\n8th and 9th. Red and white beds not examined.\r\n\r\n10th. Yellow, fine-grained, thinly stratified, magnesian (judging from\r\nits slow dissolution in acids) limestone: it includes some white quartz\r\npebbles, and little cavities, lined with calcareous spar, some\r\nretaining the form of shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n11th. A bed between twenty and thirty feet thick, quite conformable\r\nwith the underlying ones, composed of a hard basis, tinged lilac-grey\r\nporphyritic with _numerous_ crystals of whitish feldspar, with black\r\nmica and little spots of soft ferruginous matter: evidently a submarine\r\nlava.\r\n\r\n12th. Yellow magnesian limestone, as before, part-stained purple.\r\n\r\n13th. A most singular rock; basis purplish grey, obscurely crystalline,\r\neasily fusible into a dark green glass, not hard, thickly speckled with\r\ncrystals more or less perfect of white carbonate of lime, of red\r\nhydrous oxide of iron, of a white and transparent mineral like\r\nanalcime, and of a green opaque mineral like soap-stone; the basis is\r\nmoreover amygdaloidal with many spherical balls of white crystallised\r\ncarbonate of lime, of which some are coated with the red oxide of iron.\r\nI have no doubt, from the examination of a superincumbent stratum (19),\r\nthat this is a submarine lava; though in Northern Chile, some of the\r\nmetamorphosed sedimentary beds are almost as crystalline, and of as\r\nvaried composition.\r\n\r\n14th. Red sandstone, passing in the upper part into a coarse, hard, red\r\nconglomerate, 300 feet thick, having a calcareous cement, and including\r\ngrains of quartz and broken crystals of feldspar; basis infusible; the\r\npebbles consist of dull purplish porphyries, with some of quartz, from\r\nthe size of a nut to a man’s head. This is the coarsest conglomerate in\r\nthis part of the Cordillera: in the middle there was a white layer not\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n15th. Grand thick bed, of a very hard, yellowish-white rock, with a\r\ncrystalline feldspathic base, including large crystals of white\r\nfeldspar, many little cavities mostly full of soft ferruginous matter,\r\nand numerous hexagonal plates of black mica. The upper part of this\r\ngreat bed is slightly cellular; the lower part compact: the thickness\r\nvaried a little in different parts. Manifestly a submarine lava; and is\r\nallied to bed 11.\r\n\r\n16th and 17th. Dull purplish, calcareous, fine-grained, compact\r\nsandstones, which pass into coarse white conglomerates with numerous\r\nparticles of quartz.\r\n\r\n18th. Several alternations of red conglomerate, purplish sandstone, and\r\nsubmarine lava, like that singular rock forming bed 13.\r\n\r\n19th. A very heavy, compact, greenish-black stone, with a fine-grained\r\nobviously crystalline basis, containing a few specks of white\r\ncalcareous spar, many specks of the crystallised hydrous red oxide of\r\niron, and some specks of a green mineral; there are veins and nests\r\nfilled with epidote: certainly a submarine lava.\r\n\r\n20th. Many thin strata of compact, fine-grained, pale purple sandstone.\r\n\r\n21st. Gypsum in a nearly pure state, about three hundred feet in\r\nthickness: this bed, in its concretions of anhydrite and layers of\r\nsmall blackish crystals of carbonate of lime, exactly resembles the\r\ngreat gypseous beds in the Peuquenes range.\r\n\r\n22nd. Pale purple and reddish sandstone, as in bed 20: about three\r\nhundred feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n23rd. A thick mass composed of layers, often as thin as paper and\r\nconvoluted, of pure gypsum with others very impure, of a purplish\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n24th. Pure gypsum, thick mass.\r\n\r\n25th. Red sandstones, of great thickness.\r\n\r\n26th. Pure gypsum, of great thickness.\r\n\r\n27th. Alternating layers of pure and impure gypsum, of great thickness.\r\n\r\nI was not able to ascend to these few last great strata, which compose\r\nthe neighbouring loftiest pinnacles. The thickness, from the lowest to\r\nthe uppermost bed of gypsum, cannot be less than 2,000 feet: the beds\r\nbeneath I estimated at 3,000 feet, and this does not include either the\r\nlower parts of the porphyritic conglomerate, or the altered clay-slate;\r\nI conceive the total thickness must be about six thousand feet. I\r\ndistinctly observed that not only the gypsum, but the alternating\r\nsandstones and conglomerates were lens-shaped, and repeatedly thinned\r\nout and replaced each other: thus in the distance of about a mile, a\r\nbed 300 feet thick of sandstone between two beds of gypsum, thinned out\r\nto nothing and disappeared. The lower part of this section differs\r\nremarkably,—in the much greater diversity of its mineralogical\r\ncomposition,—in the abundance of calcareous matter,—in the greater\r\ncoarseness of some of the conglomerates,—and in the numerous particles\r\nand well-rounded pebbles, sometimes of large size, of quartz,— from any\r\nother section hitherto described in Chile. From these peculiarities and\r\nfrom the lens-form of the strata, it is probable that this great pile\r\nof strata was accumulated on a shallow and very uneven bottom, near\r\nsome pre-existing land formed of various porphyries and quartz-rock.\r\nThe formation of porphyritic claystone conglomerate does not in this\r\nsection attain nearly its ordinary thickness; this may be PARTLY\r\nattributed to the metamorphic action having been here much less\r\nenergetic than usual, though the lower beds have been affected to a\r\ncertain degree. If it had been as energetic as in most other parts of\r\nChile, many of the beds of sandstone and conglomerate, containing\r\nrounded masses of porphyry, would doubtless have been converted into\r\nporphyritic conglomerate; and these would have alternated with, and\r\neven blended into, crystalline and porphyritic strata without a trace\r\nof mechanical structure,—namely, into those which, in the present state\r\nof the section, we see are unquestionably submarine lavas.\r\n\r\nThe beds of gypsum, together with the red alternating sandstones and\r\nconglomerates, present so perfect and curious a resemblance with those\r\nseen in our former section in the basin-valley of Yeso, that I cannot\r\ndoubt the identity of the two formations: I may add, that a little\r\nwestward of the P. del Inca, a mass of gypsum passed into a\r\nfine-grained, hard, brown sandstone, which contained some layers of\r\nblack, calcareous, compact, shaly rock, precisely like that seen in\r\nsuch vast masses on the Peuquenes range.\r\n\r\nNear the Puente del Inca, numerous fragments of limestone, containing\r\nsome fossil remains, were scattered on the ground: these fragments so\r\nperfectly resemble the limestone of bed No. 3, in which I saw\r\nimpressions of shells, that I have no doubt they have fallen from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yellow magnesian limestone of bed No. 10, which also includes\r\ntraces of shells, has a different appearance. These fossils (as named\r\nby M. d’Orbigny) consist of:—\r\n    Gryphæa, near to _G. Couloni_ (Neocomian formation).\r\n    Arca, perhaps _A. Gabrielis,_ d’Orbigny, “Pal. Franc.” (Neocomian\r\n    formation).\r\n\r\nMr. Pentland made a collection of shells from this same spot, and Von\r\nBuch[16] considers them as consisting of:—\r\n    Trigonia, resembling in form _T. costata._\r\n    Pholadomya, like one found by M. Dufresnoy near Alencon.\r\n    Isocardi excentrica, Voltz., identical with that from the Jura.\r\n\r\n [16] “Description Phys. des Iles Can.,” p. 472.\r\n\r\nTwo of these shells, namely, the Gryphæa and Trigonia, appear to be\r\nidentical with species collected by Meyen and myself on the Peuquenes\r\nrange; and in the opinion of Von Buch and M. d’Orbigny, the two\r\nformations belong to the same age. I must here add, that Professor E.\r\nForbes, who has examined my specimens from this place and from the\r\nPeuquenes range, has likewise a strong impression that they indicate\r\nthe Cretaceous period, and probably an early epoch in it: so that all\r\nthe palæontologists who have seen these fossils nearly coincide in\r\nopinion regarding their age. The limestone, however, with these fossils\r\nhere lies at the very base of the formation, just above the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and certainly several thousand feet lower in the series,\r\nthan the equivalent, fossiliferous, black, shaly rocks high up on the\r\nPeuquenes range.\r\n\r\nIt is well worthy of remark that these shells, or at least those of\r\nwhich I saw impressions in the limestone (bed No. 3), must have been\r\ncovered up, on the _least_ computation, by 4,000 feet of strata: now we\r\nknow from Professor E. Forbes’s researches, that the sea at greater\r\ndepths than 600 feet becomes exceedingly barren of organic beings,—a\r\nresult quite in accordance with what little I have seen of deep-sea\r\nsoundings. Hence, after this limestone with its shells was deposited,\r\nthe bottom of the sea where the main line of the Cordillera now stands,\r\nmust have subsided some thousand feet to allow of the deposition of the\r\nsuperincumbent submarine strata. Without supposing a movement of this\r\nkind, it would, moreover, be impossible to understand the accumulation\r\nof the several lower strata of _coarse,_ well-rounded conglomerates,\r\nwhich it is scarcely possible to believe were spread out in profoundly\r\ndeep water, and which, especially those containing pebbles of quartz,\r\ncould hardly have been rounded in submarine craters and afterwards\r\nejected from them, as I believe to have been the case with much of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation. I may add that, in Professor\r\nForbes’s opinion, the above-enumerated species of mollusca probably did\r\nnot live at a much greater depth than twenty fathoms, that is only 120\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nTo return to our section down the valley; standing on the great N. by\r\nW. and S. by E. uniclinal axis of the Puente del Inca, of which a\r\nsection has just been given, and looking north-east, greater tabular\r\nmasses of gypseous formation (KK) could be seen in the distance, very\r\nslightly inclined towards the east. Lower down the valley, the\r\nmountains are almost exclusively composed of porphyries, many of them\r\nof intrusive origin and non-stratified, others stratified, but with the\r\nstratification seldom distinguishable except in the upper parts.\r\nDisregarding local disturbances, the beds are either horizontal or\r\ninclined at a small angle eastwards: hence, when standing on the plain\r\nof Uspallata and looking to the west or backwards, the Cordillera\r\nappear composed of huge, square, nearly horizontal, tabular masses: so\r\nwide a space, with such lofty mountains so equably elevated, is rarely\r\nmet with within the Cordillera. In this line of section, the interval\r\nbetween the Puente del Inca and the neighbourhood of the Cumbre,\r\nincludes all the chief axes of dislocation.\r\n\r\nThe altered clay-slate formation, already described, is seen in several\r\nparts of the valley as far down as Las Vacas, underlying the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate. At the Casa de Pujios [L], there is a hummock\r\nof (andesitic?) granite; and the stratification of the surrounding\r\nmountains here changes from W. by S. to S.W. Again, near the R. Vacas\r\nthere is a larger formation of (andesitic?) granite [M], which sends a\r\nmeshwork of veins into the superincumbent clay-slate, and which locally\r\nthrows off the strata, on one side to N.W. and on the other to S.E. but\r\nnot at a high angle: at the junction, the clay-slate is altered into\r\nfine-grained greenstone. This granitic axis is intersected by a green\r\ndike, which I mention, because I do not remember having elsewhere seen\r\ndikes in this lowest and latest intrusive rock. From the R. Vacas to\r\nthe plain of Uspallata, the valley runs N.E., so that I have had to\r\ncontract my section; it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks. As\r\nfar as the Pass of Jaula, the claystone conglomerate formation, in most\r\nparts highly porphyritic, and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstone\r\nporphyry, attains a great thickness: there is also much intrusive\r\nporphyry. From the Jaula to the plain, the stratification has been in\r\nmost places obliterated, except near the tops of some of the mountains;\r\nand the metamorphic action has been extremely great. In this space, the\r\nnumber and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured\r\nporphyries, injected one into another and intersected by dikes, is\r\ntruly extraordinary. I saw one mountain of whitish porphyry, from which\r\ntwo huge dikes, thinning out, branched _downwards_ into an adjoining\r\nblackish porphyry. Another hill of white porphyry, which had burst\r\nthrough dark-coloured strata, was itself injected by a purple,\r\nbrecciated, and recemented porphyry, both being crossed by a green\r\ndike, and both having been upheaved and injected by a granitic dome.\r\nOne brick-red porphyry, which above the Jaula forms an isolated mass in\r\nthe midst of the porphyritic conglomerate formation, and lower down the\r\nvalley a magnificent group of peaked mountains, differs remarkably from\r\nall the other porphyries. It consists of a red feldspathic base,\r\nincluding some rather large crystals of red feldspar, numerous large\r\nangular grains of quartz, and little bits of a soft green mineral\r\nanswering in most of its characters to soapstone. The crystals of red\r\nfeldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite, though, from\r\nbeing\r\npartially decomposed, I was unable to measure them; and they certainly\r\nare quite unlike the variety, so abundantly met with in almost all the\r\nother rocks of this line of section, and which, wherever I tried it,\r\ncleaved like albite. This brick-red porphyry appears to have burst\r\nthrough all the other porphyries, and numerous red dikes traversing the\r\nneighbouring mountains have proceeded from it: in some few places,\r\nhowever, it was intersected by white dikes. From this posteriority of\r\nintrusive origin,—from the close general resemblance between this red\r\nporphyry and the red granite of the Portillo line, the only difference\r\nbeing that the feldspar here is less perfectly granular, and that\r\nsoapstone replaces the mica, which is there imperfect and passes into\r\nchlorite,—and from the Portillo line a little southward of this point\r\nappearing to blend (according to Dr. Gillies) into the western\r\nranges,—I am strongly urged to believe (as formerly remarked) that the\r\ngrand mountain-masses composed of this brick-red porphyry belong to the\r\nsame axis of injection with the granite of the Portillo line; if so,\r\nthe injection of this porphyry probably took place, as long\r\nsubsequently to the several axes of elevation in the gypseous formation\r\nnear the Cumbre, as the injection of the Portillo granite has been\r\nshown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the gypseous strata\r\ncomposing the Peuquenes range; and this interval, we have seen, must\r\nhave been a very long one.\r\n\r\nThe Plain of Uspallata has been briefly described in Chapter 3; it\r\nresembles the basin-plains of Chile; it is ten or fifteen miles wide,\r\nand is said to extend for 180 miles northward; its surface is nearly\r\nsix thousand feet above the sea; it is composed, to a thickness of some\r\nhundred feet of loosely aggregated, stratified shingle, which is\r\nprolonged with a gently sloping surface up the valleys in the mountains\r\non both sides. One section in this plain [Z] is interesting, from the\r\nunusual[17] circumstance of alternating layers of almost loose red and\r\nwhite sand with lines of pebbles (from the size of a nut to that of an\r\napple), and beds of gravel, being inclined at an angle of 45°, and in\r\nsome spots even at a higher angle. These beds are dislocated by small\r\nfaults: and are capped by a thick mass of horizontally stratified\r\ngravel, evidently of subaqueous origin. Having been accustomed to\r\nobserve the irregularities of beds accumulated under currents, I feel\r\nsure that the inclination here has not been thus produced. The pebbles\r\nconsist chiefly of the brick-red porphyry just described and of white\r\ngranite, both probably derived from the ranges to the west, and of\r\naltered clay-slate and of certain porphyries, apparently belonging to\r\nthe rocks of the Uspallata chain. This plain corresponds geographically\r\nwith the valley of Tenuyan between the Portillo and Peuquenes ranges;\r\nbut in that valley the shingle, which likewise has been derived both\r\nfrom the eastern and western ranges, has been cemented into a hard\r\nconglomerate, and has been throughout tilted at a considerable\r\ninclination; the gravel there apparently attains a much greater\r\nthickness, and is probably of higher antiquity.\r\n\r\n [17] I find that Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill has described (_Edinburgh\r\n New Phil. Journ.,_ vol. xxv, p. 392) beds of sand and gravel, near\r\n Edinburgh, tilted at an angle of 60°, and dislocated by miniature\r\n faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Uspallata range._—The road by the Villa Vicencio Pass does not\r\nstrike directly across the range, but runs for some leagues northward\r\nalong its western base: and I must briefly describe the rocks here\r\nseen, before continuing with the coloured east and west section. At the\r\nmouth of the valley of Canota, and at several points northwards, there\r\nis an extensive formation of a glossy and harsh, and of a feldspathic\r\nclay-slate, including strata of grauwacke, and having a tortuous,\r\nnearly vertical cleavage, traversed by numerous metalliferous veins and\r\nothers of quartz. The clay-slate is in many parts capped by a thick\r\nmass of fragments of the same rock, firmly recemented; and both\r\ntogether have been injected and broken up by very numerous hillocks,\r\nranging north and south, of lilac, white, dark and salmon-coloured\r\nporphyries: one steep, now denuded, hillock of porphyry had its face as\r\ndistinctly impressed with the angles of a fragmentary mass of the\r\nslate, with some of the points still remaining embedded, as sealing-wax\r\ncould be by a seal. At the mouth of this same valley of Canota, in a\r\nfine escarpment having the strata dipping from 50° to 60° to the\r\nN.E.,[18] the clay-slate formation is seen to be covered by—(1st) a\r\npurple, claystone porphyry resting unconformably in some parts on the\r\nsolid slate, and in others on a thick fragmentary mass; (2nd), a\r\nconformable stratum of compact blackish rock, having a spheroidal\r\nstructure, full of minute acicular crystals of glassy feldspar, with\r\nred spots of oxide of iron; (3rd), a great stratum of purplish-red\r\nclaystone porphyry, abounding with crystals of opaque feldspar, and\r\nlaminated with thin, parallel, often short, layers, and likewise with\r\ngreat irregular patches of white, earthy, semi-crystalline feldspar;\r\nthis rock (which I noticed in other neighbouring places) perfectly\r\nresembles a curious variety described at Port Desire, and occasionally\r\noccurs in the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of Chile; (4th),\r\na thin stratum of greenish white, indurated tuff, fusible and\r\ncontaining broken crystals and particles of porphyries; (5th), a grand\r\nmass, imperfectly columnar and divided into three parallel and closely\r\njoined strata, of cream-coloured claystone porphyry; (6th), a thick\r\nstratum of lilac-coloured porphyry, which I could see was capped by\r\nanother bed of the cream-coloured variety; I was unable to examine the\r\nstill higher parts of the escarpment. These conformably stratified\r\nporphyries, though none are either vesicular are amygdaloidal, have\r\nevidently flowed as submarine lavas: some of them are separated from\r\neach other by seams of indurated tuff, which, however, are quite\r\ninsignificant in thickness compared with the porphyries. This whole\r\npile resembles, but not very closely, some of the less brecciated parts\r\nof the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of Chile; but it does\r\nnot probably belong to the same age, as the porphyries here rest\r\nunconformably on the altered feldspathic clay-slate, whereas the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation alternates with\r\nand rests conformably on it. These porphyries, moreover, with the\r\nexception of the one blackish stratum, and of the one indurated, white\r\ntufaceous bed, differ from the beds composing the Uspallata range in\r\nthe line of the Villa Vicencio Pass.\r\n\r\n [18] Nearly opposite to this escarpment, there is another\r\n corresponding one, with the strata dipping not to the exactly opposite\r\n point, or S.W., but to S.S.W.: consequently the two escarpments trend\r\n towards each other, and some miles southward they become actually\r\n united: this is a form of elevation which I have not elsewhere seen.\r\n\r\nI will now give, first, a sketch of the structure of the range, as\r\nrepresented in the section, and will then describe its composition and\r\ninteresting history. At its western foot, a hillock [N] is seen to rise\r\nout of the plain, with its strata dipping at 70° to the west, fronted\r\nby strata [O] inclined at 45° to the east, thus forming a little north\r\nand south anticlinal axis. Some other little hillocks of similar\r\ncomposition, with their strata highly inclined, range N.E. and S.W.,\r\nobliquely to the main Uspallata line. The cause of these dislocations,\r\nwhich, though on a small scale, have been violent and complicated, is\r\nseen to lie in hummocks of lilac, purple and red porphyries, which have\r\nbeen injected in a liquified state through and into the underlying\r\nclay-slate formation. Several dykes were exposed here, but in no other\r\npart, that I saw of this range. As the strata consist of black, white,\r\ngreenish and brown-coloured rocks, and as the intrusive porphyries are\r\nso brightly tinted, a most extraordinary view was presented, like a\r\ncoloured geological drawing. On the gently inclined main western slope\r\n[PP], above the little anticlinal ridges just mentioned, the strata dip\r\nat an average angle of 25° to the west; the inclination in some places\r\nbeing only 19°, in some few others as much as 45°. The masses having\r\nthese different inclinations, are separated from each other by parallel\r\nvertical faults [as represented at Pa], often giving rise to separate,\r\nparallel, uniclinal ridges. The summit of the main range is broad and\r\nundulatory, with the stratification undulatory and irregular: in a few\r\nplaces granitic and porphyritic masses [Q] protrude, which, from the\r\nsmall effect they have locally produced in deranging the strata,\r\nprobably form the upper points of a regular, great underlying dome.\r\nThese denuded granitic points, I estimated at about nine thousand feet\r\nin height above the sea. On the eastern slope, the strata in the upper\r\npart are regularly inclined at about 25° to the east, so that the\r\nsummit of this chain, neglecting small irregularities, forms a broad\r\nanticlinal axis. Lower down, however, near Los Hornillos [R], there is\r\na well-marked synclinal axis, beyond which the strata are inclined at\r\nnearly the same angle, namely from 20° to 30°, inwards or westward.\r\nOwing to the amount of denudation which this chain has suffered, the\r\noutline of the gently inclined eastern flank scarcely offers the\r\nslightest indication of this synclinal axis. The stratified beds, which\r\nwe have hitherto followed across the range, a little further down are\r\nseen to lie, I believe unconformably, on a broad mountainous band of\r\nclay-slate and grauwacke. The strata and laminæ of this latter\r\nformation, on the extreme eastern flank, are generally nearly vertical;\r\nfurther inwards they become inclined from 45° to 80° to the west: near\r\nVilla Vicencio [S] there is apparently an anticlinal axis, but the\r\nstructure of this outer part of the clay-slate formation is so obscure,\r\nthat I have not marked the planes of stratification in the section. On\r\nthe margin of the Pampas, some low, much dislocated spurs of this same\r\nformation,\r\nproject in a north-easterly line, in the same oblique manner as do the\r\nridges on the western foot, and as is so frequently the case with those\r\nat the base of the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the nature of the beds, beginning at the base on\r\nthe eastern side. First, for the clay-slate formation: the slate is\r\ngenerally hard and bluish, with the laminæ coated by minute micaceous\r\nscales; it alternates many times with a coarse-grained, greenish\r\ngrauwacke, containing rounded fragments of quartz and bits of slate in\r\na slightly calcareous basis. The slate in the upper part generally\r\nbecomes purplish, and the cleavage so irregular that the whole consists\r\nof mere splinters. Transverse veins of quartz are numerous. At the\r\nCalera, some leagues distant, there is a dark crystalline limestone,\r\napparently included in this formation. With the exception of the\r\ngrauwacke being here more abundant, and the clay-slate less altered,\r\nthis formation closely resembles that unconformably underlying the\r\nporphyries at the western foot of this same range; and likewise that\r\nalternating with the porphyritic conglomerate in the main Cordillera.\r\nThis formation is a considerable one, and extends several leagues\r\nsouthward to near Mendoza: the mountains composed of it rise to a\r\nheight of about two thousand feet above the edge of the Pampas, or\r\nabout seven thousand feet above the sea.[19]\r\n\r\n [19] I infer this from the height of V. Vicencio, which was\r\n ascertained by Mr. Miers to be 5,328 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly: the most usual bed on the clay-slate is a coarse, white,\r\nslightly calcareous conglomerate, of no great thickness, including\r\nbroken crystals of feldspar, grains of quartz, and numerous pebbles of\r\nbrecciated claystone porphyry, but without any pebbles of the\r\nunderlying clay-slate. I nowhere saw the actual junction between this\r\nbed and the clay-slate, though I spent a whole day in endeavouring to\r\ndiscover their relations. In some places I distinctly saw the white\r\nconglomerate and overlying beds inclined at from 25° to 30° to the\r\nwest, and at the bottom of the same mountain, the clay-slate and\r\ngrauwacke inclined to the same point, but at an angle from 70° to 80°:\r\nin one instance, the clay-slate dipped not only at a different angle,\r\nbut to a different point from the overlying formation. In these cases\r\nthe two formations certainly appeared quite unconformable: moreover, I\r\nfound in the clay-slate one great, vertical, dike-like fissure, filled\r\nup with an indurated whitish tuff, quite similar to some of the upper\r\nbeds presently to be described; and this shows that the clay-slate must\r\nhave been consolidated and dislocated before their deposition. On the\r\nother hand, the stratification of the slate and grauwacke,[20] in some\r\ncases gradually and entirely disappeared in approaching the overlying\r\nwhite conglomerate;\r\nin other cases the stratification of the two formations became strictly\r\nconformable; and again in other cases, there was some tolerably well\r\ncharacterised clay-slate lying above the conglomerate. The most\r\nprobable conclusion appears to be, that after the clay-slate formation\r\nhad been dislocated and tilted, but whilst under the sea, a fresh and\r\nmore recent deposition of clay-slate took place, on which the white\r\nconglomerate was conformably deposited, with here and there a thin\r\nintercalated bed of clay-slate. On this view the white conglomerates\r\nand the presently to be described tuffs and lavas are really\r\nunconformable to the main part of the clay-slate; and this, as we have\r\nseen, certainly is the case with the clay-stone lavas in the valley of\r\nCanota, at the western and opposite base of the range.\r\n\r\n [20] The coarse, mechanical structure of many grauwackes has always\r\n appeared to me a difficulty; for the texture of the associated\r\n clay-slate and the nature of the embedded organic remains where\r\n present, indicate that the whole has been a deep-water deposit. Whence\r\n have the sometimes included angular fragments of clay-slate, and the\r\n rounded masses of quartz and other rocks, been derived? Many\r\n deep-water limestones, it is well known, have been brecciated, and\r\n then firmly recemented.\r\n\r\nThirdly: on the white conglomerate, strata several hundred feet in\r\nthickness are superimposed, varying much in nature in short distances:\r\nthe commonest variety is a white, much indurated tuff, sometimes\r\nslightly calcareous, with ferruginous spots and water-lines, often\r\npassing into whitish or purplish compact, fine-grained grit or\r\nsandstones; other varieties become semi-porcellanic, and tinted faint\r\ngreen or blue; others pass into an indurated shale: most of these\r\nvarieties are easily fusible.\r\n\r\nFourthly: a bed, about one hundred feet thick of a compact, partially\r\ncolumnar, pale-grey, feldspathic lava, stained with iron, including\r\nvery numerous crystals of opaque feldspar, and with some crystallised\r\nand disseminated calcareous matter. The tufaceous stratum on which this\r\nfeldspathic lava rests is much hardened, stained purple, and has a\r\nspherico-concretionary structure; it here contains a good many pebbles\r\nof claystone porphyry.\r\n\r\nFifthly: thin beds, 400 feet in thickness, varying much in nature,\r\nconsisting of white and ferruginous tuffs, in some parts having a\r\nconcretionary structure, in others containing rounded grains and a few\r\npebbles of quartz; also passing into hard gritstones and into greenish\r\nmudstones: there is, also, much of a bluish-grey and green\r\nsemi-porcellanic stone.\r\n\r\nSixthly: a volcanic stratum, 250 feet in thickness, of so varying a\r\nnature that I do not believe a score of specimens would show all the\r\nvarieties; much is highly amygdaloidal, much compact; there are\r\ngreenish, blackish, purplish, and grey varieties, rarely including\r\ncrystals of green augite and minute acicular ones of feldspar, but\r\noften crystals and amygdaloidal masses of white, red, and black\r\ncarbonate of lime. Some of the blackish varieties of this rock have a\r\nconchoidal fracture and resemble basalt; others have an irregular\r\nfracture. Some of the grey and purplish varieties are thickly speckled\r\nwith green earth and with white crystalline carbonate of lime; others\r\nare largely amygdaloidal with green earth and calcareous spar. Again,\r\nother earthy varieties, of greenish, purplish and grey tints, contain\r\nmuch iron, and are almost half composed of amygdaloidal balls of dark\r\nbrown bole, of a whitish indurated feldspathic matter, of bright green\r\nearth, of agate, and of black and white crystallised carbonate of lime.\r\nAll these varieties are easily fusible. Viewed from a distance, the\r\nline of junction with the underlying semi-porcellanic strata was\r\ndistinct; but when examined\r\nclosely, it was impossible to point out within a foot where the lava\r\nended and where the sedimentary mass began: the rock at the time of\r\njunction was in most places hard, of a bright green colour, and\r\nabounded with irregular amygdaloidal masses of ferruginous and pure\r\ncalcareous spar, and of agate.\r\n\r\nSeventhly: strata, eighty feet in thickness, of various indurated\r\ntuffs, as before; many of the varieties have a fine basis including\r\nrather coarse extraneous particles; some of them are compact and\r\nsemi-porcellanic, and include vegetable impressions.\r\n\r\nEighthly: a bed, about fifty feet thick, of greenish-grey, compact,\r\nfeldspathic lava, with numerous small crystals of opaque feldspar,\r\nblack augite, and oxide of iron. The junction with the bed on which it\r\nrested, was ill defined; balls and masses of the feldspathic rock being\r\nenclosed in much altered tuff.\r\n\r\nNinthly: indurated tuffs, as before.\r\n\r\nTenthly: a conformable layer, less than two feet in thickness, of\r\npitchstone, generally brecciated, and traversed by veins of agate and\r\nof carbonate of lime: parts are composed of apparently concretionary\r\nfragments of a more perfect variety, arranged in horizontal lines in a\r\nless perfectly characterised variety. I have much difficulty in\r\nbelieving that this thin layer of pitchstone flowed as lava.\r\n\r\nEleventhly: sedimentary and tufaceous beds as before, passing into\r\nsandstone, including some conglomerate: the pebbles in the latter are\r\nof claystone porphyry, well rounded, and some as large as\r\ncricket-balls.\r\n\r\nTwelfthly: a bed of compact, sonorous, feldspathic lava, like that of\r\nbed No. 8, divided by numerous joints into large angular blocks.\r\n\r\nThirteenthly: sedimentary beds as before.\r\n\r\nFourteenthly: a thick bed of greenish or greyish black, compact basalt\r\n(fusing into a black enamel), with small crystals, occasionally\r\ndistinguishable, of feldspar and augite: the junction with the\r\nunderlying sedimentary bed, differently from that in most of the\r\nforegoing streams, here was quite distinct:—the lava and tufaceous\r\nmatter preserving their perfect characters within two inches of each\r\nother. This rock closely resembles certain parts of that varied and\r\nsingular lava-stream No. 6; it likewise resembles, as we shall\r\nimmediately see, many of the great upper beds on the western flank and\r\non the summit of this range.\r\n\r\nThe pile of strata here described attains a great thickness; and above\r\nthe last-mentioned volcanic stratum, there were several other great\r\ntufaceous beds alternating with submarine lavas, which I had not time\r\nto examine; but a corresponding series, several thousand feet in\r\nthickness, is well exhibited on the crest and western flank of the\r\nrange. Most of the lava-streams on the western side are of a jet-black\r\ncolour and basaltic nature; they are either compact and fine-grained,\r\nincluding minute crystals of augite and feldspar, or they are\r\ncoarse-grained and abound with rather large coppery-brown crystals of\r\nan augitic mineral.[21] Another variety was of a dull-red colour,\r\nhaving a claystone brecciated basis, including specks of oxide of iron\r\nand of calcareous spar, and\r\namygdaloidal with green earth: there were apparently several other\r\nvarieties. These submarine lavas often exhibit a spheroidal, and\r\nsometimes an imperfect columnar structure: their upper junctions are\r\nmuch more clearly defined than their lower junctions; but the latter\r\nare not so much blended into the underlying sedimentary beds as is the\r\ncase in the eastern flank. On the crest and western flank of the range,\r\nthe streams, viewed as a whole, are mostly basaltic; whilst those on\r\nthe eastern side, which stand lower in the series, are, as we have\r\nseen, mostly feldspathic.\r\n\r\n [21] Very easily fusible into a jet-black bead, attracted by the\r\n magnet: the crystals are too much tarnished to be measured by the\r\n goniometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary strata alternating with the lavas on the crest and\r\nwestern side, are of an almost infinitely varying nature; but a large\r\nproportion of them closely resemble those already described on the\r\neastern flank: there are white and brown, indurated, easily fusible\r\ntuffs,—some passing into pale blue and green semi-porcellanic\r\nrocks,—others into brownish and purplish sandstones and gritstones,\r\noften including grains of quartz,—others into mudstone containing\r\nbroken crystals and particles of rock, and occasionally single large\r\npebbles. There was one stratum of a bright red, coarse, volcanic\r\ngritstone; another of conglomerate; another of a black, indurated,\r\ncarbonaceous shale marked with imperfect vegetable impressions; this\r\nlatter bed, which was thin, rested on a submarine lava, and followed\r\nall the considerable inequalities of its upper surface. Mr. Miers\r\nstates that coal has been found in this range. Lastly, there was a bed\r\n(like No. 10 on the eastern flank) evidently of sedimentary origin, and\r\nremarkable from closely approaching in character to an imperfect\r\npitchstone, and from including extremely thin layers of perfect\r\npitchstone, as well as nodules and irregular fragments (but not\r\nresembling extraneous fragments) of this same rock arranged in\r\nhorizontal lines: I conceive that this bed, which is only a few feet in\r\nthickness, must have assumed its present state through metamorphic and\r\nconcretionary action. Most of these sedimentary strata are much\r\nindurated, and no doubt have been partially metamorphosed: many of them\r\nare extraordinarily heavy and compact; others have agate and\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime disseminated throughout them. Some of the\r\nbeds exhibit a singular concretionary arrangement, with the curves\r\ndetermined by the lines of fissure. There are many veins of agate and\r\ncalcareous spar, and innumerable ones of iron and other metals, which\r\nhave blackened and curiously affected the strata to considerable\r\ndistances on both sides.\r\n\r\nMany of these tufaceous beds resemble, with the exception of being more\r\nindurated, the upper beds of the Great Patagonian tertiary formation,\r\nespecially those variously coloured layers high up the River Santa\r\nCruz, and in a remarkable degree the tufaceous formation at the\r\nnorthern end of Chiloe. I was so much struck with this resemblance,\r\nthat I particularly looked out for silicified wood, and found it under\r\nthe following extraordinary circumstances. High up on this western\r\nflank,[22]\r\nat a height estimated at 7,000 feet above the sea, in a broken\r\nescarpment of thin strata, composed of compact green gritstone passing\r\ninto a fine mudstone, and alternating with layers of coarser, brownish,\r\nvery heavy mudstone, including broken crystals and particles of rock\r\nalmost blended together, I counted the stumps of fifty-two trees. They\r\nprojected between two and five feet above the ground, and stood at\r\nexactly right angles to the strata, which were here inclined at an\r\nangle of about 25° to the west. Eleven of these trees were silicified\r\nand well preserved; Mr. R. Brown has been so kind as to examine the\r\nwood when sliced and polished; he says it is coniferous, partaking of\r\nthe characters of the Araucarian tribe, with some curious points of\r\naffinity with the Yew. The bark round the trunks must have been\r\ncircularly furrowed with irregular lines, for the mudstone round them\r\nis thus plainly marked. One cast consisted of dark argillaceous\r\nlimestone; and forty of them of coarsely crystallised carbonate of\r\nlime, with cavities lined by quartz crystals: these latter white\r\ncalcareous columns do not retain any internal structure, but their\r\nexternal form plainly shows their origin. All the stumps have nearly\r\nthe same diameter, varying from one foot to eighteen inches; some of\r\nthem stand within a yard of each other; they are grouped in a clump\r\nwithin a space of about sixty yards across, with a few scattered round\r\nat the distance of 150 yards. They all stand at about the same level.\r\nThe longest stump stood seven feet out of the ground: the roots, if\r\nthey are still preserved, are buried and concealed. No one layer of the\r\nmudstone appeared much darker than the others, as if it had formerly\r\nexisted as soil, nor could this be expected, for the same agents which\r\nreplaced with silex and lime the wood of the trees, would naturally\r\nhave removed all vegetable matter from the soil. Besides the fifty-two\r\nupright trees, there were a few fragments, like broken branches,\r\nhorizontally embedded. The surrounding strata are crossed by veins of\r\ncarbonate of lime, agate, and oxide of iron; and a poor gold vein has\r\nbeen worked not far from the trees.\r\n\r\n [22] For the information of any future traveller, I will describe the\r\n spot in detail. Proceeding eastward from the Agua del Zorro, and\r\n afterwards leaving on the north side of the road a rancho attached to\r\n some old goldmines, you pass through a gully with low but steep rocks\r\n on each hand: the road then bends, and the ascent becomes steeper. A\r\n few hundred yards farther on, a stone’s throw on the south side of the\r\n road, the white calcareous stumps may be seen. The spot is about half\r\n a mile east of the Agua del Zorro.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe green and brown mudstone beds including the trees, are conformably\r\ncovered by much indurated, compact, white or ferruginous tuffs, which\r\npass upwards into a fine-grained, purplish sedimentary rock: these\r\nstrata, which, together, are from four to five hundred feet in\r\nthickness, rest on a thick bed of submarine lava, and are conformably\r\ncovered by another great mass of fine-grained basalt,[23] which I\r\nestimated at 1,000 feet in thickness, and which probably has been\r\nformed by more than one stream. Above this mass I could clearly\r\ndistinguish five conformable alternations, each several hundred feet in\r\nthickness,\r\nof stratified sedimentary rocks and lavas, such as have been previously\r\ndescribed. Certainly the upright trees have been buried under several\r\nthousand feet in thickness of matter, accumulated under the sea. As the\r\ntrees obviously must once have grown on dry land, what an enormous\r\namount of subsidence is thus indicated! Nevertheless, had it not been\r\nfor the trees there was no appearance which would have led any one even\r\nto have conjectured that these strata had subsided. As the land,\r\nmoreover, on which the trees grew, is formed of subaqueous deposits, of\r\nnearly if not quite equal thickness with the superincumbent strata, and\r\nas these deposits are regularly stratified and fine-grained, not like\r\nthe matter thrown up on a sea-beach, a previous upward movement, aided\r\nno doubt by the great accumulation of lavas and sediment, is also\r\nindicated.[24]\r\n\r\n [23] This rock is quite black, and fuses into a black bead, attracted\r\n strongly by the magnet; it breaks with a conchoidal fracture; the\r\n included crystals of augite are distinguishable by the naked eye, but\r\n are not perfect enough to be measured: there are many minute acicular\r\n crystals of glassy feldspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] At first I imagined, that the strata with the trees might have\r\n been accumulated in a lake: but this seems highly improbable; for,\r\n first, a very deep lake was necessary to receive the matter below the\r\n trees, then it must have been drained for their growth, and afterwards\r\n re-formed and made profoundly deep, so as to receive a subsequent\r\n accumulation of matter _several thousand_ feet in thickness. And all\r\n this must have taken place necessarily before the formation of the\r\n Uspallata range, and therefore on the margin of the wide level expanse\r\n of the Pampas! Hence I conclude, that it is infinitely more probable\r\n that the strata were accumulated under the sea: the vast amount of\r\n denudation, moreover, which this range has suffered, as shown by the\r\n wide valleys, by the exposure of the very trees and by other\r\n appearances, could have been effected, I conceive, only by the\r\n long-continued action of the sea; and this shows that the range was\r\n either upheaved from under the sea, or subsequently let down into it.\r\n From the natural manner in which the stumps (fifty-two in number) are\r\n _grouped in a clump_, and from their all standing vertically to the\r\n strata, it is superfluous to speculate on the chance of the trees\r\n having been drifted from adjoining land, and deposited upright: I may,\r\n however, mention that the late Dr. Malcolmson assured me, that he once\r\n met in the Indian Ocean, fifty miles from land, several cocoa-nut\r\n trees floating upright, owing to their roots being loaded with earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nearly the middle of the range, there are some hills [Q], before\r\nalluded to, formed of a kind of granite externally resembling andesite,\r\nand consisting of a white, imperfectly granular, feldspathic basis,\r\nincluding some perfect crystals apparently of albite (but I was unable\r\nto measure them), much black mica, epidote in veins, and very little or\r\nno quartz. Numerous small veins branch from this rock into the\r\nsurrounding strata; and it is a singular fact that these veins, though\r\ncomposed of the same kind of feldspar and small scales of mica as in\r\nthe solid rock, abound with innumerable minute _rounded_ grains of\r\nquartz: in the veins or dikes also, branching from the great granitic\r\naxis in the peninsula of Tres Montes, I observed that quartz was more\r\nabundant in them than in the main rock: I have heard of other analogous\r\ncases: can we account for this fact, by the long-continued vicinity of\r\nquartz[25] when cooling, and by its having been thus more easily\r\nsucked into fissures than the other constituent minerals of granite?\r\nThe strata encasing the flanks of these granitic or andesite masses,\r\nand forming a thick cap on one of their summits, appear originally to\r\nhave been of the same tufaceous nature with the beds already described,\r\nbut they are now changed into porcellanic, jaspery, and crystalline\r\nrocks, and into others of a white colour with a harsh texture, and\r\nhaving a siliceous aspect, though really of a feldspathic nature and\r\nfusible. Both the granitic intrusive masses and the encasing strata are\r\npenetrated by innumerable metallic veins, mostly ferruginous and\r\nauriferous, but some containing copper-pyrites and a few silver: near\r\nthe veins, the rocks are blackened as if blasted by gunpowder. The\r\nstrata are only slightly dislocated close round these hills, and hence,\r\nperhaps, it may be inferred that the granitic masses form only the\r\nprojecting points of a broad continuous axis-dome, which has given to\r\nthe upper parts of this range its anticlinal structure.\r\n\r\n [25] See a paper by M. Elie de Beaumont, “Soc. Philomath.,” May 1839\r\n (“L’Institut.,” 1839, p. 161.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on the Uspallata range._—I will not attempt to\r\nestimate the total thickness of the pile of strata forming this range,\r\nbut it must amount to many thousand feet. The sedimentary and tufaceous\r\nbeds have throughout a general similarity, though with infinite\r\nvariations. The submarine lavas in the lower part of the series are\r\nmostly feldspathic, whilst in the upper part, on the summit and western\r\nflank, they are mostly basaltic. We are thus reminded of the relative\r\nposition in most recent volcanic districts of the trachytic and\r\nbasaltic lavas,—the latter from their greater weight having sunk to a\r\nlower level in the earth’s crust, and having consequently been erupted\r\nat a later period over the lighter and upper lavas of the trachytic\r\nseries.[26] Both the basaltic and feldspathic submarine streams are\r\nvery compact; none being vesicular, and only a few amygdaloidal: the\r\neffects which some of them, especially those low in the series, have\r\nproduced on the tufaceous beds over which they have flowed is highly\r\ncurious. Independently of this local metamorphic action, all the strata\r\nundoubtedly display an indurated and altered character; and all the\r\nrocks of this range—the lavas, the alternating sediments, the intrusive\r\ngranite and porphyries, and the underlying clay-slate—are intersected\r\nby metalliferous veins. The lava-strata can often be seen extending for\r\ngreat distances, conformably with the under and overlying beds; and it\r\nwas obvious that they thickened towards the west. Hence the points of\r\neruption must have been situated westward of the present range, in the\r\ndirection of the main Cordillera: as, however, the flanks of the\r\nCordillera are entirely composed of various porphyries, chiefly\r\nclaystone and greenstone, some intrusive, and others belonging to the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation, but all quite unlike these\r\nsubmarine lava-streams, we must in all probability look to the plain of\r\nUspallata for the now deeply buried points of eruption.\r\n\r\n [26] See on this subject, “Volcanic Islands,” etc., by the Author.\r\n\r\nComparing our section of the Uspallata range with that of the Cumbre,\r\nwe see, with the exception of the underlying clay-slate, and perhaps of\r\nthe intrusive rocks of the axes, a striking dissimilarity in the strata\r\ncomposing them. The great porphyritic conglomerate formation\r\nhas not extended as far as this range; nor have we here any of the\r\ngypseous strata, the magnesian and other limestones, the red\r\nsandstones, the siliceous beds with pebbles of quartz, and\r\ncomparatively little of the conglomerates, all of which form such vast\r\nmasses over the basal series in the main Cordillera. On the other hand,\r\nin the Cordillera, we do not find those endless varieties of indurated\r\ntuffs, with their numerous veins and concretionary arrangement, and\r\nthose grit and mud stones, and singular semi-porcellanic rocks, so\r\nabundant in the Uspallata range. The submarine lavas, also, differ\r\nconsiderably; the feldspathic streams of the Cordillera contain much\r\nmica, which is absent in those of the Uspallata range: in this latter\r\nrange we have seen on how grand a scale, basaltic lava has been poured\r\nforth, of which there is not a trace in the Cordillera. This\r\ndissimilarity is the more striking, considering that these two parallel\r\nchains are separated by a plain only between ten and fifteen miles in\r\nwidth; and that the Uspallata lavas, as well as no doubt the\r\nalternating tufaceous beds, have proceeded from the west, from points\r\napparently between the two ranges. To imagine that these two piles of\r\nstrata were contemporaneously deposited in two closely adjoining, very\r\ndeep, submarine areas, separated from each other by a lofty ridge,\r\nwhere a plain now extends, would be a gratuitous hypothesis. And had\r\nthey been contemporaneously deposited, without any such dividing ridge,\r\nsurely some of the gypseous and other sedimentary matter forming such\r\nimmensely thick masses in the Cordillera, would have extended this\r\nshort distance eastwards; and surely some of the Uspallata tuffs and\r\nbasalts also accumulated to so great a thickness, would have extended a\r\nlittle westward. Hence I conclude, that it is far from probable that\r\nthese two series are not contemporaneous; but that the strata of one of\r\nthe chains were deposited, and even the chain itself uplifted, before\r\nthe formation of the other:—which chain, then, is the oldest?\r\nConsidering that in the Uspallata range the lowest strata on the\r\nwestern flank lie unconformably on the clay-slate, as probably is the\r\ncase with those on the eastern flank, whereas in the Cordillera all the\r\noverlying strata lie conformably on this formation:—considering that in\r\nthe Uspallata range some of the beds, both low down and high up in the\r\nseries, are marked with vegetable impressions, showing the continued\r\nexistence of neighbouring land;—considering the close general\r\nresemblance between the deposits of this range and those of tertiary\r\norigin in several parts of the continent;—and lastly, even considering\r\nthe lesser height and outlying position of the Uspallata range,—I\r\nconclude that the strata composing it are in all probability of\r\nsubsequent origin, and that they were accumulated at a period when a\r\ndeep sea studded with submarine volcanoes washed the eastern base of\r\nthe already partially elevated Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is of much importance, for we have seen that in the\r\nCordillera, during the deposition of the Neocomian strata, the bed of\r\nthe sea must have subsided many thousand feet: we now learn that at a\r\nlater period an adjoining area first received a great accumulation of\r\nstrata, and was upheaved into land on which coniferous trees grew, and\r\nthat this area then subsided several thousand feet to receive the\r\nsuperincumbent\r\nsubmarine strata, afterwards being broken up, denuded, and elevated in\r\nmass to its present height. I am strengthened in this conclusion of\r\nthere having been two distinct, great periods of subsidence, by\r\nreflecting on the thick mass of coarse stratified conglomerate in the\r\nvalley of Tenuyan, between the Peuquenes and Portillo lines; for the\r\naccumulation of this mass seems to me, as previously remarked, almost\r\nnecessarily to have required a prolonged subsidence; and this\r\nsubsidence, from the pebbles in the conglomerate having been to a great\r\nextent derived from the gypseous or Neocomian strata of the Peuquenes\r\nline, we know must have been quite distinct from, and subsequent to,\r\nthat sinking movement which probably accompanied the deposition of the\r\nPeuquenes strata, and which certainly accompanied the deposition of the\r\nequivalent beds near the Puente del Inca, in this line of section.\r\n\r\nThe Uspallata chain corresponds in geographical position, though on a\r\nsmall scale, with the Portillo line; and its clay-slate formation is\r\nprobably the equivalent of the mica-schist of the Portillo, there\r\nmetamorphosed by the old white granites and syenites. The coloured beds\r\nunder the conglomerate in the valley of Tenuyan, of which traces are\r\nseen on the crest of the Portillo, and even the conglomerate itself,\r\nmay perhaps be synchronous with the tufaceous beds and submarine lavas\r\nof the Uspallata range; an open sea and volcanic action in the latter\r\ncase, and a confined channel between two bordering chains of islets in\r\nthe former case, having been sufficient to account for the\r\nmineralogical dissimilarity of the two series. From this correspondence\r\nbetween the Uspallata and Portillo ranges, perhaps in age and certainly\r\nin geographical position, one is tempted to consider the one range as\r\nthe prolongation of the other; but their axes are formed of totally\r\ndifferent intrusive rocks; and we have traced the apparent continuation\r\nof the red granite of the Portillo in the red porphyries diverging into\r\nthe main Cordillera. Whether the axis of the Uspallata range was\r\ninjected before, or as perhaps is more probable, after that of the\r\nPortillo line, I will not pretend to decide; but it is well to remember\r\nthat the highly inclined lava-streams on the eastern flank of the\r\nPortillo line, prove that its angular upheavement was not a single and\r\nsudden event; and therefore that the anticlinal elevation of the\r\nUspallata range may have been contemporaneous with some of the later\r\nangular movements by which the gigantic Portillo range gained its\r\npresent height above the adjoining plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII NORTHERN CHILE.—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection from Illapel to Combarbala; gypseous formation with silicified\r\nwood.—Panuncillo.—Coquimbo; mines of Arqueros; section up valley;\r\nfossils.—Guasco, fossils of.—Copiapo, section up valley; Las Amolanas,\r\nsilicified wood.—Conglomerates, nature of former land, fossils,\r\nthickness of strata, great subsidence.—Valley of Despoblado, fossils,\r\ntufaceous deposit, complicated dislocations of.—Relations between\r\nancient orifices of eruption and subsequent axes of injection.—Iquique,\r\nPeru, fossils of, salt-deposits.—Metalliferous veins.—Summary on the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate and gypseous formations.—Great subsidence with\r\npartial elevations during the cretaceo-oolitic period.—On the elevation\r\nand structure of the Cordillera.—Recapitulation on the tertiary\r\nseries.—Relation between movements of subsidence and volcanic\r\naction.—Pampean formation.—Recent elevatory movements.

I will describe only one section in this district, namely,\r\nfrom near Illapel in a N.E. line to the mines of Los Hornos, and thence\r\nin a north by east direction to Combarbala, at the foot of the main\r\nCordillera.\r\n\r\nNear Illapel, after passing for some distance over granite, andesite,\r\nand andesitic porphyry, we come to a greenish stratified feldspathic\r\nrock, which I believe is altered clay-slate, conformably capped by\r\nporphyries and porphyritic conglomerate of great thickness, dipping at\r\nan average angle of 20° to N.E. by N. The uppermost beds consist of\r\nconglomerates and sandstone only a little metamorphosed, and\r\nconformably covered by a gypseous formation of very great thickness,\r\nbut much denuded. This gypseous formation, where first met with, lies\r\nin a broad valley or basin, a little southward of the mines of Los\r\nHornos: the lower half alone contains gypsum, not in great masses as in\r\nthe Cordillera, but in innumerable thin layers, seldom more than an\r\ninch or two in thickness. The gypsum is either opaque or transparent,\r\nand is associated with carbonate of lime. The layers alternate with\r\nnumerous varying ones of a calcareous clay-shale (with strong aluminous\r\nodour, adhering to the tongue, easily fusible into a pale green glass),\r\nmore or less indurated, either earthy and cream-coloured, or greenish\r\nand hard. The more indurated varieties have a compact, homogeneous,\r\nalmost crystalline fracture, and contain granules of crystallised oxide\r\nof iron. Some of the varieties almost resemble honestones. There is\r\nalso a little black, hardly fusible, siliceo-calcareous clay-slate,\r\nlike some of the varieties alternating with gypsum on the Peuquenes\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nThe upper half of this gypseous formation is mainly formed of the\r\nsame calcareous clay-shale rock, but without any gypsum, and varying\r\nextremely in nature: it passes from a soft, coarse, earthy, ferruginous\r\nstate, including particles of quartz, into compact claystones with\r\ncrystallised oxide of iron,—into porcellanic layers, alternating with\r\nseams of calcareous matter,—and into green porcelain-jasper,\r\nexcessively hard, but easily fusible. Strata of this nature alternate\r\nwith much black and brown siliceo-calcareous slate, remarkable from the\r\nwonderful number of huge embedded logs of silicified wood. This wood,\r\naccording to Mr. R. Brown, is (judging from several specimens) all\r\nconiferous. Some of the layers of the black siliceous slate contained\r\nirregular angular fragments of imperfect pitchstone, which I believe,\r\nas in the Uspallata range, has originated in a metamorphic process.\r\nThere was one bed of a marly tufaceous nature, and of little specific\r\ngravity. Veins of agate and calcareous spar are numerous. The whole of\r\nthis gypseous formation, especially the upper half, has been injected,\r\nmetamorphosed, and locally contorted by numerous hillocks of intrusive\r\nporphyries crowded together in an extraordinary manner. These hillocks\r\nconsist of purple claystone and of various other porphyries, and of\r\nmuch white feldspathic greenstone passing into andesite; this latter\r\nvariety included in one case crystals of orthitic and albitic feldspar\r\ntouching each other, and others of hornblende, chlorite, and epidote.\r\nThe strata surrounding these intrusive hillocks at the mines of Los\r\nHornos, are intersected by many veins of copper-pyrites, associated\r\nwith much micaceous iron-ore, and by some of gold: in the neighbourhood\r\nof these veins the rocks are blackened and much altered. The gypsum\r\nnear the intrusive masses is always opaque. One of these hillocks of\r\nporphyry was capped by some stratified porphyritic conglomerate, which\r\nmust have been brought up from below, through the whole immense\r\nthickness of the overlying gypseous formation. The lower beds of the\r\ngypseous formation resemble the corresponding and probably\r\ncontemporaneous strata of the main Cordillera; whilst the upper beds in\r\nseveral respects resemble those of the Uspallata chain, and possibly\r\nmay be contemporaneous with them; for I have endeavoured to show that\r\nthe Uspallata beds were accumulated subsequently to the gypseous or\r\nNeocomian formations of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThis pile of strata dips at an angle of about 20 degrees to N.E. by N.,\r\nclose up to the foot of the Cuesta de Los Hornos, a crooked range of\r\nmountains formed of intrusive rocks of the same nature with the above\r\ndescribed hillocks. Only in one or two places, on this south-eastern\r\nside of the range, I noticed a narrow fringe of the upper gypseous\r\nstrata brushed up and inclined south-eastward from it. On its\r\nnorth-eastern flank, and likewise on a few of the summits, the\r\nstratified porphyritic conglomerate is inclined N.E.: so that, if we\r\ndisregard the very narrow anticlinal fringe of gypseous strata at its\r\nS.E. foot, this range forms a second uniclinal axis of elevation.\r\nProceeding in a north-by-east direction to the village of Combarbala,\r\nwe come to a third escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate, dipping\r\neastwards, and forming the outer range of the main Cordillera. The\r\nlower beds were here more jaspery than usual, and they included some\r\nwhite cherty strata and red\r\nsandstones, alternating with purple claystone porphyry. Higher up in\r\nthe Cordillera there appeared to be a line of andesitic rocks; and\r\nbeyond them, a fourth escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate, again\r\ndipping eastwards or inwards. The overlying gypseous strata, if they\r\never existed here, have been entirely removed.\r\n\r\n_Copper mines of Panuncillo._—From Combarbala to Coquimbo, I traversed\r\nthe country in a zigzag direction, crossing and recrossing the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate and finding in the granitic districts an\r\nunusual number of mountain-masses composed of various intrusive,\r\nporphyritic rocks, many of them andesitic. One common variety was\r\ngreenish-black, with large crystals of blackish albite. At Panuncillo a\r\nshort N.N.W. and S.S.E. ridge, with a nucleus formed of greenstone and\r\nof a slate-coloured porphyry including crystals of glassy feldspar,\r\ndeserves notice, from the very singular nature of the almost vertical\r\nstrata composing it. These consist chiefly of a finer and coarser\r\ngranular mixture, not very compact, of white carbonate of lime, of\r\nprotoxide of iron and of yellowish garnets (ascertained by Professor\r\nMiller), each grain being an almost perfect crystal. Some of the\r\nvarieties consist exclusively of granules of the calcareous spar; and\r\nsome contain grains of copper ore, and, I believe, of quartz. These\r\nstrata alternate with a bluish, compact, fusible, feldspathic rock.\r\nMuch of the above granular mixture has, also, a pseudo-brecciated\r\nstructure, in which fragments are obscurely arranged in planes parallel\r\nto those of the stratification, and are conspicuous on the weathered\r\nsurfaces. The fragments are angular or rounded, small or large, and\r\nconsist of bluish or reddish compact feldspathic matter, in which a few\r\nacicular crystals of feldspar can sometimes be seen. The fragments\r\noften blend at their edges into the surrounding granular mass, and seem\r\ndue to a kind of concretionary action.\r\n\r\nThese singular rocks are traversed by many copper veins, and appear to\r\nrest conformably on the granular mixture (in parts as fine-grained as a\r\nsandstone) of quartz, mica, hornblende, and feldspar; and this on\r\nfine-grained, common gneiss; and this on a laminated mass, composed of\r\npinkish _orthitic_ feldspar, including a few specks of hornblende; and\r\nlastly, this on granite, which together with andesitic rocks, form the\r\nsurrounding district.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo: Mining district of Arqueros._—At Coquimbo the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation approaches nearer to the Pacific than in any\r\nother part of Chile visited by me, being separated from the coast by a\r\ntract only a few miles broad of the usual plutonic rocks, with the\r\naddition of a porphyry having a red euritic base. In proceeding to the\r\nmines of Arqueros, the strata of porphyritic conglomerate are at first\r\nnearly horizontal, an unusual circumstance, and afterwards they dip\r\ngently to S.S.E. After having ascended to a considerable height, we\r\ncome to an undulatory district in which the famous silver mines are\r\nsituated; my examination was chiefly confined to those of S. Rosa. Most\r\nof the rocks in this district are stratified, dipping in various\r\ndirections, and many of them are of so singular a nature, that at the\r\nrisk of being tedious I must briefly describe them. The commonest\r\nvariety is a dull-red, compact, finely brecciated stone, containing\r\nmuch iron and innumerable white crystallised particles of carbonate of\r\nlime, and minute extraneous fragments. Another variety is almost\r\nequally common near S. Rosa; it has a bright green, scanty basis,\r\nincluding distinct crystals and patches of white carbonate of lime, and\r\ngrains of red, semi-micaceous oxide of iron; in parts the basis becomes\r\ndark green, and assumes an obscure crystalline arrangement, and\r\noccasionally in parts it becomes soft and slightly translucent like\r\nsoapstone. These red and green rocks are often quite distinct, and\r\noften pass into each other; the passage being sometimes affected by a\r\nfine brecciated structure, particles of the red and green matter being\r\nmingled together. Some of the varieties appear gradually to become\r\nporphyritic with feldspar; and all of them are easily fusible into pale\r\nor dark-coloured beads, strongly attracted by the magnet. I should\r\nperhaps have mistaken several of these stratified rocks for submarine\r\nlavas, like some of those described at the Puente del Inca, had I not\r\nexamined, a few leagues eastward of this point, a fine series of\r\nanalogous but less metamorphosed, sedimentary beds belonging to the\r\ngypseous formation, and probably derived from a volcanic source.\r\n\r\nThis formation is intersected by numerous metalliferous veins, running,\r\nthough irregularly, N.W. and S.E., and generally at right angles to the\r\nmany dikes. The veins consist of native silver, of muriate of silver,\r\nan amalgam of silver, cobalt, antimony, and arsenic,[1] generally\r\nembedded in sulphate of barytes. I was assured by Mr. Lambert, that\r\nnative copper without a trace of silver has been found in the same vein\r\nwith native silver without a trace of copper. At the mines of Aristeas,\r\nthe silver veins are said to be unproductive as soon as they pass into\r\nthe green strata, whereas at S. Rosa, only two or three miles distant,\r\nthe reverse happens; and at the time of my visit, the miners were\r\nworking through a red stratum, in the hope of the vein becoming\r\nproductive in the underlying green sedimentary mass. I have a specimen\r\nof one of these green rocks, with the usual granules of white\r\ncalcareous spar and red oxide of iron, abounding with disseminated\r\nparticles of glittering native and muriate of silver, yet taken at the\r\ndistance of one yard from any vein,—a circumstance, as I was assured,\r\nof very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n [1] See the Report on M. Domeyko’s account of those mines, in the\r\n “Comptes Rendus,” tome xiv, p. 560.\r\n\r\n_Section eastward, up the Valley of Coquimbo._—After passing for a few\r\nmiles over the coast granitic series, we come to the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate, with its usual characters, and with some of the beds\r\ndistinctly displaying their mechanical origin. The strata, where first\r\nmet with, are, as before stated, only slightly inclined; but near the\r\nHacienda of Pluclaro, we come to an anticlinal axis, with the beds much\r\ndislocated and shifted by a great fault, of which not a trace is\r\nexternally seen in the outline of the hill. I believe that this\r\nanticlinal axis can be traced northwards, into the district of\r\nArqueros, where a conspicuous hill called Cerro Blanco, formed of a\r\nharsh, cream-coloured euritic rock, including a few crystals of reddish\r\nfeldspar, and associated with some\r\npurplish claystone porphyry, seems to fall on a line of elevation. In\r\ndescending from the Arqueros district, I crossed on the northern border\r\nof the valley, strata inclined eastward from the Pluclaro axis: on the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass, some hundred feet thick,\r\nof brown argillaceous limestone, in parts crystalline, and in parts\r\nalmost composed of _Hippurites Chilensis,_ d’Orbigny; above this came a\r\nblack calcareous shale, and on it a red conglomerate. In the brown\r\nlimestone, with the Hippurites, there was an impression of a Pecten and\r\na coral, and great numbers of a large Gryphæa, very like, and,\r\naccording to Professor E. Forbes, probably identical with _G.\r\nOrientalis,_ Forbes MS.,—a cretaceous species (probably upper\r\ngreensand) from Verdachellum, in Southern India. These fossils seem to\r\noccupy nearly the same position with those at the Puente del\r\nInca,—namely, at the top of the porphyritic conglomerate, and at the\r\nbase of the gypseous formation.\r\n\r\nA little above the Hacienda of Pluclaro, I made a detour on the\r\nnorthern side of the valley, to examine the superincumbent gypseous\r\nstrata, which I estimated at 6,000 feet in thickness. The uppermost\r\nbeds of the porphyritic conglomerate, on which the gypseous strata\r\nconformably rest, are variously coloured, with one very singular and\r\nbeautiful stratum composed of purple pebbles of various kinds of\r\nporphyry, embedded in white calcareous spar, including cavities lined\r\nwith bright-green crystallised epidote. The whole pile of strata\r\nbelonging to both formations is inclined, apparently from the\r\nabove-mentioned axis of Pluclaro, at an angle of between 20 and 30\r\ndegrees to the east. I will here give a section of the principal beds\r\nmet with in crossing the entire thickness of the gypseous strata.\r\n\r\nFirstly: above the porphyritic conglomerate formation, there is a\r\nfine-grained, red, crystalline sandstone.\r\n\r\nSecondly: a thick mass of smooth-grained, calcareo-aluminous, shaly\r\nrock, often marked with dendritic manganese, and having, where most\r\ncompact, the external appearance of honestone. It is easily fusible. I\r\nshall for the future, for convenience’ sake, call this variety\r\npseudo-honestone. Some of the varieties are quite black when freshly\r\nbroken, but all weather into a yellowish-ash coloured, soft, earthy\r\nsubstance, precisely as is the case with the compact shaly rocks of the\r\nPeuquenes range. This stratum is of the same general nature with many\r\nof the beds near Los Hornos in the Illapel section. In this second bed,\r\nor in the underlying red sandstone (for the surface was partially\r\nconcealed by detritus), there was a thick mass of gypsum, having the\r\nsame mineralogical characters with the great beds described in our\r\nsections across the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nThirdly: a thick stratum of fine-grained, red, sedimentary matter,\r\neasily fusible into a white glass, like the basis of claystone\r\nporphyry; but in parts jaspery, in parts brecciated, and including\r\ncrystalline specks of carbonate of lime. In some of the jaspery layers,\r\nand in some of the black siliceous slaty bands, there were irregular\r\nseams of imperfect pitchstone, undoubtedly of metamorphic origin, and\r\nother seams of brown, crystalline limestone. Here, also, were masses,\r\nexternally resembling ill-preserved silicified wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourthly and fifthly: calcareous pseudo-honestone; and a thick stratum\r\nconcealed by detritus.\r\n\r\nSixthly: a thinly stratified mass of bright green, compact,\r\nsmooth-grained, calcareo-argillaceous stone, easily fusible, and\r\nemitting a strong aluminous odour: the whole has a highly\r\nangulo-concretionary structure; and it resembles, to a certain extent,\r\nsome of the upper tufaceo-infusorial deposits of the Patagonian\r\ntertiary formation. It is in its nature allied to our pseudo-honestone,\r\nand it includes well characterised layers of that variety; and other\r\nlayers of a pale green, harder, and brecciated variety; and others of\r\nred sedimentary matter, like that of bed Three. Some pebbles of\r\nporphyries are embedded in the upper part.\r\n\r\nSeventhly: red sedimentary matter or sandstone like that of bed One,\r\nseveral hundred feet in thickness, and including jaspery layers, often\r\nhaving a finely brecciated structure.\r\n\r\nEighthly: white, much indurated, almost crystalline tuff, several\r\nhundred feet in thickness, including rounded grains of quartz and\r\nparticles of green matter like that of bed Six. Parts pass into a very\r\npale green, semi-porcellanic stone.\r\n\r\nNinthly: red or brown coarse conglomerate, three or four hundred feet\r\nthick, formed chiefly of pebbles of porphyries, with volcanic\r\nparticles, in an arenaceous, non-calcareous, fusible basis: the upper\r\ntwo feet are arenaceous without any pebbles.\r\n\r\nTenthly: the last and uppermost stratum here exhibited, is a compact,\r\nslate-coloured porphyry, with numerous elongated crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in thickness;\r\nit lies strictly conformably on the underlying conglomerate, and is\r\nundoubtedly a submarine lava.\r\n\r\nThis great pile of strata has been broken up in several places by\r\nintrusive hillocks of purple claystone porphyry, and by dikes of\r\nporphyritic greenstone: it is said that a few poor metalliferous veins\r\nhave been discovered here. From the fusible nature and general\r\nappearance of the finer-grained strata, they probably owe their origin\r\n(like the allied beds of the Uspallata range, and of the Upper\r\nPatagonian tertiary formations), to gentle volcanic eruptions, and to\r\nthe abrasion of volcanic rocks. Comparing these beds with those in the\r\nmining district of Arqueros, we see at both places rocks easily\r\nfusible, of the same peculiar bright green and red colours, containing\r\ncalcareous matter, often having a finely brecciated structure, often\r\npassing into each other, and often alternating together: hence I cannot\r\ndoubt that the only difference between them, lies in the Arqueros beds\r\nhaving been more metamorphosed (in conformity with their more\r\ndislocated and injected condition), and consequently in the calcareous\r\nmatter, oxide of iron and green colouring matter, having been\r\nsegregated under a more crystalline form.\r\n\r\nThe strata are inclined, as before stated, from 20° to 30° eastward,\r\ntowards an irregular north and south chain of andesitic porphyry and of\r\nporphyritic greenstone, where they are abruptly cut off. In the valley\r\nof Coquimbo, near to the H. of Gualliguaca, similar plutonic rocks are\r\nmet with, apparently a southern prolongation of the above chain; and\r\neastward of it we have an escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate,\r\nwith the strata inclined at a small angle eastward, which makes the\r\nthird escarpment, including that nearest the coast. Proceeding up the\r\nvalley we come to another north and south line of granite, andesite,\r\nand blackish porphyry, which seem to lie in an irregular trough of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate. Again, on the south side of the R. Claro,\r\nthere are some irregular granitic hills, which have thrown off the\r\nstrata of porphyritic conglomerate to the N.W. by W.; but the\r\nstratification here has been much disturbed. I did not proceed any\r\nfarther up the valley, and this point is about two-thirds of the\r\ndistance between the Pacific and the main Cordillera.\r\n\r\nI will describe only one other section, namely, on the north side of\r\nthe R. Claro, which is interesting from containing fossils: the strata\r\nare much dislocated by faults and dikes, and are inclined to the north,\r\ntowards a mountain of andesite and porphyry, into which they appear to\r\nbecome almost blended. As the beds approach this mountain, their\r\ninclination increases up to an angle of 70°, and in the upper part, the\r\nrocks become highly metamorphosed. The lowest bed visible in this\r\nsection, is a purplish hard sandstone. Secondly, a bed two or three\r\nhundred feet thick, of a white siliceous sandstone, with a calcareous\r\ncement, containing seams of slaty sandstone, and of hard\r\nyellowish-brown (dolomitic?) limestone; numerous, well-rounded, little\r\npebbles of quartz are included in the sandstone. Thirdly, a dark\r\ncoloured limestone with some quartz pebbles, from fifty to sixty feet\r\nin thickness, containing numerous silicified shells, presently to be\r\nenumerated. Fourthly, very compact, calcareous, jaspery sandstone,\r\npassing into (fifthly) a great bed, several hundred feet thick, of\r\nconglomerate, composed of pebbles of white, red, and purple porphyries,\r\nof sandstone and quartz, cemented by calcareous matter. I observed that\r\nsome of the finer parts of this conglomerate were much indurated within\r\na foot of a dike eight feet in width, and were rendered of a paler\r\ncolour with the calcareous matter segregated into white crystallised\r\nparticles; some parts were stained green from the colouring matter of\r\nthe dike. Sixthly, a thick mass, obscurely stratified, of a red\r\nsedimentary stone or sandstone, full of crystalline calcareous matter,\r\nimperfect crystals of oxide of iron, and I believe of feldspar, and\r\ntherefore closely resembling some of the highly metamorphosed beds at\r\nArqueros: this bed was capped by, and appeared to pass in its upper\r\npart into, rocks similarly coloured, containing calcareous matter, and\r\nabounding with minute crystals, mostly elongated and glassy, of reddish\r\nalbite. Seventhly, a conformable stratum of fine reddish porphyry with\r\nlarge crystals of (albitic?) feldspar; probably a submarine lava.\r\nEighthly, another conformable bed of green porphyry, with specks of\r\ngreen earth and cream-coloured crystals of feldspar. I believe that\r\nthere are other superincumbent crystalline strata and submarine lavas,\r\nbut I had not time to examine them.\r\n\r\nThe upper beds in this section probably correspond with parts of the\r\ngreat gypseous formation; and the lower beds of red sandstone\r\nconglomerate and fossiliferous limestone no doubt are the equivalents\r\nof\r\nthe Hippurite stratum, seen in descending from Arqueros to Pluclaro,\r\nwhich there lies conformably upon the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation. The fossils found in the third bed, consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage, Part Pal.”\r\nThis species, which occurs here in vast numbers, according to M.\r\nD’Orbigny, resembles certain cretaceous forms.\r\n\r\nOstrea hemispherica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” etc.\r\nAlso resembles, according to the same author, cretaceous forms.\r\n\r\nTerebratula ænigma, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” etc. (Pl. XXII, Figs. 10-12.)\r\nIs allied, according to M. d’Orbigny, to T. concinna from the Forest\r\nMarble. A series of this species, collected in several localities\r\nhereafter to be referred to, has been laid before Professor Forbes; and\r\nhe informs me that many of the specimens are almost undistinguishable\r\nfrom our oolitic T. tetrædra, and that the varieties amongst them are\r\nsuch as are found in that variable species. Generally speaking, the\r\nAmerican specimens of T. ænigma may be distinguished from the British\r\nT. tetrædra, by the surface having the ribs sharp and well-defined to\r\nthe beak, whilst in the British species they become obsolete and\r\nsmoothed down; but this difference is not constant. Professor Forbes\r\nadds, that, possibly, internal characters may exist, which would\r\ndistinguish the American species from its European allies.\r\n\r\nSpirifer linguiferoides, E. Forbes.\r\nProfessor Forbes states that this species is very near to S. linguifera\r\nof Phillips (a carboniferous limestone fossil), but probably distinct.\r\nM. d’Orbigny considers it as perhaps indicating the Jurassic period.\r\n\r\nAmmonites, imperfect impression of.\r\n\r\nM. Domeyko has sent to France a collection of fossils, which, I\r\npresume, from the description given, must have come from the\r\nneighbourhood of Arqueros; they consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nOstrea hemispherica, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nTurritella Andii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal. (Pleurotomaria\r\nHumboldtii of Von Buch).\r\nHippurites Chilensis, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nThe specimens of this Hippurite, as well as those I collected in my\r\ndescent from Arqueros, are very imperfect; but in M. d’Orbigny’s\r\nopinion they resemble, as does the Turritella Andii, cretaceous (upper\r\ngreensand) forms.\r\n\r\nNautilus Domeykus, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nTerebratula ænigma, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nTerebratula ignaciana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage” Part Pal.\r\nThis latter species was found by M. Domeyko in the same block of\r\nlimestone with the T. ænigma. According to M. d’Orbigny, it comes near\r\nto T. ornithocephala from the Lias. A series of this species collected\r\nat Guasco, has been examined by Professor E. Forbes, and he states that\r\nit is difficult\r\nto distinguish between some of the specimens and the T. hastata from\r\nthe mountain limestone; and that it is equally difficult to draw a line\r\nbetween them and some Marlstone Terebratulæ. Without a knowledge of the\r\ninternal structure, it is impossible at present to decide on their\r\nidentity with analogous European forms.\r\n\r\nThe remarks given on the several foregoing shells, show that, in M.\r\nd’Orbigny’s opinion, the Pecten, Ostrea, Turritella, and Hippurite\r\nindicate the cretaceous period; and the Gryphæa appears to Professor\r\nForbes to be identical with a species, associated in Southern India\r\nwith unquestionably cretaceous forms. On the other hand, the two\r\nTerebratulæ and the Spirifer point, in the opinion both of M. d’Orbigny\r\nand Professor Forbes, to the oolitic series. Hence M. d’Orbigny, not\r\nhaving himself examined this country, has concluded that there are here\r\ntwo distinct formations; but the Spirifer and T. ænigma were certainly\r\nincluded in the same bed with the Pecten and Ostrea, whence I extracted\r\nthem; and the geologist M. Domeyko sent home the two Terebratulæ with\r\nthe other-named shells, from the same locality, without specifying that\r\nthey came from different beds. Again, as we shall presently see, in a\r\ncollection of shells given me from Guasco, the same species, and others\r\npresenting analogous differences, are mingled together, and are in the\r\nsame condition; and lastly, in three places in the valley of Copiapo, I\r\nfound some of these same species similarly grouped. Hence there cannot\r\nbe any doubt, highly curious though the fact be, that these several\r\nfossils, namely, the Hippurites, Gryphæa, Ostrea, Pecten, Turritella,\r\nNautilus, two Terebratulæ, and Spirifer all belong to the same\r\nformation, which would appear to form a passage between the oolitic and\r\ncretaceous systems of Europe. Although aware how unusual the term must\r\nsound, I shall, for convenience’ sake, call this formation\r\ncretaceo-oolitic. Comparing the sections in this valley of Coquimbo\r\nwith those in the Cordillera described in the last chapter, and bearing\r\nin mind the character of the beds in the intermediate district of Los\r\nHornos, there is certainly a close general mineralogical resemblance\r\nbetween them, both in the underlying porphyritic conglomerate, and in\r\nthe overlying gypseous formation. Considering this resemblance, and\r\nthat the fossils from the Puente del Inca at the base of the gypseous\r\nformation, and throughout the greater part of its entire thickness on\r\nthe Peuquenes range, indicate the Neocomian period,—that is, the dawn\r\nof the cretaceous system, or, as some have believed, a passage between\r\nthis latter and the oolitic series—I conclude that probably the\r\ngypseous and associated beds in all the sections hitherto described,\r\nbelong to the same great formation, which I have\r\ndenominated—cretaceo-oolitic. I may add, before leaving Coquimbo, that\r\nM. Gay found in the neighbouring Cordillera, at the height of 14,000\r\nfeet above the sea, a fossiliferous formation, including a Trigonia and\r\nPholadomya;[2]—both of which genera occur at the Puente del Inca.\r\n\r\n [2] D’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Géolog., p. 242.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo to Guasco._—The rocks near the coast, and some way inland, do\r\nnot differ from those described northwards of Valparaiso: we have\r\nmuch greenstone, syenite, feldspathic and jaspery slate, and grauwackes\r\nhaving a basis like that of claystone; there are some large tracts of\r\ngranite, in which the constituent minerals are sometimes arranged in\r\nfolia, thus composing an imperfect gneiss. There are two large\r\ndistricts of mica-schists, passing into glossy clay-slate, and\r\nresembling the great formation in the Chonos Archipelago. In the valley\r\nof Guasco, an escarpment of porphyritic conglomerate is first seen high\r\nup the valley, about two leagues eastward of the town of Ballenar. I\r\nheard of a great gypseous formation in the Cordillera; and a collection\r\nof shells made there was given me. These shells are all in the same\r\ncondition, and appear to have come from the same bed: they consist of:—\r\n\r\nTurritella Andii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\nTerebatula ignaciana, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\nThe relations of these species have been given under the head of\r\nCoquimbo.\r\n\r\nTerebratula ænigma, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\nThis shell M. d’Orbigny does not consider identical with his T. ænigma,\r\nbut near to T. obsoleta. Professor Forbes thinks that it is certainly a\r\nvariety of T. ænigma: we shall meet with this variety again at Copiapo.\r\n\r\nSpirifer Chilensis, E. Forbes.\r\nProfessor Forbes remarks that this fossil resembles several\r\ncarboniferous limestone Spirifers; and that it is also related to some\r\nliassic species, as S. Wolcotii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf these shells had been examined independently of the other\r\ncollections, they would probably have been considered, from the\r\ncharacters of the two Terebratulæ, and from the Spirifer, as oolitic;\r\nbut considering that the first species, and according to Professor\r\nForbes, the four first, are identical with those from Coquimbo, the two\r\nformations no doubt are the same, and may, as I have said, be\r\nprovisionally called cretaceo-oolitic.\r\n\r\n_Valley of Copiapo._—The journey from Guasco to Copiapo, owing to the\r\nutterly desert nature of the country, was necessarily so hurried, that\r\nI do not consider my notes worth giving. In the valley of Copiapo some\r\nof the sections are very interesting. From the sea to the town of\r\nCopiapo, a distance estimated at thirty miles, the mountains are\r\ncomposed of greenstone, granite, andesite, and blackish porphyry,\r\ntogether with some dusky-green feldspathic rocks, which I believe to be\r\naltered clay-slate: these mountains are crossed by many brown-coloured\r\ndikes, running north and south. Above the town, the main valley runs in\r\na south-east and even more southerly course towards the Cordillera,\r\nwhere it is divided into three great ravines, by the northern one of\r\nwhich, called Jolquera, I penetrated for a short distance. The section,\r\nFig. 3 in Plate V, gives an eye-sketch of the structure and composition\r\nof the mountains on both sides of this valley: a straight east and west\r\nline from the town to the Cordillera is perhaps\r\nnot more than thirty miles, but along the valley the distance is much\r\ngreater. Wherever the valley trended very southerly, I have endeavoured\r\nto contract the section into its true proportion. This valley, I may\r\nadd, rises much more gently than any other valley which I saw in Chile.\r\n\r\nTo commence with our section, for a short distance above the town we\r\nhave hills of the granitic series, together with some of that rock [A],\r\nwhich I suspect to be altered clay-slate, but which Professor G. Rose,\r\njudging from specimens collected by Meyen at P. Negro, states is\r\nserpentine passing into greenstone. We then come suddenly to the great\r\ngypseous formation [B], without having passed over, differently from,\r\nin all the sections hitherto described, any of the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate. The strata are at first either horizontal or gently\r\ninclined westward; then highly inclined in various directions, and\r\ncontorted by underlying masses of intrusive rocks; and lastly, they\r\nhave a regular eastward dip, and form a tolerably well pronounced north\r\nand south line of hills. This formation consists of thin strata, with\r\ninnumerable alternations, of black, calcareous slate-rock, of\r\ncalcareo-aluminous stones like those at Coquimbo, which I have called\r\npseudo-honestones of green jaspery layers, and of pale-purplish,\r\ncalcareous, soft rotten-stone, including seams and veins of gypsum.\r\nThese strata are conformably overlaid by a great thickness of thinly\r\nstratified, compact limestone with included crystals of carbonate of\r\nlime. At a place called Tierra Amarilla, at the foot of a mountain thus\r\ncomposed there is a broad vein, or perhaps stratum, of a beautiful and\r\ncurious crystallised mixture, composed, according to Professor G.\r\nRose,[3] of sulphate of iron under two forms, and of the sulphates of\r\ncopper and alumina: the section is so obscure that I could not make out\r\nwhether this vein or stratum occurred in the gypseous formation, or\r\nmore probably in some underlying masses [A], which I believe are\r\naltered clay-slate.\r\n\r\n [3] Meyen’s “Reise,” etc., Th. I, s. 394.\r\n\r\n_Second axis of elevation._—After the gypseous masses [B], we come to a\r\nline of hills of unstratified porphyry [C], which on their eastern side\r\nblend into strata of great thickness of porphyritic conglomerate,\r\ndipping eastward. This latter formation, however, here has not been\r\nnearly so much metamorphosed as in most parts of Central Chile; it is\r\ncomposed of beds of true purple claystone porphyry, repeatedly\r\nalternating with thick beds of purplish-red conglomerate with the\r\nwell-rounded, large pebbles of various porphyries, not blended\r\ntogether. _Third axis of elevation._—Near the ravine of Los Hornitos,\r\nthere is a well-marked line of elevation, extending for many miles in a\r\nN.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, with the strata dipping in most parts (as\r\nin the second axis) only in one direction, namely, eastward at an\r\naverage angle of between 30° and 40°. Close to the mouth of the valley,\r\nhowever, there is, as represented in the section, a steep and high\r\nmountain [D], composed of various green and brown intrusive porphyries\r\nenveloped with strata, apparently belonging to the upper parts of the\r\nporphyritic\r\nconglomerate, and dipping both eastward and westward. I will describe\r\nthe section seen on the eastern side of this mountain [D], beginning at\r\nthe base with the lowest bed visible in the porphyritic conglomerate,\r\nand proceeding upwards through the gypseous formation. Bed 1 consists\r\nof reddish and brownish porphyry varying in character, and in many\r\nparts highly amygdaloidal with carbonate of lime, and with bright green\r\nand brown bole. Its upper surface is throughout clearly defined, but\r\nthe lower surface is in most parts indistinct, and towards the summit\r\nof the mountain [D] quite blended into the intrusive porphyries. Bed 2,\r\na pale lilac, hard but not heavy stone, slightly laminated, including\r\nsmall extraneous fragments, and imperfect as well as some perfect and\r\nglassy crystals of feldspar; from one hundred and fifty to two hundred\r\nfeet in thickness. When examining it in situ, I thought it was\r\ncertainly a true porphyry, but my specimens now lead me to suspect that\r\nit possibly may be a metamorphosed tuff. From its colour it could be\r\ntraced for a long distance, overlying in one part, quite conformably to\r\nthe porphyry of bed 1, and in another not distant part, a very thick\r\nmass of conglomerate, composed of pebbles of a porphyry chiefly like\r\nthat of bed 1: this fact shows how the nature of the bottom formerly\r\nvaried in short horizontal distances. Bed 3, white, much indurated\r\ntuff, containing minute pebbles, broken crystals, and scales of mica,\r\nvaries much in thickness. This bed is remarkable from containing many\r\nglobular and pear-shaped, externally rusty balls, from the size of an\r\napple to a man’s head, of very tough, slate-coloured porphyry, with\r\nimperfect crystals of feldspar: in shape these balls do not resemble\r\npebbles, _and i believe that they are subaqueous volcanic bombs_; they\r\ndiffer from _subaerial_ bombs only in not being vesicular. Bed 4; a\r\ndull purplish-red, hard conglomerate, with crystallised particles and\r\nveins of carbonate of lime, from three hundred to four hundred feet in\r\nthickness. The pebbles are of claystone porphyries of many varieties;\r\nthey are tolerably well rounded, and vary in size from a large apple to\r\na man’s head. This bed includes three layers of coarse, black,\r\ncalcareous, somewhat slaty rock: the upper part passes into a compact\r\nred sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn a formation so highly variable in mineralogical nature, any division\r\nnot founded on fossil remains, must be extremely arbitrary:\r\nnevertheless, the beds below the last conglomerate may, in accordance\r\nwith all the sections hitherto described, be considered as belonging to\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate, and those above it to the gypseous\r\nformation, marked [E] in the section. The part of the valley in which\r\nthe following beds are seen is near Potrero Seco. Bed 5, compact,\r\nfine-grained, pale greenish-grey, non-calcareous, indurated mudstone,\r\neasily fusible into a pale green and white glass. Bed 6, purplish,\r\ncoarse-grained, hard sandstone, with broken crystals of feldspar and\r\ncrystallised particles of carbonate of lime; it possesses a slightly\r\nnodular structure. Bed 7, blackish-grey, much indurated, calcareous\r\nmudstone, with extraneous particles of unequal size; the whole being in\r\nparts finely brecciated. In this mass there is a stratum, twenty feet\r\nin thickness, of impure gypsum. Bed 8, a greenish mudstone, with\r\nseveral layers of gypsum. Bed 9,\r\na highly indurated, easily fusible, white tuff, thickly mottled with\r\nferruginous matter, and including some white semi-porcellanic layers,\r\nwhich are interlaced with ferruginous veins. This stone closely\r\nresembles some of the commonest varieties in the Uspallata chain. Bed\r\n10, a thick bed of rather bright green, indurated mudstone or tuff,\r\nwith a concretionary nodular structure so strongly developed that the\r\nwhole mass consists of balls. I will not attempt to estimate the\r\nthickness of the strata in the gypseous formation hitherto described,\r\nbut it must certainly be very many hundred feet. Bed 11 is at least 800\r\nfeet in thickness: it consists of thin layers of whitish, greenish, or\r\nmore commonly brown, fine-grained, indurated tuffs, which crumble into\r\nangular fragments: some of the layers are semi-porcellanic, many of\r\nthem highly ferruginous, and some are almost composed of carbonate of\r\nlime and iron with drusy cavities lined with quartzf-crystals. Bed 12,\r\ndull purplish or greenish or dark-grey, very compact and much indurated\r\nmudstone: estimated at 1,500 feet in thickness: in some parts this rock\r\nassumes the character of an imperfect coarse clay-slate; but viewed\r\nunder a lens, the basis always has a mottled appearance, with the edges\r\nof the minute component particles blending together. Parts are\r\ncalcareous, and there are numerous veins of highly crystalline\r\ncarbonate of lime charged with iron. The mass has a nodular structure,\r\nand is divided by only a few planes of stratification: there are,\r\nhowever, two layers, each about eighteen inches thick, of a dark brown,\r\nfiner-grained stone, having a conchoidal, semi-porcellanic fracture,\r\nwhich can be followed with the eye for some miles across the country.\r\n\r\nI believe this last great bed is covered by other nearly similar\r\nalternations; but the section is here obscured by a tilt from the next\r\nporphyritic chain, presently to be described. I have given this section\r\nin detail, as being illustrative of the general character of the\r\nmountains in this neighbourhood; but it must not be supposed that any\r\none stratum long preserves the same character. At a distance of between\r\nonly two and three miles the green mudstones and white indurated tuffs\r\nare to a great extent replaced by red sandstone and black calcareous\r\nshaly rocks, alternating together. The white indurated tuff, bed 11,\r\nhere contains little or no gypsum, whereas on the northern and opposite\r\nside of the valley, it is of much greater thickness and abounds with\r\nlayers of gypsum, some of them alternating with thin seams of\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime. The uppermost, dark-coloured, hard\r\nmudstone, bed 12, is in this neighbourhood the most constant stratum.\r\nThe whole series differs to a considerable extent, especially in its\r\nupper part, from that met with at [BB], in the lower part of the\r\nvalley; nevertheless, I do not doubt that they are equivalents. _Fourth\r\naxis of elevation (Valley of Copiapo)._—This axis is formed of a chain\r\nof mountains [F], of which the central masses (near La Punta) consist\r\nof andesite containing green hornblende and coppery mica, and the outer\r\nmasses of greenish and black porphyries, together with some fine\r\nlilac-coloured claystone porphyry; all these porphyries being injected\r\nand broken up by small hummocks of andesite. The\r\ncentral great mass of this latter rock, is covered on the eastern side\r\nby a black, fine-grained, highly micaceous slate, which, together with\r\nthe succeeding mountains of porphyry, are traversed by numerous white\r\ndikes, branching from the andesite, and some of them extending in\r\nstraight lines, to a distance of at least two miles. The mountains of\r\nporphyry eastward of the micaceous schist soon, but gradually, assume\r\n(as observed in so many other cases) a stratified structure, and can\r\nthen be recognised as a part of the porphyritic conglomerate formation.\r\nThese strata [G] are inclined at a high angle to the S.E., and form a\r\nmass from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in thickness. The\r\ngypseous masses to the west already described, dip directly towards\r\nthis axis, with the strata only in a few places (one of which is\r\nrepresented in the section) thrown from it: hence this fourth axis is\r\nmainly uniclinal towards the S.E., and just like our third axis, only\r\nlocally anticlinal.\r\n\r\nThe above strata of porphyritic conglomerate [G] with their\r\nsouth-eastward dip, come abruptly up against beds of the gypseous\r\nformation [H], which are gently, but irregularly, inclined westward: so\r\nthat there is here a synclinal axis and great fault. Further up the\r\nvalley, here running nearly north and south, the gypseous formation is\r\nprolonged for some distance; but the stratification is unintelligible,\r\nthe whole being broken up by faults, dikes, and metalliferous veins.\r\nThe strata consist chiefly of red calcareous sandstones, with numerous\r\nveins in the place of layers, of gypsum; the sandstone is associated\r\nwith some black calcareous slate-rock, and with green\r\npseudo-honestones, passing into porcelain-jasper. Still further up the\r\nvalley, near Las Amolanas [I], the gypseous strata become more regular,\r\ndipping at an angle of between 30 and 40 degrees to W.S.W., and\r\nconformably overlying, near the mouth of the ravine of Jolquera, strata\r\n[K] of porphyritic conglomerate. The whole series has been tilted by a\r\npartially concealed axis [L], of granite, andesite, and a granitic\r\nmixture of white feldspar, quartz, and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\n_Fifth axis of elevation (Valley of Copiapo, near Las Amolanas)._—I\r\nwill describe in some detail the beds [I] seen here, which, as just\r\nstated, dip to W.S.W., at an angle of from 30° to 40°. I had not time\r\nto examine the underlying porphyritic conglomerate, of which the lowest\r\nbeds, as seen at the mouth of the Jolquera, are highly compact, with\r\ncrystals of red oxide of iron; and I am not prepared to say whether\r\nthey are chiefly of volcanic or metamorphic origin. On these beds there\r\nrests a coarse purplish conglomerate, very little metamorphosed,\r\ncomposed of pebbles of porphyry, but remarkable from containing one\r\npebble of granite;—of which fact no instance has occurred in the\r\nsections hitherto described. Above this conglomerate, there is a black\r\nsiliceous claystone, and above it numerous alternations of\r\ndark-purplish and green porphyries, which may be considered as the\r\nuppermost limit of the porphyritic conglomerate formation.\r\n\r\nAbove these porphyries comes a coarse, arenaceous conglomerate, the\r\nlower half white and the upper half of a pink colour, composed chiefly\r\nof pebbles of various porphyries, but with some of red sandstone\r\nand jaspery rocks. In some of the more arenaceous parts of the\r\nconglomerate, there was an oblique or current lamination; a\r\ncircumstance which I did not elsewhere observe. Above this\r\nconglomerate, there is a vast thickness of thinly stratified,\r\npale-yellowish, siliceous sandstone, passing into a granular\r\nquartz-rock, used for grindstones (hence the name of the place _ Las\r\nAmolanas_), and certainly belonging to the gypseous formation, as does\r\nprobably the immediately underlying conglomerate. In this yellowish\r\nsandstone there are layers of white and pale-red siliceous\r\nconglomerate; other layers with small, well-rounded pebbles of white\r\nquartz, like the bed at the R. Claro at Coquimbo; others of a greenish,\r\nfine-grained, less siliceous stone, somewhat resembling the\r\npseudo-honestones lower down the valley; and lastly, others of a black\r\ncalcareous shale-rock. In one of the layers of conglomerate, there was\r\nembedded a fragment of mica-slate, of which this is the first instance;\r\nhence perhaps, it is from a formation of mica-slate, that the numerous\r\nsmall pebbles of quartz, both here and at Coquimbo, have been derived.\r\nNot only does the siliceous sandstone include layers of the black,\r\nthinly stratified, not fissile, calcareous shale-rock, but in one place\r\nthe whole mass, especially the upper part, was, in a marvellously short\r\nhorizontal distance, after frequent alternations, replaced by it. When\r\nthis occurred, a mountain-mass, several thousand feet in thickness was\r\nthus composed; the black calcareous shale-rock, however, always\r\nincluded some layers of the pale-yellowish siliceous sandstone, of the\r\nred conglomerate, and of the greenish jaspery and pseudo-honestone\r\nvarieties. It likewise included three or four widely separated layers\r\nof a brown limestone, abounding with shells immediately to be\r\ndescribed. This pile of strata was in parts traversed by many veins of\r\ngypsum. The calcareous shale-rock, though when freshly broken quite\r\nblack, weathers into an ash- colour: in which respect and in general\r\nappearance, it perfectly resembles those great fossiliferous beds of\r\nthe Peuquenes range, alternating with gypsum and red sandstone,\r\ndescribed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe shells out of the layers of brown limestone, included in the black\r\ncalcareous shale-rock, which latter, as just stated, replaces the white\r\nsiliceous sandstone, consist of:—\r\n\r\nPecten Dufreynoyi, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\nTurritella Andii, d’Orbigny, “Voyage,” Part Pal.\r\n\r\n Astarte Darwinii, E. Forbes.\r\nGryphæa Darwinii, E. Forbes.\r\nAn intermediate form between G. gigantea and G. incurva.\r\n\r\nGryphæa nov. spec.?, E. Forbes.\r\nPerna Americana, E. Forbes.\r\nAvicula, nov. spec.\r\nConsidered by Mr. G. B. Sowerby as the A. echinata, by M. d’Orbigny as\r\ncertainly a new and distinct species, having a Jurassic aspect. The\r\nspecimen has been unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerebratula ænigma, d’Orbigny, (var. of do. E. Forbes.)\r\nThis is the same variety, with that from Guasco, considered by M.\r\nD’Orbigny to be a distinct species from his T. ænigma, and related to\r\nT. obsoleta.\r\n\r\nPlagiostoma and Ammonites, fragments of.\r\n\r\nThe lower layers of the limestone contained thousands of the Gryphæa;\r\nand the upper ones as many of the Turritella, with the Gryphæa (nov.\r\nspecies) and Serpulæ adhering to them; in all the layers, the\r\nTerebratula and fragments of the Pecten were included. It was evident,\r\nfrom the manner in which species were grouped together, that they had\r\nlived where now embedded. Before making any further remarks, I may\r\nstate, that higher up this same valley we shall again meet with a\r\nsimilar association of shells; and in the great Despoblado Valley,\r\nwhich branches off near the town from that of Copiapo, the Pecten\r\nDufreynoyi, some Gryphites (I believe G. Darwinii), and the _ true_\r\nTerebratula ænigma of d’Orbigny were found together in an equivalent\r\nformation, as will be hereafter seen. A specimen also, I may add, of\r\nthe true T. ænigma, was given me from the neighbourhood of the famous\r\nsilver mines of Chanuncillo, a little south of the valley of the\r\nCopiapo, and these mines, from their position, I have no doubt, lie\r\nwithin the great gypseous formation: the rocks close to one of the\r\nsilver veins, judging from fragments shown me, resemble those singular\r\nmetamorphosed deposits from the mining district of Arqueros near\r\nCoquimbo.\r\n\r\nI will reiterate the evidence on the association of these several\r\nshells in the several localities.\r\n\r\n_Coquimbo._\r\n\r\nIn the same bed, Rio Claro:\r\n    Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\n    Ostrea hemispherica.\r\n    Terebratula ænigma.\r\n    Spirifer linguiferoides.\r\n\r\nSame bed, near Arqueros:\r\n    Hippurites Chilensis.\r\n    Gryphæa orientalis.\r\n\r\nCollected by M. Domeyko from the same locality, apparently near\r\nArqueros:\r\n    Terebratula ænigma and Terebratula ignaciana, in same block of\r\n    limestone.\r\n    Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\n    Ostrea hemispherica.\r\n    Hippurites Chilensis.\r\n    Turritella Andii.\r\n    Nautilus Domeykus.\r\n\r\n_Guasco._\r\n\r\nIn a collection from the Cordillera, given me: the specimens all in the\r\nsame condition:\r\n    Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\n    Turritella Andii.\r\n    Terebratula ignaciana.\r\n    Terebratula ænigma, _var._\r\n    Spirifer Chilensis.\r\n\r\n_Copiapo._\r\n\r\nMingled together in alternating beds in the main valley of Copiapo near\r\nLas Amolanas, and likewise higher up the valley:\r\n    Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\n    Turritella Andii.\r\n    Terebratula ænigma, _var._, as at Guasco.\r\n    Astarte Darwinii.\r\n    Gryphæa Darwinii.\r\n    Gryphæa nov. species?\r\n    Perna Americana.\r\n    Avicula, nov. species.\r\n\r\nMain valley of Copiapo, apparently same formation with that of\r\nAmolanas:\r\n    Terebratula ænigma (true).\r\n\r\nIn the same bed, high up the great lateral valley of the Despoblado, in\r\nthe ravine of Maricongo:\r\n    Terebratula ænigma (true).\r\n    Pecten Dufreynoyi.\r\n    Gryphæa Darwinii?\r\n\r\nConsidering this table, I think it is impossible to doubt that all\r\nthese fossils belong to the same formation. If, however, the species\r\nfrom Las Amolanas, in the Valley of Copiapo, had, as in the case of\r\nthose from Guasco, been separately examined, they would probably have\r\nbeen ranked as oolitic; for, although no Spirifers were found here, all\r\nthe other species, with the exception of the Pecten, Turritella, and\r\nAstarte, have a more ancient aspect than cretaceous forms. On the other\r\nhand, taking into account the evidence derived from the cretaceous\r\ncharacter of these three shells, and of the Hippurites, Gryphæa\r\norientalis, and Ostrea, from Coquimbo, we are driven back to the\r\nprovisional name already used of cretaceo-oolitic. From geological\r\nevidence, I believe this formation to be the equivalent of the\r\nNeocomian beds of the Cordillera of Central Chile.\r\n\r\nTo return to our section near Las Amolanas:—Above the yellow siliceous\r\nsandstone, or the equivalent calcareous slate-rock, with its bands of\r\nfossil-shells, according as the one or other prevails, there is a pile\r\nof strata, which cannot be less than from two to three thousand feet in\r\nthickness, in main part composed of a coarse, bright red conglomerate,\r\nwith many intercalated beds of red sandstone, and some of green and\r\nother coloured porcelain-jaspery layers. The included pebbles are\r\nwell-rounded, varying from the size of an egg to that of a\r\ncricket-ball, with a few larger; and they consist chiefly of\r\nporphyries. The basis of the conglomerate, as well as some of the\r\nalternating thin beds, are formed of a red, rather harsh, easily\r\nfusible sandstone, with crystalline calcareous particles. This whole\r\ngreat pile is remarkable from the thousands of huge, embedded,\r\nsilicified trunks of trees, one of which was eight feet long, and\r\nanother eighteen feet in circumference: how marvellous it is, that\r\nevery vessel in so thick a mass of wood should have been converted into\r\nsilex! I brought home many specimens, and all of them, according to Mr.\r\nR. Brown, present a coniferous structure.\r\n\r\nAbove this great conglomerate, we have from two to three hundred feet\r\nin thickness of red sandstone; and above this, a stratum of black\r\ncalcareous slate-rock, like that which alternates with and\r\nreplaces the underlying yellowish-white, siliceous sandstone. Close to\r\nthe junction between this upper black slate-rock and the upper red\r\nsandstone, I found the Gryphæa Darwinii, the Turritella Andii, and vast\r\nnumbers of a bivalve, too imperfect to be recognised. Hence we see\r\nthat, as far as the evidence of these two shells serves—and the\r\nTurritella is an eminently characteristic species—the whole thickness\r\nof this vast pile of strata belongs to the same age. Again, above the\r\nlast-mentioned upper red sandstone, there were several alternations of\r\nthe black, calcareous slate-rock; but I was unable to ascend to them.\r\nAll these uppermost strata, like the lower ones, vary extremely in\r\ncharacter in short horizontal distances. The gypseous formation, as\r\nhere seen, has a coarser, more mechanical texture, and contains much\r\nmore siliceous matter than the corresponding beds lower down the\r\nvalley. Its total thickness, together with the upper beds of the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate, I estimated at least at 8,000 feet; and only\r\na small portion of the porphyritic conglomerate, which on the eastern\r\nflank of the fourth axis of elevation appeared to be from fifteen\r\nhundred to two thousand feet thick, is here included. As corroborative\r\nof the great thickness of the gypseous formation, I may mention that in\r\nthe Despoblado Valley (which branches from the main valley a little\r\nabove the town of Copiapo) I found a corresponding pile of red and\r\nwhite sandstones, and of dark, calcareous, semi-jaspery mudstones,\r\nrising from a nearly level surface and thrown into an absolutely\r\nvertical position; so that, by pacing, I ascertained their thickness to\r\nbe nearly two thousand seven hundred feet; taking this as a standard of\r\ncomparison, I estimated the thickness of the strata _above_ the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate at 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe fossils before enumerated, from the limestone-layers in the whitish\r\nsiliceous sandstone, are now covered, on the least computation, by\r\nstrata from 5,000 to 6,000 feet in thickness. Professor E. Forbes\r\nthinks that these shells probably lived at a depth of from about 30 to\r\n40 fathoms, that is from 180 to 240 feet; anyhow, it is impossible that\r\nthey could have lived at the depth of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Hence\r\nin this case, as in that of the Puente del Inca, we may safely conclude\r\nthat the bottom of the sea on which the shells lived, subsided, so as\r\nto receive the superincumbent submarine strata: and this subsidence\r\nmust have taken place during the existence of these shells; for, as I\r\nhave shown, some of them occur high up as well as low down in the\r\nseries. That the bottom of the sea subsided, is in harmony with the\r\npresence of the layers of coarse, well-rounded pebbles included\r\nthroughout this whole pile of strata, as well as of the great upper\r\nmass of conglomerate from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick; for coarse gravel\r\ncould hardly have been formed or spread out at the profound depths\r\nindicated by the thickness of the strata. The subsidence, also, must\r\nhave been slow to have allowed of this often-recurrent spreading out of\r\nthe pebbles. Moreover, we shall presently see that the surfaces of some\r\nof the streams of porphyritic lava beneath the gypseous formation, are\r\nso highly amygdaloidal that it is scarcely possible to believe that\r\nthey flowed under the vast pressure of a deep ocean. The conclusion of\r\na\r\ngreat subsidence during the existence of these cretaceo-oolitic\r\nfossils, may, I believe, be extended to the district of Coquimbo,\r\nalthough owing to the fossiliferous beds there not being directly\r\ncovered by the upper gypseous strata, which in the section north of the\r\nvalley are about 6,000 feet in thickness, I did not there insist on\r\nthis conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles in the above conglomerates, both in the upper and lower\r\nbeds, are all well rounded, and, though chiefly composed of various\r\nporphyries, there are some of red sandstone and of a jaspery stone,\r\nboth like the rocks intercalated in layers in this same gypseous\r\nformation; there was one pebble of mica-slate and some of quartz,\r\ntogether with many particles of quartz. In these respects there is a\r\nwide difference between the gypseous conglomerates and those of the\r\nporphyritic-conglomerate formation, in which latter, angular and\r\nrounded fragments, almost exclusively composed of porphyries, are\r\nmingled together, and which, as already often remarked, probably were\r\nejected from craters deep under the sea. From these facts I conclude,\r\nthat during the formation of the conglomerates, land existed in the\r\nneighbourhood, on the shores of which the innumerable pebbles were\r\nrounded and thence dispersed, and on which the coniferous forests\r\nflourished—for it is improbable that so many thousand logs of wood\r\nshould have drifted from any great distance. This land, probably\r\nislands, must have been mainly formed of porphyries, with some\r\nmica-slate, whence the quartz was derived, and with some red sandstone\r\nand jaspery rocks. This latter fact is important, as it shows that in\r\nthis district, even previously to the deposition of the lower gypseous\r\nor cretaceo-oolitic beds, strata of an analogous nature had elsewhere,\r\nno doubt in the more central ranges of the Cordillera, been elevated;\r\nthus recalling to our minds the relations of the Cumbre and Uspallata\r\nchains. Having already referred to the great lateral valley of the\r\nDespoblado, I may mention that above the 2,700 feet of red and white\r\nsandstone and dark mudstone, there is a vast mass of coarse, hard, red\r\nconglomerate, some thousand feet in thickness, which contains much\r\nsilicified wood, and evidently corresponds with the great upper\r\nconglomerate at Las Amolanas: here, however, the conglomerate consists\r\nalmost exclusively of pebbles of granite, and of disintegrated crystals\r\nof reddish feldspar and quartz firmly recemented together. In this\r\ncase, we may conclude that the land whence the pebbles were derived,\r\nand on which the now silicified trees once flourished, was formed of\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThe mountains near Las Amolanas, composed of the cretaceo-oolitic\r\nstrata, are interlaced with dikes like a spider’s web, to an extent\r\nwhich I have never seen equalled, except in the denuded interior of a\r\nvolcanic crater: north and south lines, however, predominate. These\r\ndikes are composed of green, white, and blackish rocks, all porphyritic\r\nwith feldspar, and often with large crystals of hornblende. The white\r\nvarieties approach closely in character to andesite, which composes as\r\nwe have seen, the injected axes of so many of the lines of elevation.\r\nSome of the green varieties are finely laminated, parallel to the walls\r\nof the dikes.\r\n\r\n_Sixth axis of elevation (Valley of Copiapo)._—This axis consists of\r\na broad mountainous mass [O] of andesite, composed of albite, brown\r\nmica, and chlorite, passing into andesitic granite, with quartz: on its\r\nwestern side it has thrown off, at a considerable angle, a thick mass\r\nof stratified porphyries, including much epidote [NN], and remarkable\r\nonly from being divided into very thin beds, as highly amygdaloidal on\r\ntheir surfaces as subaerial lava-streams are often vesicular. This\r\nporphyritic formation is conformably covered, as seen some way up the\r\nravine of Jolquera, by a mere remnant of the lower part of the\r\ncretaceo-oolitic formation [MM], which in one part encases, as\r\nrepresented in the coloured section, the foot of the andesitic axis\r\n[L], of the already described fifth line, and in another part entirely\r\nconceals it: in this latter case, the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic\r\nstrata falsely appeared to dip under the porphyritic conglomerate of\r\nthe fifth axis. The lowest bed of the gypseous formation, as seen here\r\n[M], is of yellowish siliceous sandstone, precisely like that of\r\nAmolanas, interlaced in parts with veins of gypsum, and including\r\nlayers of the black, calcareous, non-fissile slate-rock: the _\r\nTurritella Andii, Pecten Dufreynoyi, Terebratula ænigma, var.,_ and\r\nsome Gryphites were embedded in these layers. The sandstone varies in\r\nthickness from only twenty to eighty feet; and this variation is caused\r\nby the inequalities in the upper surface of an underlying stream of\r\npurple claystone porphyry. Hence the above fossils here lie at the very\r\nbase of the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation, and hence they were\r\nprobably once covered up by strata about seven thousand feet in\r\nthickness: it is, however, possible, though from the nature of all the\r\nother sections in this district not probable, that the porphyritic\r\nclaystone lava may in this case have invaded a higher level in the\r\nseries. Above the sandstone there is a considerable mass of much\r\nindurated, purplish-black, calcareous claystone, allied in nature to\r\nthe often-mentioned black calcareous slate-rock.\r\n\r\nEastward of the broad andesitic axis of this sixth line, and penetrated\r\nby many dikes from it, there is a great formation [P] of mica-schist,\r\nwith its usual variations, and passing in one part into a ferruginous\r\nquartz-rock. The folia are curved and highly inclined, generally\r\ndipping eastward. It is probable that this mica-schist is an old\r\nformation, connected with the granitic rocks and metamorphic schists\r\nnear the coast; and that the one fragment of mica-slate, and the\r\npebbles of quartz low down in the gypseous formation at Las Amolanas,\r\nhave been derived from it. The mica-schist is succeeded by stratified\r\nporphyritic conglomerate [Q] of great thickness, dipping eastward with\r\na high inclination: I have included this latter mountain-mass in the\r\nsame anticlinal axis with the porphyritic streams [NN]; but I am far\r\nfrom sure that the two masses may not have been independently upheaved.\r\n\r\n_Seventh axis of elevation._—Proceeding up the ravine, we come to\r\nanother mass [R] of andesite; and beyond this, we again have a very\r\nthick, stratified porphyritic formation [S], dipping at a small angle\r\neastward, and forming the basal part of the main Cordillera. I did not\r\nascend the ravine any higher; but here, near Castano, I examined\r\nseveral sections, of which I will not give the details, only observing,\r\nthat the porphyritic beds, or submarine lavas, preponderate greatly in\r\nbulk over the alternating sedimentary layers, which have been but\r\nlittle metamorphosed: these latter consist of fine-grained red tuffs\r\nand of whitish volcanic grit-stones, together with much of a singular,\r\ncompact rock, having an almost crystalline basis, finely brecciated\r\nwith red and green fragments, and occasionally including a few large\r\npebbles. The porphyritic lavas are highly amygdaloidal, both on their\r\nupper and lower surfaces; they consist chiefly of claystone porphyry,\r\nbut with one common variety, like some of the streams at the Puente del\r\nInca, having a grey mottled basis, abounding with crystals of red\r\nhydrous oxide of iron, green ones apparently of epidote, and a few\r\nglassy ones of feldspar. This pile of strata differs considerably from\r\nthe basal strata of the Cordillera in Central Chile, and may possibly\r\nbelong to the upper and gypseous series: I saw, however, in the bed of\r\nthe valley, one fragment of porphyritic breccia-conglomerate, exactly\r\nlike those great masses met with in the more southern parts of Chile.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must observe, that though I have described between the town\r\nof Copiapo and the western flank of the main Cordillera seven or eight\r\naxes of elevation, extending nearly north and south, it must not be\r\nsupposed that they all run continuously for great distances. As was\r\nstated to be the case in our sections across the Cordillera of Central\r\nChile, so here most of the lines of elevation, with the exception of\r\nthe first, third, and fifth, are very short. The stratification is\r\neverywhere disturbed and intricate; nowhere have I seen more numerous\r\nfaults and dikes. The whole district, from the sea to the Cordillera,\r\nis more or less metalliferous; and I heard of gold, silver, copper,\r\nlead, mercury, and iron veins. The metamorphic action, even in the\r\nlower strata, has certainly been far less here than in Central Chile.\r\n\r\n_Valley of the Despoblado._—This great barren valley, which has already\r\nbeen alluded to, enters the main valley of Copiapo a little above the\r\ntown: it runs at first northerly, then N.E., and more easterly into the\r\nCordillera; I followed its dreary course to the foot of the first main\r\nridge. I will not give a detailed section, because it would be\r\nessentially similar to that already given, and because the\r\nstratification is exceedingly complicated. After leaving the plutonic\r\nhills near the town, I met first, as in the main valley, with the\r\ngypseous formation, having the same diversified character as before,\r\nand soon afterwards with masses of porphyritic conglomerate, about one\r\nthousand feet in thickness. In the lower part of this formation there\r\nwere very thick beds composed of fragments of claystone porphyries,\r\nboth angular and rounded, with the smaller ones partially blended\r\ntogether and the basis rendered porphyritic; these beds separated\r\ndistinct streams, from sixty to eighty feet in thickness, of claystone\r\nlavas. Near Paipote, also, there was much true porphyritic\r\nbreccia-conglomerate: nevertheless, few of these masses were\r\nmetamorphosed to the same degree with the corresponding formation in\r\nCentral Chile. I did not meet in this valley with any true andesite,\r\nbut only with imperfect andesitic porphyry, including large crystals of\r\nhornblende: numerous as have been the varieties of intrusive porphyries\r\nalready mentioned, there were here\r\nmountains composed of a new kind, having a compact, smooth,\r\ncream-coloured basis, including only a few crystals of feldspar, and\r\nmottled with dendritic spots of oxide of iron. There were also some\r\nmountains of a porphyry with a brick-red basis, containing irregular,\r\noften lens-shaped, patches of compact feldspar, and crystals of\r\nfeldspar, which latter to my surprise I find to be orthite.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the first ridge of the main Cordillera, in the ravine of\r\nMaricongo, and at an elevation which, from the extreme coldness and\r\nappearance of the vegetation, I estimated at about ten thousand feet, I\r\nfound beds of white sandstone and of limestone including the Pecten\r\nDufreynoyi, Terebratula ænigma, and some Gryphites. This ridge throws\r\nthe water on the one hand into the Pacific, and on the other, as I was\r\ninformed, into a great gravel-covered, basin-like plain, including a\r\nsalt-lake, and without any drainage-exit. In crossing the Cordillera by\r\nthis Pass, it is said that three principal ridges must be traversed,\r\ninstead of two, or only one as in Central Chile.\r\n\r\nThe crest of this first main ridge and the surrounding mountains, with\r\nthe exception of a few lofty pinnacles, are capped by a great thickness\r\nof a horizontally stratified, tufaceous deposit. The lowest bed is of a\r\npale purple colour, hard, fine-grained, and full of broken crystals of\r\nfeldspar and scales of mica. The middle bed is coarser, and less hard,\r\nand hence weathers into very sharp pinnacles; it includes very small\r\nfragments of granite, and innumerable ones of all sizes of grey\r\nvesicular trachyte, some of which were distinctly rounded. The\r\nuppermost bed is about two hundred feet in thickness, of a darker\r\ncolour and apparently hard: but I had not time to ascend to it. These\r\nthree horizontal beds may be seen for the distance of many leagues,\r\nespecially westward or in the direction of the Pacific, capping the\r\nsummits of the mountains, and standing on the opposite sides of the\r\nimmense valleys at exactly corresponding heights. If united they would\r\nform a plain, inclined very slightly towards the Pacific; the beds\r\nbecome thinner in this direction, and the tuff (judging from one point\r\nto which I ascended, some way down the valley) finer-grained and of\r\nless specific gravity, though still compact and sonorous under the\r\nhammer. The gently inclined, almost horizontal stratification, the\r\npresence of some rounded pebbles, and the compactness of the lowest\r\nbed, though rendering it probable, would not have convinced me that\r\nthis mass had been of subaqueous origin, for it is known that volcanic\r\nashes falling on land and moistened by rain often become hard and\r\nstratified; but beds thus originating, and owing their consolidation to\r\natmospheric moisture, would have covered almost equally every\r\nneighbouring summit, high and low, and would not have left those above\r\na certain exact level absolutely bare; this circumstance seems to me to\r\nprove that the volcanic ejections were arrested at their present,\r\nwidely extended, equable level, and there consolidated by some other\r\nmeans than simple atmospheric moisture; and this no doubt must have\r\nbeen a sheet of water. A lake at this great height, and without a\r\nbarrier on any one side, is out of the question; consequently we must\r\nconclude that the tufaceous matter was anciently deposited beneath the\r\nsea. It was certainly\r\ndeposited before the excavation of the valleys, or at least before\r\ntheir final enlargement;[4] and I may add, that Mr. Lambert, a\r\ngentleman well acquainted with this country, informs me, that in\r\nascending the ravine of Santandres (which branches off from the\r\nDespoblado) he met with streams of lava and much erupted matter capping\r\nall the hills of granite and porphyry, with the exception of some\r\nprojecting points; he also remarked that the valleys had been excavated\r\nsubsequently to these eruptions.\r\n\r\n [4] I have endeavoured to show in my “Journal,” etc. (2nd edit.), p.\r\n 355, that this arid valley was left by the retreating sea, as the land\r\n slowly rose, in the state in which we now see it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volcanic formation, which I am informed by Mr. Lambert extends far\r\nnorthward, is of interest, as typifying what has taken place on a\r\ngrander scale on the corresponding western side of the Cordillera of\r\nPeru. Under another point of view, however, it possesses a far higher\r\ninterest, as confirming that conclusion drawn from the structure of the\r\nfringes of stratified shingle which are prolonged from the plains at\r\nthe foot of the Cordillera far up the valleys,—namely, that this great\r\nrange has been elevated in mass to a height of between eight and nine\r\nthousand feet;[5] and now, judging from this tufaceous deposit, we may\r\nconclude that the horizontal elevation has been in the district of\r\nCopiapo about ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\n [5] I may here mention that on the south side of the main valley of\r\n Copiapo, near Potrero Seco, the mountains are capped by a thick mass\r\n of horizontally stratified shingle, at a height which I estimated at\r\n between fifteen hundred and two thousand feet above the bed of the\r\n valley. This shingle, I believe, forms the edge of a wide plain, which\r\n stretches southwards between two mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 40\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Despoblado, the stratification, as before remarked\r\nhas been much disturbed, and in some points to a greater degree than I\r\nhave anywhere else seen. I will give two cases: a very thick mass of\r\nthinly stratified red sandstone, including beds of conglomerate, has\r\nbeen crushed together (as represented in figure no. 24) into a yoke or\r\nurn-formed trough, so that the strata on both sides have been folded\r\ninwards: on the right hand the properly underlying porphyritic\r\nclaystone conglomerate is seen overlying the sandstone, but it soon\r\nbecomes vertical, and then is inclined towards the trough, so that the\r\nbeds\r\nradiate like the spokes of a wheel: on the left hand, the inverted\r\nporphyritic conglomerate also assumes a dip towards the trough, not\r\ngradually, as on the right hand, but by means of a vertical fault and\r\nsynclinal break; and a little still further on towards the left, there\r\nis a second great oblique fault (both shown by the arrow-lines), with\r\nthe strata dipping to a directly opposite point; these mountains are\r\nintersected by infinitely numerous dikes, some of which can be seen to\r\nrise from hummocks of greenstone, and can be traced for thousands of\r\nfeet. In the second case, two low ridges trend together and unite at\r\nthe head of a little wedge-shaped valley: throughout the right-hand\r\nridge, the strata dip at 45° to the east; in the left-hand ridge, we\r\nhave the very same strata and at first with exactly the same dip; but\r\nin following this ridge up the valley, the strata are seen very\r\nregularly to become more and more inclined until they stand vertical,\r\nthey then gradually fall over (the basset edges forming symmetrical\r\nserpentine lines along the crest), till at the very head of the valley\r\nthey are reversed at an angle of 45°: so that at this point the beds\r\nhave been turned through an angle of 135°; and here there is a kind of\r\nanticlinal axis, with the strata on both sides dipping to opposite\r\npoints at an angle of 45°, but those on the left hand upside down.\r\n\r\n_On the eruptive sources of the porphyritic claystone and greenstone\r\nlavas._—In Central Chile, from the extreme metamorphic action, it is in\r\nmost parts difficult to distinguish between the streams of porphyritic\r\nlava and the porphyritic breccia-conglomerate, but here, at Copiapo,\r\nthey are generally perfectly distinct, and in the Despoblado, I saw for\r\nthe first time, two great strata of purple claystone porphyry, after\r\nhaving been for a considerable space closely united together, one above\r\nthe other, become separated by a mass of fragmentary matter, and then\r\nboth thin out;—the lower one more rapidly than the upper and greater\r\nstream. Considering the number and thickness of the streams of\r\nporphyritic lava, and the great thickness of the beds of\r\nbreccia-conglomerate, there can be little doubt that the sources of\r\neruption must originally have been numerous: nevertheless, it is now\r\nmost difficult even to conjecture the precise point of any one of the\r\nancient submarine craters. I have repeatedly observed mountains of\r\nporphyries, more or less distinctly stratified towards their summits or\r\non their flanks, without a trace of stratification in their central and\r\nbasal parts: in most cases, I believe this is simply due either to the\r\nobliterating effects of metamorphic action, or to such parts having\r\nbeen mainly formed of intrusive porphyries, or to both causes\r\nconjoined; in some instances, however, it appeared to me very probable\r\nthat the great central unstratified masses of porphyry were the now\r\npartially denuded nuclei of the old submarine volcanoes, and that the\r\nstratified parts marked the points whence the streams flowed. In one\r\ncase alone, and it was in this Valley of the Despoblado, I was able\r\nactually to trace a thick stratum of purplish porphyry, which for a\r\nspace of some miles conformably overlay the usual alternating beds of\r\nbreccia-conglomerates and claystone lavas, until it became united with,\r\nand blended into, a mountainous mass of various unstratified\r\nporphyries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of tracing the streams of porphyries to their ancient\r\nand doubtless numerous eruptive sources, may be partly explained by the\r\nvery general disturbance which the Cordillera in most parts has\r\nsuffered; but I strongly suspect that there is a more specific cause,\r\nnamely, _that the original points of eruption tend to become the points\r\nof injection._ This in itself does not seem improbable; for where the\r\nearth’s crust has once yielded, it would be liable to yield again,\r\nthough the liquified intrusive matter might not be any longer enabled\r\nto reach the submarine surface and flow as lava. I have been led to\r\nthis conclusion, from having so frequently observed that, where part of\r\nan unstratified mountain-mass resembled in mineralogical character the\r\nadjoining streams or strata, there were several other kinds of\r\nintrusive porphyries and andesitic rocks injected into the same point.\r\nAs these intrusive mountain-masses form most of the axes-lines in the\r\nCordillera, whether anticlinal, uniclinal, or synclinal, and as the\r\nmain valleys have generally been hollowed out along these lines, the\r\nintrusive masses have generally suffered much denudation. Hence they\r\nare apt to stand in some degree isolated, and to be situated at the\r\npoints where the valleys abruptly bend, or where the main tributaries\r\nenter. On this view of there being a tendency in the old points of\r\neruption to become the points of subsequent injection and disturbance,\r\nand consequently of denudation, it ceases to be surprising that the\r\nstreams of lava in the porphyritic claystone conglomerate formation,\r\nand in other analogous cases, should most rarely be traceable to their\r\nactual sources.\r\n\r\n_Iquique, Southern Peru._—Differently from what we have seen throughout\r\nChile, the coast here is formed not by the granitic series, but by an\r\nescarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate formation, between two and\r\nthree thousand feet in height.[6] I had time only for a very short\r\nexamination; the chief part of the escarpment appears to be composed of\r\nvarious reddish and purple, sometimes laminated, porphyries, resembling\r\nthose of Chile; and I saw some of the porphyritic breccia-conglomerate;\r\nthe stratification appeared but little inclined. The uppermost part,\r\njudging from the rocks near the famous silver mine of\r\nHuantajaya,[7]consists of laminated, impure, argillaceous,\r\npurplish-grey limestone, associated, I believe, with some purple\r\nsandstone. In the limestone shells are found: the three following\r\nspecies were given me:—\r\n\r\n    Lucina Americana, E. Forbes.\r\n    Terebratula inca, E. Forbes.\r\n    Terebratula ænigma, D’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n [6] The lowest point, where the road crosses the coast-escarpment, is\r\n 1,900 feet by the barometer above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] Mr. Bollaert has described (“Geolog. Proceedings,” vol. ii, p.\r\n 598, a singular mass of stratified detritus, gravel, and sand,\r\n eighty-one yards in thickness, overlying the limestone, and abounding\r\n with loose masses of silver ore. The miners believe that they can\r\n attribute these masses to their proper veins.\r\n\r\nThis latter species we have seen associated with the fossils of which\r\nlists have been given in this chapter, in two places in the valley of\r\nCoquimbo, and in the ravine of Maricongo at Copiapo. Considering this\r\nfact, and the superposition of these beds on the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation; and, as we shall immediately see, from their\r\ncontaining much gypsum, and from their otherwise close general\r\nresemblance in mineralogical nature with the strata described in the\r\nvalley of Copiapo, I have little doubt that these fossiliferous beds of\r\nIquique belong to the great cretaceo-oolitic formation of Northern\r\nChile. Iquique is situated seven degrees latitude north of Copiapo; and\r\nI may here mention, that an Ammonites, nov. species, and an Astarte,\r\nnov. species, were given me from the Cerro Pasco, about ten degrees of\r\nlatitude north of Iquique, and M. D’Orbigny thinks that they probably\r\nindicate a Neocomian formation. Again, fifteen degrees of latitude\r\nnorthward, in Colombia, there is a grand fossiliferous deposit, now\r\nwell known from the labours of Von Buch, Lea, d’Orbigny, and Forbes,\r\nwhich belongs to the earlier stages of the cretaceous system. Hence,\r\nbearing in mind the character of the few fossils from Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthere is some evidence that a great portion of the stratified deposits\r\nof the whole vast range of the South American Cordillera belongs to\r\nabout the same geological epoch.\r\n\r\nProceeding from the coast escarpment inwards, I crossed, in a space of\r\nabout thirty miles, an elevated undulatory district, with the beds\r\ndipping in various directions. The rocks are of many kinds,—white\r\nlaminated, sometimes siliceous sandstone,—purple and red sandstone,\r\nsometimes so highly calcareous as to have a crystalline\r\nfracture,—argillaceous limestone,—black calcareous slate-rock, like\r\nthat so often described at Copiapo and other places,—thinly laminated,\r\nfine-grained, greenish, indurated, sedimentary, fusible rocks,\r\napproaching in character to the so-called pseudo-honestone of Chile,\r\nincluding thin contemporaneous veins of gypsum,—and lastly, much\r\ncalcareous, laminated porcelain jasper, of a green colour, with red\r\nspots, and of extremely easy fusibility: I noticed one conformable\r\nstratum of a freckled-brown, feldspathic lava. I may here mention that\r\nI heard of great beds of gypsum in the Cordillera. The only novel point\r\nin this formation, is the presence of innumerable thin layers of\r\nrock-salt, alternating with the laminated and hard, but sometimes\r\nearthy, yellowish, or bright red and ferruginous sandstones. The\r\nthickest layer of salt was only two inches, and it thinned out at both\r\nends. On one of these saliferous masses I noticed a stratum about\r\ntwelve feet thick, of dark-brown, hard brecciated, easily fusible rock,\r\ncontaining grains of quartz and of black oxide of iron, together with\r\nnumerous imperfect fragments of shells. The problem of the origin of\r\nsalt is so obscure, that every fact, even geographical position, is\r\nworth recording.[8] With the exception of\r\nthese saliferous beds, most of the rocks as already remarked, present a\r\nstriking general resemblance with the upper parts of the gypseous or\r\ncretaceo-oolitic formation of Chile.\r\n\r\n [8] It is well known that stratified salt is found in several places\r\n on the shores of Peru. The island of San Lorenzo, off Lima, is\r\n composed of a pile of thin strata, about eight hundred feet in\r\n thickness, composed of yellowish and purplish, hard siliceous, or\r\n earthy sandstones, alternating with thin layers of shale, which in\r\n places passes into a greenish, semi-porcellanic, fusible rock. There\r\n are some thin beds of reddish mudstone, and soft ferruginous\r\n rotten-stones, with layers of gypsum. In nearly all these varieties,\r\n especially in the softer sandstones, there are numerous thin seams of\r\n rock-salt: I was informed that one layer has been found two inches in\r\n thickness. The manner in which the minutest fissures of the dislocated\r\n beds have been penetrated by the salt, apparently by subsequent\r\n infiltration, is very curious. On the south side of the island, layers\r\n of coal and of impure limestone have been discovered. Hence we here\r\n have salt, gypsum, and coal associated together. The strata include\r\n veins of quartz, carbonate of lime, and iron pyrites; they have been\r\n dislocated by an injected mass of greenish-brown feldspathic trap.\r\n    Not only is salt abundant on the extreme western limits of the\r\n    district between the Cordillera and the Pacific, but, according to\r\n    Helms, it is found in the outlying low hills on the eastern flank\r\n    of the Cordillera. These facts appear to me opposed to the theory,\r\n    that rock-salt is due to the sinking of water, charged with salt,\r\n    in mediterranean spaces of the ocean. The general character of the\r\n    geology of these countries would rather lead to the opinion, that\r\n    its origin is in some way connected with volcanic heat at the\r\n    bottom of the sea: see on this subject Sir R. Murchison’s\r\n    “Anniversary Address to Geolog. Soc., 1843,” p. 65.)\r\n\r\n_Metalliferous Veins._\r\n\r\nI have only a few remarks to make on this subject: in nine mining\r\ndistricts, some of them of considerable extent, which I visited in\r\n_Central_ Chile, I found the _principal_ veins running from between [N.\r\nand N.W.] to [S. and S.E.];[9] at the C. de los Hornos (further\r\nnorthward), it is N.N.W. and S.S.E.; at Panuncillo, it is N.N.W. and\r\nS.S.E.; and, lastly, at Arqueros, the direction is N.W. and S.E.): in\r\nsome other places, however, their courses appeared quite irregular, as\r\nis said to be generally the case in the whole valley of Copiapo: at\r\nTambillos, south of Coquimbo, I saw one large copper vein extending\r\neast and west. It is worthy of notice, that the foliation of the gneiss\r\nand mica-slate, where such rocks occur, certainly tend to run like the\r\nmetalliferous veins, though often irregularly, in a direction a little\r\nwestward of north. At Yaquil, I observed that the principal auriferous\r\nveins ran nearly parallel to the grain or imperfect cleavage of the\r\nsurrounding _granitic_ rocks. With respect to the distribution of the\r\ndifferent metals, copper, gold, and iron are generally associated\r\ntogether, and are most frequently found (but with many exceptions, as\r\nwe shall presently see) in the rocks of the lower series, between the\r\nCordillera and the Pacific, namely, in granite, syenite, altered\r\nfeldspathic clay-slate, gneiss, and as near Guasco mica-schist.\r\nThe copper-ores consist of sulphurets, oxides, and carbonates,\r\nsometimes with laminæ of native metal: I was assured that in some cases\r\n(as at Panuncillo S.E. of Coquimbo), the upper part of the same vein\r\ncontains oxides, and the lower part sulphurets of copper.[10] Gold\r\noccurs in its native form; it is believed that, in many cases, the\r\nupper part of the vein is the most productive part: this fact probably\r\nis connected with the abundance of this metal in the stratified\r\ndetritus of Chile, which must have been chiefly derived from the\r\ndegradation of the upper portions of the rocks. These superficial beds\r\nof well-rounded gravel and sand, containing gold, appeared to me to\r\nhave been formed under the sea close to the beach, during the slow\r\nelevation of the land: Schmidtmeyer[11] remarks that in Chile gold is\r\nsought for in shelving banks at the height of some feet on the sides of\r\nthe streams, and not in their beds, as would have been the case had\r\nthis metal been deposited by common alluvial action. Very frequently\r\nthe copper-ores, including some gold, are associated with abundant\r\nmicaceous specular iron. Gold is often found in iron-pyrites: at two\r\ngold mines at Yaquil (near Nancagua), I was informed by the proprietor\r\nthat in one the gold was always associated with copper-pyrites, and in\r\nthe other with iron-pyrites: in this latter case, it is said that if\r\nthe vein ceases to contain iron-pyrites, it is yet worth while to\r\ncontinue the search, but if the iron-pyrites, when it reappears, is not\r\nauriferous, it is better at once to give up working the vein. Although\r\nI believe copper and gold are most frequently found in the lower\r\ngranitic and metamorphic schistose series, yet these metals occur both\r\nin the porphyritic conglomerate formation (as on the flanks of the Bell\r\nof Quillota and at Jajuel), and in the superincumbent strata. At Jajuel\r\nI was informed that the copper-ore, with some gold, is found only in\r\nthe greenstones and altered feldspathic clay-slate, which alternate\r\nwith the purple porphyritic conglomerate. Several gold veins and some\r\nof copper-ore are worked in several parts of the Uspallata range, both\r\nin the metamorphosed strata, which have been shown to have been of\r\nprobably subsequent origin to the Neocomian or gypseous formation of\r\nthe main Cordillera, and in the intrusive andesitic rocks of that\r\nrange. At Los Hornos (N.E. of Illapel), likewise, there are numerous\r\nveins of copper-pyrites and of gold, both in the strata of the gypseous\r\nformation and in the injected hills of andesite and various porphyries.\r\n\r\n [9] These mining districts are Yaquil near Nancagua, where the\r\n direction of the chief veins, to which only in all cases I refer, is\r\n north and south; in the Uspallata range, the prevailing line is N.N.W.\r\n and S.S.E.; in the C. de Prado, it is N.N.W. and S.S.E.; near Illapel,\r\n it is N. by W. and S. by E.; at Los Hornos the direction varies from\r\n between [N. and N.W.] to [S. and S.E.].\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] The same fact has been observed by Mr. Taylor in Cuba: _London\r\n Phil. Journ.,_ vol. xi, p. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] “Travels in Chile,” p. 29.\r\n\r\nSilver, in the form of a chloride, sulphuret, or an amalgam, or in its\r\nnative state, and associated with lead and other metals, and at\r\nArqueros with pure native copper, occurs chiefly in the upper great\r\ngypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation which forms probably the richest\r\nmass in Chile. We may instance the mining districts of Arqueros near\r\nCoquimbo, and of nearly the whole valley of Copiapo, and of Iquique\r\n(where the principal veins run N.E. by E. and S.W. by W.), in Peru.\r\nHence comes Molina’s remark, that silver is born in the cold and\r\nsolitary deserts of the Upper Cordillera. There are, however,\r\nexceptions to\r\nthis rule: at Paral (S.E. of Coquimbo) silver is found in the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation; as I suspect is likewise the case\r\nat S. Pedro de Nolasko in the Peuquenes Pass. Rich argentiferous lead\r\nis found in the clay-slate of the Uspallata range; and I saw an old\r\nsilver-mine in a hill of syenite at the foot of the Bell of Quillota: I\r\nwas also assured that silver has been found in the andesitic and\r\nporphyritic region between the town of Copiapo and the Pacific. I have\r\nstated in a previous part of this chapter, that in two neighbouring\r\nmines at Arqueros the veins in one were productive when they traversed\r\nthe singular green sedimentary beds, and unproductive when crossing the\r\nreddish beds; whereas at the other mine exactly the reverse takes\r\nplace; I have also described the singular and rare case of numerous\r\nparticles of native silver and of the chloride being disseminated in\r\nthe green rock at the distance of a yard from the vein. Mercury occurs\r\nwith silver both at Arqueros and at Copiapo: at the base of C. de los\r\nHornos (S.E. of Coquimbo, a different place from Los Hornos, before\r\nmentioned) I saw in a syenitic rock numerous quartzose veins,\r\ncontaining a little cinnabar in nests: there were here other parallel\r\nveins of copper and of a ferrugino-auriferous ore. I believe tin has\r\nnever been found in Chile.\r\n\r\nFrom information given me by Mr. Nixon of Yaquil,[12] and by others, it\r\nappears that in Chile those veins are generally most permanently\r\nproductive, which, consisting of various minerals (sometimes differing\r\nbut slightly from the surrounding rocks), include parallel strings\r\n_rich_ in metals; such a vein is called a _veta real._ More commonly\r\nthe mines are worked only where one, two, or more thin veins or strings\r\nrunning in a different direction, intersect a _poor_ “veta real:” it is\r\nunanimously believed that at such points of intersection (_cruceros_),\r\nthe quantity of metal is much greater than that contained in other\r\nparts of the intersecting veins. In some _ cruceros_ or points of\r\nintersection, the metals extend even beyond the walls of the main,\r\nbroad, stony vein. It is said that the greater the angle of\r\nintersection, the greater the produce; and that nearly parallel strings\r\nattract each other; in the Uspallata range, I observed that numerous\r\nthin auri-ferruginous veins repeatedly ran into knots, and then\r\nbranched out again. I have already described the remarkable manner in\r\nwhich rocks of the Uspallata range are indurated and blackened (as if\r\nby a blast of gunpowder) to a considerable distance from the metallic\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n [12] At the Durazno mine, the gold is associated with copper-pyrites,\r\n and the veins contain large prisms of plumbago. Crystallised carbonate\r\n of lime is one of the commonest minerals in the matrix of the Chilean\r\n veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I may observe, that the presence of metallic veins seems\r\nobviously connected with the presence of intrusive rocks, and with the\r\ndegree of metamorphic action which the different districts of Chile\r\nhave undergone.[13] Such metamorphosed areas are generally accompanied\r\nby numerous dikes and injected masses of andesite and various\r\nporphyries: I have in several places traced the metalliferous veins\r\nfrom\r\nthe intrusive masses into the encasing strata. Knowing that the\r\nporphyritic conglomerate formation consists of alternate streams of\r\nsubmarine lavas and of the debris of anciently erupted rocks, and that\r\nthe strata of the upper gypseous formation sometimes include submarine\r\nlavas, and are composed of tuffs, mudstones, and mineral substances,\r\nprobably due to volcanic exhalations,—the richness of these strata is\r\nhighly remarkable when compared with the erupted beds, often of\r\nsubmarine origin, but _not metamorphosed,_ which compose the numerous\r\nislands in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans; for in these\r\nislands metals are entirely absent, and their nature even unknown to\r\nthe aborigines.\r\n\r\n [13] Sir R. Murchison and his fellow travellers have given some\r\n striking facts on this subject in their account of the Ural Mountains\r\n (“Geolog. Proc.,” vol. iii, p. 748.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Geological History of the Chilean Cordillera, and of\r\nthe Southern Parts of South America._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the shores of the Pacific, for a space of 1,200 miles\r\nfrom Tres Montes to Copiapo, and I believe for a very much greater\r\ndistance, are composed, with the exception of the tertiary basins, of\r\nmetamorphic schists, plutonic rocks, and more or less altered\r\nclay-slate. On the floor of the ocean thus constituted, vast streams of\r\nvarious purplish claystone and greenstone porphyries were poured forth,\r\ntogether with great alternating piles of angular and rounded fragments\r\nof similar rocks ejected from the submarine craters. From the\r\ncompactness of the streams and fragments, it is probable that, with the\r\nexception of some districts in Northern Chile, the eruptions took place\r\nin profoundly deep water. The orifices of eruption appear to have been\r\nstudded over a breadth, with some outliers, of from fifty to one\r\nhundred miles: and closely enough together, both north and south, and\r\neast and west, for the ejected matter to form a continuous mass, which\r\nin Central Chile is more than a mile in thickness. I traced this\r\nmould-like mass, for only 450 miles; but judging from what I saw at\r\nIquique, from specimens, and from published accounts, it appears to\r\nhave a manifold greater length. In the basal parts of the series, and\r\nespecially towards the flanks of the range, mud, since converted into a\r\nfeldspathic slaty rock, and sometimes into greenstone, was occasionally\r\ndeposited between the beds of erupted matter: with this exception the\r\nuniformity of the porphyritic rocks is very remarkable. At the period\r\nwhen the claystone and greenstone porphyries nearly or quite ceased\r\nbeing erupted, that great pile of strata which, from often abounding\r\nwith gypsum, I have generally called the gypseous formation was\r\ndeposited, and feldspathic lavas, together with other singular volcanic\r\nrocks, were occasionally poured forth: I am far from pretending that\r\nany distinct line of demarcation can be drawn between this formation\r\nand the underlying porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate, but in a\r\nmass of such great thickness, and between beds of such widely different\r\nmineralogical nature, some division was necessary. At about the\r\ncommencement of the gypseous period, the bottom of the sea here seems\r\nfirst to have been peopled by shells, not many in kind,\r\nbut abounding in individuals. At the P. del Inca the fossils are\r\nembedded near the base of the formation; in the Peuquenes range, at\r\ndifferent levels, halfway up, and even higher in the series; hence, in\r\nthese sections, the whole pile of strata belongs to the same period:\r\nthe same remark is applicable to the beds at Copiapo, which attain a\r\nthickness of between seven and eight thousand feet. The fossil shells\r\nin the Cordillera of Central Chile, in the opinion of all the\r\npalæontologists who have examined them, belong to the earlier stages of\r\nthe cretaceous system; whilst in Northern Chile there is a most\r\nsingular mixture of cretaceous and oolitic forms: from the geological\r\nrelations, however, of these two districts, I cannot but think that\r\nthey all belong to nearly the same epoch, which I have provisionally\r\ncalled cretaceo-oolitic.\r\n\r\nThe strata in this formation, composed of black calcareous shaly-rocks\r\nof red and white, and sometimes siliceous sandstone, of coarse\r\nconglomerates, limestones, tuffs, dark mudstones, and those singular\r\nfine-grained rocks which I have called pseudo-honestones, vast beds of\r\ngypsum, and many other jaspery and scarcely describable varieties, vary\r\nand replace each other in short horizontal distances, to an extent, I\r\nbelieve, unequalled even in any tertiary basin. Most of these\r\nsubstances are easily fusible, and have apparently been derived either\r\nfrom volcanoes still in quiet action, or from the attrition of volcanic\r\nproducts. If we picture to ourselves the bottom of the sea, rendered\r\nuneven in an extreme degree, with numerous craters, some few\r\noccasionally in eruption, but the greater number in the state of\r\nsolfataras, discharging calcareous, siliceous, ferruginous matters, and\r\ngypsum or sulphuric acid to an amount surpassing, perhaps, even the\r\nexisting sulphureous volcanoes of Java,[14] we shall probably\r\nunderstand the circumstances under which this singular pile of varying\r\nstrata was accumulated. The shells appear to have lived at the\r\nquiescent periods when only limestone or calcareo-argillaceous matter\r\nwas depositing. From Dr. Gillies’ account, this gypseous or\r\ncretaceo-oolitic formation extends as far south as the Pass of\r\nPlanchon, and I followed it northward at intervals for 500 miles:\r\njudging from the character of the beds with the _Terebratula ænigma,_\r\nat Iquique, it extends from four to five hundred miles further: and\r\nperhaps even for ten degrees of latitude north of Iquique to the Cerro\r\nPasco, not far from Lima: again, we know that a cretaceous formation,\r\nabounding with fossils, is largely developed north of the equator, in\r\nColombia: in Tierra del Fuego, at about this same period, a wide\r\ndistrict of clay-slate was deposited, which in its mineralogical\r\ncharacters and external features, might be compared to the Silurian\r\nregions of North Wales. The gypseous formation, like that of the\r\nporphyritic breccia-conglomerate on which it rests, is of\r\ninconsiderable breadth; though of greater breadth in Northern than in\r\nCentral Chile.\r\n\r\n [14] Von Buch’s “Descript. Physique des Iles Canaries,” p. 428.\r\n\r\nAs the fossil shells in this formation are covered, in the Peuquenes\r\nridge, by a great thickness of strata; at the Puente del Inca, by at\r\nleast five thousand feet; at Coquimbo, though the superposition there\r\nis less plainly seen, by about six thousand feet; and at Copiapo,\r\ncertainly by five or\r\nsix thousand, and probably by seven thousand feet (the same species\r\nthere recurring in the upper and lower parts of the series), we may\r\nfeel confident that the bottom of the sea subsided during this\r\ncretaceo-oolitic period, so as to allow of the accumulation of the\r\nsuperincumbent submarine strata. This conclusion is confirmed by, or\r\nperhaps rather explains, the presence of the many beds at many levels\r\nof coarse conglomerate, the well-rounded pebbles in which we cannot\r\nbelieve were transported in very deep water. Even the underlying\r\nporphyries at Copiapo. with their highly amygdaloidal surfaces, do not\r\nappear to have flowed under great pressure. The great sinking movement\r\nthus plainly indicated, must have extended in a north and south line\r\nfor at least four hundred miles, and probably was co-extensive with the\r\ngypseous formation.\r\n\r\nThe beds of conglomerate just referred to, and the extraordinarily\r\nnumerous silicified trunks of fir-trees at Los Hornos, perhaps at\r\nCoquimbo and at two distant points in the valley of Copiapo, indicate\r\nthat land existed at this period in the neighbourhood. This land, or\r\nislands, in the northern part of the district of Copiapo, must have\r\nbeen almost exclusively composed, judging from the nature of the\r\npebbles of granite: in the southern parts of Copiapo, it must have been\r\nmainly formed of claystone porphyries, with some mica-schist, and with\r\nmuch sandstone and jaspery rocks exactly like the rocks in the gypseous\r\nformation, and no doubt belonging to its basal series. In several other\r\nplaces also, during the accumulation of the gypseous formation, its\r\nbasal parts and the underlying porphyritic conglomerate must likewise\r\nhave been already partially upheaved and exposed to wear and tear; near\r\nthe Puente del Inca and at Coquimbo, there must have existed masses of\r\nmica-schist or some such rock, whence were derived the many small\r\npebbles of opaque quartz. It follows from these facts, that in some\r\nparts of the Cordillera the upper beds of the gypseous formation must\r\nlie unconformably on the lower beds; and the whole gypseous formation,\r\nin parts, unconformably on the porphyritic conglomerate; although I saw\r\nno such cases, yet in many places the gypseous formation is entirely\r\nabsent; and this, although no doubt generally caused by quite\r\nsubsequent denudation, may in others be due to the underlying\r\nporphyritic conglomerate having been locally upheaved before the\r\ndeposition of the gypseous strata, and thus having become the source of\r\nthe pebbles of porphyry embedded in them. In the porphyritic\r\nconglomerate formation, in its lower and middle parts, there is very\r\nrarely any evidence, with the exception of the small quartz pebbles at\r\nJajuel near Aconcagua, and of the single pebble of granite at Copiapo,\r\nof the existence of neighbouring land: in the upper parts, however, and\r\nespecially in the district of Copiapo, the number of thoroughly\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of compact porphyries make me believe, that, as\r\nduring the prolonged accumulation of the gypseous formation the lower\r\nbeds had already been locally upheaved and exposed to wear and tear, so\r\nit was with the porphyritic conglomerate. Hence in following thus far\r\nthe geological history of the Cordillera, it may be inferred that the\r\nbed of a deep and open, or nearly open, ocean was filled up by\r\nporphyritic\r\neruptions, aided probably by some general and some local elevations, to\r\nthat comparatively shallow level at which the cretaceo-oolitic shells\r\nfirst lived. At this period, the submarine craters yielded at intervals\r\na prodigious supply of gypsum and other mineral exhalations, and\r\noccasionally, in certain places poured forth lavas, chiefly of a\r\nfeldspathic nature: at this period, islands clothed with fir-trees and\r\ncomposed of porphyries, primary rocks, and the lower gypseous strata\r\nhad already been locally upheaved, and exposed to the action of the\r\nwaves;—the general movement, however, at this time having been over a\r\nvery wide area, one of slow subsidence, prolonged till the bed of the\r\nsea sank several thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIn Central Chile, after the deposition of a great thickness of the\r\ngypseous strata, and after their upheaval, by which the Cumbre and\r\nadjoining ranges were formed, a vast pile of tufaceous matter and\r\nsubmarine lava was accumulated, where the Uspallata chain now stands;\r\nalso after the deposition and upheaval of the equivalent gypseous\r\nstrata of the Peuquenes range, the great thick mass of conglomerate in\r\nthe valley of Tenuyan was accumulated: during the deposition of the\r\nUspallata strata, we know absolutely, from the buried vertical trees,\r\nthat there was a subsidence of some thousand feet; and we may infer\r\nfrom the nature of the conglomerate in the valley of Tenuyan, that a\r\nsimilar and perhaps contemporaneous movement there took place. We have,\r\nthen, evidence of a second great period of subsidence; and, as in the\r\ncase of the subsidence which accompanied the accumulation of the\r\ncretaceo-oolitic strata, so this latter subsidence appears to have been\r\ncomplicated by alternate or local elevatory movement— for the vertical\r\ntrees, buried in the midst of the Uspallata strata, must have grown on\r\ndry land, formed by the upheaval of the lower submarine beds. Presently\r\nI shall have to recapitulate the facts, showing that at a still later\r\nperiod, namely, at nearly the commencement of the old tertiary deposits\r\nof Patagonia and of Chile, the continent stood at nearly its present\r\nlevel, and then, for the third time, slowly subsided to the amount of\r\nseveral hundred feet, and was afterwards slowly re-uplifted to its\r\npresent level.\r\n\r\nThe highest peaks of the Cordillera appear to consist of active or more\r\ncommonly dormant volcanoes,—such as Tupungato, Maypu, and Aconcagua,\r\nwhich latter stands 23,000 feet above the level of the sea, and many\r\nothers. The next highest peaks are formed of the gypseous and\r\nporphyritic strata, thrown into vertical or highly inclined positions.\r\nBesides the elevation thus gained by angular displacements, I infer,\r\nwithout any hesitation—from the stratified gravel-fringes which gently\r\nslope up the valleys of the Cordillera from the gravel-capped plains at\r\ntheir base, which latter are connected with the plains, still covered\r\nwith recent shells on the coast—that this great range has been upheaved\r\nin mass by a slow movement, to an amount of at least 8,000 feet. In the\r\nDespoblado Valley, north of Copiapo, the horizontal elevation, judging\r\nfrom the compact, stratified tufaceous deposit, capping the distant\r\nmountains at corresponding heights, was about ten thousand feet. It is\r\nvery possible, or rather probable, that this elevation in mass may not\r\nhave\r\nbeen strictly horizontal, but more energetic under the Cordillera, than\r\ntowards the coast on either side; nevertheless, movements of this kind\r\nmay be conveniently distinguished from those by which strata have been\r\nabruptly broken and upturned. When viewing the Cordillera, before\r\nhaving read Mr. Hopkins’s profound “Researches on Physical Geology,”\r\nthe conviction was impressed on me, that the angular dislocations,\r\nhowever violent, were quite subordinate in importance to the great\r\nupward movement in mass, and that they had been caused by the edges of\r\nthe wide fissures, which necessarily resulted from the tension of the\r\nelevated area, having yielded to the inward rush of fluidified rock,\r\nand having thus been upturned.\r\n\r\nThe ridges formed by the angularly upheaved strata are seldom of great\r\nlength: in the central parts of the Cordillera they are generally\r\nparallel to each other, and run in north and south lines; but towards\r\nthe flanks they often extend more or less obliquely. The angular\r\ndisplacement has been much more violent in the central than in the\r\nexterior _main_ lines; but it has likewise been violent in some of the\r\n_minor_ lines on the extreme flanks. The violence has been very unequal\r\non the same short lines; the crust having apparently tended to yield on\r\ncertain points along the lines of fissures. These points, I have\r\nendeavoured to show, were probably first foci of eruption, and\r\nafterwards of injected masses of porphyry and andesite.[15] The close\r\nsimilarity of the andesitic granites and porphyries, throughout Chile,\r\nTierra del Fuego, and even in Peru, is very remarkable. The prevalence\r\nof feldspar cleaving like albite, is common not only to the andesites,\r\nbut (as I infer from the high authority of Professor G. Rose, as well\r\nas from my own measurements) to the various claystone and greenstone\r\nporphyries, and to the trachytic lavas of the Cordillera. The andesitic\r\nrocks have in most cases been the last injected ones, and they probably\r\nform a continuous dome under this great range: they stand in intimate\r\nrelationship with the modern lavas; and they seem to have been the\r\nimmediate agent in metamorphosing the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation, and often likewise the gypseous strata, to the extraordinary\r\nextent to which they have suffered.\r\n\r\n [15] Sir R. Murchison and his companions state (“Geolog. Proc.,” vol.\r\n iii, p. 747), that no true granite appears in the higher Ural\r\n Mountains; but that syenitic greenstone—a rock closely analogous to\r\n our andesite—is far the most abundant of the intrusive masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the age at which the several parallel ridges composing\r\nthe Cordillera were upthrown, I have little evidence. Many of them may\r\nhave been contemporaneously elevated and injected in the same\r\nmanner[16] as in volcanic archipelagoes lavas are contemporaneously\r\nejected on the parallel lines of fissure. But the pebbles apparently\r\nderived from the wear and tear of the porphyritic conglomerate\r\nformation, which are occasionally present in the upper parts of this\r\nsame formation, and are often present in the gypseous formation,\r\ntogether with the pebbles from the basal parts of the latter formation\r\nin its upper strata, render it almost certain that portions, we may\r\ninfer ridges,\r\nof these two formations were successively upheaved. In the case of the\r\ngigantic Portillo range, we may feel almost certain that a preexisting\r\ngranitic line was upraised (not by a single blow, as shown by the\r\nhighly inclined basaltic streams in the valley on its eastern flank) at\r\na period long subsequent to the upheavement of the parallel Peuquenes\r\nrange.[17] Again, subsequently to the upheavement of the Cumbre chain,\r\nthat of Uspallata was formed and elevated; and afterwards, I may add,\r\nin the plain of Uspallata, beds of sand and gravel were violently\r\nupthrown. The manner in which the various kinds of porphyries and\r\nandesites have been injected one into the other, and in which the\r\ninfinitely numerous dikes of various composition intersect each other,\r\nplainly show that the stratified crust has been stretched and yielded\r\nmany times over the same points. With respect to the age of the axes of\r\nelevation between the Pacific and the Cordillera, I know little: but\r\nthere are some lines which must—namely, those running north and south\r\nin Chiloe, those eight or nine east and west, parallel, far-extended,\r\nmost symmetrical uniclinal lines at P. Rumena, and the short N.W.-S.E.\r\nand N.E.-S.W. lines at Concepcion—have been upheaved long after the\r\nformation of the Cordillera. Even during the earthquake of 1835, when\r\nthe linear north and south islet of St. Mary was uplifted several feet\r\nabove the surrounding area, we perhaps see one feeble step in the\r\nformation of a subordinate mountain-axis. In some cases, moreover, for\r\ninstance, near the baths of Cauquenes, I was forcibly struck with the\r\nsmall size of the breaches cut through the exterior mountain-ranges,\r\ncompared with the size of the same valleys higher up where entering the\r\nCordillera; and this circumstance appeared to me scarcely explicable,\r\nexcept on the idea of the exterior lines having been subsequently\r\nupthrown, and therefore having been exposed to a less amount of\r\ndenudation. From the manner in which the fringes of gravel are\r\nprolonged in unbroken slopes up the valleys of the Cordillera, I infer\r\nthat most of the greater dislocations took place during the earlier\r\nparts of the great elevation in mass: I have, however, elsewhere given\r\na case, and M. de Tschudi[18] has given another, of a ridge thrown up\r\nin Peru across the bed of a river, and consequently after the final\r\nelevation of the country above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n [16] “Volcanic Islands,” etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] I have endeavoured to show in my “Journal” (2nd edit., p. 321),\r\n that the singular fact of the river, which drains the valley between\r\n these two ranges, passing through the Portillo and higher line, is\r\n explained by its slow and subsequent elevation. There are many\r\n analogous cases in the drainage of rivers: see _ Edinburgh New Phil.\r\n Journal,_ vol. xxviii, pp. 33 and 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] “Reise in Peru,” Band 2, s. 8: Author’s “Journal,” 2nd edit., p.\r\n 359.\r\n\r\nAscending to the older tertiary formations, I will not again\r\nrecapitulate the remarks already given at the end of the Fifth\r\nChapter,—on their great extent, especially along the shores of the\r\nAtlantic—on their antiquity, perhaps corresponding with that of the\r\neocene deposits of Europe,—on the almost entire dissimilarity, though\r\nthe formations are apparently contemporaneous, of the fossils from the\r\neastern and western coasts, as is likewise the case, even in a still\r\nmore marked degree, with the shells now living in these opposite though\r\napproximate\r\nseas,—on the climate of this period not having been more tropical than\r\nwhat might have been expected from the latitudes of the places under\r\nwhich the deposits occur; a circumstance rendered well worthy of\r\nnotice, from the contrast with what is known to have been the case\r\nduring the older tertiary periods of Europe, and likewise from the fact\r\nof the southern hemisphere having suffered at a much later period,\r\napparently at the same time with the northern hemisphere, a colder or\r\nmore equable temperature, as shown by the zones formerly affected by\r\nice-action. Nor will I recapitulate the proofs of the bottom of the\r\nsea, both on the eastern and western coast, having subsided seven or\r\neight hundred feet during this tertiary period; the movement having\r\napparently been co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with the deposits\r\nof this age. Nor will I again give the facts and reasoning on which the\r\nproposition was founded, that when the bed of the sea is either\r\nstationary or rising, circumstances are far less favourable than when\r\nits level is sinking, to the accumulation of conchiferous deposits of\r\nsufficient thickness, extension, and hardness to resist, when upheaved,\r\nthe ordinary vast amount of denudation. We have seen that the highly\r\nremarkable fact of the absence of any _ extensive_ formations\r\ncontaining recent shells, either on the eastern or western coasts of\r\nthe continent,—though these coasts now abound with living\r\nmollusca,—though they are, and apparently have always been, as\r\nfavourable for the deposition of sediment as they were when the\r\ntertiary formations were copiously deposited,—and though they have been\r\nupheaved to an amount quite sufficient to bring up strata from the\r\ndepths the most fertile for animal life—can be explained in accordance\r\nwith the above proposition. As a deduction, it was also attempted to be\r\nshown, first, that the want of close sequence in the fossils of\r\nsuccessive formations, and of successive stages in the same formation,\r\nwould follow from the improbability of the same area continuing slowly\r\nto subside from one whole period to another, or even during a single\r\nentire period; and secondly, that certain epochs having been favourable\r\nat distant points, in the same quarter of the world for the synchronous\r\naccumulation of fossiliferous strata, would follow from movements of\r\nsubsidence having apparently, like those of elevation,\r\ncontemporaneously affected very large areas.\r\n\r\nThere is another point which deserves some notice, namely, the analogy\r\nbetween the upper parts of the Patagonian tertiary formation, as well\r\nas of the upper possibly contemporaneous beds at Chiloe and Concepcion,\r\nwith the great gypseous formation of Cordillera; for in both\r\nformations, the rocks, in their fusible nature, in their containing\r\ngypsum, and in many other characters, show a connection, either\r\nintimate or remote, with volcanic action; and as the strata in both\r\nwere accumulated during subsidence, it appears at first natural to\r\nconnect this sinking movement with a state of high activity in the\r\nneighbouring volcanoes. During the cretaceo-oolitic period this\r\ncertainly appears to have been the case at the Puente del Inca, judging\r\nfrom the number of intercalated lava-streams in the lower 3,000 feet of\r\nstrata; but generally, the volcanic orifices seem at this time to have\r\nexisted as submarine solfataras, and were certainly quiescent compared\r\nwith their state\r\nduring the accumulation of the porphyritic conglomerate formation.\r\nDuring the deposition of the tertiary strata we know that at S. Cruz,\r\ndeluges of basaltic lava were poured forth; but as these lie in the\r\nupper part of the series, it is possible that the subsidence may at\r\nthat time have ceased: at Chiloe, I was unable to ascertain to what\r\npart of the series the pile of lavas belonged. The Uspallata tuffs and\r\ngreat streams of submarine lavas, were probably intermediate in age\r\nbetween the cretaceo-oolitic and older tertiary formations, and we know\r\nfrom the buried trees that there was a great subsidence during their\r\naccumulation; but even in this case, the subsidence may not have been\r\nstrictly contemporaneous with the great volcanic eruptions, for we must\r\nbelieve in at least one intercalated period of elevation, during which\r\nthe ground was upraised on which the now buried trees grew. I have been\r\nled to make these remarks, and to throw some doubt on the strict\r\ncontemporaneousness of high volcanic activity and movements of\r\nsubsidence, from the conviction impressed on my mind by the study of\r\ncoral formations,[19] that these two actions do not generally go on\r\nsynchronously;—on the contrary, that in volcanic districts, subsidence\r\nceases as soon as the orifices burst forth into renewed action, and\r\nonly recommences when they again have become dormant.\r\n\r\n [19] “The Structure, etc., of Coral Reefs.”\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the Pampean mud, of estuary origin, was deposited\r\nover a wide area,—in one district conformably on the underlying old\r\ntertiary strata, and in another district unconformably on them, after\r\ntheir upheaval and denudation. During and before the accumulation,\r\nhowever, of these old tertiary strata, and, therefore, at a very remote\r\nperiod, sediment, strikingly resembling that of the Pampas, was\r\ndeposited; showing during how long a time in this case the same\r\nagencies were at work in the same area. The deposition of the Pampean\r\nestuary mud was accompanied, at least in the southern parts of the\r\nPampas, by an elevatory movement, so that the M. Hermoso beds probably\r\nwere accumulated after the upheaval of those round the S. Ventana; and\r\nthose at P. Alta after the upheaval of the M. Hermoso strata; but there\r\nis some reason to suspect that one period of subsidence intervened,\r\nduring which mud was deposited over the coarse sand of the Barrancas de\r\nS. Gregorio, and on the higher parts of Banda Oriental. The mammiferous\r\nanimals characteristic of this formation, many of which differ as much\r\nfrom the present inhabitants of South America, as do the eocene mammals\r\nof Europe from the present ones of that quarter of the globe, certainly\r\nco-existed at B. Blanca with twenty species of mollusca, one balanus,\r\nand two corals, all now living in the adjoining sea: this is likewise\r\nthe case in Patagonia with the Macrauchenia, which co-existed with\r\neight shells, still the commonest kinds on that coast. I will not\r\nrepeat what I have elsewhere said, on the place of habitation, food,\r\nwide range, and extinction of the numerous gigantic mammifers, which at\r\nthis late period inhabited the two Americas.\r\n\r\nThe nature and grouping of the shells embedded in the old tertiary\r\nformations of Patagonia and Chile show us, that the continent at that\r\nperiod must have stood only a few fathoms below its present level, and\r\nthat afterwards it subsided over a wide area, seven or eight hundred\r\nfeet. The manner in which it has since been rebrought up to its actual\r\nlevel, was described in detail in the First and Second Chapters. It was\r\nthere shown that recent shells are found on the shores of the Atlantic,\r\nfrom Tierra del Fuego northward for a space of at least 1,180 nautical\r\nmiles, and at the height of about 100 feet in La Plata, and of 400 feet\r\nin Patagonia. The elevatory movements on this side of the continent\r\nhave been slow; and the coast of Patagonia, up to the height in one\r\npart of 950 feet and in another of 1,200 feet, is modelled into eight\r\ngreat, step-like, gravel-capped plains, extending for hundreds of miles\r\nwith the same heights; this fact shows that the periods of denudation\r\n(which, judging from the amount of matter removed, must have been long\r\ncontinued) and of elevation were synchronous over surprisingly great\r\nlengths of coasts. On the shores of the Pacific, upraised shells of\r\nrecent species, generally, though not always, in the same proportional\r\nnumbers as in the adjoining sea, have actually been found over a north\r\nand south space of 2,075 miles, and there is reason to believe that\r\nthey occur over a space of 2,480 miles. The elevation on this western\r\nside of the continent has not been equable; at Valparaiso, within the\r\nperiod during which upraised shells have remained undecayed on the\r\nsurface, it has been 1,300 feet, whilst at Coquimbo, 200 miles\r\nnorthward, it has been within this same period only 252 feet. At Lima,\r\nthe land has been uplifted at least 80 feet since Indian man inhabited\r\nthat district; but the level within historical times apparently has\r\nsubsided. At Coquimbo, in a height of 364 feet, the elevation has been\r\ninterrupted by five periods of comparative rest. At several places the\r\nland has been lately, or still is, rising both insensibly and by sudden\r\nstarts of a few feet during earthquake-shocks; this shows that these\r\ntwo kinds of upward movement are intimately connected together. For a\r\nspace of 775 miles, upraised recent shells are found on the two\r\nopposite sides of the continent; and in the southern half of this\r\nspace, it may be safely inferred from the slope of the land up to the\r\nCordillera, and from the shells found in the central part of Tierra del\r\nFuego, and high up the River Santa Cruz, that the entire breadth of the\r\ncontinent has been uplifted. From the general occurrence on both coasts\r\nof successive lines of escarpments, of sand-dunes and marks of erosion,\r\nwe must conclude that the elevatory movement has been normally\r\ninterrupted by periods, when the land either was stationary, or when it\r\nrose at so slow a rate as not to resist the average denuding power of\r\nthe waves, or when it subsided. In the case of the present high\r\nsea-cliffs of Patagonia and in other analogous instances, we have seen\r\nthat the difficulty in understanding how strata can be removed at those\r\ndepths under the sea, at which the currents and oscillations of the\r\nwater are depositing a smooth surface of mud, sand, and sifted pebbles,\r\nleads to the suspicion that the formation or denudation of such cliffs\r\nhas been accompanied by a sinking movement.\r\n\r\nIn South America, everything has taken place on a grand scale, and all\r\ngeological phenomena are still in active operation. We know how violent\r\nat the present day the earthquakes are, we have seen how great\r\nan area is now rising, and the plains of tertiary origin are of vast\r\ndimensions; an almost straight line can be drawn from Tierra del Fuego\r\nfor 1,600 miles northward, and probably for a much greater distance,\r\nwhich shall intersect no formation older than the Patagonian deposits;\r\nso equable has been the upheaval of the beds, that throughout this long\r\nline, not a fault in the stratification or abrupt dislocation was\r\nanywhere observable. Looking to the basal, metamorphic, and plutonic\r\nrocks of the continent, the areas formed of them are likewise vast; and\r\ntheir planes of cleavage and foliation strike over surprisingly great\r\nspaces in uniform directions. The Cordillera, with its pinnacles here\r\nand there rising upwards of twenty thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea, ranges in an unbroken line from Tierra del Fuego, apparently to\r\nthe Arctic circle. This grand range has suffered both the most violent\r\ndislocations, and slow, though grand, upward and downward movements in\r\nmass; I know not whether the spectacle of its immense valleys, with\r\nmountain-masses of once liquified and intrusive rocks now bared and\r\nintersected, or whether the view of those plains, composed of shingle\r\nand sediment hence derived, which stretch to the borders of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, is best adapted to excite our astonishment at the\r\namount of wear and tear which these mountains have undergone.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera from Tierra del Fuego to Mexico, is penetrated by\r\nvolcanic orifices, and those now in action are connected in great\r\ntrains. The intimate relation between their recent eruptions and the\r\nslow elevation of the continent in mass,[20] appears to me highly\r\nimportant, for no explanation of the one phenomenon can be considered\r\nas satisfactory which is not applicable to the other. The permanence of\r\nthe volcanic action on this chain of mountains is, also, a striking\r\nfact; first, we have the deluges of submarine lavas alternating with\r\nthe porphyritic conglomerate strata, then occasionally feldspathic\r\nstreams and abundant mineral exhalations during the gypseous or\r\ncretaceo-oolitic period: then the eruptions of the Uspallata range, and\r\nat an ancient but unknown period, when the sea came up to the eastern\r\nfoot of the Cordillera, streams of basaltic lava at the foot of the\r\nPortillo range; then the old tertiary eruptions; and lastly, there are\r\nhere and there amongst the mountains, much worn and apparently very\r\nancient volcanic formations without any craters; there are, also,\r\ncraters quite extinct, and others in the condition of solfataras, and\r\nothers occasionally or habitually in fierce action. Hence it would\r\nappear that the Cordillera has been, probably with some quiescent\r\nperiods, a source of volcanic matter from an epoch anterior to our\r\ncretaceo-oolitic formation to the present day; and now the earthquakes,\r\ndaily recurrent on some part of the western coast, give little hope\r\nthat the subterranean energy is expended.\r\n\r\n [20] On the Connection of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America:\r\n “Geolog. Transact.,” vol. v, p. 609.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecurring to the evidence by which it was shown that some at least of\r\nthe parallel ridges, which together compose the Cordillera, were\r\nsuccessively and slowly upthrown at widely different periods; and that\r\nthe whole range certainly once, and almost certainly twice, subsided\r\nsome thousand feet, and being then brought up by a slow movement\r\nin mass, again, during the old tertiary formations, subsided several\r\nhundred feet, and again was brought up to its present level by a slow\r\nand often interrupted movement; we see how opposed is this complicated\r\nhistory of changes slowly effected, to the views of those geologists\r\nwho believe that this great mountain-chain was formed in late times by\r\na single blow. I have endeavoured elsewhere to show,[21] that the\r\nexcessively disturbed condition of the strata in the Cordillera, so far\r\nfrom indicating single periods of extreme violence, presents\r\ninsuperable difficulties, except on the admission that the masses of\r\nonce liquified rocks of the axes were repeatedly injected with\r\nintervals sufficiently long for their successive cooling and\r\nconsolidation. Finally, if we look to the analogies drawn from the\r\nchanges now in progress in the earth’s crust, whether to the manner in\r\nwhich volcanic matter is erupted, or to the manner in which the land is\r\nhistorically known to have risen and sunk: or again, if we look to the\r\nvast amount of denudation which every part of the Cordillera has\r\nobviously suffered, the changes through which it has been brought into\r\nits present condition, will appear neither to have been too slowly\r\neffected, nor to have been too complicated.\r\n\r\n [21] “Geolog. Transact.,” vol. v, p. 626.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—As, both in France and England, translations of a passage in\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg’s Memoir, often referred to in the Fourth Chapter\r\nof this volume, have appeared, implying that Professor Ehrenberg\r\nbelieves, from the character of the infusoria, that the Pampean\r\nformation was deposited by a sea-debacle rushing over the land, I may\r\nstate, on the authority of a letter to me, that these translations are\r\nincorrect. The following is the passage in question:—“Durch Beachtung\r\nder mikroscopischen Formen hat sich nun feststellen lassen, das die\r\nMastodonten-Lager am La Plata und die Knochen-Lager am Monte Hermoso,\r\nwho wie die der Riesen-Gürtelthiere in den Dünenhügeln bei Bahia\r\nBlanca, beides in Patagonien, unveränderte brakische\r\nSüsswasserbildungen sind, die einst wohl sämmtlich zum obersten\r\nFluthgebiethe des Meeres im tieferen Festlande\r\ngehörten.”—_Monatsberichten der königl.
