It is an attempt--perhaps somewhat\r\nbold--to present in a popular form an account of the great industry which\r\nhas arisen out of the waste from the gas-works. In the strictest sense it\r\nis a romance of dirt. To render intelligible the various stages in the\r\nevolution of the industry, without assuming any knowledge of chemical\r\nscience on the part of the general reader, has by no means been an easy\r\ntask, and I have great misgivings as to the success of my effort. But\r\nthere is so much misapprehension concerning the history and the mode of\r\nproduction of colouring-matters from coal-tar, that any attempt to strip\r\nthe industry of its mystery in this, the land of its birth, cannot but\r\nfind justification. Although the theme is a favourite one with popular\r\nlecturers, it is generally treated in a superficial way, leaving the\r\naudience only in possession of the bare fact that dyestuffs, &c., have by\r\nsome means or other been obtained from coal-tar. I have endeavoured to go\r\nsomewhat beyond this, and to give some notion of the scientific principles\r\nunderlying the subject. If the reader can follow these pages, in which not\r\na chemical formula appears, with the same interest and with the same\r\ndesire to know more about the subject that was manifested by the audience\r\nat the London Institution, before whom the lecture was delivered, my\r\nobject will have been accomplished. To the Board of Managers of that\r\nInstitution my thanks are due for the opportunity which they have afforded\r\nme of attempting to extend that popular knowledge of applied science for\r\nwhich there is such a healthy craving in the public mind at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  R.

Ages\r\nbefore man, or the species of animals and plants which are contemporaneous\r\nwith him, had appeared upon the globe, there flourished a vegetation not\r\nonly remarkable for its luxuriance, but also for the circumstance that it\r\nconsisted to a preponderating extent of non-flowering or cryptogamic\r\nplants. In swampy areas, such as the deltas at the mouths of great rivers,\r\nor in shallow lagoons bordering a coast margin, the jungles of ferns and\r\ntree-ferns, club-mosses and horse-tails, sedges, grasses, &c., grew and\r\ndied down year by year, forming a consolidated mass of vegetable matter\r\nmuch in the same way that a peat bed or a mangrove swamp is accumulating\r\norganic deposits at the present time. In the course of geological change\r\nthese beds of compressed vegetation became gradually depressed, so that\r\nmarine or fresh-water sediment was deposited over them, and then once more\r\nthe vegetation spread and flourished to furnish another accumulation of\r\nvegetable matter, which in its turn became submerged and buried under\r\nsediment, and so on in successive alternations of organic and sedimentary\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nBut these conditions of climate, and the distribution of land and water\r\nfavourable to the accumulation of large deposits of vegetable matter,\r\ngradually gave way to a new order of things. The animals and plants\r\nadapted to the particular conditions of existence described above gave\r\nrise to descendants modified to meet the new conditions of life. Enormous\r\nthicknesses of other deposits were laid down over the beds of vegetable\r\nremains and their intercalated strata of clay, shale, sandstone, and\r\nlimestone. The chapter of the earth's history thus sealed up and stowed\r\naway among her geological records relates to a period now known as the\r\nCarboniferous, because of the prevalence of seams or beds of coal\r\nthroughout the formation at certain levels. By the slow process of\r\nchemical decomposition without access of air, modified also by the\r\nmechanical pressure of superincumbent formations, the vegetable deposits\r\naccumulated in the manner described have, in the lapse of ages, become\r\ntransformed into the substance now familiar to us as coal.\r\n\r\nAlthough coal is thus essentially a product of Carboniferous age, it must\r\nnot be concluded that this mineral is found in no other geological\r\nformation. The conditions favourable for the deposition of beds of\r\nvegetable matter have prevailed again and again, at various periods of\r\ngeological time and on different parts of the earth, although there is at\r\npresent no distinct evidence that such a luxuriant growth of vegetation,\r\ncombined with the other necessary conditions, has ever existed at any\r\nother period in the history of the globe. Thus in the very oldest rocks of\r\nCanada and the northern States of America, in strata which take us back to\r\nthe dawn of geological history, there is found abundance of the mineral\r\ngraphite, the substance from which black-lead pencils are made, which is\r\nalmost pure carbon. Now most geologists admit that graphite represents the\r\ncarbon which formed part of the woody tissue of plants that lived during\r\nthose remote times, so that this mineral represents coal in the ultimate\r\nstage of carbonization. In some few instances true coal has been found\r\nconverted into graphite _in situ_ by the intrusion of veins of volcanic\r\nrock (basalt), so that the connection between the two minerals is more\r\nthan a mere matter of surmise.\r\n\r\nThen again we have coal of pre-Carboniferous age in the Old Red Sandstone\r\nof Scotland, this being of course younger in point of time than the\r\ngraphite of the Archaean rocks. Coal of post-Carboniferous date is found in\r\nbeds of Permian age in Bavaria, of Triassic age in Germany, in the\r\nInferior Oolite of Yorkshire belonging to the Jurassic period, and in the\r\nLower Cretaceous deposits of north-western Germany. Coming down to more\r\nrecent geological periods, we have a coal seam of over thirty feet in\r\nthickness in the northern Tyrol of Eocene age; we have brown coal deposits\r\nof Oligocene age in Belgium and Austria, and, most remarkable of all, coal\r\nhas been found of Miocene, that is, mid-Tertiary age, in the Arctic\r\nregions of Greenland within a few degrees of the North Pole. Thus the\r\nformation of coal appears to have been going on in one area or another\r\never since vegetable life appeared on the globe, and in the peat bogs,\r\ndelta jungles, and mangrove swamps of the present time we may be said to\r\nhave the deposition of potential coal deposits for future ages now going\r\non.\r\n\r\nAlthough in some parts of the world coal seams of pre-Carboniferous age\r\noften reach the dignity of workable thickness, the coal worked in this\r\ncountry is entirely of Carboniferous date. After the explanation of the\r\nmode of formation of coal which has been given, the phenomena presented by\r\na section through any of our coal measures will be readily intelligible\r\n(see Fig. 1). We find seams of coal separated by beds of sandstone,\r\nlimestone, or shale representing the encroachment of the sea and the\r\ndeposition of marine or estuarine sediment over the beds of vegetable\r\nremains. The seams of coal, varying in thickness from a few inches to\r\nthree or four feet, always rest on a bed of clay, known technically as the\r\n\"underclay,\" which represents the soil on which the plants originally\r\ngrew. In some instances the seams of coal with their thin \"partings\" of\r\nclay reach an aggregate thickness of twenty to thirty feet. In many cases\r\nthe very roots of the trees are found upright in a fossilized condition in\r\nthe underclay, and can be traced upwards into the overlying coal beds; or\r\nthe completely carbonized trunk is found erect in the position in which\r\nthe tree lived and died (see Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Section through Carboniferous strata showing seams\r\nof coal. Dislocations, or \"faults,\" so common in the Coal Measures, are\r\nshown at H, T, and F. Intrusions of igneous rock are shown at D. At B is\r\nshown the coalescence of two seams, and at N the local thinning of the\r\nseam.

B, coal seams.\r\nC, underclay. D, sandstone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the chemical and mechanical forces to which the original\r\nvegetable deposit has been subjected, the organic structure of coal has\r\nfor the most part been lost. Occasionally, however, portions of leaves,\r\nstems, and the structure of woody fibre can be detected, and thin sections\r\noften show the presence of spore-cases of club-mosses in such numbers that\r\ncertain kinds of coal appear to be entirely composed of such remains. But\r\nalthough coal itself now furnishes but little direct evidence of its\r\nvegetable origin, the interstratified clays, shales, and other deposits\r\noften abound with fossilized plant remains in every state of\r\npreservation, from the most delicate fern frond to the prostrate tree\r\ntrunk many yards in length. It is from such evidence that our knowledge of\r\nthe Carboniferous flora has been chiefly derived.\r\n\r\nNow this carbonized vegetation of a past age, the history of which has\r\nbeen briefly sketched in the foregoing pages, is one of the chief sources\r\nof our industrial supremacy as a nation. We use it as fuel for generating\r\nthe steam which drives our engines, or for the production of heat wherever\r\nheat is wanted. In metallurgical operations we consume enormous quantities\r\nof coal for extracting metals from their ores, this consumption being\r\nespecially great in the case of iron smelting. For this last operation\r\nsome kinds of raw coal are unsuitable, and such coal is converted into\r\ncoke before being used in the blast furnace. The fact that the iron ore\r\nand the coal occur in the same district is another cause of our high rank\r\nas a manufacturing nation.\r\n\r\nIt has often been a matter of wonder that iron ore and the material\r\nessential for extracting the metal from it should be found associated\r\ntogether, but it is most likely that this combination of circumstances,\r\nwhich has been so fortunate for our industrial prosperity, is not a mere\r\nmatter of accident, but the result of cause and effect. It is, in fact,\r\nprobable that the iron ore owes its origin to the reduction and\r\nprecipitation of iron compounds by the decomposing vegetation of the\r\nCarboniferous period, and this would account for the occurrence of the\r\nbands of ironstone in the same deposits with the coal. In former times,\r\nwhen the area in the south-east of England known as the Weald was thickly\r\nwooded, the towns and villages of this district were the chief centres of\r\nthe iron manufacture. The ore, which was of a different kind to that found\r\nin the coal-fields, was smelted by means of the charcoal obtained from the\r\nwood of the Wealden forests, and the manufacture lingered on in Kent,\r\nSussex, and Surrey till late in the last century, the railings round St.\r\nPaul's, London, being made from the last of the Sussex iron. When the\r\nnorthern coal-fields came to be extensively worked, and ironstone was\r\nfound so conveniently at hand, the Wealden iron manufacture declined, and\r\nin many places in the district we now find disused furnaces and heaps of\r\nburied slag as the last witnesses of an extinct industry.\r\n\r\nFrom coal we not only get mechanical work when we burn it to generate heat\r\nunder a steam boiler, but we also get chemical work out of it when we\r\nemploy it to reduce a metallic ore, or when we make use of it as a source\r\nof carbon in the manufacture of certain chemical products, such as the\r\nalkalies. We have therefore in coal a substance which supplies us with the\r\npower of doing work, either mechanical, chemical, or some other form, and\r\nanything which does this is said to be a source of energy. It is a\r\nfamiliar doctrine of modern science that energy, like matter, is\r\nindestructible. The different forms of energy can be converted into one\r\nanother, such, for example, as chemical energy into heat or electricity,\r\nheat into mechanical work or electricity, electricity into heat, and so\r\nforth, but the relationship between these convertible forms is fixed and\r\ninvariable. From a given quantity of chemical energy represented, let us\r\nsay, by a certain weight of coal, we can get a certain fixed amount of\r\nheat and no more. We can employ that heat to work a steam-engine, which we\r\ncan in turn use as a source of electricity by causing it to drive a\r\ndynamo-machine. Then this doctrine of science teaches us that our given\r\nweight of coal in burning evolves a quantity of heat which is the\r\nequivalent of the chemical energy which it contains, and that this\r\nquantity of heat has also its equivalent in mechanical work or in\r\nelectricity. This great principle--known as the Conservation of\r\nEnergy--has been gradually established by the joint labours of many\r\nphilosophers from the time of Newton downwards, and foremost among these\r\nmust be ranked the late James Prescott Joule, who was the first to measure\r\naccurately the exact amount of work corresponding to a given quantity of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn measuring heat (as distinguished from temperature) it is customary to\r\ntake as a unit the quantity necessary to raise a given weight of water\r\nfrom one specified temperature to another. In measuring work, it is\r\ncustomary to take as a unit the amount necessary to raise a certain weight\r\nat a specified place to a certain height against the force of gravity at\r\nthat place. Joule's unit of heat is the quantity necessary to raise one\r\npound of water from 60 deg. to 61 deg. F., and his unit of work is the foot-pound,\r\n_i.e._ the quantity necessary to raise a weight of one pound to a height\r\nof one foot. Now the quantitative relationship between heat and work\r\nmeasured by Joule is expressed by saying that the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat is about 772 foot-pounds, which means that the quantity of heat that\r\nwould raise one pound of water 1 deg. F. would, if converted into work, be\r\ncapable of raising a one-pound weight to a height of 772 feet, or a weight\r\nof 772 lbs. to a height of one foot.\r\n\r\nThis mechanical equivalent ought to tell us exactly how much power is\r\nobtainable from a certain weight of coal if we measure the quantity of\r\nheat given out when it is completely burnt. Thus an average Lancashire\r\ncoal is said to have a calorific power of 13,890, which means that 1 lb.\r\nof such coal on complete combustion would raise 13,890 lbs. of water\r\nthrough a temperature of 1 deg. F., if we could collect all the heat generated\r\nand apply it to this purpose. But if we express this quantity of heat in\r\nits mechanical equivalent, and suppose that we could get the corresponding\r\nquantity of work out of our pound of coal, we should be grievously\r\nmistaken. For in the first place, we could not collect all the heat given\r\nout, because a great deal is communicated to the products of combustion by\r\nwhich it is absorbed, and locked up in a form that renders it incapable of\r\nmeasurement by our thermometers. In the next place, if we make an\r\nallowance for the quantity of heat which thus disappears, even then the\r\ncorrected calorific power converted into its mechanical equivalent would\r\nnot express the quantity of work practically obtainable from the coal.\r\n\r\nIn the most perfectly constructed engine the whole amount of heat\r\ngenerated by the combustion of the coal is not available for heating the\r\nboiler--a certain quantity is lost by radiation, by heating the material\r\nof the furnace, &c., by being carried away by the products of combustion\r\nand in other ways. Moreover, some of the coal escapes combustion by being\r\nallowed to go away as smoke, or by remaining as cinders. Then again, in\r\nthe engine itself a good deal of heat is lost through various channels,\r\nand much of the working power is frittered away through friction, which\r\nreconverts the mechanical power into its equivalent in heat, only this\r\nheat is not available for further work, and is thus lost so far as the\r\nefficiency of the engine is concerned. These sources of loss are for the\r\nmost part unavoidable, and are incidental to the necessary imperfections\r\nof our mechanism. But even with the most perfectly conceivable constructed\r\nengine it has been proved that we can only expect one-sixth of the total\r\nenergy of the fuel to appear in the form of work, and in a very good\r\nsteam-engine of the present time we only realize in the form of useful\r\nwork about one-tenth of the whole quantity of energy contained in the\r\ncoal. Although steam power is one of the most useful agencies that science\r\nhas placed at the disposal of man, it is not generally recognized by the\r\nuninitiated how wasteful we are of Nature's resources. One of the greatest\r\nproblems of applied science yet to be solved is the conversion of the\r\nenergy latent in coal or other fuel into a quantity of useful work\r\napproximating to the mechanical equivalent much more closely than has\r\nhitherto been accomplished.\r\n\r\nBut although we only get this small fraction of the whole working\r\ncapability out of coal, the actual amount of energy dormant in this\r\nsubstance cannot but strike us as being prodigious. It has already been\r\nsaid that a pound of coal on complete combustion gives out 13,890 heat\r\nunits. This quantity of heat corresponds to over 10,000,000 foot-pounds of\r\nwork. A horse-power may be considered as corresponding to 550 foot-pounds\r\nof work per second, or 1,980,000 foot-pounds per hour. Thus our pound of\r\ncoal contains a store of energy which, if capable of being completely\r\nconverted into work without loss, would in one hour do the work of about\r\nfive and a half horses. The strangest tales of necromancy can hardly be so\r\nstartling as these sober figures when introduced for the first time to\r\nthose unaccustomed to consider the stupendous powers of Nature.\r\n\r\nIf energy is indestructible, we have a right to inquire in the next place\r\nfrom whence the coal has derived this enormous store. A consideration of\r\nthe origin of coal, and of its chemical composition, will enable this\r\nquestion to be answered. The origin of coal has already been discussed.\r\nChemically considered, it consists chiefly of carbon together with smaller\r\nquantities of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and a certain amount of\r\nmineral matter which is left as ash when the coal is burnt. The following\r\naverage analyses of different varieties will give an idea of its chemical\r\ncomposition:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Variety of Coal. | Carbon. | Hydrogen. | Oxygen. | Nitrogen. | Ash.\r\n  -------------------+---------+-----------+---------+-----------+-----\r\n  S. Staffordshire   |  73.4   |    5.0    |  11.7   |    1.7    | 2.3\r\n  Newcastle (Caking) |  80.0   |    5.3    |  10.7   |    2.2    | 1.7\r\n  Cannel (Wigan)     |  81.2   |    5.6    |   7.9   |    2.1    | 2.5\r\n  Anthracite (Welsh) |  90.1   |    3.2    |   2.5   |    0.8    | 1.6\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are in addition to these constituents small quantities of sulphur\r\nand a certain variable amount of water (5 to 10 per cent.) in all coals,\r\nbut the elements which most concern us are those heading the respective\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing analyses, which express the percentage composition, it\r\nwill be seen that carbon is by far the most important constituent of coal.\r\nCarbon is a chemical element which is found in a crystalline form in\r\nnature as the diamond, and which forms a most important constituent of all\r\nliving matter, whether animal or vegetable. Woody fibre contains a large\r\nquantity of this element, and the carbon of coal is thus accounted for; it\r\nwas accumulated during the growth of the plants of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNow carbon is one of those elementary substances which are said to be\r\n_combustible_, which means that if we heat it in atmospheric air it gives\r\nout heat and light, and gradually disappears, or, as we say, burns away.\r\nThe heat which is given out during combustion represents the chemical\r\nenergy stored up in the combustible, for combustion is in fact the\r\nchemical union of one substance with another with the development of heat\r\nand light. When carbon burns in air, therefore, a chemical combination\r\ntakes place, the air supplying the other substance with which the carbon\r\ncombines. That other substance is also an element--it is the invisible gas\r\nwhich chemists call oxygen, and which forms one-fifth of the bulk of\r\natmospheric air, the remainder consisting of the gas nitrogen and small\r\nquantities of other gases with which we shall have more to do\r\nsubsequently. When oxygen and carbon unite under the conditions described,\r\nthe product is an invisible gas known as carbon dioxide, and it is because\r\nthis gas is invisible that the carbon seems to disappear altogether on\r\ncombustion. In reality, however, the carbon is not lost, for matter is as\r\nindestructible as energy, but it is converted into the dioxide which\r\nescapes as gas under ordinary circumstances. If, however, we burn a given\r\nweight of carbon with free access of air, and collect the product of\r\ncombustion and weigh it, we shall find that the product weighs more than\r\nthe carbon, by an amount which represents the weight of oxygen with which\r\nthe element has combined. By careful experiment it would be found that\r\none part by weight of carbon would give three and two-third parts by\r\nweight of carbon dioxide. If, moreover, we could measure the quantity of\r\nheat given out by the complete combustion of one pound of carbon, it would\r\nbe found that this quantity would raise 14,544 lbs. of water through 1 deg.\r\nF., a quantity of heat corresponding to over eleven million foot-pounds of\r\nwork, or about seven and three-quarters horse-power per hour.\r\n\r\nHere then is the chief source of the energy of coal--the carbon of the\r\nplants which lived on this earth long ages ago has lain buried in the\r\nearth, and when we ignite a coal fire this carbon combines with\r\natmospheric oxygen, and restores some of the energy that was stored up at\r\nthat remote period. But the whole of the energy dormant in coal is not due\r\nto the carbon, for this fuel contains another combustible element,\r\nhydrogen, which is also a gas when in the free state, and which is one of\r\nthe constituents of water, the other constituent being oxygen. In fact,\r\nthere is more latent energy in hydrogen, weight for weight, than there is\r\nin carbon, for one pound of hydrogen on complete combustion would give\r\nenough heat to raise 62,032 lbs. of water through 1 deg. F. Hydrogen in\r\nburning combines with oxygen to form water, so that the products of the\r\ncomplete combustion of coal are carbon dioxide and water. The amount of\r\nheat contributed by the hydrogen of coal is, however, comparatively\r\ninsignificant, because there is only a small percentage of this element\r\npresent, and we thus come to the conclusion that nearly all the work that\r\nis done by our steam-engines of the present time is drawn from the latent\r\nenergy of the carbon of the fossilized vegetation of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to which we have now been led leaves us with the question\r\nas to the _origin_ of the energy of coal still unanswered. We shall have\r\nto go a step further before this part of our story is complete, and we\r\nmust form some kind of idea of the way in which a plant grows. Carbon\r\nbeing the chief source of energy in coal, we may for the present confine\r\nourselves to this element, of which woody fibre contains about 50 per\r\ncent. Consider the enormous gain in weight during the growth of a plant;\r\ncompare the acorn, weighing a few grains, with the oak, weighing many\r\ntons, which arises from it after centuries of growth. If matter is\r\nindestructible, and never comes into existence spontaneously, where does\r\nall this carbon come from? It is a matter of common knowledge that the\r\ncarbon of plants is supplied by the atmosphere in the form of carbon\r\ndioxide--the gas which has already been referred to as resulting from the\r\ncombustion of carbon. This gas exists in the atmosphere in small\r\nquantity--about four volumes in 10,000 volumes of air; but insignificant\r\nas this may appear, it is all important for the life of plants, since it\r\nis from this source that they derive their carbon. The origin of the\r\ncarbon dioxide, which is present as a normal constituent of the\r\natmosphere, does not directly concern us at present, but it is important\r\nto bear in mind that this gas is one of the products of the respiration of\r\nanimals, so that the animal kingdom is one of the sources of plant carbon.\r\n\r\nThe transition from carbon dioxide to woody fibre is brought about in the\r\nplant by a series of chemical processes, and through the formation of a\r\nnumber of intermediate products in a manner which is not yet thoroughly\r\nunderstood; but since carbon dioxide consists of carbon and oxygen, and\r\nsince plants feed upon carbon dioxide, appropriating the carbon and giving\r\noff the oxygen as a waste product, it is certain that work of some kind\r\nmust be performed. This is evident, because it has been explained that\r\nwhen carbon combines with oxygen a great deal of heat is given out, and as\r\nthis heat is the equivalent of the energy stored in the carbon, it follows\r\nfrom the doctrine of the Conservation of Energy, that in order to separate\r\nthe carbon from the oxygen again, just the same amount of energy must be\r\nsupplied as is evolved during the combustion of the carbon. If a pound of\r\ncarbon in burning to carbon dioxide gives out heat equivalent to eleven\r\nmillion foot-pounds of work, we must apply the same amount of work to the\r\ncarbon dioxide produced to separate it into its constituents. Neither a\r\nplant nor any living thing can create energy any more than it can create\r\nmatter, and just as the matter composing a living organism is assimilated\r\nfrom external sources, so must we look to an external source for the\r\nenergy which enables the plant to do this large amount of chemical work.\r\n\r\nThe separation of carbon from oxygen in the plant is effected by means of\r\nenergy supplied by the sun. The great white hot globe which is the centre\r\nof our system, and round which this earth and the planets are moving, is a\r\nreservoir from which there is constantly pouring forth into space a\r\nprodigious quantity of energy. It must be remembered that the sun is more\r\nthan a million times greater in bulk than our earth. It has been\r\ncalculated by Sir William Thomson that every square foot of the sun's\r\nsurface is radiating energy equivalent to 7000 horse-power in work. On a\r\nclear summer day the earth receives from the sun in our latitude energy\r\nequal to about 1450 horse-power per acre. To keep up this supply by the\r\ncombustion of coal, we should have to burn for every square foot of the\r\nsun's surface between three and four pounds per second. A small fraction\r\nof this solar energy reaches our earth in the form of radiant heat and\r\nlight, and it is the latter which enables the plant to perform the work of\r\nseparating the carbon from the oxygen with which it is chemically\r\ncombined. It is, in fact, well known that the growth of plants--that is,\r\nthe assimilation of carbon and the liberation of oxygen--only takes place\r\nunder the influence of light. This function is performed by the leaves\r\nwhich contain the green colouring-matter known as chlorophyll, the\r\npresence of which is essential to the course of the chemical changes.\r\n\r\nIf we now sum up the results to which we have been led, it will be seen--\r\n\r\n(1) That the chief source of the energy contained in coal is the carbon.\r\n\r\n(2) That this carbon formed part of the plants which grew during the\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\n(3) That the carbon thus accumulated was supplied to the plants by the\r\ncarbon dioxide existing in the atmosphere at that time.\r\n\r\n(4) That the separation of the carbon from the oxygen was effected in the\r\npresence of chlorophyll, by means of the solar energy transmitted to the\r\nearth during the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nWe thus arrive at the interesting conclusion, that the heat which we get\r\nfrom coal is sunlight in another form. For every pound of coal that we now\r\nburn, and for every unit of heat or work that we get from it, an\r\nequivalent quantity of sunlight was converted into the latent energy of\r\nchemical separation during the time that the coal plant grew. This energy\r\nhas remained stored up in the earth ever since, and reappears in the form\r\nof heat when we cause the coal to undergo combustion. It is related that\r\nGeorge Stephenson when asked what force drove his locomotive, replied that\r\nit was \"bottled-up sunshine,\" and we now see that he was much nearer the\r\ntruth in making this answer than he could have been aware of at the time.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the consideration of the different products which we\r\nget from coal, it will be desirable to discuss a little more fully the\r\nnature of the change which occurs during the transformation of wood into\r\ncoal. Pure woody fibre consists of a substance known to chemists as\r\ncellulose, which contains fifty per cent. of carbon, the remainder of the\r\ncompound being made up of hydrogen and oxygen. It is thus obvious that\r\nduring the fossilization of the wood some of the other constituents are\r\nlost, and the percentage of carbon by this means raised. We can trace this\r\nchange from wood, through peat, lignite, and the different varieties of\r\ncoal up to graphite, which is nearly pure carbon. It is in fact possible\r\nto construct a series showing the conversion of wood into coal, this\r\nseries comprising the varieties given in the table on p. 23, as well as\r\nyounger and older vegetable deposits. The series will be--\r\n\r\n    I. Woody fibre (cellulose).\r\n   II. Peat from Dartmoor.\r\n  III. Lignite, or brown coal, an imperfectly carbonized vegetable\r\n       deposit of more recent geological age than true coal.\r\n   IV. Average bituminous coal.\r\n    V. Cannel coal from Wigan.\r\n   VI. Anthracite from Wales.\r\n  VII. Graphite, the oldest carbonaceous mineral.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of the chief elements in the members of this series is--\r\n\r\n         Carbon. Hydrogen. Oxygen.\r\n\r\n    I.      50.0    6.0      44.0\r\n   II.      54.0    5.2      28.2\r\n  III.      66.3    5.6      22.8\r\n   IV.      77.0    5.0      11.2\r\n    V.      81.2    5.6       7.9\r\n   VI.      90.1    3.2       2.5\r\n  VII.   94-99.5, the remainder being ash.\r\n\r\nIn the above table the increase of carbon and the decrease of oxygen is\r\nwell brought out; the hydrogen also on the whole decreases, although with\r\nsome irregularity. The exact course of the chemical change which occurs\r\nduring the passage of wood into coal is at present involved in obscurity.\r\nThe oxygen may be eliminated in the form of water or of carbon dioxide or\r\nboth; some of the carbon is got rid of in the form of marsh gas, a\r\ncompound of carbon and hydrogen, which forms the chief constituent of the\r\ndangerous \"fire-damp\" of coal mines.\r\n\r\nMarsh gas is an inflammable gas which becomes explosive when mixed with\r\nair and ignited; it often escapes with great violence during the working\r\nof coal seams, the jets blowing out from the coal or underclay with a\r\nrushing noise, indicative of the high pressure under which the hydrocarbon\r\ngas has accumulated. These jets of escaping gas are known amongst miners\r\nas \"blowers.\" If the air of a mine contains a sufficient quantity of the\r\ngas, and a flame accidentally fires the mixture, there results one of\r\nthose disastrous explosions with which the history of coal mining has\r\nunfortunately only made us too familiar.\r\n\r\nFrom the account of coal which has thus far been rendered, it will be seen\r\nthat as a source of mechanical power, we are far from using it as\r\neconomically as could be desired; and when we look at our open grates with\r\nclouds of unburnt carbon particles escaping up the chimney, and so\r\nconstructed that only a small fraction of the total heat warms our rooms,\r\nit will be seen that the tale of waste is still more deplorable. But we\r\nare at present rather concerned with what we actually do get from coal\r\nthan with what we ought to get from it, and here, when we come to deal\r\nwith the various material products, we shall have a better account to\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf instead of heating coal in contact with air and allowing it to burn, we\r\nheat it in a closed vessel, such as a retort, it undergoes decomposition\r\nwith the formation of various gaseous, liquid, and solid products. This\r\nprocess of heating an organic compound in a closed vessel without access\r\nof air and collecting the products, is called destructive distillation.\r\nThe tobacco-pipe experiment of our boyhood is our first practical\r\nintroduction to the destructive distillation of coal. We put some powdered\r\ncoal into the bowl of the pipe, plaster up the opening with clay and then\r\ninsert the bowl in a fire, allowing the stem to project from between the\r\nbars of the grate. In a few minutes a stream of gas issues from the\r\norifice of the stem; on applying a light it burns with a luminous flame,\r\nand we have made coal-gas on a small scale.\r\n\r\nIn the destructive distillation of organic substances, such as wood or\r\ncoal, there are always produced four things--gas, watery liquid, and\r\nviscous products known as tar, while a residue of coke or charcoal is left\r\nin the retort. This is a very old observation, and was made so long ago\r\nthat it becomes interesting as a point in the history of applied science\r\nto know who first submitted coal to destructive distillation. According to\r\nDr. Gustav Schultz, we must credit a German with this observation, which\r\nwas made towards the end of the seventeenth century (about 1680) by a\r\nchemist named Johann Joachim Becher. The experiment is described in such a\r\nquaint manner that the exact words of the author are worthy of being\r\nreproduced, and the passage is here given as translated by Dr. Lunge in\r\nhis work on _Coal Tar and Ammonia_--\r\n\r\n\"In Holland they have peat, and in England pit-coals; neither of them is\r\nvery good for burning, be it in rooms or for smelting. But I have found a\r\nway, not merely to burn both kinds into good coal (coke) which not any\r\nmore smokes nor stinks, but with their flame to smelt equally well as with\r\nwood, so that a foot of such coal makes flames 10 feet long. That I have\r\ndemonstrated with pit-coal at the Hague, and here in England at Mr.\r\nBoyles', also at Windsor on the large scale. In this connection it is also\r\nnoteworthy that, equally as the Swedes make their tar from firwood, I have\r\nhere in England made from pit-coal a sort of tar which is equal to the\r\nSwedish in every way, and for some operations is even superior to it. I\r\nhave made proof of it on wood and on ropes, and the proof has been found\r\nright, so that even the king has seen a specimen of it, which is a great\r\nthing in England, and the coal from which the tar has been taken out is\r\nbetter for use than before.\"\r\n\r\nThis enterprising chemist, moreover, brought his results to a practical\r\nissue, for he secured a patent, in conjunction with Henry Serle, in 1681,\r\nfor \"a new way of making pitch and tarre out of pit-coale, never before\r\nfound out or used by any other.\"\r\n\r\nNo less interesting is the work of our own clergy during the last century,\r\nwhen many eminent divines appear to have devoted their leisure to\r\nexperimental science. Thus, about the year 1688 the Rev. John Clayton,\r\nD.D., Dean of Kildare, went to examine a ditch two miles from Wigan in\r\nLancashire, the water in which had been stated to \"burn like brandy\" when\r\na flame was applied to it. The Dean ultimately traced the phenomenon to an\r\nescape of inflammable gas from an underlying coal seam, and he followed up\r\nthe matter experimentally by studying the destructive distillation of\r\nWigan coal in retorts. The results were communicated to the Hon. Robert\r\nBoyle, but were not published till after the death of the latter, and long\r\nafter the death of the author. The following account is taken from the\r\nabridged edition of the _Philosophical Transactions_ (1739):--\r\n\r\n\"At first there came over only phlegm, afterwards a black oil, and then\r\nalso a spirit arose, which he could noways condense, but it forced the\r\nluting, or broke the glasses. Once, when it had forced the lute, coming\r\nclose to it to try to repair it, he observed that the spirit which issued\r\nout caught fire at the flame of the candle, and continued burning with\r\nviolence as it issued out in a stream, which he blew out and lighted again\r\nalternately for several times. He then tried to save some of this spirit.\r\nTaking a turbinated receiver, and putting a candle to the pipe of the\r\nreceiver while the spirit rose, he observed that it caught flame, and\r\ncontinued burning at the end of the pipe, though you could not discern\r\nwhat fed the flame. He then blew it out, and lighted it again several\r\ntimes; after which he fixed a bladder, flatted and void of air, to the\r\npipe of the receiver. The oil and phlegm descended into the receiver, but\r\nthe spirit, still ascending, blew up the bladder. He then filled a good\r\nmany bladders with it, and might have filled an inconceivable number more;\r\nfor the spirit continued to rise for several hours, and filled the\r\nbladders almost as fast as a man could have blown them with his mouth; and\r\nyet the quantity of coals he distilled was inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\"He kept this spirit in the bladders a considerable time, and endeavoured\r\nseveral ways to condense it, but in vain. And when he wished to amuse his\r\nfriends, he would take one of the bladders, and pricking a hole with a\r\npin, and compressing gently the bladder near the flame of a candle till it\r\nonce took fire, it would then continue flaming till all the spirit was\r\ncompressed out of the bladder.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Stephen Hales, D.D., Rector of Farringdon, Hants, was the author\r\nof a book entitled _Statical Essays, containing Vegetable Staticks_,\r\nprinted in 1726-27, and of which the third edition bears the date 1738. At\r\np. 182 of this work, after a previous description of the destructive\r\ndistillation of all kinds of substances in iron or other retorts, he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n\"By the same means also I found plenty of air [gas] might be obtained from\r\nminerals. Half a cubick inch, or 158 grains of Newcastle coal, yielded in\r\ndistillation 180 cubick inches of air [gas], which arose very fast from\r\nthe coal, especially while the yellowish fumes ascended.\"\r\n\r\nStill later, viz. about 1767, we have the Rev. R. Watson, D.D., Regius\r\nProfessor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge, and Bishop of\r\nLlandaff, interesting himself in chemistry. He wrote a series of\r\n_Chemical Essays_, one of which is entitled, _Of Pit Coal_, and in this he\r\ndescribes the production from coal (by destructive distillation) of\r\nilluminating gas, ammonia-water, tar, and coke. He further compares the\r\nrelative quantities of the different products from various kinds of coal,\r\nbut he appears to have been chiefly interested in the tar, and disregarded\r\nthe gas and other products. Not the least interesting part of his book is\r\nthe preface, in which he apologizes for his pursuits in the following\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n\"Divines, I hope, will forgive me if I have stolen a few hours, not, I\r\ntrust, from the duties of my office, but certainly from the studies of my\r\nprofession, and employed them in the cultivation of natural philosophy. I\r\ncould plead in my defence, the example of some of the greatest characters\r\nthat ever adorned either this University or the Church of England.\"\r\n\r\nThis is quoted from the 5th edition, dated 1789, the essay on coal being\r\nin the second of five volumes. As the learned bishop published other works\r\non chemistry, we may suppose that the forgiveness which he asks from his\r\nbrother divines was duly accorded.\r\n\r\nNone of these preliminary experiments, however, led to any immediate\r\npractical result so far as concerns the use of coal-gas as an illuminating\r\nagent. Towards the end of the last century the lighting of individual\r\nestablishments commenced, and the way was thus prepared for the\r\nmanufacture of the gas on a large scale. One of the earliest pioneers was\r\nthe ninth Earl of Dundonald, an inventive genius, who in 1782 at Culross\r\nAbbey became one of the first practical tar distillers. He secured letters\r\npatent in 1781 for making tar, pitch, essential oils, volatile alkali,\r\nmineral acids, salts, and cinders from coal. The gas was only a waste\r\nproduct, and, strange as it may appear, the Earl, whose operations were\r\nfinancial failures, did not realize the importance of the gas, the tar and\r\ncoke being considered the only products of value. Here is the account of\r\nthe experiments by his son, Admiral Dundonald, the Sailor Earl, quoted\r\nfrom his _Autobiography of a Seaman_:--\r\n\r\n\"In prosecution of his coal-tar patent, my father went to reside at the\r\nfamily estate of Culross Abbey, the better to superintend the works on his\r\nown collieries, as well as others on the adjoining estates of Valleyfield\r\nand Kincardine. In addition to these works, an experimental tar-kiln was\r\nerected near the Abbey, and here coal-gas became accidentally employed in\r\nillumination. Having noticed the inflammable nature of a vapour arising\r\nduring the distillation of tar, the Earl, by way of experiment, fitted a\r\ngun-barrel to the eduction pipe leading from the condenser. On applying\r\nfire to the muzzle, a vivid light blazed forth across the waters of the\r\nFrith, becoming, as was afterwards ascertained, distinctly visible on the\r\nopposite shore.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later the foundation of the coal-gas manufacture was laid by\r\nWilliam Murdoch, a Scotchman, who must be credited with the practical\r\nintroduction of this illuminating agent. The idea had about the same time\r\noccurred to a Frenchman, Lebon, but in his hands the suggestion did not\r\ntake a practical form. Murdoch was overseer of some mines in Cornwall, and\r\nin 1792 he first lighted his own house at Redruth. He then transferred his\r\nservices to the great engineering firm of Boulton and Watt at Soho, near\r\nBirmingham, where he erected apparatus in 1798, and in the course of a few\r\nyears the whole of this factory was permanently lighted by gas. From this\r\ntime the introduction of gas into other factories at Manchester and\r\nHalifax was effected by Murdoch and his pupil, Samuel Clegg. From single\r\nfactories coal-gas at length came into use as a street illuminant,\r\nalthough somewhat tardily. Experiments were made in London at the Lyceum\r\nTheatre in 1803, in Golden Lane in 1807, and in Pall Mall two years later.\r\n\r\nIt was fifteen years from the time of Murdoch's first installation at Soho\r\nbefore the streets of London were lighted by gas on a commercial scale.\r\nOur grandfathers seem to have had a great dread of gas, and public\r\nopposition no doubt had much to do with its exclusion from the metropolis.\r\nThere were even at that time eminent literary and scientific men who did\r\nnot hesitate to cast ridicule upon the proposal, and to declare the scheme\r\nto be only visionary. But about 1806 there came into this country an\r\nenergetic German who passed by the name of Winsor, and who is described as\r\nan ignorant adventurer, whose real name was Winzler. Whatever his origin,\r\nhe certainly helped to rouse the public interest in gas lighting. He took\r\nout a patent, he gave public lectures, and collected large sums of money\r\nfor the establishment of gas companies. Most of the capital was, however,\r\nsquandered in futile experiments, but at length in 1813, Westminster\r\nBridge, and a year later St. Margaret's parish, was successfully lighted.\r\nFrom that period the use of gas extended, but it was some time before the\r\npublic fears were allayed, for it is related that Samuel Clegg, who\r\nundertook the lighting of London Bridge, had at first to light his own\r\nlamps, as nobody could be found to undertake this perilous office. Even\r\nafter gas had come into general use as a street illuminant, it must have\r\nfound its way but slowly into private houses. In an old play-bill of the\r\nHaymarket Theatre, dated 1843--thirty years after the first introduction\r\ninto the streets--it is announced--\r\n\r\n\"Among the most important Improvements, is the introduction (for the first\r\ntime) of Gas as the Medium of Light!\"\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of coal-gas, first rendered practicable by the energy and\r\nskill of the Scotch engineer Murdoch, is now carried on all over the\r\ncountry on a colossal scale. It is not the province of the present volume\r\nto deal with the details of manufacture, but a short description of the\r\nprocess is necessary for the proper understanding of the subsequent\r\nportions of the subject (see Fig. 3). The coal is heated in clay\r\ncylinders, called retorts, provided with upright exit pipes through which\r\nthe volatile products escape, and are conducted into water contained in a\r\nhorizontal pipe termed the \"hydraulic main.\" In the latter the gas is\r\npartially cooled, and deposits most of the tar and watery liquor which\r\ndistil over at the high temperature to which the retorts are heated. The\r\ntar and watery liquor are allowed to flow from the hydraulic main into a\r\npit called the \"tar well,\" and the gas then passes through a series of\r\ncurved pipes exposed to the air, in which it is further cooled, and\r\ndeposits more of the tar. From this \"atmospheric condenser\" the gas passes\r\ninto a series of vessels filled with coke, down which a fine spray of\r\nwater is constantly being blown. These vessels, known as \"scrubbers,\"\r\nserve to remove the last traces of tar, and some of the volatile sulphur\r\ncompounds which are formed from the small quantity of sulphur present in\r\nmost coals. The removal of sulphur compounds is a matter of importance,\r\nbecause when gas is burnt these compounds give rise to acid vapours, which\r\nare deleterious to health and destructive to property.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Sectional diagram of gas plant. The retorts and\r\nfurnace are on the right; the gas rises through the upright pipe T into\r\nthe hydraulic main B; from there it passes into the atmospheric condensers\r\nD, from the lower cistern of which the condensed tar flows into the\r\ntar-well, H. Passing up through K, the gas is conducted into the scrubber,\r\nO, and from there into the purifier, M. From there it emerges through K'\r\ninto the purifier, M, and then into the gas-holder for distribution. (From\r\nSchultz's _Chemie des Steinkohlentheers_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the scrubbers the gas is sent through another series of vessels\r\npacked with trays of lime or oxide of iron, in order to remove\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and other sulphur compounds as completely as\r\npossible. A small quantity of carbon dioxide is also removed by these\r\n\"purifiers,\" as the presence of this gas impairs the illuminating power of\r\ncoal-gas. From the purifiers the gas passes into the gas-holders, where it\r\nis stored for distribution. It remains only to be stated that the\r\ndistillation of coal is effected under a pressure somewhat less than that\r\nof the atmosphere, the products of distillation being pumped out of the\r\nretorts by means of a kind of air-pump, called an exhauster, which is\r\ninterpolated between the hydraulic main and the condenser, or at some\r\nother part of the purifying system. The coke left in the retort is used as\r\nfuel for burning under the retorts or for other purposes. The oxide of\r\niron used in the purifiers can be used over and over again for a certain\r\nnumber of times by exposing it to the air, and when it is finally\r\nexhausted, the sulphur can be burnt out of it and used for making that\r\nmost important of all chemical products, sulphuric acid. Thus the small\r\nquantity of sulphur present in the original coal (probably in the form of\r\niron pyrites) is rendered available for the manufacture of a useful\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe necessarily brief description of this important industry will suffice\r\nfor the general reader. Those who desire further information on points of\r\ndetail will refer to special works. We are here rather concerned with the\r\nsubsequent fate of the different products, four of which have to be dealt\r\nwith, viz. the gas, watery liquor, tar, and coke. The first and last of\r\nthese having already been accounted for--the one as an illuminating agent\r\nand the other as fuel--may now be dismissed.\r\n\r\nNo story of applied science is complete unless we can form some idea of\r\nthe quantities of material used, and the amount of the products obtained.\r\nFrom one ton of Newcastle coal we get about 10,000 cubic feet of gas, 110\r\nto 120 lbs. of tar, 20 to 25 gallons of watery liquor, and about 1500 lbs.\r\nof coke. Different coals of course give different quantities, and the\r\nlatter vary also according to the heat of distillation; but the above\r\nestimate will furnish a good basis for forming our ideas with some\r\napproach to precision. It has been estimated also that we are now\r\ndistilling coal at the rate of about ten million tons per annum, so that\r\nthere is annually produced 100,000 million cubic feet of gas, and about\r\n500,000 tons of tar, besides proportionate quantities of the other\r\nproducts. The great metropolitan companies alone are consuming nearly\r\nthree million tons annually for the production of gas, a consumption\r\ncorresponding to about 6000 cubic feet per head of the population. This of\r\ncourse takes no account of the coal used for other manufactures or for\r\ndomestic purposes, but it is interesting to compare these estimates with\r\nthe consumption of coal in London about a century ago, before the\r\nintroduction of gas, when, as Bishop Watson tells us in his work already\r\nreferred to, the annual consumption was 922,394 tons.\r\n\r\nThe enormous quantity of tar resulting from our gas manufacture furnishes\r\nthe raw material for the production of a multitude of valuable\r\nsubstances--colouring-matters, medicines, perfumes, flavouring-matters,\r\nburning and lubricating oils, &c. Out of this unsavoury waste material of\r\nthe gas-works, the researches of chemists have enabled a great industry to\r\nspring up which is of continually growing importance. It will be the\r\nobject of the remaining portion of the present volume to set forth the\r\nachievements of science in this branch of its application. The foundation\r\nof the coal-tar industry was laid in this country--the country where coal\r\nwas first distilled on a large scale for the production of gas, and where\r\nthe first of the coal-tar colouring-matters was sent forth into commerce.\r\nWe are at the present time the largest tar producers in Europe; it has\r\nbeen stated that we produce more than double the whole quantity of tar\r\nmade in the gas-using countries of Europe; but in spite of this, our\r\nmanufacture of finished products is by no means in that flourishing\r\ncondition which might be expected from our natural resources in the way of\r\ncoal, and the facilities which we possess for manufacturing the raw\r\nmaterials out of it.\r\n\r\nBut we must now take a glance at some of the other uses to which coal is\r\nput in order to realize more completely the truth of the statement made\r\nsome pages back, viz. that this mineral has been the chief source of our\r\nindustrial prosperity. Great as is the consumption of coal by the gas\r\nmanufacturer, there is an equal or even a greater demand for the\r\ncarbonaceous residue left when the coal has been decomposed by destructive\r\ndistillation or by partial combustion. This residue is coke--the substance\r\nleft in the retorts after the gas manufacture. There is a great demand for\r\ncoke for many purposes; it is used in most cases where a cheap smokeless\r\nfuel is required; it is burnt in the furnaces of locomotives and other\r\nengines, and is very largely consumed by the iron smelter in the blast\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nTo meet these demands a large quantity of coal is converted into coke by\r\nbeing burnt in ovens with an insufficient supply of air for complete\r\ncombustion, or in suitably constructed close furnaces. The tar and other\r\nproducts have in this country until recently been allowed to escape as\r\nwaste, but the time is approaching when these must be utilized. It will\r\ngive an idea of the industrial importance of coke when it is stated, that\r\nabout twelve million tons of our coal annually undergo conversion into\r\nthis form of fuel. Chemically considered, coke consists of carbon together\r\nwith all the mineral constituents of the coal, and small quantities of\r\nhydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The amount of carbon varies from 85 to 97,\r\nand the ash from 3 to 14 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of coal into coke is a very venerable branch of\r\nmanufacture, which was first carried out on a large scale in this country\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century. As an operation it may appear\r\nutterly devoid of romance, but as Goethe has described his visit to the\r\nearliest of coke-burners, this fragment of history is worth narrating.\r\nWhen the great German philosophical poet was a student at Strassburg\r\n(1771), he rode over with some friends to visit the neighbourhood of\r\nSaarbruecken where he met an old \"coal philosopher\" named Stauf, who was\r\nthere carrying on the industry. This \"philosophus per ignem\" was manager\r\nof some alum works, and the ruling spirit of the \"burning hill\" of\r\nDuttweiler. The hill no doubt owed its designation to the coke ovens at\r\nwork upon it, and which had been in operation there for some six or seven\r\nyears before Goethe's visit, _i.e._ since 1764. The coke was wanted for\r\niron smelting, and even at that early period Stauf had the wisdom to\r\ncondense his volatile products, for we are told that he showed his\r\nvisitors bitumen, burning-oil, lampblack, and even a cake of sal ammoniac\r\nresulting from his operations. Goethe has put upon record his visit to the\r\nlittle haggard old coke-burner, living in his lonely cottage in the forest\r\n(_Aus meinem Leben: Wahrheit und Dichtung_, Book X). It is probably\r\nStauf's ovens which are described by the French metallurgist, De Gensanne,\r\nin his _Traite de la fonte des Mines par le feu du Charbon de Terre_,\r\npublished in Paris in 1770. After long years of coke-making, without any\r\nregard to the value of the volatile products, we are now beginning to\r\nconsider the advisability of doing that which has long been done on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that Bishop Watson in the last century had heard of\r\nthe attempt to recover the products from coke ovens, for he gives the\r\nfollowing very sound advice in his _Chemical Essays_:--\r\n\r\n\"Those who are interested in the preparation of coak would do well to\r\nremember that every 96 ounces of coal would furnish four ounces at the\r\nleast of oil, probably six ounces might be obtained; but if we put the\r\nproduct so low as five ounces from 100, and suppose a coak oven to work\r\noff only 100 tons of coal in a year, there would be a saving of five tons\r\nof oil, which would yield above four tons of tar; the requisite alteration\r\nin the structure of the coak ovens, so as to make them a kind of\r\ndistilling vessels, might be made at a very trifling expense.\"--5th ed.,\r\n1789, vol. ii. p. 351.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to chronicle another chapter in the history of coal philosophy\r\nbefore finishing with this part of the subject. There is a branch of\r\nmanufacture carried on, especially in Scotland, which results in the\r\nproduction of burning and lubricating oils, and solid paraffin, a wax-like\r\nsubstance which is used for candle-making. The manufacture of candles out\r\nof coal will perhaps be a new revelation to many readers of this book. It\r\nmust be admitted, however, that the term \"coal\" is here being extended to\r\nonly partially fossilized vegetation of younger geological age than true\r\ncoal, and to bituminous shales of various ages. Shale, geologically\r\nconsidered, is hardened mud; it may be looked upon as clay altered by time\r\nand pressure. Now if the mud, at the period of its deposition, was much\r\nmixed up with vegetable matter, we should have in course of time a mixture\r\nof more or less carbonized woody fibre with mineral matter, and this would\r\nbe called a carbonaceous or bituminous shale. Shales of this kind often\r\ncontain as much as 80 to 90 per cent. of mineral matter, and seldom more\r\nthan 20 per cent. of volatile matter, _i.e._ the portion lost on ignition,\r\nand consisting chiefly of the carbonaceous constituents.\r\n\r\nThe story of the shale-oil industry is soon told. About the year 1847 oil\r\nwas \"struck\" in a coal mine at Alfreton in Derbyshire, and in the hands of\r\nMr. James Young this supply furnished the market with burning-oil for\r\nnearly three years. Then the spring became exhausted, and Mr. Young and\r\nhis associates had to look out for another source of oil. Be it remembered\r\nthat this happened some nine years before the utilization of the great\r\nAmerican petroleum deposits. Many kinds of vegetable matter were submitted\r\nto destructive distillation before a substance was found which could be\r\nprofitably worked, but at length Mr. Young tried a kind of cannel coal\r\nwhich had about that time been introduced for gas making. This substance\r\nwas called Boghead gas coal or Torbane Hill mineral, from the place where\r\nit occurred, which is at Bathgate in Linlithgow. This mineral was found to\r\nyield a large amount of paraffin oil and solid paraffin on destructive\r\ndistillation, and from that time (1850) to this, the industry has been\r\ncarried on at Bathgate and other parts of Scotland, where similar\r\ncarbonaceous deposits occur.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a matter of unimportance at the present time whether this\r\nTorbane Hill mineral is a true coal or not. About forty years ago,\r\nhowever, the decision of this question involved a costly law-suit in\r\nEdinburgh. The proprietor of the estate had granted a lease to a firm,\r\nconveying to the latter the right to work coal, limestone, ironstone, and\r\ncertain other minerals found thereon, but excluding copper and all other\r\nminerals not mentioned in the contract. The lessees then found that this\r\nparticular carbonaceous mineral was of very great value, both on account\r\nof the high quality of the gas, and afterwards on account of the paraffin\r\nwhich it furnished by Young's process of distillation. Thereupon the\r\nlessor brought an action against the lessees, claiming L10,000 damages, on\r\nthe ground that the latter had broken the contract by removing a mineral\r\nwhich was not coal. Experts gave evidence on both sides; some declared in\r\nfavour of the substance being coal, others said it was a bituminous shale,\r\nwhile others called it bituminated clay, or refused to give it a name at\r\nall. Judgment was finally given for the defendants, so that in the eye of\r\nthe law the mineral was considered a true coal. As a matter of fact, it is\r\nimpossible to draw a hard and fast line between coal and bituminous shale,\r\nas the one is connected with the other by a series of intermediate\r\nminerals, and the Torbane Hill mineral happens to form one of the links.\r\nIt contains about 69 per cent. of volatile matter, and leaves 31 per cent.\r\nof residue, consisting of 12 parts of carbon and 19 of ash.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture started by Young has developed into an important industry,\r\nin spite of the fact that the original Torbane Hill coal has become\r\nexhausted, and that enormous natural deposits of petroleum are worked in\r\nAmerica, Russia, and elsewhere. There are now some fifteen companies at\r\nwork in Scotland, representing an aggregate capital of about two and a\r\nhalf million pounds sterling. Bituminous shales of different kinds are\r\ndistilled at a low red heat in iron retorts, and from the volatile\r\nportions there are separated those valuable products which have already\r\nbeen alluded to, viz. burning and lubricating oils, solvent mineral oil,\r\nparaffin wax for candles, and ammonia. We may fairly claim these as coal\r\nproducts, although the shales used contain much mineral matter, the carbon\r\naveraging about 20 per cent., the hydrogen three per cent., the nitrogen\r\n0.7, and the ash about 67 per cent. The shales worked are approximately of\r\nthe same age as true coal, _i.e._ Carboniferous. The Scotch companies are\r\ndistilling about two million tons of shale per annum, this quantity\r\nproducing about sixty million gallons of crude oil, and giving employment\r\nto over 10,000 hands.\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of the present work to enter into the chemical\r\nnature of the products of destructive distillation in any greater detail\r\nthan is necessary to enable the general reader to know something of the\r\nrecent discoveries in the utilization of these products. We shall,\r\nhowever, have occasion later on to make ourselves acquainted with the\r\nnames of some of the more important raw materials which are derived from\r\nthis source, and certain preliminary explanations are indispensable. In\r\nthe first place then, let us start from the fact that coal--including\r\ncarbonaceous shale and lignite--when heated in a closed vessel gives gas,\r\ntar, coke, and a watery liquor. A clear understanding must be arrived at\r\nconcerning the manner in which these products arise.\r\n\r\nThere is a widely-spread notion that the substances derived from coal and\r\nutilized for industrial purposes are present in the mineral itself, and\r\nthat the art of the chemist has been exercised in separating the said\r\nsubstances by various processes. This idea must be at once dispelled. It\r\nis true that there is a small quantity of water and a certain amount of\r\ngas already present in most coals, but these are quite insignificant as\r\ncompared with the total yield of gas and watery liquor. So also with\r\nrespect to the tar; it is possible that in some highly bituminous minerals\r\nwe might dissolve out a small quantity of tarry matter by the use of\r\nappropriate solvents, but in the coals mostly used for gas-making not a\r\ntrace of tar exists ready formed, and still less can it be said that the\r\ncoal contains coke. All these products are formed _by the chemical\r\ndecomposition of the coal_ under the influence of heat, and their nature\r\nand quantity can be made to vary within certain limits by modifying the\r\ntemperature of distillation.\r\n\r\nHaving once realized this principle with respect to coal itself, it is\r\neasy to extend it to the products of its destructive distillation. The\r\ntar, for instance, is a complicated mixture of various substances, among\r\nwhich hydrocarbons--_i.e._ compounds of carbon with hydrogen--largely\r\npredominate. The different components of coal-tar can be separated by\r\nprocesses which we shall have to consider subsequently. Of the compounds\r\nthus isolated some few are immediately applicable for industrial purposes,\r\nbut the majority only form the raw materials for the manufacture of other\r\nproducts, such as colouring-matters and medicines. Now these\r\ncolouring-matters and other finished products no more exist in the tar\r\nthan the latter exists in the coal. They are produced from the\r\nhydrocarbons, &c., present in the tar _by chemical processes_, and bear\r\nmuch about the same relationship to their parent substances that a\r\nsteam-engine bears to the iron ore out of which its metallic parts are\r\nprimarily constructed. Just as the mechanical skill of the engineer\r\nenables him to construct an engine out of the raw material iron, which is\r\nextracted from its ore, and converted into steel by chemical processes, so\r\nthe skill of the chemist enables him to build up complex\r\ncolouring-matters, &c., out of the raw materials furnished by tar, which\r\nis obtained from coal by chemical decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe illuminating gas which is obtained from coal by destructive\r\ndistillation consists chiefly of hydrogen and gaseous hydrocarbons, the\r\nmost abundant of the latter being marsh gas. There are also present in\r\nsmaller quantities the two oxides of carbon, the monoxide and the dioxide,\r\nwhich are gaseous at ordinary temperatures, together with other\r\nimpurities. Coal-gas is burnt just as it is delivered from the mains--it\r\nis not at present utilized as a source of raw material in the sense that\r\nthe tar is thus made use of. In some cases gas is used as fuel, as in\r\ngas-stoves and gas-engines, and in the so-called \"gas-producers,\" in which\r\nthe coal, instead of being used as a direct source of heat, is partially\r\nburnt in suitable furnaces, and the combustible gas thus arising,\r\nconsisting chiefly of carbon monoxide, is conveyed to the place where it\r\nundergoes complete combustion, and is thus utilized as a source of heat.\r\n\r\nSumming up the uses of coal thus far considered, we see that this mineral\r\nis being consumed as fuel, for the production of coke, for the manufacture\r\nof gas, and in many other ways. Lavishly as Nature has provided us with\r\nthis source of power and wealth, the idea naturally suggests itself\r\nwhether we are not drawing too liberally upon our capital. The question of\r\ncoal supply crops up from time to time, and the public mind is\r\nperiodically agitated about the prospects of its continuance. How long we\r\nhave been draining our coal resources it is difficult to ascertain. There\r\nis some evidence that coal-mining was carried on during the Roman\r\noccupation. In the reign of Richard I. there is distinct evidence of coal\r\nhaving been dug in the diocese of Durham. The oldest charters take us back\r\nto the early part of the thirteenth century for Scotland, and to the year\r\n1239 for England, when King Henry III. granted a right of sale to the\r\ntownsmen of Newcastle. With respect to the metropolis, Bishop Watson, on\r\nthe authority of Anderson's _History of Commerce_, states that coal was\r\nintroduced as fuel at the beginning of the fourteenth century. In these\r\nearly days, when it was brought from the north by ships, it was known as\r\n\"sea-coal\":--\r\n\r\n     \"Go; and we'll have a posset for 't soon at night, in faith, at the\r\n     latter end of a sea-coal fire.\"--_Merry Wives of Windsor_, Act I.,\r\n     Sc. iv.\r\n\r\nThat the fuel was received at first with disfavour appears from the fact\r\nthat in the reign of Edward I. the nobility and gentry made a complaint to\r\nthe king objecting to its use, on the ground of its being a public\r\nnuisance. By the middle of the seventeenth century the use of coal was\r\nbecoming more general in London, chiefly owing to the scarcity of wood;\r\nand its effects upon the atmosphere of the town will be inferred from a\r\nproclamation issued in the reign of Elizabeth, prohibiting its use during\r\nthe sitting of Parliament, for fear of injuring the health of the knights\r\nof the shire. About 1649 the citizens again petitioned Parliament against\r\nthe use of this fuel on account of the stench; and about the beginning of\r\nthat century \"the nice dames of London would not come into any house or\r\nroome when sea-coales were burned, nor willingly eat of meat that was\r\neither sod or roasted with sea-coale fire\" (_Stow's Annals_).\r\n\r\nFor many centuries therefore we have been drawing upon our coal supplies,\r\nand using up the mineral at an increasing rate. According to a recent\r\nestimate by Professor Hull, from the beginning of the present century to\r\n1875 the output has been more than doubled for each successive quarter\r\ncentury. The actual amount of coal raised in the United Kingdom between\r\n1882 and the present time averages annually about 170 million tons,\r\ncorresponding in money value to about L45,000,000 per annum. In 1860 the\r\namount of coal raised in Great Britain was a little more than 80 million\r\ntons, and Professor Hull estimated that at that rate of consumption our\r\nsupplies of workable coal would hold out for a thousand years. Since then\r\nthe available stock has been diminished by some 3,650 million tons, and\r\neven this deduction, we are told on the same authority, has not materially\r\naffected our total supply. The possibility of a coal famine need,\r\ntherefore, cause no immediate anxiety; but we cannot \"eat our loaf and\r\nhave it too,\" and sooner or later the continuous drain upon our coal\r\nresources must make itself felt. The first effect will probably be an\r\nincrease in price owing to the greater depth at which the coal will have\r\nto be worked. The whole question of our coal supply has, however,\r\nrecently assumed a new aspect by the discovery (February 1890) of coal at\r\na depth of 1,160 feet at Dover. To quote the words of Mr. W. Whitaker--\"It\r\nmay be indeed that the coal supply of the future will be largely derived\r\nfrom the South-East of England, and some day it may happen, from the\r\nexhaustion of our northern coal-fields, that we in the south may be able\r\nsuccessfully to perform a task now proverbially unprofitable--_we may\r\ncarry coal to Newcastle_.\"\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of Great Britain and Ireland occupy, in round numbers, an\r\narea of 11,860 square miles, or about one-tenth of the whole area of the\r\nland surface of the country. Within this area, and down to a depth of\r\n4,000 feet, lie the main deposits of our available wealth. Some idea of\r\nthe amount of coal underlying this area will be gathered from the table[2]\r\non the next page.\r\n\r\nThis supply, amounting to over 90,000 million tons, refers to the exposed\r\ncoal-fields and to workable seams, _i.e._ those above one foot in\r\nthickness. But in addition to this, we have a large amount of coal at\r\nworkable depths under formations of later geological age than the\r\nCarboniferous, such as the Permian formation of northern and central\r\nEngland. Adding the estimated quantity of coal from this source to that\r\ncontained in the exposed coal-fields as given above, we arrive at the\r\ntotal available supply. This is estimated to be about 146,454 million\r\ntons. To this we may one day have to add the coal under the south-eastern\r\npart of England.\r\n\r\n                                         Amount of coal in millions of\r\n                                          tons to depths not exceeding\r\n  Coal Fields of--                                         4,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  South Wales                                                   32,456\r\n  Forest of Dean                                                   265\r\n  Bristol                                                        4,219\r\n  Warwickshire                                                     459\r\n  S.

The largest amount (33 per cent.) is used for\r\niron-smelting,[3] and about 15 per cent. is exported; the remainder is\r\nconsumed in factories, dwelling-houses, for locomotion, and in the smaller\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe enormous advancement which has taken place of late years in the\r\nindustrial applications of electricity has given rise to the belief that\r\ncoal-gas will in time become superseded as an illuminating agent, and that\r\nthe supply of tar may in consequence fall off. So far, however, the\r\nintroduction of electric-lighting has had no appreciable effect upon the\r\nconsumption of gas, and even when the time of general electric-lighting\r\narrives there will arise as a consequence an increased demand for gas as a\r\nfuel in gas engines. Moreover, the use of gas for heating and cooking\r\npurposes is likely to go on increasing. Nor must it be forgotten that the\r\nquantity of tar produced in gas-works is now greater than is actually\r\nrequired by the colour-manufacturer, and much of this by-product is burnt\r\nas fuel, so that if the manufacture of gas were to suffer to any\r\nconsiderable extent there would still be tar enough to meet our\r\nrequirements at the present rate of consumption of the tar-products. Then\r\nagain, the value of the tar, coke, and ammoniacal liquor is of such a\r\nproportion as compared with the cost of the raw material, coal, that there\r\nis a good margin for lowering the price of gas when the competition\r\nbetween the latter and electricity actually comes about. It will not then\r\nbe only a struggle between the two illuminants, but it will be a question\r\nof electricity _versus_ gas, _plus_ tar and ammonia.\r\n\r\nWhile the electrician is pushing forward with rapid strides, the chemist\r\nis also moving onwards, and every year witnesses the discovery of new tar\r\nproducts, or the utilization of constituents which were formerly of little\r\nor no value. Thus if the cost of generating and distributing electricity\r\nis being lowered, on the other hand the value of coal tar is likely to go\r\non advancing, and it would be rash to predict which will come out\r\ntriumphant in the end. But even if electricity were to gain the day it\r\nwould be worth while to distil coal at the pit's mouth for the sake of the\r\nby-products, and there is, moreover, the tar from the coke ovens to fall\r\nback upon--a source which even before the use of coal-gas the wise Bishop\r\nof Llandaff advised us not to neglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the products obtained by the destructive distillation of\r\ncoal varies according to the temperature of distillation, and the age or\r\ndegree of carbonization of the coal. The watery liquor obtained by the dry\r\ndistillation of wood is acid, and contains among other things acetic acid,\r\nwhich is sometimes prepared in this way, and from its origin is\r\noccasionally spoken of as \"wood vinegar.\" The older the wood, the more\r\ncomplete its degree of conversion into coal, and the smaller the quantity\r\nof oxygen it contains, the more alkaline does the watery liquid become.\r\nThus the gas-liquor is distinctly alkaline, and contains a considerable\r\nquantity of ammonia, besides other volatile bases. The uses of ammonia are\r\nmanifold, and nearly our whole supply of this valuable substance is now\r\nderived from gas-liquor. The presence of ammonia in this liquor is\r\naccounted for when it is known that this compound is a gas composed of\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen. It has already been explained that coal contains\r\nfrom one to two per cent. of nitrogen, and during the process of\r\ndistillation about one-fifth of this nitrogen is converted into ammonia,\r\nthe remainder being converted partly into other bases, while a small\r\nquantity remains in the coke.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, the \"volatile alkali\" of the old chemists, and its salts are of\r\nimportance in pharmacy, but the chief use of this compound is to supply\r\nnitrogen for the growth of plants. Plants must have nitrogen in some form\r\nor another, and as they cannot assimilate it _directly_ from the\r\natmosphere where it exists in the free state, some suitable nitrogen\r\ncompound must be supplied to the soil. It is possible that certain\r\nleguminous plants may derive their nitrogen from the atmosphere through\r\nthe intervention of micro-organisms, which appear capable of fixing free\r\nnitrogen and of supplying it to the plant upon whose roots they flourish.\r\nBut this is second-hand nitrogen so far as concerns the plant. It is true\r\nalso that the atmosphere contains small traces of ammonia and acid oxides\r\nof nitrogen, which are dissolved by rain and snow, and thus get washed\r\ndown into the soil. These are the natural sources of plant nitrogen. But\r\nin agricultural operations, where large crops have to be raised as rapidly\r\nas possible, some additional source of nitrogen must be supplied, and\r\nthis is the object of manuring the soil.\r\n\r\nA manure, chemically considered, is a mixture of substances capable of\r\nsupplying the necessary nitrogenous and mineral food for the nourishment\r\nof the growing plant. The ordinary farm or stable manure contains\r\ndecomposing nitrogenous organic matter, in which the nitrogen is given off\r\nas ammonia, and thus furnishes the soil with which it is mixed with the\r\nnecessary fertilizer. But the supply of this manure is limited, and we\r\nhave to fall back upon gas-liquor and native nitrates to meet the existing\r\nwants of the agriculturist. Important as is ammonia for the growth of\r\nvegetation, it is not in this form that the majority of plants take up\r\ntheir nitrogen. Soluble nitrates are, in most cases, more efficient\r\nfertilizers than the salts of ammonia, and the ammonia which is supplied\r\nto the soil is converted into nitrates therein before the plant can\r\nassimilate the nitrogen. The oxidation of ammonia into nitric acid takes\r\nplace by virtue of a process called \"nitrification,\" and there is very\r\ngood reason for believing that this transformation is the work of a\r\nmicro-organism present in the soil. The gas liquor thus supplies food to a\r\nminute organism which converts the ammonia into a form available for the\r\nhigher plants. Some branches of agriculture--such as the cultivation of\r\nthe beet for sugar manufacture--are so largely dependent upon an\r\nartificial source of nitrogen, that their very existence is bound up with\r\nthe supply of ammonia salts or other nitrogenous manures. The relationship\r\nbetween the manufacture of beet-sugar and the distillation of coal for the\r\nproduction of gas is thus closer than many readers will have imagined; for\r\nwhile the supply of native guano or nitrate is uncertain, and its freight\r\ncostly on account of the distance from which it has to be shipped, the\r\nsulphate of ammonia from gas-liquor is always at hand, and available for\r\nthe purposes of fertilization.\r\n\r\nThen again, there are other products of industrial value which are\r\nassociated with ammonia, such, for example, as ammonia-alum and caustic\r\nsoda. This last is one of the most important chemical compounds\r\nmanufactured on a large scale, and is consumed in enormous quantities for\r\nthe manufacture of paper and soap, and other purposes. Salts of this\r\nalkali are also essential for glass making. Of late years a method for the\r\nproduction of caustic soda has been introduced which depends upon the use\r\nof ammonia, and as this process is proving a formidable rival to the older\r\nmethod of alkali manufacture, it may be said that such indispensable\r\narticles as paper, soap, and glass are now to some extent dependent upon\r\ngas-liquor, and may in course of time become still more intimately\r\nconnected with the manufacture of coal-gas.\r\n\r\nBut quantitative statements must be given in order to bring home to\r\ngeneral readers the actual value of the small percentage of nitrogen\r\npresent in coal. Thus it has been estimated, that one ton of coal gives\r\nenough ammonia to furnish about 30 lbs. of the crude sulphate. The present\r\nvalue of this salt is roughly about L12 per ton. The ten million tons of\r\ncoal distilled annually for gas making would thus give 133,929 tons of\r\nsulphate, equal in money value to L1,607,148, supposing the whole of the\r\nammonia to be sold in this form. To this may be added the ammonia obtained\r\nduring the distillation of shale and the carbonization of coal for coke,\r\nthe former source furnishing about 22,000 tons, and the latter about 2500\r\ntons annually. Small as is the legacy of nitrogen bequeathed to us from\r\nthe Carboniferous period, we see that it sums up to a considerable annual\r\naddition to our industrial resources.\r\n\r\nThe three products resulting from the distillation of coal--viz. the gas,\r\nammoniacal-liquor, and coke--having now been made to furnish their tale,\r\nwe have next to deal with the tar. In the early days of gas manufacture\r\nthis black, viscid, unsavoury substance was in every sense a waste\r\nproduct. No use had been found for it, and it was burnt, or otherwise\r\ndisposed of. No demand for the tar existed which could enable the gas\r\nmanufacturers to get rid of their ever-increasing accumulation. Wood-tar\r\nhad previously been used as a cheap paint for wood and metal-work, and it\r\nwas but a natural suggestion that coal-tar should be applied to the same\r\npurposes. It was found that the quality of the tar was improved by getting\r\nrid of the more volatile portions by boiling it in open pans; but this\r\nwaste--to say nothing of the danger of fire--was checked by a suggestion\r\nmade by Accum in 1815, who showed that by boiling down the tar in a still\r\ninstead of in open pans the volatile portions could be condensed and\r\ncollected, thus furnishing an oil which could be used by the varnish maker\r\nas a substitute for turpentine. A few years later, in 1822, the\r\ndistillation of tar was carried on at Leith by Drs. Longstaff and Dalston,\r\nthe \"spirit\" being used by Mackintosh of Glasgow for dissolving\r\nindia-rubber for the preparation of that waterproof fabric which to this\r\nday bears the name of the original manufacturer. The residue in the still\r\nwas burnt for lamp-black. Of such little value was the tar at this time\r\nthat Dr. Longstaff tells us that the gas company gave them the tar on\r\ncondition that they removed it at their own expense. It appears also that\r\ntar was distilled on a large scale near Manchester in 1834, the \"spirit\"\r\nbeing used for dissolving the residual pitch so as to make a black\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\nBut the production of gas went on increasing at a greater rate than the\r\ndemand for tar for the above-mentioned purposes, and it was not till 1838\r\nthat a new branch of industry was inaugurated, which converted the\r\ndistillation of this material from an insignificant into an important\r\nmanufacture. In that year a patent was taken out by Bethell for preserving\r\ntimber by impregnating it with the heavy oil from coal-tar. The use of tar\r\nfor this purpose had been suggested by Lebon towards the end of the last\r\ncentury, and a patent had been granted in this country in 1836 to Franz\r\nMoll for this use of tar-products. But Bethell's process was put into a\r\nworking form by the great improvements in the apparatus introduced by\r\nBreant and Burt, and to the latter is due the credit of having founded an\r\nindustry which is still carried on by Messrs. Burt, Bolton and Haywood on\r\na colossal scale. The \"pickling\" or \"creosoting\" of timber is effected in\r\nan iron cylindrical boiler, into which the timber is run; the cylinder\r\nbeing then closed the air is pumped out, and the air contained in the\r\npores of the wood thus escapes. The creosoting oil, slightly warmed, is\r\nthen allowed to flow into the boiler, and thus penetrates into the pores\r\nof the wood, the complete saturation of which is insured by afterwards\r\npumping air into the cylinder and leaving the timber in the oil for some\r\nhours under a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nAll timber which is buried underground, or submerged in water, is\r\nimpregnated with this antiseptic creosote in order to prevent decay. It\r\nwill be evident that this application of tar-products must from the very\r\ncommencement have had an enormous influence upon the distillation of tar\r\nas a branch of industry. Consider the miles of wooden sleepers over which\r\nour railways are laid, and the network of telegraph wires carried all over\r\nthe country by wooden poles, of which the ends are buried in the earth.\r\nConsider also the many subaqueous works which necessitate the use of\r\ntimber, and we shall gain an idea of the demand for heavy coal-tar oil\r\ncreated by the introduction of Breant's process. Under the treatment\r\ndescribed a cubic foot of wood absorbs about a gallon of oil, and by far\r\nthe largest quantity of the tar oils is consumed in this way at the\r\npresent time. Now in the early days of timber-pickling the lighter oils of\r\nthe tar, which first come over on distillation, and which are too volatile\r\nfor the purpose of creosoting, were in much about the same industrial\r\nposition as the tar itself before its application as a timber\r\npreservative. The light oil had a limited use as a solvent for\r\nwaterproofing and varnish making, and a certain quantity was burnt as\r\ncoal-tar naphtha in specially constructed lamps, the invention of the late\r\nRead Holliday of Huddersfield, whose first patent was taken out in 1848\r\n(see Fig. 4). Up to this time, be it remembered, that chemists had not\r\nfound out what this naphtha contained. But science soon laid hands on the\r\nmaterials furnished by the tar-distiller, and the naphtha was one of the\r\nfirst products which was made to reveal the secret of its hidden treasures\r\nto the scientific investigator. From this period science and industry\r\nbecame indissolubly united, and the researches of chemists were carried\r\non hand-in-hand with the technical developments of coal-tar products.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Read Holliday's lamp for burning light coal-tar\r\noils. The oil is contained in the cistern _c_, from whence it flows down\r\nthe pipe, when the stopcock is opened, into the burner _a_. Below the\r\nburner is a little cup, in which some of the oil is kept burning, and the\r\nheat from this flame volatilizes the oil as it flows down the pipe, the\r\nvapour thus generated issuing from the jets in the burner and there\r\nundergoing ignition. The burner and cup are shown on an enlarged scale at\r\n_a_ in the lower figure.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Michael Faraday discovered a hydrocarbon in the oil produced by\r\nthe condensation of \"oil gas\"--an illuminating gas obtained by the\r\ndestructive distillation of oleaginous materials. This hydrocarbon was\r\nanalysed by its illustrious discoverer, and named in accordance with his\r\nresults \"bicarburet of hydrogen.\" In 1834 the same hydrocarbon was\r\nobtained by Mitscherlich by heating benzoic acid with lime, and by Peligot\r\nby the dry distillation of calcium benzoate. For this reason the compound\r\nwas named \"benzin\" by Mitscherlich, which name was changed into \"benzol\"\r\nby Liebig. In this country the hydrocarbon is known at the present time as\r\nbenzene. Twenty years after Faraday's discovery, viz. in 1845, Hofmann\r\nproved the existence of benzene in the light oils from coal-tar, and in\r\n1848 Hofmann's pupil, Mansfield, isolated considerable quantities of this\r\nhydrocarbon from the said light oils by fractional distillation. At the\r\ntime of these investigations no great demand for benzene existed, but the\r\nwork of Hofmann and Mansfield prepared the way for its manufacture on a\r\nlarge scale, when, a few years later, the first coal-tar colouring-matter\r\nwas discovered by our countryman, W. H. Perkin.\r\n\r\nIt is always of interest to trace the influence of scientific discovery\r\nupon different branches of industry. As soon as it had been shown that\r\nbenzene could be obtained from coal-tar, the nitro-derivative of this\r\nhydrocarbon--_i.e._ the oily compound produced by the action of nitric\r\nacid upon benzene--was introduced as a substitute for bitter almond oil\r\nunder the name of \"essence of mirbane.\" Nitrobenzene has an odour\r\nresembling that of bitter almond oil, and it is still used for certain\r\npurposes where the latter can be replaced by its cheaper substitute, such\r\nas for the scenting of soap. Although the isolation of benzene from\r\ncoal-tar gave an impetus to the manufacture of nitrobenzene, no use\r\nexisted for the latter beyond its very limited application as \"essence of\r\nmirbane,\" and the production of this compound was at that time too\r\ninsignificant to take rank as an important branch of chemical industry.\r\n\r\nThe year 1856 marks an epoch in the history of the utilization of coal-tar\r\nproducts with which the name of Perkin will ever be associated. In the\r\ncourse of some experiments, having for their object the artificial\r\nproduction of quinine, this investigator was led to try the action of\r\noxidizing agents upon a base known as aniline, and he thus obtained a\r\nviolet colouring matter--the first dye from coal-tar--which was\r\nmanufactured under a patent granted in 1858, and introduced into commerce\r\nunder the name of mauve. A brief sketch of the history of aniline will\r\nserve to show how Perkin's discovery gave a new value to the light oils\r\nfrom coal-tar and raised the manufacture of nitrobenzene into an important\r\nbranch of industry.\r\n\r\nThirty years before Perkin's experiments the Dutch chemist Unverdorben\r\nobtained (1826) a liquid base by the distillation of indigo, which had the\r\nproperty of forming beautifully crystalline salts, and which he named for\r\nthis reason \"crystallin.\" In 1834 Runge discovered the same base in\r\ncoal-tar, although its identity was not known to him at the time, and\r\nbecause it gave a bluish colour when acted upon by bleaching-powder, he\r\ncalled it \"kyanol.\" Again in 1840, by distilling a product obtained by the\r\naction of caustic alkalies upon indigo, Fritzsche prepared the same base,\r\nand gave it the name of aniline, from the Spanish designation of the\r\nindigo plant, \"anil,\" derived from the native Indian word, by which\r\nname the base is known at the present time. That aniline could be obtained\r\nby the reduction of nitrobenzene was shown by Zinin in 1842, who used\r\nsulphide of ammonium for reducing the nitrobenzene, and named the\r\nresulting base \"benzidam.\" The following year Hofmann showed that\r\ncrystallin, kyanol, aniline, and benzidam were all one and the same base.\r\nThus when the discovery of mauve opened up a demand for aniline on the\r\nlarge scale, the labours of chemists, from Unverdorben in 1826 to Hofmann\r\nin 1843, had prepared the way for the manufacturer. It must be understood\r\nthat although Runge had discovered aniline in coal-tar, this is not the\r\nsource of our present supply, for the quantity is too small to make it\r\nworth extracting. A mere trace of aniline is present in the tar ready\r\nformed; from the time this base was wanted in large quantities it had to\r\nbe made by nitrating benzene, and then reducing the nitrobenzene.\r\n\r\nThe light oils of tar distillation rejected by the timber-pickling\r\nindustry now came to the front, imbued with new interest to the\r\ntechnologist as a source of benzene for the manufacture of aniline. The\r\ninauguration of this manufacture, like the introduction of steam\r\nlocomotion, is connected with a sad catastrophe. Mansfield, who first\r\nshowed manufacturers how to separate benzene and other hydrocarbons from\r\nthe light oils of coal-tar, and who devised for this purpose apparatus\r\nsimilar in principle to that used on a large scale at the present time\r\n(see Fig. 5), met with an accident which resulted in his death. In the\r\nupper part of a house in Holborn in February 1856, this pioneer was\r\ncarrying on his experiments, when the contents of a still boiled over and\r\ncaught fire. In his endeavours to extinguish the flames he received the\r\ninjuries which terminated fatally. Applied science no less than pure\r\nscience has had its martyrs, and among these Mansfield must be ranked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Mansfield's still. R the heating burner, A the\r\nbody of the still with stopcock, _i_, for running out the contents. B the\r\nstill-head kept in a cistern, C, of hot water or other liquid. The vapour\r\ngenerated by the boiling of the liquid in A, partly condenses in B, from\r\nwhence the higher boiling-point portion flows back into the still. The\r\nuncondensed vapour passes into the condensing-worm, D, which is kept cool\r\nby a stream of water, and from thence flows into the receiver S. By\r\nopening _m_ in the side-pipe any higher boiling-point oil condensing in\r\nthe delivery-pipe can be run back into the still.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operation of tar-distilling is about as unromantic a process as can be\r\nimagined, but it must be briefly described before the subsequent\r\ndevelopments of the industry can be appreciated properly. It has already\r\nbeen explained that the tar is a complex mixture of many different\r\nsubstances. These various compounds boil at certain definite temperatures,\r\nthe boiling-point of a chemical compound being an inherent property. If a\r\nmixture of substances boiling at different temperatures is heated in a\r\nsuitable vessel the compounds distil over, broadly speaking, in the order\r\nof their boiling-points. The separation by this process is not absolute,\r\nbecause compounds boiling at a certain temperature have a tendency to\r\nbring over with them the vapours of other compounds which boil at a higher\r\ntemperature. But for practical purposes it will be sufficient to consider\r\nthat the general tendency is for the compounds of low boiling-point to\r\ncome over first, then the compounds of higher boiling-point, and finally\r\nthose of the highest boiling-point. This is the principle made use of by\r\nthe tar-distiller. The tar-still is a large iron pot provided with a\r\nstill-head from which the vapours boil out into a coil of iron pipe kept\r\ncool in a vessel of water (see Fig. 6). The still is heated by a fire\r\nbeneath it, and the different portions which condense in the iron coil are\r\nreceived in vessels which are changed as the different fractions of the\r\ntar come over. The process is what chemists would call a rough fractional\r\ndistillation. The first fractions are liquid at ordinary temperatures, and\r\nthe water in the condenser is kept cold; then, as the boiling-point\r\nrises, the fraction contains a hydrocarbon which solidifies on cooling,\r\nand the water in the condenser is made hot to prevent the choking up of\r\nthe coil. Every one of these fractions of coal-tar, from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the process, has its story to tell--all the chief constituents\r\nof the tar separated by this means have by chemical science been converted\r\ninto useful products.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Sectional diagram of tar-still with arched bottom.\r\nThe fireplace is at _i_; the hot gases pass over the bridge _k_ and\r\nthrough _g_ into the flues _h_, _h_. The pipe at _c_ is to supply the\r\nstill with tar; _a_ is the exit pipe connected with the condenser, and _b_\r\na man-hole for cleaning out the still. The condenser and bottom pipe for\r\ndrawing off pitch have been omitted to avoid complication.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary at the present time to collect four distinct fractions\r\nfrom the period when the tar begins to boil quietly, _i.e._ from the\r\npoint when the small quantity of watery liquor which is unavoidably\r\nentangled with the tar has distilled over, by which time the temperature\r\nin the still is about 110 deg. C. The small fraction that comes over up to\r\nthis temperature constitutes what the tar-distiller calls \"first\r\nrunnings.\" From 110 deg. C. to 210 deg. C. there comes over a limpid inflammable\r\nliquid known as \"light oil,\" and this is succeeded by a fraction which\r\nshows a tendency to solidify on cooling, owing to the separation of a\r\nsolid crystalline hydrocarbon known as naphthalene. This last fraction,\r\nboiling between 210 deg. C. and 240 deg. C., is known as \"carbolic oil,\" because\r\nit contains, in addition to the naphthalene, the chief portion of the\r\ncarbolic acid present in the tar. From 240 deg. C. to 270 deg. C. there comes over\r\nanother fraction which shows but little tendency to solidify in the\r\ncondensing coil, and which is known as \"heavy oil,\" or \"creosote oil.\"\r\nFrom 270 deg. C. up to the end of the distillation there distils a fraction\r\nwhich is viscid in consistency, and has a tendency to solidify on cooling\r\nowing to the separation of another crystalline hydrocarbon known as\r\nanthracene, and which gives the name of \"anthracene oil\" to this last\r\nfraction. When the latter has been collected there remains in the still\r\nthe black viscid substance known as pitch, which is obtained of any\r\ndesired consistency by leaving more or less of the anthracene oil mixed\r\nwith it, or by afterwards mixing it with the heavy oil from previous\r\ndistillations. The process carried out in the tar-still thus separates the\r\ntar into--(1) First runnings, up to 110 deg. C. (2) Light oil, from 110 deg. to\r\n210 deg. C. (3) Carbolic oil, from 210 deg. to 240 deg. C. (4) Creosote oil, from 240 deg.\r\nto 270 deg. C. (5) Anthracene oil, from 270 deg. to pitch. (6) Pitch, left in\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that coal-tar is a complex mixture of various\r\ndistinct chemical compounds. Included among the gases, ammoniacal liquor,\r\nand tar, the compounds which are known to be formed by the destructive\r\ndistillation of coal already reach to nearly one hundred and fifty in\r\nnumber. Of the substances present in the tar, about a dozen are utilized\r\nas raw materials by the manufacturer, and these are contained in the\r\nfractions described above. The first runnings and light oil contain a\r\nseries of important hydrocarbons, of which the three first members are\r\nknown to chemists as benzene, toluene, and xylene, the latter being\r\npresent in three different modifications. The carbolic oil furnishes\r\ncarbolic acid and naphthalene, and the anthracene oil the hydrocarbon\r\nwhich gives its name to that fraction. Here we have only half a dozen\r\ndistinct chemical compounds to deal with, and if we confine our attention\r\nto these for the present, we shall be enabled to gain a good general idea\r\nof what chemistry has done with these raw materials. The products\r\nseparated during the processes which have to be resorted to for the\r\nisolation of these raw materials have also their uses, which will be\r\npointed out incidentally.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the first runnings and the light oil, from which the\r\nhydrocarbons of the benzene series are separated, we have to make\r\nourselves acquainted with the treatment to which these fractions are\r\nsubmitted by the tar-distiller. The light oil is first distilled from an\r\niron still, similar to a tar-still, and the first portions which come over\r\nare added to the oily fraction brought over by the water of the first\r\nrunnings. The separation of the oil from the water in this last fraction\r\nis a simple matter, because the hydrocarbons float as a distinct layer on\r\nthe water, and do not mix with it. We have at this stage, therefore, four\r\nproducts to consider, viz. 1st, the oil from the first runnings; 2nd, the\r\nfirst portions of the light oil; 3rd, the later portions of the light oil;\r\nand 4th, the residue in the still. The first and second are mixed\r\ntogether, and the third is washed alternately with alkali and acid to\r\nremove acid and basic impurities, and can then be mixed with the first and\r\nsecond products. The total product is then ready for the next operation.\r\nThe last portion of the light oil which remains in the still is useless as\r\na source of benzene hydrocarbons, and goes into the heavy oil of the later\r\ntar fractions.\r\n\r\nThe process of purification is thus far one of fractional distillation\r\ncombined with chemical washing. In fact, all the processes of purification\r\nto which these oils are submitted are essentially of the same character.\r\nThe principle of fractional distillation has already been explained\r\nsufficiently for our present purpose. The process of washing a liquid may\r\nappear mysterious to the uninitiated, but in principle it is extremely\r\nsimple. If we pour some water into a bottle, and then add some liquid\r\nwhich does not mix with the water--say paraffin oil--the two liquids form\r\ndistinct layers, the one floating on the other. On shaking the bottle so\r\nas to mix the contents, the two liquids form a homogeneous mixture at\r\nfirst, but on standing for a short time separation into two layers again\r\ntakes place. Now if there was present in the paraffin oil some substance\r\nsoluble in the oil, but more soluble in water, such as alcohol, we should\r\nby the operation described wash the alcohol out of the oil, and when the\r\nliquids separated into layers after agitation the watery layer would\r\ncontain the alcohol. By drawing off the oil or the water the former would\r\nthen be obtained free from alcohol--it would have been \"washed.\" This\r\noperation is precisely what the manufacturer does on a large scale with\r\nthe coal-tar oils. These oils contain certain impurities of which some are\r\nof an acid character and dissolve in alkalies, while others are basic and\r\ndissolve in acid. The oil is therefore agitated in a suitable vessel\r\nprovided with mechanical stirring gear with an aqueous solution of caustic\r\nsoda, and after separation into layers the alkaline solution retaining the\r\nacid impurities is drawn off. Then the oil may be washed with water in the\r\nsame way to remove the lingering traces of alkali, and then with\r\nacid--sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol--which dissolves out basic\r\nimpurities and certain hydrocarbons not belonging to the benzene series\r\nwhich it is desirable to get rid of. A final washing with water removes\r\nany acid that may be retained by the oil.\r\n\r\nThe total product containing the benzene hydrocarbons is put through such\r\na series of washing operations as above described, and is then ready for\r\nseparation into its constituents by another and more perfect process of\r\nfractional distillation. This final separation is effected in a piece of\r\napparatus somewhat complicated in structure, but simple in principle. It\r\nis a development on a large scale of the apparatus used by Mansfield in\r\nhis early experiments. The details of construction are not essential to\r\nthe present treatment of the subject, but it will suffice to say that the\r\nvapours of the boiling hydrocarbons ascend through upright columns, in\r\nwhich the compounds of high boiling-point first condense and run back into\r\nthe still, while the lower boiling-point compounds do not condense in the\r\ncolumns, but pass on into a separate condenser, where they liquefy and are\r\ncollected. But even with this rectification we do not get a perfect\r\nseparation--the hydrocarbons are not perfectly pure from a chemical point\r\nof view, although they are pure enough for manufacturing purposes. Thus\r\nthe first fraction consists of benzene containing a small percentage of\r\ntoluene, then comes over a mixture containing a larger proportion of\r\ntoluene, then comes a purer toluene mixed with a small percentage of\r\nxylene. The boiling-points of the three hydrocarbons are 81 deg. C., 111 deg. C.,\r\nand 140 deg. C. respectively; but owing to the nature of fractional\r\ndistillation, a compound of a certain boiling-point always brings over\r\nwith it a certain quantity of the compound of higher boiling-point, and\r\nthat is why the rectifying column effects only a partial separation.\r\n\r\nOf the hydrocarbons thus separated, benzene and toluene are by far the\r\nmost important; there is but a limited use for the xylenes at present, and\r\nthese and the hydrocarbons of higher boiling-point belonging to the same\r\nseries which distil over between 140 deg. and 150 deg. constitute what is known as\r\n\"solvent naphtha,\" because it is used for dissolving india-rubber for\r\nwaterproofing purposes. The hydrocarbons of still higher boiling-point\r\nwhich remain in the still are used as burning naphtha for lamps. If\r\nbenzene of a higher degree of purity is required--as it is for the\r\nmanufacture of certain colouring-matters--the fraction containing this\r\nhydrocarbon can be again distilled through the rectifying column, and a\r\nlarge proportion of the toluene thus separated from it. Finally, pure\r\nbenzene can be obtained by submitting the rectified hydrocarbon to a\r\nprocess of refrigeration in a mixture of ice and salt, when the benzene\r\nsolidifies to a white crystalline solid, while the toluene does not\r\nsolidify, and can be drained away from the benzene crystals which liquefy\r\nat about 5 deg. C.\r\n\r\nThe account rendered by the technologist with respect to the light oils of\r\nthe tar is thus a pretty good one. Already we see that benzene, toluene,\r\nsolvent naphtha, and burning naphtha are separated from them. Even the\r\nalkaline and acid washings may be made to surrender their contained\r\nproducts, for the first of these contains a certain quantity of carbolic\r\nacid, and the acid contains a strongly smelling base called pyridine, for\r\nwhich there is at present no great demand, but which may one day become of\r\nimportance. The actual quantity of benzene in tar is a little over one per\r\ncent. by weight, and of toluene there is somewhat less. The naphthas are\r\npresent to the extent of about 35 per cent.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider some of the transformations which benzene and toluene\r\nundergo in the hands of the manufacturing chemist. The production of\r\naniline from benzene by acting upon this hydrocarbon with nitric acid, and\r\nthen reducing the nitrobenzene, has already been referred to. For this\r\npurpose we now heat the nitrobenzene with iron dust and a little\r\nhydrochloric (muriatic) acid, and then distil over the aniline by means of\r\na current of steam blown through the still. By a similar process toluene\r\nis converted into nitrotoluene, and the latter into toluidine.\r\n\r\nThe large quantity of aniline and toluidine now made has opened up a\r\nchannel for the use of the waste borings from cast-iron. These are ground\r\nto a fine powder under heavy mill-stones, and constitute a most valuable\r\nreducing agent, known technically as \"iron swarf.\" The metallic iron\r\nintroduced in this form into the aniline still is converted into an oxide\r\nof iron by the action of the nitrobenzene, and this oxide of iron is used\r\nby the gas-maker for purifying the gas from sulphur as already described.\r\nWhen the oxide of iron is exhausted, _i.e._ when it has taken up as much\r\nsulphur as it can, it goes to the vitriol-maker to be burnt as a source of\r\nthis acid. Here we have a waste product of the aniline manufacture\r\nutilized for the purification of coal-gas, and finally being made to give\r\nup the sulphur, which it obtained primarily from the coal, for the\r\nproduction of sulphuric acid, which is consumed in nearly every branch of\r\nchemical industry.\r\n\r\nNitrotoluene and toluidine each exist in three distinct modifications, so\r\nthat it is more correct to speak of the nitrotoluenes and the toluidines;\r\nbut the explanation of these differences belongs to pure chemical theory,\r\nand cannot now be attempted in detail. It must suffice to say that many\r\ncompounds having the same chemical composition differ in their properties,\r\nand are said to be \"isomeric,\" the isomerism being regarded as the result\r\nof the different order of arrangement of the atoms within the molecule.\r\n\r\nConsider a homely illustration. A child's box of bricks contains a certain\r\nnumber of wooden blocks, by means of which different structures can be\r\nbuilt up. Supposing all the bricks to be employed for every structure\r\nerected, the latter must in every case contain all the blocks, and yet the\r\nresult is different, because in each structure the blocks are arranged in\r\na different way. The bricks represent atoms, and the whole structure\r\nrepresents a molecule; the structures all have the same ultimate\r\ncomposition, and are therefore isomeric. This will serve as a rough\r\nanalogy, only it must not be understood that the different atoms of the\r\nelements composing a molecule are of different sizes and shapes; on this\r\npoint we are as yet profoundly ignorant.\r\n\r\nNow as long ago as 1856, at the time when Perkin began making mauve by\r\noxidizing aniline with bichromate of potash, it was observed by Natanson,\r\nthat when aniline was heated with a certain oxidizing agent a red\r\ncolouring-matter was produced. The same fact was observed in 1858 by\r\nHofmann, who used the tetrachloride of carbon as an oxidizing agent. These\r\nchemists obtained the red colouring-matter as a by-product; it was formed\r\nonly in small quantity, and was regarded as an impurity. In the same year,\r\n1858, two French manufacturers patented the production of a red dye formed\r\nby the action of chromic acid and other oxidizing agents on aniline, the\r\ncolouring matter thus made being used for dying artificial flowers. Then,\r\na year later, the French chemist Verguin found that the best oxidizing\r\nagent was the tetrachloride of tin, and this with many other oxidizing\r\nsubstances was patented by Renard Freres and Franc, and under their patent\r\nthe manufacture of the aniline red was commenced on a small scale in\r\nFrance. Finally, in 1860, an oxidizing agent was made use of almost\r\nsimultaneously by two English chemists, Medlock and Nicholson, which gave\r\na far better yield of the red than any of the other materials previously\r\nin use, and put the manufacture of the colouring-matter on quite a new\r\nbasis. The oxidizing material patented by Medlock and Nicholson is arsenic\r\nacid, and their process is carried on at the present time on an enormous\r\nscale in all the chief colour factories in Europe, the colouring-matter\r\nproduced by this means being generally known as fuchsine or magenta.\r\n\r\nIn four years the accidental observation of Natanson and Hofmann, made, be\r\nit remembered, in the course of abstract scientific investigation, had\r\nthus developed into an important branch of manufacture. A demand for\r\naniline on an increased scale sprung up, and the light oils of coal-tar\r\nbecame of still greater importance. The operations of the tar-distiller\r\nhad to undergo a corresponding increase in magnitude and refinement; the\r\nproduction of nitrobenzene and necessarily of nitric acid had to be\r\nincreased, and a new branch of manufacture, that of arsenic acid from\r\narsenious acid and nitric acid, was called into existence. Perkin's mauve\r\nprepared the way for the manufacture of aniline, and the discovery of a\r\ngood process for the production of magenta increased this branch of\r\nmanufacture to a remarkable extent. Still later in the history of the\r\nmagenta manufacture, attempts were made, with more or less success, to use\r\nnitrobenzene itself as an oxidizing agent, and a process was perfected in\r\n1869 by Coupier, which is now in use in many factories.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of magenta into commerce marks an epoch in the history of\r\nthe coal-tar colour industry--pure chemistry and chemical technology both\r\nprofited by the discovery. The brilliant red of this colouring-matter is\r\nobjected to by modern aestheticism, but the dye is still made in large\r\nquantities, its value having been greatly increased by a discovery made\r\nabout the same time by John Holliday and the Baden Aniline and Soda\r\nCompany, and patented by the latter in 1877. Magenta is the salt of a base\r\nnow known as rosaniline, and it belongs therefore to the class of basic\r\ncolouring-matters. The dyes of this kind are as a group less fast, and\r\nhave a more limited application than those colouring-matters which possess\r\nan acid character, so that the discovery above referred to--that magenta\r\ncould be converted into an acid without destroying its colouring power by\r\nacting upon it with very strong sulphuric acid--opened up a new field for\r\nthe employment of the dye, and greatly extended its usefulness. In this\r\nform the colouring-matter is met with under the name of \"acid magenta.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the production of magenta from aniline by the\r\noxidizing action of arsenic acid or nitrobenzene is the result of chemical\r\nchange; the colouring-matter is no more present in the aniline than the\r\nlatter is contained in the benzene. And just in the same way that the\r\ncolourless aniline oil by chemical transformation gives rise to the\r\nintensely colorific magenta, so the latter by further chemical change can\r\nbe made to give rise to whole series of different colouring-matters, each\r\nconsisting of definite chemical compounds as distinct in individuality as\r\nmagenta itself. Thus in 1860, about the time when the arsenic acid process\r\nwas inaugurated, two French chemists, Messrs. Girard and De Laire,\r\nobserved that by heating rosaniline for some time with aniline and an\r\naniline salt, blue and violet colouring-matters were produced. This\r\nobservation formed the starting-point of a new manufacture proceeding from\r\nmagenta as a raw material. The production of the new colouring-matters was\r\nperfected by various investigators, and a magnificent blue was the final\r\nresult. But here also the dye was of a basic character, and being\r\ninsoluble in water had only a limited application, as a spirit bath had to\r\nbe used for dissolving the substance. In 1862, however, an English\r\ntechnologist, the late E. C. Nicholson, found that by the action of strong\r\nsulphuric acid the aniline blue could be rendered soluble in water or\r\nalkali, and the value of the colouring-matter was enormously increased by\r\nthis discovery. The basic and slightly soluble spirit blue was by this\r\nmeans converted into acid blues, which are now made in large quantities,\r\nand sold under the names of Nicholson's blue, alkali blue, soluble blue,\r\nand other trade designations. There is at the present time hardly any\r\nother blue which for fastness, facility of dyeing, and beauty can compete\r\nwith this colouring-matter introduced by Nicholson as the outcome of the\r\nwork of Girard and De Laire.\r\n\r\nOther transformations of rosaniline have yet to be chronicled. In 1862\r\nHofmann found that by acting upon this base--the base of magenta--with the\r\niodide of methyl, violet colouring-matters were produced, and these were\r\nfor some years extensively employed under the name of Hofmann's violets.\r\nAnd still more remarkable, by the prolonged action of an excess of methyl\r\niodide upon rosaniline, Keisser found that a green colouring-matter was\r\nformed. The latter was patented in 1866, and the dye was for some time in\r\nuse under the name of \"iodine green.\" The statement that technology\r\nprofited by the introduction of magenta has therefore been justified.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add, that the tar obtained from one ton of Lancashire coal\r\nfurnishes an amount of aniline capable of giving a little over half a\r\npound of magenta. The colouring power of the latter will be inferred from\r\nthe fact, that this quantity would dye 375 square yards of white flannel\r\nof a full red colour, and if converted into Hofmann violet by methylation,\r\nwould give enough colour to dye double this surface of flannel of a deep\r\nviolet shade. It should be stated also, that during the formation of\r\nmagenta by the arsenic acid process, there are formed small quantities of\r\nother colouring-matters which are utilized by the manufacturer. Among\r\nthese by-products is a basic orange dye, which was isolated by Nicholson,\r\nand investigated by Hofmann in 1862. Under the name of \"phosphine\" this\r\ncolouring-matter is still used, especially for the dyeing of leather. Even\r\nthe spent arsenic acid of the magenta-still has its use. The arsenious\r\nacid resulting from the reduction of this arsenic acid is generally\r\nobtained in the form of a lime salt after the removal of the magenta by\r\nthe purifying processes to which the crude product is submitted. From the\r\narsenical waste arsenious acid can be recovered, and converted back into\r\narsenic acid by the action of nitric acid. Quite recently the arsenical\r\nresidue has been used with considerable success in America as an\r\ninsecticide for the destruction of pests injurious to agricultural crops.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with these technical developments of coal-tar products, the\r\nscientific chemist was carrying on his investigations. The compounds which\r\nscience had given to commerce were made on a scale that enabled the\r\ninvestigator to obtain his materials in quantities that appeared fabulous\r\nin the early days when aniline was regarded as a laboratory curiosity, and\r\nmagenta had been seen by only a few chemists.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem which the modern chemist seeks to solve is in the\r\nfirst place the composition of a compound, _i.e._ the number of the atoms\r\nof the different elements which form the molecule, and in the next place\r\nthe way in which these atoms are combined in the molecule. Reverting to\r\nour former analogy, the first thing to be found is how many different\r\nblocks enter into the composition of the structure, and the next thing is\r\nto ascertain how the blocks are arranged. When this is done, we are said\r\nto know the \"constitution\" or \"structure\" of the molecule, and in many\r\ncases when this is known we can build up or synthesise the compound by\r\ncombining its different groups of atoms by suitable methods. The coal-tar\r\nindustry abounds with such triumphs of chemical synthesis; a few of these\r\nachievements will be brought to light in the course of the remaining\r\nportions of this work.\r\n\r\nThe chemical investigation of magenta was commenced by Hofmann, whose name\r\nis inseparably connected with the scientific development of the coal-tar\r\ncolour industry. In 1862 he showed that magenta was the salt of a base\r\nwhich he isolated, analysed, and named rosaniline. He established the\r\ncomposition of this base and of the violet and blue colouring-matters\r\nobtained from it by the processes already described. In 1864 he made the\r\ninteresting discovery that magenta is not formed by the oxidation of\r\n_pure_ aniline, but that a mixture of aniline and toluidine is essential\r\nfor the production of this colouring-matter. In fact, the aniline oil used\r\nby the manufacturer had from the beginning consisted of a mixture of\r\naniline and toluidine, and at the present time \"aniline for red\" is made\r\nby nitrating a mixture of benzene and toluene and reducing the\r\nnitro-compounds.\r\n\r\nFrom this work of Hofmann's suggestions naturally arose concerning the\r\n\"constitution\" of rosaniline, and new and fruitful lines of work were\r\nopened up. Large numbers of chemists of the greatest eminence pursued the\r\ninquiry, but the details of their work, although of absorbing interest to\r\nthe chemist, cannot be discussed in the present volume. The final touch to\r\na long series of investigations was given by two German chemists, Emil and\r\nOtto Fischer, who in 1878 proved the constitution of rosaniline by\r\nobtaining from it a hydrocarbon, the parent hydrocarbon from which the\r\ncolouring-matter is derived. The purely scientific discovery of the\r\nFischers threw a flood of light on the chemistry of magenta, and enabled a\r\nlarge number of colouring-matters related to the latter to be classed\r\nunder one group, having the parent hydrocarbon as a central type. This\r\nhydrocarbon, it may be remarked, is known as triphenylmethane, as it is a\r\nderivative of methane, or marsh gas. The blues and violets obtained from\r\nrosaniline belong to this group, and so also do certain other\r\ncolouring-matters which had been manufactured before the Fischers'\r\ndiscovery. In order to carry on the story of the utilisation of aniline,\r\nit is necessary to know something about these other colouring-matters\r\nwhich are obtained from it.\r\n\r\nIt has been explained that by the methylation of rosaniline Hofmann\r\nobtained violet colouring-matters. Now as rosaniline is obtained by the\r\noxidation of a mixture of aniline and toluidine, it seems but natural that\r\nif these bases were methylated first and then oxidized a violet dye would\r\nbe produced. The French chemist Lauth first obtained a violet\r\ncolouring-matter by this method in 1861. In 1866 this violet dye was\r\nmanufactured in France by Poirrier, and it is still made in large\r\nquantities, being known under the name of \"methyl violet.\" This\r\ncolouring-matter, and a bluer derivative of it discovered in 1868,\r\ngradually displaced the Hofmann violets, chiefly owing to their greater\r\ncheapness of production. We are thus introduced to methylated aniline as a\r\nsource of colouring-matters, and as the compound in question has many\r\ndifferent uses in the coal-tar industry, a few words must be devoted to\r\nits technology.\r\n\r\nAniline, toluidine, and similar bases can be methylated by the action of\r\nmethyl iodide, but the cost of iodine is too great to enable this process\r\nto be used by the manufacturer. Methyl chloride, however, answers equally\r\nwell, and this compound, which is a liquid of very low boiling point (-23 deg.\r\nC.), is prepared on a large scale from the waste material of another\r\nindustry, viz. the beet-sugar manufacture. It is interesting to see how\r\ndistinct industries by chemical skill are made to act and react upon one\r\nanother. Thus the cultivation of the beet, as already explained, is\r\nlargely dependent on the supply of ammonia from gas-liquor. During the\r\nrefining of the beet-sugar, a large quantity of uncrystallisable treacle\r\nis separated, and this is fermented for the manufacture of alcohol. When\r\nthe latter is distilled off there remains a spent liquor containing among\r\nother things potassium salts and nitrogenous compounds. This waste liquor,\r\ncalled \"vinasse,\" is evaporated down and ignited in order to recover the\r\npotash, and during the ignition, ammonia, tar, gas, and other volatile\r\nproducts are given off. Among the volatile products is a base called\r\ntrimethylamine, which is a derivative of ammonia; the salt formed by\r\ncombining trimethylamine with hydrochloric acid when heated gives off\r\nmethyl chloride as a gas which can be condensed by pressure.\r\n\r\nHere we have a very pretty cycle of chemical transmigration. The nitrogen\r\nof the coal plants, stored up in the earth for ages, is restored in the\r\nform of ammonia to the crops of growing beet; the nitrogen is made to\r\nenter into the composition of the latter plant by the chemico-physiological\r\nprocess going on, and the nitrogenous compounds removed from the plant and\r\nheated to the point of decomposition in presence of the potash (which also\r\nentered into the composition of the plant), give back their nitrogen\r\npartly in the form of a base from which methyl chloride can be obtained.\r\nThe latter is then made to methylate a product, aniline, derived indirectly\r\nfrom coal-tar. The utilisation of the \"vinasse\" for this purpose was made\r\nknown by Camille Vincent of Paris in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe methylation of aniline can obviously be carried out by the foregoing\r\nprocess only when beet-sugar residues are available. There is another\r\nmethod which is more generally used, and which is interesting as bringing\r\nin a distinct branch of industry. The same result can, in fact, be arrived\r\nat by heating dry aniline hydrochloride, _i.e._ the hydrochloric acid salt\r\nof aniline, with methyl alcohol or wood-spirit in strong metallic boilers\r\nunder great pressure. This is the process carried on in most factories,\r\nand it involves the use of pure methyl alcohol, a branch of manufacture\r\nwhich has been called into existence to meet the requirements of the\r\ncoal-tar colour maker.[4] This alcohol or wood-spirit is obtained by the\r\ndestructive distillation of wood, and is purified by a series of\r\noperations which do not at present concern us. It must be mentioned that\r\nthe product of the methylation of aniline, which it is the object of the\r\nmanufacturer to obtain, is an oily liquid called dimethylaniline, which,\r\nby virtue of the chemical transformation, is quite different in its\r\nproperties to the aniline from which it is derived. By a similar\r\noperation, using ethyl alcohol, or spirit of wine, diethylaniline can be\r\nobtained, and by heating dry aniline hydrochloride with aniline under\r\nsimilar conditions a crystalline base called diphenylamine is also\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nNow these products--dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, and\r\ndiphenylamine--are derived from aniline, and they are all sources of\r\ncolouring-matters. Methyl-violet is obtained by the oxidation of\r\ndimethylaniline by means of a gentle oxidizer; a mixture of bases is not\r\nnecessary as in the case of the magenta formation. Then in 1866\r\ndiphenylamine was shown by Girard and De Laire to be capable of yielding a\r\nfine blue by heating it with oxalic acid, and this blue, on account of the\r\npurity of its shade, is still an article of commerce. It can be made\r\nsoluble by the action of sulphuric acid in just the same way as the other\r\naniline blue. Furthermore, by acting with excess of methyl chloride on\r\nmethyl violet, a brilliant green colouring-matter was manufactured in\r\n1878, which was obviously analogous to the iodine green already mentioned,\r\nand which for some years held its own as the only good coal-tar green.\r\nThese are the dyes--methyl violet and green, and diphenylamine blue--which\r\nwere in commerce before the discovery of the Fischers, and which this\r\ndiscovery enabled chemists to class with magenta, aniline blue, and\r\nHofmann violet in the triphenylmethane group.\r\n\r\nLater developments bring us into contact with other dyes of the same\r\nclass, and with the industrial evolution of the purely scientific idea\r\nconcerning the constitution of the colouring-matters of this group.\r\nBenzene and toluene again form the points of departure. By the action of\r\nchlorine upon the vapour of boiling toluene there are obtained, according\r\nto the extent of the action of the chlorine, three liquids of use to the\r\ncolour manufacturer. The first of these is benzyl chloride, the second\r\nbenzal chloride, and the third benzotrichloride or phenyl chloroform.\r\nBenzyl chloride, it may be remarked in passing, plays the same part in\r\norganic chemistry as methyl chloride, and enables certain compounds to be\r\nbenzylated, just in the same way that they can be methylated. The bluer\r\nshade of methyl violet, introduced in 1868, and still manufactured, is a\r\nbenzylated derivative. By the action of benzotrichloride on\r\ndimethylaniline in the presence of dry zinc chloride, Oscar Doebner\r\nobtained in 1878 a brilliant green colouring-matter which was manufactured\r\nunder the name of \"malachite green.\" It will be remembered that this was\r\nabout the time when the Fischers were engaged with their investigations.\r\nThese last chemists, by virtue of their scientific results, were enabled\r\nto show that Doebner's green was a member of the triphenylmethane group,\r\nand they prepared the same compound by another method which has enabled\r\nthe manufacturer to dispense with the use of the somewhat expensive and\r\ndisagreeable benzotrichloride. The Fischers' method consists in heating\r\ndimethylaniline with bitter-almond oil and oxidizing the product thus\r\nformed, when the green colouring-matter is at once produced. This method\r\nbrings the technologist into competition with Nature, and we shall see the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nBenzoic aldehyde or bitter-almond oil is one of the oldest known products\r\nof the vegetable kingdom, and has from time to time been made the subject\r\nof investigation by chemists since the beginning of the century. It arises\r\nfrom the fermentation of a nitrogenous compound found in the almond, and\r\nknown as amygdalin, the nature of the fermentative change undergone by\r\nthis substance having been brought to light by Woehler and Liebig. The\r\ndiscovery of a green dye, requiring for its preparation a vegetable\r\nproduct which was very costly, compelled the manufacturer to seek another\r\nsource of the oil. Pure chemistry again steps in, and solves the problem.\r\nIn 1863 it was known to Cahours that benzal chloride, on being heated with\r\nwater or alkali, gave benzoic aldehyde, and in 1867 Lauth and Grimaux\r\nshowed that the same compound could be formed by oxidizing benzyl chloride\r\nin the presence of water. It was but a step from the laboratory into the\r\nfactory in this case, and at the present time the aldehyde is made on a\r\nlarge scale by chlorinating boiling toluene beyond the stage of benzyl\r\nchloride, and heating the mixture of benzal chloride and benzotrichloride\r\nwith lime and water under pressure. By this means the first compound is\r\ntransformed into benzoic aldehyde, and the second into benzoic acid. This\r\nlast substance is also required by the colour-maker, as it is used in the\r\nmanufacture of blue by the action of aniline on rosaniline; without some\r\nsuch organic acid the transformation of rosaniline into the blue is very\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nBenzoic acid, like the aldehyde, is a natural product which has long been\r\nknown. It was obtained from gum benzoin at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and its preparation from this source was described by\r\nScheele in 1755. The same chemist afterwards found it in urine, and from\r\nthese two sources, the one vegetable and the other animal, the acid was\r\nformerly prepared. Its relationship to benzene has already been alluded to\r\nin connection with the history of that hydrocarbon. It will be remembered\r\nthat by heating this acid with lime Mitscherlich obtained benzene in\r\n1834. In one operation, therefore, setting out from toluene, we make these\r\ntwo natural products, the aldehyde and acid, which are easily separable by\r\ntechnical processes. The wants of the technologist have been met, and he\r\nhas been enabled to compete successfully with Nature, for he can\r\nmanufacture these products much more cheaply than when he had to depend\r\nupon bitter almonds or gum benzoin. The synthetical bitter-almond oil is\r\nchemically identical with that from the plant. Besides its use for the\r\nmanufacture of colouring-matters, it is employed for flavouring purposes\r\nand in perfumery, this being the first instance of a coal-tar perfume\r\nwhich we have had occasion to mention. The odour in this case, it must be\r\nremembered, is that of the actual compound which imparts the\r\ncharacteristic taste and smell to the almond; it is not the result of\r\nsubstituting a substance which has a particular odour for another having a\r\nsimilar odour, as is the case with nitrobenzene, which, as already\r\nmentioned, is used in large quantities under the name of \"essence of\r\nmirbane,\" for imparting an almond-like smell to soap.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of malachite green marks another epoch in the history of\r\nthe technology of the triphenylmethane colours. The action between benzoic\r\naldehyde and other bases analogous to dimethylaniline was found to be\r\nquite general, and the principle was extended to diethylaniline and\r\nsimilarly constituted bases. Various green dyes--some of them acids formed\r\nby the action of sulphuric acid on the colour base--are now manufactured,\r\nand many other colouring-matters of the same group are synthesised by the\r\nbenzoic aldehyde process.\r\n\r\nOne other development of this branch of manufacture has yet to be\r\nrecorded. The new departure was made in 1883 by Caro and Kern, who\r\npatented a process for the synthesis of colouring-matters of this group.\r\nIn this synthesis a gas called phosgene is used, the said gas having been\r\ndiscovered by John Davy in 1811, who gave it its name because it is formed\r\nby the direct union of chlorine and carbon monoxide under the influence of\r\nsunlight. Caro and Kern's process is the first technical application of\r\nDavy's compound. By the action of phosgene on dimethylaniline and\r\nanalogous bases in the presence of certain compounds which promote the\r\nchemical interaction, a number of basic colouring-matters of brilliant\r\nshades of violet (\"crystal violet\") and blue (\"Victoria blue,\" \"night\r\nblue\") are produced, these being all members of the triphenylmethane\r\ngroup. One of these dyes is a fine basic yellow known as \"auramine,\" which\r\nis a derivative of diphenylmethane.\r\n\r\n                                   TAR.\r\n                               (Light oil)\r\n                                |       |\r\n                                |       |\r\n                ----------------        --------\r\n                |                              |      / Benzyl chloride\r\n             Benzene                         Toluene {  Benzal chloride }\r\n                |                               |  |  \\ Benzotrichloride}<-\r\n                |                               |  ------------           |\r\n             Aniline-> Magenta (and Phosphine)<-Toluidine     |           |\r\n             /      \\                |     \\                  |           |\r\n            /        \\               |      \\        ---Benzoic acid and<-\r\n  Dimethylaniline    Diphenylamine   |       \\       |  Benzoic aldehyde\r\n        |                |           |        \\      |              /\r\n        |                |           |        Aniline Blues:       /\r\n        |                |    Hofmann Violet    Nicholson and     /\r\n        |                |   and Iodine Green   Soluble          /\r\n        |            Diph.

The relationship of those\r\ncompounds to each other and to their generating substances is not easy to\r\ngrasp by those to whom the facts are presented for the first time. The\r\nscheme on page 107 shows these relationships at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe colouring-matters derived from these two hydrocarbons are far from\r\nbeing exhausted. During the oxidation of aniline for the production of\r\nmauve--which colouring-matter, it may be mentioned, is no longer made--a\r\nred compound is formed as a by-product. This was isolated by Perkin in\r\n1861, and studied scientifically by Hofmann and Geyger, who established\r\nits composition in 1872, the dye being at that time manufactured under the\r\nname of \"saffranine.\" It appears to have been first introduced about 1868.\r\nThe conditions of formation of this dye were at first imperfectly\r\nunderstood, but the problem was attacked by chemists and technologists,\r\nand the first point of importance resulting from their work was that\r\nsaffranine was derived from one of the toluidines present in the\r\ncommercial aniline. To record the various steps in this chapter of\r\nindustrial chemistry would take us beyond the scope of the present work.\r\nIn addition to the chemists named, Caro, Bindschedler, and others\r\ncontributed to the technology, while the scientific side of the matter was\r\nfirst taken up by Nietzki in 1877, by Otto Witt in 1878, and by Bernthsen\r\nin 1886. It is to the work of these chemists, and especially to that of\r\nWitt, that we owe our present knowledge of the constitution of this and\r\nallied colouring-matters. Space will not admit of our traversing the\r\nground, although to chemists it is a line of investigation full of\r\ninterest; it will be sufficient to say that by 1886 these investigators\r\nhad accomplished for these colouring-matters what the Fischers had done\r\nfor the rosaniline group--they established their constitution, and showed\r\nthat they were derivatives of diphenylamine, containing two nitrogen atoms\r\njoined together in a particular way. The parent-substance from which these\r\ncompounds are derived is known at the present time as \"azine\" (French,\r\nazote = nitrogen), and the dyes belong accordingly to the azine group. The\r\nfirst coal-tar colouring-matter, Perkin's mauve, is a member of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe azine dyes are basic, and mostly of a red or pink shade; they are\r\nsomewhat fugitive when exposed to light, but possess a certain value on\r\naccount of their affinity for cotton, and the readiness with which they\r\ncan be used in admixture with other colouring-matters. Some of the best\r\nknown are made by oxidizing certain derivatives of aniline or toluidine,\r\nin the presence of these or analogous bases. To make this intelligible a\r\nlittle more chemistry is necessary. Aniline is a derivative of benzene in\r\nwhich one atom of hydrogen is replaced by the residue of ammonia. Ammonia\r\nis composed of one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen; benzene\r\nis composed of six atoms of carbon and six of hydrogen. If one atom of\r\nhydrogen is supposed to be withdrawn from ammonia, there remains a residue\r\ncalled the amido-group, and if we imagine this group to be substituted for\r\none of the hydrogen atoms in benzene, we have an amido-derivative, _i.e._\r\namidobenzene or aniline. Similarly, the toluidines are amidotoluenes. If\r\ntwo hydrogen atoms in benzene or toluene are replaced by two amido-groups,\r\nwe have diamidobenzenes and diamidotoluenes, which are strongly basic\r\nsubstances, capable of existing in several isomeric modifications. Certain\r\nof these diamido-compounds when oxidized in the presence of a further\r\nquantity of aniline, toluidine, and such amido-compounds, give rise to\r\nunstable blue products, which readily become transformed into red dyes of\r\nthe azine group.\r\n\r\nSome azine dyes are produced by another method, which is instructive\r\nbecause it brings us into contact with a derivative of dimethylaniline\r\nwhich figures largely in the coal-tar colour industry. By the action of\r\nnitrous acid on this base, there is produced a compound known as\r\nnitrosodimethylaniline, which was discovered by Baeyer and Caro in 1874,\r\nand which contains the residue of nitrous acid in place of one atom of\r\nhydrogen. The residue of nitric acid which replaces hydrogen in benzene is\r\nthe nitro-group, and the compound is nitrobenzene. The analogy with\r\nnitrous acid will therefore be sufficiently understood--the residue of\r\nthis acid is the nitroso-group, and compounds containing this group are\r\nnitroso-derivatives. In 1879, Otto Witt found that the nitroso-group in\r\nnitrosodimethylaniline acted as an oxidizing group, and enabled this\r\ncompound to act upon certain diamido-derivatives of benzene and toluene,\r\nwith the formation of unstable blue compounds, which on heating the\r\nsolution changed into red colouring-matters of the azine group. This\r\nprocess soon bore fruit industrially, and azines of a red, violet, and\r\nblue shade were introduced under the names of neutral red, violet, and\r\nblue, Basle blue, &c., some of these surviving at the present time.\r\n\r\nWe have now to turn to another chapter in the history of dimethylaniline.\r\nIn 1876, Lauth discovered a new colour test for one of the\r\ndiamidobenzenes. By heating this base with sulphur, and oxidizing the\r\nproduct, a violet colouring-matter was formed, and the same compound was\r\nproduced by oxidizing the base in an aqueous solution in the presence of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Lauth's violet was never manufactured in quantity\r\nbecause the yield is small; but in the hands of Dr. Caro the work of Lauth\r\nbore fruit in another direction. Instead of using the diamidobenzene, Caro\r\nused its dimethyl-derivative, and by this means obtained a splendid blue\r\ndye, which was introduced under the name of \"methylene blue.\" Here again\r\nwe find scientific research reacting on technology. A few words of\r\nchemical explanation will make this manufacture intelligible. By the\r\naction of reducing agents on nitro and nitroso-compounds, the nitro and\r\nnitroso-group become converted into the amido-group. Thus when\r\nnitrobenzene is reduced by iron and an acid we get aniline; similarly when\r\nnitrosodimethylaniline is reduced by zinc and an acid we get\r\namidodimethylaniline, and this is the base used in the preparation of\r\nmethylene blue. By oxidizing this base in the presence of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, the colouring-matter is formed. Other methods of arriving at the\r\nsame result were discovered and patented in due course, but the various\r\nprocesses cannot be discussed here.\r\n\r\nLauth's violet and methylene blue became the subjects of scientific\r\ninvestigation in 1879 by Koch, and in 1883 a series of brilliant\r\nresearches were commenced by Bernthsen which extended over several years,\r\nand which established the constitution of these compounds. It was shown\r\nthat they are derivatives of diphenylamine containing sulphur as an\r\nessential constituent. The parent-compound is diphenylamine in which\r\nsulphur replaces hydrogen, and is therefore known as thiodiphenylamine. It\r\ncan be prepared by heating diphenylamine with sulphur, and is sometimes\r\ncalled thiazine, because it is somewhat analogous in type to azine. We\r\nmust therefore credit dimethylaniline with being the industrial generator\r\nof the thiazines. The blue is largely used for cotton dyeing, producing on\r\nthis fibre when properly mordanted an indigo shade. By the action of\r\nnitrous acid the blue is converted into a green known as \"methylene\r\ngreen.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the scope of this work admits of our dealing with only a few of\r\nthe more important groups of colouring-matters, it will already be evident\r\nthat the chemist has turned benzene and toluene to good account. But great\r\nas is the demand for these hydrocarbons for the foregoing purposes, there\r\nare other branches of the coal-tar industry which are dependent upon them.\r\nIt will serve as an answer to those who are continually raising the cry of\r\nbrilliancy as an offence to aesthetic taste if we consider in the next\r\nplace a most valuable and important black obtained from aniline. All\r\nchemists who studied the action of oxidizing agents, such as chromic acid,\r\non aniline, from Runge in 1834 to Perkin in 1856, observed the formation\r\nof greenish or bluish-black compounds. After many attempts to utilize\r\nthese as colouring-matters, success was achieved by John Lightfoot of\r\nAccrington near Manchester in 1863. By using as an oxidizing agent a\r\nmixture of potassium chlorate and a copper salt, Lightfoot devised a\r\nmethod for printing and dyeing cotton fabrics, the use of which spread\r\nrapidly and created an increased demand for the hydrochloride of aniline,\r\nthis salt being now manufactured in enormous quantities under the\r\ntechnical designation of \"aniline salt.\" Lightfoot's process was improved\r\nfor printing purposes by Lauth in 1864, and many different oxidizing\r\nmixtures have been subsequently introduced, notably the salts of vanadium,\r\nwhich are far more effective than the salts of copper, and which were\r\nfirst employed by Lightfoot in 1872. In 1875-76 Coquillion and\r\nGoppelsroeder showed that aniline black is produced when an electric\r\ncurrent is made to decompose a solution of an aniline salt, the oxidizing\r\nagent here being the nascent oxygen resulting from the electrolysis. In\r\nthese days when the generation of electricity is so economically effected,\r\nthis process may become more generally used, and the coal-tar industry\r\nmay thus be brought into relationship with another branch of applied\r\nscience. Aniline black is seldom used as a direct colouring-matter; it is\r\ngenerally produced in the fibre by printing on the mixture of aniline salt\r\nand oxidizing compounds thickened with starch, &c., and then allowing the\r\noxidation to take place spontaneously in a moist and slightly heated\r\natmosphere. By a similar process, using a dye-bath containing the aniline\r\nsalt and oxidizing mixture, cotton fibre is easily dyed. The black cannot\r\nbe used for silk or wool, as the oxidizing materials attack these fibres,\r\nbut for cotton dyeing and calico printing this colouring-matter has come\r\nseriously into competition with the black dyes obtained from logwood and\r\nmadder. The use of aniline for this purpose, first rendered practicable by\r\nLightfoot, is among the most important of the many wonderful applications\r\nof coal-tar products in the tinctorial industry.\r\n\r\nThe year 1863 witnessed the introduction of the first of a new series of\r\ncolouring-matters which have had an enormous influence both on the art of\r\nthe dyer as well as in the utilization of tar-products which were formerly\r\nof but little value. We can consider the history of some of these colours\r\nnow, because the earliest of them was produced from aniline. The formation\r\nof a yellow compound when nitrous acid acts upon aniline was observed by\r\nseveral chemists prior to the date mentioned. In 1863 the firm of Simpson,\r\nMaule and Nicholson manufactured a yellow dye by passing nitrous gas into\r\na solution of aniline in alcohol, and this had a limited application under\r\nthe name of \"aniline yellow.\" Soon afterwards, viz. in 1866, the firm of\r\nRoberts, Dale & Co. of Manchester introduced a brown dye under the name of\r\n\"Manchester brown\"--this compound, which was discovered by Dr. Martius in\r\n1865, having been produced by the action of nitrous acid on one of the\r\ndiamidobenzenes. Ten years later Caro and Witt discovered an orange\r\ncolouring-matter belonging to the same class, and the latter introduced\r\nthe compound into commerce as \"chrysoidine.\" These three compounds are\r\nbasic, and the first of them is no longer used as a direct dye because it\r\nis fugitive. Chrysoidine is still used to a large extent, and the\r\nbrown--now known as \"Bismarck brown\"--is one of the staple products of the\r\ncolour manufacturer at the present time. From this fragment of\r\ntechnological history let us now turn to chemical science.\r\n\r\nThe chemist whose name will always be associated with the compounds of\r\nthis group is the late Dr. Peter Griess of Burton-on-Trent. He commenced\r\nhis study of the action of nitrous acid on organic bases in 1858, and\r\nfrom that time till the period of his death in 1888, he was constantly\r\ncontributing to our knowledge of the resulting compounds. In 1866, he and\r\nDr. Martius established the composition of aniline yellow, and the\r\nfollowing year Caro and Griess did the same thing for the Manchester\r\nbrown. In 1877 Hofmann and Witt established the constitution of\r\nchrysoidine, the final outcome of all this work being to show that the\r\nthree colouring-matters belonged to the same group. The further\r\ndevelopment of these discoveries has been one of the most prolific sources\r\nof new colouring-matters. A brief summary of our present position with\r\nrespect to this group must now be attempted.\r\n\r\nWhen nitrous acid acts upon an amido-derivative of a benzenoid hydrocarbon\r\nin the presence of a mineral acid, there is formed a compound in which the\r\namido-group is replaced by a pair of nitrogen atoms joined together in a\r\ncertain way, which is different to the mode of combination in the azines.\r\nThis pair of nitrogen atoms is combined on the one hand with the\r\nhydrocarbon residue, and on the other with the residue of the mineral\r\nacid. The resulting compound is very unstable; its solution decomposes\r\nvery readily, and generally has to be kept cool by ice. Freezing machines\r\nturning out large quantities of ice are kept constantly at work in\r\nfactories where these produces are made. The latter are known as\r\n\"diazo-compounds\"--Griess's compounds _par excellence_--and they are\r\nprepared on a large scale by dissolving a salt of the amido-base,\r\ngenerally the hydrochloride, in water with ice, and adding sodium nitrite.\r\nThe result is a diazo-salt; aniline, for example, giving diazobenzene\r\nchloride, and toluidine diazotoluene chloride. Similarly all\r\namido-derivatives of a benzenoid character can be \"diazotised.\" The\r\nimportance of this discovery will be seen more fully in the next chapter.\r\nAt present we are more especially concerned with aniline.\r\n\r\nThe extreme instability of the diazo-salts enables them to combine with\r\nthe greatest ease with amido-derivatives and with other compounds. The\r\nvery property which in the early days rendered their investigation so\r\ndifficult, and which taxed the ingenuity of chemists to the utmost, has\r\nnow placed these compounds in the front rank as colour generators. When a\r\ndiazo-salt acts on an amido-derivative there is formed a compound which is\r\nmore or less unstable, but which readily undergoes transformation under\r\nsuitable conditions into a stable substance in which two hydrocarbon\r\nresidues are joined together by the pair of nitrogen atoms. These products\r\nare dye-stuffs, known as \"azo-colours,\" and aniline yellow, Bismarck\r\nbrown, and chrysoidine are the oldest known technical compounds belonging\r\nto the group. The parent substance is \"azobenzene,\" and these three\r\ncolouring-matters are mono-, di- and triamido-azobenzene respectively.\r\n\r\nA new phase in the technology of tar-products was entered upon when Witt\r\ncaused a diazo-salt to act upon diamidobenzene. This was the first\r\nindustrial application of Griess's discovery. Azobenzene, which was\r\ndiscovered by Mitscherlich in 1834, and azotoluene are now manufactured by\r\nreducing nitrobenzene and nitrotoluene with mild reducing agents. These\r\nparent compounds are not in themselves colouring-matters, but they are\r\ntransformed into bases which give rise to a splendid series of azo-dyes,\r\nas will be described subsequently. Let it be recorded here that these two\r\ncompounds are to be added to the list of valuable products obtained from\r\nbenzene and toluene. And it must also be remembered that the introduction\r\nof these azo-colours has necessitated the manufacture on a large scale of\r\nsodium nitrite as a source of nitrous acid. Without entering into\r\nunnecessary detail it may be stated broadly that this salt is made by\r\nfusing Chili saltpetre, which is the nitrate of sodium, with metallic\r\nlead, litharge or oxide of lead being obtained as a secondary product.\r\nThen again, the manufacture of Bismarck brown requires dinitrobenzene,\r\nthis being made by the nitration of benzene beyond the stage of\r\nnitrobenzene. The brown is made by reducing the dinitrobenzene to\r\ndiamidobenzene, and then treating a solution of the latter with sodium\r\nnitrite and an acid. The azo-colour is formed at once, and no special\r\nrefrigeration is required in this particular case.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the old aniline yellow of 1863 is no\r\nlonger used on account of its fugitive character. In 1878 Graessler found\r\nthat by the action of very strong sulphuric acid this azo-compound could\r\nbe converted into a sulpho-acid in just the same way that magenta can be\r\nconverted into acid magenta. Under the name of \"acid yellow\" this\r\nsulpho-acid is now used, not only as a direct yellow colouring-matter, but\r\nas a starting-point in the manufacture of other azo-dyes. The use of acid\r\nyellow for this last purpose will be dealt with again in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThere is one other use for aniline yellow which dates from the year of its\r\ndiscovery, when Dale and Caro found that by adding sodium nitrite to\r\naniline hydrochloride and heating the mixture, a blue colouring-matter is\r\nproduced. The latter was introduced in 1864 under the name of \"induline.\"\r\nIt was shown subsequently by the scientific researches of several chemists\r\nthat the blue produced by Dale and Caro's method results from the action\r\nof the aniline salt on the aniline yellow, which is formed by the action\r\nof the nitrous acid on the aniline and aniline salt. This explanation was\r\nproved to be correct in 1872 by Hofmann and Geyger, who prepared the\r\ncolouring-matter by heating aniline yellow and aniline salt with alcohol\r\nas a solvent. These chemists established the composition and gave it the\r\nname of \"azodiphenyl blue.\" Later, viz. in 1883, the manufacture was\r\nimproved by Otto Witt and E. Thomas, and the dye, under the old name of\r\n\"induline,\" is now largely manufactured by first preparing aniline yellow\r\nand then heating this with aniline and aniline salt. The colouring-matter\r\nas formed by this method is basic and insoluble in water; it is made acid\r\nand soluble by treatment with sulphuric acid, which converts it into a\r\nsulpho-acid. Induline belongs to the sober-tinted colours, and produces a\r\nshade somewhat resembling indigo. Closely related thereto is a bluish-grey\r\ncalled \"nigrosine,\" obtained by heating nitrobenzene with aniline, as well\r\nas a certain bluish by-product obtained during the formation of magenta,\r\nand known as \"violaniline.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient here to pause and reflect upon the great industrial\r\nimportance of the two coal-tar hydrocarbons upon which we have thus far\r\nconcentrated our attention. Their uses are by no means exhausted as yet,\r\nbut they have already been made to account for such a number of valuable\r\nproducts that the reader may find it useful to have the results presented\r\nin a collected form. This is given below as a chronological summary--\r\n\r\n  1856. Mauve discovered by Perkin; leading to manufacture of aniline.\r\n\r\n  1860.

The colouring\r\nmatter is found in a number of leguminous (see Fig. 7), cruciferous, and\r\nother plants, some of which are largely cultivated in India, China, the\r\nMalay Archipelago, South America, and the West Indies; while others, such\r\nas woad (see Fig. 8), are grown in more temperate European climates. The\r\ntinctorial value of these plants was known in India and Egypt long before\r\nthe Christian era. Egyptian mummy-cloths have been found dyed with indigo.\r\nThe dye was known to the Greeks and Romans; its use is described by the\r\nyounger Pliny in his Natural History. Indigo was introduced into Europe\r\nabout the sixteenth century, but its use was strongly opposed by the woad\r\ncultivators, with whose industry the dye came into competition. In France\r\nthe opposition was strong enough to secure the passing of an act in the\r\ntime of Henry IV. inflicting the penalty of death upon any person found\r\nusing the dye. The importance of indigo as an article of commerce is\r\nsufficiently known at the present time; more than 8000 tons are produced\r\nannually, corresponding in money value to about four million pounds. It is\r\nof importance to us as rulers of India to remember that the cultivation\r\nand manufacture of indigo is one of the staple industries of that country,\r\nfrom which the European markets derive the greater part of their supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--INDIGO PLANT (_Indigofera tinctoria_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine the industrial revolution which would be caused by the discovery\r\nof a process for obtaining indigo synthetically from a coal-tar\r\nhydrocarbon, at a price which would compare favourably with that of the\r\nnatural product. This has not actually been done as yet, but chemists have\r\nattempted to compete with Nature in this direction, and the present state\r\nof the competition is that the natural product can be cultivated and made\r\nmore cheaply. Nevertheless the dye can be synthesised from a coal-tar\r\nhydrocarbon, and this is one of the greatest achievements of modern\r\nchemistry in connection with the tar-products. For more than half a\r\ncentury indigo had been undergoing investigation by chemists, and at\r\nlength the work culminated in the discovery of a method for producing it\r\nartificially. This discovery was the outcome of the labour of Adolf v.\r\nBaeyer, who commenced his researches upon the derivatives of indigo in\r\n1866, and who in 1880 secured the first patents for the manufacture of the\r\ncolouring-matter. It is to the laborious and brilliant investigations of\r\nthis chemist that we owe nearly all that is at present known about the\r\nchemistry of indigo and allied compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--WOAD (_Isatis tinctoria_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo methods have been used for the production of artificial indigo--benzal\r\nchloride being the starting-point in one of these, and nitrobenzoic\r\naldehyde in the other. The generating hydrocarbon is therefore toluene. By\r\nheating benzal chloride with dry sodium acetate there is formed an acid\r\nknown as cinnamic acid, a fragrant compound which derives its name from\r\ncinnamon, because the acid was prepared by the oxidation of oil of\r\ncinnamon by Dumas and Peligot in 1834. The acid and its ethers occur also\r\nin many balsams, so that we have here another instance of the synthesis of\r\na natural vegetable product from a coal-tar hydrocarbon. The subsequent\r\nsteps are--(1) the nitration of the acid to produce nitrocinnamic acid;\r\n(2) the addition of bromine to form a dibromide of the nitro-acid; (3) the\r\naction of alkali on the dibromide to produce what is known as \"propiolic\r\nacid.\" The latter, under the influence of mild alkaline reducing agents,\r\nis transformed into indigo-blue. The process depending on the use of\r\nnitrobenzoic aldehyde is much simpler; but the particular nitro-derivative\r\nof the aldehyde which is required is at present difficult to make, and\r\ntherefore expensive. If the production of this compound could be\r\ncheapened, the competition between artificial and natural indigo would\r\nassume a much more serious aspect.[5]\r\n\r\nThe light oil of the tar-distiller has now been sufficiently dealt with so\r\nfar as regards colouring-matters; let us pass on to the next fraction of\r\nthe tar, the carbolic oil. The important constituents of this portion are\r\ncarbolic acid and naphthalene. The carbolic oil is in the first place\r\nseparated into two distinct portions by washing with an alkaline solution.\r\nCarbolic acid or phenol belongs to a class of compounds derived from\r\nhydrocarbons of the benzene and related series by the substitution of the\r\nresidue of water for hydrogen. This water-residue is known to chemists as\r\n\"hydroxyl\"--it is water less one atom of hydrogen. Carbolic acid or phenol\r\nis hydroxybenzene; and all analogous compounds are spoken of as \"phenols.\"\r\nIt will be understood in future that a phenol is a hydroxy-derivative of a\r\nbenzenoid hydrocarbon. Now these phenols are all more or less acid in\r\ncharacter by virtue of the hydroxyl-group which they contain. For this\r\nreason they dissolve in aqueous alkaline solutions, and are precipitated\r\ntherefrom by acids. This will enable us to understand the purification of\r\nthe carbolic oil.\r\n\r\nThe two layers into which this oil separates after washing with alkali are\r\n(1) the aqueous alkaline solution of the carbolic acid and other phenols,\r\nand (2) the undissolved naphthalene contaminated with oily hydrocarbons\r\nand other impurities. Each of these portions has its industrial history.\r\nThe alkaline solution, on being drawn off and made acid, yields its\r\nmixture of phenols in the form of a dark oil from which carbolic acid is\r\nseparated by a laborious series of fractional distillations. The\r\nundissolved hydrocarbon is similarly purified by fractional distillation,\r\nand furnishes the solid crystalline naphthalene. The tar from one ton of\r\nLancashire coal yields about 1-1/2 lbs. of carbolic acid, equal to about 1\r\nper cent. by weight of the tar, and about 6-1/4lbs. of naphthalene, so\r\nthat this last hydrocarbon is one of the chief constituents of the tar, of\r\nwhich it forms from 8 to 10 per cent. by weight.\r\n\r\nThe crude carbolic acid as separated from the alkaline solution is a\r\nmixture of several phenolic compounds, and all of these but the carbolic\r\nacid itself are gradually removed during the process of purification.\r\nAmong the compounds associated with the carbolic acid are certain phenols\r\nof higher boiling-point, which bear the same relationship to carbolic acid\r\nthat toluene bears to benzene. That is to say, that while phenol itself\r\nis hydroxybenzene, these other compounds, which are called \"cresols,\" are\r\nhydroxytoluenes. The cresols form an oily liquid largely used for\r\ndisinfecting purposes under the designation of \"liquid carbolic acid,\" or\r\n\"cresylic acid.\" Carbolic acid is a white crystalline solid possessing\r\nstrongly antiseptic properties, and is therefore of immense value in all\r\ncases where putrefaction or decay has to be arrested. It was discovered in\r\ncoal-tar by Runge in 1834, and was obtained pure by Laurent in 1840.\r\n\r\nThe gradual establishment of the germ-theory of disease, chiefly due to\r\nthe labours of Pasteur, has led to a most important application of\r\ncarbolic acid. Once again we find the coal-tar industry brought into\r\ncontact with another department of science. Arguing from the view that\r\nputrefactive change is brought about by the presence of the germs of\r\nmicro-organisms ever present in the atmosphere, Sir Joseph Lister proposed\r\nthat during surgical operations the incised part should be kept under a\r\nspray of the germicidal carbolic acid to prevent subsequent mortification.\r\nNo operation upon portions of the body exposed to the air is at present\r\nconducted without this precaution, and many a human life must have been\r\nsaved by Lister's treatment. To this result the chemist and technologist\r\nhave contributed, not only by the discovery of the carbolic acid in the\r\ntar, but also by the development of the necessary processes for its\r\npurification. It should be added that the phenol used must be of the\r\ngreatest possible purity, and the requirements of the surgeon have been\r\nmet by chemical and technological skill.\r\n\r\nFrom surgery back to colouring-matters, and from these to pharmaceutical\r\npreparations and perfumes, are we led in following up the cycles of\r\nchemical transformation which these tar-products have undergone in the\r\nhands of the technologist, guided by the researches of the chemist. It was\r\nobserved by Runge in 1834 that crude carbolic acid, on treatment with\r\nlime, gave a red, acid colouring-matter which he separated and named\r\n\"rosolic acid.\" The observation was followed up, and many other chemists\r\nobtained red colouring-matters by the oxidation of crude phenol. In 1859,\r\nthe colour-giving property of carbolic acid acquired industrial importance\r\nfrom a discovery made by Kolbe and Schmitt in Germany, and by Persoz in\r\nFrance. These chemists found that a good yield of the colouring-matter was\r\nobtained by heating phenol with oxalic and sulphuric acids. Under the\r\nnames of \"corallin\" and \"aurin\" the dye-stuff was introduced into\r\ncommerce, and it is still used for certain purposes, especially for the\r\npreparation of coloured lakes for paper-staining.\r\n\r\nThe scientific development of the history of this phenol dye is full of\r\ninterest, but we can only give it a passing glance. Its interest lies\r\nchiefly in the circumstance that it is related to magenta, as was first\r\npointed out by Caro and Wanklyn in 1866. In fact they obtained rosolic\r\nacid from magenta by the action of nitrous acid on the latter. We now know\r\nthat a diazo-salt is first formed under these circumstances, and that the\r\ndecomposition of this unstable compound in the presence of water gives\r\nrise to the rosolic acid. Later researches have shown that by heating\r\nrosolic acid with ammonia it is converted into rosaniline. It is also\r\nknown that the commercial corallin, like the commercial magenta, is a\r\nmixture of closely related colouring-matters. The close analogy between\r\nmagenta and rosolic acid was further shown by Caro in 1866. In the same\r\nway that Hofmann found that magenta could not be produced by the oxidation\r\nof _pure_ aniline, Caro found that a mixture of phenol and cresol was\r\nnecessary for the production of rosolic acid when inorganic oxidizers were\r\nused. It is indeed this series of investigations upon the phenol\r\ndyes--investigations which have been taken part in not only by the\r\nchemists named, but also by Graebe, Dale and Schorlemmer, and the\r\nFischers--which led up to the discovery of the constitution of the\r\ncolouring-matters of the rosaniline group, and, through this, to the\r\nfar-reaching industrial developments of the discovery as traced in the\r\nlast chapter. It is evident, from what has been said, that rosolic acid\r\nand its related colouring-matters are members of the triphenylmethane\r\ngroup. They are in fact the hydroxylic or acid analogues of the\r\namido-containing or basic dyes of the rosaniline series.\r\n\r\nIn the fragrant blossom of the meadowsweet (_Spiraea ulmaria_) there is\r\ncontained an acid which is found also as an ether in the oil of\r\nwintergreen (_Gautheria procumbens_). This is salicylic acid, a white\r\ncrystalline compound which has been known to chemists since 1839. In 1860\r\nKolbe prepared the sodium salt of this acid by passing carbon dioxide gas\r\ninto phenol in which metallic sodium had been dissolved. It was found\r\nsubsequently that the same transformation was brought about by heating the\r\ndry sodium salt of carbolic acid in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. This\r\nprocess of Kolbe's is now worked on a manufacturing scale for the\r\npreparation of artificial salicylic acid. The acid and its salts and\r\nethers find numerous applications as antiseptics, for the preservation of\r\nfood, and in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid is employed also for the manufacture of certain azo-dyes in\r\na way that it will be very instructive to consider, because the process\r\nused may be taken as typical of the general method of preparing such\r\ncompounds. Solutions of diazo-salts act not only upon amido- and\r\ndiamido-compounds, as we have seen in the case of aniline yellow and\r\nchrysoidine, but also upon phenols, forming acid azo-colours. This\r\nimportant fact was made known in 1870 by the German chemists Kekule and\r\nHidegh, but more than six years elapsed before this discovery was taken\r\nadvantage of by the technologist. Large numbers of these acid azo-dyes are\r\nnow made from various diazotised amido-compounds combined with different\r\nphenols and phenolic acids. The mode of procedure is to diazotise the\r\namido-compound by sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid in the manner\r\nalready described, and then add the diazo-salt solution to the phenolic\r\ncompound dissolved in alkali. The colouring-matter is at once formed.\r\nSalicylic acid possesses the characters both of an acid and a phenol. It\r\ncombines readily with diazo-salts under the circumstances described, and\r\ngives rise to azo-dyes, some of which are of technical value.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of azo-dyes from salicylic acid brings us into contact\r\nwith certain amidic compounds which figure so largely in the tinctorial\r\nindustry that they may be conveniently dealt with here. These bases are\r\nnot azo-compounds themselves, but they are prepared from azo-compounds,\r\nviz. from the azobenzene and azotoluene which were spoken about in the\r\nlast chapter. When these are reduced by acid reducing-agents, they become\r\nconverted into diamido-bases which are known as benzidine and tolidine\r\nrespectively. These bases can be diazotised, and as they contain two\r\namido-groups, they form double diazo-salts, _i.e._ tetrazo-salts, which\r\nare capable of combining with amido-compounds, or phenols, in the usual\r\nway. Thus diazotised benzidine and tolidine combine with salicylic acid to\r\nform valuable yellow azo-dyes known as \"chrysamines.\" The dyes of this\r\nclass obviously contain two azo-groups.\r\n\r\nSome other uses of carbolic acid must next be considered. Of the\r\ncolouring-matters derived from coal-tar, none is more widely known than\r\nthe oldest artificial yellow dye, picric acid. This is a phenol\r\nderivative, and was first obtained as long ago as 1771 by Woulfe, by\r\nacting upon indigo with nitric acid. Laurent in 1842 was the first to\r\nobtain this dye from carbolic acid, from which compound it is still\r\nmanufactured by acting upon the sulpho-acid with nitric acid. Chemically\r\nconsidered, it is trinitrophenol. It has a very wide application as a dye,\r\nand has been used as an explosive agent. A similar colouring-matter was\r\nmade from cresol in 1869, and introduced under the name of \"Victoria\r\nyellow,\" which is dinitro-cresol. Other dyes derived directly or\r\nindirectly from phenol will take us back once again to toluene.\r\n\r\nA new diazotisable diamido-compound was obtained from this last\r\nhydrocarbon, and introduced in 1886 by Leonhardt & Co. One of the three\r\nisomeric nitrotoluenes furnishes a sulpho-acid which, on treatment with\r\nalkali, gives a compound derived from a hydrocarbon known as stilbene, and\r\nthis, on reduction, is converted into the diamido-compound referred to.\r\nThe latter, which is a disulpho-acid as well as a diamido-compound, can be\r\ndiazotised and combined with phenols, &c. The stilbene azo-dyes thus\r\nprepared from phenol and salicylic acid, like the chrysamines, are yellow\r\ncolouring-matters, containing two azo-groups. It is a valuable\r\ncharacteristic of these secondary azo-dyes that they all possess a special\r\naffinity for vegetable fibre, and their introduction has exerted a great\r\ninfluence upon the art of cotton-dyeing. We shall have to return to these\r\ncotton-dyes again shortly.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject, the following scheme is\r\npresented to show the relationships and inter-relationships of the\r\nproducts thus far dealt with in the present chapter--\r\n\r\n                                    Tar\r\n                                     |\r\n         ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |                                                       |\r\n     Light Oil                                              Carbolic Oil\r\n      /       \\           /-> Benzal Chloride                    |\r\n     /         \\         /          |         \\                  |\r\n    /           \\       /           |          Benzaldehyde      |\r\n   /             \\     /       Cinnamic acid        |            |\r\n  Benzene       Toluene             |        Nitrobenzaldehyde   |\r\n     |              |      Nitrocinnamic acid    (+ acetone)     |\r\n     |              |               |            /               |\r\n     |              |               |           /    |-----------|\r\n  Nitrobenzene  Nitrotoluene   Propiolic acid  /     |           |\r\n     |              |     \\         |         /    Phenols   Naphthalene\r\n     |              |      \\        |        /       |   \\\r\n     |              |       \\       |       /        |    \\\r\n     |              |        \\      |      /         |     ->Cresols\r\n  Azobenzene    Azotoluene    \\  Indigo<--/        Phenol        |\r\n     |              |      Stilbene-                 |          Victoria\r\n     |              |      derivative   <-------------------     yellow\r\n     |              |      (Diazotised)\\             |      \\\r\n  Benzidine    Tolidine                Salicylic  Picric   Corallin\r\n        \\       /                       acid      acid     & Aurin\r\n      (Diazotised)                        \\/\r\n           --------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe existence of naphthalene in coal-tar was made known in 1820 by Garden,\r\nwho gave it this name because the oils obtained from the tar by\r\ndistillation went under the general designation of naphtha. The greater\r\nportion of the hydrocarbon is contained in the carbolic oil, and is\r\nseparated and purified in the manner described. A further quantity of\r\nimpure naphthalene separates out from the next fraction--the creosote oil,\r\nand this is similarly washed and purified by distillation. The large\r\nquantity of naphthalene existing in tar has already been referred to, but\r\nalthough it is such an important constituent, it was only late in the\r\nhistory of the colour industry that it found any extensive application. In\r\nearly times it was regarded as a nuisance, and was burnt as fuel, or for\r\nthe production of a dense soot, which was condensed to form lampblack. It\r\nwill be remembered that the first of the coal-tar colours made required\r\nonly the light oils. There are at present only a few direct uses for\r\nnaphthalene, but one of its applications is sufficiently important to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe hydrocarbon is a white crystalline solid melting at 80 deg. C., and\r\nboiling at 217 deg. C. Although it has a high boiling-point, it passes readily\r\ninto vapour at lower temperatures, and the vapour on condensation forms\r\nbeautiful silvery crystalline scales. This product is \"sublimed\r\nnaphthalene.\" The vapour of naphthalene burns with a highly luminous\r\nflame, and if mixed with coal-gas, it considerably increases the\r\nluminosity of the flame. Advantage is taken-of this in the so-called\r\n\"albo-carbon light,\" which is the flame of burning coal-gas saturated with\r\nnaphthalene vapour. The burner is constructed so that the gas passes\r\nthrough a reservoir filled with melted naphthalene kept hot by the flame\r\nitself (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--ALBO-CARBON BURNER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo appreciate properly the value of those discoveries which have enabled\r\nmanufacturers to utilize this hydrocarbon, it is only necessary to recall\r\nto mind the actual quantity produced in this country. Supposing that ten\r\nmillion tons of coal are used annually for gas-making, and that the\r\n500,000 tons of tar resulting therefrom contain only eight per cent. of\r\nnaphthalene, there would be available about 40,000 tons of this\r\nhydrocarbon annually. Great as have been the recent advancements in the\r\nutilization of naphthalene derivatives, there is still a larger quantity\r\nof this hydrocarbon produced than is necessary to supply the wants of the\r\ncolour-manufacturer. From this last statement it will be inferred that\r\nnaphthalene is now a source of colouring-matters. Let us consider how this\r\nhas been brought about.\r\n\r\nThe phenols of naphthalene are called naphthols--they bear the same\r\nrelationship to naphthalene that carbolic acid bears to benzene. Owing to\r\nthe structure of the naphthalene molecule there are two isomeric\r\nnaphthols, whereas there is only one phenol. The naphthols--known as\r\nalpha- and beta-naphthol, respectively--are now made on a large scale from\r\nnaphthalene, by heating the latter with sulphuric acid; at a low\r\ntemperature the alpha sulpho-acid is produced, and at a higher temperature\r\nthe beta sulpho-acid, and these acids on fusion with caustic soda furnish\r\nthe corresponding naphthols. Similarly there are two amidonaphthalenes,\r\nknown as alpha- and beta-naphthylamine respectively. As aniline is to\r\nbenzene, so are the naphthylamines to naphthalene. The alpha-compound is\r\nmade in precisely the same way as aniline, viz. by acting upon naphthalene\r\nwith nitric acid so as to form nitronaphthalene, and then reducing the\r\nlatter with iron dust and acid. Beta-napthylamine cannot be made in this\r\nway; it is prepared from beta-naphthol by heating the latter in presence\r\nof ammonia, when the hydroxyl becomes replaced by the amido-group in\r\naccordance with a process patented in 1880 by the Baden Aniline Company.\r\nThe principle thus utilized is the outcome of the scientific work of two\r\nAustrian chemists, Merz and Weith. Setting out from the naphthols and\r\nnaphthylamines we shall be led into industrial developments of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nThe first naphthalene colour was a yellow dye, discovered by Martius in\r\n1864, and manufactured under the name of \"Manchester yellow.\" It is,\r\nchemically speaking, dinitro-alpha-naphthol; but it was not at first made\r\nfrom naphthol, as the latter was not at the time a technical product. It\r\nwas made from alpha-naphthylamine by the action of nitrous and nitric\r\nacids. When a good method for making the naphthol was discovered in 1869,\r\nthe dye was made from this. The process is just the same as that employed\r\nin making picric acid; the naphthol is converted into a sulpho-acid, and\r\nthis when acted upon by nitric acid, gives the colouring-matter.\r\nManchester yellow is now largely used for colouring soap, but as a\r\ndye-stuff it has been improved upon in a manner that will be readily\r\nunderstood. The original colouring-matter being somewhat fugitive, it was\r\nfound that its sulpho-acid was much faster. This sulpho-acid cannot be\r\nmade by the direct action of sulphuric acid upon the colouring-matter--as\r\nin the case of acid yellow or acid magenta--but by acting upon the\r\nnaphthol with very strong sulphuric acid, three sulphuric acid residues or\r\nsulpho-groups enter the molecule, and then on nitration only two of these\r\nare replaced by nitro-groups, and there results a sulpho-acid of\r\ndinitro-alpha-naphthol. This was discovered in 1879 by Caro, and\r\nintroduced as \"acid naphthol yellow.\" It is now one of the standard yellow\r\ndyes.\r\n\r\nThe history of another important group of colouring-matters dependent on\r\nnaphthalene begins with A. v. Baeyer in 1871 and with Caro in 1874. Two\r\nproducts formerly known only as laboratory preparations were called into\r\nrequisition by this discovery. One of these compounds, phthalic acid, is\r\nobtained from naphthalene, and the other, resorcin or resorcinol, is\r\nprepared from benzene. Phthalic acid, which was discovered in 1836 by\r\nLaurent, is a product of the oxidation of many benzenoid compounds.\r\nChemically considered it is a di-derivative of benzene, _i.e._ two of the\r\nhydrogen atoms of benzene are replaced by certain groups of carbon,\r\noxygen, and hydrogen atoms. We have seen how the replacement of hydrogen\r\nby an ammonia-residue, amidogen, gives rise to bases such as amidobenzene\r\n(aniline), or diamidobenzene. Similarly, the replacement of hydrogen by a\r\nwater-residue, hydroxyl, gives rise to a phenol. The group of carbon,\r\noxygen, and hydrogen atoms which confers the property of acidity upon an\r\norganic compound is a half-molecule of oxalic acid--it is known as the\r\ncarboxyl group. Thus benzoic acid is the carboxyl-derivative of benzene,\r\nand the phthalic acid with which we are now concerned is a\r\ndicarboxyl-derivative of benzene. It is related to benzoic acid in the\r\nsame way that diamidobenzene is related to aniline. Three isomeric\r\nphthalic acids are known, but only one of these is of use in the present\r\nbranch of manufacture. The acid in question, although a derivative of\r\nbenzene, is most economically prepared by the oxidation of certain\r\nderivatives of naphthalene which, when completely broken down by energetic\r\noxidizing agents, furnish the acid. Thus the dinitronaphthol described as\r\nManchester yellow, if heated for some time with dilute nitric acid,\r\nfurnishes phthalic acid. The latter is made on a large scale by the\r\noxidation of a compound which naphthalene forms with chlorine, and known\r\nas naphthalene tetrachloride, because it contains four atoms of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe other compound, resorcinol, was known to chemistry ten years before it\r\nwas utilized as a source of colouring-matters. It was originally prepared\r\nby fusing certain resins, such as galbanum, asafoetida, &c., with\r\ncaustic alkali. Soon after its discovery, viz. in 1866, it was shown by\r\nKoerner to be a derivative of benzene, and from this hint the technical\r\nprocess for the preparation of the compound on a large scale has been\r\ndeveloped. Resorcinol is a phenolic derivative of benzene containing two\r\nhydroxyl groups; it is therefore related to phenol in the same way that\r\ndiamidobenzene is related to aniline or phthalic acid to benzoic acid. The\r\nrelationships can be expressed in a tabular form thus--\r\n\r\n  Amidobenzene or Aniline.    Benzoic acid.    Carbolic acid or Phenol.\r\n  Diamidobenzene.             Phthalic acid.   Resorcinol.\r\n\r\nResorcinol is now made by heating benzene with very strong sulphuric acid\r\nso as to convert it into a disulpho-acid, and the sodium salt of the\r\nlatter is then fused with alkali. As a technical operation it is one of\r\ngreat delicacy and skill, and the manufacture is confined to a few\r\nContinental factories.\r\n\r\nWhen phthalic acid is heated it loses water, and is transformed into a\r\nwhite, magnificently crystalline substance known as phthalic anhydride,\r\n_i.e._ the acid deprived of water. In 1871, A. v. Baeyer, the eminent\r\nchemist who subsequently synthesised indigo, published the first of a\r\nseries of investigations describing the compounds produced by heating\r\nphthalic anhydride with phenols. To these compounds he gave the name of\r\n\"phthaleins.\" Baeyer's work, like that of so many other chemists who have\r\ncontributed to the advancement of the coal-tar colour industry, was of a\r\npurely scientific character at first, but it soon led to technological\r\ndevelopments. The phthaleins are all acid compounds possessing more or\r\nless tinctorial power. One of the first discovered was produced by heating\r\nphthalic anhydride with an acid known as gallic acid, which occurs in\r\nvegetable galls, and in the form of tannin in many vegetable extracts\r\nwhich are used by the tanner. The acid is a phenolic derivative of benzoic\r\nacid, viz. trihydroxybenzoic acid, and on heating it readily passes into\r\ntrihydroxybenzene, which is the \"pyrogallic acid\" or pyrogallol familiar\r\nas a photographic developer. The phthalein formed from gallic acid and\r\nphthalic anhydride really results from the union of the latter with\r\npyrogallol. It is now manufactured under the name of \"gallein,\" and is\r\nlargely used for imparting a bluish grey shade to cotton fabrics. By\r\nheating gallein with strong sulphuric acid, it is transformed into another\r\ncolouring-matter which gives remarkably fast olive-green shades when dyed\r\non cotton fibre with a suitable mordant. This derivative of gallein is\r\nused to a considerable extent under the name of \"coerulein.\" These two\r\ncolouring-matters were the first practical outcome of v. Baeyer's\r\nresearches. There is another possible development in this direction which\r\nchemistry may yet accomplish, and another natural colouring-matter may be\r\nthreatened, even as the indigo culture was threatened by the later work of\r\nthe same chemist. There is reason for believing that the colouring-matter\r\nof logwood, known to chemists as haematein, is related to or derived in\r\nsome way from the phthaleins, and the synthesis of this compound may\r\nultimately be effected.\r\n\r\nThe dye introduced by Caro in 1874 is the brominated phthalein of\r\nresorcinol. The phthalein itself is a yellow dye, and the solutions of its\r\nsalts show a splendid and most intense greenish yellow fluorescence, for\r\nwhich reason it is called \"fluorescein.\" When brominated, the latter\r\nfurnishes a beautiful red colouring-matter known as \"eosin\" (Gr. [Greek:\r\neos], dawn), and the introduction of this gave an industrial impetus to\r\nthe phthaleins which led to the discovery of many other related\r\ncolouring-matters now largely used under various trade designations.\r\nAbout a dozen distinct compounds producing different shades of pink,\r\ncrimson and red, and all derived from fluorescein, are at present in the\r\nmarket, and a few other phthaleins formed by heating phthalic anhydride\r\nwith other phenolic compounds instead of resorcinol or pyrogallol (_e.g._\r\ndiethylamidophenol), are also of industrial importance. By converting\r\nnitrobenzene into a sulpho-acid, reducing to an amido-sulpho-acid, and\r\nthen fusing with alkali, an amido-phenol is produced, the ethers of which,\r\nwhen heated with phthalic anhydride, give rise to red phthaleins of most\r\nintense colouring power introduced by the Baden Aniline Company as\r\n\"rhodamines.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains to point out that the scientific spirit which prompted the\r\ninvestigation of the phthaleins in the first instance has followed these\r\ncompounds throughout their technological career. The researches started by\r\nv. Baeyer were taken up by various chemists, whose work together with that\r\nof the original discoverer has led to the elucidation of the constitution\r\nof these colouring-matters. The phthaleins are members of the\r\ntriphenylmethane group, and are therefore related to magenta, corallin,\r\nmalachite green, methyl violet, and the phosgene dyes.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the phenolic and amidic derivatives of naphthalene,\r\n_i.e._ the naphthols and naphthylamines, are of the greatest importance to\r\nthe colour industry. One of the first uses of alpha-naphthylamine has\r\nalready been mentioned, viz. for the production of the Manchester yellow,\r\nwhich was afterwards made more advantageously from alpha-naphthol. A red\r\ncolouring-matter possessing a beautiful fluorescence was afterwards (1869)\r\nmade from this naphthylamine and introduced as \"Magdala red.\" The latter\r\nwas discovered by Schiendl of Vienna in 1867. It was prepared in precisely\r\nthe same way as induline was prepared from aniline yellow. The latter,\r\nwhich is amido-azobenzene, and which is prepared, broadly speaking, by the\r\naction of nitrous acid on aniline, has its analogue in\r\namido-azonaphthalene, which is similarly prepared by the action of nitrous\r\nacid on naphthylamine. Just as aniline yellow when heated with aniline and\r\nan aniline salt gives induline, so amido-azonaphthalene when heated with\r\nnaphthylamine and a salt of this base gives Magdala red. The latter is,\r\ntherefore, a naphthalene analogue of induline, as was shown by Hofmann in\r\n1869, and the knowledge of the constitution of the azines which has been\r\ngained of late years, enables us to relegate the colouring-matter to this\r\ngroup. This knowledge has also enabled the manufacture to be conducted on\r\nmore rational principles, viz. by the method employed for the production\r\nof the saffranines, as previously sketched.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of azo-dyes, formed by the action of a diazotised\r\namido-compound on a phenol or another amido-compound, marks the period\r\nfrom which the naphthols and naphthylamines rose to the first rank of\r\nimportance as raw materials for the colour manufacturer. The introduction\r\nof chrysoidine in 1876 was immediately followed by the manufacture of acid\r\nazo-dyes obtained by combining diazotised amido-sulpho-acids with phenols\r\nof various kinds, or with bases, such as dimethylaniline and\r\ndiphenylamine. From what has been said in the foregoing portion of this\r\nvolume, it is evident that all such azo-compounds result from the\r\ncombination of two things, viz. (1) a diazotised amido-compound, and (2) a\r\nphenolic or amidic compound. Either (1) or (2) or both may be a\r\nsulpho-acid, and the resulting dye will then also be a sulpho-acid.\r\n\r\nThe first of these colouring-matters derived from the naphthols, was\r\nintroduced in 1876-77 by Roussin and Poirrier, and by O. N. Witt. They\r\nwere prepared by converting aniline into a sulpho-acid (sulphanilic acid),\r\ndiazotising this and combining the diazo-compound with alpha- or\r\nbeta-naphthol. The compounds formed are brilliant orange dyes, the latter\r\nbeing still largely consumed as \"naphthol orange.\" Other dye-stuffs of a\r\nsimilar nature were introduced by Caro about the same time, and were\r\nprepared from the diazotised sulpho-acid of alpha-naphthylamine combined\r\nwith the naphthols. By this means alpha-naphthol gives what is known as\r\n\"acid brown,\" or \"fast brown,\" and beta-naphthol a fine crimson, known as\r\n\"fast red,\" or \"roccellin.\" Diazotised compounds combine also with this\r\nsame sulpho-acid of alpha-naphthylamine (known as naphthionic acid), the\r\nfirst colouring-matter formed in this way having been introduced by\r\nRoussin and Poirrier in 1878. It was prepared by diazotising a\r\nnitro-derivative of aniline, and acting with the diazo-salt on napthionic\r\nacid, and this dye is still used to some extent under the name of \"archil\r\nsubstitute.\" In 1878, the firm of Meister, Lucius & Bruening of\r\nHoechst-on-the-Main gave a further impetus to the utilization of\r\nnaphthalene by discovering two isomeric disulpho-acids of beta-naphthol\r\nformed by heating that phenol with sulphuric acid. By combining various\r\ndiazotised bases with these sulpho-acids, a splendid series of acid\r\nazo-dyes ranging in shade from bright orange to claret-red, and to\r\nscarlets rivalling cochineal in brilliancy were given to the tinctorial\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe colouring-matters introduced in 1878 by the Hoechst factory under the\r\nnames of \"Ponceaux\" of various brands, and \"Bordeaux,\" although to some\r\nextent superseded by later discoveries, still occupy an important\r\nposition. Their discovery not only increased the consumption of\r\nbeta-naphthol, but also that of the bases which were used for diazotising.\r\nThese bases are alpha-naphthylamine and those of the aniline series. The\r\nintimate relationship which exists between chemical science and\r\ntechnology--a relationship which appears so constantly in the foregoing\r\nportions of this work--is well brought out by the discovery under\r\nconsideration. A little more chemistry will enable this statement to be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nGoing back for a moment to the hydrocarbons obtained from light oil, it\r\nwill be remembered that benzene and toluene have thus far been considered\r\nas the only ones of importance to the colour-maker. Until the discovery\r\nembodied in the patent specification of 1878, the portions of the light\r\noil boiling above toluene were of no value in the colour industry. Benzene\r\nand toluene are related to each other in a way which chemists describe by\r\nsaying that they are \"homologous.\" This means that they are members of a\r\nregularly graduated series, the successive terms of which differ by the\r\nsame number of atoms of carbon and hydrogen. Thus toluene contains one\r\natom of carbon and two atoms of hydrogen more than benzene. Above toluene\r\nare higher homologues, viz. xylene, cumene, &c., which occur in the light\r\noil, the former being related to toluene in the same way that toluene is\r\nrelated to benzene, while cumene again contains one atom of carbon and two\r\natoms of hydrogen more than xylene. This relationship between the members\r\nof homologous series is expressed in other terms by saying that the weight\r\nof the molecule increases by a constant quantity as we ascend the series.\r\n\r\nThe homology existing among the hydrocarbons extends to all their\r\nderivatives. Thus phenol is the lower homologue of the cresols. Also we\r\nhave the homologous series--\r\n\r\n  Benzene.      Nitrobenzene.      Aniline.\r\n  Toluene.      Nitrotoluene.      Toluidine.\r\n  Xylene.       Nitroxylene.       Xylidine.\r\n  Cumene.       Nitrocumene.       Cumidine.\r\n\r\nThe bases of the third column when diazotised and combined with the\r\ndisulpho-acids of beta-naphthol give a graduated series of dyes beginning\r\nwith orange and ending with bluish scarlet. Thus it was observed that the\r\ntoluidine colour was redder than the aniline colour, and it was a natural\r\ninference that the xylidine colour would be still redder. At the time of\r\nthis discovery no azo-colour of a true scarlet shade had been manufactured\r\nsuccessfully. A demand for the higher homologues of benzene was thus\r\ncreated, and the higher boiling-point fractions of the light oil, which\r\nhad been formerly used as solvent naphtha, became of value as sources of\r\ncolouring-matters. The isolation of coal-tar xylene (which is a mixture of\r\nthree isomeric hydrocarbons) is easily effected by fractional distillation\r\nwith a rectifying column, and by nitration and reduction, in the same way\r\nas in the manufacture of aniline, xylidine is placed at the disposal of\r\nthe colour-maker.\r\n\r\nXylidine scarlet, although at the time of its introduction the only true\r\nazo-scarlet likely to come into competition with cochineal, was still\r\nsomewhat on the orange side. The cumidine dye would obviously be nearer\r\nthe desired shade. To meet this want, cumidine had to be made on a large\r\nscale, but here practical difficulties interposed themselves. The quantity\r\nof cumene in the light oil is but small, and it is associated with other\r\nhydrocarbons which are impurities from the present point of view, and from\r\nwhich it is separated only with difficulty. A new source of the base had\r\ntherefore to be sought, and here again we find chemical science\r\nministering to the wants of the technologist.\r\n\r\nIt was explained in the last chapter that aniline and similar bases can be\r\nmethylated by heating their dry salts with methyl alcohol under pressure.\r\nIn this way dimethylaniline is made, and dimethyltoluidine or\r\ndimethylxylidine can similarly be prepared. Now it was shown by Hofmann in\r\n1871, that if this operation is conducted at a very high temperature, and\r\nunder very great pressure, the methyl-alcohol residue, _i.e._ the\r\nmethyl-group, does not replace the amidic hydrogen or the hydrogen of the\r\nammonia residue, but the methylation takes place in another way, resulting\r\nin the formation of a higher homologue of the base started with. For\r\nexample, by heating aniline salt and pure wood-spirit to a temperature\r\nconsiderably above that necessary for producing dimethylaniline, toluidine\r\nis formed. In a similar way, by heating xylidine hydrochloride and methyl\r\nalcohol for some time in a closed vessel at about 300 deg. C. cumidine is\r\nproduced. Hofmann's discovery was thus utilized in 1882, and by its means\r\nthe base was manufactured, and cumidine scarlet, very similar in shade to\r\ncochineal, became an article of commerce.\r\n\r\nWhile the development of this branch of the colour industry was taking\r\nplace by means of the new naphthol disulpho-acids, the cultivation of the\r\nfertile field of the azo-dyes was being carried on in other directions. It\r\ncame to be realized that the fundamental discovery of Griess was capable\r\nof being extended to all kinds of amido-compounds. The azo-dyes hitherto\r\nintroduced had all been derived from amido-compounds containing only one\r\namido-group, and they accordingly contained only one azo-group; they were\r\n_primary_ azo-compounds. It was soon found that aniline yellow, which\r\nalready contains one azo-group as well as an amido-group, could be again\r\ndiazotised and combined with phenols so as to produce compounds containing\r\ntwo azo-groups, _i.e._ _secondary_ azo-compounds. The sulpho-acid of\r\naniline yellow--Graessler's \"acid yellow\"--was the first source of azo-dyes\r\nof this class. By diazotising this amidoazo-sulpho-acid, and combining it\r\nwith beta-naphthol, a fine scarlet dye was discovered by Nietzki in 1879,\r\nand introduced under the name of \"Biebrich scarlet.\" Two years later a new\r\nsulpho-acid of beta-naphthol was discovered by Bayer & Co. of Elberfeld,\r\nand this gave rise, when combined with diazotised acid yellow and\r\nanalogous compounds, to another series of brilliant dyes introduced as\r\n\"Crocein scarlets.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these beginnings the development of the azo-dyes has been steadily\r\ncarried on to the present time--year by year new diazotisable\r\namido-compounds or new sulpho-acids of the naphthols and naphthylamines\r\nare being discovered, and this branch of the colour industry has already\r\nassumed colossal dimensions. An important departure was made in 1884 by\r\nBoettiger, who introduced the first secondary azo-colours derived from\r\nbenzidine. As already explained in connection with salicylic acid, this\r\nbase and its homologue tolidine form tetrazo-salts, which combine with\r\nphenols and amines or their sulpho-acids. One of the first\r\ncolouring-matters of this group was obtained by combining diazotised\r\nbenzidine with the sulpho-acid of alpha-naphthylamine (naphthionic acid),\r\nand was introduced under the name of \"Congo red.\" Then came the discovery\r\n(Pfaff, 1885), that the tetrazo-salts of benzidine and tolidine combine\r\nwith phenols, amines, &c., in two stages, one of the diazo-groups first\r\ncombining with one-half of the whole quantity of phenol to form an\r\nintermediate compound, which then combines with the other half of the\r\nphenol to form the secondary azo-dye. In the hands of the\r\n\"Actiengesellschaft fuer Anilinfabrikation\" of Berlin this discovery has\r\nbeen utilized for the production of a number of such azo-colours\r\ncontaining two distinct phenols, or amines, or sulpho-acids. Tolidine has\r\nbeen found to give better colouring-matters in most cases than benzidine,\r\nand it is scarcely necessary to point out that an increased demand for the\r\nnitrotoluene from which this base is made is the necessary consequence of\r\nthis discovery.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to attempt to specify by name any of these recent\r\nbenzidine and tolidine dyes. Their introduction has been the means of\r\nfinding new uses for the naphthylamines and naphthols and their\r\nsulpho-acids, and has thus contributed largely to the utilization of\r\nnaphthalene. An impetus has been given to the investigation of these\r\nsulpho-acids, and chemical science has profited largely thereby. The\r\nprocess by which beta-naphthylamine is prepared from beta-naphthol,\r\nalready referred to, viz. by heating with ammonia under pressure, has been\r\nextended to the sulpho-acids of beta-naphthol, and by this means new\r\nbeta-naphthylamine sulpho-acids have been prepared, and figure largely in\r\nthe production of these secondary azo-colours. The latter, as previously\r\nstated, possess the most valuable property of dyeing cotton fibre\r\ndirectly, and by their means the art of cotton dyeing has been greatly\r\nsimplified. The shades given by these colours vary from yellow through\r\norange to bright scarlet, violet, or purple.\r\n\r\nIn addition to benzidine and tolidine, other diazotisable amido-compounds\r\nhave of late years been pressed into the service of the\r\ncolour-manufacturer. The derivative of stilbene, already mentioned as\r\nbeing prepared from a sulpho-acid of one of the nitrotoluenes, forms\r\ntetrazo-salts, which can be combined with similar or dissimilar phenols,\r\namines, or sulpho-acids, as in the case of benzidine and tolidine.\r\nVarious shades of red and purple are thus obtained from the diazotised\r\ncompound, when the latter is combined with the naphthylamines, naphthols,\r\nor their sulpho-acids. These, again, are all cotton dyes. The\r\nnitro-derivatives of the ethers of phenol and cresol, when reduced in the\r\nsame way that nitrobenzene and nitrotoluene are reduced to azobenzene and\r\nazotoluene, also furnish azo-compounds which, on further reduction, give\r\nbases analogous to benzidine and tolidine. Secondary azo-colours derived\r\nfrom these bases and the usual naphthalene derivatives are also\r\nmanufactured. It is among the secondary azo-dyes that we meet with the\r\nfirst direct dyeing blacks, the importance of which will be realized when\r\nit is remembered that the ordinary aniline-black is not adapted for wool\r\ndyeing. The azo-blacks are obtained by combining diazotised sulpho-acids\r\nof amidoazo-compounds of the benzene or naphthalene series with naphthol\r\nsulpho-acids or other naphthalene derivatives.\r\n\r\nOne other series of azo-compounds must be briefly referred to. It has long\r\nbeen known that aniline and toluidine when heated with sulphur evolve\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and give rise to thio-bases, that is, aniline or\r\ntoluidine in which the hydrogen is partly replaced by sulphur. One of the\r\ntoluidines treated in this way is transformed into a thiotoluidine which,\r\nwhen diazotised and combined with one of the disulpho-acids of\r\nbeta-naphthol, forms a red azo-dye, introduced by Dahl & Co. in 1885 as\r\n\"thiorubin.\" By modifying the conditions of reaction between the sulphur\r\nand the base, it was found in 1887 by Arthur Green, that a complicated\r\nthio-derivative of toluidine could be produced which possessed very\r\nremarkable properties. The sulpho-acid of the thio-base is a yellow dye,\r\nwhich was named by its discoverer \"primuline.\" Not only is primuline a\r\ndye, but it contains an amido-group which can be diazotised. If therefore\r\nthe fabric dyed with primuline is passed through a nitrite bath, a\r\ndiazo-salt is formed in the fibre, and on immersing the latter in a second\r\nbath containing naphthol or other phenol or an amine, an azo-dye is\r\nprecipitated in the fibre. By this means there are produced valuable\r\n\"ingrain colours\" of various shades of red, orange, purple, &c.\r\n\r\nSo much for the azo-dyes, one of the most prolific fields of industrial\r\nenterprise connected with coal-tar technology. From the introduction of\r\naniline yellow in 1863 to the present time, about 150 distinct compounds\r\nof this group have been given to the tinctorial industry. Of these over\r\nthirty are cotton dyes containing two azo-groups. Sombre shades, rivalling\r\nlogwood black, bright yellows, orange-reds, browns, violets, and brilliant\r\nscarlets equalling cochineal, have been evolved from the refuse of the\r\ngas-works. The artificial colouring-matters have in this last case once\r\nagain threatened a natural product, and with greater success than the\r\nindigo synthesis, for the introduction of the azo-scarlets has caused a\r\nmarked decline in the cochineal culture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the azo-colours, there are certain other products which\r\nclaim naphthalene as a raw material. In 1879 it was found that one of the\r\nsulpho-acids of beta-naphthol when treated with nitrous acid readily gave\r\na nitroso-sulpho-acid. A salt of this last acid, containing sodium and\r\niron as metallic bases, was introduced in 1884, under the name of\r\n\"naphthol green.\" It is used both as a dye for wool and as a pigment. It\r\nmay be mentioned here that other nitroso-derivatives of phenols, such as\r\nthose of resorcinol and the naphthols, under the name of \"gambines,\" are\r\nlargely used for dyeing purposes, owing to the facility with which they\r\ncombine with metallic mordants to form coloured salts in the fibre. In\r\nthis same year, 1879, it was found that by heating nitrosodimethylaniline\r\nwith beta-naphthol in an appropriate solvent, a violet colouring-matter\r\nwas formed. This is now manufactured under the name of \"new blue,\" or\r\nother designations, and is largely used for producing an indigo-blue shade\r\non cotton prepared with a suitable mordant. The discovery of this\r\ncolouring-matter gave an impetus to further discoveries in the same\r\ndirection. It was found that nitrosodimethylaniline reacted in a similar\r\nway with other phenolic or with amidic compounds. In 1881 Koechlin\r\nintroduced an analogous dye-stuff prepared by the action of the same\r\nnitroso-compound on gallic acid. Gallocyanin, as it is called, imparts a\r\nviolet blue shade to mordanted cotton. Other colouring-matters of the same\r\ngroup are in use; some of them, like \"new blue,\" being derivatives of\r\nnaphthalene. These compounds all belong to a series of which the parent\r\nsubstance is constructed on a type similar to azine; it contains a\r\nnitrogen and oxygen atom linking together the hydrocarbon residues, and is\r\ntherefore known as \"oxazine.\" The researches of Nietzki in 1888 first\r\nestablished the true constitution of the oxazines.\r\n\r\nClosely related to this group is a colouring-matter introduced by Koechlin\r\nand Witt in 1881 under the name of \"indophenol.\" It is prepared in the\r\nsame way as the azines of the \"neutral red\" group; viz. by the action of\r\nnitrosodimethylaniline on alpha-naphthol, or by oxidizing\r\namidodimethylaniline in the presence of alpha-naphthol. Indophenol belongs\r\nto that group of blue compounds formed as intermediate products in the\r\nmanufacture of azines, as mentioned in connection with \"neutral red.\" But\r\nwhile these intermediate blues resulting from the oxidation of a diamine\r\nin the presence of another amine are unstable, and pass readily into red\r\nazines, indophenol is stable, and can be used for dyeing and printing in\r\nthe same way as indigo. The shades which it produces are very similar to\r\nthis last dye, but for certain practical reasons it has not been able to\r\ncompete with the natural dye-stuff.\r\n\r\nThe story of naphthalene is summarized in the schemes on pp. 164, 165.\r\n\r\nLight Oil:\r\n\r\n  Benzene->Disulpho-acid-->Resorcinol.[6]\r\n      \\\r\n       \\-->Nitrobenzene}        } Sulphanilic acid.[7]\r\n                       } Aniline} Amidoazobenzene and sulpho-acid.[7]\r\n                       }        } Nitrosodimethylaniline[8] and\r\n                       }        }    amidodimethylaniline.[8]\r\n                       } Sulpho-acid-->Amidosulpho-acid-->Amidophenol\r\n                       }                                  and ethers.[6]\r\n                       } Azobenzene-->Benzidine.[7]\r\n\r\n                         }Toluidines[7] Sulpho-acids.[7]\r\n                         }              Amidoazotoluene[7]\r\n                         }                 and sulpho-acid.[7]\r\n                         }              Thiotoluidine and primuline.[7]\r\n  Toluene-->Nitrotoluenes} Azotoluene-->Tolidine.[7]\r\n                         } Sulpho-acid and Stilbene-derivative.[7]\r\n\r\n                                    } Sulpho-acids.[7]\r\n  Xylene->Nitroxylenes->Xylidines[7]} Amidoazoxylene[7] and sulpho-acid.[7]\r\n                                    } Cumidine.[7]\r\n\r\nCarbolic Oil:\r\n\r\n  Phenol-->Nitrophenol and ethers } Azophenol ethers-->Diamidic bases[9]\r\n                                  }     analogous to benzidine.\r\n                                  } Amidophenol[9] and ethers.[9]\r\n\r\n  Cresols-->Nitrocresols and ethers-->Amidocresols[9] and ethers.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n              |>Nitronaphthalene\r\n              |  |\r\n              |  |>[Greek: a]-Naphthylamine[9][10]{Naphthionic acid.[9][10]\r\n              |                                   {Amidoazonaphthalene\r\n              |                                          |\r\n              |                                         {Magdala red.\r\n              |                                         {Sulpho-acid.[9]\r\n              |\r\n  Naphthalene>|>Tetrachloride-->Phthalic acid and anhydride.\r\n              |\r\n              |             }                     {Manchester yellow.\r\n              |             }[Greek: a]-Naphthol  {Acid naphthol yellow.\r\n              |             }                     {Sulpho-acids.[10]\r\n              |>Sulpho-acids}\r\n              |             }                   {[Greek: b]-Naphthylamine\r\n              |             }                   {  and sulpho-acids.[9][10]\r\n              |             }[Greek: b]-Naphthol{Sulpho-acids &\r\n              |             }                   {  [Greek: b]-naphthylamine\r\n              |             }                   {  sulpho-acids.[9][10]\r\n              |             }                   {Nitrososulpho-acid and\r\n                                                {  naphthol green.\r\n\r\nThe fraction of coal-tar succeeding the carbolic oil, viz. the creosote\r\noil, does not at present supply the colour manufacturer with any raw\r\nmaterials beyond the small proportion of naphthalene which separates from\r\nit in a very impure condition as \"creosote salts.\" This oil consists of a\r\nmixture of the higher homologues of phenol with various hydrocarbons and\r\nbasic compounds. It is the oil used for creosoting timber in the manner\r\nalready described; and among its other applications may be mentioned its\r\nuse as an illuminating agent and as a source of lampblack. In order to\r\nburn the oil effectively as a source of light, a specially-constructed\r\nburner is used, which is fed by a stream of oil raised from a reservoir at\r\nits foot by means of compressed air, which also aids the combustion of the\r\noil. There is produced by this means a great body of lurid flame, which\r\nis very serviceable where building or other operations have to be carried\r\non at night (see Fig. 10). For lampblack the oil is simply burnt in iron\r\npans set in ovens, and the sooty smoke conducted into condensing chambers.\r\nThe creosote oil constitutes more than 30 per cent. by weight of the\r\ntar--the time may come when this fraction, like the light oil and carbolic\r\noil, may be found to contain compounds of value to the colour-maker or to\r\nother branches of chemical manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--VERTICAL BURNER FOR HEAVY COAL OIL BY THE LUCIGEN\r\nLIGHT CO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--THE MADDER PLANT (_Rubia tinctoria_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the next fraction, anthracene oil, is one of the\r\ngreatest triumphs which applied chemical science can lay claim to since\r\nthe foundation of the coal-tar colour industry. This discovery dates from\r\n1868, when it was shown by two German chemists, Graebe and Liebermann,\r\nthat the colouring-matter of madder was derived from the hydrocarbon\r\nanthracene. Like indigo, madder may be regarded as one of the most ancient\r\nof natural dye-stuffs. It consists of the powdered roots of certain plants\r\nof the genus _Rubia_, such as _R. tinctoria_ (see Fig. 11), _R.\r\nperegrina_, and _R. munjista_, which were at one time cultivated on an\r\nenormous scale in various parts of Europe and Asia. It is estimated that\r\nat the time of Graebe and Liebermann's discovery, 70,000 tons of madder\r\nwere produced annually in the madder-growing countries of the world. At\r\nthat time we were importing madder into this country at the rate of 15,000\r\nto 16,000 tons per annum, at a cost of L50 per ton. In ten years the\r\nimportation had fallen to about 1600 tons, and the price to L18 per ton.\r\nAt the present time the cultivation of madder is practically extinct.\r\n\r\nThere is no better gauge of the practical utility of a scientific\r\ndiscovery than the financial effect. In addition to madder, a more\r\nconcentrated extract containing the colouring-matter itself was largely\r\nused by dyers and cotton printers under the name of \"garancin.\" In 1868 we\r\nwere importing, in addition to the 15,000 to 16,000 tons of madder, about\r\n2000 tons of this extract annually, at a cost of L150 per ton. By 1878 the\r\nimportation of garancin had sunk to about 140 tons, and the price had\r\nbeen lowered to L65 per ton. The total value of the imports of madder and\r\ngarancin in 1868 was over one million pounds sterling; in ten years the\r\nvalue of these same imports had been reduced to about L38,000.\r\nConcurrently with this falling off in the demand for the natural\r\ncolouring-matter, the cultivation of the madder plant had to be abandoned,\r\nand the vast tracts of land devoted to this purpose became available for\r\nother crops. A change amounting to a revolution was produced in an\r\nagricultural industry by a discovery in chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn the persons of two Frenchmen, Messrs. Robiquet and Colin, science laid\r\nhands on the colouring-matter of the _Rubia_ in 1826. These chemists\r\nisolated two compounds which they named alizarin and purpurin. It is now\r\nknown that there are at least six distinct colouring-matters in the madder\r\nroot, all of these being anthracene derivatives. It is known also that the\r\ncolouring-matters do not exist in the free state in the plant, but in the\r\nform of compounds known as glucosides, _i.e._ compounds consisting of the\r\ncolouring-matter combined with the sugar known as glucose. It may be\r\nmentioned incidentally that the colouring-matter of the indigo plant also\r\nexists as a glucoside in the plant. During a period of more than forty\r\nyears from the date of its isolation, alizarin was from time to time\r\nsubmitted to examination by chemists, but its composition was not\r\ncompletely established till 1868, when Graebe and Liebermann, by heating\r\nit with zinc-dust, obtained anthracene. This was the discovery which gave\r\nthe death-blow to the madder culture, and converted the last fraction of\r\nthe tar-oil from a waste product into a material of the greatest value.\r\n\r\nThe large quantity of madder consumed for tinctorial purposes is\r\nindicative of the value of this dye-stuff. It produces shades of red,\r\npurple, violet, black, or deep brown, according to the mordant with which\r\nthe fabric is impregnated. The colours obtained by the use of madder are\r\namong the fastest of dyes, the brilliant \"Turkey red\" being one of the\r\nmost familiar shades. The discovery of the parent hydrocarbon of this\r\ncolouring-matter which had been in use for so many ages--a\r\ncolouring-matter capable of furnishing both in dyeing and printing many\r\ndistinct shades, all possessed of great fastness--was obviously a step\r\ntowards the realization of an industrial triumph, viz. the chemical\r\nsynthesis of alizarin. Within a year of their original observation, this\r\nhad been accomplished by Graebe and Liebermann, and almost simultaneously\r\nby W. H. Perkin in this country. From that time the anthracene, which had\r\npreviously been burnt or used as lubricating grease, rose in value to an\r\nextraordinary extent. In two years a material which could have been bought\r\nfor a few shillings the ton, rose at the touch of chemical magic to more\r\nthan two hundred times its former value.\r\n\r\nAnthracene is a white crystalline hydrocarbon, having a bluish\r\nfluorescence, melting at 213 deg. C. and boiling above 360 deg. C. It was\r\ndiscovered in coal-tar by Dumas and Laurent in 1832, and its composition\r\nwas determined by Fritzsche in 1857. It separates in the form of crystals\r\nfrom the anthracene oil on cooling, and is removed by filtration. The\r\nadhering oil is got rid of by submitting the crystals to great pressure in\r\nhydraulic presses. Further purification is effected by powdering the crude\r\nanthracene cake and washing with solvent naphtha, _i.e._ the mixture of\r\nthe higher homologues of benzene left after the rectification of the light\r\noil. Another coal-tar product, viz. the pyridine base referred to in the\r\nlast chapter, has been recently employed for washing anthracene with great\r\nsuccess. It is used either by itself or mixed with the solvent naphtha.\r\nThe anthracene by washing with these solvents is freed from more soluble\r\nimpurities, and may then contain from 30 to 80 per cent. of the pure\r\nhydrocarbon. The washing liquid, which is recovered by distillation,\r\ncontains, among other impurities dissolved out of the crude anthracene, a\r\nhydrocarbon isomeric with the latter, and known as phenanthrene, for which\r\nthere is at present but little use, but which may one day be turned to\r\ngood account. The actual amount of anthracene contained in coal-tar\r\ncorresponds to about 1/2 lb. per ton of coal distilled, _i.e._ from 1/4 to\r\n1/2 per cent. by weight of the tar. Owing to the great value of alizarin\r\nand the large quantity of this colouring-matter annually consumed,\r\nanthracene is now by far the most important of the coal-tar hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nAlizarin, purpurin, and the other colouring-matters of madder are hydroxyl\r\nderivatives of a compound derived from anthracene by the replacement of\r\ntwo atoms of hydrogen by two atoms of oxygen. These oxygen derivatives of\r\nbenzenoid hydrocarbons form a special group of compounds known as\r\nquinones. Thus there is quinone itself, or benzoquinone, which is benzene\r\nwith two atoms of oxygen replacing two atoms of hydrogen. There are also\r\nisomeric quinones of the naphthalene series known as naphthaquinones. A\r\ndihydroxyl derivative of one of the latter is in use under the somewhat\r\nmisappropriate name of \"alizarin black.\" With this exception no other\r\nquinone derivative is used in the colour industry till we come to the\r\nhydrocarbons of the anthracene oil. Phenanthrene forms a quinone which\r\nhas been utilized as a source of colouring-matters, but these are\r\ncomparatively unimportant. The quinone with which we are at present\r\nconcerned is anthraquinone.\r\n\r\nThe latter is prepared by oxidizing the anthracene--previously reduced by\r\nsublimation to the condition of a very finely-divided crystalline\r\npowder--with sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate. The quinone is\r\npurified, converted into a sulpho-acid, and the sodium salt of the latter\r\non fusion with alkali gives alizarin, which is dihydroxy-anthraquinone. It\r\nis of interest to note that in this case a monosulpho-acid gives a\r\ndihydroxy-derivative. During the process of fusion potassium chlorate is\r\nadded, by which means the yield of alizarin is considerably increased. In\r\nthe original process of Graebe and Liebermann, dibromanthraquinone was\r\nfused with alkali; but this method was soon improved upon by the discovery\r\nof the sulpho-acid by Caro and Perkin in 1869, and from this period the\r\nmanufacture of artificial alizarin became commercially successful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to alizarin, other anthracene derivatives are of industrial\r\nimportance. The purpurin, discovered among the colouring-matters of madder\r\nin 1826, is a trihydroxy-anthraquinone; it can be prepared by the\r\noxidation of alizarin, as shown by De Lalande in 1874. Isomeric compounds\r\nknown as \"flavopurpurin\" and \"anthrapurpurin\" are also made from the\r\ndisulpho-acids of anthraquinone by fusion with alkali and potassium\r\nchlorate. These two disulpho-acids are obtained simultaneously with the\r\nmonosulpho-acid by the action of fuming sulphuric acid on the quinone, and\r\nare separated by the fractional crystallization of their sodium salts from\r\nthe monosulpho-acid (which gives alizarin) and from each other. The\r\npurpurins give somewhat yellower shades than alizarin. Another\r\ntrihydroxy-anthraquinone, although not obtained directly from anthracene,\r\nmust be claimed as a tar-product. It is prepared by heating gallic acid\r\nwith benzoic and sulphuric acids, or with phthalic anhydride and zinc\r\nchloride, and is a brown dye known as \"anthragallol\" or\r\n\"anthracene-brown.\" The anthracene derivative is in this process built up\r\nsynthetically. A sulpho-acid of alizarin has been introduced for wool\r\ndyeing under the name of alizarin carmine, and a nitro-alizarin under the\r\nname of alizarin orange. The latter on heating with glycerin and sulphuric\r\nacid is transformed into a remarkably fast colouring-matter known as\r\nalizarin blue, which is used for dyeing and printing. By heating alizarin\r\nblue with strong sulphuric acid, it is converted into alizarin green.\r\n\r\nThe great industry arising out of the laboratory work of two German\r\nchemists has influenced other branches of chemical manufacture, and has\r\nreacted upon the coal-tar colour industry itself. A new application for\r\ncaustic soda and potassium chlorate necessitated an increased production\r\nof these materials. The first demand for fuming sulphuric acid on a large\r\nscale was created by the alizarin manufacture in 1873, when it was found\r\nthat an acid of this strength gave better results in the preparation of\r\nsulpho-acids from anthraquinone. The introduction of this acid into\r\ncommerce no doubt exerted a marked influence on the production of other\r\nvaluable sulpho-acids, such as acid magenta in 1877, acid yellow in 1878,\r\nand acid naphthol yellow in 1879. The introduction of artificial alizarin\r\nhas also simplified the art of colour printing on cotton fabrics to such\r\nan extent that other colouring-matters, also derived from coal-tar, are\r\nlargely used in combination with the alizarin to produce parti-coloured\r\ndesigns. The manufacture of one coal-tar colouring-matter has thus\r\nassisted in the consumption of others.\r\n\r\nArtificial alizarin is used in the form of a paste, which consists of the\r\ncolouring-matter precipitated from its alkaline solution by acid, and\r\nmixed with water so as to form a mixture containing from 10 to 20 per\r\ncent. of alizarin. The magnitude of the industry will be gathered from the\r\nestimate that the whole quantity of anthracene annually made into\r\nalizarin corresponds to a daily production of about 65 tons of 10 per\r\ncent. paste, of which only about one-eighth is made in this country, the\r\nremainder being manufactured on the Continent. The total production of\r\nalizarin corresponds in money value to about L2,000,000 per annum. One\r\npound of dry alizarin has the tinctorial power of 90 pounds of madder.\r\nSeeing therefore that the raw material anthracene was at one time a waste\r\nproduct, and that the quantity of alizarin produced in the factory\r\ncorresponds to nearly five pounds of 20 per cent. paste for one pound of\r\nanthracene, it is not surprising that the artificial has been enabled to\r\ncompete successfully with the natural product.\r\n\r\nThe industrial history of anthracene is thus summarized. (See opposite.)\r\n\r\n  Anthracene\r\n    |\r\n  Anthraquinone\r\n    |\r\n    |                                      } Sulpho-acid (Alizarin carmine)\r\n    |->Monosulpho-acid-->Alizarin----------} Purpurin\r\n    |                                      } Nitro-alizarin-->Alizarin blue\r\n    |->[Greek: a]-Disulpho-acid-->Flavopurpurin                   |\r\n    |                                                             |\r\n    |->[Greek: b]-Disulpho-acid-->Anthrapurpurin                  |\r\n                                                            Alizarin green.\r\n\r\nThe black, viscid residue left in the tar-still after the removal of the\r\nanthracene oil is the substance known familiarly as pitch. From the\r\nlatter, after removal of all the volatile constituents, there is prepared\r\nasphalte, which is a solution of the pitchy residue in the heavy tar-oils\r\nfrom which all the materials used in the colour industry have been\r\nremoved. Asphalte is used for varnish-making, in the construction of hard\r\npavements, and for other purposes. A considerable quantity of pitch is\r\nused in an industry which originated in France in 1832, and which is\r\nstill carried out on a large scale in that country, and to a smaller\r\nextent in this and other tar-producing countries. The industry in question\r\nis the manufacture of fuel from coal-dust by moulding the latter in\r\nsuitable machines with pitch so as to form the cakes known as \"briquettes\"\r\nor \"patent fuel.\" By this means two waste materials are disposed of in a\r\nuseful way--the pitch and the finely-divided coal, which could not\r\nconveniently be used as fuel by itself. From two to three million tons of\r\nthis artificial fuel are being made annually here and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe various constituents of coal-tar have now been made to tell their\r\nstory, so far as relates to the colouring-matters which they furnish. If\r\nthe descriptive details are devoid of romance to the general reader, the\r\nresults achieved in the short period of thirty-five years, dating from the\r\ndiscovery of mauve by Perkin, will assuredly be regarded as falling but\r\nlittle short of the marvellous. Although the most striking developments\r\nare naturally connected with the colouring-matters, whose history has been\r\nsketched in the foregoing pages, and whose introduction has revolutionized\r\nthe whole art of dyeing, there are other directions in which the coal-tar\r\nindustry has in recent times been undergoing extension. Certain\r\ntar-products are now rendering good service in pharmacy. Salicylic acid\r\nand its salts have long been used in medicine. By distilling a mixture of\r\nthe dry lime salts of benzoic and acetic acids there is obtained a\r\ncompound known to chemists as acetophenone, which is used for inducing\r\nsleep under the name of hypnone. The acetyl-derivative of aniline and of\r\nmethylaniline are febrifuges known as \"antifebrine\" and \"exalgine.\" Ethers\r\nof salicylic acid and its homologues, prepared from these acids and\r\nphenol, naphthols, &c., are in use as antiseptics under the general\r\ndesignation of \"salols.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1881 there was introduced into medicine the first of a group of\r\nantipyretics derived from coal-tar bases of the pyridine series. It has\r\nalready been explained that this base is removed from the light oil by\r\nwashing with acid. Chemically considered, it is benzene containing one\r\natom of nitrogen in place of a group consisting of an atom of carbon and\r\nan atom of hydrogen. The quantity of pyridine present in coal-tar is very\r\nsmall, and no use has as yet been found for it excepting as a solvent for\r\nwashing anthracene or for rendering the alcohol used for manufacturing\r\npurposes undrinkable, as is done in this country by mixing in crude\r\nwood-spirit so as to form methylated spirit. The salts of pyridine were\r\nshown by McKendrick and Dewar to act as febrifuges in 1881, but they have\r\nnot hitherto found their way into pharmacy. The chief interest of the base\r\nfor us centres in the fact that it is the type of a group of bases related\r\nto each other in the same way as the coal-tar hydrocarbons. Thus in\r\ncoal-tar, in addition to pyridine, there is another base known as\r\nquinoline, which is related to pyridine in the same way that naphthalene\r\nis related to benzene. Similarly there is a coal-tar base known as\r\nacridine, which is found associated with the anthracene, and which is\r\nrelated to quinoline in the same way that anthracene is related to\r\nnaphthalene. The three hydrocarbons are comparable with the three bases,\r\nwhich may be regarded as derived from them in the same manner that\r\npyridine is derived from benzene--\r\n\r\n  Benzene    ...    ...    ...    Pyridine\r\n  Naphthalene       ...    ...    Quinoline\r\n  Anthracene ...    ...    ...    Acridine\r\n\r\nSome of these bases and their homologues are found in the evil-smelling\r\noil produced by the destructive distillation of bones (Dippel's oil, or\r\nbone oil), and the group is frequently spoken of as the pyridine group.\r\nThe colouring-matter described as phosphine, obtained as a by-product in\r\nthe manufacture of magenta (p. 94), is a derivative of acridine, and a\r\nyellow colouring-matter discovered by Rudolph in 1881, and obtained by\r\nheating the acetyl derivative of aniline with zinc chloride, is a\r\nderivative of a homologue of quinoline. This dye-stuff, known as\r\n\"flavaniline,\" is no longer made; but it is interesting as having led to\r\nthe discovery of the constitution of phosphine by O. Fischer and Koerner in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nThe antipyretic medicines which we have first to consider are derivatives\r\nof quinoline. This base was discovered in coal-tar by Runge in 1834, and\r\nwas obtained by Gerhardt in 1842 by distilling cinchonine, one of the\r\ncinchona alkaloids, with alkali. Now it is of interest to note that the\r\nquinoline of coal-tar is of no more use to the technologist than the\r\naniline; these bases are not contained in the tar in sufficient quantity\r\nto enable them to be separated and purified with economical advantage. If\r\nthe colour industry had to depend upon this source of aniline only, its\r\ndevelopment would have been impossible. But as chemistry enabled the\r\nmanufacturer to obtain aniline in quantity from benzene, so science has\r\nplaced quinoline at his disposal. This important discovery was made in\r\n1880 by the Dutch chemist Skraup, who found that by heating aniline with\r\nsulphuric acid and glycerin in the presence of nitrobenzene, quinoline is\r\nproduced. The nitrobenzene acts only as an oxidizing agent; the\r\namido-group of the aniline is converted into a group containing carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen, _i.e._ the pyridine group. The discovery of\r\nSkraup's method formed the starting-point of a series of syntheses, which\r\nresulted in the formation of many products of technical value. In all\r\nthese syntheses the fundamental change is the same, viz. the conversion\r\nof an amidic into a pyridine group. We may speak of the amido-group as\r\nbeing \"pyridised\" in such processes. Thus alizarin blue, which is formed\r\nby heating nitro-alizarin with glycerin and sulphuric acid, results from\r\nthe pyridisation of the nitro-group. By an analogous method Doebner and v.\r\nMiller prepared a homologue of quinoline (quinaldine) in 1881, by the\r\naction of sulphuric acid and a certain modification of aldehyde known as\r\nparaldehyde on aniline.\r\n\r\nQuinoline and its homologue quinaldine have been utilized as sources of\r\ncolouring-matters. A green dye-stuff, known as quinoline green, was\r\nformerly made by the same method as that employed for producing the\r\nphosgene colours by Caro and Kern's process (p. 106). The phthalein of\r\nquinaldine was introduced by E. Jacobsen in 1882 under the name of\r\nquinoline yellow, a colouring-matter which forms a soluble sulpho-acid by\r\nthe action of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nTo return to coal-tar pharmaceutical preparations. At the present time\r\nseven distinct derivatives of quinoline, all formed by pyridising the\r\namido-group in aniline, amido-phenols, &c., are known in medicine under\r\nsuch names as kairine, kairoline, thalline, and thermifugine. The mode of\r\npreparation of these compounds cannot be entered into here, Kairine, the\r\nfirst of the artificial alkaloids, is a derivative of hydroxy-quinoline,\r\nwhich was discovered in 1881 by Otto Fischer. All these quinoline\r\nderivatives have the property of lowering the temperature of the body in\r\ncertain kinds of fevers, and may therefore be considered as the first\r\nartificial products coming into competition with the natural alkaloid,\r\nquinine. There is reason for believing that the latter alkaloid, the most\r\nvaluable of all febrifuges, is related to the quinoline bases, so that if\r\nits synthesis is accomplished--as may certainly be anticipated--we shall\r\nhave to look to coal-tar as a source of the raw materials.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable artificial alkaloid, discovered in 1883 by Ludwig Knorr,\r\nclaims aniline as a point of departure. When aniline and analogous bases\r\nare diazotised, and the diazo-salts reduced in the cold with a very gentle\r\nreducing agent, such as stannous chloride, there are formed certain basic\r\ncompounds, containing one atom of nitrogen and one atom of hydrogen more\r\nthan the original base. These bases were discovered in 1876 by Emil\r\nFischer, and they are known as hydrazines, the particular compound thus\r\nobtained from aniline being phenylhydrazine. By the action of this base on\r\na certain compound ether derived from acetic acid, which is known as\r\naceto-acetic ether, there is formed a product termed \"pyrazole,\" and this\r\non methylation gives the alkaloid in question, which is now well known in\r\npharmacy under the name of \"antipyrine.\"\r\n\r\nWhile dealing with this first industrial application of a hydrazine, it\r\nmust be mentioned that the original process by which Fischer prepared\r\nthese bases was improved upon by Victor Meyer and Lecco in 1883, who\r\ndiscovered the use of a cold solution of stannous chloride for reducing\r\nthe diazo-chloride to the hydrazine. By this method the manufacture of\r\nphenylhydrazine and other hydrazines is effected on a large scale--all\r\nkinds of amido-compounds and their sulpho-acids can be diazotised and\r\nreduced to their hydrazines. Out of this discovery has arisen the\r\nmanufacture of a new class of colouring-matters related to the azo-dyes.\r\nThe hydrazines combine with quinones and analogous compounds with the\r\nelimination of water, the oxygen coming from the quinone, and the hydrogen\r\nfrom the hydrazine. The resulting products are coloured compounds very\r\nsimilar in properties to the azo-dyes, and one of these was introduced in\r\n1885 by Ziegler, under the name of \"tartrazine.\" The latter is obtained by\r\nthe action of a sulpho-acid of phenylhydrazine on dioxytartaric acid, and\r\nis a yellow dye, which is of special interest on account of its\r\nextraordinary fastness towards light.\r\n\r\nAnother direction in which coal-tar products have been utilized is in the\r\nformation of certain aromatic compounds which occur in the vegetable\r\nkingdom. Thus the artificial production of bitter-almond oil from toluene\r\nhas already been explained. By heating phenol with caustic alkali and\r\nchloroform, the aldehyde of salicylic acid, _i.e._ salicylic aldehyde, is\r\nformed, and this, on heating with dry sodium acetate and acetic anhydride,\r\npasses into _coumarin_, the fragrant crystalline substance which is\r\ncontained in the Tonka bean and the sweet-scented woodruff. Furthermore,\r\nthe familiar flavour and scent of the vanilla bean, which is due to a\r\ncrystalline substance known as vanillin, can be obtained from coal-tar\r\nwithout the use of the plant. The researches of Tiemann and Haarman having\r\nshown that vanillin is a derivative of benzene containing the aldehyde\r\ngroup, one hydroxyl- and one methoxy-group, the synthesis of this compound\r\nsoon followed (Ulrich, 1884). The starting-point in this synthesis is\r\nnitrobenzoic aldehyde, so that here again we begin with toluene as a raw\r\nmaterial. A mixture of vanillin and benzoic aldehyde when attenuated to a\r\nstate of extreme dilution in a spirituous solvent, gives the perfume known\r\nas \"heliotrope.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least romantic chapter of coal-tar chemistry is this production of\r\nfragrant perfumes from the evil-smelling tar. Be it remembered that these\r\nproducts--which Nature elaborates by obscure physiological processes in\r\nthe living plant--are no more contained in the tar than are the hundreds\r\nof colouring-matters which have been prepared from this same source. It is\r\nby chemical skill that these compounds have been built up from their\r\nelemental groups; and the artificial products, as in the case of indigo\r\nand alizarin, are chemically identical with those obtained from the plant.\r\nAmong the late achievements in the synthesis of vegetable products from\r\ncoal-tar compounds is that of juglone, a crystalline substance found in\r\nwalnut-shell. It was shown by Bernthsen in 1884 that this compound was\r\nhydroxy-naphthaquinone, and in 1887 its synthesis from naphthalene was\r\naccomplished by this same chemist in conjunction with Dr. Semper.\r\n\r\nAnother recent development in the present branch of chemistry brings a\r\ncoal-tar product into competition with sugar. In 1879 Dr. Fahlberg\r\ndiscovered a certain derivative of toluene which possessed an intensely\r\nsweet taste. By 1884 the manufacture of this product had been improved to\r\na sufficient extent to enable it to be introduced into commerce as a\r\nflavouring material in cases where sweetness is wanted without the use of\r\nsugar, such as in the food of diabetic patients. Under the name of\r\n\"saccharin,\" Fahlberg thus gave to commerce a substance having more than\r\nthree hundred times the sweetening power of cane-sugar--a substance not\r\nonly possessed of an intense taste, but not acted upon by ferments, and\r\npossessing distinctly antiseptic properties. The future of coal-tar\r\nsaccharin has yet to be developed; but its advantages are so numerous that\r\nit cannot fail to become sooner or later one of the most important of\r\ncoal-tar products. In cases where sweetening is required without the\r\npossibility of the subsequent formation of alcohol by fermentation,\r\nsaccharin has been used with great success, especially in the manufacture\r\nof aerated waters. Its value in medicine has been recognized by its recent\r\nadmission into the Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable achievements of modern chemistry in connection with\r\ncoal-tar products do not end with the formation of colouring-matters,\r\nmedicines, and perfumes. The introduction of the beautiful dyes has had an\r\ninfluence in other directions, and has led to results quite unsuspected\r\nuntil the restless spirit of investigation opened out new fields for their\r\napplication. A few of these secondary uses are sufficiently important to\r\nbe chronicled here. In sanitary engineering, for example, the intense\r\ncolouring power of fluorescein is frequently made use of to test the\r\nsoundness of drains, or to find out whether a well receives drainage from\r\ninsanitary sources. In photography also coal-tar colouring-matters are\r\nplaying an important part by virtue of a certain property which some of\r\nthese compounds possess.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary photographic plate is, as is well known, much more sensitive\r\nto blue and violet than to yellow or red, so that in photographing\r\ncoloured objects the picture gives a false impression of colour intensity,\r\nthe violets and blues impressing themselves too strongly, and the yellows\r\nand reds too feebly. It was discovered by Dr. H. W. Vogel in 1873 that if\r\nthe sensitive film is slightly tinted with certain colouring-matters, the\r\nsensitiveness for yellow and red can be much increased, so that the\r\npicture is a more natural representation of the object. Plates thus dyed\r\nare said to be \"isochromatic\" or \"orthochromatic,\" and by their use\r\npaintings or other coloured objects can be photographed with much better\r\nresults than by the use of ordinary plates. The boon thus conferred upon\r\nphotographic art is therefore to be attributed to coal-tar chemistry.\r\nAmong the numerous colouring-matters which have been experimented with,\r\nthe most effective special sensitizers are erythrosin, one of the\r\nphthaleins, quinoline red, a compound related to the same group, and\r\ncyanin, a fugitive blue colouring-matter obtained from quinoline in 1860\r\nby Greville Williams.\r\n\r\nIn yet another way has photography become indebted to the tar chemist. Two\r\nimportant developers now in common use are coal-tar products, viz.\r\nhydroquinone and eikonogen. The history of these compounds is worthy of\r\nnarration as showing how a product when once given by chemistry to the\r\nworld may become applicable in quite unexpected directions. Chloroform is\r\na case in point. This compound was discovered by Liebig in 1831, but its\r\nuse as an anaesthetic did not come about till seventeen years after its\r\ndiscovery. It was Sir James Simpson who in 1848 first showed the value of\r\nchloroform in surgical operations. A similar story can be told with\r\nrespect to these photographic developers.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the last century a French chemist, the Count de la\r\nGaraye, noticed a crystalline substance deposited from the extract of\r\nPeruvian bark, then, as now, used in medicine. This substance was the lime\r\nsalt of an acid to which Vauquelin in 1806 gave the name of quinic acid\r\n(_acide quinique_). In 1838 Woskresensky, by oxidizing quinic acid with\r\nsulphuric acid and oxide of manganese, obtained a crystalline substance\r\nwhich he called quinoyl. The name was changed to quinone by Woehler, and,\r\nas we have already seen (p. 172), the term has now become generic,\r\nindicating a group of similarly constituted oxygen derivatives of\r\nhydrocarbons. Hydroquinone was obtained by Caventou and Pelletier by\r\nheating quinic acid, but these chemists did not recognize its true nature.\r\nIt was the illustrious Woehler who in 1844 first prepared the compound in a\r\nstate of purity, and established its relationship to quinone. This\r\nrelationship, as the name given by Woehler indicates, is that of the nature\r\nof a hydrogenised quinone. The compound is readily prepared by the action\r\nof sulphurous acid or any other reducing agent on the quinone.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known in photography, that a developer must be of the\r\nnature of a reducing agent, either inorganic or organic, and many\r\nhydroxylic and amidic derivatives of hydrocarbons come under this\r\ncategory. Thus, pyrogallol, which has already been referred to as a\r\ntrihydroxybenzene (p. 146), when dissolved in alkali rapidly absorbs\r\noxygen--it is a strong reducing agent, and is thus of value as a\r\ndeveloper. But although pyrogallol is a benzene derivative, and could if\r\nnecessary be prepared synthetically, it can hardly be claimed as a tar\r\nproduct, as it is generally made from gallic acid. Now hydroquinone when\r\ndissolved in alkali also acts as a reducing agent, and in this we have the\r\nfirst application of a true coal-tar product as a photographic developer.\r\nIts use for this purpose was suggested by Captain Abney in 1880, and it\r\nwas found to possess certain advantages which caused it to become\r\ngenerally adopted.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a practical use is found for a chemical product its manufacture\r\nfollows as a matter of course. In the case of hydroquinone, the original\r\nsource, quinic acid, was obviously out of question, for economical\r\nreasons. In 1877, however, Nietzki worked out a very good process for the\r\npreparation of quinone from aniline by oxidation with sulphuric acid and\r\nbichromate of soda in the cold. This placed the production of quinone on a\r\nmanufacturing basis, so that when a demand for hydroquinone sprung up, the\r\nwants of the photographer were met by the technologist. Eikonogen is\r\nanother organic reducing agent, discovered by the writer in 1880, and\r\nintroduced as a developer by Dr. Andresen in 1889. It is an\r\namido-derivative of a sulpho-acid of beta-naphthol, so that naphthalene is\r\nthe generating hydrocarbon of this substance.\r\n\r\nThe thio-derivative of toluidine described as \"primuline\" (p. 160), has\r\nrecently been found by its discoverer to possess a most remarkable\r\nproperty which enables this compound to be used for the photographic\r\nreproduction of designs in azo-colours. Diazotised primuline, as already\r\nexplained, combines in the usual way with amines and phenols to form\r\nazo-dyes. Under the influence of light, however, the diazotised primuline\r\nis decomposed with the loss of nitrogen, and the formation of a product\r\nwhich does not possess the properties of a diazo-compound. The product of\r\nphotochemical decomposition no longer forms azo-colours with amines or\r\nphenols. If, therefore, a fabric is dyed with primuline, then diazotised\r\nby immersion in a nitrite bath, and exposed under a photographic negative,\r\nthose portions of the surface to which the light penetrates lose the power\r\nof giving a colour with amines or phenols. The design can thus be\r\ndeveloped by dipping the fabric into a solution of naphthol,\r\nnaphthylamine, &c. By this discovery another point of contact has been\r\nestablished between photography and coal-tar products. Nor is this the\r\nonly instance of its kind, for it has also been observed that a\r\ndiazo-sulpho-acid of one of the xylenes does not combine with phenols to\r\nform azo-dyes excepting under the influence of light. A fabric can\r\ntherefore be impregnated with the mixture of diazo-sulpho-acid and\r\nnaphthol, and exposed under a design, when the azo-colour is developed\r\nonly on those portions of the surface which are acted upon by light.\r\n\r\nThe last indirect application of coal-tar colouring-matters to which\r\nattention must be called is one of great importance in biology. The use of\r\nthese dyes as stains for sections of animal and vegetable tissue has long\r\nbeen familiar to microscopists. Owing to the different affinities of the\r\nvarious components of the tissue for the different colouring-matters,\r\nthese components are capable of being differentiated and distinguished by\r\nmicroscopical analysis. Furthermore, the almost invisible organisms which\r\nin recent times have been shown to play such an important part in\r\ndiseases, have in many cases a special affinity for particular\r\ncolouring-matters, and their presence has been revealed by this means. The\r\nmicro-organism of tubercle, for example, was in this way found by Koch to\r\nbe readily stained by methylene blue, and its detection was thus rendered\r\npossible with certainty. Many of the dyes referred to in the previous\r\npages have rendered service in a similar way. To the pure utilitarian such\r\nan application of coal-tar products will no doubt compensate for any\r\ndefects which they may be supposed to possess from the aesthetic point of\r\nview.[11]\r\n\r\nFrom a small beginning there has thus developed in a period of\r\nfive-and-thirty years an enormous industry, the actual value of which at\r\nthe present time it is very difficult to estimate. We shall not be far out\r\nif we put down the value of the coal-tar colouring-matters produced\r\nannually in this country and on the Continent at L5,000,000 sterling. The\r\nproducts which half a century or so ago were made in the laboratory with\r\ngreat difficulty, and only in very small quantities, are now turned out by\r\nthe hundredweight and the ton.[12] To achieve these results the most\r\nprofound chemical knowledge has been combined with the highest\r\ntechnological skill. The outcome has been to place at the service of man,\r\nfrom the waste products of the gas-manufacturer, a series of\r\ncolouring-matters which can compete with the natural dyes, and which in\r\nmany cases have displaced the latter. From this source we have also been\r\nprovided with explosives such as picric acid; with perfumes and flavouring\r\nmaterials like bitter-almond oil and vanillin; with a sweetening principle\r\nlike saccharin--compared with which the product of the sugar-cane is but\r\nfeeble; with dyes which tint the photographic film, and enable the most\r\ndelicate gradations of shade to be reproduced; with developers such as\r\nhydroquinone and eikonogen; with disinfectants which contribute to the\r\nhealthiness of our towns; with potent medicines which rival the natural\r\nalkaloids; and with stains which reveal the innermost structure of the\r\ntissues of living things, or which bring to light the hidden source of\r\ndisease. Surely if ever a romance was woven out of prosaic material it has\r\nbeen this industrial development of modern chemistry.\r\n\r\nBut although the results are striking enough when thus summed up, and\r\nalthough the industrial importance of all this work will be conceded by\r\nthose who have the welfare of the country in mind, the paths which the\r\npioneers have had to beat out can unfortunately be followed but by the\r\nfew. It is not given to our science to strike the public mind at once with\r\nthe magnitude of its achievements, as is the case with the great works of\r\nthe engineer. Nevertheless the scientific skill which enables a Forth\r\nBridge to be constructed for the use of the travelling public of this\r\nage--marvellous as it may appear to the uninstructed--is equalled, if not\r\nsurpassed, by the mastery of the intricate atomic groupings which has\r\nenabled the chemist to build up the colouring-matters of the madder and\r\nindigo plants.\r\n\r\nA great industry needs no excuse for its existence provided that it\r\nsupplies something of use to man, and finds employment for many hands. The\r\ncoal-tar industry fulfils these conditions, as will be gathered from the\r\nforegoing pages. If any further justification is required from a more\r\nexalted standpoint than that of pure utilitarianism it can be supplied. It\r\nis well known to all who have traced the results of applying any\r\nscientific discovery to industrial purposes, that the practical\r\napplication invariably reacts upon the pure science to the lasting benefit\r\nof both. In no department of applied science is this truth more forcibly\r\nillustrated than in the branch of technology of which I have here\r\nattempted to give a popular account. The pure theory of chemical\r\nstructure--the guiding spirit of the modern science--has been advanced\r\nenormously by means of the materials supplied by and resulting from the\r\ncoal-tar industry. The fundamental notion of the structure of the benzene\r\nmolecule marks an epoch in the history of chemical theory of which the\r\nimportance cannot be too highly estimated. This idea occurred, as by\r\ninspiration, to August Kekule of Bonn in the year 1865, and its\r\nintroduction has been marked by a quarter century of activity in research\r\nsuch as the science of chemistry has never experienced at any previous\r\nperiod of its history. The theory of the atomic structure of the benzene\r\nmolecule has been extended and applied to all analogous compounds, and it\r\nis in coal-tar that we have the most prolific source of the compounds of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely to be wondered at that an idea which has been so prolific\r\nas a stimulator of original investigation should have exerted a marked\r\ninfluence on the manufacture of tar-products. All the brilliant syntheses\r\nof colouring-matters effected of late years are living witnesses of the\r\nfertility of Kekule's conception. In the spring of 1890 there was held in\r\nBerlin a jubilee meeting commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nbenzene theory. At that meeting the representative of the German coal-tar\r\ncolour industry publicly declared that the prosperity of Germany in this\r\nbranch of manufacture was primarily due to this theoretical notion. But if\r\nthe development of the industry has been thus advanced by the theory, it\r\nis no less true that the latter has been helped forward by the industry.\r\n\r\nThe verification of a chemical theory necessitates investigations for\r\nwhich supplies of the requisite materials must be forthcoming. Inasmuch as\r\nthe very materials wanted were separated from coal-tar and purified on a\r\nlarge scale for manufacturing purposes, the science was not long kept\r\nwaiting. The laborious series of operations which the chemist working on a\r\nlaboratory scale had to go through in order to obtain raw materials, could\r\nbe dispensed with when products which were at one time regarded as rare\r\ncuriosities became available by the hundredweight. It is perhaps not too\r\nmuch to say that the advancement of chemical theory in the direction\r\nstarted by Kekule has been accelerated by a century owing to the\r\ncircumstance that coal-tar products have become the property of the\r\ntechnologist. In other words, we might have had to wait till 1965 to reach\r\nour present state of knowledge concerning the theory of benzenoid\r\ncompounds if the coal-tar industry had not been in existence. And this is\r\nnot the only way in which the industry has helped the science, for in the\r\ncourse of manufacture many new compounds and many new chemical\r\ntransformations have been incidentally discovered, which have thrown great\r\nlight on chemical theory. From the higher standpoint of pure science, the\r\nindustry has therefore deservedly won a most exalted position.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the value of the coal-tar dyes as tinctorial agents, there\r\nis a certain amount of misconception which it is desirable to remove.\r\nThere is a widely-spread idea that these colours are fugitive--that they\r\nrub off, that they fade on exposure to light, that they wash out, and, in\r\nshort, that they are in every way inferior to the old wood or vegetable\r\ndyes. These charges are unfounded. One of the best refutations is, that\r\ntwo of the oldest and fastest of natural colouring-matters, viz. alizarin\r\nand indigo, are coal-tar products. There are some coal-tar dyes which are\r\nnot fast to light, and there are many vegetable dyes which are equally\r\nfugitive. If there are natural colouring-matters which are fast and which\r\nare aesthetically orthodox, these are rivalled by tar-products which fulfil\r\nthe same conditions. Such dyes as aniline black, alizarin blue, anthracene\r\nbrown, tartrazine, some of the azo-reds and naphthol green resist the\r\ninfluence of light as well as, if not better than, any natural\r\ncolouring-matter. The artificial yellow dyes are as a whole faster than\r\nthe natural yellows. There are at the present time some three hundred\r\ncoal-tar colouring-matters made, and about one-tenth of that number of\r\nnatural dyes are in use. Of the latter only ten--let us say 33 per\r\ncent.--are really fast. Of the artificial dyes, thirty are extremely fast,\r\nand thirty fast enough for all practical requirements, so that the fast\r\nnatural colours have been largely outnumbered by the artificial ones. If\r\nNature has been beaten, however, this has been rendered possible only by\r\ntaking advantage of Nature's own resources--by studying the chemical\r\nproperties of atoms, and giving scope to the play of the internal forces\r\nwhich they inherently possess--\r\n\r\n  \"Yet Nature is made better by no mean,\r\n  But Nature makes that mean: so, o'er that art,\r\n  Which, you say, adds to Nature, is an art\r\n  That Nature makes.\"\r\n\r\nThe story told in this chapter is chronologically summarized below--\r\n\r\n  1820.

Thiorubin introduced by Dahl & Co., leading to manufacture of\r\n        thiotoluidine; followed by primuline, discovered by A. G. Green in\r\n        1887.\r\n\r\n  1886. Secondary azo-dyes of stilbene series introduced by Leonhardt & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy passing steam over red-hot carbon, a mixture of carbon monoxide and\r\nhydrogen is formed. This mixture of inflammable gases is known as\r\n\"water-gas,\" and in the preparation of the gas on a large scale, coke is\r\nused as a source of carbon. If, therefore, water-gas became generally\r\nused, another use for coke would be added to those already referred to (p.\r\n47).\r\n\r\nWith reference to the consumption of coal in London (p. 46), it appears\r\nfrom the Report of a Committee of the Corporation of London, issued at the\r\nend of 1890, that the present rate of consumption in the Metropolis is\r\n9,709,000 tons per annum. This corresponds to 26,600 tons per diem. It has\r\nbeen proved by experiment, that when coal is burnt in an open grate, from\r\none to three per cent. of the coal escapes in the form of unburnt solid\r\nparticles, or \"soot,\" and about 10 per cent. is lost in the form of\r\nvolatile compounds of carbon. It has been estimated that the total amount\r\nof coal annually wasted by imperfect combustion in this country is\r\n45,000,000 tons, corresponding to about L12,000,000, taking the value of\r\ncoal at the pit's mouth. Taking the unconsumed solid particles at the very\r\nlowest estimate of 1 per cent., it will be seen that, in London alone, we\r\nare sending forth carbonaceous and tarry matter into the atmosphere at the\r\nrate of about 266 tons daily; and volatile carbon compounds at the daily\r\nrate of 2660 tons (see p. 32). At the price of coal in London this means\r\nthat, in solid combustibles alone, we are absolutely squandering about\r\nL10,000 annually, to say nothing of the damage caused by the presence of\r\nthis sooty pall. Such facts as these require no comment; they speak for\r\nthemselves in sombre gloom, and in the sickliness of our town\r\nvegetation--they give a new meaning to the term \"in darkest London,\" and\r\nthey plead eloquently for science and legislation to show us \"the way\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Accum, condensation of tar-oils, 69\r\n\r\n  Acetic acid, 64\r\n\r\n

Of\r\nthe commercial aspect of these discoveries it is of course impossible at\r\npresent to form an opinion.\r\n\r\n[6] With phthalic anhydride gives fluorescein and dyes of eosin and\r\nrhodamin series.\r\n\r\n[7] Diazotised and combined with naphthylamines, naphthols, or their\r\nsulpho-acids give azo-dyes.\r\n\r\n[8] With naphthols give oxazines and indophenol.\r\n\r\n[9] Diazotised and combined with phenols, amines, or sulpho-acids to form\r\nazo-dyes.\r\n\r\n[10] Combined with diazotised amido-compounds to form azo-dyes.\r\n\r\n[11] Since the above was written the continuation of Koch's researches\r\nupon the tubercle bacillus has culminated in the discovery of his now\r\nworld-renowned lymph for the inoculation of patients suffering from\r\ntubercular disease.\r\n\r\n[12] In one large factory in Yorkshire there is a set of stills kept\r\nconstantly at work making pure aniline at the rate of two hundred tons per\r\nmonth. The monthly consumption of coal in this factory is two thousand\r\ntons, equal to twenty-four thousand tons per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE\r\n\r\nSociety for Promoting Christian Knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nA series of books which will show that science has for the masses as great\r\ninterest and more edification than the romances of the day.\r\n\r\n_Small Post 8vo, Cloth boards._\r\n\r\nThe Birth and Growth of Worlds.
