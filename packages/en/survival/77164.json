Every man in travelling will be directed in peculiar\r\npaths of observation by his peculiar tastes, habits, and personal\r\ninterests, and there will always be a greater or less class who will\r\nlike to hear of just what he liked to see. With a hearty country\r\nappetite for narrative, I have spent, previous to my own journey, a\r\ngreat many long winter evenings in reading the books so frequently\r\nwritten by our literary tourists, upon England; and although I do not\r\nrecollect one of them, the author of which was a farmer, or whose\r\nhabits of life, professional interests, associations in society, and\r\nordinary standards of comparison were not altogether different from\r\nmy own, I remember none from which I did not derive entertainment and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the triteness of the field, I may presume\r\nto think, that there will be a great many who will yet enjoy to follow\r\nme over it, and this although my gait and carriage should not be very\r\nelegant, but so only as one farmer’s leg and one sailor’s leg with the\r\nhelp of a short, crooked, half-grown academic sapling, for a walking\r\nstick, might be expected to carry a man along with a head and a heart\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is especially for farmers and farmers’ families that I have\r\nwritten, I trust that all who try to read the book, will be willing to\r\ncome into a warm, good-natured, broad country kitchen fireside relation\r\nwith me, and permit me to speak my mind freely, and in such language\r\nas I can readily command on all sorts of subjects that come in my way,\r\nforming their own views from the facts that I give them, and taking my\r\nopinions for only just what they shall seem to be worth.\r\n\r\nSome explanation of a few of the intentions that gave direction to my\r\nmovements in travelling may be of service to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe wages, and the cost and manner of living of the labouring men, and\r\nthe customs with regard to labour of those countries and districts,\r\nfrom which foreign writers on economical subjects are in the habit of\r\nderiving their data, had been made a subject of more than ordinary and\r\nother than merely philanthropical interest to me, from an experience\r\nof the difficulty of applying their calculations to the different\r\ncircumstances under which work must be executed in the United States.\r\nMy vocation as a farmer, too, had led me for a long time to desire\r\nto know more of the prevailing, ordinary, and generally accepted\r\npractices of agriculture, than I could learn from Mr. Coleman’s book,\r\nor from the observations of most of the European correspondents of our\r\nagricultural periodicals, the attention of these gentlemen having been\r\nusually directed to the exceptional improved modes of cultivation which\r\nprevail only among the amateur agriculturists and the bolder and more\r\nenterprising farmers.\r\n\r\nThe tour was made in company with two friends, whose purposes somewhat\r\ninfluence the character of the narrative. One of them, my brother,\r\nhoped by a course of invigorating exercise, simple diet, and restraint\r\nfrom books and other in-door and sedentary luxuries, to re-establish\r\nhis weakened health, and especially to strengthen his eyes, frequent\r\nfailures of which often seriously annoyed and interrupted him in the\r\nstudy of his profession. The other, our intimate friend from boyhood,\r\ndesired to add somewhat to the qualifications usually inquired after in\r\na professed teacher and adviser of mankind, by such a term and method\r\nof study as he could afford to make, of the varying developments of\r\nhuman nature under different biases and institutions from those of his\r\nown land.\r\n\r\nWe all considered, finally, that it should be among those classes which\r\nform the majority of the people of a country that the truest exhibition\r\nof national character should be looked for, and that in their\r\ncondition should be found the best evidence of the wisdom of national\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn forming the details of a plan by which we could, within certain\r\nlimits of time and money, best accomplish such purposes as I have\r\nindicated, we were much indebted to the information and advice given by\r\nBayard Taylor in his “Views a-Foot.”\r\n\r\nThe part now published contains the narrative of the earlier, and to\r\nus most interesting, though not the most practically valuable, part of\r\nour journey. I was in the habit of writing my diary usually in the form\r\nof a letter, to be sent as occasion offered to friends at home. It is\r\nfrom this desultory letter-diary, with such revision and extension and\r\nfilling up of gaps, as my memory and pocket-book notes afford, that\r\nthis volume has been formed. I have most desired to bring before my\r\nbrother farmers and their families such things that I saw in England as\r\nhave conveyed practical agricultural information or useful suggestions\r\nto myself, and such evidences of simply refined tastes, good feelings,\r\nand enlarged Christian sentiments among our English brethren, as all\r\nshould enjoy to read of. It was my design to have somewhat extended\r\nthis volume, that it might contain a greater proportion of more\r\ndistinctly rural matter, but the liberal proposal of Mr. Putnam to\r\ninclude it in the excellent popular Series he is now publishing, makes\r\na limit to its length necessary. Should I have reason to believe,\r\nhowever, that I have succeeded in the purposes which led me to write\r\nfor the public, I shall be most happy at another time to continue my\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n                                                      FRED.

The confidence in imposition those acquire who are\r\nin the habit of dealing with emigrant passengers, was amusingly shown\r\nin the assurance with which they would attempt to _lie down_ the most\r\nobvious objections to what they had to offer; declaring that a cabin\r\ndisgusting with filth and the stench of bilge-water was sweet and\r\nclean, that darkness in which they would be groping was very light (a\r\ntrick, certainly, not confined to their trade), that a space in which\r\none could not stand erect, or a berth like a coffin, was very roomy,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nFinally we _were_ taken in by the perfect impudence and utter\r\nsimplicity in falsehood of one of them, an underling of “a respectable\r\nhouse”—advertised passenger agents of the ship—which, on the lie being\r\nrepresented to _it_, thought proper to express _its_ “regret” at the\r\nyoung man’s error, but could not be made to see that it was proper for\r\nthem to do any thing more,—the error not having been discovered in time\r\nfor us to conveniently make other arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe had engaged a “family-room” exclusively for ourselves, in the very\r\nlarge and neatly-fitted cabin of a new, clean first-class packet. We\r\nthought the price asked for it very low, and to secure it beyond a\r\ndoubt, had paid half the money down at the agent’s desk, and taken a\r\nreceipt, put some of our baggage in it, locked the door, and taken\r\nthe key. The ship was hauling out from her pier when we went on board\r\nwith our trunks, and found the spacious second cabin had been stored\r\nhalf full of cotton, and the remaining space was lumbered up with ship\r\nstores, spare sails, &c. The adjoining rooms were occupied by steerage\r\npassengers, and the steward was trying keys to let them into ours. The\r\nmate cursed us for taking the key, and the captain declared no one had\r\nbeen authorized to make such arrangements as had been entered into with\r\nus, and that he should put whom he pleased into the room.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PASSENGER AGENTS.—MUTINY._]\r\n\r\nWe held on to the key, and appealed first to the agents and then to the\r\nowners. Finally we agreed to take a single room-mate, a young man whom\r\nthey introduced to us, and whose appearance promised agreeably, and\r\nwith this compromise were allowed to retain possession. The distinction\r\nbetween second cabin and steerage proved to be an imagination of the\r\nagents—those who had asked for a steerage passage were asked a little\r\nless, and had berths given them in the second-cabin state-rooms, the\r\nproper _steerage_ being filled up with freight. The captain, however,\r\ndirected the cook to serve us, allowed us a light at night in our\r\nroom, and some other extra conveniences and privileges, and generally\r\ntreated us after we got to sea as if he considered us rather more of\r\nthe “gentleman” class than the rest;—about two dollars apiece more, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nAfter the ship had hauled out into the stream, and while she lay in\r\ncharge of the first mate, the captain having gone ashore, there was a\r\nbit of mutiny among the seamen. Nearly the whole crew refused to do\r\nduty, and pledged each other never to take the ship to sea. Seeing that\r\nthe officers, though prepared with loaded pistols, were not disposed\r\nto act rashly, we offered to assist them, for the men had brought up\r\ntheir chests and were collecting handspikes and weapons, and threatened\r\nto take a boat from the davits if they were not sent on shore. It was\r\ncurious to see how the steerage passengers, before they had any idea\r\nof the grounds of the quarrel, but as if by instinct, almost to a man,\r\ntook sides against the lawful authority.\r\n\r\nHaving had some experience with the ways of seamen, I also went forward\r\nto try to pacify them. (Like most Connecticut boys, I knocked about the\r\nworld a few years before I _settled down_, and one of these I spent in\r\na ship’s forecastle.) The only thing the soberest of them could say\r\nwas, that a man had been killed on the ship, and they knew she was\r\ngoing to be unlucky; and that they had been shipped in her when too\r\ndrunk to know what they were about. Perceiving that all that the most\r\nof them wanted was to get ashore, that they might have their spree\r\nout, and as there was no reasoning with them, I advised the mate to\r\nsend them a fiddle and let them get to dancing. He liked the idea, but\r\nhad no fiddle, so as the next most pacifying amusement, ordered the\r\ncook to give them supper. They took to this kindly, and after using\r\nit up went to playing _monkey shines_, and with singing, dancing, and\r\nshouting kept themselves in good humour until late in the evening, when\r\nthey, one by one, dropped off, and turned in. The next morning they\r\nwere all drunk and sulky, and contented themselves with refusing to\r\ncome on deck when ordered.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain came on board and learned the state of things, he\r\ntook a hatchet, and with the officers and carpenter jumped into the\r\nforecastle, and with a general knocking down and kicking out, got them\r\nall on deck. He then broke open their chests and took from them six\r\njugs of grog which they had concealed, and threw them overboard. As\r\nthey floated astern, a Whitehall boatman picked them up, and after\r\nsecuring the last, took a drink and loudly wished us good luck.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the most violent were sent on shore (not punished, but\r\nso rewarded), and their places supplied by others. The rest looked\r\na little sour, and contrived to meet with a good many _accidents_\r\nas long as the shore boats kept about us; but when we were fairly\r\ngetting clear of the land, and the wind hauled a bit more aft, and\r\nthe passengers began to wish she would stop for just one moment,\r\nand there came a whirr-rushing noise from under the bows—the hearty\r\n_yo-ho—heave-o-hoii_—with which they roused out the stu’n-sails was\r\nsuch as nobody the least bit sulky could have begun to have found voice\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nA handsome Napoleonic performance it was of the captain’s:—the more\r\nneed that I should say that in my mind he disgraced himself by it;\r\nbecause, while we lay almost within hail of the properly constituted\r\nofficers of the law, and under the guns of a United States fortress\r\nsuch dashing violence was unnecessary and lawless;—only at sea had he\r\nthe right, or could he be justified in using it.\r\n\r\nI suppose that some such difficulties occur at the sailing of half the\r\nships that leave New York. I have been on board a number as they were\r\ngetting under way, and in every one of them there has been more or less\r\ntrouble arising from the intoxicated condition of the crew. Twice I\r\nhave seen men fall overboard, when first ordered aloft, in going down\r\nthe harbour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE START._]\r\n\r\nThe ship did not go to sea until three days after she was advertised\r\nto sail, though she had her crew, stores, and steerage passengers on\r\nboard all that time. I do not know the cause of her detention; it\r\nseemed unnecessary, as other large ships sailed while we lay idle;\r\nand if unnecessary, it was not honest. The loss of three days’ board,\r\nand diminution by so much of the stores, calculated to last out the\r\npassage, and all the other expenses and inconveniences occasioned by it\r\nto the poor steerage passengers, may seem hardly worthy of notice; and\r\nI should not mention it, if such delays, often much more protracted,\r\nwere not frequent, sometimes adding materially to the suffering always\r\nattending a long passage.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 3d of May we passed out by the light-ship of the outer\r\nbar, and soon after eight o’clock that evening the last gleam of\r\nFire-Island light disappeared behind the dark line of unbroken horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  AT SEA.—INCIDENTS.—SEA SOCIABILITY.—A YARN.—SEA\r\n    LIFE.—CHARACTERS.—ENGLISH RADICALS.—SKEPTICS.—EDUCATION.—FRENCH\r\n    INFIDELITY.—PHRENOLOGY.—THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _At Sea, May 28._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE VOYAGE._]\r\n\r\nWe are reckoned to-day to be about one hundred and fifty miles to\r\nthe westward of Cape Clear; ship close-hauled, heading north, with a\r\nvery dim prospect of the termination of our voyage. It has been thus\r\nfar rather dull and uneventful. We three have never been obliged to\r\nown ourselves actually sea-sick, but at any time during the first\r\nweek we could hardly have declared that we felt perfectly well, and\r\nour appetites seemed influenced at every meal as if by a gloomy\r\napprehension of what an hour might bring forth. Most of the other\r\npassengers have been very miserable indeed. I notice they recover\r\nmore rapidly in the steerage than in the cabin. This I suppose to be\r\nowing to their situation in the middle of the ship, where there is the\r\nleast motion, to their simple diet, and probably to their having less\r\ntemptation to eat freely, and greater necessity to “make an effort,”\r\nand move about in fresh air.\r\n\r\nWe have met one school of small whales. There might have been fifty\r\nof them, tumbling ponderously over the waves, in sight at once.\r\nOccasionally one would rise lazily up so near, that, as he caught sight\r\nof us, we could seem to see an expression of surprise and alarm in his\r\nstolid, black face, and then he would hastily throw himself under\r\nagain, with an energetic slap of his flukes.\r\n\r\nOne dark, foggy night, while we were “on the Banks,” we witnessed a\r\nrather remarkable exhibition of marine pyrotechny. The whole water, as\r\nfar as we could see, was lustrous white, while nearer the eye it was\r\nfull of spangles, and every disturbance, as that caused by the movement\r\nof the ship, or the ripples from the wind, or the surging of the sea,\r\nwas marked by fire flashes. Very singular spots, from the size of one’s\r\nhand to minute sparks, frequently floated by, looking like stars in\r\nthe milky-way. We noticed also several schools, numbering hundreds,\r\nof what seemed little fishes (perhaps an inch long), that darted here\r\nand there, comet-like, with great velocity. I tried, without success,\r\nto catch some of these. It was evident that, _besides the ordinary_\r\nphosphorescent animalcula, there were various and distinct varieties of\r\nanimated nature around us, such as are not often to be observed.\r\n\r\nSome kind of sea-bird we have seen, I think, every day, and when at the\r\ngreatest distance from land. Where is their home? is an oft-repeated\r\nquestion, and, What do they eat? They are mysteries, these feathered\r\nBedouins. To-day, land and long-legged shore birds are coming on board\r\nof us. They fly tremulously about the ship, sometimes going off out of\r\nsight and back again, then lighting for a few moments on a spar or line\r\nof rigging. Some have fallen asleep so; or suffered themselves, though\r\npanting with apprehension, to be taken. One of these is a swallow, and\r\nanother a wheatear. Some kind of a lark, but not recognisable by the\r\nEnglish on board, was taken several days since. It had probably been\r\nlost from the Western Islands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A “BOARDING” ANECDOTE._]\r\n\r\nWe have seen but very few vessels; but the meeting with one of them\r\nwas quite an event in sea life. She was coming from the eastward,\r\nwind north, and running free, when we first saw her, but soon after\r\ntook in her studding-sails and hauled up so as to come near us. When\r\nabeam, and about three miles distant, she showed German colours, laid\r\naback her mainsail and lowered a quarter-boat, which we immediately\r\nsquared away to meet, and ran up our bunting, every body on deck, and\r\ngreat excitement. With a glass we could see her decks loaded with\r\nemigrants; and as her masts and sails appeared entirely uninjured, it\r\ncould only be conjectured that she was distressed for provisions or\r\nwater. The carpenter was sent to sound the water tanks, and the mate\r\nto make an estimate of what stores might be safely spared, while we\r\nhastened to our rooms to scribble notes to send home. We finished them\r\nsoon enough to see a neat boat, rowed by four men, come alongside, and\r\na gentlemanly young officer mount nimbly up the side-ladder. He was\r\nreceived on deck by our second mate, and conducted aft by him to the\r\ncabin companion, where the captain, having put on his best dress-coat\r\nand new Broadway stove-pipe hat, stood, like a small king, dignifiedly\r\nwaiting. After the ceremony of presentation, the captain inquired,\r\n“Well, sir, what can I have the pleasure of doing for you?” The young\r\nman replied that he came from the ship so and so, Captain ——, who sent\r\nhis compliments, and desired “_Vaat is te news?_” This cool motive\r\nfor stopping two ships in mid-ocean, with a fresh and favourable wind\r\nblowing for each, took the captain plainly aback; but he directly\r\nrecovered, and taking him into the cabin, gave him a glass of wine and\r\na few minutes’ conversation with a most creditable politeness; a chunk\r\nof ice and a piece of fresh meat were passed into the boat, and the\r\nsteerage passengers threw some tobacco to the men in her. The young\r\nofficer took our letters, with some cigars and newspapers, and went\r\nover the side again, without probably having perceived that we were any\r\nless gregarious beings than himself. The curbed energy and suppressed\r\nvexation of our officers, however, showed itself before he was well\r\nseated in his boat, by the violent language of command, and the\r\nrapidity with which the yards were sharpened and the ship again brought\r\nto her course.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence brought to the mind of our “second dickey” that\r\nnight, a boarding affair of his own, which he told us of in the\r\ndrollest manner possible. I wish you could hear his drawl, and see his\r\nimmoveably sober face, but twinkling eye, that made it all seem natural\r\nand just like him, as he spun us the yarn.\r\n\r\nHe was once, he said, round in the Pacific, in a Sag-Harbour whaler,\r\n“rayther smart, we accounted her,” when they tried to speak an English\r\nfrigate, and did not get quite near enough. So, as they had nothing\r\nelse to do, they “up’t and chased her,” and kept after her without ever\r\ngetting any nearer for nearly three days. Finally, the wind hauled\r\nround ahead and began to blow a little fresh, and they overhauled her\r\nvery rapidly, so that along about sunset they found themselves coming\r\nwell to windward of her, as they ran upon opposite tacks. They then\r\nhove-to, and he was sent in a boat to board her, and she promptly\r\ncame-to also, and waited for him.\r\n\r\nDressed in a dungaree jumper, yellow oil-skin hat, and canvass\r\ntrowsers, he climbed on board the frigate and was immediately addressed\r\nby the officer of the deck.\r\n\r\n“Now then, sir, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Are you the cap’en of this here frigate, sir?”\r\n\r\n“What’s your business?”\r\n\r\n“Why, our cap’en sent his compliments to yourn, sir, and—if you are\r\na going home—he wished you’d report the bark Lucreetshy Ann, of\r\nSag-Harbour, Cap’en J. Coffin Starbuck, thirty-seven days from Wahoo\r\n(Oahu), seven hundred and fifty barrels of sperm, and two hundred and\r\nfifty of whale; guess we shall go in to Tuckeywarner (Talcahuano).”\r\n\r\n“Is that all, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no; the old man did say, if you was a mind to, he’d like to have\r\nme see if I could make a trade with yer for some tobacky. We hadn’t had\r\nnone now a going on two week, and he’s a most sick. How is’t—yer mind\r\nto?”\r\n\r\n“Is that all your business, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Well—yes; I guess ’tis about all.”\r\n\r\n“I think you had better get into your boat, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe thought so too, when he saw the main-yard immediately after begin to\r\nswing round. As the officer stepped below, he went over the side. When\r\nhe called out to have the painter let go though, he was told to wait\r\na bit, and directly a small parcel of tobacco was handed down and the\r\nsame officer, looking over the rail, asked,\r\n\r\n“Did you say the _Lucretia Ann_?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir; Lucreetshy Ann, of Sag-Harbour.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Starboard, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“‘_Buck_,’ sir, ‘_buck_.’ How about this ’backey?”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, raising his head, his cap, striking the main-sheet as\r\nit was being hauled down, was knocked off and fell into the water, when\r\none of the whalers immediately lanced it and held it up dripping.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, mister; I say, what shall we do with this cap? Did you mean ter\r\nthrow it in.”\r\n\r\nThe officer once more looked over the side, with half a dozen grinning\r\nmiddies, and imperturbably dignified, replied,\r\n\r\n“You will do me the favor to present it to Captain Buck, and say to\r\nhim, if you please, that when he wishes to communicate with one of Her\r\nMajesty’s ships again, it will be proper for him to do so in person.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly—oh, yes; good night to yer. Here, let’s have that cap.\r\nGive way, now, boys,” so saying he clapped it on the top of his old\r\nsouwester, and as the frigate forged ahead, the boat dropped astern,\r\nand was pulled back to the Lucretia Ann.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A GALE._]\r\n\r\nWe have had only three days of any thing like bad weather, and those\r\nwe enjoyed, I think, quite as much as any. The storm was preceded by\r\nsome twenty-four hours of a clear, fresh northwester, driving us along\r\non our course with foaming, sparkling, and most exhilarating speed.\r\nIt gives a fine sensation to be so borne along, like that of riding a\r\ngreat, powerful, and spirited horse, or of dashing yourself through\r\nthe crashing surf, and in your own body breasting away the billows as\r\nthey sweep down upon you. Gradually it grew more and more ahead, and\r\nblew harder and harder. When we came on deck early in the morning, the\r\nhorizon seemed within a stone’s throw, and there was a grand sight\r\nof dark-marbled swelling waves, rushing on tumultuously, crowding\r\naway and trampling under each other, as if panic-struck by the grey,\r\nlowering, misty clouds that were sweeping down with an appearance of\r\nintense mysterious purpose over them. The expression was of vehement\r\nenergy blindly directed. The ship, lying-to under trifling storm-sail,\r\nseemed to have composed herself for a trial, and, neither advancing nor\r\nshrinking back, rose and fell with more than habitual ease and dignity.\r\nHaving been previously accustomed only to the fidgety movements of a\r\nsmaller class of vessels, I was greatly surprised and impressed by\r\nher deliberate movements; the quietness and simplicity with which she\r\nanswered the threats of the turbulent elements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“If only that northwester had continued”—every body is saying—“we might\r\nhave been in Liverpool by this.” It’s not unfashionable yet at sea to\r\ntalk about the weather. I am to write about what is most interesting\r\nus! Well, the wind and weather. Bad time when it comes to that? Well,\r\nnow,—here I am, sitting on a trunk, bracing myself between two berths,\r\nwith my portfolio on my knees—imagine the motion of the vessel, the\r\nflickering, inconstant half-light that comes through a narrow piece of\r\ninch-thick glass, which the people on deck are constantly crossing,\r\nexclamations from them, dash of waves and creaking of timber, and\r\nvarious noises both distracting and _lullabying_, and if you can’t\r\nunderstand the difficulty of thinking connectedly, you may begin to\r\nthat of writing.\r\n\r\nJohn’s eyes have been bad, and we have read aloud with him a good deal;\r\nbut I tell you it is hard work even to read on board ship. We have had\r\nsome good talks, have listened to a good deal of music, and to a bad\r\ndeal, and had a few staggering hops with the ladies on the quarter\r\ndeck. We contrived a set of chess-men, cutting them out of card-board,\r\nfitting them with cork pedestals, and a pin-point to attach them to\r\nthe board so they would not slip off or blow away. Charley has had\r\nsome capital games, and I believe found his match with Dr. M., one of\r\nthe cabin passengers returning home from the East Indies by way of\r\nCalifornia, who promises to introduce him at a London chess club.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE VOYAGE._]\r\n\r\nI told you in my letter by the pilot-boat, how we had been humbugged\r\nabout the second cabin. While this has reduced the cost of our passage\r\nto a very small sum, we have had almost every comfort that we should\r\nhave asked. Our room is considerably more spacious, having been\r\nintended for a family apartment, and has the advantage of much less\r\nmotion than those of the first cabin. For a ship’s accommodations it\r\nhas, too, a quite luxurious degree of ventilation and light. There is a\r\nlarge port in it that we can open at pleasure, having only been obliged\r\nto close it during two nights of the gale. Our stores have held out\r\nwell, and the cook has served us excellently, giving us, particularly,\r\nnice fresh rolls, soups, omelettes, and puddings. We have hardly tasted\r\nour cured meat, and with this and our hard bread we are now helping out\r\nsome of our more unfortunate neighbors. Split peas and portable soup\r\n(_bouillon_), with fresh and dried fruit, have been valuable stores;\r\neven our friends in the cabin have been gladly indebted to us for the\r\nlatter. Don’t forget when you come to sea to have plenty of fruit.\r\n\r\nAs the captain desired us to use the quarter-deck privileges, we have\r\nassociated as we pleased with the first-cabin passengers, and found\r\nseveral valuable acquaintances among them. (Friend, rather, I should\r\ncall one now.)\r\n\r\nOur room-mate, a young Irish surgeon, is a very good fellow, apparently\r\nof high professional attainments, and possessed of a power of so\r\nconcentrating his attention on a book or whatever he is engaged with,\r\nas not to be easily disturbed, and a general politeness in yielding to\r\nthe tastes of the majority that we are greatly beholden to. He is a\r\ndevoted admirer of Smith O’Brien, and thinks the Irish rising of ’48\r\nwould have been successful, if he (O’B.) had not been too strictly\r\nhonest and honorable a man to lead a popular revolt. Of what he saw\r\nand knew at that time, he has given us some interesting particulars,\r\nwhich lead me to think that the revolutionary purpose, insurrection,\r\nor at least the insurrectionary purpose, and preparation was much more\r\ngeneral, respectable, and formidable, than I have hitherto supposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EMIGRANT PASSENGERS._]\r\n\r\nOf his last winter’s passage, in an emigrant ship, across the Atlantic,\r\nhe gives us a most thrilling account.\r\n\r\nHe had been appointed surgeon of a vessel about to sail from a\r\nsmall port in Ireland. She was nearly ready for sea, the passengers\r\ncollecting and stores taken on board, when some discovery was made that\r\ninvolved the necessity of withdrawing her. Another ship was procured\r\nfrom Liverpool, and the stores, passengers, doctor, and all, hastily\r\ntransferred to her in the night, as soon as she arrived. They got to\r\nsea, and he found there was hardly a particle of any thing in the\r\nmedicine chest. He begged the captain to put back, but the captain was\r\na stubborn, reckless, devil-may-care fellow, and only laughed at him.\r\nThat very night the cholera broke out. He went again to the captain,\r\nhe beseeched him, he threatened him; he told him that on his head\r\nmust be the consequences; the captain didn’t care a rope yarn for the\r\nconsequences, he would do any thing else to oblige the doctor, but go\r\nback he would not. The doctor turned the pigs out of the long-boat, and\r\nmade a temporary hospital of it. It was a cold place, but any thing\r\nwas better than that horrible steerage. Nevertheless, down into the\r\nsteerage the doctor would himself go every morning, nor leave it till\r\nevery soul had gone or been carried on deck before him. He searched the\r\nship for something he could make medicine of. The carpenter’s chalk\r\nwas the only thing that turned up. This he calcined and saved, to be\r\nused sparingly. He forced those who were the least sea-sick to become\r\nnurses; convalescents and those with less dangerous illness, he placed\r\nbeds for on the galley and the hen-coops, and made the captain give\r\nup his fowls and other delicacies to them. Fortunately fair weather\r\ncontinued, and with sleepless vigilance, and strength, as it seemed\r\nto him, almost miraculously sustained, he continued to examine and\r\nsend on deck for some hours each day, every one of the three hundred\r\npassengers. On the first cholera symptoms appearing, he gave the\r\npatient chalk, and continued administering it in small but frequent\r\ndoses until the spasmodic crisis commenced; thence he troubled him only\r\nwith hot fomentations. The third day out a man died and was buried. The\r\ncaptain read the funeral service, and after the body had disappeared\r\nbeneath the blue water, the doctor took advantage of the solemn moment\r\nagain to appeal to him.\r\n\r\n“Captain, there are three hundred souls in this ship—”\r\n\r\n“Belay that, doctor; I’ll see every soul of ’em in Davy’s locker, sir,\r\nbefore I’ll put my ship back for your cursed physic.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor said no more, but turned away with a heavy heart to do his\r\nduty as best he could.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the horrors of that passage as he would.\r\nNevertheless, as far as simple numbers can give it, you shall have the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOut of those three hundred souls, before the ship reached New York,\r\nthere died one, and he, the doctor declared most soberly, was a very\r\nold man, and half dead with a chronic (something) when he came on\r\nboard. So much for burnt chalk and—fresh air!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, this story, which, as I have repeated it, I believe is\r\nessentially true, though not in itself a painful one, not the less\r\nstrikingly shows with what villainous barbarity, by disregard or\r\nevasion of the laws of England, and the neglect or connivance of the\r\nport officers, the emigrant traffic is carried on. Some of the accounts\r\nof the three other medical men on board, who are also returning from\r\npassages in emigrant ships, would disgust a slave-trader. They say that\r\nmany of the passengers will never go on deck unless they are driven or\r\ncarried, and frequently the number of these is so great, that it is\r\nimpossible to force them out of their berths, and they sometimes lie\r\nin them in the most filthy manner possible, without ever stepping out\r\nfrom the first heave of the sickening sea till the American pilot is\r\nreceived on board. Then their wives, husbands, children, as the case\r\nmay be, who have served them with food during their prostration, get\r\nthem up, and, if they can afford it, change their garments, throwing\r\nthe old ones, with the bed and its accumulations, overboard. So, as\r\nany one may see, from a dozen ships a day often in New York, they come\r\nashore with no disease but want of energy, but emaciated, enfeebled,\r\ninfected, and covered with vermin. When we observe the listlessness,\r\neven cheerfulness, with which they accept the precarious and dog-like\r\nsubsistence which, while in this condition, the already crowded city\r\naffords them, we see the misery and degradation to which they must\r\nhave been habituated in their native land. When in a year afterwards\r\nwe find that the same poor fellows are plainly _growing_ active,\r\nhopeful, enterprising, prudent, and, if they have been favourably\r\nsituated, cleanly, tidy, and actually changing to their very bones as\r\nit seems—tight, elastic, well-knit muscles taking the place of flabby\r\nflesh, as ambition and blessed discontent take the place of stupid\r\nindifference,—we appreciate, as the landlords and the government men of\r\nIreland never can, what are the causes of that degradation and misery.\r\n\r\nDr. M. gives much happier accounts of the English governmental emigrant\r\nships to Australia, in which he has made two voyages. Some few of their\r\narrangements are so entirely commendable, and so obviously demanded\r\nby every consideration of decency, humanity, and virtue, that I can\r\nonly wonder that the law does not require all emigrant vessels to\r\nadopt them. Among these, that which is most plainly required, is the\r\ndivision of the steerage into three compartments: married parties with\r\ntheir children in the central one, and unmarried men and women having\r\nseparate sleeping accommodations in the other two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MIDSHIP PASSENGERS._]\r\n\r\nThe others of our midship passengers are mostly English artisans, or\r\nmanufacturing workmen. There are two or three farmers, a number of\r\nIrish servants, male and female, and several nondescript adventurers;\r\ntwo Scotchmen only, brothers, both returning from Cuba sugar\r\nplantations where they have been employed as engineers. They tell us\r\nthe people there are all for annexation to the United States, but as\r\nthey cannot speak Spanish, their information on this point cannot be\r\nvery extensive. Besides ourselves, there is but one American-born\r\nperson among them. She is a young woman of quite superior mind, fair\r\nand engaging, rather ill in health, going to England in hopes to\r\nimprove it, and to visit some family friends there. The young men are\r\nall hoping the ship will be wrecked, so they can have the pleasure of\r\nsaving her—or dying in the attempt. One goes into the main-chains and\r\nsits there for several hours, all alone, every fine day, for no other\r\nreason that we can conceive, but to drop himself easily into the water\r\nafter her, in case she should fall overboard. There are three or four\r\nother women, and as many babies, and little boys and girls. They do not\r\ncry very often, but are generally in high spirits, always in the way,\r\nfrolicking or eating, much fondled and scolded, and very dirty.\r\n\r\nThe most notable character in our part of the ship, is one Dr. T.,\r\nanother returning emigrant physician. He appears to have been well\r\neducated, and is of a wealthy Irish family. His diploma is signed by\r\nSir Astley Cooper, whose autograph we have thus seen. Though a young\r\nman, he is all broken down in spirit and body from hard drinking.\r\nHe makes himself a buffoon for the amusement of the passengers, and\r\nsome of the young men of the first cabin are so foolish as to reward\r\nhim sometimes with liquor, which makes him downright crazy. Even the\r\npale-faced student, who kept his neighbours awake with his midnight\r\nprayers while he was sea-sick, has participated in this cruel fun. Dr.\r\nT. has been _smutten_, as the second mate says, by a young lady of the\r\nfirst cabin, who does not altogether discourage his gallant attentions.\r\nHe keeps up the habits of a gentleman in the reduction of his\r\ncircumstances, eating his dinner at four o’clock, (being thus enabled\r\nto cook it while the first-cabin people are below eating theirs, which\r\nis served at half-past three). He declares it was only to oblige the\r\nowners that he took a berth in the second cabin, and he certainly\r\nshould not have done so, if he had suspected the _promiscuous_\r\ncharacter of the company he should be associated with there. The\r\nforenoon he spends in combing his hair and whiskers, cleaning his\r\nthreadbare coat, smoothing his crushed hat, and polishing his shoes.\r\nNow, indeed, since he has become conscious of the tender passion, and\r\ncan feed on love, he has traded off a part of his stock of bread for a\r\npair of boots, which enables him to dispense with stockings and straps,\r\nmuch to his relief in dances and fencing bouts. Towards noon he comes\r\non deck with his coat buttoned to the neck; he wears a stock and no\r\ncollar; his hat is set on rakishly; he has a yellow kid glove for his\r\nright hand, the thumb only is missing—his thumb, therefore, is stuck\r\nunder the breast of his coat allowing the rest to be advantageously\r\ndisplayed; his other hand is carried habitually in the mode of Mr.\r\nPickwick, under the skirt of his coat. He has in his mouth the stump of\r\na cigar that he found last night upon the deck, and has saved for the\r\noccasion. After walking until it is smoked out with the gentlemen—to\r\nwhom he manages to give the impression that he has just finished his\r\nbreakfast—he approaches, with a really elegant air to the ladies, and,\r\ngracefully bowing, inquires after their health. Then, after gazing\r\nupwards at the sun a moment, he takes the attitude, “Napoleon at St.\r\nHelena,” his left hand hidden under his right arm, and, in a deep,\r\ntremulous voice, says, “Ourre nooble barruck still cleaves the breeny\r\nailiment, and bears us on with velucitay ’twarrd th’ expectant shoorres\r\nof Albeeon’s eel. Ah! what a grrand expanse it is of weeld-washing\r\nwaterrers! Deleeghtful waytherr, ’pon my worrud.” He is a good\r\nfencer, boxer, card player, and trickster; a safe waltzer, even in a\r\nrolling ship, and, when half-seas over, dances a jig, hornpipe, or\r\nFrench _pas seul_, and turns a _pirouette_ on the top of the capstan;\r\nplays a cracked clarionet, and can get something out of every sort\r\nof musical instrument; he spouts theatrically, gives imitations of\r\nliving actors, sings every thing, _improvises_, and on Sunday chants\r\nfrom the prayer-book, so that even then the religiously inclined may\r\n_conscientiously_ enjoy his entertainment. A most rare treasure for a\r\nlong passage. Some of our passengers declare they would have died of\r\ndulness if it had not been for him!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHARACTERS.—A POET._]\r\n\r\nThere is another Irishman (from the North), who has written a poem as\r\nlong as Paradise Lost, the manuscript of which he keeps under lock\r\nand key, in a small trunk, at the head of his bed, and, as they say,\r\nfastened to a life-preserver. It is never out of his head, however,\r\nand he manages to find something to quote from it appropriate to\r\nevery occasion. You might suppose he would be made use of as a butt,\r\nbut somehow he is not, and is only regarded as a bore. I incline to\r\nthink him a true poet, for he is a strange fellow, often blundering,\r\nstupidly as it seems, upon “good hits,” and, however inconsistently,\r\nalways speaking with the confidence of true inspiration. We have a\r\ngodless set around us, and he is very impatient of their card-playing\r\nand profanity—particularly if the weather is at all bad—declaring\r\nthat he is not superstitious, but that he thinks, if a man is ever\r\nto stand by his faith, it should be when he is in the midst of the\r\nawful ocean, and in an unlucky ship. “Nay,” he asserts again, “he is\r\n_not_ superstitious, and no one must accuse him of it, but if he\r\nwere not principled against it, he would lay a large wager that this\r\nship never does arrive at her destined port.” His poem runs somewhat\r\nupon socialism, whether approvingly or condemnatory I have not yet\r\nbeen able quite to understand. I rather think he has a scheme of\r\nhis own for remodelling society. He uses a good deal of religious\r\nphraseology; he is liberal on doctrinal points, does not enlist under\r\nany particular church banner, and says himself, that he can bear “any\r\nsort of religion (or irreligion) in a man, so he is not a papist.”\r\nTowards all persons of the Roman church he entertains the most orthodox\r\ncontempt and undisguised hatred, as becomes, in his opinion, an Irish\r\n_Protestant-born_ man.\r\n\r\nThere is a good-natured fellow who has been a flat-boatman on the\r\nMississippi, and more lately a squatter somewhere in the wilds of\r\nthe West. His _painter_ and cat-fish stories, with all his reckless\r\nairs and cant river phrases, have much entertained us; of course\r\nhe has no baggage, but a “heap of plunder.” He has a rough, rowdy,\r\nblustering, half-barbarous way with him, and you would judge from his\r\ntalk sometimes, that he was a perfectly lawless, heartless savage;\r\nyet again there is often evident in his behaviour to individuals a\r\nsingularly delicate sense of propriety and fitness, and there is not a\r\nman in the ship with whom I would sooner trust the safety of a woman or\r\nchild in a time of peril. The great fault of the man is his terrific\r\nand uncontrollable indignation at any thing which seems to him mean or\r\nunjust, and his judgment or insight of narrow-mindedness is not always\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHARACTERS._]\r\n\r\nHe has formed a strong friendship, or crony-ship, for an Englishman\r\non board, who is a man of about the same native intelligence, but\r\na strange contrast to him in manner, appearance, and opinions,\r\nbeing short, thick-set, slow of speech, and husky voiced. He is a\r\nstone-cutter by trade, and returns to England because, as he says,\r\nthere is no demand for so _fine work_ as he is able to do, in America,\r\nand he will be better paid in London. These two men are always\r\ntogether, and always quarrelling. Indeed, the Englishman has, with his\r\nslowness and obstinate deafness to reason on any matter that he has\r\nonce stated his views of, an endless battery of logic and banterings\r\nto reply to, for he is the only defender of an aristocratic form of\r\ngovernment amongst us, every other man, Irish, Scotch, or English,\r\nbeing a thorough-going, violent, radical democrat. Most of them,\r\nindeed, claim the name of red republican, and carry their ideas of\r\n“liberty” far beyond any native American I have known. What is more\r\nremarkable and painful, nearly all of them, except the Irish, are\r\nprofessedly Deists or Atheists, or something of the sort, for all\r\ntheir ideas are evidently most crude and confused upon the subject,\r\nand amount to nothing but pity, hatred, or contempt for all religious\r\npeople, as either fools or hypocrites, impostors or imposed upon.\r\nThere is only one of them that seems to have ever thought upon the\r\nmatter at all carefully, or to be able to argue upon it, and he is so\r\nself-satisfied (precisely what he says, by the way, of every one that\r\nargues against him), that he never stops arguing. Of him I will speak\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA remark of one of the farmers, an Englishman, and a very sensible\r\nfellow, upon these sentiments so generally held among our company,\r\nseemed to me true and well expressed. I think my observation of the\r\nlower class of Englishmen in the United States generally confirms it.\r\n“I have often noticed of my countrymen,” said he, “that when they cease\r\nto honour the king, they no longer fear God.” That is, as I understand\r\nit, when they are led to change the political theory in which they\r\nhave been instructed, they must lose confidence in a religious creed\r\nwhich they owe about equally to the circumstances of their birth,\r\nneither having been adopted from a rational process in their own minds.\r\nSeeing the childish absurdity of many forms which they have been\r\ntrained to consider necessary, natural, and ordered of God, they lose\r\nconfidence in all their previous ideas that have resulted from a merely\r\nreceptive education, and religion and royalty are classed together as\r\nold-fashioned notions, nursery bugbears, and romances. It is partly the\r\nresult of the abominable masquerade of words which is still constantly\r\nplayed off in England on all public occasions, clothing government\r\nwith antiquated false forms of sacredness. The simple majesty and\r\nholy authority that depends on the exercise of justice, love, and\r\ngood judgment, so far from being made more imposing by this mummery,\r\nis lost sight of; while all the folly, indiscretion, and injustice of\r\nthe administration of the law by fallible and unsanctified agents, is\r\ninevitably associated in the minds of the ignorant with all that is\r\nholy and true.\r\n\r\nThe only idea now, these our shipmates entertain of Christianity,\r\nseemed to be the particular humbug by which the bishops and clergy\r\nmake the people think that they must support them in purple and fine\r\nlinen, just as royalty is the humbug on which the queen is borne, and\r\ngovernment the humbug by which the aristocracy are carried on their\r\nshoulders, all, of course, in combination. And nothing would convince\r\nthem of the sincerity of the clergy short of their martyrdom—even that,\r\nI fear, should the time come for them to act as judges, they would\r\nrather attribute to pride, or, at best, to an exceptional deluded mind.\r\nWith these ideas, nothing but thorough contempt for him, or fear of\r\npunishment, would prevent them from putting a bishop to the test of the\r\nstake, if he should fall into their hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEMOCRACY.—SKEPTICISM._]\r\n\r\nWhile this explanation, if it is correct, should not hinder the\r\npromulgation of sound republican views, it strongly opposes the fear\r\nthat many have, of providing for the lower classes an education that\r\nshall make them capable of free independent thinking. It is long ago\r\ntoo late in any country in the world, to prevent the masses from\r\nlearning that little that is dangerous. Yet, even in England, it is\r\nargued by churchmen that education, unless managed by the church, is\r\nthe foe of their religion! Surely, there must be consciousness of evil\r\nin this fear of the light. True religion is not a machinery for fitting\r\nmen with beliefs and morals. The free man in Christ cannot be the\r\nsubject of ignorance. It is as much slavish and disloyal to God to be\r\nblindly led by a priest, as to be wheedled by a politician; and more\r\nthan it is to be ruled over and crushed by a tyrant. Let _us_ remember,\r\ntoo, that slaves to party or to creed are not confined to monarchies,\r\nbut that all churches and governments whose authority is not dependent\r\non the untrammelled and honest judgment of free intelligent minds, are\r\nalike ungodly and degrading.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the connection of liberal politics with religious\r\nskepticism is correct, it follows that we may look with less of horror\r\nand more of hope upon the infidelity which has so scandalized the\r\nnational character of France. We may conceive it as the unnatural\r\nand convulsive action of a mind which the last thrust of tyranny\r\nhas suddenly aroused from a long, false dream. Sitting in judgment\r\nover the wickedness of tyrants and the licentiousness of courts, it\r\nwould be strange, unnatural, almost unreasonable, that a people whose\r\nreligious teachers had been dependent on those tyrants,—had been the\r\nmost active sycophants of those courts,—teachers, who had taught them\r\nthat the power there seated was sacred, should hold in reverence for\r\na moment longer, any of the dogmas of a religion so debased. The\r\nauthority, the stability of the throne, which they have ground to\r\npowder and thrown to the free winds, was a part of the very idea of the\r\nbeing and government of the God in whom they had been instructed to\r\nbelieve. Would they not be fools still to worship _such_ an idol of the\r\nimagination? And what then? The natural and fearful reaction here also,\r\nfrom torpidity and stupid delusion, which a _little_ knowledge must\r\nprovoke. And which is best—a dead, superstitious morality, or a live,\r\nworking-onward infidelity—a slow poison, swallowed in a sugar-coated\r\nbolus, or an active, painful, purging black-draught? Let us yet hope\r\n(for years are but hours with a nation), that repudiation of lying\r\nforms and ignoble use of the name of God, and His Holy Word is but a\r\nsymptom which precedes a return of healthy fidelity to the truth of God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return to the man that I mentioned as being more thoughtful and fond\r\nof argument than the others, and who for that reason I have reserved to\r\nspeak of more particularly, as affording a more tangible illustration\r\nof English popular skepticism and agrarianism of the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A DEIST._]\r\n\r\nHe was born near Sheffield, had been a good while in the United\r\nStates, and now returned to England, thinking that some particular\r\nart, in smelting, I believe, that he had acquired, would be more\r\nvalued there. He had certainly been a serious and constant thinker,\r\nbut his information was limited, superficial, and inaccurate, and\r\nhe was better at quibbling and picking inconsistencies, than at\r\nsustained and thorough reasoning. He was a man that would have a strong\r\ninfluence with a certain kind of honest people, not able to think\r\nfar originally; and as his activity would infuse itself into them,\r\nand he was generally in earnest after something, his influence might\r\npossibly in the end be more good than bad. No one could sleep easily,\r\nat all events, while he was near them (as, literally, some of us had\r\nuncomfortable experience). He had been brought up to the best of the\r\ncunning of his parents and friends, a strict ——ist; and nothing can be\r\nmore characteristic of the blundering progress likely to be made by a\r\nman cramped with an “education,” after the cowardly fashion to which\r\nthe stiff-necked people of England so generally condemn their children,\r\nthan his account of his coming to Deism.\r\n\r\nWhile quite young, he said that he saw inconsistencies in the religious\r\ndoctrines which had been battered into him, and for years labored\r\npainfully and devoutly to reconcile them; yet each dogma, however\r\ncontradicted by another, seemed plainly to rest on Bible language\r\n(always understanding that language as interpreted by his teachers),\r\nconstantly looking into every thing else that came in his way, he\r\nobtained from itinerant lecturers some knowledge of phrenology, and\r\nreading a few books upon it, and practising among his fellow-workmen,\r\nhe soon acquired not only a good deal of theoretical understanding of\r\nthe science, and acuteness in discerning character, but considerable\r\nskill as a manipulator. So, as he moved from place to place, sometimes,\r\nI suspect, giving lectures himself also upon it, he had accumulated\r\nexperience that to him incontestably proved the foundation in nature\r\nof the science. He was still a church-going man, and still worshipped\r\nunder the shadow of his congenital creed, still trying to reconcile\r\nwhat seemed its discrepancies, when one day he read in the religious\r\nnewspapers of his sect an article on phrenology, in which the reverend\r\neditor, in strong terms, declared its devilish origin and untruth.\r\n\r\nHis argument, what there was of it, for his strength was mostly spent\r\nin ridicule, denunciation, and everlasting condemnation, was based\r\non the assumption that phrenology was inconsistent with free will\r\nand moral responsibility, therefore irreconcilable with the Bible.\r\nTo listen to phrenologists, then, was to close the eye of faith;\r\n“if you accept phrenology as truth, you deny God. If the Bible is\r\ntrue, phrenology is false; if phrenology is true, the Bible is a lie.\r\nPhrenology is infidelity.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” exclaimed he, “_I_ am an infidel, for I _know_ as well as\r\nthe nose on my face, that phrenology _is_ true.” He forthwith began\r\nto study infidel books, soon so scandalized his church, that he was\r\npublicly expelled from it, and thenceforth he had looked upon the Bible\r\nonly as a block in the road, over which every man must leap before he\r\ncan become free to truth. As the great barrier to the progress of his\r\nrace, he set himself diligently to searching out every cranny of error\r\nand crevice of inconsistency from which he could proudly poke the dust,\r\nand expose to reasoners equally shallow with himself; unconscious, poor\r\nfellow, that he was merely picking into blind traditions, uninspired\r\ntranslations, and hard-squeezed interpretations; rubbish of mortal\r\nchurch-builders and vain-glorious creed-idolaters, accumulating for\r\nnineteen centuries over the real under-laying adamant of divine truth.\r\n\r\nHe had even yet, while with us, all the zeal and activity in this\r\npurpose that characterizes the young convert to any faith; talked to\r\nevery one that would listen to him, and lugged in his “cause” most\r\npertinaciously with every company he joined, no matter what might be\r\nthe subject of conversation before he entered. There was little use\r\nto argue with him, for he would shift his ground as fast as it was\r\nweakened under him, and by changing the question, never knew that\r\nhe failed to sustain himself. He would insist on making the Bible\r\nresponsible for every ridiculous notion that foolish or designing men\r\nhave ever professed to ground upon it, and constantly insisted on\r\ntaking part in those quarrels, it was little matter to him on which\r\nside, which, like the fierce little disputes one often hears in a\r\nfamily, only show the real bond of love, in the common interest, that\r\ncan make matters so trivial seem important. On the grand and simple\r\npurpose of the Bible, from which all Christendom is nursed, he would\r\nalways avoid to look or argue.\r\n\r\nI had myself always managed to avoid discussion with him, till one\r\nnight, as he came to me on deck to repeat the good things with which\r\nhe had successively sent to bed the Episcopalian, the Unitarian, the\r\nCalvinist, and the poet, fearing that he presumed from my silence\r\nthat I sympathized with his opinions, and would enjoy his triumphs,\r\nI thought it not honest to do so longer; but as I really cared very\r\nlittle for the views one way or the other against which the shafts\r\nof his wit had been directed, I desired, if possible, to get him\r\nto examine the broad, catholic citadel of which these, at best,\r\nwere insignificant outworks, in which alone, too, I had sufficient\r\nconfidence to be willing to encounter him. I found it almost\r\nimpossible, however, to draw his attention from them. They had been\r\nmade to appear to him so much the most important part of Christianity,\r\nthat he could hardly for an instant raise his eyes above them, or see\r\nthrough their obstruction. This difficulty, common enough perhaps\r\nanywhere, is peculiarly characteristic of English working-men, and\r\nis, as I imagine, a direct result of the prevalent views of education\r\namong the religious classes of their country. I have seen immense\r\nevil, as I think, arising from it, and have a strong conviction of its\r\nexceeding folly and danger. I cannot, however, presume upon the general\r\ninterest of my readers in the subject, and will not pursue it; but as\r\nillustrating what I mean, and also as showing what seems to me the best\r\nway to meet the difficulties I have referred to, I will endeavour to\r\ngive, in the Appendix, for those who care to listen to it, a report of\r\nour conversation.[1] It is, of course, impossible to report minutely\r\na conversation after a considerable lapse of time. I wish to give\r\nthe general ideas brought out, with so much of their connection as\r\nshall show the manner in which they were suggested, and the motive of\r\npresenting them, as this must often greatly affect their force and\r\ncharacter. The reader is requested to bear this remark in mind in other\r\nconversations which will be found in this book. It is the idea given,\r\nand the exhibition of character presented in any way, that I endeavour\r\nto recall and dramatize with all the truth of my memory.\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  SAILORS.—“SOGERS.”—BOOKS.—ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OUR SHIP’S CREW._]\r\n\r\nIf the purport of my title would permit it, I should like to write a\r\nlong chapter on our ship’s crew, and the general subject of American\r\nofficers and seamen. I will, however, but give, in this one word,\r\nmy testimony, as one having had some experience as to the tyranny,\r\nbarbarity, and lawlessness with which in most of our merchant ships\r\nthe common seamen are treated; and the vice, misery, and hopelessness\r\nto which, as a body, they are left on our shores, by the neglect or\r\nill-judged and parsimonious assistance of those who compass sea and\r\nland to make proselytes of the foreign heathen.\r\n\r\nOur ship’s crew, as is usual in a Liverpool packet, are nearly all\r\nforeigners—English, Scotch, Irish, Danes, French, and Portuguese. One\r\nboasts of being “half-Welsh and half-Heelander,” judging from this\r\nspecimen, I have not a very high opinion of the cross. The mate is a\r\nDane, the second and third mates, Connecticut men. The captain, also,\r\nis from somewhere down east. He is a good and careful seaman, courteous\r\nin his manners, and a religious man, much more consistently so than\r\npious captains I have known before proved to be, after getting on blue\r\nwater. He never speaks to the seamen, or directly has any thing to do\r\nwith them. In fact, except when he is taking observations, or in bad\r\nweather, or an emergency, you would never see in him any thing but\r\na floating-hotel keeper. It is plain, nevertheless, that his eye is\r\neverywhere, and a single incident will show that the savage custom of\r\nthe sea has not been without the usual influence upon him. He went to\r\nthe kitchen the other day and told the cook he must burn less wood\r\nthan he had been doing. The cook, who is a peculiarly mild, polite,\r\npeaceable, little Frenchman, replied that he had along been careful not\r\nto use more than was necessary. The captain immediately knocked him\r\ndown, and then quietly remarking, “You’ll take care how you answer me\r\nnext time,” walked back to join the ladies. The cook fell on the stove,\r\nand was badly burned and bruised.\r\n\r\nThe men complain that their food is stinted and poor, and they are\r\nworked hard, at least they are kept constantly at work; men never exert\r\nthemselves much when that is the case. It has been evident to me that\r\nthey all _soger_ systematically. (_Sogering_ is pretending to work,\r\nand accomplishing as little as possible.) It is usually considered an\r\ninsult to accuse one of it, but one day I saw a man so evidently trying\r\nto be as long as he could at some work he had to do in the rigging,\r\nthat I said to him,—\r\n\r\n“Do you think you’ll _make eight bells_ of that job?”\r\n\r\nHe looked up with a twirl of his tongue, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Have you been at it all the watch?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, sir, I have.”\r\n\r\n“A smart man would have done it in an hour, I should think.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he might.”\r\n\r\n“Do you call yourself a soger?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, we all sogers, reg’lar, in this here craft. D’ye see, sir,\r\nthe capten’s a mean man, and ’ould like to get two days’ work in one\r\nout on us. If he’d give us _watch-and-watch_, sir, there’d be more work\r\ndone, you mote be sure, sir.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SAILORS’ ETHICS._]\r\n\r\nSunday is observed by sparing the crew from all labour not necessary to\r\nthe sailing of the ship, but as it is the only day in which they have\r\nwatch-and-watch, or time enough to attend to such matters, they are\r\nmostly engaged in washing and mending their clothes. We had selected\r\na number of books at the Tract-house, which we gave away among them.\r\nThey were received with gratitude, and the pictures at least read\r\nwith interest. The printed matter was read somewhat also; I noticed\r\nthree men sitting close together, all spelling out the words from\r\nthree different books, and speaking them aloud in a low, monotonous\r\ntone. If they had come to a paragraph in Latin, I doubt if they would\r\nhave understood what they read any less. The truth is, as I have\r\noften noticed with most sailors, _a book is a book_, and they read it\r\nfor the sake of reading, not for the ideas the words are intended to\r\nconvey, just as some people like to work out mathematical problems\r\nfor the enjoyment of the work, not because they wish to make use of\r\nthe result. I saw a sailor once bargaining with a shipmate for his\r\nallowance of grog, offering him for it a little book, which he said\r\nwas “first-rate reading.” After the bargain was closed I looked at\r\nthe book. It was a volume of Temperance tales. The man had no idea of\r\nmaking a practical joke, and assured me with a grave face, that he had\r\nread it all through. One Sunday, in the latter part of a passage from\r\nthe East Indies, one of my watchmates, an old sea-dog, closed a little\r\ncarefully preserved Testament, and slapping it on his knee, said, with\r\na triumphant air, as if henceforth there was laid up for him a crown of\r\nglory and no mistake,—“There! I’ve read that book through, every word\r\non’t, this voyage; and, damme, if I ha’nt got more good out on’t than\r\nI should ’a got going aft long with the rest on ye, to hear that old\r\npharisee (the captain) make his long prayers.” Then, after gazing at it\r\na few moments, he added, musingly, as if reflecting on the mutability\r\nof human affairs, “I hookt that book from a feller named Abe Williams,\r\nto the Home, down to Providence, ’bout five year ago. His name was\r\nin’t, but I tore it out. I wonder what’s become on him now; dead,—as\r\nlike as not” (puts it up and takes out his pipe); “well, God’ll have\r\nmercy on his soul, I hope.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n        ON SOUNDINGS.—ENGLISH SMALL CRAFT.—HARBOUR OF LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _Sunday, May 25th._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAPE CLEAR.—GALE._]\r\n\r\nAt sunset yesterday the mate went to the royal yard to look for land,\r\nbut could not see it. By our reckoning we were off Mizzen Head, a point\r\nto the westward of Cape Clear, steering east by south, fresh wind and\r\nrising, going nine knots, thick weather and rain. Several gannets (a\r\nkind of goose with white body and black wings) were about us. Some\r\none said they would probably go to land to spend the night, and there\r\nwas pleasure in being so made to realize our vicinity to it. Several\r\nvessels were in sight, all running inside us, and steering northeast.\r\nWe thought our captain over anxious to give Cape Clear a wide berth,\r\nand were very sorry not to make the land before dark. After sunset\r\nit grew thicker, and the wind, which had been increasing all day, by\r\nmidnight was a gale. He got all sail in but the reefed topsails; then\r\nhove-to, and found bottom in fifty-five fathoms. I was quite satisfied\r\nnow with the captain’s prudence; the sea was running high, and the\r\ncliffs of Ireland could not be many miles distant. As it was, I felt\r\nperfectly safe, and turned in, sleeping soundly till nine o’clock this\r\nmorning. About an hour later they made the light on the old Head of\r\nKinsale, where the Albion was lost some thirty years since. The captain\r\nsays we passed within ten miles of Cape Clear light without seeing it.\r\nHe was just right in his reckoning, and the vessels that went inside\r\nof us were all wrong, and he thinks must have got into trouble. We are\r\nnow nearly up to Waterford, and off a harbour where, many years ago, a\r\nfrigate was lost, with fifteen hundred men. It is foggy yet, and we can\r\nonly see the _loom_ of the land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                     _Monday, May 27th._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLISH CHANNEL._]\r\n\r\nThe Channel yesterday was thick with vessels, and I was much interested\r\nin watching them. A collier brig, beating down Channel, passed close\r\nunder our stern. We were going along so steadily before it that I had\r\nnot before thought of the violence of the wind. It was amazing to see\r\nhow she was tossed about. Plunging from the height of the sea, her\r\nwhite figure-head would divide the water and entirely disappear, and\r\nfor a moment it would seem as if some monster below had seized her\r\nbowsprit and was taking her down head foremost; then her stern would\r\ndrop, a great white sheet of spray dash up, wetting her foresail almost\r\nto the foretop; then she would swing up again, and on the crest of the\r\nbillow seem to stop and shake herself, as a dog does on coming out of\r\nthe surf; then, as the wind acted on her, she would fall suddenly over\r\nto leeward, and a long curtain of white foam from the scuppers would\r\nbe dropped over her glistening black sides. It was very beautiful, and\r\nfrom our quiet though rapid progress, showed the superior comfort of a\r\nlarge ship very strikingly. We have not rolled or pitched enough during\r\nall the passage to make it necessary to lash the furniture in our room.\r\nAfterwards we saw a Welsh schooner, then a French lugger with three\r\nmasts, then a cutter with one, all quite different in rig and cut of\r\nsail from any thing we ever see on our coast.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock we sighted Tuscar light, and could see beyond it,\r\nthrough the fog, a dark, broken streak, on which we _imagined_ (as the\r\ndull-eyed said) darker spots of wood and lighter spots of houses, and\r\nwhich we called Ireland. We saw also at some distance the steamer which\r\nleft Liverpool the day before for Cork. She was very long and low, and\r\nmore clipper-like in her appearance than our sea-going steamers of the\r\nsame class. At sunset we were out of sight of land again and driving\r\non at a glorious rate, passing rapidly by several large British ships\r\ngoing the same course.\r\n\r\nI was up two or three times during the night, and found the captain\r\nall the while on deck in his India-rubber clothes, the mate on the\r\nforecastle, look-outs aloft, every thing drawing finely, and nothing\r\nto be seen around us but fog, foam, and fire-flashing surges. At three\r\no’clock this morning, John called me, and I again came on deck. It was\r\nstill misty, but there was LAND—dark and distinct against the eastern\r\nglow—no more “imagination.” It was only a large, dark ledge of rocks,\r\nwith a white light-house, and a streak of white foam separating between\r\nit and the dark blue of the sea; but it seemed thrillingly beautiful.\r\nIn a few minutes the fog opened on our quarter, and disclosed, a few\r\nmiles off, a great, sublime mountain, its base in the water, its head\r\nin the clouds. The rock was the Skerrys; the mountain, Holyhead. Very\r\nsoon, high, dark hills, piled together confusedly, dimly appeared on\r\nour right—dimly and confused, but real, substantial, unmistakable solid\r\nground—none of your fog-banks! These were on the island of Anglesea.\r\nThen, as the ship moved slowly on, for the wind was lulling, past\r\nthe Skerrys, the fog closed down and hid it all again, and we went\r\nbelow to dress. When again we came up it was much lighter, and the\r\nbrown hills of Anglesea were backed up by the blue mountains of Wales\r\ndistinct against the grey cloud behind them. Soon a white dot or two\r\ncame out, and the brown hill-sides became green, with only _patches_ of\r\ndark brown—_ploughed ground_—real old mother earth. As it grew still\r\nlighter, the white spots took dark roofs, and coming to Point Linos, a\r\ntelegraph station was pointed out to us; our signal was hoisted, and in\r\nfive minutes we had spoken our name to a man in Liverpool. We had just\r\nbegun to distinguish the _hedgerows_, when there was a sudden flash\r\nof light, disclosing the cottage windows, and Charley, looking east,\r\nexclaimed, “THE SUN OF THE OLD WORLD.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PILOT.—STEAM-TUG._]\r\n\r\nA long, narrow, awkward ugly thing—a cross of a canal-boat with\r\na Mystic fishing-smack—with a single short mast, a high-peaked\r\nmainsail, a narrow staysail coming to the stem-head, and without any\r\nbowsprit; so out from the last fog-bank like an apparition comes the\r\npilot-boat. Directly she makes more sail, and runs rapidly towards us.\r\nOur yachtman-passenger, coming on deck, calls her by name, and says\r\nthat she is here considered a model of beauty, and that a portrait\r\nof her has been published. To say the right thing for her, she does\r\nlook stanch and weatherly, the sort of craft altogether, if he were\r\nconfined to her tonnage, and more mindful of comfort than of time,\r\nthat one might choose to make a winter’s cruise in off Hatteras, or to\r\nbang through the ice after Sir John Franklin. The pilot she has now\r\nsent aboard of us does not, in his appearance, contrast unfavourably\r\nwith our own pilots, as travellers have generally remarked Liverpool\r\npilots do. He is an intelligent, burly, sharp-voiced Englishman—a\r\nreliable-looking sort of man, only rather too dressy for his work. He\r\nbrings no news; pilots never do. When we took on board the New York\r\npilot, in my passage from the East Indies, we had had no intelligence\r\nfrom home for more than six months. The greatest news the pilot had for\r\nus, turned out to be that another edition of Blunt’s Coast Pilot was\r\nout. I contrived to keep myself within earshot of him and the captain,\r\nas they conversed for half an hour after he came on our deck, and this\r\nwas all I could learn, and except the late arrivals and departures\r\nand losses of vessels, this was all we got from him for two days. Our\r\nLiverpool pilot, however, brings us a Price Current and Shipping-List\r\nnewspaper, in which we find an allusion to “the unfavorable news from\r\nFrance” as affecting the state of trade, but whether it is of floods,\r\nhurricanes, or revolutions, there is no knowing. In the same way we\r\nunderstand that the loyal English nation are blessed with another baby\r\nprince, and are stopping their mills to give God thanks for it. There\r\nis a slight fall in cotton too reported, and since he read of it, our\r\nNew Orleans man has been very busy figuring and writing letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGLISH COASTER (_calm_)]\r\n\r\nAfter the pilot came the first English shower (“It’s a fine day,” says\r\nthe boatman, just now coming on board—we have only had three showers\r\nthis forenoon), and then it fell calm, and the ship loitered as if\r\nfatigued with her long journey. It is now noon, and while I am writing,\r\na low, black, business-like scullion of a steamboat has caught hold of\r\nthe ship, and means to get her up to the docks before night. On her\r\npaddle-boxes are the words in letters once white, and the only thing\r\npretending to be white about her, “The Steam-Tug Company’s Boat, No. 5,\r\nthe _Liver_ of Liverpool.” Long life to her then, for she is a friendly\r\nhand stretched out from the shore to welcome us. A good-looking little\r\nboat too she is, much better fitted for her business than our New York\r\ntow-boats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                             _May 28th._\r\n\r\nWe were several hours in getting up to town yesterday, after I\r\nhad written you. Long before any thing else could be seen of it\r\nbut a thick black cloud—black as a thunder-cloud, and waving and\r\ndarkening one way and the other, as if from a volcano—our approach\r\nto a great focus of commerce was indicated by the numbers which\r\nwe met of elegant, graceful, well-equipped and ship-shape-looking\r\nsteamers, numerous ships—graceful spider-rigged New York liners, and\r\nsturdy quarter-galleried, carved and gilt, pot-sided, Bristol built,\r\nstump-to’-gallant-masted old English East-Indiamen (both alive with\r\ncheering emigrants, hopeful of Australian and Michiganian riches, and\r\nyet defiant of sea-sickness), dropping down with the tide, or jerked\r\nalong by brave little steam-tugs, each belching from her chimney, long,\r\ndense, swelling volumes of smoke; with hosts of small craft lounging\r\nlazily along, under all sorts of sooty canvass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SAILING CRAFT OF THE CHANNEL._]\r\n\r\nThese small craft are all painted dead black, and you cannot imagine\r\nhow clumsy they are. The greater part of them are single masted, as\r\nI described the pilot-boat to be. In addition to the mainsail and\r\nfore-staysail (an in-board jib), they set a very large gaff topsail,\r\nhoisting as a flying sail, with a gaff crossing the topmast (like our\r\nmen-of-war’s boat sails), their bowsprit is a spar rigging out and in,\r\nlike a steering sail-boom, and with this they stretch out an enormous\r\njib, nearly as long in the foot as in the hoist, and of this too,\r\nbefore the wind, some of them make a beam-sail. If it blows fresh, they\r\ncan shorten in their bowsprit and set a smaller jib; and about the time\r\nour sloops would be knotting their second reef and taking their bonnets\r\noff, they have their bowsprit all in board, their long topmast struck,\r\nand make themselves comfortable under the staysail and a two-reefed\r\nmainsail. If it comes on to blow still harder, when ours must trust\r\nto a scud, they will still be jumping through it with a little storm\r\nstaysail, and a _balance-reefed_ mainsail as shown in the cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGLISH COASTER (_squalls_)]\r\n\r\nThese single-masted vessels are called cutters, not sloops (a proper\r\nsloop I did not see in England); and our word cutter, wrongly applied\r\nto the revenue schooners, is derived from the English term, revenue\r\ncutter, the armed vessels of the British preventive service, being\r\nproperly cutters. Cutters frequently carry yards and square sails.\r\nWe saw one to-day with square-sail, topsail, top-gallant, and royal\r\nset. I have heard old men say that when they were boys, our coasting\r\nsloops used to have these sails, and before the revolution our small\r\ncraft were, not uncommonly, also cutter-rigged. Instead of being of\r\nwhitewashed cotton, the sails of the coasters here are _tanned_ hemp,\r\nhaving the appearance, at a little distance, of old worn brown velvet.\r\nIn sailing qualities the advantage is every way with us; in the build,\r\nthe rig, and in the cut, as well as the material of the sails; for our\r\ncotton duck will hold the wind a great deal the best. Ninety-nine in\r\na hundred of our single-masted market-boats, in a light wind, would\r\nrun around the fastest coaster in the Mersey with the greatest ease.\r\nThey are not calculated at all for working to windward, but are stiff\r\nand weatherly, and do very well for boxing through the Channel, I\r\nsuppose; but for such business we should rig schooner fashion, and\r\nsave the expense of an extra hand, which must be wanted to handle\r\ntheir heavy mainsail and boom. Further up, we saw on the beach several\r\ncutter-rigged yachts. They were wide of beam, broad sterned, sharp\r\nbuilt, and deep, like our sea-going clippers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARRIVAL AT LIVERPOOL._]\r\n\r\nThe immediate shores grew low as we entered the Mersey. It was nearly\r\ncalm, but though the surface of the water was glassy smooth, it was\r\nstill heaving with the long muscular swell of the sea until we reached\r\nthe town. We approached nearer the land, where, on the right hand,\r\nthere was a bluff point, bare of trees, with large rocks cropping out\r\nat its base; beneath the rocks a broad, hard, sand beach, and low on\r\nthe water’s edge, a castle of dark-brown stone, the only artificial\r\ndefence, that I noticed, of the harbour. The high ground was occupied\r\nby villas belonging to merchants of Liverpool, and the place is called\r\nNew Brighton, and bearing a resemblance to our New Brighton. There is\r\nthe same barrenness of foliage, and some similarity in the style of\r\nthe houses, though there are none so outrageously out of taste as some\r\nof those that obtrude upon the scenery of Staten Island, and none so\r\npretty as some of the less prominent there.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the cloud that had hitherto interrupted our view in\r\nfront, we could see, on the left, many tall chimneys and steeples,\r\nand soon discerned forests of masts. On the right, the bank continued\r\nrural and charming, with all the fresh light verdure of spring. Below\r\nit we could distinctly see, and quite amusing it was, many people,\r\nmostly women and children, riding donkeys and driving pony-carriages\r\non the beach. It seemed strange that they did not stop to look at us.\r\nThere were bathing-wagons too, drawn by a horse out into three or four\r\nfeet water, and women floundering into it out of them and getting back\r\nagain very hastily, as if they found it colder than they had expected.\r\nWe approached incomplete structures of stone-work along the water’s\r\nedge, in which men and horses were clustering like bees. Soon we passed\r\nthem, and were looking up at the immense walls of the docks, each with\r\nits city of shipping securely floating fifteen or twenty feet higher\r\nthan the water on which we were, it being now low ebb. At five, in the\r\nrumble and roar of the town, our anchor dropped. The ship could not\r\nhaul into the docks until midnight tide, and the steam-tug took us, who\r\nwished it, to the shore, landing us across the Dublin steamer at the\r\nPrince’s Dock quay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST OF ENGLAND.—THE STREETS.—A RAILWAY STATION.—THE DOCKS AT\r\n    NIGHT.—PROSTITUTES.—TEMPERANCE.—THE STILL LIFE OF LIVERPOOL.\r\n    —A MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of the gang-plank stood a policeman, easily recognised and\r\nfamiliar, thanks to Punch, who politely helped us to land, thus giving\r\nus immediate occasion to thank the government for its hospitality, and\r\nits regard for our safety and convenience. It was a real pleasure to\r\nstamp upon the neat, firm, solid mason-work of the dock, and we could\r\nnot but be mindful of the shabby log-wharves we had stumbled over as\r\nwe left New York. We were immediately beset by porters, not rudely,\r\nbut with serious, anxious deference and care to keep a way open before\r\nus. I was assisting a lady, and carried her bag; a man followed me\r\npertinaciously. “I tell you I have no baggage,” said I. “But, sir, this\r\nbag?” “Oh, I can carry that.” “Excuse me, sir; you must not, indeed;\r\n_gentlemen_ never does so in _this country_.” After handing the lady\r\ninto a hackney-coach, we walked on. The landing-place was spacious, not\r\nencumbered with small buildings or piles of freight, and though there\r\nwas a little rain falling, there was a smooth, clean stone pavement,\r\nfree from mud, to walk upon. There was a slight smell of bituminous\r\nsmoke in the air, not disagreeable, but, to me, highly pleasant. I\r\nsnuffed it as if passing a field of new-mown hay—snuffed and pondered,\r\nand at last was brought to my mind the happy fireside of the friend,\r\nin the indistinct memory of which this peculiar odour of English coal\r\nhad been gratefully associated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LIVERPOOL.—RAILWAY STATION._]\r\n\r\nComing on shore with no luggage or any particular business to engage\r\nour attention, we plunged adventurously into the confused tide of\r\nlife with which the busy streets were thronged, careless whither it\r\nfloated us. Emerging from the crowd of porters, hackmen, policemen, and\r\nragged Irish men and women on the dock, we entered the first street\r\nthat opened before us. On the corner stood a church—not un-American\r\nin its appearance—and we passed without stopping to the next corner,\r\nwhere we paused to look at the dray-horses, immensely heavy and in\r\nelegant condition, fat and glossy, and docile and animated in their\r\nexpression. They were harnessed, generally, in couples, one before\r\nanother, to great, strong, low-hung carts, heavy enough alone to be\r\na load for one of our cartmen’s light horses. Catching the bustling\r\nspirit of the crowd, we walked on at a quick pace, looking at the\r\nfaces of the men we met more than any thing else, until we came to a\r\nwall of hewn drab stone, some fifteen feet high, with a handsomely\r\ncut balustrade at the top. There was a large gateway in it, from\r\nwhich a policeman was driving away some children. People were going\r\nin and out, and we followed in to see what it was. Up stairs, we\r\nfound ourselves on a broad terrace, with a handsome building, in\r\nTuscan style, fronting upon it. Another policeman here informed us\r\nthat it was a railway station. The door was opened as we approached\r\nit by a man in a simple uniform, who asked us where we were going.\r\nWe answered that we merely wished to look at the building. “Walk in,\r\ngentlemen; you will best take the right-hand platform, and return by\r\nthe other.” A train was backing in; a man in the same uniform stood\r\nin the rear car, and moved his hand round as if turning an imaginary\r\ndriving-wheel, the engine at the other end being governed by his\r\nmotions:—forward—slower—slower—faster—slower—stop—back. The train\r\nstopped, the doors were unlocked by men in a more brilliant uniform,\r\nand there was a great rush of passengers to secure good seats. Women\r\nwith bundles and band-boxes were shoved this way and that, as they\r\nstruggled to hoist themselves into the doors; their parcels were\r\nknocked out of their hands, porters picked them up and threw them in,\r\nreckless where. So bewildered and flustered did they all seem to be,\r\nthat we could not refrain from trying to assist them. There was nothing\r\nin the plan or fittings of the building that needs remark, and we soon\r\nreturned to the terrace, where we remained some time observing the\r\npeculiarities of the houses and the people passing in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nGoing into the street again we wandered on till it was quite dark,\r\nwith no other object but to get a general impression of the character\r\nof the town. We looked into a few houses where we saw a sign of “Clean\r\nand well-aired beds,” and found that we should have no difficulty in\r\ngetting comfortable lodgings at a very moderate price. From nine until\r\ntwelve we were waiting at the dock for the ship to haul in, or trying\r\nin vain to get a boat to go on board of her. There were many vessels\r\nlaying near the great gates, all standing by, when they should be\r\nopened at high-water, to be hauled in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PROSTITUTES.—SAILORS._]\r\n\r\nThe broad promenade outside the dock walls was occupied by the\r\npolice, stevedores, watermen, boarding-house keepers, and a crowd of\r\nwomen, waiting to help in the ships or to receive their crews when\r\nthe tide should have risen enough to admit them. I was surprised at\r\nthe quietness and decency of these “sailors’ wives,” as they called\r\nthemselves; they were plainly and generally neatly dressed, and talked\r\nquietly and in kind tones to each other, and I heard no loud profanity\r\nor ribaldry at all. Whether this was owing to the presence of the\r\npolice I cannot say, but I am sure it would be impossible to find,\r\nin America, vice, shame, and misery so entirely unassociated with\r\ndrunkenness or excitement and riot. They were not as young as girls of\r\nthe same sort in the streets of New York, and in the strong gas-light\r\ntheir faces seemed expressive of a quite different character; generally\r\nthey were pensive and sad, but not ill-natured or stupid. It occurred\r\nto me that their degradation must have been reached in a different way,\r\nand had not brought with it that outcasting from all good which they\r\nwould suffer with us. As they stood, companioned together with each\r\nother, but friendless, some with not even hats to protect them from the\r\nrain, others, with their gowns drawn up over their head, and others,\r\ntwo together, under a scanty shawl, it would have been difficult, I\r\nthought, for a woman, who is always found most unforgiving of her\r\nsister’s sin, not to have been softened towards those abandoned thus\r\nto seek support of life that night. We could not but think the kind\r\nwords with which the sailors recognised and greeted them, as the ships\r\nhauled near, were as much dictated by pity and sympathy as by any worse\r\nimpulses. They said, “If nobody else cares for you, we do.” If nobody\r\nelse is waiting to welcome us, we know that you will be glad that\r\nwe are coming to the land once more, so, cheer up, and we will help\r\neach other again to enjoy a short space of jollity, excitement, and\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nThere is a benevolent enterprise on foot here for shipping these\r\nvictims of frailty by wholesale to Australia. A strange way, it seems,\r\nto think of peopling a new Anglo-Saxon world; but who is prouder of\r\nhis ancestry than your Virginian, whose colony, it is thought, was\r\noriginally furnished in much the same way with mothers? The fact that\r\nthe project is favoured by intelligent, practical, religious men,\r\nis gratifying, and the remarks they are reported as making in public\r\nmeetings on the subject, indicate a hopeful appreciation of the effect\r\nof circumstances upon character.\r\n\r\nTired of waiting for the ship, and a good deal fatigued with our tramps\r\non the pavements, about half-past twelve we went back into the town,\r\nand by the very obliging assistance of the policemen found lodgings in\r\na “Temperance Hotel,” still open at that late hour. We were a little\r\nsurprised to find a number of men in the coffee-room drinking beer\r\nand smoking. The subject of their conversation was some project of an\r\nassociation of working-men to combine their savings, and make more\r\nprofitable investment of them than could be made of the small amounts\r\nof each separately. There were late newspapers on the table, and we sat\r\nup some time longer to read them, but they were still at it, puffing\r\nand drinking, and earnestly discussing how they could best use their\r\nmoney, when we went up to bed. We had good beds in pleasant rooms for\r\nwhich we paid twenty-five cents each.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we got our trunks from the ship, the custom-house\r\nofficers searching them before they left the dockyard. Books, letters,\r\nand daguerreotypes were examined minutely, but the officers were very\r\ncivil and accommodating; so also were the cartmen that took them to the\r\ninn for us. The expense of getting our luggage through the searching\r\noffice, and carting it a mile, was only twenty-five cents for each\r\ntrunk, and “tuppence for beer.”\r\n\r\nWe went to a small lodging-house that we had examined last night,\r\nand found neat and comfortable, and kept by an agreeable woman. We\r\nhave a large front room, comfortably furnished, and down stairs is a\r\nquiet parlor and dining-room. We breakfast in the house, and dine and\r\nsup at eating shops. The whole cost of living so we make but about\r\nseventy-five cents each a day. As good entertainment would cost more\r\nthan that in New York. We have made a few purchases of clothing, and\r\nfind every thing we want cheaper than in New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         _Liverpool, Tuesday, 28th May._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COST OF LIVING.—BUILDING MATERIALS._]\r\n\r\nThe common building material here is a light, greyish-red brick. Stone\r\nof different colours is used in about the same proportion that it is\r\nin New York. The warehouses are generally higher than the same class\r\nof buildings there, but the dwelling-houses lower, seldom over three\r\nstories. The old houses, in narrow streets, are generally small, and\r\noften picturesque from the carvings of time upon them, or from the\r\nincongruous additions and improvements that have been made to them\r\nat intervals. At the railway station we noticed such differences in\r\nthe windows of a two-story house near us, as these. There were two\r\nbelow; one of these, being a shop front, was entirely modern, with\r\nlarge panes of glass in light wooden sashes. The other was of small\r\npanes, set in heavy wood-work, such as you see in our oldest houses.\r\nOne of the upper windows had small square panes set in lead; those of\r\nthe other were _lozenge_-shaped, and in neither were they more than\r\nthree inches wide. The frames were much wider than they were high, and\r\nthey opened sideways. In the newer part of the city, the fashionable\r\nquarter, there are a good many brick-walled houses faced with _stucco_.\r\nOthers are of Bath stone, and these are not unfrequently _painted_ over\r\nof the original colour of the stone. Bath stone, which is the most\r\ncommon material of mason work, is a fine-grained freestone, very easy\r\nto the chisel. It is furnished much cheaper than our brown stone, so\r\nmuch so that there would be a chance of exporting it to America with\r\nprofit. There is a finer sort of it, called by the masons Caen stone,\r\nwhich is brought from Normandy. The colour of both is at first buff,\r\nbut rapidly changes to a dark brown. There are some buildings of red\r\nsandstone, of a little lighter colour than that now so much used in New\r\nYork. In buildings mainly of brick, stone is used more considerably\r\nthan with us; and there are none of those equivocating, sanded-wood\r\nparapets, porticos, steps, &c.; all is the _real grit_. The bricks are\r\nmottled, half red and half greyish yellow; the effect, at a little\r\ndistance, being as I said a yellow or greyish red, much pleasanter than\r\nthe bright red colour of our Eastern brick. Every thing out of doors\r\nhere soon gets _toned down_, as the artists say, by the smoke. Perhaps\r\nit is partly on this account that pure white paint is never used; but\r\nthe prevailing taste is evidently for darker colours than with us. The\r\ncommon hues of the furniture and fitting up of shops, for instance, is\r\nnearly as dark as old mahogany. This gives even the dram-shops such a\r\nrich, substantial look, that we can hardly recognise them as of the\r\nsame species as our tawdry “saloons,” that are so painted, gilded,\r\nand bedizened to catch flies with their flare. There are no “oyster\r\ncellars,” but oysters “raw and in the shell,” are exposed in stands\r\nabout the street, like those of our “hot corn,” and apple women. Liquor\r\nshops, always with the ominous sign of “_Vaults_,” are very frequent,\r\nand often splendid. The tea and coffee shops are among the richest in\r\nthe streets. The bakers’ fronts are also generally showy, and there\r\nare a great many of them. It seems to be the general custom, for poor\r\nfamilies at least, to make their own bread, and send it in to them to\r\nbe baked. The first night we were ashore, we got some bread and butter,\r\nand American cheese, at a baker’s, and saw in ten minutes a dozen\r\nloaves called for. They had sheet-iron checks, with numbers on them,\r\nwhich were given up on the presentation of a corresponding check, and,\r\nfor a loaf of ten or twelve pounds, a penny for baking—in the same way\r\nthat passengers’ baggage is checked on our railroads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LIVERPOOL.—STREETS._]\r\n\r\nWood is used in the interior of houses more than I had imagined it\r\nwould be. Its cost is high. I inquired the price of what looked like\r\na common “Albany board,” such as I buy in New York for sixteen cents;\r\nit was of the value of about thirty five cents. The kitchens, as far\r\nas we have observed, are on the street floor, level with the living\r\napartments. Coarse pottery and wicker-work utensils are more common\r\nthan with us. Few of the houses in the town have trees about them.\r\nOccasionally an old mansion is set a little back, and has a little\r\nshrubby foliage in front of it—most commonly of elms dwarfed to the\r\nsize and natural shape of a green-gage plum-tree. There are, though, in\r\nthe better part of the town, some most charming public grounds. I have\r\nnever seen any thing in America to compare with them. I will speak of\r\nthem more particularly at another time.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ground on which the town is built is irregular,\r\nand the streets crooked and running at every angle with each other.\r\nGenerally they are short, and if long, at every few blocks the names\r\nare changed. The names are often singular; many, far apart, have the\r\nsame with different prefixes, as Great and Little, North and South,\r\n&c. We are in “Great Cross Hall street;” after a slight turn it is\r\ncalled “Tythe Barn street,” and further on Chapel street. _Tythe Barn_,\r\nI understand, is derived from the name of the building in which the\r\ntithes were deposited when they were taken in kind—a tenth of the hay,\r\nwheat, poultry, &c. There is a steep ascent near us called “Shaw’s\r\nBrow;” it is fitted with smooth stone tracks for cart-wheels, with\r\nnarrow stones between them set _on end_ for the horses’ feet, double\r\nteams here generally going _tandem_. The best streets are paved, as in\r\nNew York, only one quarter the distance across them, the intermediate\r\nspace being macadamized. This makes a very pleasant road. There is\r\ngenerally a wide sidewalk, which is flagged as in our cities; but in\r\nthe commercial streets it is oftener paved like the carriage-way, and\r\nin the narrowest there is none at all. The streets are very clean, and\r\nall the side-walks, gutters, and untravelled spaces appear to be swept\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MARKETS.—ECONOMIES.—HOURS._]\r\n\r\nI have been through two markets. One of them is an immensely large\r\nbuilding, covering about two acres, right in the centre of the town;\r\nit is clean, light, and well ventilated. What a wonder it is that the\r\npeople of New York will put up with such miserable, filthy, crowded\r\nhovels as their markets are! In this building there are over five\r\nhundred stalls and tables. It has its own superintendant of weights\r\nand measures, and a thorough and constant police. There are twelve men\r\nwhose employment is to keep it clean. The garbage is passed readily\r\nthrough traps into vaults below, from which it is removed at night. The\r\nrules for those who use it, are excellent to secure healthy condition\r\nof food, neatness, order, and fair play, and they are strictly\r\nenforced. To my mind, this structure, and the arrangements connected\r\nwith it, is an honour to Liverpool, not second to her docks. And she\r\nhas three other large public markets, besides small ones for particular\r\npurposes. The meat stalls are frequently owned by women, and, except a\r\nbetter supply of birds and rabbits, did not offer any thing different\r\nfrom those of our butchers. A part of the market seemed to be occupied\r\nby country women for the sale of miscellaneous wares.\r\n\r\nThe fish market was in another building, which was entirely occupied\r\nby women, nice and neat, though skinning eels and cleaning fish. The\r\nmilk market also seemed to be altogether in the hands of women. Milk\r\nis not peddled about as in New York, but sold from cellar-shops. If\r\none wants a cup of tea, our landlady runs across the street for a\r\npenny-worth of it. “From hand to mouth” so, seems to be common with\r\nmany things. The material for our breakfast is mostly bought after we\r\nhave ordered it. As we did not mention what we would have till after\r\nthe shops were closed last night, we had to wait till nine o’clock for\r\nit this morning. Business hours begin later than in America. I think\r\nthe market is not open till eight, which they speak of as “very early.”\r\nIn this respect we have found no difficulty in accommodating ourselves\r\nto English customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE PEOPLE AT  LIVERPOOL.—POVERTY.—MERCHANTS.—SHOPKEEPERS.—\r\n    WOMEN.—SOLDIERS.—CHILDREN.—DONKEYS AND DRAY HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LIVERPOOL PEOPLE._]\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the most general features of the town which, at first\r\nsight, on landing in Europe from New York, strike me as peculiar.\r\nHaving given you its still life, you will wish me to people it.\r\n\r\nAfter we had wandered for about an hour through the streets the\r\nfirst afternoon we were ashore, I remarked that we had not yet seen\r\na single well-dressed man, not one person that in America would have\r\nbeen described as “of respectable appearance.” We were astonished to\r\nobserve with what an unmingled stream of poverty the streets were\r\nswollen, and J. remarked that if what we had seen was a fair indication\r\nof the general condition of the masses here, he should hardly feel\r\njustified in dissuading them from using violent and anarchical means\r\nto bring down to themselves a share of the opportunities and comforts\r\nof those “higher classes” that seem to be so utterly separated from\r\nthem. There are a great many Irish in Liverpool, but the most that\r\nwe had thus far seen evidently were English, yet not English as we\r\nhave known them. Instead of the stout, full-faced John Bulls, we had\r\nseen but few that were not thin, meagre, and pale. There was somewhat\r\nrarely an appearance of actual misery, but a stupid, hopeless,\r\nstate-prison-for-life sort of expression. There were not unfrequently\r\nsome exceptions to this, but these were men almost invariably in some\r\nuniform or livery, as railroad hands, servants, and soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in the court-yard of the Exchange (the regular\r\n’Change assemblage seemed to meet out of doors), we saw a large\r\ncollection of the merchants. There was nothing to distinguish them\r\nfrom a company of a similar kind with us, beyond a general Englishness\r\nof features and an entire absence of all _oddities_—with astonishing\r\nbeards and singularities of costume. One young man only wore small\r\nclothes and leggins, which would perhaps have disagreeably subjected\r\nhim to be noticed with us. They were stouter than our merchants, and\r\nmore chubby-faced, yet not looking in vigorous health. They were, on\r\nthe whole, judging by a glance at their outsides, to be more respected\r\nthan any lot of men of the same number that I ever saw together in\r\nWall street. Many of them, and most of the well-dressed men that we\r\nhave seen in the streets, have had a green leaf and simple _posy_ in a\r\nbutton-hole of their coats.\r\n\r\nThe shopkeepers of the better class, or retail merchants, are exactly\r\nthe same men, to all appearance, that stand behind the counters with\r\nus. _Merchant_, means only a wholesale dealer in England; retailers are\r\n_shopkeepers_. The word _store_ is never applied to a building; but the\r\nbuilding in which goods are stored is a _warehouse_.\r\n\r\nWomen are more employed in trade than with us; I have no doubt\r\nwith every way great advantage. The women in the streets are more\r\nnoticeably different from ours than the men. In general, they are very\r\ncheaply and coarsely clad. Many of the lower class have their outer\r\ngarments ordinarily drawn up behind, in the scrubbing-floor fashion.\r\nCaps are universally worn, and being generally nice and white, they\r\nhave a pleasant effect upon the face. The very poorest women look\r\nvery miserably. We see bruised eyes not unfrequently, and there is\r\nevidently a good deal of hard drinking among them. They are larger\r\nand stouter, and have coarser features. There are neither as many\r\npretty nor as many ugly faces as with us; indeed, there are very few\r\nremarkably ill-favoured in that respect, and almost none strikingly\r\nhandsome. The best faces we have seen were among the fish-stalls in\r\nmarket. With scarcely an exception, the fish-women were very large and\r\ntall, and though many of them were in the neighbourhood of fifty, they\r\nhad invariably full, bright, unwrinkled faces, beautiful red cheeks,\r\nand a cheerful expression. English women, generally, appear more bold\r\nand self-reliant, their _action_ is more energetic, and their carriage\r\nless graceful and drooping than ours. Those well dressed that we have\r\nseen, while _shopping_, for instance, are no exceptions. Those we have\r\nmet to converse with are as modest and complaisant as could be desired,\r\nyet speak with a marked promptness and confidence which is animating\r\nand attractive. We met a small company last night at the residence of a\r\ngentleman to whom we had a letter, and spent the evening precisely as\r\nwe should at a small tea-party at home; we might easily have imagined\r\nourselves in New England. The gentlemen were no way different, that we\r\nnoticed, from cultivated men with us, and the ladies only seemed rather\r\nmore frank, hearty, and sincere-natured than we should expect ours to\r\nbe to strangers.[2] There was nothing in their dresses that I can think\r\nof as peculiar, yet a general air, not American—a heavier look and more\r\n_crinkles_, and darker and more mixed-up colours. We see many rather\r\nnice-looking females, probably coming in from the country, driving\r\nthemselves about town as if they understood it, in jaunty-looking\r\nchaises and spring-carts. As J. and I were standing this noon by\r\nthe window of a curiosity-shop, a lady addressed us: “This is very\r\ncurious; have you noticed it?” (pointing at something within the\r\nwindow). “I wish you would help me to read what is written upon it.”\r\nShe spoke exactly as if she _belonged to our party_. She was not young\r\nor gayly-dressed, but had all the appearance and used the language of\r\na well-bred and educated woman. We conversed with her for a minute or\r\ntwo about the article, which was some specimen of Australian natural\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[2] These ladies were Irish. The remark hardly applies to English\r\nladies, certainly not unless you meet them domestically. The English in\r\ntheir _homes_, and the English “_in company_,” are singularly opposite\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many soldiers moving about in fine undress uniforms;\r\none regiment is in blue, which I did not suppose the British ever\r\nused. The men look well—more intelligent than you would suppose. Many\r\nare quite old, grey-headed, and all are very neat and orderly in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHILDREN’S DRESS.—DONKEYS._]\r\n\r\nThe children look really _punchy_. It strikes me the young ones are\r\ndressed much older, while the young men are clothed much more boyishly\r\nthan in America. Quite large children, of both sexes, are dressed\r\nexactly alike, and whether girls or boys (they look between both), you\r\ncannot guess—girls with fur hats, such as full-grown men wear, and boys\r\nin short dresses and pantalettes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are lots of the queerest little donkeys in the streets; some of\r\nthem would not weigh more than Nep (my Newfoundland dog), and most of\r\nthem are not as large as our two-year-old steers. They are made to\r\ndraw most enormous loads. I saw one tugging a load of coal, on the top\r\nof which two stout Irishmen sat, and stopped them to ask the weight.\r\nIt was 1200 (besides themselves), and the top of the donkey’s back\r\nwas just even with my waist. The driver said he bought her five years\r\nago for two pounds ($10), and she was then called an old one. Here\r\nis one now coming up the hill with a great load of furniture, a man\r\non behind it, and a boy on the shafts—a poor little rat of a thing,\r\nwith the meekest expression you can conceive of. It is just as much\r\nas he can stagger along with, and the boy jumps off to relieve—no!\r\nthe young satan has gone to his head and is cudgelling him. The poor\r\nlittle donkey winks and turns his head, and drops his ears, and nearly\r\nfalls down. The boy stops (probably a policeman heaves in sight) and\r\ntakes his seat on the shaft again, and the donkey reels on. The man\r\naft has continued his smoking all the while, without taking any notice\r\nof the delay. As I write, there goes by another—a very handsome, large\r\nfat one, drawing a market cart, with a pretty country girl among the\r\nhampers driving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  LIVERPOOL CONTINUED.—IRISH BEGGARS.—CONDITION OF LABOURERS.—COST\r\n    OF LIVING.—PRICES.—BATH HOUSE.—QUARANTINE.—THE DOCKS.—STREET\r\n    SCENE.—“COMING YANKEE” OVER NONSENSE.—ARTISTIC BEGGING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEGGARS.—PLACARD._]\r\n\r\nI have learned nothing reliable about the price of labour here; the\r\nIrish emigration keeps it lower in Liverpool than elsewhere. This\r\nreminds me of beggars, and of a placard posted everywhere about the\r\nstreets to-day. The beggars are not very frequent, and are mostly poor,\r\npitiable, sickly women, carrying half-naked babies. The placard is\r\nas follows:—“The SELECT VESTRY inform their fellow-citizens, that in\r\nconsequence of the extremely low price of passage from Ireland—4_d._ (8\r\ncts.), great numbers are coming here apparently with no other object\r\nthan to beg. They earnestly desire that nothing should be given them.”\r\nAs a specimen, they mention the following: an Irish woman, pretending\r\nto be a widow, was taken up, who had obtained 3_s._ 2_d._ (80 cts.) in\r\nan hour and a half after her arrival. Her husband was found already in\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\nThe people all seem to be enjoying life more, or else to be much more\r\nmiserable than in America.[3] The labourers seem haggard and stupid,\r\nand all with whom I have talked, say a poor man can hardly live here.\r\nThere is a strong anti-free-trade growling among them, and they\r\ncomplain much of the repeal of the Navigation Laws, asserting that\r\nAmerican ships are now getting business that was formerly in the hands\r\nof the English alone, and so American sailors do the labour in the\r\ndocks which was formerly given to the stevedores and working-men of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[3] I was surprised to find this remark in my first letter from\r\nLiverpool, for it is the precise counterpart of my impression on\r\nlanding again in the United States, after six months absence in Europe.\r\nI observe lately, that the Earl of Carlisle has said something of\r\nsimilar import. I do believe the people of the United States have less\r\nof pleasure and less of actual suffering than any other in the world.\r\nHopefulness, but hope ever unsatisfied, is marked in every American’s\r\nface. In contrast with Germany, it is particularly evident that most of\r\nus know but little of the virtuous pleasure God has fitted us to enjoy\r\nin this world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRICES.—BATHING.—DOCKS._]\r\n\r\nClothing, shoes, &c., and rents, are a good deal cheaper than in New\r\nYork, and common articles of food but little higher. I have obtained\r\nthe following, as specimens of prices for a few ordinary necessaries of\r\nlife (1st of June):\r\n\r\n_Beef_, _mutton_, and _pork_, fine, 12½ cts. a pound; _lamb_, 16 cts.;\r\n_veal_, 10 cts.\r\n\r\n_Salmon_, 33 cts. a pound; _fresh butter_, 27 cts.; _potatoes_, 31 cts.\r\na peck.\r\n\r\n_Fowls_, 75 cts. a pair; _rabbits_, 50 cts. a pair; _pigeons_, 37 cts.\r\neach.\r\n\r\n_Best Ohio flour_ (“superfine”), $6.25 a barrel.\r\n\r\n_Bread_, 2½ cts. a pound, or a loaf of 12 lbs., 30 cts.\r\n\r\n_Bread_ of best quality, 3 cts. per lb., or loaf of 12 lbs., 35 cts.\r\n\r\nSugar is higher, and tropical fruits, pine-apples, oranges, &c., are\r\nsold by the hucksters for more money than in New York.\r\n\r\n_Gas._—The town is well lighted by gas, and it is much used in private\r\nhouses—much more generally than in New York. Price $1.12 per 1000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Water._—Water is conveyed through the town and to the shipping in\r\ntubes, through which I believe it is forced by steam-engines by several\r\ncompanies. The manner in which they are remunerated I did not learn.\r\n\r\n_Bathing._—There is a very large and elegant bath-house (covering\r\nhalf an acre), built of stone, by the corporation, at an expense of\r\n$177,000. It is fitted with suitable accommodations for all classes of\r\nbathers, at various prices. There is a public bath (45 by 27 feet) for\r\ngentlemen, and another for ladies. The water is all filtered, and the\r\ncold baths have a constant fresh supply and outflow. A steam-engine is\r\nemployed for pumping, etc. From what I saw, I should suppose the use of\r\nthis establishment was _fashionable_. There are also floating baths in\r\nthe river, as at New York; and beach-bathing and sea-swimming can be\r\nenjoyed at a few minutes’ distance, by ferry, from the town.\r\n\r\n_Quarantine._—There are no buildings or ground employed for quarantine,\r\nbut a number of large hulks are moored in the bay for this purpose.\r\nQuarantine vessels are anchored near them, and keep a yellow flag\r\nflying. It is a great many years since a vessel has been quarantined\r\nhere, however, the medical men being generally agreed that such\r\nprecaution is useless, or effective of more harm than good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have not made a business of sight seeing, and I want to give you\r\nthe general aspect of the town, rather than show up the lions. The\r\nLiverpool docks, however, are so extensive, and so different from any\r\nthing we have of the kind in America, that you will wish me to give a\r\nfew particulars of them.\r\n\r\n_The Docks_ are immense basins, enclosed from the river, or dug out\r\nfrom the bank, walled up on all sides by masonry, and protected on the\r\noutside, from the sea, by solid stone piers or quays. In these quays\r\nare gates or locks, through which, at high-water, vessels enter or\r\nleave. When the water has slightly fallen they are closed, and the\r\nwater being retained, the ships are left securely floating at a height\r\nconvenient for removing their cargoes. The docks are all enclosed\r\nby high brick walls, but between these and the water there is room\r\nenough for passing of carts, and for the temporary protection of goods\r\nunder wooden sheds, as they are hoisted out, and before they can be\r\nremoved. The streets about the docks are mostly lined with very large\r\nand strong fire-proof warehouses. The quay outside the docks is broad\r\nenough to afford a wide terrace upon the river, which is called the\r\nMarine Parade, and is much resorted to as a promenade. Stone stairs at\r\nintervals descend to the bottom of the river, and there are similar\r\nones within the docks to give access to small boats. There are buoys\r\nand life-preservers lashed to the rails of the bridges, and small\r\nhouses, occasionally furnished with instruments and remedies, for the\r\nresuscitation of drowning persons.\r\n\r\nThere are graving docks in which the depth of water can be regulated at\r\npleasure, for the inspection and repair of the bottoms of vessels; and\r\nthere are large basins for coasters, to which there are no gates, and\r\nin which the tide rises and falls, leaving them in the mud at the ebb.\r\nThe large docks are connected with each other, and with the graving\r\ndocks, by canals, so a vessel can go from one to another at any time of\r\ntide, and without going into the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LIVERPOOL.—DOCKS._]\r\n\r\nBut you have yet no idea of the spaciousness and grandeur of the docks.\r\nSome of them enclose within their walls ten or twelve acres, half of\r\nwhich, or more, is occupied by vessels. The twelve now completed (there\r\nare more building) extend along in front of the town uninterrupted\r\nby buildings for more than two miles, or further than from Whitehall\r\nStairs to Corlear’s Hook, in New York. On the other side of the river,\r\na considerably larger extent of docks is laid out and constructing. A\r\nbasin for coasters, which covers over sixteen acres, and in which there\r\nis twelve feet at low water, is just completed there.\r\n\r\nEach dock has its own dock-master, custom-house superintendant, and\r\npolice force. The police is the most perfect imaginable. It is composed\r\nof intelligent and well-instructed young men, most courteous and\r\nobliging, at the same time prompt and efficient. It quite surprised\r\nme to see our fierce captains submit like lambs to have their orders\r\ncountermanded by them.\r\n\r\nThere are three docks for the convenience of steamers alone. The\r\nAmerican steamers, I suppose, are too large to go into them, for they\r\nare lying in the stream.\r\n\r\nThe docks were built by the town, and besides the wonderful increase\r\nof its commerce which they have effected, the direct revenue from them\r\ngives a large interest on their cost. The charges are more moderate\r\nthan at other British ports, and this has, no doubt, greatly helped to\r\ndraw their commerce here. This is the principal ground, for instance,\r\nof the selection of Liverpool in preference to Bristol as the port of\r\ndeparture for transatlantic steamers. The foreign commerce of Liverpool\r\nis the most valuable of any town in the world. Its immense business\r\nis probably owing to its being the best port in the vicinity of the\r\nthickest manufacturing district of England. It is not naturally a good\r\nharbour, but a very exposed and inconvenient one. The port charges at\r\nBristol have been lately greatly reduced, and are now lower than those\r\nof Liverpool, or any other port in the United Kingdom. The amount paid\r\nby vessels for dockage has in some years been $1,000,000, and the whole\r\nis expended by the corporation in improvements of the town and for\r\npublic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe small steam craft do not usually go into the docks, but land\r\npassengers on the quays outside. The ferry-boats, of which there are\r\nhalf a dozen lines crossing the Mersey, all come to one large floating\r\nwharf, from which the ascent to the quays is made easy at all times of\r\ntide, by a sufficiently long, hinged bridge.\r\n\r\nThere is a Sailor’s Home now building here, which will certainly be\r\na noble record of the justice and liberality of the merchants of the\r\nport to their humble associates on the sea. It is situated in an open\r\npublic place, not far from the Custom House and City Hall. It is\r\nbuilt of stone, in the Elizabethan Gothic style, and was considered\r\na design worthy of giving Prince Albert honour in the laying of its\r\ncorner-stone. It is already a stately edifice.\r\n\r\nThere are chapels for seamen in several (possibly in all) of the\r\ndocks.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] The laws of the port require, That for three hours at high water,\r\nthere shall be an efficient person on the deck of every vessel in the\r\ndocks or basins: That the anchor shall be in-board, jib-boom run in,\r\n&c.: That no article of freight shall be allowed to remain on the\r\ndock-quays for more than forty-eight hours [penalty, $1.25 an hour]:\r\nThat no light or fire shall be allowed [without special permission] on\r\nany vessel in the docks or basins at any time. This last regulation\r\nprevents cooking on board, and makes it necessary for the crews to live\r\non shore. The consequent customs are very inconvenient, expensive, and\r\ndemoralising to the seamen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Later._ We have left Liverpool, and while breathing this delicious\r\nfragrance of hawthorn and clover, it is hard to think back to the\r\nstirring dusty town, but I will try for a few minutes to do so, and\r\nthen bring you with me (I wish I could!) out into the country.\r\n\r\nA great deal that interested us at Liverpool I must omit to tell\r\nyou of. I should like to introduce you to some of the agreeable\r\nacquaintances we met there, but in what we saw of social life there,\r\nthere was hardly any thing to distinguish it from America. We were\r\nmuch pleased with some of the public gardens and pleasure-grounds that\r\nwe visited, and when we return here I may give you some account of\r\nthem. I meant to have said a little more about the style of building\r\nin the newer and extending parts of the city; it did not differ much,\r\nhowever, from what you might see at home, in some of the suburbs of\r\nBoston for instance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMPARATIVE STREET-POVERTY._]\r\n\r\nIt would be more strange to you to see long, narrow streets, full from\r\none end to the other, of the poorest-looking people you ever saw, women\r\nand children only, the men being off at work, I suppose, sitting,\r\nlounging, leaning on the door-steps and side-walks, smoking, knitting,\r\nand chatting; the boys playing ball in the street, or marbles on the\r\nflagging; no break in the line of tall, dreary houses, but strings\r\nof clothes hung across from opposite second-story windows to dry;\r\nall dwellings, except a few cellar, beer, or junk shops. You can see\r\nnothing like such a dead mass of pure poverty in the worst quarter\r\nof our worst city. In New York, such a street would be ten times as\r\nfilthy and stinking, and ten times as lively; in the middle of it there\r\nwould be a large fair building, set a little back (would that I could\r\nsay with a few roods of green turf and shrubbery between it and the\r\ngutter in which the children are playing), with the inscription upon\r\nit, “Public Free School;” across from the windows would be a banner\r\nwith the “Democratic Republican Nominations;” hand-organs would be\r\nplaying, hogs squealing, perhaps a stampede of firemen; boys would\r\nbe crying newspapers, and the walls would be posted with placards,\r\nappealing, with whatever motive, to patriotism and duty, showing that\r\nstatesmen and demagogues could calculate on the people’s reading and\r\nthinking there. There would be gay grog-shops too, with liberty poles\r\nbefore them, and churches and Sunday-school rooms (with lying faces\r\nof granite-painted pine) by their side. The countenances of the\r\npeople here, too, exhibited much less, either of virtuous or vicious\r\ncharacter, than you would discern among an equally poor multitude in\r\nAmerica, yet among the most miserable of them (they were Irish), I was\r\nstruck with some singularly intelligent, and even beautiful faces,\r\nso strangely out of place, that if they had been cleaned and put in\r\nframes, so the surroundings would not appear, you would have taken them\r\nfor those of delicate, refined, and intellectual ladies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           _Thursday morning, May 30th._\r\n\r\nWe packed all our travelling matter, except a few necessaries, in two\r\ntrunks and a carpet-bag, and I took them in a public carriage to the\r\nfreight station, to be sent to London. The trunks were received, but\r\nthe bag the clerks refused, and said it must be sent from the passenger\r\nstation. I had engaged to meet my friends in a few minutes at the\r\nopposite side of the town from the passenger station, and the delay of\r\ngoing there would vexatiously disarrange our plans. I therefore urged\r\nthem to take it, offering to pay the passenger luggage extra, freight,\r\n&c. They would be happy to accommodate me, but their rules did not\r\nadmit of it. A _carpet-bag_ could not be sent from that station at any\r\nprice. I jumped on to the box, and drove quickly to the nearest street\r\nof shops, where, at a grocer’s, I bought for twopence a coffee-sack,\r\nand enclosing the bag, brought it in a few minutes back to the station.\r\nThere was a good laugh, and they gave me a receipt at once for _a\r\nsack_—to be kept in London until called for.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STREET BEGGING._]\r\n\r\nOn the quay, I noticed a bareheaded man drawing with coloured crayons\r\non a broad, smooth flagstone. He had represented, in a very skilful and\r\nbeautiful manner, a salmon laid on a china platter, opposite a broken\r\nplate of coarse crockery; between these were some lines about a “rich\r\nman’s dish” and a “poor man’s dinner.” He was making an ornamental\r\nborder about it, and over all was written, “_Friends! I can get_ NO\r\nWORK; _I must do this or starve_.”\r\n\r\nHis hat, with a few pence in it, stood by the side of this. Was it not\r\neloquent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  BIRKENHEAD.—FERRY-BOATS.—GRUFF ENGLISHMAN.—THE\r\n    ABBEY.—FLOUR.—MARKET.—THE PARK.—A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION.—SUBURBAN\r\n    VILLAS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ferry-boat by which we crossed to Birkenhead was very small and\r\ndingy. There was no protection from the weather on board of her,\r\nexcept a narrow, dark cabin under deck. There were uncushioned seats\r\nall around the outside, against the rail, and the rest of the deck was\r\nmostly filled up with freight, spars, &c. She had a bowsprit, and a\r\nbeautiful light, rakish mast, and topmast fitted to carry a gaffsail.\r\nShe was steered with a wheel in the stern. The pilot or master (a\r\ngentleman with a gold band on his hat and naval buttons), stood on\r\nthe paddle-boxes to direct, and a boy stood over the engine to pass\r\norders below. The engine was under deck, the tops of the cylinders only\r\nappearing above it. It was, however, entirely exposed to observation,\r\nand showed excellent workmanship, and was kept perfectly clean and\r\nhighly polished. It was of entirely different construction from any\r\nAmerican engine, having three oscillating cylinders. The “_hands_”\r\nlooked like regular tars, wearing tarpaulins, with the name of the boat\r\nin gilt letters on the ribbon, blue baize shirts, and broad-bottomed\r\ntrowsers hung tight on the hips. The boat came _alongside_ the wharf,\r\nran out her hawsers, and took in her passengers by a narrow gang-plank;\r\nand yet she makes her trip once in ten minutes. There would not be\r\nroom enough on her decks for one of our Rockaways to stand, and she\r\nseemed to have no idea of ferrying any thing but foot-passengers. What\r\nwould the good people of Birkenhead think of a Fulton ferry-boat, with\r\nits long, light, and airy rooms, their floors level with the street,\r\nand broad carriage-roads from stem to stern, crossing and recrossing\r\nwithout turning round, or ever a word of command, or a rope lifted from\r\nmorning till evening and from evening till morning? The length of the\r\nferry is about the same as the South Ferry of Brooklyn, and the fare\r\none penny.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BIRKENHEAD._]\r\n\r\nBIRKENHEAD is the most important suburb of Liverpool, having the same\r\nrelation to it that Charlestown has to Boston, or Brooklyn to New\r\nYork. When the first line of Liverpool packets was established, there\r\nwere not half a dozen houses here; it now has a population of many\r\nthousands, and is increasing with a rapidity hardly paralleled in the\r\nNew World. This is greatly owing to the very liberal and enterprising\r\npolicy of the land-owners, which affords an example that might be\r\nprofitably followed in the vicinity of many of our own large towns.\r\nThere are several public squares, and the streets and places are broad,\r\nand well paved and lighted. A considerable part of the town has been\r\nbuilt with reference to general effect, from the plans and under the\r\ndirection of a talented architect, GILESPIE GRAHAM.\r\n\r\nWe received this information while crossing in the ferry-boat from a\r\nfellow-passenger, who, though a stranger, entered into conversation,\r\nand answered our inquiries with a frankness and courtesy that we have\r\nthus far received from every one in England. By his direction, we\r\nfound near the landing a square of eight or ten acres, about half of\r\nit enclosed by an iron fence, and laid out with tasteful masses of\r\nshrubbery (not trees), and gravel walks. The houses about it stood\r\ndetached, and though of the same general style, were sufficiently\r\nvaried in details, not to appear monotonous. These were all of stone.\r\n\r\nWe left this, and were walking up a long, broad street, looking for a\r\nplace where we could get a bite of something to eat, when the gentleman\r\nwho had crossed at the ferry with us joined us again, and said that as\r\nwe were strangers we might like to look at the ruins of an ABBEY which\r\nwere in the vicinity, and he had come after us that if we pleased he\r\nmight conduct us to it.\r\n\r\nRight in the midst of the town, at the corner of a new brick house,\r\nwe came upon an old pile of stone work. Old, indeed!—under the broken\r\narch of a Gothic window, the rain-water had been so long trickling as\r\nto wear deep channels; cracking, crumbling, bending over with age, it\r\nseemed in many places as if the threatening mass had only been till now\r\nwithheld from falling prostrate by the faithful ivy that clung to it,\r\nand clasped it tight with every fibre.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine the contrast to the hot, hurrying, noisy world\r\nwithout, that we found on entering the little enclosure of the old\r\nchurchyard and abbey walls. It was all overshadowed with dense foliage,\r\nand only here and there through the leaves, or a shattered arch round\r\nwhich the ivy curled with enchanting grace, would there be a glimpse\r\nof the blue sky above. By listening, we could still hear the roar of\r\nwheels, rumbling of rail-cars, clanging of steamboat bells, and the\r\nshouts of jovial sea-captains, drinking gin and water in a neighbouring\r\ntea-garden, over which the American flag was flying. But within the\r\nwalls there was no sound but the chirps of a wren, looking for her\r\nnest in a dark cranny; the hum of bees about an old hawthorn bush; the\r\npiping of a cricket under a gravestone, and our own footsteps echoed\r\nfrom mysterious crypts.\r\n\r\nOur guide having pointed out to us the form of the ancient structure,\r\nand been requited for his trouble by seeing the pleasure he had given\r\nus, took his leave. We remained a long time, and enjoyed it as you may\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BIRKENHEAD ABBEY.—SCHOOL-HOUSE._]\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear of Birkenhead Abbey? I never had before. It has no\r\ncelebrity; but coming upon it so fresh from the land of youth, as\r\nwe did, so unexpecting of any thing of the kind—though I have since\r\nseen far older ruins, and more renowned—I have never found any so\r\nimpressively aged.\r\n\r\nA ruined end of the old prior’s house had been repaired and roofed over\r\nmany years ago, and was used as a school-house—many years ago, for\r\nthe ivy on it was very strong and knarled, and bushes and grass were\r\ngrowing all over the roof. I send you a hasty sketch of it;—wouldn’t\r\nyou like the memory of such a school? (_See vignette, title page._)\r\n\r\nAt the market-place we went into a baker’s shop, and, while eating some\r\nbuns, learned that the poorest flour in market was American and the\r\nbest French. Upon examination of his stock, we thought he had hardly\r\na fair sample of American flour, but his French flour was certainly\r\nremarkably fine, and would be so considered at Rochester. He said it\r\nmade much whiter bread than either American or English, and he used\r\nbut little of it unmixed, except for the most delicate pastry. French\r\nand English flour is sold in sacks, American in barrels. He thought\r\nAmerican flour was not generally _kiln-dried_,[5] and was much injured\r\nin consequence. When we left he obligingly directed us to several\r\nobjects of interest in the vicinity, and showed us through the market.\r\nIt is but little less in size, and really appears finer and more\r\nconvenient than the one I described in Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[5] The great bulk of the flour we are now exporting to England is of\r\ninferior quality, worth about $3.50 when common superfine is $4.50.\r\nIt is used extensively by the _millers_ in England to mix with a\r\nsuperior quality of their own grinding of English wheat. By the way,\r\nthe custom of taking a toll in kind, as a compensation for grinding\r\nat grist-mills, which our fathers brought from England, and which we\r\nretain, is now obsolete there. The millers make their charges in money,\r\nand are paid as in any other business.\r\n\r\nThe roof, which is mostly of glass, is high and airy, and is supported\r\nby two rows of slender iron columns, giving to the interior the\r\nappearance of three light and elegant arcades. The contrivances to\r\neffect ventilation and cleanliness are very complete. It was built by\r\nthe town, upon land given to it for the purpose, and cost $175,000.\r\n\r\nThe baker had begged of us not to leave Birkenhead without seeing their\r\n_new park_, and at his suggestion we left our knapsacks with him, and\r\nproceeded to it. As we approached the entrance, we were met by women\r\nand girls, who, holding out a cup of milk, asked us—“_Will you take a\r\ncup of milk, sirs?—good, cool, sweet, cow’s milk, gentlemen, or right\r\nwarm from the ass!_” And at the gate was a herd of donkeys, some with\r\ncans of milk strapped to them, others saddled and bridled, to be let\r\nfor ladies and children to ride.\r\n\r\nThe gateway, which is about a mile and a half from the ferry, and\r\nquite back of the town, is a great, massive block of handsome Ionic\r\narchitecture, standing alone, and unsupported by any thing else in the\r\nvicinity, and looking, as I think, heavy and awkward. There is a sort\r\nof grandeur about it that the English are fond of, but which, when it\r\nis entirely separate from all other architectural constructions, always\r\nstrikes me unpleasantly. It seems intended as an impressive preface\r\nto a great display of art within; but here, as well as at Eaton Park,\r\nand other places I have since seen, it is not followed up with great\r\nthings, the grounds immediately within the grand entrance being very\r\nsimple, and apparently rather overlooked by the gardener. There is a\r\nlarge archway for carriages, and two smaller ones for those on foot,\r\nand, on either side, and over these, are rooms, which probably serve\r\nas inconvenient lodges for the labourers. No porter appears, and the\r\ngates are freely open to the public.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PEOPLE’S GARDEN._]\r\n\r\nWalking a short distance up an avenue, we passed through another light\r\niron gate into a thick, luxuriant, and diversified garden. Five minutes\r\nof admiration, and a few more spent in studying the manner in which\r\nart had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was\r\nready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be\r\nthought of as comparable with this People’s Garden. Indeed, gardening\r\nhad here reached a perfection that I had never before dreamed of. I\r\ncannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as\r\nhad evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by\r\nwinding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface,\r\nwhere on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers,\r\nwith more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest\r\nturf, and all kept with most consummate neatness. At a distance of a\r\nquarter of a mile from the gate, we came to an open field of clean,\r\nbright, green-sward, closely mown, on which a large tent was pitched,\r\nand a party of boys in one part, and a party of gentlemen in another,\r\nwere playing cricket. Beyond this was a large meadow with rich groups\r\nof trees, under which a flock of sheep were reposing, and girls and\r\nwomen with children, were playing. While watching the cricketers, we\r\nwere threatened with a shower, and hastened back to look for shelter,\r\nwhich we found in a pagoda, on an island approached by a Chinese\r\nbridge. It was soon filled, as were the other ornamental buildings,\r\nby a crowd of those who, like ourselves, had been overtaken in the\r\ngrounds by the rain; and I was glad to observe that the privileges of\r\nthe garden were enjoyed about equally by all classes. There were some\r\nwho were attended by servants, and sent at once for their carriages,\r\nbut a large proportion were of the common ranks, and a few women\r\nwith children, or suffering from ill health, were evidently the wives\r\nof very humble labourers. There were a number of strangers, and some\r\nwe observed with note-books and portfolios, that seemed to have come\r\nfrom a distance to study from the garden. The summer-houses, lodges,\r\nbridges, &c., were all well constructed, and of undecaying materials.\r\nOne of the bridges which we crossed was of our countryman, REMINGTON’S\r\npatent, an extremely light and graceful erection.\r\n\r\nI obtained most of the following information from the head\r\nworking-gardener.\r\n\r\nThe site of the park and garden was, ten years ago, a flat, sterile,\r\nclay farm. It was placed in the hands of Mr. PAXTON, in June, 1844, by\r\nwhom it was laid out in its present form by June of the following year.\r\nCarriage roads, thirty-four feet wide, with borders of ten feet, and\r\nwalks varying in width, were first drawn and made. The excavation for a\r\npond was also made, and the earth obtained from these sources used for\r\nmaking mounds and to vary the surface, which has been done with much\r\n_naturalness_ and taste. The whole ground was thoroughly under-drained,\r\nthe minor drains of stone, the main, of tile. By these sufficient water\r\nis obtained to fully supply the pond, or lake, as they call it, which\r\nis from twenty to forty feet wide, and about three feet deep, and\r\nmeanders for a long distance through the garden. It is stocked with\r\naquatic plants, gold fish, and swans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A MODEL FOR AMERICAN TOWNS._]\r\n\r\nThe roads are macadamized. On each side of the carriage-way, and of all\r\nthe walks, pipes for drainage are laid, which communicate with deep\r\nmain drains that run under the edge of all the mounds or flower beds.\r\nThe walks are laid first with six inches of fine broken stone, then\r\nthree inches cinders, and the surface with six inches of fine rolled\r\ngravel. All the stones on the ground which were not used for these\r\npurposes, were laid in masses of rock-work, and mosses and rock-plants\r\nattached to them. The mounds were then planted with shrubs, and heaths\r\nand ferns, and the beds with flowering plants. Between these, and the\r\nwalks and drives, is everywhere a belt of turf (which, by the way, is\r\nkept close cut with short, broad scythes, and shears, and swept with\r\n_hair-brooms_, as we saw). Then the rural lodges, temple, pavilion,\r\nbridges, _orchestra for a band of instrumental music_, &c., were\r\nbuilt. And so, in one year, the skeleton of this delightful garden was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nBut this is but a small part. Besides the cricket and an archery\r\nground, large valleys were made verdant, extensive drives\r\narranged—plantations, clumps, and avenues of trees formed, and a large\r\npark laid out. And all this magnificent pleasure-ground is entirely,\r\nunreservedly, and for ever the people’s own. The poorest British\r\npeasant is as free to enjoy it in all its parts as the British queen.\r\nMore than that, the baker of Birkenhead has the pride of an OWNER in it.\r\n\r\nIs it not a grand good thing? But you are inquiring who _paid_ for it.\r\nThe honest owners—the most wise and worthy townspeople of Birkenhead—in\r\nthe same way that the New-Yorkers pay for “the Tombs,” and the\r\nHospital, and the _cleaning_ (as they amusingly say) of their streets.\r\n\r\nOf the farm which was purchased, one hundred and twenty acres have\r\nbeen disposed of in the way I have described. The remaining sixty\r\nacres, encircling the park and garden, were reserved to be sold or\r\nrented, after being well graded, streeted, and planted, for private\r\nbuilding lots. Several fine mansions are already built on these (having\r\nprivate entrances to the park), and the rest now sell at $1.25 a square\r\nyard. The whole concern cost the town between five and six hundred\r\nthousand dollars. It gives employment at present, to ten gardeners and\r\nlabourers in summer, and to five in winter.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] “When the important advantages to the poorer classes, of such an\r\nextensive and delightful pleasure-ground, are taken into consideration,\r\nno one will be inclined to say that such an expenditure does not merit\r\nthe most unbounded success, and the deepest public gratitude. Here\r\nnature may be viewed in her loveliest garb, the most obdurate heart may\r\nbe softened, and the mind gently led to pursuits which refine, purify,\r\nand alleviate the humblest of the toil-worn.”\r\n\r\nThe generous spirit and fearless enterprise, that has accomplished\r\nthis, has not been otherwise forgetful of the health and comfort of the\r\npoor.[7] Among other things, I remember, a public washing and bathing\r\nhouse for the town is provided. I should have mentioned also, in\r\nconnection with the market, that in the outskirts of the town there is\r\na range of stone slaughter-houses, with stables, yards, pens, supplies\r\nof hot and cold water, and other arrangements and conveniences, that\r\nenlightened regard for health and decency would suggest.\r\n\r\n[7] “Few towns, in modern times, have been built with such regard to\r\nsanitary regulations, as Birkenhead, and in no instance has so much\r\nbeen done for the health, comfort, and enjoyment of a people, as by\r\nthose energetic individuals with whose names the rise and progress of\r\nBirkenhead are so intimately connected.”—_Dr. J. H. Robertson._\r\n\r\nThe consequence of all these sorts of things is, that all about the\r\ntown, lands, which a few years ago were almost worthless wastes, have\r\nbecome of priceless value; where no sound was heard but the bleating of\r\ngoats and braying of asses complaining of their pasturage, there is now\r\nthe hasty click and clatter of many hundred busy trowels and hammers.\r\nYou may drive through wide and thronged streets of stately edifices,\r\nwhere were only a few scattered huts, surrounded by quagmires. Docks\r\nof unequalled size and grandeur are building, and a forest of masts\r\ngrows along the shore; and there is no doubt that this young town is\r\nto be not only remarkable as a most agreeable and healthy place of\r\nresidence, but that it will soon be distinguished for extensive and\r\nprofitable commerce. It seems to me to be the only town I ever saw that\r\nhas been really built at all in accordance with the advanced science,\r\ntaste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the\r\nnineteenth century. I do not doubt it might be found to have plenty\r\nof exceptions to its general character, but I did not inquire for\r\nthese, nor did I happen to observe them. Certainly, in what I have\r\nnoticed, it is a model town, and may be held up as an example, not only\r\nto philanthropists and men of taste, but to speculators and men of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LIBERAL ENTERPRISE AND PROSPERITY._]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the park, we ascended a hill, from the top of which we\r\nhad a fine view of Liverpool and Birkenhead. Its sides were covered\r\nwith villas, with little gardens about them. The architecture was\r\ngenerally less fantastic, and the style and materials of building more\r\nsubstantial than is usually employed in the same class of residences\r\nwith us. Yet there was a good deal of the same _stuck up_ and uneasy\r\npretentious air about them that the suburban houses of our own city\r\npeople so commonly have. Possibly this is the effect of association,\r\nin my mind, of steady, reliable worth and friendship with plain or\r\nold-fashioned dwellings, for I often find it difficult to discover\r\nin the buildings themselves the elements of such expression. I am\r\ninclined to think it is more generally owing to some disunity in the\r\ndesign—often, perhaps, to a want of keeping between the mansion and\r\nits grounds or its situation. The architect and the gardener do not\r\nunderstand each other, and commonly the owner or resident is totally\r\nat variance in his tastes and intentions from both; or the man whose\r\nideas the plan is made to serve, or who pays for it, has no true\r\nindependent taste, but had fancies to be accommodated, which only\r\nfollow confusedly after custom or fashion. I think, with Ruskin, it is\r\na pity that every man’s house cannot be really his own, and that he\r\ncannot make all that is true, beautiful, and good in his own character,\r\ntastes, pursuits, and history manifest in it.\r\n\r\nBut however fanciful and uncomfortable many of the villa houses about\r\nLiverpool and Birkenhead appear at first sight, the substantial and\r\nthorough manner in which most of them are built will atone for many\r\nfaults. The friendship of nature has been secured to them. Dampness,\r\nheat, cold, will be welcome to do their best. Every day they will\r\nimprove. In fifty or a hundred years fashions may change, and they\r\nwill appear, perhaps, quaint, possibly grotesque; but still strong,\r\nHOME-LIKE, and hospitable. They have no shingles to rot, no glued and\r\nputtied and painted gimcrackery, to warp and crack and moulder; and can\r\nnever look so shabby, and desolate, and dreary, as will nine-tenths of\r\nthe buildings of the same denomination now erecting about New York,\r\nalmost as soon as they lose the raw, cheerless, impostor-like airs\r\nwhich seem almost inseparable from their newness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  A RAILWAY RIDE.—SECOND CLASS.—INCONVENIENT ARRANGEMENTS.—FIRST WALK\r\n    IN THE COUNTRY.—ENGLAND ITSELF.—A RURAL LANDSCAPE.—HEDGES.—APPROACH\r\n    TO A HAMLET.—THE OLD ALE-HOUSE AND THE OLD JOHN BULL.—A TALK WITH\r\n    COUNTRY PEOPLE.—NOTIONS OF AMERICA.—FREE TRADE.—THE YEW TREE.—THE\r\n    OLD RURAL CHURCH AND GRAVEYARD.—A PARK GATE.—A MODEL FARMER.—THE OLD\r\n    VILLAGE INN.—A MODEL KITCHEN.—A MODEL LANDLADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RAILROAD SCENES._]\r\n\r\nWe were very tired when we again reached the baker’s. After\r\npassenger-life at sea, a man’s legs need to be brought into active\r\nservice somewhat gradually. As we had spent more time than we had meant\r\nto at Birkenhead, we determined to rest ourselves for a few minutes,\r\nand get a start of a few miles into the country by the railroad. A\r\nseat, however, on the hard board benches of an English second-class\r\ncar, crowded, and your feet cramped under you, does not remove fatigue\r\nvery rapidly.\r\n\r\nA heavy cloud darkened the landscape, and as we emerged in a few\r\nmoments from the dark tunnel, whirling out of town, big drops of rain\r\ncame slanting in upon us. A lady coughed, and we closed the window.\r\nThe road ran through a deep cutting, with only occasionally such\r\ndepressions of its green-sodded bank, that we could, through the dusty\r\nglass, get glimpses of the country. In successive gleams:—\r\n\r\nA market-garden, with rows of early cabbages, and lettuce, and peas;—\r\n\r\nOver a hedge, a nice, new stone villa, with the gardener shoving up\r\nthe sashes of the conservatory, and the maids tearing clothes from the\r\ndrying-lines;—\r\n\r\nA bridge, with children shouting and waving hats;—\r\n\r\nA field of wheat, in drills as precisely straight, and in earth as\r\nclean and finely-tilled, as if it were a garden-plant;—\r\n\r\nA bit of broad pasture, with colts and cows turning tail to the squall;\r\nlong hills in the back, with some trees and a steeple rising beyond\r\nthem;—\r\n\r\nAnother few minutes of green bank;—\r\n\r\nA jerk—a stop. A gruff shout, “BROMBRO!” A great fuss to get the window\r\non the other side from us open; calling the conductor; having the\r\ndoor unlocked; squeezing through the ladies’ knees, and dragging our\r\npacks over their laps—all borne with a composure that shows them to\r\nbe used to it, and that they take it as a necessary evil of railroad\r\ntravelling. The preparations for rain are just completed as we emerge\r\nupon a platform, and now down it comes in a torrent. We rush, with\r\na quantity of floating muslin, white ankles, and thin shoes, under\r\nan arch. With a sharp whistle and hoarse puffing the train rumbles\r\nonward; grooms pick up the lap-dog and baskets; flaunting white skirts\r\nare moved again across the track; another rush, in which a diminutive\r\nFrench sun-shade is assisted by a New York umbrella to protect a new\r\nEnglish bonnet; a graceful bow in return, with lifting eyebrows, as if\r\nin inquiry; and we are altogether crowded in the station-house.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they go off in carriages, and room is left us\r\nin the little waiting-room to strap on our knapsacks. The rain\r\nslackens—ceases, and we mount, by stone steps up a bank of roses and\r\nclosely-shaven turf, to the top of the bridge over the cutting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE “COUNTRY”._]\r\n\r\nThere we were right in the midst of it! The country—and such a\r\ncountry!—green, dripping, glistening, gorgeous! We stood dumb-stricken\r\nby its loveliness, as, from the bleak April and bare boughs we had left\r\nat home, broke upon us that English May—sunny, leafy, blooming May—in\r\nan English lane; with hedges, English hedges, hawthorn hedges, all in\r\nblossom; homely old farm-houses, quaint stables, and haystacks; the old\r\nchurch spire over the distant trees; the mild sun beaming through the\r\nwatery atmosphere, and all so quiet—the only sounds the hum of bees\r\nand the crisp grass-tearing of a silken-skinned, real (unimported)\r\nHereford cow over the hedge. No longer excited by daring to think we\r\nshould see it, as we discussed the scheme round the old home-fire;\r\nno longer cheering ourselves with it in the stupid, tedious ship; no\r\nmore forgetful of it in the bewilderment of the busy town—but there we\r\nwere, right in the midst of it; long time silent, and then speaking\r\nsoftly, as if it were enchantment indeed, we gazed upon it and breathed\r\nit—never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAt length we walked on—rapidly—but frequently stopping, one side and\r\nthe other, like children in a garden; hedges still, with delicious\r\nfragrance, on each side of us, and on, as far as we can see, true\r\nfarm-fencing hedges; nothing trim, stiff, nice, and amateur-like,\r\nbut the verdure broken, tufty, low, and natural. They are set on a\r\nridge of earth thrown out from a ditch beside them, which raises and\r\nstrengthens them as a fence. They are nearly all hawthorn, which is now\r\ncovered in patches, as if after a slight fall of snow, with clusters\r\nof white or pink blossoms, over its light green foliage. Here and\r\nthere a holly bush, with bunches of scarlet berries, and a few other\r\nshrubs, mingle with it. A cart meets us—a real heavy, big-wheeled\r\nEnglish cart; and English horses—real big, shaggy-hoofed, sleek, heavy\r\nEnglish cart-horses; and a carter—a real apple-faced, smock-frocked,\r\nred-headed, wool-hatted carter—breeches, stockings, hob-nailed shoes,\r\nand “_Gee-up Dobbin_” English carter. Little birds hop along in the\r\nroad before us, and we guess at their names, first of all electing\r\none to be Robin-Redbreast. We study the flowers under the hedge, and\r\ndetermine them nothing else than primroses and buttercups. Through\r\nthe gates we admire the great, fat, clean-licked, contented-faced\r\ncows, and large, white, long-wooled sheep. What else was there? I\r\ncannot remember; but there was that altogether that made us forget\r\nour fatigue, disregard the rain, thoughtless of the way we were\r\ngoing—serious, happy, and grateful. And this excitement continued for\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VILLAGE ALE-HOUSE._]\r\n\r\nAt length as it becomes drenching again, we approach a stone spire.\r\nA stone house interrupts our view in front; the road winds round it,\r\nbetween it and another; turns again, and there on our left is the\r\nchurch—the old ivy-covered, brown-stone village church, with the\r\nyew-tree—we knew it at once, and the heaped-up, green, old English\r\nchurchyard. We turn to the right; there is the old ale-house, long,\r\nlow, thatched-roofed. We run in at the open door; there he sits, the\r\nsame bluff and hearty old fellow, with the long-stemmed pipe and the\r\nfoaming pewter mug on the little table before him. At the same moment\r\nwith us comes in another man. He drops in a seat—raps with his whip.\r\n_Enter_ a young woman, neat and trim, with exactly the white cap,\r\nsmooth hair, shiny face, bright eyes, and red cheeks, we are looking\r\nfor—“_Muggoyail, lass!_”\r\n\r\n... Mug of ale!—ay, that’s it! Mug of ale!—Fill up! Fill up! and the\r\ntoast shall be\r\n\r\n                       “MERRIE ENGLAND! HURRAH!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sit with them for some time, and between puffs of smoke, the talk\r\nis of “the weather and the crops.” The maid leaves the door open, so\r\nwe can look into the kitchen, where a smart old woman is ironing by a\r\nbright coal fire. Two little children venture before us. I have just\r\nsucceeded in coaxing the girl on to my knee, as C. mentions that we are\r\nAmericans. The old woman lays down her iron and puts on her spectacles\r\nto look at us. The stout man who had risen to take an observation of\r\nthe weather, seats himself again and calls for another mug and _twist_.\r\nThe landlord (a tall thin man, unfortunately) looks in and asks how\r\ntimes go where we come from. Plenty of questions follow that show alike\r\nthe interest and the ignorance of our companions about America, it\r\nbeing confused apparently in their minds with Ireland, Guinea, and the\r\npoetical _Indies_. After a little straightening out, and explanation\r\nof the distance to it, its climate and civilized condition, they ask\r\nabout the present crops, the price of wheat, about rents, tithes, and\r\ntaxes. In return, we get only grumbling. “The country is ruined;”\r\n“things weren’t so when they were young as they be now,” and so on,\r\njust as a company of our tavern-lounging farmers would talk, except\r\nthat every complaint ends with blaming Free-Trade. “Free-Trade—hoye\r\nsirs,—free-trade be killing the varmers.”\r\n\r\nWe left them as soon as the shower slackened, but stopped again\r\nimmediately to look at the yew through the churchyard gate. It was a\r\nvery old and decrepit tree, with dark and funereal foliage—the stiff\r\ntrunk and branches of our red-cedar, with the leaf of the hemlock, but\r\nmuch more dark and glossy than either. The walls of the church are low,\r\nbut higher in one part than another. The roof, which is slated, is\r\nhigh and steep. The tower is square, with buttresses on the corners,\r\non the tops of which are quaint lions rampant. It is surmounted by a\r\ntall, symmetrical spire—solid stone to the ball, over which, as I am\r\nthe son of a Puritan, is a weather-cock. There are little, narrow\r\nwindows in the steeple, and swallows are flying in and out of them. Old\r\nweather-beaten stone and mortar, glass, lead, iron, and matted ivy, but\r\nnot a splinter of wood or a daub of paint. Old England for ever! Amen.\r\n\r\nA mile or two more of such walking as before the shower, and we came\r\nto a park gate. It was, with the lodges by its side, neat, simple, and\r\nsubstantial. The park was a handsome piece of old woods, but, as seen\r\nfrom the road, not remarkable. We were told, however, that there was a\r\ngrand old hall and fine grounds a long ways within. Near the park there\r\nwere signs of an improving farmer: broad fields of mangel-wurzel in\r\ndrills; large fields, partly divided by wire fences, within which were\r\nlarge flocks of sheep; marks of recent under-draining; hedges trimmed\r\nsquare, and every thing neat, straight, and business-like.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE COUNTRY INN._]\r\n\r\nAs it grows dark we approach another village. The first house on the\r\nleft is an inn—a low, two-story house of light drab-coloured stone.\r\nA bunch of grapes (cast in iron) and a lantern are hung out from it\r\nover the foot-path, and over the front door is a square sign—“THE RED\r\nLION—_licensed to sell foreign spirits and beer, to be drunk on the\r\npremises_.” We turn into a dark hall, and opening a door to the left,\r\nenter—the kitchen. Such a kitchen! You would not believe me if I could\r\ndescribe how bright every thing is. You would think the fireplace a\r\nshow-model, for the very bars of the grate are glistening. It is all\r\nglowing with red-hot coals; a bright brass tea-kettle swings and sings\r\nfrom a polished steel crane—hook, jack, and all like silver; the brass\r\ncoal-scuttle, tongs, shovel, and warming-pan are in a blazing glow, and\r\nthe walls and mantel-piece are covered with bright plate-covers, and I\r\nknow not what other metallic furniture, all burnished to the highest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe landlady rises and begs to take our wet hats—a model-landlady,\r\ntoo. What a fine eye!—a kind and welcoming black eye. Fair and stout;\r\nelderly—a little silver in her hair, just showing its otherwise thick\r\nblackness to be no lie; a broad-frilled, clean white cap and collar,\r\nand a black dress. Ah ha! one of the widows that we have read of. We\r\nhesitated to cross the clean-scoured, buff, tile floor with our muddy\r\nshoes; but she draws arm-chairs about the grate, and lays slippers\r\nbefore them, stirs up the fire, though it is far from needing it, and\r\nturns to take our knapsacks. “We must be fatigued—it’s not easy walking\r\nin the rain; she hopes we can make ourselves comfortable.”\r\n\r\nThere is every prospect that we shall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  TALK WITH A FARMER;—WITH A TENDER-HEARTED WHEELWRIGHT.—AN AMUSING\r\n    STORY.—NOTIONS OF AMERICA.—SUPPER.—SPEECH OF THE ENGLISH.—PLEASANT\r\n    TONES.—QUAINT EXPRESSIONS.—THE TWENTY-NINTH OF MAY.—ZACCHEUS IN THE\r\n    OAK TREE.—EDUCATION.—BED-CHAMBER.—A NIGHTCAP AND ... A NIGHTCAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TALK WITH A FARMER._]\r\n\r\nOn one side near the fire there was a recess in the wall, in which was\r\na _settle_ (a long, high-backed, wooden seat). Two men with pipes and\r\nbeer sat in it, with whom we fell to talking. One of them proved to be\r\na farmer, the other a jack-of-all-trades, but more distinctly of the\r\nwheelwright’s, and a worshipper of and searcher after ideal women, as\r\nhe more than once intimated to us. We were again told by the farmer\r\nthat free trade was ruining the country—no farmer could live long in\r\nit. He spoke with a bitter jocoseness of the regularity of his taxes,\r\nand said that though they played the devil with every thing else, he\r\nalways knew how _tithes_ would be. He paid, I think he said, about a\r\ndollar an acre every year to the church, though he never went to it\r\nin his life; always went to chapel, as his father did before him. He\r\nwas an Independent; but there were so few of them thereabouts that\r\nthey could not afford to keep a minister, and only occasionally had\r\npreaching. When he learned that we were from America, he was anxious\r\nto know how church matters were there. Though a rather intelligent\r\nman, he was utterly ignorant that we had no state church; and though\r\na dissenter, the idea of a government giving free trade to all sorts\r\nof religious doctrine seemed to be startling and fearful to him. But\r\nwhen I told him what the rent (or the interest on the value) of my\r\nfarm was, and what were its taxes, he wished that he was young that he\r\nmight go to America himself; he really did not see how he should be\r\nable to live here much longer. He _rented_ a farm of about fifty acres,\r\nand was a man of about the same degree of intelligence and information\r\nthat you would expect of the majority of those _owning_ a similar\r\nfarm with us. Except that he was somewhat stouter than most Yankees,\r\nhe did not differ much in appearance or dress from many of our rather\r\nold-fashioned farmers.\r\n\r\nThe tender-hearted wheelwright could hardly believe that we were really\r\nborn and brought up in America. He never thought any foreigners could\r\nlearn to speak the language so well. He too was rather favourably\r\nstruck with the idea of going to America, when we answered his\r\ninquiries with regard to mechanics’ wages. He was very cautious,\r\nhowever, and cross-questioned us a long time about the cost of every\r\nthing there—the passage, the great heat of the climate, the price of\r\nbeer; and at length, touching his particular weakness, he desired to\r\nbe told candidly how it would be if he should marry before he went. If\r\nhe should get a wife, a real handsome one, would it be safe for him\r\nto take her there? He had heard a story—perhaps we knew whether it\r\nwas true or not—of a man who took a handsome wife out with him, and\r\na black man, that was a great rich lord in our country, took a great\r\nliking to her, and offered the man ten thousand pounds for her, which\r\nhe refused; and so the great black lord went away very wroth and vexed.\r\nWhen he was gone, the woman upbraided her husband: “Thou fool, why\r\ndidst thee not take it and let me go with him? I would have returned\r\nto thee to-morrow.” Then the man followed after the black lord, and\r\nsold his wife to him for ten thousand pounds. But the next day she did\r\nnot return, nor the next, neither the next; and so the man went to\r\nlook for her; and lo! he found her all dressed up in silk and satin,\r\n’lighting from a coach, and footmen waiting upon her. So he says to\r\nher, “Why didst thee not return the next day?” “_Dost take me for a\r\nfool, goodman?_” quoth she, and stepped back into her fine coach and\r\ndrove off; and so he lost his handsome wife.\r\n\r\nBesides the kitchen, there were, on the lower floor of the inn, two\r\nor three small dining or tea rooms, a little office or accounting\r\ncloset for the mistress, and a _tap-room_, which is a small apartment\r\nfor smoking and drinking. These are all plainly but neatly furnished.\r\nThere is a large parlour above stairs, somewhat elegantly furnished.\r\nThe kitchen, tap-room, and office are low rooms, and over these is\r\nthe parlour. The dining-rooms are higher, and over them are the\r\nbed-chambers. Thus the parlour is allowed a high ceiling, level with\r\nthe eaves of the roof, and you enter it from a landing some steps\r\nlower than the bed-chambers. The latter are carried up under the roof,\r\nwith dormer windows, and are very pleasant rooms. It will be seen that\r\nall the travellers’ rooms or apartments are thus made spacious at the\r\nexpense of height in the others, and that yet there is a convenient\r\narrangement and connection of the whole.\r\n\r\nWe had supper in a little back room, as neat as care and scouring could\r\nmake and keep it. The table was much such a one as Mrs. Marcombe,\r\nin Hanover, would have set for a couple of tired White Mountain\r\npedestrians, except the absence of any kind of cakes or pies. The ham\r\nhad a peculiar taste, and was very good, C. says, the least unpleasant\r\nof any he was ever tempted to eat. It had been dried by hanging from\r\nthe ceiling of the kitchen, instead of being regularly _smoked_, as is\r\nour practice. The milk and butter (which was not in the least salted)\r\nwere very sweet and high-flavoured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ENGLISH IN CONVERSATION._]\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had a long talk with the old woman and her daughter.\r\nThe latter was a handsome person with much such a good, beaming face\r\nas her mother, but with youth, and more refinement from education and\r\nintelligence. She also was a widow with two sweet, shy little girls.\r\n\r\nThere are peculiarities in the speech of these women that would\r\ndistinguish them anywhere from native Americans. Perhaps the novelty\r\nof them is pleasing, but it has seemed to us that the speech of most\r\nof the people above the lowest class of labourers that we have met,\r\nis more agreeable and better than we often hear at home. Perhaps\r\nthe climate may have effect in making the people more habitually\r\nanimated—the utterance more distinct and varied. Sentences are more\r\ngenerally finished with a rising inflection, syllables are more\r\nforcibly accented, and quite often, as with our landlady, there is a\r\nrich musical tone in the conversational voice to which we are not yet\r\nso much accustomed, but that it compels us to listen deferentially.\r\nI wonder that beauty of speech is not more thought of as an\r\naccomplishment. It is surely capable of great cultivation, and should\r\nnot be forgotten in education.\r\n\r\nExcept in the lower class, the choice of words seems often elegant,\r\nand we hear very few idiomatic phrases or provincialisms. Where we\r\ndo notice them, in the class I am now speaking of, it would not seem\r\nan affectation of singular language in an educated person with us,\r\nbut rather a fortunate command of vigorous Saxon words. We have never\r\nany difficulty in understanding them, while we do sometimes have to\r\nreconstruct our sentences, and find substitutes for some of our words,\r\nbefore we are plainly understood. The “H” difficulty is an exception to\r\nall this, with nearly all the people, except the most polished, that\r\nwe have met. Is it not singular? Among the lowest classes, however,\r\nthere are many words used that puzzle us; others are pronounced\r\ncuriously, and many of our common words are used in new combinations.\r\nThere is an old-fashioned, quaint set of words in common use that we\r\nonly understand from having met with them in old books—in the Bible,\r\nfor instance. The words _Master_ and _Mistress_ (instead of Mister and\r\nMisses, as we have got to pronounce them), and _lad_ and _lass_, are\r\nusual. “_Here, lad!_” “_Well, Maister?_” I first heard in the Liverpool\r\nmarket. I passed a man there, too, leading a dray-horse, with a heavy\r\nload, up one of the steep streets. He was encouraging him in this way:\r\n“Coom on, my lad! Coom on, my good lad!” When he had reached the brow\r\nhe stopped and went before the noble beast, who, with glistening eyes,\r\nand ears playing beautifully, bowed his head to be patted, “_Good lad!\r\ngood lad! Well, thee’s done it!_”[8]\r\n\r\n[8] A gentleman, riding towards Chowbet, and seeing a boy in the\r\nroad, shouted out to him, “My lad, am I half-way to Chowbet?” Young\r\nLancashire looked up at the querist, and said, “Hah con aw tell, tha’\r\nfoo’, when I doon’t know wheear ta’ coom fra?”—_Liverpool paper._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had noticed yesterday in Liverpool that the omnibuses were decorated\r\nwith branches of trees, ribbons, and flags; the union-jack (British\r\nensign) was hoisted in several places, the children seemed to be\r\nenjoying a half-holiday in the afternoon, and once we saw them going\r\ntogether in an irregular procession, carrying a little one dressed\r\nwith leaves and crowned with a gilt-paper cap, and singing together in\r\nshrill chorus some verses, of which we only understood the frequent\r\nrepetition of the words: “The twenty-ninth of May! the twenty-ninth\r\nof May!” It occurred to C. to ask whether all this was intended to\r\ncelebrate any thing. “Oh, surely,” our hostess said, “it was the\r\ntwenty-ninth of May—King-Charles-and-the-Oak day.” In her husband’s\r\ntime, they used always to keep it in good style, ornamenting their\r\nhouse all over with oak boughs, and all the stage-coaches and the\r\nhorses used to be decked with oak boughs too. “How beautifully,” says\r\nC., aside, “do such pretty simple customs keep alive the remembrance\r\nof old historic facts!” “But why do they carry about the _child_?”\r\nShe did not recollect clearly, but she had the impression that King\r\nCharles was a baby when it occurred. She had forgotten exactly how\r\nit was, she said, “but it told all about it in the Bible.” “In the\r\nBible! mother; you mean in the History of England, do you not?” said\r\nher daughter, smiling. “Was it?” replied the old lady, “I never had\r\ntime to read much in the large History of England. Let me see—why,\r\nno; now I am sure it was in the Bible. Don’t you remember—what’s his\r\nname—Zack—Zack—Zacheriah? yes, Zacheriah; how he climbed up into an oak\r\ntree to see King Charles go by!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SCRIPTURAL EDUCATION._]\r\n\r\nA large and most powerful class, including many even of the more\r\nconservative of the dissenters in England, are terribly afraid of a\r\nnational system of education that shall be free from Church influence.\r\nThe people had better be left to grow up in ignorance, rather than that\r\nthey should not be instructed in theological dogmas. I have actually\r\nheard a refined and educated gentleman, occupying an influential\r\nposition, advocate the idea that all the education the common\r\npeople needed was so much as would enable them to read their Bible,\r\nprayer-book, and catechism. Except for this, he would never let them\r\nhave a teacher, but would leave them to the parson. He would break up\r\nevery dissenter’s school—have no school in the land that was not a part\r\nof the Church. The godless system of education which was now favoured\r\nin high quarters (on the plan of our New England common schools!) he\r\nverily believed, if adopted, would be a national sin that God would\r\narise in his anger to punish.\r\n\r\nOur landlady had lived almost to old age under the shadow of the\r\nChurch, in which the story of Zaccheus is every year read aloud, and\r\nin which a religious celebration of the restoration of King Charles is\r\nby law performed every 29th of May. But a person of sound faculties,\r\nnative-born, could not probably be found in New England, whose godless\r\neducation would not have made impossible such a confusion of religious\r\ninstruction as had been given her.[9]\r\n\r\n[9] There is a service for the 29th of May in the Book of Common\r\nPrayer, which, by royal order (commencing “_Victoria Regina_. It is\r\nour Royal Will and Pleasure,” &c., and countersigned by Lord John\r\nRussell on the 21st of June, 1837), is to be performed in every church,\r\ncollege, and chapel in the United Kingdom every year. It is most\r\nblasphemously absurd and false in its historical allusions and slavish\r\nmoralizings.\r\n\r\nI am writing now in my bedroom. Though the ceiling is low, it is large\r\nand well furnished. There are large pitchers of water, foot-bath,\r\nand half a dozen towels. The bed is very large, clean, and richly\r\ncurtained. The landlady has sent me up a glass of her home-brewed beer,\r\nwith a nightcap which I noticed she hung by the fire when I left the\r\nkitchen. The chambermaid has drawn down the bed-clothes, and says, “The\r\nbed has been well aired, sir.” Good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  THE BREAK OF DAY.—A FULL HEART.—FAMILIAR THINGS.—THE VILLAGE\r\n    AT SUNRISE.—FLOWERS.—BIRDS.—DOG KENNELS.—“THE SQUIRE” AND “THE\r\n    HALL.”—ROOKS.—VISIT TO A SMALL FARM.—THE COWS.—THE MILKING.—THE\r\n    DAIRY-MAIDS.—THE STABLES.—MANURE.—BONES.—PASTURE.—WHITE\r\n    CLOVER.—IMPLEMENTS.—CARTS.—THE ENGLISH PLOUGH AND HARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FAMILIAR ENGLISH LANDSCAPE._]\r\n\r\n                                                             _31st May._\r\n\r\nIt was very early this morning when I became gradually aware of the\r\ntwittering of house-sparrows, and was soon after brought to more\r\ndistinct consciousness of time and place by the long clear note of some\r\nother stranger bird. I stepped from bed and kneeled at a little, low,\r\nlatticed window, curtained without by a woodbine. Parting the foliage\r\nwith my hands, I looked out upon a cluster of low-thatched cottages,\r\nhalf overgrown with ivy; a blooming hawthorn hedge, enclosing a field\r\nof heavy grass and clover glistening with dew; a few haystacks; another\r\nfield beyond, spotted with sheep; a group of trees; and then some low\r\nhills, over which the dawn was kindling, with a faint blush, the quiet,\r\nsmoky clouds in a grey sky. It may seem an uninteresting landscape, but\r\nI gazed upon it with great emotion, so great that I wondered at it.\r\nSuch a scene I had never looked upon before, and yet it was in all its\r\nparts as familiar to me as my native valley. Land of our poets! Home of\r\nour fathers! Dear old mother England! It would be strange if I were not\r\naffected at meeting thee at last face to face.\r\n\r\nI dressed, and worked my way through the dark, crooked stairs to the\r\nkitchen, where, on the bright steel fender, I found my shoes dry and\r\npolished. I walked through the single short street of the hamlet. The\r\nhouses were set closely together, with neat little gardens about them.\r\nThey were of every age; one I noticed marked with the date 1630—about\r\nthe time of the first settlement in Connecticut. It was of stone,\r\nnarrow, with a steep roof covered with very small slates; the windows\r\nmuch wider than high, and filled with little panes of glass set in\r\nstrips of lead. Except in this and the materials of which it was built,\r\nit was not unlike some of the oldest houses that we yet see in our\r\nfirst Puritan villages, as Hadley and Wethersfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ROOKS.—VISIT TO A FARM._]\r\n\r\nA blackbird hopped before me, but did not whistle, and plenty of little\r\nbirds were chirping on the walls and rose-bushes, but there was nothing\r\nlike the singing we have at home of a spring morning.[10] At the other\r\nend of the village was another inn—“The Blue Lion,” I believe, and a\r\ntall hostler opening the stable doors was dressed just as I wanted to\r\nsee him—jockey-cap, long striped waistcoat, breeches, and boots.\r\n\r\n[10] An English friend, now in America, thinks I am wrong in this.\r\n\r\nAs I returned I saw the farmer that had been at the inn the night\r\nbefore, and asked him to let me see his cows. He said they were coming\r\ndown the lane, and if I went with him I should meet them. Passing\r\na group of well-built, neat, low buildings, he said they were the\r\nsquire’s kennels. They were intended for greyhounds, but he had his\r\npointers in them now.\r\n\r\n“The squire’s! But where’s the squire’s house?”\r\n\r\n“Yon’s the hall,” pointing to a distant group of trees, above which a\r\nlight smoke was rising straight up in the calm air, and a number of\r\nlarge black birds were rapidly rising and falling. “Yon’s the hall; ye\r\nsee the rooks.”\r\n\r\n“The rooks! Then those are rooks, are they?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, be they—rooks—do ye not know what rooks be?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we don’t have them in America.”\r\n\r\n“No! not have rooks? They be main good in a pie, sir.”\r\n\r\nWe met the cows, of which there were about a dozen, driven by a boy\r\ntowards the farm-house. Any one of them would have been considered\r\nremarkably fine in America. They were large and in good order; with\r\nsoft, sleek skin, and like every cow I have seen in England, look as if\r\nthey had just been polished up for exhibition. He could tell nothing of\r\ntheir breed except of one, a handsome heifer, which he said came partly\r\nof Welsh stock. He took me across a field or two to look at a few cows\r\nof the squire’s. They were finer than any of his, and seemed to be\r\ngrade short-horns.\r\n\r\nThe cows were driven into hovels, which he called _shippens_, and\r\nfastened at their mangers by a chain and ring sliding on an upright\r\npost (the latest fashion with us), eight of them in an apartment,\r\nstanding back to back. Three or four of his daughters came out to\r\nmilk—very good-looking, modest young women, dressed in long, loose,\r\ngrey, homespun gowns. They had those high wooden tubs to milk in\r\nthat we see in the old pictures of sentimental milkmaids. It seems\r\nconstantly like dreaming to see so many of these things that we have\r\nonly known before in poetry or painting.\r\n\r\nThe dairy-house and all the farm buildings were of brick, interworked\r\nwith beams of wood and thatched. They were very small, the farm being\r\nonly of fifty acres, and the hay and grain always kept in stacks.\r\nThe arrangements for saving manure were poor—much the same as on any\r\ntolerably good farm with us—a hollowed yard with a pool of liquid on\r\none side. He bought some dung and bones in Liverpool, but not much. He\r\nesteemed bones most highly, and said they did immense good hereabout.\r\nThey made a sweeter, stronger, and more permanent pasture. Where he\r\nhad applied them twelve years ago, at the rate of a ton to an acre, he\r\ncould see their effect yet. He took me into an adjoining field which,\r\nhe said, was one of the best pastures in the village. It had been\r\nploughed in narrow lands, and the ridges left high, when it was laid\r\ndown. The sward was thicker, better _bottomed_, than any I ever saw in\r\nAmerica. He sowed about a bushel of grass seeds to the acre, seeding\r\ndown with oats. For cheese pasture, he valued white clover more than\r\nany thing else, and had judged, from the taste of American cheese,\r\nthat we did not have it. For meadows to be mowed for hay, he preferred\r\nsainfoin and ray-grass. He had lately under-drained some of his lowest\r\nland with good effect. His soil is mostly a stiff clay resting on a\r\nledge of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe farm-carts were clumsy and heavy (for horses), with very large\r\nwheels with broad tires and huge hubs, as you have seen the English\r\ncarts pictured. The plough was a very long, sharp, narrow one,\r\ncalculated to plough about seven inches deep, and turn a slice ten\r\ninches wide, with a single pair of horses. The stilts, of iron, were\r\nlong and low, and the beam, also of iron, very high, with a goose-neck\r\ncurve. It is a very beautiful instrument, graceful and strong; but\r\nits appearance of lightness is deceptive, the whole being of iron;\r\nand this, with its great length, though adding to its efficiency for\r\nnice, accurate work in perfectly smooth and clear, long fields, would\r\nentirely unfit it for most of our purposes. On the rocky, irregular,\r\nhill-side farms of New England, or the stump lands of the West, it\r\nwould be perfectly useless; but I should think it might be an admirable\r\nplough for our New York wheat lands, or perhaps for the prairies after\r\nthey had been once broken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ENGLISH PLOUGH._]\r\n\r\nThe harrow used on the farm was also of iron, frame and all, in three\r\noblong sections, hinged together. These were about all the tools I saw,\r\nand they were left in a slovenly way, lying about the farm-yard and in\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGLISH PLOUGH (_vertical_ and _horizontal_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  BREAKFAST AT THE INN.—A TALE OF HIGH LIFE.—THE GARDEN OF THE\r\n    INN.—AN OLD FARM-HOUSE.—TIMBER HOUSES.—LABOURERS’ COTTAGES.—WATTLES\r\n    AND NOGGIN WALLS.—A “FERME ORNEE.”—A LAWN PASTURE.—COPPER-LEAVED\r\n    BEECHES.—TAME BLACK CATTLE.—APPROACH TO CHESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned to my room in the inn, and had written a page or two of\r\nthis before any one was stirring. Then I heard the mistress waking the\r\nservants, and soon after “John the boots” came to my door to call me,\r\nas I had requested him to.\r\n\r\nAfter with difficulty prevailing upon the landlady and her daughter\r\nto breakfast with us, we had a very sociable time with them over the\r\ntea and eggs which they had prepared for us. They were interested to\r\nhear of the _hard_ coal we burned (anthracite) that made no smoke, and\r\nof _wood_ fires, and of our peculiar breakfast dishes, griddle-cakes,\r\nand Indian bread. They told us of other members of their family—two or\r\nthree in Australia—and of the clergy and gentry of the neighbourhood.\r\nThey spoke kindly and respectfully of the vicar—“a sporting man, sir,\r\nand fond of good living,” the old lady added, after mentioning his\r\ncharity and benevolence. In speaking of the gentry, it was difficult\r\nfor her to believe that we did not know the general history of all the\r\nfamilies. We asked about a park we had passed. It was —— Park, and\r\nhad a remarkable story to be told of it; but so constantly did she\r\nanticipate our knowledge, taking for granted that we knew all that had\r\noccurred until within a short time, that it was long before we could\r\nat all understand the _news_ about it. As you are probably equally\r\nignorant, I will tell you the tale connectedly, as we finally got it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A TALE OF HIGH LIFE._]\r\n\r\nIt had been the property of Sir T——, who occupied the hall in it\r\nuntil his death, a year or two ago, and had been in his family many\r\nhundred years. The estate included several villages—the whole of them,\r\nevery house and shop, even the churches—and was valued at £800,000\r\n($4,000,000). On the death of Sir T., Sir W., his son, inherited his\r\ntitle and estate. But Sir W. was a sporting man, and had previously\r\ngambled himself in debt to Jews in London £600,000. He came to the\r\nhall, however, and remained there some time, keeping two packs of\r\nhounds. He was a good landlord, and the family were beloved. Lady M.\r\nhad established and maintained a national (church) school; and in the\r\nwinter was in the habit of serving out a large quantity of soup every\r\nday to the poor of the estate. But at length the bailiffs came, and Sir\r\nW. went to France, and his family dispersed among their relatives all\r\nover the kingdom. Lady M. last winter had been very ill, and nothing\r\nailed her, the physicians said, but sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were going to sell it—they did not know how they could—but\r\nthey showed us a considerable volume, illustrated with maps and\r\nlithographs, of “plans and particulars” of the estate, on the first\r\npage of which, “Messrs. —— had the honour to announce that they had\r\nbeen instructed by the honourable proprietor, to sell at auction, on a\r\ncertain six days, upwards of fifteen hundred acres of very fine rich\r\nland, let to an old and respectable tenantry, including the whole of\r\nthe town of ——, together with several manors and manorial rights,\r\nwhich have been commuted at £500 _per annum_.” They showed us also\r\nanother volume, containing in one hundred and twelve quarto pages,\r\ndescriptions of the furniture, plate, library, paintings, wines, &c.,\r\nwith many engravings—a strange exposure of noble housekeeping to our\r\nrepublican eyes. Seeing that we were much interested in this, the\r\nlandlady offered to give it to us; it was of no use to her, she said,\r\nand we were quite welcome to it. It was really of some value in several\r\nways, and we offered to pay for it, but she would not sell it.\r\n\r\nBefore we left, they showed us through the little garden of the inn;\r\nit was beautifully kept, and every thing growing strongly. Then,\r\nafter buckling on our knapsacks, and bringing us another mug of\r\n_home-brewed_, our kind entertainers took leave of us with as much\r\ngood-feeling and cordiality as if we were old friends, who had been\r\nmaking them a short visit, following us out into the street, with\r\nparting advice about the roads and the inns, and at last a warm shaking\r\nof hands.\r\n\r\nThe country we walked over for a few miles after leaving the village,\r\nwas similar to that we saw yesterday—flattish, with long, low\r\nundulations—the greater part in pasture, and that which was not, less\r\nhighly cultivated than I had expected to find much land in England,\r\nthe stock upon it almost altogether cows, and these always looking\r\nadmirably well; the fields universally divided by hedges, which,\r\nthough they add much to the beauty of the landscape, when you are in a\r\nposition to look over it, greatly interrupt the view, and always are\r\nill-trimmed, irregular, and apparently insecure. We met no one on the\r\nroad, saw very few habitations, and only two men at work, ploughing,\r\nfor several miles; then a cluster of cottages, an inn, and a large\r\nold _timber-house_. As I had been informed (very wrongly) that these\r\nwere getting rare in England, and it was very peculiar and striking, I\r\nstopped to sketch it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OLD TIMBER FARM-HOUSE._]\r\n\r\nImagine a very large, old-fashioned New England farm-house with the\r\nweather-boarding stripped off and all the timber exposed. Fill up the\r\nintervals with brick, and plaster them over even with the outer surface\r\nof the beams; then whitewash this plastered surface and blacken the\r\ntimber, and you have the walls of the house. A New England house,\r\nhowever, would have three times as many windows. The roof is mostly\r\nof very small old slates, set with mortar, and capped (ridged) with\r\nthick quarried stones. It is repaired with large new slates in several\r\nplaces, and an addition that has been made since the main part was\r\nerected, which is entirely of brick in the walls, with no timber, is\r\nheavily thatched with straw, as are also all the out-buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TIMBER HOUSE (_old farm-house_)]\r\n\r\nThe rear of the farm-house probably contains the dairy, and is covered\r\nwith thatch to secure a more equable temperature.\r\n\r\nAll the other buildings in the hamlet were similarly built—timber and\r\nwhitewashed walls, and thatch roofs. While I was sketching, the farmer,\r\na great stout old man, and the first we have seen in top-boots, came\r\nout and entered into conversation with us. He was much amused that I\r\nshould think his house worth sketching, and told us it had been long\r\n(rented) in his family. He had no idea how old it was. He described the\r\ncottages, which were certainly very pretty to look at, as exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable and unhealthy—the floors, which were of clay, being\r\ngenerally lower than the road and the surrounding land, and often wet,\r\nand always damp, while the roofs and walls were old and leaky, and full\r\nof vermin. The walls of these cottages were all made by interlacing\r\ntwigs (called _wattles_) between the timbers, and then _plashing_ these\r\nwith mud (_noggin_), inside and out, one layer over another as they\r\ndried, until it was as thick as was desired; then the surface was made\r\nsmooth with a trowel and whitewashed.\r\n\r\nA few miles further on we came to a large, park-like pasture, bounded\r\nby a neatly trimmed hedge, and entered by a simple gate, from which\r\na private road ran curving among a few clumps of trees to a mansion\r\nabout a furlong distant. We entered, and rested ourselves awhile at\r\nthe foot of some large oaks. The house was nearly hidden among trees,\r\nand these, seen across the clear grass land, were the finest groups of\r\nfoliage we had ever seen. A peculiar character was given it by one or\r\ntwo _copper-leaved_ beeches—large, tall trees, thickly branched from\r\nthe very surface of the ground. (These trees, which are frequently used\r\nwith great good effect in landscape gardening in England, are rare in\r\nAmerica, though they may be had at the nurseries. There are two sorts,\r\none much less red than the other.) The cattle in this _pasture-lawn_\r\nwere small and black, brisk and wild-looking, but so tame in reality,\r\nthat as we lay under the tree, they came up and licked our hands like\r\ndogs. The whole picture completely realized Willis’s beautiful ideal,\r\n“The Cottage _Insoucieuse_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _APPROACH TO CHESTER._]\r\n\r\nThe country hence to Chester was more elevated and broken, and the walk\r\ndelightful. We saw many beautiful things, but have seen so many more\r\ninteresting ones since, that I can hardly remember them. The road, too,\r\nwas more travelled. We met a stage-coach, with no inside passengers,\r\nand the top overloaded, and a handsome carriage and four, the near\r\nwheeler and leader ridden by postilions in bright livery, and within,\r\nan old gentleman under a velvet cap, and young lady under a blue silken\r\ncalash. The fields, too, were more tilled; and one of fifty acres,\r\nwhich was ridged for some root crop, was the most thoroughly cultivated\r\npiece of merely farming ground I ever saw. There were several women at\r\nwork in the back part of it. I could not make out what they were doing.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the forenoon, we came to the top of a higher hill\r\nthan we had before crossed, from which we looked down upon a beautiful\r\nrich valley, bounded on the side opposite us by blue billowy hills.\r\nIn the midst of it was the smoke and chimneys and steeples of a town.\r\nOne square, heavy brown tower was conspicuous over the rest, and we\r\nrecognised by it the first cathedral we had seen.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the town, the road became a crooked paved street,\r\nlined with curious small antique houses, between which we passed,\r\nstopping often to admire some singular gable, or porch, or grotesque\r\ncarving, until it was spanned by a handsome brown stone arch, not\r\nthe viaduct of a railroad, as at first seemed likely, nor an arch of\r\ntriumph, of the pictures of which it reminded us, but one of the four\r\ngateways of the city. Passing under it, we found on the inner side a\r\nflight of broad stone stairs leading on to the wall, which we ascended.\r\nAt the top, on the inside of the wall, was a printer’s shop, in which\r\nguide-books were offered for sale. Entering this we were received by\r\nan intelligent and obliging young man who left the press to give us\r\nchairs, and with whom we had an interesting conversation about the town\r\nand about his trade. Printers’ wages, if I recollect rightly, were\r\nabout one quarter more in New York than in Chester. After purchasing a\r\nguide-book and a few prints of him, we accepted his invitation to leave\r\nour knapsacks in his shop, and take a walk on the walls before entering\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n      CHESTER WITHOUT.—A WALK ON THE WALLS.—ANTIQUITIES.—STRIKING\r\n                               CONTRASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _Chester, June 2d._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A WALK ABOUT CHESTER._]\r\n\r\nMy journal is behindhand several days, what little time I have had to\r\nwrite being occupied in finishing my last letter. Meantime, I have seen\r\nso much, that if I had a week of leisure I should despair of giving\r\nyou a good idea of this strange place. But that you may understand\r\na little how greatly we are interested, I will mention some of the\r\nobjects that we have seen, and are seeing. Use your imagination to the\r\nutmost to fill up the hints, rather than descriptions, of these that I\r\nshall give you. You need not fear that when you come here the reality\r\nwill disappoint you, or fail to astonish you with its novelty, its\r\nquaintness, and the strange mingling of venerable associations with its\r\nmodern art and civilization.\r\n\r\nWe were about to leave the printer’s for a walk on the wall. I will not\r\ndetain myself with a detailed account of our proceedings, but imagine\r\nthat you are with me, while I point out to you a few of the note-worthy\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are on the top of the wall, a few feet from the side of the archway\r\nthrough which we entered the town. Look down now on the outside. The\r\nroad, just before it enters the gate, crosses, by a bridge, a deep\r\nravine. In it, some seventy feet below us, you see the dark water,\r\nperhaps of old the _fosse_, but now a modern commercial canal. A long,\r\nnarrow boat, much narrower than our canal-boats, laden with coals, is\r\ncoming from under the bridge; a woman is steering it, and on the cabin,\r\nin large, red letters, you see her name, “_Margaret Francis_,” and the\r\nname of the boat, the “_Telegraph_.” That arch was turned by a man now\r\nliving, but that course of stones—the dark ones between the ivy and the\r\nabutment—was laid by a Roman mason, when Rome was mistress of the world.\r\n\r\nWalk on. The wall is five feet wide on the top, with a parapet of\r\nstone on the outside, and an iron rail within. Don’t fear, though it\r\nis so far and deep to the canal, and the stone looks so time-worn and\r\ncrumbling; it is firm with true Roman cement, the blood of brave men.\r\nHere it is strengthened by a heavy tower, now somewhat dilapidated.\r\nLook up, and you see upon it a rude carving of a phœnix; under it an\r\nold tablet, with these words:—\r\n\r\n  “ON THIS TOWER STOOD CHARLES THE FIRST, AND SAW HIS ARMY DEFEATED.”\r\n\r\nWithin the tower is the stall of a newsman. Buy the London Times, which\r\nhas come some hundred miles since morning, with the information that\r\nyesterday the honourable president of a Peace Society was shot in a\r\nduel. (A fact.)\r\n\r\nPass on. On one side of us are tall chimneys, through which, from\r\nfierce forge fires, ascend black smoke and incense of bitumen to the\r\nglory of mammon. Close on the other side stands a venerable cathedral,\r\nbuilt by pious labour of devout men to the laud and service of their\r\nGod. We look into the burying-ground, and on the old gravestones\r\nobserve many familiar names of New England neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STREET SCENES._]\r\n\r\nNarrow brick houses are built close up to the wall again, and now on\r\nboth sides; the wall, which you can stride across, being their only\r\nstreet or way of access. Here, again, it crosses another broad road,\r\nand we are over another entrance to the city—the “_new gate_;” it is\r\nnot quite a century old. We look from it into the market-place. Narrow,\r\nsteep-gabled houses, with their second story frowning threateningly\r\nover the side-walks, surround it. But the market-building is modern.\r\nSee! the sparrow lighting on the iron roof burns her feet and flies\r\nhastily over to the heavy, old, brown thatch, where the little dormers\r\nstick out so clumsily cosy.\r\n\r\nOdd-looking vehicles and oddly-dressed people are passing in the\r\nstreet below us: a woman with a jacket, driving two stout horses in\r\none of those heavy farm-carts; an omnibus, very broad, and carrying\r\npassengers on the top as well as inside, with the sign of “The Green\r\nDragon;” the driver, smartly-dressed, tips his whip with a knowing nod\r\nto a pretty Welsh girl who is carrying a tub upon her head. There are\r\nlots of such damsels here, neat as possible, with dark eyes and glossy\r\nhair, half covered by white caps, and fine, plump forms, in short\r\nstriped petticoats and hob-nailed shoes. There goes one, straight as\r\na gun-barrel, with a great jar of milk upon her head. And here is a\r\nlittle donkey, with cans of milk slung on each side of him, and behind\r\nthem, so you cannot see why he does not slip off over his tail, is a\r\ngreat brute, with two legs in knee-breeches and blue stockings, bent\r\nup so as to be clear of the ground, striking him with a stout stick\r\nacross his long, expressive ears. A sooty-faced boy, with a Kilmarnock\r\nbonnet on his head, carrying two pewter mugs, coming towards us, jumps\r\nsuddenly one side, and, ha! out from under us, at a rattling pace,\r\ncomes a beautiful sorrel mare, with a handsome, tall, slightly-made\r\nyoung man in undress military uniform; close behind, and not badly\r\nmounted either, follow two others—one also in uniform, with a scarlet\r\ncap and a bright bugle swinging at his side; the other a groom in\r\nlivery, neat as a pin; odd again, to American eyes, those leather\r\nbreeches and bright top-boots. Who was it? Colonel Lord Grosvenor,\r\ngoing to review the yeomanry. We shall see them the other side of\r\nthe city. His grandfather built this gate and presented it to the\r\ncorporation; you may see his arms on the key-stone. But now go on.\r\n\r\nOn the left, you see an old church tower, and under it the ragged\r\noutline and darker coloured stone of still older masonry. A swallow has\r\njust found a cranny big enough to build her nest in, that Father Time\r\nhas been chiselling at now for eight hundred years. Eight hundred? Yes;\r\nit was _rebuilt_ then. You can see some of the _older_, original wall\r\nat the other end—no, not that round Saxon arch, but beyond the trees—a\r\nlow wall with a heavy clothing of ivy. The steamboat is just coming out\r\nfrom behind it now. In the year 973, King Edgar landed at this church\r\nfrom a boat, in which he had been rowed by eight kings, whom he had\r\nconquered. An ugly, smoky old tub is that steamboat; it would hardly be\r\nthought fit for the conveyance of criminals to prison in America. But\r\ndoubtless it is a faster and more commodious craft than King Edgar’s\r\neight-king power packet.\r\n\r\nWe cross another gateway, and pass a big mill. The dam was built, I\r\ndon’t know when. The Puritans, they say, tried to destroy it, for its\r\nbad name, perhaps, but could not, because, like a duck, it kept under\r\na high flood of water until the Cavaliers, making a rush to save it,\r\nspiked their guns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _QUEENS AND BEGGARS._]\r\n\r\nOur path turns suddenly, and runs along the face of a stone wall,\r\nsupported by brackets high above the water of the river, but some\r\ndistance below the parapets—parapets of a castle. Soon we pass a\r\nred-coated sentry, and now you see a tower that looks older than the\r\nrest. The battle-axes of William the Conqueror once clanged where that\r\nfellow is lounging with a cigar. Beyond, on the esplanade, were wont\r\nto assemble the formidable feudal armies of the Earls of Chester, whose\r\ntitle is now borne by the German Prince Albert’s eldest son. Quite a\r\ndifferent appearance they must have made from this regiment of Irishmen\r\nin red-cloth coats and leather helmets.\r\n\r\nStop a moment to look at the old bridge—step back to the angle—there\r\nyou see it—half a dozen arches of different forms and shades of colour,\r\nnot particularly handsome, but worth noticing. The blackest of the\r\narches was turned half a century before Jamestown was founded—that is,\r\nit was then _rebuilt_. The _old_ bridge, from which the stones for it\r\nwere taken, was built by Queen Ethefleda. Who was she? I am sure I\r\ndon’t know—some one who reigned here a thousand years ago, I believe,\r\nthough I never heard any thing else of her. You’ll be shown her\r\ngreat-grandmother’s cradle somewhere about town very likely.\r\n\r\nJust above is another bridge. What a fine arch! Yes; the longest in the\r\nworld, it is said. That was not built by a queen, but a little girl\r\nwas the first to cross it, who afterwards _developed up_ into “her\r\nmost gracious Majesty, Victoria, whom God long preserve,” as the loyal\r\nguide-book has it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“... Poor fellow! he is very lame, isn’t he!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he is begging; probably an impostor. Don’t encourage him.”\r\n\r\n“He only asks a penny to keep him from starving; his son has not been\r\nable to get any work lately, or he would not let him beg.”\r\n\r\n“Let him go to America; there’s enough work for him if he really wants\r\nit; it’s what they all say. Give him a ha’penny then, and be rid of\r\nhim. Now, look over there, between the trees, and see the entrance to\r\nthe Marquis of Westminster’s park.”—A great, fresh pile of bombastic\r\ntowers and battlements to shelter a gate and protect the woman who\r\nopens it from—rain and frost. It is but recently finished, and costs,\r\nsays the printer, £10,000.\r\n\r\nWhat says the beggar? Free trade and the Irish have cut down wages,\r\nsince he used to work on the farms, from five shillings to eighteen\r\npence. I don’t believe it.\r\n\r\nHe reasserts it, though. He has stood himself at Chester Cross on the\r\nmarket day, and refused to work for four and sixpence, and all the\r\nbeer he could drink. It may be true—the printer tells us; in the old\r\nBonaparte years, in harvest time, it was not unlikely to have been so.\r\nWith wheat at a guinea a bushel, the farmers did not have the worst of\r\nit even then. Those were good times for farmers. Soldiers can’t reap,\r\nbut they must eat. The government _borrowed_ money to pay the farmers\r\nfor supporting the war, and now the farmers are paying the debt.\r\n\r\n“Give me something to buy a little bread, good sirs,” repeats the old\r\nman; “I can’t work, and my son.... These dirty Irish and this cussed\r\nfree trade....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHark! horns and kettle-drums! Come on. It is the band of the yeomanry;\r\nwe shall see them directly.... There! Five squadrons of mounted men\r\ntrotting over a broad green meadow below us. Well mounted they seem\r\nto be, and well seated too. Ay; fox hunting will make good cavalry.\r\nDoubtless many of those fellows have been after the hounds.\r\n\r\nPossibly. But never one of them charged a buffalo herd, I’ll be bound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RUINS AND RAILROADS._]\r\n\r\nThis green plain—a sort of public lawn in front of the town—is about\r\ntwice as large as Boston Common, and is called “The Roodee.” It is free\r\nfrom trees, nothing but a handsome meadow, and a race-course runs\r\nround it. On this course, by the way, the greatest number of horses\r\never engaged in a single match have been run. In 1848, the entries were\r\none hundred and fifty-six, of which one hundred and six accepted.\r\n\r\nRight below us, on the meadow, there is pitched a _marquée_. It belongs\r\nto a cricket club. I want you to notice the beautiful green sward of\r\ntheir playing ground. It is shaven so clean and close. You see men are\r\nsweeping it with hair-brooms.\r\n\r\nHere again, in this garden on the other side of the wall, there used\r\nto be a nunnery. There is the entrance to a subterranean passage, by\r\nwhich, if you could keep a candle burning, you might pass under the\r\ncity back to the cathedral.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... Are you tired of ruins? Here is one more that may rouse your\r\nPuritan blood: a heavy tower built into the wall, connected with a\r\nlarger one at some distance outside. How old they look! No paintings\r\nand no descriptions had ever conveyed to me the effect of age upon the\r\nstone itself of these very old structures. How venerable! how stern!\r\nhow silent—yet telling what long stories! We will not ask for the\r\noldest of them, but—you see there, where the battlements are broken\r\ndown in one place—that breach was made by a ball thrown from the hill\r\nyonder; and the cannon that sent it was aimed by OLIVER CROMWELL.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful, how indescribably beautiful, are those thick masses of\r\ndark, glossy, green ivy, falling over the blackened old ramparts, like\r\nthe curls of a child asleep on its grandfather’s shoulder!—_Whew!_\r\ndon’t let the sparks get in your eye! They have pierced the wall right\r\nunder us, and here goes an express train fifty miles an hour, from\r\nIreland to London by way of Holyhead, with dispatches for her Majesty\r\n(by way of Lord Palmerston’s head). The Roman masonry that resisted\r\nthe Roundhead batteries, has yielded to the engines of peace.\r\n\r\nBut, as we move on, even higher marks of civilization are pointed out\r\nto us. Here, close to the wall, and in the shadow of the old tower,\r\nis a public bath and wash-house. A little back is a hospital for\r\nthe poor, and near it a house of correction. Across the valley is a\r\ngloomy-looking workhouse, and in another direction a much more cheering\r\ninstitution, beautifully placed on a hill, among fine, dark, evergreen\r\ntrees, through which you can see the bright sunshine and smile of\r\nGod falling upon it. It is the Training College—a normal school, for\r\npreparing teachers for the church schools of the diocese. And here,\r\non the left, as we approach the north gate again, is an old charity\r\nschool-house, the Blue-coat Hospital. The boys at play are all young\r\nGeorge Washingtons, dressed in long-skirted blue coats, and breeches,\r\nand stockings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... So here we are, back at the good-natured printer’s office, having\r\nbeen a circuit of three miles on the walls of the city. Its population\r\nis twenty-five thousand (mostly within). If you have observed that\r\nnearly all the houses are low, you will not suppose that much room\r\nis taken up by streets and unoccupied grounds, where that number is\r\naccommodated in such limited space, and you will be ready to explore\r\nthe interior with great curiosity. If your taste for the quaint\r\nand picturesque is at all like mine, you will be in no danger of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  CHESTER WITHIN.—PECULIARITIES OF BUILDING.—THE ROWS.—A\r\n    SEA-CAPTAIN.—ROMANCING.—AN OLD INN.—OLD ENGLISH TOWN HOUSES.—TIMBER\r\n    HOUSES.—CLAIMING AN INHERITANCE.—A COOK SHOP.—ONE OF THE\r\n    ALLEYS.—BREAKING INTO THE CATHEDRAL.—EXPULSION.—THE CURFEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OLD STREET ARRANGEMENT._]\r\n\r\nThe four gates of the city are opposite, and about equally distant\r\nfrom each other. Four streets run from them, meeting in the centre\r\nand dividing it into four quarters. These principal streets are from\r\none to three rods wide, and besides them there are only a few narrow\r\nalleys, in which carts can pass. But the whole city is honeycombed\r\nwith by-ways, varying from two to five feet in width; sometimes open\r\nabove, and sometimes built over; crooked and intricate, and if he cares\r\nwhere they lead him to, most puzzling to a stranger. Besides these\r\ncourts, alleys, and foot-paths, there is another highway peculiarity in\r\nChester, which it will be difficult to describe.\r\n\r\nImagine you have entered the gate with us after the walk about the\r\nwall. The second story of most the old houses is thrown forward, as\r\nyou have seen it in the “old settler’s” houses at home. Sometimes it\r\nprojects several feet, and is supported by posts in the sidewalk.\r\nSoon this becomes a frequent, and then a continuous arrangement; the\r\nposts are generally of stone, forming an arcade, and you walk behind\r\nthem in the shade. Sometimes, instead of posts, a solid wall supports\r\nthe upper house. You observe, as would be likely in an old city,\r\nthat the surface is irregular; we are ascending a slight elevation.\r\nNotwithstanding the old structure overhead, and the well-worn, thick,\r\nold flagging under foot, we notice the shop fronts are finished with\r\nplate-glass, and all the brilliancy of the most modern commercial art\r\nand taste. Turning, to make the contrast more striking, by looking at\r\nthe little windows and rude carvings of the houses opposite, we see a\r\nbannister or hand-rail separates the sidewalk from the carriage-way,\r\nand are astonished, in stepping out to it, to find the street is some\r\nten feet below us. We are evidently in the second story of the houses.\r\nFinding steps leading down, we descend into the streets and discover\r\nanother tier of shops, on the roofs of which we have been walking.\r\n\r\nGoing on, we shortly come to where the streets meet in the centre of\r\nthe town. Passing over the ground where the _cross_, and the pillory,\r\nand other institutions of religion, and justice, and merry-making\r\nformerly stood, we ascend steps, and are again in one of those singular\r\nwalks called by the inhabitants the Rows. There are no more stylish\r\nshop fronts, but dark doorways and old windows again, and on almost\r\nevery door-post little black and red checkers, which hieroglyphics,\r\nif you are not sufficiently versed in Falstaffian lore to understand,\r\nyou can find rendered in plain black and white queen’s English (or\r\npeople’s English by our law), under some woman’s name, painted on the\r\nbeam overhead—“Licensed to sell beer,” &c. Generally there will be an\r\nadditional sign, naming the inn or tavern, always in letters and almost\r\nnever in portraiture. I remember “The Crown and Castle,” “The Crown and\r\nAnchor,” “The Castle and Falcon,” “The King’s Head,” “The Black Bear,”\r\n“The Blue Boar,” “The Pied Bull,” “The Green Dragon,” “The White Lion,”\r\n“The Sun and Apple Tree,” “The Colliers’ Arms,” “The Arms of Man,” “The\r\nMalt Shovel,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nInstead of columns and a hand-rail, or a dead-wall on the street side\r\nof the row, it is now and then contracted by a room, which is sometimes\r\noccupied by a shop, and sometimes seems to be used as a vestibule and\r\nstaircase to apartments overhead, for we see a brass plate with the\r\nresident’s name, and a bell-pull, to the door.\r\n\r\nOn the inner side are frequent entrances to the narrow passages that I\r\nmentioned, which may be long substitutes for streets, communicating,\r\nafter a deal of turning and splitting into branches, with some distant\r\nalley or churchyard, or other main street, with the front doors of\r\nwealthy citizens’ houses opening upon them; or they may be merely\r\nalleys between two tenements leading to a common yard in the rear; or\r\nagain, if you turn into one, it may turn out to be a private hall,\r\nand after one or two short turns end in a kitchen. Never mind—don’t\r\nretreat; put on a bold face, take a seat by the fire as if you were\r\nat home, and call for a mug of beer. Ten to one it will be all right.\r\nEvery other housekeeper, at least, is a licensed taverner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HOUSE HUNTING.—THE OLD SHIP-MASTER._]\r\n\r\nWe had great sport the first hour or two we were in town hunting for\r\nlodgings. We were disposed to sleep under the very oldest English\r\narchitecture in which we could be comfortably accommodated. Many of\r\nthe places at which we applied were merely houses of refreshment, and\r\nhad no spare bedrooms. In one of these, “The Boot Inn,” we found an\r\nold sea-captain, who, some twenty years ago, had traded to New York,\r\nand enjoyed talking and making inquiries about persons he had met and\r\nplaces he had visited. Fortunately we knew some of them, and so were\r\nconstrained to sit down to some bread and cheese and beer, and listen\r\nto some tough yarns of Yellow Jack and Barbary pirates. At one end of\r\nthe kitchen was a table with benches on three sides of it, and a great\r\narm-chair on the other. Over the chair hung a union-jack, and before\r\nit on the table was a strongly-bound book, which proved to be “The\r\nRecord of the Boot Inn Birthday Club.” The bond entered into by each\r\nmember on entering this association was, that he should treat the club\r\nto plenty of good malt liquor on his every future birthday. There was\r\na constitution and many by-laws, the penalty for breaking which was\r\nalways to be paid in “beer for the club.”\r\n\r\nAt other inns we would be shown, by delightfully steep, narrow,\r\ncrooked, and every way possible inconvenient stairways, up through\r\nlow, dark spaces of inclined plane, into long, steep-roofed,\r\npigeon-house-like rooms, having an air as gloomy and mysterious as it\r\nwas hot and close. Then, upon our declining to avail ourselves of such\r\nromantic and typhous accommodations, instead of being reconducted down\r\nby the tortuous path of our ascent, we would be shown, through a back\r\ndoor in the third story, out upon a passage that seemed to be also\r\nused as a public street (footway), doors opening from it which were\r\nevidently entrances to residences in the rear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OLD ENGLISH INTERIOR._]\r\n\r\nFinally we were suited; and now I am writing on an old oak table, with\r\nspiral legs, sitting in an old oak chair, with an Elizabethan carved\r\nback, my feet on an old oak floor (rather wavy), stout old oak beams\r\nover my head, and low walls of old oak wainscot all around me. Resting\r\non an old oak bench by the window, is a young man with a broad-brimmed\r\nfelt hat slouched half over his face. Across the street, so near we\r\nmight jump into it if we were attacked from the rear, is a house with\r\nthe most grotesquely-carved and acutely-pointed gable possible to be\r\nbelieved real, and not a pasteboard scene, with the date “1539” cut in\r\nawkward figures over the cockloft window, high in the apex. For fifteen\r\nminutes there has been a regular “_clink, clink_,” deadening all other\r\nsounds but the clash of sabres against spurs, and distant bugle-calls,\r\nas a body of horsemen are passing in compact columns through the narrow\r\nstreet, from the castle, out by the north gate, towards _Rowton Moor_.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it is a California and not a Cavalier sombrero that shades\r\nmy friend, and the men of war outside are but mild militiamen, carrying\r\npercussion-lock carbines indeed, but who have fought for nothing so\r\nvaliantly as for the corn laws. But when shall I again get as near as\r\nthis to _Prince_ Charlie and the Ironsides? and shall I not make the\r\nmost of it? At least, there is no prompter’s bell, no carpenters in\r\ntheir shirt-sleeves rushing in and sliding off the scenery. That 1539\r\nover the way is TRUE; I can see the sun shine into the figures. Away,\r\nthen, with your 1850! I will drink only old wine—or better—_What ho! a\r\ncup of sack!_ Shall I not take it easy in mine inn?\r\n\r\nThe house is full of most unexplainable passages and unaccountable\r\nrecesses, of great low rooms and little high rooms, with ceilings in\r\nvarious angles to the walls, and the floor of every one at a different\r\nelevation from every other, so that from the same landing you step up\r\ninto one and down into another, and so on. Back of a little kitchen\r\nand big pantry, down stairs, we have another parlour. In it is a grand\r\nold chimney, and opposite the fireplace a window, the only one in the\r\nroom. It is but three feet high, but, except the room occupied by a\r\nglass _buffet_ in one corner and a turned-up round-table in the other,\r\nreaches from wall to wall. To look out of it, you step on to a raised\r\nplatform, about three feet broad, in front of it, and on this is an\r\nold, long, high-backed _settee_. I must confess that it is not the less\r\npleasant in the evening for an unantique gas-light.\r\n\r\nAs I lay in bed last night, I counted against the moon seventy-five\r\npanes of glass in the single window of our sleeping apartment. The\r\nlargest of them was four by three, and the smallest three by one\r\ninches. They are set in lead sashes, and the outer frame is of iron,\r\nopening horizontally on hinges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ENGLISH DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE\r\n(_Chester, 16th century_)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OLD CARVINGS.—THE FATHER LAND._]\r\n\r\nThere are none but _timber houses_ all about us; the walls white\r\nor yellow, and the timbers black. The roofs are often as steep as\r\nforty-five degrees with the horizon, and the gables always front on\r\nthe street. If the house is large there will be several gables, and\r\neach successive story juts out, overhanging the face of that below.\r\nThere is no finical verge-board, or flimsy “drapery” in the gable,\r\nbut the outermost rafter (a stout beam that you cannot expect to see\r\nwarped off or blown away) is boldly projected, and your attention\r\nperhaps invited to it by ornamental carving. Porches, bow-windows,\r\ndormers, galleries (in the rows), and all the prominent features of the\r\nbuilding are generally more or less rudely carved. One house near us is\r\ncompletely covered with figures. C. says they represent Bible scenes.\r\nThere is one compartment which he supposes a tableau of the sacrifice\r\nof Isaac, Abraham being represented, according to his _exegesis_, by a\r\nbearded figure dressed in long flapped waistcoat and knee-breeches.\r\n\r\nAnother house has these words cut in the principal horizontal beam:\r\n_God’s Providence is mine Inheritance_—1652. It is said the family\r\nresiding in it was the only one in the city that entirely escaped the\r\ngreat plague of that year.\r\n\r\nYou may imagine how intensely interesting all this is. We cannot keep\r\nstill, but run about with a real boyish excitement. We feel indeed like\r\nchildren that have come back to visit the paternal house, and who are\r\nrummaging about in the garret among their father’s playthings, ever\r\nand anon shouting, “See what I’ve found! see what I’ve found!” If we\r\nhad been brought here blindfolded from America, and were now, after\r\ntwo days’ visit, sent back again, we should feel well repaid for the\r\nlong sea-passage. If we were to stay here a month, we should scarcely\r\nenjoy less than we now do, rambling about among these relics of our old\r\nEngland.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Some months later than this we were at a supper party, after\r\nsome old English ballads and songs had been sung, when one of the\r\ncompany apologized for it, saying, “We forget our American friends.\r\nIt is selfish in us to sing only these national songs in which we are\r\npeculiarly interested. Have you nothing American, now?” “Excuse me,\r\nsir,” I replied, “those are our national songs as much as yours. You\r\nforget that we are also countrymen of Will Shakspeare, and Robin Hood,\r\nand Richard the Lion-hearted. Our mothers danced with your fathers\r\nunder that same ‘green-wood,’ and around the ‘May-pole.’ Our fathers\r\nfought for their right in this land against Turk, Frenchman, Spaniard,\r\nand Pretender. We have as much pride in Old England, gentlemen, as any\r\nof you. We claim the right to make ourselves _at home_ on that ground\r\nwith you. You must not treat us as strangers.” “You are right; you are\r\nwelcome. Give us your hand. The old blood will tell!” And the whole\r\ntable rose with a hurrah, shaking our hands with a warmth that only\r\npatriotic pride will excuse among Englishmen.\r\n\r\nGoing into a cook-shop for supper, the first afternoon we were in\r\nChester, we were shown through three apartments into a kitchen, and\r\nfrom that into a long, narrow, irregularly-shaped room, with one little\r\nwindow high above our heads, and twenty-seven old wood engravings in\r\nframes about the walls. We had a very tolerable supper given us, and\r\nwere served by a six-foot-high Welsh girl that could understand but\r\nlittle of our English. When we were ready to leave, a back door was\r\nopened, and we were told that the first opening to the left would bring\r\nus to the street. We found ourselves in one of the narrow covered\r\nways, and instead of turning off to the street as directed, kept on\r\nin it to go where it should happen to lead. Sometimes wide, sometimes\r\nnarrow, running first, as it appeared, between a man’s kitchen and\r\nhis dining-room; then into a dust-yard; then suddenly narrowed, and\r\nturned one side by a stable; then opening into a yard, across which a\r\nwoman over a wash-tub was scolding her husband, sitting with a baby\r\nand smoking at a window; then through a blacksmith’s shop into a long,\r\ndark, crooked, passage, like the gallery of a mine, at the other end of\r\nwhich we found ourselves on a paved street not far from the cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CURFEW BELL._]\r\n\r\nWe entered the burying-ground, and seeing that a small door, that is\r\ncut in the large door of the cathedral, was ajar, pushed it open and\r\nwent in. It was dark, silent, and chill. We felt strangely as we groped\r\nour way over the unobstructed stone floor, and could make nothing of it\r\nuntil our eyes, becoming adapted to the dimness, we discovered gilded\r\norgan-pipes, and were going towards them, when a small door in front of\r\nus was opened, and a man came out, saying impatiently, “Who _are_ you?\r\nwhat do you want? Take off your hats.”\r\n\r\n“We are strangers, looking at the cathedral.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t see it, now; can’t see it, now. Service every day at four and\r\nten o’clock.”\r\n\r\nAs we were going out, a great bell began to toll. “What is that, sir?”\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That bell tolling—what is it for?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s the cuffew,” and he closed and bolted the door, while we\r\nstood still without; and as the long waving boom of the bell pulsed\r\nthrough us, looked wonderingly at each other, as if America and the\r\nnineteenth century were a fading dream, slowly repeating, “The curfew;\r\nthe curfew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  CHESTER MARKET.—THE TOWN COMMON.—RACE-COURSE.—THE YEOMANRY CAVALRY,\r\n    AND THE MILITIA OF ENGLAND.—PUBLIC WASH-HOUSE.—“MR. CHAIRMAN.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after we came to Chester was market-day, and the streets were\r\nbusy at an early hour with people coming in from the country to sell\r\nproduce or purchase the supplies for their families for the coming\r\nweek. The quantity of butter exposed for sale was very large, and\r\nthe quality excellent. The fish-market also was finely supplied. The\r\ndealing in both these articles was mostly done by women.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] We noted the following as the common prices:—\r\n\r\n  Butchers’ meat, 10 to 14 cents per lb.\r\n  Best fresh butter in balls of 1½ lbs., 35 cents.\r\n  Salmon, fresh from the Dee, 35 cents per lb.\r\n  Turbot, 35 cents per lb.\r\n  Soles and other fish, 16 cents per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MILITIA SYSTEM OF ENGLAND._]\r\n\r\nAfter walking through the market we went to the Roodee, and there saw\r\nthe yeomanry reviewed. They wore a snug blue uniform, were armed with\r\nsabres, carbines, and pistols, and were rather better mounted and\r\ndrilled than any of our mounted militia that I have seen. The active\r\ncommander seemed to be a regular martinet. If the lines got much out of\r\ndress while on the trot, he would dash up, shaking his fist, and loudly\r\ncursing the squadron at fault. I noticed, also, that when pleased he\r\nsometimes addressed them in the ranks as “gentlemen.” He was probably\r\nsome old army officer, engaged to drill them.\r\n\r\nA young man in the dress of an officer, but dismounted, said, in answer\r\nto our inquiries, that their number was 800, in five companies. Most\r\nof them were farmers, every farmer of a certain age in the county (as\r\nwe understood him) being obliged to serve three years, but allowed to\r\nsend a substitute if he chooses, and sometimes is represented by his\r\nservant. They are out but once a year for training, and then for eight\r\ndays, and while engaged receive 75 cents a day. They can not be ordered\r\nout of the country, and are never called into any active service,\r\nexcept to quell riots.\r\n\r\nI frequently asked afterwards for more information about the yeomanry,\r\nbut never of a person that seemed to know much about them. A man in the\r\nranks of the Denbighshire yeomanry told us the service was optional.\r\nIn some counties there is no such body, and the organization, laws,\r\nand customs of it seem to vary in the different regiments. There is\r\na regular foot-militia organization throughout England (the “train\r\nbands”), but none of them, I believe, have been paraded for many years.\r\n\r\nAccording to a parliamentary return of 1838, there were then of the\r\nmounted yeomanry, 251 troops and 13,594 privates; the annual expense of\r\nmaintaining them was $525,000. The enrolled militia of England in 1838\r\nnumbered 200,000 men. The officers of these forces, when in service,\r\n_rank_ with those of the army of the same grade. A part of the uniform\r\nand mountings of the yeomanry are paid for by the government, and some\r\nsmall daily compensation is allowed the privates when in service. A\r\ndrill-sergeant and a trumpeter is also permanently attached to each\r\ntroop, with a salary from the state.\r\n\r\nNAPIER mentions that the greater part of the 16,000 British troops\r\nwho gained the battle of Talavera were men drafted from the militia at\r\nhome, and that they had but very recently joined the army in Spain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComing up from the Roodee, we visited the castle. It is of no\r\nimportance in a military way, except as a depôt. There are 30,000\r\nstand of arms, and a large quantity of gunpowder stored in it. It is\r\ngarrisoned by an Irish regiment at present, which, as well as the\r\nyeomanry, has a very good band of music, by which the town benefits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PUBLIC WASHHOUSE.—MODERATE DRINKER._]\r\n\r\nWe afterwards visited the public baths and wash-house. In its basement\r\nthere are twenty square tubs, each with hot and cold water cocks,\r\nwash-board, and pounder, a drying-closet heated by steam to 212° F.,\r\n&c. In the first story are the usual private baths, and a swimming\r\ntank or public bath, having a constant influx of fresh water by a jet\r\nfrom below, and an overflow. It is 45 by 36 feet, 2½ feet deep at one\r\nend, 6 at the other, contains 36,000 gallons, and is furnished with\r\nswings, diving-stage, life-buoys, &c. It was built by a committee of\r\nthe citizens, and bought by the town very soon after it went into\r\noperation. The whole cost was $10,000, most of which was raised by a\r\nstock subscription. The water is supplied from the canal, and is all\r\nfiltered—the cost of the filtering machine being $200. The principal\r\nitems of current expenses are fuel and salaries. The cost of coal (very\r\nlow here) is $5 a week. There are four persons constantly employed\r\nin the establishment, viz., superintendent and wife, who are paid\r\n$10 a week, and receive something besides as perquisites (supplying\r\nbathing-dresses, for instance, at a small charge); the bath-attendant,\r\nand the fireman, who each have $7.50 a week. Total salaries $25 a week.\r\nThe charges for the use of the clothes-washing conveniences is about\r\none cent an hour. For the baths it varies from two to twenty-five\r\ncents, select hours being appointed for those who choose, by paying a\r\nlarger sum, to avoid a crowd. There are also commutations by the year\r\nat lower rates: boys, for instance, have a yearly ticket for a little\r\nover a dollar. During the first year it has something more than paid\r\nexpenses. The number of bathers the last week (in May) was over one\r\nthousand. I mention these statistics, as this establishment is rather\r\nsmaller than most of the kind, and they may serve the projectors of a\r\nsimilar one in some of our smaller cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had had at breakfast the company of a little, fat dignified person,\r\nwhose talk much amused us by its likeness to that of some of Dickens’\r\ncharacters. On returning to the inn at noon, we found sitting with\r\nhim a cadaverous-faced man, with long hair, and very seedy clothes,\r\nwho seemed from his expressions to be an artist. Beer had just been\r\nbrought into them as we entered, but the painter after taking a long\r\ndraught, mildly suggested that “something stronger might facilitate\r\nbusiness.” The fussy man replied that he never took any thing but malt\r\nliquors before dinner. The artist said that he required something\r\nmore. “I haven’t had any thing but beer this morning, except a couple\r\nof glasses of brandy, and a little go o’rum with a dab of butter and\r\nsugar in it.” Here he looked at me with a smile and a nod, that invited\r\nmy good fellowship, and I ventured to ask how much beer he might have\r\nhad besides that. “Not more than half a dozen glasses, sir.” “Really,\r\nI should have supposed that would be drink enough for half a day.”\r\n“Not for a man like me; I have drank thirty-six glasses—half pints—of\r\nstrong Welsh ale in a day, and all the better of it.” The stout man\r\nsaid he never drank over a dozen, or at the highest, fifteen, in a\r\nday, and never, except in peculiar circumstances, took spirits before\r\ndinner; after dinner he would go as far as any body. He often had to\r\npreside at public dinners, and though of course, he then, for the sake\r\nof example, had to drink more than any one else, he always kept on\r\nhis seat as long as there was any one to drink with him, “as you very\r\nwell know, sir,” he added, appealing to the artist. “Undoubtedly, Mr.\r\nChairman,” the latter replied, “_un_doubtedly, sir.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  VISIT TO EATON HALL.—THE LARGEST ARCH IN THE WORLD.—THE OUTER\r\n    PARK.—BACKWOODS’ FARMING.—THE DEER PARK.—THE HALL.—THE PARTERRE.—\r\n    THE LAWN.—THE FRUIT GARDEN.—STABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LANDSCAPE GARDENING._]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we walked to Eaton park.\r\n\r\nProbably there is no object of art that Americans of cultivated\r\ntaste generally more long to see in Europe, than an English park.\r\nWhat artist, so noble, has often been my thought, as he, who with\r\nfar-reaching conception of beauty and designing power, sketches the\r\noutline, writes the colours, and directs the shadows of a picture so\r\ngreat that Nature shall be employed upon it for generations, before the\r\nwork he has arranged for her shall realize his intentions.\r\n\r\nEaton hall and park is _one_ of the seats of the Marquis of\r\nWestminster, a very wealthy nobleman, who has lately been named “Lord\r\nHigh Chamberlain to her Majesty,” a kind of state-housekeeper or\r\nsteward, I take it—an office which Punch, and a common report of a\r\nniggardly disposition in his private affairs, deems him particularly\r\nappropriate to.\r\n\r\nWe left town by the new, or Grosvenor bridge—a simple, grand, and every\r\nway excellent work, crossing the Dee by a single arch, which we are\r\ntold is the largest in the world. It is entirely free from decorative\r\nornament, and the effect of it, as seen looking from the river side,\r\nis most imposing. I know of nothing in America to compare with it. It\r\nwas built by the marquis, whose family name is Grosvenor, at a cost of\r\n$180,000 (£36,000). The designer was Thomas Harrison, an architect of\r\nnote, who formerly lived in Chester.[13]\r\n\r\n[13] The main arch spans two hundred feet, and its height is forty\r\nfeet, and there two dry arches, each twenty feet wide and forty feet\r\nhigh. From the surface of the water to the road is over sixty feet.\r\nThe parapet walls are three hundred and fifty feet long, with a\r\ncarriage-way and foot-path between, of thirty feet.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the road we found an oratory, or small chapel, building,\r\nand gardeners laying out grounds for a rural cemetery. Beyond this we\r\ncame to the great castellated edifice that I have before spoken of as\r\nthe gateway to the park. Such we were told it was, and were therefore\r\nsurprised to find within only a long, straight road, with but tolerable\r\nmowing lots alternating by the side of it, with thick plantations of\r\ntrees, no way differing from the twenty-year old natural wood of my\r\nown farm, except that hollies, laurels, and our common dog-wood were\r\nplanted regularly along the edge. After a while we pushed into this\r\nwood, to see if we could not scare up some of the deer. We soon saw\r\ndaylight on the outside, and about twelve rods from the road, came\r\nto an open field, separated from the road only by a common Yankee\r\nthree-rail fence, which I had not expected to see in England; very poor\r\nit was too, at that.\r\n\r\nA stout boy, leaning heavily on the stilts, was ploughing the\r\nstubble-ground (apparently a _summer fallow_). We jumped over and asked\r\nwhat crop the ground was preparing for. The horses stopped of their own\r\naccord when we spoke. The boy turned and sat upon the stilts-brace, and\r\nthen answered—“Erdnow.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GENTLEMAN FARMING.—PARK SCENERY._]\r\n\r\nThe same answer, or some other sounds that we could not guess the\r\nmeaning of, followed several other questions. The plough had a wooden\r\nbeam, bound round with hoop iron. The horses, one black and the other\r\nwhite, seemed to be worn-out hacks; the harness was mended with bits\r\nof rope; the furrows were crooked and badly turned. Altogether, a\r\nmore unfarmer-like turn-out, and a worse piece of work I never saw in\r\nour own backwoods. When we last saw the ploughman, he had taken off\r\nhis woollen cap and seemed about lighting a pipe, and the horses were\r\nbeginning to nibble at the stubble, which stuck up in tufts all over\r\nthe ploughed ground. In getting back to the road we crossed a low spot,\r\nsinking ankle deep in mire, and noticed several trees not eight inches\r\nthick, which showed signs of decay.\r\n\r\nWe tramped on for several miles through this tame scenery and most\r\nungentlemanly farming, until it became really tiresome. At length the\r\nwood fell back, and the road was lined for some way with a double row\r\nof fine elms. Still no deer. A little further, and we came to a cottage\r\nmost beautifully draped with ivy; passed through another gate. Ah! here\r\nis the real park at last.\r\n\r\nA gracefully, irregular, gently undulating surface of close-cropped\r\npasture land, reaching way off inimitably; dark green in colour;\r\nvery old, but not very large trees scattered singly and in groups—so\r\nfar apart as to throw long unbroken shadows across broad openings of\r\nlight, and leave the view in several directions unobstructed for a\r\nlong distance. Herds of fallow-deer, fawns, cattle, sheep, and lambs\r\nquietly feeding near us, and moving slowly in masses at a distance; a\r\nwarm atmosphere, descending sun, and sublime shadows from fleecy clouds\r\ntransiently darkening in succession, sunny surface, cool woodside,\r\nflocks and herds, and foliage.\r\n\r\nThe road ran on winding through this. We drew a long breath, and walked\r\nslowly for a little way, then turned aside at the nearest tree, and lay\r\ndown to take it all in satisfactorily. Then we rose and went among\r\nthe deer. They were small and lean, all with their heads down feeding.\r\nAmong them was one pure white fawn. I believe none of them had antlers,\r\nor more than mere prongs. They seemed to be quite as tame as the sheep;\r\nbut suddenly, as we came still nearer, all, as if one, raised high\r\ntheir heads, and bounded off in a high springing gallop. After going\r\na few rods, one stopped short, and facing about, stood alone with\r\nears erect, and gleaming eyes, intent upon us. A few rods further the\r\nwhole herd stopped and stood in the same way, looking at us. One by\r\none the heads again dropped; a fawn stepped out from among them; the\r\none nearest us turned and trotted to it, and then all fell quietly to\r\nfeeding again.\r\n\r\nThe sheep were of a large, coarse-woolled variety, some of them nearly\r\nas large, only not standing quite so high, as the deer—not handsome at\r\nall (as sheep) even for a mutton breed; but in groups at a distance,\r\nand against the shadows, far prettier than the deer. The cattle were\r\nshort horned, large, dapple skinned, sleek, and handsome, but not\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nWe concluded that the sheep and cattle were of the most value for their\r\neffect in the landscape; but it was a little exciting to us to watch\r\nthe deer, particularly as we would some times see them in a large herd\r\nleisurely moving across an opening among the trees, a long way off, and\r\nbarely distinguishable; or still more when one, two, or three, which\r\nhad been separated from a nearer herd, suddenly started, and dashed\r\nwildly by us, within pistol shot.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they are as large as our Maine fallow deer.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they’d taste as good as they did _that night_.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I reckon not—no hemlock to toast them over.”\r\n\r\n“Or to sleep on afterwards, eh!”\r\n\r\n“And no wolves to keep you awake.”\r\n\r\n“No! How the bloody rascals did howl that night though, didn’t they?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ETON HALL.—THE POINTED GOTHIC._]\r\n\r\nFollowing the carriage road, we came near a mass of shrubbery, over and\r\nbeyond which the trees were closer and taller. It was separated from\r\nthe deer park by an iron fence. Passing this by another light gate, and\r\nthrough a screen of thick underwood, we found ourselves close to the\r\nentrance front of the Hall.\r\n\r\n  “It is considered the most splendid specimen of the pointed Gothic.\r\n  It consists of a centre and three stories, finished with octagonal\r\n  turrets, connected with the main part by lofty intermediate towers,\r\n  the whole enriched by buttresses, niches, and pinnacles, and adorned\r\n  with elaborately carved heraldic designs, fretwork, and foliage,\r\n  surmounted throughout by an enriched battlement.”\r\n\r\nSo much from the Guide Book. It is not my business to attempt a\r\ncriticism of “the finest specimen of the pointed Gothic” in England;\r\nbut I may honestly say that it did not, as a whole, produce the\r\nexpected effect of grandeur or sublimity upon us, without trying to\r\nfind reasons for the failure. Even when we came to look at it closely,\r\nwe found little to admire. There was no great simple beauty in it as a\r\nmass, nor yet vigorous original character enough in the details to make\r\nthem an interesting study. The edifice is long and low, and covered\r\nwith an immense amount of meaningless decoration.\r\n\r\nSuch was our first impression, and we were greatly disappointed, you\r\nmay be sure. We admired it more afterwards on the other side, from the\r\nmiddle of a great garden, where it seems to stand much higher, being\r\nset up on terraces, and gaining much, I suspect, from the extension\r\nof architectural character to the grounds in its front. Here we\r\nacknowledged a good deal of magnificence in its effect. Still it seemed\r\nas if it might have been obtained in some other style, with less\r\nlabour, and was much frittered away in the confusion of ornament.\r\n\r\nThis garden is a curiosity. It is in the geometrical style, and covers\r\neight acres, it is said, though it does not seem nearly that to the\r\neye. It is merely a succession of small arabesque figures of fine\r\ngrass or flower beds, set in hard, rolled, dark-coloured gravel. The\r\nsurface, dropping by long terraces from the steps of the hall to the\r\nriver, is otherwise only varied by stiff pyramidal yews and box, and\r\na few vases. On the whole, the effect of it in connection with the\r\nhouse, and looking towards it, is good, more so than I should have\r\nexpected; and it falls so rapidly, that it affects the landscape seen\r\nin this direction _from_ the house but very little. This is exquisitely\r\nbeautiful, looking across the Dee, over a lovely valley towards some\r\nhigh, blue mountains. From other parts of the hall grand vistas open\r\nthrough long avenues of elms, and there are some noble single trees\r\nabout the lawn.\r\n\r\nThis English elm is a much finer tree than I had been aware of—very\r\ntall, yet with drooping limbs and fine thick foliage; not nearly as\r\nfine as a single tree as our elm, but even more effective, I think, in\r\nmasses, because thicker and better filled out in its general outline.\r\n\r\nThe hall was undergoing extensive alterations and repairs; and all the\r\ngrounds immediately about it, except the terrace garden, were lumbered\r\nup with brick and stone, and masons’ sheds, and in complete confusion.\r\nBeing Saturday, all the workmen had left, and it was long before we\r\ncould find any one about the house. We had got very thirsty, and\r\nconsidering that such a place would not be left without any tenants,\r\ndetermined to rouse them out and get a drink. After hammering for some\r\ntime at a door under the principal entrance, a woman came and opened it\r\na few inches, and learning our wish, brought us a glass of water, which\r\nshe passed out through the narrow opening, never showing her face. We\r\nwere amused at this, which she perceiving, told us the door was chained\r\nand padlocked, so she could not open it wider.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BOX STABLES._]\r\n\r\nSoon after, while looking for an entrance to the fruit garden, we met\r\na gamekeeper, who was followed by a pet cub fox. He very obligingly,\r\nand with a gentlemanly manner showed us through such parts of the\r\nestablishment as he was able to. There was nothing remarkable in\r\nthe gardens or glass-houses, except some very large and wonderfully\r\nwell-trained fruit trees on walls. Every thing was neglected now,\r\nhowever, and we did no more than glance at them. There were some new\r\nstables nearly finished, the plans of which I studied with interest.\r\nEach horse is to have a private box for himself. I do not recollect the\r\nexact size, but it is at least twelve feet square on the floor, and\r\nmore than that high. In the ceiling is a ventilator, and in one corner\r\nan iron rack for hay (much like a fire-grate), and there is probably\r\nintended to be a small manger for fine and wet feed. There is a grating\r\nfor drainage in the floor, and, besides these, no other fixtures\r\nwhatever. The horse is to be left free within the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  GAMEKEEPER.—GAME PRESERVES.—ECCLESTON, A PRETTY VILLAGE.—THE\r\n    SCHOOL-HOUSE.—DRAINING.—CHILDREN PLAYING.—THE RIVER-SIDE\r\n    WALK.—PLEASURE PARTIES.—A CONTRASTING GLIMPSE OF A SAD\r\n    HEART.—SATURDAY NIGHT.—BALLAD SINGER.—MENDICANTS.—ROW IN THE\r\n    TAP-ROOM.—WOMAN’S FEEBLENESS.—CHESTER BEER, AND BEER-DRINKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper advised us to return to Chester by another road, and\r\nfollowing his direction, we found a delightful path by the river side.\r\nWe had not gone far before we overtook another keeper carrying a gun.\r\nIt is hard for us to look upon wild game as property, and it seemed as\r\nif the temptation to poach upon it must be often irresistible to a poor\r\nman. It must have a bad effect upon the moral character of a community\r\nfor the law to deal with any man as a criminal for an act which in his\r\nown conscience is not deemed sinful. Even this keeper seemed to look\r\nupon poaching as not at all wrong—merely a trial of adroitness between\r\nthe poacher and himself, though it was plain that detection would place\r\nthe poacher among common swindlers and thieves, exclude him from the\r\nsociety of the religious, and from reputable employment, and make the\r\nfuture support of life by unlawful means almost a necessity. He said,\r\nhowever, there was very little poaching in the neighbourhood. Most\r\nof the farmers were allowed to shoot within certain limits, and the\r\nlabouring class were generally wanting in either the means or the pluck\r\nto attempt it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GAME PRESERVES._]\r\n\r\nEvidently a man has a right to foster and increase the natural stock\r\nof wild game upon his own land, that is, in a degree to domesticate\r\nit; and the law should protect him in the enjoyment of the results of\r\nthe labour and pains he has taken for this purpose. The exceedingly\r\nindefinite and undefinable character of such property, however, makes\r\nthe attempt to preserve it inexpedient, and often leads to injustice;\r\nand when the preserve is sustained at the expense of very great injury\r\nto more important means of sustaining human life in a half-starved\r\ncommunity, the poacher is more excusable than the proprietor.\r\n\r\nThat this is often the case in England I more than once saw evidence. A\r\npicture, drawn by the agricultural correspondent of the _London Times_\r\nof Nov. 11, 1851, represents a scene of this kind, more remarkable\r\nhowever than any that came under my notice:\r\n\r\n“At Stamford we passed into Northamptonshire, obtaining a glimpse of\r\nthe Marquis of Exeter’s finely wooded park and mansion of Burleigh.\r\nThis magnificent place, founded by Queen Elizabeth’s Lord Treasurer\r\nCecil, with its grand old trees and noble park, is just the place to\r\nwhich a foreigner should be taken to give him an idea of the wealth of\r\nour English nobility.\r\n\r\n“The tenants on this estate are represented as being in the most\r\nhopeless state of despondency on account of the present low prices\r\nof agricultural produce, and as they were complaining vehemently,\r\nthe marquis offered to have the farms of any tenants who desired it\r\nrevalued. Only one on this great estate accepted the offer. There have\r\nbeen no farms of any consequence yet given up, and for those which\r\ndo come into the market there are plenty of offerers, though men of\r\ncapital are becoming chary, and will only look at very desirable farms.\r\nThe estate is said to be low-rented. Small farmers, of whom there are\r\nmany, are suffering most severely, as they have not saved any thing in\r\ngood times to fall back upon now. Some of them are, indeed, greatly\r\nreduced, and we heard of one who had applied to his parish for relief.\r\nOthers have sold every thing off their farms, and some, we were told,\r\nhad not even seed corn left with which to sow their fields.\r\n\r\n“In a fine country, with a gently undulating surface and a soil dry\r\nand easy of culture, laid into large fields moderately rented, one\r\nis surprised to hear that there is so much complaint and so much\r\nreal suffering among the poorer class of farmers. It is only in part\r\naccounted for by the devastation of game, which on this and some other\r\nnoblemen’s estates in North Northamptonshire is still most strictly\r\npreserved. On the 24th of January last, seven guns, as we were told,\r\non the marquis’s estate killed 430 head of game, a most immoderate\r\nquantity at such a late period of the season. The fields are all stuck\r\nabout with bushes to prevent the poachers netting; and the farmers feel\r\nmost severely the losses they sustain in order that their landlord and\r\nhis friends may not be deprived of their sport. The strict preservation\r\nof game on this and some other estates in the northern parts of the\r\ncounty was described to us in the bitterest terms, as ‘completely\r\neating up the tenant farmer, and against which no man can farm or\r\nlive upon the farm.’ It is ‘the last ounce that breaks the camel’s\r\nback,’ and men who might have made a manful struggle against blighted\r\ncrops and low prices, are overborne by a burden which they feel to be\r\nneedlessly inflicted and of which they dare not openly complain.\r\n\r\n“In consequence of the distress among the small farmers many of the\r\nlabourers would have been thrown out of employment had work not been\r\nfound for them by the marquis in stubbing and clearing woodland, which\r\nwill thus be reclaimed for cultivation. The improvement is expected\r\nto be amply remunerative in the end, and it is one of the unlooked-for\r\nresults of free trade, which are to be met with in every part of the\r\ncountry, that a landlord is compelled by circumstances, various in\r\nkind, to improve the neglected portions of his estate, and which,\r\nwithout such impelling cause, might have long lain unproductive. Every\r\nsuch improvement is not merely an addition to the arable land of the\r\nkingdom, but it becomes also an increased source of employment to the\r\nlabourer.”\r\n\r\nI witnessed immense injury done to turnip crops by shooting over them\r\nin Scotland. I was once visiting a farmer there, when for a whole half\r\nday a “_gentleman_,” with three dogs, was trampling down his Swedes,\r\nnot once going out of the field. He was a stranger, and the farmer said\r\nit would do no good to remonstrate; he would only be laughed at and\r\ninsulted.\r\n\r\nWe passed near a rookery, and the keeper was good enough to shoot\r\none of the rooks for us to look at. It was a shorter-winged and\r\nrather heavier bird than our crow, with also a larger head and a\r\npeculiar thick bill. At a distance the difference would not be readily\r\ndistinguished. The _caw_ was on a lower note, and more of a parrot\r\ntone, much like the guttural croak of a fledgling crow. The keeper did\r\nnot confirm the farmer’s statement of their quality for the table. When\r\nthey were fat they made a tolerable pie only, he said, not as good\r\nas pigeons. The rookery was, as we have often seen it described, a\r\ncollection of crows’-like nests among the tops of some large trees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A PICTURESQUE VILLAGE._]\r\n\r\nWe turned off from the river a little ways to look at Eccleston, a kind\r\nof pet village of the marquis, on the border of the park, and about the\r\nprettiest we saw in England, though rather too evidently kept up for\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nThe cottages were nearly all of the timber and _noggin_ walls I have\r\ndescribed as common at Chester, covered with thick thatched roofs,\r\nwith frequent and different-sized dormers, often with bow-windows,\r\nporches, well-houses, &c., of unpainted oak or of rustic work (boughs\r\nof trees with the bark on), broad latticed windows opening on hinges,\r\na profusion of creeping vines on trellises, and often covering all the\r\nwalls and hanging down over the windows, little flower gardens full of\r\nroses, and wallflowers, and violets, and mignonette, enclosed in front\r\nby a closely-trimmed hedge of yew, holly, or hawthorn, sometimes of\r\nboth the latter together, and a nicely-sloped bank of turf between it\r\nand the road.\r\n\r\nA cut from a sketch I made of one of the largest houses will be found\r\non page 207. An intelligent labouring man talked with me while I was\r\ndrawing it, and said it was the residence of the schoolmaster, and the\r\nvillage school was kept in it. The main part (which was covered with\r\nour American ivy) was over three hundred years old; a part of the wing\r\nwas modern.\r\n\r\nThis labourer had been digging drains in the vicinity. He said the\r\npractice was to make them from 18 to 36 inches deep, and from 5 to 7\r\nyards apart, or “in the old _buts_”—“The _buts_?” “Ay, the buts.” He\r\nmeant what we sometimes call the “_’bouts_” (turnabouts?) or furrows\r\nbetween the _lands_ in ploughing, which here are often kept unaltered\r\nfor generations for surface drainage, and, oddly enough, considering\r\nthe many manifest inconveniences of retaining them, as we were often\r\ntold, on account of the convenience of measuring or dividing fields by\r\nthem (as our farmers are often guided in their sowing by the _lands_,\r\nand estimate areas by counting the panels of fence). Pipe-tiles, such\r\nas are being now introduced with us, an inch or an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter (without collars), were laid in the drains to conduct the\r\nwater. The usual crop of potatoes in the vicinity he thought about\r\nthree _measures_ to a rood, or 225 bushels to an acre; of wheat, 30\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHILDREN AT PLAY._]\r\n\r\nWe went into a stylish inn to get some refreshment, and while waiting\r\nfor it, watched some little girls playing in the street. They stood,\r\nfour, holding hands, dancing and singing round one (“Dobbin”) lying on\r\nthe ground:\r\n\r\n    Old Dobbin is dead,\r\n      Ay, ay;\r\n    Dobbin is dead,\r\n    He’s laid in his bed,\r\n      Ay, ay.\r\n\r\n    There let him lie,\r\n      Ay, ay;\r\n    Keep watch for his eye,\r\n    For if he gets up\r\n    He’ll eat us all UP—\r\n\r\nand away they scampered and Dobbin after them. The one he first catches\r\nlays down again for “Dobbin,” when it is repeated. (Shown in the cut\r\npage 207.)\r\n\r\nThe church was a little one side of the village on an elevation, and\r\nso hidden by trees that we could only see a square tower and vane.\r\nNear it, we passed a neat stone building, which I thought probably the\r\nparsonage, and pointing towards it soon after, asked a man if he knew\r\nwho lived in it. His reply was, “Why, there’s none but poor peoples’\r\nhouses there, sir!” The vicarage he showed us in another direction—a\r\nfine house in spacious grounds.\r\n\r\nFrom Eccleston we had a delightful walk in the evening to Chester.\r\nThere is a good foot-path for miles along the river bank, with gates or\r\nstiles at all the fences that run down to it, and we met great numbers\r\nof persons, who generally seemed walking for pleasure. There were\r\npleasure-boats, too, with parties of ladies under awnings, rowing up\r\nand down the river, sometimes with music.\r\n\r\nWe were stopped by some labouring people going home, who asked us to\r\nlook after a poor woman we should see sitting by the water side over\r\nthe next stile, who, they feared, had been unfortunate, and was going\r\nto drown herself. She had been there for an hour, and they had been for\r\nsome time trying to prevail on her to get up and go home, but she would\r\nnot reply to them. We found her as they had said—a very tall, thin\r\nwoman, without hat or cap on her head, sitting under the bank behind\r\nsome bushes, a little bundle in a handkerchief on her knees, her head\r\nthrown forward, resting upon it, her hands clasped over her forehead,\r\nand looking moodily into the dark stream. We drew back and sat on the\r\nstile, where we could see if she stepped into the water. In a few\r\nminutes she arose, and avoiding to turn her face towards us, walked\r\nrapidly towards the town. We followed her until she was lost in a crowd\r\nnear the gate.\r\n\r\nWe found the streets within the walls all flaring with gas-light, and\r\ncrowded with hawkers and hucksters with donkey-carts, soldiers, and\r\npolicemen, and labouring men and women making purchases with their\r\nweek’s earnings, which it is a universal custom in England to have\r\npaid on Saturday night. We heard a ballad-monger singing with a long,\r\ndrawling, nasal tone, on a high key, and listened for awhile to see\r\nwhat he had. One after another he would hold them up by a gas-light,\r\nand sing them. The greater number were protection songs, with “free\r\ntrade” and “ruin” oft repeated, and were the worst kind of doggerel.\r\nOne (sung to “Oh, Susannah!”) I recollect as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Oh, poor farmers,\r\n      Don’t wait and cry in vain,\r\n    But be off to Californy,\r\n      If you cannot drive the _wain_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MENDICANTS._]\r\n\r\nHe read also choice scraps from confessions of murderers; parts of the\r\nprayer-book travestied so as to tell against free-trade; and other such\r\nliterature. In another place we found a crowd about a man with a flute,\r\na woman with a hurdy-gurdy, and three little children singing what we\r\nguessed must be Welsh songs—regular wails. The youngest was a boy, not\r\nappearing to be over five years old, and was all but naked.\r\n\r\nIn front of our inn a man held in his arms a fine, well-dressed\r\nlittle boy, and cried in a high, loud, measured, monotonous drawl,\r\ncontinuously over and over—“His mother died in Carlisle we have\r\ntravelled twenty-seven miles to-day I have no money she left this boy\r\nyesterday he walked eighteen miles I have no supper he is five years\r\nold I have walked two hundred miles this is no deception I have seen\r\nbetter days friends his feet are macerated I am in search of work I am\r\nyoung and strong he cannot walk his mother died in Carlisle help me in\r\nmy lamentations I have but sixpence for myself and boy friends I am\r\ncompelled to beg I am young and strong his mother died in Carlisle I\r\nam in search of work his feet are lacerated”—and so on. We watched him\r\nfrom the rows perhaps two minutes, and saw seven persons drop coppers\r\ninto his hat: two little girls that a man was leading, a boy, a German\r\nlace-pedler, a woman with a basket of linen on her head, another woman,\r\nand a well-dressed gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening we sat round a bright coal fire, in what had\r\nbeen the great fireplace of the long back parlour. We are the only\r\ninmates of the inn except Mrs. Jones, the landlady, and her maid. About\r\neleven o’clock we were disturbed by some riotous men in the tap-room,\r\nwhich is the other side of the big chimney. Mrs. Jones seemed trying to\r\nprevail on them to leave the house, which they refused to do, singing\r\n“We won’t go home till morning.” Mrs. Jones is a little, quiet, meek,\r\nsoft-spoken woman, and we were apprehensive for her safety. I was\r\nabout to go to her assistance, when the maid entered and said, “If you\r\nplease, sir, my mistress would like to see you.” I went hastily round\r\ninto the tap-room, and found two stout, dirty, drunken men, swinging\r\npewter mugs, and trying to sing “There was a jolly collier.” Mrs. Jones\r\nstood between them. I pushed one of them aside, and asked her what she\r\nwished me to do—expecting that she would want me to try to put him into\r\nthe street. The men made such a noise that I could not hear her mild\r\nvoice in reply, which, she perceiving, turned again and said, in a tone\r\nthat at once quelled them, “Stop your noise, you brutes!”—and then to\r\nme, “will you please step into the kitchen, sir?” She only wished to\r\nknow what we would like to have for our breakfast and dinner, as the\r\nshops would close soon, and, to-morrow being Sunday, they would not be\r\nopen before noon. You talk about woman’s feebleness!\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when we were going out, she came to unlock the door\r\nof the passage or entry, and told us she was obliged by law to keep\r\nit locked till two o’clock. At two o’clock we found it open, and\r\nimmediately after saw a man drinking beer in the tap-room again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE INN._]\r\n\r\nThere is a continual and universal beer-drinking in Chester. Mrs. Jones\r\ntells us that the quality of the beer made here has long been a matter\r\nof town pride, though now there is very little brewed in families,\r\nevery one almost being supplied, at a great saving of trouble, from\r\nthe large breweries. She says there used to be a town law that whoever\r\nbrewed poor beer should be publicly ducked. Sunday night, young men\r\nwith their sweethearts and sisters, of very reputable appearance, and\r\nquiet, decent behaviour, came into our back-parlour, and sitting by\r\nthe round-table ordered and drank each their glass or two of beer,\r\nas in an American town they would take ice-cream. Now and then a few\r\nremarks would be made about the sermon and who had been at church, or\r\nabout those who had been, or were soon going to be, married, or other\r\ntown gossip; but for the most, they would sit and drink their beer in\r\nsilence, perhaps embarrassed by our presence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH IN CHESTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  CHARACTER OF THE WELSH.—THE CATHEDRAL: THE CLERGY, SERVICE, INTONING,\r\n    THE LUDICROUS AND THE SUBLIME.—A REVERIE.—A REVELATION.—THE\r\n    SERMON.—COMMUNIONS.—OTHER CHURCHES.—SUNDAY EVENING.—CHARACTER OF THE\r\n    TOWNSPEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _Sunday, June 2d._\r\n\r\nWe were awakened this morning by a sweet chiming of the cathedral bells.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mrs. Jones introduced us to a young female relative\r\nwho had come to visit her. She was intelligent and handsome, having a\r\nbeautifully clear though dark complexion, thick, dark hair, and large\r\nswimming eyes. This style of beauty seems common hereabouts, and is\r\nprobably the Welsh type.\r\n\r\nShe lived among the mountains near Snowdon, and told us the country\r\nthere was bleak and sterile; agriculture confined mostly to grazing,\r\nsmall patches only of potatoes and oats being cultivated. She spoke\r\nhighly of the character of the peasantry in many respects, but said\r\nthey had very strong prejudices, usually despising the English and\r\nrefusing to associate with them. Many of them could not speak English,\r\nand those who could would often affect not to understand if they\r\nwere addressed by an Englishman. Among themselves they were very\r\nneighbourly, clannish, honest, and generous, but strangers they would\r\nimpose upon most shamelessly. She had known very few to emigrate,\r\nand those that did usually went to Australia, she thought. In her\r\nneighbourhood they were mostly dissenters; Methodists, and Baptists,\r\nand with the exception of deceit to strangers, were of good moral\r\ncharacter, much better than the English labourers. They had, however,\r\nmany traditional superstitions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CATHEDRAL. OLD MASONRY._]\r\n\r\nWe attended service in the morning at the cathedral. Its outline upon\r\nthe ground is, with some irregularities, in the form of a cross. Its\r\ngreat breadths and lengths, the comparative lowness and depth of its\r\nwalls, strengthened by thick, rude buttresses, and its short square\r\nmassive tower, together with its general time-worn aspect, impressed\r\nme much as an expression of enduring, self-sustaining age. Like the\r\nstalwart trunk of a very old oak, stripped by the tempests of much\r\nof the burden of its over-luxuriant youth, its settled, compact,\r\nungarnished grandeur, was vastly more imposing than the feeble grace\r\nand pliant luxuriance of more succulent structures. The raggedness\r\nof outline, the wrinkles and furrows and scars upon the face of all\r\nthe old masonry, are very remarkable. The mortar has all fallen from\r\nthe outside, and the edges of the stones are worn off deeply, but\r\nirregularly, as they vary in texture or are differently exposed. The\r\neffect of rain and snow and frost, and mossy vegetation and coal smoke,\r\nfor six hundred years upon the surface, I know of no building in\r\nAmerica that would give you an idea of. The material of construction is\r\na brown stone, originally lighter than our Portland sandstone, but now\r\ndarker than I have ever seen that become. It has had various repairs\r\nat long intervals of time, and is consequently in various stages\r\nof approach to ruin—some small parts, not noticeable in a cursory\r\nview, being in complete and irreparable demolishment, and others but\r\nyesterday restored to their original lines and angles, with clean-cut,\r\nbright-coloured stone and mortar—bad blotches, but fortunately not\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nIt was once connected with an abbey, and other religious houses that\r\nstood near it, and by a long under-ground passage with the nunnery at\r\nthe other side of the town. Think of the poor girls walking with a\r\nwailing chant, through that mile of darkness, to assist in the morning\r\nservice at the cathedral.\r\n\r\nOur approach to it this morning was by a something less gloomy and\r\ntedious way. We were accidentally in an alley in the vicinity, when\r\nwe saw a gentleman in a white gown, and a square or university cap on\r\nhis head, with a lady on his arm, enter an old, arched, and groined\r\npassage. We followed him adventurously, not being sure that it was\r\nnot the entrance to his residence. After passing to the rear of the\r\nblock of buildings that fronted on the alley, we found ourselves in\r\na kind of gallery or covered promenade attached to the cathedral.\r\n(The cloisters.) From this we passed into the _nave_ (or long arm\r\nof the cross). Its length, its broad, flat stone floor, entirely\r\nfree from obstruction, except by a row of thick clustered columns\r\nnear the sides, and the great height and darkness of its oak-ceiled\r\nroof, produced a sensation entirely new to us, from architecture. Its\r\ndignity was increased by a general dimness, and by the breadth of the\r\nsoftened, coloured light, that flowed in one sheet through a very large\r\nstained-glass window at one end. In the end opposite this were wide\r\npiers that support the tower, and between the two central of these were\r\nthe gilded organ-pipes that we had seen in our nocturnal visit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A CLERICAL AND LAY PROCESSION_]\r\n\r\nUnder these was an arched door, on each side of which stood about\r\nthirty boys, from ten to fifteen years old, dressed in white robes;\r\nthe “singing boys” or “choristers.” Walking leisurely up and down the\r\notherwise vacant floor of the nave were “my Lord Bishop of Bath and\r\nWells” (I believe that is the title), the dean and canons, &c. A lot\r\nof ecclesiastical dignitaries, whose very titles were all strange to\r\nme; but altogether forming, what Mrs. Jones said we should see, “a very\r\npretty pack of priests.” The bishop was a thin man, with a mean face\r\nand crisp hair, brushed back from his forehead; dressed in a black\r\ngown with white lawn sleeves, and a cap on his head. The dean, a burly\r\nred-faced man, strikingly contrasting with the bishop, particularly\r\nwhen they laughed, in white gown with a sort of bag of scarlet silk,\r\nperhaps a degenerate cowl, tied around his neck, and dangling by\r\nstrings down his back. The others had something of the same sort, of\r\ndifferent colours. We were told afterwards, that these were university\r\nbadges, and that the colour was a mark of rank, not in university\r\nhonours, but in the scale of society—as nobleman or commoner—(a pretty\r\nthing to carry into the worship of the Father, is it not?) The others\r\nwere in black.\r\n\r\nWe walked about for a few minutes outside the columns, reading the\r\ninscriptions on the stones of the floor, which showed that they covered\r\nvaults for the dead, and looking at the tablets and monumental effigies\r\nthat were attached to the walls and columns. They were mostly of\r\nelaborate heraldic design, many with military insignia, and nearly all\r\nexcessively ugly, and entirely inappropriate to a place of religious\r\nmeditation and worship.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the great bell ceased tolling, and some men in black\r\nserge loose gowns, two bearing maces of steel with silver cups on the\r\nends, the rest carrying black rods, entered and saluted the bishop. A\r\nprocession then formed, headed by the boys, in double file, followed\r\nby the bishop, dean, subdean, canons major and minor, archdeacon,\r\nprebendaries, &c., and closed by three Yankees in plain clothes; passed\r\nbetween the vergers, who bowed reverently and presented arms, through\r\nthe door under the organ into the _choir_—a part of the edifice (in\r\nthe centre of the cross) which is fitted up inconveniently for public\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nIt is a small, narrow apartment, having galleries, the occupants of\r\nwhich are hidden behind a beautiful open-work carved wood screen, and\r\nfurnished below with three or four tiers of pews (_slips_), and a few\r\nbenches. Under the organ loft were elevated armed seats, which were\r\noccupied indiscriminately by the unofficiating clergy and military\r\nofficers in uniform: the governor of the castle; Lord Grosvenor (as\r\n“colonel of the militia,”) Lord de Tapley, and others. Stationing\r\nsoldiers among the canons, it struck us, was well enough for a joke,\r\nbut as part of a display of worshipping the God of peace, very\r\nobjectionable. It is one of those incongruities that a state church\r\nmust be constantly subject to.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] I remember when I was a child, seeing on the Sunday preceding\r\nthe first Monday in May—the annual _training day_—in one of the most\r\nold-fashioned villages in Connecticut, the officers of the militia come\r\ninto the meeting-house in their uniforms. The leader of the choir was\r\na corporal, and the red stripes on his pantaloons, the red facings and\r\nbell-buttons of his coat, as he stood up alone, and pitched the psalm\r\ntunes, was impressed irretrievably on my mind.\r\n\r\nHalf way between these elevated seats and the chancel was the reading\r\ndesk and pulpit, and on each side of this the choristers were seated.\r\nSeveral persons rose to offer us their seats as we approached them, and\r\nwhen we were seated, placed prayer-books before us. The pews were all\r\nfurnished with foot-stools, or hassocks, of straw rope made up like a\r\nstraw bee-hive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INTONING A DEVOUT EXPRESSION._]\r\n\r\nMuch of the service which in our churches is read, was sung, or, as\r\nthey say, _intoned_. Intoning is what in school-children is called\r\n“_sing-song_” reading, only the _worst kind_, or most exaggerated\r\nsing-songing. I had never heard it before in religious service, except\r\nin a mitigated way from some of the old-fashioned Quaker and Methodist\r\nfemale exhorters, and I was surprised to hear it among the higher\r\nclass of English clergy, and for a time perplexed to account for it.\r\nBut I at length remembered that nearly all men in reading Scripture,\r\nor in oral prayer, or in almost any public religious exercises, use\r\na very different tone and mode of utterance from that which is usual\r\nor natural with them, either in conversation or in ordinary reading.\r\nAnd this is more noticeable in persons of uncultivated minds; so it\r\nis probably an impulse to distinguish and disassociate religious\r\nexercises from the common duties of life, that induces it. The effect\r\nis, that the reading of the Bible, for instance, instead of being\r\na study of truth, or an excitement to devotion and duty, as the\r\nindividual may intend, becomes an _act of praise_ or prayer—the real,\r\nunconscious purpose of the reader, finding expression in his tone\r\nand manner. So we may often hear the most arrant nonsense in oral\r\nprayers; a stringing together of scriptural phrases and devout words\r\nin confusing and contradicting sentences, while the tone and gesture\r\nand the whole manner of the devotee show that he is most sincerely,\r\nfeelingly, enthusiastically in earnest supplication. What for? Not for\r\nthat which his words express, for they may express nonsense or utter\r\nblasphemy. It is simply an expression or manifestation by the _act_ of\r\nuttering words in a supplicating tone, of the sense of dependence on\r\na superior Being—of love, of gratitude, and of reverence. David did\r\nthe same thing by dancing and playing upon the harp. It is done now,\r\nas it seems to us, more solemnly, by the playing upon church organs.\r\nIt is done by monuments, as in the decorations of churches. It is done\r\nby the Catholics, in listening and responding to prayers in a language\r\nwhich they don’t pretend to understand, and in mechanically repeating\r\nothers, the number of them counted by beads, measuring the importance\r\nor intensity of their purpose. It is done by abstaining from meat on\r\nFriday, and by confession to one another, in the form prescribed by\r\ntheir church government. It is done by the Japanese, in twirling a\r\nteetotum; by the Chinese, in burning Joss-sticks; by the Fakirs, in\r\nstanding on one leg; by the Methodists, in groans and inarticulate\r\ncries; by the Shakers, in their dance; by the Baptists, in ice-water\r\nimmersions; by Churchmen, in kneeling; by Presbyterians, in standing;\r\nby New-Englanders, in eating a cold dinner and regularly going to\r\nmeeting on Sunday; by the English, in feasting, and the Germans, in\r\nsocial intercourse on that day as well as by more distinctly devout\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to me that the tone of the reader was meant to\r\nexpress—“Note ye that this reading is no common reading, but is the\r\nword derived from God, not now repeated for your instruction, plainly\r\nand with its true emphasis, but markedly otherwise, that we may show\r\nour faith in its sacred character, and through it acknowledge our God—I\r\nby repeating its words as men do not those of another book—you by your\r\npresence and reverent silence while I do so.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident, too, by the occasional difficulties and consequent\r\nembarrassment and confusion of our reader, causing blushing and\r\nstammering, that it was not with him a natural expression of this\r\npurpose as was the nasal tone of the Puritan, but a studied form, which\r\nhad originated in some person more musically constituted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE COMICALITIES OF THE CATHEDRAL._]\r\n\r\nWhether I was right with regard to the theory or not, there was no\r\ndoubt that practically such was the operation of much of the service.\r\nThe portion of the Old Testament read was one of those tedious\r\ngenealogical registers that nobody but an antiquary or a blood nobleman\r\nwould pretend to be interested in. The psalm, one of the most fearful\r\nof David’s songs of vengeance and imprecation, alternately sung by\r\nthe choristers and intoned by the reader, one often running into the\r\nother with most unpleasant discord. The same with the Litany. Even the\r\nprayers could with difficulty be understood, owing partly to echoes, in\r\nwhich all distinctness was lost.\r\n\r\nDespairing of being assisted by the words of the service, therefore, I\r\nendeavoured to “work up” in myself the solemnity and awe that seemed\r\ndue to the place and the occasion by appropriate reflections. Under\r\nthis vaulted ceiling, what holy thoughts, what heavenly aspirations\r\nhave been kindled—what true praise of noble resolution has, like\r\nunconscious incense, grateful to God, ascended from these seats. On\r\nthese venerable walls, for hundreds of years, have the eyes of good\r\nmen rested, as from their firm and untottering consistency they gained\r\nnew strength and courage to fight the good fight,—and again I raised\r\n_my_ eyes to catch communion with them. They fell upon a most infamous\r\ncountenance, like to the representations of Falstaff’s,—a man with one\r\neye closed and his tongue tucked out the side of his mouth,—his body\r\ntied up in a sack, his knees being brought up each side of his chin to\r\nmake a snugger bundle. I turned away from it immediately; but there was\r\nanother face in most doleful grimace, as if a man that had been buried\r\nalive had suddenly thrust his head out of his coffin, and was greatly\r\nperplexed and dismayed at his situation. Again I turned my eyes—they\r\nfell upon the face of a woman under the influence of an emetic—again\r\nupon a woman with the grin of drunkenness. Everywhere that any thing\r\nlike a _knob_ would be appropriate to the architecture were faces\r\nsculptured on the walls that would be a fortune in a comic almanac.\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes again, and tried to bring my mind to a reverent mood,\r\nbut the more I tried the more difficult I found it. My imagination was\r\ntaken possession of by the funny things, and refused to search out\r\nthe sublime. Not but that the sublime, the grand, and the awful were\r\nnot apparent also, all over and around—ay, and consciously within me;\r\nbut, like a stubborn child, my mind would resist force. I gave it up,\r\nenvying those who would have been so naturally elevated by all these\r\nincitements and aids to devotion.\r\n\r\nI could not understand a sentence of the service, but sat, and rose,\r\nand kneeled, thus only being able to join in the prayer, and praise,\r\nand communion of the congregation.\r\n\r\nSoon my thoughts, now wandering freely, fell to moving in those\r\ndirections of reverie that I have found they are apt to take when I\r\nam hearing what those who listen with critical ear shall call fine\r\nmusic: doubtless it is the best and truest that can effect this;\r\nthough when I listen attentively and try to appreciate it, my opinion\r\nwould only be laughed at by them. I had been wandering in a deep, sad\r\nday-dream, far away, beyond the ocean—beyond the earth ... dark—lost\r\nto remembrance—when I was of a sudden brought back and awakened again\r\nin the dim old cathedral with such emotion, as if from eternity and\r\ninfinity, I was remanded to mysterious identity and sense of time,\r\nthat I choked and throbbed; and then, as the richest, deepest melody I\r\nmust ever have heard passed away, softly swelling through the vaulted\r\nceiling, caught up tenderly by mild echoes in the nave, and again and\r\nagain faintly returning from its deepest distances, I kneeled and bowed\r\nmy head with the worshippers around me, acknowledging in all my heart\r\nthe beauty and sublimity of the place and the services.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] I try in vain to express a sensation, which I have many times in\r\nmy life experienced, and which, I presume, is common to other men, that\r\nforces on me a belief, strong at the time as knowledge, of immortality\r\nand eternity, both backward and forward, vastly stronger than all\r\narguments can effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SERMON ON MODERN PHARISEEISM._]\r\n\r\nThe sermon was from an elderly man, with a voice slightly broken,\r\nand an impressive manner, whom we were afterwards told was Canon\r\nSlade, a somewhat distinguished divine. It was one of the best, plain,\r\npractical, Christ-like discourses I ever heard from a pulpit. It was\r\ndelivered with emphasis and animation, in a natural, sometimes almost\r\nconversational tone, directly to _individuals_, high and low, then and\r\nthere present, and of course was listened to with respectful attention.\r\nThe main drift of it was to enforce the idea, that a knowledge of\r\nthe truth of God was never to be arrived at by mere learning and dry\r\nstudy; that these were sometimes rather encumbrances; that love was of\r\nmore value than learning. He had been describing the Pharisees of old,\r\nand concluded by saying, that the Pharisees, satisfied with their own\r\nnotions, and scorning new light, were not scarce in our day. “There are\r\nsome of them in our Church of England: would that there were fewer;\r\nthat there were less parade and more reality of heavenly knowledge.”\r\nHe made but little use of his notes, and pronounced an extemporaneous\r\nprayer at the conclusion with extreme solemnity.\r\n\r\nI remained in company with a large proportion of the women present,\r\nand half a dozen men, at the communion service. The Church of England\r\nservice, which has always seemed to me more effective than most others\r\nto the practical end of the ceremony, never was so solemn, impressive,\r\nand affecting. It was administered by the bishop, unassisted, with\r\ngreat feeling and simplicity. There was not the least unnecessary\r\nparade or affectation of sanctity; but a low, earnest voice, and a\r\nquiet, unprofessional manner that betokened a sense of the common\r\nbrotherhood of us all united by God in Christ. The singing was\r\n“congregational,” the choristers having left, and without assistance\r\nfrom the organ.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the congregation were servants in livery;\r\nand besides these and the soldiers and clergy, the men present were\r\ngenerally plainly, and many shabbily, dressed. The women, many of them,\r\nseemed of a higher class, but were also simply dressed, generally in\r\ndark calicoes.\r\n\r\nIn the south transept (or short arm of the cross) of the cathedral\r\nanother congregation were assembling as I came out. I followed in\r\na company of boys, marching like soldiers, dressed in long-skirted\r\nblue coats, long waistcoats, breeches, and stockings, and with the\r\nclerical _bands_ from their cravats. Within were several other such\r\ncompanies—boys and girls in uniform, from charity schools, I suppose.\r\nThe girls were dressed in the fashion of Goody-Two-Shoes, with\r\nhigh-backed white caps, and white “pinafores” over blue check gowns.\r\n\r\nThis transept is a large place of worship in itself, though but a small\r\npart of the cathedral, and is occupied by the parish of St. Oswald,\r\nmorning and evening service being held in it immediately after that of\r\nthe cathedral church. On the doors were notices, posted in placards,\r\naddressed to persons in certain circumstances, among others, to all who\r\nused hair-powder, to give notice to the appointed officers that they\r\nmight be rightfully taxed.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we visited a Sunday-school of the Unitarians, where\r\nwe saw about sixty well-behaved children,—the exercises, much the same\r\nas in ours. Afterwards we heard a sensible sermon, on faith and works,\r\nin the Independent chapel. The clergyman, who has been a missionary in\r\nthe East, and has also travelled in America, was good enough to call on\r\nus and invite us to his house the next day. The congregation seemed to\r\nbe of a higher grade than _most_ of that we had seen at the cathedral,\r\nmore intelligent and animated, and more carefully dressed, yet very\r\nmuch plainer, more modestly and becomingly, and far less expensively\r\nthan you could often see any congregation with us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUNDAY EVENING RECREATION._]\r\n\r\nWe had a delightful walk, later in the afternoon, on the walls, where\r\nwe met a very large number of apparently very happy people. I never\r\nsaw so many neat, quiet, ungenteel, happy, and healthy-looking women,\r\nall in plain clean dresses, and conversing in mild, pleasant tones;\r\nsquads of children, too, all dressed ridiculously, bright and clean\r\nand stiff, not a dirty one among them, and as well behaved as dolls,\r\nmost comically sober and stately. The walls form a good promenade,\r\nelevated and dry. The landscape view across the river, in the sunset\r\nhaze, seemed in communion with the minds of the people, tranquil and\r\nloving. An hour later, and we found the streets lighted up and almost\r\nas crowded as on Saturday night, yet very quiet, and no impudence,\r\nblackguardism, or indecency shown us. On the whole, spite of the\r\nuniversal beer-drinking, we received a high opinion of the character of\r\nChester people, quite as high, as respects morality and courtesy, as a\r\nstranger passing a Sunday in a New England town of the same size would\r\nbe likely to obtain of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n      CLANDESTINE ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES.—A VISIT TO THE MARQUIS OF\r\n                  WESTMINSTER’S STUD.—STABLE MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _Monday, June 3d._\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we visited the old church of St. John’s, and\r\nafterwards several curious places, relics of Romans, Saxons, and\r\nNormans, in the suburbs—after all, nothing so interesting to me as\r\nthe commonest relics of Englishmen but two or three centuries old. As\r\nwe returned through the town at seven, the early risers seemed to be\r\njust getting up. Passing the cathedral as the bell tolled for morning\r\nprayer, we turned in. There are services every day at 7, 11, and 3\r\no’clock. The service was performed in the Lady Chapel, which we did not\r\nenter. The attendance must have been rather meagre, as we saw no one\r\ngoing to it but two ladies with an old man-servant. We remained some\r\ntime hunting on tip-toe for traces of the _Norman transition_ in the\r\narchitecture, and found we had had already practice enough to readily\r\ndetect it in various parts. Stealing softly into the choir, from which\r\nthe Lady Chapel opens, we examined the bishop’s throne. It is adorned\r\nwith many figures of saints and angels, kings and queens, and having\r\nbeen once broken to pieces, in the repairs upon it the old heads were\r\ngenerally put on young shoulders, and _vice versa_, producing in\r\nsome instances a very ludicrous effect, particularly where the men’s\r\nheads, beards and all, are set on female bodies. We then got out into\r\nthe _cloisters_, and from them into the chapter-house, in which the\r\nheavy-groined arches, simple, and without the slightest ornament, have\r\na grand effect. The date is about 1190. We saw here some very strongly\r\n_marked_ faces which in stone represent certain Norman abbots whose\r\ngraves were under us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ELECTION ROWS.—AMERICAN BOOKS._]\r\n\r\nWithout the cathedral yard, the ruins of the old abbey appear\r\nfrequently among the houses, the old black oak timber and brick work\r\nof the time of Cromwell, mingling picturesquely with the water-worn\r\ncarvings of the older, old masonry. This morning we saw a stout, round,\r\nold Saxon arch giving protection to a fire-engine, which brought to\r\nmind the improbability of the present race of New-Yorkers sending\r\ndown to posterity such memorials of itself. Well, it will send better\r\nperhaps, and more lasting than in stones—or stocks.\r\n\r\nOn the town-hall is a large statue, said to be of Queen Anne, but so\r\nbattered and chipped, that it might stand for any body else, in a\r\nlong dress. The hands and nose, and all the regalia are knocked off.\r\nAnd how, do you suppose? By the _super_-sovereign people in election\r\ndemonstrations. Thank God, we may yet boast, that in our thoroughly\r\ndemocratic elections, where the whole national policy is turning, and\r\nthe most important private and local interests are at issue, we leave\r\nno such memorials of our time. (I beg pardon of the “bloody Sixth.”)\r\n\r\nGoing into a book-shop for a direction, we saw Emerson’s\r\n“Representative Men,” and Irving’s “Sketch-Book,” on the counter, with\r\nnewspapers and railway guides, and the proprietor told us he had sold a\r\ngreat many of them.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a crockery shop to see a Roman bath, which had been\r\ndiscovered in excavating a cellar in the rear of it. Such things are\r\nbeing every year brought to light.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we once more took our knapsacks, and left Chester by\r\nthe foot-path on the bank of the Dee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ETON STUD._]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Westminster owns some of the finest horses in the\r\nkingdom; in passing through Eccleston, we asked a man if he could\r\ndirect us where we could see some of them. He informed us that he was\r\nhead groom of the stud to the marquis, and he would take pleasure in\r\nshowing it to us. He took us first to _the paddocks_, which are fields\r\nof from two to five acres, enclosed by stone walls, ten feet high, some\r\nof them with sheds and stables attached, and some without. In these\r\nwere thirty or forty of the highest bred, and most valuable mares and\r\nfillies in the world. Unfortunately I am not a horse-_man_, and cannot\r\nattempt to describe them particularly. It needed but a glance, however,\r\nto show us that they were almost any of them far the most beautiful\r\nanimals we had ever seen. The groom, whose name is Nutting, and whose\r\nacquaintance I recommend every traveller this way to endeavour to\r\nmake, was exceedingly obliging, not only taking us into every paddock\r\nand stable, and giving us an account of the pedigree, history, and\r\nperformances of every horse, but calling our attention to the _points_,\r\nall the peculiarities of form which distinguished each individual. It\r\nwas evident his heart was in his business, and that his regard was\r\nappreciated, for as soon as he unlocked the gate, and showed himself\r\nwithin the enclosure, some of the older mares would trot up to be\r\ncaressed with the most animated, intelligent, and gratified expression.\r\nThe most celebrated among them was _Bee’s-wing_. She is seventeen years\r\nold, and very large, but most perfect in form; I should think better\r\nthan her daughter, _Queen-Bee_, who is lighter and more delicate. The\r\nextraordinary beauty of “Ghuznee” and “Crucifix,” both distinguished\r\non the turf, was also obvious. These, I think, do not belong to the\r\nmarquis. In one of the paddocks were a number of foals, pretty, agile,\r\nfawn-like creatures. They came around us dancing and capering, catching\r\nour knapsacks with their teeth, then springing off, and coming back\r\nagain, like dogs at play. The mares, fillies, and colts were all of\r\ndark bay colour, but one, which was dark iron-grey, nearly black.\r\n\r\nJust as we left the colts, a great cart-horse, belonging to the\r\nmarquis, was passing on the road. The contrast was wonderful. He was\r\n_seventeen hands and one inch_ high (within a trifle, six feet), and\r\nputting both my thumbs to the smallest part of his leg, I could not\r\nmake my fingers meet around it.\r\n\r\nFrom the paddocks we went to the stables to see the stallions.\r\nThey were all loose boxes (no stalls), thirteen feet by sixteen,\r\nsome with rack and manger across the side, some with the same in a\r\ncorner. Touchstone is a magnificent creature, beyond conception. It\r\nis impossible to imagine such high _condition_, indicated not less\r\nin the happy and spirited expression and action, than in the bright,\r\nsmooth, supple, and elastic _feel_ of his skin. I never saw any thing\r\nto equal it in America; and it was nearly as remarkable in the mares.\r\nFive thousand guineas (over $25,000) have been offered and refused\r\nfor Touchstone.[16] _Springy-Jack_ is a younger stallion; by Nutting\r\nesteemed even higher than Touchstone. Nothing in the world of animal\r\nlife can be finer than the muscular development of his neck. Touchstone\r\nis a little coarse in the withers. They were intending to put him in\r\npasture the next week, and in preparation for it, he had some fresh\r\ngrass mixed with hay to eat. He stood in a deep bed of straw, and was\r\nnot curried—groomed merely with a cloth, yet he was so clean, that it\r\nwould not have soiled a white linen handkerchief to have been rubbed\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n[16] Mares are sent here from all parts of the kingdom, to be served by\r\n_Touchstone_, perhaps the most esteemed stock-getter in England. He is\r\nallowed forty in a year, and the charge is $160 to $200, and $2.25 a\r\nweek for pasture.\r\n\r\nIn the granary we saw some very plump and bright Scotch oats. They\r\nwere bought for 42 lbs. to the bushel, but would overweigh that. The\r\ncommon feed was oat and bean meal mixed with cut hay. The hay was cut\r\nvery fine (not more than ⅛ inch lengths) by a hand machine. I believe,\r\ncut as it usually is by our machines (½ inch to 1 inch), it is more\r\nthoroughly digested. I use Sinclair’s, of Baltimore, which is intended\r\nfor corn-stalks, driven by horse-power, and cuts hay and straw from one\r\nto three inches, which I prefer to the finer.[17] The machine here cost\r\n£6 ($30), and was in no way superior, that I could see, to Ruggles’, of\r\nBoston, which is sold at half that price.\r\n\r\n[17] I do not wish to recommend this machine for hay and straw, which\r\nit does not cut as rapidly as some others, but for stalks it cannot be\r\nsurpassed—cutting and _splitting_ them in small dice.\r\n\r\nThe farm buildings were not fine or in good order, manure wasting, old\r\ncarts and broken implements thrown carelessly about, and nothing neat.\r\nNor were the cattle remarkable—most of them below the average that we\r\nhave seen on the road-side. It is evident the marquis is more of a\r\nhorse-jockey than a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe groom’s house, which we entered, was very neat and handsomely built\r\nof stone. All the cottages hereabout are floored with tiles, nine\r\ninches square. They vary in colour, but are most commonly light brown.\r\n\r\nNutting showed us a cow of his own, which I took to be a direct cross\r\nof Devon and Ayrshire, and which had as fine points for a milker as I\r\never saw in any thing. She was very large, red and white, and a good\r\nfeeler. He assured us she was giving now on pasture feed thirty-two\r\nquarts a day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DUTCH BARNS.—A POLITE GROOM._]\r\n\r\nThe hay was partly stored under slate roofs, supported by four\r\nstrong stone columns, the sides open. This plan differs from the hay\r\n_barracks_, common where the Dutch settled in America, in which the\r\nroof, thatched or boarded, is attached to posts in such a way that it\r\ncan be easily set up or down, and adjusted to the quantity of hay under\r\nit. These erections are here called Dutch barns. Nutting thought hay\r\nwas preserved in them better than in any way he knew, and this has been\r\nmy opinion of that from our _barracks_. Close barns he particularly\r\nobjected to. Probably hay suffers more in them here than it does in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAfter showing us all about the farmery, he walked on with us to a shady\r\npasture by the river side, where was a herd of fine mares. We sat here\r\nunder an old elm for some time, looking at them as they clustered\r\naround us, and talking with him about the agriculture of the district.\r\nHe was so easily good-natured, and conversed so freely, asking as\r\nwell as answering questions, that we were greatly puzzled to tell\r\nwhether he expected a fee, or would be offended by our offering it. At\r\nlength, when he was about to leave, we frankly stated our difficulty,\r\nexplaining that we were foreigners, and not familiar with the English\r\ncustoms on such occasions. He answered pleasantly, that he was always\r\nglad of a chance to converse with gentlemen on such subjects as we\r\nappeared to be interested in; if they liked to give him something he\r\ndid not refuse it, but he did not wish any thing from us. We assured\r\nhim that we were much indebted to him, and begged that he would not\r\nmake an exception of us, handing him a half crown, which he dropped\r\ninto his pocket without looking at it or thanking us, but politely\r\nreplying that he considered himself fortunate in having met us. He then\r\nsaid he would walk on a little further to direct us on a path much\r\npleasanter than the regular travel, and from which we might see one\r\nof the best dairy farms in the country, with an excellent herd of one\r\nhundred and fifty cows. The path would run through the park, and was\r\nnot public, but if we would mention his name at the lodges they would\r\nlet us pass.\r\n\r\nWe soon came in sight of the cows. They were large, half-bred\r\nAyrshires, which seem to be the favourite dairy stock throughout the\r\ncountry. Pure-bred stock of any breed were not in favour, but the\r\nAyrshire blood was most valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  THE CHESHIRE CHEESE DISTRICT AND ENGLISH HUSBANDRY UPON HEAVY\r\n    SOILS.—PASTURES.—THEIR PERMANENCE.—THE USE OF BONES AS A MANURE IN\r\n    CHESHIRE.—A VALUABLE REMARK TO OWNERS OF IMPROVED NEAT STOCK.—BREEDS\r\n    OF DAIRY STOCK.—HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SOIL AND CLIMATE IN CHEESE-MAKING._]\r\n\r\nThe soil of a considerable part of this county being a tenacious clay,\r\nfavourable to the growth of grasses, and difficult of tillage, its\r\ninhabitants are naturally dairy-men, and it has been particularly\r\ndistinguished for many centuries for its manufacture of cheese. Its\r\ndistinction in this respect does not appear to be the result of\r\nremarkable skill or peculiar dairy processes, but is probably due to\r\nthe particular varieties of herbage, to the natural productions of\r\nwhich, the properties of its soil, and perhaps of its climate, are\r\npeculiarly favourable.[18]\r\n\r\n[18] The best cheese is made on cold, stiff, clay-soils (but not on the\r\npurest clays), and from the most _natural_ herbage, even from _weedy_,\r\nsterile pastures; but much the largest quantity is made from an equal\r\nextent of more moderately tenacious and drained or permeable soils\r\nspontaneously producing close, luxuriant, fine (not rank) grasses and\r\nwhite clover.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for this conclusion are the general value placed by the\r\nfarmers upon their old pastures, where the natural assortment of\r\nherbage may be considered to have entirely obtained and taken the place\r\nof the limited number of varieties which are artificially sowed, the\r\nfact that the butter of the district is not, as a general rule, highly\r\nesteemed, and that I cannot learn that the process of cheese-making\r\ndiffers any more from that of other districts in England or the United\r\nStates, than between different dairies producing cheese of equal value\r\nin this district itself.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means to be inferred, however, that the quality of cheese\r\nis not affected by the process of manufacture. There is no doubt that\r\nthe skill and nicety of a superior dairy-maid will produce cheese of\r\na superior quality on a farm of poor herbage, while an ignorant and\r\ncareless one will make only an inferior description, no matter what the\r\nnatural advantages may be. The best cheese made in the United States is\r\nquite equal to the best I have tasted here, but the average quality is\r\nby no means equal to the average quality of Cheshire cheese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CHEESE-MAKING PROCESS._]\r\n\r\nSuperiority in the manufacture seems not to depend, however, upon\r\nany describable peculiarities of the process, which differs in no\r\nessential particular from that common in our dairies. Excellence is\r\nwell understood to depend greatly upon extreme cleanliness in all the\r\nimplements employed, and upon the purity and moderate temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere. Means to secure the latter are used much the same\r\nas with us. Stoves and hot-water pipes are sometimes employed in\r\nthe cheese-room; and I may mention that where this is in a detached\r\nbuilding of one story, it is considered essential that it should have\r\na thatched roof. In some cases where the roof has been slated, it has\r\nbeen found necessary in the warmest weather to remove the cheese to the\r\ncellar of the farm-house. Plank shelves are more generally used, and\r\nare esteemed better than stone.\r\n\r\nNot only is there no uniformity in the methods of the different dairies\r\nto distinguish them from those of the United States, but rarely in\r\nany single dairy are there any exact rules with regard to the time to\r\nbe employed in any parts of the process, or as to the temperature or\r\nthe measure of any ingredients. Thus the degree of heat at setting the\r\nmilk, although the skill to _feel_ when it is right is deemed highly\r\nimportant, is almost never measured, even in the best dairies. The\r\nquantity of rennet is guessed at, and its strength not exactly known.\r\nThe quantity of salt used is undefined, and the time for _sweating_ or\r\ncuring of the cheese, when made, is left to be accidental.\r\n\r\nWith regard to some of these points, however, it has been found (as\r\nreported to the Royal Agricultural Society) that in some of the best\r\ndairies the milk, when judged to be of the right temperature for\r\ncoagulating, was by the thermometer at 82° F. (variations from 76° to\r\n88°). From four to sixteen square inches of rennet skin in a pint of\r\nwater (generally four square inches) were used to make the cheese from\r\nfifty gallons of milk, and 1 lb. to 1 lb. 4 ounces salt to the same\r\nquantity. It is thought that the best cheese is made with less salt\r\nthan this. The heat of the milk-room was found to vary from 64° to 78°\r\nin August, and it was thought desirable that it should be cooler than\r\nthis. The reporter thought that a temperature of 50° would be most\r\napproved throughout the year. I never saw or heard of ice being used in\r\nany way in a Cheshire dairy.\r\n\r\nSome of the best dairy-maids claim to have _secrets_ by which they are\r\nenabled to surpass others, but it is certain that they do not lessen\r\nthe necessity for extreme cleanliness, nicety, and close observation\r\nand judgment, and that with this, in addition to what is everywhere\r\nknown and practised, there is no mystery necessary to produce the\r\nbest.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] “A cheese dairy is a manufactory—a workshop—and is, in truth, a\r\nplace of hard work. That studied _outward neatness_ which is to be\r\nseen in the show dairies of different districts may be in character\r\nwhere butter is the only object, but would be superfluous in a cheese\r\ndairy. If the room, the utensils, the dairy-woman and her assistants\r\nbe sufficiently _clean_ to give perfect sweetness to the produce,\r\nno matter for the _colour_ or the _arrangement_. The scouring-wisp\r\ngives an _outward fairness_, but is frequently an enemy to _real\r\ncleanliness_.”—MARSHALL’S VALE OF GLOUCESTER. Besides the means of\r\nsecuring this _inner_ cleanliness, sweetness, and purity, which must\r\nbe of the air too, as well as of the utensils, &c., it is probable\r\nthat the dairy-maids’ _secrets_ are in a knowledge of the best\r\n_temperature_, particularly of that at which the milk should be curdled.\r\n\r\nThe Cheshire cheese in market always has an unnaturally deep, yellow\r\ncolour, though of late less so than formerly. It is given by the\r\naddition of “colouring” to the milk immediately before the rennet steep\r\nis applied. This “colouring” is manufactured and sold at the shops for\r\nthe purpose. It is an imitation of annatto, formed chiefly of a small\r\nquantity of real annatto mixed with tumeric and soft soap. I think it\r\nis never used in sufficient quantity to affect the flavour at all, but\r\nI observe that the farmers and people in the country prefer cheese for\r\ntheir own use that is not coloured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MILKING.—PASTURES.—BONES._]\r\n\r\n_Whey Butter._ It is common in Cheshire to make butter from the whey.\r\nIt will probably surprise many to learn that there is any cream left in\r\nwhey; but _there_ undoubtedly is, and _it_ may be extracted by the same\r\nmeans as from milk. The only difference in the process is, that it is\r\n_set_ in large tubs, instead of small pans, and that the whey is drawn\r\noff by a faucet from the bottom after the cream has risen. If allowed\r\nto remain too long it will give a disagreeable flavour to the cream.\r\nOne hundred gallons of milk will give ninety of whey, which will give\r\nten or twelve gallons of cream, which will make three or four pounds\r\nof butter. So that besides the cheese, twenty to twenty-five pounds of\r\nbutter are made in a year from the milk of each cow, an item of some\r\nvalue in a large dairy. The butter is of second-rate quality, but not\r\nbad—worth perhaps three cents a pound less than milk butter.\r\n\r\nThe farms in the country over which we walked in Cheshire were\r\ngenerally small, less, I should think, than one hundred acres.\r\nFrequently the farmer’s family supplied all the labour upon\r\nthem,—himself and his sons in the field, and his wife and daughters in\r\nthe dairy,—except that in the harvest month one or two Irish reapers\r\nwould be employed. The cows, in the summer, are kept during the day\r\nin distant pastures, and always at night in a home lot. During the\r\ncheese-making season, which on these small farms is from the first of\r\nMay till November, they are driven home and fastened in _shippens_, or\r\nsheds, between five and six o’clock, morning and night, and then milked\r\nby the girls, sometimes assisted by the men. On a farm of one hundred\r\nacres, fifteen to twenty cows are kept, and three persons are about\r\nan hour in milking them. From twenty to thirty gallons of milk (say\r\nsix quarts from each cow) is expected to be obtained on an average,\r\nand about one pound of dried cheese from a gallon of milk. From two to\r\nfive cwt. (of 112 lbs.) of cheese may be made from the milk of each cow\r\nduring the year. Three cwt. is thought a fair return on the best farms.\r\nIn a moderately dry and temperate summer, more cheese is made than in\r\none which is very wet.\r\n\r\nThe pastures are generally looked upon as permanent, the night pastures\r\nare sometimes absolutely so, as it is supposed that they have not\r\ngenerally been broken up for many hundred years. During the last ten\r\nyears the pasture lands have been very greatly, and, as they tell me,\r\nalmost incredibly improved by the use of bone dust. It is applied in\r\nthe quantity of from twenty to forty cwt. on an acre as top-dressing,\r\nand I was told that pastures on which it had been applied at the rate\r\nof a ton to an acre, eight or nine years ago, had continued as good (or\r\nable on an average of the years to bear as many cows) as similar land\r\ntop-dressed with farm-yard dung every two years, probably at the rate\r\nof thirty cubic yards to an acre. There seems to be no doubt at all\r\nthat land to which _inch_ bones were applied ten years ago are yet much\r\nthe better for it. They are usually applied in April, and the ground\r\nis lightly pastured, or perhaps not at all until the following year.\r\nThe effect, the farmers say, is not merely to make the growth stronger,\r\nbut to make it sweeter; the cattle will even eat the weeds which before\r\nthey would not taste of. However, in poor land especially, it is\r\nfound to encourage the growth of the more valuable grasses more than\r\nthat of the weeds, so that the latter are crowded out, and a clean,\r\nthick, close turf is formed. If the ground has been drained, all these\r\nimprovements are much accelerated and increased. Upon newly _laid down_\r\nlands, however, the effect is not so great; it is especially on old\r\npastures (from which the extraction of the phosphates in the milk has\r\nbeen going on for ages sometimes, uninterruptedly) that the improvement\r\nis most magical. The productive value of such lands is very frequently\r\nknown to have been doubled by the first dressing of bones.\r\n\r\nBoth boiled and raw bones are used, and though there is a general\r\nbelief that the latter are more valuable, I do not hear of any\r\nexperience that has shown it; on the contrary, I am told of one field\r\nwhich was dressed on different sides equally with each sort, and now,\r\nseveral years after, no difference has been observed in their effect.\r\nA comparison must, of course, be made by measure, as boiled bones are\r\ngenerally bought wet, and overweigh equal bulks of raw about 25 per\r\ncent. Dry bone-dust weighs from 45 to 50 lbs. to a bushel.\r\n\r\nI have not heard of _super-phosphate of lime_, or bones dissolved in\r\nsulphuric acid, being used as a top-dressing for pastures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IMPROVED DAIRY STOCK._]\r\n\r\nI quote the following from the journal of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety, as a mark of deep significance to American farmers, beyond\r\nits proof of the value of bones:—“Before bones came into use in this\r\ncountry, the farmers made a point of selecting a _hardy_ and _inferior_\r\ndescription of stock for their clay lands, farmers finding that _large,\r\nwell-bred cows did not at all answer upon them_; but now they find”\r\n(_in improved pasture_) “that the best of stock find ample support, not\r\nonly to supply the cheese-tub freely, but also to _do justice to their\r\nlineage_, by retaining, if not improving, their size and symmetry, so\r\nthat the farmer has not only the advantage of making considerably more\r\ncheese, but also of making more money by his turn of stock.”\r\n\r\nI cannot now ascertain the amount of bones annually exported from the\r\nUnited States to England, but it must be very great, as I know one\r\nbone-miller, near New York, that has a standing order to ship all he\r\ncan furnish at a certain price, and who last year thus disposed of\r\n80,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n_Breeds of Dairy Stock._—I have already described most of the dairy\r\nstock that we have observed along the road. We have seen scarcely any\r\npure bred stock of any kind. Ayrshire blood seems to predominate and\r\nbe most in favour on the best farms. The points of the short-horns\r\nare also common, and in the south we saw some Herefords. The best\r\nmilkers seemed to be a mixed blood of Ayrshires and some other large\r\nand long-horned cattle with a smaller red and black breed, probably\r\nWelsh. I incline to think that experience has taught the dairy-men to\r\nprefer half or quarter bred stock to full bloods of any breed. For\r\nbeef-making it is otherwise. I have seen no working oxen. Horses are\r\nthe only beasts of draught on the farms; they vary greatly in quality,\r\nbut are generally stout, heavy, hardy, and very powerful. On a farm of\r\none hundred acres, three will be kept, sometimes four, and at about\r\nthat rate on the larger farms, with an additional saddle-horse or two\r\nfor his own use, if the farmer can afford it. Farmers generally raise\r\ntheir own cows, choosing heifer calves from their best milker for the\r\npurpose. Cattle are not commonly reared for sale here. Few sheep are\r\nraised, but many are brought lean from Wales and Ireland, and fatted\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  TILLAGE.—SIZE OF FARMS.—CONDITION OF\r\n    LABOURERS.—FENCES.—HEDGES.—SURFACE DRAINAGE.—UNDER DRAINAGE.—VALUABLE\r\n    IMPLEMENTS FOR STIFF SOILS, NOT USED IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GENERAL AGRICULTURAL CHARACTER._]\r\n\r\nI should think that more than three-quarters of the land we have seen\r\nwas in grass and pasture. I suppose that it would be more productive\r\nof human food, and support a much larger population, if it were\r\ncultivated; but the farmers being generally men of small means, barely\r\nmaking a living, are indisposed to take the trouble to break up and\r\ntill the tough sward and stiff soil from which, while it is in pasture,\r\nthey are always sure to realize a certain product of cheese without\r\nany severe labour. The cultivation is not, either, very thorough,\r\nbecause the strongest and most efficient implements and great brute\r\nforces are needed to effectually act upon such a soil. Accordingly\r\nwe have observed on the large farms, where the extent of ground to\r\nbe, of necessity, cultivated, warranted the purchase of clod-crushers\r\nand other strong and expensive implements, and made it necessary to\r\nemploy a considerable number of labourers, the proportion of land under\r\ntillage was more extensive, and much more thorough work was made with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that the condition of the labourers appeared to\r\nbe elevated with that of agriculture, by the leasing of the land\r\nin larger tracts, and to men of larger capital. It is true that the\r\ntendency is to increase the rate of wages and give employment to more\r\nhands, but it is also evident that by the engrossment of several small\r\nfarms in one large one, a number of persons must be reduced from\r\nthe comparatively independent position of small farmers to that of\r\nlabourers, and I cannot see that for this there is any compensating\r\nmoral advantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HEDGES.—THOROUGH DRAINAGE._]\r\n\r\nAnother evil of the small farms (not exclusively, however), is\r\nthe quantity of land injured or withdrawn from cultivation by the\r\nfences. These are almost universally hedges, and not only are they\r\nleft untrimmed and straggling, thereby shading and feeding upon the\r\nadjoining land, but a great many large trees have been allowed to\r\ngrow up in them, of course to the injury of any crops under their\r\nbranches. These are sometimes kept low, the limbs being trimmed off\r\nfor firewood (in which case they are called _pollards_), or are left\r\nto grow naturally. In the latter case, of course, they add exceedingly\r\nto the beauty of the landscape, and eventually become of value for\r\ntimber; but high as this is here, I cannot at all believe it will ever\r\ncompensate for the loss occasioned to the farm-crops. Where every five\r\nor ten acres is surrounded by a hedge and ditch, the damage done cannot\r\nbe slight. By way of improvement we have seen where lately some hedges\r\nhave been grubbed up, two old fields being thrown together. We have\r\nalso seen a few wire fences in use. These latter were very slightly set\r\nup, and could hardly be intended for permanence. We have also seen some\r\nfine, low, narrow hedges, taking up but little room, and casting but\r\nlittle shade. When a hedge is thus well made and kept, I am inclined to\r\nesteem it the most economical fence. The yearly expense of trimming it\r\nis but trifling (less than one cent a rod), and it is a perfect barrier\r\nto every thing larger than a sparrow. I should add that the farmers\r\nseem to set much value upon the shelter from cold winds which the\r\nhedges afford.\r\n\r\n_Drainage._—The need of thorough draining is nowhere so obvious as\r\nupon clay soils with stiff sub-soils. There will be but a few weeks\r\nin a year when such soils are not too wet and mortary, or too dry\r\nand bricky, to be ploughed or tilled in any way to advantage. In the\r\nspring, it is difficult to cart over them, and in the summer, if the\r\nheat is severe and long-continued, without copious rain, the crops upon\r\nthem actually dwindle and suffer more than upon the driest sandy loams.\r\nTo get rid of the surface water, the greater part of the cultivated\r\nland of Cheshire (and, I may add, of all the heavy land of England)\r\nwas, ages ago, ploughed into beds or “_butts_” (’bouts). These are\r\ncommonly from five to seven yards wide, with a rise, from the furrows\r\n(called the “reins”) to the crown, of three or four inches in a yard.\r\nThe course of the butts is with the slope of the ground; a cross butt\r\nand rein, or a wide, open ditch by the side of the hedge, at the foot\r\nof the field, conducting off the water which has collected from its\r\nwhole surface. When the land is broken up for tillage, and often even\r\nafter thorough under-drainage, these butts are still sacredly regarded\r\nand preserved.\r\n\r\nThorough under-draining, by which all the water is collected after\r\nfiltering through the soil to some depth, was introduced here as\r\nan agricultural improvement within the last eight years. The great\r\nprofit of the process upon the stiff soil was so manifest that it was\r\nvery soon generally followed. The landlords commonly furnished their\r\ntenants with tile for the purpose, and the latter very willingly\r\nwere at the expense of digging the drains and laying them. Wishing,\r\nhowever, to do their share of the improvement at the least cost, the\r\ntenants have been too often accustomed to make the drains in a very\r\ninefficient manner, being guided as to distance by the old reins, and\r\nlaying their tile under these, often less than eighteen inches from\r\nthe surface. The action of the drains was thus often imperfect. It is\r\nnow customary for the landlords, when they furnish tile, to stipulate\r\nthe depth at which they shall be laid. They sometimes also lay out\r\nthe courses and distances of the drains. The Marquis of Westminster\r\nemploys an engineer, who appoints foremen, and, to a certain extent,\r\nsuitably-trained labourers, to secure the drainage of his tenant-lands\r\nin the most lastingly economical and beneficial manner. Last winter he\r\nhad two hundred men so employed, in addition to the labour furnished by\r\nthe tenants themselves, and over one million tiles were laid by them.\r\nI heard nowhere any thing but gratification and satisfaction expressed\r\nwith the operation of the thorough-drains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IMPLEMENTS FOR STIFF SOILS._]\r\n\r\n_Implements._—After breaking up the sward of these heavy lands with\r\na deep, narrow, furrow-slicing plough, a most admirable instrument,\r\nquite commonly in use and everywhere spoken well of, for crushing and\r\npulverizing the soil in a much more effectual and rapid manner than the\r\nharrow, is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSKILL’S PATENT CLOD-CRUSHER ROLLER.]\r\n\r\n“This implement,” according to the inventor’s advertisement, “consists\r\nof twenty-three roller parts, with serrated and uneven surfaces, placed\r\nupon a round axle, six feet wide by two and a half feet in diameter.\r\nThe roller-parts act independent of each other upon the axle, thus\r\nproducing a self-cleaning movement. Of course the roller must only be\r\nused when the land is so dry as not to stick.\r\n\r\n“The following are the various uses to which this implement is applied:\r\n\r\n“1.—For rolling corn as soon as sown upon light lands; also upon strong\r\nlands, that are cloddy, before harrowing.\r\n\r\n“2.—For rolling wheats upon light lands in the spring, after frosts and\r\nwinds have left the plants bare.\r\n\r\n“3.—For stopping the ravages of the wire-worm and grub.\r\n\r\n“4.—For crushing clods after turnip crops, to sow barley.\r\n\r\n“5.—For rolling barley, oats, &c., when the plants are three inches out\r\nof the ground, before sowing clover, &c.\r\n\r\n“6.—For rolling turnips in the rough leaf before hoeing, where the\r\nplants are attacked by wire-worm.\r\n\r\n“7.—For rolling grass lands and mossy lands after compost.\r\n\r\n“8.—For rolling between the rows of potatoes, when the plants are\r\nseveral inches out of the ground.\r\n\r\n“Cash prices, with travelling wheels complete, 6 feet 6 inches, £21; 6\r\nfeet, £19 10_s._; 5 feet 6 inches, £18.”\r\n\r\nFor still more deeply stirring, and for bringing weeds to the surface\r\nof soil recently ploughed, a great variety of instruments entirely\r\nunknown in America are in common use here. They all consist of sets of\r\ntines, or teeth, placed between a pair of wheels, and so attached to\r\nthem that, by means of a lever, having the axletree of the wheels for\r\na fulcrum, the depth to which they shall penetrate is regulated, and\r\nthey may at any time be raised entirely above the surface, dropping\r\nand relieving themselves from the weeds and roots which they have\r\ncollected. Thus they may be described as combining the action of the\r\nharrow, the cultivator, and the horse-rake. (The wire-tooth horse-rake\r\nis used as an instrument of tillage by Judge Van Bergen, at Coxsackie,\r\nN. Y.) They are designated variously by different manufacturers, as\r\ngrubbers, scarifiers, extirpators, harrows, and cultivators. The “ULEY\r\nCULTIVATOR,” of which a cut is appended, is one of the simplest and\r\nmost efficient. In this the tines are raised by turning a crank, each\r\ncomplete turn of which raises or depresses them one inch. The depth\r\nto which they are penetrating at any time, is marked by a dial near\r\nthe handle of the crank. Something of the kind more effectual than any\r\nthing we yet have, is much needed to be introduced with us. Clean and\r\nthorough culture of stiff clay soils can hardly be performed without it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ULEY CULTIVATOR]\r\n\r\nI should remark of English agricultural implements in general, that\r\nthey seem to me very unnecessarily cumbrous and complicated.\r\n\r\nI have lately had in use on my farm, a plough furnished me by A. B.\r\nAllen & Co., of New York (“Ruggle’s Deep Tiller”), which, I think, has\r\nall the advantages of the best English ploughs, with much less weight,\r\nand which is sold at half their cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  THE GENERAL CONDITION OF AGRICULTURE.—ROTATION OF\r\n    CROPS.—PRODUCTIVENESS.—SEEDING DOWN TO GRASS.—COMPARISON OF ENGLISH\r\n    AND AMERICAN PRACTICE.—PRACTICAL REMARKS.—RYE-GRASS, CLOVER.—BIENNIAL\r\n    GRASSES.—GUANO.—LIME.—THE CONDITION OF LABOURERS, WAGES,\r\n    ETC.—DAIRY-MAIDS.—ALLOWANCE OF BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLAND, A LANDSCAPE GARDEN._]\r\n\r\nI must say that, on the whole, the agriculture of Cheshire, as the\r\nfirst sample of that of England which is presented to me, is far below\r\nmy expectations. There are sufficient reasons to expect that we shall\r\nfind other parts much superior to it; but what we have seen quite\r\ndisposes of the common picture which our railroad and stage-coach\r\ntravellers are in the habit of giving to our imagination, by saying\r\nthat “all England is like a garden.” Meaning only a “landscape\r\ngarden,” a beautiful and harmonious combination of hill and dale, with\r\nthe richest masses of trees, and groups and lines of shrubbery, the\r\ngreenest turf and most picturesque buildings, it might be appropriately\r\nsaid of many parts, particularly in the south of the county. But, with\r\nreference to cultivation, and the productiveness of the land, it might\r\nbe quite as truly applied to some small districts of our own country as\r\nto this part of England.\r\n\r\nIn commencing the cultivation of land that has been in grass, the\r\nfirst crop is usually oats, and the most approved practice upon the\r\nstiff soils seems to be, to plough deeply in the fall or winter, and\r\nin the spring to prepare the ground with some strong implement of the\r\ncultivator sort. Oats are sowed much thicker than is usual with us. I\r\nhear of six bushels to the acre; but with regard to this there is much\r\ndifference of opinion. The crop of oats is not often large (from thirty\r\nto forty bushels from an acre is common); but oats seldom make a large\r\ncrop upon clay soils. The next year the ground will be summer-fallowed,\r\nor, by the more enterprising farmers, cropped with turnips, beets, or\r\nwith potatoes. The potatoes are sold, the turnips and beets fed to\r\nthe cows during the winter. On the poorer farms, the cows get little\r\nbut hay from December to April; and cheese-making is given up during\r\nthe winter. Others, by the help of turnips, beets, and linseed cake,\r\nkeep a constant flow of milk, and cheese-making is never interrupted.\r\n(Of course the milking of each cow is interrupted for a while at her\r\ncalving time, which they try to have in March.)\r\n\r\nThe crop after roots is commonly barley; after fallow, wheat, of which\r\ntwenty-five to thirty bushels is a common crop, and forty not uncommon.\r\nAfter wheat, oats again, and perhaps after the oats another crop of\r\nwheat; if so, the land is manured with bones or boughten manure, and\r\nsometimes limed at the rate, say of four tons to the acre of stone lime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _QUANTITY OF GRASS SEED TO AN ACRE._]\r\n\r\n_Grass._—With the last crop of oats or wheat, clover and grass\r\nseeds are sowed. Grass was thought to come better after wheat upon\r\nunder-drained land. The best farmers sow a very great variety and\r\nlarge measure of grass seeds; the poorer ones are often content with\r\nwhat they can find under their hay bays, sowing it, weeds and all,\r\npurchasing only clover seed.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of grass seeds sowed is always much greater here than in\r\nAmerica. I should think it was commonly from a bushel to three bushels\r\non an acre; rarely less than one, or more than three. I do not think\r\nmore than one quarter of a bushel, or perhaps half a bushel of the\r\nlighter seeds, is often sowed in the United States. I should attribute\r\nthe more general evenness and closeness of the English meadows in a\r\ngreat degree to this, though, doubtless, much is due to the moister\r\nclimate. Land intended for permanent pasture receives much more seed,\r\nand a larger variety, than that which is intended to be mown only for\r\na few years, and then be brought to tillage again. Of the good policy\r\nof the English practice for pastures (and the same applies to lawns\r\nand public greens) I have no doubt. Among the great variety of grasses\r\nin an English meadow, there will be one that springs up and grows\r\nstrongly, furnishing a wholesome and delicious bite to the cattle, as\r\nearly after the first warm breath of spring as the ground will be dry\r\nenough to bear a hoof (and on drained lands it is rarely not so). This\r\nwill be succeeded by others, and in May by others; and in July, those\r\nnatural to the driest and warmest soils will be in perfection; and so\r\nthrough the year there is a constantly renewing perfection. A ranker\r\nsward, and one that would for a season support more cattle, I think\r\nwould be obtained from sowing a smaller quantity and less variety of\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nI am not prepared to recommend the English practice for mowing lands.\r\nTo obtain the largest quantity of grass hay from an acre, without\r\nregard to quality, plough deep, manure deep, and sow one variety of\r\nseed in such quantity that when it comes up it will speedily _tiller_,\r\nand occupy the whole ground, yet not stand so closely as to greatly\r\ncrowd and compress the stools, thereby _dwarfing_ the reeds from their\r\nnatural size, and obstructing the flow of sap in their vessels. Cut it\r\nwhen it has attained to its greatest size, while it is yet entirely\r\nsucculent, just at the time that the _blood_ of the plant begins to be\r\ndrawn up into the forming seed, and the bottom dries into such tough,\r\nclose, ligneous fibre that nourishment can no longer ascend from\r\nthe root. The right quantity of seed for this will vary in different\r\nsoils—a very rich, deep soil needing less than a more sterile one,\r\nbecause in the latter the roots cannot extend far enough to collect the\r\nrequisite food and drink to make a large, strong, open stool, and more\r\nherbage will grow upon the same space by having the stools stand closer.\r\n\r\nIn some degree proportionately to the closeness of the fibre and the\r\nfineness of the grass, will be its nourishing quality, so that ninety\r\npounds of fine, close-grown hay, from a thick-seeded meadow, may be of\r\nequal value with a hundred pounds of a coarser, ranker quality. But the\r\nnourishment is by no means in the inverse ratio of size; so that for\r\nall ordinary purposes, with all the usual hay-grasses, the farmer will\r\nfind his profit in studying to obtain the largest burthen of grass. For\r\nthis end, I am inclined to think English farmers often sow too much\r\nseed, Americans not enough. It seems, however, to be the best farmers\r\nin other respects that sow the most seed in England.\r\n\r\nThere is one consideration that I have omitted to mention against the\r\ncommon practice on American farms, where hay is an important staple\r\ncrop: it is generally an object to retain a clean sward of grass as\r\nlong as possible, without the necessity of breaking up, from the grass\r\nhaving _run out_, that is, given place to weeds, or to finer and less\r\nprofitable grasses. Where the seed has been thickly sown, the grass\r\ntakes more entire possession of the surface, and retains it longer. The\r\nthicker grass seed is sown, therefore, other things being equal, the\r\nlonger it will _lay_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RYE-GRASS AND TIMOTHY._]\r\n\r\nI have known, in a district where it was the custom to sow four to\r\neight quarts of timothy seed, on two occasions, twenty quarts sowed.\r\nThe result was a finer grass in both cases; in one it was thought the\r\ncrop was much larger, and in the other that it was somewhat smaller,\r\nthan where ten quarts was sowed alongside. The probability is, that in\r\nan average of ten years it will prove the larger crop on the thickest\r\nsown, in both fields.\r\n\r\nThe commonest grass seed sowed in England, what may be called the\r\nstaple grass, is rye-grass, or ray-grass (perennial). It is a much\r\nsmaller, closer-growing grass than our timothy; I think it has\r\na sweeter taste, is probably, bulk for bulk, considerably more\r\nnutritious, and perhaps so pound for pound; but I think more fat and\r\nmuscle can be made from an acre, if sowed with timothy, than with\r\nrye-grass. A valuable quality of rye-grass is its early spring growth.\r\nA field of rye-grass will be up some inches, offering a tempting bite\r\nto cattle, before a field of other grasses will begin to show a green\r\nsurface. I believe that it ripens earlier, too, than timothy, and is\r\nbetter for mowing-ground on that account, to be sown with clover, which\r\nis much injured by over-ripeness, if not cut till timothy is in its\r\nbest state to make hay. I have seen no timothy in England, but I know\r\nit is sometimes sowed.\r\n\r\nRye-grass has stood at the head of the mowing grasses in some parts\r\nof England for centuries. In districts of light and dry soil, it is\r\nleast in favour than elsewhere, but I judge becomes of more value\r\nwith the improvement of husbandry generally. Marshall (1796), writing\r\nfrom Gloucestershire, speaks of the general strong prejudice of\r\nthe farmers against ray-grass, which he calls his favourite grass,\r\n“smothering every thing and impoverishing the soil, until it will grow\r\nnothing!” they say; and arguing against them, he makes an observation\r\nof value with reference to the question of quantity of seed. “If\r\n_real_ ray-grass has ever been tried alone, and without success, it\r\nhas probably risen from too great a quantity having been sown. Be it\r\nray-grass or rubbish, I understand seldom less than a sackful” (three\r\nheaped bushels) “an acre is thrown on, whereas _one gallon_ an acre of\r\n_clean-winnowed real ray-grass seed_ is abundantly sufficient on such\r\nsoil as the vale in general is covered with.” The soil is “a rich, deep\r\nloam.”\r\n\r\nClover (red and Dutch) is more sowed here for hay than with us, though\r\nit is much more difficult to make good hay of it in this climate. It\r\nis sowed in the spring, as with us, perhaps 20 lbs. to the acre. We\r\ncommonly sow 5 to 10 lbs. Arthur Young tried about a dozen experiments\r\nto ascertain the most profitable quantity of clover seed to sow, and\r\nconcluded his record of them as follows:\r\n\r\n“The more seed, as far as 20 lbs. per acre, undoubtedly the better.\r\nThis is a plain fact, contradicted by no part of the experiments; and\r\nthe great inferiority of 5 to 7 lbs. shows equally clear that such\r\nportion of seed is too small for an acre. Where land is well manured,\r\nless seed is required; 12½ lbs. seems the proper quantity” (on very\r\nrich, gravelly soil.)\r\n\r\nA bushel of clover seed weighs 60 to 64 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn ground intended for mowing but one or two years, biennial varieties\r\nof the rye-grass are sown, which are of stronger growth than the\r\nperennial. They are also sowed sometimes with permanent grasses,\r\ngiving, on a deep, rich soil, a heavier burthen of grass the first year\r\nof cutting than these would do. For this purpose, I have thought it\r\nmight be well to sow the biennial or sub-perennial rye-grass seed with\r\ntimothy, which does not usually yield a fair crop at its first cutting,\r\nand have twice attempted to make trial of the Italian rye-grass, but in\r\nboth cases the seeds that I had procured failed of germination.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion hereafter to notice several species of herbage\r\nthat are much valued in England, that have not been generally\r\nintroduced in the United States.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] Fifteen or twenty varieties of grass seeds are sowed together, and\r\nthe expense for seed in laying down for pasture is often ten or twelve\r\ndollars an acre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TOP-DRESSING.—GUANO.—WAGES._]\r\n\r\nThe grass is mowed for hay for a longer or shorter course of years;\r\nsometimes broken up after one or two seasons, sometimes becoming\r\npermanent or perennial pasture, and so running on indefinitely; and\r\nsometimes being mowed for a number of years. One field I saw that had\r\nbeen mowed eight years, and having received a dressing of 30 cwt.\r\nof bones, promised fair yet to bear heavy swaths. Mowing lands are\r\nusually top-dressed at the end of the second year, and afterwards every\r\nsecond or third year. All the homestead dung is commonly reserved for\r\nthis purpose, and all other manure is purchased from the towns. Guano\r\nfor turnips and wheat is coming into general use; some think very\r\nprofitably, others have been disappointed. For wheat, it is applied at\r\nthe seed sowing, and sometimes again as a top dressing in the spring;\r\nbut in a dry season it is thought that this second application has\r\ndone more harm than good. Guano has been a good deal tried as a top\r\ndressing for pastures, and it has been said to improve the quality of\r\ncheese when so used. The immediate effect upon grass, when applied\r\nin the spring, is always very advantageous; but later in the summer,\r\nparticularly if the season is dry, the good effect disappears, and\r\nsometimes the result is unfavourable.\r\n\r\nOf course the round of crop varies according to every farmer’s notion.\r\nWhat I have described is as common as any, though not probably among\r\nthe best farmers. Another crop is beans, which is introduced between\r\neither of those I have mentioned, sometimes at the head. Not uncommonly\r\nthe first crop is wheat, the ground having been summer fallowed. Wheat\r\nis drilled or sowed broad-cast; most commonly sowed in this county,\r\nand is either ploughed or harrowed in, opinions varying as to which\r\nis best. My own experience on a stiff soil is decidedly in favour of\r\nploughing in.\r\n\r\n_Labourers._—Wages, as they have been reported to me, vary much,\r\nand unaccountably. I should think the average for able-bodied men as\r\nday-labourers, working and receiving pay only in days that commence\r\nfair, was $2.25 a week, perhaps averaging thirty-three cents a day.\r\nThe rent of a labourer’s cottage, with a bit of garden attached (less\r\nthan a quarter of an acre), is from $15 to $25. In addition they have\r\nsometimes a few perquisites from the farmers who regularly employ them.\r\nA great many labourers in winter are without work, and wages are then a\r\ntrifle less than I have mentioned, as in harvest time they are also a\r\ntrifle more. The reader will understand that out of this thirty-three\r\ncents, which I have supposed to be the average receipts of a labourer\r\nper day, he has to pay his rent, and provide food and raiment for\r\nhis family. Of course his diet cannot be very sumptuous (the cost of\r\nprovisions being, perhaps, ten per cent. higher than with us), but I\r\nhave not learned particulars.\r\n\r\nThe wages of farm servants, hired by the month or year, and boarded in\r\nthe family, are for men, from $45 to $65 a year; for boys, $15 to $25;\r\nmaid-servants, $30 to $40; dairy-maids, greatly varying, say from $50\r\nto $100.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to give all labourers and servants a certain allowance\r\nof beer besides their wages. It is served out several times a day,\r\nand may be supposed to cost, on an average, ten cents a day for each\r\nperson. One farmer estimated it at twice that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n         REMARKS ON THE CULTIVATION OF BEET AND MANGEL-WURZEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXTENSIVE CULTIVATION OF THE BEET._]\r\n\r\nI found the best farmers in all the south of England, and throughout\r\nIreland, where the soils were at all stiff, increasing their crops\r\nof these roots. For the production of milk they are, undoubtedly, a\r\nmore valuable crop than turnips or ruta bagas, though it is asserted\r\nthat the milk is more thin and watery. Some thought them equal, and\r\neven superior, weight for weight, for fattening cattle. I think it is\r\ncertain that in such soils a larger amount of nutriment can be obtained\r\nfrom a crop of them on an equal measure of ground. Donaldson says the\r\nbeet yields a larger weight per acre, both in roots and leaves, than\r\nany other root crop known. I have heard of crops of from fifteen to\r\nthirty-five tons an acre; and in one instance, near New York, at the\r\nrate of forty-four tons an acre, from one quarter of an acre. Chemical\r\nanalyses and practical experiments in feeding, to ascertain their value\r\nas compared with other roots, or with hay, differ so very greatly,\r\nthat nothing can be said with any certainty about it. The climate of\r\nthe United States, like that of France, is much better adapted to the\r\nbeet, and much less favourable to the ruta baga, than that of England.\r\nThe beet is much less liable to be injured by insects or worms than the\r\nturnip or ruta baga, though I incline to think the latter is much more\r\nfavoured with us than in England in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe ground for beet crops is prepared the same as for turnips; that\r\nis, it is finely and deeply tilled (and there is no crop which will\r\nbetter show the value of draining and subsoil ploughing), and manured\r\nwith well-decomposed dung, compost, bones, or guano, in drills from\r\ntwenty-seven inches to three feet apart. The seed is usually prepared\r\nby steeping for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and is then\r\nrolled in lime. As rapidly as possible after the manure is deposited,\r\nit is covered with soil and the seed dropped, sometimes being drilled\r\nlike turnip seed, but more commonly dibbled. There are two simple\r\nmachines used here for dibbling. Whatever way the seed is planted, it\r\nmust be expected that a large part will fail to germinate.\r\n\r\nI have found dibbling by hand not very tedious, as follows: One man\r\nmaking holes an inch deep, and six or eight inches apart, with a round\r\nstick an inch in diameter, another following and dropping three seeds\r\nin a hole, and a third covering by a single stroke, and pressing, with\r\na hoe. I have obtained a large crop planting so late as the middle of\r\nJuly, in the climate of New York.\r\n\r\nA rapid early growth of the plant is important. When the weeds come up,\r\nthe horse-hoe or cultivator is run through, and as often afterwards as\r\nthere is need, while the size of the beets will permit it, they are\r\nhorse and hand hoed. It is found that earthing-up with a plough is\r\ninjurious. When two or three inches high, the plants are thinned to\r\ntwelve inches apart. When two or three plants come up in a bunch, one\r\nonly of them must be left. It will wilt down flat upon the ground at\r\nfirst, but soon recovers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A HINT TO AMATEUR FARMERS._]\r\n\r\nThe outer leaves begin to dry and decay early in the fall, and may\r\nthen be plucked and fed to cows with profit, and without retarding\r\nthe continued growth of the root. The root may be pulled by hand,\r\nand is harvested more readily than any other. It will keep (at New\r\nYork) in the open air, in stacks four feet wide and high, covered with\r\nstraw and six inches of earth, a small hole being left in the top for\r\nventilation, until April, and is then of great value to new milch-cows\r\nand ewes with lamb.\r\n\r\nI particularly recommend the cultivation of the sugar and mangel-wurzel\r\nbeets to cottage-farming gentlemen, who wish to keep a small dairy with\r\na limited extent of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  DELIGHTFUL WALK BY THE DEE BANKS, AND THROUGH EATON PARK.—WREXHAM.—A\r\n    FAIR.—MAIDS BY A FOUNTAIN.—THE CHURCH.—JACKDAWS.—THE TAP-ROOM AND\r\n    TAP-ROOM TALK.—POLITICAL DEADNESS OF THE LABOURING CLASS.—A METHODIST\r\n    BAGMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing Nutting’s directions, we had a most delightful walk along the\r\nriver bank and under some noble trees, then through thick woods and\r\nover a bit of low, rushy land, where some Irishmen were opening drains,\r\nand out at length into the private park-road; a pleasant avenue, which\r\nwe followed some miles. The park here was well stocked with game;\r\nrabbits were constantly leaping out before us, and we frequently\r\nstarted partridges and pheasants from a cover of laurels, holly, and\r\nhawthorn with which the road was lined.\r\n\r\nWe came out at Pulford, when we lunched at the Post Office Inn, and\r\nthence walked by an interesting road, through a village of model\r\ncottages not very pretty; over a long hill, from the top of which\r\na grand view back; and by a park that formerly belonged to Judge\r\nJeffreys, of infamous memory, to Wrexham.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WREXHAM JACKDAWS._]\r\n\r\nWrexham is a queer, dirty, higglety-piggelty kind of town, said to be\r\nthe largest in Wales (it is about as large as Northampton). It was\r\nthe latter part of a fair-day, and there had been a mustering of the\r\nyeomanry of the shire, so that the streets were crowded as we entered.\r\nIn the balcony of an hotel in the market-place a military band was\r\nplaying to a mass of up-turned, gaping faces, through which we worked\r\nour way. The inns were generally full of guzzling troopers, dressed in\r\na very ugly fashion, but we finally found one; some colour of the bear\r\nfamily, blue, I believe, which seemed tolerably quiet, where we stopped\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nAfter dining and resting awhile, we took a walk about the town. Most\r\nof the houses out of the market-place are very mean and low, the walls\r\nplastered with mud, and whitewashed, and the roofs thatched. Noticing\r\na kind of grotto in a back street about which a pretty group of girls,\r\nin short blue dresses, engaged in lively talk, were standing with\r\npitchers, we approached it. We came close upon them before they noticed\r\nus, but, instead of showing any timidity, they glanced at our hats and\r\nlaughed clear and heartily, looking us boldly in the face. Catching one\r\nalone, however, as we descended to the fountain, and asking her to let\r\nus take her mug to drink from, she handed it to us, blushing deeply,\r\nand said nothing, so we were glad to leave quickly to relieve her.\r\nThere was a spring and pool of remarkably clear, cool water, within\r\nthe grotto, from which all the neighbourhood seem to be supplied. Our\r\nCalifornia hats attracted more attention at Wrexham than anywhere else\r\nin Europe, but we met with no incivility or impertinence beyond a smile\r\nor laugh.\r\n\r\nThe church at Wrexham is curious, from the multitude of grotesque faces\r\nand figures carved upon it. It is a large and fine structure, and the\r\ntower is particularly beautiful, as seen from the village. There were\r\njackdaws’ nests in it, and a flock of these birds, the first we have\r\nseen, were hovering and screeching around them. They are of the crow\r\ntribe, black, and somewhat larger than a blue-jay.\r\n\r\nReturning to our inn we found in the parlour a couple of lisping\r\nclerks, who were sipping wine in a genteel way, and trying to say smart\r\nthings while they ogled the landlady’s daughter. Retreating from their\r\ntwaddle, I called for a pipe and mug of ale, and joined the circle in\r\nthe tap-room. There was a tall, scarlet-coated fellow who told me he\r\nwas a sergeant in the Queen’s guards recruiting here; an older man who\r\nhad been a soldier, and had served in Canada and China; a half-tipsy\r\nmiller with a pleasant-speaking, good-natured wife trying to coax him\r\nto come home, and half a dozen more countrymen, all muddling themselves\r\nwith beer and tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TAP-ROOM POLITICS._]\r\n\r\nThe conversation was running on politics, and was not at all\r\ninterrupted by my entrance; on the contrary, I thought the old soldier\r\nwas glad of a stranger to show himself off before. He was the orator\r\nof the night, and the others did little but express assent to his\r\nsentiments, except the miller, who every few moments interrupted\r\nhim with a plain and emphatic contradiction. The sergeant said very\r\nlittle either way except he was appealed to, to substantiate some\r\nassertion, “_as a military man_,” but leaned on the bar, drinking hot\r\ngin-and-water, and whispering with the bar-maid.\r\n\r\nThere was news that the French minister had taken diplomatic offence\r\nand demanded his passports, and war was threatened. War there certainly\r\nwould be, according to the ex-soldier, and a terrible time was coming\r\nwith it. England was going to be whipped-out most certainly—it was\r\ninevitable. Every body assented—it was “inevitable”—except the miller,\r\nwho said it was fol-de-rol. “Why,” continued the ex-soldier, “isn’t\r\nevery country in Europe against England?—don’t they all hate her? and\r\nisn’t every Frenchman a soldier?” Then he described the inefficient\r\nstate of the national defences, and showed how easy it would be for\r\na fleet of steamers, some dark night the next week, to land an army\r\nsomewhere on the coast of Wales, and before they heard of it, it might\r\nbe right there amongst them! He would like to know what there was\r\nto oppose them. The miller said there was—“gammon.” The sergeant, on\r\nbeing asked, admitted that he was not aware of any respectable force\r\nstationed in that vicinity, and the miller told him he was a “traitor\r\nthen.” Ex-soldier said miller knew nothing about war, any way, and\r\nthe company unanimously acquiesced. Ex-soldier then resumed his\r\nspeech—asked if government would dare to give arms to the people, and\r\npictured an immense army of Chartists arising in the night, and with\r\nfirebrands and Frenchmen, sweeping the government, queen and all, out\r\nof the land, and establishing a republican kingdom, where the poor man\r\nwas as good as the rich. The company all thought it very probable,\r\nand each added something to make the picture more vivid. A coarse\r\njoke about the queen’s bundling off with her children produced much\r\nlaughter; and the hope that the parsons and lawyers would have to go to\r\nwork for a living, was much applauded.\r\n\r\nIt was strange what a complete indifference they all seemed to have\r\nabout it, as if they would be mere spectators, _outsiders_, and not,\r\nin any way, personally interested. They spoke of the Government and\r\nthe Chartists, and the landlords and the farmers, but not a word of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening there was some most doleful singing, and a woman\r\ncame in and performed some sleight-of-hand tricks, every one giving\r\nher a penny when she had concluded. We were obliged to sleep two in a\r\nbed, one of us with a Methodist young man, who travelled to make sales\r\nof tea among country grocers and innkeepers, for a Liverpool house. He\r\nsaid that what we had seen in the tap-room would give us a very good\r\nnotion of the character of a large part of the labouring class about\r\nhere. He thought their moral condition most deplorable, and laid it\r\nmuch to the small quantity and bad quality of the spiritual food that\r\nwas provided for them. He seemed well informed about America, and,\r\nexcepting for slavery and steamboat explosions, greatly to admire our\r\ncountry. He had some idea of going to it, and said his present business\r\nwas exceedingly disagreeable, as it compelled him to be so much at\r\ninns, where he rarely found any one with whom he could pleasantly\r\nassociate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  MORNING WALK THROUGH A COAL DISTRICT.—RUABON.—AN OPTIMIST WITH\r\n    A WELSH WIFE.—GRAVEYARD NOTES.—A STAGE-WAGON.—TAXES.—WYNSTAY\r\n    PARK.—THOROUGH DRAINING.—A GLIMPSE OF COTTAGE LIFE.—“SIR WATKINS\r\n    WILLIAMS WYN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             _June 4th._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COAL DISTRICT.—AN OPTIMIST._]\r\n\r\nThe most agreeable chimes, from the church tower, we had ever heard,\r\nawoke us this morning at three o’clock. It is light enough here at that\r\ntime to read or write, and the twilight at evening does not seem to be\r\nover at half-past ten. I felt very stiff and sore, but arose and wrote\r\ntill half-past six, when we got the bar-maid up, paid our bill (we were\r\ncharged only sixpence a piece for our lodging), and were let out into\r\nthe street; no signs that any one else in the town was yet stirring.\r\n\r\nOur road ran through a coal district, tall chimneys throwing out long\r\nblack clouds of smoke, and pump-levers working along the hill-tops; the\r\nroad darkened with cinders; sooty men coming home from the night-work\r\nto low, dirty, thatched cottages—the least interesting and poorest\r\nfarmed country we had yet travelled over. After walking six miles, we\r\nstopped at the Talbot Inn, Ruabon, to breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn the tap-room, over his beer, was a middle-aged man, a currier\r\nby trade, who told us he had come hither nine years ago from\r\nStaffordshire, had married a nice Welsh girl, and settled himself very\r\ncomfortably. He said wages were good here, and it did not cost so much\r\nto live as it used to. He had a cottage in the village; the landlord,\r\nSir Watkins Wyn, was an excellent man, and his agent was very kind to\r\npoor people. He did not see any need of grumbling, and, for his part,\r\nthought the world a pretty fair world.\r\n\r\nAfter a good breakfast in a room adorned with sporting pictures and a\r\nlikeness of Sir Watkins Wyn, I returned to talk with him. When he had\r\nwork, his wages were six dollars a week, but just now he was out of\r\nwork. The rent of his cottage and four roods of land was one hundred\r\nand twenty dollars, and Sir Watkins paid the poor-rates. Sir Watkins\r\nwas not very generally liked by his tenants, because he was not so\r\nliberal with them as his father; but his father had been extravagant,\r\nand run the estate deeply in debt, and he had need to be more\r\nparticular: and he was sure he was always very easy with poor folks. He\r\nhad had a deduction made on his rent more than once when the times were\r\nhard with him, and this year the farmers all were allowed ten per cent.\r\nof their rents because corn is so low.\r\n\r\nI had told him I was from America, and he was asking me some questions\r\nabout it, when he suddenly stopped, fidgeted about a moment, and then,\r\nlooking at a woman coming across the street, said, with a laughing,\r\nswaggering air, “There’s my wife coming; now you’ll see a specimen of a\r\nWelsh girl!” His wife, a stout, hard-looking woman, walked briskly in,\r\nstood up straight before him, folded her arms, and, in a deep, quiet,\r\ndetermined way, gave him a regular _Caudling_. He tried for a while\r\nto make a joke of it, and to appease her. “Come now, missus, don’t be\r\nhard upon un’; sit ye down now, and take a pint; these gentlemen be\r\nfrom Ameriky, and I talks with ’um about going there. Come now, how’d\r\nthee like to go to Ameriky?” As we were thus introduced, she glanced\r\nfiercely at us, and we retreated at once without the door. He tried\r\nfor a moment longer to brave her, and called loudly for another mug of\r\nale. She turned her head to the bar-maid, and said, “You’ll get no more\r\nale!” and the bar-maid minded her.\r\n\r\nShe said he had been there before, this morning, and when he began\r\ndrinking in the morning it was always the last of him for the day. He\r\nwhimpered out that he had come home and breakfast wasn’t ready, and he\r\nhadn’t any thing else to do but to come back here. It _was_ ready, she\r\nsaid, and he might have been looking for some work, and so on. In a few\r\nminutes they went off arm in arm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FREIGHT WAGONS._]\r\n\r\nOpposite the inn was an old church and a graveyard. There were more\r\nmonkey-faces on the church, and two effigies in stone, of knights—the\r\nforms of their bodies with shields, barely distinguishable, and their\r\nfaces entirely effaced. Many of the gravestones had inscriptions in\r\nWelsh, and both here and at Wrexham I noticed the business of the\r\ndeceased person was given, as _John Johnes, Wheelright_; _William\r\nLloyd, Tanner_, _&c._ On a flat stone near the church, the following\r\nwas inscribed (letter for letter), probably by a Welsh stone-cutter\r\nfollowing an English order, given verbally—“_This his the end of the\r\nvault._”\r\n\r\nReturning from the church, we found the currier again drinking beer in\r\nthe tap-room, with a number of other men, a drunken set, that probably\r\nhad come passengers by a stage wagon that stood in the road. This was\r\nan immense vehicle, of pre-railroad origin, like our Pennsylvania\r\nwagons, but heavier and higher. It had a heavy freight of barrels,\r\ncases, and small parcels, on the top of which, under the canvass hooped\r\ncover, a few passengers were cheaply accommodated, there being a ladder\r\nin the rear for them to ascend by. Behind one of the hind-wheels was a\r\nroller, attached by chains on either side the wheel to the axle-tree,\r\nso that if the wagon fell back any, it scotched it—a good idea for\r\nheavy loads in a hilly country. There were six stout cart-horses to\r\ndraw it, and all in a line, the wheeler being in shafts. The driver\r\nsaid he had a load of eight or ten tons, and drove three miles an hour\r\nwith it. He paid about sixteen dollars a year taxes for his horses,\r\nand two dollars for a very ugly bull-dog that stood guard over the\r\nestablishment for more than an hour while he was refreshing himself in\r\nthe inn. At length we saw the whole company come out, and the wagon\r\nstarted again, all very jolly; the currier and another man, with their\r\nhands on each other’s shoulders, staggered across the street, singing\r\n“Oh, Susannah!” At the churchyard gate both fell, rolled over and\r\nembraced each other, once or twice tried ineffectually to get up, and\r\nthen both went to sleep there on the ground. No wonder the specimen\r\nWelsh girl had a hard look.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STAGE WAGON]\r\n\r\nAfter finishing our letters to send by the steamer, we visited Wynstay\r\nPark. It is much more picturesque than Eaton, the ground being\r\ndiversified and the trees larger. The deer also were larger; a servant\r\ntold us there were fifteen hundred of them. The hall, which is a plain\r\nbuilding, was undergoing repairs.\r\n\r\nWe separated here for a few days, my friends wishing to see more\r\nof Welsh scenery, and going to the vale of Llangollen (pronounced\r\nLangothlan), while I had a letter I wished to deliver in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THOROUGH DRAINING._]\r\n\r\nThe park was covered with lines of recently-made under-drains, and\r\nI hunted over it in hopes to find men at work, that I might see the\r\nmanner in which they were constructed. Going to a pretty checkered\r\ntimber-house to make inquiries, I was so fortunate as to meet the\r\nforeman of the draining operations, Mr. Green, an intelligent\r\nWarwickshire man, who obligingly took me to a field a mile or two\r\ndistant, where he had thirty men at work. The soil was a gravelly\r\nloam, with a little heavier subsoil. The drains were laid twenty-seven\r\nfeet apart, and dug three feet deep (ordinarily), and one foot wide\r\nfrom top to bottom; in the middle of the bottom a groove was cut for\r\nthe pipe, so the top of it would be three feet from the surface. No\r\nnarrow tools were used, except to cut the grooves for the pipe. The\r\nforeman said that though a man could work to much better advantage in a\r\nwider-mouthed drain, the extra dirt to be moved compensated for it, and\r\nmade this plan the cheapest.\r\n\r\nI thought then, and since, until I came to try it in gravelly and stony\r\nland, that the work might be done much more rapidly with the long,\r\nnarrow tools described by Mr. Delafield,[21] making the bottom of the\r\ndrain only of the width of the pipe intended to be laid; but I find\r\nthese can only be used to advantage in free ground. The method here\r\ndescribed is probably the best for draining soils, where many stones\r\nlarger than a hen’s egg are to be met with.\r\n\r\n[21] _Transactions N. Y. State Agricultural Soc._, 1848, p. 232.\r\n\r\nCylindrical pipes, of either one or one and a half inch bore, were\r\nlaid in the grooves at the bottom of the drain; _collars_, connecting\r\nthem, were only used in the loosest soils. The _mains_ were laid one\r\nfoot deeper than the collecting drains, and the pipes in them were from\r\ntwo to six inches bore. No series of drains were run more than seventy\r\nyards in length without a main, and all the mains emptied into an open\r\nditch at the lowest side of the field, which was made deep enough to\r\nallow of a drop of one foot from the mouths of the pipes. Where such a\r\nditch was likely to _gully_, the sides were sloped and turfed.\r\n\r\nI will hereafter give a chapter on the process of thorough draining\r\nin its most approved British methods, with estimates of cost, and a\r\ndiscussion of how far it may be profitably employed in the United\r\nStates. For Great Britain, it is the most important agricultural\r\nimprovement ever made, and it is hardly absurd to assert that its\r\ngeneral introduction during the last ten years has saved England from\r\na revolution; certainly it is of the greatest political and social\r\nconsequence to her; I trust, therefore, even my non-agricultural\r\nreaders will have some interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the men employed at this work averaged $2.25 a week; boys,\r\n16 cents a day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE GOOD LANDLORD._]\r\n\r\nMr. Green sent a lad to guide me across the park to the road I wished\r\nto take—a remarkably bright, amiable boy, with whom I had a pleasant\r\ntalk as he led me on by the most charming way, among the old oaks, and\r\nthrough herds of deer. He could read and write, and knew something\r\nof geography and arithmetic, having been instructed by the curate\r\nof Ruabon, whom he seemed to have much loved. (I think he had died\r\nlately.) He also spoke kindly of Sir Watkins and his lady, to whom his\r\nfather was shepherd, and said that all their servants and poor people\r\nwere much attached to them. Passing near the hall, I asked for some\r\nwater, and he took me into one of the servants’ cottages to get it.\r\nThere was an old woman rocking a cradle, and a young woman ironing\r\nlinen, both very neatly dressed, the furniture plain and meagre, but\r\nevery thing clean, and an appearance of a good deal of comfort about\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nWhile the repairs were being made upon the hall, the family lived\r\nin a cottage completely embowered among trees and shrubs, which we\r\nafterwards passed, and I had the honour of catching a glimpse, through\r\nthe foliage, of a form in a grey coat, which, I was assured, was the\r\ngood Sir Watkins himself.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the park, I crossed the Esk by a very high stone\r\narch, built “by Sir Watkins,” as some ragged boys and girls, who were\r\nemployed in collecting for manure the horsedung that dropped upon the\r\nroad, informed me, and this was the last I heard of Sir Watkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  STONE HOUSES.—IVY.—VIRGINIA CREEPER.—A VISIT TO A WELSH\r\n    HORSE-FAIR.—ENGLISH VEHICLES.—AGRICULTURAL NOTES.—HORSES.—BREEDS\r\n    OF CATTLE.—HEREFORDS, WELSH, AND SMUTTY PATES.—CHARACTER OF THE\r\n    PEOPLE.—DRESS.—POWIS PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _Shrewsbury, June 7th._\r\n\r\nI have been visiting a gentleman to whom I was introduced by Prof.\r\nNorton. His residence is on the east border of Wales, amidst very\r\nbeautiful scenery of round-topped hills, and deep, verdant, genial\r\ndells. He has the superintendence of a large number of mines of coal\r\nand metals, and of several agricultural estates, the extent of which\r\nmay be imagined from the fact, that he is preparing to thorough-drain\r\n5000 acres next winter. He is building a tilery, and will employ seven\r\nengineers, each with two foremen to oversee the workmen. The cost, it\r\nis estimated, will be from $23 to $25 an acre; drains, seventeen feet\r\napart and three feet deep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STONE BUILDINGS.—IVY._]\r\n\r\nThe house is of stone, and is covered with ivy, which I mention that I\r\nmay contradict a common report that ivy upon the wall of a house makes\r\nit damp. The contrary, I have no doubt, is the fact. The ivy-leaves\r\nfall one over another, shedding off the rain like shingles; and it is\r\nwell ascertained that in a long storm the inside walls of a house, or\r\nof those rooms in it which are protected by the ivy, are much less damp\r\nthan those not so shielded. It is also generally supposed in America\r\nthat stone houses are much damper than wood. This _may be_ so with\r\nsome kinds of porous stone, but I can testify from my own experience\r\nthat it is not so with others. A slight _furring out_ on the inside,\r\nand lath and plaster, will in all cases remove this objection to any\r\nstone. A good stone house is warmer in winter, cooler in summer,[22]\r\nequally dry and healthful, and, if built in convenient and appropriate\r\nstyle, every way much more satisfactory and comfortable than our\r\ncommon, slight-framed buildings. As for the ivy, I think it is one of\r\nthe most beautiful things God has given us, and the man who can and\r\ndoes not let it beautify his habitation, is sinfully ungrateful. It is\r\nperfectly hardy, and grows luxuriously on the north side of a house or\r\nwall in the climate of New York. (My experience is with the Irish ivy.)\r\n\r\n[22] In a late rapid change of weather, the thermometer on the outside\r\nof my house rose in 18 hours from 19° to 35°, while that within the\r\nwalls remained stationary at 20°, not rising even one degree!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ENGLISH DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE\r\n(_the village schoolmaster’s cottage_)]\r\n\r\nThe cut represents the schoolmaster’s house at Eccleston, and is\r\ninserted here to show the great beauty given by the creeper to that\r\npart of the house which it has grown upon, contrasted, as it is, with\r\nthe bare wall of the modern addition. The vine, in this case, is our\r\nVirginian creeper (_ampelopsis quinquefolia_, the common five-leaved\r\nvine of our fences—not the _poison ivy_), a very beautiful plant\r\ncertainly, and growing more rapidly than the European ivy, but having\r\nthis immeasurable disadvantage, that it is not _evergreen_.\r\n\r\nThe day after I reached here, my host had occasion to go to a\r\nhorse-fair at Welsh Pool, a place some twenty miles distant, and\r\ninvited me to accompany him. We went in a dog-cart, a kind of heavy\r\ngig, which here takes the place of our light boat-wagon. It is a box\r\n(large enough to hold a dog or two in driving to sporting ground), hung\r\nlow, between two small, heavy wheels, with a seat on the top of it for\r\ntwo, looking forward, and sometimes another in which two more can sit\r\nlooking backward. On the back, to exempt it from the tax upon more\r\nluxurious vehicles, is painted the owner’s name, business, and place of\r\nresidence, thus: “John Brown, Farmer, Owestry, Shrops.” All the humbler\r\nclass of carriages are thus marked here, including farm-carts.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes were agreeable in the country we passed through, but the\r\nfarming in much of it no better than in some parts of the Connecticut\r\nvalley. Coarse, rushy grass, indicating the need of draining, grew in\r\nmuch of the meadow land, as I think it does to the exclusion of more\r\nvaluable grasses in land that is ordinarily dryer than such as would\r\nspontaneously produce it in America. The buildings along the road were\r\nsuch as I have previously described; but I saw one old shackling board\r\nbarn which, but for its thatched roof, would have looked very home-like.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WELSH CHARACTER.—RUSTIC DRESS._]\r\n\r\nWelsh Pool is a small compact town (population 5,000) with a\r\nmarket-house, and a single small church, on the tower of which a\r\nunion-jack was hoisted, and within which there is a peal of three\r\nbells, that continually, all day long, did ring most unmusically; there\r\nwere booths in the main street, in which women sold dry goods, hosiery,\r\npottery, &c. In another street horses were paraded, and in other places\r\ncows and swine.\r\n\r\nThere was present a considerable crowd of the country people, which\r\nI observed carefully. I verily believe if five hundred of the common\r\nclass of farmers and farm-labouring men, such as would have come\r\ntogether on similar business—say from all parts of Litchfield county\r\nin Connecticut—had been introduced among them, I should not have known\r\nit, except from some peculiarities of dress. I think our farmers, and\r\nparticularly our labourers, would have been dressed up a little nearer\r\nthe town fashions, and would have seemed a little more wide awake,\r\nperhaps, and that’s all. I not only saw no drunkenness, except a very\r\nfew solitary cases late in the day, no rioting, though there were some\r\npolicemen present, but no _gayety_; every body wore a sober business\r\nface, very New England like.\r\n\r\nThe small farmers and labouring men all wore leggins, buttoning\r\nfrom the knee to the ankle; heavy hob-nailed shoes; little, low,\r\nnarrow-brimmed, round-topped felt hats, and frocks of linen, blue or\r\nwhite in colour, the skirts reaching below the knee, very short waists,\r\na kind of broad epaulette, or cape, gathered in, boddice fashion,\r\nbefore and behind, loose shirt-like sleeves, and the whole profusely\r\ncovered with needle-work. I suppose this is the original _smock-frock_.\r\nAn uglier garment could not well be contrived, for it makes every\r\nman who wears it appear to have a spare, pinched-up, narrow-chested,\r\nhump-backed figure. The women generally wore printed calico jackets,\r\ngathered at the waist, with a few inches only of skirt, and blue or\r\ngrey worsted stuff petticoats, falling to within a few inches of the\r\nankle—a picturesque, comfortable, and serviceable habit, making them\r\nappear more as if they were accustomed to walk and to work, and were\r\nnot ashamed of it, than women generally do. Most incongruously, as a\r\ntopping off to this sensible costume, a number of women had crowded\r\ntheir heads into that _ultima thule_ of absurd invention, a stiff,\r\nnarrow-brimmed, high-crowned, cylindrical fur hat. What they did with\r\ntheir hair, and how they managed to keep the thing on their heads, I\r\ncannot explain. I assert that they did do it, notwithstanding something\r\nof a breeze, as well as the most practised man, and without showing\r\nevidence of any particular suffering.\r\n\r\nThere were, perhaps, a hundred horses offered for sale; among them one\r\npair only of fine carriage-horses, one large and fine thorough bred\r\ncart-horse, and a few pretty ponies. All the rest were very ordinary\r\nstout working-horses, much like our Pennsylvania horses. The average\r\nprice of them was but a trifle over $100, about what they would bring\r\nat New York.\r\n\r\nThere were still fewer cattle, and they were all comprised in three\r\nbreeds and their intermixtures: first, Hereford, which predominated;\r\nsecond, Welsh, small, low, black beasts, with large heads and white\r\nfaces, black muzzles and long spreading horns; third, _Smutty pates_,\r\nan old Welsh breed hardly to be found in purity now. They are longer\r\nand somewhat larger than Devons, a little lighter red in colour,\r\nwith invariably black or brindle faces. They were generally in fair\r\ncondition, tolerable _feelers_, and would cut up particularly heavy in\r\ntheir hind quarters. A Smithfield man told me that he thought a cross\r\nof this breed with the Hereford made the best beef in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A REPULSE.—THE MASTIFF._]\r\n\r\nAfter dining with a number of gentlemen, most of whom had come from\r\na distance to attend the fair, I took a walk out into the country\r\nabout the town. The only object of interest that I remember was “Powis\r\nCastle,” the seat of a nobleman, finely situated in a picturesque,\r\nmountain-side park. The castle itself is upon a spur of the mountain\r\nand is entirely hidden among fine evergreen trees. I had toiled up to\r\nwithin about ten feet of the edge of the plateau upon which it stands,\r\nwhen I heard a low deep growl, and looking up saw above me a great dog\r\nasking me, with bristling back, curling fangs, and fierce grinning\r\nteeth, what business I had to be there. Considering that I had no\r\nright to be visiting the residence of a gentleman who was a stranger\r\nto me unless I had some business with him, and concluding upon short\r\nreflection that indeed I had none, I determined upon a retrograde\r\nmovement, and taking care not to attempt even to apologize to his\r\ndogship for the intrusion until I had brought a few trees between us,\r\nI found that he _backed down_ just about as fast as I did, so that\r\nat a distance of half a dozen rods he appeared a handsome, smooth,\r\ngenerous-natured mastiff, and I began to consider whether the earl\r\nwould not probably be pleased to have an intelligent stranger see the\r\nbeauty of his castle; but the moment I stopped, the dog’s lips began\r\nto part and his back to rise again, and I concluded that whatever the\r\nearl’s wishes might be, I could not make it convenient just then to\r\naccommodate him in that way, and returned forthwith to the village.\r\n\r\nThe true mastiff is a somewhat rare dog in England, and I don’t think\r\nthat I ever saw one in America. He is very large and powerful, and\r\nsmooth haired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH VEHICLES.—A FEUDAL CASTLE AND MODERN ARISTOCRATIC\r\n    MANSION.—ARISTOCRACY IN 1850.—PRIMOGENITURE.—DEMOCRATIC TENDENCY\r\n    OF POLITICAL SENTIMENTS.—DISPOSITION TOWARDS THE UNITED\r\n    STATES.—COMBATIVENESS.—SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. and C., after a tramp among the mountains of Wales, which they have\r\nmuch enjoyed, reached the village nearest to where I was visiting last\r\nnight. This morning a party was made with us to visit —— Castle. We\r\nwere driven in a “Welsh car,” which is much the same kind of vehicle as\r\nthe two-wheeled hackney cabs that a few years ago filled the streets of\r\nNew York, and then suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Two-wheeled\r\nvehicles are “all the go” in England. They are excessively heavy and\r\ncumbrous compared with ours, the wheels much less in diameter, and they\r\nmust run much harder, and yet, over these magnificent roads, they can\r\nload them much more heavily.\r\n\r\nThe castle is on high ground, in the midst of the finest park and\r\nlargest trees we have seen. The moat is filled up, and there are a few\r\nlarge modern windows in the upper part, otherwise it differs but little\r\nprobably from what it appeared in the time of the crusaders. The whole\r\nstructure is in the form of a square on the ground, with four low round\r\ntowers at the corners, and a spacious court-yard in the centre. The\r\nentrance is by a great arched gateway, over which the old _portcullis_\r\nstill hangs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARISTOCRATIC LUXURY._]\r\n\r\nWe were kindly shown through all its parts, including much not\r\nordinarily exhibited to strangers, and I confess that I was not more\r\ninterested in those parts which were its peculiar features as a feudal\r\nstronghold, than in those that displayed the sumptuous taste, luxury,\r\nand splendour of a modern aristocratic mansion. The state apartments\r\nwere truly palatial, and their garniture of paintings, sculpture,\r\nbijoutry, furniture, and upholstery, magnificent and delightful to the\r\neye, beyond any conception I had previously had of such things. Let\r\nno one say it will be soon reproduced, if it is not already excelled,\r\nin the mansions of our merchant-princes in America. Excelled it may\r\nbe, but no such effect can be reproduced or furnished at once to the\r\norder of taste and wealth, for it is the result of generations of\r\ntaste and wealth. There was in all, never a marvellous thing, or one\r\nthat demanded especial attention, or that proclaimed in itself great\r\ncostliness; and while nothing seemed new, though much was modern, most\r\nof the old things were of such materials, and so fashioned, that age\r\nwas of no account, and not a word was said by them of fleeting time.\r\nThe tone of all—yes, the _tone_—musical to all who entered, was, Be\r\nquiet and comfortable, move slowly and enjoy what is nearest to you\r\nwithout straining your eyes or your admiration;—nothing to excite\r\ncuriosity or astonishment, only quiet esthetic contemplation and calm\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nI liked it, liked to be in it, and thought that if I had come honestly\r\nto the inheritance of it, I could abandon myself to a few months living\r\nin the way of it with a good deal of heart. But in the first breath of\r\nthis day-dreaming I was interrupted by the question, Is it right and\r\nbest that this should be for the few, the very few of us, when for many\r\nof the rest of us there must be but bare walls, tile floors and every\r\nthing besides harshly screaming, scrabble for life? This question,\r\nagain, was immediately shoved aside unanswered by another, whether in\r\nthis nineteenth century of the carpenter’s son, and first of vulgar,\r\nwhistling, snorting, roaring locomotives, new-world steamers, and\r\nsubmarine electric telegraphs; penny newspapers, state free-schools,\r\nand mechanic’s lyceums, this still soft atmosphere of elegant longevity\r\nwas exactly the most favourable for the production of thorough, sound,\r\ninfluential manhood, and especially for the growth of the right sort of\r\nlegislators and lawgivers for the people.\r\n\r\nIt seems certainly that it would be hard for a man whose mind has been\r\nmainly formed and habited in the midst of this abundance of quiet,\r\nand beauty, and pleasantness, to rightly understand and judiciously\r\nwork for the wants of those whose “native air” is as different from\r\nthis as is that of another planet. Especially hard must it be to look\r\nwith perfect honesty and appreciating candour upon principles, ideas,\r\nmeasures that are utterly discordant with, and threaten to interrupt,\r\nthis costly nursery song to which his philosophy, religion, and habits\r\nhave been studiously harmonized.\r\n\r\nHard, by the way, very hard sometimes, must be the trial of a younger\r\nson in one of these families. One son only is the real son, to\r\nsympathize with and make his own, his father’s interests, arrangements,\r\nand hopes; the others are but hangers-on for a time, and while so must\r\ngrow accustomed to all this beauty and splendour—must be _enhomed_ to\r\nit, and then they are thrust out and return only as inferiors or as\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEMOCRATIC TENDENCY._]\r\n\r\nStrange! I find this monstrous primogeniture seems natural and\r\nHeaven-inspired law to Englishmen. I can conceive how, in its\r\norigin, it might have been so—in the patriarchal state, where it was\r\nthe general direction of the common inheritance, rather than the\r\ninheritance itself, that was taken by the eldest of each succeeding\r\ngeneration; but in modern civilized society, with its constant\r\nre-familization, and in England especially, where immediate isolated\r\ndomiciliation of every newly-wedded pair is deemed essential to harmony\r\nand happiness, it seems to me more naturally abhorrent and wrong than\r\npolygamy or chattel-slavery.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, if you take it up as a matter to be reasoned upon, there\r\nis much to be said for it, as there is for slavery, or, among the\r\nTurks, for extra wiveing, I suppose;—and first, I fully appreciate\r\nthat without it, could in no way be sustained such noble buildings\r\nand grounds—national banner-bearers of dignity—schools of art and\r\nsystematic encouragement of art, and perhaps I should add, systematic,\r\nenterprising agricultural improvements, such as this of five thousand\r\nacres thorough-drained _in the best manner_, by the conviction of its\r\nprofit in one man’s brain instead of fifty men’s, as it must be with\r\nus. And finally, it may be that for some few, there is sustained by it\r\na local home, a family nucleus, more permanently than it can be with us.\r\n\r\nBut there is every thing to be said against it, too, that there is\r\nagainst an aristocratical government and society, for the customs\r\nof primogeniture and entail are in fact the basis of aristocracy.\r\nAnd between an aristocratical government and society, with all its\r\ndignities, and amenities, and refinements, and a democracy with all\r\nits dangers, and annoyances, and humiliations, I do not believe that\r\nany man that has had fair observation of our two countries, and who\r\nis not utterly faithless in God and man, a thorough coward, or whose\r\njudgment is not shamefully warped by prejudice, habit, or selfishness,\r\ncan hesitate a moment. I think that few Englishmen, few even of the\r\nEnglish nobility, and no English statesman, would advise us to return\r\nto their system. I think that most of them would be sorry to believe\r\nthat England herself would fail of being a democratic nation a hundred\r\nyears hence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis opinion has been strengthened by the further acquaintance I have\r\nhad with Englishmen. I have little doubt that the majority of those\r\nwho ultimately control the British government, do wish and purpose, as\r\nfast as it may be expedient, to extend the elective franchise until it\r\nshall become universal male adult suffrage. That they do not do this as\r\nfast as _we_ should think expedient, is probably to be explained by the\r\nfact that they have not yet experienced, and cannot see with sufficient\r\nfaith, how very rapidly, in God’s providence, the self-governing\r\nstrength and discernment of a man is stimulated and increased by the\r\nfreedom to exercise it. And yet one would think that it was on this\r\nthat they depended alone, so entirely indifferent are they in general\r\nto the educational preparation of their subject class to enter the\r\nsovereign class.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper for me here to record my observation of the general\r\ndisposition of the English people towards our nation, which I confess\r\nI did not find to be exactly what I had anticipated, and which I think\r\nmust be generally much misconceived in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FEELING TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES._]\r\n\r\nThere is a certain class of the English, conservative whigs more than\r\ntories, as I met them, that look upon the United States people as a\r\nnation of vulgar, blustering, impertinent, rowdy radicals; very much as\r\na certain set with us look upon the young mechanics and butcher-boys of\r\nthe town—troublesome, dangerous, and very “low,” but who are necessary\r\nto put out fires, and whose votes are of value at elections, and whom\r\nit therefore _pays_ to make some occasional show of respect to, and it\r\nis best to keep on civil terms with. A considerable number of snobbish,\r\npretending, awkwardly positioned, sub-aristocratic, super-sensible\r\npeople, that swear by the Times, and have taken their cue from\r\nTrollope, follow in their wake. But the great mass of the educated\r\nclasses regard us very differently; not with unqualified respect and\r\nunalloyed admiration, but much as we of the Atlantic States regard our\r\nown California—a wild, dare-devil, younger brother, with some most\r\ndangerous and reprehensible habits, and some most noble qualities, a\r\ncapital fellow, in fact, if he would but have done sowing his wild oats.\r\n\r\nThis may be well enough understood in the United States, but further,\r\nthere is not in the English people, so far as I have seen them, rich\r\nor poor, learned or ignorant, high or low, the slighest soreness or\r\nrancorous feeling on account of our separation from them, or our war\r\nof separation. Of our success as a republic many of their aristocratic\r\npoliticians are no doubt jealous; and many having naval and military\r\ntastes, do not feel quite satisfied to hear our everlasting boasting\r\nabout the last war, and would like to have another round or two with us\r\nto satisfy themselves that they know how to fight a ship, if they don’t\r\nknow how to build her, as well as we. There is also a party of “aged\r\nwomen of both sexes,” that worship the ghost of that old fool, “the\r\ngood king George,” who, I suppose, look upon us with unaffected horror,\r\nas they do equally upon their own dissenters and liberals. Yet it never\r\nhappened to me, though I met and conversed freely with all classes,\r\nexcept the noble, while I was in England, to encounter the first man\r\nwho did not think that we did exactly right, or who was sorry that we\r\nsucceeded as we did in declaring and maintaining our independence.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that, _at that time_, the great mass of thinking men in\r\nEngland were much of that opinion. Our war was with king George and his\r\ncabinet, not with the people of England, and if they did reluctantly\r\nsustain the foolish measures of the king, it was precisely as our\r\nWhigs, who were opposed to the measures that led to the war with\r\nMexico, sustained, with money and with blood, that war when it did\r\ncome. It is a remarkable thing, that I have noticed that there are many\r\nmen in England who were born at the time of, or shortly subsequent to\r\nour revolutionary war, who are named after the American heroes of that\r\nwar, Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin.\r\n\r\nThis and other circumstances, early in my visit to England, made me\r\nreflect that the hostile feeling of the people had never been deeply\r\nengaged against us, while it soon became also evident that very much\r\nless of so much hostility as they once had towards us, had descended to\r\nthe present, than we are in the habit of calculating for.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the great difference in this respect of the _popular\r\nfeeling_ in the two countries is evident, though it often extremely\r\npuzzles and offends a liberal Englishman who has been in the habit of\r\nlooking with the greatest feeling of fraternity towards the people of\r\nthe United States, to find himself when he comes among them expected in\r\nall his opinions and feelings to be either a traitor to his own country\r\nor an enemy of ours. It is easily explained however.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._]\r\n\r\nThere is a love of hostility in our nature that wants some object to\r\ndirect itself towards. Seventy years ago, and forty years ago, that\r\nobject to us as a nation was the kingdom of Great Britain. No other\r\nobject until within a few years has been offered to us to weaken that\r\ntraditional hostility. All our military and naval glory, the most\r\nblazing, though by no means the most valuable, jewels of our national\r\npride, have been our victories in war with Great Britain. Almost our\r\nonly national holidays have been in a great part exultations over\r\nour successful hostilities with Great Britain. “The enemy” and “the\r\nBritish,” came to me from my fighting grandfather as synonymous terms.\r\nWhen I was a child I never saw an Englishman but I was on my guard\r\nagainst him as a spy, and would look behind the fences to see that\r\nthere was no ambuscade of red-coats. I made secret coverts about the\r\nhouse, so that when they came to sack and burn it, and take our women\r\nand children and household goods into captivity, I could lay in wait\r\nto rescue them. In our school-boy games the beaten party was always\r\ncalled “British” (the term “_Britisher_,” I never saw except in a\r\nBritish book or heard except in England). If a law was odious it was\r\ntermed a British law; if a man was odious he was called an “old Tory;”\r\nand it has been with us a common piece of blackguardism till within a\r\nshort time, if not now, to speak of those of an opposing party as under\r\nBritish influence.\r\n\r\nThe war had been with us a war of the people; not a woman as she sipped\r\nher tea but imbibed hatred to the taxing British, and suckled her\r\noffspring with its nourishment; not a man of spunk in the country but\r\nwas hand to hand fighting with the British, and teaching his sons never\r\nto yield to them.\r\n\r\nIn England, on the other hand, comparatively few of the people knew or\r\ncared at all about the war; even the soldiers engaged in it were in\r\nconsiderable numbers mere hirelings from another people, whom the true\r\nEnglish would have rather seen whipped than not, so far as they had\r\nany _national_ feeling about it. Their hostile feeling was even then\r\nmore directed towards France than towards America; and now, I do not\r\nbelieve there is one in a thousand of the people of England that has\r\nthe slightest feeling of hostility towards us, descending or inherited,\r\nfrom that time. It was much so again in the later war. England was at\r\nwar with half the world in those days, and if a general disposition\r\nof enmity towards us had been at all aroused in the course of it, all\r\nrecollection of it was lost in the fiercer wars with other nations\r\nthat immediately followed. I doubt if one-half the voters of England\r\ncould tell the name of a single ship engaged in the war of 1812;\r\nwhether it was General Hull or Commodore Hull that was heroized in it;\r\nwhether, in the assault upon New Orleans or Washington, it was that\r\ntheir forces were successful; or whether, finally, they carried or lost\r\nthe diplomatic point for which their soldiers and sailors had been set\r\nto fighting.\r\n\r\nEven if the people of England could remember us equally among other\r\nimportant nations as their enemy, it would be a very different feeling\r\ntowards us that it would lead to, from the remembrance of us as their\r\n_old and only_ enemy; so that not only was our original share of the\r\nhostile feeling of the people of England a very small one, being\r\nprincipally confined to the king and his sycophants, and the idolaters\r\nof the divine right, but the pugnacious element in the nature of an\r\nEnglishman, of our day, is directed by much more vivid remembrances\r\ntowards France, or Spain, or Germany, than towards us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE RADICALS AND SLAVERY._]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more friendly than the general disposition of the\r\nEnglish people at present towards us. The liberals, especially,\r\nhave great respect for us, and look upon us as their allies against\r\nthe world of injustice, oppression, and bigotry. (Just now the\r\nfree-traders, however, seem to be a little miffed with us because we\r\nhave not gone over _stock and fluke_ all at once to perfect reciprocity\r\nwith them, and the Tories are consequently our greatest flatterers.)\r\nThe uneducated, common people in general know no difference between\r\nAmerica and Russia, but the more intelligent of the working classes are\r\noften very fairly informed with regard to our country, and are our most\r\nsincere admirers and friends. All the more sober and religious people\r\nhave a great horror of our slavery and of the occasional Lynch-law\r\nperformances on our western border, of which they always get the first\r\nand darkest reports, and none of the corrections and extenuating\r\ncircumstances that come in later and cooler despatches. On slavery they\r\nare usually greatly misinformed, and view it only as an unmitigated and\r\nwholly inexcusable wrong, injustice, and barbarous tyranny for which\r\nall Americans are equally responsible, and all equally condemnable, and\r\nwith regard to which all are to be held responsible, and everlastingly\r\nto be scolded at (except a few martyrs, called abolitionists, that\r\nobtain a precarious livelihood through their contributions). The\r\nChartists and Radicals, too, are generally _down_ very hard upon an\r\nAmerican about slavery, and are commonly grossly misinformed about\r\nit. I wish our Southern brethren would send a few lecturers upon the\r\nsubject to England; the abolitionists have it all their own way there\r\nnow, and take advantage of it to give the ignorant people ideas about\r\nour country which it is very desirable should be contradicted. I wish\r\nespecially that they could make them comprehend how it is that we at\r\nthe north have nothing to do with their peculiar institution, and are\r\nnot to be expected to carry pistols and bowie-knives and fight every\r\nbody that chooses to attack it all over the world. This is no more nor\r\nless than a great many people in some parts of England seem to expect,\r\nwhen they are told that one is an American, and it comes sometimes to\r\nbe a regular bore to a traveller to have to disappoint them. There\r\nis, in truth, a hundred times more hard feeling in England towards\r\nAmerica from this cause, than from all others, and it is unfortunately\r\nstrongest with the most earnestly republican and radically democratic\r\nof her citizens.\r\n\r\nWithin this year or two there has been much more interest with\r\nregard to America among all classes in England than previously, more\r\nhope and more fear of us than ever before. The works of our best\r\nauthors—Irving, Emerson, Bancroft, Bryant, Channing, Cooper, Hawthorne,\r\nand Whittier—are, many of them, as well known and as generally read\r\nin England as in America. The introduction of American provisions,\r\ncutting under the native products, has brought even the farmers to\r\nscowlingly glance at us, and as, just at this time, most of them are\r\nforced to be thinking of emigration for themselves or their children,\r\nthey are generally disposed to honestly inquire about us. Among\r\nall making inquiries of me, I never found one to whom our form of\r\ngovernment was an objection. Finally, the present of food which, in\r\nthe famine, we sent to Ireland—a most mean portion out of our plenty\r\nand superabundance to dole out to an actual STARVING neighbour, a most\r\nunworthy expression of our Christian charity and brotherly regard for\r\nher, it has always seemed to me, but such as it was—obtained for us not\r\nonly in Ireland, but all through Great Britain, a strange degree of a\r\nsort of affectionate respect, not altogether unmingled with jealousy\r\nand soreness because they cannot pay it back.\r\n\r\nAltogether, considering the exceedingly queer company English\r\ntravellers seem usually to keep when in the United States, and the\r\natrocious caricatures in which, with few exceptions, they have\r\nrepresented our manners and customs to their countrymen, I was\r\nsurprised at the general respect and the degree of correct appreciation\r\nof us that I commonly found. There is no country not covered by a\r\nBritish flag in the world, that the British of 1850 have any thing like\r\nthe degree of sympathy with, and affection for, that they have for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is happily evident, that since our war with\r\nMexico has given us a new military glory, it has also diverted our\r\nnational combativeness, in a degree, from our old enemy, and that since\r\nthe English liberals in so many ways, if not very valuable, at least\r\nas much so as ours, have shown their sympathy and desire to assist our\r\ncommon brethren struggling for freedom on the Continent; since the\r\nlynching of the Butcher of Austria by the beer-men of Bankside, and the\r\ngeneral exultation of the British people over it; since the general\r\nintercommunication between the countries has been made so much more\r\nfrequent and speedy, and cheaper than it used to be, the disposition of\r\nour people towards the British has been much less suspicious, guarded,\r\nand quarrelsome than it very naturally, if not very reasonably, was,\r\nuntil within a few years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OCEAN PENNY POSTAGE._]\r\n\r\nGod grant that every tie grow constantly tighter that binds us together\r\nto peace, and to mutual assistance and co-labour—for justice, for\r\nfreedom, for the salvation of the world. If there is any body who does\r\nnot heartily say Amen to this, I commend him to Elihu Burritt; and all\r\nwho do, I call upon, from him, to go to work for OCEAN PENNY POSTAGE—so\r\nshall our prayer not fail. (_See Appendix, B._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  PAINTINGS.—CROMWELL.—PASTORAL SHIPS.—FAMILY PORTRAITS AND DISTANT\r\n    RELATIONS.—FAMILY APARTMENTS.—PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.—THE WREKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pictures which most interested me were portraits of Cromwell and\r\nCharles, one of Rubens, two of very beautiful women of the family, by\r\nSir Peter Lely, a female face by Carlo Dolci, and two or three little\r\nthings by Rubens. The portrait of Cromwell appears as if he might have\r\nsat for it, as, if I remember rightly, is asserted. It looks like one’s\r\nidea of him, but not in the best light of his character—a melancholy,\r\nsour, deep, stern face.\r\n\r\nThere is a large landscape representing a brook tumbling over a rock\r\ninto the sea, on which is a fleet of shipping. The story is, that\r\nit was painted by a French artist on a visit here, and when first\r\nexhibited had, in place of the sea, a broad meadow through which the\r\nbrook meandered. Lady —— suggested that a few sheep on the broad\r\ngreen ground of the meadow would be a pleasing addition. “Sheeps! mi\r\nlady?” said the chagrined artist, “suppose you better like it with\r\nsheeps, I shall make de sheeps;” and so he painted a blue sea over the\r\ngreen meadow, and abruptly embouched his brook into it, that he might\r\nappropriately gratify Lady ——’s maritime penchant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INTERIOR DECORATIONS._]\r\n\r\nAmong the family portraits one was shown having a title that sounded\r\nfamiliarly to us, and after a moment’s thought we both remembered\r\nit to be that of the single nobleman whom an antiquarian friend had\r\ninformed us that our family had been, long before its emigration with\r\nthe Plymouth Pilgrims, by marriage connected with. If it had been a\r\nScotch castle, we might perhaps have felt ourselves a good deal more\r\nat home in consequence. It was an odd coincidence, and made us realize\r\nthe relationship of our democracy even to aristocratic England quite\r\nvividly.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] In speaking of our relationship as a nation to England, I do not\r\nmean to ignore our relationship also to other nations. I think Mr.\r\nRobinson has very conclusively proved that, taking the people of the\r\nUnited States altogether, the majority are by no means of Anglo-Saxon\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this I think I may say a few words of the private\r\napartments of the family, through nearly all which, apparently,\r\nwe were shown. They were comparatively small, not larger, or more\r\nnumerous, or probably as _expensively_ furnished as those of many of\r\nour wealthy New York mercantile families; but some of them were very\r\ndelightful, and would be most tempting of covetousness to a man of\r\ndomestic tastes or to a lover of art or of literary ease. Generally\r\nthere was most exquisite taste evident in colours and arrangements and\r\nforms of furniture, and there were proofs of high artistic skill in\r\nsome members of the family, as well as a general love and appreciation\r\nof the beautiful and the excellent. Some of the rooms were painted\r\nin very high colours, deep blue and scarlet and gold, and in bizarre\r\nfigures and lines. I hardly could tell how it would please me if I\r\nwere accustomed to it, but I did not much admire it at first sight; it\r\ndid not seem English or home-like. It is just the thing for New York\r\nthough, and I have no doubt you’ll soon see the fashion introduced\r\nthere, and dining-rooms, dressing-rooms, counting-rooms, and steamboat\r\nstate-rooms all equally flaring.\r\n\r\nThe bed-chambers and dressing-rooms were furnished to look exceedingly\r\ncosy and comfortable, but there was nothing very remarkable about them,\r\nexcept, perhaps, the immense preparation made for washing the person.\r\nI confess if I had been quartered in one of them, I should have needed\r\nall my Yankee capabilities to guess in what way I could make a good use\r\nof it all.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told of two members of our legislature that came\r\ntogether from “the rural districts,” and were fellow-lodgers. One of\r\nthem was rather mortified by the rough appearance of his companion who\r\nwas of the “bone-and-sinew” sort, and by way of opening a conversation\r\nin which he could give him a few hints, complained of the necessity\r\nwhich a Representative was under to pay so much for “washing.” “How\r\noften do you shift?” said the Hon. Simon Pure. “Why, of course I have\r\nto change my linen every day,” he answered. “You do?” responded his\r\nunabashed friend. “Why, what an awful dirty man you must be! I can\r\nalways make mine last a week.”\r\n\r\nAmong the other bedrooms there were two with their beds which had been\r\noccupied by kings. I do not recollect any thing peculiar in their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe ball-room, or ancient banqueting-room, was a grand hall (120 feet\r\nlong, I should think), with a good deal of interesting old furniture,\r\narmour, relics, &c. It also contained billiard-tables, and other\r\nconveniences for in-door exercise. A secret door, cut through the\r\nold oak wainscot which lined its wall, admitted us to the private\r\napartments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A BORDER FORTRESS._]\r\n\r\nWe peeped into a kind of broad well into which prisoners used to be\r\nlowered like butter for safe keeping, and ascended to the battlements\r\nof one of the towers, from which there is a very extensive and\r\nbeautiful view, extending it is said into sixteen counties. A gauzy\r\nblue swelling on the horizon was pointed to as the _Wrekin_, a high\r\nmountain—the highest in midland England; hence the generous old toast,\r\n“To all around the Wrekin.” We were let out through a narrow postern,\r\nwhich gave us an opportunity to see the thickness of the wall: it was\r\nten feet, and in some parts it was said to be sixteen,—of solid stone\r\nand mortar. The castle was a border fortress of Wales, on the dyke\r\nor ancient military wall between that country and England, remains\r\nof which can be seen running each way from it. It has withstood many\r\nsieges, the last by Cromwell, the effect of whose artillery upon it is\r\nlargely manifest within the court. A decree of the long parliament is\r\non record ordering it to be razed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n  VISIT TO A FARM.—FARM-HOUSE AND FARMERY.—FATTING\r\n    CATTLE.—SHEEP.—VETCHES.—STOCK YARD.—STEAM THRESHING.—TURNIP\r\n    SOWING.—EXCELLENT WORK.—TRAM ROAD.—WAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we were taken to visit a farmer who was considered\r\nabout the best in the district (Shropshire). The house was in the\r\nmiddle of a farm of three hundred acres, and was approached by a narrow\r\nlane; there were no _grounds_ but a little court-yard, with a few trees\r\nin it, in front of the house, which was a snug, two-story, plain brick\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOn entering, we found the farmer, a stout elderly man, sitting alone\r\nat a dinner-table, on which were dishes of fruit and decanters. He\r\ninsisted on our joining him, and we were obliged to sit some time with\r\nhim over his wine while he talked of free-trade and questioned us how\r\nlow we could afford to send wheat from America, and how large the\r\nsupply was likely to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A SHROPSHIRE FARMERY._]\r\n\r\nHe then led us into the farmery, which was close by the house, the rear\r\ndoor almost opening into a cattle yard. I mention this as it would be\r\nconsidered extraordinary for an American gentleman who could afford\r\nwines at his dinner, to be content with such an arrangement. There\r\nwas not the least attempt at ornament anywhere to be seen, beyond the\r\nfew trees and rose-bushes in the enclosure of a rod or two, in front\r\nof the house: not the least regard had been had to beauty except the\r\nbeauty of fitness, but every thing was neat, useful, well ordered,\r\nand thoroughly made of the best material—the barns, stables, and\r\nout-buildings of hewn stone, with slated roofs, grout floors, and iron\r\nfixtures. The cattle stables were roomy, well ventilated and drained,\r\ntheir mangers of stone and iron; fastenings, sliding chains; food,\r\nfresh-cut vetches, and the cattle standing knee deep in straw.\r\n\r\nThe fatting cattle were the finest lot I ever saw, notwithstanding\r\nthe forty finest cows that had been wintered had been sold within a\r\nfortnight. These forty had been fattened on ruta baga and oil-cake, and\r\ntheir _average_ weight was over 10 cwt., some of them weighing over 12\r\ncwt. They were mostly short-horns. Those remaining were mostly Hereford\r\nbullocks.\r\n\r\nSheep were fatting on a field of heavy vetches: Cheviots and\r\nLeicesters, and crosses of these breeds.\r\n\r\nThe VETCH is a plant in appearance something like a dwarf pea; it is\r\nsown in the autumn upon wheat stubble, grows very rapidly, and at this\r\nseason gives a fine supply of green food, when it is very valuable. It\r\nrequires a rich, clean soil, but grows well on clay lands. I think it\r\nhas not been found to succeed well in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the barns was a yard half filled with very large and\r\nbeautifully made-up stacks of hay, wheat, oats, and peas. The hay was\r\nof rye-grass, a much finer (smaller) sort than our timothy. The peas\r\nwere thatched with wheat-straw. The grain stacks were very beautiful,\r\nseveral of them had stood three years, and could not be distinguished\r\nfrom those made last year. The butts of the straw had been all turned\r\nover at regular distances, those of one tier to the top of that below\r\nit, and driven in, so the stack appeared precisely as if it had been\r\n_served_ with straw-rope, and I supposed that it had been, until I was\r\ntold. The threshing of the farm is done by steam, the engine being in\r\nthe stack-yard, the furnace under-ground, and the smoke and sparks\r\nbeing carried off by a subterranean flue to a tall chimney a hundred\r\nyards distant. (I have seen a hundred steam-engines in stackyards\r\nsince, without this precaution, and never heard of a fire occasioned by\r\nthe practice.)\r\n\r\nThe grain on the farm had all been sowed in drills. The proprietor said\r\nthat if he could be sure of having the seed perfectly distributed,\r\nhe should prefer broad-cast sowing (i. e., as well as a first-rate\r\nsower could distribute it in a perfectly calm day). The wheat was the\r\nstrongest we have yet seen, and of remarkably equal height, and uniform\r\ndark colour. The ground was almost wholly free from weeds, and the\r\nwheat was not expected to be hoed.\r\n\r\nWe found fourteen men engaged in preparing a field for turnips: opening\r\ndrills with plough, carting dung, which had been heaped up, turned,\r\nand made fine, distributing it along the drills, ploughs covering it\r\nimmediately, and forming ridges 27 inches apart over it; after all,\r\na peculiar iron-roller, formed so as to fit the ridges and furrows,\r\nfollowed, leaving the field precisely like a fluted collar. The ridges\r\nwere as straight as the lines of a printed page; and any inequality, to\r\nthe height of half an inch, was removed by the equal pressing of the\r\nroller. A more perfect piece of work could not be conceived of. Seed (3\r\nlbs. to the acre) will be sown immediately on the ridges, by a machine\r\nopening, dropping, closing, and rolling six drills at once. The field\r\nis thorough-drained (as is all the farm, three feet deep) and subsoil\r\nploughed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FARM-ROAD.—WAGES._]\r\n\r\nI saw no farming that pleased me better than this in all England. It\r\nwas no gentleman or school farming, but was directed by an old man, all\r\nhis life a farmer, on a leased farm, without the least thought of taste\r\nor fancy to be gratified, but with an eye single to quick profit; with\r\na prejudice against “high farming,” indeed, because it is advised by\r\nthe free-traders as a remedy for low prices. He declared no money was\r\nto be made by farming: do his best, he could not pay his rent and leave\r\nhimself a profit under the present prices. He had been holding on to\r\nhis wheat for three years in hopes of a rise, but now despaired of it,\r\nexcept the protective policy was returned to.\r\n\r\nThere was a coal mine and lime-kiln on the farm, and a tram-road from\r\nit to the railroad about two miles distant. A tram-road is a narrow\r\ntrack of wooden rails, on which cars are moved by stationary power or\r\nhorses. On extensive farms they might be advantageously made use of.\r\nA road running through the barns and out-buildings of a farmstead, on\r\nwhich straw, feed, dung, &c., could be easily moved by hand, would cost\r\nbut little, and often afford a great saving of labour.\r\n\r\nThe fences were all of hawthorn, low, and close-trimmed.\r\n\r\nThe farm servants had from $65 to $75 a year and their board. (The very\r\nnext day a man told me he paid just half these sums.) Day-labourers\r\nfrom $2 to $2.50 a week (fair weather) and board themselves. A boy just\r\nover fourteen years old (under which age it is by law forbidden) told\r\nme he worked in the coal mines for sixteen cents a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                  VISIT TO TWO ENGLISH COMMON SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with our desire to visit an English common school, we\r\nwere driven from the castle to a village in the vicinity, in which was\r\na school for boys under the guidance of the British Foreign Society,\r\nand one for girls under the control of the National, or State Church,\r\nSociety. The school-house of the former was a simple but tasteful stone\r\nbuilding, standing a little one side, but not fenced off, from the\r\nprincipal street, with a few large trees and a playground about it. The\r\ninterior was all in one room, except a small vestibule. It was well\r\nlighted, the walls were plastered and whitewashed, and had mottoes,\r\ntexts of Scripture, tables, charts, &c., hung upon them; there was\r\nno ceiling, but the rafters of the roof, which was high-peaked, were\r\nexposed; the floor was of stone. There were long desks and benches\r\nall around against the wall, and others, the form of which I do not\r\nremember, filling up the most of the body. The house and furniture was\r\nmuch too small and scanty for the number of scholars present, and the\r\nlabour of the teacher must have been very arduous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMMON SCHOOLS._]\r\n\r\nThe boys all rose as we entered, and remained standing during our\r\nvisit, a request from us that they might be seated not being regarded.\r\nClasses in arithmetic, geography, and spelling were examined before us.\r\nThe absence of all embarrassment, and the promptness and confidence of\r\nthe scholars in replying to our questions was remarkable. In mental\r\narithmetic great proficiency was shown in complicate reductions of\r\nsterling money. In geography their knowledge of America was limited\r\nto the more important points of information, but so far as it went\r\nwas very accurate and ready. With regard to Great Britain, their\r\ninformation was very minute. The boys were particularly bright,\r\nready-witted, and well-behaved, and surprisingly free from all\r\nexcitement or embarrassment before strangers.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster was also parish-clerk, and his pay from the two\r\noffices was about $500 a year.[24] I judged that he had intended to\r\nmake teaching his business for life, and had thoroughly prepared\r\nand accomplished himself for it. His manner to us, and two or three\r\nincidents which it would be impossible to relate, gave me the\r\nimpression that his position in society was far from being a pleasant,\r\nor what we should deem a proper one for a teacher.\r\n\r\n[24] Advertisements for common-school teachers, “capable to instruct\r\nin reading, writing, arithmetic, and the principles of the Christian\r\nreligion,” appear in the Times, offering salaries of from $150 to $800,\r\nwith lodging and board.\r\n\r\nThe “National School” for girls was a building of more highly finished\r\narchitectural character, and had a dwelling for the schoolmistress\r\nattached to it. The whole school was engaged in sewing when we entered,\r\nthe mistress, assisted by some of the older scholars, going from one\r\nto another, giving instructions and examining the work. It was not\r\ninterrupted by our entrance, though the girls all rose, curtseyed, and\r\ncontinued standing. There were one hundred and thirty present in a\r\nroom about twelve yards by six in area. The girls were neatly, though\r\nexceedingly plainly, dressed, and were generally very pleasing in their\r\nappearance. They seemed well instructed, and without the least want of\r\ndesirable modesty, showed much more presence of mind, and answered\r\nour questions with more promptness and distinctness than any school of\r\ngirls I ever visited before.\r\n\r\nBoth schools are conducted on the Lancasterian plan.[25]\r\n\r\n[25] I propose, in some future letter, to give a general account of the\r\nEnglish common schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were leaning over the gunwale, where I had been watching the\r\ncurious, nebulous-like life that was revealed in the sea-fire splashing\r\nfrom the ship’s sides, and our conversation turning upon this, we\r\ntalked of a number of marine mysteries. He believed that there was a\r\nlarge class of animated nature fitted to exist only in dense waters\r\nat the depths of the ocean, and which only appeared on the surface\r\nwhen in a diseased state. He had great confidence that such must be\r\nthe case, and he cited several cases, known to naturalists, where\r\nnature has very peculiarly fitted animals and vegetables to enjoy life\r\nunder circumstances in which nothing could exist of the more ordinary\r\norganisms. I remarked that there was a wonderful connection and fitting\r\ntogether of one thing to another, through the whole of nature, as if it\r\nwere all designed together, and every part contrived with reference to\r\nall the rest; to which he assented.\r\n\r\n“And does not that irresistibly impress you with the idea of a\r\nreasoning mind having constructed it for certain purposes of his own,\r\nto which purposes all this working together must have reference?”\r\n\r\n“Humph! Suppose it does. Say every thing must have a cause, and call\r\nthe cause of the world, God, if you like. What do they stop there for?\r\nI want to know what’s the cause of God; what is God’s God. You see, you\r\nmust back up farther for that cause.”\r\n\r\n“But we can take one step. Suppose we do take that, and see what we can\r\nmake of it first. There must be, or there seems likely to have been, a\r\nconstructing mind—a will—above us—”\r\n\r\n“An imaginary something that put the world together. Well, suppose\r\nthere is.”\r\n\r\n“That put our minds and bodies together, that made us with our own\r\npeculiar characters and wills, distinct apparently from each other’s\r\nand from His.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well!—that created us. Suppose he did; what’s the good of saying\r\nthat, if you don’t know any thing more. What did he create us for?—what\r\nis he going to make of us?—what’s the will he put into my body going\r\nto do for him?—what did he want to make me so for, and you a different\r\nway, and a hog in another way for? My will _is_ independent of his; I\r\nknow nothing about his will, and I have nothing to do with him. I can\r\ntalk to you, and you talk back, and I can see you, and I know you; but\r\nhim, supposing there is such a being, I know nothing about, and what’s\r\nthe use, like a fool, of talking of him by name as if I did?”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, how do I know there’s such a place as Liverpool? I\r\nnever have seen it any more than I have God. From the evidence of my\r\nsenses I know nothing of it; and yet I am fool enough (if you please\r\nto call me so) to come aboard this ship with provisions for sixty\r\ndays, calculating that in that time I shall be carried to an imaginary\r\nsomething which I talk about by the name of Liverpool.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon you will in twenty if this wind holds.”\r\n\r\n“I think it likely, but what do I know about it?—actually nothing,\r\nexcept that you and others tell me you have been there, and that the\r\nship will go there, and I have faith enough in your word, and the\r\npromises of the captain, to put but here where I have never been\r\nbefore, and don’t know from any thing I can see, any more than a fool,\r\nwhere or what it is I am being taken to. Now, though I never saw this\r\nbeing with the creating will, which we will call God, I can tell you\r\nsomething more about him, not that I actually know, only I have heard—”\r\n\r\n“Heard! heard! how?”\r\n\r\n“Why, people tell me and I’ve read, just as I have read travellers’\r\naccounts of Liverpool, that there was a man once that professed to know\r\nall about it,—in fact, that he made it all himself—”\r\n\r\n“Made it himself, a man! I thought we agreed to call the maker of it,\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; out of this form of a man, for so it is described, there\r\nexpressed itself—a mind, declaring itself to be the same mind that\r\nmade the world; and that it had entered that form that it might tell\r\nus in the language, not only of the lips and tongue and breath, but in\r\nall the language of all the members in all the actions of a man, what\r\nhe thought it desirable for us to know about him,—the God; about his\r\npurposes in creating the world and us, and what now he wanted of us.\r\nSomething of this he said in words, Hebrew words, which some of the\r\npeople translated into Greek, and they have been again turned into\r\nEnglish, and in this way I have read considerable of it; but more he\r\ntold in the actions of the life of that man. If a stranger comes to me,\r\nand says that he loves me, I don’t well know what he means, for there’s\r\nall sorts of love, and some of it not worth many thanks. I should be\r\nstill more uncertain if he spake in the Chinese tongue, and it had to\r\nbe carried through Portuguese into English; but if I had been detected\r\nin some disgraceful crime, and every body scorned and hissed at me,\r\nand a man should come, alone of all a crowd, and lift me out of the\r\ndust where I lay in expectation of death, and cheer me with hopeful\r\nand encouraging words, I should not need to be told that he loved me,\r\nto be grateful to him; and if you were an Indian, and it was told to\r\nyou in Choctaw, you’d understand it exactly as I would, and have no\r\nmistake and no doubt about what he meant. Now supposing the great power\r\nand wisdom that contrived and executed this world, and all we know of\r\nmaterial things, was showing itself in that man that so pretended,\r\nand we have a reliable account of the way he lived, we can infer what\r\nat least is the general character and tendency of his motives and\r\npurposes, and judge pretty well what he wants of us.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not altogether more likely a man making such pretensions,\r\nwas an impostor?”\r\n\r\n“We must judge of that too by his character as displayed otherwise than\r\nin professions. Now what do we find? An earnest, serious man, seemingly\r\nliving only to do and be good; subduing extraordinary temptations of\r\npassion and ambition; helping and healing the sick, and the crippled,\r\nand the outcast, in season and out of season; speaking his mind truly\r\nand freely, no matter who he hits; persevering in what he thinks is\r\nright, and just, and merciful, though it is disreputable and directly\r\nin the teeth of the prevailing standard of morals; sticking to it,\r\nthough he is misunderstood, reproached, and forsaken for it, as a\r\nwilful, stubborn fanatic, by his friends, and it destroys his influence\r\nover all the respectable part of the community.”\r\n\r\n“Good for him, by jingo! They didn’t _excommunicate_ him, did they? If\r\nit had been in the United States or in England, they would have said he\r\nwas damned, body and soul, past recovery, and utterly unworthy of the\r\nmeans of grace!”\r\n\r\n“They said the devil was in him and turned him out of the synagogue,\r\nwhich is much the same, I take it.”\r\n\r\n“Right—I never thought of that; he must have been a true honest man.”\r\n\r\n“Just such a man as you would like to be yourself Mr. C., only a\r\ngreat deal more so—a thorough-going brave man of the people, an\r\nout-and-out democrat, fraternizing with the very lowest classes, and\r\nseeing and trying all sorts of life. More than that, sir, he could\r\nendure misrepresentation and the ingratitude and unfaithfulness of\r\nfriends without impatience; and finally, to realize his purpose more\r\neffectually, he could suffer without wavering the severest mental\r\nand bodily agony, and at length could die, without the least stain\r\nof inconsistency on his noble, manly character, not as you might be\r\nwilling to on the barricades, but alone, and by slow process of law.”\r\n\r\n“All right, sir, and a true man, call him what you will.”\r\n\r\n“A true man, sir, and no time-server, and now, what taught he? That\r\ngoodness, truth, and love, and happiness are one and inseparable.\r\nFurther, that all the good in the universe is a commonwealth (kingdom\r\nof God), and that one’s enjoyment of it cannot be separate from\r\nanother’s. He always seemed to think every body else’s good just as\r\nmuch his business as his own, and taught his followers to find their\r\nhappiness in that of others; always to do that for others which they\r\nwould have done for themselves.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s just what they don’t do.”\r\n\r\n“They don’t pretend they do, but they believe it’s the right plan, and\r\nthey wish to and try to, and they say he never did any other way. His\r\nwhole life, as it is described to us, does seem to be in accordance\r\nwith the idea, and if no other man’s ever was, so much the better for\r\nhim. Perfect love always guiding him, entire annihilation of self,\r\nselfish purpose all merged in desire for the general good of mankind.”\r\n\r\n“A very nice model of a man, no doubt, _if_——one must believe the\r\nstory; but you see I don’t.” Here he went off into a long and laboured\r\nattack upon the Bible as being called an infallible guide, and upon\r\nthe theory of plenary inspiration. If it teaches one thousand men one\r\ndoctrine, and one thousand other men, of an average equal capacity,\r\ndirectly the opposite doctrine, he would like to know what it\r\ninfallibly guided to—and so on: some few of his points being fair and\r\nreasonable, some of them utterly absurd, and the greater part of his\r\nargument mere narrow-minded cavilling and play upon words. I attempted\r\nvery little reply, as it was evident he was perfectly at home on the\r\nsubject, and would sail tack for tack with me all night, if he lost\r\nconfidence in his opinions on one gaining more on another. At length\r\nhe fell into a fierce tirade upon the character of the Apostles. He\r\nthought them cunning, selfish plotters, “the same as their descendants,\r\nour reverend aristocrats, that cannot find any better way of living\r\nthan by pulling wool over the poor workies’ eyes, while they draw fat\r\nsalaries from their pockets.”\r\n\r\n“A nice, lazy, comfortable sort of life they seem to have had of it,\r\ndon’t they?” I answered. “A jolly life, to be sure, loafing about\r\nwith their fat salaries. You remember what Dr. Paul’s was: ‘Of the\r\nJews five times forty stripes save one, thrice beaten with rods, once\r\nstoned, shipwrecked, &c., weariness, painfulness, &c., &c.’—So runs his\r\nreceipt! very _fat_, all that, isn’t it? Now, are you not ashamed of\r\nyourself? Talk about ‘aristocratic parsons!’ Every one of them started\r\na working man—not one even of the _bourgeoisie_ among them, unless it\r\nwas that same Paul, and he had his trade, and worked honestly at it\r\nto pay his travelling expenses. You call them aristocratic. What do\r\nyou mean! Why, sir, they were democratic socialists, and the worst\r\nsort, ‘having all things in common,’ the record of their acts says.\r\nAnd they seem to have had a sufficiently generous spirit to make the\r\nidea _work_, while all your modern communists only make themselves\r\nridiculous whenever they attempt it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed aloud, and said that he wouldn’t say another word against\r\nthe Apostles, if I would admit that they were socialists. They\r\ncertainly were not aristocrats. “But,” he complained, “that does not\r\nmake them infallible guides, by a long shot. I want you to answer my\r\narguments against the infallibility of the Bible, if you can.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to,” I said; “it is not at all necessary. Suppose\r\nyou can detect a few inconsistencies, misquotations, and puzzling\r\nexpressions in the New Testament. The books have come a long journey\r\nbetween them and us, and have passed through various hands. Wouldn’t\r\nit be strange if there were not some things knocked out of them and\r\na few tacked on? You know there are three biographies of Christ,\r\nwritten by different persons, among whom you cannot find any evidence\r\nof conspiracy or collusion, while there is much to the contrary. Yet\r\nare they not consistent in every essential particular? I think they\r\nare; and I am convinced the writers meant to give an honest, fair,\r\nand correct account of what _He_ said and did within their personal\r\nknowledge. Now, when they report, as each of them frequently do, that\r\nhe took upon himself the authority and omniscience proper only to God,\r\nin instructing and governing them; when they make him declare that in\r\nthat life of his flesh was the Spirit of God manifest, they must have\r\nso understood him. He probably meant them to, and as he was a wise,\r\ngood, and true man, we can have reasonable faith that, in some fair and\r\nhonest understanding of the words, it was so. What if there is room for\r\nsome difference of opinion, as to the _precise_ meaning of language, so\r\nwritten in a narrative, two or three times translated, and that through\r\nheathen tongues, and God only knows how many times copied by humanly\r\nimperfect hands. I am willing you should understand it as seems, on\r\nthe whole and in sincerity, most natural to you. I say that I do not\r\nbelieve it will make any very essential difference in your idea of\r\nGod, but that you will still see him, through Christ, a God of eternal\r\nTruth, Justice, Love—a Father worthy of your deepest reverence and\r\naffection.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I did; and when you’ve done and said all, what good is it? But\r\nI tell you, you don’t convince me of the inspiration of the Bible.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t now undertake to convince you of it. If it does not appear\r\nevident to you on the face of it that it is an inspired production, I\r\ndon’t think I can bring you to it by argument. All I ask of you now\r\nis to look upon those three men, Matthew, Luke, and John, simply as\r\nhonest biographers. Suppose Hume, Gibbon, or Jared Sparks had described\r\nsuch a character, made such a character to appear in the life of some\r\nhistorical personage with regard to whom they had had facilities to be\r\nparticularly well informed, would you not respect, honor, love—yes, and\r\nworship—”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I’d worship nothing human.”\r\n\r\n“But you would worship divine qualities, and, so far as these go to\r\nmake up the character of a man, you would worship them in him—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the divine qualities, not the human.”\r\n\r\n“Not the human—purely human; nobody asks you to. But here is a man who,\r\nin all his actions for thirty years, you cannot suppose to have been\r\ngoverned by any motives inconsistent with justice, magnanimity, and\r\nbenevolence. His life is described with a good deal of minute detail,\r\nbut you cannot find that he ever said, or thought, or did a single\r\nmean, unmanly, ungentlemanly thing. A man who avoided kingly honors;\r\nwho did not labor for riches; who neither sought nor avoided the\r\nluxuries of life; who endured to be forsaken of his friends; who put\r\nup with contempt, reproach, and ridicule; who was always going about\r\ndoing good, without either ostentation or secrecy—a man so great and\r\ntrue, as he appears among the pettifogging saints of the day, in the\r\ncase of the adulterous woman, or at the picking of corn on the Sabbath,\r\nor in his ideas of morality as brought out in his sermon on the mount,\r\nso simple, so grand, so truly divine—do you think, can you think—that\r\nsuch a man would be mean enough and wicked enough to declare a most\r\nmonstrous falsehood, and stick to it all his life, suffer all sorts of\r\nshame, and finally die ignominiously rather than give it up? No, sir;\r\nthat man was no impostor!... Nor is there any thing that looks like\r\nthe fanatic or crazy man about him either. Yet he plainly thought, and\r\nhad some good reason for thinking, that in all his peculiar character\r\nhe was exhibiting the peculiar qualities of God. And were not those\r\nqualities such as are consistent with the highest wisdom that we can\r\nconceive of? And what _good_, you were asking, does it do us to believe\r\nin them? If you had never seen your father, but your elder brother\r\nshould say: ‘Father is like me in all that you like in me, in all that\r\nyou love me for’—you would not need to see your father face to face,\r\nbut would love him, and would lovingly respond to his will, and when he\r\nsent for you to come home, you would look forward to meeting him, not\r\nwith dread, but with a joyful trust. If you can have as much faith in\r\nthe word of that noble man as I have in yours and the captain’s about\r\nthis ship’s going towards Liverpool, you will love and worship him, and\r\nstrive to be like him.”\r\n\r\n“Christ said he _was_ God, which is nonsense, and I don’t swallow it.”\r\n\r\n“Look here! When I tell you that I am a man, what do I mean? A man\r\nhas two legs, two arms, and two eyes; suppose I had but one leg, one\r\narm, and one eye, would it be nonsense to call me a man? Or suppose\r\nthat I had twelve fingers instead of ten, or my body all covered with\r\nhair, would it be nonsense to call me a man because I had more than\r\nthe ordinary qualities of a man? I might call myself a hirsute, but I\r\nshould still be a man.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean that because Jesus Christ asserted himself to be God it\r\ndoes not follow that he asserted himself nothing but God, or even that\r\nhe exhibited the whole of God, but that he spoke in the name of God,\r\nwith the authority of God, that the word of God was spoken in him. It\r\nis absurd for us, and evidently was never intended that we should, take\r\nthe exact weight and measure of the words of his familiar conversation,\r\nand reduce it to the English standard, from the simple narratives of\r\nHebrews writing in the Greek tongue. You can understand it so as to\r\nmake it nonsense if you are determined to, but that’s your nonsense and\r\nnot Christ’s. There is plenty of room to fight over it if you like,\r\nbut was that what it was intended for? You may understand it somewhat\r\ndifferently from me, but _practically_, if you believe it at all, will\r\nthe difference in our understanding of it make an essential difference\r\nin our lives? I believe that Channing and Calvin, standing at two\r\nopposite theoretical extremes with regard to this, both showed in their\r\ncharacters the influence of a common faith in the divinity of Christ.”\r\n\r\n“You do? You don’t suppose Channing believed in the divinity of Christ?\r\nYou ought to know better than that.”\r\n\r\n“He might not express his belief in that way, because that mind had\r\ngot to be employed technically to denote a different view from his,\r\nbut plainly it was the God revealed in Christ to whose service he gave\r\nhis life. You must remember that language is a human and exceedingly\r\nimperfect and inefficient means of conveying thought. Neither Calvin\r\nnor Channing believed that in Christ was the whole of God concentrated\r\nand made manifest to us, or that God was and could be revealed to us in\r\nno other way; but both believed that in Christ God was speaking, that\r\nin Christ’s life, far more truly and distinctly than in any other, was\r\nuttered the true and eternal and soul-saving word of God. ‘In truth, in\r\nlove, in all that deserves your love, your gratitude, your adoration,\r\nand whole-hearted devotion, I AM.’”\r\n\r\nWe were both silent for a few moments, and then he laughed.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” said I.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid you are getting into the bond of iniquity; don’t you know\r\nthat’s very dangerous the way you talk. ’Tisn’t orthodox by a long\r\nshot.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no particular passion for being called orthodox,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t, eh? What is your religion then?”\r\n\r\n“That of Christ, I wish it to be.”\r\n\r\n“No, but what do you believe in?”\r\n\r\n“The God revealed in Christ.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! What sect—what church do you run with?”\r\n\r\n“None of your business—that is, the question’s not in order.”\r\n\r\n“But, good heavens, man! I want to know what you pretend to believe.\r\nWhat do you want to have me believe? Was he very God of very God, all\r\nGod and all man, or only half God and half man, or a whole man and no\r\nGod, only an extra-inspired prophet, or what? There’s no use talking\r\nwith you till I know where you stand.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want to bother with such nonsense for? Christians\r\nthemselves don’t agree about those matters. I won’t answer you. You\r\nadmitted that you had seen enough in the ordinary works of God to\r\nimpress you with the belief of a designing wisdom above us, and you\r\nasked me how any one could know any more than that. Now I tell you:\r\nLook to Christ, his most perfect work. Believe, if you like, that in\r\nhim—his life—God is manifest only in the same way that he is in all\r\nthe works of his hand, as you would be in yours, as Powers is in the\r\nGreek Slave, and Bell and Brown are in this ship, only he must be\r\npeculiarly manifest in man (created in his image), and most distinctly\r\nand obviously manifest in the man most perfect and altogether lovely,\r\nthe express image of his person. Mustn’t he? Take him as a sheer man,\r\nif you will, not even a prophet, simply a wise man—the wisest and best\r\nman. Must not his pure heart, his self-forgetful spirit, his wisdom who\r\nspake as never man else spake, have attained to the best and truest\r\nidea of God? Must not that be, in the first place, the most reasonable\r\nrelation for us to assume towards God—that in which he placed himself—a\r\nson to a loving, personally-interested father—a Father whose almighty\r\npower moves only in love? If that’s the utmost you can make out of\r\nthe life of Christ, why, take that; don’t lose so much good of it\r\nbecause others can take more. But if you can take more than that, and\r\nit’s better for you to call him—what is it you say? ‘very God of very\r\nGod?’—not merely seen as manifested in the man Christ, but peculiarly,\r\nindescribably, incomprehensibly, and contradictorily both God and man\r\nand neither man or God—have it so, and welcome. Describe him in Latin,\r\nor Hebrew-Greek, if you like it better than plain English. It may seem\r\none thing in the dim, religious light of worship, and another in the\r\nflickering lamplight of study, but you will find both the same in the\r\nclear daylight of life. After all, it is the Word that is wanted, and\r\nnot the image through which it is spoken. Look at Christ in whatever\r\nway you can read that Word with the most faith. I care not in what\r\nlanguage you receive it, so you can translate it into love, joy, faith,\r\nlong-suffering, goodness, peace, meekness, and temperance (the fruits\r\nof the Spirit).” He was laughing again and I asked, “What is there\r\nridiculous about this, Mr. C.?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I don’t know as there’s any thing—don’t know as I can object to\r\nit, only—eh, ha! ha!”\r\n\r\n“Only what?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think if your minister heard you talking so, he’d\r\nbe—rather—hauling you over the coals, eh?”\r\n\r\n“My minister! What under the sun has my minister got to do with it? I\r\nam not a Roman Catholic.”\r\n\r\n“What the devil are you, any how?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve told you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you arn’t what I call a Christian. What do you call me an\r\ninfidel for?”\r\n\r\n“I never called you an infidel; infidel means unfaithful. God only\r\nknows whether you are unfaithful to your light or not. That’s none of\r\n_my_ business.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but now do you believe in fore-ordination and total depravity?\r\nDo you hold to salvation by grace?”\r\n\r\n“I believe, certainly, that if a man is not saved it is because, as\r\nChrist said, he ‘_would not_.’ I believe that every man shall be judged\r\naccording to his works, and so did Christ—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you don’t go those doctrines. Now—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to discuss them with you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you can’t believe them—it’s inconsistent.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t much think it is, but if it was—”\r\n\r\n“What’s that striking—eight bells? I declare it’s twelve o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit, let me tell you a story, and then we will turn in. I\r\nonce fell in with an old Quaker. He was the first one I ever met to\r\nconverse with: a simple-hearted, honest man, and I was glad of a chance\r\nto talk with him about his society. He finally spoke of some of their\r\ndoctrines, and defended them in a sensible, manly way that I liked.\r\nHe took up a Bible and showed me how some idea of his that I doubted\r\nabout was sustained in it. I turned over a leaf or two further, and\r\nshowed him another passage that I thought pretty flatly opposed his\r\nunderstanding of the verse he had brought as proof, and said, ‘What\r\ndo you make of that?’ He looked at it a moment, read each side of it,\r\ndidn’t say any thing, shook his head, and sighed, and I began to feel\r\nashamed of myself for troubling him with it. At length his face lighted\r\nup, and he turned to me with a beautiful smile and said softly, ‘I can\r\nsee the truth the Lord testified to in the verse I showed thee, but for\r\nthis I have not yet sight enough. If thee cannot yet see the truth that\r\ncometh to me from the verse I showed thee, wilt thee not be content to\r\nalso wait for thy light?’ Now, Mr. C., I advise you to take what truth\r\nyou can find; and if other people profess to believe what seems to you\r\nabsurdities, don’t be so sorry for them as not to let them enjoy the\r\nbenefit of what light they have got; don’t yourself be so foolish as\r\nto shut your eyes to what of God’s word is plainly enough set before\r\nyou in Christ, because you have not turned over the next page and\r\ncan’t see through the whole book at once. I don’t want you to try to\r\nforce upon yourself any belief that is unnatural, and which honestly\r\nappears illogical to you. No kind of heresy is so bad as hypocrisy.\r\nI think those Christians were exceedingly wrong that felt that the\r\nsacredness and chief power of their religion consisted so much in the\r\ndoctrines which they had agreed together to stand by, that they must\r\nsummarily exclude you from their fellowship when you began to question\r\nthe soundness of them. On the other hand, I must tell you that I think\r\nyou are equally wrong to hold them and their opinions in contempt, and\r\nto have such entire confidence, as you seem to, that you are yourself\r\nright. The fact that so many men differ with you, whom you cannot help\r\nrespecting as having equal powers of mind and equally good spirit with\r\nyourself, should at least make you hold your opinions with humility.”\r\n\r\n“Well! Now let’s go and see them heave the log. She’s going a bit\r\nfaster; the fog isn’t so thick as ’twas either. Hallo! there’s that old\r\nIrishwoman again. She always gets in behind the harness cask to say her\r\nprayers. You will hear her muttering there for two or three hours every\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“She must have strong faith.”\r\n\r\n“Faith in the devil! Fear and ignorance, I call it. She’s a good old\r\nthing though, I must say. She takes care of that sick woman’s child as\r\nif it were her own; and last night she asked the doctor to let her darn\r\nhis stockings, and he did, the conceited old dandy.”\r\n\r\n“She has a good deal of true religion, then, for all her ignorance and\r\nfear.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s true religion to believe in the Pope and the Virgin Mary!”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! oh no! ‘True religion before God is this: to visit the widows\r\nand fatherless in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted in\r\nthe world.’ Yet it may be worth your while, Mr. C., to consider whether\r\nshe would have been as likely to pity that sick mother, and take care\r\nof her child, if she hadn’t been in the habit of praying in this way\r\nevery night, although in her ignorance she addresses the mother of\r\nChrist instead of the Father. Good-night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the disposition of the people of England towards the\r\nUnited States was written before, and not in anticipation of the\r\ncoming of Kossuth to this country. The general discussion of the\r\nsubject which that event has occasioned makes it proper for me to\r\nmention this. Opinions opposing the views I have presented having\r\nbeen expressed by several persons in honorable positions, for one at\r\nleast of whom I entertain the highest respect, I wish to repeat that,\r\nduring five months that I travelled in Great Britain, in almost every\r\nday of which time I heard the United States talked about with every\r\nappearance of candor and honesty, I do not recollect ever to have heard\r\nany expression of hostile feeling (except from a few physical-force\r\nChartists, with regard to slavery) towards our government or our\r\npeople, and only from a few stanch church-and-state men against our\r\nprinciples of government. Perhaps the highest eulogy on Washington\r\never put in words was written by Lord Brougham. The Duke of Wellington\r\nlately took part in a banquet in honour of American independence. I\r\nmyself attended a Fourth-of-July dinner in an old palace of George\r\nIII., and saw there a member of Parliament, and other distinguished\r\nEnglishmen, drink to the memory of Washington, and in honour of the\r\nday. Having observed that Mr. Howard was threatened with a mob, for\r\nkeeping an English ensign flying from a corner of the Irving House, I\r\nwill add that I more than once saw the American ensign so displayed in\r\nEngland, without exciting remark; and I know one gentleman living in\r\nthe country who regularly sets it over his house on the Fourth of July,\r\nand salutes it with gun-firing and festivities, so that the day is well\r\nknown, and kindly regarded by all his neighbours, as “the American\r\nholiday.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations.
