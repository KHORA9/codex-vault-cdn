Whether a bird is injurious or beneficial depends\r\nalmost entirely upon what it eats, and in the case of species which are\r\nunusually abundant or which depend in part upon the farmer's crops for\r\nsubsistence the character of the food often becomes a very practical\r\nquestion. If crows or blackbirds are seen in numbers about cornfields,\r\nor if woodpeckers are noticed at work in an orchard, it is perhaps not\r\nsurprising that they are accused of doing harm. Careful investigation,\r\nhowever, often shows that they are actually destroying noxious insects,\r\nand also that even those which do harm at one season may compensate\r\nfor it by eating noxious species at another. Insects are eaten at all\r\ntimes by the majority of land birds, and during the breeding season most\r\nkinds subsist largely and rear their young exclusively on this food.\r\nWhen insects are unusually plentiful, they are eaten by many birds which\r\nordinarily do not touch them. Even birds of prey resort to this diet, and\r\nwhen insects are more easily obtained than other fare, the smaller hawks\r\nand owls live on them almost entirely. This was well illustrated during\r\nthe recent plague of Rocky Mountain locusts in the Western States, when it\r\nwas found that locusts were eaten by nearly every bird in the region, and\r\nthat they formed almost the entire food of a large majority of the species.\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits, birds feed upon the kind of food that is most\r\naccessible. Thus, as a rule, insectivorous birds eat the insects that\r\nare most easily obtained, provided they do not have some peculiarly\r\ndisagreeable property. It is not probable that a bird habitually passes by\r\none kind of insect to look for another which is more appetizing, and there\r\nseems little evidence in support of the theory that tire selection of\r\nfood is restricted to any particular species of insect, for it is evident\r\nthat a bird eats those which by its own method of seeking are most easily\r\nobtained. Thus, a ground-feeding bird eats those it finds among the dead\r\nleaves and grass; a flycatcher, watching for its prey from some vantage\r\npoint, captures entirely different kinds; and the woodpecker and warbler,\r\nin the tree tops, select still others. It is thus apparent that a bird's\r\ndiet is likely to be quite varied, and to differ at different seasons of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nIn investigating the food habits of birds, field observation can be relied\r\non only to a limited extent, for it is not always easy to determine what\r\na bird really eats by watching it. In order to be positive on this point,\r\nit is necessary to examine the stomach contents. When birds are suspected\r\nof doing injury to field crops or fruit trees, a few individuals should be\r\nshot and their stomachs examined. This will show unmistakably whether or\r\nnot the birds are guilty.\r\n\r\nIn response to a general demand for definite information regarding the\r\nfood habits of our native birds, the biological Survey of the Department\r\nof Agriculture has for some years past been conducting a systematic\r\ninvestigation of the food of species which are believed to be of economic\r\nimportance. Thousands of birds' stomachs have been carefully examined in\r\nthe laboratory, and all the available data respecting the food brought\r\ntogether. The results of the investigations relating to birds of prey,\r\nbased on an examination of nearly 3,000 stomachs, were published in 1893,\r\nin a special bulletin entitled The Hawks and Owls of the United States.\r\nMany other species have been similarly studied and the results published,\r\neither in special bulletins or as articles in the yearbooks. The present\r\nbulletin contains brief abstracts of the results of food studies of about\r\n30 grain and insect eating birds belonging to 10 different families.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The limits of this bulletin preclude giving more than a very brief\r\nstatement regarding the food of each bird, but more detailed accounts\r\nof some of the species will be found in the following reports of the\r\nBiological Survey (formerly Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy): The\r\nCuckoos--Bulletin No. 9, 1898, pp. 1-14; Crow--Bulletin No. 6, 1895,\r\npp. 1-98; Woodpeckers--Bulletin No. 7, 1895, pp. 1-39; Kingbird--Annual\r\nReport Secretary of Agriculture for 1893, pp. 233-234; Redwinged\r\nBlackbird--Yearbook for 1897, pp. 349-351; Baltimore Oriole--Yearbook\r\nfor 1895, pp. 426-430; Grackles--Yearbook for 1894, pp. 233-248;\r\nMeadowlark--Yearbook for 1895, pp. 420-426; Cedarbird--Annual Report\r\nSecretary of Agriculture for 1892, pp. 197-200; Catbird, Brown Thrasher,\r\nand Wren--Yearbook for 1895, pp. 405-418.\r\n\r\nThese species comprise among others the crow blackbirds and ricebirds,\r\nagainst which serious complaints have been made on account of the damage\r\nthey do to corn, wheat, rice, and other crops; and also the cuckoos,\r\ngrosbeaks, and thrashers, which are generally admitted to be beneficial,\r\nbut whose true value as insect destroyers has not been fully appreciated.\r\nThe practical value of birds in controlling insect pests should be more\r\ngenerally recognized. It maybe an easy matter to exterminate the birds\r\nin an orchard or grain field, but it is an extremely difficult one to\r\ncontrol the insect pests. It is, certain, too, that the value of our\r\nnative sparrows as weed destroyers is not appreciated. Weed seed forms\r\nan important item of the winter food of many of these birds, and it is\r\nimpossible to estimate the immense numbers of noxious weeds which are thus\r\nannually destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf birds are protected and encouraged to nest about the farm and garden,\r\nthey will do their share in destroying noxious insects and weeds, and a\r\nfew hours spent in putting up boxes for bluebirds, martins, and wrens will\r\nprove a good investment. Birds are protected by law in many States, but\r\nit remains for the agriculturalists to see that the laws are faithfully\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUCKOOS.\r\n\r\n(_Coccyzus americanus and C. erythophthalmus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo species of cuckoos, the yellow-billed (fig. 1) and the black-billed,\r\nare common in the United States east of the Plains, and a subspecies of\r\nthe yellow-billed extends westward to the Pacific. While the two species\r\nare quite distinct, they do not differ greatly in food habits, and their\r\neconomic status is practically the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Yellow-billed cuckoo.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of 155 stomachs has shown that these cuckoos are much\r\ngiven to eating caterpillars, and, unlike most birds, do not reject those\r\ncovered with hair. In fact, cuckoos eat so many hairy caterpillars that\r\nthe hairs pierce the inner lining of the stomach and remain there, so that\r\nwhen the stomach is opened and turned inside out, it appears to be lined\r\nwith a thin coating of fur.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the stomachs of 40 black-billed cuckoos, taken during\r\nthe summer months, showed the remains of 900 caterpillars, 44 beetles,\r\n96 grasshoppers, 100 sawflies, 30 stink bugs, and 15 spiders. In all\r\nprobability more individuals than these were represented, but their\r\nremains were too badly broken for recognition. Most of the caterpillars\r\nwere hairy, and many of them belonged to a genus that lives in colonies\r\nand feeds on the leaves of trees, including the apple tree. One stomach\r\nwas filled with larvæ of a caterpillar belonging to the same genus as the\r\ntent caterpillar, while others contained that species. Other larvæ were\r\nthose of large moths, for which the bird seems to have a special fondness.\r\nThe beetles were mainly click beetles and weevils, with a few May beetles.\r\nThe sawflies were all found in two stomachs, one of which contained no\r\nless than 100 in the larval stage.\r\n\r\nOf the yellow-billed cuckoo, 109 stomachs (collected from May to October,\r\ninclusive) were examined. The contents consisted of 1,865 caterpillars, 93\r\nbeetles, 242 grasshoppers, 37 sawflies, 69 bugs, 6 flies, and 86 spiders.\r\nMost of the caterpillars belonged to hairy species and many of them were\r\nof large size. One stomach contained 250 American tent caterpillars;\r\nanother 217 fall webworms. In places where tent caterpillars are abundant\r\nthey seem to constitute a large portion of the food of these two birds.\r\nThe beetles were distributed among several families, but all more or less\r\nharmful to agriculture. In the same stomach which contained the tent\r\ncaterpillars were two Colorado potato beetles; in another were three\r\ngoldsmith beetles and remains of several other large beetles. Besides\r\ngrasshoppers were several katydids and tree crickets. The sawflies were\r\nin the larval stage, in which they resemble caterpillars so closely that\r\nthey are commonly called false caterpillars, and perhaps this likeness may\r\nbe the reason the cuckoos eat them so freely. The bugs consisted of stink\r\nbugs and cicadas or dog-day harvest flies, with the single exception of\r\none wheel bug, which was the only useful insect eaten, unless the spiders\r\nbe counted as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOODPECKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive or six species of woodpeckers are familiarly known throughout the\r\neastern United States, and in the west are replaced by others of similar\r\nhabits. Several species remain in the northern States through the entire\r\nyear, while others are more or less migratory.\r\n\r\nFarmers are prone to look upon woodpeckers with suspicion. When the birds\r\nare seen scrambling over fruit trees and pecking at the bark, and fresh\r\nholes are found in the tree, it is concluded that they are doing harm.\r\nCareful observers, however, have noticed that, excepting a single species,\r\nthese birds rarely leave any important mark on a healthy tree, but that\r\nwhen a tree is affected by wood-boring larvæ the Insects are accurately\r\nlocated, dislodged, and devoured. In case the holes from which the borers\r\nare taken are afterwards occupied by colonies of ants, these ants in turn\r\nare drawn out and eaten.\r\n\r\nTwo of the best known woodpeckers, the hairy woodpecker (_Dryobates\r\nvillosus_) (fig. 2) and the downy woodpecker (_D. pubescens_), including\r\ntheir races, range over the greater part of the United States, and for the\r\nmost part remain throughout the year in their usual haunts. They differ\r\nchiefly in size, for their colors are practically the same, and the males,\r\nlike other woodpeckers, are distinguished by a scarlet patch on the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Hairy woodpecker.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of many stomachs of these two birds shows that from\r\ntwo-thirds to three-fourths of the food consists of insects, chiefly\r\nnoxious. Wood-boring beetles, both adults and larvæ, are conspicuous, and\r\nwith them are associated many caterpillars, mostly species that burrow\r\ninto trees. Next in importance are the ants that live in decaying wood,\r\nall of which are sought by woodpeckers and eaten in great quantities. Many\r\nants are particularly harmful to limber, for if they find a small spot of\r\ndecay in the vacant burrow of some wood-borer, they enlarge the hole, and\r\nas their colony is always on the increase, continue to eat away the wood\r\nuntil the whole trunk is honey-combed. Moreover, these insects are not\r\naccessible to other birds, and could pursue their career of destruction\r\nunmolested were it not that the woodpeckers, with beaks and tongues\r\nespecially fitted for such work, dig out and devour them. It is thus\r\nevident that woodpeckers are great conservators of forests. To them, more\r\nthan to any other agency, we owe the preservation of timber from hordes of\r\ndestructive insects.\r\n\r\nOne of the larger woodpeckers familiar to everyone is the flicker, or\r\ngolden-winged woodpecker (_Colaptes auratus_) (fig. 3), which is generally\r\ndistributed throughout the United States from the Atlantic Coast to the\r\nRocky Mountain. It is there replaced by the red-shafted flicker (_C.\r\ncafer_), which extends westward to the Pacific. The two species are as\r\nnearly identical in food habits as their environment will allow. The\r\nflickers, while genuine woodpeckers, differ somewhat in habits from the\r\nrest of the family, and are frequently seen upon the ground searching\r\nfor food. Like the downy and hairy woodpeckers, they eat wood-boring\r\ngrubs and ants, but the number of ants eaten is much greater. Two of the\r\nflickers' stomachs examined were completely filled with ants, each stomach\r\ncontaining more than 3,000 individuals. These ants belonged to species\r\nwhich live in the ground, and it is these insects for which the flicker is\r\nsearching when running about in the grass, although some grasshoppers are\r\nalso taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Flicker.]\r\n\r\nThe red-headed woodpecker (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_) (fig. 4) is well\r\nknown east of the Rocky Mountains, but is rather rare in New England.\r\nUnlike some of the other species, it prefers fence posts and telegraph\r\npoles to trees as a foraging ground. Its food therefore naturally differs\r\nfrom that of the preceding species, and consists largely of adult beetles\r\nand wasps, which it frequently captures on the wing, after the fashion\r\nof flycatchers. Grasshoppers also form an important part of the food.\r\nThe red-head has a peculiar habit of selecting very large beetles, as\r\nshown by the presence of fragments of several of the largest species in\r\nthe stomachs. Among the beetles were quite a number of predaceous ground\r\nbeetles, and unfortunately some tiger beetles, which are useful insects.\r\nThe red-head has been accused of robbing the nests of other birds; also\r\nof attacking young birds and poultry and peeking out their brains, but\r\nas the stomachs showed little evidence to substantiate this charge it is\r\nprobable that the habit is rather exceptional.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Red-headed woodpecker.]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to speak of the smaller woodpeckers as \"sapsuckers,\"\r\nunder the belief that they drill holes in the bark of trees for the\r\npurpose of drinking the sap and eating the inner bark. Close observation,\r\nhowever, has fixed this habit upon only one species, the yellow-bellied\r\nwoodpecker, or sapsucker (_Sphyrapicus varius_) (fig. 5). This bird has\r\nbeen shown to be guilty of pecking holes in the bark of various forest\r\ntrees, and sometimes in that of apple trees, from which it drinks the sap\r\nwhen the pits become filled. It has been proved, however, that besides\r\ntaking the gap the bird captures large numbers of insects which are\r\nattracted by the sweet fluid, and that these form a very considerable\r\nportion of its diet. In some cases the trees are injured by being thus\r\npunctured, and die in a year or two, but since comparatively few are\r\ntouched the damage is not great. It is equally probable, moreover, that\r\nthe bird fully compensates for this injury by the insects it consumes.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of woodpeckers is varied, but consists largely of small\r\nfruits and berries. The downy and hairy woodpeckers eat such fruits as\r\ndogwood, Virginia creeper, and others, with the seeds of poison ivy,\r\nsumac, and a few other shrubs. The flicker also eats a great many small\r\nfruits and the seeds of a considerable number of shrubs and weeds. None of\r\nthe three species is much given to eating cultivated fruits or crops.\r\n\r\nThe red-head has been accused of eating the larger kinds of fruit, such\r\nas apples, and also of taking considerable corn. The stomach examinations\r\nshow that to some extent these charges are substantiated but that the\r\nhabit is not prevalent enough to cause much damage. It is quite fond of\r\nmast, especially beechnuts, and when these nuts are plentiful the birds\r\nremain north all winter, instead of migrating as is their usual custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Yellow-bellied woodpecker.]\r\n\r\nHalf the food of the sapsucker, aside from sap, consists of vegetable\r\nmatter, largely berries of the kinds already mentioned, and also a\r\nquantity of the inner bark of trees, more of which is eaten by this\r\nspecies than by any other.\r\n\r\nMany other woodpeckers are found in America, but their food habits agree\r\nin the main with those just described. Those birds are certainly the only\r\nagents which can successfully cope with certain insect enemies of the\r\nforests, and, to some extent, of fruit trees also. For this reason, if for\r\nno other, they should be protected in every possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINGBIRD\r\n\r\n(_Tyrannus tyrannus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingbird (fig. 6) Is essentially a lover of the orchard, and wherever\r\nthe native groves have been replaced by fruit trees this pugnacious bird\r\ntakes up its abode. It breeds in all of the States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and less commonly in the Great Basin and on the Pacific Coast.\r\nIt migrates south early in the fall, and generally leaves the United\r\nStates to spend the winter in more southern latitudes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Kingbird.]\r\n\r\nThe kingbird manifests its presence in many ways. It is somewhat\r\nboisterous and obtrusive, and its antipathy for hawks and crows is well\r\nknown. It never hesitates to give battle to any of these marauders, no\r\nmatter, how superior in size, and for this reason a family of kingbirds is\r\na desirable adjunct to a poultry yard. On one occasion in the knowledge of\r\nthe writer a hawk which attacked a brood of young turkeys was pounced upon\r\nand so severely buffeted by a pair of kingbirds, whose nest was near by,\r\nthat the would-be robber was glad to escape without his prey. Song birds\r\nthat nest near the kingbird are similarly protected.\r\n\r\nIn its food habits this species is largely insectivorous. It is a true\r\nflycatcher by nature, and takes a large part of its food on the wing. It\r\ndoes not, however, confine itself to this method of hunting, but picks\r\nup some insects from trees and weeds, and even descends to the ground in\r\nsearch of myriapods or thousand legs. The chief complaint against the\r\nkingbird is that it preys largely upon honeybees; and this charge has been\r\nmade both by professional bee keepers and others. Many observers have seen\r\nthe bird at work near hives, and there is no reason to doubt the honesty\r\nof their testimony. One bee raiser in Iowa, suspecting the kingbirds of\r\nfeeding upon his bees, shot a number near his hives, but when the birds'\r\nstomachs were examined by an expert entomologist not a trace of honeybees\r\ncould be found.\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey has made an examination of 281 stomachs collected\r\nin various parts of the country, but found only 14 containing remains of\r\nhoneybees. In these 14 stomachs there were in all 50 honeybees, of which\r\n40 were drones, 4 were certainly workers, and the remaining 6 were too\r\nbadly broken to be identified as to sex.\r\n\r\nThe insects that constitute the great bulk of the food of this bird are\r\nnoxious species, largely beetles--May beetles, click beetles (the larvæ\r\nof which are known as wire worms), weevils, which prey upon fruit and\r\ngrain, and a host of others. Wasps, wild bees, and ants are conspicuous\r\nelements of the food, far outnumbering the hive bees. During summer\r\nmany grasshoppers and crickets, as well as leaf hoppers and other bugs,\r\nare also eaten. Among the flies were a number of robber flies--insects\r\nwhich prey largely upon other insects, especially honeybees, and which\r\nhave been known to commit in this way extensive depredations. It is thus\r\nevident that the kingbird by destroying these flies actually does good\r\nwork for the apiarist. Nineteen robber flies were found in the stomachs\r\nexamined; these may be considered more than an equivalent for the four\r\nworker honeybees already mentioned. A few caterpillars are eaten, mostly\r\nbelonging to the group commonly known as cutworms, all the species of\r\nwhich are harmful. About 10 per cent of the food consists of small native\r\nfruits, comprising some twenty common species of the roadsides and\r\nthickets, such as dogwood berries, elder berries and wild grapes. The\r\nbird has not been reported as eating cultivated fruit to an injurious\r\nextent, and it is very doubtful if this is ever the case, for cherries\r\nand blackberries are the only ones that might have come from cultivated\r\nplaces, and they were found in but few stomachs.\r\n\r\nThree points seem to be clearly established in regard to the food of the\r\nkingbird--(1) that about 90 per cent consists of insects, mostly injurious\r\nspecies; (2) that the alleged habit of preying upon honeybees is much less\r\nprevalent than has been supposed, and probably does not result in any\r\ngreat damage; and (3) that the vegetable food consists almost entirely of\r\nwild fruits which have no economic value. These facts, taken in connection\r\nwith its well-known enmity for hawks and crows, entitle the kingbird to a\r\nplace among the most desirable birds of the orchard or garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHŒBE.\r\n\r\n(_Sayornis phœbe._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the early spring arrivals at the North, none more welcome than the\r\nphœbe (fig. 7). Though, naturally building its nest under an overhanging\r\ncliff of rock or earth, or in the mouth of a cave, its preference for the\r\nvicinity of farm buildings is so marked that in the more thickly settled\r\nparts of the country the bird is seldom seen at any great distance from a\r\nfarmhouse except where a bridge spans some stream, affording a secure spot\r\nfor a nest. Its confiding disposition has rendered it a great favorite,\r\nand consequently it is seldom disturbed. It breeds throughout the United\r\nStates east of the Great Plains, and winters from the South Atlantic and\r\nGulf States southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Phœbe.]\r\n\r\nThe phœbe subsists almost exclusively upon insects, most of which are\r\ncaught upon the wing. An examination of 80 stomachs showed that over 93\r\nper cent of the year's food consists of insects and spiders, while wild\r\nfruit constitutes the remainder. The insects belong chiefly to noxious,\r\nspecies, and include many click beetles. May beetles, and weevils.\r\nGrasshoppers in their season are eaten to a considerable extent, while\r\nwasps of various species, many flies of species that annoy cattle, and a\r\nfew bugs and spiders are also eaten regularly. It is evident that a pair\r\nof phœbes must materially reduce the number of insects near a garden or\r\nfield, as the birds often, if not always, raise two broods a year, and\r\neach brood numbers from four to six young.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable portion of the food is unimportant, and consists mainly of a\r\nfew seeds, with small fruits, such as wild cherries, elder berries, and\r\njuniper berries. The raspberries and blackberries found in the stomachs\r\nwere the only fruits that might have banged to cultivated varieties, and\r\nthe quantity was trifling.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a more useful species than the phœbe about the farm,\r\nand it should receive every encouragement. To furnish nesting boxes is\r\nunnecessary, as it usually prefers a more open situation, like a shed, or\r\na nook under the eaves, but it should be protected from cats and other\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE JAY.\r\n\r\n(_Cyanocitta cristata._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue jay (fig. 8) is a common bird of the United States east of the\r\nGreat Plains, and remains throughout the year in most of its range,\r\nalthough its numbers are somewhat reduced in winter in the Northern\r\nStates. During spring and summer the jay is forced to become an\r\nindustrious hunter for insects, and is not so conspicuous a feature of\r\nthe landscape as when it roams the country at will after the cares of the\r\nnesting season are over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Blue Jay.]\r\n\r\nOrnithologists and field observers in general declare that a considerable\r\nportion of its food in spring and early summer consists of the eggs and\r\nyoung of small birds, and some farmers accuse it of stealing corn to an\r\ninjurious extent in the fall. While there may be some truth in these\r\naccusations, they have almost certainly been exaggerated. No doubt many\r\njays have been observed robbing nests of other birds, but thousands have\r\nbeen seen that were not so engaged.\r\n\r\nIn an investigation of the food of the blue jay 292 stomachs were\r\nexamined, which showed that animal matter comprised 24 per cent and\r\nvegetable matter 70 per cent of the bird's diet. So much has been said\r\nabout the nest robbing habits of the jay that special search was made\r\nfor traces of birds or birds' eggs in the stomachs, with the result that\r\nshells of small birds' eggs were found in three and the remains of young\r\nbirds in only two stomachs. Such negative evidence is not sufficient to\r\ncontrovert the great mass of testimony upon this point, but it shows that\r\nthe habit is not so prevalent as has been believed. Besides birds and\r\ntheir eggs, the jay eats mice, fish, salamanders, snails, and crustaceans,\r\nwhich altogether constitute but little more than 1 per cent of its diet.\r\nThe insect food is made up of beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and\r\na few species of other orders, all noxious, except some 3½ per cent of\r\npredaceous beetles. Thus something more than 19 per cent of the whole food\r\nconsists of harmful insects. In August the jay, like many other birds,\r\nturns its attention to grasshoppers, which constitute nearly one-fifth of\r\nits food during that month. At this time, also, most of the other noxious\r\ninsects, including caterpillars, are consumed, though beetles are eaten\r\nchiefly in spring.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food is quite varied, but the item of most interest is\r\ngrain. Corn was found in 70 stomachs, wheat in 8, and oats in 2--all\r\nconstituting 19 per cent of the total food. Corn is evidently the favorite\r\ngrain, but a closer inspection of the record shows that the greater part\r\nwas eaten during the first five months of the year, and that very little\r\nwas taken after May, even in harvest time, when it is abundant. This\r\nindicates that most of the corn is gleaned from the fields after harvest,\r\nexcept what is stolen from cribs or gathered in May at planting time.\r\n\r\nThe jay's favorite food is mast (i. e., acorns, chestnuts, chinquapins,\r\netc.), which was found in 158 of the 292 stomachs and amounted to more\r\nthan 42 per cent of the whole food. In September corn formed 15 and mast\r\n35 per cent, while in October, November, and December corn dropped to\r\nan almost inappreciable quantity and mast amounted to 64, 82, and 83\r\nper cent, respectively. And yet in these months corn is abundant and\r\neverywhere easily accessible. The other elements of food consist of a few\r\nseeds and wild fruits, among which grapes and blackberries predominate.\r\n\r\nThe results of the stomach examination show, (1) that the jay eats many\r\nnoxious insects; (2) that its habit of robbing the nests of other birds is\r\nmuch less common, than has been asserted; and (3) that it does little harm\r\nto agriculture, since all but a small amount of the corn eaten is waste\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROW.\r\n\r\n(_Corvus americanus._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few birds so well known as the common crow, and unlike most\r\nother species he does not seem to decrease in numbers as the country\r\nbecomes more densely populated. The crow is commonly regarded as a\r\nblackleg and a thief. Without the dash and brilliancy of the jay, or the\r\nbold savagery of the hawk, he is accused of doing more mischief than\r\neither. That he does pull up sprouting corn, destroy chickens, and rob the\r\nnests of small birds has been repeatedly proved. Nor are these all of his\r\nsins. He is known to eat frogs, toads, salamanders, and some small snakes,\r\nall harmless creatures that do some good by eating insects. With so many\r\ncharges against him, it may be well to show why he should not be utterly\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nThe examination of a large number of stomachs, while confirming all the\r\nforegoing accusations, has thrown upon the subject a light somewhat\r\ndifferent from that derived slowly from field observation. It shows that\r\nthe bird's nesting habit, as in the case of the jay, is not so universal\r\nas has been supposed; and that, so far from being a habitual nest robber,\r\nthe crow only occasionally indulges in that reprehensible practice. The\r\nsame is true in regard to destroying chickens, for he is able to carry off\r\nnone but very young ones, and his opportunities for capturing them are\r\nsomewhat limited. Neither are many toads and frogs eaten, and as frogs are\r\nof no great practical value, their destruction is not a serious matter;\r\nbut toads are very useful, and their consumption, so far as it goes, must\r\nbe counted against crow. Turtles, crayfishes, and snails, of which he eats\r\nquite a large number, may be considered neutral, while mice may be counted\r\nto his credit.\r\n\r\nIn his insect food, however, the crow makes amends for sins in the rest of\r\nhis dietary, although even here the first item is against him. Predaceous\r\nbeetles are eaten in some numbers throughout the season, but the number\r\nis not great. May beetles, \"dor-bugs,\" or June bugs, and others of the\r\nsame family, constitute the principal food during spring and early summer,\r\nand are fed to the young in immense quantities. Other beetles, nearly all\r\nof a noxious character, are eaten to a considerable extent. Grasshoppers\r\nare first taken in May, but not in large numbers until August, when, as\r\nmight be expected, they form the leading article of diet, showing that\r\nthe crow is no exception to the general rule that most birds subsist,\r\nto a large extent, upon grasshoppers in the month of August. Many bugs,\r\nsome caterpillars, mostly cutworms, and some spiders are also eaten--all\r\nof them either harmful or neutral in their economic relations. Of the\r\ninsect diet Mr. E. A. Schwarz says: \"The facts, on the whole, speak\r\noverwhelmingly in favor of the crow.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the most important item in the vegetable food is corn, and by\r\npulling up the newly sprouted seeds the bird renders himself extremely\r\nobnoxious. Observation and experiments with tame crows show that hard, dry\r\ncorn is never eaten if anything else is to be had, and if fed to nestlings\r\nit is soon disgorged. The reason crows resort to newly planted fields\r\nis that the kernels of corn are softened by the moisture of the earth,\r\nand probably become more palatable in the process of germination, which\r\nchanges the starch of the grain to sugar. The fact, however, remains that\r\ncrows eat corn extensively only when it has been softened by germination\r\nor partial decay, or before it is ripe and still \"in the milk.\" Experience\r\nhas shown that they may be prevented from pulling up young corn by\r\ntarring the seed, which not only saves corn but forces them to turn their\r\nattention to insects. If they persist in eating green corn it is not so\r\neasy to prevent the damage; but no details of extensive injury in this way\r\nhave yet been presented and it is probable that no great harm has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nCrows eat fruit to some extent, but confine themselves for the most part\r\nto wild species, such as dogwood, sour gum, and seeds of the different\r\nkinds of sumac. They have also a habit of sampling almost everything\r\nwhich appears eatable, especially when food is scarce. For example, they\r\neat frozen apples found on the trees in winter, or pumpkins, turnips,\r\nand potatoes which have been overlooked or neglected; even mushrooms are\r\nsometimes taken, probably in default of something better.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the economic status of the crow, it must be acknowledged\r\nthat he does some damage, but, on the other hand, he should receive much\r\ncredit for the insects which he destroys. In the more thickly settled\r\nparts of the country the crow probably does more good than harm, at\r\nleast when ordinary precautions are taken to protect young poultry and\r\nnewly-planted corn against his depredations. If, however, corn is planted\r\nwith no provision against possible marauders, if hens and turkeys are\r\nallowed to nest and to roam with their broods at a distance from farm\r\nbuildings, losses must be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOBOLINK, OR RICEBIRD.\r\n\r\n(_Dolichconyx oryzivorus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bobolink (fig. 9) is a common summer resident of the United States,\r\nnorth of about latitude 40°, and from New England westward to the Great\r\nPlains, wintering beyond our southern border. In New England there are few\r\nbirds, if any, around which so much romance has clustered; in the South\r\nnone on whose head so many maledictions have been heaped. The bobolink,\r\nentering the United States from the South at a time when the rice fields\r\nare freshly sown, pulls up the young plants and feeds upon the seed. Its\r\nstay, however, is not long, and it soon hastens northward, where it is\r\nwelcomed as a herald of summer. During its sojourn in the Northern States\r\nit feeds mainly upon insects and small seeds of useless plants; but while\r\nrearing its young, insects constitute its chief food, and almost the\r\nexclusive diet of its brood. After the young are able to fly, the whole\r\nfamily gathers into a small flock and begins to live almost entirely upon\r\nvegetable food. This consists for the most part of weed seeds, since in\r\nthe North these birds do not appear to molest grain to any great extent.\r\nThey eat a few oats, but their stomachs do not reveal a great quantity of\r\nthis or any other grain. As the season advances they gather into larger\r\nflocks and move southward, until by the end of August nearly all have\r\nleft their breeding grounds. On their way they frequent the reedy marshes\r\nabout the mouths of rivers and on the inland waters of the coast region,\r\nsubsisting largely upon wild rice. After leaving the Northern States they\r\nare commonly known as reed birds, and having become very fat are treated\r\nas game.\r\n\r\nThey begin to arrive on the rice fields in the latter part of August, and\r\nduring the next month make havoc in the ripening crop. It is unfortunate\r\nthat the rice districts lie exactly in the track of their fall migration,\r\nsince the abundant supply of food thus offered has undoubtedly served to\r\nattract them more and more, until most of the bobolinks bred in the North\r\nare concentrated with disastrous effect on the south east coast when the\r\nrice ripens in the fall, there was evidently a time when no such supply of\r\nfood awaited the birds on their journey southward, and it seems probable\r\nthat the introduction of rice culture in the South, combined with the\r\nclearing of the forests in the North, thus affording a larger available\r\nbreeding area, has favored an increase in the numbers of this species. The\r\nfood habits of the bobolink are not necessarily easily inimical to the\r\ninterests of agriculture. It simply happens that the rice affords a supply\r\nof food more easily obtainable than did the wild plants which formerly\r\noccupied the same region. Were the rice fields at a distance from the\r\nline of migration, or north of the bobolinks' breeding ground, they would\r\nprobably never be molested; but lying, as they do, directly in the path\r\nof migration, they form a recruiting ground, where the birds can rest and\r\naccumulate flesh and strength for the long sea flight which awaits them in\r\ntheir course to South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Bobolink.]\r\n\r\nThe annual loss to rice growers on account of bobolinks has been estimated\r\nat $2,000,000. In the face of such losses it is evident that no mere\r\npoetical sentiment should stand in the way of applying any remedy which\r\ncan be devised. It would be unsafe to assume that the insects which the\r\nbirds consume during their residence in the North can compensate for such\r\ndestruction. If these figures are any approximation to the truth, the\r\nordinary farmer will not believe that the bobolink benefits, the Northern\r\nhalf of the country nearly as much as it damages the Southern half, and\r\nthe thoughtful ornithologist will be inclined to agree with him. But even\r\nif the bird really does more harm than good, what is the remedy! For years\r\nthe rice planters have been employing men and boys to shoot the birds\r\nand drive them away from the fields, but in spite of the millions slain\r\nevery year their numbers do not decrease. In fact, a large part of the\r\nloss sustained is not in the grain which the birds actually eat, but in\r\nthe outlay necessary to prevent them from taking it all. At present there\r\nseems to be no effective remedy short of complete extermination of the\r\nspecies, and this is evidently impracticable even were it desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REDWINGED BLACKBIRD.\r\n\r\n(_Agelaius phœniceus._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe redwinged, or swamp, blackbird (fig. 10) is found all over the United\r\nStates and the region immediately to the north. While common in most of\r\nits range, its distribution is more or less local, mainly on account of\r\nits partiality for swamps. Its nest is built near standing water, in\r\ntall grass, rushes, or bushes. Owing to this peculiarity the bird may be\r\nabsent from large tracts of country which afford no swamps or marshes\r\nsuitable for nesting. It usually breeds in large colonies, though single\r\nfamilies, consisting of a male with several wives, may sometimes be found\r\nin a small slough, where each of the females builds, her nest and rears\r\nher own little brood, while her liege lord displays his brilliant colors\r\nand struts in the sunshine. In the Upper Mississippi Valley it finds the\r\nconditions most favorable, for the countless prairie sloughs and the\r\nmargins of the numerous shallow lakes form nesting sites for thousands\r\nof redwings; and there are bred the immense flocks which sometimes do so\r\nmuch damage to the grain fields of the West. After the breeding season is\r\nover, the birds collect in flocks to migrate, and remain thus associated\r\nthroughout the winter.\r\n\r\nMany complaints have been made against the redwing, and several States\r\nhave at times placed a bounty upon its head. It is said to cause great\r\ndamage to grain in the West, especially in the Upper Mississippi Valley;\r\nand the rice growers of the South say that it eats rice. No complaints\r\nhave been received from the Northeastern portion of the country, where the\r\nbird is much less abundant than in the West and South.\r\n\r\nAn examination of 725 stomachs showed that vegetable matter forms 74 per\r\ncent of the food, while the animal matter, mainly insects, forms but\r\n26 per cent. A little more than 10 per cent consists of beetles, mostly\r\nharmful species, Weevils, or snout-beetles, amount to 4 per cent of the\r\nyear's food, but in June reach 25 per cent. As weevils are among the most\r\nharmful insects known, their destruction should condone for at least some\r\nof the sins of which the bird has been accused. Grasshoppers constitute\r\nnearly 5 per cent of the food, while the rest of the animal matter is\r\nmade up of various insects, a few snails, and crustaceans. Several dragon\r\nflies were found, but these were probably picked up dead, for they are\r\ntoo active to be taken alive, unless by one of the flycatchers. So far as\r\nthe insect food as a whole is concerned, the redwing may be considered\r\nentirely beneficial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Redwinged blackbird.]\r\n\r\nThe interest in the vegetable food of this bird centers around the grain.\r\nOnly three kinds, corn, wheat, and oats, were found in appreciable\r\nquantities in the stomachs, and they aggregate but little more than 13\r\nper cent of the whole food, oats forming nearly half of this amount. In\r\nview of the many complaints that the redwing eats grain, this record\r\nis surprisingly small. The crow blackbird has been found to eat more\r\nthan three times as much. In the case of the crow, corn forms one-fifth\r\nof the food, so that the redwinged blackbird, whose diet is made up of\r\nonly a trifle more than one-eighth of grain, is really one of the least\r\ndestructive species; but the most important item of this bird's food is\r\nweed seed, which forms practically the whole food in winter and about 57\r\nper cent of the whole year's fare. The principal weed seeds eaten are\r\nthose of ragweed, barn grass, smartweed, and about a dozen others. That\r\nthese seeds are preferred is shown by the fact that the birds begin to\r\neat them in August, when grain is still readily accessible, and continue\r\nfeeding on them even after insects become plentiful in April. The redwing\r\neats very little fruit and does practically no harm in the garden or\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to dispute the mass of testimony which has\r\naccumulated concerning its grain-eating propensity, the stomach\r\nexaminations show that the habit must be local rather than general. As\r\nthe area of cultivation increases and the breeding grounds are curtailed,\r\nthe species is likely to become reduced in numbers and consequently less\r\nharmful. Nearly seven-eighths of the redwing's food is made up of weed\r\nseed or of insects injurious to agriculture, indicating unmistakably that\r\nthe bird should be protected, except, perhaps, in a few places where it is\r\ntoo abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOW LARK, OR OLD FIELD LARK.\r\n\r\n(_Sturnella magna._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meadow lark (fig. 11) is a common and well-known bird occurring from\r\nthe Atlantic Coast to the Great Plains, where it gives way to a closely\r\nrelated subspecies, which extends thence westward to the Pacific. It\r\nwinters from our southern border as far north as the District of Columbia,\r\nsouthern Illinois, and occasionally Iowa. Although it is a bird of the\r\nplains, finding its most congenial haunts in the prairies of the West, it\r\ndoes not disdain the meadows and mowing lands of New England. It nests on\r\nthe ground and is so terrestrial in its habits that it seldom perches on\r\ntrees, preferring a fence rail or a telegraph pole. When undisturbed, it\r\nmay be seen walking about with a peculiar dainty step, stopping every few\r\nmoments to look about and give its tail a nervous flirt or to sound a note\r\nor two of its clear whistle.\r\n\r\nThe meadow lark is almost wholly beneficial, although a few complaints\r\nhave been made that it pulls sprouting grain, and one farmer claims that\r\nit eats clover seed. As a rule, however, it is looked upon with favor and\r\nis not disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the 238 stomachs examined, animal food (practically all insects)\r\nconstituted 73 per cent of the contents and vegetable matter 27 per cent.\r\nAs would naturally be supposed, the insects were ground species, such as\r\nbeetles, bugs, grasshoppers, and caterpillars, with a few flies, wasps,\r\nand spiders. A number of the stomachs were taken from birds that had been\r\nkilled when the ground was covered with snow, but still they contained a\r\nlarge percentage of insects, showing the bird's skill in finding proper\r\nfood under adverse circumstances.\r\n\r\nOf the various insects eaten, crickets and grasshoppers are the most\r\nimportant, constituting 29 per cent of the entire year's food and 69 per\r\ncent of the food in August. It is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon this\r\npoint, but it can readily be seen what an effect a number of these birds\r\nmust have on a field of grass in the height of the grasshopper season.\r\nOf the 238 stomachs collected at all seasons of the year, 178, or more\r\nthan two-thirds, contained remains of grasshoppers, and one was filled\r\nwith fragments at 37 of those insects. This seems to show conclusively\r\nthat grasshoppers are preferred and are eaten whenever they can be\r\nprocured. The great number taken in August is especially noticeable. This\r\nis essentially the grasshopper month, i. e., the month when grasshoppers\r\nreach their maximum abundance; and the stomach examination has shown that\r\na large number of birds resort to this diet in August, no matter what may\r\nbe the food during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Meadow lark.]\r\n\r\nNext to grasshoppers, beetles make up the most important item of the\r\nmeadow lark's food, amounting to nearly 21 per cent, of which about\r\none-third are predaceous ground beetles. The others are all harmful\r\nspecies, and when it is considered that the bird feeds exclusively on the\r\nground, it seems remarkable that so few useful ground beetles are eaten.\r\nMany of them have a disgusting odor, and possibly this may occasionally\r\nsave them from destruction by birds, especially when other food is\r\nabundant. Caterpillars, too, form a very constant element, and in May\r\nconstitute over 28 per cent of the whole food. May is the month when the\r\ndreaded cutworm begins its deadly career, and then the bird does some of\r\nits best work. Most of these caterpillars are ground feeders, and are\r\noverlooked by birds which habitually frequent trees; but the meadow lark\r\nfinds them and devours them by thousands. The remainder of the insect food\r\nis made up of a few ants, wasps, and spiders, with a few bugs, including\r\nsome cinch bugs.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food consists of grain, weed, and other hard seeds. Grain\r\nin general amounts to 14, and weed and other seeds to 12 per cent. The\r\ngrain, principally corn, is mostly eaten in winter and early spring, and\r\nmust be therefore simply waste kernels; only a trifle is consumed in\r\nsummer and autumn, when it is most plentiful. No trace of sprouting grain\r\nwas discovered. Clover seed was found in only six stomachs, and but little\r\nin each. Seeds of weeds, principally ragweed, barn grass, and smartweed,\r\nare eaten from November to April, inclusive, but during the rest of the\r\nyear are replaced by insects.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, more than half of the meadow lark's food consists of\r\nharmful insects; its vegetable food is composed either of noxious weeds\r\nor waste grain, and the remainder is made up of useful beetles or neutral\r\ninsects and spiders. A strong point in the bird's favor is that, although\r\nnaturally an insect eater, it is able to subsist on vegetable food, and\r\nconsequently is not forced to migrate in cold weather any farther than is\r\nnecessary to find ground free from snow. This explains why it remains for\r\nthe most part in the United States during winter, and moves northward as\r\nsoon as the snow disappears from its usual haunts.\r\n\r\nThere is one danger to which the meadow lark is exposed. As its flesh is\r\nhighly esteemed the bird is often shot for the table, but it is entitled\r\nto all possible protection, and to slaughter it for game is the least\r\nprofitable way to utilize this valuable species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALTIMORE ORIOLE.\r\n\r\n(_Icterus galbula._)\r\n\r\n\r\nBrilliancy of plumage, sweetness of song, and food habits to which no\r\nexception can be taken are some of the striking characteristics of the\r\nBaltimore oriole (fig. 12). In summer this species is found throughout\r\nthe northern half of the United States east of the Great Plains, and\r\nis welcomed and loved in every country home in that broad land. In the\r\nNorthern States it arrives rather late, and is usually first seen, or\r\nheard, foraging amidst the early bloom of the apple trees, where it\r\nsearches for caterpillars or feeds daintily on the surplus blossoms. Its\r\nnest commands hardly less admiration than the beauty of its plumage or the\r\nexcellence of its song. Hanging from the tip of the outermost bough of a\r\nstately elm, it is almost inaccessible, and so strongly fastened as to bid\r\ndefiance to the elements.\r\n\r\nBy watching an oriole which has a nest one may see it searching among\r\nthe smaller branches of some neighboring tree, carefully examining each\r\nleaf for caterpillars, and occasionally trilling a few notes to its mate.\r\nObservation both in the field and laboratory shows that caterpillars\r\nconstitute the largest item of its fare. In 113 stomachs they formed 34\r\nper cent of the food, and are eaten in varying quantities during all the\r\nmonths in which the bird remains in this country, although the fewest\r\nare eaten in July, when a little fruit is also taken. The other insects\r\nconsist of beetles, bugs, ants, wasps, grasshoppers, and some spiders. The\r\nbeetles are principally click beetles, the larvæ of which are among the\r\nmost destructive insects known; and the bugs include plant and bark lice,\r\nboth very harmful, but so small and obscure as to be passed over unnoticed\r\nby most birds. Ants are eaten mostly in spring, grasshoppers in July and\r\nAugust, and wasps and spiders with considerable regularity throughout the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nVegetable matter amounts to only a little more than 10 per cent of the\r\nfood during the bird's stay in the United States, so that the possibility\r\nof the oriole doing much damage to crops is very limited. The bird has\r\nbeen accused of eating peas to a considerable extent, but remains of peas\r\nwere found in only two stomachs. One writer says that it damages grapes,\r\nbut none were found. In fact, a few blackberries and cherries comprised\r\nthe only cultivated fruit detected in the stomachs, the remainder of the\r\nvegetable food being wild fruit and a few miscellaneous seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Baltimore oriole.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROW BLACKBIRD, OR GRACKLE.\r\n\r\n(_Quiscalus quiscula._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crow blackbird (fig. 13) or one of its subspecies is a familiar\r\nobject in all of the States east of the Rocky Mountains. It is a resident\r\nthroughout the year as far north as southern Illinois, and in summer\r\nextends its range into British America. In the Mississippi Valley it is\r\none of the most abundant birds, preferring to nest in the artificial\r\ngroves and windbreaks near farms instead of the natural \"timber\" which\r\nit formerly used. It breeds also in parks and near buildings, often in\r\nconsiderable colonies. Farther east, in New England, it is only locally\r\nabundant, though frequently seen in migration. After July it becomes very\r\nrare, or entirely disappears, owing to the fact that it collects in large\r\nflocks and retires to some quiet place, where food is abundant and where\r\nit can remain undisturbed during the molting season, but in the latter\r\ndays of August and throughout September it usually reappears in immense\r\nnumbers before moving southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Crow blackbird.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a bird so large and so abundant may exercise an\r\nimportant influence upon the agricultural welfare of the country it\r\ninhabits. The crow blackbird has been accused of many sins, such as\r\nstealing grain and fruit and robbing the nests of other birds; but the\r\nfarmers do not undertake any war of extermination against it, and, for the\r\nmost part, allow it to nest about the premises undisturbed. An examination\r\nof 2,258 stomachs showed that nearly one-third of its food consists of\r\ninsects, of which the greater part are injurious. The bird also eats a few\r\nsnails, crayfishes, salamanders, small fish, and occasionally a mouse. The\r\nstomach contents do not indicate that it robs other birds' nests to any\r\ngreat extent, as remains of birds and birds' eggs amount to less than one\r\nhalf of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, on account of its vegetable food that the grackle is most\r\nlikely to be accused of doing damage. Grain is eaten during the whole\r\nyear, and during only a short time in summer is other food attractive\r\nenough to induce the bird to alter its diet. The grain taken in the\r\nwinter and spring months probably consists of waste kernels gathered from\r\nthe stubble. The stomachs do not indicate that the bird pulls sprouting\r\ngrain; but the wheat eaten in July and August, and the corn eaten in the\r\nfall, are probably taken from fields of standing grain. The total grain\r\nconsumed during the year constitutes 45 per cent of the whole food, but\r\nit is safe to say that at least half is waste grain, and consequently of\r\nno value. Although the crow blackbird eats a few cherries and blueberries\r\nin their season, and some wild fruit in the fall, it apparently does no\r\ndamage in this way.\r\n\r\nLarge flocks of crow blackbirds no doubt do considerable injury to grain\r\ncrops, and there seems to be no remedy except the destruction of the\r\nbirds, which is in itself expensive. During the breeding season, however,\r\nthe species does much good by eating insects and by feeding them to its\r\nyoung, which are reared almost entirely upon this food. The bird does the\r\ngreatest amount of good in spring, when it follows the plow in search\r\nof large grub worms, of which it is so fond that it sometimes literally\r\ncrams its stomach full of them. The farmer must decide for himself\r\nwhether or not these birds cause more damage than can be repaid by insect\r\ndestruction; but when they destroy an entire crop it is no consolation to\r\nknow that they have already eaten a multitude of insects which, if left\r\nalone, would have accomplished the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROWS.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The sparrows here mentioned are all native species. For a full\r\naccount of the English sparrow, including its introduction, habits, and\r\ndepredations, see Bull. No. 1 of the Division of Ornithology, published in\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nSparrows are not obtrusive birds, either in plumage, song, or action.\r\nThere are some forty species, with nearly as many subspecies, in North\r\nAmerica, but their differences, both in plumage and habits, are in most\r\ncases too obscure to be readily recognized, and not more than half a dozen\r\nforms are generally known in any one locality. All the species are more or\r\nless migratory, but so widely are they distributed that there is probably\r\nno part of the country where some can not be found throughout the year.\r\n\r\nWhile sparrows are noted seed eaters, they do not by any means confine\r\nthemselves to a vegetable diet. During the summer, and especially in the\r\nbreeding season, they eat many insects, and probably feed their young\r\nlargely upon the same food. An examination of the stomachs of three\r\nspecies--the song sparrow (_Melospiza_), chipping sparrow (_Spizella\r\nsocialis_), and field sparrow (_Spizella pusilla_) (fig. 14)--shows\r\nthat about one third of the food consists of insects, comprising many\r\ninjurious beetles, such as snout-beetles or weevils, and leaf beetles.\r\nMany grasshoppers are eaten, and in the case of the chipping sparrow\r\nthese insects form one eighth of the food. Grasshoppers would seem to\r\nbe rather large morsels, but the bird probably confines itself to the\r\nsmaller species; indeed, this is indicated by the fact that the greatest\r\namount (over 36 per cent) is eaten in June, when the larger species are\r\nstill young and the small species most numerous. Besides the insects\r\nalready mentioned, many wasps and bugs are taken. Predaceous and parasitic\r\nHymenoptera and predaceous beetles, all useful insects, are eaten only\r\nto a slight extent, so that as a whole the sparrows' insect diet may be\r\nconsidered beneficial.\r\n\r\nTheir vegetable food is limited almost exclusively to hard seeds. This\r\nmight seem to indicate that the birds feed to some extent upon grain, but\r\nthe stomachs examined show only one kind--oats--and but little of that.\r\nThe great bulk of the food is made up of grass and weed seed, which form\r\nalmost the entire diet during winter, and the amount consumed is immense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Field sparrow.]\r\n\r\nAnyone acquainted with the agricultural region of the Upper Mississippi\r\nValley can not have failed to notice the enormous growth of weeds in every\r\nwaste spot where the original sward has been disturbed. By the roadside,\r\non the borders of cultivated fields, or in abandoned fields, wherever they\r\ncan obtain a foothold, masses of rank weeds spring up, and often form\r\nimpenetrable thickets which afford food and shelter for immense numbers\r\nof birds and enable them to withstand great cold and the most terrible\r\nblizzards. A person visiting one of these weed patches on a sunny morning\r\nin January, when the thermometer is 20° or more below zero, will be struck\r\nwith the life and animation of the busy little inhabitants. Instead of\r\nsitting forlorn and half frozen, they may be seen flitting from branch to\r\nbranch, twittering and fluttering, and showing every evidence of enjoyment\r\nand perfect comfort. If one of them be killed and examined, it will be\r\nfound in excellent condition--in fact, a veritable ball of fat.\r\n\r\nThe snowbird (_Junco hyemalis_) and tree sparrow (_Spizella monticola_)\r\nare perhaps the most numerous of all the sparrows. The latter fairly\r\nswarms all over the Northern States in winter, arriving from the north\r\nearly in October and leaving in April. Examination of many stomachs shows\r\nthats in Winter the tree sparrow feeds entirely upon seeds of weeds; and\r\nprobably each bird consumes about one-fourth of an ounce a day. In an\r\narticle contributed to the New York Tribune in 1881 the writer estimated\r\nthe amount of weed seed annually destroyed by these birds in the State of\r\nIowa. Upon the basis of one-fourth of an ounce of seed eaten daily by each\r\nbird, and supposing that the birds averaged ten to each square mile, and\r\nthat they remain in their winter range two hundred days, we shall have\r\na total of 1,750,000 pounds, or 875 tons, of weed seed consumed by this\r\none species in a single season. Large as these figures may seem, they\r\ncertainly fall far short of the reality. The estimate of ten birds to a\r\nsquare mile is much within the truth, for the tree sparrow is certainly\r\nmore abundant than this in winter in Massachusetts, where the food supply\r\nis less than in the Western States, and I have known places in Iowa where\r\nseveral thousand could be seen within the space of a few acres. This\r\nestimate, moreover, is for a single species, while, as a matter of fact,\r\nthere are at least half a dozen birds (not all sparrows) that habitually\r\nfeed on these seeds during winter.\r\n\r\nFarther south the tree sparrow is replaced in winter by the white-throated\r\nsparrow, the white-crowned sparrow, the fox sparrow, the song sparrow,\r\nthe field sparrow, and several others; so that all over the country there\r\nare a vast number of those seed eaters at work during the colder months\r\nreducing next year's crop of worse than useless plants.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the value of birds, it has been customary to consider them\r\nmainly as insect destroyers; but the foregoing illustration seems to\r\nshow that seed eaters have a useful function, which has never been fully\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK.\r\n\r\n(_Zamelodia ludoviciana._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful rose-breasted grosbeak (fig. 15) breeds in the northern half\r\nof the United States east of the Missouri River, but spends its winters\r\nbeyond our boundaries. Unfortunately it is not abundant in New England,\r\nand nowhere as plentiful as it should be. It frequents groves and orchards\r\nrather than gardens or dooryards, but probably the beauty of the male is\r\nthe greatest obstacle to its increase; the fully adult bird is pure black\r\nand white, with a broad patch of brilliant rose color upon the breast and\r\nunder each wing. On account of this attractive plumage the birds are\r\nhighly prized for ladies' hats; and consequently heave been shot in season\r\nand out, till the wonder is not that there are so few, but that any remain\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nWhen the Colorado potato beetle first swept over the land, and naturalists\r\nand farmers were anxious to discover whether or not there were any enemies\r\nwhich would prey upon the pest, the grosbeak was almost the only bird seen\r\nto eat the beetles. Further observation confirmed the fact, and there can\r\nbe no reasonable doubt that where the bird is abundant it has contributed\r\nvery much to the abatement of the pest which has been noted during the\r\nlast decade. But this is not the only good which the bird does, for many\r\nother noxious insects besides the potato beetle are also eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Rose-breasted grosbeak.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of the grosbeak consists of buds and blossoms of forest\r\ntrees, and seeds, but the only damage of which it has been accused is the\r\nstealing of green peas. The writer has observed it eating peas and has\r\nexamined the stomachs of several that had been killed in the very act. The\r\nstomachs contained a few peas and enough potato beetles, old and young, as\r\nwell as other harmful insects, to pay for all the peas the birds would be\r\nlikely to eat in a whole season. The garden where this took place adjoined\r\na small potato field which earlier in the season had been so badly\r\ninfested with the beetles that the vines were completely riddled. The\r\ngrosbeaks visited the field every day, and finally brought their fledged\r\nyoung. The young birds stood in a row on the topmost rail of the fence and\r\nwere fed with the beetles which their parents gathered. When a careful\r\ninspection was made a few days later, not a beetle, old or young, could be\r\nfound; the birds had swept them from the field and saved the potatoes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to advise measures either for increasing the numbers of this\r\nbird or inducing it to take up its residence on the farm. Naturally it\r\ninhabits thin, open woods or groves, and the change from such places to\r\norchards would be simple--in fact, has already been made in some parts\r\nof Pennsylvania and Ohio. In New England the bird is somewhat rare, and\r\nperhaps the best that can be done here or elsewhere it to see that it is\r\nthoroughly protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are seven common species of swallows within the limits of the United\r\nStates, four of which have, to some extent, abandoned their primitive\r\nnesting habits and attached themselves to the abodes of man. As a group,\r\nswallows are gregarious and social in an eminent degree. Some species\r\nbuild nests in large colonies, occasionally numbering thousands; in the\r\ncase of others only two or three pairs are found together; while still\r\nothers nest habitually in single pairs.\r\n\r\nTheir habits are too familiar to require any extended description. Their\r\nindustry and tirelessness are wonderful, and during the day it is rare to\r\nsee swallows at rest except just before their departure for the South,\r\nwhen they assemble upon telegraph wires or upon the roofs of buildings,\r\napparently making plans for the journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Barn swallow.]\r\n\r\nA noticeable characteristic of several of the species is their attachment\r\nto man. In the eastern part of the country the barn swallow (_Chelidon\r\nerythrogastra_) (fig. 16) now builds exclusively under roofs, having\r\nentirely abandoned the rock caves and cliffs in which it formerly nested.\r\nMore recently the cliff swallow (_Petrochelidon lunifrons_) has found a\r\nbetter nesting site under the eaves of buildings than was afforded by the\r\noverhanging-cliffs of earth or stone which it once used, and to which it\r\nstill resorts occasionally in the East, and habitually in the unsettled\r\nWest. The martin (_Progne subis_) and white-bellied swallow (_Tachycineta\r\nbicolor_) nest either in houses supplied for the purpose, in abandoned\r\nnests of woodpeckers, or in natural crannies in rocks. The other species\r\nhave not yet abandoned their primitive habitats, but possibly may do so as\r\nthe country becomes more thickly settled.\r\n\r\nField observation will convince any ordinarily attentive person that the\r\nfood of swallows must consist of the smaller insects captured in mid-air,\r\nor perhaps in some cases picked from the tops of tall grass or weeds. This\r\nobservation is borne out by an examination of stomachs, which shows that\r\nthe food consists of many small species of beetles which are much on the\r\nwing; many species of Diptera (mosquitoes and their allies), with large\r\nquantities of flying ants and a few insects of similar kinds. Most of them\r\nare either injurious or annoying, and the numbers destroyed by swallows\r\nare not only, beyond calculation, but almost beyond imagination.\r\n\r\nThe white-bellied swallow eats a considerable number of berries of the\r\nbayberry, or wax myrtle. During migrations and in winter it has a habit of\r\nroosting in these shrubs, and it probably obtains the fruit at that time.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to tear down the nests of a colony of cliff swallows from\r\nthe eaves of a barn, for so far from disfiguring a building the nests make\r\na picturesque addition, and their presence should be encouraged by every\r\ndevice. It is said that cliff and barn swallows can be induced to build\r\ntheir nests in a particular locality, otherwise suitable, by providing a\r\nquantity of mud to be used as mortar. Barn swallows may also be encouraged\r\nby cutting a small hole in the gable of the barn, while martins and\r\nwhite-bellied swallows will be grateful for boxes like those for the\r\nbluebird, but placed in some higher situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEDAR BIRD.\r\n\r\n(_Ampelis cedrorum._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cedar waxwing, or cherry bird (fig. 17), inhabits the whole of the\r\nUnited States, but is much less common in the West. Although the great\r\nbulk of the species retires southward in winter, the bird is occasionally\r\nfound in every State during the colder months, especially if wild berries\r\nare abundant. Its proverbial fondness for cherries has given rise to its\r\npopular name, and much complaint has been made on account of the fruit\r\neaten. Observation has shown, however, that its depredations are confined\r\nto trees on which the fruit ripens earliest, while later varieties are\r\ncomparatively untouched. This is probably owing to the fact that when wild\r\nfruits ripen they are preferred to cherries, and really constitute the\r\nbulk of the cedar bird's diet.\r\n\r\nIn 152 stomachs examined animal matter formed only 13 and vegetable 87\r\nper cent, showing that the bird is not wholly a fruit eater. With the\r\nexception of a few snails, all the animal food consisted of insects,\r\nmainly beetles--and all but one more or less noxious, the famous elm\r\nleaf-beetle being among the number. Bark or scale lice were found in\r\nseveral stomachs, while the remainder of the animal food was made up of\r\ngrasshoppers, bugs, and the like. Three nestlings were found to have been\r\nfed almost entirely on insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Cedar bird.]\r\n\r\nOf the 87 per cent of vegetable food, 74 consisted entirely of wild fruit\r\nor seeds and 13 of cultivated fruit, but a large part of the latter was\r\nmade up of blackberries and raspberries, and it is very doubtful whether\r\nthey represented cultivated varieties. Cherry stealing is the chief\r\ncomplaint against this bird, but of the 152 stomachs only 9, all taken in\r\nJune and July, contained any remains of cultivated cherries, and these\r\naggregate but 5 per cent of the year's food. As 41 stomachs were collected\r\nin those months, it is evident that the birds do not live to any great\r\nextent on cultivated cherries.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cherry bird is not a great insect destroyer, it does some\r\ngood work in this way, since it probably rears its young mostly upon\r\ninsect food. On the other hand, it does not devour nearly as much\r\ncultivated fruit as has been asserted, and most, if not all, of the\r\ndamage can be prevented. The bird should therefore be considered a useful\r\nspecies, and as such should be accorded all possible protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATBIRD.\r\n\r\n(_Galeoscoptes carolinensis._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe catbird (fig. 18), like the thrasher, is a lover of swamps, and\r\ndelights to make its home in a tangle of wild grapevines, greenbriars,\r\nand shrubs, where it is safe from attack and can find its favorite food\r\nin abundance. It is found throughout the United States west to the Rocky\r\nMountains; occurs also in Washington, Idaho, and Utah, and extends\r\nnorthward into British America. It winters in the Southern States, Cuba,\r\nMexico, and Central America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Catbird.]\r\n\r\nThe catbird always attracts attention, and the intruder upon its haunts\r\nsoon understands that he is not welcome. There is no mistaking the meaning\r\nof the sneering voice with which he is saluted, and there is little doubt\r\nthat this gave rise to the popular prejudice against the bird; but the\r\nfeeling has been increased by the fact that the species is sometimes a\r\nserious annoyance to fruit growers. All such reports, however, seem to\r\ncome from the prairie country of the West. In New England, according\r\nto the writer's experience the catbird is seldom seen about gardens\r\nor orchards; the reason may possibly be found in the fact that on the\r\nprairies fruit-bearing shrubs which afford so large a part of this bird's\r\nfood are conspicuously absent. With the settlement of this region comes an\r\nextensive planting of orchards, vineyards, and small fruit gardens, which\r\nfurnish shelter and nesting sites for the catbird, as well as for other\r\nspecies, with a consequent large increase in their numbers, but without\r\nproviding the native fruits upon which they have been accustomed to feed.\r\nUnder these circumstances, what is more natural than for the birds to\r\nturn to cultivated fruits for their supplies? The remedy is obvious;\r\ncultivated fruits can be protected by the simple expedient of planting\r\nwild species or others which are preferred by the birds. Some experiments\r\nwith catbirds in captivity showed that the Russian mulberry was preferred\r\nto any cultivated fruit that could be offered.\r\n\r\nThe stomachs of 213 catbirds wore examined and found to contain 44 per\r\ncent of animal (insect) and 56 per cent of vegetable food.[3] Ants,\r\nbeetles, caterpillars, and grasshoppers constitute three-fourths of the\r\nanimal food, the remainder being made up of bugs, miscellaneous insects\r\nand spiders. One-third of the vegetable food consists of cultivated\r\nfruits, or those which may be cultivated, such as strawberries,\r\nraspberries, and blackberries; but while we debit the bird with the whole\r\nof this, it is probable--and in the eastern and well-wooded part of the\r\ncountry almost certain--that a large part was obtained from wild vines.\r\nThe rest of the vegetable matter is mostly wild fruit, such as cherries,\r\ndogwood, sour gum, elder berries, greenbriar, spice berries, black alder,\r\nsumac, and poison ivy.\r\n\r\n[3] The investigation of the food of the catbird, brown thrasher, and\r\nhouse wren was made by Mr. Sylvester D. Judd and published in the Yearbook\r\nof the Department of Agriculture for 1895, pp. 405-418.\r\n\r\nAlthough the catbird sometimes does considerable harm by destroying small\r\nfruit, the bird can not be considered injurious. On the contrary, in most\r\nparts of the country it does far more good than harm, and the evil it does\r\ncan be reduced appreciably by the methods already pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN THRASHER.\r\n\r\n(_Harporhynchus rufus._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brown thrasher (fig. 19) breeds throughout the United States east\r\nof the Great Plains, and winters in the south Atlantic and Gulf States.\r\nIt occasionally visits the garden or orchard, but nests in swamps or in\r\ngroves standing upon low ground. While it generally prefers a thickly\r\ngrown retreat, it sometimes builds in a pile of brush at a distance from\r\ntrees. On account of its more retiring habits it is not so conspicuous\r\nas the robin, although it may be equally abundant. Few birds can excel\r\nthe thrasher in sweetness of song, but it is so shy that its notes are\r\nnot heard often enough to be appreciated. Its favorite time for singing\r\nis the early morning, when, perched on the top of some tall bush or low\r\ntree, it gives an exhibition of vocal powers which would do credit to a\r\nmockingbird. Indeed, in the South, where the latter bird is abundant, the\r\nthrasher is known as the sandy mocker.\r\n\r\nThe food of the brown thrasher consists of both fruit and insects. An\r\nexamination of 121 stomachs showed 30 per cent of vegetable and 64 of\r\nanimal food, practically all insects, and mostly taken in spring before\r\nfruit is ripe. Half the insects were beetles, and the remainder chiefly\r\ngrasshoppers, caterpillars, bugs, and spiders. A few predaceous beetles\r\nwere eaten, but, on the whole, its work as an insect destroyer may be\r\nconsidered beneficial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Brown thrasher.]\r\n\r\nEight per cent of the food is made up of fruits like raspberries and\r\ncurrants which are or may be cultivated, but the raspberries at least\r\nare as likely to belong to wild as to cultivated varieties. Grain, made\r\nup mostly of scattered kernels of oats and corn, is merely a trifle,\r\namounting to only 3 per cent, and though some of the corn may be taken\r\nfrom newly planted fields it is amply paid for by the May beetles which\r\nare eaten at the same time. The rest of the food consists of wild fruit or\r\nseeds. Taken all in all, the brown thrasher is a useful bird, and probably\r\ndoes just as good work in its secluded retreats as it would about the\r\ngarden, for the swamps and groves are no doubt the breeding grounds of\r\nmany insects that migrate thence to attack the farmers' crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE WREN.\r\n\r\n(_Troglodytes aëdon._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diminutive house wren (fig. 20) frequents barns and gardens, and\r\nparticularly old orchards in which the trees are partially decayed.\r\nHe makes his nest in a hollow branch where perhaps a woodpecker had a\r\ndomicile the year before, but he is a pugnacious character, and if he\r\nhappens to fancy one of the boxes that have been put up for the bluebirds\r\nhe does not hesitate to take it. He is usually not slow to avail himself\r\nof boxes, gourds, tin cans, or empty jars placed for his accommodation.\r\n\r\nAs regards food habits, the house wren is entirely beneficial.\r\nPractically, he can be said to live upon animal food alone, for an\r\nexamination of 62 stomachs showed that 98 per cent of the stomach\r\ncontents was made up of insects or their allies, and only 2 per cent was\r\nvegetable, including bits of grass and similar matter, evidently taken by\r\naccident with the insects. Half of this food consisted of grasshoppers\r\nand beetles; the remainder of caterpillars, bugs, and spiders. As the\r\nhouse wren is a prolific breeder, frequently rearing from twelve to\r\nsixteen young in a season, a family of these birds must cause considerable\r\nreduction in the number of insects in a garden. Wrens are industrious\r\nforagers, searching every tree, shrub, or vine for caterpillars, examining\r\nevery post and rail of the fence, and every cranny in the wall for insects\r\nor spiders. They do not, as a rule, fly far afield, but work industriously\r\nin the immediate vicinity of their nests. In this way they become valuable\r\naids in the garden or orchard, and by providing suitable nesting boxes\r\nthey may be induced to take up residence where their services will do most\r\ngood. Their eccentricities in the selection of a home are well-known.\r\nAlmost anything, from an old cigar box to a tomato can, an old teapot, a\r\nworn-out boot, or a horse's skull, is acceptable, provided it be placed\r\nwell up from the ground and out of reach of cats and other prowlers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--House wren.]\r\n\r\nIt does not seem possible to have too many wrens, and every effort should\r\nbe made to protect them and to encourage their nesting about the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBIN.\r\n\r\n(_Merula migratoria._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robin (fig. 21) is found throughout the United States east of the\r\nGreat Plains, and is represented farther west by a slightly different\r\nsubspecies. It extends far north through Canada, and is found even in\r\nAlaska. Although the great bulk of the species leaves the Northern States\r\nin winter, a few individuals remain in sheltered swamps, where wild\r\nberries furnish an abundant supply of food.\r\n\r\nThe robin builds its nest in orchards and gardens, and occasionally takes\r\nadvantage of a nook about the house, or under the shelter of the roof of\r\na shed or outbuilding. Its food habits have sometimes caused apprehension\r\nto the fruit grower, for it is fond of cherries and other small fruits,\r\nparticularly the earlier varieties. For this reason many complaints have\r\nbeen lodged against it, and some persons have gone so far as to condemn\r\nthe bird. The robin is, however, too valuable to be exterminated, and\r\nchoice fruit can be readily protected from its depredations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Robin.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of 330 stomachs shows that over 42 per cent of its food is\r\nanimal matter, principally insects, while the remainder is made up largely\r\nof small fruits or berries. Over 19 per cent consists of beetles, about\r\none-third of which are useful ground beetles, taken mostly in spring and\r\nfall, when other insects are scarce. Grasshoppers makeup about one-tenth\r\nof the whole food, but in August comprise over 30 per cent. Caterpillars\r\nform about G per cent, while the rest of the animal food, about 7 per\r\ncent, is made up of various insects, with a few spiders, snails, and\r\nangle-worms. All the grasshoppers, caterpillars, and bugs, with in large\r\nportion of the beetles, are injurious, and it is safe to say that noxious\r\ninsects comprise more than one-third of the robin's food.\r\n\r\nVegetable food forms nearly 58 per cent of the stomach contents, over 47\r\nbeing wild fruits, and only a little more than 4 per cent being possibly\r\ncultivated varieties. Cultivated fruit amounting to about 25 per cent was\r\nfound in the stomachs in June and July, but only a trifle in August. Wild\r\nfruit, on the contrary, is eaten in every month, and constitutes a staple\r\nfood during half the year. No less than forty-one species were identified\r\nin the stomachs of these, the most important were four species of dogwood,\r\nthree of wild cherries, three of wild grapes, four of greenbriar, two\r\nof holly, two of elder; and cranberries, huckleberries, blueberries,\r\nbarberries, service berries, cranberries, and persimmons, with four\r\nspecies of sumac, and various other seeds not strictly fruit.\r\n\r\nThe depredations of the robin seem to be confined to the smaller and\r\nearlier fruits, and few, if any, complaints have been made against it\r\non the score of eating apples, peaches, pears, grapes, or even late\r\ncherries. By the time these are ripe the forests and hedges are teeming\r\nwith wild fruits, which the bird evidently finds more to its taste. The\r\ncherry, unfortunately, ripens so early that it, is almost the only fruit\r\naccessible at a time when the bird's appetite has been sharpened by a\r\nlong-continued diet of insects, earthworms, and dried berries, and it is\r\nno wonder that at first the rich juicy morsels are greedily eaten. In view\r\nof the fact that the robin takes ten times as much wild as cultivated\r\nfruit, it seems unwise to destroy the birds to save so little. Nor is this\r\nnecessary, for by a little care both may be preserved. Where much fruit is\r\ngrown, it is no great loss to give up one tree to the birds; and in some\r\ncases the crop can be protected by scarecrows. Where wild fruit is not\r\nabundant, a few fruit-bearing shrubs and vines judiciously planted will\r\nserve for ornament and provide food for the birds. The Russian mulberry\r\nis a vigorous grower and a profuse bearer, ripening at the same time as\r\nthe cherry, and, so far as observation has gone, most birds scorn to\r\nprefer its fruit to any other. It is believed that a number of these trees\r\nplanted around the garden or orchard would fully protect the more valuable\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nMany persons have written about the delicate discrimination of birds for\r\nchoice fruit, asserting that only the finest and costliest varieties are\r\nselected. This is contrary to all careful scientific observation. Birds,\r\nunlike human beings, seem to prefer fruit like the mulberry, that is\r\nsweetly insipid, or that has some astringent or bitter quality like the\r\nchokecherry or holly. The so-called black alder (_Ilex verticillata_),\r\nwhich is a species of holly, has bright scarlet berries, as bitter as\r\nquinine, that ripen late in October, and remain on the bushes through\r\nNovember, and though frost grapes, the fruit of the Virginia creeper,\r\nand several species of dogwood are abundant at the same time, the birds\r\neat the berries of the holly to a considerable extent, as shown by the\r\nseeds found in the stomachs. It is moreover a remarkable fact that the\r\nwild fruits upon which the birds feed largely are those which man neither\r\ngathers for his own use nor adopts for cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUEBIRD.\r\n\r\n(_Sialia sialis._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common and familiar bluebird (fig. 22) is an inhabitant of all the\r\nStates east of the Rocky Mountains from the Gulf of Mexico northward into\r\nCanada. It winters as far north as southern Illinois, in the Mississippi\r\nValley, and Pennsylvania in the east; in spring it is one of the first\r\nmigrants to arrive in the Northern States, and is always welcomed as an\r\nindication of the final breaking up of winter. It frequents orchards and\r\ngardens, where it builds its nest in hollow trees, or takes advantage of a\r\nnesting box provided by the enterprising farmer's boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Bluebird.]\r\n\r\nSo far as known, this bird has not been accused of stealing fruit or of\r\npreying upon any crops. An examination of 205 stomachs showed that 76 per\r\ncent of the food consists of insects and their allies, while the other\r\n24 per cent is made up of various vegetable substances, found mostly in\r\nstomachs taken in winter. Beetles constitute 28 per cent of the whole\r\nfood, grasshoppers 22, caterpillars 11, and various insects, including\r\nquite a number of spiders, comprise the remainder of the insect diet. All\r\nthese are more or less harmful, except a few predaceous beetles, which\r\namount to 8 per cent, but in view of the large consumption of grasshoppers\r\nand caterpillars, we can at least condone this offense, if such it may be\r\ncalled. The destruction of grasshoppers is very noticeable in the months\r\nof August and September, when these insects form more than 60 per cent of\r\nthe diet.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the selection of its food the bluebird is governed\r\nmore by abundance than by choice. Predaceous beetles are eaten in spring,\r\nas they are among the first insects to appear; but in early summer\r\ncaterpillars form an important part of the diet, and are replaced a\r\nlittle later by grasshoppers. Beetles are eaten at all times, except when\r\ngrasshoppers are more easily obtained.\r\n\r\nSo far as its vegetable food is concerned, the bluebird is positively\r\nharmless. The only trace of any useful product in the stomachs consisted\r\nof a few blackberry seeds, and even these more probably belonged to wild\r\nthan cultivated varieties. Following is a list of the various seeds\r\nwhich were found: Blackberry, chokeberry, juniperberry, pokeberry,\r\npartridgeberry, greenbriar, Virginia creeper, bittersweet, holly,\r\nstrawberry bush, false spikenard, wild sarsaparilla, sumac (several\r\nspecies), rose haws, sorrel, ragweed, grass, and asparagus. This list\r\nshows how little the bluebird depends upon the farm or garden to supply\r\nits needs, and indicates that by encouraging the growth of some of these\r\nplants, many of which are highly ornamental, the bird can be induced to\r\nmake its home on the premises.\r\n\r\nBluebirds are so well known that it seems unnecessary to urge anything\r\nmore in their favor; but in view of the fact that large numbers were\r\ndestroyed during the severe storm of 1895, more than ordinary vigilance\r\nshould be exercised in protecting them until they have regained their\r\nnormal abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures were moved so as to prevent splitting paragraphs.
