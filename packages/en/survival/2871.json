Of these facts I have been able here to use only those\r\nwhich seemed to me the more important. I have omitted some statements, and\r\ncorrected some errors, the discovery of which I owe to my reviewers. Many\r\nadditional references have been given. The eleventh chapter, and that on\r\nPangenesis, are those which have been most altered, parts having been re-\r\nmodelled; but I will give a list of the more important alterations for the\r\nsake of those who may possess the first edition of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.I.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS.\r\n\r\nANCIENT VARIETIES OF THE

to describe all the many races of animals\r\nwhich have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which have been\r\ncultivated by him; even if I possessed the requisite knowledge, so gigantic\r\nan undertaking would be here superfluous. It is my intention to give under\r\nthe head of each species only such facts as I have been able to collect or\r\nobserve, showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and\r\nplants have undergone whilst under man's dominion, or which bear on the\r\ngeneral principles of variation. In one case alone, namely in that of the\r\ndomestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races, their history,\r\nthe amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps by which\r\nthey have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case\r\nfully described will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also\r\ndescribe domesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable fulness.\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a\r\nlittle difficult to decide how they can be best arranged. I have determined\r\nin the first part to give, under the heads of the various animals and\r\nplants, a large body of facts, some of which may at first appear but little\r\nrelated to our subject, and to devote the latter part to general\r\ndiscussions. Whenever I have found it necessary to give numerous details,\r\nin support of any proposition or conclusion, small type has been used.\r\n(Here shown with [].) The reader will, I think, find this plan a\r\nconvenience, for, if he does not doubt the conclusion or care about the\r\ndetails, he can easily pass them over; yet I may be permitted to say that\r\nsome of the discussions thus printed deserve attention, at least from the\r\nprofessed naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to those who have read nothing about Natural Selection, if\r\nI here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of its bearing on the\r\norigin of species. (Introduction/1. To any one who has attentively read my\r\n'Origin of Species' this Introduction will be superfluous. As I stated in\r\nthat work that I should soon publish the facts on which the conclusions\r\ngiven in it were founded, I here beg permission to remark that the great\r\ndelay in publishing this first work has been caused by continued ill-\r\nhealth.) This is the more desirable, as it is impossible in the present\r\nwork to avoid many allusions to questions which will be fully discussed in\r\nfuture volumes.\r\n\r\nFrom a remote period, in all parts of the world, man has subjected many\r\nanimals and plants to domestication or culture. Man has no power of\r\naltering the absolute conditions of life; he cannot change the climate of\r\nany country; he adds no new element to the soil; but he can remove an\r\nanimal or plant from one climate or soil to another, and give it food on\r\nwhich it did not subsist in its natural state. It is an error to speak of\r\nman \"tampering with nature\" and causing variability. If a man drops a piece\r\nof iron into sulphuric acid, it cannot be said strictly that he makes the\r\nsulphate of iron, he only allows their elective affinities to come into\r\nplay. If organic beings had not possessed an inherent tendency to vary, man\r\ncould have done nothing. (Introduction/2. M. Pouchet has recently\r\n('Plurality of Races' English Translation 1864 page 83 etc.) insisted that\r\nvariation under domestication throws no light on the natural modification\r\nof species. I cannot perceive the force of his arguments, or, to speak more\r\naccurately, of his assertions to this effect.) He unintentionally exposes\r\nhis animals and plants to various conditions of life, and variability\r\nsupervenes, which he cannot even prevent or check. Consider the simple case\r\nof a plant which has been cultivated during a long time in its native\r\ncountry, and which consequently has not been subjected to any change of\r\nclimate. It has been protected to a certain extent from the competing roots\r\nof plants of other kinds; it has generally been grown in manured soil; but\r\nprobably not richer than that of many an alluvial flat; and lastly, it has\r\nbeen exposed to changes in its conditions, being grown sometimes in one\r\ndistrict and sometimes in another, in different soils. Under such\r\ncircumstances, scarcely a plant can be named, though cultivated in the\r\nrudest manner, which has not given birth to several varieties. It can\r\nhardly be maintained that during the many changes which this earth has\r\nundergone, and during the natural migrations of plants from one land or\r\nisland to another, tenanted by different species, that such plants will not\r\noften have been subjected to changes in their conditions analogous to those\r\nwhich almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary. No doubt man\r\nselects varying individuals, sows their seeds, and again selects their\r\nvarying offspring. But the initial variation on which man works, and\r\nwithout which he can do nothing, is caused by slight changes in the\r\nconditions of life, which must often have occurred under nature. Man,\r\ntherefore, may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic\r\nscale; and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of time\r\nhas incessantly tried. Hence it follows that the principles of\r\ndomestication are important for us. The main result is that organic beings\r\nthus treated have varied largely, and the variations have been inherited.\r\nThis has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long held by some\r\nfew naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo change.\r\n\r\nI shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the whole\r\nsubject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to obtain some\r\nlight, little though it be, on the causes of variability,--on the laws\r\nwhich govern it, such as the direct action of climate and food, the effects\r\nof use and disuse, and of correlation of growth,--and on the amount of\r\nchange to which domesticated organisms are liable. We shall learn something\r\nof the laws of inheritance, of the effects of crossing different breeds,\r\nand on that sterility which often supervenes when organic beings are\r\nremoved from their natural conditions of life, and likewise when they are\r\ntoo closely interbred. During this investigation we shall see that the\r\nprinciple of Selection is highly important. Although man does not cause\r\nvariability and cannot even prevent it, he can select, preserve, and\r\naccumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature almost in any\r\nway which he chooses; and thus he can certainly produce a great result.\r\nSelection may be followed either methodically and intentionally, or\r\nunconsciously and unintentionally. Man may select and preserve each\r\nsuccessive variation, with the distinct intention of improving and altering\r\na breed, in accordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up\r\nvariations, often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he\r\nhas effected wonderful changes and improvements. It can, also, be clearly\r\nshown that man, without any intention or thought of improving the breed, by\r\npreserving in each successive generation the individuals which he prizes\r\nmost, and by destroying the worthless individuals, slowly, though surely,\r\ninduces great changes. As the will of man thus comes into play, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants\r\nand pleasures. We can further understand how it is that domestic races of\r\nanimals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal character,\r\nas compared with natural species; for they have been modified not for their\r\nown benefit, but for that of man.\r\n\r\nIn another work I shall discuss, if time and health permit, the variability\r\nof organic beings in a state of nature; namely, the individual differences\r\npresented by animals and plants, and those slightly greater and generally\r\ninherited differences which are ranked by naturalists as varieties or\r\ngeographical races. We shall see how difficult, or rather how impossible it\r\noften is, to distinguish between races and sub-species, as the less well-\r\nmarked forms have sometimes been denominated; and again between sub-species\r\nand true species. I shall further attempt to show that it is the common and\r\nwidely ranging, or, as they may be called, the dominant species, which most\r\nfrequently vary; and that it is the large and flourishing genera which\r\ninclude the greatest number of varying species. Varieties, as we shall see,\r\nmay justly be called incipient species.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged, granting that organic beings in a state of nature\r\npresent some varieties,--that their organisation is in some slight degree\r\nplastic; granting that many animals and plants have varied greatly under\r\ndomestication, and that man by his power of selection has gone on\r\naccumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked and firmly\r\ninherited races; granting all this, how, it may be asked, have species\r\narisen in a state of nature? The differences between natural varieties are\r\nslight; whereas the differences are considerable between the species of the\r\nsame genus, and great between the species of distinct genera. How do these\r\nlesser differences become augmented into the greater difference? How do\r\nvarieties, or as I have called them incipient species, become converted\r\ninto true and well-defined species? How has each new species been adapted\r\nto the surrounding physical conditions, and to the other forms of life on\r\nwhich it in any way depends? We see on every side of us innumerable\r\nadaptations and contrivances, which have justly excited the highest\r\nadmiration of every observer. There is, for instance, a fly (Cecidomyia\r\n(Introduction/3. Leon Dufour in 'Annales des Science. Nat.' (3rd series,\r\nZoolog.) tome 5 page 6.)) which deposits its eggs within the stamens of a\r\nScrophularia, and secretes a poison which produces a gall, on which the\r\nlarva feeds; but there is another insect (Misocampus) which deposits its\r\neggs within the body of the larva within the gall, and is thus nourished by\r\nits living prey; so that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous\r\ninsect, and this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a\r\nparticular organ of a particular plant. So it is, in a more or less plainly\r\nmarked manner, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases, with the lowest\r\nas well as with the highest productions of nature.\r\n\r\nThis problem of the conversion of varieties into species,--that is, the\r\naugmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into the\r\ngreater differences characteristic of species and genera, including the\r\nadmirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic\r\nconditions of life,--has been briefly treated in my 'Origin of Species.' It\r\nwas there shown that all organic beings, without exception, tend to\r\nincrease at so high a ratio, that no district, no station, not even the\r\nwhole surface of the land or the whole ocean, would hold the progeny of a\r\nsingle pair after a certain number of generations. The inevitable result is\r\nan ever-recurrent Struggle for Existence. It has truly been said that all\r\nnature is at war; the strongest ultimately prevail, the weakest fail; and\r\nwe well know that myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the\r\nearth. If then organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight\r\ndegree, owing to changes in the surrounding conditions, of which we have\r\nabundant geological evidence, or from any other cause; if, in the long\r\ncourse of ages, inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous\r\nto any being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life;\r\nand it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise,\r\nseeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his own\r\nprofit or pleasure; if then these contingencies ever occur, and I do not\r\nsee how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted, then the severe\r\nand often-recurrent struggle for existence will determine that those\r\nvariations, however slight, which are favourable shall be preserved or\r\nselected, and those which are unfavourable shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess\r\nany advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called\r\nNatural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea\r\nby the Survival of the Fittest. The term \"natural selection\" is in some\r\nrespects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be\r\ndisregarded after a little familiarity. No one objects to chemists speaking\r\nof \"elective affinity;\" and certainly an acid has no more choice in\r\ncombining with a base, than the conditions of life have in determining\r\nwhether or not a new form be selected or preserved. The term is so far a\r\ngood one as it brings into connection the production of domestic races by\r\nman's power of selection, and the natural preservation of varieties and\r\nspecies in a state of nature. For brevity sake I sometimes speak of natural\r\nselection as an intelligent power;--in the same way as astronomers speak of\r\nthe attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets, or as\r\nagriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of\r\nselection. In the one case, as in the other, selection does nothing without\r\nvariability, and this depends in some manner on the action of the\r\nsurrounding circumstances on the organism. I have, also, often personified\r\nthe word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but\r\nI mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural\r\nlaws,--and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can be\r\nsupported on each area, by great diversification or divergence in the\r\nstructure and constitution of its inhabitants. We have, also, seen that the\r\ncontinued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies\r\nthat each new variety has some advantage over others, inevitably leads to\r\nthe extermination of the older and less improved forms. These latter are\r\nalmost necessarily intermediate in structure, as well as in descent,\r\nbetween the last-produced forms and their original parent-species. Now, if\r\nwe suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in the\r\ncourse of time to produce other varieties, the principal of good being\r\nderived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the\r\npreservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences\r\ncharacteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater\r\ndifferences characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the\r\nolder intermediate forms, new species end by being distinctly defined\r\nobjects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that organic beings can be\r\nclassed by what is called a natural method in distinct groups--species\r\nunder genera, and genera under families.\r\n\r\nAs all the inhabitants of each country may be said, owing to their high\r\nrate of reproduction, to be striving to increase in numbers; as each form\r\ncomes into competition with many other forms in the struggle for life,--for\r\ndestroy any one and its place will be seized by others; as every part of\r\nthe organisation occasionally varies in some slight degree, and as natural\r\nselection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are\r\nadvantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being\r\nis exposed, no limit exists to the number, singularity, and perfection of\r\nthe contrivances and co-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal\r\nor a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in\r\nthe most intricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the\r\nphysical conditions of its home. Variations in the organisation will in\r\nsome cases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they\r\nwill be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical\r\nconditions and by correlation of growth.\r\n\r\nOn the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or\r\nnecessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of\r\norganisation. We are almost compelled to look at the specialisation or\r\ndifferentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or\r\neven sole standard of advancement; for by such division of labour each\r\nfunction of body and mind is better performed. And as natural selection\r\nacts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of\r\nstructure, and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more\r\nand more complex from the increasing number of different forms which\r\ninhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect\r\nstructure, we may confidently believe, that, on the whole, organisation\r\nadvances. Nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions\r\nof life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or unimproved; for what\r\nwould it profit an infusorial animalcule, for instance, or an intestinal\r\nworm, to become highly organised? Members of a high group might even\r\nbecome, and this apparently has often occurred, fitted for simpler\r\nconditions of life; and in this case natural selection would tend to\r\nsimplify or degrade the organisation, for complicated mechanism for simple\r\nactions would be useless or even disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nThe arguments opposed to the theory of Natural Selection, have been\r\ndiscussed in my 'Origin of Species,' as far as the size of that work\r\npermitted, under the following heads: the difficulty in understanding how\r\nvery simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps into\r\nhighly perfect and complex organs; the marvellous facts of Instinct; the\r\nwhole question of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence in our known\r\ngeological formations of innumerable links connecting all allied species.\r\nAlthough some of these difficulties are of great weight, we shall see that\r\nmany of them are explicable on the theory of natural selection, and are\r\notherwise inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis, and\r\nif it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to\r\nthe rank of a well-grounded theory. The undulations of the ether and even\r\nits existence are hypothetical, yet every one now admits the undulatory\r\ntheory of light. The principle of natural selection may be looked at as a\r\nmere hypothesis, but rendered in some degree probable by what we positively\r\nknow of the variability of organic beings in a state of nature,--by what we\r\npositively know of the struggle for existence, and the consequent almost\r\ninevitable preservation of favourable variations,--and from the analogical\r\nformation of domestic races. Now this hypothesis may be tested,--and this\r\nseems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of considering the whole\r\nquestion,--by trying whether it explains several large and independent\r\nclasses of facts; such as the geological succession of organic beings,\r\ntheir distribution in past and present times, and their mutual affinities\r\nand homologies. If the principle of natural selection does explain these\r\nand other large bodies of facts, it ought to be received. On the ordinary\r\nview of each species having been independently created, we gain no\r\nscientific explanation of any one of these facts. We can only say that it\r\nhas so pleased the Creator to command that the past and present inhabitants\r\nof the world should appear in a certain order and in certain areas; that He\r\nhas impressed on them the most extraordinary resemblances, and has classed\r\nthem in groups subordinate to groups. But by such statements we gain no new\r\nknowledge; we do not connect together facts and laws; we explain nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was the consideration of such large groups of facts as these which first\r\nled me to take up the present subject. When I visited during the voyage of\r\nH.M.S. \"Beagle,\" the Galapagos Archipelago, situated in the Pacific Ocean\r\nabout 500 miles from South America, I found myself surrounded by peculiar\r\nspecies of birds, reptiles, and plants, existing nowhere else in the world.\r\nYet they nearly all bore an American stamp. In the song of the mocking-\r\nthrush, in the harsh cry of the carrion-hawk, in the great candlestick-like\r\nopuntias, I clearly perceived the neighbourhood of America, though the\r\nislands were separated by so many miles of ocean from the mainland, and\r\ndiffered much in their geological constitution and climate. Still more\r\nsurprising was the fact that most of the inhabitants of each separate\r\nisland in this small archipelago were specifically different, though most\r\nclosely related to each other. The archipelago, with its innumerable\r\ncraters and bare streams of lava, appeared to be of recent origin; and thus\r\nI fancied myself brought near to the very act of creation. I often asked\r\nmyself how these many peculiar animals and plants had been produced: the\r\nsimplest answer seemed to be that the inhabitants of the several islands\r\nhad descended from each other, undergoing modification in the course of\r\ntheir descent; and that all the inhabitants of the archipelago were\r\ndescended from those of the nearest land, namely America, whence colonists\r\nwould naturally have been derived. But it long remained to me an\r\ninexplicable problem how the necessary degree of modification could have\r\nbeen effected, and it would have thus remained for ever, had I not studied\r\ndomestic productions, and thus acquired a just idea of the power of\r\nSelection. As soon as I had fully realised this idea, I saw, on reading\r\nMalthus on Population, that Natural Selection was the inevitable result of\r\nthe rapid increase of all organic beings; for I was prepared to appreciate\r\nthe struggle for existence by having long studied the habits of animals.\r\n\r\nBefore visiting the Galapagos I had collected many animals whilst\r\ntravelling from north to south on both sides of America, and everywhere,\r\nunder conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive,\r\nAmerican forms were met with--species replacing species of the same\r\npeculiar genera. Thus it was when the Cordilleras were ascended, or the\r\nthick tropical forests penetrated, or the fresh waters of America searched.\r\nSubsequently I visited other countries, which in all their conditions of\r\nlife were incomparably more like parts of South America, than the different\r\nparts of that continent are to each other; yet in these countries, as in\r\nAustralia or Southern Africa, the traveller cannot fail to be struck with\r\nthe entire difference of their productions. Again the reflection was forced\r\non me that community of descent from the early inhabitants of South America\r\nwould alone explain the wide prevalence of American types throughout that\r\nimmense area.\r\n\r\nTo exhume with one's own hands the bones of extinct and gigantic quadrupeds\r\nbrings the whole question of the succession of species vividly before one's\r\nmind; and I found in South America great pieces of tesselated armour\r\nexactly like, but on a magnificent scale, that covering the pigmy\r\narmadillo; I had found great teeth like those of the living sloth, and\r\nbones like those of the cavy. An analogous succession of allied forms had\r\nbeen previously observed in Australia. Here then we see the prevalence, as\r\nif by descent, in time as in space, of the same types in the same areas;\r\nand in neither the case does the similarity of the conditions by any means\r\nseem sufficient to account for the similarity of the forms of life. It is\r\nnotorious that the fossil remains of closely consecutive formations are\r\nclosely allied in structure, and we can at once understand the fact if they\r\nare closely allied by descent. The succession of the many distinct species\r\nof the same genus throughout the long series of geological formations seems\r\nto have been unbroken or continuous. New species come in gradually one by\r\none. Ancient and extinct forms of life are often intermediate in character,\r\nlike the words of a dead language with respect to its several offshoots or\r\nliving tongues. All these facts seemed to me to point to descent with\r\nmodification as the means of production of new species.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected\r\ntogether by the most singular and complex affinities, and can be classed in\r\ngroups under groups, in the same manner as varieties can be classed under\r\nspecies and sub-varieties under varieties, but with much higher grades of\r\ndifference. These complex affinities and the rules for classification,\r\nreceive a rational explanation on the theory of descent, combined with the\r\nprinciple of natural selection, which entails divergence of character and\r\nthe extinction of intermediate forms. How inexplicable is the similar\r\npattern of the hand of a man, the foot of a dog, the wing of a bat, the\r\nflipper of a seal, on the doctrine of independent acts of creation! how\r\nsimply explained on the principle of the natural selection of successive\r\nslight variations in the diverging descendants from a single progenitor! So\r\nit is with certain parts or organs in the same individual animal or plant,\r\nfor instance, the jaws and legs of a crab, or the petals, stamens, and\r\npistils of a flower. During the many changes to which in the course of time\r\norganic beings have been subjected, certain organs or parts have\r\noccasionally become at first of little use and ultimately superfluous; and\r\nthe retention of such parts in a rudimentary and useless condition is\r\nintelligible on the theory of descent. It can be shown that modifications\r\nof structure are generally inherited by the offspring at the same age at\r\nwhich each successive variation appeared in the parents; it can further be\r\nshown that variations do not commonly supervene at a very early period of\r\nembryonic growth, and on these two principles we can understand that most\r\nwonderful fact in the whole circuit of natural history, namely, the close\r\nsimilarity of the embryos within the same great class--for instance, those\r\nof mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish.\r\n\r\nIt is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which has\r\nconvinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means of\r\nnatural selection is in the main true. These facts have as yet received no\r\nexplanation on the theory of independent Creation; they cannot be grouped\r\ntogether under one point of view, but each has to be considered as an\r\nultimate fact. As the first origin of life on this earth, as well as the\r\ncontinued life of each individual, is at present quite beyond the scope of\r\nscience, I do not wish to lay much stress on the greater simplicity of the\r\nview of a few forms or of only one form having been originally created,\r\ninstead of innumerable miraculous creations having been necessary at\r\ninnumerable periods; though this more simple view accords well with\r\nMaupertuis's philosophical axiom of \"least action.\"\r\n\r\nIn considering how far the theory of natural selection may be extended,\r\n--that is, in determining from how many progenitors the inhabitants of the\r\nworld have descended,--we may conclude that at least all the members of the\r\nsame class have descended from a single ancestor. A number of organic\r\nbeings are included in the same class, because they present, independently\r\nof their habits of life, the same fundamental type of structure, and\r\nbecause they graduate into each other. Moreover, members of the same class\r\ncan in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an early embryonic age.\r\nThese facts can be explained on the belief of their descent from a common\r\nform; therefore it may be safely admitted that all the members of the same\r\nclass are descended from one progenitor. But as the members of quite\r\ndistinct classes have something in common in structure and much in common\r\nin constitution, analogy would lead us one step further, and to infer as\r\nprobable that all living creatures are descended from a single prototype.\r\n\r\nI hope that the reader will pause before coming to any final and hostile\r\nconclusion on the theory of natural selection. The reader may consult my\r\n'Origin of Species' for a general sketch of the whole subject; but in that\r\nwork he has to take many statements on trust. In considering the theory of\r\nnatural selection, he will assuredly meet with weighty difficulties, but\r\nthese difficulties relate chiefly to subjects--such as the degree of\r\nperfection of the geological record, the means of distribution, the\r\npossibility of transitions in organs, etc.--on which we are confessedly\r\nignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. If we are much more ignorant\r\nthan is generally supposed, most of these difficulties wholly disappear.\r\nLet the reader reflect on the difficulty of looking at whole classes of\r\nfacts from a new point of view. Let him observe how slowly, but surely, the\r\nnoble views of Lyell on the gradual changes now in progress on the earth's\r\nsurface have been accepted as sufficient to account for all that we see in\r\nits past history. The present action of natural selection may seem more or\r\nless probable; but I believe in the truth of the theory, because it\r\ncollects, under one point of view, and gives a rational explanation of,\r\nmany apparently independent classes of facts. (Introduction/4. In treating\r\nthe several subjects included in the present and my other works I have\r\ncontinually been led to ask for information from many zoologists,\r\nbotanists, geologists, breeders of animals, and horticulturists, and I have\r\ninvariably received from them the most generous assistance. Without such\r\naid I could have effected little. I have repeatedly applied for information\r\nand specimens to foreigners, and to British merchants and officers of the\r\nGovernment residing in distant lands, and, with the rarest exceptions, I\r\nhave received prompt, open-handed, and valuable assistance. I cannot\r\nexpress too strongly my obligations to the many persons who have assisted\r\nme, and who, I am convinced, would be equally willing to assist others in\r\nany scientific investigation.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.I.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS.\r\n\r\nANCIENT VARIETIES OF THE DOG.\r\nRESEMBLANCE OF DOMESTIC DOGS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES TO NATIVE CANINE SPECIES.\r\nANIMALS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH MAN AT FIRST FEARLESS.\r\nDOGS RESEMBLING WOLVES AND JACKALS.\r\nHABIT OF BARKING ACQUIRED AND LOST.\r\nFERAL DOGS.\r\nTAN-COLOURED EYE-SPOTS.\r\nPERIOD OF GESTATION.\r\nOFFENSIVE ODOUR.\r\nFERTILITY OF THE RACES WHEN CROSSED.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE SEVERAL RACES IN PART DUE TO DESCENT FROM DISTINCT\r\nSPECIES.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE SKULL AND TEETH.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE BODY, IN CONSTITUTION.\r\nFEW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN FIXED BY SELECTION.\r\nDIRECT ACTION OF CLIMATE.\r\nWATER-DOGS WITH PALMATED FEET.\r\nHISTORY OF THE CHANGES WHICH CERTAIN ENGLISH RACES OF THE DOG HAVE\r\nGRADUALLY UNDERGONE THROUGH SELECTION.\r\nEXTINCTION OF THE LESS IMPROVED SUB-BREEDS.\r\n\r\nCATS, CROSSED WITH SEVERAL SPECIES.\r\nDIFFERENT BREEDS FOUND ONLY IN SEPARATED COUNTRIES.\r\nDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE.\r\nFERAL CATS.\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe first and chief point of interest in this chapter is, whether the\r\nnumerous domesticated varieties of the dog have descended from a single\r\nwild species, or from several. Some authors believe that all have descended\r\nfrom the wolf, or from the jackal, or from an unknown and extinct species.\r\nOthers again believe, and this of late has been the favourite tenet, that\r\nthey have descended from several species, extinct and recent, more or less\r\ncommingled together. We shall probably never be able to ascertain their\r\norigin with certainty. Palaeontology (1/1. Owen 'British Fossil Mammals'\r\npages 123 to 133. Pictet 'Traite de Pal.' 1853 tome 1 page 202. De\r\nBlainville in his 'Osteographie, Canidae' page 142 has largely discussed\r\nthe whole subject, and concludes that the extinct parent of all\r\ndomesticated dogs came nearest to the wolf in organisation, and to the\r\njackal in habits. See also Boyd Dawkins, 'Cave Hunting' 1874 page 131 etc.\r\nand his other publications. Jeitteles has discussed in great detail the\r\ncharacter of the breeds of pre-historic dogs: 'Die vorgeschichtlichen\r\nAlterthumer der Stadt Olmutz' II. Theil, 1872 page 44 to end.) does not\r\nthrow much light on the question, owing, on the one hand, to the close\r\nsimilarity of the skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals,\r\nand owing, on the other hand, to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of\r\nthe several breeds of the domestic dogs. It seems, however, that remains\r\nhave been found in the later tertiary deposits more like those of a large\r\ndog than of a wolf, which favours the belief of De Blainville that our dogs\r\nare the descendants of a single extinct species. On the other hand, some\r\nauthors go so far as to assert that every chief domestic breed must have\r\nhad its wild prototype. This latter view is extremely improbable: it allows\r\nnothing for variation; it passes over the almost monstrous character of\r\nsome of the breeds; and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number\r\nof species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog; whereas we\r\nplainly see that wild members of the dog-family are extirpated by human\r\nagency with much difficulty; even so recently as 1710 the wolf existed in\r\nso small an island as Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs have\r\ndescended from more than one wild species are as follows. (1/2. Pallas, I\r\nbelieve, originated this doctrine in 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 Part\r\n2. Ehrenberg has advocated it, as may be seen in De Blainville's\r\n'Osteographie' page 79. It has been carried to an extreme extent by Col.\r\nHamilton Smith in the 'Naturalist Library' volumes 9 and 10. Mr. W.C.\r\nMartin adopts it in his excellent 'History of the Dog' 1845; as does Dr.\r\nMorton, as well as Nott and Gliddon, in the United States. Prof. Low, in\r\nhis 'Domesticated Animals' 1845 page 666, comes to this same conclusion. No\r\none has argued on this side with more clearness and force than the late\r\nJames Wilson, of Edinburgh, in various papers read before the Highland\r\nAgricultural and Wernerian Societies. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\r\n('Hist. Nat. Gen.' 1860 tome 3 page 107), though he believes that most dogs\r\nhave descended from the jackal, yet inclines to the belief that some are\r\ndescended from the wolf. Prof. Gervais ('Hist. Nat. Mamm.' 1855 tome 2 page\r\n69, referring to the view that all the domestic races are the modified\r\ndescendants of a single species, after a long discussion, says, \"Cette\r\nopinion est, suivant nous du moins, la moins probable.\") Firstly, the great\r\ndifference between the several breeds; but this will appear of\r\ncomparatively little weight, after we shall have seen how great are the\r\ndifferences between the several races of various domesticated animals which\r\ncertainly have descended from a single parent-form. Secondly, the more\r\nimportant fact, that, at the most anciently known historical periods,\r\nseveral breeds of the dog existed, very unlike each other, and closely\r\nresembling or identical with breeds still alive.\r\n\r\nWe will briefly run back through the historical records. The materials are\r\nremarkably deficient between the fourteenth century and the Roman classical\r\nperiod. (1/3. Berjeau 'The Varieties of the Dog; in old Sculptures and\r\nPictures' 1863. 'Der Hund' von Dr. F.L. Walther, Giessen 1817 s. 48: this\r\nauthor seems carefully to have studied all classical works on the subject.\r\nSee also Volz 'Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte' Leipzig 1852 s. 115, 'Youatt\r\non the Dog' 1845 page 6. A very full history is given by De Blainville in\r\nhis 'Osteographie, Canidae.') At this latter period various breeds, namely\r\nhounds, house-dogs, lapdogs, etc, existed; but, as Dr. Walther has\r\nremarked, it is impossible to recognise the greater number with any\r\ncertainty. Youatt, however, gives a drawing of a beautiful sculpture of two\r\ngreyhound puppies from the Villa of Antoninus. On an Assyrian monument,\r\nabout 640 B.C.,an enormous mastiff (1/4. I have seen drawings of this dog\r\nfrom the tomb of the son of Esar Haddon, and clay models in the British\r\nMuseum. Nott and Gliddon, in their 'Types of Mankind' 1854 page 393, give a\r\ncopy of these drawings. This dog has been called a Thibetan mastiff, but\r\nMr. H.A. Oldfield, who is familiar with the so-called Thibet mastiff, and\r\nhas examined the drawings in the British Museum, informs me that he\r\nconsiders them different.) is figured; and according to Sir H. Rawlinson\r\n(as I was informed at the British Museum), similar dogs are still imported\r\ninto this same country. I have looked through the magnificent works of\r\nLepsius and Rosellini, and on the Egyptian monuments from the fourth to the\r\ntwelfth dynasties (i.e. from about 3400 B.C. to 2100 B.C.) several\r\nvarieties of the dog are represented; most of them are allied to\r\ngreyhounds; at the later of these periods a dog resembling a hound is\r\nfigured, with drooping ears, but with a longer back and more pointed head\r\nthan in our hounds. There is, also, a turnspit, with short and crooked\r\nlegs, closely resembling the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity\r\nis so common with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even,\r\naccording to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to\r\nlook at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits: Colonel\r\nSykes (1/5. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' July 12, 1831.) also has described an\r\nIndian pariah dog as presenting the same monstrous character. The most\r\nancient dog represented on the Egyptian monuments is one of the most\r\nsingular; it resembles a greyhound, but has long pointed ears and a short\r\ncurled tail: a closely allied variety still exists in Northern Africa; for\r\nMr. E. Vernon Harcourt (1/6. 'Sporting in Algeria' page 51.) states that\r\nthe Arab boar-hound is \"an eccentric hieroglyphic animal, such as Cheops\r\nonce hunted with, somewhat resembling the rough Scotch deer-hound; their\r\ntails are curled tight round on their backs, and their ears stick out at\r\nright angles.\" With this most ancient variety a pariah-like dog coexisted.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, at a period between four and five thousand years ago,\r\nvarious breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, common hounds, mastiffs,\r\nhouse-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less closely\r\nresembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient evidence that\r\nany of these ancient dogs belonged to the same identical sub-varieties with\r\nour present dogs. (1/7. Berjeau gives facsimiles of the Egyptian drawings.\r\nMr. C.L. Martin in his 'History of the Dog' 1845 copies several figures\r\nfrom the Egyptian monuments, and speaks with much confidence with respect\r\nto their identity with still living dogs. Messrs. Nott and Gliddon ('Types\r\nof Mankind' 1854 page 388) give still more numerous figures. Mr. Gliddon\r\nasserts that a curl-tailed greyhound, like that represented on the most\r\nancient monuments, is common in Borneo; but the Rajah, Sir J. Brooke,\r\ninforms me that no such dog exists there.) As long as man was believed to\r\nhave existed on this earth only about 6000 years, this fact of the great\r\ndiversity of the breeds at so early a period was an argument of much weight\r\nthat they had proceeded from several wild sources, for there would not have\r\nbeen sufficient time for their divergence and modification. But now that we\r\nknow, from the discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of\r\nextinct animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical\r\nchanges, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period, and\r\nbearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess domestic dogs, the\r\nargument from insufficient time falls away greatly in value.\r\n\r\nLong before the period of any historical record the dog was domesticated in\r\nEurope. In the Danish Middens of the Neolithic or Newer Stone period, bones\r\nof a canine animal are embedded, and Steenstrup ingeniously argues that\r\nthese belonged to a domestic dog; for a very large proportion of the bones\r\nof birds preserved in the refuse consists of long bones, which it was found\r\non trial dogs cannot devour. (1/8. These, and the following facts on the\r\nDanish remains, are taken from M. Morlot's most interesting memoir in 'Soc.\r\nVaudoise des Sc. Nat.' tome 6 1860 pages 281, 299, 320.) This ancient dog\r\nwas succeeded in Denmark during the Bronze period by a larger kind,\r\npresenting certain differences, and this again during the Iron period, by a\r\nstill larger kind. In Switzerland, we hear from Prof. Rutimeyer (1/9. 'Die\r\nFauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 117, 162.), that during the Neolithic period\r\na domesticated dog of middle size existed, which in its skull was about\r\nequally remote from the wolf and jackal, and partook of the characters of\r\nour hounds and setters or spaniels (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund). Rutimeyer\r\ninsists strongly on the constancy of form during a very long period of time\r\nof this the most ancient known dog. During the Bronze period a larger dog\r\nappeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same age in\r\nDenmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties of the dog were found by\r\nSchmerling in a cave (1/10. De Blainville 'Osteographie, Canidae.'); but\r\ntheir age cannot be positively determined.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a single race, remarkably constant in form during the\r\nwhole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with what we see\r\nof the changes which the races underwent during the period of the\r\nsuccessive Egyptian monuments, and in contrast with our existing dogs. The\r\ncharacter of this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by\r\nRutimeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties have descended\r\nfrom an unknown and extinct form. But we should not forget that we know\r\nnothing with respect to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the\r\nworld. The succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and\r\nDenmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering tribes\r\nbringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with the belief that\r\ndifferent wild canine animals were domesticated in different regions.\r\nIndependently of the immigration of new races of man, we know from the\r\nwide-spread presence of bronze, composed of an alloy of tin, how much\r\ncommerce there must have been throughout Europe at an extremely remote\r\nperiod, and dogs would then probably have been bartered. At the present\r\ntime, amongst the savages of the interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are\r\nconsidered the best trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed which they\r\nbarter at a high price with other tribes. (1/11. Sir R. Schomburgk has\r\ngiven me information on this head. See also 'Journal of R. Geographical\r\nSoc.' volume 13 1843 page 65.)\r\n\r\nThe main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being the\r\ndescendants of distinct wild stocks, is their resemblance in various\r\ncountries to distinct species still existing there. It must, however, be\r\nadmitted that the comparison between the wild and domesticated animal has\r\nbeen made but in few cases with sufficient exactness. Before entering on\r\ndetails, it will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in\r\nthe belief that several canine species have been domesticated. Members of\r\nthe dog family inhabit nearly the whole world; and several species agree\r\npretty closely in habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs.\r\nMr. Galton has shown (1/12. 'Domestication of Animals' Ethnological Soc.\r\nDecember 22, 1863.) how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of\r\nall kinds. Social animals are the most easily subjugated by man, and\r\nseveral species of Canidae hunt in packs. It deserves notice, as bearing on\r\nother animals as well as on the dog, that at an extremely ancient period,\r\nwhen man first entered any country, the animals living there would have\r\nfelt no instinctive or inherited fear of him, and would consequently have\r\nbeen tamed far more easily than at present. For instance, when the Falkland\r\nIslands were first visited by man, the large wolf-like dog (Canis\r\nantarcticus) fearlessly came to meet Byron's sailors, who, mistaking this\r\nignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the water to avoid them: even\r\nrecently a man, by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a knife in the\r\nother, could sometimes stick them at night. On a island in the Sea of Aral,\r\nwhen first discovered by Butakoff, the saigak antelopes, which are\r\n\"generally very timid and watchful, did not fly from us, but on the\r\ncontrary looked at us with a sort of curiosity.\" So, again, on the shores\r\nof the Mauritius, the manatee was not at first in the least afraid of man,\r\nand thus it has been in several quarters of the world with seals and the\r\nmorse. I have elsewhere shown (1/13. 'Journal of Researches' etc. 1845 page\r\n393. With respect to Canis antarcticus, see page 193. For the case of the\r\nantelope, see 'Journal Royal Geographical Soc.' volume 23 page 94.) how\r\nslowly the native birds of several islands have acquired and inherited a\r\nsalutary dread of man: at the Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the\r\nmuzzle of my gun hawks from a branch, and held out a pitcher of water for\r\nother birds to alight on and drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom\r\nbeen disturbed by man, dread him no more than do our English birds, the\r\ncows, or horses grazing in the fields.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration that several canine species evince (as\r\nwill be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to\r\nbreed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is\r\none of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly, savages set the highest\r\nvalue, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on dogs: even half-\r\ntamed animals are highly useful to them: the Indians of North America cross\r\ntheir half-wild dogs with wolves, and thus render them even wilder than\r\nbefore, but bolder: the savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and use\r\nthe whelps of two wild species of Canis, as do the savages of Australia\r\nthose of the wild Dingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once trained a\r\nwild Dingo puppy to drive cattle, and found it very useful. From these\r\nseveral considerations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that\r\nman might have domesticated various canine species in different countries.\r\nIt would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been\r\ndomesticated throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWe will now enter into details. The accurate and sagacious Richardson says,\r\n\"The resemblance between the Northern American wolves (Canis lupus, var.\r\noccidentalis) and the domestic dogs of the Indians is so great that the\r\nsize and strength of the wolf seems to be the only difference. I have more\r\nthan once mistaken a band of wolves for the dogs of a party of Indians; and\r\nthe howl of the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same\r\nkey that even the practised ear of the Indian fails at times to\r\ndiscriminate them.' He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs are not\r\nonly extremely like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in form and\r\ncolour, but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has often seen in his\r\nteams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character on which some naturalists\r\nlay great stress), the drooping tail, and scared look of the wolf. In\r\ndisposition the Esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves, and, according to\r\nDr. Hayes, they are capable of no attachment to man, and are so savage that\r\nwhen hungry they will attack even their masters. According to Kane they\r\nreadily become feral. Their affinity is so close with wolves that they\r\nfrequently cross with them, and the Indians take the whelps of wolves \"to\r\nimprove the breed of their dogs.\" The half-bred wolves sometimes (Lamare-\r\nPicquot) cannot be tamed, \"though this case is rare;\" but they do not\r\nbecome thoroughly well broken in till the second or third generation. These\r\nfacts show that there can be but little, if any, sterility between the\r\nEsquimaux dog and the wolf, for otherwise they would not be used to improve\r\nthe breed. As Dr. Hayes says of these dogs, \"reclaimed wolves they\r\ndoubtless are.\" (1/14. The authorities for the foregoing statements are as\r\nfollow:--Richardson in 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' 1829 pages 64, 75; Dr.\r\nKane 'Arctic Explorations' 1856 volume 1 pages 398, 455; Dr. Hayes 'Arctic\r\nBoat Journey' 1860 page 167. Franklin's 'Narrative' volume 1 page 269,\r\ngives the case of three whelps of a black wolf being carried away by the\r\nIndians. Parry, Richardson, and others, give accounts of wolves and dogs\r\nnaturally crossing in the eastern parts of North America. Seeman in his\r\n'Voyage of H.M.S. \"Herald\"' 1853 volume 2 page 26, says the wolf is often\r\ncaught by the Esquimaux for the purpose of crossing with their dogs, and\r\nthus adding to their size and strength. M. Lamare-Picquot in 'Bull. de la\r\nSoc. d'Acclimat.' tome 7 1860 page 148, gives a good account of the half-\r\nbred Esquimaux dogs.)\r\n\r\nNorth America is inhabited by a second kind of wolf, the prairie-wolf\r\n(Canis latrans), which is now looked at by all naturalists as specifically\r\ndistinct from the common wolf; and is, according to Mr. J.K. Lord, in some\r\nrespects intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox. Sir J.\r\nRichardson, after describing the Hare Indian dog, which differs in many\r\nrespects from the Esquimaux dog, says, \"It bears the same relation to the\r\nprairie-wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf.\" He could,\r\nin fact, detect no marked difference between them; and Messrs. Nott and\r\nGliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance. The dogs\r\nderived from the above two aboriginal sources cross together and with the\r\nwild wolves, at least with the C. occidentalis, and with European dogs. In\r\nFlorida, according to Bartram, the black wolf-dog of the Indians differs in\r\nnothing from the wolves of that country except in barking. (1/15. 'Fauna\r\nBoreali-Americana' 1829 pages 73, 78, 80. Nott and Gliddon, 'Types of\r\nMankind' page 383. The naturalist and traveller Bartram is quoted by\r\nHamilton Smith in 'Naturalist Lib.' volume 10 page 156. A Mexican domestic\r\ndog seems also to resemble a wild dog of the same country; but this may be\r\nthe prairie-wolf. Another capable judge, Mr. J.K. Lord ('The Naturalist in\r\nVancouver Island' 1866 volume 2 page 218), says that the Indian dog of the\r\nSpokans, near the Rocky Mountains, \"is beyond all question nothing more\r\nthan a tamed Cayote or prairie-wolf,\" or Canis latrans.)\r\n\r\nTurning to the southern parts of the new world, Columbus found two kinds of\r\ndogs in the West Indies; and Fernandez (1/16. I quote this from Mr. R.\r\nHill's excellent account of the Alco or domestic dog of Mexico, in Gosse's\r\n'Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica' 1851 page 329.) describes three in\r\nMexico: some of these native dogs were dumb--that is, did not bark. In\r\nGuiana it has been known since the time of Buffon that the natives cross\r\ntheir dogs with an aboriginal species, apparently the Canis cancrivorus.\r\nSir R. Schomburgk, who has so carefully explored these regions, writes to\r\nme, \"I have been repeatedly told by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near\r\nthe coast, that they cross their dogs with a wild species to improve the\r\nbreed, and individual dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled\r\nthe C. cancrivorus much more than the common breed. It is but seldom that\r\nthe Indians keep the C. cancrivorus for domestic purposes, nor is the Ai,\r\nanother species of wild dog, and which I consider to be identical with the\r\nDusicyon silvestris of H. Smith, now much used by the Arecunas for the\r\npurpose of hunting. The dogs of the Taruma Indians are quite distinct, and\r\nresemble Buffon's St. Domingo greyhound.\" It thus appears that the natives\r\nof Guiana have partially domesticated two aboriginal species, and still\r\ncross their dogs with them; these two species belong to a quite different\r\ntype from the North American and European wolves. A careful observer,\r\nRengger (1/17. 'Naturgeschichte der Saugethiere von Paraguay' 1830 s.\r\n151.), gives reasons for believing that a hairless dog was domesticated\r\nwhen America was first visited by Europeans: some of these dogs in Paraguay\r\nare still dumb, and Tschudi (1/18. Quoted in Humboldt 'Aspects of Nature'\r\n(English translation) volume 1 page 108.) states that they suffer from cold\r\nin the Cordillera. This naked dog is, however quite distinct from that\r\nfound preserved in the ancient Peruvian burial-places, and described by\r\nTschudi, under the name of Canis ingae, as withstanding cold well and as\r\nbarking. It is not known whether these two distinct kinds of dog are the\r\ndescendants of native species, and it might be argued that when man first\r\nmigrated into America he brought with him from the Asiatic continent dogs\r\nwhich had not learned to bark; but this view does not seem probable, as the\r\nnatives along the line of their march from the north reclaimed, as we have\r\nseen, at least two N. American species of Canidae.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Old World, some European dogs closely resemble the wolf;\r\nthus the shepherd dog of the plains of Hungary is white or reddish-brown,\r\nhas a sharp nose, short, erect ears, shaggy coat, and bushy tail, and so\r\nmuch resembles a wolf that Mr. Paget, who gives this description, says he\r\nhas known a Hungarian mistake a wolf for one of his own dogs. Jeitteles,\r\nalso, remarks on the close similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf.\r\nShepherd dogs in Italy must anciently have closely resembled wolves, for\r\nColumella (vii. 12) advises that white dogs be kept, adding, \"pastor album\r\nprobat, ne pro lupo canem feriat.\" Several accounts have been given of dogs\r\nand wolves crossing naturally; and Pliny asserts that the Gauls tied their\r\nfemale dogs in the woods that they might cross with wolves. (1/19. Paget\r\n'Travels in Hungary and Transylvania' volume 1 page 501. Jeitteles 'Fauna\r\nHungariae Superioris' 1862 s. 13. See Pliny 'History of the World' (English\r\ntranslation) 8th book ch. 40 about the Gauls crossing their dogs. See also\r\nAristotle 'Hist. Animal.' Lib. 8 c. 28. For good evidence about wolves and\r\ndogs naturally crossing near the Pyrenees, see M. Mauduyt 'Du Loup et de\r\nses Races' Poitiers, 1851; also Pallas in 'Acta Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780\r\npart 2 page 94.) The European wolf differs slightly from that of North\r\nAmerica, and has been ranked by many naturalists as a distinct species. The\r\ncommon wolf of India is also by some esteemed as a third species, and here\r\nagain we find a marked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain\r\ndistricts of India and the Indian wolf. (1/20. I give this on excellent\r\nauthority, namely Mr. Blyth (under the signature of Zoophilus) in the\r\n'Indian Sporting Review' October 1856 page 134. Mr. Blyth states that he\r\nwas struck with the resemblance between a brush-tailed race of pariah-dogs,\r\nnorth-west of Cawnpore, and the Indian wolf. He gives corroborative\r\nevidence with respect to the dogs of the valley of the Nerbudda.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1/21. For numerous\r\nand interesting details on the resemblance of dogs and jackals see Isid.\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' 1860 tome 3 page 101. See also\r\n'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' par Prof. Gervais, 1855 tome 2 page 60.) says\r\nthat not one constant difference can be pointed out between their structure\r\nand that of the smaller races of dogs. They agree closely in habits:\r\njackals, when tamed and called by their master, wag their tails, lick his\r\nhands, crouch, and throw themselves on their backs; they smell at the tails\r\nof other dogs, and void their urine sideways; they roll on carrion or on\r\nanimals which they have killed; and, lastly, when in high spirits, they run\r\nround in circles or in a figure of eight, with their tails between their\r\nlegs. (1/22. Also Guldenstadt 'Nov. Comment. Acad. Petrop.' tome 20 pro\r\nanno 1775 page 449. Also Salvin in 'Land and Water' October 1869.) A number\r\nof excellent naturalists, from the time of Guldenstadt to that of\r\nEhrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have expressed themselves in the\r\nstrongest terms with respect to the resemblance of the half-domestic dogs\r\nof Asia and Egypt to jackals. M. Nordmann, for instance, says, \"Les chiens\r\nd'Awhasie ressemblent etonnamment a des chacals.\" Ehrenberg (1/23. Quoted\r\nby De Blainville in his 'Osteographie, Canidae' pages 79, 98.) asserts that\r\nthe domestic dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain mummied dogs, have for their\r\nwild type a species of wolf (C. lupaster) of the country; whereas the\r\ndomestic dogs of Nubia and certain other mummied dogs have the closest\r\nrelation to a wild species of the same country, viz. C. sabbar, which is\r\nonly a form of the common jackal. Pallas asserts that jackals and dogs\r\nsometimes naturally cross in the East; and a case is on record in Algeria.\r\n(1/24. See Pallas in 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 part 2 page 91. For\r\nAlgeria, see Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 177.\r\nIn both countries it is the male jackal which pairs with female domestic\r\ndogs.) The greater number of naturalists divide the jackals of Asia and\r\nAfrica into several species, but some few rank them all as one.\r\n\r\nI may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of Guinea are fox-like\r\nanimals, and are dumb. (1/25. John Barbut 'Description of the Coast of\r\nGuinea in 1746.') On the east coast of Africa, between latitude 4 deg and 6\r\ndeg south, and about ten days' journey in the interior, a semi-domestic\r\ndog, as the Rev. S. Erhardt informs me, is kept, which the natives assert\r\nis derived from a similar wild animal. Lichtenstein (1/26. 'Travels in\r\nSouth Africa' volume 2 page 272.) says that the dogs of the Bosjemans\r\npresent a striking resemblance even in colour (excepting the black stripe\r\ndown the back) with the C. mesomelas of South Africa. Mr. E. Layard informs\r\nme that he has seen a Caffre dog which closely resembled an Esquimaux dog.\r\nIn Australia the Dingo is both domesticated and wild; though this animal\r\nmay have been introduced aboriginally by man, yet it must be considered as\r\nalmost an endemic form, for its remains have been found in a similar state\r\nof preservation and associated with extinct mammals, so that its\r\nintroduction must have been ancient. (1/27. Selwyn, Geology of Victoria;\r\n'Journal of Geolog. Soc.' volume 14 1858 page 536 and volume 16 1860 page\r\n148; and Prof. M'Coy in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' (3rd series) volume\r\n9 1862 page 147. The Dingo differs from the dogs of the central Polynesian\r\nislands. Dieffenbach remarks ('Travels' volume 2 page 45) that the native\r\nNew Zealand dog also differs from the Dingo.)\r\n\r\nFrom this resemblance of the half-domesticated dogs in several countries to\r\nthe wild species still living there,--from the facility with which they can\r\noften be crossed together,--from even half-tamed animals being so much\r\nvalued by savages,--and from the other circumstances previously remarked on\r\nwhich favour their domestication, it is highly probable that the domestic\r\ndogs of the world are descended from two well-defined species of wolf (viz.\r\nC. lupus and C. latrans), and from two or three other doubtful species\r\n(namely, the European, Indian, and North African wolves); from at least one\r\nor two South American canine species; from several races or species of\r\njackal; and perhaps from one or more extinct species. Although it is\r\npossible or even probable that domesticated dogs, introduced into any\r\ncountry and bred there for many generations, might acquire some of the\r\ncharacters proper to the aboriginal Canidae of the country, we can hardly\r\nthus account for introduced dogs having given rise to two breeds in the\r\nsame country, resembling two of its aboriginal species, as in the above-\r\ngiven cases of Guiana and of North America. (1/28. These latter remarks\r\nafford, I think, a sufficient answer to some criticisms by Mr. Wallace, on\r\nthe multiple origin of dogs, given in Lyell's 'Principles of Geology' 1872\r\nvolume 2 page 295.)\r\n\r\nIt cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having been\r\nanciently domesticated, that these animals are tamed with difficulty: facts\r\nhave been already given on this head, but I may add that the young of the\r\nCanis primaevus of India were tamed by Mr. Hodgson (1/29. 'Proceedings\r\nZoological Soc.' 1833 page 112. See also on the taming of the common wolf,\r\nL. Lloyd 'Scandinavian Adventures' 1854 volume 1 page 460. With respect to\r\nthe jackal, see Prof. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome 2 page 61. With\r\nrespect to the aguara of Paraguay see Rengger's work.), and became as\r\nsensible of caresses, and manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting\r\ndog of the same age. There is not much difference, as we have already shown\r\nand shall further see, in habits between the domestic dogs of the North\r\nAmerican Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the Eastern\r\npariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run wild in various\r\ncountries and the several natural species of the family. The habit of\r\nbarking, however, which is almost universal with domesticated dogs, forms\r\nan exception, as it does not characterise a single natural species of the\r\nfamily, though I am assured that the Canis latrans of North America utters\r\na noise which closely approaches a bark. But this habit is soon lost by\r\ndogs when they become feral and is soon reacquired when they are again\r\ndomesticated. The case of the wild dogs on the island of Juan Fernandez\r\nhaving become dumb has often been quoted, and there is reason to believe\r\n(130. Roulin, in 'Mem. present. par divers Savans' tome 6 page 341.) that\r\nthe dumbness ensued in the course of thirty-three years; on the other hand,\r\ndogs taken from this island by Ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of\r\nbarking. The Mackenzie-river dogs, of the Canis latrans type, when brought\r\nto England, never learned to bark properly; but one born in the Zoological\r\nGardens (1/31. Martin 'History of the Dog' page 14.) \"made his voice sound\r\nas loudly as any other dog of the same age and size.\" According to\r\nProfessor Nillson (1/32. Quoted by L. Lloyd in 'Field Sports of North of\r\nEurope' volume 1 page 387.), a wolf-whelp reared by a bitch barks. I.\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire exhibited a jackal which barked with the same tone\r\nas any common dog. (1/33. Quatrefages 'Soc. d'Acclimat.' May 11, 1863 page\r\n7.) An interesting account has been given by Mr. G. Clarke (1/34. 'Annals\r\nand Mag of Nat. Hist.' volume 15 1845 page 140.) of some dogs run wild on\r\nJuan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean; \"they had entirely lost the faculty of\r\nbarking; they had no inclination for the company of other dogs, nor did\r\nthey acquire their voice\" during a captivity of several months. On the\r\nisland they \"congregate in vast packs, and catch sea-birds with as much\r\naddress as foxes could display.\" The feral dogs of La Plata have not become\r\ndumb; they are of large size, hunt singly or in packs, and burrow holes for\r\ntheir young. (1/35. Azara 'Voyages dans l'Amer. Merid.' tome 1 page 381;\r\nhis account is fully confirmed by Rengger. Quatrefages gives an account of\r\na bitch brought from Jerusalem to France which burrowed a hole and littered\r\nin it. See 'Discours, Exposition des Races Canines' 1865 page 3.) In these\r\nhabits the feral dogs of La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of\r\nwhich hunt either singly or in packs, and burrow holes. (1/36. With respect\r\nto wolves burrowing holes see Richardson 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' page 64;\r\nand Bechstein 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 1 s. 617.) These feral dogs\r\nhave not become uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La\r\nPlata. (1/37. See Poeppig 'Reise in Chile' b. 1 s. 290; Mr. G. Clarke, as\r\nabove; and Rengger, s. 155.) In Cuba the feral dogs are described by\r\nPoeppig as nearly all mouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes.\r\nIn St. Domingo, Col. Ham. Smith says (1/38. Dogs, 'Nat. Library' volume 10\r\npage 121; an endemic South American dog seems also to have become feral in\r\nthis island. See Gosse 'Jamaica' page 340.) that the feral dogs are very\r\nlarge, like greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and\r\nlarge light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently\r\nnaturalised in Australia, \"varies considerably in colour,\" as I am informed\r\nby Mr. P.P. King: a half-bred Dingo reared in England (1/39. Low\r\n'Domesticated Animals' page 650.) showed signs of wishing to burrow.\r\n\r\n[From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral state\r\ngives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal parent-species.\r\nOne fact, however, with respect to the colouring of domestic dogs, I at one\r\ntime hoped might have thrown some light on their origin; and it is worth\r\ngiving, as showing how colouring follows laws, even in so anciently and\r\nthoroughly domesticated an animal as the dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured\r\nfeet, whatever breed they may belong to, almost invariably have a tan-\r\ncoloured spot on the upper and inner corners of each eye, and their lips\r\nare generally thus coloured. I have seen only two exceptions to this rule,\r\nnamely, in a spaniel and terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a\r\nlighter, yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white,\r\nand in a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for\r\nme a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or\r\nblack and white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three were\r\nred and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots over their\r\neyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour, they strongly\r\ntend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having seen four spaniels, a\r\nsetter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel, and some fox-hounds,\r\ncoloured black and white, with not a trace of tan-colour, excepting the\r\nspots over the eyes, and sometimes a little on the feet. These latter\r\ncases, and many others, show plainly that the colour of the feet and the\r\neye-spots are in some way correlated. I have noticed, in various breeds,\r\nevery gradation, from the whole face being tan-coloured, to a complete ring\r\nround the eyes, to a minute spot over the inner and upper corners. The\r\nspots occur in various sub-breeds of terriers and spaniels; in setters; in\r\nhounds of various kinds, including the turnspit-like German badger-hound;\r\nin shepherd dogs; in a mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots; in\r\none pure bulldog, though the spots were in this case almost white; and in\r\ngreyhounds,--but true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare;\r\nnevertheless I have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the\r\nCaledonian Champion meeting of April 1860, and was \"marked precisely like a\r\nblack-and-tan terrier.\" This dog, or another exactly the same colour, ran\r\nat the Scottish National Club on the 21st of March, 1865; and I hear from\r\nMr. C.M. Browne, that \"there was no reason either on the sire or dam side\r\nfor the appearance of this unusual colour.\" Mr. Swinhoe at my request\r\nlooked at the dogs in China, at Amoy, and he soon noticed a brown dog with\r\nyellow spots over the eyes. Colonel H. Smith (1/40. 'The Naturalist\r\nLibrary' Dogs, volume 10 pages 4, 19.) figures the magnificent black\r\nmastiff of Thibet with a tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet, and\r\nchaps; and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native domestic\r\ndog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured rings round the\r\neyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May 1863, a so-called forest dog\r\nfrom North-West Mexico was shown, which had pale tan-coloured spots over\r\nthe eyes. The occurrence of these tan-coloured spots in dogs of such\r\nextremely different breeds, living in various parts of the world, makes the\r\nfact highly remarkable.\r\n\r\nWe shall hereafter see, especially in the chapter on Pigeons, that coloured\r\nmarks are strongly inherited, and that they often aid us in discovering the\r\nprimitive forms of our domestic races. Hence, if any wild canine species\r\nhad distinctly exhibited the tan-coloured spots over the eyes, it might\r\nhave been argued that this was the parent-form of nearly all our domestic\r\nraces. But after looking at many coloured plates, and through the whole\r\ncollection of skins in the British Museum, I can find no species thus\r\nmarked. It is no doubt possible that some extinct species was thus\r\ncoloured. On the other hand, in looking at the various species, there seems\r\nto be a tolerably plain correlation between tan-coloured legs and face; and\r\nless frequently between black legs and a black face; and this general rule\r\nof colouring explains to a certain extent the above-given cases of\r\ncorrelation between the eye-spots and the colour of the feet. Moreover,\r\nsome jackals and foxes have a trace of a white ring round their eyes, as in\r\nC. mesomelas, C. aureus, and (judging from Colonel H. Smith's drawing) in\r\nC. alopex, and C. thaleb. Other species have a trace of a black line over\r\nthe corners of the eyes, as in C. variegatus, cinereo-variegatus, and\r\nfulvus, and the wild Dingo. Hence I am inclined to conclude that a tendency\r\nfor tan-coloured spots to appear over the eyes in the various breeds of\r\ndogs, is analogous to the case observed by Desmarest, namely, that when any\r\nwhite appears on a dog the tip of the tail is always white, \"de maniere a\r\nrappeler la tache terminale de meme couleur, qui caracterise la plupart des\r\nCanides sauvages.\" (1/41. Quoted by Prof. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome 2\r\npage 66.) This rule, however, as I am assured by Mr. Jesse, does not\r\ninvariably hold good.]\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended from wolves\r\nor jackals, because their periods of gestation are different. The supposed\r\ndifference rests on statements made by Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and\r\nothers; but these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to\r\nagree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it\r\nis often in some degree variable. (1/42. J. Hunter shows that the long\r\nperiod of seventy-three days given by Buffon is easily explained by the\r\nbitch having received the dog many times during a period of sixteen days\r\n('Phil. Transact.' 1787 page 353). Hunter found that the gestation of a\r\nmongrel from wolf and dog ('Phil. Transact.' 1789 page 160) apparently was\r\nsixty-three days, for she received the dog more than once. The period of a\r\nmongrel dog and jackal was fifty-nine days. Fred. Cuvier found the period\r\nof gestation of the wolf to be ('Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 4 page 8)\r\ntwo months and a few days, which agrees with the dog. Isid G. St.-Hilaire,\r\nwho has discussed the whole subject, and from whom I quote Bellingeri,\r\nstates ('Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 112) that in the Jardin des Plantes\r\nthe period of the jackal has been found to be from sixty to sixty-three\r\ndays, exactly as with the dog.) Tessier, who has closely attended to this\r\nsubject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the dog. The\r\nRev. W.D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases of retrievers, in\r\nwhich the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not counting this day,\r\nbut counting that of parturition, the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two,\r\nand sixty-seven days. The average period is sixty-three days; but\r\nBellingeri states that this applies only to large dogs; and that for small\r\nraces it is from sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had\r\nmuch experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be\r\nlonger with large than with small dogs.\r\n\r\nF. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on\r\naccount of its offensive smell; but savages are not sensitive in this\r\nrespect. The degree of odour, also, differs in the different kinds of\r\njackal (1/43. See Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page\r\n112, on the odour of jackals. Col. Ham. Smith in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page\r\n289.); and Colonel H. Smith makes a sectional division of the group with\r\none character dependent on not being offensive. On the other hand, dogs--\r\nfor instance, rough and smooth terriers--differ much in this respect; and\r\nM. Godron states that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more\r\nodoriferous than other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy (1/44. Quoted by Quatrefages\r\nin 'Bull. Soc. d'Acclimat.' May 11, 1863.) gave to a dog the same odour as\r\nthat from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh.\r\n\r\nThe belief that our dogs are descended from wolves, jackals, South American\r\nCanidae, and other species, suggests a far more important difficulty. These\r\nanimals in their undomesticated state, judging from a widely-spread\r\nanalogy, would have been in some degree sterile if intercrossed; and such\r\nsterility will be admitted as almost certain by all those who believe that\r\nthe lessened fertility of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of\r\nspecific distinctness. Anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries\r\nwhich they inhabit in common. On the other hand, all domestic dogs, which\r\nare here supposed to be descended from several distinct species, are, as\r\nfar as is known, mutually fertile together. But, as Broca has well remarked\r\n(1/45. 'Journal de la Physiologie' tome 2 page 385.), the fertility of\r\nsuccessive generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that\r\ncare which is thought indispensable when species are crossed. The few facts\r\nleading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and reproductive powers\r\ndiffer in the several races of the dog when crossed are (passing over mere\r\nsize as rendering propagation difficult) as follows: the Mexican Alco\r\n(1/46. See Mr. R. Hill's excellent account of this breed in Gosse's\r\n'Jamaica' page 338; Rengger 'Saugethiere von Paraguay' s. 153. With respect\r\nto Spitz dogs, see Bechstein's 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' 1801 b. 1 s. 638.\r\nWith respect to Dr. Hodgkin's statement made before Brit. Assoc. see 'The\r\nZoologist' volume 4 for 1845-46 page 1097.) apparently dislikes dogs of\r\nother kinds, but this perhaps is not strictly a sexual feeling; the\r\nhairless endemic dog of Paraguay, according to Rengger, mixes less with the\r\nEuropean races than these do with each other; the Spitz dog in Germany is\r\nsaid to receive the fox more readily than do other breeds; and Dr. Hodgkin\r\nstates that a female Dingo in England attracted the male wild foxes. If\r\nthese latter statements can be trusted, they prove some degree of sexual\r\ndifference in the breeds of the dog. But the fact remains that our domestic\r\ndogs, differing so widely as they do in external structure, are far more\r\nfertile together than we have reason to believe their supposed wild parents\r\nwould have been. Pallas assumes (1/47. 'Acta Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780\r\npart 2 pages 84, 100.) that a long course of domestication eliminates that\r\nsterility which the parent-species would have exhibited if only lately\r\ncaptured; no distinct facts are recorded in support of this hypothesis; but\r\nthe evidence seems to me so strong (independently of the evidence derived\r\nfrom other domesticated animals) in favour of our domestic dogs having\r\ndescended from several wild stocks, that I am inclined to admit the truth\r\nof this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThere is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the doctrine\r\nof the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild species, namely, that\r\nthey do not seem to be perfectly fertile with their supposed parents. But\r\nthe experiment has not been quite fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for\r\ninstance, which in external appearance so closely resembles the European\r\nwolf, ought to be crossed with this wolf: and the pariah dogs of India with\r\nIndian wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the sterility is\r\nvery slight between certain dogs and wolves and other Canidae is shown by\r\nsavages taking the trouble to cross them. Buffon got four successive\r\ngenerations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were perfectly fertile\r\ntogether. (1/48. M. Broca has shown ('Journal de Physiologie' tome 2 page\r\n353) that Buffon's experiments have been often misrepresented. Broca has\r\ncollected (pages 390-395) many facts on the fertility of crossed dogs,\r\nwolves, and jackals.) But more lately M. Flourens states positively as the\r\nresult of his numerous experiments that hybrids from the wolf and dog,\r\ncrossed inter se, become sterile at the third generation, and those from\r\nthe jackal and dog at the fourth generation. (1/49. 'De la Longevite\r\nHumaine' par M. Flourens 1855 page 143. Mr. Blyth says ('Indian Sporting\r\nReview' volume 2 page 137) that he has seen in India several hybrids from\r\nthe pariah-dog and jackal; and between one of these hybrids and a terrier.\r\nThe experiments of Hunter on the jackal are well-known. See also Isid.\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire, 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 217, who speaks of the\r\nhybrid offspring of the jackal as perfectly fertile for three generations.)\r\nBut these animals were closely confined; and many wild animals, as we shall\r\nsee in a future chapter, are rendered by confinement in some degree or even\r\nutterly sterile. The Dingo, which breeds freely in Australia with our\r\nimported dogs, would not breed though repeatedly crossed in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes. (1/50. On authority of F. Cuvier quoted in Bronn's 'Geschichte der\r\nNatur' b. 2 s. 164.) Some hounds from Central Africa, brought home by Major\r\nDenham, never bred in the Town of London (1/51. W.C.L. Martin 'History of\r\nthe Dog' 1845 page 203. Mr. Philip P. King, after ample opportunities of\r\nobservation, informs me that the Dingo and European dogs often cross in\r\nAustralia.); and a similar tendency to sterility might be transmitted to\r\nthe hybrid offspring of a wild animal. Moreover, it appears that in M.\r\nFlourens' experiments the hybrids were closely bred in and in for three or\r\nfour generations; and this circumstance would most certainly increase the\r\ntendency to sterility. Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological\r\nGardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and jackal, which\r\neven in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I was assured by\r\nher keeper, she did not fully exhibit her proper periods; but this case was\r\ncertainly exceptional, as numerous instances have occurred of fertile\r\nhybrids from these two animals. In almost all experiments on the crossing\r\nof animals there are so many causes of doubt, that it is extremely\r\ndifficult to come to any positive conclusion. It would, however, appear,\r\nthat those who believe that our dogs are descended from several species\r\nwill have not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of\r\ndomestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed\r\ntogether; but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their\r\nsupposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been retained\r\nor possibly even acquired.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the last\r\ntwo paragraphs, when we reflect on the inherent improbability of man having\r\ndomesticated throughout the world one single species alone of so widely\r\ndistributed, so easily tamed, and so useful a group as the Canidae; when we\r\nreflect on the extreme antiquity of the different breeds; and especially\r\nwhen we reflect on the close similarity, both in external structure and\r\nhabits, between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild species\r\nstill inhabiting these same countries, the balance of evidence is strongly\r\nin favour of the multiple origin of our dogs.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL BREEDS OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\nIf the several breeds have descended from several wild stocks, their\r\ndifference can obviously in part be explained by that of their parent\r\nspecies. For instance, the form of the greyhound may be partly accounted\r\nfor by descent from some such animal as the slim Abyssinian Canis simensis\r\n(1/52. Ruppel 'Neue Wirbelthiere von Abyssinien' 1835-40 'Mammif.' s. 39\r\npl. 14. There is a specimen of this fine animal in the British Museum.),\r\nwith its elongated muzzle; that of the larger dogs from the larger wolves,\r\nand the smaller and slighter dogs from the jackals: and thus perhaps we may\r\naccount for certain constitutional and climatal differences. But it would\r\nbe a great error to suppose that there has not been in addition (1/53. Even\r\nPallas admits this; see 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 page 93.) a large\r\namount of variation. The intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild\r\nstocks, and of the subsequently formed races, has probably increased the\r\ntotal number of breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly\r\nmodified some of them. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such\r\nextreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs, Blenheim\r\nspaniels, terriers, pugs, etc., unless we believe that forms equally or\r\nmore strongly characterised in these different respects once existed in\r\nnature. But hardly any one has been bold enough to suppose that such\r\nunnatural forms ever did or could exist in a wild state. When compared with\r\nall known members of the family of Canidae they betray a distinct and\r\nabnormal origin. No instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds,\r\nspaniels, true greyhounds having been kept by savages: they are the product\r\nof long-continued civilisation.\r\n\r\n[The number of breeds and sub-breeds of the dog is great; Youatt for\r\ninstance, describes twelve kinds of greyhounds. I will not attempt to\r\nenumerate or describe the varieties, for we cannot discriminate how much of\r\ntheir difference is due to variation, and how much to descent from\r\ndifferent aboriginal stocks. But it may be worth while briefly to mention\r\nsome points. Commencing with the skull, Cuvier has admitted (1/54. Quoted\r\nby I. Geoffroy 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 453.) that in form the\r\ndifferences are \"plus fortes que celles d'aucunes especes sauvages d'un\r\nmeme genre naturel.\" The proportions of the different bones; the curvature\r\nof the lower jaw, the position of the condyles with respect to the plane of\r\nthe teeth (on which F. Cuvier founded his classification), and in mastiffs\r\nthe shape of its posterior branch; the shape of the zygomatic arch, and of\r\nthe temporal fossae; the position of the occiput--all vary considerably.\r\n(1/55. F. Cuvier in 'Annales du Museum' tome 18 page 337; Godron 'De\r\nl'Espece' tome 1 page 342; and Col. H. Smith in 'Nat. Library' volume 9\r\npage 101. See also some observations on the degeneracy of the skull in\r\ncertain breeds, by Prof. Bianconi 'La Theorie Darwinienne' 1874 page 279.)\r\nThe difference in size between the brains of dogs belonging to large and\r\nsmall breeds \"is something prodigious.\" \"Some dogs' brains are high and\r\nrounded, while others are low, long, and narrow in front.\" In the latter,\r\n\"the olfactory lobes are visible for about half their extent, when the\r\nbrain is seen from above, but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres\r\nin other breeds.\" (1/56. Dr. Burt Wilder 'American Assoc. Advancement of\r\nScience' 1873 pages 236, 239.) The dog has properly six pairs of molar\r\nteeth in the upper jaw, and seven in the lower; but several naturalists\r\nhave seen not rarely an additional pair in the upper jaw (1/57. Isid.\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' 1832 tome 1 page 660, Gervais\r\n'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' tome 2 1855 page 66. De Blainville\r\n('Osteographie, Canidae' page 137) has also seen an extra molar on both\r\nsides.); and Professor Gervais says that there are dogs \"qui ont sept\r\npaires de dents superieures et huit inferieures.\" De Blainville (1/58.\r\n'Osteographie, Canidae' page 137.) has given full particulars on the\r\nfrequency of these deviations in the number of the teeth, and has shown\r\nthat it is not always the same tooth which is supernumerary. In short-\r\nmuzzled races, according to H. Muller (1/59. Wurzburger 'Medecin.\r\nZeitschrift' 1860 b. 1 s. 265.), the molar teeth stand obliquely, whilst in\r\nlong-muzzled races they are placed longitudinally, with open spaces between\r\nthem. The naked, so-called Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely deficient\r\nin its teeth (1/60. Mr. Yarrell in 'Proc. Zoological Soc.' October 8, 1833.\r\nMr. Waterhouse showed me a skull of one of these dogs, which had only a\r\nsingle molar on each side and some imperfect incisors.),--sometimes having\r\nnone except one molar on each side; but this, though characteristic of the\r\nbreed, must be considered as a monstrosity. M. Girard (1/61. Quoted in 'The\r\nVeterinary' London volume 8 page 415.), who seems to have attended closely\r\nto the subject, says that the period of the appearance of the permanent\r\nteeth differs in different dogs, being earlier in large dogs; thus the\r\nmastiff assumes its adult teeth in four or five months, whilst in the\r\nspaniel the period is sometimes more than seven or eight months. On the\r\nother hand small dogs are mature, and the females have arrived at the best\r\nage for breeding, when one year old, whereas large dogs \"are still in their\r\npuppyhood at this time, and take fully twice as long to develop their\r\nproportions.\" (1/62. This is quoted from Stonehenge, a great authority,\r\n'The Dog' 1867 page 187.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to minor differences little need be said. Isidore Geoffroy has\r\nshown (1/63. 'Hist. Nat. General' tome 3 page 448.) that in size some dogs\r\nare six times as long (the tail being excluded) as others; and that the\r\nheight relatively to the length of the body varies from between one to two,\r\nand one to nearly four. In the Scotch deer-hound there is a striking and\r\nremarkable difference in the size of the male and female. (1/64. W. Scrope\r\n'Art of Deer-Stalking' page 354.) Every one knows how the ears vary in size\r\nin different breeds, and with their great development their muscles become\r\natrophied. Certain breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow\r\nbetween the nostrils and lips. The caudal vertebrae, according to F.\r\nCuvier, on whose authority the two last statements rest, vary in number;\r\nand the tail in English cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent. The\r\nmammae vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton, having examined twenty-\r\none dogs, found eight with five mammae on each side; eight with four on\r\neach side; and the others with an unequal number on the two sides. (1/65.\r\nQuoted by Col. Ham. Smith in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 79.) Dogs have\r\nproperly five toes in front and four behind, but a fifth toe is often\r\nadded; and F. Cuvier states that, when a fifth toe is present, a fourth\r\ncuneiform bone is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great\r\ncuneiform bone is raised, and gives on its inner side a large articular\r\nsurface to the astragalus; so that even the relative connection of the\r\nbones, the most constant of all characters, varies. These modifications,\r\nhowever, in the feet of dogs are not important, because they ought to be\r\nranked, as De Blainville has shown (1/66. De Blainville 'Osteographie,\r\nCanidae' page 134. F. Cuvier 'Annales du Museum' tome 18 page 342. In\r\nregard to mastiffs, see Col. H. Smith 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 218. For\r\nthe Thibet mastiff, see Mr. Hodgson in 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal'\r\nvolume 1 1832 page 342.) as monstrosities. Nevertheless they are\r\ninteresting from being correlated with the size of the body, for they occur\r\nmuch more frequently with mastiffs and other large breeds than with small\r\ndogs. Closely allied varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect;\r\nthus Mr. Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet\r\nmastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not thus\r\ncharacterised. The extent to which the skin is developed between the toes\r\nvaries much; but we shall return to this point. The degree to which the\r\nvarious breeds differ in the perfection of their senses, dispositions, and\r\ninherited habits is notorious to every one. The breeds present some\r\nconstitutional differences: the pulse, says Youatt (1/67. 'The Dog' 1845\r\npage 186. With respect to diseases Youatt asserts (page 167) that the\r\nItalian greyhound is \"strongly subject\" to polypi in the matrix or vagina.\r\nThe spaniel and pug (page 182) are most liable to bronchocele. The\r\nliability to distemper (page 232) is extremely different in different\r\nbreeds. On the distemper, see also Col. Hutchinson on 'Dog Breaking' 1850\r\npage 279.) \"varies materially according to the breed, as well as to the\r\nsize of the animal.\" Different breeds of dogs are subject in different\r\ndegrees to various diseases. They certainly become adapted to different\r\nclimates under which they have long existed. It is notorious that most of\r\nour best European breeds deteriorate in India. (1/68. See 'Youatt on the\r\nDog' page 15; 'The Veterinary' London volume 11 page 235.) The Rev R.\r\nEverest (1/69. 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 3 page 19.) believes\r\nthat no one has succeeded in keeping the Newfoundland dog long alive in\r\nIndia; so it is, according to Lichtenstein (1/70. 'Travels' volume 2 page\r\n15.), even at the Cape of Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff degenerates on the\r\nplains of India, and can live only on the mountains. (1/71. Hodgson in\r\n'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 1 page 342.) Lloyd (1/72. 'Field\r\nSports of the North of Europe' volume 2 page 165.) asserts that our\r\nbloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried, and cannot withstand the cold of\r\nthe northern European forests.]\r\n\r\nSeeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each other,\r\nand remembering Cuvier's admission that their skulls differ more than do\r\nthose of the species of any natural genus, and bearing in mind how closely\r\nthe bones of wolves, jackals, foxes, and other Canidae agree, it is\r\nremarkable that we meet with the statement, repeated over and over again,\r\nthat the races of the dog differ in no important characters. A highly\r\ncompetent judge, Prof. Gervais (1/73. 'Hist. Nat. des Mammif.' 1855 tome 2\r\npages 66, 67.), admits \"si l'on prenait sans controle les alterations dont\r\nchacun de ces organes est susceptible, on pourrait croire qu'il y a entre\r\nles chiens domestiques des differences plus grandes que celles qui separent\r\nailleurs les especes, quelquefois meme les genres.\" Some of the differences\r\nabove enumerated are in one respect of comparatively little value, for they\r\nare not characteristic of distinct breeds: no one pretends that such is the\r\ncase with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae; the\r\nadditional digit is generally present with mastiffs, and some of the more\r\nimportant differences in the skull and lower jaw are more or less\r\ncharacteristic of various breeds. But we must not forget that the\r\npredominant power of selection has not been applied in any of these cases;\r\nwe have variability in important parts, but the differences have not been\r\nfixed by selection. Man cares for the form and fleetness of his greyhounds,\r\nfor the size of his mastiffs, and formerly for the strength of the jaw in\r\nhis bulldogs, etc.; but he cares nothing about the number of their molar\r\nteeth or mammae or digits; nor do we know that differences in these organs\r\nare correlated with, or owe their development to, differences in other\r\nparts of the body about which man does care. Those who have attended to the\r\nsubject of selection will admit that, nature having given variability, man,\r\nif he so chose, could fix five toes to the hinder feet of certain breeds of\r\ndogs, as certainly as to the feet of his Dorking fowls: he could probably\r\nfix, but with much more difficulty, an additional pair of molar teeth in\r\neither jaw, in the same way as he has given additional horns to certain\r\nbreeds of sheep; if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs, having\r\nthe so-called Turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on, he could\r\nprobably do so, for he has succeeded in making hornless breeds of cattle\r\nand sheep.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several races of\r\ndogs have come to differ so greatly from each other, we are, as in most\r\nother cases, profoundly ignorant. We may attribute part of the difference\r\nin external form and constitution to inheritance from distinct wild stocks,\r\nthat is to changes effected under nature before domestication. We must\r\nattribute something to the crossing of the several domestic and natural\r\nraces. I shall, however, soon recur to the crossing of races. We have\r\nalready seen how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species;\r\nand Pennant gives a curious account (1/74. 'History of Quadrupeds' 1793\r\nvolume 1 page 238.) of the manner in which Fochabers, in Scotland, was\r\nstocked \"with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish aspect\" from a single\r\nhybrid-wolf brought into that district.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies the\r\nforms of dogs. We have lately seen that several of our English breeds\r\ncannot live in India, and it is positively asserted that when bred there\r\nfor a few generations they degenerate not only in their mental faculties,\r\nbut in form. Captain Williamson (1/75. 'Oriental Field Sports' quoted by\r\nYouatt 'The Dog' page 15.), who carefully attended to this subject, states\r\nthat \"hounds are the most rapid in their decline;\" \"greyhounds and\r\npointers, also, rapidly decline.\" But spaniels, after eight or nine\r\ngenerations, and without a cross from Europe, are as good as their\r\nancestors. Dr. Falconer informs me that bulldogs, which have been known,\r\nwhen first brought into the country, to pin down even an elephant by its\r\ntrunk, not only fall off after two or three generations in pluck and\r\nferocity, but lose the under-hung character of their lower jaws; their\r\nmuzzles become finer and their bodies lighter. English dogs imported into\r\nIndia are so valuable that probably due care has been taken to prevent\r\ntheir crossing with native dogs; so that the deterioration cannot be thus\r\naccounted for. The Rev. R. Everest informs me that he obtained a pair of\r\nsetters, born in India, which perfectly resembled their Scotch parents: he\r\nraised several litters from them in Delhi, taking the most stringent\r\nprecautions to prevent a cross, but he never succeeded, though this was\r\nonly the second generation in India, in obtaining a single young dog like\r\nits parents in size or make; their nostrils were more contracted, their\r\nnoses more pointed, their size inferior, and their limbs more slender. So\r\nagain on the coast of Guinea, dogs, according to Bosman, \"alter strangely;\r\ntheir ears grow long and stiff like those of foxes, to which colour they\r\nalso incline, so that in three or four years, they degenerate into very\r\nugly creatures; and in three or four broods their barking turns into a\r\nhowl.\" (1/76. A. Murray gives this passage in his 'Geographical\r\nDistribution of Mammals' 4to 1866 page 8.) This remarkable tendency to\r\nrapid deterioration in European dogs subjected to the climate of India and\r\nAfrica, may be largely accounted for by reversion to a primordial condition\r\nwhich many animals exhibit, as we shall hereafter see, when their\r\nconstitutions are in any way disturbed.\r\n\r\nSome of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of the dog\r\nhave probably arisen suddenly, and, though strictly inherited, may be\r\ncalled monstrosities; for instance, the shape of the legs and body in the\r\nturnspit of Europe and India; the shape of the head and the under-hanging\r\njaw in the bull-and pug-dog, so alike in this one respect and so unlike in\r\nall others. A peculiarity suddenly arising, and therefore in one sense\r\ndeserving to be called a monstrosity, may, however, be increased and fixed\r\nby man's selection. We can hardly doubt that long-continued training, as\r\nwith the greyhound in coursing hares, as with water-dogs in swimming--and\r\nthe want of exercise, in the case of lapdogs--must have produced some\r\ndirect effect on their structure and instincts. But we shall immediately\r\nsee that the most potent cause of change has probably been the selection,\r\nboth methodical and unconscious, of slight individual differences,--the\r\nlatter kind of selection resulting from the occasional preservation, during\r\nhundreds of generations, of those individual dogs which were the most\r\nuseful to man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of life. In\r\na future chapter on Selection I shall show that even barbarians attend\r\nclosely to the qualities of their dogs. This unconscious selection by man\r\nwould be aided by a kind of natural selection; for the dogs of savages have\r\npartly to gain their own subsistence: for instance, in Australia, as we\r\nhear from Mr. Nind (1/77. Quoted by Mr. Galton 'Domestication of Animals'\r\npage 13.), the dogs are sometimes compelled by want to leave their masters\r\nand provide for themselves; but in a few days they generally return. And we\r\nmay infer that dogs of different shapes, sizes, and habits, would have the\r\nbest chance of surviving under different circumstances,--on open sterile\r\nplains, where they have to run down their own prey,--on rocky coasts, where\r\nthey have to feed on crabs and fish left in the tidal pools, as in the case\r\nof New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego. In this latter country, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Bridges, the Catechist to the Mission, the dogs turn over\r\nthe stones on the shore to catch the crustaceans which lie beneath, and\r\nthey \"are clever enough to knock off the shell-fish at a first blow;\" for\r\nif this be not done, shell-fish are well-known to have an almost invincible\r\npower of adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to which their\r\nfeet are webbed. In dogs of the Newfoundland breed, which are eminently\r\naquatic in their habits, the skin, according to Isidore Geoffroy (1/78.\r\n'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 450.), extends to the third phalanges whilst\r\nin ordinary dogs it extends only to the second. In two Newfoundland dogs\r\nwhich I examined, when the toes were stretched apart and viewed on the\r\nunder side, the skin extended in a nearly straight line between the outer\r\nmargins of the balls of the toes; whereas, in two terriers of distinct sub-\r\nbreeds, the skin viewed in the same manner was deeply scooped out. In\r\nCanada there is a dog which is peculiar to the country and common there,\r\nand this has \"half-webbed feet and is fond of the water.\" (1/79. Mr.\r\nGreenhow on the Canadian Dog in Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 6 1833\r\npage 511.) English otter-hounds are said to have webbed feet: a friend\r\nexamined for me the feet of two, in comparison with the feet of some\r\nharriers and bloodhounds; he found the skin variable in extent in all, but\r\nmore developed in the otter-hounds than in the others. (1/80. See Mr. C.O.\r\nGroom-Napier on the webbing of the hind feet of Otterhounds in 'Land and\r\nWater' October 13, 1866 page 270.) As aquatic animals which belong to quite\r\ndifferent orders have webbed feet, there can be no doubt that this\r\nstructure would be serviceable to dogs that frequent the water. We may\r\nconfidently infer that no man ever selected his water-dogs by the extent to\r\nwhich the skin was developed between their toes; but what he does, is to\r\npreserve and breed from those individuals which hunt best in the water, or\r\nbest retrieve wounded game, and thus he unconsciously selects dogs with\r\nfeet slightly better webbed. The effects of use from the frequent\r\nstretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in the result. Man thus\r\nclosely imitates Natural Selection. We have an excellent illustration of\r\nthis same process in North America, where, according to Sir J. Richardson\r\n(1/81. 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' 1829 page 62.), all the wolves, foxes, and\r\naboriginal domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the corresponding\r\nspecies of the Old World, and \"well calculated for running on the snow.\"\r\nNow, in these Arctic regions, the life or death of every animal will often\r\ndepend on its success in hunting over the snow when soft; and this will in\r\npart depend on the feet being broad; yet they must not be so broad as to\r\ninterfere with the activity of the animal when the ground is sticky, or\r\nwith its power of burrowing holes, or with other necessary habits of life.\r\n\r\nAs changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly are not to be\r\nnoticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual\r\nvariations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in\r\nunderstanding the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in\r\nthrowing indirect light on the changes effected under nature, I will give\r\nin detail such cases as I have been able to collect. Lawrence (1/82. 'The\r\nHorse in all his Varieties, etc.' 1829 pages 230, 234.), who paid\r\nparticular attention to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says\r\nthat between eighty and ninety years before \"an entirely new foxhound was\r\nraised through the breeder's art,\" the ears of the old southern hound being\r\nreduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in length, and\r\nthe stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this was effected by a\r\ncross with a greyhound. With respect to this latter dog, Youatt (1/83. 'The\r\nDog' 1845 pages 31, 35; with respect to King Charles' spaniel page 45; for\r\nthe setter page 90.), who is generally cautious in his statements, says\r\nthat the greyhound within the last fifty years, that is before the\r\ncommencement of the present century, \"assumed a somewhat different\r\ncharacter from that which he once possessed. He is now distinguished by a\r\nbeautiful symmetry of form, of which he could not once boast, and he has\r\neven superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited. He is no longer\r\nused to struggle with deer, but contends with his fellows over a shorter\r\nand speedier course.\" An able writer (1/84. In the 'Encyclop. of Rural\r\nSports' page 557.) believes that our English greyhounds are the\r\ndescendants, PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVED, of the large rough greyhounds which\r\nexisted in Scotland so early as the third century. A cross at some former\r\nperiod with the Italian greyhound has been suspected; but this seems hardly\r\nprobable, considering the feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as\r\nis well-known, crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with\r\na bulldog--this breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to be\r\ndeficient in the power of scent; \"after the sixth or seventh generation,\"\r\nsays Youatt, \"there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog, but\r\nhis courage and indomitable perseverance remained.\"\r\n\r\nYouatt infers, from a comparison of an old picture of King Charles's\r\nspaniels with the living dog, that \"the breed of the present day is\r\nmaterially altered for the worse:\" the muzzle has become shorter, the\r\nforehead more prominent, and the eyes larger; the changes in this case have\r\nprobably been due to simple selection. The setter, as this author remarks\r\nin another place, \"is evidently the large spaniel improved to his present\r\npeculiar size and beauty, and taught another way of marking his game. If\r\nthe form of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point, we\r\nmight have recourse to history:\" he then refers to a document dated 1685\r\nbearing on this subject, and adds that the pure Irish setter shows no signs\r\nof a cross with the pointer, which some authors suspect has been the case\r\nwith the English setter. The bulldog is an English breed, and as I hear\r\nfrom Mr. G.R. Jesse (1/85. Author of 'Researches into the History of the\r\nBritish Dog.), seems to have originated from the mastiff since the time of\r\nShakspeare; but certainly existed in 1631, as shown by Prestwick Eaton's\r\nletters. There can be no doubt that the fancy bulldogs of the present day,\r\nnow that they are not used for bull-baiting, have become greatly reduced in\r\nsize, without any express intention on the part of the breeder. Our\r\npointers are certainly descended from a Spanish breed, as even their\r\npresent names, Don, Ponto, Carlos, etc., show; it is said that they were\r\nnot known in England before the Revolution in 1688 (1/86. See Col. Hamilton\r\nSmith on the antiquity of the Pointer, in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 196.);\r\nbut the breed since its introduction has been much modified, for Mr.\r\nBorrow, who is a sportsman and knows Spain intimately well, informs me that\r\nhe has not seen in that country any breed \"corresponding in figure with the\r\nEnglish pointer; but there are genuine pointers near Xeres which have been\r\nimported by English gentlemen.\" A nearly parallel case is offered by the\r\nNewfoundland dog, which was certainly brought into England from that\r\ncountry, but which has since been so much modified that, as several writers\r\nhave observed, it does not now closely resemble any existing native dog in\r\nNewfoundland. (1/87. The Newfoundland dog is believed to have originated\r\nfrom a cross between the Esquimaux dog and a large French hound. See Dr.\r\nHodgkin 'British Assoc.' 1844; Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschland' b. 1 s.\r\n574; 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 132; also Mr. Jukes 'Excursion in and about\r\nNewfoundland.')\r\n\r\nThese several cases of slow and gradual changes in our English dogs possess\r\nsome interest; for though the changes have generally, but not invariably,\r\nbeen caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed, yet we may feel\r\nsure, from the well-known extreme variability of crossed breeds, that\r\nrigorous and long-continued selection must have been practised, in order to\r\nimprove them in a definite manner. As soon as any strain or family became\r\nslightly improved or better adapted to alter circumstances, it would tend\r\nto supplant the older and less improved strains. For instance, as soon as\r\nthe old foxhound was improved by a cross with the greyhound, or by simple\r\nselection, and assumed its present character--and the change was probably\r\ndesired owing to the increased fleetness of our hunters--it rapidly spread\r\nthroughout the country, and is now everywhere nearly uniform. But the\r\nprocess of improvement is still going on for every one tries to improve his\r\nstrain by occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels. Through this\r\nprocess of gradual substitution the old English hound has been lost; and so\r\nit has been with the Irish wolf-dog, the old English bulldog, and several\r\nother breeds, such as the alaunt, as I am informed by Mr. Jesse. But the\r\nextinction of former breeds is apparently aided by another cause; for\r\nwhenever a breed is kept in scanty numbers, as at present with the\r\nbloodhound, it is reared with some difficulty, apparently from the evil\r\neffects of long-continued close interbreeding. As several breeds of the dog\r\nhave been slightly but sensibly modified within so short a period as the\r\nlast one or two centuries, by the selection of the best individuals,\r\nmodified in many cases by crosses with other breeds; and as we shall\r\nhereafter see that the breeding of dogs was attended to in ancient times,\r\nas it still is by savages, we may conclude that we have in selection, even\r\nif only occasionally practised, a potent means of modification.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC CATS.\r\n\r\nCats have been domesticated in the East from an ancient period; Mr. Blyth\r\ninforms me that they are mentioned in a Sanskrit writing 2000 years old,\r\nand in Egypt their antiquity is known to be even greater, as shown by\r\nmonumental drawings and their mummied bodies. These mummies, according to\r\nDe Blainville (1/88. De Blainville 'Osteographie, Felis' page 65 on the\r\ncharacter of F. caligulata; pages 85, 89, 90, 175, on the other mummied\r\nspecies. He quotes Ehrenberg on F. maniculata being mummied.), who has\r\nparticularly studied the subject, belong to no less than three species,\r\nnamely, F. caligulata, bubastes, and chaus. The two former species are said\r\nto be still found, both wild and domesticated, in parts of Egypt. F.\r\ncaligulata presents a difference in the first inferior milk molar tooth, as\r\ncompared with the domestic cats of Europe, which makes De Blainville\r\nconclude that it is not one of the parent-forms of our cats. Several\r\nnaturalists, as Pallas, Temminck, Blyth, believe that domestic cats are the\r\ndescendants of several species commingled: it is certain that cats cross\r\nreadily with various wild species, and it would appear that the character\r\nof the domestic breeds has, at least in some cases, been thus affected. Sir\r\nW. Jardine has no doubt that, \"in the north of Scotland, there has been\r\noccasional crossing with our native species (F. sylvestris), and that the\r\nresult of these crosses has been kept in our houses. I have seen,\" he adds,\r\n\"many cats very closely resembling the wild cat, and one or two that could\r\nscarcely be distinguished from it.\" Mr. Blyth (1/89. Asiatic Soc. of\r\nCalcutta; Curator's Report, August 1856. The passage from Sir W. Jardine is\r\nquoted from this Report. Mr. Blyth, who has especially attended to the wild\r\nand domestic cats of India, has given in this Report a very interesting\r\ndiscussion on their origin.) remarks on this passage, \"but such cats are\r\nnever seen in the southern parts of England; still, as compared with any\r\nIndian tame cat, the affinity of the ordinary British cat to F. sylvestris\r\nis manifest; and due I suspect to frequent intermixture at a time when the\r\ntame cat was first introduced into Britain and continued rare, while the\r\nwild species was far more abundant than at present.\" In Hungary, Jeitteles\r\n(1/90. 'Fauna Hungariae Sup.' 1862 s. 12.) was assured on trustworthy\r\nauthority that a wild male cat crossed with a female domestic cat, and that\r\nthe hybrids long lived in a domesticated state. In Algiers the domestic cat\r\nhas crossed with the wild cat (F. lybica) of that country. (1/91. Isid.\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 177.) In South Africa\r\nas Mr. E. Layard informs me, the domestic cat intermingles freely with the\r\nwild F. caffra; he has seen a pair of hybrids which were quite tame and\r\nparticularly attached to the lady who brought them up; and Mr. Fry has\r\nfound that these hybrids are fertile. In India the domestic cat, according\r\nto Mr. Blyth, has crossed with four Indian species. With respect to one of\r\nthese species, F. chaus, an excellent observer, Sir W. Elliot, informs me\r\nthat he once killed, near Madras, a wild brood, which were evidently\r\nhybrids from the domestic cat; these young animals had a thick lynx-like\r\ntail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm characteristic of\r\nF. chaus. Sir W. Elliot adds that he has often observed this same mark on\r\nthe forearms of domestic cats in India. Mr. Blyth states that domestic cats\r\ncoloured nearly like F. chaus, but not resembling that species in shape,\r\nabound in Bengal; he adds, \"such a colouration is utterly unknown in\r\nEuropean cats, and the proper tabby markings (pale streaks on a black\r\nground, peculiarly and symmetrically disposed), so common in English cats,\r\nare never seen in those of India.\" Dr. D. Short has assured Mr. Blyth\r\n(1/92. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1863 page 184.) that, at Hansi, hybrids between\r\nthe common cat and F. ornata (or torquata) occur, \"and that many of the\r\ndomestic cats of that part of India were undistinguishable from the wild F.\r\nornata.\" Azara states, but only on the authority of the inhabitants, that\r\nin Paraguay the cat has crossed with two native species. From these several\r\ncases we see that in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, the common cat,\r\nwhich lives a freer life than most other domesticated animals, has crossed\r\nwith various wild species; and that in some instances the crossing has been\r\nsufficiently frequent to affect the character of the breed.\r\n\r\nWhether domestic cats have descended from several distinct species, or have\r\nonly been modified by occasional crosses, their fertility, as far as is\r\nknown, is unimpaired. The large Angora or Persian cat is the most distinct\r\nin structure and habits of all the domestic breeds; and is believed by\r\nPallas, but on no distinct evidence, to be descended from the F. manul of\r\nmiddle Asia; and I am assured by Mr. Blyth that the Angora cat breeds\r\nfreely with Indian cats, which, as we have already seen, have apparently\r\nbeen much crossed with F. chaus. In England half-bred Angora cats are\r\nperfectly fertile with one another.\r\n\r\nWithin the same country we do not meet with distinct races of the cat, as\r\nwe do of dogs and of most other domestic animals; though the cats of the\r\nsame country present a considerable amount of fluctuating variability. The\r\nexplanation obviously is that, from their nocturnal and rambling habits,\r\nindiscriminate crossing cannot without much trouble be prevented. Selection\r\ncannot be brought into play to produce distinct breeds, or to keep those\r\ndistinct which have been imported from foreign lands. On the other hand, in\r\nislands and in countries completely separated from each other, we meet with\r\nbreeds more or less distinct; and these cases are worth giving, showing\r\nthat the scarcity of distinct races in the same country is not caused by a\r\ndeficiency of variability in the animal. The tailless cats of the Isle of\r\nMan are said to differ from common cats not only in the want of a tail, but\r\nin the greater length of their hind legs, in the size of their heads, and\r\nin habits. The Creole cat of Antigua, as I am informed by Mr. Nicholson, is\r\nsmaller, and has a more elongated head, than the British cat. In Ceylon, as\r\nMr. Thwaites writes to me, every one at first notices the different\r\nappearance of the native cat from the English animal; it is of small size,\r\nwith closely lying hairs; its head is small, with a receding forehead; but\r\nthe ears are large and sharp; altogether it has what is there called a\r\n\"low-caste\" appearance. Rengger (1/93. 'Saugethiere von Paraguay' 1830 s.\r\n212.) says that the domestic cat, which has been bred for 300 years in\r\nParaguay, presents a striking difference from the European cat; it is\r\nsmaller by a fourth, has a more lanky body, its hair is short, shining,\r\nscanty and lies close, especially on the tail: he adds that the change has\r\nbeen less at Ascension, the capital of Paraguay, owing to the continual\r\ncrossing with newly imported cats; and this fact well illustrates the\r\nimportance of separation. The conditions of life in Paraguay appear not to\r\nbe highly favourable to the cat, for, though they have run half-wild, they\r\ndo not become thoroughly feral, like so many other European animals. In\r\nanother part of South America, according to Roulin (1/94. 'Mem. presentes\r\npar divers Savans: Acad. Roy. des Sciences' tome 6 page 346. Gomara first\r\nnoticed this fact in 1554.), the introduced cat has lost the habit of\r\nuttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev. W.D. Fox purchased a cat in\r\nPortsmouth, which he was told came from the coast of Guinea; its skin was\r\nblack and wrinkled, fur bluish-grey and short, its ears rather bare, legs\r\nlong, and whole aspect peculiar. This \"negro\" cat was fertile with common\r\ncats. On the opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen, R.N. (1/95.\r\n'Narrative of Voyages' volume 2 page 180.) states that all the cats are\r\ncovered with short stiff hair instead of fur: he gives a curious account of\r\na cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for some time on board and could\r\nbe identified with certainty; this animal was left for only eight weeks at\r\nMombas, but during that short period it \"underwent a complete\r\nmetamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured fur.\" A cat from the\r\nCape of Good Hope has been described by Desmarest as remarkable from a red\r\nstripe extending along the whole length of its back. Throughout an immense\r\narea, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu, and Burmah, all the cats\r\nhave truncated tails about half the proper length (1/96. J. Crawfurd\r\n'Descript. Dict. of the Indian Islands' page 255. The Madagascar cat is\r\nsaid to have a twisted tail; see Desmarest in 'Encyclop. Nat. Mamm.' 1820\r\npage 233, for some of the other breeds.), often with a sort of knot at the\r\nend. In the Caroline archipelago the cats have very long legs, and are of a\r\nreddish-yellow colour. (1/97. Admiral Lutke's Voyage volume 3 page 308.) In\r\nChina a breed has drooping ears. At Tobolsk, according to Gmelin, there is\r\na red-coloured breed. In Asia, also, we find the well-known Angora or\r\nPersian breed.\r\n\r\nThe domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere assumes,\r\nas far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions, a uniform\r\ncharacter. Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly\r\nwild; it was carefully examined by Mr. Waterhouse (1/98. 'Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the Beagle, Mammalia' page 20. Dieffenbach 'Travels in New\r\nZealand' volume 2 page 185. Ch. St. John 'Wild Sports of the Highlands'\r\n1846 page 40.), who found nothing remarkable in it, excepting its great\r\nsize. In New Zealand according to Dieffenbach, the feral cats assume a\r\nstreaky grey colour like that of wild cats; and this is the case with the\r\nhalf-wild cats of the Scotch Highlands.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of the\r\ncat. The differences may be in part due to descent from several aboriginal\r\nspecies, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay,\r\nMombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of\r\ndifferent conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may\r\npossibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have\r\nlargely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing\r\nto the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical\r\nselection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in\r\neach litter he generally saves the prettiest, and values most a good breed\r\nof mouse- or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl\r\nafter game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a\r\nbreed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger\r\ndogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have been\r\napplied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each long-civilised\r\ncountry, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.\r\n\r\nWe see in this country considerable diversity in size, some in the\r\nproportions of the body, and extreme variability in colouring. I have only\r\nlately attended to this subject, but have already heard of some singular\r\ncases of variation; one of a cat born in the West Indies toothless, and\r\nremaining so all its life. Mr. Tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a\r\nfemale cat with its canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered\r\nbeyond the lips; the tooth with the fang being .95, and the part projecting\r\nfrom the gum .6 of an inch in length. I have heard of several families of\r\nsix-toed cats, in one of which the peculiarity had been transmitted for at\r\nleast three generations. The tail varies greatly in length; I have seen a\r\ncat which always carried its tail flat on its back when pleased. The ears\r\nvary in shape, and certain strains, in England, inherit a pencil-like tuft\r\nof hairs, above a quarter of an inch in length, on the tips of their ears;\r\nand this same peculiarity, according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats\r\nin India. The great variability in the length of the tail and the lynx-like\r\ntufts of hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in\r\ncertain wild species of the genus. A much more important difference,\r\naccording to Daubenton (1/99. Quoted by Isid. Geoffroy 'Hist. Nat. Gen.'\r\ntome 3 page 427.), is that the intestines of domestic cats are wider, and a\r\nthird longer, than in wild cats of the same size; and this apparently has\r\nbeen by their less strictly carnivorous diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II.\r\n\r\nHORSES AND ASSES.\r\n\r\nHORSE.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE BREEDS.\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY OF.\r\nDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE.\r\nCAN WITHSTAND MUCH COLD.\r\nBREEDS MUCH MODIFIED BY SELECTION.\r\nCOLOURS OF THE HORSE.\r\nDAPPLING.\r\nDARK STRIPES ON THE SPINE, LEGS, SHOULDERS, AND FOREHEAD.\r\nDUN-COLOURED HORSES MOST FREQUENTLY STRIPED.\r\nSTRIPES PROBABLY DUE TO REVERSION TO THE PRIMITIVE STATE OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\nASSES.\r\nBREEDS OF.\r\nCOLOUR OF.\r\nLEG- AND SHOULDER-STRIPES.\r\nSHOULDER-STRIPES SOMETIMES ABSENT, SOMETIMES FORKED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Horse is lost in antiquity. Remains of this animal in a\r\ndomesticated condition have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings,\r\nbelonging to the Neolithic period. (2/1. Rutimeyer 'Fauna der Pfahlbauten'\r\n1861 s. 122.) At the present time the number of breeds is great, as may be\r\nseen by consulting any treatise on the Horse. (2/2. See 'Youatt on the\r\nHorse': J. Lawrence on the Horse 1829; W.C.L. Martin 'History of the Horse'\r\n1845: Col. H. Smith in 'Nat. Library, Horses' 1841 volume 12: Prof. Veith\r\n'Die naturgesch. Haussaugethiere' 1856.) Looking only to the native ponies\r\nof Great Britain, those of the Shetland Isles, Wales, the New Forest, and\r\nDevonshire are distinguishable; and so it is, amongst other instances, with\r\neach separate island in the great Malay archipelago. (2/3. Crawfurd\r\n'Descript. Dict. of Indian Islands' 1856 page 153. \"There are many\r\ndifferent breeds, every island having at least one peculiar to it.\" Thus in\r\nSumatra there are at least two breeds; in Achin and Batubara one; in Java\r\nseveral breeds; one in Bali, Lomboc, Sumbawa (one of the best breeds),\r\nTambora, Bima, Gunung-api, Celebes, Sumba, and Philippines. Other breeds\r\nare specified by Zollinger in the 'Journal of the Indian Archipelago'\r\nvolume 5 page 343 etc.) Some of the breeds present great differences in\r\nsize, shape of ears, length of mane, proportions of the body, form of the\r\nwithers and hind quarters, and especially in the head. Compare the race-\r\nhorse, dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and\r\ndisposition; and see how much greater the difference is than between the\r\nseven or eight other living species of the genus Equus.\r\n\r\nOf individual variations not known to characterise particular breeds, and\r\nnot great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities, I have not\r\ncollected many cases. Mr. G. Brown, of the Cirencester Agricultural\r\nCollege, who has particularly attended to the dentition of our domestic\r\nanimals, writes to me that he has \"several times noticed eight permanent\r\nincisors instead of six in the jaw.\" Male horses only should have canines,\r\nbut they are occasionally found in the mare, though a small size. (2/4.\r\n'The Horse' etc. by John Lawrence 1829 page 14.) The number of ribs on each\r\nside is properly eighteen, but Youatt (2/5. 'The Veterinary' London volume\r\n5 page 543.) asserts that not unfrequently there are nineteen, the\r\nadditional one being always the posterior rib. It is a remarkable fact that\r\nthe ancient Indian horse is said in the Rig-Veda to have only seventeen\r\nribs; and M. Pietrement (2/6. 'Memoire sur les chevaux a trente-quatre\r\ncotes' 1871.), who has called attention to this subject, gives various\r\nreasons for placing full trust in this statement, more especially as during\r\nformer times the Hindoos carefully counted the bones of animals. I have\r\nseen several notices of variations in the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price\r\n(2/7. 'Proc. Veterinary Assoc.' in 'The Veterinary' volume 13 page 42.)\r\nspeaks of an additional bone in the hock, and of certain abnormal\r\nappearances between the tibia and astragalus, as quite common in Irish\r\nhorses, and not due to disease. Horses have often been observed, according\r\nto M. Gaudry (2/8. 'Bulletin de la Soc. Geolog.' tome 22 1866 page 22.), to\r\npossess a trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone, so that \"one\r\nsees appearing by monstrosity, in the foot of the horse, structures which\r\nnormally exist in the foot of the Hipparion,\"--an allied and extinct\r\nanimal. In various countries horn-like projections have been observed on\r\nthe frontal bones of the horse: in one case described by Mr. Percival they\r\narose about two inches above the orbital processes, and were \"very like\r\nthose in a calf from five to six months old,\" being from half to three-\r\nquarters of an inch in length. (2/9. Mr. Percival of the Enniskillen\r\nDragoons in 'The Veterinary' volume 1 page 224: see Azara, 'Des Quadrupedes\r\ndu Paraguay' tome 2 page 313. The French translator of Azara refers to\r\nother cases mentioned by Huzard as having occurred in Spain.) Azara has\r\ndescribed two cases in South America in which the projections were between\r\nthree and four inches in length: other instances have occurred in Spain.\r\n\r\nThat there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be\r\ndoubted, when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing throughout\r\nthe world or even within the same country, and when we know that they have\r\nlargely increased in number since the earliest known records. (2/10.\r\nGodron, 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 378.) Even in so fleeting a character as\r\ncolour, Hofacker (2/11. 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc. 1828 s. 10.) found\r\nthat, out of 216 cases in which horses of the same colour were paired, only\r\neleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour. As Professor Low\r\n(2/12. 'Domesticated Animals of the British Islands' pages 527, 532. In all\r\nthe veterinary treatises and papers which I have read, the writers insist\r\nin the strongest terms on the inheritance by the horse of all good and bad\r\ntendencies and qualities. Perhaps the principle of inheritance is not\r\nreally stronger in the horse than in any other animal; but, from its value,\r\nthe tendency has been more carefully observed.) has remarked, the English\r\nrace-horse offers the best possible evidence of inheritance. The pedigree\r\nof a race-horse is of more value in judging of its probable success than\r\nits appearance: \"King Herod\" gained in prizes 201,505 pounds sterling, and\r\nbegot 497 winners; \"Eclipse\" begot 334 winners.\r\n\r\nWhether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds has\r\narisen under domestication is doubtful. From the fertility of the most\r\ndistinct breeds (2/13. Andrew Knight crossed breeds so different in size as\r\na dray-horse and Norwegian pony: see A. Walker on 'Intermarriage' 1838 page\r\n205.) when crossed, naturalists have generally looked at all the breeds as\r\nhaving descended from a single species. Few will agree with Colonel H.\r\nSmith, who believes that they have descended from no less than five\r\nprimitive and differently coloured stocks. (2/14. 'Nat. Library, Horses'\r\nvolume 12 page 208.) But as several species and varieties of the horse\r\nexisted (2/15. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome 2 page 143. Owen 'British\r\nFossil Mammals' page 383.) during the later tertiary periods, and as\r\nRutimeyer found differences in the size and form of the skull in the\r\nearliest known domesticated horses (2/16. 'Kenntniss der fossilen Pferde'\r\n1863 s. 131.), we ought not to feel sure that all our breeds are descended\r\nfrom a single species. The savages of North and South America easily\r\nreclaim the feral horses, so that there is no improbability in savages in\r\nvarious quarters of the world having domesticated more than one native\r\nspecies or natural race. M. Sanson (2/17. 'Comptes rendus' 1866 page 485\r\nand 'Journal de l'Anat. et de la Phys.' Mai 1868.) thinks that he has\r\nproved that two distinct species have been domesticated, one in the East,\r\nand one in North Africa; and that these differed in the number of their\r\nlumbar vertebra and in various other parts; but M. Sanson seems to believe\r\nthat osteological characters are subject to very little variation, which is\r\ncertainly a mistake. At present no aboriginal or truly wild horse is\r\npositively known to exist; for it is commonly believed that the wild horses\r\nof the East are escaped domestic animals. (2/18. Mr. W.C.L. Martin, 'The\r\nHorse' 1845 page 34, in arguing against the belief that the wild Eastern\r\nhorses are merely feral, has remarked on the improbability of man in\r\nancient times having extirpated a species in a region where it can now\r\nexist in numbers.) If therefore our domestic breeds are descended from\r\nseveral species or natural races, all have become extinct in the wild\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have\r\nundergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct\r\neffect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent opportunities of comparing the\r\nhorses of Spain with those of South America, informs me that the horses of\r\nChile, which have lived under nearly the same conditions as their\r\nprogenitors in Andalusia, remain unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and\r\nthe Puno horses are considerably modified. There can be no doubt that\r\nhorses become greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living\r\non mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of nutritious\r\nor varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the ponies are on the\r\nNorthern islands and on the mountains of Europe. Corsica and Sardinia have\r\ntheir native ponies; and there were (2/19. 'Transact. Maryland Academy'\r\nvolume 1 part 1 page 28.), or still are, on some islands on the coast of\r\nVirginia, ponies like those of the Shetland Islands, which are believed to\r\nhave originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions. The Puno\r\nponies, which inhabit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are, as I hear\r\nfrom Mr. D. Forbes, strange little creatures, very unlike their Spanish\r\nprogenitors. Further south, in the Falkland Islands, the offspring of the\r\nhorses imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in size (2/20.\r\nMr. Mackinnon 'The Falkland Islands' page 25. The average height of the\r\nFalkland horses is said to be 14 hands 2 inches. See also my 'Journal of\r\nResearches.') and strength that they are unfitted for catching wild cattle\r\nwith the lasso; so that fresh horses have to be brought for this purpose\r\nfrom La Plata at a great expense. The reduced size of the horses bred on\r\nboth southern and northern islands, and on several mountain-chains, can\r\nhardly have been caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on\r\nthe Virginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand intense\r\ncold, for wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under lat. 56 deg,\r\n(2/21. Pallas 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1777 part 2 page 265. With\r\nrespect to the tarpans scraping away the snow see Col. Hamilton Smith in\r\n'Nat. Lib.' volume 12 page 165.) and aboriginally the horses must have\r\ninhabited countries annually covered with snow, for he long retains the\r\ninstinct of scraping it away to get at the herbage beneath. The wild\r\ntarpans in the East have this instinct; and so it is, as I am informed by\r\nAdmiral Sulivan, with the horses recently and formerly introduced into the\r\nFalkland Islands from La Plata, some of which have run wild; this latter\r\nfact is remarkable, as the progenitors of these horses could not have\r\nfollowed this instinct during many generations in La Plata. On the other\r\nhand, the wild cattle of the Falklands never scrape away the snow, and\r\nperish when the ground is long covered. In the northern parts of America\r\nthe horses descended from those introduced by the Spanish conquerors of\r\nMexico, have the same habit, as have the native bisons, but not so the\r\ncattle introduced from Europe. (2/22. Franklin 'Narrative' volume 1 page 87\r\nnote by Sir J. Richardson.)\r\n\r\nThe horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense cold,\r\nfor he is known to come to the highest perfection, though not attaining a\r\nlarge size, in Arabia and northern Africa. Much humidity is apparently more\r\ninjurious to the horse than heat or cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses\r\nsuffer much from the dampness; and this circumstance may perhaps partly\r\naccount for the singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of Bengal\r\n(2/23. Mr. J.H. Moor 'Notices of the Indian Archipelago' Singapore 1837\r\npage 189. A pony from Java was sent ('Athenaeum' 1842 page 718) to the\r\nQueen only 28 inches in height. For the Loo Choo Islands, see Beechey\r\n'Voyage' 4th. edition volume 1 page 499.), over an enormous and humid area,\r\nin Ava, Pegu, Siam, the Malayan archipelago, the Loo Choo Islands, and a\r\nlarge part of China, no full-sized horse is found. When we advance as far\r\neastward as Japan, the horse reacquires his full size. (2/24. J. Crawfurd,\r\n'History of the Horse' 'Journal of Royal United Service Institution' volume\r\n4.)\r\n\r\nWith most of our domesticated animals, some breeds are kept on account of\r\ntheir curiosity or beauty; but the horse is valued almost solely for its\r\nutility. Hence semi-monstrous breeds are not preserved; and probably all\r\nthe existing breeds have been slowly formed either by the direct action of\r\nthe conditions of life, or through the selection of individual differences.\r\nNo doubt semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton\r\nrecords (2/25. 'Essays on Natural History' 2nd series page 161.) the case\r\nof a mare which produced successively three foals without tails; so that a\r\ntailless race might have been formed like the tailless races of dogs and\r\ncats. A Russian breed of horses is said to have curled hair, and Azara\r\n(2/26. 'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 page 333. Dr. Canfield informs me\r\nthat a breed with curly hair was formed by selection at Los Angeles in\r\nNorth America.) relates that in Paraguay horses are occasionally born, but\r\nare generally destroyed, with hair like that on the head of a negro; and\r\nthis peculiarity is transmitted even to half-breeds: it is a curious case\r\nof correlation that such horses have short manes and tails, and their hoofs\r\nare of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection of\r\nqualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the formation of\r\nthe several breeds of the horse. Look at a dray-horse, and see how well\r\nadapted he is to draw heavy weights, and how unlike in appearance to any\r\nallied wild animal. The English race-horse is known to be derived from the\r\ncommingled blood of Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection, which was\r\ncarried on during very early times in England (2/27. See the evidence on\r\nthis head in 'Land and Water' May 2, 1868.), together with training, have\r\nmade him a very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a writer in\r\nIndia, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now, \"looking at\r\nour present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that they were the\r\nresult of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?\" The improvement is\r\nso marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup \"the first descendants of\r\nArabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are allowed a discount of 18 pounds\r\nweight; and when both parents are of these countries a discount of 36\r\npounds (2/28. Prof. Low 'Domesticated Animals' page 546. With respect to\r\nthe writer in India see 'India Sporting Review' volume 2 page 181. As\r\nLawrence has remarked ('The Horse' page 9), \"perhaps no instance has ever\r\noccurred of a three-part bred horse (i.e. a horse, one of whose\r\ngrandparents was of impure blood) saving his distance in running two miles\r\nwith thoroughbred racers.\" Some few instances are on record of seven-eights\r\nracers having been successful.) It is notorious that the Arabs have long\r\nbeen as careful about the pedigree of their horses as we are, and this\r\nimplies great and continued care in breeding. Seeing what has been done in\r\nEngland by careful breeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have\r\nproduced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of\r\ntheir horses? But we may go much farther back in time, for in the Bible we\r\nhear of studs carefully kept for breeding, and of horses imported at high\r\nprices from various countries. (2/29. Prof. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome\r\n2 page 144 has collected many facts on this head. For instance Solomon (1\r\nKings x. 28) bought horses in Egypt at a high price.) We may therefore\r\nconclude that, whether or not the various existing breeds of the horse have\r\nproceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks, yet that a great amount of\r\nchange has resulted from the direct action of the conditions of life, and\r\nprobably a still greater amount from the long-continued selection by man of\r\nslight individual differences.\r\n\r\nWith several domesticated quadrupeds and birds, certain coloured marks are\r\neither strongly inherited or tend to reappear after having been lost for a\r\nlong time. As this subject will hereafter be seen to be of importance, I\r\nwill give a full account of the colouring of horses. All English breeds,\r\nhowever unlike in size and appearance, and several of those in India and\r\nthe Malay archipelago, present a similar range and diversity of colour. The\r\nEnglish race-horse, however, is said (2/30. 'The Field' July 13, 1861 page\r\n42.) never to be dun-coloured; but as dun and cream-coloured horses are\r\nconsidered by the Arabs as worthless, \"and fit only for Jews to ride\"\r\n(2/31. E. Vernon Harcourt 'Sporting in Algeria' page 26.), these tints may\r\nhave been removed by long-continued selection. Horses of every colour, and\r\nof such widely different kinds as dray-horses, cobs, and ponies, are all\r\noccasionally dappled (2/32. I state this from my own observations made\r\nduring several years on the colours of horses. I have seen cream-coloured,\r\nlight-dun and mouse-dun horses dappled, which I mention because it has been\r\nstated (Martin 'History of the Horse' page 134) that duns are never\r\ndappled. Martin (page 205) refers to dappled asses. In the 'Farrier'\r\n(London 1828 pages 453, 455) there are some good remarks on the dappling of\r\nhorses; and likewise in Col. Hamilton Smith on 'The Horse.'), in the same\r\nmanner as is so conspicuous with grey horses. This fact does not throw any\r\nclear light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse, but is a case of\r\nanalogous variation, for even asses are sometimes dappled, and I have seen,\r\nin the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its\r\nhinder quarters. By the expression analogous variation (and it is one that\r\nI shall often have occasion to use) I mean a variation occurring in a\r\nspecies or variety which resembles a normal character in another and\r\ndistinct species or variety. Analogous variations may arise, as will be\r\nexplained in a future chapter, from two or more forms with a similar\r\nconstitution having been exposed to similar conditions,--or from one of two\r\nforms having reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the\r\nother form from their common progenitor,--or from both forms having\r\nreverted to the same ancestral character. We shall immediately see that\r\nhorses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over a large part\r\nof their bodies; and as we know that in the varieties of the domestic cat\r\nand in several feline species stripes readily pass into spots and cloudy\r\nmarks--even the cubs of the uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with dark\r\nmarks on a lighter ground--we may suspect that the dappling of the horse,\r\nwhich has been noticed by some authors with surprise, is a modification or\r\nvestige of a tendency to become striped.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 1. DUN DEVONSHIRE PONY, with shoulder, spinal, and leg stripes.)\r\n\r\n[This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects an\r\ninteresting fact. Horses of all colours, of the most diverse breeds, in\r\nvarious parts of the world, often have a dark stripe extending along the\r\nspine, from the mane to the tail; but this is so common that I need enter\r\ninto no particulars. (2/33. Some details are given in 'The Farrier' 1828\r\npages 452, 455. One of the smallest ponies I ever saw, of the colour of a\r\nmouse, had a conspicuous spinal stripe. A small Indian chestnut pony had\r\nthe same stripe, as had a remarkably heavy chestnut cart-horse. Race-horses\r\noften have the spinal stripe.) Occasionally horses are transversely barred\r\non the legs, chiefly on the under side; and more rarely they have a\r\ndistinct stripe on the shoulder, like that on the shoulder of the ass, or a\r\nbroad dark patch representing a stripe. Before entering on any details I\r\nmust premise that the term dun-coloured is vague, and includes three groups\r\nof colours, viz., that between cream-colour and reddish-brown, which\r\ngraduates into light-bay or light-chestnut--this, I believe is often called\r\nfallow-dun; secondly, leaden or slate-colour or mouse-dun, which graduates\r\ninto an ash-colour; and, lastly, dark-dun, between brown and black. In\r\nEngland I have examined a rather large, lightly-built, fallow-dun\r\nDevonshire pony (Figure 1), with a conspicuous stripe along the back, with\r\nlight transverse stripes on the under sides of its front legs, and with\r\nfour parallel stripes on each shoulder. Of these four stripes the posterior\r\none was very minute and faint; the anterior one, on the other hand, was\r\nlong and broad, but interrupted in the middle, and truncated at its lower\r\nextremity, with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point. I\r\nmention this latter fact because the shoulder-stripe of the ass\r\noccasionally presents exactly the same appearance. I have had an outline\r\nand description sent to me of a small, purely-bred, light fallow-dun Welch\r\npony, with a spinal stripe, a single transverse stripe on each leg, and\r\nthree shoulder-stripes; the posterior stripe corresponding with that on the\r\nshoulder of the ass was the longest, whilst the two anterior parallel\r\nstripes, arising from the mane, decreased in length, in a reversed manner\r\nas compared with the shoulder-stripes on the above-described Devonshire\r\npony. I have seen a bright fallow-dun cob, with its front legs transversely\r\nbarred on the under sides in the most conspicuous manner; also a dark-\r\nleaden mouse-coloured pony with similar leg stripes, but much less\r\nconspicuous; also a bright fallow-dun colt, fully three-parts thoroughbred,\r\nwith very plain transverse stripes on the legs; also a chestnut-dun cart-\r\nhorse with a conspicuous spinal stripe, with distinct traces of shoulder-\r\nstripes, but none on the legs; I could add other cases. My son made a\r\nsketch for me of a large, heavy, Belgian cart-horse, of a fallow-dun, with\r\na conspicuous spinal stripe, traces of leg-stripes, and with two parallel\r\n(three inches apart) stripes about seven or eight inches in length on both\r\nshoulders. I have seen another rather light cart-horse, of a dirty dark\r\ncream-colour, with striped legs, and on one shoulder a large ill-defined\r\ndark cloudy patch, and on the opposite shoulder two parallel faint stripes.\r\nAll the cases yet mentioned are duns of various tints; but Mr. W.W. Edwards\r\nhas seen a nearly thoroughbred chestnut horse which had the spinal stripe,\r\nand distinct bars on the legs; and I have seen two bay carriage-horses with\r\nblack spinal stripes; one of these horses had on each shoulder a light\r\nshoulder-stripe, and the other had a broad back ill-defined stripe, running\r\nobliquely half-way down each shoulder; neither had leg-stripes.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting case which I have met with occurred in a colt of my\r\nown breeding. A bay mare (descended from a dark-brown Flemish mare by a\r\nlight grey Turcoman horse) was put to Hercules, a thoroughbred dark bay,\r\nwhose sire (Kingston) and dam were both bays. The colt ultimately turned\r\nout brown; but when only a fortnight old it was a dirty bay, shaded with\r\nmouse-grey, and in parts with a yellowish tint: it had only a trace of the\r\nspinal stripe, with a few obscure transverse bars on the legs; but almost\r\nthe whole body was marked with very narrow dark stripes, in most parts so\r\nobscure as to be visible only in certain lights, like the stripes which may\r\nbe seen on black kittens. These stripes were distinct on the hind-quarters,\r\nwhere they diverged from the spine, and pointed a little forwards; many of\r\nthem as they diverged became a little branched, exactly in the same manner\r\nas in some zebrine species. The stripes were plainest on the forehead\r\nbetween the ears, where they formed a set of pointed arches, one under the\r\nother, decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle; exactly similar\r\nmarks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and Burchell's zebra. When\r\nthis foal was two or three months old all the stripes entirely disappeared.\r\nI have seen similar marks on the forehead of a fully grown, fallow-dun,\r\ncob-like horse, having a conspicuous spinal stripe, and with its front legs\r\nwell barred.\r\n\r\nIn Norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun, varying from\r\nalmost cream-colour to dark-mouse dun; and an animal is not considered\r\npurely bred unless it has the spinal and leg-stripes. (2/34. I have\r\nreceived information, through the kindness of the Consul-General, Mr. J.R.\r\nCrowe, from Prof. Boeck, Rasck, and Esmarck, on the colours of the\r\nNorwegian ponies. See also 'The Field' 1861 page 431.) My son estimated\r\nthat about a third of the ponies which he saw there had striped legs; he\r\ncounted seven stripes on the fore-legs and two on the hind-legs of one\r\npony; only a few of them exhibited traces of shoulder stripes; but I have\r\nheard of a cob imported from Norway which had the shoulder as well as the\r\nother stripes well developed. Colonel H. Smith (2/35. Col. Hamilton Smith\r\n'Nat. Lib.' volume 12 page 275.) alludes to dun-horses with the spinal\r\nstripe in the Sierras of Spain; and the horses originally derived from\r\nSpain, in some parts of South America, are now duns. Sir W. Elliot informs\r\nme that he inspected a herd of 300 South American horses imported into\r\nMadras, and many of these had transverse stripes on the legs and short\r\nshoulder-stripes; the most strongly marked individual, of which a coloured\r\ndrawing was sent me, was a mouse-dun, with the shoulder-stripes slightly\r\nforked.\r\n\r\nIn the North-Western parts of India striped horses of more than one breed\r\nare apparently commoner than in any other part of the world; and I have\r\nreceived information respecting them from several officers, especially from\r\nColonel Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major Campbell, Brigadier St. John, and\r\nothers. The Kattywar horses are often fifteen or sixteen hands in height,\r\nand are well but lightly built. They are of all colours, but the several\r\nkinds of duns prevail; and these are so generally striped, that a horse\r\nwithout stripes is not considered pure. Colonel Poole believes that all the\r\nduns have the spinal stripe, the leg-stripes are generally present, and he\r\nthinks that about half the horses have the shoulder-stripe; this stripe is\r\nsometimes double or treble on both shoulders. Colonel Poole has often seen\r\nstripes on the cheeks and sides of the nose. He has seen stripes on the\r\ngrey and bay Kattywars when first foaled, but they soon faded away. I have\r\nreceived other accounts of cream-coloured, bay, brown, and grey Kattywar\r\nhorses being striped. Eastward of India, the Shan (north of Burmah) ponies,\r\nas I am informed by Mr. Blyth, have spinal, leg, and shoulder stripes. Sir\r\nW. Elliot informs me that he saw two bay Pegu ponies with leg-stripes.\r\nBurmese and Javanese ponies are frequently dun-coloured, and have the three\r\nkinds of stripes, \"in the same degree as in England.\" (2/36. Mr. G. Clark\r\nin 'Annal and Mag. of Nat. History' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363. Mr.\r\nWallace informs me that he saw in Java a dun and clay-coloured horse with\r\nspinal and leg stripes.) Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he examined two light-\r\ndun ponies of two Chinese breeds, viz., those of Shanghai and Amoy; both\r\nhad the spinal stripe, and the latter an indistinct shoulder-stripe.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as different\r\nas possible, when of a dun-colour (including under this term a wide range\r\nof tint from cream to dusty black), and rarely when almost white tinged\r\nwith yellow, grey, bay, and chestnut, have the several above-specified\r\nstripes. Horses which are of a yellow colour with white mane and tail, and\r\nwhich are sometimes called duns, I have never seen with stripes. (2/37. See\r\nalso on this point 'The Field' July 27, 1861 page 91.)\r\n\r\nFrom reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on Reversion, I have\r\nendeavoured, but with poor success, to discover whether duns, which are so\r\nmuch oftener striped than other coloured horses, are ever produced from the\r\ncrossing of two horses, neither of which are duns. Most persons to whom I\r\nhave applied believe that one parent must be dun; and it is generally\r\nasserted that, when this is the case, the dun-colour and the stripes are\r\nstrongly inherited. (2/38. 'The Field' 1861 pages 431, 493, 545.) One case,\r\nhowever, has fallen under my own observation of a foal from a black mare by\r\na bay horse, which when fully grown was a dark fallow-dun and had a narrow\r\nbut plain spinal stripe. Hofacker (2/39. 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc.\r\n1828 s. 13, 14.) gives two instances of mouse-duns (Mausrapp) being\r\nproduced from two parents of different colours and neither duns.\r\n\r\nThe stripes of all kinds are generally plainer in the foal than in the\r\nadult horse, being commonly lost at the first shedding of the hair. (2/40.\r\nVon Nathusius 'Vortrage uber Viehzucht' 1872 135.) Colonel Poole believes\r\nthat \"the stripes in the Kattywar breed are plainest when the colt is first\r\nfoaled; they then become less and less distinct till after the first coat\r\nis shed, when they come out as strongly as before; but certainly often fade\r\naway as the age of the horse increases.\" Two other accounts confirm this\r\nfading of the stripes in old horses in India. One writer, on the other\r\nhand, states that colts are often born without stripes, but that they\r\nappear as the colt grows older. Three authorities affirm that in Norway the\r\nstripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult. In the case described\r\nby me of the young foal which was narrowly striped over nearly all its\r\nbody, there was no doubt about the early and complete disappearance of the\r\nstripes. Mr. W.W. Edwards examined for me twenty-two foals of race-horses,\r\nand twelve had the spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some\r\nother accounts which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal\r\nstripe often disappears in the English race-horse when old. With natural\r\nspecies, the young often exhibit characters which disappear at maturity.]\r\n\r\nThe stripes are variable in colour, but are always darker than the rest of\r\nthe body. They do not by any means always coexist on the different parts of\r\nthe body: the legs may be striped without any shoulder-stripe, or the\r\nconverse case, which is rarer, may occur; but I have never heard of either\r\nshoulder or leg-stripes without the spinal stripe. The latter is by far the\r\ncommonest of all the stripes, as might have been expected, as it\r\ncharacterises the other seven or eight species of the genus. It is\r\nremarkable that so trifling a character as the shoulder-stripe being double\r\nor triple should occur in such different breeds as Welch and Devonshire\r\nponies, the Shan pony, heavy cart-horses, light South American horses, and\r\nthe lanky Kattywar breed. Colonel Hamilton Smith believes that one of his\r\nfive supposed primitive stocks was dun-coloured and striped; and that the\r\nstripes in all the other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one\r\nprimitive dun; but it is extremely improbable that different breeds living\r\nin such distant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any\r\none aboriginally distinct stock. Nor have we any reason to believe that the\r\neffects of a cross at a very remote period would be propagated for so many\r\ngenerations as is implied on this view.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun, Colonel\r\nHamilton Smith (2/41. 'Nat. Library' volume 12 1841 pages 109, 156 to 163,\r\n280, 281. Cream-colour, passing into Isabella (i.e. the colour of the dirty\r\nlinen of Queen Isabella), seems to have been common in ancient times. See\r\nalso Pallas's account of the wild horses of the East, who speaks of dun and\r\nbrown as the prevalent colours. In the Icelandic sagas, which were\r\ncommitted to writing in the twelfth century, dun-coloured horses with a\r\nblack spinal stripe are mentioned; see Dasent's translation volume 1 page\r\n169.) has collected a large body of evidence showing that this tint was\r\ncommon in the East as far back as the time of Alexander, and that the wild\r\nhorses of Western Asia and Eastern Europe now are, or recently were, of\r\nvarious shades of dun. It seems that not very long ago a wild breed of dun-\r\ncoloured horses with a spinal stripe was preserved in the royal parks in\r\nPrussia. I hear from Hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at\r\nthe duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock, and so it is in\r\nNorway. Dun-coloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts of\r\nDevonshire, Wales, and Scotland, where the aboriginal breed would have the\r\nbest chance of being preserved. In South America in the time of Azara, when\r\nthe horse had been feral for about 250 years, 90 out of  100 horses were\r\n\"bai-chatains,\" and the remaining ten were \"zains,\" that is brown; not more\r\nthan one in 2000 being black. In North America the feral horses show a\r\nstrong tendency to become roans of various shades; but in certain parts, as\r\nI hear from Dr. Canfield, they are mostly duns and striped. (2/42. Azara\r\n'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 page 307. In North America Catlin (volume\r\n2 page 57) describes the wild horses, believed to have descended from the\r\nSpanish horses of Mexico, as of all colours, black, grey, roan, and roan\r\npied with sorrel. F. Michaux 'Travels in North America' English translation\r\npage 235, describes two wild horses from Mexico as roan. In the Falkland\r\nIslands, where the horse has been feral only between 60 and 70 years, I was\r\ntold that roans and iron-greys were the prevalent colours. These several\r\nfacts show that horses do not soon revert to any uniform colour.)\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters on the Pigeon we shall see that a blue bird is\r\noccasionally produced by pure breeds of various colours and that when this\r\noccurs certain black marks invariably appear on the wings and tail; so\r\nagain, when variously coloured breeds are crossed, blue birds with the same\r\nblack marks are frequently produced. We shall further see that these facts\r\nare explained by, and afford strong evidence in favour of, the view that\r\nall the breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon, or Columba livia, which\r\nis thus coloured and marked. But the appearance of the stripes on the\r\nvarious breeds of the horse, when of a dun colour, does not afford nearly\r\nsuch good evidence of their descent from a single primitive stock as in the\r\ncase of the pigeon: because no horse certainly wild is known as a standard\r\nof comparison; because the stripes when they appear are variable in\r\ncharacter; because there is far from sufficient evidence that the crossing\r\nof distinct breeds produces stripes, and lastly, because all the species of\r\nthe genus Equus have the spinal stripe, and several species have shoulder\r\nand leg stripes. Nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct breeds in\r\ntheir general range of colour, in their dappling, and in the occasional\r\nappearance, especially in duns, of leg-stripes and of double or triple\r\nshoulder-stripes, taken together, indicate the probability of the descent\r\nof all the existing races from a single, dun-coloured, more or less\r\nstriped, primitive stock, to which our horses occasionally revert.\r\n\r\nTHE ASS.\r\n\r\nFour species of Asses, besides three zebras, have been described by\r\nnaturalists. There is now little doubt that our domesticated animal is\r\ndescended from the Equus taeniopus of Abyssinia. (2/43. Dr. Sclater in\r\n'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 164. Dr. Hartmann says ('Annalen der Landw.'\r\nb. 44 page 222) that this animal in its wild state is not always striped\r\nacross the legs.) The ass is sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal\r\ndomesticated, as we know by the Old Testament, from an ancient period,\r\nwhich has varied only in a very slight degree. But this is by no means\r\nstrictly true; for in Syria alone there are four breeds (2/44. W.C. Martin\r\n'History of the Horse' 1845 page 207.); first, a light and graceful animal,\r\nwith an agreeable gait, used by ladies; secondly, an Arab breed reserved\r\nexclusively for the saddle; thirdly, a stouter animal used for ploughing\r\nand various purposes; and lastly, the large Damascus breed, with a\r\npeculiarly long body and ears. In the South of France also there are\r\nseveral breeds, and one of extraordinary size, some individuals being as\r\ntall as full-sized horses. Although the ass in England is by no means\r\nuniform in appearance, distinct breeds have not been formed. This may\r\nprobably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by poor persons,\r\nwho do not rear large numbers, nor carefully match and select the young.\r\nFor, as we shall see in a future chapter, the ass can with ease be greatly\r\nimproved in size and strength by careful selection, combined no doubt with\r\ngood food; and we may infer that all its other characters would be equally\r\namenable to selection. The small size of the ass in England and Northern\r\nEurope is apparently due far more to want of care in breeding than to cold;\r\nfor in Western India, where the ass is used as a beast of burden by some of\r\nthe lower castes, it is not much larger than a Newfoundland dog, \"being\r\ngenerally not more than from twenty to thirty inches high.\" (2/45. Col.\r\nSykes Cat. of Mammalia 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' July 12, 1831. Williamson\r\n'Oriental Field Sports' volume 2 quoted by Martin page 206.)\r\n\r\nThe ass varies greatly in colour; and its legs, especially the fore-legs,\r\nboth in England and other countries--for instance, in China--are\r\noccasionally barred more plainly than those of dun-coloured horses.\r\nThirteen or fourteen transverse stripes have been counted on both the fore\r\nand hind legs. With the horse the occasional appearance of leg-stripes was\r\naccounted for by reversion to a supposed parent-form, and in the case of\r\nthe ass we may confidently believe in this explanation, as E. taeniopus is\r\nknown to be barred, though only in a slight degree, and not quite\r\ninvariably. The stripes are believed to occur most frequently and to be\r\nplainest on the legs of the domestic ass during early youth (2/46. Blyth in\r\n'Charlesworth's Mag. of Nat. Hist.' vol 4 1840 page 83. I have also been\r\nassured by a breeder that this is the case.), as likewise occurs with the\r\nhorse. The shoulder-stripe, which is so eminently characteristic of the\r\nspecies, is nevertheless variable in breadth, length, and manner of\r\ntermination. I have measured one four times as broad as another, and some\r\nmore than twice as long as others. In one light-grey ass the shoulder-\r\nstripe was only six inches in length, and as thin as a piece of string; and\r\nin another animal of the same colour there was only a dusky shade\r\nrepresenting a stripe. I have heard of three white asses, not albinoes,\r\nwith no trace of shoulder or spinal stripes (2/47. One case is given by\r\nMartin 'The Horse' page 205.); and I have seen nine other asses with no\r\nshoulder-stripe, and some of them had no spinal stripe. Three of the nine\r\nwere light-greys, one a dark-grey, another grey passing into reddish-roan,\r\nand the others were brown, two being tinted on parts of their bodies with a\r\nreddish or bay shade. If therefore grey and reddish-brown asses had been\r\nsteadily selected and bred from, the shoulder stripe would probably have\r\nbeen lost almost as generally and completely as in the case of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes double, and Mr. Blyth has seen\r\neven three or four parallel stripes. (2/48. 'Journal As. Soc. of Bengal'\r\nvolume 28 1860 page 231. Martin on the Horse page 205.) I have observed in\r\nten cases shoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end, with the\r\nanterior angle produced into a tapering point, precisely as in the above\r\ndun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the terminal portion\r\nabruptly and angularly bent; and have seen and heard of four cases of a\r\ndistinct though slight forking of the stripe. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his\r\nparty observed for me no less than five similar instances of the shoulder-\r\nstripe plainly bifurcating over the fore leg. In the common mule it\r\nlikewise sometimes bifurcates. When I first noticed the forking and angular\r\nbending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes in the\r\nvarious equine species to feel convinced that even a character so\r\nunimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led to attend to\r\nthe subject. I now find that in the E. burchellii and quagga, the stripe\r\nwhich corresponds with the shoulder-stripe of the ass, as well as some of\r\nthe stripes on the neck, bifurcate, and that some of those near the\r\nshoulder have their extremities bent angularly backwards. The bifurcation\r\nand angular bending of the stripes on the shoulders apparently are\r\nconnected with the nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck\r\nchanging their direction and becoming transverse on the legs. Finally, we\r\nsee that the presence of shoulder, leg, and spinal stripes in the horse,--\r\ntheir occasional absence in the ass,--the occurrence of double and triple\r\nshoulder-stripes in both animals, and the similar manner in which these\r\nstripes terminate downwards,--are all cases of analogous variation in the\r\nhorse and ass. These cases are probably not due to similar conditions\r\nacting on similar constitutions, but to a partial reversion in colour to\r\nthe common progenitor of the genus. We shall hereafter return to this\r\nsubject, and discuss it more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III.\r\n\r\nPIGS--CATTLE--SHEEP--GOATS.\r\n\r\nPIGS BELONG TO TWO DISTINCT TYPES, SUS SCROFA AND INDICUS.\r\nTORFSCHWEIN.\r\nJAPAN PIGS.\r\nFERTILITY OF CROSSED PIGS.\r\nCHANGES IN THE SKULL OF THE HIGHLY CULTIVATED RACES.\r\nCONVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.\r\nGESTATION.\r\nSOLID-HOOFED SWINE.\r\nCURIOUS APPENDAGES TO THE JAWS.\r\nDECREASE IN SIZE OF THE TUSKS.\r\nYOUNG PIGS LONGITUDINALLY STRIPED.\r\nFERAL PIGS.\r\nCROSSED BREEDS.\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\nZEBU A DISTINCT SPECIES.\r\nEUROPEAN CATTLE PROBABLY DESCENDED FROM THREE WILD FORMS.\r\nALL THE RACES NOW FERTILE TOGETHER.\r\nBRITISH PARK CATTLE.\r\nON THE COLOUR OF THE ABORIGINAL SPECIES.\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES.\r\nSOUTH AFRICAN RACES.\r\nSOUTH AMERICAN RACES.\r\nNIATA CATTLE.\r\nORIGIN OF THE VARIOUS RACES OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\nREMARKABLE RACES OF.\r\nVARIATIONS ATTACHED TO THE MALE SEX.\r\nADAPTATIONS TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS.\r\nGESTATION OF.\r\nCHANGES IN THE WOOL.\r\nSEMI-MONSTROUS BREEDS.\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\nREMARKABLE VARIATIONS OF.\r\n\r\nThe breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied, though much\r\nstill remains to be done, than those of almost any other domesticated\r\nanimal. This has been effected by Hermann von Nathusius in two admirable\r\nworks, especially in the later one on the Skulls of the several races, and\r\nby Rutimeyer in his celebrated Fauna of the ancient Swiss lake-dwellings.\r\n(3/1. Hermann von Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' Berlin 1860; and\r\n'Vorstudien fur Geschichte' etc. 'Schweineschadel' Berlin 1864. Rutimeyer\r\n'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' Basel 1861.) Nathusius has shown that all the\r\nknown breeds may be divided into two great groups: one resembling in all\r\nimportant respects and no doubt descended from the common wild boar; so\r\nthat this may be called the Sus scrofa group. The other group differs in\r\nseveral important and constant osteological characters; its wild parent-\r\nform is unknown; the name given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of\r\npriority, is Sus indicus, of Pallas. This name must now be followed, though\r\nan unfortunate one, as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit India, and the\r\nbest-known domesticated breeds have been imported from Siam and China.\r\n\r\nFirst for the Sus scrofa breeds, or those resembling the common wild boar.\r\nThese still exist, according to Nathusius ('Schweineschadel' s. 75), in\r\nvarious parts of central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom (3/2.\r\nNathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' Berlin 1860. An excellent appendix is\r\ngiven with references to published and trustworthy drawings of the breeds\r\nof each country), and almost every province in Britain, possessed its own\r\nnative breed; but these are now everywhere rapidly disappearing, being\r\nreplaced by improved breeds crossed with the S. indicus form. The skull in\r\nthe breeds of the S. scrofa type resembles, in all important respects, that\r\nof the European wild boar; but it has become ('Schweineschadel' s. 63-68)\r\nhigher and broader relatively to its length; and the hinder part is more\r\nupright. The differences, however, are all variable in degree. The breeds\r\nwhich thus resemble S. scrofa in their essential skull characters differ\r\nconspicuously from each other in other respects, as in the length of the\r\nears and legs, curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and\r\nproportions of the body.\r\n\r\nThe wild Sus scrofa has a wide range, namely, Europe, North Africa, as\r\nidentified by osteological characters by Rutimeyer, and Hindostan, as\r\nsimilarly identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars inhabiting these\r\nseveral countries differ so much from each other in external characters,\r\nthat they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct.\r\nEven within Hindostan these animals, according to Mr. Blyth, form very\r\ndistinct races in the different districts; in the N. Western provinces, as\r\nI am informed by the Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in\r\nheight, whilst in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In\r\nEurope, Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been known to\r\ncross with the wild native species (3/3. For Europe see Bechstein\r\n'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' 1801 b. 1 s. 505. Several accounts have been\r\npublished on the fertility of the offspring from wild and tame swine. See\r\nBurdach 'Physiology' and Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 370. For Africa\r\n'Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 4 page 389. For India see Nathusius\r\n'Schweineschadel' s. 148.); and in Hindostan an accurate observer (3/4. Sir\r\nW. Elliot Catalogue of Mammalia 'Madras Journal of Lit. and Science' volume\r\n10 page 219.), Sir Walter Elliot, after describing the differences between\r\nwild Indian and wild German boars, remarks that \"the same differences are\r\nperceptible in the domesticated individuals of the two countries.\" We may\r\ntherefore conclude that the breeds of the Sus scrofa type are descended\r\nfrom, or have been modified by crossing with, forms which may be ranked as\r\ngeographical races, but which, according to some naturalists, ought to be\r\nranked as distinct species.\r\n\r\nPigs of the Sus indicus type are best known to Englishmen under the form of\r\nthe Chinese breed. The skull of S. indicus, as described by Nathusius,\r\ndiffers from that of S. scrofa in several minor respects, as in its greater\r\nbreadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the shortness of\r\nthe lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore part of the palate-\r\nbones, and in the divergence of the premolar teeth. It deserves especial\r\nnotice that these latter characters are not gained, even in the least\r\ndegree, by the domesticated forms of S. scrofa. After reading the remarks\r\nand descriptions given by Nathusius, it seems to me to be merely playing\r\nwith words to doubt whether S. indicus ought to be ranked as a species; for\r\nthe above-specified differences are more strongly marked than any that can\r\nbe pointed out between, for instance, the fox and the wolf, or the ass and\r\nthe horse. As already stated, S. indicus is not known in a wild state; but\r\nits domesticated forms, according to Nathusius, come near to S. vittatus of\r\nJava and some allied species. A pig found wild in the Aru islands\r\n('Schweineschadel' s. 169) is apparently identical with S. indicus; but it\r\nis doubtful whether this is a truly native animal. The domesticated breeds\r\nof China, Cochin-China, and Siam belong to this type. The Roman or\r\nNeapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and the \"Krause\" swine of\r\nNathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and Turkey, and having fine\r\ncurly hair, and the small Swiss \"Bundtnerschwein\" of Rutimeyer, all agree\r\nin their more important skull-characters with S. indicus, and, as is\r\nsupposed, have all been largely crossed with this form. Pigs of this type\r\nhave existed during a long period on the shores of the Mediterranean, for a\r\nfigure ('Schweineschadel' s. 142) closely resembling the existing\r\nNeapolitan pig was found in the buried city of Herculaneum.\r\n\r\nRutimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived\r\ncontemporaneously in Switzerland, during the Neolithic period, two\r\ndomesticated forms, the S. scrofa, and the S. scrofa palustris or\r\nTorfschwein. Rutimeyer perceived that the latter approached the Eastern\r\nbreeds, and, according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs to the S. indicus\r\ngroup; but Rutimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs in some well-\r\nmarked characters. This author was formerly convinced that his Torfschwein\r\nexisted as a wild animal during the first part of the Stone period, and was\r\ndomesticated during a later part of the same period. (3/5. 'Pfahlbauten' s.\r\n163 et passim.) Nathusius, whilst he fully admits the curious fact first\r\nobserved by Rutimeyer, that the bones of domesticated and wild animals can\r\nbe distinguished by their different aspect, yet, from special difficulties\r\nin the case of the bones of the pig ('Schweineschadel' s. 147), is not\r\nconvinced of the truth of the above conclusion; and Rutimeyer himself seems\r\nnow to feel some doubt. Other naturalists have also argued strongly on the\r\nsame side as Nathusius. (3/6. See J.W. Schutz' interesting essay 'Zur\r\nKenntniss des Torfschweins' 1868. This author believes that the Torfschwein\r\nis descended from a distinct species, the S. sennariensis of Central\r\nAfrica.)\r\n\r\nSeveral breeds, differing in the proportions of the body, in the length of\r\nthe ears, in the nature of the hair, in colour, etc., come under the S.\r\nindicus type. Nor is this surprising, considering how ancient the\r\ndomestication of this form has been both in Europe and in China. In this\r\nlatter country the date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar (3/7.\r\nStan. Julien quoted by de Blainville 'Osteographie' page 163.) to go back\r\nat least 4900 years from the present time. This same scholar alludes to the\r\nexistence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and at the present\r\ntime the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and tending their\r\npigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to place. (3/8. Richardson\r\n'Pigs, their Origin' etc. page 26.) Hence these pigs, as Nathusius has\r\nremarked (3/9. 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 47, 64.), display in an eminent\r\ndegree the characters of a highly-cultivated race, and hence, no doubt,\r\ntheir high value in the improvement of our European breeds. Nathusius makes\r\na remarkable statement ('Schweineschadel' s. 138), that the infusion of the\r\n1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part of the blood of S. indicus into a breed\r\nof S. scrofa, is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the latter\r\nspecies. This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the\r\nchief distinctive characters of S. indicus, such as the shortness of the\r\nlachrymal bones, etc., being common to several species of the genus; for in\r\ncrosses characters which are common to many species apparently tend to be\r\nprepotent over those appertaining to only a few species.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 2. HEAD OF JAPAN OR MASKED PIG. (Copied from Mr. Bartlett's paper\r\nin 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1861 page 263.))\r\n\r\nThe Japan pig (S. pliciceps of Gray), which was formerly exhibited in the\r\nZoological Gardens, has an extraordinary appearance from its short head,\r\nbroad forehead and nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin.\r\nFigure 2 is copied from that given by Mr. Bartlett. (3/10. 'Proc. Zoolog.\r\nSoc.' 1861 page 263.) Not only is the face furrowed, but thick folds of\r\nskin, which are harder than the other parts, almost like the plates on the\r\nIndian rhinoceros, hang about the shoulders and rump. It is coloured black,\r\nwith white feet, and breeds true. That it has long been domesticated there\r\ncan be little doubt; and this might have been inferred even from the fact\r\nthat its young are not longitudinally striped; for this is a character\r\ncommon to all the species included within the genus Sus and the allied\r\ngenera whilst in their natural state. (3/11. Sclater in 'Proc. Zoolog.\r\nSoc.' February 26, 1861.) Dr. Gray (3/12. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page\r\n13. The skull has since been described much more fully by Professor Lucae\r\nin a very interesting essay, 'Der Schadel des Maskenschweines' 1870. He\r\nconfirms the conclusion of von Nathusius on the relationship of this kind\r\nof pig.) has described the skull of this animal, which he ranks not only as\r\na distinct species, but places it in a distinct section of the genus.\r\nNathusius, however, after his careful study of the whole group, states\r\npositively ('Schweineschadel' s. 153-158). that the skull in all essential\r\ncharacters closely resembles that of the short-eared Chinese breed of the\r\nS. indicus type. Hence Nathusius considers the Japan pig as only a\r\ndomesticated variety of S. indicus: if this really be the case, it is a\r\nwonderful instance of the amount of modification which can be effected\r\nunder domestication.\r\n\r\nFormerly there existed in the central islands of the Pacific Ocean a\r\nsingular breed of pigs. These are described by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G.\r\nBennett (3/13. 'Journal of Voyages and Travels from 1821 to 1829' volume 1\r\npage 300.) as of small size, hump-backed, with a disproportionately long\r\nhead, with short ears turned backwards, with a bushy tail not more than two\r\ninches in length, placed as if it grew from the back. Within half a century\r\nafter the introduction of European and Chinese pigs into these islands, the\r\nnative breed, according to the above authors, became almost completely lost\r\nby being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have been\r\nexpected, seem favourable for the production or retention of peculiar\r\nbreeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been described as very\r\nsmall, with erect and sharp ears, and \"with an appearance altogether\r\ndifferent from the hogs brought from the south.\" (3/14. Rev. G. Low 'Fauna\r\nOrcadensis' page 10. See also Dr. Hibbert's account of the pig of the\r\nShetland Islands.)\r\n\r\nSeeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the Sus indicus type,\r\nare in their osteological characters and in external appearance from the\r\npigs of the S. scrofa type, so that they must be considered specifically\r\ndistinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese and common\r\npigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with unimpaired\r\nfertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese pigs assured me that\r\nthe fertility of the half-breeds inter se and of their recrossed progeny\r\nwas actually increased; and this is the general belief of agriculturists.\r\nAgain, the Japan pig or S. pliciceps of Gray is so distinct in appearance\r\nfrom all common pigs, that it stretches one's belief to the utmost to admit\r\nthat it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed has been found\r\nperfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton informs me that\r\nhe paired a half-bred brother and sister and found them quite fertile\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 3. HEAD OF WILD BOAR, AND OF \"GOLDEN DAYS,\" a pig of the Yorkshire\r\nLarge Breed; the latter from a photograph. (Copied from Sidney's edition of\r\n'The Pig' by Youatt.))\r\n\r\nThe modification of the skull in the most highly cultivated races is\r\nwonderful. To appreciate the amount of change, Nathusius' work, with its\r\nexcellent figures, should be studied. The whole of the exterior in all its\r\nparts has been altered: the hinder surface, instead of sloping backwards,\r\nis directed forwards, entailing many changes in other parts; the front of\r\nthe head is deeply concave; the orbits have a different shape; the auditory\r\nmeatus has a different direction and shape; the incisors of the upper and\r\nlower jaws do not touch each other, and they stand in both jaws beyond the\r\nplane of the molars; the canines of the upper jaw stand in front of those\r\nof the lower jaw, and this is a remarkable anomaly: the articular surfaces\r\nof the occipital condyles are so greatly changed in shape, that, as\r\nNathusius remarks (s. 133), no naturalist, seeing this important part of\r\nthe skull by itself, would suppose that it belonged to the genus Sus. These\r\nand various other modifications, as Nathusius observes, can hardly be\r\nconsidered as monstrosities, for they are not injurious, and are strictly\r\ninherited. The whole head is much shortened; thus, whilst in common breeds\r\nits length to that of the body is as 1 to 6, in the \"cultur-racen\" the\r\nproportion is as 1 to 9, and even recently as 1 to 11. (3/15. 'Die Racen\r\ndes Schweines' s. 70.) Figure 3 (3/16. These woodcuts are copied from\r\nengravings given in Mr. S. Sidney's excellent edition of 'The Pig' by\r\nYouatt 1860. See pages 1, 16, 19.) of the head of a wild boar and of a sow\r\nfrom a photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed, may aid in showing how\r\ngreatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been modified and\r\nshortened.\r\n\r\nNathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes in the\r\nskull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated races have\r\nundergone. These modifications occur chiefly in the pure and crossed races\r\nof the S. indicus type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in\r\nthe slightly improved breeds of the S. scrofa type. (3/17.\r\n'Schweineschadel' s. 74, 135.) Nathusius states positively (s. 99, 103), as\r\nthe result of common experience and of his experiments, that rich and\r\nabundant food, given during youth, tends by some direct action to make the\r\nhead broader and shorter; and that poor food works a contrary result. He\r\nlays much stress on the fact that all wild and semi-domesticated pigs, in\r\nploughing up the ground with their muzzles, have,\r\nwhilst young, to exert the powerful muscles fixed to the hinder part of the\r\nhead. In highly cultivated races this habit is no longer followed, and\r\nconsequently the back of the skull becomes modified in shape, entailing\r\nother changes in other parts. There can hardly be a doubt that so great a\r\nchange in habits would affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful how\r\nfar this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and for\r\nits concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself advancing many\r\ncases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in many domestic animals--in\r\nbull- and pug-dogs, in the niata cattle, in sheep, in Polish fowls, short-\r\nfaced tumbler pigeons, and in one variety of the carp--for the bones of the\r\nface to become greatly shortened. In the case of the dog, as H. Muller has\r\nshown, this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial cartilage.\r\nWe may, however, readily admit that abundant and rich food supplied during\r\nmany generations would give an inherited tendency to increased size of\r\nbody, and that, from disuse, the limbs would become finer and shorter.\r\n(3/18. Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 71.) We shall in a future\r\nchapter see also that the skull and limbs are apparently in some manner\r\ncorrelated, so that any change in the one tends to affect the other.\r\n\r\nNathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one, that the\r\npeculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is\r\nnot characteristic of any one race, but is common to all when improved up\r\nto the same standard. Thus the large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds\r\nwith a convex back, and the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with\r\na concave back, when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble\r\neach other in the form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is\r\npartly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races, and\r\npartly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose, namely, for the\r\ngreatest amount of flesh and fat; so that selection has always tended\r\ntowards one and the same end. With most domestic animals the result of\r\nselection has been divergence of character, here it has been convergence.\r\n(3/19. 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 47. 'Schweineschadel' s. 104. Compare\r\nalso the figures of the old Irish and the improved Irish breeds in\r\nRichardson on 'The Pig' 1847.)\r\n\r\nThe nature of the food supplied during many generations has apparently\r\naffected the length of the intestines; for, according to Cuvier (3/20.\r\nQuoted by Isid. Geoffroy 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 441.), their length\r\nto that of the body in the wild boar is as 9 to 1,--in the common domestic\r\nboar as 13.5 to 1,--and in the Siam breed as 16 to 1. In this latter breed\r\nthe greater length may be due either to descent from a distinct species or\r\nto more ancient domestication. The number of mammae vary, as does the\r\nperiod of gestation. The latest authority says (3/21. S. Sidney 'The Pig'\r\npage 61.) that \"the period averages from 17 to 20 weeks,\" but I think there\r\nmust be some error in this statement: in M. Tessier's observations on 25\r\nsows it varied from 109 to 123 days. The Rev. W.D. Fox has given me ten\r\ncarefully recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied\r\nfrom 101 to 116 days. According to Nathusius the period is shortest in the\r\nraces which come early to maturity; but the course of their development\r\ndoes not appear to be actually shortened, for the young animal is born,\r\njudging from the state of the skull, less fully developed, or in a more\r\nembryonic condition (3/22. 'Schweineschadel' s. 2, 20.) than in the case of\r\ncommon swine. In the highly cultivated and early matured races the teeth,\r\nalso, are developed earlier.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the number of the vertebrae and ribs in different kinds\r\nof pigs, as observed by Mr. Eyton (3/23. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1837 page 23.\r\nI have not given the caudal vertebrae, as Mr. Eyton says some might\r\npossibly have been lost. I have added together the dorsal and lumbar\r\nvertebrae, owing to Prof. Owen's remarks ('Journal Linn. Soc.' volume 2\r\npage 28) on the difference between dorsal and lumbar vertebrae depending\r\nonly on the development of the ribs. Nevertheless the difference in the\r\nnumber of the ribs in pigs deserves notice. M. Sanson gives the number of\r\nlumbar vertebrae in various pigs; 'Comptes Rendus' 93 page 843.), and as\r\ngiven in the following table, has often been quoted. The African sow\r\nprobably belongs to the S. scrofa type; and Mr. Eyton informs me that,\r\nsince the publication of this paper, cross-bred animals from the African\r\nand English races were found by Lord Hill to be perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2: NUMBER OF VERTEBRAE IN VARIOUS PIGS:\r\n\r\nENGLISH LONG-LEGGED MALE.\r\n\r\nDorsal 15.

From the time of Aristotle to\r\nthe present time solid-hoofed swine have occasionally been observed in\r\nvarious parts of the world. Although this peculiarity is strongly\r\ninherited, it is hardly probable that all the animals with solid hoofs have\r\ndescended from the same parents; it is more probable that the same\r\npeculiarity has reappeared at various times and places. Dr. Struthers has\r\nlately described and figured (3/24. 'Edinburgh New Philosoph. Journal'\r\nApril 1863. See also De Blainville 'Osteographie' page 128 for various\r\nauthorities on this subject.) the structure of the feet; in both front and\r\nhind feet the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a\r\nsingle, great, hoof-bearing phalanx; and in the front feet, the middle\r\nphalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards the lower end,\r\nbut bears two separate articulations towards the upper end. From other\r\naccounts it appears that an intermediate toe is likewise sometimes\r\nsuperadded.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 4. OLD IRISH PIG, with jaw appendages. (Copied from H.D. Richardson\r\non Pigs.))\r\n\r\nAnother curious anomaly is offered by the appendages, described by M.\r\nEudes-Deslongchamps as often characterizing the Normandy pigs. These\r\nappendages are always attached to the same spot, to the corners of the jaw;\r\nthey are cylindrical, about three inches in length, covered with bristles,\r\nand with a pencil of bristles rising out of a sinus on one side: they have\r\na cartilaginous centre, with two small longitudinal muscles they occur\r\neither symmetrically on both sides of the face or on one side alone.\r\nRichardson figures them on the gaunt old \"Irish Greyhound pig;\" and\r\nNathusius states that they occasionally appear in all the long eared races,\r\nbut are not strictly inherited, for they occur or fail in animals of the\r\nsame litter. (3/25. Eudes-Deslongchamps 'Memoires de la Soc. Linn. de\r\nNormandie' volume 7 1842 page 41. Richardson 'Pigs, their Origin, etc.'\r\n1847 page 30. Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' 1863 s. 54.) As no wild\r\npigs are known to have analogous appendages, we have at present no reason\r\nto suppose that their appearance is due to reversion; and if this be so, we\r\nare forced to admit that a somewhat complex, though apparently useless,\r\nstructure may be suddenly developed without the aid of selection.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the boars of all domesticated breeds have much\r\nshorter tusks than wild boars. Many facts show that with many animals the\r\nstate of the hair is much affected by exposure to, or protection from,\r\nclimate; and as we see that the state of the hair and teeth are correlated\r\nin Turkish dogs (other analogous facts will be hereafter given), may we not\r\nventure to surmise that the reduction of the tusks in the domestic boar is\r\nrelated to his coat of bristles being diminished from living under shelter?\r\nOn the other hand, as we shall immediately see, the tusks and bristles\r\nreappear with feral boars, which are no longer protected from the weather.\r\nIt is not surprising that the tusks should be more affected than the other\r\nteeth; as parts developed to serve as secondary sexual characters are\r\nalways liable to much variation.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the young of wild European and Indian pigs\r\n(3/26. D. Johnson 'Sketches of Indian Field Sports' page 272. Mr. Crawfurd\r\ninforms me that the same fact holds good with the wild pigs of the Malay\r\npeninsula.), for the first six months, are longitudinally banded with\r\nlight-coloured stripes. This character generally disappears under\r\ndomestication. The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped young, as\r\nhave those of Westphalia, \"whatever may be their hue\" (3/27. For Turkish\r\npigs see Desmarest 'Mammalogie' 1820 page 391. For those of Westphalia see\r\nRichardson 'Pigs, their Origin, etc.' 1847 page 41.); whether these latter\r\npigs belong to the same curly-haired race as the Turkish swine, I do not\r\nknow. The pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of\r\nNew Granada, both those which are black and those which are black with a\r\nwhite band across the stomach, often extending over the back, have resumed\r\nthis aboriginal character and produce longitudinally-striped young. This is\r\nlikewise the case, at least occasionally, with the neglected pigs in the\r\nZambesi settlement on the coast of Africa. (3/28. With respect to the\r\nseveral foregoing and following statements on feral pigs see Roulin in\r\n'Mem. presentes par divers Savans a l'Acad.' etc. Paris tome 6 1835 page\r\n326. It should be observed that his account does not apply to truly feral\r\npigs; but to pigs long introduced into the country and living in a half-\r\nwild state. For the truly feral pigs of Jamaica see Gosse 'Sojourn in\r\nJamaica' 1851 page 386; and Col Hamilton Smith in 'Nat. Library' volume 9\r\npage 93. With respect to Africa see Livingstone 'Expedition to the Zambesi'\r\n1865 page 153. The most precise statement with respect to the tusks of the\r\nWest Indian feral boars is by P. Labat quoted by Roulin; but this author\r\nattributes the state of these pigs to descent from a domestic stock which\r\nhe saw in Spain. Admiral Sulivan, R.N., had ample opportunities of\r\nobserving the wild pigs on Eagle Islet in the Falklands; and he informs me\r\nthat they resembled wild boars with bristly ridged backs and large tusks.\r\nThe pigs which have run wild in the province of Buenos Ayres (Rengger\r\n'Saugethiere' s. 331) have not reverted to the wild type. De Blainville\r\n'Osteographie' page 132 refers to two skulls of domestic pigs sent from\r\nPatagonia by Al. d'Orbigny, and he states that they have the occipital\r\nelevation of the wild European boar, but that the head altogether is \"plus\r\ncourte et plus ramassee.\" He refers also to the skin of a feral pig from\r\nNorth America, and says \"il ressemble tout a fait a un petit sanglier, mais\r\nil est presque tout noir, et peut-etre un peu plus ramasse dans ses\r\nformes.\"\r\n\r\nThe common belief that all domesticated animals, when they run wild, revert\r\ncompletely to the character of their parent-stock, is chiefly founded, as\r\nfar as I can discover, on feral pigs. But even in this case the belief is\r\nnot grounded on sufficient evidence; for the two main types, namely, S.\r\nscrofa and indicus, have not been distinguished. The young, as we have just\r\nseen, reacquire their longitudinal stripes, and the boars invariably\r\nreassume their tusks. They revert also in the general shape of their\r\nbodies, and in the length of their legs and muzzles, to the state of the\r\nwild animal, as might have been expected from the amount of exercise which\r\nthey are compelled to take in search of food. In Jamaica the feral pigs do\r\nnot acquire the full size of the European wild boar, \"never attaining a\r\ngreater height than 20 inches at the shoulder.\" In various countries they\r\nreassume their original bristly covering, but in different degrees,\r\ndependent on the climate; thus, according to Roulin, the semi-feral pigs in\r\nthe hot valleys of New Granada are very scantily clothed; whereas, on the\r\nParamos, at the height of 7000 to 8000 feet, they acquire a thick covering\r\nof wool lying under the bristles, like that on the truly wild pigs of\r\nFrance. These pigs on the Paramos are small and stunted. The wild boar of\r\nIndia is said to have the bristles at the end of its tail arranged like the\r\nplumes of an arrow, whilst the European boar has a simple tuft; and it is a\r\ncurious fact that many, but not all, of the feral pigs in Jamaica, derived\r\nfrom a Spanish stock, have a plumed tail. (3/29. Gosse 'Jamaica' page 386\r\nwith a quotation from Williamson 'Oriental Field Sports.' Also Col.\r\nHamilton Smith in 'Naturalist Library' volume 9 page 94.) With respect to\r\ncolour, feral pigs generally revert to that of the wild boar; but in\r\ncertain parts of S. America, as we have seen, some of the semi-feral pigs\r\nhave a curious white band across their stomachs; and in certain other hot\r\nplaces the pigs are red, and this colour has likewise occasionally been\r\nobserved in the feral pigs of Jamaica. From these several facts we see that\r\nwith pigs when feral there is a strong tendency to revert to the wild type;\r\nbut that this tendency is largely governed by the nature of the climate,\r\namount of exercise, and other causes of change to which they have been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nThe last point worth notice is that we have unusually good evidence of\r\nbreeds of pigs now keeping perfectly true, which have been formed by the\r\ncrossing of several distinct breeds. The Improved Essex pigs, for instance,\r\nbreed very true; but there is no doubt that they largely owe their present\r\nexcellent qualities to crosses originally made by Lord Western with the\r\nNeapolitan race, and to subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed (this\r\nalso having been improved by Neapolitan crosses), and likewise, probably,\r\nwith the Sussex breed. (3/30. S. Sidney's edition of 'Youatt on the Pig'\r\n1860 pages 7, 26, 27, 29, 30.) In breeds thus formed by complex crosses,\r\nthe most careful and unremitting selection during many generations has been\r\nfound to be indispensable. Chiefly in consequence of so much crossing, some\r\nwell-known breeds have undergone rapid changes; thus, according to\r\nNathusius (3/31. 'Schweineschadel' s 140.), the Berkshire breed of 1780 is\r\nquite different from that of 1810; and, since this latter period, at least\r\ntwo distinct forms have borne the same name.\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\nDomestic cattle are certainly the descendants of more than one wild form,\r\nin the same manner as has been shown to be the case with our dogs and pigs.\r\nNaturalists have generally made two main divisions of cattle: the humped\r\nkinds inhabiting tropical countries, called in India Zebus, to which the\r\nspecific name of Bos indicus has been given; and the common non-humped\r\ncattle, generally included under the name of Bos taurus. The humped cattle\r\nwere domesticated, as may be seen on the Egyptian monuments, at least as\r\nearly as the twelfth dynasty, that is 2100 B.C. They differ from common\r\ncattle in various osteological characters, even in a greater degree,\r\naccording to Rutimeyer (3/32. 'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 109, 149,\r\n222. See also Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 'Mem. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 10\r\npage 172; and his son Isidore in 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 69. Vasey in\r\nhis 'Delineations of the Ox Tribe' 1851 page 127, says the zebu has four,\r\nand common ox five, sacral vertebrae. Mr. Hodgson found the ribs either\r\nthirteen or fourteen in number; see a note in 'Indian Field' 1858 page 62.)\r\nthan do the fossil and prehistoric European species, namely, Bos\r\nprimigenius and longifrons, from each other. They differ, also, as Mr.\r\nBlyth (3/33. 'The Indian Field' 1858 page 74 where Mr. Blyth gives his\r\nauthorities with respect to the feral humped cattle. Pickering also in his\r\n'Races of Man' 1850 page 274 notices the peculiar grunt-like character of\r\nthe voice of the humped cattle.), who has particularly attended to this\r\nsubject, remarks, in general configuration, in the shape of their ears, in\r\nthe point where the dewlap commences, in the typical curvature of their\r\nhorns, in their manner of carrying their heads when at rest, in their\r\nordinary variations of colour, especially in the frequent presence of\r\n\"nilgau-like markings on their feet,\" and \"in the one being born with teeth\r\nprotruding through the jaws, and the other not so.\" They have different\r\nhabits, and their voice is entirely different. The humped cattle in India\r\n\"seldom seek shade, and never go into the water and there stand knee-deep,\r\nlike the cattle of Europe.\" They have run wild in parts of Oude and\r\nRohilcund, and can maintain themselves in a region infested by tigers. They\r\nhave given rise to many races differing greatly in size, in the presence of\r\none or two humps, in length of horns, and other respects. Mr. Blyth sums up\r\nemphatically that the humped and humpless cattle must be considered as\r\ndistinct species. When we consider the number of points in external\r\nstructure and habits, independently of important osteological differences,\r\nin which they differ from each other; and that many of these points are not\r\nlikely to have been affected by domestication, there can hardly be a doubt,\r\nnotwithstanding the adverse opinion of some naturalists, that the humped\r\nand non-humped cattle must be ranked as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nThe European breeds of humpless cattle are numerous. Professor Low\r\nenumerates 19 British breeds, only a few of which are identical with those\r\non the Continent. Even the small Channel islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and\r\nAlderney possess their own sub-breeds (3/34. Mr. H.E. Marquand in 'The\r\nTimes' June 23, 1856.); and these again differ from the cattle of the other\r\nBritish islands, such as Anglesea, and the western isles of Scotland.\r\nDesmarest, who paid attention to the subject, describes 15 French races,\r\nexcluding sub-varieties and those imported from other countries. In other\r\nparts of Europe there are several distinct races, such as the pale-coloured\r\nHungarian cattle, with their light and free step, and enormous horns\r\nsometimes measuring above five feet from tip to tip (3/35. Vasey\r\n'Delineations of the Ox-Tribe' page 124. Brace 'Hungary' 1851 page 94. The\r\nHungarian cattle descend according to Rutimeyer 'Zahmen Europ. Rindes' 1866\r\ns. 13 from Bos primigenius.): the Podolian cattle also are remarkable from\r\nthe height of their fore-quarters. In the most recent work on Cattle (3/36.\r\nMoll and Gayot 'La Connaissance Gen. du Boeuf' Paris 1860. Fig. 82 is that\r\nof the Podolian breed.), engravings are given of fifty-five European\r\nbreeds; it is, however, probable that several of these differ very little\r\nfrom each other, or are merely synonyms. It must not be supposed that\r\nnumerous breeds of cattle exist only in long-civilised countries, for we\r\nshall presently see that several kinds are kept by the savages of Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[With respect to the parentage of the several European breeds, we already\r\nknow much from Nilsson's Memoir (3/37. A translation appeared in three\r\nparts in the 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 4 1849.),\r\nand more especially from Rutimeyer's works and those of Boyd Dawkins. Two\r\nor three species or forms of Bos, closely allied to still living domestic\r\nraces, have been found in the more recent tertiary deposits or amongst\r\nprehistoric remains in Europe. Following Rutimeyer, we have:-\r\n\r\nBos primigenius.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent, well known species was domesticated in Switzerland during\r\nthe Neolithic period; even at this early period it varied a little, having\r\napparently been crossed with other races. Some of the larger races on the\r\nContinent, as the Friesland, etc., and the Pembroke race in England,\r\nclosely resemble in essential structure B. primigenius, and no doubt are\r\nits descendants. This is likewise the opinion of Nilsson. Bos primigenius\r\nexisted as a wild animal in Caesar's time, and is now semi-wild, though\r\nmuch degenerated in size, in the park of Chillingham; for I am informed by\r\nProfessor Rutimeyer, to whom Lord Tankerville sent a skull, that the\r\nChillingham cattle are less altered from the true primigenius type than any\r\nother known breed. (3/38. See also Rutimeyer 'Beitrage pal. Gesch. der\r\nWiederkauer' Basel 1865 s. 54.)\r\n\r\nBos trochoceros.\r\n\r\nThis form is not included in the three species above mentioned, for it is\r\nnow considered by Rutimeyer to be the female of an early domesticated form\r\nof B. primigenius, and as the progenitor of his frontosus race. I may add\r\nthat specific names have been given to four other fossil oxen, now believed\r\nto be identical with B. primigenius. (3/39. Pictet 'Palaeontologie' tome 1\r\npage 365 2nd edition. With respect to B. trochoceros see Rutimeyer 'Zahmen\r\nEurop. Rindes' 1866 s. 26.)\r\n\r\nBos longifrons (or brachyceros) of Owen.\r\n\r\nThis very distinct species was of small size, and had a short body with\r\nfine legs. According to Boyd Dawkins (3/40. W. Boyd Dawkins on the British\r\nFossil Oxen 'Journal of the Geolog. Soc.' August 1867 page 182. Also 'Proc.\r\nPhil. Soc. of Manchester' November 14, 1871 and 'Cave Hunting' 1875 page\r\n27, 138.) it was introduced as a domesticated animal into Britain at a very\r\nearly period, and supplied food to the Roman legionaries. (3/41. 'British\r\nPleistocene Mammalia' by W.B. Dawkins and W.A. Sandford 1866 page 15.) Some\r\nremains have been found in Ireland in certain crannoges, of which the dates\r\nare believed to be from 843-933 A.D. (3/42. W.R. Wilde 'An Essay on the\r\nAnimal Remains, etc. Royal Irish Academy' 1860 page 29. Also 'Proc. of R.\r\nIrish Academy' 1858 page 48.) It was also the commonest form in a\r\ndomesticated condition in Switzerland during the earliest part of the\r\nNeolithic period. Professor Owen (3/43. 'Lecture: Royal Institution of G.\r\nBritain' May 2, 1856 page 4. 'British Fossil Mammals' page 513.) thinks it\r\nprobable that the Welsh and Highland cattle are descended from this form;\r\nas likewise is the case, according to Rutimeyer, with some of the existing\r\nSwiss breeds. These latter are of different shades of colour from light-\r\ngrey to blackish-brown, with a lighter stripe along the spine, but they\r\nhave no pure white marks. The cattle of North Wales and the Highlands, on\r\nthe other hand, are generally black or dark-coloured.\r\n\r\nBos frontosus of Nilsson.\r\n\r\nThis species is allied to B. longifrons, and, according to the high\r\nauthority of Mr. Boyd Dawkins, is identical with it, but in the opinion of\r\nsome judges is distinct. Both co-existed in Scania during the same late\r\ngeological period (3/44. Nilsson in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 1849\r\nvolume 4 page 354.), and both have been found in the Irish crannoges.\r\n(3/45. See W.R. Wilde ut supra; and Mr. Blyth in 'Proc. Irish Academy'\r\nMarch 5, 1864.) Nilsson believes that his B. frontosus may be the parent of\r\nthe mountain cattle of Norway, which have a high protuberance on the skull\r\nbetween the base of the horns. As Professor Owen and others believe that\r\nthe Scotch Highland cattle are descended from his B. longifrons, it is\r\nworth notice that a capable judge (3/46. Laing 'Tour in Norway' page 110.)\r\nhas remarked that he saw no cattle in Norway like the Highland breed, but\r\nthat they more nearly resembled the Devonshire breed.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may conclude, more especially from the researches of Boyd\r\nDawkins, that European cattle are descended from two species; and there is\r\nno improbability in this fact, for the genus Bos readily yields to\r\ndomestication. Besides these two species and the zebu, the yak, the gayal,\r\nand the arni (3/47. Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3,\r\n96.) (not to mention the buffalo or genus Bubalus) have been domesticated;\r\nmaking altogether six species of Bos. The zebu and the two European species\r\nare now extinct in a wild state. Although certain races of cattle were\r\ndomesticated at a very ancient period in Europe, it does not follow that\r\nthey were first domesticated here. Those who place much reliance on\r\nphilology argue that they were imported from the East. (3/48. Idem tome 3\r\npages 82, 91.) It is probable that they originally inhabited a temperate or\r\ncold climate, but not a land long covered with snow; for our cattle, as we\r\nhave seen in the chapter on Horses, have not the instinct of scraping away\r\nthe snow to get at the herbage beneath. No one could behold the magnificent\r\nwild bulls on the bleak Falkland Islands in the southern hemisphere, and\r\ndoubt about the climate being admirably suited to them. Azara has remarked\r\nthat in the temperate regions of La Plata the cows conceive when two years\r\nold, whilst in the much hotter country of Paraguay they do not conceive\r\ntill three years old; \"from which fact,\" as he adds, \"one may conclude that\r\ncattle do not succeed so well in warm countries.\" (3/49. 'Quadrupedes du\r\nParaguay' tome 2 page 360.)\r\n\r\nBos primigenius and longifrons have been ranked by nearly all\r\npalaeontologists as distinct species; and it would not be reasonable to\r\ntake a different view simply because their domesticated descendants now\r\nintercross with the utmost freedom. All the European breeds have so often\r\nbeen crossed both intentionally and unintentionally, that, if any sterility\r\nhad ensued from such unions, it would certainly have been detected. As\r\nzebus inhabit a distant and much hotter region, and as they differ in so\r\nmany characters from our European cattle, I have taken pains to ascertain\r\nwhether the two forms are fertile when crossed. The late Lord Powis\r\nimported some zebus and crossed them with common cattle in Shropshire; and\r\nI was assured by his steward that the cross-bred animals were perfectly\r\nfertile with both parent-stocks. Mr. Blyth informs me that in India\r\nhybrids, with various proportions of either blood, are quite fertile; and\r\nthis can hardly fail to be known, for in some districts (3/50. Walther 'Das\r\nRindvieh' 1817 s. 30.) the two species are allowed to breed freely\r\ntogether. Most of the cattle which were first introduced into Tasmania were\r\nhumped, so that at one time thousands of crossed animals existed there; and\r\nMr. B. O'Neile Wilson, M.A., writes to me from Tasmania that he has never\r\nheard of any sterility having been observed. He himself formerly possessed\r\na herd of such crossed cattle, and all were perfectly fertile; so much so,\r\nthat he cannot remember even a single cow failing to calve. These several\r\nfacts afford an important confirmation of the Pallasian doctrine that the\r\ndescendants of species which when first domesticated would if crossed have\r\nbeen in all probability in some degree sterile, become perfectly fertile\r\nafter a long course of domestication. In a future chapter we shall see that\r\nthis doctrine throws some light on the difficult subject of Hybridism.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the cattle in Chillingham Park, which, according to\r\nRutimeyer, have been very little changed from the Bos primigenius type.\r\nThis park is so ancient that it is referred to in a record of the year\r\n1220. The cattle in their instincts and habits are truly wild. They are\r\nwhite, with the inside of the ears reddish-brown, eyes rimmed with black,\r\nmuzzles brown, hoofs black, and horns white tipped with black. Within a\r\nperiod of thirty-three years about a dozen calves were born with \"brown and\r\nblue spots upon the cheeks or necks; but these, together with any defective\r\nanimals, were always destroyed.\" According to Bewick, about the year 1770\r\nsome calves appeared with black ears; but these were also destroyed by the\r\nkeeper, and black ears have not since reappeared. The wild white cattle in\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton's park, where I have heard of the birth of a black\r\ncalf, are said by Lord Tankerville to be inferior to those at Chillingham.\r\nThe cattle kept until the year 1780 by the Duke of Queensberry, but now\r\nextinct, had their ears, muzzle, and orbits of the eyes black. Those which\r\nhave existed from time immemorial at Chartley, closely resemble the cattle\r\nat Chillingham, but are larger, \"with some small difference in the colour\r\nof the ears.\" \"They frequently tend to become entirely black; and a\r\nsingular superstition prevails in the vicinity that, when a black calf is\r\nborn, some calamity impends over the noble house of Ferrers. All the black\r\ncalves are destroyed.\" The cattle at Burton Constable in Yorkshire, now\r\nextinct, had ears, muzzle, and the tip of the tail black. Those at\r\nGisburne, also in Yorkshire, are said by Bewick to have been sometimes\r\nwithout dark muzzles, with the inside alone of the ears brown; and they are\r\nelsewhere said to have been low in stature and hornless. (3/51. I am much\r\nindebted to the present Earl of Tankerville for information about his wild\r\ncattle; and for the skull which was sent to Prof. Rutimeyer. The fullest\r\naccount of the Chillingham cattle is given by Mr. Hindmarsh, together with\r\na letter by the late Lord Tankerville, in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.'\r\nvolume 2 1839 page 274. See Bewick 'Quadrupeds' 2nd edition 1791 page 35\r\nnote. With respect to those of the Duke of Queensberry see Pennant 'Tour in\r\nScotland' page 109. For those of Chartley, see Low 'Domesticated Animals of\r\nBritain' 1845 page 238. For those of Gisburne see Bewick 'Quadrupeds' and\r\n'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 101.)\r\n\r\nThe several above-specified differences in the park-cattle, slight though\r\nthey be, are worth recording, as they show that animals living nearly in a\r\nstate of nature, and exposed to nearly uniform conditions, if not allowed\r\nto roam freely and to cross with other herds, do not keep as uniform as\r\ntruly wild animals. For the preservation of a uniform character, even\r\nwithin the same park, a certain degree of selection--that is, the\r\ndestruction of the dark-coloured calves--is apparently necessary.\r\n\r\nBoyd Dawkins believes that the park-cattle are descended from anciently\r\ndomesticated, and not truly wild animals; and from the occasional\r\nappearance of dark-coloured calves, it is improbable that the aboriginal\r\nBos primigenius was white. It is curious what a strong, though not\r\ninvariable, tendency there is in wild or escaped cattle to become white\r\nwith coloured ears, under widely different conditions of life. If the old\r\nwriters Boethius and Leslie (3/52. Boethius was born in 1470; 'Annals and\r\nMag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 2 1839 page 281; and volume 4 1849 page 424.)\r\ncan be trusted, the wild cattle of Scotland were white and furnished with a\r\ngreat mane; but the colour of their ears is not mentioned. In Wales (3/53.\r\n'Youatt on Cattle' 1834 page 48: See also page 242, on shorthorn cattle.\r\nBell in his 'British Quadrupeds' page 423 states that, after long attending\r\nto the subject, he has found that white cattle invariably have coloured\r\nears.), during the tenth century, some of the cattle are described as being\r\nwhite with red ears. Four hundred cattle thus coloured were sent to King\r\nJohn; and an early record speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having\r\nbeen demanded as a compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were\r\nof a dark or black colour, 150 were to be presented. The black cattle of\r\nNorth Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small longifrons\r\ntype: and as the alternative was offered of either 150 dark cattle, or 100\r\nwhite cattle with red ears, we may presume that the latter were the larger\r\nbeasts, and probably belonged to the primigenius type. Youatt has remarked\r\nthat at the present day, whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white,\r\nthe extremities of their ears are more or less tinged with red.\r\n\r\nThe cattle which have run wild on the Pampas, in Texas, and in two parts of\r\nAfrica, have become of a nearly uniform dark brownish-red. (3/54. Azara\r\n'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 page 361. Azara quotes Buffon for the\r\nferal cattle of Africa. For Texas see 'Times' February 18, 1846.) On the\r\nLadrone Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, immense herds of cattle, which were\r\nwild in the year 1741, are described as \"milk-white, except their ears,\r\nwhich are generally black.\" (3/55. Anson's Voyage. See Kerr and Porter\r\n'Collection' volume 12 page 103.) The Falkland Islands, situated far south,\r\nwith all the conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive\r\nfrom those of the Ladrones, offer a more interesting case. Cattle have run\r\nwild there during eighty or ninety years; and in the southern districts the\r\nanimals are mostly white, with their feet, or whole heads, or only their\r\nears black; but my informant, Admiral Sulivan (3/56. See also Mr.\r\nMackinnon's pamphlet on the Falkland Islands, page 24.), who long resided\r\non these islands, does not believe that they are ever purely white. So that\r\nin these two archipelagos we see that the cattle tend to become white with\r\ncoloured ears. In other parts of the Falkland Islands other colours\r\nprevail: near Port Pleasant brown is the common tint; round Mount Usborn,\r\nabout half the animals in some of the herds were lead- or mouse-coloured,\r\nwhich elsewhere is an unusual tint. These latter cattle, though generally\r\ninhabiting high land, breed about a month earlier than the other cattle;\r\nand this circumstance would aid in keeping them distinct and in\r\nperpetuating a peculiar colour. It is worth recalling to mind that blue or\r\nlead-coloured marks have occasionally appeared on the white cattle of\r\nChillingham. So plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in\r\ndifferent parts of the Falkland Islands, that in hunting them, as Admiral\r\nSulivan informs me, white spots in one district, and dark spots in another\r\ndistrict, were always looked out for on the distant hills. In the\r\nintermediate districts, intermediate colours prevailed. Whatever the cause\r\nmay be, this tendency in the wild cattle of the Falkland Islands, which are\r\nall descended from a few brought from La Plata, to break up into herds of\r\nthree different colours, is an interesting fact.\r\n\r\nReturning to the several British breeds, the conspicuous difference in\r\ngeneral appearance between Shorthorns, Longhorns (now rarely seen),\r\nHerefords, Highland cattle, Alderneys, etc., must be familiar to every one.\r\nA part of this difference may be attributed to descent from primordially\r\ndistinct species; but we may feel sure that there has been a considerable\r\namount of variation. Even during the Neolithic period, the domestic cattle\r\nwere to a certain extent variable. Within recent times most of the breeds\r\nhave been modified by careful and methodical selection. How strongly the\r\ncharacters thus acquired are inherited, may be inferred from the prices\r\nrealised by the improved breeds; even at the first sale of Colling's\r\nShorthorns, eleven bulls reached an average of 214 pounds, and lately\r\nShorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand guineas, and have been\r\nexported to all quarters of the world.\r\n\r\nSome constitutional differences may be here noticed. The Shorthorns arrive\r\nat maturity far earlier than the wilder breeds, such as those of Wales or\r\nthe Highlands. This fact has been shown in an interesting manner by Mr.\r\nSimonds (3/57. 'The Age of the Ox, Sheep, Pig' etc. by Prof. James Simonds,\r\npublished by order of the Royal Agricult. Soc.) who has given a table of\r\nthe average period of their dentition, which proves that there is a\r\ndifference of no less than six months in the appearance of the permanent\r\nincisors. The period of gestation, from observations made by Tessier on\r\n1131 cows, varies to the extent of eighty-one days; and what is more\r\ninteresting, M. Lefour affirms \"that the period of gestation is longer in\r\nthe large German cattle than in the smaller breeds.\" (3/58. 'Ann. Agricult.\r\nFrance' April 1837 as quoted in 'The Veterinary' volume 12 page 725. I\r\nquote Tessier's observations from 'Youatt on Cattle' page 527.) With\r\nrespect to the period of conception, it seems certain that Alderney and\r\nZetland cows often become pregnant earlier than other breeds. (3/59. 'The\r\nVeterinary' volume 8 page 681 and volume 10 page 268. Low 'Domest. Animals,\r\netc.' page 297.) Lastly, as four fully developed mammae is a generic\r\ncharacter in the genus Bos (3/60. Mr. Ogleby in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1836\r\npage 138, and 1840 page 4. Quatrefages quotes Philippi 'Revue des Cours\r\nScientifiques' February 12, 1688 page 657, that the cattle of Piacentino\r\nhave thirteen dorsal vertebrae and ribs in the place of the ordinary number\r\nof twelve.), it is worth notice that with our domestic cows the two\r\nrudimentary mammae often become fairly well developed and yield milk.\r\n\r\nAs numerous breeds are generally found only in long-civilised countries, it\r\nmay be well to show that in some countries inhabited by barbarous races,\r\nwho are frequently at war with each other, and therefore have little free\r\ncommunication, several distinct breeds of cattle now exist or formerly\r\nexisted. At the Cape of Good Hope Leguat observed, in the year 1720, three\r\nkinds. (3/61. Leguat's Voyage quoted by Vasey in his 'Delineations of the\r\nOx-tribe' page 132.) At the present day various travellers have noticed the\r\ndifferences in the breeds in Southern Africa. Sir Andrew Smith several\r\nyears ago remarked to me that the cattle possessed by the different tribes\r\nof Caffres, though living near each other under the same latitude and in\r\nthe same kind of country, yet differed, and he expressed much surprise at\r\nthe fact. Mr. Andersson has described (3/62. 'Travels in South Africa'\r\npages 317, 336.) the Damara, Bechuana, and Namaqua cattle; and he informs\r\nme in a letter that the cattle north of Lake Ngami are likewise different,\r\nas Mr. Galton has heard is also the case with the cattle of Benguela. The\r\nNamaqua cattle in size and shape nearly resemble European cattle, and have\r\nshort stout horns and large hoofs. The Damara cattle are very peculiar,\r\nbeing big-boned, with slender legs, and small hard feet; their tails are\r\nadorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly touching the ground, and\r\ntheir horns are extraordinarily large. The Bechuana cattle have even larger\r\nhorns, and there is now a skull in London with the two horns 8 ft. 8 1/4\r\nin. long, as measured in a straight line from tip to tip, and no less than\r\n13 ft. 5 in. as measured along their curvature! Mr. Andersson in his letter\r\nto me says that, though he will not venture to describe the differences\r\nbetween the breeds belonging to the many different sub-tribes, yet such\r\ncertainly exist, as shown by the wonderful facility with which the natives\r\ndiscriminate them.\r\n\r\nThat many breeds of cattle have originated through variation, independently\r\nof descent from distinct species, we may infer from what we see in South\r\nAmerica, where the genus Bos was not endemic, and where the cattle which\r\nnow exist in such vast numbers are the descendants of a few imported from\r\nSpain and Portugal. In Columbia, Roulin (3/63. 'Mem. de 1'Institut present.\r\npar divers Savans' tome 6 1835 page 333. For Brazil see 'Comptes Rendus'\r\nJune 15, 1846. See Azara 'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 pages 359, 361.)\r\ndescribes two peculiar breeds, namely, pelones, with extremely thin and\r\nfine hair, and calongos, absolutely naked. According to Castelnau there are\r\ntwo races in Brazil, one like European cattle, the other different, with\r\nremarkable horns. In Paraguay, Azara describes a breed which certainly\r\noriginated in S. America, called chivos, \"because they have straight\r\nvertical horns, conical, and very large at the base.\" He likewise describes\r\na dwarf race in Corrientes, with short legs and a body larger than usual.\r\nCattle without horns, and others with reversed hair, have also originated\r\nin Paraguay.\r\n\r\nAnother monstrous breed, called niatas or natas, of which I saw two small\r\nherds on the northern bank of the Plata, is so remarkable as to deserve a\r\nfuller description. This breed bears the same relation to other breeds, as\r\nbull or pug dogs do to other dogs, or as improved pigs, according to H. von\r\nNathusius, do to common pigs. (3/64. 'Schweineschadel' 1864 s. 104.\r\nNathusius states that the form of skull characteristic in the niata cattle\r\noccasionally appears in European cattle; but he is mistaken, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, in supposing that these cattle do not form a distinct race.\r\nProf. Wyman, of Cambridge, United States, informs me that the common cod-\r\nfish presents a similar monstrosity, called by the fishermen \"bull-dog\r\ncod.\" Prof. Wyman also concluded, after making numerous inquiries in La\r\nPlata, that the niata cattle transmit their peculiarities or form a race.)\r\nRutimeyer believes that these cattle belong to the primigenius type. (3/65\r\n'Ueber Art des zahmen Europ. Rindes' 1866 s. 28.) The forehead is very\r\nshort and broad, with the nasal end of the skull, together with the whole\r\nplane of the upper molar-teeth, curved upwards. The lower jaw projects\r\nbeyond the upper, and has a corresponding upward curvature. It is an\r\ninteresting fact that an almost similar confirmation characterizes, as I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Falconer, the extinct and gigantic Sivatherium of India,\r\nand is not known in any other ruminant. The upper lip is much drawn back,\r\nthe nostrils are seated high up and are widely open, the eyes project\r\noutwards, and the horns are large. In walking the head is carried low, and\r\nthe neck is short. The hind legs appear to be longer, compared with the\r\nfront legs, than is usual. The exposed incisor teeth, the short head and\r\nupturned nostrils, give these cattle the most ludicrous, self-confident air\r\nof defiance. The skull which I presented to the College of Surgeons has\r\nbeen thus described by Professor Owen (3/66. 'Descriptive Cat. of Ost.\r\nCollect. of College of Surgeons' 1853 page 624. Vasey in his 'Delineations\r\nof the Ox-tribe' has given a figure of this skull; and I sent a photograph\r\nof it to Prof. Rutimeyer.) \"It is remarkable from the stunted development\r\nof the nasals, premaxillaries, and fore-part of the lower jaw, which is\r\nunusually curved upwards to come into contact with the premaxillaries. The\r\nnasal bones are about one-third the ordinary length, but retain almost\r\ntheir normal breadth. The triangular vacuity is left between them, the\r\nfrontal and lachrymal, which latter bone articulates with the premaxillary,\r\nand thus excludes the maxillary from any junction with the nasal.\" So that\r\neven the connexion of some of the bones is changed. Other differences might\r\nbe added: thus the plane of the condyles is somewhat modified, and the\r\nterminal edge of the premaxillaries forms an arch. In fact, on comparison\r\nwith the skull of a common ox, scarcely a single bone presents the same\r\nexact shape, and the whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance.\r\n\r\nThe first brief published notice of this race was by Azara, between the\r\nyears 1783-96; but Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, who has kindly collected\r\ninformation for me, states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as\r\ncuriosities near Buenos Ayres. Their origin is not positively known, but\r\nthey must have originated subsequently to the year 1552, when cattle were\r\nfirst introduced. Senor Muniz informs me that the breed is believed to have\r\noriginated with the Indians southward of the Plata. Even to this day those\r\nreared near the Plata show their less civilised nature in being fiercer\r\nthan common cattle, and in the cow, if visited too often, easily deserting\r\nher first calf. The breed is very true, and a niata bull and cow invariably\r\nproduce niata calves. The breed has already lasted at least a century. A\r\nniata bull crossed with a common cow, and the reverse cross, yield\r\noffspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata character\r\nstrongly displayed. According to Senor Muniz, there is the clearest\r\nevidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in analogous\r\ncases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her\r\npeculiarities more strongly than does the niata bull when crossed with a\r\ncommon cow. When the pasture is tolerably long, these cattle feed as well\r\nas common cattle with their tongue and palate; but during the great\r\ndroughts, when so many animals perish on the Pampas, the niata breed lies\r\nunder a great disadvantage, and would, if not attended to, become extinct;\r\nfor the common cattle, like horses, are able to keep alive by browsing with\r\ntheir lips on the twigs of trees and on reeds: this the niatas cannot so\r\nwell do, as their lips do not join, and hence they are found to perish\r\nbefore the common cattle. This strikes me as a good illustration of how\r\nlittle we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an animal, on what\r\ncircumstances, occurring only at long intervals of time, its rarity or\r\nextinction may depend. It shows us, also, how natural selection would have\r\ndetermined the rejection of the niata modification had it arisen in a state\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nHaving described the semi-monstrous niata breed, I may allude to a white\r\nbull, said to have been brought from Africa, which was exhibited in London\r\nin 1829, and which has been well figured by Mr. Harvey. (3/67. Loudon's\r\n'Magazine of Nat. Hist.' volume 1 1829 page 113. Separate figures are given\r\nof the animal, its hoofs, eye, and dewlap.) It had a hump, and was\r\nfurnished with a mane. The dewlap was peculiar, being divided between its\r\nfore-legs into parallel divisions. Its lateral hoofs were annually shed,\r\nand grew to the length of five or six inches. The eye was very peculiar,\r\nbeing remarkably prominent, and \"resembled a cup and ball, thus enabling\r\nthe animal to see on all sides with equal ease; the pupil was small and\r\noval, or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut off, and lying\r\ntransversely across the ball.\" A new and strange breed might probably have\r\nbeen formed by careful breeding and selection from this animal.\r\n\r\nI have often speculated on the probable causes through which each separate\r\ndistrict in Great Britain came to possess in former times its own peculiar\r\nbreed of cattle; and the question is, perhaps, even more perplexing in the\r\ncase of Southern Africa. We now know that the differences may be in part\r\nattributed to descent from distinct species; but this cause is far from\r\nsufficient. Have the slight differences in climate and in the nature of the\r\npasture, in the different districts of Britain, directly induced\r\ncorresponding differences in the cattle? We have seen that the semi-wild\r\ncattle in the several British parks are not identical in colouring or size,\r\nand that some degree of selection has been requisite to keep them true. It\r\nis almost certain that abundant food given during many generations directly\r\naffects the size of a breed. (3/68. Low 'Domesticated Animals of the\r\nBritish Isles' page 264.) That climate directly affects the thickness of\r\nthe skin and the hair is likewise certain: thus Roulin asserts (69 'Mem. de\r\nl'Institut present. Par divers Savans' tome 6 1835 page 332.) that the\r\nhides of the feral cattle on the hot Llanos \"are always much less heavy\r\nthan those of the cattle raised on the high platform of Bogota; and that\r\nthese hides yield in weight and in thickness of hair to those of the cattle\r\nwhich have run wild on the lofty Paramos.\" The same difference has been\r\nobserved in the hides of the cattle reared on the bleak Falkland Islands\r\nand on the temperate Pampas. Low has remarked (3/70. Idem pages 304, 368\r\netc.) that the cattle which inhabit the more humid parts of Britain have\r\nlonger hair and thicker skins than other British cattle. When we compare\r\nhighly improved stall-fed cattle with the wilder breeds, or compare\r\nmountain and lowland breeds, we cannot doubt that an active life, leading\r\nto the free use of the limbs and lungs, affects the shape and proportions\r\nof the whole body. It is probable that some breeds, such as the semi-\r\nmonstrous niata cattle, and some peculiarities, such as being hornless,\r\netc., have appeared suddenly owing to what we may call in our ignorance\r\nspontaneous variation; but even in this case a rude kind of selection is\r\nnecessary, and the animals thus characterised must be at least partially\r\nseparated from others. This degree of care, however, has sometimes been\r\ntaken even in little-civilised districts, where we should least have\r\nexpected it, as in the case of the niata, chivo, and hornless cattle in S.\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThat methodical selection has done wonders within a recent period in\r\nmodifying our cattle, no one doubts. During the process of methodical\r\nselection it has occasionally happened that deviations of structure, more\r\nstrongly pronounced than mere individual differences, yet by no means\r\ndeserving to be called monstrosities, have been taken advantage of: thus\r\nthe famous Longhorn Bull, Shakespeare, though of the pure Canley stock,\r\n\"scarcely inherited a single point of the long-horned breed, his horns\r\nexcepted (3/71. 'Youatt on Cattle' page 193. A full account of this bull is\r\ntaken from Marshall.); yet in the hands of Mr. Fowler, this bull greatly\r\nimproved his race. We have also reason to believe that selection, carried\r\non so far unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct\r\nintention to improve or change the breed, has in the course of time\r\nmodified most of our cattle; for by this process, aided by more abundant\r\nfood, all the lowland British breeds have increased greatly in size and in\r\nearly maturity since the reign of Henry VII. (3/72. 'Youatt on Cattle' page\r\n116. Lord Spencer has written on this same subject.) It should never be\r\nforgotten that many animals have to be annually slaughtered; so that each\r\nowner must determine which shall be killed and which preserved for\r\nbreeding. In every district, as Youatt has remarked, there is a prejudice\r\nin favour of the native breed; so that animals possessing qualities,\r\nwhatever they may be, which are most valued in each district, will be\r\noftenest preserved; and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the\r\nlong run affect the character of the whole breed. But it may be asked, can\r\nthis rude kind of selection have been practised by barbarians such as those\r\nof southern Africa? In a future chapter on Selection we shall see that this\r\nhas certainly occurred to some extent. Therefore, looking to the origin of\r\nthe many breeds of cattle which formerly inhabited the several districts of\r\nBritain, I conclude that, although slight differences in the nature of the\r\nclimate, food, etc., as well as changed habits of life, aided by\r\ncorrelation of growth, and the occasional appearance from unknown causes of\r\nconsiderable deviations of structure, have all probably played their parts;\r\nyet that the occasional preservation in each district of those individual\r\nanimals which were most valued by each owner has perhaps been even more\r\neffective in the production of the several British breeds. As soon as two\r\nor more breeds were formed in any district, or when new breeds descended\r\nfrom distinct species were introduced, their crossing, especially if aided\r\nby some selection, will have multiplied the number and modified the\r\ncharacters of the older breeds.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nI shall treat this subject briefly. Most authors look at our domestic sheep\r\nas descended from several distinct species. Mr. Blyth, who has carefully\r\nattended to the subject, believes that fourteen wild species now exist, but\r\n\"that not one of them can be identified as the progenitor of any one of the\r\ninterminable domestic races.\" M. Gervais thinks that there are six species\r\nof Ovis (3/73. Blyth on the genus Ovis in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. History'\r\nvolume 7 1841 page 261. With respect to the parentage of the breeds see Mr.\r\nBlyth's excellent articles in 'Land and Water' 1867 pages 134, 156. Gervais\r\n'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' 1855 tome 2 page 191.) but that our domestic\r\nsheep form a distinct genus, now completely extinct. A German naturalist\r\n(3/74. Dr. L. Fitzinger 'Ueber die Racen des Zahmen Schafes' 1860 s. 86.)\r\nbelieves that our sheep descend from ten aboriginally distinct species, of\r\nwhich only one is still living in a wild state! Another ingenious observer\r\n(3/75. J. Anderson 'Recreations in Agriculture and Natural History' volume\r\n2 page 264.), though not a naturalist, with a bold defiance of everything\r\nknown on geographical distribution, infers that the sheep of Great Britain\r\nalone are the descendants of eleven endemic British forms! Under such a\r\nhopeless state of doubt it would be useless for my purpose to give a\r\ndetailed account of the several breeds; but a few remarks may be added.\r\n\r\nSheep have been domesticated from a very ancient period. Rutimeyer (3/76.\r\n'Pfahlbauten' s. 127, 193.) found in the Swiss lake-dwellings the remains\r\nof a small breed, with thin tall legs, and horns like those of a goat, thus\r\ndiffering somewhat from any kind now known. Almost every country has its\r\nown peculiar breed; and many countries have several breeds differing\r\ngreatly from each other. One of the most strongly marked races is an\r\nEastern one with a long tail, including, according to Pallas, twenty\r\nvertebrae, and so loaded with fat that it is sometimes placed on a truck,\r\nwhich is dragged about by the living animal. These sheep, though ranked by\r\nFitzinger as a distinct aboriginal form, bear in their drooping ears the\r\nstamp of long domestication. This is likewise the case with those sheep\r\nwhich have two great masses of fat on the rump, with the tail in a\r\nrudimentary condition. The Angola variety of the long-tailed race has\r\ncurious masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the jaws. (3/77.\r\n'Youatt on Sheep' page 120.) Mr. Hodgson in an admirable paper (3/78.\r\n'Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal' volume 16 pages 1007, 1016.) on the\r\nsheep of the Himalaya infers from the distribution of the several races,\r\n\"that this caudal augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of\r\ndegeneracy in these pre-eminently Alpine animals.\" The horns present an\r\nendless diversity in character; being not rarely absent, especially in the\r\nfemale sex, or, on the other hand, amounting to four or even eight in\r\nnumber. The horns, when numerous, arise from a crest on the frontal bone,\r\nwhich is elevated in a peculiar manner. It is remarkable that multiplicity\r\nof horns \"is generally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the\r\nfleece.\" (3/79. 'Youatt on Sheep' pages 142-169.) This correlation,\r\nhowever, is far from being general; for instance, I am informed by Mr. D.\r\nForbes, that the Spanish sheep in Chile resemble, in fleece and in all\r\nother characters, their parent merino-race, except that instead of a pair\r\nthey generally bear four horns. The existence of a pair of mammae is a\r\ngeneric character in the genus Ovis as well as in several allied forms;\r\nnevertheless, as Mr. Hodgson has remarked, \"this character is not\r\nabsolutely constant even among the true and proper sheep: for I have more\r\nthan once met with Cagias (a sub-Himalayan domestic race) possessed of four\r\nteats.\" (3/80. 'Journal Asiat. Soc. of Bengal' volume 16 1847 page 1015.)\r\nThis case is the more remarkable as, when any part or organ is present in\r\nreduced number in comparison with the same part in allied groups, it\r\nusually is subject to little variation. The presence of interdigital pits\r\nhas likewise been considered as a generic distinction in sheep; but Isidore\r\nGeoffroy (3/81. 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 435.) has shown that these\r\npits or pouches are absent in some breeds.\r\n\r\nIn sheep there is a strong tendency for characters, which have apparently\r\nbeen acquired under domestication, to become attached either exclusively to\r\nthe male sex, or to be more highly developed in this than in the other sex.\r\nThus in many breeds the horns are deficient in the ewe, though this\r\nlikewise occurs occasionally with the female of the wild musmon. In the\r\nrams of the Wallachian breed, \"the horns spring almost perpendicularly from\r\nthe frontal bone, and then take a beautiful spiral form; in the ewes they\r\nprotrude nearly at right angles from the head, and then become twisted in a\r\nsingular manner.\" (3/82. 'Youatt on Sheep' page 138.) Mr. Hodgson states\r\nthat the extraordinarily arched nose or chaffron, which is so highly\r\ndeveloped in several foreign breeds, is characteristic of the ram alone,\r\nand apparently is the result of domestication. (3/83. 'Journal Asiat. Soc.\r\nof Bengal' volume 16 1847 pages 1015, 1016.) I hear from Mr. Blyth that the\r\naccumulation of fat in the fat-tailed sheep of the plains of India is\r\ngreater in the male than in the female; and Fitzinger (3/84. 'Racen des\r\nZahmen Schafes' s. 77.) remarks that the mane in the African maned race is\r\nfar more developed in the ram than in the ewe.\r\n\r\nDifferent races of sheep, like cattle, present constitutional differences.\r\nThus the improved breeds arrive at maturity at an early age, as has been\r\nwell shown by Mr. Simonds through their early average period of dentition.\r\nThe several races have become adapted to different kinds of pasture and\r\nclimate: for instance, no one can rear Leicester sheep on mountainous\r\nregions, where Cheviots flourish. As Youatt has remarked, \"In all the\r\ndifferent districts of Great Britain we find various breeds of sheep\r\nbeautifully adapted to the locality which they occupy. No one knows their\r\norigin; they are indigenous to the soil, climate, pasturage, and the\r\nlocality on which they graze; they seem to have been formed for it and by\r\nit.\" (3/85. 'Rural Economy of Norfolk' volume 2 page 136.) Marshall relates\r\n(3/86. 'Youatt on Sheep' page 312. On same subject, see excellent remarks\r\nin 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1858 page 868. For experiments in crossing\r\nCheviot sheep with Leicesters see Youatt page 325.) that a flock of heavy\r\nLincolnshire and light Norfolk sheep which had been bred together in a\r\nlarge sheep-walk, part of which was low, rich, and moist, and another part\r\nhigh and dry, with benty grass, when turned out, regularly separated from\r\neach other; the heavy sheep drawing off to the rich soil, and the lighter\r\nsheep to their own soil; so that \"whilst there was plenty of grass the two\r\nbreeds kept themselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons.\" Numerous sheep\r\nfrom various parts of the world have been brought during a long course of\r\nyears to the Zoological Gardens of London; but as Youatt, who attended the\r\nanimals as a veterinary surgeon, remarks, \"few or none die of the rot, but\r\nthey are phthisical; not one of them from a torrid climate lasts out the\r\nsecond year, and when they die their lungs are tuberculated.\" (3/87.\r\n'Youatt on Sheep' note page 491.) There is very good evidence that English\r\nbreeds of sheep will not succeed in France. (3/88. M. Malingie-Nouel\r\n'Journal R. Agricult. Soc.' volume 14 1853 page 214 translated and\r\ntherefore approved by a great authority, Mr. Pusey.) Even in certain parts\r\nof England it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of sheep;\r\nthus on a farm on the banks of the Ouse, the Leicester sheep were so\r\nrapidly destroyed by pleuritis (3/89. 'The Veterinary' volume 10 page 217.)\r\nthat the owner could not keep them; the coarser-skinned sheep never being\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation was formerly thought to be of so unalterable a\r\ncharacter, that a supposed difference of this kind between the wolf and the\r\ndog was esteemed a sure sign of specific distinction; but we have seen that\r\nthe period is shorter in the improved breeds of the pig, and in the larger\r\nbreeds of the ox, than in other breeds of these two animals. And now we\r\nknow, on the excellent authority of Hermann von Nathusius (3/90. A\r\ntranslation of his paper is given in 'Bull. Soc. Imp. d'Acclimat.' tome 9\r\n1862 page 723.), that Merino and Southdown sheep, when both have long been\r\nkept under exactly the same conditions, differ in their average period of\r\ngestation, as is seen in the following Table\r\n\r\nMerinos                             150.3 days.\r\nSouthdowns                          144.2   \"\r\nHalf-bred Merinos and Southdowns    146.3   \"\r\n3/4 blood of Southdown              145.5   \"\r\n7/8 blood of Southdown              144.2   \"\r\n\r\nIn this graduated difference in cross-bred animals having different\r\nproportions of Southdown blood, we see how strictly the two periods of\r\ngestation have been transmitted. Nathusius remarks that, as Southdowns grow\r\nwith remarkable rapidity after birth, it is not surprising that their\r\nfoetal development should have been shortened. It is of course possible\r\nthat the difference in these two breeds may be due to their descent from\r\ndistinct parent-species; but as the early maturity of the Southdowns has\r\nlong been carefully attended to by breeders, the difference is more\r\nprobably the result of such attention. Lastly, the fecundity of the several\r\nbreeds differs much; some generally producing twins or even triplets at a\r\nbirth, of which fact the curious Shangai sheep (with their truncated and\r\nrudimentary ears, and great Roman noses), lately exhibited in the\r\nZoological Gardens, offer a remarkable instance.\r\n\r\nSheep are perhaps more readily affected by the direct action of the\r\nconditions of life to which they have been exposed than almost any other\r\ndomestic animal. According to Pallas, and more recently according to Erman,\r\nthe fat-tailed Kirghisian sheep, when bred for a few generations in Russia,\r\ndegenerate, and the mass of fat dwindles away, \"the scanty and bitter\r\nherbage of the steppes seems so essential to their development.\" Pallas\r\nmakes an analogous statement with respect to one of the Crimean breeds.\r\nBurnes states that the Karakool breed, which produces a fine, curled,\r\nblack, and valuable fleece, when removed from its own canton near Bokhara\r\nto Persia or to other quarters, loses its peculiar fleece. (3/91. Erman\r\n'Travels in Siberia' English translation volume 1 page 228. For Pallas on\r\nthe fat-tailed sheep I quote from Anderson's account of the 'Sheep of\r\nRussia' 1794 page 34. With respect to the Crimean sheep see Pallas\r\n'Travels' English translation volume 2 page 454. For the Karakool sheep see\r\nBurnes 'Travels in Bokhara' volume 3 page 151.) In all such cases, however,\r\nit may be that a change of any kind in the conditions of life causes\r\nvariability and consequent loss of character, and not that certain\r\nconditions are necessary for the development of certain characters.\r\n\r\nGreat heat, however, seems to act directly on the fleece: several accounts\r\nhave been published of the change which sheep imported from Europe undergo\r\nin the West Indies. Dr. Nicholson of Antigua informs me that, after the\r\nthird generation, the wool disappears from the whole body, except over the\r\nloins; and the animal then appears like a goat with a dirty door-mat on its\r\nback. A similar change is said to take place on the west coast of Africa.\r\n(3/92. See Report of the Directors of the Sierra Leone Company as quoted in\r\nWhite 'Gradation of Man' page 95. With respect to the change which sheep\r\nundergo in the West Indies see also Dr. Davy in 'Edin. New. Phil. Journal'\r\nJanuary 1852. For the statement made by Roulin see 'Mem. de l'Institut\r\npresent. par divers Savans.' tome 6 1835 page 347.) On the other hand, many\r\nwool-bearing sheep live on the hot plains of India. Roulin asserts that in\r\nthe lower and heated valleys of the Cordillera, if the lambs are sheared as\r\nsoon as the wool has grown to a certain thickness, all goes on afterwards\r\nas usual; but if not sheared, the wool detaches itself in flakes, and short\r\nshining hair like that on a goat is produced ever afterwards. This curious\r\nresult seems merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the Merino\r\nbreed, for as a great authority, namely, Lord Somerville, remarks, \"the\r\nwool of our Merino sheep after shear-time is hard and coarse to such a\r\ndegree as to render it almost impossible to suppose that the same animal\r\ncould bear wool so opposite in quality, compared to that which has been\r\nclipped from it: as the cold weather advances, the fleeces recover their\r\nsoft quality.\" As in sheep of all breeds the fleece naturally consists of\r\nlonger and coarser hair covering shorter and softer wool, the change which\r\nit often undergoes in hot climates is probably merely a case of unequal\r\ndevelopment; for even with those sheep which like goats are covered with\r\nhair, a small quantity of underlying wool may always be found. (3/93.\r\n'Youatt on Sheep' page 69 where Lord Somerville is quoted. See page 117 on\r\nthe presence of wool under the hair. With respect to the fleeces of\r\nAustralian sheep page 185. On selection counteracting any tendency to\r\nchange see pages 70, 117, 120, 168.) In the wild mountain-sheep (0vis\r\nmontana) of North America there is an analogous annual change of coat; \"the\r\nwool begins to drop out in early spring, leaving in its place a coat of\r\nhair resembling that of the elk, a change of pelage quite different in\r\ncharacter from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair, common to all\r\nfurred animals in winter,--for instance, in the horse, the cow, etc., which\r\nshed their winter coat in the spring.\" (3/94. Audubon and Bachman 'The\r\nQuadrupeds of North America' 1846 volume 5 page 365.)\r\n\r\nA slight difference in climate or pasture sometimes slightly affects the\r\nfleece, as has been observed even in different districts in England, and is\r\nwell shown by the great softness of the wool brought from Southern\r\nAustralia. But it should be observed, as Youatt repeatedly insists, that\r\nthe tendency to change may generally be counteracted by careful selection.\r\nM. Lasterye, after discussing this subject, sums up as follows: \"The\r\npreservation of the Merino race in its utmost purity at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, in the marshes of Holland, and under the rigorous climate of Sweden,\r\nfurnishes an additional support of this my unalterable principle, that\r\nfine-woolled sheep may be kept wherever industrious men and intelligent\r\nbreeders exist.\"\r\n\r\nThat methodical selection has effected great changes in several breeds of\r\nsheep no one who knows anything on the subject, entertains a doubt. The\r\ncase of the Southdowns, as improved by Ellman, offers perhaps the most\r\nstriking instance. Unconscious or occasional selection has likewise slowly\r\nproduced a great effect, as we shall see in the chapters on Selection. That\r\ncrossing has largely modified some breeds, no one who will study what has\r\nbeen written on this subject--for instance, Mr. Spooner's paper--will\r\ndispute; but to produce uniformity in a crossed breed, careful selection\r\nand \"rigorous weeding,\" as this author expresses it, are indispensable.\r\n(3/95. 'Journal of R. Agricult. Soc. of England' volume 20 part 2, W.C.\r\nSpooner on cross-Breeding.)\r\n\r\nIn some few instances new breeds have suddenly originated; thus, in 1791, a\r\nram-lamb was born in Massachusetts, having short crooked legs and a long\r\nback, like a turnspit-dog. From this one lamb the otter or ancon semi-\r\nmonstrous breed was raised; as these sheep could not leap over the fences,\r\nit was thought that they would be valuable; but they have been supplanted\r\nby merinos, and thus exterminated. The sheep are remarkable from\r\ntransmitting their character so truly that Colonel Humphreys (3/96.\r\n'Philosoph. Transactions' London 1813 page 88.) never heard of \"but one\r\nquestionable case\" of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon offspring.\r\nWhen they are crossed with other breeds the offspring, with rare\r\nexceptions, instead of being intermediate in character, perfectly resemble\r\neither parent; even one of twins has resembled one parent and the second\r\nthe other. Lastly, \"the ancons have been observed to keep together,\r\nseparating themselves from the rest of the flock when put into enclosures\r\nwith other sheep.\"\r\n\r\nA more interesting case has been recorded in the Report of the Juries for\r\nthe Great Exhibition (1851), namely, the production of a merino ram-lamb on\r\nthe Mauchamp farm, in 1828, which was remarkable for its long, smooth,\r\nstraight, and silky wool. By the year 1833 M. Graux had raised rams enough\r\nto serve his whole flock, and after a few more years he was able to sell\r\nstock of his new breed. So peculiar and valuable is the wool, that it sells\r\nat 25 per cent above the best merino wool: even the fleeces of half-bred\r\nanimals are valuable, and are known in France as the \"Mauchamp-merino.\" It\r\nis interesting, as showing how generally any marked deviation of structure\r\nis accompanied by other deviations, that the first ram and his immediate\r\noffspring were of small size, with large heads, long necks, narrow chests,\r\nand long flanks; but these blemishes were removed by judicious crosses and\r\nselection. The long smooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns; and\r\nas horns and hair are homologous structures, we can understand the meaning\r\nof this correlation. If the Mauchamp and ancon breeds had originated a\r\ncentury or two ago, we should have had no record of their birth; and many a\r\nnaturalist would no doubt have insisted, especially in the case of the\r\nMauchamp race, that they had each descended from, or been crossed with,\r\nsome unknown aboriginal form.\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\n\r\nFrom the recent researches of M. Brandt, most naturalists now believe that\r\nall our goats are descended from the Capra aegagrus of the mountains of\r\nAsia, possibly mingled with the allied Indian species C. falconeri of\r\nIndia. (3/97. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Generale' tome 3\r\npage 87. Mr. Blyth 'Land and Water' 1867 page 37 has arrived at a similar\r\nconclusion, but he thinks that certain Eastern races may perhaps be in part\r\ndescended from the Asiatic markhor.) In Switzerland, during the neolithic\r\nperiod, the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep; and this very\r\nancient race differed in no respect from that now common in Switzerland.\r\n(3/98. Rutimeyer 'Pfahlbauten' s. 127.) At the present time, the many races\r\nfound in several parts of the world differ greatly from each other;\r\nnevertheless, as far as they have been tried (3/99. Godron 'De l'Espece'\r\ntome 1 page 402.) they are all quite fertile when crossed. So numerous are\r\nthe breeds, that Mr. G. Clark (3/100. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat History' 2nd\r\nseries volume 2 1848 page 363.) has described eight distinct kinds imported\r\ninto the one island of Mauritius. The ears of one kind were enormously\r\ndeveloped, being, as measured by Mr. Clark, no less than 19 inches in\r\nlength and 4 3/4 inches in breadth. As with cattle, the mammae of those\r\nbreeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed; and, as Mr.\r\nClark remarks, \"it is not rare to see their teats touching the ground.\" The\r\nfollowing cases are worth notice as presenting unusual points of variation.\r\nAccording to Godron (3/101. 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 406. Mr. Clark also\r\nrefers to differences in the shape of the mammae. Godron states that in the\r\nNubian race the scrotum is divided into two lobes; and Mr. Clark gives a\r\nludicrous proof of this fact, for he saw in the Mauritius a male goat of\r\nthe Muscat breed purchased at a high price for a female in full milk. These\r\ndifferences in the scrotum are probably not due to descent from distinct\r\nspecies: for Mr. Clark states that this part varies much in form.), the\r\nmammae differ greatly in shape in different breeds, being elongated in the\r\ncommon goat, hemispherical in the Angora race, and bilobed and divergent in\r\nthe goats of Syria and Nubia. According to this same author, the males of\r\ncertain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour. In one of the Indian\r\nbreeds the males and females have horns of widely-different shapes (3/102.\r\nMr. Clark 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page\r\n361.); and in some breeds the females are destitute of horns. (3/103.\r\nDesmarest 'Encyclop. Method. Mammalogie' page 480.) M. Ramu of Nancy\r\ninforms me that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the\r\nthroat a pair of hairy appendages, 70 mm. in length and about 10 mm. in\r\ndiameter, which in external appearance resemble those above described on\r\nthe jaws of pigs. The presence of inter-digital pits or glands on all four\r\nfeet has been thought to characterise the genus Ovis, and their absence to\r\nbe characteristic of the genus Capra; but Mr. Hodgson has found that they\r\nexist in the front feet of the majority of Himalayan goats. (3/104.\r\n'Journal of Asiatic Soc. of Bengal' volume 16 1847 pages 1020, 1025.) Mr.\r\nHodgson measured the intestines in two goats of the Dugu race, and he found\r\nthat the proportional length of the great and small intestines differed\r\nconsiderably. In one of these goats the caecum was thirteen inches, and in\r\nthe other no less than thirty-six inches in length!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC RABBITS.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC RABBITS DESCENDED FROM THE COMMON WILD RABBIT.\r\nANCIENT DOMESTICATION.\r\nANCIENT SELECTION.\r\nLARGE LOP-EARED RABBITS.\r\nVARIOUS BREEDS.\r\nFLUCTUATING CHARACTERS.\r\nORIGIN OF THE HIMALAYAN BREED.\r\nCURIOUS CASE OF INHERITANCE.\r\nFERAL RABBITS IN JAMAICA AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.\r\nPORTO SANTO FERAL RABBITS.\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS.\r\nSKULL.\r\nSKULL OF HALF-LOP RABBITS.\r\nVARIATIONS IN THE SKULL ANALOGOUS TO DIFFERENCES IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF\r\nHARES.\r\nVERTEBRAE.\r\nSTERNUM.\r\nSCAPULA.\r\nEFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LIMBS AND BODY.\r\nCAPACITY OF THE SKULL AND REDUCED SIZE OF THE BRAIN.\r\nSUMMARY ON THE MODIFICATIONS OF DOMESTICATED RABBITS.\r\n\r\nAll naturalists, with, as far as I know, a single exception, believe that\r\nthe several domestic breeds of the rabbit are descended from the common\r\nwild species; I shall therefore describe them more carefully than in the\r\nprevious cases. Professor Gervais (4/1. M.P. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. des\r\nMammiferes' 1854. tome 1 page 288.) states \"that the true wild rabbit is\r\nsmaller than the domestic; its proportions are not absolutely the same; its\r\ntail is smaller; its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair;\r\nand these characters, without speaking of colour, are so many indications\r\nopposed to the opinion which unites these animals under the same specific\r\ndenomination.\" Few naturalists will agree with this author that such slight\r\ndifferences are sufficient to separate as distinct species the wild and\r\ndomestic rabbit. How extraordinary it would be, if close confinement,\r\nperfect tameness, unnatural food, and careful breeding, all prolonged\r\nduring many generations, had not produced at least some effect! The tame\r\nrabbit has been domesticated from an ancient period. Confucius ranges\r\nrabbits among animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods, and, as he\r\nprescribes their multiplication, they were probably at this early period\r\ndomesticated in China. They are mentioned by several of the classical\r\nwriters. In 1631 Gervaise Markham writes, \"You shall not, as in other\r\ncattell, looke to their shape, but to their richnesse, onely elect your\r\nbuckes, the largest and goodliest conies you can get; and for the richnesse\r\nof the skin, that is accounted the richest which hath the equallest mixture\r\nof blacke and white haire together, yet the blacke rather shadowing the\r\nwhite; the furre should be thicke, deepe, smooth, and shining;...they are\r\nof body much fatter and larger, and, when another skin is worth two or\r\nthree pence, they are worth two shillings.\" From this full description we\r\nsee that silver-grey rabbits existed in England at this period; and what is\r\nfar more important, we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was\r\nthen carefully attended to. Aldrovandi, in 1637, describes, on the\r\nauthority of several old writers (as Scaliger, in 1557), rabbits of various\r\ncolours, some \"like a hare,\" and he adds that P. Valerianus (who died a\r\nvery old man in 1558) saw at Verona rabbits four times bigger than ours.\r\n(4/2. U. Aldrovandi 'De Quadrupedibus digitatis' 1637 page 383. For\r\nConfucius and G. Markham see a writer who has studied the subject in\r\n'Cottage Gardener' January 22, 1861 page 250.)\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient period,\r\nwe must look to the northern hemisphere of the Old World, and to the warmer\r\ntemperate regions alone, for the aboriginal parent-form; for the rabbit\r\ncannot live without protection in countries as cold as Sweden, and, though\r\nit has run wild in the tropical island of Jamaica, it has never greatly\r\nmultiplied there. It now exists, and has long existed, in the warmer\r\ntemperate parts of Europe, for fossil remains have been found in several\r\ncountries. (4/3. Owen 'British Fossil Mammals' page 212.) The domestic\r\nrabbit readily becomes feral in these same countries, and when variously\r\ncoloured kinds are turned out they generally revert to the ordinary grey\r\ncolour. (4/4. Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' 1801 b. 1 page 1133. I\r\nhave received similar accounts with respect to England and Scotland.) Wild\r\nrabbits, if taken young, can be domesticated, though the process is\r\ngenerally very troublesome. (4/5. 'Pigeons and Rabbits' by E.S. Delamer\r\n1854 page 133. Sir J. Sebright 'Observations on Instinct' 1836 page 10)\r\nspeaks most strongly on the difficulty. But this difficulty is not\r\ninvariable, as I have received two accounts of perfect success in taming\r\nand breeding from the wild rabbit. See also Dr. P. Broca in 'Journal de la\r\nPhysiologie' tome 2 page 368.) The various domestic races are often\r\ncrossed, and are believed to be quite fertile together, and a perfect\r\ngradation can be shown to exist from the largest domestic kinds, having\r\nenormously developed ears, to the common wild kind. The parent-form must\r\nhave been a burrowing animal, a habit not common, as far as I can discover,\r\nto any other species in the large genus Lepus. Only one wild species is\r\nknown with certainty to exist in Europe; but the rabbit (if it be a true\r\nrabbit) from Mount Sinai, and likewise that from Algeria, present slight\r\ndifferences; and these forms have been considered by some authors as\r\nspecifically distinct. (4/6. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' tome 1\r\npage 292.) But such slight differences would aid us little in explaining\r\nthe more considerable differences characteristic of the several domestic\r\nraces. If the latter are the descendants of two or more closely allied\r\nspecies, these, with the exception of the common rabbit, have been\r\nexterminated in a wild state; and this is very improbable, seeing with what\r\npertinacity this animal holds its ground. From these several reasons we may\r\ninfer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants of the\r\ncommon wild species. But from what we hear of the marvellous success in\r\nFrance in rearing hybrids between the hare and rabbit (4/7. See Dr. P.\r\nBroca's interesting memoir on this subject in Brown-Sequard 'Journ. de.\r\nPhys.' volume 2 page 367.), it is possible, though not probable, from the\r\ngreat difficulty in making the first cross, that some of the larger races,\r\nwhich are coloured like the hare, may have been modified by crosses with\r\nthis animal. Nevertheless, the chief differences in the skeletons of the\r\nseveral domestic breeds cannot, as we shall presently see, have been\r\nderived from a cross with the hare.\r\n\r\nThere are many breeds which transmit their characters more or less truly.\r\nEvery one has seen the enormous lop-eared rabbits exhibited at our shows;\r\nvarious allied sub-breeds are reared on the Continent, such as the so-\r\ncalled Andalusian, which is said to have a large head with a round\r\nforehead, and to attain a greater size than any other kind; another large\r\nParis breed is named the Rouennais, and has a square head; the so-called\r\nPatagonian rabbit has remarkably short ears and a large round head.\r\nAlthough I have not seen all these breeds, I feel some doubt about there\r\nbeing any marked difference in the shape of their skulls. (4/8. The skulls\r\nof these breeds are briefly described in the 'Journal of Horticulture' May\r\n7, 1861 page 108.) English lop-eared rabbits often weigh 8 pounds or 10\r\npounds, and one has been exhibited weighing 18 pounds; whereas a full-sized\r\nwild rabbit weighs only about 3 1/4 pounds. The head or skull in all the\r\nlarge lop-eared rabbits examined by me is much longer relatively to its\r\nbreadth than in the wild rabbit. Many of them have loose transverse folds\r\nof skin or dewlaps beneath the throat, which can be pulled out so as to\r\nreach nearly to the ends of the jaws. Their ears are prodigiously\r\ndeveloped, and hang down on each side of their faces. A rabbit was\r\nexhibited in 1867 with its two ears, measured from the tip of one to the\r\ntip of the other, 22 inches in length, and each ear 5 3/8 inches in\r\nbreadth. In 1869 one was exhibited with ears, measured in the same manner,\r\n23 1/8 in length and 5 1/2 in breadth; \"thus exceeding any rabbit ever\r\nexhibited at a prize show.\" In a common wild rabbit I found that the length\r\nof two ears, from tip to tip, was 7 5/8 inches, and the breadth only 1 7/8\r\ninch. The weight of body in the larger rabbits, and the development of\r\ntheir ears, are the qualities which win prizes, and have been carefully\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nThe hare-coloured, or, as it is sometimes called, the Belgian rabbit,\r\ndiffers in nothing except colour from the other large breeds; but Mr. J.\r\nYoung, of Southampton, a great breeder of this kind, informs me that the\r\nfemales, in all the specimens examined by him, had only six mammae; and\r\nthis certainly was the case with two females which came into my possession.\r\nMr. B.P. Brent, however, assures me that the number is variable with other\r\ndomestic rabbits. The common wild rabbit always has ten mammae. The Angora\r\nrabbit is remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur, which even on\r\nthe soles of the feet is of considerable length. This breed is the only one\r\nwhich differs in its mental qualities, for it is said to be much more\r\nsociable than other rabbits, and the male shows no wish to destroy its\r\nyoung. (4/9. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 380.) Two live rabbits\r\nwere brought to me from Moscow, of about the size of the wild species, but\r\nwith long soft fur, different from that of the Angora. These Moscow rabbits\r\nhad pink eyes and were snow-white, excepting the ears, two spots near the\r\nnose, the upper and under surface of the tail, and the hinder tarsi, which\r\nwere blackish-brown. In short, they were coloured nearly like the so-called\r\nHimalayan rabbits, presently to be described, and differed from them only\r\nin the character of their fur. There are two other breeds which come true\r\nto colour, but differ in no other respect, namely silver-greys and\r\nchinchillas. Lastly, the Nicard or Dutch rabbit may be mentioned, which\r\nvaries in colour, and is remarkable from its small size, some specimens\r\nweighing only 1 1/4 pounds; rabbits of this breed make excellent nurses for\r\nother and more delicate kinds. (4/10. 'Journal of Horticulture' May 28,\r\n1861 page 169.)\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 5. HALF-LOP RABBIT. (Copied from E.S. Delamer's work.)\r\n\r\nCertain characters are remarkably fluctuating, or are very feebly\r\ntransmitted by domestic rabbits: thus, one breeder tells me that with the\r\nsmaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of the same colour:\r\nwith the large lop-eared breeds \"it is impossible,\" says a great judge\r\n(4/11. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 327. With respect to the ears\r\nsee Delamer on 'Pigeons and Rabbits' 1854 page 141; also 'Poultry\r\nChronicle' volume 2 page 499 and ditto for 1854 page 586.), \"to breed true\r\nto colour, but by judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it.\r\nThe fancier should know how his does are bred, that is, the colour of their\r\nparents.\" Nevertheless, certain colours, as we shall presently see, are\r\ntransmitted truly. The dewlap is not strictly inherited. Lop-eared rabbits,\r\nwith their ears hanging down flat on each side of the face, do not transmit\r\nthis character at all truly. Mr. Delamer remarks that, \"with fancy rabbits,\r\nwhen both the parents are perfectly formed, have model ears, and are\r\nhandsomely marked, their progeny do not invariably turn out the same.\" When\r\none parent, or even both, are oar-laps, that is, have their ears sticking\r\nout at right angles, or when one parent or both are half-lops, that is,\r\nhave only one ear dependent, there is nearly as good a chance of the\r\nprogeny having both ears full-lop, as if both parents had been thus\r\ncharacterised. But I am informed, if both parents have upright ears, there\r\nis hardly a chance of a full-lop. In some half-lops the ear that hangs down\r\nis broader and longer than the upright ear (4/12. Delamer 'Pigeons and\r\nRabbits' page 136. See also 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 375.); so\r\nthat we have the unusual case of a want of symmetry on the two sides. This\r\ndifference in the position and size of the two ears probably indicates that\r\nthe lopping results from the great length and weight of the ear, favoured\r\nno doubt by the weakness of the muscles consequent on disuse. Anderson\r\n(4/13. 'An Account of the different Kinds of Sheep in the Russian\r\nDominions' 1794 page 39.) mentions a breed having only a single ear; and\r\nProfessor Gervais another breed destitute of ears.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the Himalayan breed, which is sometimes called Chinese,\r\nPolish, or Russian. These pretty rabbits are white, or occasionally yellow,\r\nexcepting their ears, nose, feet, and the upper side of the tail, which are\r\nall brownish-black; but as they have red eyes, they may be considered as\r\nalbinoes. I have received several accounts of their breeding perfectly\r\ntrue. From their symmetrical marks, they were at first ranked as\r\nspecifically distinct, and were provisionally named L. nigripes. (4/14.\r\n'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' June 23, 1857 page 159.) Some good observers thought\r\nthat they could detect a difference in their habits, and stoutly maintained\r\nthat they formed a new species. The origin of this breed is so curious,\r\nboth in itself and as throwing some light on the complex laws of\r\ninheritance that it is worth giving in detail. But it is first necessary\r\nbriefly to describe two other breeds: silver-greys or silver-sprigs\r\ngenerally have black heads and legs, and their fine grey fur is\r\ninterspersed with numerous black and white long hairs. They breed perfectly\r\ntrue, and have long been kept in warrens. When they escape and cross with\r\ncommon rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of Wretham\r\nHall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half take after the\r\none parent, and the other half after the other parent. Secondly,\r\nchinchillas or tame silver-greys (I will use the former name) have short,\r\npaler, mouse or slate-coloured fur, interspersed with long, blackish,\r\nslate-coloured, and white hairs. (4/15. 'Journal of Horticulture' April 9,\r\n1861 page 35.) These rabbits breed perfectly true. A writer stated in 1857\r\n(4/16. 'Cottage Gardener' 1857 page 141.) that he had produced Himalayan\r\nrabbits in the following manner. He had a breed of chinchillas which had\r\nbeen crossed with the common black rabbit, and their offspring were either\r\nblacks or chinchillas. These latter were again crossed with other\r\nchinchillas (which had also been crossed with silver-greys), and from this\r\ncomplicated cross Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and other\r\nsimilar statements, Mr. Bartlett (4/17. Mr. Bartlett in 'Proc. Zoolog Soc.'\r\n1861 page 40.) was led to make a careful trial in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nand he found that by simply crossing silver-greys with chinchillas he could\r\nalways produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding their\r\nsudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true. But I have recently\r\nbeen assured the pure silver-greys of any sub-breed occasionally produce\r\nHimalayans.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayans, when first born, are quite white, and are then true\r\nalbinoes; but in the course of a few months they gradually assume their\r\ndark ears, nose, feet, and tail. Occasionally, however, as I am informed by\r\nMr. W.A. Wooler and the Rev. W.D. Fox, the young are born of a very pale\r\ngrey colour, and specimens of such fur were sent me by the former\r\ngentleman. The grey tint, however, disappears as the animal comes to\r\nmaturity. So that with these Himalayans there is a tendency, strictly\r\nconfined to early youth, to revert to the colour of the adult silver-grey\r\nparent-stock. Silver-greys and chinchillas, on the other hand, present a\r\nremarkable contrast with the Himalayans in their colour whilst quite young,\r\nfor they are born perfectly black, but soon assume their characteristic\r\ngrey or silver tints. The same thing occurs with grey horses, which, as\r\nlong as they are foals, are generally of a nearly black colour, but soon\r\nbecome grey, and get whiter and whiter as they grow older. Hence the usual\r\nrule is that Himalayans are born white and afterwards become in certain\r\nparts of their bodies dark-coloured; whilst silver-greys are born black and\r\nafterwards become sprinkled with white. Exceptions, however, and of a\r\ndirectly opposite nature, occasionally occur in both cases. For young\r\nsilver-greys are sometimes born in warrens, as I hear from Mr. W. Birch, of\r\na cream-colour, but these young animals ultimately become black. The\r\nHimalayans, on the other hand, sometimes produce, as is stated by an\r\nexperienced amateur (4/18. 'Phenomenon in Himalayan Rabbits' in 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' January 27, 1865 page 102.), a single black young one in a\r\nlitter; and this, before two months elapse, becomes perfectly white.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole curious case: wild silver-greys may be considered as\r\nblack rabbits which become grey at an early period of life. When they are\r\ncrossed with common rabbits, the offspring are said not to have blended\r\ncolours, but to take after either parent; and in this respect they resemble\r\nblack and albino varieties of most quadrupeds, which often transmit their\r\ncolours in this same manner. When they are crossed with chinchillas, that\r\nis, with a paler sub-variety, the young are at first pure albinoes, but\r\nsoon become dark-coloured in certain parts of their bodies, and are then\r\ncalled Himalayans. The young Himalayans, however, are sometimes at first\r\neither pale grey or completely black, in either case changing after a time\r\nto white. In a future chapter I shall advance a large body of facts showing\r\nthat, when two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from\r\ntheir parent-stock, there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to\r\nthe aboriginal colour; and what is very remarkable, this reversion\r\noccasionally supervenes, not before birth, but during the growth of the\r\nanimal. Hence, if it could be shown that silver-greys and chinchillas were\r\nthe offspring of a cross between a black and albino variety with the\r\ncolours intimately blended--a supposition in itself not improbable, and\r\nsupported by the circumstance of silver-greys in warrens sometimes\r\nproducing creamy-white young, which ultimately become black--then all the\r\nabove given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in silver-greys and\r\nin their descendants the Himalayans would come under the law of reversion,\r\nsupervening at different periods of growth and in different degrees, either\r\nto the original black or to the original albino parent-variety.\r\n\r\nIt is, also, remarkable that Himalayans, though produced so suddenly; breed\r\ntrue. But as, whilst young, they are albinoes, the case falls under a very\r\ngeneral rule; albinism being well known to be strongly inherited, for\r\ninstance with white mice and many other quadrupeds, and even white flowers.\r\nBut why, it may be asked, do the ears, tail, nose, and feet, and no other\r\npart of the body, revert to a black colour? This apparently depends on a\r\nlaw, which generally holds good, namely, that characters common to many\r\nspecies of a genus--and this, in fact, implies long inheritance from the\r\nancient progenitor of the genus--are found to resist variation, or to\r\nreappear if lost, more persistently than the characters which are confined\r\nto the separate species. Now, in the genus Lepus, a large majority of the\r\nspecies have their ears and the upper surface of the tail tinted black; but\r\nthe persistence of these marks is best seen in those species which in\r\nwinter become white: thus, in Scotland the L. variabilis (4/19. G.R.\r\nWaterhouse 'Natural History of Mammalia: Rodents' 1846 pages 52, 60, 105.)\r\nin its winter dress has a shade of colour on its nose, and the tips of its\r\nears are black: in the L. tibetanus the ears are black, the upper surface\r\nof the tail greyish-black, and the soles of the feet brown: in L. glacialis\r\nthe winter fur is pure white, except the soles of the feet and the points\r\nof the ears. Even in the variously-coloured fancy rabbits we may often\r\nobserve a tendency in these same parts to be more darkly tinted than the\r\nrest of the body. Thus the several coloured marks on the Himalayan rabbits,\r\nas they grow old, are rendered intelligible. I may add a nearly analogous\r\ncase: fancy rabbits very often have a white star on their foreheads; and\r\nthe common English hare, whilst young, generally has, as I have myself\r\nobserved, a similar white star on its forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen variously coloured rabbits are set free in Europe, and are thus placed\r\nunder their natural conditions, they generally revert to the aboriginal\r\ngrey colour; this may be in part due to the tendency in all crossed\r\nanimals, as lately observed, to revert to their primordial state. But this\r\ntendency does not always prevail; thus silver-grey rabbits are kept in\r\nwarrens, and remain true though living almost in a state of nature; but a\r\nwarren must not be stocked with both silver-greys and common rabbits;\r\notherwise \"in a few years there will be none but common greys surviving.\"\r\n(4/20. Delamer on 'Pigeons and Rabbits' page 114.) When rabbits run wild in\r\nforeign countries under new conditions of life, they by no means always\r\nrevert to their aboriginal colour. In Jamaica the feral rabbits are\r\ndescribed as having been \"slate-coloured, deeply tinted with sprinklings of\r\nwhite on the neck, on the shoulders, and on the back; softening off to\r\nblue-white under the breast and belly.\" (4/21. Gosse 'Sojourn in Jamaica'\r\n1851 page 441 as described by an excellent observer, Mr. R. Hill. This is\r\nthe only known case in which rabbits have become feral in a hot country.\r\nThey can be kept, however, at Loanda (see Livingstone 'Travels' page 407).\r\nIn parts of India, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, they breed well.) But in\r\nthis tropical island the conditions were not favourable to their increase,\r\nand they never spread widely, and are now extinct, as I hear from Mr. R.\r\nHill, owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods. Rabbits during\r\nmany years have run wild in the Falkland Islands; they are abundant in\r\ncertain parts, but do not spread extensively. Most of them are of the\r\ncommon grey colour; a few, as I am informed by Admiral Sulivan, are hare-\r\ncoloured, and many are black, often with nearly symmetrical white marks on\r\ntheir faces. Hence, M. Lesson described the black variety as a distinct\r\nspecies, under the name of Lepus magellanicus, but this, as I have\r\nelsewhere shown, is an error. (4/22. Darwin 'Journal of Researches' page\r\n193; and 'Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle: Mammalia' page 92.) Within\r\nrecent times the sealers have stocked some of the small outlying islets in\r\nthe Falkland group with rabbits; and on Pebble Islet, as I hear from\r\nAdmiral Sulivan, a large proportion are hare-coloured, whereas on Rabbit\r\nIslet a large proportion are of a bluish colour, which is not elsewhere\r\nseen. How the rabbits were coloured which were turned out of these islets\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits which have become feral on the island of Porto Santo, near\r\nMadeira, deserve a fuller account. In 1418 or 1419, J. Gonzales Zarco\r\n(4/23. Kerr 'Collection of Voyages' volume 2 page 177: page 205 for Cada\r\nMosto. According to a work published in Lisbon in 1717 entitled 'Historia\r\nInsulana' written by a Jesuit, the rabbits were turned out in 1420. Some\r\nauthors believe that the island was discovered in 1413.) happened to have a\r\nfemale rabbit on board which had produced young during the voyage, and he\r\nturned them all out on the island. These animals soon increased so rapidly,\r\nthat they became a nuisance, and actually caused the abandonment of the\r\nsettlement. Thirty-seven years subsequently, Cada Mosto describes them as\r\ninnumerable; nor is this surprising, as the island was not inhabited by any\r\nbeast of prey or by any terrestrial mammal. We do not know the character of\r\nthe mother-rabbit; but it was probably the common domesticated kind. The\r\nSpanish peninsula, whence Zarco sailed, is known to have abounded with the\r\ncommon wild species at the most remote historical period; and as these\r\nrabbits were taken on board for food, it is improbable that they should\r\nhave been of any peculiar breed. That the breed was well domesticated is\r\nshown by the doe having littered during the voyage. Mr. Wollaston, at my\r\nrequest, brought home two of these feral rabbits in spirits of wine; and,\r\nsubsequently, Mr. W. Haywood sent to me three more specimens in brine, and\r\ntwo alive. These seven specimens, though caught at different periods,\r\nclosely resembled each other. They were full grown, as shown by the state\r\nof their bones. Although the conditions of life in Porto Santo are\r\nevidently highly favourable to rabbits, as proved by their extraordinarily\r\nrapid increase, yet they differ conspicuously in their small size from the\r\nwild English rabbit. Four English rabbits, measured from the incisors to\r\nthe anus, varied between 17 and 17 3/4 inches in length; whilst two of the\r\nPorto Santo rabbits were only 14 1/2 and 15 inches in length. But the\r\ndecrease in size is best shown by weight; four wild English rabbits\r\naveraged 3 pounds 5 ounces, whilst one of the Porto Santo rabbits, which\r\nhad lived for four years in the Zoological Gardens, but had become thin,\r\nweighed only 1 pound 9 ounces. A fairer test is afforded by the comparison\r\nof the well-cleaned limb-bones of a Porto Santo rabbit killed on the island\r\nwith the same bones of a wild English rabbit of average size, and they\r\ndiffered in the proportion of rather less than five to nine. So that the\r\nPorto Santo rabbits have decreased nearly three inches in length, and\r\nalmost half in weight of body. (4/24. Something of the same kind has\r\noccurred on the island of Lipari, where, according to Spallanzani ('Voyage\r\ndans les deux Siciles' quoted by Godron 'De l'Espece' page 364), a\r\ncountryman turned out some rabbits which multiplied prodigiously, but, says\r\nSpallanzani, \"les lapins de l'ile de Lipari sont plus petits que ceux qu'on\r\neleve en domesticite.\") The head has not decreased in length proportionally\r\nwith the body; and the capacity of the brain case is, as we shall hereafter\r\nsee, singularly variable. I prepared four skulls, and these resembled each\r\nother more closely than do generally the skulls of wild English rabbits;\r\nbut the only difference in structure which they presented was that the\r\nsupra-orbital processes of the frontal bones were narrower.\r\n\r\nIn colour the Porto Santo rabbit differs considerably from the common\r\nrabbit; the upper surface is redder, and is rarely interspersed with any\r\nblack or black-tipped hairs. The throat and certain parts of the under\r\nsurface, instead of being pure white, are generally pale grey or leaden\r\ncolour. But the most remarkable difference is in the ears and tail; I have\r\nexamined many fresh English rabbits, and the large collection of skins in\r\nthe British Museum from various countries, and all have the upper surface\r\nof the tail and the tips of the ears clothed with blackish-grey fur; and\r\nthis is given in most works as one of the specific characters of the\r\nrabbit. Now in the seven Porto Santo rabbits the upper surface of the tail\r\nwas reddish-brown, and the tips of the ears had no trace of the black\r\nedging. But here we meet with a singular circumstance: in June, 1861 I\r\nexamined two of these rabbits recently sent to the Zoological Gardens, and\r\ntheir tails and ears were coloured as just described; but when one of their\r\ndead bodies was sent to me in February, 1865, the ears were plainly edged,\r\nand the upper surface of the tail was covered with blackish-grey fur, and\r\nthe whole body was much less red; so that under the English climate this\r\nindividual rabbit had recovered the proper colour of its fur in rather less\r\nthan four years!\r\n\r\nThe two little Porto Santo rabbits, whilst alive in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nhad a remarkably different appearance from the common kind. They were\r\nextraordinarily wild and active, so that many persons exclaimed on seeing\r\nthem that they were more like large rats than rabbits. They were nocturnal\r\nto an unusual degree in their habits, and their wildness was never in the\r\nleast subdued; so that the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, assured me that he\r\nhad never had a wilder animal under his charge. This is a singular fact,\r\nconsidering that they are descended from a domesticated breed. I was so\r\nmuch surprised at it, that I requested Mr. Haywood to make inquiries on the\r\nspot, whether they were much hunted by the inhabitants, or persecuted by\r\nhawks, or cats, or other animals; but this is not the case, and no cause\r\ncan be assigned for their wildness. They live both on the central, higher\r\nrocky land and near the sea-cliffs, and, from being exceedingly shy and\r\ntimid, seldom appear in the lower and cultivated districts. They are said\r\nto produce from four to six young at a birth, and their breeding season is\r\nin July and August. Lastly, and this is a highly remarkable fact, Mr.\r\nBartlett could never succeed in getting these two rabbits, which were both\r\nmales, to associate or breed with the females of several breeds which were\r\nrepeatedly placed with them.\r\n\r\nIf the history of these Porto Santo rabbits had not been known, most\r\nnaturalists, on observing their much reduced size, their colour, reddish\r\nabove and grey beneath, their tails and ears not tipped with black, would\r\nhave ranked them as a distinct species. They would have been strongly\r\nconfirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the Zoological Gardens, and\r\nhearing that they refused to couple with other rabbits. Yet this rabbit,\r\nwhich there can be little doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct\r\nspecies, as certainly originated since the year 1420. Finally, from the\r\nthree cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and\r\nthe Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do not, under new\r\nconditions of life, revert to or retain their aboriginal character, as is\r\nso generally asserted to be the case by most authors.\r\n\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember, on the one hand, how frequently it is stated that\r\nimportant parts of the structure never vary; and, on the other hand, on\r\nwhat small differences in the skeleton fossil species have often been\r\nfounded, the variability of the skull and of some other bones in the\r\ndomesticated rabbit well deserves attention. It must not be supposed that\r\nthe more important differences immediately to be described strictly\r\ncharacterise any one breed; all that can be said is, that they are\r\ngenerally present in certain breeds. We should bear in mind that selection\r\nhas not been applied to fix any character in the skeleton, and that the\r\nanimals have not had to support themselves under uniform habits of life. We\r\ncannot account for most of the differences in the skeleton; but we shall\r\nsee that the increased size of the body, due to careful nurture and\r\ncontinued selection, has affected the head in a particular manner. Even the\r\nelongation and lopping of the ears have influenced in a small degree the\r\nform of the whole skull. The want of exercise has apparently modified the\r\nproportional length of the limbs in comparison with that of the body.\r\n\r\n[As a standard of comparison, I prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits from\r\nKent, one from the Shetland Islands, and one from Antrim in Ireland. As all\r\nthe bones in these four specimens from such distant localities closely\r\nresembled each other, presenting scarcely any appreciable difference, it\r\nmay be concluded that the bones of the wild rabbit are generally uniform in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSKULL.\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined skulls of ten large lop-eared rabbits, and of\r\nfive common domestic rabbits, which latter differ from the lop-eared only\r\nin not having such large bodies or ears, yet both larger than in the wild\r\nrabbit. First for the ten lop-eared rabbits: in all these the skull is\r\nremarkably elongated in comparison with its breadth. In a wild rabbit the\r\nlength was 3.15 inches, in a large fancy rabbit 4.3; whilst the breadth of\r\nthe cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost exactly the same. Even\r\nby taking as the standard of comparison the widest part of the zygomatic\r\narch, the skulls of the lop-eared are proportionally to their breadth\r\nthree-quarters of an inch too long. The depth of the head has increased\r\nalmost in the same proportion with the length; it is the breadth alone\r\nwhich has not increased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the\r\nbrain are less arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in\r\nthe wild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different.\r\nThe surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of sutures\r\nare more prominent.\r\n\r\nAlthough the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits in comparison with those\r\nof the wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their breadth, yet,\r\nrelatively to the size of body, they are far from elongated. The lop-eared\r\nrabbits which I examined were, though not fat, more than twice as heavy as\r\nthe wild specimens; but the skull was very far from being twice as long.\r\nEven if we take the fairer standard of the length of body, from the nose to\r\nthe anus, the skull is not on an average as long as it ought to be by a\r\nthird of an inch. In the small feral Porto Santo rabbit, on the other hand,\r\nthe head relatively to the length of body is about a quarter of an inch too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThis elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth, I find a universal\r\ncharacter, not only with the large lop-eared rabbits, but in all the\r\nartificial breeds; as is well seen in the skull of the Angora. I was at\r\nfirst much surprised at the fact, and could not imagine why domestication\r\ncould produce this uniform result; but the explanation seems to lie in the\r\ncircumstance that during a number of generations the artificial races have\r\nbeen closely confined, and have had little occasion to exert either their\r\nsenses, or intellect, or voluntary muscles; consequently the brain, as we\r\nshall presently more fully see, has not increased relatively with the size\r\nof body. As the brain has not increased, the bony case enclosing it has not\r\nincreased, and this has evidently affected through correlation the breadth\r\nof the entire skull from end to end.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 6.

Feral Rabbit from island of P. Santo,\r\nnear Madeira. C. Large Lop-eared Rabbit.)\r\n\r\nIn all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the supra-orbital plates\r\nor processes of the frontal bones are much broader than in the wild rabbit,\r\nand they generally project more upwards. In the zygomatic arch the\r\nposterior or projecting point of the malar-bone is broader and blunter; and\r\nin the specimen, figure 8, it is so in a remarkable degree. This point\r\napproaches nearer to the auditory meatus than in the wild rabbit, as may be\r\nbest seen in figure 8; but this circumstance mainly depends on the changed\r\ndirection of the meatus. The inter-parietal bone (see figure 9) differs\r\nmuch in shape in the several skulls; generally it is more oval, that is\r\nmore extended in the line of the longitudinal axis of the skull, than in\r\nthe wild rabbit. The posterior margin of \"the square raised platform\"\r\n(4/25. Waterhouse 'Nat. Hist. Mammalia' volume 2 page 36.) of the occiput,\r\ninstead of being truncated, or projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit,\r\nis in most lop-eared rabbits pointed, as in figure 9, C. The paramastoids\r\nrelatively to the size of the skull are generally much thicker than in the\r\nwild rabbit.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 10. OCCIPITAL FORAMEN, of natural size, in--A. Wild Rabbit; B.\r\nLarge Lop-eared Rabbit.)\r\n\r\nThe occipital foramen (figure 10) presents some remarkable differences: in\r\nthe wild rabbit, the lower edge between the condyles is considerably and\r\nalmost angularly hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and squarely\r\nnotched; hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse axis. In the\r\nskulls of the lop-eared rabbits the transverse axis exceeds the\r\nlongitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower edge between the\r\ncondyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there was no upper square\r\nnotch, in three there was a trace of the notch, and in two alone it was\r\nwell developed. These differences in the shape of the foramen are\r\nremarkable, considering that it gives passage to so important a structure\r\nas the spinal marrow, though apparently the outline of the latter is not\r\naffected by the shape of the passage.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 11. SKULL, of natural size, of Half-lop Rabbit, showing the\r\ndifferent direction of the auditory meatus on the two sides, and the\r\nconsequent general distortion of the skull. The left ear of the animal (or\r\nright side of figure) lopped forwards.)\r\n\r\nIn all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the bony auditory meatus\r\nis conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit. In a skull 4.3 inches in\r\nlength, and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a wild rabbit\r\n(which was 3.15 inches in length), the longer diameter of the meatus was\r\nexactly twice as great. The orifice is more compressed, and its margin on\r\nthe side nearest the skull stands up higher than the outer side. The whole\r\nmeatus is directed more forwards. As in breeding lop-eared rabbits the\r\nlength of the ears, and their consequent lopping and lying flat on the\r\nface, are the chief points of excellence, there can hardly be a doubt that\r\nthe great change in the size, form, and direction of the bony meatus,\r\nrelatively to this same part in the wild rabbit, is due to the continued\r\nselection of individuals having larger and larger ears. The influence of\r\nthe external ear on the bony meatus is well shown in the skulls (I have\r\nexamined three) of half-lops (see figure 5), in which one ear stands\r\nupright, and the other and longer ear hangs down; for in these skulls there\r\nwas a plain difference in the form and direction of the bony meatus on the\r\ntwo sides. But it is a much more interesting fact, that the changed\r\ndirection and increased size of the bony meatus have slightly affected on\r\nthe same side the structure of the whole skull. I here give a drawing\r\n(figure 11) of the skull of a half-lop; and it may be observed that the\r\nsuture between the parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at\r\nright angles to the longitudinal axis of the skull; the left frontal bone\r\nprojects beyond the right one; both the posterior and anterior margins of\r\nthe left zygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in\r\nadvance of the corresponding bones on the opposite side. Even the lower jaw\r\nis affected, and the condyles are not quite symmetrical, that on the left\r\nstanding a little in advance of that on the right. This seems to me a\r\nremarkable case of correlation of growth. Who would have surmised that by\r\nkeeping an animal during many generations under confinement, and so leading\r\nto the disuse of the muscles of the ears, and by continually selecting\r\nindividuals with the longest and largest ears, he would thus indirectly\r\nhave affected almost every suture in the skull and the form of the lower\r\njaw!\r\n\r\nIn the large lop-eared rabbits the only difference in the lower jaw, in\r\ncomparison with that of the wild rabbit, is that the posterior margin of\r\nthe ascending ramus is broader and more inflected. The teeth in neither jaw\r\npresent any difference, except that the small incisors, beneath the large\r\nones, are proportionately a little longer. The molar teeth have increased\r\nin size proportionately with the increased width of the skull, measured\r\nacross the zygomatic arch, and not proportionally with its increased\r\nlength. The inner line of the sockets of the molar teeth in the upper jaw\r\nof the wild rabbit forms a perfectly straight line; but in some of the\r\nlargest skulls of the lop-eared this line was plainly bowed inwards. In one\r\nspecimen there was an additional molar tooth on each side of the upper jaw,\r\nbetween the molars and premolars; but these two teeth did not correspond in\r\nsize; and as no rodent has seven molars, this is merely a monstrosity,\r\nthough a curious one.\r\n\r\nThe five other skulls of common domestic rabbits, some of which approach in\r\nsize the above-described largest skulls, whilst the others exceed but\r\nlittle those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as presenting a\r\nperfect gradation in all the above-specified differences between the skulls\r\nof the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. In all, however, the supra-\r\norbital plates are rather larger, and in all the auditory meatus is larger,\r\nin conformity with the increased size of the external ears, than in the\r\nwild rabbit. The lower notch in the occipital foramen in some was not so\r\ndeep as in the wild rabbit, but in all five skulls the upper notch was well\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the Angora rabbit, like the latter five skulls, is\r\nintermediate in general proportions, and in most other characters, between\r\nthose of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents only one\r\nsingular character: though considerably longer than the skull of the wild\r\nrabbit, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital fissures is\r\nnearly a third less than in the wild. The skulls of the silver-grey, and\r\nchinchilla and Himalayan rabbits are more elongated than in the wild, with\r\nbroader supra-orbital plates, but differ little in any other respect,\r\nexcepting that the upper and lower notches of the occipital foramen are not\r\nso deep or so well developed. The skull of the Moscow rabbit scarcely\r\ndiffers at all from that of the wild rabbit. In the Porto Santo feral\r\nrabbits the supra-orbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed\r\nthan in our wild rabbits.\r\n\r\nAs some of the largest lop-eared rabbits of which I prepared skeletons were\r\ncoloured almost like hares, and as these latter animals and rabbits have,\r\nas it is affirmed, been recently crossed in France, it might be thought\r\nthat some of the above-described characters had been derived from a cross\r\nat a remote period with the hare. Consequently I examined skulls of the\r\nhare, but no light could thus be thrown on the peculiarities of the skulls\r\nof the larger rabbits. It is, however, an interesting fact, as illustrating\r\nthe law that varieties of one species often assume the characters of other\r\nspecies of the same genus, that I found, on comparing the skulls of ten\r\nspecies of hares in the British Museum, that they differed from each other\r\nchiefly in the very same points in which domestic rabbits vary,--namely, in\r\ngeneral proportions, in the form and size of the supra-orbital plates, in\r\nthe form of the free end of the malar bone, and in the line of suture\r\nseparating the occipital and frontal bones. Moreover two eminently variable\r\ncharacters in the domestic rabbit, namely, the outline of the occipital\r\nforamen and the shape of the \"raised platform\" of the occiput, were\r\nlikewise variable in two instances in the same species of hare.\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\nThe number is uniform in all the skeletons which I have examined, with two\r\nexceptions, namely, in one of the small feral Porto Santo rabbits and in\r\none of the largest lop-eared kinds; both of these had as usual seven\r\ncervical, twelve dorsal with ribs, but, instead of seven lumbar, both had\r\neight lumbar vertebrae. This is remarkable, as Gervais gives seven as the\r\nnumber for the whole genus Lepus. The caudal vertebrae apparently differ by\r\ntwo or three, but I did not attend to them, and they are difficult to count\r\nwith certainty.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 12. ATLAS VERTEBRAE, of natural size; inferior surface viewed\r\nobliquely. Upper figure, Wild Rabbit. Lower figure, Hare-coloured, large,\r\nLop-eared Rabbit, a, supra-median, atlantoid process; b, infra-median\r\nprocess.)\r\n\r\nIn the first cervical vertebra, or atlas, the anterior margin of the neural\r\narch varies a little in wild specimens, being either nearly smooth, or\r\nfurnished with a small supra-median atlantoid process; I have figured a\r\nspecimen with the largest process (a) which I have seen; but it will be\r\nobserved how inferior this is in size and different in shape to that in a\r\nlarge lop-eared rabbit. In the latter, the infra-median process (b) is also\r\nproportionally much thicker and longer. The alae are a little squarer in\r\noutline.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 13. THIRD CERVICAL VERTEBRAE, of natural size, of: A. Wild Rabbit;\r\nB. Hare-coloured, large, Lop-eared Rabbit, a, a, inferior surface; b, b,\r\nanterior articular surfaces.)\r\n\r\nTHIRD CERVICAL VERTEBRA.\r\n\r\nIn the wild rabbit (figure 13, A a) this vertebra, viewed on the inferior\r\nsurface, has a transverse process, which is directed obliquely backwards,\r\nand consists of a single pointed bar; in the fourth vertebra this process\r\nis slightly forked in the middle. In the large lop-eared rabbits this\r\nprocess (B a) is forked in the third vertebra, as in the fourth of the wild\r\nrabbit. But the third cervical vertebrae of the wild and lop-eared (A b, B\r\nb) rabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular surfaces\r\nare compared; for the extremities of the antero-dorsal processes in the\r\nwild rabbit are simply rounded, whilst in the lop-eared they are trifid,\r\nwith a deep central pit. The canal for the spinal marrow in the lop-eared\r\n(B b) is more elongated in a transverse direction than in the wild rabbit;\r\nand the passages for the arteries are of a slightly different shape. These\r\nseveral differences in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention.\r\n\r\nFIRST DORSAL VERTEBRA.\r\n\r\nIts neural spine varies in length in the wild rabbit; being sometimes very\r\nshort, but generally more than half as long as that of the second dorsal;\r\nbut I have seen it in two large lop-eared rabbits three-fourths of the\r\nlength of that of the second dorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 14. DORSAL VERTEBRAE, from sixth to tenth inclusive, of natural\r\nsize, viewed laterally. A. Wild Rabbit. B. Large, Hare-coloured, so called\r\nSpanish Rabbit.)\r\n\r\nNINTH AND TENTH DORSAL VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\nIn the wild rabbit the neural spine of the ninth vertebra is just\r\nperceptibly thicker than that of the eighth; and the neural spine of the\r\ntenth is plainly thicker and shorter than those of all the anterior\r\nvertebrae. In the large lop-eared rabbits the neural spines of the tenth,\r\nninth, and eighth vertebrae, and even in a slight degree that of the\r\nseventh, are very much thicker, and of somewhat different shape, in\r\ncomparison with those of the wild rabbit. So that this part of the\r\nvertebral column differs considerably in appearance from the same part in\r\nthe wild rabbit, and closely resembles in an interesting manner these same\r\nvertebrae in some species of hares. In the Angora, Chinchilla, and\r\nHimalayan rabbits, the neural spines of the eighth and ninth vertebrae are\r\nin a slight degree thicker than in the wild. On the other hand, in one of\r\nthe feral Porto Santo rabbits, which in most of its characters deviates\r\nfrom the common wild rabbit, in a direction exactly opposite to that\r\nassumed by the large lop-eared rabbits, the neural spines of the ninth and\r\ntenth vertebrae were not at all larger than those of the several anterior\r\nvertebra. In this same Porto Santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth\r\nvertebra of the anterior lateral processes (see figure 14), which are\r\nplainly developed in all British wild rabbits, and still more plainly\r\ndeveloped in the large lop-eared rabbits. In a half-wild rabbit from Sandon\r\nPark (4/26. These rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in Sandon\r\nPark, and in other places in Staffordshire and Shropshire. They originated,\r\nas I have been informed by the gamekeeper, from variously-coloured domestic\r\nrabbits which had been turned out. They vary in colour; but many are\r\nsymmetrically coloured, being white with a streak along the spine, and with\r\nthe ears and certain marks about the head of a blackish-grey tint. They\r\nhave rather longer bodies than common rabbits), a haemal spine was\r\nmoderately well developed on the under side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra,\r\nand I have seen this in no other specimen.\r\n\r\nLUMBAR VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\nI have stated that in two cases there were eight instead of seven lumbar\r\nvertebrae. The third lumbar vertebrae in one skeleton of a wild British\r\nrabbit, and in one of the Porto Santo feral rabbits, had a haemal spine;\r\nwhilst in four skeletons of large lop-eared rabbits, and in the Himalayan\r\nrabbit, this same vertebra had a well developed haemal spine.\r\n\r\nPELVIS.\r\n\r\nIn four wild specimens this bone was almost absolutely identical in shape;\r\nbut in several domesticated breeds shades of differences could be\r\ndistinguished. In the large lop-eared rabbits, the whole upper part of the\r\nilium is straighter, or less splayed outwards, than in the wild rabbit; and\r\nthe tuberosity on the inner lip of the anterior and upper part of the ilium\r\nis proportionally more prominent.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 15. TERMINAL BONE OF STERNUM, of natural size, A. Wild Rabbit. B.\r\nHare-coloured, Lop-eared Rabbit. C. Hare-coloured Spanish Rabbit. (N.B. The\r\nleft-hand angle of the upper articular extremity of B was broken, and has\r\nbeen accidentally thus represented.))\r\n\r\nSTERNUM.\r\n\r\nThe posterior end of the posterior sternal bone in the wild rabbit (figure\r\n15, A) is thin and slightly enlarged; in some of the large lop-eared\r\nrabbits (B) it is much more enlarged towards the extremity; whilst in other\r\nspecimens (C) it keeps nearly of the same breadth from end to end, but is\r\nmuch thicker at the extremity.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 16. ACROMION OF SCAPULA, of natural size. A. Wild Rabbit. B, C, D,\r\nLarge, Lop-eared Rabbits.)\r\n\r\nSCAPULA.\r\n\r\nThe acromion sends out a rectangular bar, ending in an oblique knob, which\r\nlatter in the wild rabbit (figure 16, A) varies a little in shape and size,\r\nas does the apex of the acromion in sharpness, and the part just below the\r\nrectangular bar in breadth. But the variations in these respects in the\r\nwild rabbit are very slight: whilst in the large lop-eared rabbits they are\r\nconsiderable. Thus in some specimens (B) the oblique terminal knob is\r\ndeveloped into a short bar, forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular\r\nbar. In another specimen (C) these two unequal bars form nearly a straight\r\nline. The apex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness, as may\r\nbe seen by comparing figures B, C, and D.\r\n\r\nLIMBS.\r\n\r\nIn these I could detect no variation; but the bones of the feet were too\r\ntroublesome to compare with much care.]\r\n\r\nI have now described all the differences in the skeletons which I have\r\nobserved. It is impossible not to be struck with the high degree of\r\nvariability or plasticity of many of the bones. We see how erroneous the\r\noften-repeated statement is, that only the crests of the bones which give\r\nattachment to muscles vary in shape, and that only parts of slight\r\nimportance become modified under domestication. No one will say, for\r\ninstance, that the occipital foramen, or the atlas, or the third cervical\r\nvertebra is a part of slight importance. If the several vertebrae of the\r\nwild and lop-eared rabbits, of which figures have been given, had been\r\nfound fossil, palaeontologists would have declared without hesitation that\r\nthey had belonged to distinct species.\r\n\r\n[THE EFFECTS OF THE USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS.\r\n\r\nIn the large lop-eared rabbits the relative proportional length of the\r\nbones of the same leg, and of the front and hind legs compared with each\r\nother, have remained nearly the same as in the wild rabbit; but in weight,\r\nthe bones of the hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion\r\nwith the front legs. The weight of the whole body in the large rabbits\r\nexamined by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the\r\nwild rabbit; and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken\r\ntogether (excluding the feet, on account of the difficulty of cleaning so\r\nmany small bones) has increased in the large lop-eared rabbits in nearly\r\nthe same proportion; consequently in due proportion to the weight of body\r\nwhich they have to support. If we take the length of the body as the\r\nstandard of comparison, the limbs of the large rabbits have not increased\r\nin length in due proportion by one inch and a half. Again, if we take as\r\nthe standard of comparison the length of the skull, which, as we have\r\nbefore seen, has not increased in length in due proportion to the length of\r\nbody, the limbs will be found to be, proportionally with those of the wild\r\nrabbit, from half to three-quarters of an inch too short. Hence, whatever\r\nstandard of comparison be taken, the limb-bones of the large lop-eared\r\nrabbits have not increased in length, though they have in weight, in full\r\nproportion to the other parts of the frame; and this, I presume, may be\r\naccounted for by the inactive life which during many generations they have\r\nspent. Nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the\r\nincreased length of the body.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting point,\r\nto which I was led to attend by finding, as previously stated, that with\r\nall domesticated rabbits the length of the skull relatively to its breadth\r\nhas greatly increased in comparison with that of the wild rabbits. If we\r\nhad possessed a large number of domesticated rabbits of nearly the same\r\nsize with the wild rabbits, it would have been a simple task to have\r\nmeasured and compared the capacities of their skulls. But this is not the\r\ncase: almost all the domestic breeds have larger bodies than wild rabbits,\r\nand the lop-eared kinds are more than double their weight. As a small\r\nanimal has to exert its senses, intellect, and instincts equally with a\r\nlarge animal, we ought not by any means to expect an animal twice or thrice\r\nas large as another to have a brain of double or treble the size. (4/27.\r\nSee Prof. Owen's remarks on this subject in his paper on the 'Zoological\r\nSignificance of the Brain, etc., of Man, etc.' read before Brit.\r\nAssociation 1862: with respect to Birds see 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' January\r\n11, 1848 page 8.) Now, after weighing the bodies of four wild rabbits, and\r\nof four large but not fattened lop-eared rabbits, I find that on an average\r\nthe wild are to the lop-eared in weight as 1 to 2.17; in average length of\r\nbody as 1 to 1.41; whilst in capacity of skull they are as 1 to 1.15. Hence\r\nwe see that the capacity of the skull, and consequently the size of the\r\nbrain, has increased but little, relatively to the increased size of the\r\nbody; and this fact explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to its\r\nlength in all domestic rabbits.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3: MEASUREMENTS OF WILD AND SEMI-WILD RABBITS.\r\n\r\nI.

As these rabbits differ so greatly in size, it is necessary to have\r\nsome standard by which to compare the capacities of their skulls. I have\r\nselected the length of skull as the best standard, for in the larger\r\nrabbits it has not, as already stated, increased in length so much as the\r\nbody; but as the skull, like every other part, varies in length, neither it\r\nnor any other part affords a perfect standard.\r\n\r\nIn the first column of figures the extreme length of the skull is given in\r\ninches and decimals. I am aware that these measurements pretend to greater\r\naccuracy than is possible; but I have found it the least trouble to record\r\nthe exact length which the compass gave. The second and third columns give\r\nthe length and weight of body, whenever these observations were made. The\r\nfourth column gives the capacity of the skull by the weight of small shot\r\nwith which the skulls were filled; but it is not pretended that these\r\nweights are accurate within a few grains. In the fifth column the capacity\r\nis given which the skull ought to have had by calculation, according to the\r\nlength of skull, in comparison with that of the wild rabbit No. 1; in the\r\nsixth column the difference between the actual and calculated capacities,\r\nand in the seventh the percentage of increase or decrease, are given. For\r\ninstance, as the wild rabbit No. 5 has a shorter and lighter body than the\r\nwild rabbit No. 1, we might have expected that its skull would have had\r\nless capacity; the actual capacity, as expressed by the weight of shot, is\r\n875 grains, which is 97 grains less than that of the first rabbit. But\r\ncomparing these two rabbits by the length of their skulls, we see that in\r\nNo. 1 the skull is 3.15 inches in length, and in No. 5 2.96 inches in\r\nlength; according to this ratio, the brain of No. 5 ought to have had a\r\ncapacity of 913 grains of shot, which is above the actual capacity, but\r\nonly by 38 grains. Or, to put the case in another way (as in column VII),\r\nthe brain of this small rabbit, No. 5, for every 100 grains of weight is\r\nonly 4 grains too light,--that is, it ought, according to the standard\r\nrabbit No. 1, to have been 4 per cent heavier. I have taken the rabbit No.\r\n1 as the standard of comparison because, of the skulls having a full\r\naverage length, this has the least capacity; so that it is the least\r\nfavourable to the result which I wish to show, namely, that the brain in\r\nall long-domesticated rabbits has decreased in size, either actually, or\r\nrelatively to the length of the head and body, in comparison with the brain\r\nof the wild rabbit. Had I taken the Irish rabbit, No. 3, as the standard,\r\nthe following results would have been somewhat more striking.\r\n\r\nTurning to Table 3: the first four wild rabbits have skulls of the same\r\nlength, and these differ but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit (No. 4)\r\nis interesting, as, though now wild, it is known to be descended from a\r\ndomesticated breed, as is still shown by its peculiar colouring and longer\r\nbody; nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length and full\r\ncapacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but of small size, and they all\r\nhave skulls with slightly lessened capacities. The three Porto Santo feral\r\nrabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a perplexing case; their bodies are greatly\r\nreduced in size, as in a lesser degree are their skulls in length and in\r\nactual capacity, in comparison with the skulls of wild English rabbits. But\r\nwhen we compare the capacities of the skull in the three Porto Santo\r\nrabbits, we observe a surprising difference, which does not stand in any\r\nrelation to the slight difference in the length of their skulls, nor, as I\r\nbelieve, to any difference in the size of their bodies; but I neglected\r\nweighing separately their bodies. I can hardly suppose that the medullary\r\nmatter of the brain in these three rabbits, living under similar\r\nconditions, can differ as much as is indicated by the proportional\r\ndifference of capacity in their skulls; nor do I know whether it is\r\npossible that one brain may contain considerably more fluid than another.\r\nHence I can throw no light on this case.\r\n\r\nLooking to the lower half of Table 3, which gives the measurements of\r\ndomesticated rabbits, we see that in all the capacity of the skull is less,\r\nbut in very various degrees, than might have been anticipated according to\r\nthe length of their skulls, relatively to that of the wild rabbit No. 1. In\r\nline 22 the average measurements of seven large lop-eared rabbits are\r\ngiven. Now the question arises, has the average capacity of the skull in\r\nthese seven large rabbits increased as much as might have been expected\r\nfrom the greatly increased size of body. We may endeavour to answer this\r\nquestion in two ways: in the upper half of the Table we have measurements\r\nof the skulls of six small wild rabbits (Nos. 5 to 10), and we find that on\r\nan average the skulls are .18 of an inch shorter, and in capacity 91 grains\r\nless, than the average length and capacity of the three first wild rabbits\r\non the list. The seven large lop-eared rabbits, on an average, have skulls\r\n4.11 inches in length, and 1136 grains in capacity; so that these skulls\r\nhave increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of the\r\nsix small wild rabbits have decreased in length; hence we might have\r\nexpected that the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits would have\r\nincreased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the six small\r\nrabbits have decreased in capacity; and this would have given an average\r\nincreased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real average increase is only\r\n155 grains. Again, the large lop-eared rabbits have bodies of nearly the\r\nsame weight and size as the common hare, but their heads are longer;\r\nconsequently, if the lop-eared rabbits had been wild, it might have been\r\nexpected that their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that\r\nof the skull of the hare. But this is far from being the case; for the\r\naverage capacity of the two hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much larger\r\nthan the average capacity of the seven lop-eared skulls, that the latter\r\nwould have to be increased 21 per cent to come up to the standard of the\r\nhare. (4/23. This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr.\r\nCrisp ('Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1861 page 86) gives 210 grains as the actual\r\nweight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds, and 125 grains as the\r\nweight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 pounds 5 ounces, that is,\r\nthe same weight as the rabbit No. 1 in my list. Now the contents of the\r\nskull of rabbit No. 1 in shot is in my table 972 grains; and according to\r\nDr. Crisp's ratio of 125 to 210, the skull of the hare ought to have\r\ncontained 1632 grains of shot, instead of only (in the largest hare in my\r\ntable) 1455 grains.)\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked that, if we had possessed many domestic rabbits\r\nof the same average size with the wild rabbit, it would have been easy to\r\ncompare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora\r\nrabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in body and\r\nhave skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal, and we see that the\r\nactual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal, and\r\nconsiderably less by calculation (column 7), according to the difference in\r\nthe length of their skulls. The narrowness of the brain-case in these three\r\nrabbits could be plainly seen and proved by external measurement. The\r\nChinchilla rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild\r\nrabbit, yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the\r\nwild rabbit. The Angora rabbit, No. 13, offers the most remarkable case;\r\nthis animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the\r\nstamp of long domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than\r\nthe wild rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of\r\neven the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of\r\nskull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have\r\nbeen! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor\r\nidiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised me, that I\r\nrepeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also compared\r\nthe capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the wild rabbit by\r\nother standards, namely, by the length and weight of the body, and by the\r\nweight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards the brain appears to\r\nbe much too small, though in a less degree when the standard of the limb-\r\nbones was used; and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for\r\nby the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much\r\nreduced in weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer\r\nthat in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in\r\nbeing quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really\r\nundergone a remarkable amount of reduction.]\r\n\r\nFrom the several facts above given,--namely, firstly, that the actual\r\ncapacity of the skull in the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora breeds, is less\r\nthan in the wild rabbit, though they are in all their dimensions rather\r\nlarger animals; secondly, that the capacity of the skull of the large lop-\r\neared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio as the\r\ncapacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been decreased; and\r\nthirdly, that the capacity of the skull in these same large lop-eared\r\nrabbits is very inferior to that of the hare, an animal of nearly the same\r\nsize,--I conclude, notwithstanding the remarkable differences in capacity\r\nin the skulls of the small Porto Santo rabbits, and likewise in the large\r\nlop-eared kinds, that in all long-domesticated rabbits the brain has either\r\nby no means increased in due proportion with the increased length of the\r\nhead and increased size of the body, or that it has actually decreased in\r\nsize, relatively to what would have occurred had these animals lived in a\r\nstate of nature. When we remember that rabbits, from having been\r\ndomesticated and closely confined during many generations, cannot have\r\nexerted their intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements, either\r\nin escaping from various dangers or in searching for food, we may conclude\r\nthat their brains will have been feebly exercised, and consequently have\r\nsuffered in development. We thus see that the most important and\r\ncomplicated organ in the whole organisation is subject to the law of\r\ndecrease in size from disuse.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us sum up the more important modifications which domestic\r\nrabbits have undergone, together with their causes as far as we can\r\nobscurely see them. By the supply of abundant and nutritious food, together\r\nwith little exercise, and by the continued selection of the heaviest\r\nindividuals, the weight of the larger breeds has been more than doubled.\r\nThe bones of the limbs taken together have increased in weight, in due\r\nproportion with the increased weight of body, but the hind legs have\r\nincreased less than the front legs; but in length they have not increased\r\nin due proportion, and this may have been caused by the want of proper\r\nexercise. With the increased size of the body the third cervical has\r\nassumed characters proper to the fourth cervical vertebra; and the eighth\r\nand ninth dorsal vertebrae have similarly assumed characters proper to the\r\ntenth and posterior vertebrae. The skull in the larger breeds has increased\r\nin length, but not in due proportion with the increased length of body; the\r\nbrain has not duly increased in dimensions, or has even actually decreased,\r\nand consequently the bony case for the brain has remained narrow, and by\r\ncorrelation has affected the bones of the face and the entire length of the\r\nskull. The skull has thus acquired its characteristic narrowness. From\r\nunknown causes the supra-orbital process of the frontal bones and the free\r\nend of the malar bones have increased in breadth; and in the larger breeds\r\nthe occipital foramen is generally much less deeply notched than in wild\r\nrabbits. Certain parts of the scapula and the terminal sternal bones have\r\nbecome highly variable in shape. The ears have been increased enormously in\r\nlength and breadth through continued selection; their weight, conjoined\r\nprobably with the disuse of their muscles, has caused them to lop\r\ndownwards; and this has affected the position and form of the bony auditory\r\nmeatus; and this again, by correlation, the position in a slight degree of\r\nalmost every bone in the upper part of the skull, and even the position of\r\nthe condyles of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC PIGEONS.\r\n\r\nENUMERATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL BREEDS.\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\nVARIATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE.\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS: SKULL, LOWER JAW, NUMBER OF VERTEBRAE.\r\nCORRELATION OF GROWTH: TONGUE WITH BEAK; EYELIDS AND NOSTRILS WITH WATTLED\r\nSKIN.\r\nNUMBER OF WING-FEATHERS, AND LENGTH OF WING.\r\nCOLOUR AND DOWN.\r\nWEBBED AND FEATHERED FEET.\r\nON THE EFFECTS OF DISUSE.\r\nLENGTH OF FEET IN CORRELATION WITH LENGTH OF BEAK.\r\nLENGTH OF STERNUM, SCAPULA, AND FURCULUM.\r\nLENGTH OF WINGS.\r\nSUMMARY ON THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERAL BREEDS.\r\n\r\nI have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular care, because the\r\nevidence that all the domestic races are descended from one known source is\r\nfar clearer than with any other anciently domesticated animal. Secondly,\r\nbecause many treatises in several languages, some of them old, have been\r\nwritten on the pigeon, so that we are enabled to trace the history of\r\nseveral breeds. And lastly, because, from causes which we can partly\r\nunderstand, the amount of variation has been extraordinarily great. The\r\ndetails will often be tediously minute; but no one who really wants to\r\nunderstand the progress of change in domestic animals, and especially no\r\none who has kept pigeons and has marked the great difference between the\r\nbreeds and the trueness with which most of them propagate their kind, will\r\ndoubt that this minuteness is worth while. Notwithstanding the clear\r\nevidence that all the breeds are the descendants of a single species, I\r\ncould not persuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount\r\nof difference between them, had arisen since man first domesticated the\r\nwild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nI have kept alive all the most distinct breeds, which I could procure in\r\nEngland or from the Continent; and have prepared skeletons of all. I have\r\nreceived skins from Persia, and a large number from India and other\r\nquarters of the world. (5/1. The Hon. C. Murray has sent me some very\r\nvaluable specimens from Persia; and H.M. Consul, Mr. Keith Abbott, has\r\ngiven me information on the pigeons of the same country. I am deeply\r\nindebted to Sir Walter Elliot for an immense collection of skins from\r\nMadras, with much information regarding them. Mr. Blyth has freely\r\ncommunicated to me his stores of knowledge on this and all other related\r\nsubjects. The Rajah Sir James Brooke sent me specimens from Borneo, as has\r\nH.M. Consul, Mr. Swinhoe, from Amoy in China, and Dr. Daniell from the west\r\ncoast of Africa.) Since my admission into two of the London pigeon-clubs, I\r\nhave received the kindest assistance from many of the most eminent\r\namateurs. (5/2. Mr. B.P. Brent, well known for his various contributions to\r\npoultry literature, has aided me in every way during several years: so has\r\nMr. Tegetmeier, with unwearied kindness. This latter gentleman, who is well\r\nknown for his works on poultry, and who has largely bred pigeons, has\r\nlooked over this and the following chapters. Mr. Bult formerly showed me\r\nhis unrivalled collection of Pouters, and gave me specimens. I had access\r\nto Mr. Wicking's collection, which contained a greater assortment of kinds\r\nthan could anywhere else be seen; and he has always aided me with specimens\r\nand information given in the freest manner. Mr. Haynes and Mr. Corker have\r\ngiven me specimens of their magnificent Carriers. To Mr. Harrison Weir I am\r\nlikewise indebted. Nor must I by any means pass over the assistance\r\nreceived from Mr. J.M. Eaton, Mr. Baker, Mr. Evans, and Mr. J. Baily, jun.,\r\nof Mount-street--to the latter gentleman I have been indebted for some\r\nvaluable specimens. To all these gentlemen I beg permission to return my\r\nsincere and cordial thanks.)\r\n\r\nThe races of the Pigeon which can be distinguished, and which breed true,\r\nare very numerous. MM. Boitard and Corbie (5/3. 'Les Pigeons de Voliere et\r\nde Colombier' Paris 1824. During forty-five years the sole occupation of M.\r\nCorbie was the care of the pigeons belonging to the Duchess of Berry.\r\nBonizzi has described a large number of coloured varieties in Italy: 'Le\r\nvariazioni dei colombi Domestici' Padova 1873.) describe in detail 122\r\nkinds; and I could add several European kinds not known to them. In India,\r\njudging from the skins sent me, there are many breeds unknown here; and Sir\r\nW. Elliot informs me that a collection imported by an Indian merchant into\r\nMadras from Cairo and Constantinople included several kinds unknown in\r\nIndia. I have no doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which\r\nbreed true and have been separately named. But of these the far greater\r\nnumber differ from each other only in unimportant characters. Such\r\ndifferences will be here entirely passed over, and I shall confine myself\r\nto the more important points of structure. That many important differences\r\nexist we shall presently see. I have looked through the magnificent\r\ncollection of the Columbidae in the British Museum, and, with the exception\r\nof a few forms (such as the Didunculus, Calaenas, Goura, etc.), I do not\r\nhesitate to affirm that some domestic races of the rock-pigeon differ fully\r\nas much from each other in external characters as do the most distinct\r\nnatural genera. We may look in vain through the 288 known species (5/4.\r\n'Coup d'Oeil sur l'Ordre des Pigeons' par Prince C.L. Bonaparte, Paris\r\n1855. This author makes 288 species, ranked under 85 genera.) for a beak so\r\nsmall and conical as that of the short-faced tumbler; for one so broad and\r\nshort as that of the barb; for one so long, straight, and narrow, with its\r\nenormous wattles, as that of the English carrier; for an expanded upraised\r\ntail like that of the fantail; or for an oesophagus like that of the\r\npouter. I do not for a moment pretend that the domestic races differ from\r\neach other in their whole organisation as much as the more distinct natural\r\ngenera. I refer only to external characters, on which, however, it must be\r\nconfessed that most genera of birds have been founded. When, in a future\r\nchapter, we discuss the principle of selection as followed by man, we shall\r\nclearly see why the differences between the domestic races are almost\r\nalways confined to external, or at least to externally visible, characters.\r\n\r\nOwing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several\r\nbreeds, I have found it indispensable in the following classification to\r\nrank them under Groups, Races, and Sub-races; to which varieties and sub-\r\nvarieties, all strictly inheriting their proper characters, must often be\r\nadded. Even with the individuals of the same sub-variety, when long kept by\r\ndifferent fanciers, different strains can sometimes be recognised. There\r\ncan be no doubt that, if well-characterised forms of the several races had\r\nbeen found wild, all would have been ranked as distinct species, and\r\nseveral of them would certainly have been placed by ornithologists in\r\ndistinct genera. A good classification of the various domestic breeds is\r\nextremely difficult, owing to the manner in which many of the forms\r\ngraduate into each other; but it is curious how exactly the same\r\ndifficulties are encountered, and the same rules have to be followed, as in\r\nthe classification of any natural but difficult group of organic beings. An\r\n\"artificial classification\" might be followed which would present fewer\r\ndifficulties than a \"natural classification;\" but then it would interrupt\r\nmany plain affinities. Extreme forms can readily be defined; but\r\nintermediate and troublesome forms often destroy our definitions. Forms\r\nwhich may be called \"aberrant\" must sometimes be included within groups to\r\nwhich they do not accurately belong. Characters of all kinds must be used;\r\nbut as with birds in a state of nature, those afforded by the beak are the\r\nbest and most readily appreciated. It is not possible to weigh the\r\nimportance of all the characters which have to be used so as to make the\r\ngroups and sub-groups of equal value. Lastly, a group may contain only one\r\nrace, and another and less distinctly defined group may contain several\r\nraces and sub-races, and in this case it is difficult, as in the\r\nclassification of natural species, to avoid placing too high a value on the\r\nnumber of forms which a group may contain.\r\n\r\nIn my measurements I have never trusted to the eye; and when speaking of a\r\npart being large or small, I always refer to the wild rock-pigeon (Columba\r\nlivia) as the standard of comparison. The measurements are given in\r\ndecimals of an inch.\r\n\r\n(5/5.

Diagram 1.\r\nmay aid the reader in learning their names and seeing their affinities. The\r\nrock-pigeon, or Columba livia (including under this name two or three\r\nclosely-allied sub-species or geographical races, hereafter to be\r\ndescribed), may be confidently viewed, as we shall see in the next chapter,\r\nas the common parent-form. The names in italics on the right-hand side of\r\nthe page show us the most distinct breeds, or those which have undergone\r\nthe greatest amount of modification. The lengths of the dotted lines rudely\r\nrepresent the degree of distinctness of each breed from the parent-stock,\r\nand the names placed under each other in the columns show the more or less\r\nclosely connecting links. The distances of the dotted lines from each other\r\napproximately represent the amount of difference between the several\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 18. ENGLISH POUTER.)\r\n\r\nGROUP I.\r\n\r\nThis group includes a single race, that of the Pouters. If the most\r\nstrongly marked sub-race be taken, namely, the Improved English Pouter,\r\nthis is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons.\r\n\r\nRACE I. POUTER PIGEONS. (KROPFTAUBEN, GERMAN. GROSSES-GORGES, OR BOULANS,\r\nFRENCH.)\r\n\r\nOesophagus of great size, barely separated from the crop, often inflated.\r\nBody and legs elongated. Beak of moderate dimensions.\r\n\r\n[SUB-RACE 1/I.\r\n\r\nThe improved English Pouter, when its crop is fully inflated, presents a\r\ntruly astonishing appearance. The habit of slightly inflating the crop is\r\ncommon to all domestic pigeons, but is carried to an extreme in the Pouter.\r\nThe crop does not differ, except in size, from that of other pigeons; but\r\nis less plainly separated by an oblique constriction from the oesophagus.\r\nThe diameter of the upper part of the oesophagus is immense, even close up\r\nto the head. The beak in one bird which I possessed was almost completely\r\nburied when the oesophagus was fully expanded. The males, especially when\r\nexcited, pout more than the females, and they glory in exercising this\r\npower. If a bird will not, to use the technical expression, \"play,\" the\r\nfancier, as I have witnessed, by taking the beak into his mouth, blows him\r\nup like a balloon; and the bird, then puffed up with wind and pride, struts\r\nabout, retaining his magnificent size as long as he can. Pouters often take\r\nflight with their crops inflated. After one of my birds had swallowed a\r\ngood meal of peas and water, as he flew up in order to disgorge them and\r\nfeed his nearly fledged young, I heard the peas rattling in his inflated\r\ncrop as if in a bladder. When flying, they often strike the backs of their\r\nwings together, and thus make a clapping noise.\r\n\r\nPouters stand remarkably upright, and their bodies are thin and elongated.\r\nIn connexion with this form of body, the ribs are generally broader and the\r\nvertebrae more numerous than in other breeds. From their manner of standing\r\ntheir legs appear longer than they really are, though, in proportion with\r\nthose of C. livia, the legs and feet are actually longer. The wings appear\r\nmuch elongated, but by measurement, in relation to the length of body, this\r\nis not the case. The beak likewise appears longer, but it is in fact a\r\nlittle shorter (about .O3 of an inch), proportionally with the size of the\r\nbody, and relatively to the beak of the rock-pigeon. The Pouter, though not\r\nbulky, is a large bird; I measured one which was 34 1/2 inches from tip to\r\ntip of wing, and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail. In a wild rock-\r\npigeon from the Shetland Islands the same measurements gave only 28 1/4 and\r\n14 3/4. There are many sub-varieties of the Pouter of different colours,\r\nbut these I pass over.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 1/II. DUTCH POUTER.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the parent-form of our improved English Pouters. I kept a\r\npair, but I suspect that they were not pure birds. They are smaller than\r\nEnglish pouters, and less well developed in all their characters.\r\nNeumeister (5/7. 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht' Weimar 1837 pl. 11 and 12.)\r\nsays that the wings are crossed over the tail, and do not reach to its\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 1/III. THE LILLE POUTER.\r\n\r\nI know this breed only from description. (5/8. Boitard and Corbie 'Les\r\nPigeons' etc. page 177 pl. 6.) It approaches in general form the Dutch\r\nPouter, but the inflated oesophagus assumes a spherical form, as if the\r\npigeon had swallowed a large orange, which had stuck close under the beak.\r\nThis inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the crown of\r\nthe head. The middle toe alone is feathered. A variety of this sub-race,\r\ncalled the claquant, is described by MM. Boitard and Corbie; it pouts but\r\nlittle, and is characterised by the habit of violently hitting its wings\r\ntogether over its back,--a habit which the English Pouter has in a slight\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 1/IV. COMMON GERMAN POUTER.\r\n\r\nI know this bird only from the figures and description given by the\r\naccurate Neumeister, one of the few writers on pigeons who, as I have\r\nfound, may always be trusted. This sub-race seems considerably different.\r\nThe upper part of the oesophagus is much less distended. The bird stands\r\nless upright. The feet are not feathered, and the legs and beak are\r\nshorter. In these respects there is an approach in form to the common rock-\r\npigeon. The tail-feathers are very long, yet the tips of the closed wings\r\nextend beyond the end of the tail; and the length of the wings, from tip to\r\ntip, and of the body, is greater than in the English Pouter.]\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 19. ENGLISH CARRIER.)\r\n\r\nGROUP II.\r\n\r\nThis group includes three Races, namely, Carriers, Runts, and Barbs, which\r\nare manifestly allied to each other. Indeed, certain carriers and runts\r\npass into each other by such insensible gradations that an arbitrary line\r\nhas to be drawn between them. Carriers also graduate through foreign breeds\r\ninto the rock-pigeon. Yet, if well-characterised Carriers and Barbs (see\r\nfigures 19 and 20) had existed as wild species, no ornithologist would have\r\nplaced them in the same genus with each other or with the rock-pigeon. This\r\ngroup may, as a general rule, be recognised by the beak being long, with\r\nthe skin over the nostrils swollen and often carunculated or wattled, and\r\nwith that round the eyes bare and likewise carunculated. The mouth is very\r\nwide, and the feet are large. Nevertheless the Barb, which must be classed\r\nin this same group, has a very short beak, and some runts have very little\r\nbare skin round their eyes.\r\n\r\nRACE II. CARRIERS. (TURKISCHE TAUBEN; PIGEONS TURCS, DRAGONS.)\r\n\r\nBeak elongated, narrow, pointed; eyes surrounded by much naked, generally\r\ncarunculated, skin; neck and body elongated.\r\n\r\n[SUB-RACE 2/I. THE ENGLISH CARRIER.\r\n\r\n[This is a fine bird, of large size, close feathered, generally dark-\r\ncoloured, with an elongated neck. The beak is attenuated and of wonderful\r\nlength: in one specimen it was 1.4 inch in length from the feathered base\r\nto the tip; therefore nearly twice as long as that of the rock-pigeon,\r\nwhich measured only .77. Whenever I compare proportionally any part in the\r\ncarrier and rock-pigeon, I take the length of the body from the base of the\r\nbeak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison; and according to\r\nthis standard, the beak in one Carrier was nearly half an inch longer than\r\nin the rock-pigeon. The upper mandible is often slightly arched. The tongue\r\nis very long. The development of the carunculated skin or wattle round the\r\neyes, over the nostrils, and on the lower mandible, is prodigious. The\r\neyelids, measured longitudinally, were in some specimens exactly twice as\r\nlong as in the rock-pigeon. The external orifice or furrow of the nostrils\r\nwas also twice as long. The open mouth in its widest part was in one case\r\n.75 of an inch in width, whereas in the rock-pigeon it is only about .4 of\r\nan inch. This great width of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed\r\nedges of the ramus of the lower jaw. The head is flat on the summit and\r\nnarrow between the orbits. The feet are large and coarse; the length, as\r\nmeasured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe (without the claws), was\r\nin two specimens 2.6 inches; and this, proportionally with the rock-pigeon,\r\nis an excess of nearly a quarter of an inch. One very fine Carrier measured\r\n31 1/2 inches from tip to tip of wing. Birds of this sub-race are too\r\nvaluable to be flown as carriers.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 2/II. DRAGONS; PERSIAN CARRIERS.\r\n\r\n[The English Dragon differs from the improved English Carrier in being\r\nsmaller in all its dimensions, and in having less wattle round the eyes and\r\nover the nostrils, and none on the lower mandible. Sir W. Elliot sent me\r\nfrom Madras a Bagdad Carrier (sometimes called khandesi), the name of which\r\nshows its Persian origin: it would be considered here a very poor Dragon;\r\nthe body was of the size of the rock-pigeon, with the beak a little longer,\r\nnamely, 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base. The skin round the eyes\r\nwas only slightly wattled, whilst that over the nostrils was fairly\r\nwattled. The Hon. C. Murray, also, sent me two Carriers direct from Persia;\r\nthese had nearly the same character as the Madras bird, being about as\r\nlarge as the rock-pigeon, but the beak in one specimen was as much as 1.15\r\nin length; the skin over the nostrils was only moderately, and that round\r\nthe eyes scarcely at all wattled.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 2/III. BAGADOTTEN-TAUBEN OF NEUMEISTER (PAVDOTTEN- OR HOCKER-\r\nTAUBEN).\r\n\r\n[I owe to the kindness of Mr. Baily, jun., a dead specimen of this singular\r\nbreed imported from Germany. It is certainly allied to the Runts;\r\nnevertheless, from its close affinity with Carriers, it will be convenient\r\nhere to describe it. The beak is long, and is hooked or bowed downwards in\r\na highly remarkable manner, as will be seen in figure 24.D. when I treat of\r\nthe skeleton. The eyes are surrounded by a wide space of bright red skin,\r\nwhich, as well as that over the nostrils, is moderately wattled. The\r\nbreast-bone is remarkably protuberant, being abruptly bowed outwards. The\r\nfeet and tarsi are of great length, larger than in first-rate English\r\nCarriers. The whole bird is of large size, but in proportion to the size of\r\nthe body the feathers of the wing and tail are short; a wild rock-pigeon,\r\nof considerably less size, had tail-feathers 4.6 inches in length, whereas\r\nin the large Bagadotten these feathers were scarcely over 4.1 inches in\r\nlength. Riedel (5/9. 'Die Taubenzucht' Ulm 1824 s. 42.) remarks that it is\r\na very silent bird.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 2/IV. BUSSORAH CARRIER.\r\n\r\n[Two specimens were sent me by Sir W. Elliot from Madras, one in spirits\r\nand the other skinned. The name shows its Persian origin. It is much valued\r\nin India, and is considered as a distinct breed from the Bagdad Carrier,\r\nwhich forms my second sub-race. At first I suspected that these two sub-\r\nraces might have been recently formed by crosses with other breeds, though\r\nthe estimation in which they are held renders this improbable; but in a\r\nPersian treatise (5/10. This treatise was written by Sayzid Mohammed\r\nMusari, who died in 1770: I owe to the great kindness of Sir W. Elliot a\r\ntranslation of this curious treatise.), believed to have been written about\r\n100 years ago, the Bagdad and Bussorah breeds are described as distinct.\r\nThe Bussorah Carrier is of about the same size as the wild rock-pigeon. The\r\nshape of the beak, with some little carunculated skin over the nostrils,--\r\nthe much elongated eyelids,--the broad mouth measured internally,--the\r\nnarrow head,--the feet proportionally a little longer than in the rock-\r\npigeon,--and the general appearance, all show that this bird is an\r\nundoubted Carrier; yet in one specimen the beak was of exactly the same\r\nlength as in the rock-pigeon. In the other specimen the beak (as well as\r\nthe opening of the nostrils) was only a very little longer, viz., by .08 of\r\nan inch. Although there was a considerable space of bare and slightly\r\ncarunculated skin round the eyes, that over the nostrils was only in a\r\nslight degree rugose. Sir W. Elliot informs me that in the living bird the\r\neye seems remarkably large and prominent, and the same fact is noticed in\r\nthe Persian treatise; but the bony orbit is barely larger than that in the\r\nrock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nAmongst the several breeds sent to me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot there is\r\na pair of the Kali Par, black birds with the beak slightly elongated, with\r\nthe skin over the nostrils rather full, and with a little naked skin round\r\nthe eyes. This breed seems more closely allied to the Carrier than to any\r\nother breed, being nearly intermediate between the Bussorah Carrier and the\r\nrock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe names applied in different parts of Europe and in India to the several\r\nkinds of Carriers all point to Persia or the surrounding countries as the\r\nsource of this Race. And it deserves especial notice that, even if we\r\nneglect the Kali Par as of doubtful origin, we get a series broken by very\r\nsmall steps, from the rock-pigeon, through the Bussorah, which sometimes\r\nhas a beak not at all longer than that of the rock-pigeon and with the\r\nnaked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils very slightly swollen and\r\ncarunculated, through the Bagdad sub-race and Dragons, to our improved\r\nEnglish Carriers, which present so marvellous a difference from the rock-\r\npigeon or Columba livia.]\r\n\r\nRACE III. RUNTS. (SCANDEROONS: DIE FLORENTINER TAUBEN AND HINKELTAUBEN OF\r\nNEUMEISTER; PIGEON BAGADAIS, PIGEON ROMAIN.)\r\n\r\nBeak long, massive; body of great size.\r\n\r\n[Inextricable confusion reigns in the classification, affinities, and\r\nnaming of Runts. Several characters which are generally pretty constant in\r\nother pigeons, such as the length of the wings, tail, legs, and neck, and\r\nthe amount of naked skin round the eyes, are excessively variable in Runts.\r\nWhen the naked skin over the nostrils and round the eyes is considerably\r\ndeveloped and wattled, and when the size of body is not very great, Runts\r\ngraduate in so insensible a manner into Carriers, that the distinction is\r\nquite arbitrary. This fact is likewise shown by the names given to them in\r\ndifferent parts of Europe. Nevertheless, taking the most distinct forms, at\r\nleast five sub-races (some of them including well-marked varieties) can be\r\ndistinguished, which differ in such important points of structure, that\r\nthey would be considered as good species in a state of nature.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 3/I. SCANDEROON OF ENGLISH WRITERS (DIE FLORENTINER AND\r\nHINKELTAUBEN OF NEUMEISTER).\r\n\r\n[Birds of this sub-race, of which I kept one alive and have since seen two\r\nothers, differ from the Bagadotten of Neumeister only in not having the\r\nbeak nearly so much curved downwards, and in the naked skin round the eyes\r\nand over the nostrils being hardly at all wattled. Nevertheless I have felt\r\nmyself compelled to place the Bagadotten in Race II., or that of the\r\nCarriers, and the present bird in Race III., or that of the Runts. The\r\nScanderoon has a very short, narrow, and elevated tail; wings extremely\r\nshort, so that the first primary feathers were not longer than those of a\r\nsmall tumbler pigeon! Neck long, much bowed; breast-bone prominent. Beak\r\nlong, being 1.15 inch from tip to feathered base; vertically thick;\r\nslightly curved downwards. The skin over the nostrils swollen, not wattled;\r\nnaked skin round the eyes, broad, slightly carunculated. Legs long; feet\r\nvery large. Skin of neck bright red, often showing a naked medial line,\r\nwith a naked red patch at the distal end of the radius of the wing. My\r\nbird, as measured from the base of the beak to the root of the tail, was\r\nfully 2 inches longer than the rock-pigeon; yet the tail itself was only 4\r\ninches in length, whereas in the rock-pigeon, which is a much smaller bird,\r\nthe tail is 4 5/8 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe Hinkel- or Florentiner Taube of Neumeister (Table 13 figure 1) agrees\r\nwith the above description in all the specified characters (for the beak is\r\nnot mentioned), except that Neumeister expressly says that the neck is\r\nshort, whereas in my Scanderoon it was remarkably long and bowed; so that\r\nthe Hinkel forms a well-marked variety.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 3/II. PIGEON CYGNE AND PIGEON BAGADAIS OF BOITARD AND CORBIE\r\n(SCANDEROON OF FRENCH WRITERS).\r\n\r\n[I kept two of these birds alive, imported from France. They differed from\r\nthe first sub-race or true Scanderoon in the much greater length of the\r\nwing and tail, in the beak not being so long, and in the skin about the\r\nhead being more carunculated. The skin of the neck is red; but the naked\r\npatches on the wings are absent. One of my birds measured 38 1/2 inches\r\nfrom tip to tip of wing. By taking the length of the body as the standard\r\nof comparison, the two wings were no less than 5 inches longer than those\r\nof the rock-pigeon! The tail was 6 1/4 inches in length, and therefore 2\r\n1/4 inches longer than that of the Scanderoon,--a bird of nearly the same\r\nsize. The beak is longer, thicker, and broader than in the rock-pigeon,\r\nproportionally with the size of body. The eyelids, nostrils, and internal\r\ngape of mouth are all proportionally very large, as in Carriers. The foot,\r\nfrom the end of the middle to end of hind toe, was actually 2.85 inches in\r\nlength, which is an excess of .32 of an inch over the foot of the rock-\r\npigeon, proportionally to the relative size of the two birds.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 3/III. SPANISH AND ROMAN RUNTS.\r\n\r\n[I am not sure that I am right in placing these Runts in a distinct sub-\r\nrace; yet, if we take well-characterised birds, there can be no doubt of\r\nthe propriety of the separation. They are heavy, massive birds, with\r\nshorter necks, legs, and beaks than in the foregoing races. The skin over\r\nthe nostrils is swollen, but not carunculated; the naked skin round the\r\neyes is not very wide, and only slightly carunculated; and I have seen a\r\nfine so-called Spanish Runt with hardly any naked skin round the eyes. Of\r\nthe two varieties to be seen in England, one, which is the rarer, has very\r\nlong wings and tail, and agrees pretty closely with the last sub-race; the\r\nother, with shorter wings and tail, is apparently the Pigeon romain\r\nordinaire of Boitard and Corbie. These Runts are apt to tremble like\r\nFantails. They are bad flyers. A few years ago Mr. Gulliver (5/11. 'Poultry\r\nChronicle' volume 2 page 573.) exhibited a Runt which weighed 1 pound 14\r\nounces; and, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, two Runts from the south\r\nof France were lately exhibited at the Crystal Palace, each of which\r\nweighed 2 pounds 2 1/2 ounces. A very fine rock-pigeon from the Shetland\r\nIslands weighed only 14 1/2 ounces.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 3/IV. TRONFO OF ALDROVANDI (LEGHORN RUNT?).\r\n\r\n[In Aldrovandi's work published in 1600 there is a coarse woodcut of a\r\ngreat Italian pigeon, with an elevated tail, short legs, massive body, and\r\nwith the beak short and thick. I had imagined that this latter character so\r\nabnormal in the group, was merely a false representation from bad drawing;\r\nbut Moore, in his work published in 1735, says that he possessed a Leghorn\r\nRunt of which \"the beak was very short for so large a bird.\" In other\r\nrespects Moore's bird resembled the first sub-race or Scanderoon, for it\r\nhad a long bowed neck, long legs, short beak, and elevated tail, and not\r\nmuch wattle about the head. So that Aldrovandi's and Moore's birds must\r\nhave formed distinct varieties, both of which seem to be now extinct in\r\nEurope. Sir W. Elliot, however, informs me that he has seen in Madras a\r\nshort-beaked Runt imported from Cairo.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 3/V. MURASSA (ADORNED PIGEON) OF MADRAS.\r\n\r\n[Skins of these handsome chequered birds were sent me from Madras by Sir W.\r\nElliot. They are rather larger than the largest rock-pigeon, with longer\r\nand more massive beaks. The skin over the nostrils is rather full and very\r\nslightly carunculated, and they have some naked skin round the eyes; feet\r\nlarge. This breed is intermediate between the rock-pigeon and a very poor\r\nvariety of Runt or Carrier.\r\n\r\nFrom these several descriptions we see that with Runts, as with Carriers,\r\nwe have a fine gradation from the rock-pigeon (with the Tronfo diverging as\r\na distinct branch) to our largest and most massive Runts. But the chain of\r\naffinities, and many points of resemblance, between Runts and carriers,\r\nmake me believe that these two races have not descended by independent\r\nlines from the rock-pigeon, but from some common parent, as represented in\r\nthe Table, which had already acquired a moderately long beak with slightly\r\nswollen skin over the nostrils, and with some slightly carunculated naked\r\nskin round the eyes.]\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 20. ENGLISH BARB.)\r\n\r\nRACE IV. BARBS. (INDISCHE TAUBEN; PIGEONS POLONAIS.)\r\n\r\nBeak short, broad, deep; naked skin round the eyes, broad and carunculated;\r\nskin over nostrils slightly swollen.\r\n\r\n[Misled by the extraordinary shortness and form of the beak, I did not at\r\nfirst perceive the near affinity of this Race to that of Carriers until the\r\nfact was pointed out to me by Mr. Brent. Subsequently, after examining the\r\nBussorah Carrier, I saw that no very great amount of modification would be\r\nrequisite to convert it into a Barb. This view of the affinity of Barbs to\r\nCarriers is supported by the analogical difference between the short and\r\nlong-beaked Runts; and still more strongly by the fact, that, young Barbs\r\nand Dragons, within 24 hours after being hatched, resemble each other much\r\nmore closely than do young pigeons of other and equally distinct breeds. At\r\nthis early age, the length of beak, the swollen skin over the rather open\r\nnostrils, the gape of the mouth, and the size of the feet, are the same in\r\nboth; although these parts afterwards become widely different. We thus see\r\nthat embryology (as the comparison of very young animals may perhaps be\r\ncalled) comes into play in the classification of domestic varieties, as\r\nwith species in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nFanciers, with some truth, compare the head and beak of the Barb to that of\r\na bullfinch. The Barb, if found in a state of nature would certainly have\r\nbeen placed in a new genus formed for its reception. The body is a little\r\nlarger than that of the rock-pigeon, but the beak is more than .2 of an\r\ninch shorter; although shorter, it is both vertically and horizontally\r\nthicker. From the outward flexure of the rami of the lower jaw, the mouth\r\ninternally is very broad, in the proportion of .6 to .4 to that of the\r\nrock-pigeon. The whole head is broad. The skin over the nostril is swollen,\r\nbut not carunculated, except slightly in first-rate birds when old; whilst\r\nthe naked skin round the eye is broad and much carunculated. It is\r\nsometimes so much developed, that a bird belonging to Mr. Harrison Weir\r\ncould hardly see to pick up food from the ground. The eyelids in one\r\nspecimen were nearly twice as long as those of the rock-pigeon. The feet\r\nare coarse and strong, but proportionally rather shorter than in the rock-\r\npigeon. The plumage is generally dark and uniform. Barbs, in short, may be\r\ncalled short-beaked Carriers, bearing the same relation to Carriers that\r\nthe Tronfo of Aldrovandi does to the common Runt.]\r\n\r\nGROUP III.\r\n\r\nThis group is artificial, and includes a heterogeneous collection of\r\ndistinct forms. It may be defined by the beak, in well-characterised\r\nspecimens of the several races, being shorter than in the rock-pigeon, and\r\nby the skin round the eyes not being much developed.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 21. ENGLISH FANTAIL.)\r\n\r\nRACE V.-FANTAILS.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 5/I. EUROPEAN FANTAILS (PFAUENTAUBEN; TREMBLEURS).\r\n\r\nTail expanded, directed upwards, formed of many feathers; oil-gland\r\naborted; body and beak rather short.\r\n\r\n[The normal number of tail-feathers in the genus Columba is 12; but\r\nFantails have from only 12 (as has been asserted) up to, according to MM.\r\nBoitard and Corbie, 42. I have counted in one of my own birds 33, and at\r\nCalcutta Mr. Blyth (5/12. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. History' volume 19 1847\r\npage 105.) has counted in an IMPERFECT tail 34 feathers. In Madras, as I am\r\ninformed by Sir W. Elliot, 32 is the standard number; but in England number\r\nis much less valued than the position and expansion of the tail. The\r\nfeathers are arranged in an irregular double row; their permanent fanlike\r\nexpansion and their upward direction are more remarkable characters than\r\ntheir increased number. The tail is capable of the same movements as in\r\nother pigeons, and can be depressed so as to sweep the ground. It arises\r\nfrom a more expanded basis than in other pigeons; and in three skeletons\r\nthere were one or two extra coccygeal vertebrae. I have examined many\r\nspecimens of various colours from different countries, and there was no\r\ntrace of the oil-gland; this is a curious case of abortion. (5/13. This\r\ngland occurs in most birds; but Nitzsch (in his 'Pterylographie' 1840 page\r\n55) states that it is absent in two species of Columba, in several species\r\nof Psittacus, in some species of Otis, and in most or all birds of the\r\nOstrich family. It can hardly be an accidental coincidence that the two\r\nspecies of Columba, which are destitute of an oil-gland, have an unusual\r\nnumber of tail-feathers, namely 16, and in this respect resemble Fantails.)\r\nThe neck is thin and bowed backwards. The breast is broad and protuberant.\r\nThe feet are small. The carriage of the bird is very different from that of\r\nother pigeons; in good birds the head touches the tail-feathers, which\r\nconsequently often become crumpled. They habitually tremble much: and their\r\nnecks have an extraordinary, apparently convulsive, backward and forward\r\nmovement. Good birds walk in a singular manner, as if their small feet were\r\nstiff. Owing to their large tails, they fly badly on a windy day. The dark-\r\ncoloured varieties are generally larger than white Fantails.\r\n\r\nAlthough between the best and common Fantails, now existing in England,\r\nthere is a vast difference in the position and size of the tail, in the\r\ncarriage of the head and neck, in the convulsive movements of the neck, in\r\nthe manner of walking, and in the breadth of the breast, the differences so\r\ngraduate away, that it is impossible to make more than one sub-race. Moore,\r\nhowever, an excellent old authority (5/14. See the two excellent editions\r\npublished by Mr. J.M. Eaton in 1852 and 1858 entitled 'A Treatise on Fancy\r\nPigeons.') says, that in 1735 there were two sorts of broad-tailed shakers\r\n(i.e. Fantails), \"one having a neck much longer and more slender than the\r\nother;\" and I am informed by Mr. B.P. Brent, that there is an existing\r\nGerman Fantail with a thicker and shorter beak.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 5/II. JAVA FANTAIL.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Swinhoe sent me from Amoy, in China, the skin of a Fantail belonging\r\nto a breed known to have been imported from Java. It was coloured in a\r\npeculiar manner, unlike any European Fantail; and, for a Fantail, had a\r\nremarkably short beak. Although a good bird of the kind, it had only 14\r\ntail-feathers; but Mr. Swinhoe has counted in other birds of this breed\r\nfrom 18 to 24 tail-feathers. From a rough sketch sent to me, it is evident\r\nthat the tail is not so much expanded or so much upraised as in even\r\nsecond-rate European Fantails. The bird shakes its neck like our Fantails.\r\nIt had a well-developed oil-gland. Fantails were known in India, as We\r\nshall hereafter see, before the year 1600; and we may suspect that in the\r\nJava Fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less improved condition.]\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 22. AFRICAN OWL.)\r\n\r\nRACE VI. TURBIT AND OWL. (MOVENTAUBEN; PIGEONS A CRAVATE.)\r\n\r\nFeathers divergent along the front of the neck and breast; beak very short,\r\nvertically rather thick; oesophagus somewhat enlarged.\r\n\r\nTurbits and Owls differ from each other slightly in the shape of the head;\r\nthe former have a crest, and the beak is differently curved; but they may\r\nbe here conveniently grouped together. These pretty birds, some of which\r\nare very small, can be recognised at once by the feathers irregularly\r\ndiverging, like a frill, along the front of the neck, in the same manner,\r\nbut in a less degree, as along the back of the neck in the Jacobin. They\r\nhave the remarkable habit of continually and momentarily inflating the\r\nupper part of the oesophagus, which causes a movement in the frill. When\r\nthe oesophagus of a dead bird is inflated, it is seen to be larger than in\r\nother breeds, and not so distinctly separated from the crop. The Pouter\r\ninflates both its true crop and oesophagus; the Turbit inflates in a much\r\nless degree the oesophagus alone. The beak of the Turbit is very short,\r\nbeing .28 of an inch shorter than that of the rock-pigeon, proportionally\r\nwith the size of their bodies; and in some owls brought by Mr. E. Vernon\r\nHarcourt from Tunis, it was even shorter. The beak is vertically thicker,\r\nand perhaps a little broader, in proportion to that of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nRACE VII. TUMBLERS. (TUMMLER, OR BURZELTAUBEN; CULBUTANTS.)\r\n\r\nDuring flight, tumble backwards; body generally small; beak generally\r\nshort, sometimes excessively short and conical.\r\n\r\nThis race may be divided into four sub-races, namely, Persian, Lotan,\r\nCommon, and short-faced Tumblers. These sub-races include many varieties\r\nwhich breed true. I have examined eight skeletons of various kinds of\r\nTumblers: excepting in one imperfect and doubtful specimen, the ribs are\r\nonly seven in number, whereas the rock-pigeon has eight ribs.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 7/I. PERSIAN TUMBLERS.\r\n\r\nI received a pair direct from Persia, from the Hon. C. Murray. They are\r\nrather smaller birds than the wild rock-pigeon, about the size of the\r\ncommon dovecote pigeon, white and mottled, slightly feathered on the feet,\r\nwith the beak just perceptibly shorter than in the rock-pigeon. H.M.\r\nConsul, Mr. Keith Abbott, informs me that the difference in the length of\r\nbeak is so slight, that only practised Persian fanciers can distinguish\r\nthese Tumblers from the common pigeon of the country. He informs me that\r\nthey fly in flocks high up in the air and tumble well. Some of them\r\noccasionally appear to become giddy and tumble to the ground, in which\r\nrespect they resemble some of our Tumblers.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 7/II. LOTAN, OR LOWTUN: INDIAN GROUND TUMBLERS.\r\n\r\nThese birds present one of the most remarkable inherited habits or\r\ninstincts ever recorded. The specimens sent to me from Madras by Sir W.\r\nElliot are white, slightly feathered on the feet, with the feathers on the\r\nhead reversed; and they are rather smaller than the rock or dovecote\r\npigeon. The beak is proportionally only slightly shorter and rather thinner\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon. These birds when gently shaken and placed on the\r\nground immediately begin tumbling head over heels, and they continue thus\r\nto tumble until taken up and soothed,--the ceremony being generally to blow\r\nin their faces, as in recovering a person from a state of hypnotism or\r\nmesmerism. It is asserted that they will continue to roll over till they\r\ndie, if not taken up. There is abundant evidence with respect to these\r\nremarkable peculiarities; but what makes the case the more worthy of\r\nattention is, that the habit has been inherited since before the year 1600,\r\nfor the breed is distinctly described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.' (5/15. English\r\ntranslation by F. Gladwin 4th edition volume 1. The habit of the Lotan is\r\nalso described in the Persian treatise before alluded to, published about\r\n100 years ago: at this date the Lotans were generally white and crested as\r\nat present. Mr. Blyth describes these birds in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.' volume 14 1847 page 104; he says that they \"may be seen at any of\r\nthe Calcutta bird-dealers.\") Mr. Evans kept a pair in London, imported by\r\nCaptain Vigne; and he assures me that he has seen them tumble in the air,\r\nas well as in the manner above described on the ground. Sir W. Elliot,\r\nhowever, writes to me from Madras, that he is informed that they tumble\r\nexclusively on the ground, or at a very small height above it. He also\r\nmentions birds of another sub-variety, called the Kalmi Lotan, which begin\r\nto roll over if only touched on the neck with a rod or wand.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 7/III. COMMON ENGLISH TUMBLERS.\r\n\r\nThese birds have exactly the same habits as the Persian Tumbler, but tumble\r\nbetter. The English bird is rather smaller than the Persian, and the beak\r\nis plainly shorter. Compared with the rock-pigeon, and proportionally with\r\nthe size of body, the beak is from .15 to nearly .2 of an inch shorter, but\r\nit is not thinner. There are several varieties of the common Tumbler,\r\nnamely, Baldheads, Beards, and Dutch Rollers. I have kept the latter alive;\r\nthey have differently shaped heads, longer necks, and are feather-footed.\r\nThey tumble to an extraordinary degree; as Mr. Brent remarks (5/16.\r\n'Journal of Horticulture' October 22, 1861 page 76.), \"Every few seconds\r\nover they go; one, two, or three summersaults at a time. Here and there a\r\nbird gives a very quick and rapid spin, revolving like a wheel, though they\r\nsometimes lose their balance, and make a rather ungraceful fall, in which\r\nthey occasionally hurt themselves by striking some object.\" From Madras I\r\nhave received several specimens of the common Tumbler of India, differing\r\nslightly from each other in the length of their beaks. Mr. Brent sent me a\r\ndead specimen of a \"House-tumbler\" (5/17. See the account of the House-\r\ntumblers kept at Glasgow, in the 'Cottage Gardener' 1858 page 285. Also Mr.\r\nBrent's paper 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 76.), which is a Scotch\r\nvariety, not differing in general appearance and form of beak from the\r\ncommon Tumbler. Mr. Brent states that these birds generally begin to tumble\r\n\"almost as soon as they can well fly; at three months old they tumble well,\r\nbut still fly strong; at five or six months they tumble excessively; and in\r\nthe second year they mostly give up flying, on account of their tumbling so\r\nmuch and so close to the ground. Some fly round with the flock, throwing a\r\nclean summersault every few yards, till they are obliged to settle from\r\ngiddiness and exhaustion. These are called Air Tumblers, and they commonly\r\nthrow from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute, each clear and clean.\r\nI have one red cock that I have on two or three occasions timed by my\r\nwatch, and counted forty summersaults in the minute. Others tumble\r\ndifferently. At first they throw a single summersault, then it is double,\r\ntill it becomes a continuous roll, which puts an end to flying, for if they\r\nfly a few yards over they go, and roll till they reach the ground. Thus I\r\nhad one kill herself, and another broke his leg. Many of them turn over\r\nonly a few inches from the ground, and will tumble two or three times in\r\nflying across their loft. These are called House-tumblers, from tumbling in\r\nthe house. The act of tumbling seems to be one over which they have no\r\ncontrol, an involuntary movement which they seem to try to prevent. I have\r\nseen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard or two straight upwards,\r\nthe impulse forcing him backwards while he struggles to go forwards. If\r\nsuddenly startled, or in a strange place, they seem less able to fly than\r\nif quiet in their accustomed loft.\" These House-tumblers differ from the\r\nLotan or Ground Tumbler of India, in not requiring to be shaken in order to\r\nbegin tumbling. The breed has probably been formed merely by selecting the\r\nbest common Tumblers, though it is possible that they may have been crossed\r\nat some former period with Lotans.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 23. SHORT-FACED ENGLISH TUMBLER.)\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 7/1V. SHORT-FACED TUMBLERS\r\n\r\nThese are marvellous birds, and are the glory and pride of many fanciers.\r\nIn their extremely short, sharp, and conical beaks, with the skin over the\r\nnostrils but little developed, they almost depart from the type of the\r\nColumbidae. Their heads are nearly globular and upright in front, so that\r\nsome fanciers say (5/18. J.M. Eaton 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1852 page 9.)\r\n\"the head should resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it.\" These\r\nare the smallest kind of pigeons. Mr. Esquilant possessed a blue Baldhead,\r\ntwo years old, which when alive weighed, before feeding-time, only 6 ounces\r\n5 drs.; two others, each weighed 7 ounces. We have seen that a wild rock-\r\npigeon weighed 14 ounces 2 drs., and a Runt 34 ounces 4 drs. Short-faced\r\nTumblers have a remarkably erect carriage, with prominent breasts, drooping\r\nwings, and very small feet. The length of the beak from the tip to the\r\nfeathered base was in one good bird only .4 of an inch; in a wild rock-\r\npigeon it was exactly double this length. As these Tumblers have shorter\r\nbodies than the wild rock-pigeon, they ought of course to have shorter\r\nbeaks; but proportionally with the size of the body, the beak is .28 of an\r\ninch too short. So, again, the feet of this bird were actually .45 shorter,\r\nand proportionally .21 of an inch shorter, than the feet of the rock-\r\npigeon. The middle toe has only twelve or thirteen, instead of fourteen or\r\nfifteen scutellae. The primary wing-feathers are not rarely nine instead of\r\nten in number. The improved short-faced Tumblers have almost lost the power\r\nof tumbling; but there are several authentic accounts of their occasionally\r\ntumbling. There are several sub-varieties, such as Bald-heads, Beards,\r\nMottles, and Almonds; the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their\r\nperfectly-coloured plumage until they have moulted three or four times.\r\nThere is good reason to believe that most of these sub-varieties, some of\r\nwhich breed truly, have arisen since the publication of Moore's treatise in\r\n1735. (5/19. J.M. Eaton 'Treatise' edition 1858 page 76.)\r\n\r\nFinally, in regard to the whole group of Tumblers, it is impossible to\r\nconceive a more perfect gradation than I have now lying before me, from the\r\nrock-pigeon, through Persian, Lotan, and common Tumblers, up to the\r\nmarvellous short-faced birds; which latter, no ornithologist, judging from\r\nmere external structure, would place in the same genus with the rock-\r\npigeon. The differences between the successive steps in this series are not\r\ngreater than those which may be observed between common dovecote-pigeons\r\n(C. livia) brought from different countries.]\r\n\r\nRACE VIII. INDIAN FRILL-BACK.\r\n\r\nBeak very short; feathers reversed.\r\n\r\n[A specimen of this bird, in spirits, was sent to me from Madras by Sir W.\r\nElliot. It is wholly different from the Frill-back often exhibited in\r\nEngland. It is a smallish bird, about the size of the common Tumbler, but\r\nhas a beak in all its proportions like our short-faced Tumblers. The beak,\r\nmeasured from the tip to the feathered base, was only .46 of an inch in\r\nlength. The feathers over the whole body are reversed or curl backwards.\r\nHad this bird occurred in Europe, I should have thought it only a monstrous\r\nvariety of our improved Tumbler: but as short-faced Tumblers are not known\r\nin India, I think it must rank as a distinct breed. Probably this is the\r\nbreed seen by Hasselquist in 1757 at Cairo, and said to have been imported\r\nfrom India.]\r\n\r\nRACE IX. JACOBIN. (ZOPF- OR PERRFICKENTAUBE; NONNAIN.)\r\n\r\nFeathers of the neck forming a hood; wings and tail long; beak moderately\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n[This pigeon can at once be recognised by its hood, almost enclosing the\r\nhead and meeting in front of the neck. The hood seems to be merely an\r\nexaggeration of the crest of reversed feathers on the back of the head,\r\nwhich is common to many sub-varieties, and which in the Latztaube (5/20.\r\nNeumeister 'Taubenzucht' tab. 4. figure 1.) is in a nearly intermediate\r\nstate between a hood and a crest. The feathers of the hood are elongated.\r\nBoth the wings and tail are likewise much elongated; thus the folded wing\r\nof the Jacobin, though a somewhat smaller bird, is fully 1 1/4 inch longer\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon. Taking the length of the body without the tail as\r\nthe standard of comparison, the folded wing, proportionally with the wings\r\nof the rock-pigeon, is 2 1/4 inches too long, and the two wings, from tip\r\nto tip, 5 1/4 inches too long. In disposition this bird is singularly\r\nquiet, seldom flying or moving about, as Bechstein and Riedel have likewise\r\nremarked in Germany. (5/21. Riedel 'Die Taubenzucht' 1824 s. 26. Bechstein\r\n'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 4 s. 36 1795) The latter author also\r\nnotices the length of the wings and tail. The beak is nearly .2 of an inch\r\nshorter in proportion to the size of the body than in the rock-pigeon; but\r\nthe internal gape of the mouth is considerably wider.]\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.\r\n\r\nThe birds of this group may be characterised by their resemblance in all\r\nimportant points of structure, especially in the beak, to the rock-pigeon.\r\nThe Trumpeter forms the only well-marked race. Of the numerous other sub-\r\nraces and varieties I shall specify only a few of the most distinct, which\r\nI have myself seen and kept alive.\r\n\r\nRACE X. TRUMPETER. (TROMMELTAUBE; PIGEON TAMBOUR, GLOUGLOU.)\r\n\r\nA tuft of feathers at the base of the beak curling forward; feet much\r\nfeathered; voice very peculiar; size exceeding that of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n[This is a well-marked breed, with a peculiar voice, wholly unlike that of\r\nany other pigeon. The coo is rapidly repeated, and is continued for several\r\nminutes; hence their name of Trumpeters. They are also characterised by a\r\ntuft of elongated feathers, which curls forward over the base of the beak,\r\nand which is possessed by no other breed. Their feet are so heavily\r\nfeathered, that they almost appear like little wings. They are larger birds\r\nthan the rock-pigeon, but their beak is of very nearly the same\r\nproportional size. Their feet are rather small. This breed was perfectly\r\ncharacterised in Moore's time, in 1735. Mr. Brent says that two varieties\r\nexist, which differ in size.]\r\n\r\nRACE XI. SCARCELY DIFFERING IN STRUCTURE FROM THE WILD COLUMBA LIVIA.\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 11/I. LAUGHERS.\r\n\r\nSize less than the Rock-pigeon; voice very peculiar.\r\n\r\n[As this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the rock-pigeon,\r\nthough of smaller size, I should not have thought it worthy of mention, had\r\nit not been for its peculiar voice--a character supposed seldom to vary\r\nwith birds. Although the voice of the Laugher is very different from that\r\nof the Trumpeter, yet one of my Trumpeters used to utter a single note like\r\nthat of the Laugher. I have kept two varieties of Laughers, which differed\r\nonly in one variety being turn-crowned; the smooth-headed kind, for which I\r\nam indebted to the kindness of Mr. Brent, besides its peculiar note, used\r\nto coo in a singular and pleasing manner, which, independently, struck both\r\nMr. Brent and myself as resembling that of the turtle-dove. Both varieties\r\ncome from Arabia. This breed was known by Moore in 1735. A pigeon which\r\nseems to say Yak-roo is mentioned in 1600 in the 'Ayeen Akbery' and is\r\nprobably the same breed. Sir W. Elliot has also sent me from Madras a\r\npigeon called Yahui, said to have come from Mecca, which does not differ in\r\nappearance from the Laugher; it has \"a deep melancholy voice, like Yahu,\r\noften repeated.\" Yahu, yahu, means Oh God, oh God; and Sayzid Mohammed\r\nMusari, in the treatise written about 100 years ago, says that these birds\r\n\"are not flown, because they repeat the name of the most high God.\" Mr.\r\nKeith Abbott, however, informs me that the common pigeon is called Yahoo in\r\nPersia.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 11/II. COMMON FRILL-BACK (DIE STRUPPTAUBE).\r\n\r\nBeak rather longer than in the rock-pigeon; feathers reversed .\r\n\r\n[This is a considerably larger bird than the rock-pigeon, and with the\r\nbeak, proportionally with the size of body, a little (viz. by .04 of an\r\ninch) longer. The feathers, especially on the wing-coverts, have their\r\npoints curled upwards or back-wards.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 11/III. NUNS (PIGEONS COQUILLES).\r\n\r\n[These elegant birds are smaller than the rock-pigeon. The beak is actually\r\n1.7, and proportionally with the size of the body .1 of an inch shorter\r\nthan in the rock-pigeons, although of the same thickness. In young birds\r\nthe scutellae on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black colour;\r\nand this is a remarkable character (though observed in a lesser degree in\r\nsome other breeds), as the colour of the legs in the adult state is subject\r\nto very little variation in any breed. I have on two or three occasions\r\ncounted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail; this likewise occurs in\r\nthe barely distinct breed called Helmets. Nuns are symmetrically coloured,\r\nwith the head, primary wing-feathers, tail, and tail-coverts of the same\r\ncolour, namely, black or red, and with the rest of the body white. This\r\nbreed has retained the same character since Aldrovandi wrote in 1600. I\r\nhave received from Madras almost similarly coloured birds.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 11/IV. SPOTS (DIE BLASSTAUBEN; PIGEONS HEURTES).\r\n\r\n[These birds are a very little larger than the rock-pigeon, with the beak a\r\ntrace smaller in all its dimensions, and with the feet decidedly smaller.\r\nThey are symmetrically coloured, with a spot on the forehead, with the tail\r\nand tail-coverts of the same colour, the rest of the body being white. This\r\nbreed existed in 1676 (5/22. Willughby 'Ornithology' edited by Ray.); and\r\nin 1735 Moore remarks that they breed truly, as is the case at the present\r\nday.]\r\n\r\nSUB-RACE 11/V. SWALLOWS.\r\n\r\n[These birds, as measured from tip to tip of wing, or from the end of the\r\nbeak to the end of the tail, exceed in size the rock-pigeon; but their\r\nbodies are much less bulky; their feet and legs are likewise smaller. The\r\nbeak is of about the same length, but rather slighter. Altogether their\r\ngeneral appearance is considerably different from that of the rock-pigeon.\r\nTheir heads and wings are of the same colour, the rest of the body being\r\nwhite. Their flight is said to be peculiar. This seems to be a modern\r\nbreed, which, however, originated before the year 1795 in Germany, for it\r\nis described by Bechstein.\r\n\r\nBesides the several breeds now described, three or four other very distinct\r\nkinds existed lately, or perhaps still exist, in Germany and France.\r\nFirstly, the Karmeliten, or carme pigeon, which I have not seen; it is\r\ndescribed as of small size, with very short legs, and with an extremely\r\nshort beak. Secondly, the Finnikin, which is now extinct in England. It\r\nhad, according to Moore's (5/23. J.M. Eaton's edition (1858) of Moore page\r\n98.) treatise, published in 1735, a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of\r\nthe head, which ran down its back not unlike a horse's mane. \"When it is\r\nsalacious it rises over the hen and turns round three or four times,\r\nflapping its wings, then reverses and turns as many times the other way.\"\r\nThe Turner, on the other hand, when it \"plays to the female, turns only one\r\nway.\" Whether these extraordinary statements may be trusted I know not; but\r\nthe inheritance of any habit may be believed, after what we have seen with\r\nrespect to the Ground-tumbler of India. MM. Boitard and Corbie describe a\r\npigeon (5/24. Pigeon pattu plongeur. 'Les Pigeons' etc. page 165.) which\r\nhas the singular habit of sailing for a considerable time through the air,\r\nwithout flapping its wings, like a bird of prey. The confusion is\r\ninextricable, from the time of Aldrovandi in 1600 to the present day, in\r\nthe accounts published of the Draijers, Smiters, Finnikins, Turners,\r\nClaquers, etc., which are all remarkable from their manner of flight. Mr.\r\nBrent informs me that he has seen one of these breeds in Germany with its\r\nwing-feathers injured from having been so often struck together but he did\r\nnot see it flying. An old stuffed specimen of a Finnikin in the British\r\nMuseum presents no well-marked character. Thirdly, a singular pigeon with a\r\nforked tail is mentioned in some treatises; and as Bechstein (5/25.\r\n'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 4 s. 47.) briefly describes and figures\r\nthis bird, with a tail \"having completely the structure of that of the\r\nhouse-swallow,\" it must once have existed, for Bechstein was far too good a\r\nnaturalist to have confounded any distinct species with the domestic\r\npigeon. Lastly, an extraordinary pigeon imported from Belgium has lately\r\nbeen exhibited at the Philoperisteron Society in London (5/26. Mr. W.B.\r\nTegetmeier 'Journal of Horticulture' January 20, 1863 page 58.), which\r\n\"conjoins the colour of an archangel with the head of an owl or barb, its\r\nmost striking peculiarity being the extraordinary length of the tail and\r\nwing-feathers, the latter crossing beyond the tail, and giving to the bird\r\nthe appearance of a gigantic swift (Cypselus), or long-winged hawk.\" Mr.\r\nTegetmeier informs me that this bird weighed only 10 ounces, but in length\r\nwas 15 1/2 inches from tip to beak to end of tail, and 32 1/2 inches from\r\ntip to tip of wing; now the wild rock-pigeon weighs 14 1/2 ounces, and\r\nmeasures from tip to beak to end of tail 15 inches, and from tip to tip of\r\nwing only 26 3/4 inches.]\r\n\r\nI have now described all the domestic pigeons known to me, and have added a\r\nfew others on reliable authority. I have classed them under four Groups, in\r\norder to mark their affinities and degrees of difference; but the third\r\ngroup is artificial. The kinds examined by me form eleven races, which\r\ninclude several sub-races; and even these latter present differences that\r\nwould certainly have been thought of specific value if observed in a state\r\nof nature. The sub-races likewise include many strictly inherited\r\nvarieties; so that altogether there must exist, as previously remarked,\r\nabove 150 kinds which can be distinguished, though generally by characters\r\nof extremely slight importance. Many of the genera of the Columbidae,\r\nadmitted by ornithologists, do not differ in any great degree from each\r\nother; taking this into consideration, there can be no doubt that several\r\nof the most strongly characterised domestic forms, if found wild, would\r\nhave been placed in at least five new genera. Thus a new genus would have\r\nbeen formed for the reception of the improved English Pouter: a second\r\ngenus for Carriers and Runts; and this would have been a wide or\r\ncomprehensive genus, for it would have admitted common Spanish Runts\r\nwithout any wattle, short-beaked Runts like the Tronfo, and the improved\r\nEnglish Carrier: a third genus would have been formed for the Barb: a\r\nfourth for the Fantail: and lastly, a fifth for the short beaked, not-\r\nwattled pigeons, such as Turbits and short-faced Tumblers. The remaining\r\ndomestic forms might have been included, in the same genus with the wild\r\nrock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; VARIATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE.\r\n\r\nThe differences which we have as yet considered are characteristic of\r\ndistinct breeds; but there are other differences, either confined to\r\nindividual birds, or often observed in certain breeds but not\r\ncharacteristic of them. These individual differences are of importance, as\r\nthey might in most cases be secured and accumulated by man's power of\r\nselection and thus an existing breed might be greatly modified or a new one\r\nformed. Fanciers notice and select only those slight differences which are\r\nexternally visible; but the whole organisation is so tied together by\r\ncorrelation of growth, that a change in one part is frequently accompanied\r\nby other changes. For our purpose, modifications of all kinds are equally\r\nimportant, and if affecting a part which does not commonly vary, are of\r\nmore importance than a modification in some conspicuous part. At the\r\npresent day any visible deviation of character in a well-established breed\r\nis rejected as a blemish; but it by no means follows that at an early\r\nperiod, before well-marked breeds had been formed, such deviations would\r\nhave been rejected; on the contrary, they would have been eagerly preserved\r\nas presenting a novelty, and would then have been slowly augmented, as we\r\nshall hereafter more clearly see, by the process of unconscious selection.\r\n\r\n[I have made numerous measurements of the various parts of the body in the\r\nseveral breeds, and have hardly ever found them quite the same in birds of\r\nthe same breed,--the differences being greater than we commonly meet with\r\nin wild species within the same district. To begin with the primary\r\nfeathers of the wing and tail; but I must first mention, as some readers\r\nmay not be aware of the fact, that the number of the primary wing and tail-\r\nfeathers in wild birds is generally constant, and characterises, not only\r\nwhole genera, but even whole families. When the tail-feathers are unusually\r\nnumerous, as for instance in the swan, they are apt to be variable in\r\nnumber; but this does not apply to the several species and genera of the\r\nColumbidae, which never (as far as I can hear) have less than twelve or\r\nmore than sixteen tail-feathers; and these numbers characterise, with rare\r\nexception, whole sub-families. (5/27. 'Coup-d'oeil sur L'Ordre des Pigeons'\r\npar C.L. Bonaparte 'Comptes Rendus' 1854-55. Mr. Blyth in 'Annals of Nat.\r\nHist.' volume 19 1847 page 41, mentions, as a very singular fact, \"that of\r\nthe two species of Ectopistes, which are nearly allied to each other, one\r\nshould have fourteen tail-feathers, while the other, the passenger pigeon\r\nof North America, should possess but the usual number--twelve.\") The wild\r\nrock-pigeon has twelve tail-feathers. With Fantails, as we have seen, the\r\nnumber varies from fourteen to forty-two. In two young birds in the same\r\nnest I counted twenty-two and twenty-seven feathers. Pouters are very\r\nliable to have additional tail-feathers, and I have seen on several\r\noccasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds. Mr. Bult had a specimen,\r\nexamined by Mr. Yarrell, with seventeen tail-feathers. I had a Nun with\r\nthirteen, and another with fourteen tail-feathers; and in a Helmet, a breed\r\nbarely distinguishable from the Nun, I have counted fifteen, and have heard\r\nof other such instances. On the other hand, Mr. Brent possessed a Dragon,\r\nwhich during its whole life never had more than ten tail-feathers; and one\r\nof my Dragons, descended from Mr. Brent's, had only eleven. I have seen a\r\nBald-head Tumbler with only ten; and Mr. Brent had an Air-Tumbler with the\r\nsame number, but another with fourteen tail-feathers. Two of these latter\r\nTumblers, bred by Mr. Brent, were remarkable,--one from having the two\r\ncentral tail-feathers a little divergent, and the other from having the two\r\nouter feathers longer by three-eighths of an inch than the others; so that\r\nin both cases the tail exhibited a tendency, but in different ways, to\r\nbecome forked. And this shows us how a swallow-tailed breed, like that\r\ndescribed by Bechstein, might have been formed by careful selection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the primary wing-feathers, the number in the Columbidae, as\r\nfar as I can find out, is always nine or ten. In the rock-pigeon it is ten;\r\nbut I have seen no less than eight short-faced Tumblers with only nine\r\nprimaries, and the occurrence of this number has been noticed by fanciers,\r\nowing to ten primaries of a white colour being one of the points in Short-\r\nfaced Bald-head-Tumblers. Mr. Brent, however, had an Air-Tumbler (not\r\nshort-faced) which had in both wings eleven primaries. Mr. Corker, the\r\neminent breeder of prize Carriers, assures me that some of his birds had\r\neleven primaries in both wings. I have seen eleven in one wing in two\r\nPouters. I have been assured by three fanciers that they have seen twelve\r\nin Scanderoons; but as Neumeister asserts that in the allied Florence Runt\r\nthe middle flight-feather is often double, the number twelve may have been\r\ncaused by two of the ten primaries having each two shafts to a single\r\nfeather. The secondary wing-feathers are difficult to count, but the number\r\nseems to vary from twelve to fifteen. The length of the wing and tail\r\nrelatively to the body, and of the wings to the tail, certainly varies; I\r\nhave especially noticed this in Jacobins. In Mr. Bult's magnificent\r\ncollection of Pouters, the wings and tail varied greatly in length; and\r\nwere sometimes so much elongated that the birds could hardly play upright.\r\nIn the relative length of the few first primaries I have observed only a\r\nslight degree of variability. Mr. Brent informs me that he has observed the\r\nshape of the first feather to vary very slightly. But the variation in\r\nthese latter points is extremely slight compared with the differences which\r\nmay be observed in the natural species of the Columbidae.\r\n\r\nIn the beak I have seen very considerable differences in birds of the same\r\nbreed, as in carefully bred Jacobins and Trumpeters. In Carriers there is\r\noften a conspicuous difference in the degree of attenuation and curvature\r\nof the beak. So it is indeed in many breeds: thus I had two strains of\r\nblack Barbs, which evidently differed in the curvature of the upper\r\nmandible. In width of mouth I have found a great difference in two\r\nSwallows. In Fantails of first-rate merit I have seen some birds with much\r\nlonger and thinner necks than in others. Other analogous facts could be\r\ngiven. We have seen that the oil-gland is aborted in all Fantails (with the\r\nexception of the sub-race from Java), and, I may add, so hereditary is this\r\ntendency to abortion, that some, although not all, of the mongrels which I\r\nreared from the Fantail and Pouter had no oil-gland; in one Swallow out of\r\nmany which I have examined, and in two Nuns, there was no oil-gland.\r\n\r\nThe number of the scutellae on the toes often varies in the same breed, and\r\nsometimes even differs on the two feet of the same individual; the Shetland\r\nrock-pigeon has fifteen on the middle, and six on the hinder toe; whereas I\r\nhave seen a Runt with sixteen on the middle and eight on the hind toe; and\r\na short-faced Tumbler with only twelve and five on these same toes. The\r\nrock-pigeon has no sensible amount of skin between its toes; but I\r\npossessed a Spot and a Nun with the skin extending for a space of a quarter\r\nof an inch from the fork, between the two INNER toes. On the other hand, as\r\nwill hereafter be more fully shown, pigeons with feathered feet very\r\ngenerally have the bases of their OUTER toes connected by skin. I had a red\r\nTumbler, which had a coo unlike that of its fellows, approaching in tone to\r\nthat of the Laugher: this bird had the habit, to a degree which I never saw\r\nequalled in any other pigeon, of often walking with its wings raised and\r\narched in an elegant-manner. I need say nothing on the great variability,\r\nin almost every breed, in size of body, in colour, in the feathering of the\r\nfeet, and in the feathers on the back of the head being reversed. But I may\r\nmention a remarkable Tumbler (5/28. Described and figured in the 'Poultry\r\nChronicle' volume 3 1855 page 82.) exhibited at the Crystal Palace, which\r\nhad an irregular crest of feathers on its head, somewhat like the tuft on\r\nthe head of the Polish fowl. Mr. Bult reared a hen Jacobin with the\r\nfeathers on the thigh so long as to reach the ground, and a cock having,\r\nbut in a lesser degree, the same peculiarity: from these two birds he bred\r\nothers similarly characterised, which were exhibited at the Philoperisteron\r\nSoc. I bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous feathers, and the wing and\r\ntail-feathers so short and imperfect that the bird could not fly even a\r\nfoot in height.]\r\n\r\nThere are many singular and inherited peculiarities in the plumage of\r\npigeons: thus Almond-Tumblers do not acquire their perfect mottled feathers\r\nuntil they have moulted three or four times: the Kite Tumbler is at first\r\nbrindled black and red with a barred appearance, but when \"it throws its\r\nnest feathers it becomes almost black, generally with a bluish tail, and a\r\nreddish colour on the inner webs of the primary wing-feathers.\" (5/29. 'The\r\nPigeon Book' by Mr. B.P. Brent 1859 page 41.) Neumeister describes a breed\r\nof a black colour with white bars on the wing and a white crescent-shaped\r\nmark on the breast; these marks are generally rusty-red before the first\r\nmoult, but after the third or fourth moult they undergo a change; the wing-\r\nfeathers and the crown of the head likewise then become white or grey.\r\n(5/30. 'Die staarhalsige Taube. Das Ganze, etc.' s. 21 tab. 1. figure 4.)\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact, and I believe there is hardly an exception to the\r\nrule, that the especial characters for which each breed is valued are\r\neminently variable: thus, in the Fantail, the number and direction of the\r\ntail-feathers, the carriage of the body, and the degree of trembling are\r\nall highly variable points; in Pouters, the degree to which they pout, and\r\nthe shape of their inflated crops; in the Carrier, the length, narrowness,\r\nand curvature of the beak, and the amount of wattle; in Short-faced\r\nTumblers, the shortness of the beak, the prominence of the forehead, and\r\ngeneral carriage (5/31. 'A Treatise on the Almond-Tumbler' by J.M. Eaton\r\n1852 page 8 et passim.), and in the Almond-Tumbler the colour of the\r\nplumage; in common Tumblers, the manner of tumbling; in the Barb, the\r\nbreadth and shortness of the beak and the amount of eye-wattle; in Runts,\r\nthe size of body; in Turbits the frill; and lastly in Trumpeters, the\r\ncooing, as well as the size of the tuft of feathers over the nostrils.\r\nThese, which are the distinctive and selected characters of the several\r\nbreeds, are all eminently variable.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting fact with respect to the characters of the\r\nseveral breeds, namely, that they are often most strongly displayed in the\r\nmale bird. In Carriers, when the males and females are exhibited in\r\nseparate pens, the wattle is plainly seen to be much more developed in the\r\nmales, though I have seen a hen Carrier belonging to Mr. Haynes heavily\r\nwattled. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that, in twenty Barbs in Mr. P.H.\r\nJones's possession, the males had generally the largest eye-wattles; Mr.\r\nEsquilant also believes in this rule, but Mr. H. Weir, a first-rate judge,\r\nentertains some doubt on the subject. Male Pouters distend their crops to a\r\nmuch greater size than do the females; I have, however, seen a hen in the\r\npossession of Mr. Evans which pouted excellently; but this is an unusual\r\ncircumstance. Mr. Harrison Weir, a successful breeder of prize Fantails,\r\ninforms me that his male birds often have a greater number of tail-feathers\r\nthan the females. Mr. Eaton asserts (5/32. 'A Treatise, etc.' page 10.)\r\nthat if a cock and hen Tumbler were of equal merit, the hen would be worth\r\ndouble the money; and as pigeons always pair, so that an equal number of\r\nboth sexes is necessary for reproduction, this seems to show that high\r\nmerit is rarer in the female than in the male. In the development of the\r\nfrill in Turbits, of the hood in Jacobins, of the tuft in Trumpeters, of\r\ntumbling in Tumblers, there is no difference between the males and females.\r\nI may here add a rather different case, namely, the existence in France\r\n(5/33. Boitard and Corbie 'Les Pigeons' etc. 1824 page 173.) of a wine-\r\ncoloured variety of the Pouter, in which the male is generally chequered\r\nwith black, whilst the female is never so chequered. Dr. Chapuis also\r\nremarks (5/34. 'Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge' 1865 page 87. I have given in my\r\n'Descent of Man' 6th edition page 466 some curious cases, on the authority\r\nof Mr. Tegetmeier, of silver-coloured (i.e. very pale blue) birds being\r\ngenerally females, and of the ease with which a race thus characterised\r\ncould be produced. Bonizzi (see 'Variazioni dei Columbi domestici' Padova\r\n1873) states that certain coloured spots are often different in the two\r\nsexes, and the certain tints are commoner in females than in male pigeons.)\r\nthat in certain light-coloured pigeons the males have their feathers\r\nstriated with black, and these striae increase in size at each moult, so\r\nthat the male ultimately becomes spotted with black. With Carriers, the\r\nwattle, both on the beak and round the eyes, and with Barbs that round the\r\neyes, goes on increasing with age. This augmentation of character with\r\nadvancing age, and more especially the difference between the males and\r\nfemales in the above-mentioned several respects, are remarkable facts, for\r\nthere is no sensible difference at any age between the two sexes in the\r\naboriginal rock-pigeon; and not often any strongly marked difference\r\nthroughout the family of the Columbidae. (5/35. Prof. A. Newton 'Proc.\r\nZoolog. Soc.' 1865 page 716 remarks that he knows no species which present\r\nany remarkable sexual distinction; but Mr. Wallace informs me, that in the\r\nsub-family of the Treronidae the sexes often differ considerably in colour.\r\nSee also on sexual differences in the Columbidae, Gould 'Handbook to the\r\nBirds of Australia' volume 2 pages 109-149.)\r\n\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nIn the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability; and\r\nthough certain differences occur frequently, and others rarely, in certain\r\nbreeds, yet none can be said to be absolutely characteristic of any breed.\r\nConsidering that strongly-marked domestic races have been formed chiefly by\r\nman's selection, we ought not to expect to find great and constant\r\ndifferences in the skeleton; for fanciers neither see, nor do they care\r\nfor, modifications of structure in the internal framework. Nor ought we to\r\nexpect changes in the skeletons from changed habits of life; as every\r\nfacility is given to the most distinct breeds to follow the same habits,\r\nand the much modified races are never allowed to wander abroad and procure\r\ntheir own food in various ways. Moreover, I find, on comparing the\r\nskeletons of Columba livia, oenas, palumbus, and turtur, which are ranked\r\nby all systematists in two or three distinct though allied genera, that the\r\ndifferences are extremely slight, certainly less than between the skeletons\r\nof some of the most distinct domestic breeds. How far the skeleton of the\r\nwild rock-pigeon is constant I have had no means of judging, as I have\r\nexamined only two.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 24. SKULLS OF PIGEONS viewed laterally, of natural size. A. Wild\r\nRock-pigeon, Columba livia. B. Short-faced Tumbler. C. English Carrier. D.\r\nBagadotten Carrier.)\r\n\r\n[SKULL.\r\n\r\nThe individual bones, especially those at the base, do not differ in shape.\r\nBut the whole skull, in its proportions, outline, and relative direction of\r\nthe bones, differs greatly in some of the breeds, as may be seen by\r\ncomparing the figures of (A) the wild rock-pigeon, (B) the Short-faced\r\nTumbler, (C) the English Carrier, and (D) the Bagadotten Carrier (of\r\nNeumeister), all drawn of the natural size and viewed laterally. In the\r\nCarrier, besides the elongation of the bones of the face, the space between\r\nthe orbits is proportionally a little narrower than in the rock-pigeon. In\r\nthe Bagadotten the upper mandible is remarkably arched, and the\r\npremaxillary bones are proportionally broader. In the Short-faced Tumbler\r\nthe skull is more globular: all the bones of the face are much shortened,\r\nand the front of the skull and descending nasal bones are almost\r\nperpendicular: the maxillo-jugal arch and premaxillary bones form an almost\r\nstraight line; the space between the prominent edges of the eye-orbits is\r\ndepressed. In the Barb the premaxillary bones are much shortened, and their\r\nanterior portion is thicker than in the rock-pigeon, as is the lower part\r\nof the nasal bone. In two Nuns the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillaries, near their tips, were somewhat attenuated, and in these\r\nbirds, as well as in some others, for instance in the Spot, the occipital\r\ncrest over the foramen was considerably more prominent than in the rock-\r\npigeon.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 25. LOWER JAWS, seen from above, of natural size. A. Rock-pigeon.\r\nB. Runt. C. Barb.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 26. SKULL OF RUNT, seen from above, of natural size, showing the\r\nreflexed margin of the distal portion of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 27. LATERAL VIEW OF JAWS, of natural size. A. Rock-pigeon. B.\r\nShortfaced Tumbler. C. Bagadotten Carrier.)\r\n\r\nIn the lower jaw, the articular surface is proportionably smaller in many\r\nbreeds than in the rock-pigeon; and the vertical diameter, more especially\r\nof the outer part of the articular surface, is considerably shorter. May\r\nnot this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws, owing to\r\nnutritious food having been given during a long period to all highly\r\nimproved pigeons? In Runts, Carriers, and Barbs (and in a lesser degree in\r\nseveral breeds), the whole side of the jaw near the articular end is bent\r\ninwards in a highly remarkable manner; and the superior margin of the\r\nramus, beyond the middle, is reflexed in an equally remarkable manner, as\r\nmay be seen in figure 25, in comparison with the jaw of the rock-pigeon.\r\nThis reflection of the upper margin of the lower jaw is plainly connected\r\nwith the singularly wide gape of the mouth, as has been described in Runts,\r\nCarriers, and Barbs. The reflection is well shown in figure 26 of the head\r\nof a Runt seen from above; here a wide open space may be observed on each\r\nside, between the edges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary bones. In\r\nthe rock-pigeon, and in several domestic breeds, the edges of the lower jaw\r\non each side come close up to the premaxillary bones, so that no open space\r\nis left. The degree of downward curvature of the distal half of the lower\r\njaw also differs to an extraordinary degree in some breeds, as may be seen\r\nin the drawings (figure 27 A) of the rock-pigeon, (B) of the Short-faced\r\nTumbler, and (C) of the Bagadotten Carrier of Neumeister. In some Runts the\r\nsymphysis of the lower jaw is remarkably solid. No one would readily have\r\nbelieved that jaws differing in the several above-specified points so\r\ngreatly could have belonged to the same species.\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\nAll the breeds have twelve cervical vertebrae. (5/36. I am not sure that I\r\nhave designated the different kinds of vertebra correctly: but I observe\r\nthat different anatomists follow in this respect different rules, and, as I\r\nuse the same terms in the comparison of all the skeletons, this, I hope,\r\nwill not signify.) But in a Bussorah Carrier from India the twelfth\r\nvertebra carried a small rib, a quarter of an inch in length, with a\r\nperfect double articulation.\r\n\r\nThe DORSAL VERTEBRAE are always eight. In the rock-pigeon all eight bear\r\nribs; the eighth rib being very thin, and the seventh having no process. In\r\nPouters all the ribs are extremely broad, eight bear ribs; the eighth rib\r\nbeing very thin and the seventh having no process. In Pouters all the ribs\r\nare extremely broad, and, in three out of four skeletons examined by me,\r\nthe eighth rib was twice or even thrice as broad as in the rock-pigeon; and\r\nthe seventh pair had distinct processes. In many breeds there are only\r\nseven ribs, as in seven out of eight skeletons of various Tumblers, and in\r\nseveral skeletons of Fantails, Turbits and Nuns.\r\n\r\nIn all these breeds the seventh pair was very small, and was destitute of\r\nprocesses, in which respect it differed from the same rib in the rock-\r\npigeon. In one Tumbler, and in the Bussorah Carrier, even the sixth pair\r\nhad no process. The hypapophysis of the second dorsal vertebra varies much\r\nin development; being sometimes (as in several, but not all Tumblers)\r\nnearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal vertebra; and the two\r\nhypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch. The development of the\r\narch, formed by the hypapophyses of the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae,\r\nalso varies considerably, as does the size of the hypapophysis of the fifth\r\nvertebra.\r\n\r\nThe rock-pigeon has twelve sacral vertebrae; but these vary in number,\r\nrelative size, and distinctness, in the different breeds. In Pouters, with\r\ntheir elongated bodies, there are thirteen or even fourteen, and, as we\r\nshall immediately see, an additional number of caudal vertebrae. In Runts\r\nand Carriers there is generally the proper number, namely twelve; but in\r\none Runt, and in the Bussorah Carrier, there were only eleven. In Tumblers\r\nthere are either eleven, or twelve, or thirteen sacral vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe CAUDAL VERTEBRAE are seven in number in the rock-pigeon. In Fantails,\r\nwhich have their tails so largely developed, there are eight or nine, and\r\napparently in one case ten, and they are a little longer than in the rock-\r\npigeon, and their shape varies considerably. Pouters, also, have eight or\r\nnine caudal vertebrae. I have seen eight in a Nun and Jacobin. Tumblers,\r\nthough such small birds, always have the normal number seven; as have\r\nCarriers, with one exception, in which there were only six.\r\n\r\nThe following table will serve as a summary, and will show the most\r\nremarkable deviations in the number of the vertebra and ribs which I have\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.

The anterior margin of the\r\nilium, however, is sometimes a little more equally rounded on both sides\r\nthan in the rock-pigeon. The ischium is also frequently rather more\r\nelongated. The obturator-notch is sometimes, as in many Tumblers, less\r\ndeveloped than in the rock-pigeon. The ridges on the ilium are very\r\nprominent in most Runts.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 28. SCAPULAE, of natural size. A. Rock-pigeon. B. Short-faced\r\nTumbler.)\r\n\r\nIn the bones of the extremities I could detect no difference, except in\r\ntheir proportional lengths; for instance, the metatarsus in a Pouter was\r\n1.65 inch, and in a Short-faced Tumbler only .95 in length; and this is a\r\ngreater difference than would naturally follow from their differently-sized\r\nbodies; but long legs in the Pouter, and small feet in the Tumbler, are\r\nselected points. In some Pouters the SCAPULA is rather straighter, and in\r\nsome Tumblers it is straighter, with the apex less elongated, than in the\r\nrock-pigeon: in figure 28, the scapula of the rock-pigeon (A), and of a\r\nshort-faced Tumbler (B), are given. The processes at the summit of the\r\nCORACOID, which receive the extremities of the furculum, form a more\r\nperfect cavity in some Tumblers than in the rock-pigeon: in Pouters these\r\nprocesses are larger and differently shaped, and the exterior angle of the\r\nextremity of the coracoid, which is articulated to the sternum, is squarer.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 29. FURCULA, of natural size. A. Short-faced Tumbler. B and C\r\nFantail. D. Pouter.)\r\n\r\nThe two arms of the FURCULUM in Pouters diverge less, proportionally to\r\ntheir length, than in the rock-pigeon; and the symphysis is more solid and\r\npointed. In Fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms varies in a\r\nremarkable manner. In figure 29, B and C represent the furcula of two\r\nFantails; and it will be seen that the divergence in B is rather less even\r\nthan in the furculum of the short-faced, small-sized Tumbler (A), whereas\r\nthe divergence in C equals that in a rock-pigeon, or in the Pouter (D),\r\nthough the latter is a much larger bird. The extremities of the furculum,\r\nwhere articulated to the coracoids, vary considerably in outline.\r\n\r\nIn the STERNUM the differences in form are slight, except in the size and\r\noutline of the perforations, which, both in the larger and lesser sized\r\nbreeds, are sometimes small. These perforations, also, are sometimes either\r\nnearly circular, or elongated as is often the case with Carriers. The\r\nposterior perforations occasionally are not complete, being left open\r\nposteriorly. The marginal apophyses forming the anterior perforations vary\r\ngreatly in development. The degree of convexity of the posterior part of\r\nthe sternum differs much, being sometimes almost perfectly flat. The\r\nmanubrium is rather more prominent in some individuals than in others, and\r\nthe pore immediately under it varies greatly in size.]\r\n\r\nCORRELATION OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nBy this term I mean that the whole organisation is so connected, that when\r\none part varies, other parts vary; but which of two correlated variations\r\nought to be looked at as the cause and which as the effect, or whether both\r\nresult from some common cause, we can seldom or never tell. The point of\r\ninterest for us is that, when fanciers, by the continued selection of\r\nslight variations, have largely modified one part, they often\r\nunintentionally produce other modifications. For instance, the beak is\r\nreadily acted on by selection, and, with its increased or diminished\r\nlength, the tongue increases or diminishes, but not in due proportion; for,\r\nin a Barb and Short-faced Tumbler, both of which have very short beaks, the\r\ntongue, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard of comparison, was\r\nproportionally not shortened enough, whilst in two Carriers and in a Runt\r\nthe tongue, proportionally with the beak, was not lengthened enough, thus,\r\nin a first-rate English Carrier, in which the beak from the tip to the\r\nfeathered base was exactly thrice as long as in a first-rate Short-faced\r\nTumbler, the tongue was only a little more than twice as long. But the\r\ntongue varies in length independently of the beak: thus in a Carrier with a\r\nbeak 1.2 inch in length, the tongue was .67 in length: whilst in a Runt\r\nwhich equalled the Carrier in length of body and in stretch of wings from\r\ntip to tip, the beak was .92 whilst the tongue was .73 of an inch in\r\nlength, so that the tongue was actually longer than in the carrier with its\r\nlong beak. The tongue of the Runt was also very broad at the root. Of two\r\nRunts, one had its beak longer by .23 of an inch, whilst its tongue was\r\nshorter by .14 than in the other.\r\n\r\nWith the increased or diminished length of the beak the length of the slit\r\nforming the external orifice of the nostrils varies, but not in due\r\nproportion, for, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard, the orifice in a\r\nShort-faced Tumbler was not shortened in due proportion with its very short\r\nbeak. On the other hand (and this could not have been anticipated), the\r\norifice in three English Carriers, in the Bagadotten Carrier, and in a Runt\r\n(pigeon cygne), was longer by above the tenth of an inch than would follow\r\nfrom the length of the beak proportionally with that of the rock-pigeon. In\r\none Carrier the orifice of the nostrils was thrice as long as in the rock-\r\npigeon, though in body and length of beak this bird was not nearly double\r\nthe size of the rock-pigeon. This greatly increased length of the orifice\r\nof the nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with the enlargement\r\nof the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the nostrils; and this\r\nis a character which is selected by fanciers. So again, the broad, naked,\r\nand wattled skin round the eyes of Carriers and Barbs is a selected\r\ncharacter; and in obvious correlation with this, the eyelids, measured\r\nlongitudinally, are proportionally more than double the length of those of\r\nthe rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe great difference (see figure 27) in the curvature of the lower jaw in\r\nthe rock-pigeon, the Tumbler, and Bagadotten Carrier, stands in obvious\r\nrelation to the curvature of the upper jaw, and more especially to the\r\nangle formed by the maxillo-jugal arch with the premaxillary bones. But in\r\nCarriers, Runts, and Barbs the singular reflexion of the upper margin of\r\nthe middle part of the lower jaw (see figure 25) is not strictly correlated\r\nwith the width or divergence (as may be clearly seen in figure 26) of the\r\npremaxillary bones, but with the breadth of the horny and soft parts of the\r\nupper mandible, which are always overlapped by the edges of the lower\r\nmandible.\r\n\r\nIn Pouters, the elongation of the body is a selected character, and the\r\nribs, as we have seen, have generally become very broad, with the seventh\r\npair furnished with processes; the sacral and caudal vertebrae have been\r\naugmented in number; the sternum has likewise increased in length (but not\r\nin the depth of the crest) by .4 of an inch more than would follow from the\r\ngreater bulk of the body in comparison with that of the rock-pigeon. In\r\nFantails, the length and number of the caudal vertebrae have increased.\r\nHence, during the gradual progress of variation and selection, the internal\r\nbony framework and the external shape of the body have been, to a certain\r\nextent, modified in a correlated manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wings and tail often vary in length independently of each\r\nother, it is scarcely possible to doubt that they generally tend to become\r\nelongated or shortened in correlation. This is well seen in Jacobins, and\r\nstill more plainly in Runts, some varieties of which have their wings and\r\ntail of great length, whilst others have both very short. With Jacobins,\r\nthe remarkable length of the tail and wing-feathers is not a character\r\nwhich is intentionally selected by fanciers; but fanciers have been trying\r\nfor centuries, at least since the year 1600, to increase the length of the\r\nreversed feathers on the neck, so that the hood may more completely enclose\r\nthe head; and it may be suspected that the increased length of the wing and\r\ntail-feathers stand in correlation with the increased length of the neck-\r\nfeathers. Short-faced Tumblers have short wings in nearly due proportion\r\nwith the reduced size of their bodies; but it is remarkable, seeing that\r\nthe number of the primary wing-feathers is a constant character in most\r\nbirds, that these Tumblers generally have only nine instead of ten\r\nprimaries. I have myself observed this in eight birds; and the Original\r\nColumbarian Society (5/37. J.M. Eaton 'Treatise' edition 1858 page 78.)\r\nreduced the standard for Bald-head Tumblers from ten to nine white flight-\r\nfeathers, thinking it unfair that a bird which had only nine feathers\r\nshould be disqualified for a prize because it had not ten WHITE flight-\r\nfeathers. On the other hand, in Carriers and Runts, which have large bodies\r\nand long wings, eleven primary feathers have occasionally been observed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and inexplicable case of\r\ncorrelation, namely, that young pigeons of all breeds which when mature\r\nbecome white, yellow, silver (i.e., extremely pale blue), or dun-coloured,\r\nare born almost naked; whereas pigeons of other colours are born well-\r\nclothed with down. Mr. Esquilant, however, has observed that young dun\r\nCarriers are not so bare as young dun Barbs and Tumblers. Mr. Tegetmeier\r\nhas seen two young birds in the same nest, produced from differently\r\ncoloured parents, which differed greatly in the degree to which they were\r\nat first clothed with down.\r\n\r\nI have observed another case of correlation which at first sight appears\r\nquite inexplicable, but on which, as we shall see in a future chapter, some\r\nlight can be thrown by the law of homologous parts varying in the same\r\nmanner. The case is, that, when the feet are much feathered, the roots of\r\nthe feathers are connected by a web of skin, and apparently in correlation\r\nwith this the two outer toes become connected for a considerable space by\r\nskin. I have observed this in very many specimens of Pouters, Trumpeters,\r\nSwallows, Roller-tumblers (likewise observed in this breed by Mr. Brent),\r\nand in a lesser degree in other feather-footed pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of course much smaller or\r\nlarger than those of the rock-pigeon; but the scutellae or scales covering\r\nthe toes and tarsi have not only decreased or increased in size, but\r\nlikewise in number. To give a single instance, I have counted eight\r\nscutellae on the hind toe of a Runt, and only five on that of a Short-faced\r\nTumbler. With birds in a state of nature the number of the scutellae on the\r\nfeet is usually a constant character. The length of the feet and the length\r\nof the beak apparently stand in correlation; but as disuse apparently has\r\naffected the size of the feet, this case may come under the following\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nON THE EFFECTS OF DISUSE.\r\n\r\nIn the following discussion on the relative proportions of the feet,\r\nsternum, furculum, scapulae, and wings, I may premise, in order to give\r\nsome confidence to the reader, that all my measurements were made in the\r\nsame manner, and that they were made without the least intention of\r\napplying them to the following purpose.\r\n\r\n[TABLE 5.I.\r\n\r\nPIGEONS WITH THEIR BEAKS GENERALLY SHORTER THAN THAT OF THE ROCK-PIGEON,\r\nPROPORTIONALLY TO THE SIZE OF THEIR BODIES.\r\n\r\nColumn 1.

I\r\nmeasured the feet without the claws, from the end of the middle toe to the\r\nend of the hind toe; and the tarsus and middle toe together. I have taken\r\nin every case the mean measurement of two wild rock-pigeons from the\r\nShetland Islands, as the standard of comparison. The following table shows\r\nthe actual length of the feet in each bird; and the difference between the\r\nlength which the feet ought to have had according to the size of body of\r\neach, in comparison with the size of body and length of feet of the rock-\r\npigeon, calculated (with a few specified exceptions) by the standard of the\r\nlength of the body from the base of the beak to the oil-gland. I have\r\npreferred this standard, owing to the variability of the length of tail.\r\nBut I have made similar calculations, taking as the standard the length\r\nfrom tip to tip of wing, and likewise in most cases from the base of the\r\nbeak to the end of the tail; and the result has always been closely\r\nsimilar. To give an example: the first bird in the table, being a Short-\r\nfaced Tumbler, is much smaller than the rock-pigeon, and would naturally\r\nhave shorter feet; but it is found on calculation to have feet too short by\r\n.11 of an inch, in comparison with the feet of the rock-pigeon, relatively\r\nto the size of the body in these two birds, as measured from the base of\r\nbeak to the oil-gland. So again, when this same Tumbler and the rock-pigeon\r\nwere compared by the length of their wings, or by the extreme length of\r\ntheir bodies, the feet of the Tumbler were likewise found to be too short\r\nin very nearly the same proportion. I am well aware that the measurements\r\npretend to greater accuracy than is possible, but it was less trouble to\r\nwrite down the actual measurements given by the compasses in each case than\r\nan approximation.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5.II.\r\n\r\nPIGEONS WITH THEIR BEAKS LONGER THAN THAT OF THE ROCK-PIGEON,\r\nPROPORTIONALLY TO THE SIZE OF THEIR BODIES.\r\n\r\nColumn 1.

In the first table twenty-two specimens have their feet too short,\r\non an average by a little above the tenth of an inch (viz. .107); and five\r\nspecimens have their feet on an average a very little too long, namely, by\r\n.07 of an inch. But some of these latter cases can be explained; for\r\ninstance, with Pouters the legs and feet are selected for length, and thus\r\nany natural tendency to a diminution in the length of the feet will have\r\nbeen counteracted. In the Swallow and Barb, when the calculation was made\r\non any standard of comparison besides the one used (viz. length of body\r\nfrom base of beak to oil-gland), the feet were found to be too small.\r\n\r\nIn the second table we have eight birds, with their beaks much longer than\r\nin the rock-pigeon, both actually and proportionally with the size of body,\r\nand their feet are in an equally marked manner longer, namely, in\r\nproportion, on an average by .29 of an inch. I should here state that in\r\nTable 5.I. there are a few partial exceptions to the beak being\r\nproportionally shorter than in the rock-pigeon: thus the beak of the\r\nEnglish Frill-back is just perceptibly longer, and that of the Bussorah\r\nCarrier of the same length or slightly longer, than in the rock-pigeon. The\r\nbeaks of Spots, Swallows, and Laughers are only a very little shorter, or\r\nof the same proportional length, but slenderer. Nevertheless, these two\r\ntables, taken conjointly, indicate pretty plainly some kind of correlation\r\nbetween the length of the beak and the size of the feet. Breeders of cattle\r\nand horses believe that there is an analogous connection between the length\r\nof the limbs and head; they assert that a race-horse with the head of a\r\ndray-horse, or a grey-hound with the head of a bulldog, would be a\r\nmonstrous production. As fancy pigeons are generally kept in small\r\naviaries, and are abundantly supplied with food, they must walk about much\r\nless than the wild rock-pigeon; and it may be admitted as highly probable\r\nthat the reduction in the size of the feet in the twenty-two birds in the\r\nfirst table has been caused by disuse (5/38. In an analogous, but converse,\r\nmanner, certain natural groups of the Columbidae, from being more\r\nterrestrial in their habits than other allied groups, have larger feet. See\r\nPrince Bonaparte 'Coup d'oeil sur l'Ordre des Pigeons.'), and that this\r\nreduction has acted by correlation on the beaks of the great majority of\r\nthe birds in Table 5.I. When, on the other hand, the beak has been much\r\nelongated by the continued selection of successive slight increments of\r\nlength, the feet by correlation have likewise become much elongated in\r\ncomparison with those of the wild rock-pigeon, notwithstanding their\r\nlessened use.\r\n\r\nAs I had taken measures from the end of the middle toe to the heel of the\r\ntarsus in the rock-pigeon and in the above thirty-six birds, I have made\r\ncalculations analogous with those above given, and the result is the same--\r\nnamely, that in the short-beaked breeds, with equally few exceptions as in\r\nthe former case, the middle toe conjointly with the tarsus has decreased in\r\nlength; whereas in the long-beaked breeds it has increased in length,\r\nthough not quite so uniformly as in the former case, for the leg, in some\r\nvarieties of the Runt varies much in length.\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF STERNUM.\r\n\r\nAs fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries of moderate size, and\r\nas even when not confined they do not search for their own food, they must\r\nduring many generations have used their wings incomparably less than the\r\nwild rock-pigeon. Hence it seemed to me probable that all the parts of the\r\nskeleton subservient to flight would be found to be reduced in size. With\r\nrespect to the sternum, I have carefully measured its extreme length in\r\ntwelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild rock-pigeons from the\r\nShetland Islands. For the proportional comparison I have tried three\r\nstandards of measurement, with all twelve birds namely, the length from the\r\nbase of the beak to the oil-gland, to the end of the tail, and from the\r\nextreme tip to tip of wings. The result has been in each case nearly the\r\nsame, the sternum being invariably found to be shorter than in the wild\r\nrock-pigeon. I will give only a single table, as calculated by the standard\r\nfrom the base of the beak to the oil-gland; for the result in this case is\r\nnearly the mean between the results obtained by the two other standards.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5.III.\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF STERNUM.\r\n\r\nColumn 1.

In two of the twenty-one birds the\r\ncrest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the rock-pigeon; in\r\nseven it was more prominent; but in five out of these seven, namely, in a\r\nFantail, two Scanderoons, and two English Carriers, this greater prominence\r\nmay to a certain extent be explained, as a prominent breast is admired and\r\nselected by fanciers; in the remaining twelve birds the prominence was\r\nless. Hence it follows that the crest exhibits a slight, though uncertain,\r\ntendency to be reduced in prominence in a greater degree than does the\r\nlength of the sternum relatively to the size of body, in comparison with\r\nthe rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nI have measured the length of the scapula in nine different large and\r\nsmall-sized breeds, and in all the scapula is proportionally shorter\r\n(taking the same standard as before) than in the wild rock-pigeon. The\r\nreduction in length on an average is very nearly one-fifth of an inch, or\r\nabout one-ninth of the length of the scapula in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the furcula in all the specimens which I compared, diverged\r\nless, proportionally with the size of body, than in the rock-pigeon; and\r\nthe whole furculum was proportionally shorter. Thus in a Runt, which\r\nmeasured from tip to tip of wings 38 1/2 inches, the furculum was only a\r\nvery little longer (with the arms hardly more divergent) than in a rock-\r\npigeon which measured from tip to tip 26 1/2 inches. In a Barb, which in\r\nall its measurements was a little larger than the same rock-pigeon, the\r\nfurculum was a quarter of an inch shorter. In a Pouter, the furculum had\r\nnot been lengthened proportionally with the increased length of the body.\r\nIn a Short-faced Tumbler, which measured from tip to tip of wings 24\r\ninches, therefore only 2 1/2 inches less than the rock-pigeon, the furculum\r\nwas barely two-thirds of the length of that of the rock-pigeon.]\r\n\r\nWe thus clearly see that the sternum, scapula, and furculum are all reduced\r\nin proportional length; but when we turn to the wings we find what at first\r\nappears a wholly different and unexpected result. I may here remark that I\r\nhave not picked out specimens, but have used every measurement made by me.\r\nTaking the length from the base of beak to the end of the tail as the\r\nstandard of comparison, I find that, out of thirty-five birds of various\r\nbreeds, twenty-five have wings of greater, and ten have them of less\r\nproportional length, than in the rock-pigeon. But from the frequently\r\ncorrelated length of the tail and wing-feathers, it is better to take as\r\nthe standard of comparison the length from the base of the beak to the oil-\r\ngland; and by this standard, out of twenty-six of the same birds which had\r\nbeen thus measured, twenty-one had wings too long, and only five had them\r\ntoo short. In the twenty-one birds the wings exceeded in length those of\r\nthe rock-pigeon, on an average, by 1 1/3 inch; whilst in the five birds\r\nthey were less in length by only .8 of an inch. As I was much surprised\r\nthat the wings of closely confined birds should thus so frequently have\r\nbeen increased in length, it occurred to me that it might be solely due to\r\nthe greater length of the wing-feathers; for this certainly is the case\r\nwith the Jacobin, which has wings of unusual length. As in almost every\r\ncase I had measured the folded wings, I subtracted the length of this\r\nterminal part from that of the expanded wings, and thus I obtained, with a\r\nmoderate degree of accuracy, the length of the wings from the ends of the\r\ntwo radii, answering from wrist to wrist in our arms. The wings, thus\r\nmeasured in the same twenty-five birds, now gave a widely different result;\r\nfor they were proportionally with those of the rock-pigeon too short in\r\nseventeen birds, and in only eight too long. Of these eight birds, five\r\nwere long-beaked (5/39. It perhaps deserves notice that besides these five\r\nbirds two of the eight were Barbs, which, as I have shown, must be classed\r\nin the same group with the long-beaked Carriers and Runts. Barbs may\r\nproperly be called short-beaked Carriers. It would, therefore, appear as\r\nif, during the reduction of their beaks, their wings had retained a little\r\nof that excess of length which is characteristic of their nearest relations\r\nand progenitors.), and this fact perhaps indicates that there is some\r\ncorrelation of the length of the beak with the length of the bones of the\r\nwings, in the same manner as with that of the feet and tarsi. The\r\nshortening of the humerus and radius in the seventeen birds may probably be\r\nattributed to disuse, as in the case of the scapula and furculum to which\r\nthe wing-bones are attached;--the lengthening of the wing-feathers, and\r\nconsequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip, being, on the\r\nother hand, as completely independent of use and disuse as is the growth of\r\nthe hair or wool on our long-haired dogs or long-woolled sheep.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: we may confidently admit that the length of the sternum, and\r\nfrequently the prominence of its crest, the length of the scapula and\r\nfurculum, have all been reduced in size in comparison with the same parts\r\nin the rock-pigeon. And I presume that this may be attributed to disuse or\r\nlessened exercise. The wings, as measured from the ends of the radii, have\r\nlikewise been generally reduced in length; but, owing to the increased\r\ngrowth of the wing-feathers, the wings, from tip to tip, are commonly\r\nlonger than in the rock-pigeon. The feet, as well as the tarsi conjointly\r\nwith the middle toe, have likewise in most cases become reduced; and this\r\nit is probable has been caused by their lessened use; but the existence of\r\nsome sort of correlation between the feet and beak is shown more plainly\r\nthan the effects of disuse. We have also some faint indication of a similar\r\ncorrelation between the main bones of the wing and the beak.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY ON THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEVERAL DOMESTIC RACES, AND\r\nBETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe beak, together with the bones of the face, differ remarkably in length,\r\nbreadth, shape, and curvature. The skull differs in shape, and greatly in\r\nthe angle formed by the union of the pre-maxillary, nasal, and maxillo-\r\njugal bones. The curvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper\r\nmargin, as well as the gape of the mouth, differ in a highly remarkable\r\nmanner. The tongue varies much in length, both independently and in\r\ncorrelation with the length of the beak. The development of the naked,\r\nwattled skin over the nostrils and round the eyes varies in an extreme\r\ndegree. The eyelids and the external orifices of the nostrils vary in\r\nlength, and are to a certain extent correlated with the degree of\r\ndevelopment of the wattle. The size and form of the oesophagus and crop,\r\nand their capacity for inflation, differ immensely. The length of the neck\r\nvaries. With the varying shape of the body, the breadth and number of the\r\nribs, the presence of processes, the number of the sacral vertebrae, and\r\nthe length of the sternum, all vary. The number and size of the coccygeal\r\nvertebrae vary, apparently in correlation with the increased size of the\r\ntail. The size and shape of the perforations in the sternum, and the size\r\nand divergence of the arms of the furculum, differ. The oil-gland varies in\r\ndevelopment, and is sometimes quite aborted. The direction and length of\r\ncertain feathers have been much modified, as in the hood of the Jacobin and\r\nthe frill of the Turbit. The wing and tail-feathers generally vary in\r\nlength together, but sometimes independently of each other and of the size\r\nof the body. The number and position of the tail-feather vary to an\r\nunparalleled degree. The primary and secondary wing-feathers occasionally\r\nvary in number, apparently in correlation with the length of the wing. The\r\nlength of the leg and the size of the feet, and, in connection with the\r\nlatter, the number of the scutellae, all vary. A web of skin sometimes\r\nconnects the bases of the two inner toes, and almost invariably the two\r\nouter toes when the feet are feathered.\r\n\r\nThe size of the body differs greatly: a Runt has been known to weigh more\r\nthan five times as much as a Short-faced Tumbler. The eggs differ in size\r\nand shape. According to Parmentier (5/40. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des\r\nPigeons et des Gallinaces' tome 1 1813 page 170.), some races use much\r\nstraw in building their nests, and others use little; but I cannot hear of\r\nany recent corroboration of this statement. The length of time required for\r\nhatching the eggs is uniform in all the breeds. The period at which the\r\ncharacteristic plumage of some breeds is acquired, and at which certain\r\nchanges of colour supervene, differs. The degree to which the young birds\r\nare clothed with down when first hatched is different, and is correlated in\r\na singular manner with the colour of the plumage. The manner of flight, and\r\ncertain inherited movements, such as clapping the wings, tumbling either in\r\nthe air or on the ground, and the manner of courting the female, present\r\nthe most singular differences. In disposition the several races differ.\r\nSome races are very silent; others coo in a highly peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough many different races have kept true in character during several\r\ncenturies, as we shall hereafter more fully see, yet there is far more\r\nindividual variability in the most constant breeds than in birds in a state\r\nof nature. There is hardly any exception to the rule that those characters\r\nvary most which are now most valued and attended to by fanciers, and which\r\nconsequently are now being improved by continued selection. This is\r\nindirectly admitted by fanciers when they complain that it is much more\r\ndifficult to breed high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of\r\nexcellence than the so-called toy pigeons, which differ from each other\r\nmerely in colour; for particular colours when once acquired are not liable\r\nto continued improvement or augmentation. Some characters become attached,\r\nfrom quite unknown causes, more strongly to the male than to the female\r\nsex; so that we have in certain races, a tendency towards the appearance of\r\nsecondary sexual characters (5/41. This term was used by John Hunter for\r\nsuch differences in structure between the males and females, as are not\r\ndirectly connected with the act of reproduction, as the tail of the\r\npeacock, the horns of deer, etc.) of which the aboriginal rock-pigeon\r\ndisplays not a trace.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI.\r\n\r\nPIGEONS--continued.\r\n\r\nON THE ABORIGINAL PARENT-STOCK OF THE SEVERAL DOMESTIC RACES.\r\nHABITS OF LIFE.\r\nWILD RACES OF THE ROCK-PIGEON.\r\nDOVECOTE-PIGEONS.\r\nPROOFS OF THE DESCENT OF THE SEVERAL RACES FROM COLUMBA LIVIA.\r\nFERTILITY OF THE RACES WHEN CROSSED.\r\nREVERSION TO THE PLUMAGE OF THE WILD ROCK-PIGEON.\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO THE FORMATION OF THE RACES.\r\nANTIQUITY AND HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPAL RACES.\r\nMANNER OF THEIR FORMATION.\r\nSELECTION.\r\nUNCONSCIOUS SELECTION.\r\nCARE TAKEN BY FANCIERS IN SELECTING THEIR BIRDS.\r\nSLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STRAINS GRADUALLY CHANGE INTO WELL-MARKED BREEDS.\r\nEXTINCTION OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS.\r\nCERTAIN BREEDS REMAIN PERMANENT, WHILST OTHERS CHANGE.\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThe differences described in the last chapter between the eleven chief\r\ndomestic races and between individual birds of the same race, would be of\r\nlittle significance, if they had not all descended from a single wild\r\nstock. The question of their origin is therefore of fundamental importance,\r\nand must be discussed at considerable length. No one will think this\r\nsuperfluous who considers the great amount of difference between the races,\r\nwho knows how ancient many of them are, and how truly they breed at the\r\npresent day. Fanciers almost unanimously believe that the different races\r\nare descended from several wild stocks, whereas most naturalists believe\r\nthat all are descended from the Columba livia or rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nTemminck (6/1. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' etc. tome 1 page\r\n191.) has well observed, and Mr. Gould has made the same remark to me, that\r\nthe aboriginal parent must have been a species which roosted and built its\r\nnest on rocks; and I may add that it must have been a social bird. For all\r\nthe domestic races are highly social, and none are known to build or\r\nhabitually to roost on trees. The awkward manner in which some pigeons,\r\nkept by me in a summer-house near an old walnut-tree, occasionally alighted\r\non the barer branches, was evident. (6/2. I have heard through Sir C. Lyell\r\nfrom Miss Buckley, that some half-bred Carriers kept during many years near\r\nLondon regularly settled by day on some adjoining trees, and, after being\r\ndisturbed in their loft by their young being taken, roosted on them at\r\nnight.) Nevertheless, Mr. R. Scot Skirving informs me that he often saw\r\ncrowds of pigeons in Upper Egypt settling on low trees, but not on palms,\r\nin preference to alighting on the mud hovels of the natives. In India Mr.\r\nBlyth (6/3. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 20 1857 page\r\n509; and in a late volume of the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society.') has\r\nbeen assured that the wild C. livia, var. intermedia, sometimes roosts in\r\ntrees. I may here give a curious instance of compulsion leading to changed\r\nhabits: the banks of the Nile above lat. 28 deg 30' are perpendicular for a\r\nlong distance, so that when the river is full the pigeons cannot alight on\r\nthe shore to drink, and Mr. Skirving repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on\r\nthe water, and drink whilst they floated down the stream. These flocks seen\r\nfrom a distance resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIf any domestic race had descended from a species which was not social, or\r\nwhich built its nest and roosted in trees (6/4. In works written on the\r\npigeon by fanciers I have sometimes observed the mistaken belief expressed\r\nthat the species which naturalists called ground-pigeons (in\r\ncontradistinction to arboreal pigeons) do not perch and build on trees. In\r\nthese same works by fanciers wild species resembling the chief domestic\r\nraces are often said to exist in various parts of the world; but such\r\nspecies are quite unknown to naturalists.) the sharp eyes of fanciers would\r\nassuredly have detected some vestige of so different an aboriginal habit.\r\nFor we have reason to believe that aboriginal habits are long retained\r\nunder domestication. Thus with the common ass we see signs of its original\r\ndesert life in its strong dislike to cross the smallest stream of water,\r\nand in its pleasure in rolling in the dust. The same strong dislike to\r\ncross a stream is common to the camel, which has been domesticated from a\r\nvery ancient period. Young pigs, though so tame, sometimes squat when\r\nfrightened, and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open and bare\r\nplace. Young turkeys, and occasionally even young fowls, when the hen gives\r\nthe danger-cry, run away and try to hide themselves, like young partridges\r\nor pheasants, in order that their mother may take flight, of which she has\r\nlost the power. The musk-duck (Cairina moschata) in its native country\r\noften perches and roosts on trees (6/5. Sir R. Schomburgk in 'Journal R.\r\nGeograph. Soc.' volume 13 1844 page 32.), and our domesticated musk-ducks,\r\nthough such sluggish birds, \"are fond of perching on the tops of barns,\r\nwalls, etc., and, if allowed to spend the night in the hen-house, the\r\nfemale will generally go to roost by the side of the hens, but the drake is\r\ntoo heavy to mount thither with ease.\" (6/6. Rev. E.S. Dixon 'Ornamental\r\nPoultry' 1848 pages 63, 66.) We know that the dog, however well and\r\nregularly fed, often buries, like the fox, any superfluous food; and we see\r\nhim turning round and round on a carpet, as if to trample down grass to\r\nform a bed; we see him on bare pavements scratching backwards as if to\r\nthrow earth over his excrement, although, as I believe, this is never\r\neffected even where there is earth. In the delight with which lambs and\r\nkids crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock, we see a vestige of\r\ntheir former alpine habits.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of the\r\npigeon are descended either from some one or from several species which\r\nboth roosted and built their nests on rocks, and were social in\r\ndisposition. As only five or six wild species have these habits, and make\r\nany near approach in structure to the domesticated pigeon, I will enumerate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Firstly, the Columba leuconota resembles certain domestic varieties in its\r\nplumage, with the one marked and never-failing difference of a white band\r\nwhich crosses the tail at some distance from the extremity. This species,\r\nmoreover, inhabits the Himalaya, close to the limit of perpetual snow; and\r\ntherefore, as Mr. Blyth has remarked, is not likely to have been the parent\r\nof our domestic breeds, which thrive in the hottest countries. Secondly,\r\nthe C. rupestris, of Central Asia, which is intermediate (6/7. 'Proc.\r\nZoolog. Soc.' 1859 page 400.) between the C. leuconota and livia; but has\r\nnearly the same coloured tail as the former species. Thirdly, the Columba\r\nlittoralis builds and roosts, according to Temminck, on rocks in the\r\nMalayan archipelago; it is white, excepting parts of the wing and the tip\r\nof the tail, which are black; its legs are livid-coloured, and this is a\r\ncharacter not observed in any adult domestic pigeon; but I need not have\r\nmentioned this species or the closely-allied C. luctuosa, as they in fact\r\nbelong to the genus Carpophaga. Fourthly, Columba guinea, which ranges from\r\nGuinea (6/8. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' tome 1; also 'Les\r\nPigeons' par Mme. Knip and Temminck. Bonaparte, however, in his 'Coup-\r\nd'oeil' believes that two closely allied species are confounded together\r\nunder this name. The C. leucocephala of the West Indies is stated by\r\nTemminck to be a rock-pigeon; but I am informed by Mr. Gosse that this is\r\nan error.) to the Cape of Good Hope, and roosts either on trees or rocks,\r\naccording to the nature of the country. This species belongs to the genus\r\nStrictoenas of Reichenbach, but is closely allied to Columba; it is to some\r\nextent coloured like certain domestic races, and has been said to be\r\ndomesticated in Abyssinia; but Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, who collected the\r\nbirds of that country and knows the species, informs me that this is a\r\nmistake. Moreover, the C. guinea is characterised by the feathers of the\r\nneck having peculiar notched tips,--a character not observed in any\r\ndomestic race. Fifthly, the Columba oenas of Europe, which roosts on trees,\r\nand builds its nest in holes, either in trees or the ground; this species,\r\nas far as external characters go, might be the parent of several domestic\r\nraces; but, though it crosses readily with the true rock-pigeon, the\r\noffspring, as we shall presently see, are sterile hybrids, and of such\r\nsterility there is not a trace when the domestic races are intercrossed. It\r\nshould also be observed that if we were to admit, against all probability,\r\nthat any of the foregoing five or six species were the parents of some of\r\nour domestic pigeons, not the least light would be thrown on the chief\r\ndifferences between the eleven most strongly-marked races.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the best known rock-pigeon, the Columba livia, which is\r\noften designated in Europe pre-eminently as the Rock-pigeon, and which\r\nnaturalists believe to be the parent of all the domesticated breeds. This\r\nbird agrees in every essential character with the breeds which have been\r\nonly slightly modified. It differs from all other species in being of a\r\nslaty-blue colour, with two black bars on the wings, and with the croup (or\r\nloins) white. Occasionally birds are seen in Faroe and the Hebrides with\r\nthe black bars replaced by two or three black spots; this form has been\r\nnamed by Brehm (6/9. 'Handbuch der Naturgesch. Vogel Deutschlands.') C.\r\namaliae, but this species has not been admitted as distinct by other\r\nornithologists. Graba (6/10. 'Tagebuch, Reise nach Faro' 1830 s. 62.) even\r\nfound a difference in the bars on the right and left wings of the same bird\r\nin Faroe. Another and rather more distinct form is either truly wild or has\r\nbecome feral on the cliffs of England and was doubtfully named by Mr. Blyth\r\n(6/11. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 19 1847 page 102. This\r\nexcellent paper on pigeons is well worth consulting.) as C. affinis, but is\r\nnow no longer considered by him as a distinct species. C. affinis is rather\r\nsmaller than the rock-pigeon of the Scottish islands, and has a very\r\ndifferent appearance owing to the wing-coverts being chequered with black,\r\nwith similar marks often extending over the back. The chequering consists\r\nof a large black spot on the two sides, but chiefly on the outer side, of\r\neach feather. The wing-bars in the true rock-pigeon and in the chequered\r\nvariety are, in fact, due to similar though larger spots symmetrically\r\ncrossing the secondary wing-feather and the larger coverts. Hence the\r\nchequering arises merely from an extension of these marks to other parts of\r\nthe plumage. Chequered birds are not confined to the coasts of England; for\r\nthey were found by Graba at Faroe; and W. Thompson (6/12. 'Natural History\r\nof Ireland' Birds volume 2 1850 page 11. For Graba see previous reference.)\r\nsays that at Islay fully half the wild rock-pigeons were chequered. Colonel\r\nKing, of Hythe, stocked his dovecote with young wild birds which he himself\r\nprocured from nests at the Orkney Islands; and several specimens, kindly\r\nsent to me by him, were all plainly chequered. As we thus see that\r\nchequered birds occur mingled with the true rock-pigeon at three distinct\r\nsites, namely, Faroe, the Orkney Islands, and Islay, no importance can be\r\nattached to this natural variation in the plumage.\r\n\r\nPrince C.L. Bonaparte (6/13. 'Coup-d'oeil sur l'Ordre des Pigeons' 'Comptes\r\nRendus' 1854-55.), a great divider of species, enumerates, with a mark of\r\ninterrogation, as distinct from C. livia, the C. turricola of Italy, the C.\r\nrupestris of Daouria, and the C. schimperi of Abyssinia; but these birds\r\ndiffer from C. livia in characters of the most trifling value. In the\r\nBritish Museum there is a chequered pigeon, probably the C. schimperi of\r\nBonaparte, from Abyssinia. To these may be added the C. gymnocyclus of G.R.\r\nGray from W. Africa, which is slightly more distinct, and has rather more\r\nnaked skin round the eyes than the rock-pigeon; but from information given\r\nme by Dr. Daniell, it is doubtful whether this is a wild bird, for\r\ndovecote-pigeons (which I have examined) are kept on the coast of Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe wild rock-pigeon of India (C. intermedia of Strickland) has been more\r\ngenerally accepted as a distinct species. It differs chiefly in the croup\r\nbeing blue instead of snow-white; but as Mr. Blyth informs me, the tint\r\nvaries, being sometimes albescent. When this form is domesticated chequered\r\nbirds appear, just as occurs in Europe with the truly wild C. livia.\r\nMoreover we shall immediately have proof that the blue and white croup is a\r\nhighly variable character; and Bechstein (6/14. 'Naturgeschichte\r\nDeutschlands' b. 4 1795 s. 14.) asserts that with dovecote-pigeons in\r\nGermany this is the most variable of all the characters of the plumage.\r\nHence it may be concluded that C. intermedia cannot be ranked as\r\nspecifically distinct from C. livia.\r\n\r\nIn Madeira there is a rock-pigeon which a few ornithologists have suspected\r\nto be distinct from C. livia. I have examined numerous specimens collected\r\nby Mr. E.V. Harcourt and Mr. Mason. They are rather smaller than the rock-\r\npigeon from the Shetland Islands, and their beaks are plainly thinner, but\r\nthe thickness of the beak varied in the several specimens. In plumage there\r\nis remarkable diversity; some specimens are identical in every feather (I\r\nspeak after actual comparison) with the rock-pigeon of the Shetland\r\nIslands; others are chequered, like C. affinis from the cliffs of England,\r\nbut generally to a greater degree, being almost black over the whole back;\r\nothers are identical with the so-called C. intermedia of India in the\r\ndegree of blueness of the croup; whilst others have this part very pale or\r\nvery dark blue, and are likewise chequered. So much variability raises a\r\nstrong suspicion that these birds are domestic pigeons which have become\r\nferal.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it can hardly be doubted that C. livia, affinis,\r\nintermedia, and the forms marked with an interrogation by Bonaparte ought\r\nall to be included under a single species. But it is quite immaterial\r\nwhether or not they are thus ranked, and whether some one of these forms or\r\nall are the progenitors of the various domestic kinds, as far as any light\r\ncan thus be thrown on the differences between the more strongly-marked\r\nraces. That common dovecote-pigeons, which are kept in various parts of the\r\nworld, are descended from one or from several of the above-mentioned wild\r\nvarieties of C. livia, no one who compares them will doubt. But before\r\nmaking a few remarks on dovecote-pigeons, it should be stated that the wild\r\nrock-pigeon has been found easy to tame in several countries. We have seen\r\nthat Colonel King at Hythe stocked his dovecote more than twenty years ago\r\nwith young wild birds taken at the Orkney Islands, and since then they have\r\ngreatly multiplied. The accurate Macgillivray (6/15. 'History of British\r\nBirds' volume 1 pages 275-284. Mr. Andrew Duncan tamed a rock-pigeon in the\r\nShetland Islands. Mr. James Barclay, and Mr. Smith of Uyea Sound, both say\r\nthat the wild rock-pigeon can be easily tamed; and the former gentleman\r\nasserts that the tamed birds breed four times a year. Dr. Lawrence\r\nEdmondstone informs me that a wild rock-pigeon came and settled in his\r\ndovecote in Balta Sound in the Shetland Islands, and bred with his pigeons;\r\nhe has also given me other instances of the wild rock-pigeon having been\r\ntaken young and breeding in captivity.) asserts that he completely tamed a\r\nwild rock-pigeon in the Hebrides; and several accounts are on records of\r\nthese pigeons having bred in dovecotes in the Shetland Islands. In India,\r\nas Captain Hutton informs me, the wild rock-pigeon is easily tamed, and\r\nbreeds readily with the domestic kind; and Mr. Blyth (6/16. 'Annals and\r\nMag. of Nat. History' volume 19 1847 page 103 and volume for 1857 page\r\n512.) asserts that wild birds come frequently to the dovecotes and mingle\r\nfreely with their inhabitants. In the ancient 'Ayeen Akbery' it is written\r\nthat, if a few wild pigeons be taken, \"they are speedily joined by a\r\nthousand others of their kind.\"\r\n\r\nDovecote-pigeons are those which are kept in dovecotes in a semi-\r\ndomesticated state; for no special care is taken of them, and they procure\r\ntheir own food, except during the severest weather. In England, and,\r\njudging from MM. Boitard and Corbie's work, in France, the common dovecote-\r\npigeon exactly resembles the chequered variety of C. livia; but I have seen\r\ndovecotes brought from Yorkshire without any trace of chequering, like the\r\nwild rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands. The chequered dovecotes from the\r\nOrkney Islands, after having been domesticated by Colonel King for more\r\nthan twenty years, differed slightly from each other in the darkness of\r\ntheir plumage and in the thickness of their beaks; the thinnest beak being\r\nrather thicker than the thickest one in the Madeira birds. In Germany,\r\naccording to Bechstein, the common dovecote-pigeon is not chequered. In\r\nIndia they often become chequered, and sometimes pied with white; the croup\r\nalso, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, becomes nearly white. I have received\r\nfrom Sir. J. Brooke some dovecote-pigeons, which originally came from the\r\nS. Natunas Islands in the Malay Archipelago, and which had been crossed\r\nwith the Singapore dovecotes: they were small and the darkest variety was\r\nextremely like the dark chequered variety with a blue croup from Madeira;\r\nbut the beak was not so thin, though decidedly thinner than in the rock-\r\npigeon from the Shetland Islands. A dovecote-pigeon sent to me by Mr.\r\nSwinhoe from Foochow, in China, was likewise rather small, but differed in\r\nno other respect. I have also received through the kindness of Dr. Daniell,\r\nfour living dovecote-pigeons from Sierra Leone (6/17. Domestic pigeons of\r\nthe common kind are mentioned as being pretty numerous in John Barbut's\r\n'Description of the Coast of Guinea' page 215 published in 1746; they are\r\nsaid, in accordance with the name which they bear, to have been imported.)\r\nthese were fully as large as the Shetland rock-pigeon, with even bulkier\r\nbodies. In plumage some of them were identical with the Shetland rock\r\npigeon, but with the metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant;\r\nothers had a blue croup, and resembled the chequered variety of C.\r\nintermedia of India; and some were so much chequered as to be nearly black.\r\nIn these four birds the beak differed slightly in length, but in all it was\r\ndecidedly shorter, more massive, and stronger than in the wild rock-pigeon\r\nfrom the Shetland Islands, or in the English dovecote. When the beaks of\r\nthese African pigeons were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild\r\nMadeira specimens, the contrast was great; the former being fully one-third\r\nthicker in a vertical direction than the latter; so that any one at first\r\nwould have felt inclined to rank these birds as specifically distinct; yet\r\nso perfectly graduated a series could be formed between the above-mentioned\r\nvarieties, that it was obviously impossible to separate them.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the wild Columba livia, including under this name C. affinis,\r\nintermedia, and the other still more closely-affined geographical races,\r\nhas a vast range from the southern coast of Norway and the Faroe Islands to\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean, to Madeira and the Canary Islands, to\r\nAbyssinia, India, and Japan. It varies greatly in plumage, being in many\r\nplaces chequered with black, and having either a white or blue croup or\r\nloins; it varies also slightly in the size of the beak and body. Dovecote-\r\npigeons, which no one disputes are descended from one or more of the above\r\nwild forms, present a similar but greater range of variation in plumage, in\r\nthe size of body, and in the length and thickness of the beak. There seems\r\nto be some relation between the croup being blue or white, and the\r\ntemperature of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecote pigeons; for\r\nnearly all the dovecote-pigeons in the northern parts of Europe have a\r\nwhite croup, like that of the wild European rock-pigeon; and nearly all the\r\ndovecote-pigeons of India have a blue croup like that of the wild C.\r\nintermedia of India. As in various countries the wild rock-pigeon has been\r\nfound easy to tame, it seems extremely probable that the dovecote-pigeons\r\nthroughout the world are the descendants of at least two and perhaps more\r\nwild stocks; but these, as we have just seen, cannot be ranked as\r\nspecifically distinct.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the variation of C. livia, we may without fear of\r\ncontradiction go one step further. Those pigeon-fanciers who believe that\r\nall the chief races, such as Carriers, Pouters, Fantails, etc., are\r\ndescended from distinct aboriginal stocks, yet admit that the so-called\r\ntoy-pigeons, which differ from the rock-pigeon in little except colour, are\r\ndescended from this bird. By toy-pigeons are meant such birds as Spots,\r\nNuns, Helmets, Swallows, Priests, Monks, Porcelains, Swabians, Archangels,\r\nBreasts, Shields, and others in Europe, and many others in India. It would\r\nindeed be as puerile to suppose that all these birds are descended from so\r\nmany distinct wild stocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many\r\nvarieties of the gooseberry, heartsease, or dahlia. Yet these kinds all\r\nbreed true, and many of them include sub-varieties which likewise transmit\r\ntheir character truly. They differ greatly from each other and from the\r\nrock-pigeon in plumage, slightly in size and proportions of body, in size\r\nof feet, and in the length and thickness of their beaks. They differ from\r\neach other in these respects more than do dovecote-pigeons. Although we may\r\nsafely admit that dovecote-pigeons, which vary slightly, and that toy-\r\npigeons, which vary in a greater degree in accordance with their more\r\nhighly-domesticated condition, are descended from C. livia, including under\r\nthis name the above-enumerated wild geographical races; yet the question\r\nbecomes far more difficult when we consider the eleven principal races,\r\nmost of which have been profoundly modified. It can, however, be shown, by\r\nindirect evidence of a perfectly conclusive nature, that these principal\r\nraces are not descended from so many wild stocks; and if this be once\r\nadmitted, few will dispute that they are the descendants of C. livia, which\r\nagrees with them so closely in habits and in most characters, which varies\r\nin a state of nature, and which has certainly undergone a considerable\r\namount of variation, as in the toy-pigeons. We shall moreover presently see\r\nhow eminently favourable circumstances have been for a great amount of\r\nmodification in the more carefully tended breeds.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for concluding that the several principal races are not\r\ndescended from so many aboriginal and unknown stocks may be grouped under\r\nthe following six heads:--\r\n\r\nFIRSTLY.\r\n\r\nIf the eleven chief races have not arisen from the variation of some one\r\nspecies, together with its geographical races, they must be descended from\r\nseveral extremely distinct aboriginal species; for no amount of crossing\r\nbetween only six or seven wild forms could produce races so distinct as\r\nPouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits, Short-faced Tumblers,\r\nJacobins, and Trumpeters. How could crossing produce, for instance, a\r\nPouter or a Fantail, unless the two supposed aboriginal parents possessed\r\nthe remarkable characters of these breeds? I am aware that some\r\nnaturalists, following Pallas, believe that crossing gives a strong\r\ntendency to variation, independently of the characters inherited from\r\neither parent. They believe that it would be easier to raise a Pouter or\r\nFantail pigeon from crossing two distinct species, neither of which\r\npossessed the characters of these races, than from any single species. I\r\ncan find few facts in support of this doctrine, and believe in it only to a\r\nlimited degree; but in a future chapter I shall have to recur to this\r\nsubject. For our present purpose the point is not material. The question\r\nwhich concerns us is, whether or not many new and important characters have\r\narisen since man first domesticated the pigeon. On the ordinary view,\r\nvariability is due to changed conditions of life; on the Pallasian\r\ndoctrine, variability, or the appearance of new characters, is due to some\r\nmysterious effect from the crossing of two species, neither of which\r\npossesses the characters in question. In some few instances it is possible\r\nthat well-marked races may have been formed by crossing; for instance, a\r\nBarb might perhaps be formed by a cross between a long-beaked Carrier,\r\nhaving large eye-wattles, and some short-beaked pigeon. That many races\r\nhave been in some degree modified by crossing, and that certain varieties\r\nwhich are distinguished only by peculiar tints have arisen from crosses\r\nbetween differently-coloured varieties, is almost certain. On the doctrine,\r\ntherefore, that the chief races owe their differences to their descent from\r\ndistinct species, we must admit that at least eight or nine, or more\r\nprobably a dozen species, all having the same habit of breeding and\r\nroosting on rocks and living in society, either now exist somewhere, or\r\nformerly existed, but have become extinct as wild birds. Considering how\r\ncarefully wild pigeons have been collected throughout the world, and what\r\nconspicuous birds they are, especially when frequenting rocks, it is\r\nextremely improbable that eight or nine species, which were long ago\r\ndomesticated and therefore must have inhabited some anciently known\r\ncountry, should still exist in the wild state and be unknown to\r\nornithologists.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that such species formerly existed, but have become extinct,\r\nis in some slight degree more probable. But the extinction of so many\r\nspecies within the historical period is a bold hypothesis, seeing how\r\nlittle influence man has had in exterminating the common rock-pigeon, which\r\nagrees in all its habits of life with the domestic races. The C. livia now\r\nexists and flourishes on the small northern islands of Faroe, on many\r\nislands off the coast of Scotland, on Sardinia, and the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and in the centre of India. Fanciers have sometimes imagined\r\nthat the several supposed parent-species were originally confined to small\r\nislands, and thus might readily have been exterminated; but the facts just\r\ngiven do not favour the probability of their extinction, even on small\r\nislands. Nor is it probable, from what is known of the distribution of\r\nbirds, that the islands near Europe should have been inhabited by peculiar\r\nspecies of pigeons; and if we assume that distant oceanic islands were the\r\nhomes of the supposed parent-species, we must remember that ancient voyages\r\nwere tediously slow, and that ships were then ill-provided with fresh food,\r\nso that it would not have been easy to bring home living birds. I have said\r\nancient voyages, for nearly all the races of the pigeon were known before\r\nthe year 1600, so that the supposed wild species must have been captured\r\nand domesticated before that date.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that the chief domestic races are descended from several\r\naboriginal species, implies that several species were formerly so\r\nthoroughly domesticated as to breed readily when confined. Although it is\r\neasy to tame most wild birds, experience shows us that it is difficult to\r\nget them to breed freely under confinement; although it must be owned that\r\nthis is less difficult with pigeons than with most other birds. During the\r\nlast two or three hundred years, many birds have been kept in aviaries, but\r\nhardly one has been added to our list of thoroughly reclaimed species: yet\r\non the above doctrine we must admit that in ancient times nearly a dozen\r\nkinds of pigeons, now unknown in the wild state, were thoroughly\r\ndomesticated.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY.\r\n\r\nMost of our domesticated animals have run wild in various parts of the\r\nworld; but birds, owing apparently to their partial loss of the power of\r\nflight, less often than quadrupeds. Nevertheless I have met with accounts\r\nshowing that the common fowl has become feral in South America and perhaps\r\nin West Africa, and on several islands: the turkey was at one time almost\r\nferal on the banks of the Parana; and the Guinea-fowl has become perfectly\r\nwild at Ascension and in Jamaica. In this latter island the peacock, also,\r\n\"has become a maroon bird.\" The common duck wanders from its home and\r\nbecomes almost wild in Norfolk. Hybrids between the common and musk-duck\r\nwhich have become wild have been shot in North America, Belgium, and near\r\nthe Caspian Sea. The goose is said to have run wild in La Plata. The common\r\ndovecote-pigeon has become wild at Juan Fernandez, Norfolk Island,\r\nAscension, probably at Madeira, on the shores of Scotland, and, as is\r\nasserted, on the banks of the Hudson in North America. (6/18. With respect\r\nto feral pigeons--for Juan Fernandez see Bertero in 'Annal. des Sc. Nat.'\r\ntome 21 page 351. For Norfolk Islands see Rev. E.S. Dixon in the 'Dovecote'\r\n1851 page 14 on the authority of Mr. Gould. For Ascension I rely on MS.\r\ninformation given me by Mr. Layard. For the banks of the Hudson, see Blyth\r\nin 'Annals of Nat.

For guinea-fowls see Gosse 'Naturalist's\r\nSojourn in Jamaica' page 124; and his 'Birds of Jamaica' for fuller\r\nparticulars. I saw the wild guinea-fowl in Ascension. For the peacock see\r\n'A Week at Port Royal' by a competent authority, Mr. R. Hill, page 42. For\r\nthe turkey I rely on oral information; I ascertained that they were not\r\nCurassows. With respect to fowls I will give the references in the next\r\nchapter.) But how different is the case, when we turn to the eleven chief\r\ndomestic races of the pigeon, which are supposed by some authors to be\r\ndescended from so many distinct species! no one has ever pretended that any\r\none of these races has been found wild in any quarter of the world; yet\r\nthey have been transported to all countries, and some of them must have\r\nbeen carried back to their native homes. On the view that all the races are\r\nthe product of variation, we can understand why they have not become feral,\r\nfor the great amount of modification which they have undergone shows how\r\nlong and how thoroughly they have been domesticated; and this would unfit\r\nthem for a wild life.\r\n\r\nFOURTHLY.\r\n\r\nIf it be assumed that the characteristic differences between the various\r\ndomestic races are due to descent from several aboriginal species, we must\r\nconclude that man chose for domestication in ancient times, either\r\nintentionally or by chance, a most abnormal set of pigeons; for that\r\nspecies resembling such birds as Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Barbs, Short-\r\nfaced Tumblers, Turbits, etc., would be in the highest degree abnormal, as\r\ncompared with all the existing members of the great pigeon family, cannot\r\nbe doubted. Thus we should have to believe that man not only formerly\r\nsucceeded in thoroughly domesticating several highly abnormal species, but\r\nthat these same species have since all become extinct, or are at least now\r\nunknown. This double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed\r\nexistence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported by the\r\nstrongest evidence. On the other hand, if all the races are descended from\r\nC. livia, we can understand, as will hereafter be more fully explained, how\r\nany slight deviation in structure which first appeared would continually be\r\naugmented by the preservation of the most strongly marked individuals; and\r\nas the power of selection would be applied according to man's fancy, and\r\nnot for the bird's own good, the accumulated amount of deviation would\r\ncertainly be of an abnormal nature in comparison with the structure of\r\npigeons living in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the remarkable fact that the characteristic\r\ndifferences between the chief domestic races are eminently variable; we see\r\nthis plainly in the great difference in the number of the tail-feathers in\r\nthe Fantail, in the development of the crop in Pouters, in the length of\r\nthe beak in Tumblers, in the state of the wattle in Carriers, etc. If these\r\ncharacters are the result of successive variations added together by\r\nselection, we can understand why they should be so variable: for these are\r\nthe very parts which have varied since the domestication of the pigeon, and\r\ntherefore would be likely still to vary; these variations moreover have\r\nbeen recently, and are still being accumulated by man's selection;\r\ntherefore they have not as yet become firmly fixed.\r\n\r\nFIFTHLY.\r\n\r\nAll the domestic races pair readily together, and, what is equally\r\nimportant, their mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile. To ascertain this\r\nfact I made many experiments, which are given in the note below; and\r\nrecently Mr. Tegetmeier has made similar experiments with the same result.\r\n(6/19. I have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by\r\nfanciers between the several domestic breeds but I do not think it worth\r\nwhile publishing. I have myself made for this special purpose many crosses,\r\nand all were perfectly fertile. I have united in one bird five of the most\r\ndistinct races, and with patience I might undoubtedly have thus united all.\r\nThe case of five distinct breeds being blended together with unimpaired\r\nfertility is important, because Gartner has shown that it is a very\r\ngeneral, though not, as he thought, universal rule, that complex crosses\r\nbetween several species are excessively sterile. I have met with only two\r\nor three cases of reported sterility in the offspring of certain races when\r\ncrossed. Pistor ('Das Ganze der Feldtaubenzucht' 1831 s. 15) asserts that\r\nthe mongrels from Barbs and Fantails are sterile: I have proved this to be\r\nerroneous, not only by crossing those hybrids with several other hybrids of\r\nthe same parentage, but by the more severe test of pairing brother and\r\nsister hybrids inter se, and they were PERFECTLY fertile. Temminck has\r\nstated ('Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' tome 1 page 197) that the Turbit or\r\nOwl will not cross readily with other breeds: but my Turbits crossed, when\r\nleft free with Almond Tumblers and with Trumpeters; the same thing has\r\noccurred (Rev. E.S. Dixon 'The Dovecote' page 107) between Turbits and\r\nDovecotes and Nuns. I have crossed Turbits with Barbs, as has M. Boitard\r\n(page 34), who says the hybrids were very fertile. Hybrids from a Turbit\r\nand Fantail have been known to breed inter se (Riedel 'Taubenzucht' s. 25\r\nand Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutsch.' b. 4 s. 44. Turbits (Riedel s. 26)\r\nhave been crossed with Pouters and with Jacobins, and with a hybrid\r\nJacobin-trumpeter (Riedel s. 27). The latter author has, however, made some\r\nvague statements (s. 22) on the sterility of Turbits when crossed with\r\ncertain other crossed breeds. But I have little doubt that the Rev. E.S.\r\nDixon's explanation of such statements is correct, viz. that individual\r\nbirds both with Turbits and other breeds are occasionally sterile.) The\r\naccurate Neumeister asserts that when dovecotes are crossed with pigeons of\r\nany other breed, the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy. (6/20. 'Das\r\nGanze der Taubenzucht' s. 18.) MM. Boitard and Corbie (6/21. 'Les Pigeons'\r\netc. page 35.) affirm, after their great experience, that the more distinct\r\nthe breeds are which are crossed, the more productive are their mongrel\r\noffspring. I admit that the doctrine first broached by Pallas is highly\r\nprobable, if not actually proved, namely, that closely allied species,\r\nwhich in a state of nature or when first captured would have been in some\r\ndegree sterile if crossed, lose this sterility after a long course of\r\ndomestication; yet when we consider the great difference between such races\r\nas Pouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits, Tumblers etc., the fact of\r\ntheir perfect, or even increased, fertility when intercrossed in the most\r\ncomplicated manner becomes a strong argument in favour of their having all\r\ndescended from a single species. This argument is rendered much stronger\r\nwhen we hear (I append in a note (6/22. Domestic pigeons pair readily with\r\nthe allied C. oenas (Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' b. 4 s. 3); and\r\nMr. Brent has made the same cross several times in England, but the young\r\nwere very apt to die at about ten days old; one hybrid which he reared\r\n(from C. oenas and a male Antwerp Carrier) paired with a Dragon, but never\r\nlaid eggs. Bechstein further states (s. 26) that the domestic pigeon will\r\ncross with C. palumbus, Turtur risoria and T. vulgaris, but nothing is said\r\nof the fertility of the hybrids, and this would have been mentioned had the\r\nfact been ascertained. In the Zoological Gardens (MS. report to me from Mr.\r\nJames Hunt) a male hybrid from Turtur vulgaris and a domestic pigeon\r\n\"paired with several different species of pigeons and doves, but none of\r\nthe eggs were good.\" Hybrids from C. oenas and gymnophthalmos were sterile.\r\nIn Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 7 1834 page 154 it is said that a\r\nmale hybrid (from Turtur vulgaris male, and the cream-coloured T. risoria\r\nfemale) paired during two years with a female T. risoria, and the latter\r\nlaid many eggs, but all were sterile. MM. Boitard and Corbie ('Les Pigeons'\r\npage 235) state that the hybrids from these two turtle-doves are invariably\r\nsterile both inter se and with either pure parent. The experiment was tried\r\nby M. Corbie \"avec une espece d'obstination;\" and likewise by M. Mauduyt,\r\nand by M. Vieillot. Temminck also found the hybrids from these two species\r\nquite barren. Therefore, when Bechstein ('Naturgesch. Deutschlands Vogel'\r\nb. 4 s. 101) asserts that the hybrids from these two turtle-doves propagate\r\ninter se equally well with pure species, and when a writer in the 'Field'\r\nnewspaper (in a letter dated November 10th, 1858) makes a similar\r\nassertion, it would appear that there must be some mistake; though what the\r\nmistake is I know not, as Bechstein at least must have known the white\r\nvariety of T. risoria: it would be an unparalleled fact if the same two\r\nspecies sometimes produced EXTREMELY fertile, and sometimes EXTREMELY\r\nbarren, offspring. In the MS. report from the Zoological Gardens it is said\r\nthat hybrids from Turtur vulgaris and suratensis, and from T. vulgaris and\r\nEctopistes migratorius, were sterile. Two of the latter male hybrids paired\r\nwith their pure parents, viz. Turtur vulgaris and the Ectopistes, and\r\nlikewise with T. risoria and with Columba oenas, and many eggs were\r\nproduced, but all were barren. At Paris, hybrids have been raised (Isid.\r\nGeoffrey Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Generale' tome 3 page 180) from Turtur\r\nauritus with T. cambayensis and with T. suratensis; but nothing is said of\r\ntheir fertility. At the Zoological Gardens of London the Goura coronata and\r\nvictoriae produced a hybrid which paired with the pure G. coronata, and\r\nlaid several eggs, but these proved barren. In 1860 Columba gymnophthalmos\r\nand maculosa produced hybrids in these same gardens.) all the cases which I\r\nhave collected) that hardly a single well-ascertained instance is known of\r\nhybrids between two true species of pigeons being fertile, inter se, or\r\neven when crossed with one of their pure parents.\r\n\r\nSIXTHLY.\r\n\r\nExcluding certain important characteristic differences, the chief races\r\nagree most closely both with each other and with C. livia in all other\r\nrespects. As previously observed, all are eminently sociable; all dislike\r\nto perch or roost, and refuse to build in trees; all lay two eggs, and this\r\nis not a universal rule with the Columbidae; all, as far as I can hear,\r\nrequire the same time for hatching their eggs; all can endure the same\r\ngreat range of climate; all prefer the same food, and are passionately fond\r\nof salt; all exhibit (with the asserted exception of the Finnikin and\r\nTurner which do not differ much in any other character) the same peculiar\r\ngestures when courting the females; and all (with the exception of\r\nTrumpeters and Laughers, which likewise do not differ much in any other\r\ncharacter) coo in the same peculiar manner, unlike the voice of any other\r\nwild pigeon. All the coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic\r\ntints on the breast, a character far from general with pigeons. Each race\r\npresents nearly the same range of variation in colour; and in most of the\r\nraces we have the same singular correlation between the development of down\r\nin the young and the future colour of plumage. All have the proportional\r\nlength of their toes, and of their primary wing-feathers, nearly the same,-\r\n-characters which are apt to differ in the several members of the\r\nColumbidae. In those races which present some remarkable deviation of\r\nstructure, such as in the tail of Fantails, crop of Pouters, beak of\r\nCarriers and Tumblers, etc., the other parts remain nearly unaltered. Now\r\nevery naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to pick out\r\na dozen natural species in any family which should agree closely in habits\r\nand in general structure, and yet should differ greatly in a few characters\r\nalone. This fact is explicable through the doctrine of natural selection;\r\nfor each successive modification of structure in each natural species is\r\npreserved, solely because it is of service; and such modifications when\r\nlargely accumulated imply a great change in the habits of life, and this\r\nwill almost certainly lead to other changes of structure throughout the\r\nwhole organisation. On the other hand, if the several races of the pigeon\r\nhave been produced by man through selection and variation, we can readily\r\nunderstand how it is that they should still all resemble each other in\r\nhabits and in those many characters which man has not cared to modify,\r\nwhilst they differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which have\r\nstruck his eye or pleased his fancy.\r\n\r\nBesides the points above enumerated, in which all the domestic races\r\nresemble C. livia and each other, there is one which deserves special\r\nnotice. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue colour; the wings are\r\ncrossed by two bars; the croup varies in colour, being generally white in\r\nthe pigeon of Europe, and blue in that of India; the tail has a black bar\r\nclose to the end, and the outer webs of the outer tail-feathers are edged\r\nwith white, except near the tips. These combined characters are not found\r\nin any wild pigeon besides C. livia. I have looked carefully through the\r\ngreat collections of pigeons in the British Museum, and I find that a dark\r\nbar at the end of the tail is common; that the white edging to the outer\r\ntail-feathers is not rare; but that the white croup is extremely rare, and\r\nthe two black bars on the wings occur in no other pigeon, excepting the\r\nalpine C. leuconota and C. rupestris of Asia. Now if we turn to the\r\ndomestic races, it is highly remarkable, as an eminent fancier, Mr.\r\nWicking, observed to me, that, whenever a blue bird appears in any race,\r\nthe wings almost invariably show the double black bars. (6/23. There is one\r\nexception to the rule, namely, in a sub-variety of the Swallow of German\r\norigin, which is figured by Neumeister, and was shown to me by Mr. Wicking.\r\nThis bird is blue, but has not the black wing-bars; for our object,\r\nhowever, in tracing the descent of the chief races, this exception\r\nsignifies the less as the Swallow approaches closely in structure to C.\r\nlivia. In many sub-varieties the black bars are replaced by bars of various\r\ncolours. The figures given by Neumeister are sufficient to show that, if\r\nthe wings alone are blue, the black wing-bars appear.) The primary wing-\r\nfeathers may be white or black, and the whole body may be of any colour,\r\nbut if the wing-coverts are blue, the two black bars are sure to appear. I\r\nhave myself seen, or acquired trustworthy evidence, as given below (6/24. I\r\nhave observed blue birds with all the above-mentioned marks in the\r\nfollowing races, which seemed to be perfectly pure, and were shown at\r\nvarious exhibitions. Pouters, with the double black wing-bars, with white\r\ncroup, dark bar to end of tail, and white edging to outer tail-feathers.\r\nTurbits, with all these same characters. Fantails with the same; but the\r\ncroup in some was bluish or pure blue. Mr. Wicking bred blue Fantails from\r\ntwo black birds. Carriers (including the Bagadotten of Neumeister) with all\r\nthe marks: two birds which I examined had white, and two had blue croups;\r\nthe white edging to the outer tail-feathers was not present in all. Mr.\r\nCorker, a great breeder, assures me that, if black carriers are matched for\r\nmany successive generations, the offspring become first ash-coloured, and\r\nthen blue with black wing-bars. Runts of the elongated breed had the same\r\nmarks, but the croup was pale blue; the outer tail-feathers had white\r\nedges. Neumeister figures the great Florence Runt of a blue colour with\r\nblack bars. Jacobins are very rarely blue, but I have received authentic\r\naccounts of at least two instances of the blue variety with black bars\r\nhaving appeared in England; blue Jacobins were bred by Mr. Brent from two\r\nblack birds. I have seen common Tumblers, both Indian and English, and\r\nShort-faced Tumblers, of a blue colour, with black wing-bars, with the\r\nblack bar at the end of the tail, and with the outer tail-feathers edged\r\nwith white; the croup in all was blue, or extremely pale blue, never\r\nabsolutely white. Blue Barbs and Trumpeters seem to be excessively rare;\r\nbut Neumeister, who may be implicitly trusted, figures blue varieties of\r\nboth, with black wing-bars. Mr. Brent informs me that he has seen a blue\r\nBarb; and Mr. H. Weir, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, once bred a\r\nsilver (which means very pale blue) Barb from two yellow birds.), of blue\r\nbirds with black bars on the wing, with the croup either white or very pale\r\nor dark blue, with the tail having a terminal black bar, and with the outer\r\nfeathers externally edged with white or very pale coloured, in the\r\nfollowing races, which, as I carefully observed in each case, appeared to\r\nbe perfectly true: namely, in Pouters, Fantails, Tumblers, Jacobins,\r\nTurbits, Barbs, Carriers, Runts of three distinct varieties, Trumpeters,\r\nSwallows, and in many other toy-pigeons, which as being closely allied to\r\nC. livia, are not worth enumerating. Thus we see that, in purely-bred races\r\nof every kind known in Europe, blue birds occasionally appear having all\r\nthe marks which characterise C. livia, and which concur in no other wild\r\nspecies. Mr. Blyth, also, has made the same observation with respect to the\r\nvarious domestic races known in India.\r\n\r\nCertain variations in the plumage are equally common in the wild C. livia,\r\nin dovecote-pigeons, and in all the most highly modified races. Thus, in\r\nall, the croup varies from white to blue, being most frequently white in\r\nEurope, and very generally blue in India. (6/25. Mr. Blyth informs me that\r\nall the domestic races in India have the croup blue; but this is not\r\ninvariable, for I possess a very pale blue Simmali pigeon with the croup\r\nperfectly white, sent to me by Sir W. Elliot from Madras. A slaty-blue and\r\nchequered Nakshi pigeon has some white feathers on the croup alone. In some\r\nother Indian pigeons there were a few white feathers confined to the croup,\r\nand I have noticed the same fact in a carrier from Persia. The Java Fantail\r\n(imported into Amoy, and thence sent me) has a perfectly white croup.) We\r\nhave seen that the wild C. livia in Europe, and dovecotes in all parts of\r\nthe world, often have the upper wing-coverts chequered with black; and all\r\nthe most distinct races, when blue, are occasionally chequered in precisely\r\nthe same manner. Thus I have seen Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Turbits,\r\nTumblers (Indian and English), Swallows, Bald-pates, and other toy-pigeons\r\nblue and chequered; and Mr. Esquilant has seen a chequered Runt. I bred\r\nfrom two pure blue Tumblers a chequered bird.\r\n\r\nThe facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure races\r\nof blue birds with black wing-bars, and likewise of blue and chequered\r\nbirds; but it will now be seen that when two birds belonging to distinct\r\nraces are crossed, neither of which have, nor probably have had during many\r\ngenerations, a trace of blue in their plumage, or a trace of wing-bars and\r\nthe other characteristic marks, they very frequently produce mongrel\r\noffspring of a blue colour, sometimes chequered, with black wing-bars,\r\netc.; or if not of a blue colour, yet with the several characteristic marks\r\nmore or less plainly developed. I was led to investigate this subject from\r\nMM. Boitard and Corbie (6/26. 'Les Pigeons' etc. page 37.) having asserted\r\nthat from crosses between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but\r\nbisets or dovecote pigeons, which, as we know, are blue birds with the\r\nusual characteristic marks. We shall hereafter see that this subject\r\npossesses, independently of our present object, considerable interest, so\r\nthat I will give the results of my own trials in full. I selected for\r\nexperiment races which, when pure, very seldom produce birds of a blue\r\ncolour, or have bars on their wings and tail.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is white, with the head, tail, and primary wing-feathers black; it\r\nis a breed which was established as long ago as the year 1600. I crossed a\r\nmale Nun with a female red common Tumbler, which latter variety generally\r\nbreeds true. Thus neither parent had a trace of blue in the plumage, or of\r\nbars on the wing and tail. I should premise that common Tumblers are rarely\r\nblue in England. From the above cross I reared several young: one was red\r\nover the whole back, but with the tail as blue as that of the rock-pigeon;\r\nthe terminal bar, however, was absent, but the outer feathers were edged\r\nwith white: a second and third nearly resembled the first, but the tail in\r\nboth presented a trace of the bar at the end: a fourth was brownish, and\r\nthe wings showed a trace of the double bar: a fifth was pale blue over the\r\nwhole breast, back, croup, and tail, but the neck and primary wing-feathers\r\nwere reddish; the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour; the\r\ntail was not barred, but the outer feathers were edged with white. I\r\ncrossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of\r\ncomplicated descent, namely, from a black Barb, a Spot, and Almond-tumbler,\r\nso that the two young birds produced from this cross included the blood of\r\nfive varieties, none of which had a trace of blue or of wing and tail-bars:\r\none of the two young birds was brownish-black, with black wing-bars; the\r\nother was reddish-dun, with reddish wing-bars, paler than the rest of the\r\nbody, with the croup pale blue, the tail bluish with a trace of the\r\nterminal bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Eaton (6/27. 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1858 page 145.) matched two Short-\r\nfaced Tumblers, namely, a splash cock and kite hen (neither of which are\r\nblue or barred), and from the first nest he got a perfect blue bird, and\r\nfrom the second a silver or pale blue bird, both of which, in accordance\r\nwith all analogy, no doubt presented the usual characteristic marks.\r\n\r\nI crossed two male black Barbs with two female red Spots. These latter have\r\nthe whole body and wings white, with a spot on the forehead, the tail and\r\ntail-coverts red; the race existed at least as long ago as 1676, and now\r\nbreeds perfectly true, as was known to be the case in the year 1735. (6/28.\r\nJ. Moore 'Columbarium' 1735; in J.M. Eaton's edition 1852 page 71.) Barbs\r\nare uniformly-coloured birds, with rarely even a trace of bars on the wing\r\nor tail; they are known to breed very true. The mongrels thus raised were\r\nblack or nearly black, or dark or pale brown, sometimes slightly piebald\r\nwith white: of these birds no less than six presented double wing-bars; in\r\ntwo the bars were conspicuous and quite black; in seven some white feathers\r\nappeared on the croup; and in two or three there was a trace of the\r\nterminal bar to the tail, but in none were the outer tail-feathers edged\r\nwith white.\r\n\r\nI crossed black Barbs (of two excellent strains) with purely-bred, snow-\r\nwhite Fantails. The mongrels were generally quite black, with a few of the\r\nprimary wing and tail feathers white: others were dark reddish-brown, and\r\nothers snow-white: none had a trace of wing-bars or of the white croup. I\r\nthen paired together two of these mongrels, namely, a brown and black bird,\r\nand their offspring displayed wing-bars, faint, but of a darker brown than\r\nthe rest of body. In a second brood from the same parents a brown bird was\r\nproduced, with several white feathers confined to the croup.\r\n\r\nI crossed a male dun Dragon belonging to a family which had been dun-\r\ncoloured without wing-bars during several generations, with a uniform red\r\nBarb (bred from two black Barbs); and the offspring presented decided but\r\nfaint traces of wing-bars. I crossed a uniform red male Runt with a White\r\ntrumpeter; and the offspring had a slaty-blue tail with a bar at the end,\r\nand with the outer feathers edged with white. I also crossed a female black\r\nand white chequered Trumpeter (of a different strain from the last) with a\r\nmale Almond-tumbler, neither of which exhibited a trace of blue, or of the\r\nwhite croup, or of the bar at end of tail: nor is it probable that the\r\nprogenitors of these two birds had for many generations exhibited any of\r\nthese characters, for I have never even heard of a blue Trumpeter in this\r\ncountry, and my Almond-tumbler was purely bred; yet the tail of this\r\nmongrel was bluish, with a broad black bar at the end, and the croup was\r\nperfectly white. It may be observed in several of these cases, that the\r\ntail first shows a tendency to become by reversion blue; and this fact of\r\nthe persistency of colour in the tail and tail-coverts (6/29. I could give\r\nnumerous examples; two will suffice. A mongrel, whose four grandparents\r\nwere a white Turbit, white Trumpeter, white Fantail, and blue Pouter, was\r\nwhite all over, except a very few feathers about the head and on the wings,\r\nbut the whole tail and tail-coverts were dark bluish-grey. Another mongrel\r\nwhose four grandparents were a red Runt, white Trumpeter, white Fantail,\r\nand the same blue Pouter, was pure white all over, except the tail and\r\nupper aill-coverts, which were pale fawn, and except the faintest trace of\r\ndouble wing-bars of the same pale fawn tint.) will surprise no one who has\r\nattended to the crossing of pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe last case which I will give is the most curious. I paired a mongrel\r\nfemale Barb-fantail with a mongrel male Barb-spot; neither of which\r\nmongrels had the least blue about them. Let it be remembered that blue\r\nBarbs are excessively rare; that Spots, as has been already stated, were\r\nperfectly characterised in the year 1676, and breed perfectly true; this\r\nlikewise is the case with white Fantails, so much so that I have never\r\nheard of white Fantails throwing any other colour. Nevertheless the\r\noffspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly the same blue tint as\r\nthat of the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands over the whole back\r\nand wings; the double black wing-bars were equally conspicuous; the tail\r\nwas exactly alike in all its characters, and the croup was pure white; the\r\nhead, however, was tinted with a shade of red, evidently derived from the\r\nSpot, and was of a paler blue than in the rock-pigeon, as was the stomach.\r\nSo that two black Barbs, a red Spot, and a white Fantail, as the four\r\npurely-bred grandparents, produced a bird exhibiting the general blue\r\ncolour, together with every characteristic mark, the wild Columba livia.\r\n\r\nWith respect to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds chequered\r\nwith black, and resembling in all respects both the dovecote-pigeon and the\r\nchequered wild variety of the rock-pigeon, the statement before referred to\r\nby MM. Boitard and Corbie would almost suffice; but I will give three\r\ninstances of the appearance of such birds from crosses in which one alone\r\nof the parents or great-grandparents was blue, but not chequered. I crossed\r\na male blue Turbit with a snow-white Trumpeter, and the following year with\r\na dark, leaden-brown, Short-faced Tumbler; the offspring from the first\r\ncross were as perfectly chequered as any dovecote-pigeon; and from the\r\nsecond, so much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered\r\nrock-pigeon from Madeira. Another bird, whose great-grandparents were a\r\nwhite Trumpeter, a white Fantail, a white Red-spot, a red Runt, and a blue\r\nPouter, was slaty-blue and chequered exactly like a dovecote-pigeon. I may\r\nhere add a remark made to me by Mr. Wicking, who has had more experience\r\nthan any other person in England in breeding pigeons of various colours:\r\nnamely, that when a blue, or a blue and chequered bird, having black wing-\r\nbars, once appears in any race and is allowed to breed, these characters\r\nare so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to eradicate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief domestic\r\nraces, both when purely bred and more especially when intercrossed, to\r\nproduce offspring of a blue colour, with the same characteristic marks,\r\nvarying in the same manner, as in Columbia livia? If we admit that these\r\nraces are all descended from C. livia, no breeder will doubt that the\r\noccasional appearance of blue birds thus characterised is accounted for on\r\nthe well-known principle of \"throwing back\" or reversion. Why crossing\r\nshould give so strong a tendency to reversion, we do not with certainty\r\nknow; but abundant evidence of this fact will be given in the following\r\nchapters. It is probable that I might have bred even for a century pure\r\nblack Barbs, Spots, Nuns, white Fantails, Trumpeters, etc., without\r\nobtaining a single blue or barred bird; yet by crossing these breeds I\r\nreared in the first and second generation, during the course of only three\r\nor four years, a considerable number of young birds, more or less plainly\r\ncoloured blue, and with most of the characteristic marks. When black and\r\nwhite, or black and red birds, are crossed, it would appear that a slight\r\ntendency exists in both parents to produce blue offspring, and that this,\r\nwhen combined, overpowers the separate tendency in either parent to produce\r\nblack, or white, or red offspring.\r\n\r\nIf we reject the belief that all the races of the pigeon are the modified\r\ndescendants of C. livia, and suppose that they are descended from several\r\naboriginal stocks, then we must choose between the three following\r\nassumptions: firstly, that at least eight or nine species formerly existed\r\nwhich were aboriginally coloured in various ways, but have since varied in\r\nexactly the same manner so as to assume the colouring of C. livia; but this\r\nassumption throws not the least light on the appearance of such colours and\r\nmarks when the races are crossed. Or secondly, we may assume that the\r\naboriginal species were all coloured blue, and had the wing-bars and other\r\ncharacteristic marks of C. livia,--a supposition which is highly\r\nimprobable, as besides this one species no existing member of the\r\nColumbidae presents these combined characters; and it would not be possible\r\nto find any other instance of several species identical in plumage, yet as\r\ndifferent in important points of structure as are Pouters, Fantails,\r\nCarriers, Tumblers, etc. Or lastly, we may assume that all the races,\r\nwhether descended from C. livia or from several aboriginal species,\r\nalthough they have been bred with so much care and are so highly valued by\r\nfanciers, have all been crossed within a dozen or score of generations with\r\nC. livia, and have thus acquired their tendency to produce blue birds with\r\nthe several characteristic marks. I have said that it must be assumed that\r\neach race has been crossed with C. livia within a dozen, or, at the utmost,\r\nwithin a score of generations; for there is no reason to believe that\r\ncrossed offspring ever revert to one of their ancestors when removed by a\r\ngreater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once,\r\nthe tendency to reversion will naturally become less and less in the\r\nsucceeding generations, as in each there will be less and less of the blood\r\nof the foreign breed; but when there has been no cross with a distinct\r\nbreed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to some long-lost\r\ncharacter, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be\r\ntransmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two\r\ndistinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those who have\r\nwritten on inheritance.\r\n\r\nConsidering, on the one hand, the improbability of the three assumptions\r\nwhich have just been discussed, and, on the other hand, how simply the\r\nfacts are explained on the principle of reversion, we may conclude that the\r\noccasional appearance in all the races, both when purely bred and more\r\nespecially when crossed, of blue birds, sometimes chequered, with double\r\nwing-bars, with white or blue croups, with a bar at the end of the tail,\r\nand with the outer tail-feathers edged with white, affords an argument of\r\nthe greatest weight in favour of the view that all are descended from\r\nColumba livia, including under this name the three or four wild varieties\r\nor sub-species before enumerated.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the six foregoing arguments, which are opposed to the belief that\r\nthe chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or nine or\r\nperhaps a dozen species; for the crossing of any less number would not\r\nyield the characteristic differences between the several races. FIRSTLY,\r\nthe improbability that so many species should still exist somewhere, but be\r\nunknown to ornithologists, or that they should have become within the\r\nhistorical period extinct, although man has had so little influence in\r\nexterminating the wild C. livia. SECONDLY, the improbability of man in\r\nformer times having thoroughly domesticated and rendered fertile under\r\nconfinement so many species. THIRDLY, these supposed species having nowhere\r\nbecome feral. FOURTHLY, the extraordinary fact that man should,\r\nintentionally or by chance, have chosen for domestication several species,\r\nextremely abnormal in character; and furthermore, the points of structure\r\nwhich render these supposed species so abnormal being now highly variable.\r\nFIFTHLY, the fact of all the races, though differing in many important\r\npoints of structure, producing perfectly fertile mongrels; whilst all the\r\nhybrids which have been produced between even closely allied species in the\r\npigeon-family are sterile. SIXTHLY, the remarkable statements just given on\r\nthe tendency in all the races, both when purely bred and when crossed, to\r\nrevert in numerous minute details of colouring to the character of the wild\r\nrock-pigeon, and to vary in a similar manner. To these arguments may be\r\nadded the extreme improbability that a number of species formerly existed,\r\nwhich differed greatly from each other in some few points, but which\r\nresembled each other as closely as do the domestic races in other points of\r\nstructure, in voice, and in all their habits of life. When these several\r\nfacts and arguments are fairly taken into consideration, it would require\r\nan overwhelming amount of evidence to make us admit that the chief domestic\r\nraces are descended from several aboriginal stocks; and of such evidence\r\nthere is absolutely none.\r\n\r\nThe belief that the chief domestic races are descended from several wild\r\nstocks no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such great\r\nmodifications of structure having been effected since man first\r\ndomesticated the rock-pigeon. Nor am I surprised at any degree of\r\nhesitation in admitting their common parentage: formerly, when I went into\r\nmy aviaries and watched such birds as Pouters, Carriers, Barbs, Fantails,\r\nand Short-faced Tumblers, etc., I could not persuade myself that all had\r\ndescended from the same wild stock, and that man had consequently in one\r\nsense created these remarkable modifications. Therefore I have argued the\r\nquestion of their origin at great, and, as some will think, superfluous\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nFinally, in favour of the belief that all the races are descended from a\r\nsingle stock, we have in Columba livia a still existing and widely\r\ndistributed species, which can be and has been domesticated in various\r\ncountries. This species agrees in most points of structure and in all its\r\nhabits of life, as well as occasionally in every detail of plumage, with\r\nthe several domestic races. It breeds freely with them, and produces\r\nfertile offspring. It varies in a state of nature (6/30. It deserves\r\nnotice, as bearing on the general subject of variation, that not only C.\r\nlivia presents several wild forms, regarded by some naturalists as species\r\nand by others as sub-species or as mere varieties, but that the species of\r\nseveral allied genera are in the same predicament. This is the case, as Mr.\r\nBlyth has remarked to me, with Treron, Palumbus, and Turtur.), and still\r\nmore so when semi-domesticated, as shown by comparing the Sierra Leone\r\npigeons with those of India, or with those which apparently have run wild\r\nin Madeira. It has undergone a still greater amount of variation in the\r\ncase of the numerous toy-pigeons, which no one supposes to be descended\r\nfrom distinct species; yet some of these toy-pigeons have transmitted their\r\ncharacter truly for centuries. Why, then, should we hesitate to believe in\r\nthat greater amount of variation which is necessary for the production of\r\nthe eleven chief races? It should be borne in mind that in two of the most\r\nstrongly-marked races, namely, Carriers and Short-faced Tumblers, the\r\nextreme forms can be connected with the parent-species by graduated\r\ndifferences not greater than those which may be observed between the\r\ndovecote-pigeons inhabiting different countries, or between the various\r\nkinds of toy-pigeons,--gradations which must certainly be attributed to\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nThat circumstances have been eminently favourable for the modification of\r\nthe pigeon through variation and selection will now be shown. The earliest\r\nrecord, as has been pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius, of pigeons in a\r\ndomesticated condition, occurs in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, about 3000\r\nB.C. (6/31. 'Denkmaler' abth. 2 bl. 70.); but Mr. Birch, of the British\r\nMuseum, informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the\r\nprevious dynasty. Domestic pigeons are mentioned in Genesis, Leviticus, and\r\nIsaiah. (6/32. 'The 'Dovecote' by the Rev. E.S. Dixon 1851 pages 11-13.\r\nAdolphe Pictet (in his 'Les Origines Indo-Europeennes' 1859 page 399)\r\nstates that there are in the ancient Sanscrit language between 25 and 30\r\nnames for the pigeon, and other 15 or 16 Persian names; none of these are\r\ncommon to the European languages. This fact indicates the antiquity of the\r\ndomestication of the pigeon in the East.) In the time of the Romans, as we\r\nhear from Pliny (6/33. English translation 1601 book 10 ch. 37.), immense\r\nprices were given for pigeons; \"nay, they are come to this pass, that they\r\ncan reckon up their pedigree and race.\" In India, about the year 1600,\r\npigeons were much valued by Akber Khan: 20,000 birds were carried about\r\nwith the court, and the merchants brought valuable collections. \"The\r\nmonarch of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare breeds. His Majesty,\"\r\nsays the courtly historian, \"by crossing the breeds, which method was never\r\npractised before, has improved them astonishingly.\" (6/34. 'Ayeen Akbery'\r\ntranslated by F. Gladwin 4to edition volume 1 page 270.) Akber Khan\r\npossessed seventeen distinct kinds, eight of which were valuable for beauty\r\nalone. At about this same period of 1600 the Dutch, according to\r\nAldrovandi, were as eager about pigeons as the Romans had formerly been.\r\nThe breeds which were kept during the fifteenth century in Europe and in\r\nIndia apparently differed from each other. Tavernier, in his Travels in\r\n1677, speaks, as does Chardin in 1735, of the vast number of pigeon-houses\r\nin Persia; and the former remarks that, as Christians were not permitted to\r\nkeep pigeons, some of the vulgar actually turned Mahometans for this sole\r\npurpose. The Emperor of Morocco had his favourite keeper of pigeons, as is\r\nmentioned in Moore's treatise, published 1737. In England, from the time of\r\nWillughby in 1678 to the present day, as well as in Germany and in France,\r\nnumerous treatises have been published on the pigeon. In India, about a\r\nhundred years ago, a Persian treatise was written; and the writer thought\r\nit no light affair, for he begins with a solemn invocation, \"in the name of\r\nGod, the gracious and merciful.\" Many large towns, in Europe and the United\r\nStates, now have their societies of devoted pigeon-fanciers: at present\r\nthere are three such societies in London. In India, as I hear from Mr.\r\nBlyth, the inhabitants of Delhi and of some other great cities are eager\r\nfanciers. Mr. Layard informs me that most of the known breeds are kept in\r\nCeylon. In China, according to Mr. Swinhoe of Amoy, and Dr. Lockhart of\r\nShangai, Carriers, Fantails, Tumblers, and other varieties are reared with\r\ncare, especially by the bonzes or priests. The Chinese fasten a kind of\r\nwhistle to the tail-feathers of their pigeons, and as the flock wheels\r\nthrough the air they produce a sweet sound. In Egypt the late Abbas Pacha\r\nwas a great fancier of Fantails. Many pigeons are kept at Cairo and\r\nConstantinople, and these have lately been imported by native merchants, as\r\nI hear from Sir W. Elliot, into Southern India, and sold at high prices.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements show in how many countries, and during how long a\r\nperiod, many men have been passionately devoted to the breeding of pigeons.\r\nHear how an enthusiastic fancier at the present day writes: \"If it were\r\npossible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing amount of solace\r\nand pleasure derived from Almond Tumblers, when they begin to understand\r\ntheir properties, I should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman\r\nwould be without their aviaries of Almond Tumblers.\" (6/35. J.M. Eaton\r\n'Treatise on the Almond Tumbler' 1851; Preface page 6.) The pleasure thus\r\ntaken is of paramount importance, as it leads amateurs carefully to note\r\nand preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their fancy.\r\nPigeons are often closely confined during their whole lives; they do not\r\npartake of their naturally varied diet; they have often been transported\r\nfrom one climate to another; and all these changes in their conditions of\r\nlife would be likely to cause variability. Pigeons have been domesticated\r\nfor nearly 5000 years, and have been kept in many places, so that the\r\nnumbers reared under domestication must have been enormous: and this is\r\nanother circumstance of high importance, for it obviously favours the\r\nchance of rare modifications of structure occasionally appearing. Slight\r\nvariations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed, and, if valued,\r\nwould, owing to the following circumstances, be preserved and propagated\r\nwith unusual facility. Pigeons, differently from any other domesticated\r\nanimal, can easily be mated for life, and, though kept with other pigeons,\r\nrarely prove unfaithful to each other. Even when the male does break his\r\nmarriage-vow, he does not permanently desert his mate. I have bred in the\r\nsame aviaries many pigeons of different kinds, and never reared a single\r\nbird of an impure strain. Hence a fancier can with the greatest ease select\r\nand match his birds. He will also see the good results of his care; for\r\npigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity. He may freely reject inferior\r\nbirds, as they serve at an early age as excellent food.\r\n\r\n[HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPAL RACES OF THE PIGEON. (6/36. As in the following\r\ndiscussion I often speak of the present time, I should state that this\r\nchapter was completed in the year 1858.)\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the means and steps by which the chief races have been\r\nformed, it will be advisable to give some historical details, for more is\r\nknown of the history of the pigeon, little though this is, than of any\r\nother domesticated animal. Some of the cases are interesting as proving how\r\nlong domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the same or nearly\r\nthe same characters; and other cases are still more interesting as showing\r\nhow slowly but steadily races have been greatly modified during successive\r\ngenerations. In the last chapter I stated that Trumpeters and Laughers,\r\nboth so remarkable for their voices, seem to have been perfectly\r\ncharacterised in 1735; and Laughers were apparently known in India before\r\nthe year 1600. Spots in 1676, and Nuns in the time of Aldrovandi, before\r\n1600, were coloured exactly as they now are. Common Tumblers and Ground\r\nTumblers displayed in India, before the year 1600, the same extraordinary\r\npeculiarities of flight as at the present day, for they are well described\r\nin the 'Ayeen Akbery.' These breeds may all have existed for a much longer\r\nperiod; we know only that they were perfectly characterised at the dates\r\nabove given. The AVERAGE length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably\r\nabout five or six years; if so, some of these races have retained their\r\ncharacter perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations.\r\n\r\nPOUTERS.\r\n\r\nThese birds, as far as a very short description serves for comparison,\r\nappear to have been well characterised in Aldrovandi's time (6/37.\r\n'Ornithologie' 1600 volume 2 page 360.), before the year 1600. Length of\r\nbody and length of leg are at the present time the two chief points of\r\nexcellence. In 1735 Moore said (see Mr. J.M. Eaton's edition)--and Moore\r\nwas a first-rate fancier--that he once saw a bird with a body 20 inches in\r\nlength, \"though 17 or 18 inches is reckoned a very good length;\" and he has\r\nseen the legs very nearly 7 inches in length, yet a leg 6 1/2 or 6 3/4 long\r\n\"must be allowed to be a very good one.\" Mr. Bult, the most successful\r\nbreeder of Pouters in the world, informs me that at present (1858) the\r\nstandard length of the body is not less than 18 inches; but he has measured\r\none bird 19 inches in length, and has heard of 20 and 22 inches, but doubts\r\nthe truth of these latter statements. The standard length of the leg is now\r\n7 inches, but Mr. Bult has recently measured two of his own birds with legs\r\n7 1/2 long. So that in the 123 years which have elapsed since 1735 there\r\nhas been hardly any increase in the standard length of the body; 17 or 18\r\ninches was formerly reckoned a very good length, and now 18 inches is the\r\nminimum standard; but the length of leg seems to have increased, as Moore\r\nnever saw one quite 7 inches long; now the standard is 7, and two of Mr.\r\nBult's birds measured 7 1/2 inches in length. The extremely slight\r\nimprovement in Pouters, except in the length of the leg, during the last\r\n123 years, may be partly accounted for by the neglect which they suffered,\r\nas I am informed by Mr. Bult, until within the last 20 or 30 years. About\r\n1765 (6/38. 'A Treatise on Domestic Pigeons' dedicated to Mr. Mayor 1765\r\nPreface page 14.) there was a change of fashion, stouter and more feathered\r\nlegs being preferred to thin and nearly naked legs.\r\n\r\nFANTAILS.\r\n\r\nThe first notice of the existence of this breed is in India, before the\r\nyear 1600, as given in the 'Ayeen Akbery' (6/39. Mr. Blyth has given a\r\ntranslation of part of the 'Ayeen Akbery' in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.' volume 19 1847 page 104.); at this date, judging from Aldrovandi,\r\nthe breed was unknown in Europe. In 1677 Willughby speaks of a Fantail with\r\n26 tail-feathers; in 1735 Moore saw one with 36 feathers; and in 1824 MM.\r\nBoitard and Corbie assert that in France birds can easily be found with 42\r\ntail-feathers. In England, the number of the tail-feathers is not at\r\npresent so much regarded as their upward direction and expansion. The\r\ngeneral carriage of the bird is likewise now much valued. The old\r\ndescriptions do not suffice to show whether in these latter respects there\r\nhas been much improvement: but if Fantails with their heads and tails\r\ntouching had formerly existed, as at the present time, the fact would\r\nalmost certainly have been noticed. The Fantails which are now found in\r\nIndia probably show the state of the race, as far as carriage is concerned,\r\nat the date of their introduction into Europe; and some, said to have been\r\nbrought from Calcutta, which I kept alive, were in a marked manner inferior\r\nto our exhibition birds. The Java Fantail shows the same difference in\r\ncarriage; and although Mr. Swinhoe has counted 18 and 24 tail-feathers in\r\nhis birds, a first-rate specimen sent to me had only 14 tail-feathers.\r\n\r\nJACOBINS.\r\n\r\nThis breed existed before 1600, but the hood, judging from the figure given\r\nby Aldrovandi, did not enclose the head nearly so perfectly as at present:\r\nnor was the head then white; nor were the wings and tail so long, but this\r\nlast character might have been overlooked by the rude artist. In Moore's\r\ntime, in 1735, the Jacobin was considered the smallest kind of pigeon, and\r\nthe bill is said to be very short. Hence either the Jacobin, or the other\r\nkinds with which it was then compared, must since that time have been\r\nconsiderably modified; for Moore's description (and it must be remembered\r\nthat he was a first-rate judge) is clearly not applicable, as far as size\r\nof body and length of beak are concerned, to our present Jacobins. In 1795,\r\njudging from Bechstein, the breed had assumed its present character.\r\n\r\nTURBITS.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been supposed by the older writers on pigeons, that the\r\nTurbit is the Cortbeck of Aldrovandi; but if this be the case, it is an\r\nextraordinary fact that the characteristic frill should not have been\r\nnoticed. The beak, moreover, of the Cortbeck is described as closely\r\nresembling that of the Jacobin, which shows a change in the one or the\r\nother race. The Turbit, with its characteristic frill, and bearing its\r\npresent name, is described by Willughby in 1677; and the bill is said to be\r\nlike that of the bullfinch,--a good comparison, but now more strictly\r\napplicable to the beak of the Barb. The sub-breed called the Owl was well\r\nknown in Moore's time, in 1735.\r\n\r\nTUMBLERS.\r\n\r\nCommon Tumblers, as well as Ground Tumblers, perfect as far as tumbling is\r\nconcerned, existed in India before the year 1600; and at this period\r\ndiversified modes of flight, such as flying at night, the ascent to a great\r\nheight, and manner of descent, seem to have been much attended to in India,\r\nas at the present time. Belon (6/40. 'L'Histoire de la Nature des Oiseaux'\r\npage 314.) in 1555 saw in Paphlagonia what he describes as \"a very new\r\nthing, viz. pigeons which flew so high in the air that they were lost to\r\nview, but returned to their pigeon-house without separating.\" This manner\r\nof flight is characteristic of our present Tumblers, but it is clear that\r\nBelon would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described by\r\nhim had tumbled. Tumblers were not known in Europe in 1600, as they are not\r\nmentioned by Aldrovandi, who discusses the flight of pigeons. They are\r\nbriefly alluded to by Willughby, in 1687, as small pigeons \"which show like\r\nfootballs in the air.\" The short-faced race did not exist at this period,\r\nas Willughby could not have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small\r\nsize and short beaks. We can even trace some of the steps by which this\r\nrace has been produced. Moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief points\r\nof excellence, but does not give any description of the several sub-breeds;\r\nand from this fact Mr. Eaton infers (6/41. 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1852 page\r\n64.) that the Short-faced Tumbler had not then come to full perfection.\r\nMoore even speaks of the Jacobin as being the smallest pigeon. Thirty years\r\nafterwards, in 1765, in the Treatise dedicated to Mayor, short-faced Almond\r\nTumblers are fully described, but the author, an excellent fancier,\r\nexpressly states in his Preface (page 14) that, \"from great care and\r\nexpense in breeding them, they have arrived to so great perfection and are\r\nso different from what they were 20 or 30 years past, that an old fancier\r\nwould have condemned them for no other reason than because they are not\r\nlike what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy before.\" Hence\r\nit would appear that there was a rather sudden change in the character of\r\nthe short-faced Tumbler at about this period; and there is reason to\r\nsuspect that a dwarfed and half-monstrous bird, the parent-form of the\r\nseveral short-faced sub-breeds, then appeared. I suspect this because\r\nshort-faced Tumblers are born with their beaks (ascertained by careful\r\nmeasurement) as short, proportionally with the size of their bodies, as in\r\nthe adult bird; and in this respect they differ greatly from all other\r\nbreeds, which slowly acquire during growth their various characteristic\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief\r\ncharacters of the short-faced Tumbler, namely, in the length of the beak.\r\nFanciers measure the \"head and beak\" from the tip of the beak to the front\r\ncorner of the eyeball. About the year 1765 a \"head and beak\" was considered\r\ngood (6/42. J.M. Eaton 'Treatise on the Breeding and Managing of the Almond\r\nTumbler' 1851. Compare page 5 of Preface, page 9 and page 32), which,\r\nmeasured in the usual manner, was 7/8 of an inch in length; now it ought\r\nnot to exceed 5/8 of an inch; \"it is however possible,\" as Mr. Eaton\r\ncandidly confesses, \"for a bird to be considered as pleasant or neat even\r\nat 6/8 of an inch, but exceeding that length it must be looked upon as\r\nunworthy of attention.\" Mr. Eaton states that he has never seen in the\r\ncourse of his life more than two or three birds with the \"head and beak\"\r\nnot exceeding half an inch in length; \"still I believe in the course of a\r\nfew years that the head and beak will be shortened, and that half-inch\r\nbirds will not be considered so great a curiosity as at the present time.\"\r\nThat Mr. Eaton's opinion deserves attention cannot be doubted, considering\r\nhis success in winning prizes at our exhibitions. Finally in regard to the\r\nTumbler it may be concluded from the facts above given that it was\r\noriginally introduced into Europe, probably first into England, from the\r\nEast; and that it then resembled our common English Tumbler, or more\r\nprobably the Persian or Indian Tumbler, with a beak only just perceptibly\r\nshorter than that of the common dovecote-pigeon. With respect to the short-\r\nfaced Tumbler, which is not known to exist in the East, there can hardly be\r\na doubt that the whole wonderful change in the size of the head, beak, body\r\nand feet, and in general carriage, has been produced during the last two\r\ncenturies by continued selection, aided probably by the birth of a semi-\r\nmonstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750.\r\n\r\nRUNTS.\r\n\r\nOf their history little can be said. In the time of Pliny the pigeons of\r\nCampania were the largest known; and from this fact alone some authors\r\nassert that they were Runts. In Aldrovandi's time, in 1600, two sub-breeds\r\nexisted; but one of them, the short-beaked, is now extinct in Europe.\r\n\r\nBARBS.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding statements to the contrary, it seems to me impossible to\r\nrecognise the Barb in Aldrovandi's description and figures; four breeds,\r\nhowever, existed in the year 1600 which evidently were allied both to Barbs\r\nand Carriers. To show how difficult it is to recognise some of the breeds\r\ndescribed by Aldrovandi I will give the different opinions in regard to the\r\nabove four kinds, named by him C. indica, cretensis, gutturosa, and\r\npersica. Willughby thought that the Columba indica was a Turbit, but the\r\neminent fancier Mr. Brent believes that it was an inferior Barb: C.\r\ncretensis, with a short beak and a swelling on the upper mandible, cannot\r\nbe recognised: C. (falsely called) gutturosa, which from its rostrum,\r\nbreve, crassum, et tuberosum seems to me to come nearest to the Barb, Mr.\r\nBrent believes to be a Carrier; and lastly, the C. persica et turcica, Mr.\r\nBrent thinks, and I quite concur with him, was a short-beaked Carrier with\r\nvery little wattle. In 1687 the Barb was known in England, and Willughby\r\ndescribes the beak as like that of the Turbit; but it is not credible that\r\nhis Barbs should have had a beak like that of our present birds, for so\r\naccurate an observer could not have overlooked its great breadth.\r\n\r\nENGLISH CARRIER.\r\n\r\nWe may look in vain in Aldrovandi's work for any bird resembling our prize\r\nCarriers; the C. persica et turcica of this author comes the nearest, but\r\nis said to have had a short thick beak; therefore it must have approached\r\nin character a Barb, and have differed greatly from our Carriers. In\r\nWillughby's time, in 1677, we can clearly recognise the Carrier, yet he\r\nadds, \"the bill is not short, but of a moderate length;\" a description\r\nwhich no one would apply to our present Carriers, so conspicuous for the\r\nextraordinary length of their beaks. The old names given in Europe to the\r\nCarrier, and the several names now in use in India, indicate that Carriers\r\noriginally came from Persia; and Willughby's description would perfectly\r\napply to the Bussorah Carrier as it now exists in Madras. In later times we\r\ncan partially trace the progress of change in our English Carriers: Moore,\r\nin 1735, says \"an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak, though there are\r\nvery good Carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a quarter.\"\r\nThese birds must have resembled or perhaps been a little superior to the\r\nCarriers, previously described, now found in Persia. In England at the\r\npresent day \"there are,\" as Mr. Eaton (6/43. 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1852\r\npage 41.) states, \"beaks that would measure (from edge of eye to tip of\r\nbeak) one inch and three-quarters, and some few even two inches in\r\nlength.\"]\r\n\r\nFrom these historical details we see that nearly all the chief domestic\r\nraces existed before the year 1600. Some remarkable only for colour appear\r\nto have been identical with our present breeds, some were nearly the same,\r\nsome considerably different, and some have since become extinct. Several\r\nbreeds, such as Finnikins and Turners, the swallow-tailed pigeon of\r\nBechstein and the Carmelite, seem to have originated and to have\r\ndisappeared within this same period. Any one now visiting a well-stocked\r\nEnglish aviary would certainly pick out as the most distinct kinds, the\r\nmassive Runt, the Carrier with its wonderfully elongated beak and great\r\nwattles, the Barb with its short broad beak and eye-wattles, the short-\r\nfaced Tumbler with its small conical beak, the Pouter with its great crop,\r\nlong legs and body, the Fantail with its upraised, widely-expanded, well-\r\nfeathered tail, the Turbit with its frill and short blunt beak, and the\r\nJacobin with his hood. Now, if this same person could have viewed the\r\npigeons kept before 1600 by Akber Khan in India and by Aldrovandi in\r\nEurope, he would have seen the Jacobin with a less perfect hood; the Turbit\r\napparently without its frill; the Pouter with shorter legs, and in every\r\nway less remarkable--that is, if Aldrovandi's Pouter resembled the old\r\nGerman kind; the Fantail would have been far less singular in appearance,\r\nand would have had much fewer feathers in its tail; he would have seen\r\nexcellent flying Tumblers, but he would in vain have looked for the\r\nmarvellous short-faced breeds; he would have seen birds allied to Barbs,\r\nbut it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met with our actual\r\nBarbs; and lastly, he would have found Carriers with beaks and wattle\r\nincomparably less developed than in our English Carriers. He might have\r\nclassed most of the breeds in the same groups as at present; but the\r\ndifferences between the groups were then far less strongly pronounced than\r\nat present. In short, the several breeds had at this early period not\r\ndiverged in so great a degree as now from their aboriginal common parent,\r\nthe wild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nMANNER OF FORMATION OF THE CHIEF RACES.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider more closely the probable steps by which the chief\r\nraces have been formed. As long as pigeons are kept semi-domesticated in\r\ndovecotes in their native country, without any care in selecting and\r\nmatching them, they are liable to little more variation than the wild C.\r\nlivia, namely, in the wings becoming chequered with black, in the croup\r\nbeing blue or white, and in the size of the body. When, however, dovecote-\r\npigeons are transported into diversified countries, such as Sierra Leone,\r\nthe Malay archipelago, and Madeira, they are exposed to new conditions of\r\nlife; and apparently in consequence vary in a somewhat greater degree. When\r\nclosely confined, either for the pleasure of watching them, or to prevent\r\ntheir straying, they must be exposed, even in their native climate, to\r\nconsiderably different conditions; for they cannot obtain their natural\r\ndiversity of food; and, what is probably more important, they are\r\nabundantly fed, whilst debarred from taking much exercise. Under these\r\ncircumstances we might expect to find, from the analogy of all other\r\ndomesticated animals, a greater amount of individual variability than with\r\nthe wild pigeon; and this is the case. The want of exercise apparently\r\ntends to reduce the size of the feet and organs of flight; and then, from\r\nthe law of correlation of growth, the beak apparently becomes affected.\r\nFrom what we now see occasionally taking place in our aviaries, we may\r\nconclude that sudden variations or sports, such as the appearance of a\r\ncrest of feathers on the head, of feathered feet, of a new shade of colour,\r\nof an additional feather in the tail or wing, would occur at rare intervals\r\nduring the many centuries which have elapsed since the pigeon was first\r\ndomesticated. At the present day such \"sports\" are generally rejected as\r\nblemishes; and there is so much mystery in the breeding of pigeons that, if\r\na valuable sport did occur, its history would often be concealed. Before\r\nthe last hundred and fifty years, there is hardly a chance of the history\r\nof any such sport having been recorded. But it by no means follows from\r\nthis that such sports in former times, when the pigeon had undergone much\r\nless variation, would have been rejected. We are profoundly ignorant of the\r\ncause of each sudden and apparently spontaneous variation, as well as of\r\nthe infinitely numerous shades of difference between the birds of the same\r\nfamily. But in a future chapter we shall see that all such variations\r\nappear to be the indirect result of changes of some kind in the conditions\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nHence, after a long course of domestication, we might expect to see in the\r\npigeon much individual variability, and occasional sudden variations, as\r\nwell as slight modifications from the lessened use of certain parts,\r\ntogether with the effects of correlation of growth. But without selection\r\nall this would produce only a trifling or no result; for without such aid\r\ndifferences of all kinds would, from the two following causes, soon\r\ndisappear. In a healthy and vigorous lot of pigeons many more young birds\r\nare killed for food or die than are reared to maturity; so that an\r\nindividual having any peculiar character, if not selected, would run a good\r\nchance of being destroyed; and if not destroyed, the peculiarity in\r\nquestion would generally be obliterated by free intercrossing. It might,\r\nhowever, occasionally happen that the same variation repeatedly occurred,\r\nowing to the action of peculiar and uniform conditions of life, and in this\r\ncase it would prevail independently of selection. But when selection is\r\nbrought into play all is changed; for this is the foundation-stone in the\r\nformation of new races; and with the pigeon, circumstances, as we have\r\nalready seen, are eminently favourable for selection. When a bird\r\npresenting some conspicuous variation has been preserved, and its offspring\r\nhave been selected, carefully matched, and again propagated, and so onwards\r\nduring successive generations, the principle is so obvious that nothing\r\nmore need be said about it. This may be called METHODICAL SELECTION, for\r\nthe breeder has a distinct object in view, namely, to preserve some\r\ncharacter which has actually appeared; or to create some improvement\r\nalready pictured in his mind.\r\n\r\nAnother form of selection has hardly been noticed by those authors who have\r\ndiscussed this subject, but is even more important. This form may be called\r\nUNCONSCIOUS SELECTION, for the breeder selects his birds unconsciously,\r\nunintentionally, and without method, yet he surely though slowly produces a\r\ngreat result. I refer to the effects which follow from each fancier at\r\nfirst procuring and afterwards rearing as good birds as he can, according\r\nto his skill, and according to the standard of excellence at each\r\nsuccessive period. He does not wish permanently to modify the breed; he\r\ndoes not look to the distant future, or speculate on the final result of\r\nthe slow accumulation during many generations of successive slight changes;\r\nhe is content if he possesses a good stock, and more than content if he can\r\nbeat his rivals. The fancier in the time of Aldrovandi, when in the year\r\n1600 he admired his own Jacobins, Pouters, or Carriers, never reflected\r\nwhat their descendants in the year 1860 would become: he would have been\r\nastonished could he have seen our Jacobins, our improved English Carriers,\r\nand our Pouters; he would probably have denied that they were the\r\ndescendants of his own once-admired stock, and he would perhaps not have\r\nvalued them, for no other reason, as was written in 1765, \"than because\r\nthey were not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy.\"\r\nNo one will attribute the lengthened beak of the Carrier, the shortened\r\nbeak of the Short-faced Tumbler, the lengthened leg of the Pouter, the more\r\nperfectly enclosed hood of the Jacobin, etc.--changes effected since the\r\ntime of Aldrovandi, or even since a much later period,--to the direct and\r\nimmediate action of the conditions of life. For these several races have\r\nbeen modified in various and even in directly opposite ways, though kept\r\nunder the same climate and treated in all respects in as nearly uniform a\r\nmanner as possible. Each slight change in the length or shortness of the\r\nbeak, in the length of leg, etc., has no doubt been indirectly and remotely\r\ncaused by some change in the conditions to which the bird has been\r\nsubjected, but we must attribute the final result, as is manifest in those\r\ncases of which we have any historical record, to the continued selection\r\nand accumulation of many slight successive variations.\r\n\r\nThe action of unconscious selection, as far as pigeons are concerned,\r\ndepends on a universal principle in human nature, namely, on our rivalry,\r\nand desire to outdo our neighbours. We see this in every fleeting fashion,\r\neven in our dress, and it leads the fancier to endeavour to exaggerate\r\nevery peculiarity in his breeds. A great authority on pigeons (6/44. Eaton\r\n'Treatise on Pigeons' 1858 page 86.), says, \"Fanciers do not and will not\r\nadmire a medium standard, that is, half and half, which is neither here nor\r\nthere, but admire extremes.\" After remarking that the fancier of Short-\r\nfaced Beard Tumblers wishes for a very short beak, and that the fancier of\r\nLong-faced Beard Tumblers wishes for a very long beak, he says, with\r\nrespect to one of intermediate length, \"Don't deceive yourself. Do you\r\nsuppose for a moment the short or the long-faced fancier would accept such\r\na bird as a gift? Certainly not; the short-faced fancier could see no\r\nbeauty in it; the long-faced fancier would swear there was no use in it,\r\netc.\" In these comical passages, written seriously, we see the principle\r\nwhich has ever guided fanciers, and has led to such great modifications in\r\nall the domestic races which are valued solely for their beauty or\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nFashions in pigeon-breeding endure for long periods; we cannot change the\r\nstructure of a bird as quickly as we can the fashion of our dress. In the\r\ntime of Aldrovandi, no doubt the more the pouter inflated his crop, the\r\nmore he was valued. Nevertheless, fashions do to a certain extent change;\r\nfirst one point of structure and then another is attended to; or different\r\nbreeds are admired at different times and in different countries. As the\r\nauthor just quoted remarks, \"the fancy ebbs and flows; a thorough fancier\r\nnow-a-days never stoops to breed toy-birds;\" yet these very \"toys\" are now\r\nmost carefully bred in Germany. Breeds which at the present time are highly\r\nvalued in India are considered worthless in England. No doubt, when breeds\r\nare neglected, they degenerate; still we may believe that, as long as they\r\nare kept under the same conditions of life, characters once gained will be\r\npartially retained for a long time, and may form the starting-point for a\r\nfuture course of selection.\r\n\r\nLet it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious selection\r\nthat fanciers would not observe or care for extremely slight differences.\r\nThose alone who have associated with fanciers can be thoroughly aware of\r\ntheir accurate powers of discrimination acquired by long practice, and of\r\nthe care and labour which they bestow on their birds. I have known a\r\nfancier deliberately study his birds day after day to settle which to match\r\ntogether and which to reject. Observe how difficult the subject appears to\r\none of the most eminent and experienced fanciers. Mr. Eaton, the winner of\r\nmany prizes, says, \"I would here particularly guard you against keeping too\r\ngreat a variety of pigeons, otherwise you will know a little about all the\r\nkinds, but nothing about one as it ought to be known.\" \"It is possible\r\nthere may be a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the\r\nseveral fancy pigeons, but there are many who labour under the delusion of\r\nsupposing they know what they do not.\" Speaking exclusively of one sub-\r\nvariety of one race, namely, the short-faced almond tumbler, and after\r\nsaying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to obtain a good head\r\nand beak, and that other fanciers sacrifice everything for plumage, he\r\nremarks: \"Some young fanciers who are over covetous go in for all the five\r\nproperties at once, and they have their reward by getting nothing.\" In\r\nIndia, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, pigeons are likewise selected and matched\r\nwith the greatest care. We must not judge of the slight divergences from\r\nexisting varieties which would have been valued in ancient days, by those\r\nwhich are now valued after the formation of so many races, each with its\r\nown standard of perfection, kept uniform by our numerous Exhibitions. The\r\nambition of the most energetic fancier may be fully satisfied by the\r\ndifficulty of excelling other fanciers in the breeds already established,\r\nwithout trying to form a new one.\r\n\r\nA difficulty with respect to the power of selection will perhaps already\r\nhave occurred to the reader, namely, what could have led fanciers first to\r\nattempt to make such singular breeds as Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, etc.?\r\nBut it is this very difficulty which the principle of unconscious selection\r\nremoves. Undoubtedly no fancier ever did intentionally make such an\r\nattempt. All that we need suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently\r\nmarked to catch the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier, and then\r\nunconscious selection carried on for many generations, that is, the wish of\r\nsucceeding fanciers to excel their rivals, would do the rest. In the case\r\nof the Fantail we may suppose that the first progenitor of the breed had a\r\ntail only slightly erected, as may now be seen in certain Runts (6/45. See\r\nNeumeister's figure of the Florence Runt, tab. 13 in 'Das Ganze der\r\nTaubenzucht.') with some increase in the number of the tail-feathers, as\r\nnow occasionally occurs with Nuns. In the case of the Pouter we may suppose\r\nthat some bird inflated its crop a little more than other pigeons, as is\r\nnow the case in a slight degree with the oesophagus of the Turbit. We do\r\nnot know the origin of the common Tumbler, but we may suppose that a bird\r\nwas born with some affection of the brain, leading it to make somersaults\r\nin the air (6/46. Mr. W.J. Moore gives a full account of the Ground\r\nTumblers of India ('Indian Medical Gazette' January and February 1873), and\r\nsays the pricking the base of the brain, and giving hydrocyanic acid,\r\ntogether with strychnine, to an ordinary pigeon, brings on convulsive\r\nmovements exactly like those of a Tumbler. One pigeon, the brain of which\r\nhad been pricked, completely recovered, and ever afterwards occasionally\r\nmade somersaults.) and before the year 1600 pigeons remarkable for their\r\ndiversified manner of flight were much valued in India, and by the order of\r\nthe Emperor Akber Khan were sedulously trained and carefully matched.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases we have supposed that a sudden variation,\r\nconspicuous enough to catch a fancier's eye, first appeared; but even this\r\ndegree of abruptness in the process of variation is not necessary for the\r\nformation of a new breed. When the same kind of pigeon has been kept pure,\r\nand has been bred during a long period by two or more fanciers, slight\r\ndifferences in the strain can often be recognised. Thus I have seen first-\r\nrate Jacobins in one man's possession which certainly differed slightly in\r\nseveral characters from those kept by another. I possessed some excellent\r\nBarbs descended from a pair which had won a prize, and another lot\r\ndescended from a stock formerly kept by that famous fancier Sir John\r\nSebright, and these plainly differed in the form of the beak; but the\r\ndifferences were so slight that they could hardly be given by words. Again,\r\nthe common English and Dutch Tumbler differ in a somewhat greater degree,\r\nboth in length of beak and shape of head. What first caused these slight\r\ndifferences cannot be explained any more than why one man has a long nose\r\nand another a short one. In the strains long kept distinct by different\r\nfanciers, such differences are so common that they cannot be accounted for\r\nby the accident of the birds first chosen for breeding having been\r\noriginally as different as they now are. The explanation no doubt lies in\r\nselection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each case;\r\nfor no two fanciers have exactly the same taste, and consequently no two,\r\nin choosing and carefully matching their birds, prefer or select exactly\r\nthe same. As each man naturally admires his own birds, he goes on\r\ncontinually exaggerating by selection whatever slight peculiarities they\r\nmay possess. This will more especially happen with fanciers living in\r\ndifferent countries, who do not compare their stocks or aim at a common\r\nstandard of perfection. Thus, when a mere strain has once been formed,\r\nunconscious selection steadily tends to augment the amount of difference,\r\nand thus converts the strain into a sub-breed and this ultimately into a\r\nwell-marked breed or race.\r\n\r\nThe principle of correlation of growth should never be lost sight of. Most\r\npigeons have small feet, apparently caused by their lessened use, and from\r\ncorrelation, as it would appear, their beaks have likewise become reduced\r\nin length. The beak is a conspicuous organ, and, as soon as it had thus\r\nbecome perceptibly shortened, fanciers would almost certainly strive to\r\nreduce it still more by the continued selection of birds with the shortest\r\nbeaks; whilst at the same time other fanciers, as we know has actually been\r\nthe case, would in other sub-breeds, strive to increase its length. With\r\nthe increased length of the beak, the tongue becomes greatly lengthened, as\r\ndo the eyelids with the increased development of the eye-wattles; with the\r\nreduced or increased size of the feet, the number of the scutellae vary;\r\nwith the length of the wing, the number of the primary wing-feathers\r\ndiffer; and with the increased length of the body in the pouter the number\r\nof the sacral vertebrae is augmented. These important and correlated\r\ndifferences of structure do not invariably characterise any breed; but if\r\nthey had been attended to and selected with as much care as the more\r\nconspicuous external differences, there can hardly be a doubt that they\r\nwould have been rendered constant. Fanciers could assuredly have made a\r\nrace of Tumblers with nine instead of ten primary wing-feathers, seeing how\r\noften the number nine appears without any wish on their part, and indeed in\r\nthe case of the white-winged varieties in opposition to their wish. In a\r\nsimilar manner, if the vertebrae had been visible and had been attended to\r\nby fanciers, assuredly an additional number might easily have been fixed in\r\nthe Pouter. If these latter characters had once been rendered constant, we\r\nshould never have suspected that they had at first been highly variable, or\r\nthat they had arisen from correlation, in the one case with the shortness\r\nof the wings, and in the other case with the length of the body.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the chief domestic races have become distinctly\r\nseparated from each other, it is important to bear in mind, that fanciers\r\nconstantly try to breed from the best birds, and consequently that those\r\nwhich are inferior in the requisite qualities are in each generation\r\nneglected; so that after a time the less improved parent-stocks and many\r\nsubsequently formed intermediate grades become extinct. This has occurred\r\nin the case of the Pouter, Turbit, and Trumpeter, for these highly improved\r\nbreeds are now left without any links closely connecting them either with\r\neach other or with the aboriginal rock-pigeon. In other countries, indeed,\r\nwhere the same care has not been applied, or where the same fashion has not\r\nprevailed, the earlier forms may long remain unaltered, or altered only in\r\na slight degree, and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the\r\nconnecting links. This is the case in Persia and India with the Tumbler and\r\nCarrier, which there differ but slightly from the rock-pigeon in the\r\nproportions of their beaks. So again in Java, the Fantail sometimes has\r\nonly fourteen caudal feathers, and the tail is much less elevated and\r\nexpanded than in our improved birds; so that the Java bird forms a link\r\nbetween a first-rate Fantail and the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a breed may be retained for some particular quality in a\r\nnearly unaltered condition in the same country, together with highly\r\nmodified off-shoots or sub-breeds, which are valued for some distinct\r\nproperty. We see this exemplified in England, where the common Tumbler,\r\nwhich is valued only for its flight, does not differ much from its parent-\r\nform, the Eastern Tumbler; whereas the Short-faced Tumbler has been\r\nprodigiously modified, from being valued, not for its flight, but for other\r\nqualities. But the common-flying Tumbler of Europe has already begun to\r\nbranch out into slightly different sub-breeds, such as the common English\r\nTumbler, the Dutch Roller, the Glasgow House-tumbler, and the Long-faced\r\nBeard Tumbler, etc.; and in the course of centuries, unless fashions\r\ngreatly change, these sub-breeds will diverge through the slow and\r\ninsensible process of unconscious selection, and become modified, in a\r\ngreater and greater degree. After a time the perfectly graduated links\r\nwhich now connect all these sub-breeds together, will be lost, for there\r\nwould be no object and much difficulty in retaining such a host of\r\nintermediate sub-varieties.\r\n\r\nThe principle of divergence, together with the extinction of the many\r\npreviously existing intermediate forms, is so important for understanding\r\nthe origin of domestic races, as well as of species in a state of nature,\r\nthat I will enlarge a little more on this subject. Our third main group\r\nincludes Carriers, Barbs, and Runts, which are plainly related to one\r\nanother, yet wonderfully distinct in several important characters.\r\nAccording to the view given in the last chapter, these three races have\r\nprobably descended from an unknown race having an intermediate character,\r\nand this race from the rock-pigeon. Their characteristic differences are\r\nbelieved to be due to different breeders having at an early period admired\r\ndifferent points of structure; and then, on the acknowledged principle of\r\nadmiring extremes, having gone on breeding, without any thought of the\r\nfuture, as good birds as they could,--Carrier-fanciers preferring long\r\nbeaks with much wattle,--Barb-fanciers preferring short thick beaks with\r\nmuch eye-wattle,--and Runt-fanciers not caring about the beak or wattle,\r\nbut only for the size and weight of the body. This process would have led\r\nto the neglect and final extinction of the earlier, inferior, and\r\nintermediate birds; and thus it has come to pass, that in Europe these\r\nthree races are now so extraordinarily distinct from each other. But in the\r\nEast, whence they were originally brought, the fashion has been different,\r\nand we there see breeds which connect the highly modified English Carrier\r\nwith the rock-pigeon, and others which to a certain extent connect Carriers\r\nand Runts. Looking back to the time of Aldrovandi, we find that there\r\nexisted in Europe, before the year 1600, four breeds which were closely\r\nallied to Carriers and Barbs, but which competent authorities cannot now\r\nidentify with our present Barbs and Carriers; nor can Aldrovandi's Runts be\r\nidentified with our present Runts. These four breeds certainly did not\r\ndiffer from each other nearly so much as do our existing English Carriers,\r\nBarbs, and Runts. All this is exactly what might have been anticipated. If\r\nwe could collect all the pigeons which have ever lived, from before the\r\ntime of the Romans to the present day, we should be able to group them in\r\nseveral lines, diverging from the parent rock-pigeon. Each line would\r\nconsist of almost insensible steps, occasionally broken by some slightly\r\ngreater variation or sport, and each would culminate in one of our present\r\nhighly modified forms. Of the many former connecting links, some would be\r\nfound to have become absolutely extinct without having left any issue,\r\nwhilst others, though extinct, would be recognised as the progenitors of\r\nthe existing races.\r\n\r\nI have heard it remarked as a strange circumstance that we occasionally\r\nhear of the local or complete extinction of domestic races, whilst we hear\r\nnothing of their origin. How, it has been asked, can these losses be\r\ncompensated, and more than compensated, for we know that with almost all\r\ndomesticated animals the races have largely increased in number since the\r\ntime of the Romans? But on the view here given, we can understand this\r\napparent contradiction. The extinction of a race within historical times is\r\nan event likely to be noticed; but its gradual and scarcely sensible\r\nmodification through unconscious selection, and its subsequent divergence,\r\neither in the same or more commonly in distant countries, into two or more\r\nstrains, and their gradual conversion into sub-breeds, and these into well-\r\nmarked breeds are events which would rarely be noticed. The death of a\r\ntree, that has attained gigantic dimensions, is recorded; the slow growth\r\nof smaller trees and their increase in number excite no attention.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the belief in the great power of selection, and of the\r\nlittle direct power of changed conditions of life, except in causing\r\ngeneral variability or plasticity of organisation, it is not surprising\r\nthat dovecote-pigeons have remained unaltered from time immemorial; and\r\nthat some toy-pigeons, which differ in little else besides colour from the\r\ndovecote-pigeon, have retained the same character for several centuries.\r\nFor when one of these toy-pigeons had once become beautifully and\r\nsymmetrically coloured,--when, for instance, a Spot had been produced with\r\nthe crown of its head, its tail, and tail-coverts of a uniform colour, the\r\nrest of the body being snow-white,--no alteration or improvement would be\r\ndesired. On the other hand, it is not surprising that during this same\r\ninterval of time our highly-bred pigeons have undergone an astonishing\r\namount of change; for in regard to them there is no defined limit to the\r\nwish of the fancier, and there is no known limit to the variability of\r\ntheir characters. What is there to stop the fancier desiring to give to his\r\nCarrier a longer and longer beak, or to his Tumbler a shorter and shorter\r\nbeak? nor has the extreme limit of variability in the beak, if there be any\r\nsuch limit, as yet been reached. Notwithstanding the great improvement\r\neffected within recent times in the Short-faced Almond Tumbler, Mr. Eaton\r\nremarks, \"the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it was one\r\nhundred years ago;\" but this is perhaps an exaggerated assertion, for the\r\nyoung of all highly-improved fancy birds are extremely liable to disease\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nI have heard it objected that the formation of the several domestic races\r\nof the pigeon throws no light on the origin of the wild species of the\r\nColumbidae, because their differences are not of the same nature. The\r\ndomestic races, for instance do not differ, or differ hardly at all, in the\r\nrelative lengths and shape of the primary wing-feathers, in the relative\r\nlength of the hind toe, or in habits of life, as in roosting and building\r\nin trees. But the above objection shows how completely the principle of\r\nselection has been misunderstood. It is not likely that characters selected\r\nby the caprice of man should resemble differences preserved under natural\r\nconditions either from being of direct service to each species, or from\r\nstanding in correlation with other modified and serviceable structures.\r\nUntil man selects birds differing in the relative length of the wing-\r\nfeathers or toes, etc., no sensible change in these parts should be\r\nexpected. Nor could man do anything unless these parts happened to vary\r\nunder domestication: I do not positively assert that this is the case,\r\nalthough I have seen traces of such variability in the wing-feathers, and\r\ncertainly in the tail-feathers. It would be a strange fact if the relative\r\nlength of the hind toe should never vary, seeing how variable the foot is\r\nboth in size and in the number of the scutellae. With respect to the\r\ndomestic races not roosting or building in trees, it is obvious that\r\nfanciers would never attend to or select such changes in habits; but we\r\nhave seen that the pigeons in Egypt, which do not for some reason like\r\nsettling on the low mud hovels of the natives, are led, apparently by\r\ncompulsion, to perch in crowds on the trees. We may even affirm that, if\r\nour domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above\r\nspecified respects, and it could be shown that fanciers had never attended\r\nto such points, or that they did not stand in correlation with other\r\nselected characters, the fact, on the principles advocated in this chapter,\r\nwould have offered a serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly sum up the last two chapters on the pigeon. We may conclude\r\nwith confidence that all the domestic races, notwithstanding their great\r\namount of difference, are descended from the Columba livia, including under\r\nthis name certain wild races. But the differences between the latter throw\r\nno light whatever on the characters which distinguish the domestic races.\r\nIn each breed or sub-breed the individual birds are more variable than\r\nbirds in a state of nature; and occasionally they vary in a sudden and\r\nstrongly-marked manner. This plasticity of organisation apparently results\r\nfrom changed conditions of life. Disuse has reduced certain parts of the\r\nbody. Correlation of growth so ties the organisation together, that when\r\none part varies other parts vary at the same time. When several breeds have\r\nonce been formed, their intercrossing aids the progress of modification,\r\nand has even produced new sub-breeds. But as, in the construction of a\r\nbuilding, mere stones or bricks are of little avail without the builder's\r\nart, so, in the production of new races, selection has been the presiding\r\npower. Fanciers can act by selection on excessively slight individual\r\ndifferences, as well as on those greater differences which are called\r\nsports. Selection is followed methodically when the fancier tries to\r\nimprove and modify a breed according to a prefixed standard of excellence;\r\nor he acts unmethodically and unconsciously, by merely trying to rear as\r\ngood birds as he can, without any wish or intention to alter the breed. The\r\nprogress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect and ultimate\r\nextinction of the earlier and less improved forms, as well as of many\r\nintermediate links in each long line of descent. Thus it has come to pass\r\nthat most of our present races are so marvellously distinct from each\r\nother, and from the aboriginal rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VII.\r\n\r\nFOWLS.\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHIEF BREEDS.\r\nARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR DESCENT FROM SEVERAL SPECIES.\r\nARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ALL THE BREEDS HAVING DESCENDED FROM GALLUS BANKIVA.\r\nREVERSION TO THE PARENT-STOCK IN COLOUR.\r\nANALOGOUS VARIATIONS.\r\nANCIENT HISTORY OF THE FOWL.\r\nEXTERNAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL BREEDS.\r\nEGGS.\r\nCHICKENS.\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS.\r\nWING-AND TAIL-FEATHERS, VOICE, DISPOSITION, ETC.\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE SKULL, VERTEBRAE, ETC.\r\nEFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON CERTAIN PARTS.\r\nCORRELATION OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nAs some naturalists may not be familiar with the chief breeds of the fowl,\r\nit will be advisable to give a condensed description of them. (7/1. I have\r\ndrawn up this brief synopsis from various sources, but chiefly from\r\ninformation given me by Mr. Tegetmeier. This gentleman has kindly looked\r\nthrough this chapter; and from his well-known knowledge, the statements\r\nhere given may be fully trusted. Mr. Tegetmeier has likewise assisted me in\r\nevery possible way in obtaining for me information and specimens. I must\r\nnot let this opportunity pass without expressing my cordial thanks to Mr.\r\nB.P. Brent, a well-known writer on poultry, for continuous assistance and\r\nthe gift of many specimens.) From what I have read and seen of specimens\r\nbrought from several quarters of the world, I believe that most of the\r\nchief kinds have been imported into England, but many sub-breeds are\r\nprobably still unknown here. The following discussion on the origin of the\r\nvarious breeds and on their characteristic differences does not pretend to\r\ncompleteness, but may be of some interest to the naturalist. The\r\nclassification of the breeds cannot, as far as I can see, be made natural.\r\nThey differ from each other in different degrees, and do not afford\r\ncharacters in subordination to each other, by which they can be ranked in\r\ngroup under group. They seem all to have diverged by independent and\r\ndifferent roads from a single type. Each chief breed includes differently\r\ncoloured sub-varieties, most of which can be truly propagated, but it would\r\nbe superfluous to describe them. I have classed the various crested fowls\r\nas sub-breeds under the Polish fowl; but I have great doubts whether this\r\nis a natural arrangement, showing true affinity or blood relationship. It\r\nis scarcely possible to avoid laying stress on the commonness of a breed;\r\nand if certain foreign sub-breeds had been largely kept in this country\r\nthey would perhaps have been raised to the rank of main-breeds. Several\r\nbreeds are abnormal in character; that is, they differ in certain points\r\nfrom all wild Gallinaceous birds. At first I made a division of the breeds\r\ninto normal and abnormal, but the result was wholly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[1. GAME BREED.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered as the typical breed, as it deviates only slightly\r\nfrom the wild Gallus bankiva, or, as perhaps more correctly named,\r\nferrugineus. Beak strong; comb single and upright. Spurs long and sharp.\r\nFeathers closely appressed to the body. Tail with the normal number of 14\r\nfeathers. Eggs often pale buff. Disposition indomitably courageous,\r\nexhibited even in the hens and chickens. An unusual number of differently\r\ncoloured varieties exist, such as black and brown-breasted reds, duckwings,\r\nblacks, whites, piles, etc., with their legs of various colours.\r\n\r\n2. MALAY BREED.\r\n\r\nBody of great size, with head, neck, and legs elongated; carriage erect;\r\ntail small, sloping downwards, generally formed of 16 feathers; comb and\r\nwattle small; ear-lobe and face red; skin yellowish; feathers closely\r\nappressed to the body; neck-hackles short, narrow, and hard. Eggs often\r\npale buff. Chickens feather late. Disposition savage. Of Eastern origin.\r\n\r\n3. COCHIN, OR SHANGAI BREED.\r\n\r\nSize great; wing feathers short, arched, much hidden in the soft downy\r\nplumage; barely capable of flight; tail short, generally formed of 16\r\nfeathers, developed at a late period in the young males; legs thick,\r\nfeathered; spurs short, thick; nail of middle toe flat and broad; an\r\nadditional toe not rarely developed; skin yellowish. Comb and wattle well\r\ndeveloped. Skull with deep medial furrow; occipital foramen, sub-\r\ntriangular, vertically elongated. Voice peculiar. Eggs rough, buff-\r\ncoloured. Disposition extremely quiet. Of Chinese origin.\r\n\r\n4. DORKING BREED.\r\n\r\nSize great; body square, compact; feet with an additional toe; comb well\r\ndeveloped, but varies much in form; wattles well developed; colour of\r\nplumage various. Skull remarkably broad between the orbits. Of English\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe white Dorking may be considered as a distinct sub-breed, being a less\r\nmassive bird.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 30. SPANISH FOWL.)\r\n\r\n5. SPANISH BREED (figure 30).\r\n\r\nTall, with stately carriage; tarsi long; comb single, deeply serrated, of\r\nimmense size; wattles largely developed; the large ear-lobes and sides of\r\nface white. Plumage black glossed with green. Do not incubate. Tender in\r\nconstitution, the comb being often injured by frost. Eggs white, smooth, of\r\nlarge size. Chickens feather late but the young cocks show their masculine\r\ncharacters, and crow at an early age. Of Mediterranean origin.\r\n\r\nThe ANDALUSIANS may be ranked as a sub-breed: they are of a slaty-blue\r\ncolour, and their chickens are well feathered. A smaller, short-legged\r\nDutch sub-breed has been described by some authors as distinct.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 31. HAMBURGH FOWL.)\r\n\r\n6. HAMBURGH BREED (figure 31).\r\n\r\nSize moderate; comb flat, produced backwards, covered with numerous small\r\npoints; wattle of moderate dimensions; ear lobe white; legs blueish, thin.\r\nDo not incubate. Skull, with the tips of the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary and with the nasal bones standing a little separate from each\r\nother; anterior margin of the frontal bones less depressed than usual.\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-breeds; the SPANGLED Hamburgh, of English origin, with\r\nthe tips of the feathers marked with a dark spot; and the PENCILLED\r\nHamburgh, of Dutch origin, with dark transverse lines across each feather,\r\nand with the body rather smaller. Both these sub-breeds include gold and\r\nsilver varieties, as well as some other sub-varieties. Black Hamburghs have\r\nbeen produced by a cross with the Spanish breed.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 32. POLISH FOWL.)\r\n\r\n7. CRESTED OR POLISH BREED (figure 32).\r\n\r\nHead with a large, rounded crest of feathers, supported on a hemispherical\r\nprotuberance of the frontal bones, which includes the anterior part of the\r\nbrain. The ascending branches of premaxillary bones and the inner nasal\r\nprocesses are much shortened. The orifice of the nostrils raised and\r\ncrescentic. Beak short. Comb absent, or small and of crescentic shape;\r\nwattles either present or replaced by a beard-like tuft of feathers. Legs\r\nleaden-blue. Sexual differences appear late in life. Do not incubate. There\r\nare several beautiful varieties which differ in colour and slightly in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nThe following sub-breeds agree in having a crest, more or less developed,\r\nwith the comb, when present, of crescentic shape. The skull presents nearly\r\nthe same remarkable peculiarities of structure as in the true Polish fowl.\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (a) SULTANS.\r\n\r\nA Turkish breed, resembling white Polish fowls with a large crest and beard\r\nwith short and well-feathered legs. The tail is furnished with additional\r\nsickle feathers. Do not incubate. (7.2. The best account of Sultans is by\r\nMiss Watts in 'The Poultry Yard' 1856 page 79. I owe to Mr. Brent's\r\nkindness the examination of some specimens of this breed.)\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (b) PTARMIGANS.\r\n\r\nAn inferior breed closely allied to the last, white, rather small, legs\r\nmuch feathered, with the crest pointed; comb small, cupped; wattles small.\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (c) GHOONDOOKS.\r\n\r\nAnother Turkish breed having an extraordinary appearance; black and\r\ntailless; crest and beard large; legs feathered. The inner processes of the\r\ntwo nasal bones come into contact with each other, owing to the complete\r\nabortion of the ascending branches of the premaxillaries. I have seen an\r\nallied white, tailless breed from Turkey.\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (D) CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\nA French breed of large size, barely capable of flight, with short black\r\nlegs, head crested, comb produced into two points or horns, sometimes a\r\nlittle branched like the horns of a stag; both beard and wattles present.\r\nEggs large. Disposition quiet. (7/3. A good description, with figures, is\r\ngiven of this sub-breed in the 'Journal of Horticulture' June 10, 1862 page\r\n206.)\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (e) HORNED FOWL.\r\n\r\nWith a small crest; comb produced into two great points, supported on two\r\nbony protuberances.\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (f) HOUDAN.\r\n\r\nA French breed; of moderate size, short-legged with five toes, well\r\ndeveloped; plumage invariably mottled with black, white, and straw-yellow;\r\nhead furnished with a crest, on a triple comb placed transversely; both\r\nwattles and beard present. (7/4. A description, with figures, is given of\r\nthis breed in 'Journal of Horticulture' June 3, 1862 page 186. Some writers\r\ndescribe the comb as two-horned.)\r\n\r\nSUB-BREED (g) GUELDERLANDS.\r\n\r\nNo comb, head said to be surmounted by a longitudinal crest of soft velvety\r\nfeathers; nostrils said to be crescentic; wattles well developed; legs\r\nfeathered; colour black. From North America. The Breda fowl seems to be\r\nclosely allied to the Guelderland.\r\n\r\n8. BANTAM BREED.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Japan (7/5. Mr. Crawfurd 'Descript. Dict. of the Indian\r\nIslands' page 113. Bantams are mentioned in an ancient native Japanese\r\nEncyclopaedia, as I am informed by Mr. Birch of the British Museum.)\r\ncharacterised by small size alone; carriage bold and erect. There are\r\nseveral sub-breeds, such as the Cochin, Game, and Sebright Bantams, some of\r\nwhich have been recently formed by various crosses. The Black Bantam has a\r\ndifferently shaped skull, with the occipital foramen like that of the\r\nCochin fowl.\r\n\r\n9. RUMPLESS FOWLS.\r\n\r\nThese are so variable in character (7/6. 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry'\r\n1848.) that they hardly deserve to be called a breed. Any one who will\r\nexamine the caudal vertebrae will see how monstrous the breed is.\r\n\r\n10. CREEPERS OR JUMPERS.\r\n\r\nThese are characterised by an almost monstrous shortness of legs, so that\r\nthey move by jumping rather than by walking; they are said not to scratch\r\nup the ground. I have examined a Burmese variety, which had a skull of\r\nrather unusual shape.\r\n\r\n11. FRIZZLED OR CAFFRE FOWLS.\r\n\r\nNot uncommon in India, with the feathers curling backwards, and with the\r\nprimary feathers of the wing and tail imperfect; periosteum of bones black.\r\n\r\n12. SILK FOWLS.\r\n\r\nFeathers silky, with the primary wing and tail-feathers imperfect; skin and\r\nperiosteum of bones black; comb and wattles dark leaden-blue; ear-lappets\r\ntinged with blue; legs thin, often furnished with an additional toe. Size\r\nrather small.\r\n\r\n13. SOOTY FOWLS.\r\n\r\nAn Indian breed, having the peculiar appearance of a white bird smeared\r\nwith soot, with black skin and periosteum. The hens alone are thus\r\ncharacterised.]\r\n\r\nFrom this synopsis we see that the several breeds differ considerably, and\r\nthey would have been nearly as interesting for us as pigeons, if there had\r\nbeen equally good evidence that all had descended from one parent-species.\r\nMost fanciers believe that they are descended from several primitive\r\nstocks. The Rev. E.S. Dixon (7/7. 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry' 1848.)\r\nargues strongly on this side of the question; and one fancier even\r\ndenounces the opposite conclusion by asking, \"Do we not perceive pervading\r\nthis spirit, the spirit of the DEIST?\" Most naturalists, with the exception\r\nof a few, such as Temminck, believe that all the breeds have proceeded from\r\na single species; but authority on such a point goes for little. Fanciers\r\nlook to all parts of the world as the possible sources of their unknown\r\nstocks; thus ignoring the laws of geographical distribution. They know well\r\nthat the several kinds breed truly even in colour. They assert, but, as we\r\nshall see, on very weak grounds, that most of the breeds are extremely\r\nancient. They are strongly impressed with the great difference between the\r\nchief kinds, and they ask with force, can differences in climate, food, or\r\ntreatment have produced birds so different as the black stately Spanish,\r\nthe diminutive elegant Bantam, the heavy Cochin with its many\r\npeculiarities, and the Polish fowl with its great top-knot and protuberant\r\nskull? But fanciers, whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of\r\ncrossing the various breeds, do not sufficiently regard the probability of\r\nthe occasional birth, during the course of centuries, of birds with\r\nabnormal and hereditary peculiarities; they overlook the effects of\r\ncorrelation of growth--of the long-continued use and disuse of parts, and\r\nof some direct result from changed food and climate, though on this latter\r\nhead I have found no sufficient evidence; and lastly, they all, as far as I\r\nknow, entirely overlook the all-important subject of unconscious or\r\nunmethodical selection, though they are well aware that their birds differ\r\nindividually and that by selecting the best birds for a few generations\r\nthey can improve their stocks.\r\n\r\nAn amateur writes (7/8. Ferguson 'Illustrated Series of Rare and Prize\r\nPoultry' 1834 page 6 Preface.) as follows: \"The fact that poultry have\r\nuntil lately received but little attention at the hands of the fancier, and\r\nbeen entirely confined to the domains of the producer for the market, would\r\nalone suggest the improbability of that constant and unremitting attention\r\nhaving been observed in breeding, which is requisite to the consummating in\r\nthe offspring of any two birds transmittable forms not exhibited by the\r\nparents.\" This at first sight appears true. But in a future chapter on\r\nSelection, abundant facts will be given showing not only that careful\r\nbreeding, but that actual selection was practised during ancient periods,\r\nand by barely civilised races of man. In the case of the fowl I can adduce\r\nno direct facts showing that selection was anciently practised; but the\r\nRomans at the commencement of the Christian era kept six or seven breeds,\r\nand Columella \"particularly recommends as the best, those sorts that have\r\nfive toes and white ears.\" (7/9. Rev. E.S. Dixon in his 'Ornamental\r\nPoultry' page 203 gives an account of Columella's work.) In the fifteenth\r\ncentury several breeds were known and described in Europe; and in China, at\r\nnearly the same period, seven kinds were named. A more striking case is\r\nthat at present, in one of the Philippine Islands, the semi-barbarous\r\ninhabitants have distinct native names for no less than nine sub-breeds of\r\nthe Game fowl. (7/10. Mr. Crawfurd 'On the Relation of the Domesticated\r\nAnimals to Civilization' separately printed page 6; first read before the\r\nBrit. Assoc. at Oxford 1860.) Azara (7/11. 'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2\r\npage 324.), who wrote towards the close of the last century, states that in\r\nthe interior parts of South America, where I should not have expected that\r\nthe least care would have been taken of poultry, a black-skinned and black-\r\nboned breed is kept, from being considered fertile and its flesh good for\r\nsick persons. Now every one who has kept poultry knows how impossible it is\r\nto keep several breeds distinct unless the utmost care be taken in\r\nseparating the sexes. Will it then be pretended that those persons who, in\r\nancient times and in semi-civilised countries took pains to keep the breeds\r\ndistinct, and who therefore valued them, would not occasionally have\r\ndestroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their best birds?\r\nThis is all that is required. It is not pretended that any one in ancient\r\ntimes intended to form a new breed, or to modify an old breed according to\r\nsome ideal standard of excellence. He who cared for poultry would merely\r\nwish to obtain, and afterwards to rear, the best birds which he could; but\r\nthis occasional preservation of the best birds would in the course of time\r\nmodify the breed, as surely, though by no means as rapidly, as does\r\nmethodical selection at the present day, If one person out of a hundred or\r\nout of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds, this would be\r\nsufficient; for the birds thus tended would soon become superior to others,\r\nand would form a new strain; and this strain would, as explained in the\r\nlast chapter, slowly have its characteristic differences augmented, and at\r\nlast be converted into a new sub-breed or breed. But breeds would often be\r\nfor a time neglected and would deteriorate; they would, however, partially\r\nretain their character, and afterwards might again come into fashion and be\r\nraised to a standard of perfection higher than their former standard; as\r\nhas actually occurred quite recently with Polish fowls. If, however, a\r\nbreed were utterly neglected, it would become extinct, as has recently\r\nhappened with one of the Polish sub-breeds. Whenever in the course of past\r\ncenturies a bird appeared with some slight abnormal structure, such as with\r\na lark-like crest on its head, it would probably often have been preserved\r\nfrom that love of novelty which leads some persons in England to keep\r\nrumpless fowls, and others in India to keep frizzled fowls. And after a\r\ntime any such abnormal appearance would be carefully preserved, from being\r\nesteemed a sign of the purity and excellence of the breed; for on this\r\nprinciple the Romans eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the\r\nwhite ear-lobe in their fowls.\r\n\r\nThus from the occasional appearance of abnormal characters, though at first\r\nonly slight in degree; from the effects of the use and the disuse of parts;\r\npossibly from the direct effects of changed climate and food; from\r\ncorrelation of growth; from occasional reversions to old and long-lost\r\ncharacters; from the crossing of breeds, when more than one had been\r\nformed; but, above all, from unconscious selection carried on during many\r\ngenerations, there is no insuperable difficulty, to the best of my\r\njudgment, in believing that all the breeds have descended from some one\r\nparent-source. Can any single species be named from which we may reasonably\r\nsuppose that all are descended? The Gallus bankiva apparently fulfils every\r\nrequirement. I have already given as fair an account as I could of the\r\narguments in favour of the multiple origin of the several breeds; and now I\r\nwill give those in favour of their common descent from G. bankiva.\r\n\r\n[But it will be convenient first briefly to describe all the known species\r\nof Gallus. The G. sonneratii does not range into the northern parts of\r\nIndia; according to Colonel Sykes (7/12. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1832 page\r\n151.), it presents at different heights of the Ghauts, two strongly marked\r\nvarieties, perhaps deserving to be called species. It was at one time\r\nthought to be the primitive stock of all our domestic breeds, and this\r\nshows that it closely approaches the common fowl in general structure; but\r\nits hackles partially consist of highly peculiar, horny laminae,\r\ntransversely banded with three colours; and I have met no authentic account\r\nof any such character having been observed in any domestic breed. (7/13.\r\nThese feathers have been described by Dr. W. Marshall 'Der Zoolog. Garten'\r\nApril 1874 page 124. I examined the feathers of some hybrids raised in the\r\nZoological Gardens between the male G. sonneratii and a red game-hen, and\r\nthey exhibited the true character of those of G. sonneratii, except that\r\nthe horny laminae were much smaller.) This species also differs greatly\r\nfrom the common fowl, in the comb being finely serrated, and in the loins\r\nbeing destitute of true hackles. Its voice is utterly different. It crosses\r\nreadily in India with domestic hens; and Mr. Blyth (7/14. See also an\r\nexcellent letter on the Poultry of India by Mr. Blyth in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1851 page 619.) raised nearly 100 hybrid chickens; but they were\r\ntender and mostly died whilst young. Those which were reared were\r\nabsolutely sterile when crossed inter se or with either parent. At the\r\nZoological Gardens, however, some 'hybrids of the same parentage were not\r\nquite so sterile: Mr. Dixon, as he informed me, made, with Mr. Yarrell's\r\naid, particular inquiries on this subject, and was assured that out of 50\r\neggs only five or six chickens were reared. Some, however, of these half-\r\nbred birds were crossed with one of their parents, namely, a Bantam, and\r\nproduced a few extremely feeble chickens. Mr. Dixon also procured some of\r\nthese same birds and crossed them in several ways, but all were more or\r\nless infertile. Nearly similar experiments have recently been tried on a\r\ngreat scale in the Zoological Gardens with almost the same result. (7/15.\r\nMr. S.J. Salter in 'Natural History Review' April 1863 page 276.) Out of\r\n500 eggs, raised from various first crosses and hybrids, between G.\r\nsonneratii, bankiva, and varius, only 12 chickens were reared, and of these\r\nonly three were the product of hybrids inter se. From these facts, and from\r\nthe above-mentioned strongly-marked differences in structure between the\r\ndomestic fowl and G. sonneratii, we may reject this latter species as the\r\nparent of any domestic breed.\r\n\r\nCeylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the island, viz. G. stanleyii; this\r\nspecies approaches so closely (except in the colouring of the comb) to the\r\ndomestic fowl, that Messrs. Layard and Kellaert (7/16. See also Mr.\r\nLayard's paper in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. History' 2nd series volume 14\r\npage 62.) would have considered it, as they inform me, as one of the\r\nparent-stocks, had it not been for its singularly different voice. This\r\nbird, like the last, crosses readily with tame hens, and even visits\r\nsolitary farms and ravishes them. Two hybrids, a male and female, thus\r\nproduced, were found by Mr. Mitford to be quite sterile: both inherited the\r\npeculiar voice of G. stanleyii. This species, then, may in all probability\r\nbe rejected as one of the primitive stocks of the domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nJava and the islands eastward as far as Flores are inhabited by G. varius\r\n(or furcatus), which differs in so many characters--green plumage,\r\nunserrated comb, and single median wattle--that no one supposes it to have\r\nbeen the parent of any one of our breeds; yet, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nCrawfurd (7/17. See also Mr. Crawfurd 'Descriptive Dict. of the Indian\r\nIslands' 1856 page 113.), hybrids are commonly raised between the male G.\r\nvarius and the common hen, and are kept for their great beauty, but are\r\ninvariably sterile: this, however, was not the case with some bred in the\r\nZoological Gardens. These hybrids were at one time thought to be\r\nspecifically distinct, and were named G. aeneus. Mr. Blyth and others\r\nbelieve that the G. temminckii (7/18. Described by Mr. G.R. Gray 'Proc.\r\nZoolog. Soc' 1849 page 62.) (of which the history is not known) is a\r\nsimilar hybrid. Sir J. Brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls from\r\nBorneo, and across the tail of one of these, as Mr. Tegetmeier observed,\r\nthere were transverse blue bands like those which he had seen on the tail-\r\nfeathers of hybrids from G. varius, reared in the Zoological Gardens. This\r\nfact apparently indicates that some of the fowls of Borneo have been\r\nslightly affected by crosses with G. varius, but the case may possibly be\r\none of analogous variation. I may just allude to the G. giganteus, so often\r\nreferred to in works on poultry as a wild species; but Marsden (7/19. The\r\npassage from Marsden is given by Mr. Dixon in his 'Poultry Book' page 176.\r\nNo ornithologist now ranks this bird as a distinct species.) the first\r\ndescriber, speaks of it as a tame breed; and the specimen in the British\r\nMuseum evidently has the aspect of a domestic variety.\r\n\r\nThe last species to be mentioned, namely, Gallus bankiva, has a much wider\r\ngeographical range than the three previous species; it inhabits Northern\r\nIndia as far west as Sinde, and ascends the Himalaya to a height of 4000\r\nft.; it inhabits Burmah, the Malay peninsula, the Indo-Chinese countries,\r\nthe Philippine Islands, and the Malayan archipelago as far eastward as\r\nTimor. This species varies considerably in the wild state. Mr. Blyth\r\ninforms me that the specimens, both male and female, brought from near the\r\nHimalaya, are rather paler coloured than those from other parts of India;\r\nwhilst those from the Malay peninsula and Java are brighter coloured than\r\nthe Indian birds. I have seen specimens from these countries, and the\r\ndifference of tint in the hackles was conspicuous. The Malayan hens were a\r\nshade redder on the breast and neck than the Indian hens. The Malayan males\r\ngenerally had a red ear-lappet, instead of a white one as in India; but Mr.\r\nBlyth has seen one Indian specimen without the white ear-lappet. The legs\r\nare leaden blue in the Indian, whereas they show some tendency to be\r\nyellowish in the Malayan and Javan specimens. In the former Mr. Blyth finds\r\nthe tarsus remarkably variable in length. According to Temminck (7/20.\r\n'Coup-d'oeil general sur l'Inde Archipelagique' tome 3 1849 page 177; see\r\nalso Mr. Blyth in 'Indian Sporting Review' volume 2 page 5 1856.) the Timor\r\nspecimens differ as a local race from that of Java. These several wild\r\nvarieties have not as yet been ranked as distinct species; if they should,\r\nas is not unlikely, be hereafter thus ranked, the circumstance would be\r\nquite immaterial as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic\r\nbreeds are concerned. The wild G. bankiva agrees most closely with the\r\nblack-breasted red Game-breed, in colouring and in all other respects,\r\nexcept in being smaller, and in the tail being carried more horizontally.\r\nBut the manner in which the tail is carried is highly variable in many of\r\nour breeds, for, as Mr. Brent informs me, the tail slopes much in the\r\nMalays, is erect in the Games and some other breeds, and is more than erect\r\nin Dorkings, Bantams, etc. There is one other difference namely, that in G.\r\nbankiva, according to Mr. Blyth, the neck-hackles when first moulted are\r\nreplaced during two or three months not by other hackles, as with our\r\ndomestic poultry, but by short blackish feathers. (7/21. Mr. Blyth 'Annals\r\nand Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 1 1848 page 455.) Mr. Brent,\r\nhowever, has remarked that these black feathers remain in the wild bird\r\nafter the development of the lower hackles, and appear in the domestic bird\r\nat the same time with them: so that the only difference is that the lower\r\nhackles are replaced more slowly in the wild than in the tame bird; but as\r\nconfinement is known sometimes to affect the masculine plumage, this slight\r\ndifference cannot be considered of any importance. It is a significant fact\r\nthat the voice of both the male and female G. bankiva closely resembles, as\r\nMr. Blyth and others have noted, the voice of both sexes of the common\r\ndomestic fowl; but the last note of the crow of the wild bird is rather\r\nless prolonged. Captain Hutton, well known for his researches into the\r\nnatural history of India, informs me that he has seen several crossed fowls\r\nfrom the wild species and the Chinese bantam; these crossed fowls BRED\r\nFREELY with bantams, but unfortunately were not crossed inter se. Captain\r\nHutton reared chickens from the eggs of the Gallus bankiva; and these,\r\nthough at first very wild, afterwards became so tame that they would crowd\r\nround his feet. He did not succeed in rearing them to maturity; but as he\r\nremarks, \"no wild gallinaceous bird thrives well at first on hard grain.\"\r\nMr. Blyth also found much difficulty in keeping G. bankiva in confinement.\r\nIn the Philippine Islands, however, the natives must succeed better, as\r\nthey keep wild cocks to fight with their domestic game-birds. (7/22.\r\nCrawfurd 'Desc. Dict. of Indian Islands' 1856 page 112.) Sir Walter Elliot\r\ninforms me that the hen of a native domestic breed of Pegu is\r\nundistinguishable from the hen of the wild G. bankiva; and the natives\r\nconstantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight with them in the\r\nwoods. (7/23. In Burmah, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, the wild and tame\r\npoultry constantly cross together, and irregular transitional forms may be\r\nseen.) Mr. Crawfurd remarks that from etymology it might be argued that the\r\nfowl was first domesticated by the Malays and Javanese. (7/24. Ibid page\r\n113.) It is also a curious fact, of which I have been assured by Mr. Blyth,\r\nthat wild specimens of the Gallus bankiva, brought from the countries east\r\nof the Bay of Bengal, are far more easily tamed than those of India; nor is\r\nthis an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long ago remarked, the same\r\nspecies sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one country than\r\nin another. If we suppose that the G. bankiva was first tamed in Malaya and\r\nafterwards imported into India, we can understand an observation made to me\r\nby Mr. Blyth, that the domestic fowls of India do not resemble the wild G.\r\nbankiva of India more closely than do those of Europe.]\r\n\r\nFrom the extremely close resemblance in colour, general structure, and\r\nespecially in voice, between Gallus bankiva and the Game fowl; from their\r\nfertility, as far as this has been ascertained, when crossed; from the\r\npossibility of the wild species being tamed, and from its varying in the\r\nwild state, we may confidently look at it as the parent of the most typical\r\nof all the domestic breeds, namely, the Game fowl. It is a significant\r\nfact, that almost all the naturalists in India, namely Sir W. Elliot, Mr.\r\nS.N. Ward, Mr. Layard, Mr. J.C. Jerdon, and Mr. Blyth (7/25. Mr. Jerdon in\r\nthe 'Madras Journ. of Lit. and Science' volume 22 page 2 speaking of G.\r\nbankiva says \"unquestionably the origin of most of the varieties of our\r\ncommon fowls.\" For Mr. Blyth see his excellent article in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1851 page 619; and in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 20\r\n1847 page 388.), who are familiar with G. bankiva, believe that it is the\r\nparent of most or all our domestic breeds. But even if it be admitted that\r\nG. bankiva is the parent of the Game breed, yet it may be urged that other\r\nwild species have been the parents of the other domestic breeds; and that\r\nthese species still exist, though unknown, in some country, or have become\r\nextinct. The extinction, however, of several species of fowls, is an\r\nimprobable hypothesis, seeing that the four known species have not become\r\nextinct in the most ancient and thickly peopled regions of the East. There\r\nis, in fact, not one other kind of domesticated bird, of which the wild\r\nparent-form is unknown, that is become extinct. For the discovery of new,\r\nor the rediscovery of old species of Gallus, we must not look, as fanciers\r\noften look, to the whole world. The larger gallinaceous birds, as Mr. Blyth\r\nhas remarked (7/26. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1851 page 619.), generally have\r\na restricted range: we see this well illustrated in India, where the genus\r\nGallus inhabits the base of the Himalaya, and is succeeded higher up by\r\nGallophasis, and still higher up by Phasianus. Australia, with its islands,\r\nis out of the question as the home for unknown species of the genus. It is,\r\nalso, as improbable that Gallus should inhabit South America (7/27. I have\r\nconsulted an eminent authority, Mr. Sclater, on this subject, and he thinks\r\nthat I have not expressed myself too strongly. I am aware that one ancient\r\nauthor, Acosta, speaks of fowls as having inhabited S. America at the\r\nperiod of its discovery; and more recently, about 1795, Olivier de Serres\r\nspeaks of wild fowls in the forests of Guiana; these were probably feral\r\nbirds. Dr. Daniell tells me, he believes that fowls have become wild on the\r\nwest coast of Equatorial Africa; they may, however, not be true fowls, but\r\ngallinaceous birds belonging to the genus Phasidus. The old voyager Barbut\r\nsays that poultry are not natural to Guinea. Capt. W. Allen ('Narrative of\r\nNiger Expedition' 1848 volume 2 page 42) describes wild fowls on Ilha dos\r\nRollas, an island near St. Thomas's on the west coast of Africa; the\r\nnatives informed him that they had escaped from a vessel wrecked there many\r\nyears ago; they were extremely wild and had \"a cry quite different to that\r\nof the domestic fowl,\" and their appearance was somewhat changed. Hence it\r\nis not a little doubtful, notwithstanding the statement of the natives,\r\nwhether these birds really were fowls. That the fowl has become feral on\r\nseveral islands is certain. Mr. Fry, a very capable judge, informed Mr.\r\nLayard, in a letter, that the fowls which have run wild on Ascension \"had\r\nnearly all got back to their primitive colours, red, and black cocks, and\r\nsmoky-grey hens.\" But unfortunately we do not know the colour of the\r\npoultry which were turned out. Fowls have become feral on the Nicobar\r\nIslands (Blyth in the 'Indian Field' 1858 page 62), and in the Ladrones\r\n(Anson's Voyage). Those found in the Pellew Islands Crawfurd) are believed\r\nto be feral; and lastly, it is asserted that they have become feral in New\r\nZealand, but whether this is correct I know not.) as that a humming-bird\r\nshould be found in the Old World. From the character of the other\r\ngallinaceous birds of Africa, it is not probable that Gallus is an African\r\ngenus. We need not look to the western parts of Asia, for Messrs. Blyth and\r\nCrawfurd, who have attended to this subject, doubt whether Gallus ever\r\nexisted in a wild state even as far west as Persia. Although the earliest\r\nGreek writers speak of the fowl as a Persian bird, this probably merely\r\nindicates its line of importation. For the discovery of unknown species we\r\nmust look to India, to the Indo-Chinese countries, and to the northern\r\nparts of the Malay Archipelago. The southern portion of China is the most\r\nlikely country; but as Mr. Blyth informs me, skins have been exported from\r\nChina during a long period, and living birds are largely kept there in\r\naviaries, so that any native species of Gallus would probably have become\r\nknown. Mr. Birch, of the British Museum, has translated for me passages\r\nfrom a Chinese Encyclopaedia published in 1609, but compiled from more\r\nancient documents, in which it is said that fowls are creatures of the\r\nWest, and were introduced into the East (i.e. China) in a dynasty 1400 B.C.\r\nWhatever may be thought of so ancient a date, we see that the Indo-Chinese\r\nand Indian regions were formerly considered by the Chinese as the source of\r\nthe domestic fowl. From these several considerations we must look to the\r\npresent metropolis of the genus, namely, to the south-eastern parts of\r\nAsia, for the discovery of species which were formerly domesticated, but\r\nare now unknown in the wild state; and the most experienced ornithologists\r\ndo not consider it probable that such species will be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn considering whether the domestic breeds are descended from one species,\r\nnamely, G. bankiva, or from several, we must not quite overlook, though we\r\nmust not exaggerate, the importance of the test of fertility. Most of our\r\ndomestic breeds have been so often crossed, and their mongrels so largely\r\nkept, that it is almost certain, if any degree of infertility had existed\r\nbetween them, it would have been detected. On the other hand, the four\r\nknown species of Gallus when crossed with each other, or when crossed, with\r\nthe exception of G. bankiva, with the domestic fowl, produce infertile\r\nhybrids.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have not such good evidence with fowls as with pigeons, of all\r\nthe breeds having descended from a single primitive stock. In both cases\r\nthe argument of fertility must go for something; in both we have the\r\nimprobability of man having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly\r\ndomesticating several supposed species,--most of these supposed species\r\nbeing extremely abnormal as compared with their natural allies,--all being\r\nnow either unknown or extinct, though the parent-form of no other\r\ndomesticated bird has been lost. But in searching for the supposed parent-\r\nstocks of the various breeds of the pigeon, we were enabled to confine our\r\nsearch to species having peculiar habits of life; whilst with fowls there\r\nis nothing in their habits in any marked manner distinct from those of\r\nother gallinaceous birds. In the case of pigeons, I have shown that purely-\r\nbred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races\r\nfrequently resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general colour\r\nand in each characteristic mark. With fowls we have facts of a similar\r\nnature, but less strongly pronounced, which we will now discuss.\r\n\r\nREVERSION AND ANALOGOUS VARIATION.\r\n\r\nPurely-bred Game, Malay, Cochin, Dorking, Bantam, and, as I hear from Mr.\r\nTegetmeier, Silk fowls, may frequently or occasionally be met with, which\r\nare almost identical in plumage with the wild G. bankiva. This is a fact\r\nwell deserving attention, when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst\r\nthe most distinct. Fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs black-\r\nbreasted reds. Hamburghs properly have a very different plumage;\r\nnevertheless, as Mr. Tegetmeier informs me, \"the great difficulty in\r\nbreeding cocks of the golden-spangled variety is their tendency to have\r\nblack breasts and red backs. The males of white Bantams and white Cochins,\r\nas they come to maturity, often assume a yellowish or saffron tinge; and\r\nthe longer neck hackles of black Bantam cocks\" (7/28. Mr. Hewitt in 'The\r\nPoultry Book' by W.B. Tegetmeier 1866 page 248.), when two or three years\r\nold, not uncommonly become ruddy; these latter Bantams occasionally \"even\r\nmoult brassy-winged, or actually red-shouldered.\" So that in these several\r\ncases we see a plain tendency to reversion to the hues of G. bankiva, even\r\nduring the lifetime of the individual bird. With Spanish, Polish, pencilled\r\nHamburgh, silver-spangled Hamburgh fowls, and with some other less common\r\nbreeds, I have never heard of a black-breasted red bird having appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience with pigeons, I made the following crosses. I first\r\nkilled all my own poultry, no others living near my house, and then\r\nprocured, by Mr. Tegetmeier's assistance, a first-rate black Spanish cock,\r\nand hens of the following pure breeds,--white Game, white Cochin, silver-\r\nspangled Polish, silver-spangled Hamburgh, silver-pencilled Hamburgh, and\r\nwhite Silk. In none of these breeds is there a trace of red, nor when kept\r\npure have I ever heard of the appearance of a red feather; though such an\r\noccurrence would perhaps not be very improbable with white Games and white\r\nCochins. Of the many chickens reared from the above six crosses the\r\nmajority were black, both in the down and in the first plumage; some were\r\nwhite, and a very few were mottled black and white. In one lot of eleven\r\nmixed eggs from the white Game and white Cochin by the black Spanish cock,\r\nseven of the chickens were white, and only four black. I mention this fact\r\nto show that whiteness of plumage is strongly inherited, and that the\r\nbelief in the prepotent power in the male to transmit his colour is not\r\nalways correct. The chickens were hatched in the spring, and in the latter\r\npart of August several of the young cocks began to exhibit a change, which\r\nwith some of them increased during the following years. Thus a young male\r\nbird from the silver-spangled Polish hen was in its first plumage coal-\r\nblack, and combined in its comb, crest, wattle, and beard, the characters\r\nof both parents; but when two years old the secondary wing-feathers became\r\nlargely and symmetrically marked with white, and, wherever in G. bankiva\r\nthe hackles are red, they were in this bird greenish-black along the shaft,\r\nnarrowly bordered with brownish-black, and this again broadly bordered with\r\nvery pale yellowish-brown; so that in general appearance the plumage had\r\nbecome pale-coloured instead of black. In this case, with advancing age\r\nthere was a great change, but no reversion to the red colour of G. bankiva.\r\n\r\nA cock with a regular rose comb derived either from the spangled or\r\npencilled silver Hamburgh was likewise at first quite black; but in less\r\nthan a year the neck-hackles, as in the last case, became whitish, whilst\r\nthose on the loins assumed a decided reddish-yellow tint; and here we see\r\nthe first symptom of reversion; this likewise occurred with some other\r\nyoung cocks, which need not here be described. It has also been recorded\r\n(7/29. 'Journal of Horticulture' January 14, 1862 page 325.) by a breeder,\r\nthat he crossed two silver-pencilled Hamburgh hens with a Spanish cock, and\r\nreared a number of chickens, all of which were black, the cocks having\r\nGOLDEN and the hens brownish hackles; so that in this instance likewise\r\nthere was a clear tendency to reversion.\r\n\r\nTwo young cocks from my white Game hen were at first snow white; of these,\r\none subsequently assumed male orange-coloured hackles, chiefly on the\r\nloins, and the other an abundance of fine orange-red hackles on the neck,\r\nloins, and upper wing-coverts. Here again we have a more decided, though\r\npartial, reversion to the colours of G. bankiva. This second cock was in\r\nfact coloured like an inferior \"pile Came cock;\"--now this sub-breed can be\r\nproduced, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by crossing a black-breasted\r\nred Game cock with a white Game hen, and the \"pile\" sub-breed thus produced\r\ncan afterwards be truly propagated. So that we have the curious fact of the\r\nglossy-black Spanish cock and the black-breasted red Game cock when crossed\r\nwith white Game hens producing offspring of nearly the same colours.\r\n\r\nI reared several birds from the white Silk hen by the Spanish cock: all\r\nwere coal-black, and all plainly showed their parentage in having blackish\r\ncombs and bones; none inherited the so-called silky feathers, and the non-\r\ninheritance of this character has been observed by others. The hens never\r\nvaried in their plumage. As the young cocks grew old, one of them assumed\r\nyellowish-white hackles, and thus resembled in a considerable degree the\r\ncross from the Hamburgh hen; the other became a gorgeous bird, so much so\r\nthat an acquaintance had it preserved and stuffed simply from its beauty.\r\nWhen stalking about it closely resembled the wild Gallus bankiva, but with\r\nthe red feathers rather darker. On close comparison one considerable\r\ndifference presented itself, namely, that the primary and secondary wing-\r\nfeathers were edged with greenish-black, instead of being edged, as in G.\r\nbankiva, with fulvous and red tints. The space, also, across the back,\r\nwhich bears dark-green feathers, was broader, and the comb was blackish. In\r\nall other respects, even in trifling details of plumage, there was the\r\nclosest accordance. Altogether it was a marvellous sight to compare this\r\nbird first with G. bankiva, and then with its father, the glossy green-\r\nblack Spanish cock, and with its diminutive mother, the white Silk hen.\r\nThis case of reversion is the more extraordinary as the Spanish breed has\r\nlong been known to breed true, and no instance is on record of its throwing\r\na single red feather. The Silk hen likewise breeds true, and is believed to\r\nbe ancient, for Aldrovandi, before 1600, alludes probably to this breed,\r\nand described it as covered with wool. It is so peculiar in many characters\r\nthat some writers have considered it as specifically distinct; yet, as we\r\nnow see, when crossed with the Spanish fowl, it yields offspring closely\r\nresembling the wild G. bankiva.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat, at my request, the cross\r\nbetween a Spanish cock and Silk hen, and he obtained similar results; for\r\nhe thus raised, besides a black hen, seven cocks, all of which were dark-\r\nbodied with more or less orange-red hackles. In the ensuing year he paired\r\nthe black hen with one of her brothers, and raised three young cocks, all\r\ncoloured like their father, and a black hen mottled with white.\r\n\r\nThe hens from the six above-described crosses showed hardly any tendency to\r\nrevert to the mottled-brown plumage of the female G. bankiva: one hen,\r\nhowever, from the white Cochin, which was at first coal-black, became\r\nslightly brown or sooty. Several hens, which were for a long time snow-\r\nwhite, acquired as they grew old a few black feathers. A hen from the white\r\nGame, which was for a long time entirely black glossed with green, when two\r\nyears old had some of the primary wing feathers greyish-white, and a\r\nmultitude of feathers over her body narrowly and symmetrically tipped or\r\nlaced with white. I had expected that some of the chickens whilst covered\r\nwith down would have assumed the longitudinal stripes so general with\r\ngallinaceous birds; but this did not occur in a single instance. Two or\r\nthree alone were reddish-brown about their heads. I was unfortunate in\r\nlosing nearly all the white chickens from the first crosses; so that black\r\nprevailed with the grandchildren; but they were much diversified in colour,\r\nsome being sooty, others mottled, and one blackish chicken had its feathers\r\noddly tipped and barred with brown.\r\n\r\nI will here add a few miscellaneous facts connected with reversion, and\r\nwith the law of analogous variation. This law implies, as stated in a\r\nprevious chapter, that the varieties of one species frequently mock\r\ndistinct but allied species; and this fact is explained, according to the\r\nviews which I maintain, on the principle of allied species having descended\r\nfrom one primitive form. The white Silk fowl with black skin and bones\r\ndegenerates, as has been observed by Mr. Hewitt and Mr. R. Orton, in our\r\nclimate; that is, it reverts to the ordinary colour of the common fowl in\r\nits skin and bones, due care having been taken to prevent any cross. In\r\nGermany (7/30. 'Die Huhner- und Pfauenzucht' Ulm 1827 s. 17. For Mr.\r\nHewitt's statement with respect to the white Silk fowl see the 'Poultry\r\nBook' by W.B. Tegetmeier 1866 page 222. I am indebted to Mr. Orton for a\r\nletter on the same subject.) a distinct breed with black bones, and with\r\nblack, not silky plumage, has likewise been observed to degenerate.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier informs me that, when distinct breeds are crossed, fowls are\r\nfrequently produced with their feathers marked or pencilled by narrow\r\ntransverse lines of a darker colour. This may be in part explained by\r\ndirect reversion to the parent-form, the Bankiva hen; for this bird has all\r\nits upper plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous brown, with the\r\nmottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse lines. But the\r\ntendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by the law of\r\nanalogous variation, for the hens of some other species of Gallus are more\r\nplainly pencilled, and the hens of many gallinaceous birds belonging to\r\nother genera, as the partridge, have pencilled feathers. Mr. Tegetmeier has\r\nalso remarked to me that, although with domestic pigeons we have so great a\r\ndiversity of colouring, we never see either pencilled or spangled feathers;\r\nand this fact is intelligible on the law of analogous variation, as neither\r\nthe wild rock pigeon nor any closely allied species has such feathers. The\r\nfrequent appearance of pencilling in crossed birds probably accounts for\r\nthe existence of \"cuckoo\" sub-breeds in the Game, Polish, Dorking, Cochin,\r\nAndalusian, and Bantam breeds. The plumage of these birds is slaty-blue or\r\ngrey, with each feather transversely barred with darker lines, so as to\r\nresemble in some degree the plumage of the cuckoo. It is a singular fact,\r\nconsidering that the male of no species of Gallus is in the least barred,\r\nthat the cuckoo-like plumage has often been transferred to the male, more\r\nespecially in the cuckoo Dorking; and the fact is all the more singular, as\r\nin gold- and silver-pencilled Hamburghs, in which pencilling is\r\ncharacteristic of the breed, the male is hardly at all pencilled, this kind\r\nof plumage being confined to the female.\r\n\r\nAnother case of analogous variation is the occurrence of spangled sub-\r\nbreeds of Hamburgh, Polish, Malay, and Bantam fowls. Spangled feathers have\r\na dark mark, properly crescent-shaped, on their tips; whilst pencilled\r\nfeathers have several transverse bars. The spangling cannot be due to\r\nreversion to G. bankiva; nor does it often follow, as I hear from Mr.\r\nTegetmeier, from crossing distinct breeds; but it is a case of analogous\r\nvariation, for many gallinaceous birds have spangled feathers,--for\r\ninstance, the common pheasant. Hence spangled breeds are often called\r\n\"pheasant\"-fowls. Another case of analogous variation in several domestic\r\nbreeds is inexplicable; it is, that the chickens, whilst covered with down,\r\nof the black Spanish, black Game, black Polish, and black Bantam, all have\r\nwhite throats and breasts, and often have some white on their wings. (7/31.\r\nDixon 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry' pages 253, 324, 335. For game fowls\r\nsee Ferguson on 'Prize Poultry' page 260.) The editor of the 'Poultry\r\nChronicle' (7/32. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 2 71.) remarks that all the\r\nbreeds which properly have red ear-lappets occasionally produce birds with\r\nwhite ear-Tappets. This remark more especially applies to the Game breed,\r\nwhich of all comes nearest to the G. bankiva; and we have seen that with\r\nthis species living in a state of nature, the ear-lappets vary in colour,\r\nbeing red in the Malayan countries, and generally, but not invariably,\r\nwhite in India.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of my subject, I may repeat that there exists one\r\nwidely-ranging, varying, and common species of Gallus, namely, G. bankiva,\r\nwhich can be tamed, produces fertile offspring when crossed with common\r\nfowls, and closely resembles in its whole structure, plumage, and voice the\r\nGame breed; hence it may be safely ranked as the parent of this, the most\r\ntypical domesticated breed. We have seen that there is much difficulty in\r\nbelieving that other, now unknown, species have been the parents of the\r\nother domestic breeds. We know that all the breeds are most closely allied,\r\nas shown by their similarity in most points of structure and in habits, and\r\nby the analogous manner in which they vary. We have also seen that several\r\nof the most distinct breeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in\r\nplumage G. bankiva, and that the crossed offspring of other breeds, which\r\nare not thus coloured, show a stronger or weaker tendency to revert to this\r\nsame plumage. Some of the breeds, which appear the most distinct and the\r\nleast likely to have proceeded from G. bankiva, such as Polish fowls, with\r\ntheir protuberant and little ossified skulls, and Cochins, with their\r\nimperfect tail and small wings, bear in these characters the plain marks of\r\ntheir artificial origin. We know well that of late years methodical\r\nselection has greatly improved and fixed many characters; and we have every\r\nreason to believe that unconscious selection, carried on for many\r\ngenerations, will have steadily augmented each new peculiarity, and thus\r\nhave given rise to new breeds. As soon as two or three breeds were once\r\nformed, crossing would come into play in changing their character and in\r\nincreasing their number. Brahma Pootras, according to an account lately\r\npublished in America, offer a good instance of a breed, lately formed by a\r\ncross, which can be truly propagated. The well-known Sebright Bantams offer\r\nanother and similar instance. Hence it may be concluded that not only the\r\nGame-breed but that all our breeds are probably the descendants of the\r\nMalayan or Indian variety of G. bankiva. If so, this species has varied\r\ngreatly since it was first domesticated; but there has been ample time, as\r\nwe shall now show.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE FOWL.\r\n\r\nRutimeyer found no remains of the fowl in the ancient Swiss lake-dwellings;\r\nbut, according to Jeitteles (7/33. 'Die vorgeschichtlichen Alterthumer' II.\r\nTheil 1872 page 5. Dr. Pickering in his 'Races of Man' 1850 page 374 says\r\nthat the head and neck of a fowl is carried in a Tribute-procession to\r\nThoutmousis III. (1445 B.C.); but Mr. Birch of the British Museum doubts\r\nwhether the figure can be identified as the head of a fowl. Some caution is\r\nnecessary with reference to the absence of figures of the fowl on the\r\nancient Egyptian monuments, on account of the strong and widely prevalent\r\nprejudice against this bird. I am informed by the Rev. S. Erhardt that on\r\nthe east coast of Africa, from 4 to 6 deg south of the equator, most of the\r\npagan tribes at the present day hold the fowl in aversion. The natives of\r\nthe Pellew Islands would not eat the fowl nor will the Indians in some\r\nparts of S. America. For the ancient history of the fowl see also Volz\r\n'Beitrage zur Culturgeschichte' 1852 s. 77; and Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire\r\n'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 61. Mr. Crawfurd has given an admirable\r\nhistory of the fowl in his paper 'On the Relation of Domesticated Animals\r\nto Civilisation' read before the Brit. Assoc. at Oxford in 1860 and since\r\nprinted separately. I quote from him on the Greek poet Theognis, and on the\r\nHarpy Tomb described by Sir C. Fellowes. I quote from a letter of Mr.\r\nBlyth's with respect to the Institutes of Manu.), such have certainly since\r\nbeen found associated with extinct animals and prehistoric remains. It is,\r\ntherefore a strange fact that the fowl is not mentioned in the Old\r\nTestament, nor figured on the ancient Egyptian monuments. It is not\r\nreferred to by Homer or Hesiod (about 900 B.C.); but is mentioned by\r\nTheognis and Aristophanes between 400 and 500 B.C. It is figured on some of\r\nthe Babylonian cylinders, between the sixth and seventh centuries B.C., of\r\nwhich Mr. Layard sent me an impression; and on the Harpy Tomb in Lycia,\r\nabout 600 B.C.: so that the fowl apparently reached Europe in a\r\ndomesticated condition somewhere about the sixth century B.C. It had\r\ntravelled still farther westward by the time of the Christian era, for it\r\nwas found in Britain by Julius Caesar. In India it must have been\r\ndomesticated when the Institutes of Manu were written, that is, according\r\nto Sir W. Jones, 1200 B.C., but, according to the later authority of Mr. H.\r\nWilson, only 800 B.C., for the domestic fowl is forbidden, whilst the wild\r\nis permitted to be eaten. If, as before remarked, we may trust the old\r\nChinese Encyclopaedia, the fowl must have been domesticated several\r\ncenturies earlier, as it is said to have been introduced from the West into\r\nChina 1400 B.C.\r\n\r\nSufficient materials do not exist for tracing the history of the separate\r\nbreeds. About the commencement of the Christian era, Columella mentions a\r\nfive-toed fighting breed, and some provincial breeds; but we know nothing\r\nabout them. He also alludes to dwarf fowls; but these cannot have been the\r\nsame with our Bantams, which, as Mr. Crawfurd has shown, were imported from\r\nJapan into Bantam in Java. A dwarf fowl, probably the true Bantam, is\r\nreferred to in an old Japanese Encyclopaedia, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nBirch. In the Chinese Encyclopaedia published in 1596, but compiled from\r\nvarious sources, some of high antiquity, seven breeds are mentioned,\r\nincluding what we should now call Jumpers or Creepers, and likewise fowls\r\nwith black feathers, bones, and flesh. In 1600 Aldrovandi describes seven\r\nor eight breeds of fowls, and this is the most ancient record from which\r\nthe age of our European breeds can be inferred. The Gallus turcicus\r\ncertainly seems to be a pencilled Hamburgh; but Mr. Brent, a most capable\r\njudge, thinks that Aldrovandi \"evidently figured what he happened to see,\r\nand not the best of the breed.\" Mr. Brent, indeed, considers all\r\nAldrovandi's fowls as of impure breed; but it is a far more probable view\r\nthat all our breeds have been much improved and modified since his time;\r\nfor, as he went to the expense of so many figures, he probably would have\r\nsecured characteristic specimens. The Silk fowl, however, probably then\r\nexisted in its present state, as did almost certainly the fowl with\r\nfrizzled or reversed feathers. Mr. Dixon (7/34. 'Ornamental and Domestic\r\nPoultry' 1847 page 185; for passages translated from Columella see page\r\n312. For Golden Hamburghs see Albin 'Natural History of Birds' 3 volumes\r\nwith plates 1731-38.) considers Aldrovandi's Paduan fowl as \"a variety of\r\nthe Polish,\" whereas Mr. Brent believes it to have been more nearly allied\r\nto the Malay. The anatomical peculiarities of the skull of the Polish breed\r\nwere noticed by P. Borelli in 1656. I may add that in 1737 one Polish sub-\r\nbreed, viz., the Golden-spangled, was known; but judging from Albin's\r\ndescription, the comb was then larger, the crest of feathers much smaller,\r\nthe breast more coarsely spotted, and the stomach and thighs much blacker:\r\na Golden-spangled Polish fowl in this condition would now be of no value.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES IN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE BETWEEN THE BREEDS:\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nFowls have been exposed to diversified conditions of life, and as we have\r\njust seen there has been ample time for much variability and for the slow\r\naction of unconscious selection. As there are good grounds for believing\r\nthat all the breeds are descended from Gallus bankiva, it will be worth\r\nwhile to describe in some detail the chief points of difference. Beginning\r\nwith the eggs and chickens, I will pass on to their secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, and then to their differences in external structure and in the\r\nskeleton. I enter on the following details chiefly to show how variable\r\nalmost every character has become under domestication.\r\n\r\n[EGGS.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon remarks (7/35. 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry' page 152.) that\r\n\"to every hen belongs an individual peculiarity in the form, colour, and\r\nsize of her egg, which never changes during her life-time, so long as she\r\nremains in health, and which is as well known to those who are in the habit\r\nof taking her produce, as the hand-writing of their nearest acquaintance.\"\r\nI believe that this is generally true, and that, if no great number of hens\r\nbe kept, the eggs of each can almost always be recognised. The eggs of\r\ndifferently sized breeds naturally differ much in size; but apparently, not\r\nalways in strict relation to the size of the hen: thus the Malay is a\r\nlarger bird than the Spanish, but GENERALLY she produces not such large\r\neggs; white Bantams are said to lay smaller eggs than other Bantams (7/36.\r\nFerguson on 'Rare Prize Poultry' page 297. This writer, I am informed,\r\ncannot generally be trusted. He gives, however, figures and much\r\ninformation on eggs. See pages 34 and 235 on the eggs of the Game fowl.);\r\nwhite Cochins, on the other hand, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, certainly\r\nlay larger eggs than buff Cochins. The eggs, however, of the different\r\nbreeds vary considerably in character; for instance, Mr. Ballance states\r\n(7/37. See 'Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 pages 81 and 78.) that his\r\nMalay \"pullets of last year laid eggs equal in size to those of any duck,\r\nand other Malay hens, two or three years old, laid eggs very little larger\r\nthan a good sized Bantam's egg. Some were as white as a Spanish hen's egg,\r\nand others varied from a light cream-colour to a deep rich buff, or even to\r\na brown.\" The shape also varies, the two ends being much more equally\r\nrounded in Cochins than in Games or Polish. Spanish fowls lay smoother eggs\r\nthan Cochins, of which the eggs are generally granulated. The shell in this\r\nlatter breed, and more especially in Malays is apt to be thicker than in\r\nGames or Spanish; but the Minorcas, a sub-breed of Spanish, are said to lay\r\nharder eggs than true Spanish. (7/38. 'The Cottage Gardener' October 1855\r\npage 13. On the thinness of the eggs of Game-fowls see Mowbray on 'Poultry'\r\n7th edition page 13.) The colour differs considerably,--the Cochins laying\r\nbuff-coloured eggs; the Malays a paler variable buff; and Games a still\r\npaler buff. It would appear that darker-coloured eggs characterise the\r\nbreeds which have lately come from the East, or are still closely allied to\r\nthose now living there. The colour of the yolk, according to Ferguson, as\r\nwell as of the shell, differs slightly in the sub-breeds of the Game. I am\r\nalso informed by Mr. Brent that dark partridge-coloured Cochin hens lay\r\ndarker coloured eggs than the other Cochin sub-breeds. The flavour and\r\nrichness of the egg certainly differ in different breeds. The\r\nproductiveness of the several breeds is very different. Spanish, Polish,\r\nand Hamburgh hens have lost the incubating instinct.\r\n\r\nCHICKENS.\r\n\r\nAs the young of almost all gallinaceous birds, even of the black curassow\r\nand black grouse, whilst covered with down, are longitudinally striped on\r\nthe back,--of which character, when adult, neither sex retains a trace,--it\r\nmight have been expected that the chickens of all our domestic fowls would\r\nhave been similarly striped. (7/39. My information, which is very far from\r\nperfect, on chickens in the down, is derived chiefly from Mr. Dixon's\r\n'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry.' Mr. B.P. Brent has also communicated to\r\nme many facts by letter, as has Mr. Tegetmeier. I will in each case mark my\r\nauthority by the name within brackets. For the chickens of white Silk fowls\r\nsee Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page 221.) This could, however, hardly\r\nhave been expected, when the adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so\r\ngreat a change as to be wholly white or black. In white fowls of various\r\nbreeds the chickens are uniformly yellowish white, passing in the black-\r\nboned Silk fowl into bright canary-yellow. This is also generally the case\r\nwith the chickens of white Cochins, but I hear from Mr. Zurhost that they\r\nare sometimes of a buff or oak colour, and that all those of this latter\r\ncolour, which were watched, turned out males. The chickens of buff Cochins\r\nare of a golden-yellow, easily distinguishable from the paler tint of the\r\nwhite Cochins, and are often longitudinally streaked with dark shades: the\r\nchickens of silver-cinnamon Cochins are almost always of a buff colour. The\r\nchickens of the white Game and white Dorking breeds, when held in\r\nparticular lights, sometimes exhibit (on the authority of Mr. Brent) faint\r\ntraces of longitudinal stripes. Fowls which are entirely black, namely,\r\nSpanish, black Game, black Polish, and black Bantams, display a new\r\ncharacter, for their chickens have their breasts and throats more or less\r\nwhite, with sometimes a little white elsewhere. Spanish chickens also,\r\noccasionally (Brent), have, where the down was white, their first true\r\nfeathers tipped for a time with white. The primordially striped character\r\nis retained by the chickens of most of the Game sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon);\r\nby Dorkings; by the partridge and grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins\r\n(Brent), but not, as we have seen, by the sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay\r\n(Dixon), but apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays.\r\nThe following breeds and sub-breeds are barely, or not at all,\r\nlongitudinally striped: viz., gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs, which\r\ncan hardly be distinguished from each other (Brent) in the down, both\r\nhaving a few dark spots on the head and rump, with occasionally a\r\nlongitudinal stripe (Dixon) on the back of the neck. I have seen only one\r\nchicken of the silver-spangled Hamburgh, and this was obscurely striped\r\nalong the back. Gold-spangled Polish chickens (Tegetmeier) are of a warm\r\nrusset brown; and silver-spangled Polish chickens are grey, sometimes\r\n(Dixon) with dashes of ochre on the head, wings, and breast. Cuckoo and\r\nblue-dun fowls (Dixon) are grey in the down. The chickens of Sebright\r\nBantams (Dixon) are uniformly dark brown, whilst those of the brown-\r\nbreasted red Game Bantam are black, with some white on the throat and\r\nbreast. From these facts we see that young chickens of the different\r\nbreeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much in their downy\r\nplumage; and, although longitudinal stripes characterise the young of all\r\nwild gallinaceous birds, they disappear in several domestic breeds. Perhaps\r\nit may be accepted as a general rule that the more the adult plumage\r\ndiffers from that of the adult G. bankiva, the more completely the chickens\r\nhave lost their stripes.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the period of life at which the characters proper to each\r\nbreed first appear, it is obvious that such structures as additional toes\r\nmust be formed long before birth. In Polish fowls, the extraordinary\r\nprotuberance of the anterior part of the skull is well developed before the\r\nchickens come out of the egg (7/40. As I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier; see also\r\n'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1856 page 366. On the late development of the crest\r\nsee 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 2 page 132.) but the crest, which is\r\nsupported on the protuberance, is at first feebly developed, nor does it\r\nattain its full size until the second year. The Spanish cock is pre-eminent\r\nfor his magnificent comb, and this is developed at an unusually early age;\r\nso that the young males can be distinguished from the females when only a\r\nfew weeks old, and therefore earlier than in other breeds; they likewise\r\ncrow very early, namely, when about six weeks old. In the Dutch sub-breed\r\nof the Spanish fowl the white ear-lappets are developed earlier than in the\r\ncommon Spanish breed. (7/41. On these points see 'Poultry Chronicle' volume\r\n3 page 166; and Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 pages 105 and 121.) Cochins\r\nare characterised by a small tail, and in the young cocks the tail is\r\ndeveloped at an unusually late period. (7/42. Dixon 'Ornamental and\r\nDomestic Poultry' page 273.) Game fowls are notorious for their pugnacity;\r\nand the young cocks crow, clap their little wings, and fight obstinately\r\nwith each other, even whilst under their mother's care. (7/43. Ferguson on\r\n'Rare and Prize Poultry' page 261.) \"I have often had,\" says one author\r\n(7/44. Mowbray on 'Poultry' 7th edition 1834 page 13.), \"whole broods,\r\nscarcely feathered, stone-blind from fighting; the rival couples moping in\r\ncorners, and renewing their battles on obtaining the first ray of light.\"\r\nThe weapons and pugnacity of all male gallinaceous birds evidently serve\r\nthe purpose of gaining possession of the females; so that the tendency in\r\nour Game chickens to fight at an extremely early age is not only useless,\r\nbut injurious, as they suffer much from their wounds. The training for\r\nbattle during an early age may be natural to the wild Gallus bankiva; but\r\nas man during many generations has gone on selecting the most obstinately\r\npugnacious cocks, it is more probable that their pugnacity has been\r\nunnaturally increased, and unnaturally transferred to the young male\r\nchickens. In the same manner, it is probable that the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the comb in the Spanish cock has been unintentionally\r\ntransferred to the young cocks; for fanciers would not care whether their\r\nyoung birds had large combs, but would select for breeding the adults which\r\nhad the finest combs, whether or not developed at an early period. The last\r\npoint which need here be noticed is that, though the chickens of Spanish\r\nand Malay fowls are well covered with down, the true feathers are acquired\r\nat an unusually late age; so that for a time the young birds are partially\r\nnaked, and are liable to suffer from cold.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe two sexes in the parent-form, the Gallus bankiva, differ much in\r\ncolour. In our domestic breeds the difference is never greater, but is\r\noften less, and varies much in degree even in the sub-breeds of the same\r\nmain breed. Thus in certain Game fowls the difference is as great as in the\r\nparent-form, whilst in the black and white sub-breeds there is no\r\ndifference in plumage. Mr. Brent informs me that he has seen two strains of\r\nblack-breasted red Games, of which the cocks could not be distinguished,\r\nwhilst the hens in one were partridge-brown and in the other fawn-brown. A\r\nsimilar case has been observed in the strains of the brown-breasted red\r\nGame. The hen of the \"duck-winged Game\" is \"extremely beautiful,\" and\r\ndiffers much from the hens of all the other Game sub-breeds; but generally,\r\nas with the blue and grey Game and with some sub-varieties of the pile-\r\ngame, a moderately close relation may be observed between the males and\r\nfemales in the variation of their plumage. (7/45. See the full description\r\nof the varieties of the Game-breed in Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page\r\n131. For Cuckoo Dorkings page 97.) A similar relation is also evident when\r\nwe compare the several varieties of Cochins. In the two sexes of gold and\r\nsilver-spangled and of buff Polish fowls, there is much general similarity\r\nin the colouring and marks of the whole plumage, excepting of course in the\r\nhackles, crest, and beard. In spangled Hamburghs, there is likewise a\r\nconsiderable degree of similarity between the two sexes. In pencilled\r\nHamburghs, on the other hand, there is much dissimilarity; the pencilling\r\nwhich is characteristic of the hens being almost absent in the males of\r\nboth the golden and silver varieties. But, as we have already seen, it\r\ncannot be given as a general rule that male fowls never have pencilled\r\nfeathers, for Cuckoo Dorkings are \"remarkable from having nearly similar\r\nmarkings in both sexes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the males in certain sub-breeds have lost some\r\nof their secondary masculine characters, and from their close resemblance\r\nin plumage to the females, are often called hennies. There is much\r\ndiversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree sterile; that\r\nthey sometimes are partially sterile seems clear (7/46. Mr. Hewitt in\r\nTegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 pages 246 and 156. For hen-tailed game-cocks\r\nsee page 131.), but this may have been caused by too close interbreeding.\r\nThat they are not quite sterile, and that the whole case is widely\r\ndifferent from that of old females assuming masculine characters, is\r\nevident from several of these hen-like sub-breeds having been long\r\npropagated. The males and females of gold and silver-laced Sebright Bantams\r\ncan be barely distinguished from each other, except by their combs,\r\nwattles, and spurs, for they are coloured alike, and the males have not\r\nhackles, nor the flowing sickle-like tail-feathers. A hen-tailed sub-breed\r\nof Hamburghs was recently much esteemed. There is also a breed of Game-\r\nfowls, in which the males and females resemble each other so closely that\r\nthe cocks have often mistaken their hen-feathered opponents in the cock-pit\r\nfor real hens, and by the mistake have lost their lives. (7/47. 'The Field'\r\nApril 20, 1861. The writer says he has seen half-a-dozen cocks thus\r\nsacrificed.) The cocks, though dressed in the feathers of the hen, \"are\r\nhigh-spirited birds, and their courage has been often proved:\" an engraving\r\neven has been published of one celebrated hen-tailed victor. Mr. Tegetmeier\r\n(7/48. 'Proceedings of Zoolog. Soc.' March 1861 page 102. The engraving of\r\nthe hen-tailed cock just alluded to was exhibited before the Society.) has\r\nrecorded the remarkable case of a brown-breasted red Game cock which, after\r\nassuming its perfect masculine plumage, became hen-feathered in the autumn\r\nof the following year; but he did not lose voice, spurs, strength, nor\r\nproductiveness. This bird has now retained the same character during five\r\nseasons, and has begot both hen-feathered and male-feathered offspring. Mr.\r\nGrantley F. Berkeley relates the still more singular case of a celebrated\r\nstrain of \"polecat Game fowls,\" which produced in nearly every brood a\r\nsingle hen-cock. \"The great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he,\r\nas the seasons succeeded each other, was not always a hen-cock, and not\r\nalways of the colour called the polecat, which is black. From the polecat\r\nand hen-cock feather in one season he moulted to a full male-plumaged\r\nblack-breasted red, and in the following year he returned to the former\r\nfeather.\" (7/49. 'The Field' April 20, 1861.)\r\n\r\nI have remarked in my 'Origin of Species' that secondary sexual characters\r\nare apt to differ much in the species of the same genus, and to be\r\nunusually variable in the individuals of the same species. So it is with\r\nthe breeds of the fowl, as we have already seen, as far as the colour of\r\nplumage is concerned, and so it is with the other secondary sexual\r\ncharacters. Firstly, the comb differs much in the various breeds (7/50. I\r\nam much indebted to Mr. Brent for an account, with sketches, of all the\r\nvariations of the comb known to him, and likewise with respect to the tail\r\nas presently to be given), and its form is eminently characteristic of each\r\nkind, with the exception of the Dorkings, in which the form has not been as\r\nyet determined on by fanciers, and fixed by selection. A single, deeply-\r\nserrated comb is the typical and most common form. It differs much in size,\r\nbeing immensely developed in Spanish fowls; and in a local breed called\r\nRed-caps, it is sometimes \"upwards of three inches in breadth at the front,\r\nand more than four inches in length, measured to the end of the peak\r\nbehind.\" (7/51. The 'Poultry Book' by Tegetmeier 1866 page 234.) In some\r\nbreeds the comb is double, and when the two ends are cemented together it\r\nforms a \"cup-comb;\" in the \"rose-comb\" it is depressed, covered with small\r\nprojections, and produced backwards; in the horned and creve-coeur fowl it\r\nis produced into two horns; it is triple in the pea-combed Brahmas, short\r\nand truncated in the Malays, and absent in the Guelderlands. In the\r\ntasselled Game a few long feathers rise from the back of the comb: in many\r\nbreeds a crest of feathers replaces the comb. The crest, when little\r\ndeveloped, arises from a fleshy mass, but, when much developed, from a\r\nhemispherical protuberance of the skull. In the best Polish fowls it is so\r\nlargely developed, that I have seen birds which could hardly pick up their\r\nfood; and a German writer asserts (7/52. 'Die Huhner- und Pfauenzucht' 1827\r\ns. 11.) that they are in consequence liable to be struck by hawks.\r\nMonstrous structures of this kind would thus be suppressed in a state of\r\nnature. The wattles, also, vary much in size, being small in Malays and\r\nsome other breeds; in certain Polish sub-breeds they are replaced by a\r\ngreat tuft of feathers called a beard.\r\n\r\nThe hackles do not differ much in the various breeds, but are short and\r\nstiff in Malays, and absent in Hennies. As in some orders male birds\r\ndisplay extraordinarily-shaped feathers, such as naked shafts with discs at\r\nthe end, etc., the following case may be worth giving. In the wild Gallus\r\nbankiva and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise from each side of\r\nthe extremities of the hackles are naked or not clothed with barbules, so\r\nthat they resemble bristles; but Mr. Brent sent me some scapular hackles\r\nfrom a young Birchen Duckwing Game cock, in which the naked barbs became\r\ndensely re-clothed with barbules towards their tips; so that these tips,\r\nwhich were dark coloured with a metallic lustre, were separated from the\r\nlower parts by a symmetrically-shaped transparent zone formed of the naked\r\nportions of the barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared like little\r\nseparate metallic discs.\r\n\r\nThe sickle-feathers in the tail, of which there are three pair, and which\r\nare eminently characteristic of the male sex, differ much in the various\r\nbreeds. They are scimitar-shaped in some Hamburghs, instead of being long\r\nand flowing as in the typical breeds. They are extremely short in Cochins,\r\nand are not at all developed in Hennies. They are carried, together with\r\nthe whole tail, erect in Dorkings and Gaines; but droop much in Malays and\r\nin some Cochins. Sultans are characterised by an additional number of\r\nlateral sickle-feathers. The spurs vary much, being placed higher or lower\r\non the shank; being extremely long and sharp in Games, and blunt and short\r\nin Cochins. These latter birds seem aware that their spurs are not\r\nefficient weapons; for though they occasionally use them, they more\r\nfrequently fight, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by seizing and\r\nshaking each other with their beaks. In some Indian Game cocks, received by\r\nMr. Brent from Germany, there are, as he informs me, three, four, or even\r\nfive spurs on each leg. Some Dorkings also have two spurs on each leg\r\n(7/53. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 page 595. Mr. Brent has informed me of\r\nthe same fact. With respect to the position of the spurs in Dorkings see\r\n'Cottage Gardener' September 18, 1860 page 380.); and in birds of this\r\nbreed the spur is often placed almost on the outside of the leg. Double\r\nspurs are mentioned in an ancient Chinese Encyclopaedia. Their occurrence\r\nmay be considered as a case of analogous variation, for some wild\r\ngallinaceous birds, for instance, the Polyplectron, have double spurs.\r\n\r\nJudging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in the\r\nGallinaceae, certain characters in our domestic fowls appear to have been\r\ntransferred from the one sex to the other. In all the species (except in\r\nTurnix), when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage between the\r\nmale and female, the male is always the most beautiful; but in golden-\r\nspangled Hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the cock, and\r\nincomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural species of Gallus;\r\nso that here a masculine character has been transferred to the female. On\r\nthe other hand, in Cuckoo Dorkings and in other cuckoo breeds the\r\npencilling, which in Gallus is a female attribute, has been transferred to\r\nthe male: nor, on the principle of analogous variation, is this\r\ntransference surprising, as the males in many gallinaceous genera are\r\nbarred or pencilled. With most of these birds head ornaments of all kinds\r\nare more fully developed in the male than in the female; but in Polish\r\nfowls the crest or top-knot, which in the male replaces the comb, is\r\nequally developed in both sexes. In the males of certain other sub-breeds,\r\nwhich from the hen having a small crest, are called lark-crested, \"a single\r\nupright comb sometimes almost entirely takes the place of the crest.\"\r\n(7/54. Dixon 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry' page 320.) From this latter\r\ncase, and more especially from some facts presently to be given with\r\nrespect to the protuberance of the skull in Polish fowls, the crest in this\r\nbreed must be viewed as a feminine character which has been transferred to\r\nthe male. In the Spanish breed the male, as we know, has an immense comb,\r\nand this has been partially transferred to the female, for her comb is\r\nunusually large, though not upright. In Game fowls the bold and savage\r\ndisposition of the male has likewise been largely transferred to the female\r\n(7/55. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that Game hens have been found so\r\ncombative, that it is now generally the practice to exhibit each hen in a\r\nseparate pen.); and she sometimes even possesses the eminently masculine\r\ncharacter of spurs. Many cases are on record of fertile hens being\r\nfurnished with spurs; and in Germany, according to Bechstein (7/56.\r\n'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 3 1793 s. 339, 407.), the spurs in the\r\nSilk hen are sometimes very long. He mentions also another breed similarly\r\ncharacterised, in which the hens are excellent layers, but are apt to\r\ndisturb and break their eggs owing to their spurs.\r\n\r\nMr. Layard (7/57. On the Ornithology of Ceylon in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat.\r\nHistory.' 2nd series volume 14 1854 page 63.) has given an account of a\r\nbreed of fowls in Ceylon with black skin, bones, and wattle, but with\r\nordinary feathers, and which cannot \"be more aptly described than by\r\ncomparing them to a white fowl drawn down a sooty chimney; it is, however,\"\r\nadds Mr. Layard, \"a remarkable fact that a male bird of the pure sooty\r\nvariety is almost as rare as a tortoise-shell tom-cat.\" Mr. Blyth found the\r\nsame rule to hold good with this breed near Calcutta. The males and\r\nfemales, on the other hand, of the black-boned European breed, with silky\r\nfeathers, do not differ from each other; so that in the one breed, black\r\nskin and bones and the same kind of plumage are common to both sexes,\r\nwhilst in the other breed, these characters are confined to the female sex.\r\n\r\nAt the present day all the breeds of Polish fowls have the great bony\r\nprotuberance on their skulls, which includes part of the brain and supports\r\nthe crest, equally developed in both sexes. But formerly in Germany the\r\nskull of the hen alone was protuberant: Blumenbach (7/58. 'Handbuch der\r\nvergleich. Anatomie' 1805 page 85 note. Mr. Tegetmeier, who gives in 'Proc.\r\nZoolog. Soc.' November 25, 1856 a very interesting account of the skulls of\r\nPolish fowls, not knowing of Bechstein's account, has disputed the accuracy\r\nof Blumenbach's statement. For Bechstein see 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands'\r\nb. 3 1793 s. 399 note. I may add that at the first exhibition of Poultry at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens in May 1845 I saw some fowls, called Friezland\r\nfowls, of which the hens were crested, and the cocks furnished with a\r\ncomb.), who particularly attended to abnormal peculiarities in domestic\r\nanimals, states, in 1805, that this was the case; and Bechstein had\r\npreviously, in 1793 observed the same fact. This latter author has\r\ncarefully described the effects on the skull of a crest not only in the\r\ncase of fowls, but of ducks, geese, and canaries. He states that with\r\nfowls, when the crest is not much developed, it is supported on a fatty\r\nmass; but when much developed, it is always supported on a bony\r\nprotuberance of variable size. He well describes the peculiarities of this\r\nprotuberance; he attended also to the effects of the modified shape of the\r\nbrain on the intellect of these birds, and disputes Pallas' statement that\r\nthey are stupid. He then expressly remarks that he never observed this\r\nprotuberance in male fowls. Hence there can be no doubt that this\r\nextraordinary character in the skulls of Polish fowls was formerly in\r\nGermany confined to the female sex, but has now been transferred to the\r\nmales, and has thus become common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n[EXTERNAL DIFFERENCES, NOT CONNECTED WITH THE SEXES, BETWEEN THE BREEDS AND\r\nBETWEEN INDIVIDUAL BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe size of the body differs greatly. Mr. Tegetmeier has known a Brahma to\r\nweigh 17 pounds; a fine Malay cock 10 pounds; whilst a first-rate Sebright\r\nBantam weighs hardly more than 1 pound. During the last 20 years the size\r\nof some of our breeds has been largely increased by methodical selection,\r\nwhilst that of other breeds has been much diminished. We have already seen\r\nhow greatly colour varies even within the same breed; we know that the wild\r\nG. bankiva varies slightly in colour; we know that colour is variable in\r\nall our domestic animals; nevertheless some eminent fanciers have so little\r\nfaith in variability, that they have actually argued that the chief Game\r\nsub-breeds, which differ from each other in nothing but colour, are\r\ndescended from distinct wild species! Crossing often causes strange\r\nmodification of colour. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white\r\nCochins are crossed, some of the chickens are almost invariably black.\r\nAccording to Mr. Brent, black and white Cochins occasionally produce\r\nchickens of a slaty-blue tint; and this same tint results, as Mr.\r\nTegetmeier tells me, from crossing white Cochins with black Spanish fowls,\r\nor white Dorkings with black Minorcas. (7/59. 'Cottage Gardener' January 3,\r\n1860 page 218.) A good observer (7/60. Mr. Williams in a paper read before\r\nthe Dublin Nat. Hist. Soc. quoted in 'Cottage Gardener' 1856 page 161.)\r\nstates that a first-rate silver-spangled Hamburgh hen gradually lost the\r\nmost characteristic qualities of the breed, for the black lacing to her\r\nfeathers disappeared, and her legs changed from leaden-blue to white: but\r\nwhat makes the case remarkable is, that this tendency ran in the blood for\r\nher sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked manner; and\r\nchickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost pure white,\r\n\"but on moulting acquired black colours and some spangled feathers with\r\nalmost obliterated markings;\" so that a new variety arose in this singular\r\nmanner. The skin in the different breeds differs much in colour, being\r\nwhite in common kinds, yellow in Malays and Cochins, and black in Silk\r\nfowls; thus mocking, as M. Godron (7/61. 'De l'Espece' 1859 page 442. For\r\nthe occurrence of black-boned fowls in South America, see Roulin in 'Mem.\r\nde l'Acad. des Sciences' tome 6 page 351; and Azara, 'Quadrupedes du\r\nParaguay' tome 2 page 324. A frizzled fowl sent to me from Madras had black\r\nbones.) remarks the three principal types of skin in mankind. The same\r\nauthor adds that, as different kinds of fowls living in distant and\r\nisolated parts of the world have black skin and bones, this colour must\r\nhave appeared at various times and places.\r\n\r\nThe shape and carriage of the body, and the shape of the head differ much.\r\nThe beak varies slightly in length and curvature, but incomparably less\r\nthan with pigeons. In most crested fowls the nostrils offer a remarkable\r\npeculiarity in being raised with a crescentic outline. The primary wing-\r\nfeathers are short in Cochins; in a male, which must have been more than\r\ntwice as heavy as G. bankiva, these feathers were in both birds of the same\r\nlength. I have counted, with Mr. Tegetmeier's aid, the primary wing-\r\nfeathers in thirteen cocks and hens of various breeds; in four of them,\r\nnamely in two Hamburghs, a Cochin, and Game bantam, there were 10, instead\r\nof the normal number 9; but in counting these feathers I have followed the\r\npractice of fanciers, and have NOT included the first minute primary\r\nfeather, barely three-quarters of an inch in length. These feathers differ\r\nconsiderably in relative length, the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth,\r\nbeing the longest; with the third either equal to, or considerably shorter\r\nthan the fifth. In wild gallinaceous species the relative length and number\r\nof the main wing and tail-feathers are extremely constant.\r\n\r\nThe tail differs much in erectness and size, being small in Malays and very\r\nsmall in Cochins. In thirteen fowls of various breeds which I have\r\nexamined, five had the normal number of 14 feathers, including in this\r\nnumber the two middle sickle-feathers; six others (viz., a Caffre cock,\r\nGold-spangled Polish cock, Cochin hen, Sultan hen, Game hen and Malay hen\r\nhad 16; and two (an old Cochin cock and Malay hen) had 17 feathers. The\r\nrumpless fowl has no tail and in one which I possessed there was no oil-\r\ngland; but this bird though the os coccygis was extremely imperfect, had a\r\nvestige of a tail with two rather long feathers in the position of the\r\nouter caudals. This bird came from a family where, as I was told, the breed\r\nhad kept true for twenty years; but rumpless fowls often produce chickens\r\nwith tails. (7/62. Mr. Hewitt in Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page 231.)\r\nAn eminent physiologist (7/63. Dr. Broca in Brown-Sequard 'Journal de\r\nPhys.' tome 2 page 361.) has recently spoken of this breed as a distinct\r\nspecies; had he examined the deformed state of the os coccyx he would never\r\nhave come to this conclusion; he was probably misled by the statement,\r\nwhich may be found in some works, that tailless fowls are wild in Ceylon;\r\nbut this statement, as I have been assured by Mr. Layard and Dr. Kellaert\r\nwho have so closely studied the birds of Ceylon, is utterly false.\r\n\r\nThe tarsi vary considerably in length, being relatively to the femur\r\nconsiderably longer in the Spanish and Frizzled, and shorter in the Silk\r\nand Bantam breeds, than in the wild G. bankiva; but in the latter, as we\r\nhave seen, the tarsi vary in length. The tarsi are often feathered. The\r\nfeet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes. Golden-spangled\r\nPolish fowls are said (7/64. Dixon 'Ornamental Poultry' page 325.) to have\r\nthe skin between their toes much developed: Mr. Tegetmeier observed this in\r\none bird, but it was not so in one which I examined. Prof. Hoffmann has\r\nsent me a sketch of the feet of a fowl of the common breed at Giessen, with\r\na web extending between the three toes, for about a third of their length.\r\nIn Cochins the middle toe is said (7/65. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 page\r\n485. Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page 41. On Cochins grazing ibid page\r\n46.) to be nearly double the length of the lateral toes, and therefore much\r\nlonger than in G. bankiva or in other fowls; but this was not the case in\r\ntwo which I examined. The nail of the middle toe in this same breed is\r\nsurprisingly broad and flat, but in a variable degree in two birds which I\r\nexamined; of this structure in the nail there is only a trace in G.\r\nbankiva.\r\n\r\nThe voice differs slightly, as I am informed by Mr. Dixon, in almost every\r\nbreed. The Malays (7/66. Ferguson on 'Prize Poultry' page 87.) have a loud,\r\ndeep, somewhat prolonged crow, but with considerable individual difference.\r\nColonel Sykes remarks that the domestic Kulm cock in India has not the\r\nshrill clear pipe of the English bird, and \"his scale of notes appears more\r\nlimited.\" Dr. Hooker was struck with the \"prolonged howling screech\" of the\r\ncocks in Sikhim. (7/67. Col. Sykes in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1832 page 151.\r\nDr. Hooker's 'Himalayan Journals' volume 1 page 314.) The crow of the\r\nCochin is notoriously and ludicrously different from that of the common\r\ncock. The disposition of the different breeds is widely different, varying\r\nfrom the savage and defiant temper of the Game-cock to the extremely\r\npeaceable temper of the Cochins. The latter, it has been asserted, \"graze\r\nto a much greater extent than any other varieties.\" The Spanish fowls\r\nsuffer more from frost than other breeds.]\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to the skeleton, the degree of distinctness of the\r\nseveral breeds from G. bankiva ought to be noticed. Some writers speak of\r\nthe Spanish as one of the most distinct breeds, and so it is in general\r\naspect; but its characteristic differences are not important. The Malay\r\nappears to me more distinct, from its tall stature, small drooping tail\r\nwith more than fourteen tail-feathers, and from its small comb and wattles;\r\nnevertheless, one Malay sub-breed is coloured almost exactly like G.\r\nbankiva. Some authors consider the Polish fowl as very distinct; but this\r\nis a semi-monstrous breed, as shown by the protuberant and irregularly\r\nperforated skull. The Cochin, from its deeply furrowed frontal bones,\r\npeculiarly shaped occipital foramen, short wing-feathers, short tail\r\ncontaining more than fourteen feathers, broad nail to the middle toe,\r\nfluffy plumage, rough and dark-coloured eggs, and especially from its\r\npeculiar voice, is probably the most distinct of all the breeds. If any one\r\nof our breeds has descended from some unknown species, distinct from G.\r\nbankiva, it is probably the Cochin; but the balance of evidence does not\r\nfavour this view. All the characteristic differences of the Cochin breed\r\nare more or less variable, and may be detected in a greater or lesser\r\ndegree in other breeds. One sub-breed is coloured closely like G. bankiva.\r\nThe feathered legs, often furnished with an additional toe, the wings\r\nincapable of flight, the extremely quiet disposition, indicate a long\r\ncourse of domestication; and these fowls come from China, where we know\r\nthat plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with\r\nextraordinary care, and where consequently we might expect to find\r\nprofoundly modified domestic races.\r\n\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.\r\n\r\nI have examined twenty-seven skeletons and fifty-three skulls of various\r\nbreeds, including three of G. bankiva: nearly half of these skulls I owe to\r\nthe kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier, and three of the skeletons to Mr. Eyton.\r\n\r\nSKULL.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 33. OCCIPITAL FORAMEN, of natural size. A. Wild Gallus bankiva. B.\r\nCochin Cock.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 34. SKULLS of natural size, viewed from above, a little obliquely.\r\nA. Wild Gallus bankiva. B.

(In the possession of Tegetmeier.))\r\n\r\n[The SKULL differs greatly in size in different breeds, being nearly twice\r\nas long in the largest Cochins, but not nearly twice as broad, as in\r\nBantams. The bones at the base, from the occipital foramen to the anterior\r\nend (including the quadrates and pterygoids), are absolutely identical in\r\nSHAPE in all the skulls. So is the lower jaw. In the forehead slight\r\ndifferences are often perceptible between the males and females, evidently\r\ncaused by the presence of the comb. In every case I take the skull of G.\r\nbankiva as the standard of comparison. In four Games, in one Malay hen, in\r\nan African cock, in a Frizzled cock from Madras, in two black-boned Silk\r\nhens, no differences worth notice occur. In three SPANISH cocks, the form\r\nof the forehead between the orbits differs considerably; in one it is\r\nconsiderably depressed, whilst in the two others it is rather prominent,\r\nwith a deep medial furrow; the skull of the hen is smooth. In three skulls\r\nof SEBRIGHT BANTAMS the crown is more globular, and slopes more abruptly to\r\nthe occiput, than in G. bankiva. In a Bantam or Jumper from Burmah these\r\nsame characters are more strongly pronounced, and the supra-occiput is more\r\npointed. In a black Bantam the skull is not so globular, and the occipital\r\nforamen is very large, and has nearly the same sub-triangular outline\r\npresently to be described in Cochins; and in this skull the two ascending\r\nbranches of the premaxillary are overlapped in a singular manner by the\r\nprocesses of the nasal bone, but, as I have seen only one specimen, some of\r\nthese differences may be individual. Of Cochins and Brahmas (the latter a\r\ncrossed race approaching closely to Cochins) I have examined seven skulls;\r\nat the point where the ascending branches of the premaxillary rest on the\r\nfrontal bone the surface is much depressed, and from this depression a deep\r\nmedial furrow extends backwards to a variable distance; the edges of this\r\nfissure are rather prominent, as is the top of the skull behind and over\r\nthe orbits. These characters are less developed in the hens. The\r\npterygoids, and the processes of the lower jaw, are broader, relatively to\r\nthe size of the head, than in G. bankiva; and this is likewise the case\r\nwith Dorkings when of large size. The fork of the hyoid bone in Cochins is\r\ntwice as wide as in G. bankiva, whereas the length of the other hyoid bones\r\nis only as three to two. But the most remarkable character is the shape of\r\nthe occipital foramen: in G. bankiva (A) the breadth in a horizontal line\r\nexceeds the height in a vertical line, and the outline is nearly circular;\r\nwhereas in Cochins (B) the outline is sub-triangular, and the vertical line\r\nexceeds the horizontal line in length. This same form likewise occurs in\r\nthe black Bantam above referred to, and an approach to it may be seen in\r\nsome Dorkings, and in a slight degree in certain other breeds.\r\n\r\nOf Dorkings I have examined three skulls, one belonging to the white-sub-\r\nbreed; the one character deserving notice is the breadth of the frontal\r\nbones, which are moderately furrowed in the middle; thus in a skull which\r\nwas less than once and a half the length of that of G. bankiva, the breadth\r\nbetween the orbits was exactly double. Of Hamburghs I have examined four\r\nskulls (male and female) of the pencilled sub-breed, and one (male) of the\r\nspangled sub-breed; the nasal bones stand remarkably wide apart, but in a\r\nvariable degree; consequently narrow membrane-covered spaces are left\r\nbetween the tips of the two ascending branches of the pre-maxillary bones,\r\nwhich are rather short, and between these branches and the nasal bones. The\r\nsurface of the frontal bone, on which the branches of the premaxillary\r\nrest, is very little depressed. These peculiarities no doubt stand in close\r\nrelation with the broad, flattened rose-comb characteristic of the Hamburgh\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nI have examined fourteen skulls of POLISH AND OTHER CRESTED BREEDS. Their\r\ndifferences are extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different sub-\r\nbreeds of English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of the\r\nfrontal bones (7/68. See Mr. Tegetmeier's account with woodcuts of the\r\nskull of Polish fowls in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' November 25, 1856. For other\r\nreferences see Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Gen. des Anomalies' tome\r\n1 page 287. M. C. Dareste suspects ('Recherches sur les Conditions de la\r\nVie' etc. Lille 1863 page 36) that the protuberance is not formed by the\r\nfrontal bones, but by the ossification of the dura mater.) may be seen in\r\nfigure 34, in which (B) the skull of a white-crested Polish fowl is shown\r\nobliquely from above, with the skull (A) of (G. bankiva in the same\r\nposition. In figure 35 longitudinal sections are given of the skull of a\r\nPolish fowl, and, for comparison, of a Cochin of the same size. The\r\nprotuberance in all Polish fowls occupies the same position but differs\r\nmuch in size. In one of my nine specimens it was extremely slight. The\r\ndegree to which the protuberance is ossified varies greatly, larger or\r\nsmaller portions of bone being replaced by membrane. In one specimen there\r\nwas only a single open pore; generally, there are many variously shaped\r\nopen spaces, the bone forming an irregular reticulation. A medial,\r\nlongitudinal, arched ribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one\r\nspecimen there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance, and the\r\nskull, when cleaned and viewed from above, presented the appearance of an\r\nopen basin. The change in the whole internal form of the skull is\r\nsurprisingly great. The brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as is\r\nshown in the two longitudinal sections, which deserve attentive\r\nconsideration. The upper and anterior cavity of the three into which the\r\nskull may be divided, is the one which is so greatly modified; it is\r\nevidently much larger than in the Cochin skull of the same size, and\r\nextends much further beyond the interorbital septum, but laterally is less\r\ndeep. This cavity, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, is entirely filled with\r\nbrain. In the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong\r\ninternal ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity; but\r\nthis ridge is quite absent in the Polish skull here figured. The shape of\r\nthe central cavity is circular in the Polish, and lengthened in the Cochin\r\nskull. The shape of the posterior cavity, together with the position, size,\r\nand number of the pores for the nerves, differ much in these two skulls. A\r\npit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the Cochin is entirely absent\r\nin this Polish skull, whilst in another specimen it was well developed. In\r\nthis second specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity\r\nlikewise differs to a certain extent in shape. I made sections of two other\r\nskulls,--namely, of a Polish fowl with the protuberance singularly little\r\ndeveloped, and of a Sultan in which it was a little more developed; and\r\nwhen these two skulls were placed between the two above figured (figure\r\n35), a perfect gradation in the configuration of each part of the internal\r\nsurface could be traced. In the Polish skull, with a small protuberance,\r\nthe ridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present, but low;\r\nand in the Sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing on a\r\nbroad raised eminence.\r\n\r\nIt may naturally be asked whether these remarkable modifications in the\r\nform of the brain affect the intellect of Polish fowls; some writers have\r\nstated that they are extremely stupid, but Bechstein and Mr. Tegetmeier\r\nhave shown that this is by no means generally the case. Nevertheless\r\nBechstein (7/69. 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 3 1793 s. 400.) states\r\nthat he had a Polish hen which \"was crazy, and anxiously wandered about all\r\nday long.\" A hen in my possession was solitary in her habits, and was often\r\nso absorbed in reverie that she could be touched; she was also deficient in\r\nthe most singular manner in the faculty of finding her way, so that, if she\r\nstrayed a hundred yards from her feeding-place, she was completely lost,\r\nand would then obstinately try to proceed in a wrong direction. I have\r\nreceived other and similar accounts of Polish fowls appearing stupid or\r\nhalf-idiotic. (7/70. The 'Field' May 11, 1861. I have received\r\ncommunications to a similar effect from Messrs. Brent and Tegetmeier.)\r\n\r\nTo return to the skull of Polish fowls. The posterior part, viewed\r\nexternally, differs little from that of G. bankiva. In most fowls the\r\nposterior-lateral process of the frontal bone and the process of the\r\nsquamosal bone run together and are ossified near their extremities: this\r\nunion of the two bones, however, is not constant in any breed; and in\r\neleven out of fourteen skulls of crested breeds, these processes were quite\r\ndistinct. These processes, when not united, instead of being inclined\r\nanteriorly, as in all common breeds, descend at right angles to the lower\r\njaw; and in this case the longer axis of the bony cavity of the ear is\r\nlikewise more perpendicular, than in other breeds. When the squamosal\r\nprocess is free instead of expanding at the tip, it is reduced to an\r\nextremely fine and pointed style, of variable length. The pterygoid and\r\nquadrate bones present no differences. The palatine bones are a little more\r\ncurved upwards at their posterior ends. The frontal bones, anteriorly to\r\nthe protuberance, are, as in Dorkings, very broad, but in a variable\r\ndegree. The nasal bones either stand far apart, as in Hamburghs, or almost\r\ntouch each other, and in one instance were ossified together. Each nasal\r\nbone properly sends out in front two long processes of equal lengths,\r\nforming a fork; but in all the Polish skulls, except one, the inner process\r\nwas considerably, but in a variable degree, shortened and somewhat\r\nupturned. In all the skulls, except one, the two ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary, instead of running up between the processes of the nasal\r\nbones and resting on the ethmoid bone, are much shortened and terminate in\r\na blunt, somewhat upturned point. In those skulls in which the nasal bones\r\napproach quite close to each other or are ossified together, it would be\r\nimpossible for the ascending branches of the premaxillary to reach the\r\nethmoid and frontal bones; hence we see that even the relative connection\r\nof the bones has been changed. Apparently in consequence of the branches of\r\nthe premaxillary and of the inner processes of the nasal bones being\r\nsomewhat upturned, the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised and\r\nassume a crescentic outline.\r\n\r\nI must still say a few words on some of the foreign Crested breeds. The\r\nskull of a crested, rumpless, white Turkish fowl was very slightly\r\nprotuberant, and but little perforated; the ascending branches of the\r\npremaxillary were well developed. In another Turkish breed, called\r\nGhoondooks, the skull was considerably protuberant and perforated; the\r\nascending branches of the premaxillary were so much aborted that they\r\nprojected only 1/15th of an inch; and the inner processes of the nasal bone\r\nwere so completely aborted, that the surface where they should have\r\nprojected was quite smooth. Here then we see these two bones modified to an\r\nextreme degree. Of Sultans (another Turkish breed) I examined two skulls;\r\nin that of the female the protuberance was much larger than in the male. In\r\nboth skulls the ascending branches of the premaxillary were very short, and\r\nin both the nasal portion of the inner processes of the nasal bones were\r\nossified together. These Sultan skulls differed from those of English\r\nPolish fowls in the frontal bones, anteriorly to the protuberance, not\r\nbeing broad.\r\n\r\nThe last skull which I need describe is a unique one, lent to me by Mr.\r\nTegetmeier: it resembles a Polish skull in most of its characters, but has\r\nnot the great frontal protuberance; it has, however, two rounded knobs of a\r\ndifferent nature, which stand more in front, above the lachrymal bones.\r\nThese curious knobs, into which the brain does not enter, are separated\r\nfrom each other by a deep medial furrow; and this is perforated by a few\r\nminute pores. The nasal bones stand rather wide apart, with their inner\r\nprocesses, and the ascending branches of the premaxillary, upturned and\r\nshortened. The two knobs no doubt supported the two great horn-like\r\nprojections of the comb.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the\r\nbones of the skull vary in Crested fowls. The protuberance may certainly be\r\ncalled in one sense a monstrosity, as being wholly unlike anything observed\r\nin nature: but as in ordinary cases it is not injurious to the bird, and as\r\nit is strictly inherited, it can hardly in another sense be called a\r\nmonstrosity. A series may be formed commencing with the black-boned Silk\r\nfowl, which has a very small crest with the skull beneath penetrated only\r\nby a few minute orifices, but with no other change in its structure; and\r\nfrom this first stage we may proceed to fowls with a moderately large\r\ncrest, which rests, according to Bechstein, on a fleshy mass, but without\r\nany protuberance in the skull. I may add that I have seen a similar fleshy\r\nor fibrous mass beneath the tuft of feathers on the head of the Tufted\r\nduck; and in this case there was no actual protuberance in the skull, but\r\nit had become a little more globular. Lastly, when we come to fowls with a\r\nlargely developed crest, the skull becomes largely protuberant and is\r\nperforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces. The close relation\r\nbetween the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is shown in another\r\nway; for Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that if chickens lately hatched be\r\nselected with a large bony protuberance, when adult they will have a large\r\ncrest. There can be no doubt that in former times the breeder of Polish\r\nfowls attended solely to the crest, and not to the skull; nevertheless, by\r\nincreasing the crest, in which he has been wonderfully successful, he has\r\nunintentionally made the skull protuberant to an astonishing degree; and\r\nthrough correlation of growth, he has at the same time affected the form\r\nand relative connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of\r\nthe orifice of the nose, the breadth of the frontal bones, the shape of the\r\npost-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones, the direction of\r\nthe axis of the bony cavity of the ear, and lastly the internal\r\nconfiguration of the whole skull together with the shape of the brain.\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 37. SIXTH CERVICAL VERTEBRA, natural size, viewed laterally. A.\r\nWild Gallus bankiva. B. Cochin cock.)\r\n\r\nIn G. bankiva there are fourteen cervical, seven dorsal with ribs,\r\napparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal vertebrae (7/71. It\r\nappears that I have not correctly designated the several groups of\r\nvertebrae, for a great authority, Mr. W.K. Parker ('Transact. Zoolog. Soc.'\r\nvolume 5 page 198) specifies 16 cervical, 4 dorsal, 15 lumbar, and 6 caudal\r\nvertebrae in this genus. But I have used the same terms in all the\r\nfollowing descriptions.); but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed\r\nthat I am not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison of the\r\ntotal number of vertebrae in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of\r\nsix caudal vertebrae, because the basal one is almost completely anchylosed\r\nwith the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the caudal\r\nvertebrae agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebrae are, as just\r\nstated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three skeletons in a fit\r\nstate for examination, in five of them, namely, in two Games, in two\r\npencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs,\r\nwhich, though small, were perfectly developed with a double articulation.\r\nThe presence of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much\r\nimportance, for all the cervical vertebrae bear representatives of ribs;\r\nbut their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces the size of the\r\npassages in the transverse processes, and makes this vertebra exactly like\r\nthe first dorsal vertebra. The addition of these little ribs does not\r\naffect the fourteenth cervical alone, for properly the ribs of the first\r\ntrue dorsal vertebra are destitute of processes; but in some of the\r\nskeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair\r\nof true ribs had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow\r\nhas only nine, and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebrae (7/72.\r\nMacgillivray 'British Birds' volume 1 page 25.), we need feel no surprise\r\nat the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being, as it appears,\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nThere are seven dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never\r\nanchylosed with the succeeding four, which are generally anchylosed\r\ntogether. In one Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal vertebrae were\r\nfree. In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free; generally the sixth is\r\nfree (as in G. bankiva), but sometimes only at its posterior end, where in\r\ncontact with the seventh. The seventh dorsal vertebra, in every case\r\nexcepting in one Spanish cock, was anchylosed with the lumbar vertebrae. So\r\nthat the degree to which these middle dorsal vertebrae are anchylosed is\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nSeven is the normal number of true ribs, but in two skeletons of the Sultan\r\nfowl (in which the fourteenth cervical vertebra was not furnished with\r\nlittle ribs) there were eight pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed\r\non a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in G. bankiva; the\r\nsternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the\r\nsternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth\r\ncervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs are included, eight\r\npairs; but in one Game cock, in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished\r\nwith ribs, there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in\r\nthis case did not have processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in\r\nother skeletons; in this Game cock, as far as could be judged from the\r\nappearance of the lumbar vertebrae, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs\r\nwas missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair\r\nattached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to\r\neight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The\r\nsternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is\r\ncompletely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to count\r\nthe lumbo-sacral vertebrae; but they certainly do not correspond in shape\r\nor number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebrae are closely\r\nsimilar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the\r\nbasal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in length, not\r\nbeing shorter in Cochins, with their short tail-feathers, than in other\r\nbreeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the caudal vertebrae were a little\r\nelongated. In three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number,\r\nand anchylosed together into a misformed mass.\r\n\r\nIn the individual vertebrae the differences in structure are very slight.\r\nIn the atlas the cavity for the occipital condyle is either ossified into a\r\nring, or is, as in Bankiva, open on its upper margin. The upper arc of the\r\nspinal canal is a little more arched    in Cochins, in conformity with\r\nthe shape of the occipital foramen, than in G. bankiva. In several\r\nskeletons a difference, but not of much importance, may be observed, which\r\ncommences at the fourth cervical vertebra, and is greatest at about the\r\nsixth, seventh, or eighth vertebra; this consists in the haemal descending\r\nprocesses being united to the body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress.\r\nThis structure may be observed in Cochins, Polish, some Hamburghs, and\r\nprobably other breeds; but is absent, or barely developed, in Game,\r\nDorking, Spanish, Bantam, and several other breeds examined by me. On the\r\ndorsal surface of the sixth cervical vertebra in Cochins three prominent\r\npoints are more strongly developed than in the corresponding vertebra of\r\nthe Game fowl or G. bankiva.\r\n\r\nPELVIS.\r\n\r\nThis differs in some few points in the several skeletons. The anterior\r\nmargin of the ilium seems at first to vary much in outline, but this is\r\nchiefly due to the degree to which the margin in the middle part is\r\nossified to the crest of the vertebrae; the outline, however, does differ\r\nin being more truncated in Bantams, and more rounded in certain breeds, as\r\nin Cochins. The outline of the ischiadic foramen differs considerably,\r\nbeing nearly circular in Bantams, instead of egg-shaped as in the Bankiva,\r\nand more regularly oval in some skeletons, as in the Spanish. The obturator\r\nnotch is also much less elongated in some skeletons than in others. The end\r\nof the pubic bone presents the greatest difference; being hardly enlarged\r\nin the Bankiva; considerably and gradually enlarged in Cochins, and in a\r\nlesser degree in some other breeds; and abruptly enlarged in Bantams. In\r\none Bantam this bone extended very little beyond the extremity of the\r\nischium. The whole pelvis in this latter bird differed widely in its\r\nproportions, being far broader proportionally to its length than in\r\nBankiva.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 38. EXTREMITY OF THE FURCULA, of natural size, viewed laterally. A.\r\nWild Gallus bankiva. B. Spangled Polish Fowl. C. Spanish Fowl. D. Dorking\r\nFowl.)\r\n\r\nSTERNUM.\r\n\r\nThis bone is generally so much deformed that it is scarcely possible to\r\ncompare its shape strictly in the several breeds. The form of the\r\ntriangular extremity of the lateral processes differs considerably, being\r\neither almost equilateral or much elongated. The front margin of the crest\r\nis more or less perpendicular and varies greatly, as does the curvature of\r\nthe posterior end, and the flatness of the lower surface. The outline of\r\nthe manubrial process also varies, being wedge-shaped in the Bankiva, and\r\nrounded in the Spanish breed. The FURCULUM differs in being more or less\r\narched, and greatly, as may be seen in the accompanying outlines, in the\r\nshape of the terminal plate; but the shape of this part differed a little\r\nin two skeletons of the wild Bankiva. The CORACOID presents no difference\r\nworth notice. The SCAPULA varies in shape, being of nearly uniform breadth\r\nin Bankiva, much broader in the middle in the Polish fowl, and abruptly\r\nnarrowed towards the apex in the two Sultan fowls.\r\n\r\nI carefully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing, relatively to\r\nthe same bones in the wild Bankiva, in the following breeds, which I\r\nthought were the most likely to differ; namely, in Cochin, Dorking,\r\nSpanish, Polish, Burmese Bantam, Frizzled Indian, and black-boned Silk\r\nfowls; and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process,\r\narticulation, and pore agreed, though the bones differed greatly in size.\r\nThe agreement is far more absolute than in other parts of the skeleton. In\r\nstating this, I do not refer to the relative thickness and length of the\r\nseveral bones; for the tarsi varied considerably in both these respects.\r\nBut the other limb-bones varied little even in relative length.]\r\n\r\nFinally, I have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say\r\nwhether any of the foregoing differences, except in the skull, are\r\ncharacteristic of the several breeds. Apparently some differences are more\r\ncommon in certain breeds than in others,--as an additional rib to the\r\nfourteenth cervical vertebra in Hamburghs and Games, and the breadth of the\r\nend of the pubic bone in Cochins. Both skeletons of the Sultan fowl had\r\neight dorsal vertebrae, and the end of the scapula in both was somewhat\r\nattenuated. In the skull, the deep medial furrow in the frontal bones and\r\nthe vertically elongated occipital foramen seem to be characteristic of\r\nCochins; as is the great breadth of the frontal bones in Dorkings; the\r\nseparation and open spaces between the tips of the ascending branches of\r\nthe premaxillaries and nasal bones, as well as the front part of the skull\r\nbeing but little depressed, characterise Hamburghs; the globular shape of\r\nthe posterior part of the skull seems to be characteristic of laced\r\nBantams; and lastly, the protuberance of the skull with the ascending\r\nbranches of the premaxillaries partially aborted, together with the other\r\ndifferences before specified, are eminently characteristic of Polish and\r\nother Crested fowls.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking result of my examination of the skeleton is the great\r\nvariability of all the bones except those of the extremities. To a certain\r\nextent we can understand why the skeleton fluctuates so much in structure;\r\nfowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life, and their whole\r\norganisation has thus been rendered variable; but the breeder is quite\r\nindifferent to, and never intentionally selects, any modification in the\r\nskeleton. External characters, if not attended to by man, such as the\r\nnumber of the tail and wing feathers and their relative lengths, which in\r\nwild birds are generally constant,--fluctuate in our domestic fowls in the\r\nsame manner as the several parts of the skeleton. An additional toe is a\r\n\"point\" in Dorkings, and has become a fixed character, but is variable in\r\nCochins and Silk fowls. The colour of the plumage and the form of the comb\r\nare in most breeds, or even sub-breeds, eminently fixed characters; but in\r\nDorkings these points have not been attended to, and are variable. When any\r\nmodification in the skeleton is related to some external character which\r\nman values, it has been, unintentionally on his part, acted on by\r\nselection, and has become more or less fixed. We see this in the wonderful\r\nprotuberance of the skull, which supports the crest of feathers in Polish\r\nfowls, and which by correlation has affected other parts of the skull. We\r\nsee the same result in the two protuberances which support the horns in the\r\nhorned fowl, and in the flattened shape of the front of the skull in\r\nHamburghs consequent on their flattened and broad \"rose-combs.\" We know not\r\nin the least whether additional ribs, or the changed outline of the\r\noccipital foramen, or the changed form of the scapula, or of the extremity\r\nof the furculum, are in any way correlated with other structures, or have\r\narisen from the changed conditions and habits of life to which our fowls\r\nhave been subjected; but there is no reason to doubt that these various\r\nmodifications in the skeleton could be rendered, either by direct\r\nselection, or by the selection of correlated structures, as constant and as\r\ncharacteristic of each breed, as are the size and shape of the body, the\r\ncolour of the plumage, and the form of the comb.\r\n\r\n[EFFECTS OF THE DISUSE OF PARTS.\r\n\r\nJudging from the habits of our European gallinaceous birds, Gallus bankiva\r\nin its native haunts would use its legs and wings more than do our domestic\r\nfowls, which rarely fly except to their roosts. The Silk and the Frizzled\r\nfowls, from having imperfect wing-feathers, cannot fly at all; and there is\r\nreason to believe that both these breeds are ancient, so that their\r\nprogenitors during many generations cannot have flown. The Cochins, also,\r\nfrom their short wings and heavy bodies, can hardly fly up to a low perch.\r\nTherefore in these breeds, especially in the two first, a considerable\r\ndiminution in the wing-bones might have been expected, but this is not the\r\ncase. In every specimen, after disarticulating and cleaning the bones, I\r\ncarefully compared the relative length of the two main bones of the wing to\r\neach other, and of the two main bones of the leg to each other, with those\r\nof G. bankiva; and it was surprising to see (except in the case of the\r\ntarsi) how exactly the same relative length had been retained. This fact is\r\ncurious, from showing how truly the proportions of an organ may be\r\ninherited, although not fully exercised during many generations. I then\r\ncompared in several breeds the length of the femur and tibia with the\r\nhumerus and ulna, and likewise these same bones with those of G. bankiva;\r\nthe result was that the wing-bones in all the breeds (except the Burmese\r\nJumper, which has unnaturally short legs, are slightly shortened relatively\r\nto the leg-bones; but the decrease is so slight that it may be due to the\r\nstandard specimen of G. bankiva having accidentally had wings of slightly\r\ngreater length than usual; so that the measurements are not worth giving.\r\nBut it deserves notice that the Silk and Frizzled fowls, which are quite\r\nincapable of flight, had their wings LESS reduced relatively to their legs\r\nthan in almost any other breed! We have seen with domesticated pigeons that\r\nthe bones of the wings are somewhat reduced in length, whilst the primary\r\nfeathers are rather increased in length, and it is just possible, though\r\nnot probable, that in the Silk and Frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease\r\nin the length of the wing-bones from disuse may have been checked through\r\nthe law of compensation, by the decreased growth of the wing-feathers, and\r\nconsequent increased supply of nutriment. The wing-bones, however, in both\r\nthese breeds, are found to be slightly reduced in length when judged by the\r\nstandard of the length of the sternum or head, relatively to these same\r\nparts in G. bankiva.\r\n\r\nThe actual weight of the main bones of the leg and wing in twelve breeds is\r\ngiven in the two first columns in Table 7.I. The calculated weight of the\r\nwing-bones relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison with the leg and\r\nwing-bones of G. bankiva, are given in the third column,--the weight of the\r\nwing-bones in G. bankiva being called a hundred. (7/73. It may be well to\r\nexplain how the calculation has been made for the third column. In G.\r\nbankiva the leg-bones are to the wing-bones as 86 : 54, or as (neglecting\r\ndecimals) 100 : 62;-in Cochins as 311 : 162, or as 100 : 52;--in Dorkings\r\nas 557 : 248, or as 100 : 44; and so on for the other breeds. We thus get\r\nthe series of 62, 52, 44 for the relative weights of the wing-bones in G.\r\nbankiva, Cochins, Dorkings, etc. And now taking 100, instead of 62, for the\r\nweight of the wing-bones in G. bankiva, we get, by another rule of three,\r\n83 as the weight of the wing-bones in Cochins; 70 in the Dorkings; and so\r\non for the remainder of the third column in the table.)\r\n\r\nTABLE 7.I.

Silk (black-boned) -- female      88      57     103\r\n\r\nIn the eight first birds, belonging to distinct breeds, in this table, we\r\nsee a decided reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Frizzled fowl, which cannot fly, the reduction is carried to\r\nthe greatest extent, namely, to thirty-three per cent of their proper\r\nproportional weight. In the next four birds, including the Silk hen, which\r\nis incapable of flight, we see that the wings, relatively to the legs, are\r\nslightly increased in weight; but it should be observed that, if in these\r\nbirds the legs had become from any cause reduced in weight, this would give\r\nthe false appearance of the wings having increased in relative weight. Now\r\na reduction of this nature has certainly occurred with the Burmese Jumper,\r\nin which the legs are abnormally short, and in the two Hamburghs and Silk\r\nfowl, the legs, though not short, are formed of remarkably thin and light\r\nbones. I make these statements, not judging by mere eyesight, but after\r\nhaving calculated the weights of the leg-bones relatively to those of G.\r\nbankiva, according to the only two standards of comparison which I could\r\nuse, namely, the relative lengths of the head and sternum; for I do not\r\nknow the weight of the body in G. bankiva, which would have been a better\r\nstandard. According to these standards, the leg-bones in these four fowls\r\nare in a marked manner far lighter than in any other breed. It may\r\ntherefore be concluded that in all cases in which the legs have not been\r\nthrough some unknown cause much reduced in weight, the wing-bones have\r\nbecome reduced in weight relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison with\r\nthose of G. bankiva. And this reduction of weight may, I apprehend, safely\r\nbe attributed to disuse.\r\n\r\nTo make Table 7.I. quite satisfactory, it ought to have been shown that in\r\nthe eight first birds the leg-bones have not actually increased in weight\r\nout of due proportion with the rest of the body; this I cannot show, from\r\nnot knowing, as already remarked, the weight of the wild Bankiva. (7/74.\r\nMr. Blyth (in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 1 1848 page\r\n456) gives 3 1/4 pounds as the weight of a full-grown male G. bankiva; but\r\nfrom what I have seen of the skins and skeletons of various breeds, I\r\ncannot believe that my two specimens of G. bankiva could have weighed so\r\nmuch.) I am indeed inclined to suspect that the leg-bones in the Dorking,\r\nNo. 2 in the table, are proportionally too heavy; but this bird was a very\r\nlarge one, weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces, though very thin. Its leg-bones were\r\nmore than ten times as heavy as those of the Burmese Jumper! I tried to\r\nascertain the length both of the leg-bones and wing-bones relatively to\r\nother parts of the body and skeleton: but the whole organisation in these\r\nbirds, which have been so long domesticated, has become so variable, that\r\nno certain conclusions could be reached. For instance, the legs of the\r\nabove Dorking cock were nearly three-quarters of an inch too short\r\nrelatively to the length of the sternum, and more than three-quarters of an\r\ninch too long relatively to the length of the skull, in comparison with\r\nthese same parts in G. bankiva.\r\n\r\nTABLE 7.II.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1.

In the third column we have the calculated\r\ndepth of the crest, relatively to the length of the sternum, in comparison\r\nwith these same parts in G. bankiva. (7/75. The third column is calculated\r\non the same principle as explained in footnote 7/73 above.)\r\n\r\nBy looking to the third column we see that in every case the depth of the\r\ncrest relatively to the length of the sternum, in comparison with G.\r\nbankiva, is diminished, generally between 10 and 20 per cent. But the\r\ndegree of reduction varies much, partly in consequence of the frequently\r\ndeformed state of the sternum. In the Silk fowl, which cannot fly, the\r\ncrest is 34 per cent less deep than what it ought to have been. This\r\nreduction of the crest in all the breeds probably accounts for the great\r\nvariability, before referred to, in the curvature of the furculum, and in\r\nthe shape of its sternal extremity. Medical men believe that the abnormal\r\nform of the spine so commonly observed in women of the higher ranks results\r\nfrom the attached muscles not being fully exercised. So it is with our\r\ndomestic fowls, for they use their pectoral muscles but little, and, out of\r\ntwenty-five sternums examined by me, three alone were perfectly\r\nsymmetrical, ten were moderately crooked, and twelve were deformed to an\r\nextreme degree. Mr. Romanes, however, believes that the malformation is due\r\nto fowls whilst young resting their sternums on the sticks on which they\r\nroost.]\r\n\r\nFinally, we may conclude with respect to the various breeds of the fowl,\r\nthat the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a very\r\nslight degree; that they have certainly become lighter relatively to the\r\nleg-bones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not unnaturally\r\nshort or delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to which the pectoral\r\nmuscles are attached, has invariably become less prominent, the whole\r\nsternum being also extremely liable to deformity. These results we may\r\nattribute to the lessened use of the wings.\r\n\r\nCORRELATION OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nI will here sum up the few facts which I have collected on this obscure,\r\nbut important, subject. In Cochin and Game fowls there is perhaps some\r\nrelation between the colour of the plumage and the darkness of the egg-\r\nshell. In Sultans the additional sickle-feathers in the tail are apparently\r\nrelated to the general redundancy of the plumage, as shown by the feathered\r\nlegs, large crest, and beard. In two tailless fowls which I examined the\r\noil-gland was aborted. A large crest of feathers, as Mr. Tegetmeier has\r\nremarked, seems always accompanied by a great diminution or almost entire\r\nabsence of the comb. A large beard is similarly accompanied by diminished\r\nor absent wattles. These latter cases apparently come under the law of\r\ncompensation or balancement of growth. A large beard beneath the lower jaw\r\nand a large top-knot on the skull often go together. The comb when of any\r\npeculiar shape, as with Horned, Spanish, and Hamburgh fowls, affects in a\r\ncorresponding manner the underlying skull; and we have seen how wonderfully\r\nthis is the case with Crested fowls when the crest is largely developed.\r\nWith the protuberance of the frontal bones the shape of the internal\r\nsurface of the skull and of the brain is greatly modified. The presence of\r\na crest influences in some unknown way the development of the ascending\r\nbranches of the premaxillary bone, and of the inner processes of the nasal\r\nbones; and likewise the shape of the external orifice of the nostrils.\r\nThere is a plain and curious correlation between a crest of feathers and\r\nthe imperfectly ossified condition of the skull. Not only does this hold\r\ngood with nearly all crested fowls, but likewise with tufted ducks, and as\r\nDr. Gunther informs me with tufted geese in Germany.\r\n\r\nLastly, the feathers composing the crest in male Polish fowls resemble\r\nhackles, and differ greatly in shape from those in the crest of the female.\r\nThe neck, wing-coverts, and loins in the male bird are properly covered\r\nwith hackles, and it would appear that feathers of this shape have spread\r\nby correlation to the head of the male. This little fact is interesting;\r\nbecause, though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds have their heads\r\nsimilarly ornamented, yet there is often a difference in the size and shape\r\nof feathers forming their crests. Furthermore, there is in some cases, as\r\nin the male Gold and in the male Amherst pheasants (P. pictus and\r\namherstiae), a close relation in colour, as well as in structure, between\r\nthe plumes on the head and on the loins. It would therefore appear that the\r\nsame law has regulated the state of the feathers on the head and body, both\r\nwith species living under natural conditions, and with birds which have\r\nvaried under domestication.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VIII.\r\n\r\nDUCK--GOOSE--PEACOCK--TURKEY--GUINEA-FOWL--CANARY-BIRD--GOLD-FISH--HIVE-\r\nBEES--SILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\nDUCKS, SEVERAL BREEDS OF.\r\nPROGRESS OF DOMESTICATION.\r\nORIGIN OF FROM THE COMMON WILD-DUCK.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT BREEDS.\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.\r\nEFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE LIMB-BONES.\r\n\r\nGOOSE, ANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED.\r\nLITTLE VARIATION OF.\r\nSEBASTOPOL BREED.\r\n\r\nPEACOCK, ORIGIN OF BLACK-SHOULDERED BREED.\r\n\r\nTURKEY, BREEDS OF.\r\nCROSSED WITH THE UNITED STATES SPECIES.\r\nEFFECTS OF CLIMATE ON.\r\n\r\nGUINEA-FOWL, CANARY-BIRD, GOLD-FISH, HIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\nSILK-MOTHS, SPECIES AND BREEDS OF.\r\nANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED.\r\nCARE IN THEIR SELECTION.\r\nDIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT RACES.\r\nIN THE EGG, CATERPILLAR, AND COCOON STATES.\r\nINHERITANCE OF CHARACTERS.\r\nIMPERFECT WINGS.\r\nLOST INSTINCTS.\r\nCORRELATED CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nI will, as in previous cases, first briefly describe the chief domestic\r\nbreeds of the duck:--\r\n\r\n[BREED 1. COMMON DOMESTIC DUCK.\r\n\r\nVaries much in colour and in proportions, and differs in instincts and\r\ndisposition from the wild duck. There are several sub-breeds:--\r\n\r\n1. The Aylesbury, of great size, white, with pale-yellow beak and legs;\r\nabdominal dermal sack largely developed.\r\n\r\n2. The Rouen, of great size, coloured like the wild duck, with green or\r\nmottled beak; dermal sack largely developed.\r\n\r\n3. Tufted Duck, with a large top-knot of fine downy feathers, supported on\r\na fleshy mass, with the skull perforated beneath. The top-knot in a duck\r\nwhich I imported from Holland was two and a half inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n4. Labrador (or Canadian, or Buenos Ayres, or East Indian); plumage\r\nentirely black; beak broader, relatively to its length, than in the wild\r\nduck; eggs slightly tinted with black. This sub-breed perhaps ought to be\r\nranked as a breed; it includes two sub-varieties, one as large as the\r\ncommon domestic duck, which I have kept alive, and the other smaller and\r\noften capable of flight. (8/1. 'Poultry Chronicle' 1854 volume 2 page 91\r\nand volume 1 page 330.) I presume it is this latter sub-variety which has\r\nbeen described in France (8/2. Dr. Turral 'Bull. Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 7\r\n1860 page 541.) as flying well, being rather wild, and when cooked having\r\nthe flavour of the wild duck; nevertheless this sub-variety is polygamous,\r\nlike other domesticated ducks and unlike the wild duck. These black\r\nLabrador ducks breed true; but a case is given by Dr. Turral of the French\r\nsub-variety producing young with some white feathers on the head and neck,\r\nand with an ochre-coloured patch on the breast.\r\n\r\nBREED 2. HOOK-BILLED DUCK.\r\n\r\nThis bird presents an extraordinary appearance from the downward curvature\r\nof the beak. The head is often tufted. The common colour is white, but some\r\nare coloured like wild ducks. It is an ancient breed, having been noticed\r\nin 1676. (8/3. Willughby's 'Ornithology' by Ray page 381. This breed is\r\nalso figured by Albin in 1734 in his 'Nat. Hist. of Birds' volume 2 page\r\n86.) It shows its prolonged domestication by almost incessantly laying\r\neggs, like the fowls which are called everlasting layers. (8/4. F. Cuvier\r\nin 'Annales du Museum' tome 9 page 128 says that moulting and incubation\r\nalone stops these ducks laying. Mr. B.P. Brent makes a similar remark in\r\nthe 'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page 512.)\r\n\r\nBREED 3. CALL DUCK.\r\n\r\nRemarkable from its small size, and from the extraordinary loquacity of the\r\nfemale. Beak short. These birds are either white, or coloured like the wild\r\nduck.\r\n\r\nBREED 4. PENGUIN DUCK.\r\n\r\nThis is the most remarkable of all the breeds, and seems to have originated\r\nin the Malayan archipelago. It walks with its body extremely erect, and\r\nwith its thin neck stretched straight upwards. Beak rather short. Tail\r\nupturned, including only 18 feathers. Femur and metatarsus elongated.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all naturalists admit that the several breeds are descended from the\r\ncommon wild duck (Anas boschas); most fanciers, on the other hand, take as\r\nusual a very different view. (8/5. Rev. E.S. Dixon 'Ornamental and Domestic\r\nPoultry' 1848 page 117. Mr. B.P. Brent in 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 3 1855\r\npage 512.) Unless we deny that domestication, prolonged during centuries,\r\ncan affect even such unimportant characters as colour, size, and in a\r\nslight degree proportional dimensions and mental disposition, there is no\r\nreason whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from the\r\ncommon wild species, for the one differs from the other in no important\r\ncharacter. We have some historical evidence with respect to the period and\r\nprogress of the domestication of the duck. It was unknown (8/6. Crawfurd on\r\nthe 'Relation of Domesticated Animals to Civilisation' read before the\r\nBrit. Assoc. at Oxford 1860.) to the ancient Egyptians, to the Jews of the\r\nOld Testament, and to the Greeks of the Homeric period. About eighteen\r\ncenturies ago Columella (8/7. Dureau de La Malle in 'Annales des Sciences\r\nNat.' tome 17 page 164; and tome 21 page 55. Rev. E.S. Dixon 'Ornamental\r\nPoultry' page 118. Tame ducks were not known in Aristotle's time, as\r\nremarked by Volz in his 'Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte' 1852 s. 78.) and\r\nVarro speak of the necessity of keeping ducks in netted enclosures like\r\nother wild fowl, so that at this period there was danger of their flying\r\naway. Moreover, the plan recommended by Columella to those who wish to\r\nincrease their stock of ducks, namely, to collect the eggs of the wild bird\r\nand to place them under a hen, shows, as Mr. Dixon remarks, \"that the duck\r\nhad not at this time become a naturalised and prolific inmate of the Roman\r\npoultry-yard.\" The origin of the domestic duck from the wild species is\r\nrecognised in nearly every language of Europe, as Aldrovandi long ago\r\nremarked, by the same name being applied to both. The wild duck has a wide\r\nrange from the Himalayas to North America. It crosses readily with the\r\ndomestic bird, and the crossed offspring are perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\nBoth in North America and Europe the wild duck has been found easy to tame\r\nand breed. In Sweden this experiment was carefully tried by Tiburtius; he\r\nsucceeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations, but, though they\r\nwere treated like common ducks, they did not vary even in a single feather.\r\nThe young birds suffered from being allowed to swim about in cold water\r\n(8/8. I quote this account from 'Die Enten- und Schwanenzucht' Ulm 1828 s.\r\n143. See Audubon 'Ornithological Biography' volume 3 page 168 on the taming\r\nof ducks on the Mississippi. For the same fact in England see Mr. Waterton\r\nin Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 8 1835 page 542; and Mr. St. John\r\n'Wild Sports and Nat. Hist. of the Highlands' 1846 page 129.), as is known\r\nto be the case, though the fact is a strange one, with the young of the\r\ncommon domestic duck. An accurate and well-known observer in England (8/9.\r\nMr. E. Hewitt in 'Journal of Horticulture' 1862 page 773; and 1863 page\r\n39.) has described in detail his often repeated and successful experiments\r\nin domesticating the wild duck. Young birds are easily reared from eggs\r\nhatched under a bantam; but to succeed it is indispensable not to place the\r\neggs of both the wild and tame duck under the same hen, for in this case\r\n\"the young wild ducks die off, leaving their more hardy brethren in\r\nundisturbed possession of their foster-mother's care. The difference of\r\nhabit at the onset in the newly-hatched ducklings almost entails such a\r\nresult to a certainty.\" The wild ducklings were from the first quite tame\r\ntowards those who took care of them as long as they wore the same clothes,\r\nand likewise to the dogs and cats of the house. They would even snap with\r\ntheir beaks at the dogs, and drive them away from any spot which they\r\ncoveted. But they were much alarmed at strange men and dogs. Differently\r\nfrom what occurred in Sweden, Mr. Hewitt found that his young birds always\r\nchanged and deteriorated in character in the course of two or three\r\ngenerations; notwithstanding that great care was taken to prevent their\r\ncrossing with tame ducks. After the third generation his birds lost the\r\nelegant carriage of the wild species, and began to acquire the gait of the\r\ncommon duck. They increased in size in each generation, and their legs\r\nbecame less fine. The white collar round the neck of the mallard became\r\nbroader and less regular, and some of the longer primary wing-feathers\r\nbecame more or less white. When this occurred, Mr. Hewitt destroyed nearly\r\nthe whole of his stock and procured fresh eggs from wild nests; so that he\r\nnever bred the same family for more than five or six generations. His birds\r\ncontinued to pair together, and never became polygamous like the common\r\ndomestic duck. I have given these details, because no other case, as far as\r\nI know, has been so carefully recorded by a competent observer of the\r\nprogress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a\r\ndomestic condition.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations there can hardly be a doubt that the wild duck is\r\nthe parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to other species\r\nfor the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely, Penguin, Call, Hook-\r\nbilled, Tufted, and Labrador ducks. I will not repeat the arguments used in\r\nthe previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient times\r\ndomesticated several species since become unknown or extinct, though ducks\r\nare not readily exterminated in the wild state;--on some of the supposed\r\nparent-species having had abnormal characters in comparison with all the\r\nother species of the genus, as with Hook-billed and Penguin ducks;--on all\r\nthe breeds, as far as is known being fertile together (8/10. I have met\r\nwith several statements on the fertility of the several breeds when\r\ncrossed. Mr. Yarrell assured me that Call and common ducks are perfectly\r\nfertile together. I crossed Hook-billed and common ducks, and a Penguin and\r\nLabrador, and the crossed Ducks were quite fertile, though they were not\r\nbred inter se, so that the experiment was not fully tried. Some half-bred\r\nPenguins and Labradors were again crossed with Penguins, and subsequently\r\nbred by me inter se, and they were extremely fertile.);--on all the breeds\r\nhaving the same general disposition, instinct, etc. But one fact bearing on\r\nthis question may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species alone,\r\nnamely, the male of A. boschas, has its four middle tail-feathers curled\r\nupwardly; now in every one of the above-named domestic breeds these curled\r\nfeathers exist, and on the supposition that they are descended from\r\ndistinct species, we must assume that man formerly hit upon species all of\r\nwhich had this now unique character. Moreover, sub-varieties of each breed\r\nare coloured almost exactly like the wild duck, as I have seen with the\r\nlargest and smallest breeds, namely Rouens and Call ducks, and, as Mr.\r\nBrent states (8/11. 'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page 512.), is the\r\ncase with Hook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a\r\nwhite Aylesbury drake and a black Labrador duck, and some of the ducklings\r\nas they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Penguins, I have not seen many specimens, and none were\r\ncoloured precisely like the wild duck; but Sir James Brooke sent me three\r\nskins from Lombok and Bali, in the Malayan archipelago; the two females\r\nwere paler and more rufous than the wild duck, and the drake differed in\r\nhaving the whole under and upper surface (excepting the neck, tail-coverts,\r\ntail, and wings) silver-grey, finely pencilled with dark lines, closely\r\nlike certain parts of the plumage of the wild mallard. But I found this\r\ndrake to be identical in every feather with a variety of the common breed\r\nprocured from a farm-yard in Kent, and I have occasionally elsewhere seen\r\nsimilar specimens. The occurrence of a duck bred under so peculiar a\r\nclimate as that of the Malayan archipelago, where the wild species does not\r\nexist, with exactly the same plumage as may occasionally be seen in our\r\nfarm-yards, is a fact worth notice. Nevertheless the climate of the Malayan\r\narchipelago apparently tends to cause the duck to vary much, for Zollinger\r\n(8/12. 'Journal of the Indian Archipelago' volume 5 page 334.), speaking of\r\nthe Penguin breed, says that in Lombok \"there is an unusual and very\r\nwonderful variety of ducks.\" One Penguin drake which I kept alive differed\r\nfrom those of which the skins were sent me from Lombok, in having its\r\nbreast and back partially coloured with chestnut-brown, thus more closely\r\nresembling the Mallard.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, more especially from the drakes of all the breeds\r\nhaving curled tail-feathers, and from certain sub-varieties in each breed\r\noccasionally resembling in general plumage the wild duck, we may conclude\r\nwith confidence that all the breeds are descended from A. boschas.\r\n\r\n[I will now notice some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several\r\nbreeds. The eggs vary in colour; some common ducks laying pale-greenish and\r\nothers quite white eggs. The eggs which are first laid during each season\r\nby the black Labrador duck, are tinted black, as if rubbed with ink. A good\r\nobserver assured me that one year his ducks of this breed laid almost\r\nperfectly white eggs. Another curious case shows what singular variations\r\nsometimes occur and are inherited; Mr. Hansell (8/13. 'The Zoologist'\r\nvolumes 7, 8 1849-1850 page 2353.) relates that he had a common duck which\r\nalways laid eggs with the yolk of a dark-brown colour like melted glue; and\r\nthe young ducks, hatched from these eggs, laid the same kind of eggs, so\r\nthat the breed had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 39. SKULLS, viewed laterally, reduced to two-thirds of the natural\r\nsize. A. Wild Duck. B. Hook-billed Duck.)\r\n\r\nThe Hook-billed duck is highly remarkable (see figure 39, of skull); and\r\nits peculiar beak has been inherited at least since the year 1676. This\r\nstructure is evidently analogous with that described in the Bagadotten\r\ncarrier pigeon. Mr. Brent (8/14. 'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page\r\n512.) says that, when Hook-billed ducks are crossed with common ducks,\r\n\"many young ones are produced with the upper mandible shorter than the\r\nlower, which not unfrequently causes the death of the bird.\" With ducks a\r\ntuft of feathers on the head is by no means a rare occurrence; namely, in\r\nthe True-tufted breed, the Hook-billed, the common farm-yard kind, and in a\r\nduck having no other peculiarity which was sent to me from the Malayan\r\narchipelago. The tuft is only so far interesting as it affects the skull,\r\nwhich is thus rendered slightly more globular, and is perforated by\r\nnumerous apertures. Call ducks are remarkable from their extraordinary\r\nloquacity: the drake only hisses like common drakes; nevertheless, when\r\npaired with the common duck, he transmits to his female offspring a strong\r\nquacking tendency. This loquacity seems at first a surprising character to\r\nhave been acquired under domestication. But the voice varies in the\r\ndifferent breeds; Mr. Brent (8/15. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 3 1855 page\r\n312. With respect to Rouens see ditto volume 1 1854 page 167.) says that\r\nHook-billed ducks are very loquacious, and that Rouens utter a \"dull, loud,\r\nand monotonous cry, easily distinguishable by an experienced ear.\" As the\r\nloquacity of the Call duck is highly serviceable, these birds being used in\r\ndecoys, this quality may have been increased by selection. For instance,\r\nColonel Hawker says, if young wild ducks cannot be got for a decoy, \"by way\r\nof make-shift, SELECT tame birds which are the most clamorous, even if\r\ntheir colour should not be like that of wild ones.\" (8/16. Col. Hawker\r\n'Instructions to young Sportsmen' quoted by Mr. Dixon in his 'Ornamental\r\nPoultry' page 125.) It has been erroneously asserted that Call ducks hatch\r\ntheir eggs in less time than common ducks. (8/17. 'Cottage Gardener' April\r\n9, 1861.)\r\n\r\nThe Penguin duck is the most remarkable of all the breeds; the thin neck\r\nand body are carried erect; the wings are small; the tail is upturned; and\r\nthe thigh-bones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened in proportion\r\nwith the same bones in the wild duck. In five specimens examined by me\r\nthere were only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty as in the wild\r\nduck; but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen tail-feathers in two\r\nLabrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three specimens, there were twenty-\r\nseven or twenty-eight scutellae, whereas in two wild ducks there were\r\nthirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when crossed transmits with much\r\npower its peculiar form of body and gait to its offspring; this was\r\nmanifest with some hybrids raised in the Zoological Gardens between one of\r\nthese birds and the Egyptian goose (Anser aegyptiacus) (8/18. These hybrids\r\nhave been described by M. Selys-Longchamps in the 'Bulletins (tome 12 No\r\n10) Acad. Roy. de Bruxelles.'), and likewise with some mongrels which I\r\nraised between the Penguin and Labrador duck. I am not much surprised that\r\nsome writers should maintain that this breed must be descended from an\r\nunknown and distinct species; but from the reasons already assigned, it\r\nseems to me far more probable that it is the descendant, much modified by\r\ndomestication under an unnatural climate, of Anas boschas.\r\n\r\nOSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe skulls of the several breeds differ from each other and from the skull\r\nof the wild duck in very little except in the proportional length and\r\ncurvature of the premaxillaries. These latter bones in the Call duck are\r\nshort, and a line drawn from their extremities to the summit of the skull\r\nis nearly straight, instead of being concave as in the common duck; so that\r\nthe skull resembles that of a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (figure\r\n39), these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most\r\nremarkable manner, as represented. In the Labrador duck the premaxillaries\r\nare rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this breed\r\nthe vertical ridges on each side of the supra-occipital bone are very\r\nprominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in\r\nthe wild duck; and the inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent.\r\nIn a Dutch tufted duck, the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more\r\nglobular and was perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the\r\nlachrymal bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a\r\ndifferent shape and nearly to touch the post. lat. processes of the frontal\r\nbones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As the quadrate\r\nand pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so\r\nmany other bones, I carefully compared them in all the principal breeds;\r\nbut excepting in size they presented no difference.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 40.-CERVICAL VERTEBRA, of natural size. A. Eighth cervical vertebra\r\nof Wild Duck viewed on haemal surface. B. Eighth cervical vertebra of Call\r\nDuck, viewed as above. C. Twelfth cervical vertebra of Wild Duck viewed\r\nlaterally. D. Twelfth cervical vertebra of Aylesbury Duck, viewed\r\nlaterally.)\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE AND RIBS.\r\n\r\nIn one skeleton of the Labrador duck there were the usual fifteen cervical\r\nvertebrae and the usual nine dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; in the other\r\nskeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae with ribs;\r\nnor, as far as could be judged, was this owing merely to a rib having been\r\ndeveloped on the first lumbar vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar\r\nvertebrae agreed perfectly in number, shape, and size with those of the\r\nwild duck. In two skeletons of the Call duck there were fifteen cervical\r\nand nine dorsal vertebrae; in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to\r\nthe so-called fifteenth cervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but\r\nthese ten ribs do not correspond, or arise from the same vertebra, with the\r\nten in the above-mentioned Labrador duck. In the Call duck, which had small\r\nribs attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the haemal spines of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal)\r\nvertebrae corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\neighteenth vertebrae of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebrae had\r\nacquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In the\r\neighth cervical vertebra of this same Call duck (figure 40, B), the two\r\nbranches of the haemal spine stand much closer together than in the wild\r\nduck (A), and the descending haemal processes are much shortened. In the\r\nPenguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely appears (as\r\nascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the cervical and\r\ndorsal vertebrae present no difference; the posterior dorsal vertebrae,\r\nhowever, are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild\r\nduck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae\r\nfurnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar, sacral, and caudal\r\nvertebrae, as far as could be traced, as in the wild duck. The cervical\r\nvertebrae in this same duck (figure 40, D) were much broader and thicker\r\nrelatively to their length than in the wild (C); so much so, that I have\r\nthought it worth while to give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in\r\nthese two birds. From the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth\r\ncervical vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and\r\nwhen this occurs all the adjoining vertebrae are modified. We also see that\r\nan additional dorsal vertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed, the\r\nnumber of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae apparently remaining the same\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\nI examined the bony enlargement of the trachea in the males of the Penguin,\r\nCall, Hook-billed, Labrador, and Aylesbury breeds; and in all it was\r\nidentical in shape.\r\n\r\nThe PELVIS is remarkably uniform; but in the skeleton of the Hook-billed\r\nduck the anterior part is much bowed inwards; in the Aylesbury and some\r\nother breeds the ischiadic foramen is less elongated. In the sternum,\r\nfurculum, coracoids, and scapulae, the differences are so slight and so\r\nvariable as not to be worth notice, except that in two skeletons of the\r\nPenguin duck the terminal portion of the scapula was much attenuated.\r\n\r\nIn the bones of the leg and wing no modification in shape could be\r\nobserved. But in the Penguin and Hook-billed ducks, the terminal phalanges\r\nof the wing are a little shortened. In the former, the femur, and\r\nmetatarsus (but not the tibia) are considerably lengthened, relatively to\r\nthe same bones in the wild duck, and to the wing-bones in both birds. This\r\nelongation of the leg-bones could be seen whilst the bird was alive, and is\r\nno doubt connected with its peculiar upright manner of walking. In a large\r\nAylesbury duck, on the other hand, the tibia was the only bone of the leg\r\nwhich relatively to the other bones was slightly lengthened.\r\n\r\nON THE EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED AND DECREASED USE OF THE LIMBS.\r\n\r\nIn all the breeds the bones of the wing (measured separately after having\r\nbeen cleaned) relatively to those of the leg have become slightly\r\nshortened, in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck, as may be\r\nseen in Table 8.I.\r\n\r\nTABLE 8.I.a.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1.

In the first of these tables we see\r\nthat the leg-bones in each case have increased in actual weight. It might\r\nhave been expected that, with the increased or decreased weight of the\r\nentire skeleton, the leg-bones would have become proportionally heavier or\r\nlighter; but their greater weight in all the breeds relatively to the other\r\nbones can be accounted for only by these domestic birds having used their\r\nlegs in walking and standing much more than the wild, for they never fly,\r\nand the more artificial breeds rarely swim. In the second table we see,\r\nwith the exception of one case, a plain reduction in the weight of the\r\nbones of the wing, and this no doubt has resulted from their lessened use.\r\nThe one exceptional case, namely, in one of the Call ducks, is in truth no\r\nexception, for this bird was constantly in the habit of flying about; and I\r\nhave seen it day after day rise from my grounds, and fly for a long time in\r\ncircles of more than a mile in diameter. In this Call duck there is not\r\nonly no decrease, but an actual increase in the weight of the wing-bones\r\nrelatively to those of the wild-duck; and this probably is consequent on\r\nthe remarkable lightness and thinness of all the bones of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nLastly, I weighed the furculum, coracoids, and scapula of a wild duck and\r\nof a common domestic duck, and I found that their weight, relatively to\r\nthat of the whole skeleton, was as one hundred in the former to eighty-nine\r\nin the latter; this shows that these bones in the domestic duck have been\r\nreduced eleven per cent of their due proportional weight. The prominence of\r\nthe crest of the sternum, relatively to its length, is also much reduced in\r\nall the domestic breeds. These changes have evidently been caused by the\r\nlessened use of the wings.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that several birds, belonging to different Orders, and\r\ninhabiting oceanic islands, have their wings greatly reduced in size and\r\nare incapable of flight. I suggested in my 'Origin of Species' that, as\r\nthese birds are not persecuted by any enemies, the reduction of their wings\r\nhad probably been caused by gradual disuse. Hence, during the earlier\r\nstages of the process of reduction, such birds would probably have\r\nresembled our domesticated ducks in the state of their organs of flight.\r\nThis is the case with the water-hen (Gallinula nesiotis) of Tristan\r\nd'Acunha, which \"can flutter a little, but obviously uses its legs, and not\r\nits wings, as a mode of escape.\" Now Mr. Sclater (8/19. 'Proc. Zoolog.\r\nSoc.' 1861 page 261.) finds in this bird that the wings, sternum, and\r\ncoracoids are all reduced in length, and the crest of the sternum in depth,\r\nin comparison with the same bones in the European water-hen (G. chloropus).\r\nOn the other hand, the thigh-bones and pelvis are increased in length, the\r\nformer by four lines, relatively to the same bones in the common water-hen.\r\nHence in the skeleton of this natural species nearly the same changes have\r\noccurred, only carried a little further, as with our domestic ducks, and in\r\nthis latter case I presume no one will dispute that they have resulted from\r\nthe lessened use of the wings and the increased use of the legs.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis bird deserves some notice, as hardly any other anciently domesticated\r\nbird or quadruped has varied so little. That geese were anciently\r\ndomesticated we know from certain verses in Homer; and from these birds\r\nhaving been kept (388 B.C.) in the Capitol at Rome as sacred to Juno, which\r\nsacredness implies great antiquity. (8/20. 'Ceylon' by Sir J.E. Tennent\r\n1859 volume 1 page 485; also J. Crawfurd on the 'Relation of Domest.\r\nAnimals to Civilisation' read before Brit. Assoc. 1860. See also\r\n'Ornamental Poultry' by Rev. E.S. Dixon 1848 page 132. The goose figured on\r\nthe Egyptian monuments seems to have been the Red goose of Egypt.) That the\r\ngoose has varied in some degree, we may infer from naturalists not being\r\nunanimous with respect to its wild parent-form; though the difficulty is\r\nchiefly due to the existence of three or four closely allied wild European\r\nspecies. (8/21. Macgillivray's 'British Birds' volume 4 page 593.) A large\r\nmajority of capable judges are convinced that our geese are descended from\r\nthe wild Grey-leg goose (Anser ferus); the young of which can easily be\r\ntamed. (8/22. Mr. A. Strickland, 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series\r\nvolume 3 1859 page 122, reared some young wild geese, and found them in\r\nhabits and in all characters identical with the domestic goose.) This\r\nspecies, when crossed with the domestic goose, produced in the Zoological\r\nGardens, as I was assured in 1849, perfectly fertile offspring. (8/23. See\r\nalso Hunter 'Essays' edited by Owen volume 2 page 322.) Yarrell (8/24.\r\nYarrell's 'British Birds' volume 3 page 142.) has observed that the lower\r\npart of the trachea of the domestic goose is sometimes flattened, and that\r\na ring of white feathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak. These\r\ncharacters seem at first sight good indications of a cross at some former\r\nperiod with the white-fronted goose (A. albifrons); but the white ring is\r\nvariable in this latter species, and we must not overlook the law of\r\nanalogous variation; that is, of one species assuming some of the\r\ncharacters of allied species.\r\n\r\nAs the goose has proved so little flexible in its organisation under long-\r\ncontinued domestication, the amount of variation which it has undergone may\r\nbe worth giving. It has increased in size and in productiveness (8/25. L.\r\nLloyd 'Scandinavian Adventures' 1854 volume 2 page 413, says that the wild\r\ngoose lays from five to eight eggs, which is a much fewer number than that\r\nlaid by our domestic goose.); and varies from white to a dusky colour.\r\nSeveral observers (8/26. The Rev. L. Jenyns (Blomefield) seems first to\r\nhave made this observation in his 'British Animals.' See also Yarrell, and\r\nDixon in his 'Ornamental Poultry' (page 139), and 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1857 page 45.) have stated that the gander is more frequently white than\r\nthe goose, and that when old it almost invariably becomes white; but this\r\nis not the case with the parent-form, the A. ferus. Here, again, the law of\r\nanalogous variation may have come into play, as the almost snow-white male\r\nof the Rock goose (Bernicla antarctica) standing on the sea-shore by his\r\ndusky partner is a sight well known to those who have traversed the sounds\r\nof Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. Some geese have top-knots;\r\nand the skull beneath, as before stated, is perforated. A sub-breed has\r\nlately been formed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and\r\nneck. (8/27. Mr. Bartlet exhibited the head and neck of a bird thus\r\ncharacterised before the Zoological Soc. February 1860.) The beak varies a\r\nlittle in size, and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species; but its\r\ncolour and that of the legs are both slightly variable. (8/28. W. Thompson\r\n'Natural Hist. of Ireland' 1851 volume 3 page 31. The Rev. E.S. Dixon gave\r\nme some information on the varying colour of the beak and legs.) This\r\nlatter fact deserves attention, because the colour of the legs and beak is\r\nhighly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild forms.\r\n(8/29. Mr. A. Strickland in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series\r\nvolume 3 1859 page 122.) At our Shows two breeds are exhibited; viz., the\r\nEmbden and Toulouse; but they differ in nothing except colour. (8/30.\r\n'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 1854 page 498; volume 3 page 210.) Recently a\r\nsmaller and singular variety has been imported from Sebastopol (8/31. 'The\r\nCottage Gardener' September 4, 1860 page 348.), with the scapular feathers\r\n(as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, who sent me specimens) greatly elongated,\r\ncurled, and even spirally twisted. The margins of these feathers are\r\nrendered plumose by the divergence of the barbs and barbules, so that they\r\nresemble in some degree those on the back of the black Australian swan.\r\nThese feathers are likewise remarkable from the central shaft, which is\r\nexcessively thin and transparent, being split into fine filaments, which,\r\nafter running for a space free, sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious\r\nfact that these filaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down\r\nor barbules, precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This\r\nstructure of the feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In Gallus\r\nsonneratii the barbs and barbules blend together, and form thin horny\r\nplates of the same nature with the shaft: in this variety of the goose, the\r\nshaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules, and thus resemble true\r\nbarbs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the domestic goose certainly differs somewhat from any known wild\r\nspecies, yet the amount of variation which it has undergone, as compared\r\nwith that of most domesticated animals, is singularly small. This fact can\r\nbe partially accounted for by selection not having come largely into play.\r\nBirds of all kinds which present many distinct races are valued as pets or\r\nornaments; no one makes a pet of the goose; the name, indeed, in more\r\nlanguages than one, is a term of reproach. The goose is valued for its size\r\nand flavour, for the whiteness of its feathers which adds to their value,\r\nand for its prolificness and tameness. In all these points the goose\r\ndiffers from the wild parent-form; and these are the points which have been\r\nselected. Even in ancient times the Roman gourmands valued the liver of the\r\nWHITE goose; and Pierre Belon (8/32. 'L'Hist. de la Nature des Oiseaux' par\r\nP. Belon 1555 page 156. With respect to the livers of white geese being\r\npreferred by the Romans see Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.'\r\ntome 3 page 58.) in 1555 speaks of two varieties, one of which was larger,\r\nmore fecund, and of a better colour than the other; and he expressly states\r\nthat good managers attended to the colour of their goslings, so that they\r\nmight know which to preserve and select for breeding.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\nThis is another bird which has hardly varied under domestication, except in\r\nsometimes being white or piebald. Mr. Waterhouse carefully compared, as he\r\ninforms me, skins of the wild Indian and domestic bird, and they were\r\nidentical in every respect, except that the plumage of the latter was\r\nperhaps rather thicker. Whether our birds are descended from those\r\nintroduced into Europe in the time of Alexander, or have been subsequently\r\nimported, is doubtful. They do not breed very freely with us, and are\r\nseldom kept in large numbers,--circumstances which would greatly interfere\r\nwith the gradual selection and formation of new breeds.\r\n\r\nThere is one strange fact with respect to the peacock, namely, the\r\noccasional appearance in England of the \"japanned\" or \"black-shouldered\"\r\nkind. This form has lately been named on the high authority of Mr. Sclater\r\nas a distinct species, viz. Pavo nigripennis, which he believes will\r\nhereafter be found wild in some country, but not in India, where it is\r\ncertainly unknown. The males of these japanned birds differ conspicuously\r\nfrom the common peacock in the colour of their secondary wing-feathers,\r\nscapulars, wing-coverts, and thighs, and are I think more beautiful; they\r\nare rather smaller than the common sort, and are always beaten by them in\r\ntheir battles, as I hear from the Hon. A.S.G. Canning. The females are much\r\npaler coloured than those of the common kind. Both sexes, as Mr. Canning\r\ninforms me, are white when they leave the egg, and they differ from the\r\nyoung of the white variety only in having a peculiar pinkish tinge on their\r\nwings. These japanned birds, though appearing suddenly in flocks of the\r\ncommon kind, propagate their kind quite truly. Although they do not\r\nresemble the hybrids which have been raised between P. cristatus and\r\nmuticus, nevertheless they are in some respects intermediate in character\r\nbetween these two species; and this fact favours, as Mr. Sclater believes,\r\nthe view that they form a distinct and natural species. (8/33. Mr. Sclater\r\non the black-shouldered peacock of Latham 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' April 24,\r\n1860. Mr. Swinhoe at one time believed, 'Ibis' July 1868, that this kind of\r\npeafowl was found wild in Cochin China, but he has since informed me that\r\nhe feels very doubtful on this head.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sir H. Heron states (8/34. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' April\r\n14, 1835.) that this breed suddenly appeared within his memory in Lord\r\nBrownlow's large stock of pied, white, and common peacocks. The same thing\r\noccurred in Sir J. Trevelyan's flock composed entirely of the common kind,\r\nand in Mr. Thornton's stock of common and pied peacocks. It is remarkable\r\nthat in these two latter instances the black-shouldered kind, though a\r\nsmaller and weaker bird, increased, \"to the extinction of the previously\r\nexisting breed.\" I have also received through Mr. Sclater a statement from\r\nMr. Hudson Gurney that he reared many years ago a pair of black-shouldered\r\npeacocks from the common kind; and another ornithologist, Prof. A. Newton,\r\nstates that, five or six years ago, a female bird, in all respects similar\r\nto the female of the black-shouldered kind, was produced from a stock of\r\ncommon peacocks in his possession, which during more than twenty years had\r\nnot been crossed with birds of any other strain. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me\r\nthat a peacock at Blackheath whilst young was white, but as it became older\r\ngradually assumed the characters of the black-shouldered variety; both its\r\nparents were common peacocks. Lastly, Mr. Canning has given a case of a\r\nfemale of this same variety appearing in Ireland in a flock of the ordinary\r\nkind. (8/35. 'The Field' May 6, 1871. I am much indebted to Mr. Canning for\r\ninformation with respect to his birds.) Here, then, we have seven well\r\nauthenticated cases in Great Britain of japanned birds, having suddenly\r\nappeared within recent times in flocks of the common peafowl. This variety\r\nmust also have formerly appeared in Europe, for Mr. Canning has seen an old\r\npicture, and another is referred to in the 'Field,' with this variety\r\nrepresented. These facts seem to me to indicate that the japanned peacock\r\nis a strongly marked variety or \"sport,\" which tends at all times and in\r\nmany places to reappear. This view is supported by the young being at first\r\nwhite like the young of the white breed, which is undoubtedly a variation.\r\nIf, on the other hand, we believe the japanned peacock to be a distinct\r\nspecies, we must suppose that in all the above cases the common breed had\r\nat some former period been crossed by it, but had lost every trace of the\r\ncross; yet that the offspring of these birds suddenly and completely\r\nreacquired through reversion the characters of P. nigripennis. I have heard\r\nof no other such case in the animal or vegetable kingdom. To perceive the\r\nfull improbability of such an occurrence, we may suppose that a breed of\r\ndogs had been crossed at some former period with a wolf, but had lost every\r\ntrace of the wolf-like character, yet that the breed gave birth in seven\r\ninstances in the same country, within no great length of time, to a wolf\r\nperfect in every character; and we must further suppose that in two of the\r\ncases, the newly produced wolves afterwards spontaneously increased to such\r\nan extent as to lead to the extinction of the parent breed of dogs. So\r\nremarkable a bird as the P. nigripennis, when first imported, would have\r\nrealised a large price; it is therefore improbable that it should have been\r\nsilently introduced and its history subsequently lost. On the whole the\r\nevidence seems to me, as it did to Sir R. Heron, to be decisive in favour\r\nof the japanned or black-shouldered breed being a variation, induced by\r\nsome unknown cause. On this view, the case is the most remarkable one ever\r\nrecorded of the abrupt appearance of a new form, which so closely resembles\r\na true species that it has deceived one of the most experienced of living\r\nornithologists.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY.\r\n\r\nIt seems fairly well established by Mr. Gould (8/36. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.'\r\nApril 8, 1856 page 61. Prof. Baird believes (as quoted in Tegetmeier\r\n'Poultry Book' 1866 page 269) that our turkeys are descended from a West\r\nIndian species now extinct. But besides the improbability of a bird having\r\nlong ago become extinct in these large and luxuriant islands, it appears\r\n(as we shall presently see) that the turkey degenerates in India, and this\r\nfact indicates that it was not aboriginally an inhabitant of the lowlands\r\nof the tropics.), that the turkey, in accordance with the history of its\r\nfirst introduction, is descended from a wild Mexican form, which had been\r\ndomesticated by the natives before the discovery of America, and which is\r\nnow generally ranked as a local race, and not as a distinct species.\r\nHowever this may be, the case deserves notice because in the United States\r\nwild male turkeys sometimes court the domestic hens, which are descended\r\nfrom the Mexican form, \"and are generally received by them with great\r\npleasure.\" (8/37. Audubon 'Ornithological Biography' volume 1 1831 pages 4-\r\n13; and 'Naturalist's Library' volume 14 'Birds' page 138.) Several\r\naccounts have likewise been published of young birds, reared in the United\r\nStates from the eggs of the wild species, crossing and commingling with the\r\ncommon breed. In England, also, this same species has been kept in several\r\nparks; from two of which the Rev. W.D. Fox procured birds, and they crossed\r\nfreely with the common domestic kind, and during many years afterwards, as\r\nhe informs me, the turkeys in his neighbourhood clearly showed traces of\r\ntheir crossed parentage. We here have an instance of a domestic race being\r\nmodified by a cross with a distinct wild race or species. F. Michaux (8/38.\r\nF. Michaux 'Travels in N. America' 1802 English translation page 217.)\r\nsuspected in 1802 that the common domestic turkey was not descended from\r\nthe United States species alone, but likewise from a southern form, and he\r\nwent so far as to believe that English and French turkeys differed from\r\nhaving different proportions of the blood of the two parent-forms.\r\n\r\nEnglish turkeys are smaller than either wild form. They have not varied in\r\nany great degree; but there are some breeds which can be distinguished as\r\nNorfolks, Suffolks, Whites, and Copper-coloured (or Cambridge), all of\r\nwhich, if precluded from crossing with other breeds propagate their kind\r\ntruly. Of these kinds, the most distinct is the small, hardy, dull-black\r\nNorfolk turkey, of which the chickens are black, occasionally with white\r\npatches about the head. The other breeds scarcely differ except in colour,\r\nand their chickens are generally mottled all over with brownish-grey.\r\n(8/39. 'Ornamental Poetry' by the Rev. E.S. Dixon 1848 page 34.) The\r\ninferior tail-coverts vary in number, and according to a German\r\nsuperstition the hen lays as many eggs as the cock has feathers of this\r\nkind. (8/40. Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' b. 3 1793 s. 309.) Albin\r\nin 1738, and Temminck within a much later period, describe a beautiful\r\nbreed, dusky-yellowish, brown above and white beneath, with a large top-\r\nknot of soft plumose feather. The spurs of the male were rudimentary. This\r\nbreed has been for a long time extinct in Europe; but a living specimen has\r\nlately been imported from the east coast of Africa, which still retains the\r\ntop-knot and the same general colouring and rudimentary spurs. (8/41. Mr.\r\nBartlett in 'Land and Water' October 31, 1868 page 233; and Mr. Tegetmeier\r\nin the 'Field' July 17, 1869 page 46.) Mr. Wilmot has described (8/42.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 699.) a white turkey-cock having a crest\r\nformed of \"feathers about four inches long, with bare quills, and a tuft of\r\nsoft white down growing at the end.\" Many of the young birds inherited this\r\nkind of crest, but afterwards it fell off or was pecked out by the other\r\nbirds. This is an interesting case, as with care a new breed might probably\r\nhave been formed; and a top-knot of this nature would have been to a\r\ncertain extent analogous to that borne by the males in several allied\r\ngenera, such as Euplocomus, Lophophorus, and Pavo.\r\n\r\nWild turkeys, believed in every instance to have been imported from the\r\nUnited States, have been kept in the parks of Lords Powis, Leicester, Hill,\r\nand Derby. The Rev. W.D. Fox procured birds from the two first-named parks,\r\nand he informs me that they certainly differed a little from each other in\r\nthe shape of their bodies and in the barred plumage on their wings. These\r\nbirds likewise differed from Lord Hill's stock. Some of the latter kept at\r\nOulton by Sir P. Egerton, though precluded from crossing with common\r\nturkeys, occasionally produced much paler-coloured birds, and one that was\r\nalmost white, but not an albino. These half-wild turkeys, in thus differing\r\nslightly from each other, present an analogous case with the wild cattle\r\nkept in the several British parks. We must suppose that such differences\r\nhave resulted from the prevention of free intercrossing between birds\r\nranging over a wide area, and from the changed conditions to which they\r\nhave been exposed in England. In India the climate has apparently wrought a\r\nstill greater change in the turkey, for it is described by Mr. Blyth (8/43.\r\nE. Blyth 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 1847 volume 20 page 391.) as being\r\nmuch degenerated in size, \"utterly incapable of rising on the wing,\" of a\r\nblack colour, and \"with the long pendulous appendages over the beak\r\nenormously developed.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA FOWL.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated Guinea fowl is now believed by some naturalists to be\r\ndescended from the Numida ptilorhynca, which inhabits very hot, and, in\r\nparts, extremely arid districts in Eastern Africa; consequently it has been\r\nexposed in this country to extremely different conditions of life.\r\nNevertheless it has hardly varied at all, except in the plumage being\r\neither paler or darker-coloured. It is a singular fact that this bird\r\nvaries more in colour in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main, under a\r\nhot though humid climate, than in Europe. (8/44. Roulin makes this remark\r\nin 'Mem. de divers Savans, 1'Acad. des Sciences' tome 6 1835 page 349. Mr.\r\nHill of Spanish Town in a letter to me describes five varieties of the\r\nGuinea fowl in Jamaica. I have seen singular pale-coloured varieties\r\nimported from Barbadoes and Demerara.) The Guinea fowl has become\r\nthoroughly feral in Jamaica and in St. Domingo (8/45. For St. Domingo see\r\nM. A. Salle, in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1857 page 236. Mr. Hill remarks to me,\r\nin his letter, on the colour of the legs of the feral birds in Jamaica.),\r\nand has diminished in size; the legs are black, whereas the legs of the\r\naboriginal African bird are said to be grey. This small change is worth\r\nnotice on account of the often-repeated statement that all feral animals\r\ninvariably revert in every character to their original type.\r\n\r\nTHE CANARY BIRD.\r\n\r\nAs this bird has been recently domesticated, namely, within the last 350\r\nyears, its variability deserves notice. It has been crossed with nine or\r\nten other species of Fringillidae, and some of the hybrids are almost\r\ncompletely fertile; but we have no evidence that any distinct breed has\r\noriginated from such crosses. Notwithstanding the modern domestication of\r\nthe canary, many varieties have been produced; even before the year 1718 a\r\nlist of twenty-seven varieties was published in France (8/46. Mr. B.P.\r\nBrent 'The Canary, British Finches' etc. pages 21, 30.), and in 1779 a long\r\nschedule of the desired qualities was printed by the London Canary Society,\r\nso that methodical selection has been practised during a considerable\r\nperiod. The greater number of the varieties differ only in colour and in\r\nthe markings of their plumage. Some breeds however, differ in shape, such\r\nas the hooped or bowed canaries, and the Belgian canaries with their much\r\nelongated bodies. Mr. Brent (8/47. 'Cottage Gardener' December 11, 1855\r\npage 184: an account is here given of all the varieties. For many\r\nmeasurements of the wild birds, see Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt ibid December\r\n25, 1855 page 223.) measured one of the latter and found it eight inches in\r\nlength, whilst the wild canary is only five and a quarter inches long.\r\nThere are top-knotted canaries, and it is a singular fact that, if two top-\r\nknotted birds are matched, the young, instead of having very fine top-\r\nknots, are generally bald, or even have a wound on their heads. (8/48.\r\nBechstein 'Naturgesch. der Stubenvogel' 1840 s. 243; see s. 252 on the\r\ninherited song of Canary-birds. With respect to their baldness see also W.\r\nKidd 'Treatise on Song-Birds.') It would appear as if the top-knot were due\r\nto some morbid condition, which is increased to an injurious degree when\r\ntwo birds in this state are paired. There is a feather-footed breed, and\r\nanother with a kind of frill running down the breast. One other character\r\ndeserves notice from being confined to one period of life, and from being\r\nstrictly inherited at the same period; namely, the wing and tail feathers\r\nin prize canaries being black, \"but this colour is retained only until the\r\nfirst moult; once moulted, the peculiarity ceases.\" (8/49. W. Kidd\r\n'Treatise on Song-Birds' page 18.) Canaries differ much in disposition and\r\ncharacter, and in some small degree in song. They produce eggs three or\r\nfour times during the year.\r\n\r\nGOLD-FISH.\r\n\r\nBesides mammals and birds, only a few animals belonging to the other great\r\nclasses have been domesticated; but to show that it is an almost universal\r\nlaw that animals, when removed from their natural conditions of life, vary,\r\nand that races can be formed when selection is applied, it is necessary to\r\nsay a few words on gold-fish, bees, and silk-moths.\r\n\r\nGold-fish (Cyprinus auratus) were introduced into Europe only two or three\r\ncenturies ago; but they have been kept in confinement from an ancient\r\nperiod in China. Mr. Blyth (8/50. The 'Indian Field' 1858 page 255.)\r\nsuspects, from the analogous variation of other fishes, that golden-\r\ncoloured fish do not occur in a state of nature. These fishes frequently\r\nlive under the most unnatural conditions, and their variability in colour,\r\nsize, and in some important points of structure is very great. M. Sauvigny\r\nhas described and given coloured drawings of no less than eighty-nine\r\nvarieties. (8/51. Yarrell 'British Fishes' volume 1 page 319.) Many of the\r\nvarieties, however, such as triple tail-fins, etc., ought to be called\r\nmonstrosities; but it is difficult to draw any distinct line between a\r\nvariation and a monstrosity. As gold-fish are kept for ornament or\r\ncuriosity, and as \"the Chinese are just the people to have secluded a\r\nchance variety of any kind, and to have matched and paired from it\" (8/52.\r\nMr. Blyth in the 'Indian Field' 1858 page 255.), it might have been\r\npredicted that selection would have been largely practised in the formation\r\nof new breeds; and this is the case. In an old Chinese work it is said that\r\nfish with vermilion scales were first raised in confinement during the Sung\r\ndynasty (which commenced A.D. 960), \"and now they are cultivated in\r\nfamilies everywhere for the sake of ornament.\" In another and more ancient\r\nwork, it is said that \"there is not a household where the gold-fish is not\r\ncultivated, in RIVALRY as to its colour, and as a source of profit,\" etc.\r\n(8/53. W.F. Mayers 'Chinese Notes and Queries' August 1868 page 123.)\r\nAlthough many breeds exist, it is a singular fact that the variations are\r\noften not inherited. Sir R. Heron (8/54. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' May 25,\r\n1842.) kept many of these fishes, and placed all the deformed ones, namely,\r\nthose destitute of dorsal fins and those furnished with a double anal fin,\r\nor triple tail, in a pond by themselves; but they did \"not produce a\r\ngreater proportion of deformed offspring than the perfect fishes.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over an almost infinite diversity of colour, we meet with the most\r\nextraordinary modifications of structure. Thus, out of about two dozen\r\nspecimens bought in London, Mr. Yarrell observed some with the dorsal fin\r\nextending along more than half the length of the back: others with this fin\r\nreduced to only five or six rays: and one with no dorsal fin. The anal fins\r\nare sometimes double, and the tail is often triple. This latter deviation\r\nof structure seems generally to occur \"at the expense of the whole or part\r\nof some other fin (8/55. Yarrell 'British Fishes' volume 1 page 319.); but\r\nBory de Saint-Vincent (8/56. 'Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 5 page 276.)\r\nsaw at Madrid gold-fish furnished with a dorsal fin and a triple tail. One\r\nvariety is characterised by a hump on its back near the head; and the Rev.\r\nL. Jenyns (Blomefield) (8/57. 'Observations in Nat. Hist.' 1846 page 211.\r\nDr. Gray has described in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 1860 page 151 a\r\nnearly similar variety but destitute of a dorsal fin.) has described a most\r\nsingular variety, imported from China, almost globular in form like a\r\nDiodon, with \"the fleshy part of the tail as if entirely cut away? the\r\ncaudal fin being set on a little behind the dorsal and immediately above\r\nthe anal.\" In this fish the anal and caudal fins were double; the anal fin\r\nbeing attached to the body in a vertical line: the eyes also were\r\nenormously large and protuberant.\r\n\r\nHIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\nBees have been domesticated from an ancient period; if indeed their state\r\ncan be considered one of domestication, for they search for their own food,\r\nwith the exception of a little generally given to them during the winter.\r\nTheir habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree. Bees, however, have\r\nbeen transported into almost every quarter of the world, so that climate\r\nought to have produced whatever direct effect it is capable of producing.\r\nIt is frequently asserted that the bees in different parts of Great Britain\r\ndiffer in size, colour, and temper; and Godron (8/58. 'De l'Espece' 1859\r\npage 459. With respect to the bees of Burgundy see M. Gerard, art. 'Espece'\r\nin 'Dict. Univers. d'Hist. Nat.') says that they are generally larger in\r\nthe south than in other parts of France; it has also been asserted that the\r\nlittle brown bees of High Burgundy, when transported to La Bresse become\r\nlarge and yellow in the second generation. But these statements require\r\nconfirmation. As far as size is concerned, it is known that bees produced\r\nin very old combs are smaller, owing to the cells having become smaller\r\nfrom the successive old cocoons. The best authorities (8/59. See a\r\ndiscussion on this subject, in answer to a question of mine, in 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' 1862 pages 225-242; also Mr. Bevan Fox in ditto 1862 page\r\n284) concur that, with the exception of the Ligurian race or species,\r\npresently to be mentioned, distinct breeds do not exist in Britain or on\r\nthe Continent. There is, however, even in the same stock, some variability\r\nin colour. Thus, Mr. Woodbury states (8/60. This excellent observer may be\r\nimplicitly trusted; see 'Journal of Horticulture' July 14, 1863 page 39.)\r\nthat he has several times seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with\r\nyellow-like Ligurian queens, and the latter dark-coloured like common bees.\r\nHe has also observed variations in the colour of the drones, without any\r\ncorresponding difference in the queens or workers of the same hive. The\r\ngreat apiarian, Dzierzon, in answer to my queries on this subject, says\r\n(8/61. 'Journal of Horticulture' September 9, 1862 page 463; see also Herr\r\nKleine on same subject November 11 page 643, who sums up, that, though\r\nthere is some variability in colour, no constant or perceptible differences\r\ncan be detected in the bees of Germany.), that in Germany bees of some\r\nstocks are decidedly dark, whilst others are remarkable for their yellow\r\ncolour. Bees also seem to differ in habits in different districts, for\r\nDzierzon adds, \"If many stocks with their offspring are more inclined to\r\nswarm, whilst others are richer in honey, so that some bee-keepers even\r\ndistinguish between swarming and honey-gathering bees, this is a habit\r\nwhich has become second nature, caused by the customary mode of keeping the\r\nbees and the pasturage of the district. For example, what a difference in\r\nthis respect one may perceive to exist between the bees of the Luneburg\r\nheath and those of this country!\"...\"Removing an old queen and substituting\r\na young one of the current year is here an infallible mode of keeping the\r\nstrongest stock from swarming and preventing drone-breeding; whilst the\r\nsame means if adopted in Hanover would certainly be of no avail.\" I\r\nprocured a hive full of dead bees from Jamaica, where they have long been\r\nnaturalised, and, on carefully comparing them under the microscope with my\r\nown bees, I could detect not a trace of difference.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable uniformity in the hive-bee, wherever kept, may probably be\r\naccounted for by the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of bringing\r\nselection into play by pairing particular queens and drones, for these\r\ninsects unite only during flight. Nor is there any record, with a single\r\npartial exception, of any person having separated and bred from a hive in\r\nwhich the workers presented some appreciable difference. In order to form a\r\nnew breed, seclusion from other bees would, as we now know, be\r\nindispensable; for since the introduction of the Ligurian bee into Germany\r\nand England, it has been found that the drones wander at least two miles\r\nfrom their own hives, and often cross with the queens of the common bee.\r\n(8/62. Mr. Woodbury has published several such accounts in 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' 1861 and 1862.) The Ligurian bee, although perfectly fertile\r\nwhen crossed with the common kind, is ranked by most naturalists as a\r\ndistinct species, whilst by others it is ranked as a variety: but this form\r\nneed not here be noticed, as there is no reason to believe that it is the\r\nproduct of domestication. The Egyptian and some other bees are likewise\r\nranked by Dr. Gerstacker (8/63. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series\r\nvolume 11 page 339.) but not by other highly competent judges, as\r\ngeographical races; he grounds his conclusion in chief part on the fact\r\nthat in certain districts, as in the Crimea and Rhodes, they vary so much\r\nin colour, that the several geographical races can be closely connected by\r\nintermediate forms.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to a single instance of the separation and preservation of a\r\nparticular stock of bees. Mr. Lowe (8/64. 'The Cottage Gardener' May 1860\r\npage 110; and ditto in 'Journal of Hort.' 1862 page 242.) procured some\r\nbees from a cottager a few miles from Edinburgh, and perceived that they\r\ndiffered from the common bee in the hairs on the head and thorax being\r\nlighter coloured and more profuse in quantity. From the date of the\r\nintroduction of the Ligurian bee into Great Britain we may feel sure that\r\nthese bees had not been crossed with this form. Mr. Lowe propagated this\r\nvariety, but unfortunately did not separate the stock from his other bees,\r\nand after three generations the new character was almost completely lost.\r\nNevertheless, as he adds, \"a great number of the bees still retain traces,\r\nthough faint, of the original colony.\" This case shows us what could\r\nprobably be effected by careful and long-continued selection applied\r\nexclusively to the workers, for, as we have seen, queens and drones cannot\r\nbe selected and paired.\r\n\r\nSILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\nThese insects are in several respects interesting to us, more especially\r\nbecause they have varied largely at an early period of life, and the\r\nvariations have been inherited at corresponding periods. As the value of\r\nthe silk-moth depends entirely on the cocoon, every change in its structure\r\nand qualities has been carefully attended to, and races differing much in\r\nthe cocoon, but hardly at all in the adult state, have been produced. With\r\nthe races of most other domestic animals, the young resemble each other\r\nclosely, whilst the adults differ much.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless, even if it were possible, to describe all the many\r\nkinds of silkworms. Several distinct species exist in India and China which\r\nproduce useful silk, and some of these are capable of freely crossing with\r\nthe common silk-moth, as has been recently ascertained in France. Captain\r\nHutton (8/65. 'Transact. Entomolog. Soc.' 3rd series volume 3 pages 143-173\r\nand pages 295-331.) states that throughout the world at least six species\r\nhave been domesticated; and he believes that the silk-moths reared in\r\nEurope belong to two or three species. This, however, is not the opinion of\r\nseveral capable judges who have particularly attended to the cultivation of\r\nthis insect in France; and hardly accords with some facts presently to be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe common silk-moth (Bombyx mori) was brought to Constantinople in the\r\nsixth century, whence it was carried into Italy, and in 1494 into France.\r\n(8/66. Godron 'De l'Espece' 1859 tome 1 page 460. The antiquity of the\r\nsilkworm in China is given on the authority of Stanislas Julien.)\r\nEverything has been favourable for the variation of this insect. It is\r\nbelieved to have been domesticated in China as long ago as 2700 B.C. It has\r\nbeen kept under unnatural and diversified conditions of life, and has been\r\ntransported into many countries. There is reason to believe that the nature\r\nof the food given to the caterpillar influences to a certain extent the\r\ncharacter of the breed. (8/67. See the remarks of Prof. Westwood, Gen.\r\nHearsey and others at the meeting of the Entomolog. Soc. of London July\r\n1861.) Disuse has apparently aided in checking the development of the\r\nwings. But the most important element in the production of the many now\r\nexisting, much modified races, no doubt has been the close attention which\r\nhas long been applied in many countries to every promising variation. The\r\ncare taken in Europe in the selection of the best cocoons and moths for\r\nbreeding is notorious (8/68. See for instance M. A. de Quatrefages 'Etudes\r\nsur les Maladies actuelles du Ver a Soie' 1859 page 101.), and the\r\nproduction of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of France. I\r\nhave made inquiries through Dr. Falconer, and am assured that in India the\r\nnatives are equally careful in the process of selection. In China the\r\nproduction of eggs is confined to certain favourable districts, and the\r\nraisers are precluded by law from producing silk, so that their whole\r\nattention may be necessarily given up to this one object. (8/69. My\r\nauthorities for the statements will be given in the chapter on Selection.)\r\n\r\n[The following details on the differences between the several breeds are\r\ntaken, when not stated to the contrary, from M. Robinet's excellent work\r\n(8/70. 'Manuel de l'Educateur de Vers a Soie' 1848.), which bears every\r\nsign of care and large experience. The EGGS in the different races vary in\r\ncolour, in shape (being round, elliptic or oval), and in size. The eggs\r\nlaid in June in the south of France, and in July in the central provinces,\r\ndo not hatch until the following spring; and it is in vain, says M.\r\nRobinet, to expose them to a temperature gradually raised, in order that\r\nthe caterpillar may be quickly developed. Yet occasionally, without any\r\nknown cause, batches of eggs are produced, which immediately begin to\r\nundergo the proper changes, and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days.\r\nFrom these and some other analogous facts it may be concluded that the\r\nTrevoltini silkworms of Italy, of which the caterpillars are hatched in\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty days, do not necessarily form, as has been\r\nmaintained, a distinct species. Although the breeds which live in temperate\r\ncountries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by artificial\r\nheat, yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot country they\r\ngradually acquire the character of quick development, as in the Trevoltini\r\nraces. (8/71. Robinet ibid pages 12, 318. I may add that the eggs of N.\r\nAmerican silkworms taken to the Sandwich Islands produced moths at very\r\nirregular periods; and the moths thus raised yielded eggs which were even\r\nworse in this respect. Some were hatched in ten days, and others not until\r\nafter the lapse of many months. No doubt a regular early character would\r\nultimately have been acquired. See review in 'Athenaeum' 1844 page 329 of\r\nJ. Jarves 'Scenes in the Sandwich Islands.')\r\n\r\nCATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\nThese vary greatly in size and colour. The skin is generally white,\r\nsometimes mottled with black or grey, and occasionally quite black. The\r\ncolour, however, as M. Robinet asserts, is not constant, even in perfectly\r\npure breeds; except in the race tigree, so called from being marked with\r\ntransverse black stripes. As the general colour of the caterpillar is not\r\ncorrelated with that of the silk (8/72. 'The Art of rearing Silkworms'\r\ntranslated from Count Dandolo 1825 page 23.), this character is disregarded\r\nby cultivators, and has not been fixed by selection. Captain Hutton, in the\r\npaper before referred to, has argued with much force that the dark tiger-\r\nlike marks, which so frequently appear during the later moults in the\r\ncaterpillars of various breeds, are due to reversion; for the caterpillars\r\nof several allied wild species of Bombyx are marked and coloured in this\r\nmanner. He separated some caterpillars with the tiger-like marks, and in\r\nthe succeeding spring (pages 149, 298) nearly all the caterpillars reared\r\nfrom them were dark-brindled, and the tints became still darker in the\r\nthird generation. The moths reared from these caterpillars (8/73.\r\n'Transact. Ent. Soc.' ut supra pages 153, 308.) also became darker, and\r\nresembled in colouring the wild B. huttoni. On this view of the tiger-like\r\nmarks being due to reversion, the persistency with which they are\r\ntransmitted is intelligible.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Mrs. Whitby took great pains in breeding silkworms on a\r\nlarge scale, and she informed me that some of her caterpillars had dark\r\neyebrows. This is probably the first step in reversion towards the tiger-\r\nlike marks, and I was curious to know whether so trifling a character would\r\nbe inherited. At my request she separated in 1848 twenty of these\r\ncaterpillars, and having kept the moths separate, bred from them. Of the\r\nmany caterpillars thus reared, \"every one without exception had eyebrows,\r\nsome darker and more decidedly marked than the others, but ALL had eyebrows\r\nmore or less plainly visible.\" Black caterpillars occasionally appear\r\namongst those of the common kind, but in so variable a manner, that,\r\naccording to M. Robinet, the same race will one year exclusively produce\r\nwhite caterpillars, and the next year many black ones; nevertheless, I have\r\nbeen informed by M. A. Bossi of Geneva, that, if these black caterpillars\r\nare separately bred from, they reproduce the same colour; but the cocoons\r\nand moths reared from them do not present any difference.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar in Europe ordinarily moults four times before passing into\r\nthe cocoon stage; but there are races \"a trois mues,\" and the Trevoltini\r\nrace likewise moults only thrice. It might have been thought that so\r\nimportant a physiological difference would not have arisen under\r\ndomestication; but M. Robinet (8/74. Robinet ibid page 317.) states that,\r\non the one hand, ordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons\r\nafter only three moults, and, on the other hand, \"presque toutes les races\r\na trois mues, que nous avons experimentees, ont fait quatre mues a la\r\nseconde ou a la troisieme annee, ce qui semble prouver qu'il a suffi de les\r\nplacer dans des conditions favorables pour leur rendre une faculte qu'elles\r\navaient perdue sous des influences moins favorables.\"\r\n\r\nCOCOONS.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar in changing into the cocoon loses about 50 per cent of its\r\nweight; but the amount of loss differs in different breeds, and this is of\r\nimportance to the cultivator. The cocoon in the different races presents\r\ncharacteristic differences; being large or small;--nearly spherical with no\r\nconstriction, as in the Race de Loriol, or cylindrical, with either a deep\r\nor slight constriction in the middle; with the two ends, or with one end\r\nalone, more or less pointed. The silk varies in fineness and quality, and\r\nin being nearly white, but of two tints, or yellow. Generally the colour of\r\nthe silk is not strictly inherited: but in the chapter on Selection I shall\r\ngive a curious account how, in the course of sixty-five generations, the\r\nnumber of yellow cocoons in one breed has been reduced in France from one\r\nhundred to thirty-five in the thousand. According to Robinet, the white\r\nrace, called Sina, by careful selection during the last seventy-five years,\r\n\"est arrivee a un tel etat de purete, qu'on ne voit pas un seul cocon jaune\r\ndans des millions de cocons blancs.\" (8/75. Robinet ibid pages 306-317.)\r\nCocoons are sometimes formed, as is well known, entirely destitute of silk,\r\nwhich yet produce moths; unfortunately Mrs. Whitby was prevented by an\r\naccident from ascertaining whether this character would prove hereditary.\r\n\r\nADULT STAGE.\r\n\r\nI can find no account of any constant difference in the moths of the most\r\ndistinct races. Mrs. Whitby assured me that there was none in the several\r\nkinds bred by her; and I have received a similar statement from the eminent\r\nnaturalist, M. de Quatrefages. Captain Hutton also says (8/76. 'Transact.\r\nEnt. Soc.' ut supra page 317.) that the moths of all kinds vary much in\r\ncolour, but in nearly the same inconstant manner. Considering how much the\r\ncocoons in the several races differ, this fact is of interest, and may\r\nprobably be accounted for on the same principle as the fluctuating\r\nvariability of colour in the caterpillar, namely, that there has been no\r\nmotive for selecting and perpetuating any particular variation.\r\n\r\nThe males of the wild Bombycidae \"fly swiftly in the day-time and evening,\r\nbut the females are usually very sluggish and inactive.\" (8/77. Stephen's\r\nIllustrations, 'Haustellata' volume 2 page 35. See also Capt. Hutton\r\n'Transact. Ent. Soc.' ibid page 152.) In several moths of this family the\r\nfemales have abortive wings, but no instance is known of the males being\r\nincapable of flight, for in this case the species could hardly have been\r\nperpetuated. In the silk-moth both sexes have imperfect, crumpled wings,\r\nand are incapable of flight; but still there is a trace of the\r\ncharacteristic difference in the two sexes; for though, on comparing a\r\nnumber of males and females, I could detect no difference in the\r\ndevelopment of their wings, yet I was assured by Mrs. Whitby that the males\r\nof the moths bred by her used their wings more than the females, and could\r\nflutter downwards, though never upwards. She also states that, when the\r\nfemales first emerge from the cocoon, their wings are less expanded than\r\nthose of the male. The degree of imperfection, however, in the wings varies\r\nmuch in different races and under different circumstances. M. Quatrefages\r\n(8/78. 'Etudes sur les Maladies du Ver a Soie' 1859 pages 304, 209.) says\r\nthat he has seen a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third,\r\nfourth, or tenth part of their normal dimensions, and even to mere short\r\nstraight stumps: \"il me semble qu'il y a la un veritable arret de\r\ndeveloppement partiel.\" On the other hand, he describes the female moths of\r\nthe Andre Jean breed as having \"leurs ailes larges et etalees. Un seul\r\npresente quelques courbures irregulieres et des plis anormaux.\" As moths\r\nand butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars under\r\nconfinement often have crippled wings, the same cause, whatever it may be,\r\nhas probably acted on silk-moths, but the disuse of their wings during so\r\nmany generations has, it may be suspected, likewise come into play.\r\n\r\nThe moths of many breeds fail to glue their eggs to the surface on which\r\nthey are laid (8/79. Quatrefages 'Etudes' etc. page 214.) but this\r\nproceeds, according to Capt. Hutton (8/80. 'Transact. Ent. Soc.' ut supra\r\npage 151.), merely from the glands of the ovipositor being weakened.\r\n\r\nAs with other long-domesticated animals, the instincts of the silk-moth\r\nhave suffered. The caterpillars, when placed on a mulberry-tree, often\r\ncommit the strange mistake of devouring the base of the leaf on which they\r\nare feeding, and consequently fall down; but they are capable, according to\r\nM. Robinet (8/81. 'Manuel de l'Educateur' etc. page 26.) of again crawling\r\nup the trunk. Even this capacity sometimes fails, for M. Martins (8/82.\r\nGodron 'De l'Espece' page 462.) placed some caterpillars on a tree, and\r\nthose which fell were not able to remount and perished of hunger; they were\r\neven incapable of passing from leaf to leaf.\r\n\r\nSome of the modifications which the silk-moth has undergone stand in\r\ncorrelation with one another. Thus, the eggs of the moths which produce\r\nwhite cocoons and of those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly in\r\ntint. The abdominal feet, also, of the caterpillars which yield white\r\ncocoons are always white, whilst those which give yellow cocoons are\r\ninvariably yellow. (8/83. Quatrefages 'Etudes' etc. pages 12, 209, 214.) We\r\nhave seen that the caterpillars with dark tiger-like stripes produce moths\r\nwhich are more darkly shaded than other moths. It seems well established\r\n(8/84. Robinet 'Manuel' etc. page 303.) that in France the caterpillars of\r\nthe races which produce white silk, and certain black caterpillars, have\r\nresisted, better than other races, the disease which has recently\r\ndevastated the silk-districts. Lastly, the races differ constitutionally,\r\nfor some do not succeed so well under a temperate climate as others; and a\r\ndamp soil does not equally injure all the races. (8/85. Robinet ibid page\r\n15.)]\r\n\r\nFrom these various facts we learn that silk-moths, like the higher animals,\r\nvary greatly under long-continued domestication. We learn also the more\r\nimportant fact that variations may occur at various periods of life, and be\r\ninherited at a corresponding period. And finally we see that insects are\r\namenable to the great principle of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IX.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED PLANTS: CEREAL AND CULINARY PLANTS.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE NUMBER AND PARENTAGE OF CULTIVATED PLANTS.\r\nFIRST STEPS IN CULTIVATION.\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF CULTIVATED PLANTS.\r\n\r\nCEREALIA.\r\nDOUBTS ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\nWHEAT: VARIETIES OF.\r\nINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\nCHANGED HABITS.\r\nSELECTION.\r\nANCIENT HISTORY OF THE VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nMAIZE: GREAT VARIATION OF.\r\nDIRECT ACTION OF CLIMATE ON.\r\n\r\nCULINARY PLANTS.\r\n\r\nCABBAGES: VARIETIES OF, IN FOLIAGE AND STEMS, BUT NOT IN OTHER PARTS.\r\nPARENTAGE OF.\r\nOTHER SPECIES OF BRASSICA.\r\n\r\nPEAS: AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERAL KINDS, CHIEFLY IN THE PODS AND\r\nSEED.\r\nSOME VARIETIES CONSTANT, SOME HIGHLY VARIABLE.\r\nDO NOT INTERCROSS.\r\n\r\nBEANS.\r\n\r\nPOTATOES: NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF.\r\nDIFFERING LITTLE EXCEPT IN THE TUBERS.\r\nCHARACTERS INHERITED.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into so much detail on the variability of cultivated\r\nplants, as in the case of domesticated animals. The subject is involved in\r\nmuch difficulty. Botanists have generally neglected cultivated varieties,\r\nas beneath their notice. In several cases the wild prototype is unknown or\r\ndoubtfully known; and in other cases it is hardly possible to distinguish\r\nbetween escaped seedlings and truly wild plants, so that there is no safe\r\nstandard of comparison by which to judge of any supposed amount of change.\r\nNot a few botanists believe that several of our anciently cultivated plants\r\nhave become so profoundly modified that it is not possible now to recognise\r\ntheir aboriginal parent-forms. Equally perplexing are the doubts whether\r\nsome of them are descended from one species, or from several inextricably\r\ncommingled by crossing and variation. Variations often pass into, and\r\ncannot be distinguished from, monstrosities; and monstrosities are of\r\nlittle significance for our purpose. Many varieties are propagated solely\r\nby grafts, buds, layers, bulbs, etc., and frequently it is not known how\r\nfar their peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal generation.\r\nNevertheless, some facts of value can be gleaned: and other facts will\r\nhereafter be incidentally given. One chief object in the two following\r\nchapters is to show how many characters in our cultivated plants have\r\nbecome variable.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on details a few general remarks on the origin of\r\ncultivated plants may be introduced. M. Alph. De Candolle (9/1. 'Geographie\r\nbotanique raisonnee' 1855 pages 810 to 991.) in an admirable discussion on\r\nthis subject, in which he displays a wonderful amount of knowledge, gives a\r\nlist of 157 of the most useful cultivated plants. Of these he believes that\r\n85 are almost certainly known in their wild state; but on this head other\r\ncompetent judges (9/2. Review by Mr. Bentham in 'Hort. Journal' volume 9\r\n1855 page 133 entitled 'Historical Notes on cultivated Plants' by Dr. A.\r\nTargioni-Tozzetti. See also 'Edinburgh Review' 1866 page 510.) entertain\r\ngreat doubts. Of 40 of them, the origin is admitted by M. De Candolle to be\r\ndoubtful, either from a certain amount of dissimilarity which they present\r\nwhen compared with their nearest allies in a wild state, or from the\r\nprobability of the latter not being truly wild plants, but seedlings\r\nescaped from culture. Of the entire 157, 32 alone are ranked by M. De\r\nCandolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal condition. But it should be\r\nobserved that he does not include in his list several plants which present\r\nill-defined characters, namely, the various forms of pumpkins, millet,\r\nsorghum, kidney-bean, dolichos, capsicum, and indigo. Nor does he include\r\nflowers; and several of the more anciently cultivated flowers, such as\r\ncertain roses, the common Imperial lily, the tuberose, and even the lilac,\r\nare said (9/3. 'Hist. Notes' as above by Targioni-Tozzetti.) not to be\r\nknown in the wild state.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative numbers above given, and from other arguments of much\r\nweight, M. De Candolle concludes that plants have rarely been so much\r\nmodified by culture that they cannot be identified with their wild\r\nprototypes. But on this view, considering that savages probably would not\r\nhave chosen rare plants for cultivation, that useful plants are generally\r\nconspicuous, and that they could not have been the inhabitants of deserts\r\nor of remote and recently discovered islands, it appears strange to me that\r\nso many of our cultivated plants should be still unknown or only doubtfully\r\nknown in the wild state. If, on the other hand, many of these plants have\r\nbeen profoundly modified by culture, the difficulty disappears. The\r\ndifficulty would also be removed if they have been exterminated during the\r\nprogress of civilisation; but M. De Candolle has shown that this probably\r\nhas seldom occurred. As soon as a plant was cultivated in any country, the\r\nhalf-civilised inhabitants would no longer have need to search the whole\r\nsurface of the land for it, and thus lead to its extirpation; and even if\r\nthis did occur during a famine, dormant seeds would be left in the ground.\r\nIn tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature, as was long ago\r\nremarked by Humboldt, overpowers the feeble efforts of man. In anciently\r\ncivilised temperate countries, where the whole face of the land has been\r\ngreatly changed, it can hardly be doubted that some plants have become\r\nextinct; nevertheless De Candolle has shown that all the plants\r\nhistorically known to have been first cultivated in Europe still exist here\r\nin the wild state.\r\n\r\nMM. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/4. 'Considerations sur les Cereales' 1842\r\npage 37. 'Geographie Bot.' 1855 page 930. \"Plus on suppose l'agriculture\r\nancienne et remontant a une epoque d'ignorance, plus il est probable que\r\nles cultivateurs avaient choisi des especes offrant a l'origine meme un\r\navantage incontestable.\") and De Candolle have remarked that our cultivated\r\nplants, more especially the cereals, must originally have existed in nearly\r\ntheir present state; for otherwise they would not have been noticed and\r\nvalued as objects of food. But these authors apparently have not considered\r\nthe many accounts given by travellers of the wretched food collected by\r\nsavages. I have read an account of the savages of Australia cooking, during\r\na dearth, many vegetables in various ways, in the hopes of rendering them\r\ninnocuous and more nutritious. Dr. Hooker found the half-starved\r\ninhabitants of a village in Sikhim suffering greatly from having eaten\r\narum-roots (9/5. Dr. Hooker has given me this information. See also his\r\n'Himalayan Journals' 1854 volume 2 page 49.), which they had pounded and\r\nleft for several days to ferment, so as partially to destroy their\r\npoisonous nature; and he adds that they cooked and ate many other\r\ndeleterious plants. Sir Andrew Smith informs me that in South Africa a\r\nlarge number of fruits and succulent leaves, and especially roots, are used\r\nin times of scarcity. The natives, indeed, know the properties of a long\r\ncatalogue of plants, some having been found during famines to be eatable,\r\nothers injurious to health, or even destructive to life. He met a party of\r\nBaquanas who, having been expelled by the conquering Zulus, had lived for\r\nyears on any roots or leaves which afforded some little nutriment and\r\ndistended their stomachs, so as to relieve the pangs of hunger. They looked\r\nlike walking skeletons, and suffered fearfully from constipation. Sir\r\nAndrew Smith also informs me that on such occasions the natives observe as\r\na guide for themselves, what the wild animals, especially baboons and\r\nmonkeys, eat.\r\n\r\nFrom innumerable experiments made through dire necessity by the savages of\r\nevery land, with the results handed down by tradition, the nutritious,\r\nstimulating, and medicinal properties of the most unpromising plants were\r\nprobably first discovered. It appears, for instance, at first an\r\ninexplicable fact that untutored man, in three distant quarters of the\r\nworld, should have discovered, amongst a host of native plants, that the\r\nleaves of the tea-plant and mattee, and the berries of the coffee, all\r\nincluded a stimulating and nutritious essence, now known to be chemically\r\nthe same. We can also see that savages suffering from severe constipation\r\nwould naturally observe whether any of the roots which they devoured acted\r\nas aperients. We probably owe our knowledge of the uses of almost all\r\nplants to man having originally existed in a barbarous state, and having\r\nbeen often compelled by severe want to try as food almost everything which\r\nhe could chew and swallow.\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of the habits of savages in many quarters of the world,\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that our cereal plants originally existed in\r\ntheir present state so valuable to man. Let us look to one continent alone,\r\nnamely, Africa: Barth (9/6. 'Travels in Central Africa' English translation\r\nvolume 1 pages 529 and 390; volume 2 pages 29, 265, 270. Livingstone\r\n'Travels' page 551.) states that the slaves over a large part of the\r\ncentral region regularly collect the seeds of a wild grass, the Pennisetum\r\ndistichum; in another district he saw women collecting the seeds of a Poa\r\nby swinging a sort of basket through the rich meadow-land. Near Tete,\r\nLivingstone observed the natives collecting the seeds of a wild grass, and\r\nfarther south, as Andersson informs me, the natives largely use the seed of\r\na grass of about the size of canary-seed, which they boil in water. They\r\neat also the roots of certain reeds, and every one has read of the Bushmen\r\nprowling about and digging up with a fire-hardened stake various roots.\r\nSimilar facts with respect to the collection of seeds of wild grasses in\r\nother parts of the world could be given. (9/7. For instance in both North\r\nand South America. Mr. Edgeworth 'Journal Proc. Linn. Soc.' vol 6 Bot. 1862\r\npage 181 states that in the deserts of the Punjab poor women sweep up, \"by\r\na whisk into straw baskets,\" the seeds of four genera of grasses, namely,\r\nof Agrostis, Panicum, Cenchrus, and Pennisetum, as well as the seeds of\r\nfour other genera belonging to distinct families.)\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables and luscious fruits, we\r\ncan hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild carrot and\r\nparsnip, or the little shoots of the wild asparagus, or crabs, sloes, etc.,\r\nshould ever have been valued; yet, from what we know of the habits of\r\nAustralian and South African savages, we need feel no doubt on this head.\r\nThe inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely collected\r\nwild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of roses, elderberries, beechmast, and\r\nother wild berries and fruit. (9/8. Prof. O. Heer 'Die Pflanzen der\r\nPfahlbauten' 1866 aus dem Neujahr. Naturforsch. Geselschaft' 1866; and Dr.\r\nH. Christ in Rutimeyer's 'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 226.) Jemmy\r\nButton, a Fuegian on board the 'Beagle,' remarked to me that the poor and\r\nacid black-currants of Tierra del Fuego were too sweet for his taste.\r\n\r\nThe savage inhabitants of each land, having found out by many and hard\r\ntrials what plants were useful, or could be rendered useful by various\r\ncooking processes, would after a time take the first step in cultivation by\r\nplanting them near their usual abodes. Livingstone (9/9. 'Travels' page\r\n535. Du Chaillu 'Adventures in Equatorial Africa' 1861 page 445.) states\r\nthat the savage Batokas sometimes left wild fruit-trees standing in their\r\ngardens, and occasionally even planted them, \"a practice seen nowhere else\r\namongst the natives.\" But Du Chaillu saw a palm and some other wild fruit-\r\ntrees which had been planted; and these trees were considered private\r\nproperty. The next step in cultivation, and this would require but little\r\nforethought, would be to sow the seeds of useful plants; and as the soil\r\nnear the hovels of the natives (9/10. In Tierra del Fuego the spot where\r\nwigwams had formerly stood could be distinguished at a great distance by\r\nthe bright green tint of the native vegetation.) would often be in some\r\ndegree manured, improved varieties would sooner or later arise. Or a wild\r\nand unusually good variety of a native plant might attract the attention of\r\nsome wise old savage; and he would transplant it, or sow its seed. That\r\nsuperior varieties of wild fruit-trees occasionally are found is certain,\r\nas in the case of the American species of hawthorns, plums, cherries,\r\ngrapes, and hickories, specified by Professor Asa Gray. (9/11. 'American\r\nAcad. of Arts and Sciences' April 10th, 1860 page 413. Downing 'The Fruits\r\nof America' 1845 page 261.) Downing also refers to certain wild varieties\r\nof the hickory, as being \"of much larger size and finer flavour than the\r\ncommon species.\" I have referred to American fruit-trees, because we are\r\nnot in this case troubled with doubts whether or not the varieties are\r\nseedlings which have escaped from cultivation. Transplanting any superior\r\nvariety, or sowing its seeds, hardly implies more forethought than might be\r\nexpected at an early and rude period of civilisation. Even the Australian\r\nbarbarians \"have a law that no plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it\r\nhas flowered;\" and Sir G. Grey (9/12. 'Journals of Expeditions in\r\nAustralia' 1841 volume 2 page 292.) never saw this law, evidently framed\r\nfor the preservation of the plant, violated. We see the same spirit in the\r\nsuperstitious belief of the Fuegians, that killing water-fowl whilst very\r\nyoung will be followed by \"much rain, snow, blow much.\" (9/13. Darwin\r\n'Journal of Researches' 1845 page 215.) I may add, as showing forethought\r\nin the lowest barbarians, that the Fuegians when they find a stranded whale\r\nbury large portions in the sand, and during the often-recurrent famines\r\ntravel from great distances for the remnants of the half-putrid mass.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked (9/14. De Candolle has tabulated the facts in\r\nthe most interesting manner in his 'Geographie Bot.' page 986.) that we do\r\nnot owe a single useful plant to Australia or the Cape of Good Hope,\r\ncountries abounding to an unparalleled degree with endemic species,--or to\r\nNew Zealand, or to America south of the Plata; and, according to some\r\nauthors, not to America northward of Mexico. I do not believe that any\r\nedible or valuable plant, except the canary-grass, has been derived from an\r\noceanic or uninhabited island. If nearly all our useful plants, natives of\r\nEurope; Asia, and South America, had originally existed in their present\r\ncondition, the complete absence of similarly useful plants in the great\r\ncountries just named would be indeed a surprising fact. But if these plants\r\nhave been so greatly modified and improved by culture as no longer closely\r\nto resemble any natural species, we can understand why the above-named\r\ncountries have given us no useful plants, for they were either inhabited by\r\nmen who did not cultivate the ground at all, as in Australia and the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, or who cultivated it very imperfectly, as in some parts of\r\nAmerica. These countries do yield plants which are useful to savage man;\r\nand Dr. Hooker (9/15. 'Flora of Australia' Introduction page 110.)\r\nenumerates no less than 107 such species in Australia alone; but these\r\nplants have not been improved, and consequently cannot compete with those\r\nwhich have been cultivated and improved during thousands of years in the\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\nThe case of New Zealand, to which fine island we as yet owe no widely\r\ncultivated plant, may seem opposed to this view; for, when first\r\ndiscovered, the natives cultivated several plants; but all inquirers\r\nbelieve, in accordance with the traditions of the natives, that the early\r\nPolynesian colonists brought with them seeds and roots, as well as the dog,\r\nwhich had been wisely preserved during their long voyage. The Polynesians\r\nare so frequently lost on the ocean that this degree of prudence would\r\noccur to any wandering party: hence the early colonists of New Zealand,\r\nlike the later European colonists, would not have had any strong inducement\r\nto cultivate the aboriginal plants. According to De Candolle we owe thirty-\r\nthree useful plants to Mexico, Peru, and Chile; nor is this surprising when\r\nwe remember the civilised state of the inhabitants, as shown by the fact of\r\ntheir having practised artificial irrigation and made tunnels through hard\r\nrocks without the use of iron or gunpowder, and who, as we shall see in a\r\nfuture chapter, fully recognised, as far as animals were concerned, and\r\ntherefore probably in the case of plants, the important principle of\r\nselection. We owe some plants to Brazil; and the early voyagers, namely,\r\nVespucius and Cabral, describe the country as thickly peopled and\r\ncultivated. In North America (9/16. For Canada see J. Cartier's Voyage in\r\n1534; for Florida see Narvaez and Ferdinand de Soto's Voyages. As I have\r\nconsulted these and other old Voyages in more than one general collection\r\nof Voyages, I do not give precise references to the pages. See also for\r\nseveral references Asa Gray in the 'American Journal of Science' volume 24\r\nNovember 1857 page 441. For the traditions of the natives of New Zealand\r\nsee Crawfurd 'Grammar and Dict. of the Malay Language' 1852 page 260.) the\r\nnatives cultivated maize, pumpkins, gourds, beans, and peas, \"all different\r\nfrom ours,\" and tobacco; and we are hardly justified in assuming that none\r\nof our present plants are descended from these North American forms. Had\r\nNorth America been civilised for as long a period, and as thickly peopled,\r\nas Asia or Europe, it is probable that the native vines, walnuts,\r\nmulberries, crabs, and plums, would have given rise, after a long course of\r\ncultivation, to a multitude of varieties, some extremely different from\r\ntheir parent-stocks; and escaped seedlings would have caused in the New, as\r\nin the Old World, much perplexity with respect to their specific\r\ndistinctness and parentage.' (9/17. See for example Mr. Hewett C. Watson's\r\nremarks on our wild plums and cherries and crabs: 'Cybele Britannica'\r\nvolume 1 pages 330, 334, etc. Van Mons (in his 'Arbres Fruitiers' 1835 tome\r\n1 page 444) declares that he has found the types of all our cultivated\r\nvarieties in wild seedlings, but then he looks on these seedlings as so\r\nmany aboriginal stocks.)\r\n\r\n[CEREALIA.\r\n\r\nI will now enter on details. The cereals cultivated in Europe consist of\r\nfour genera--wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Of wheat the best modern\r\nauthorities (9/18. See A. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' 1855 page 928 et\r\nseq. Godron 'De l'Espece' 1859 tome 2 page 70; and Metzger 'Die\r\nGetreidearten' etc. 1841.) make four or five, or even seven distinct\r\nspecies; of rye, one; of barley, three; and of oats, two, three, or four\r\nspecies. So that altogether our cereals are ranked by different authors\r\nunder from ten to fifteen distinct species. These have given rise to a\r\nmultitude of varieties. It is a remarkable fact that botanists are not\r\nuniversally agreed on the aboriginal parent-form of any one cereal plant.\r\nFor instance, a high authority writes in 1855 (9/19. Mr. Bentham in his\r\nreview entitled 'Hist. Notes on cultivated Plants' by Dr. A. Targioni-\r\nTozzetti in 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 9 1855 page 133. He informs me\r\nthat he still retains the same opinion.), \"We ourselves have no hesitation\r\nin stating our conviction, as the result of all the most reliable evidence,\r\nthat none of these Cerealia exist, or have existed, truly wild in their\r\npresent state, but that all are cultivated varieties of species now growing\r\nin great abundance in S. Europe or W. Asia.\" On the other hand, Alph. De\r\nCandolle (9/20. 'Geograph. Bot.' page 928. The whole subject is discussed\r\nwith admirable fulness and knowledge.) has adduced abundant evidence that\r\ncommon wheat (Triticum vulgare) has been found wild in various parts of\r\nAsia, where it is not likely to have escaped from cultivation: and there is\r\nsome force in M. Godron's remark, that, supposing these plants to be\r\nescaped seedlings (9/21. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 72. A few years\r\nago the excellent, though misinterpreted, observations of M. Fabre led many\r\npersons to believe that wheat was a modified descendant of Aegilops; but M.\r\nGodron (tome 1 page 165) has shown by careful experiments that the first\r\nstep in the series, viz. Aegilops triticoides, is a hybrid between wheat\r\nand Ae. ovata. The frequency with which these hybrids spontaneously arise,\r\nand the gradual manner in which the Ae. triticoides becomes converted into\r\ntrue wheat, alone leave any doubt with respect to M. Godron's\r\nconclusions.), as they have propagated themselves in a wild state for\r\nseveral generations, their continued resemblance to cultivated wheat\r\nrenders it probable that the latter has retained its aboriginal character.\r\nBut the strong tendency to inheritance, which most of the varieties of\r\nwheat evince, as we shall presently see, is here greatly undervalued. Much\r\nweight must also be attributed to a remark by Professor Hildebrand (9/22.\r\n'Die Verbreitungsmittel der Pflanzen' 1873 page 129.) that when the seeds\r\nor fruit of cultivated plants possess qualities disadvantageous to them as\r\na means of distribution, we may feel almost sure that they no longer retain\r\ntheir aboriginal condition. On the other hand, M. De Candolle insists\r\nstrongly on the frequent occurrence in the Austrian dominions of rye and of\r\none kind of oats in an apparently wild condition. With the exception of\r\nthese two cases, which however are rather doubtful, and with the exception\r\nof two forms of wheat and one of barley, which he believes to have been\r\nfound truly wild, M. De Candolle does not seem fully satisfied with the\r\nother reported discoveries of the parent-forms of our other cereals. With\r\nrespect to oats, according to Mr. Buckmann (9/23. Report to British\r\nAssociation for 1857 page 207.), the wild English Avena fatua can be\r\nconverted by a few years of careful cultivation and selection into forms\r\nalmost identical with two very distinct cultivated races. The whole subject\r\nof the origin and specific distinctness of the various cereal plants is a\r\nmost difficult one; but we shall perhaps be able to judge a little better\r\nafter considering the amount of variation which wheat has undergone.\r\n\r\nMetzger describes seven species of wheat, Godron refers to five, and De\r\nCandolle to only four. It is not improbable that, besides the kinds known\r\nin Europe, other strongly characterised forms exist in the more distant\r\nparts of the world; for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/24. Considerations sur\r\nles Cereales' 1842-43 page 29.) speaks of three new species or varieties,\r\nsent to Europe in 1822 from Chinese Mongolia, which he considers as being\r\nthere indigenous. Moorcroft (9/25. 'Travels in the Himalayan Provinces'\r\netc. 1841 volume 1 page 224.) also speaks of Hasora wheat in Ladakh as very\r\npeculiar. If those botanists are right who believe that at least seven\r\nspecies of wheat originally existed, then the amount of variation in any\r\nimportant character which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been\r\nslight; but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed,\r\nthen it is evident that varieties have arisen so strongly marked, that they\r\nhave been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct. But the\r\nimpossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species and\r\nwhich as varieties, makes it useless to specify in detail the differences\r\nbetween the various kinds of wheat. Speaking generally, the organs of\r\nvegetation differ little (9/26. Col. J. Le Couteur on the 'Varieties of\r\nWheat' pages 23, 79.); but some kinds grow close and upright, whilst others\r\nspread and trail along the ground. The straw differs in being more or less\r\nhollow, and in quality. The ears (9/27. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 'Consid.\r\nsur les Cereales' page 11.) differ in colour and in shape, being\r\nquadrangular, compressed, or nearly cylindrical; and the florets differ in\r\ntheir approximation to each other, in their pubescence, and in being more\r\nor less elongated. The presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous\r\ndifference, and in certain Gramineae serves even as a generic character\r\n(9/28. See an excellent review in Hooker 'Journ. of Botany' volume 8 page\r\n82 note.); although, as remarked by Godron (9/29. 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page\r\n73.) the presence of barbs is variable in certain wild grasses, and\r\nespecially in those such as Bromus secalinus and Lolium temulentum, which\r\nhabitually grow mingled with our cereal crops, and which have thus\r\nunintentionally been exposed to culture. The grains differ in size, weight,\r\nand colour; in being more or less downy at one end, in being smooth or\r\nwrinkled, in being either nearly globular, oval, or elongated; and finally\r\nin internal texture, being tender or hard, or even almost horny, and in the\r\nproportion of gluten which they contain.\r\n\r\nNearly all the races or species of wheat vary, as Godron (9/30. Ibid tome 2\r\npage 75.) has remarked, in an exactly parallel manner,--in the seed being\r\ndowny or glabrous, and in colour,--and in the florets being barbed or not\r\nbarbed, etc. Those who believe that all the kinds are descended from a\r\nsingle wild species may account for this parallel variation by the\r\ninheritance of a similar constitution, and a consequent tendency to vary in\r\nthe same manner; and those who believe in the general theory of descent\r\nwith modification may extend this view to the several species of wheat, if\r\nsuch ever existed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough few of the varieties of wheat present any conspicuous difference,\r\ntheir number is great. Dalbret cultivated during thirty years from 150 to\r\n160 kinds, and excepting in the quality of the grain they all kept true;\r\nColonel Le Couteur possessed upwards of 150, and Philippar 322 varieties.\r\n(9/31. For Dalbret and Philippar see Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 'Consid. sur\r\nles Cereales' pages 45, 70. Le Couteur on Wheat pages 6, 14-17.) As wheat\r\nis an annual, we thus see how strictly many trifling differences in\r\ncharacter are inherited through many generations. Colonel Le Couteur\r\ninsists strongly on this same fact. In his persevering and successful\r\nattempts to raise new varieties, he found that there was only one \"secure\r\nmode to ensure the growth of pure sorts, namely, to grow them from single\r\ngrains or from single ears, and to follow up the plan by afterwards sowing\r\nonly the produce of the most productive so as to form a stock.\" But Major\r\nHallett (9/32. See his Essay on 'Pedigree in Wheat' 1862; also paper read\r\nbefore the British Association 1869 and other publications.) has gone much\r\nfarther, and by the continued selection of plants from the grains of the\r\nsame ear, during successive generations, has made his 'Pedigree in Wheat'\r\n(and other cereals) now famous in many quarters of the world. The great\r\namount of variability in the plants of the same variety is another\r\ninteresting point, which would never have been detected except by an eye\r\nlong practised to the work; thus Colonel Le Couteur relates (9/33.\r\n'Varieties of Wheat' Introduction page 6. Marshall in his 'Rural Economy of\r\nYorkshire' volume 2 page 9 remarks that \"in every field of corn there is as\r\nmuch variety as in a herd of cattle.\") that in a field of his own wheat,\r\nwhich he considered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours,\r\nProfessor La Gasca found twenty-three sorts; and Professor Henslow has\r\nobserved similar facts. Besides such individual variations, forms\r\nsufficiently well marked to be valued and to become widely cultivated\r\nsometimes suddenly appear: thus Mr. Shirreff has had the good fortune to\r\nraise in his lifetime seven new varieties, which are now extensively grown\r\nin many parts of Britain. (9/34. 'Gardener's Chronicle' and 'Agricult.\r\nGazette' 1862 page 963.)\r\n\r\nAs in the case of many other plants, some varieties, both old and new, are\r\nfar more constant in character than others. Colonel Le Couteur was forced\r\nto reject some of his new sub-varieties, which he suspected had been\r\nproduced from a cross, as incorrigibly sportive. On the other hand Major\r\nHallett (9/35. 'Gardener's Chronicle' November 1868 page 1199.) has shown\r\nhow wonderfully constant some varieties are, although not ancient ones, and\r\nalthough cultivated in various countries. With respect to the tendency to\r\nvary, Metzger (9/36. 'Getreidearten' 1841 s. 66, 91, 92, 116, 117.) gives\r\nfrom his own experience some interesting facts: he describes three Spanish\r\nsub-varieties, more especially one known to be constant in Spain, which in\r\nGermany assumed their proper character only during hot summers; another\r\nvariety kept true only in good land, but after having been cultivated for\r\ntwenty-five years became more constant. He mentions two other sub-varieties\r\nwhich were at first inconstant, but subsequently became, apparently without\r\nany selection, accustomed to their new homes, and retained their proper\r\ncharacter. These facts show what small changes in the conditions of life\r\ncause variability, and they further show that a variety may become\r\nhabituated to new conditions. One is at first inclined to conclude with\r\nLoiseleur-Deslongchamps, that wheat cultivated in the same country is\r\nexposed to remarkably uniform conditions; but manures differ, seed is taken\r\nfrom one soil to another, and, what is far more important, the plants are\r\nexposed as little as possible to struggle with other plants, and are thus\r\nenabled to exist under diversified conditions. In a state of nature each\r\nplant is confined to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it\r\ncan seize from the other plants by which it is surrounded.\r\n\r\nWheat quickly assumes new habits of life. The summer and winter kinds were\r\nclassed by Linnaeus as distinct species; but M. Monnier (9/37. Quoted by\r\nGodron 'De l'Espece' volume 2 page 74. So it is, according to Metzger\r\n'Getreidearten' s. 18, with summer and winter barley.) has proved that the\r\ndifference between them is only temporary. He sowed winter-wheat in spring,\r\nand out of one hundred plants four alone produced ripe seeds; these were\r\nsown and resown, and in three years plants were reared which ripened all\r\ntheir seed. Conversely, nearly all the plants raised from summer-wheat,\r\nwhich was sown in autumn, perished from frost; but a few were saved and\r\nproduced seed, and in three years this summer-variety was converted into a\r\nwinter-variety. Hence it is not surprising that wheat soon becomes to a\r\ncertain extent acclimatised, and that seed brought from distant countries\r\nand sown in Europe vegetates at first, or even for a considerable period\r\n(9/38. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 'Cereales' part 2 page 224. Le Couteur page\r\n70. Many other accounts could be added.) differently from our European\r\nvarieties. In Canada the first settlers, according to Kalm (9/39. 'Travels\r\nin North America' 1753-1761 English translation volume 3 page 165.), found\r\ntheir winters too severe for winter-wheat brought from France, and their\r\nsummers often too short for summer-wheat; and they thought that their\r\ncountry was useless for corn crops until they procured summer-wheat from\r\nthe northern parts of Europe, which succeeded well. It is notorious that\r\nthe proportion of gluten differs much under different climates. The weight\r\nof the grain is also quickly affected by climate: Loiseleur-Deslongchamps\r\n(9/40. 'Cereales' part 2 pages 179-183.) sowed near Paris 54 varieties,\r\nobtained from the South of France and from the Black Sea, and 52 of these\r\nyielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier than the parent-seed. He then\r\nsent these heavier grains back to the South of France, but there they\r\nimmediately yielded lighter seed.\r\n\r\nAll those who have closely attended to the subject insist on the close\r\nadaptation of numerous varieties of wheat to various soils and climates\r\neven within the same country; thus Colonel Le Couteur (9/41. 'On the\r\nVarieties of Wheat' Introduction page 7. See Marshall 'Rural Econ. of\r\nYorkshire' volume 2 page 9. With respect to similar cases of adaptation in\r\nthe varieties of oats see some interesting papers in the 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1850 pages 204, 219.) says, \"It is the\r\nsuitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the farmer to pay\r\nhis rent by sowing one variety, where he would be unable to do so by\r\nattempting to grow another of a seemingly better sort.\" This may be in part\r\ndue to each kind becoming habituated to its conditions of life, as Metzger\r\nhas shown certainly occurs, but it is probably in main part due to innate\r\ndifferences between the several varieties.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the deterioration of wheat; that the quality of\r\nthe flour, size of grain, time of flowering, and hardness, may be modified\r\nby climate and soil, seems nearly certain; but that the whole body of any\r\none sub-variety ever becomes changed into another and distinct sub-variety,\r\nthere is no reason to believe. What apparently does take place, according\r\nto Le Couteur (9/42. 'On the Varieties of Wheat' page 59. Mr. Shirreff and\r\na higher authority cannot be given ('Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult.\r\nGazette' 1862 page 963), says \"I have never seen grain which has either\r\nbeen improved or degenerated by cultivation, so as to convey the change to\r\nthe succeeding crop.), is, that some one sub-variety out of the many which\r\nmay always be detected in the same field is more prolific than the others,\r\nand gradually supplants the variety which was first sown.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence is\r\nconflicting, but preponderates against its frequent occurrence. Many\r\nauthors maintain that impregnation takes place in the closed flower, but I\r\nam sure from my own observation that this is not the case, at least with\r\nthose varieties to which I have attended. But as I shall have to discuss\r\nthis subject in another work, it may be here passed over.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all authors admit that numerous varieties of wheat have\r\narisen; but their differences are unimportant, unless, indeed, some of the\r\nso-called species are ranked as varieties. Those who believe that from four\r\nto seven wild species of Triticum originally existed in nearly the same\r\ncondition as at present, rest their belief chiefly on the great antiquity\r\nof the several forms. (9/43. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 930. )\r\nIt is an important fact, which we have recently learnt from the admirable\r\nresearches of Heer (9/44. 'Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866.), that the\r\ninhabitants of Switzerland, even so early as the Neolithic period,\r\ncultivated no less than ten cereal plants, namely, five kinds of wheat, of\r\nwhich at least four are commonly looked at as distinct species, three kinds\r\nof barley, a panicum, and a setaria. If it could be shown that at the\r\nearliest dawn of agriculture five kinds of wheat and three of barley had\r\nbeen cultivated, we should of course be compelled to look at these forms as\r\ndistinct species. But, as Heer has remarked, agriculture even at the\r\nNeolithic period, had already made considerable progress; for, besides the\r\ncereals, peas, poppies, flax, and apparently apples, were cultivated. It\r\nmay also be inferred, from one variety of wheat being the so called\r\nEgyptian, and from what is known of the native country of the panicum and\r\nsetaria, as well as from the nature of the weeds which then grew mingled\r\nwith the crops, that the lake-inhabitants either still kept up commercial\r\nintercourse with some southern people or had originally proceeded as\r\ncolonists from the South.\r\n\r\nLoiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/45. 'Les Cereales' page 94.) has argued that, if\r\nour cereal plants have been greatly modified by cultivation, the weeds\r\nwhich habitually grow mingled with them would have been equally modified.\r\nBut this argument shows how completely the principle of selection has been\r\noverlooked. That such weeds have not varied, or at least do not vary now in\r\nany extreme degree, is the opinion of Mr. H.C. Watson and Professor Asa\r\nGray, as they inform me; but who will pretend to say that they do not vary\r\nas much as the individual plants of the same sub-variety of wheat? We have\r\nalready seen that pure varieties of wheat, cultivated in the same field,\r\noffer many slight variations, which can be selected and separately\r\npropagated; and that occasionally more strongly pronounced variations\r\nappear, which, as Mr. Shirreff has proved, are well worthy of extensive\r\ncultivation. Not until equal attention be paid to the variability and\r\nselection of weeds, can the argument from their constancy under\r\nunintentional culture be of any value. In accordance with the principles of\r\nselection we can understand how it is that in the several cultivated\r\nvarieties of wheat the organs of vegetation differ so little; for if a\r\nplant with peculiar leaves appeared, it would be neglected unless the\r\ngrains of corn were at the same time superior in quality or size. the\r\nselection of seed-corn was strongly recommended (9/46. Quoted by Le Couteur\r\npage 16.) in ancient times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil says,--\r\n\r\nI've seen the largest seeds, tho' view'd with care,\r\nDegenerate, unless th' industrious hand\r\nDid yearly cull the largest.\"\r\n\r\nBut whether in ancient times selection was methodically pursued we may well\r\ndoubt, when we hear how laborious the work has been found by Le Coutour and\r\nHallett. Although the principle of selection is so important, yet the\r\nlittle which man has effected, by incessant efforts (9/47. A. De Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 932.) during thousands of years, in rendering the\r\nplants more productive or the grains more nutritious than they were in the\r\ntime of the old Egyptians, would seem to speak strongly against its\r\nefficacy. But we must not forget that at each successive period the state\r\nof agriculture and the quantity of manure supplied to the land will have\r\ndetermined the maximum degree of productiveness; for it would be impossible\r\nto cultivate a highly productive variety, unless the land contained a\r\nsufficient supply of the necessary chemical elements.\r\n\r\nWe now know that man was sufficiently civilised to cultivate the ground at\r\nan immensely remote period; so that wheat might have been improved long ago\r\nup to that standard of excellence which was possible under the then\r\nexisting state of agriculture. One small class of facts supports this view\r\nof the slow and gradual improvement of our cereals. In the most ancient\r\nlake-habitations of Switzerland, when men employed only flint-tools, the\r\nmost extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar kind, with remarkably\r\nsmall ears and grains. (9/48. O. Heer 'Die Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866.\r\nThe following passage is quoted from Dr. Christ in 'Die Fauna der\r\nPfahlbauten, von Dr. Rutimeyer' 1861 s. 225.) \"Whilst the grains of the\r\nmodern forms are in section from seven to eight millimetres in length, the\r\nlarger grains from the lake-habitations are six, seldom seven, and the\r\nsmaller ones only four. The ear is thus much narrower, and the spikelets\r\nstand out more horizontally, than in our present forms.\" So again with\r\nbarley, the most ancient and most extensively cultivated kind had small\r\nears, and the grains were \"smaller, shorter, and nearer to each other, than\r\nin that now grown; without the husk they were 2 1/2 lines long, and\r\nscarcely 1 1/2 broad, whilst those now grown have a length of three lines,\r\nand almost the same in breadth.\" (9/49. Heer as quoted by Carl Vogt\r\n'Lectures on Man' English translation page 355.) These small-grained\r\nvarieties of wheat and barley are believed by Heer to be the parent-forms\r\nof certain existing allied varieties, which have supplanted their early\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\nHeer gives an interesting account of the first appearance and final\r\ndisappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or\r\nless abundance in Switzerland during former successive periods, and which\r\ngenerally differed more or less from our existing varieties. The peculiar\r\nsmall-eared and small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was the commonest\r\nkind during the Stone period; it lasted down to the Helvetico-Roman age,\r\nand then became extinct. A second kind was rare at first, but afterwards\r\nbecame more frequent. A third, the Egyptian wheat (T. turgidum), does not\r\nagree exactly with any existing variety, and was rare during the Stone\r\nperiod. A fourth kind (T. dicoccum) differs from all known varieties of\r\nthis form. A fifth kind (T. monococcum) is known to have existed during the\r\nStone period only by the presence of a single ear. A sixth kind, the common\r\nT. spelta, was not introduced into Switzerland until the Bronze age. Of\r\nbarley, besides the short-eared and small-grained kind, two others were\r\ncultivated, one of which was very scarce, and resembled our present common\r\nH. distichum. During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced; the oat-\r\ngrains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing\r\nvarieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the Stone period,\r\nprobably for its oil; but the variety which then existed is not now known.\r\nA peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the Stone to the Bronze age,\r\nand then became extinct; whilst a peculiar bean, likewise having small\r\nseeds, came in at the Bronze period and lasted to the time of the Romans.\r\nThese details sound like the descriptions given by palaeontologists of the\r\nfirst appearance, the increasing rarity, and final extinction or\r\nmodification of fossil species, embedded in the successive stages of a\r\ngeological formation.\r\n\r\nFinally, every one must judge for himself whether it is more probable that\r\nthe several forms of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are descended from\r\nbetween ten and fifteen species, most of which are now either unknown or\r\nextinct, or whether they are descended from between four and eight species,\r\nwhich may have either closely resembled our present cultivated forms, or\r\nhave been so widely different as to escape identification. In this latter\r\ncase we must conclude that man cultivated the cereals at an enormously\r\nremote period, and that he formerly practised some degree of selection,\r\nwhich in itself is not improbable. We may, perhaps, further believe that,\r\nwhen wheat was first cultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in\r\nsize, in the same manner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are\r\nknown to increase quickly in bulk under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[MAIZE OR INDIAN CORN: Zea mays.\r\n\r\nBotanists are nearly unanimous that all the cultivated kinds belong to the\r\nsame species. It is undoubtedly (9/50. See Alph. De Candolle's long\r\ndiscussion in his 'Geograph. Bot.' page 942. With respect to New England\r\nsee Silliman's 'American Journal' volume 44 page 99.) of American origin,\r\nand was grown by the aborigines throughout the continent from New England\r\nto Chili. Its cultivation must have been extremely ancient, for Tschudi\r\n(9/51. 'Travels in Peru' English translation page 177.) describes two\r\nkinds, now extinct or not known in Peru, which were taken from tombs\r\napparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas. 'But there is even stronger\r\nevidence of antiquity, for I found on the coast of Peru (9/52. 'Geolog.\r\nObserv. on S. America' 1846 page 49.) heads of maize, together with\r\neighteen species of recent sea-shell, embedded in a beach which had been\r\nupraised at least 85 feet above the level of the sea. In accordance with\r\nthis ancient cultivation, numerous American varieties have arisen. The\r\naboriginal form has not as yet been discovered in the wild state. A\r\npeculiar kind (9/53. This maize is figured in Bonafous' magnificent work,\r\n'Hist. Nat. du Mais' 1836 P1. v. bis, and in the 'Journal of Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 1 1846 page 115 where an account is given of the result of sowing\r\nthe seed. A young Guarany Indian, on seeing this kind of maize, told\r\nAuguste St. Hilaire (see De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 951) that it\r\ngrew wild in the humid forests of his native land. Mr. Teschemacher in\r\n'Proc. Boston Soc. Hist.' October 19, 1842 gives an account of sowing the\r\nseed.), in which the grains, instead of being naked, are concealed by husks\r\nas much as eleven lines in length, has been stated, but on insufficient\r\nevidence, to grow wild in Brazil. It is almost certain that the aboriginal\r\nform would have had its grains thus protected (9/54. Moquin-Tandon\r\n'Elements de Teratologie' 1841 page 126.); but the seeds of the Brazilian\r\nvariety produce, as I hear from Professor Asa Gray, and as is stated in two\r\npublished accounts, either common or husked maize; and it is not credible\r\nthat a wild species, when first cultivated, should vary so quickly and in\r\nso great a degree.\r\n\r\nMaize has varied in an extraordinary and conspicuous manner. Metzger (9/55.\r\n'Die Getreidearten' 1841 s. 208. I have modified a few of Metzger's\r\nstatements in accordance with those made by Bonafous in his great work\r\n'Hist. Nat. du Mais' 1836.), who paid particular attention to the\r\ncultivation of this plant, makes twelve races (unter-art) with numerous\r\nsub-varieties: of the latter some are tolerably constant, others quite\r\ninconstant. The different races vary in height from 15-18 feet to only 16-\r\n18 inches, as in a dwarf variety described by Bonafous. The whole ear is\r\nvariable in shape, being long and narrow, or short and thick, or branched.\r\nThe ear in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind.\r\nThe seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows, or are\r\nplaced irregularly. The seeds are coloured--white, pale-yellow, orange,\r\nred, violet, or elegantly streaked with black (9/56. Godron 'De l'Espece'\r\ntome 2 page 80; Al. De Candolle ibid page 951.); and in the same ear there\r\nare sometimes seeds of two colours. In a small collection I found that a\r\nsingle grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven grains of\r\nanother variety. The shape of the seed varies greatly, being very flat, or\r\nnearly globular, or oval; broader than long, or longer than broad; without\r\nany point, or produced into a sharp tooth, and this tooth is sometimes\r\nrecurved. One variety (the rugosa of Bonafous, and which is extensively\r\ncultivated in the United States as sweet corn) has its seeds curiously\r\nwrinkled, giving to the whole ear a singular appearance. Another variety\r\n(the cymosa of Bon.) carries its ears so crowded together that it is called\r\nmais a bouquet. The seeds of some varieties contain much glucose instead of\r\nstarch. Male flowers sometimes appear amongst the female flowers, and Mr.\r\nJ. Scott has lately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true\r\nmale panicle, and likewise hermaphrodite flowers. (9/57. 'Transact. Bot.\r\nSoc. of Edinburgh' volume 8 page 60.) Azara describes (9/58. 'Voyages dans\r\nl'Amerique Meridionale' tome 1 page 147.) a variety in Paraguay the grains\r\nof which are very tender, and he states that several varieties are fitted\r\nfor being cooked in various ways. The varieties also differ greatly in\r\nprecocity, and have different powers of resisting dryness and the action of\r\nviolent wind. (9/59. Bonafous 'Hist. Nat. du Mais' page 31.) Some of the\r\nforegoing differences would certainly be considered of specific value with\r\nplants in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nLe Comte Re states that the grains of all the varieties which he cultivated\r\nultimately assumed a yellow colour. But Bonafous (9/60. Ibid page 31.)\r\nfound that most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept true\r\nto their proper tints; and he adds that in the valleys of the Pyrenees and\r\non the plains of Piedmont a white maize has been cultivated for more than a\r\ncentury, and has undergone no change.\r\n\r\nThe tall kinds grown in southern latitudes, and therefore exposed to great\r\nheat, require from six to seven months to ripen their seed; whereas the\r\ndwarf kinds, grown in northern and colder climates, require only from three\r\nto four months. (9/61. Metzger 'Getreidearten' s. 206.) Peter Kalm (9/62.\r\n'Description of Maize' by P. Kalm 1752 in 'Swedish Acts' volume 4. I have\r\nconsulted an old English MS. translation.), who particularly attended to\r\nthis plant, says, that in the United States, in proceeding from south to\r\nnorth, the plants steadily diminish in bulk. Seeds brought from lat. 37 deg\r\nin Virginia, and sown in lat. 43-44 deg in New England, produce plants\r\nwhich will not ripen their seed, or ripen them with the utmost difficulty.\r\nSo it is with seed carried from New England to lat. 45-47 deg in Canada. By\r\ntaking great care at first, the southern kinds after some years' culture\r\nripen their seed perfectly in their northern homes, so that this is an\r\nanalogous case with that of the conversion of summer into winter wheat, and\r\nconversely. When tall and dwarf maize are planted together, the dwarf kinds\r\nare in full flower before the others have produced a single flower; and in\r\nPennsylvania they ripen their seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize.\r\nMetzger also mentions a European maize which ripens its seed four weeks\r\nearlier than another European kind. With these facts, so plainly showing\r\ninherited acclimatisation, we may readily believe Kalm, who states that in\r\nNorth America maize and some other plants have gradually been cultivated\r\nfurther and further northward. All writers agree that to keep the varieties\r\nof maize pure they must be planted separately so that they shall not cross.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the climate of Europe on the American varieties is highly\r\nremarkable. Metzger obtained seed from various parts of America, and\r\ncultivated several kinds in Germany. I will give an abstract of the changes\r\nobserved (9/63. 'Getreidearten' s. 208.) in one case, namely, with a tall\r\nkind (Breit-korniger mais, Zea altissima) brought from the warmer parts of\r\nAmerica. During the first year the plants were twelve feet high, and a few\r\nseeds were perfected; the lower seeds in the ear kept true to their proper\r\nform, but the upper seeds became slightly changed. In the second generation\r\nthe plants were from nine to ten feet in height, and ripened their seed\r\nbetter; the depression on the outer side of the seed had almost\r\ndisappeared, and the original beautiful white colour had become duskier.\r\nSome of the seeds had even become yellow, and in their now rounded form\r\nthey approached common European maize. In the third generation nearly all\r\nresemblance to the original and very distinct American parent-form was\r\nlost. In the sixth generation this maize perfectly resembled a European\r\nvariety, described as the second sub-variety of the fifth race. When\r\nMetzger published his book, this variety was still cultivated near\r\nHeidelberg, and could be distinguished from the common kind only by a\r\nsomewhat more vigorous growth. Analogous results were obtained by the\r\ncultivation of another American race, the \"white-tooth corn,\" in which the\r\ntooth nearly disappeared even in the second generation. A third race, the\r\n\"chicken-corn,\" did not undergo so great a change, but the seeds became\r\nless polished and pellucid. In the above cases the seeds were carried from\r\na warm to a colder climate. But Fritz Muller informs me that a dwarf\r\nvariety with small rounded seeds (papa-gaien-mais), introduced from Germany\r\ninto S. Brazil, produces plants as tall, with seeds as flat, as those of\r\nthe kind commonly cultivated there.]\r\n\r\nThese facts afford the most remarkable instance known to me of the direct\r\nand prompt action of climate on a plant. It might have been expected that\r\nthe tallness of the stem, the period of vegetation, and the ripening of the\r\nseed, would have been thus affected; but it is a much more surprising fact\r\nthat the seeds should have undergone so rapid and great a change. As,\r\nhowever, flowers, with their product the seed, are formed by the\r\nmetamorphosis of the stem and leaves, any modification in these latter\r\norgans would be apt to extend, through correlation, to the organs of\r\nfructification.\r\n\r\n[CABBAGE (Brassica oleracea).\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how greatly the various kinds of cabbage differ in\r\nappearance. In the Island of Jersey, from the effects of particular culture\r\nand of climate a stalk has grown to the height of sixteen feet, and \"had\r\nits spring shoots at the top occupied by a magpie's nest:\" the woody stems\r\nare not unfrequently from ten to twelve feet in height, and are there used\r\nas rafters (9/64. 'Cabbage Timber' 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 744,\r\nquoted from Hooker 'Journal of Botany.' A walking-stick made from a\r\ncabbage-stalk is exhibited in the Museum at Kew.) and as walking-sticks. We\r\nare thus reminded that in certain countries plants belonging to the\r\ngenerally herbaceous order of the Cruciferae are developed into trees.\r\nEvery one can appreciate the difference between green or red cabbages with\r\ngreat single heads; Brussel-sprouts with numerous little heads; broccolis\r\nand cauliflowers with the greater number of their flowers in an aborted\r\ncondition, incapable of producing seed, and borne in a dense corymb instead\r\nof an open panicle; savoys with their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and\r\nborecoles and kails, which come nearest to the wild parent-form. There are\r\nalso various frizzled and laciniated kinds, some of such beautiful colours\r\nthat Vilmorin in his Catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties which are\r\nvalued solely for ornament. Some kinds are less commonly known, such as the\r\nPortuguese Couve Tronchuda, with the ribs of its leaves greatly thickened;\r\nand the Kohlrabi or choux-raves, with their stems enlarged into great\r\nturnip-like masses above the ground; and the recently formed new race\r\n(9/65. 'Journal de la Soc. Imp. d'Horticulture' 1855 page 254 quoted from\r\n'Gartenflora' April 1855.) of the choux-raves, already including nine sub-\r\nvarieties, in which the enlarged part lies beneath the ground like a\r\nturnip.\r\n\r\nAlthough we see such great differences in the shape, size, colour,\r\narrangement, and manner of growth of the leaves and stem, and of the\r\nflower-stems in the broccoli and cauliflower, it is remarkable that the\r\nflowers themselves, the seed-pods and seeds, present extremely slight\r\ndifferences or none at all. (9/66. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 52;\r\nMetzger 'Syst. Beschreibung der Kult. Kohlarten' 1833 s. 6.) I compared the\r\nflowers of all the principal kinds; those of the Couve Tronchuda are white\r\nand rather smaller than in common cabbages; those of the Portsmouth\r\nbroccoli have narrower sepals, and smaller, less elongated petals; and in\r\nno other cabbage could any difference be detected. With respect to the\r\nseed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, do they differ, being a little\r\nlonger and narrower than usual. I made a collection of the seeds of twenty-\r\neight different kinds, and most of them were undistinguishable; when there\r\nwas any difference it was excessively slight; thus, the seeds of various\r\nbroccolis and cauliflowers, when seen in mass, are a little redder; those\r\nof the early green Ulm savoy are rather smaller; and those of the Breda\r\nkail slightly larger than usual, but not larger than the seeds of the wild\r\ncabbage from the coast of Wales. What a contrast in the amount of\r\ndifference is presented if, on the one hand, we compare the leaves and\r\nstems of the various kinds of cabbage with their flowers, pods, and seeds,\r\nand on the other hand the corresponding parts in the varieties of maize and\r\nwheat! The explanation is obvious; the seeds alone are valued in our\r\ncereals, and their variations have been selected; whereas the seeds, seed-\r\npods, and flowers, have been utterly neglected in the cabbage, whilst many\r\nuseful variations in their leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved\r\nfrom an extremely remote period, for cabbages were cultivated by the old\r\nCelts. (9/67. Regnier 'De l'Economie Publique des Celtes' 1818 page 438.)\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to give a classified description (9/68. See the elder\r\nDe Candolle in 'Transact. of Hort. Soc.' volume 5; and Metzger 'Kohlarten'\r\netc.) of the numerous races, sub-races, and varieties of the cabbage; but\r\nit may be mentioned that Dr. Lindley has lately proposed (9/69. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1859 page 992.) a system founded on the state of development of\r\nthe terminal and lateral leaf-buds. Thus:\r\n\r\nI. All the leaf-buds active and open, as in the wild-cabbage, kail, etc.\r\n\r\nII. All the leaf-buds active, but forming heads, as in Brussel-sprouts,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIII. Terminal leaf-bud alone active, forming a head as in common cabbages,\r\nsavoys, etc.\r\n\r\nIV. Terminal leaf-bud alone active, and open, with most of the flowers\r\nabortive and succulent, as in the cauliflower and broccoli.\r\n\r\nV. All the leaf-buds active and open, with most of the flowers abortive and\r\nsucculent, as in the sprouting-broccoli. This latter variety is a new one,\r\nand bears the same relation to common broccoli, as Brussel-sprouts do to\r\ncommon cabbages; it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli, and was\r\nfound faithfully to transmit its newly-acquired and remarkable characters.\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds of cabbage existed at least as early as the sixteenth\r\ncentury (9/70. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' pages 842 and 989.), so\r\nthat numerous modifications of structure have been inherited for a long\r\nperiod. This fact is the more remarkable as great care must be taken to\r\nprevent the crossing of the different kinds. To give proof of this: I\r\nraised 233 seedlings from cabbages of different kinds, which had purposely\r\nbeen planted near each other, and of the seedlings no less than 155 were\r\nplainly deteriorated and mongrelised; nor were the remaining 78 all\r\nperfectly true. It may be doubted whether many permanent varieties have\r\nbeen formed by intentional or accidental crosses; for such crossed plants\r\nare found to be very inconstant. One kind, however, called \"Cottager's\r\nKail,\" has lately been produced by crossing common kail and Brussel-\r\nsprouts, recrossed with purple broccoli (9/71. 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\nFebruary 1858 page 128.), and is said to be true; but plants raised by me\r\nwere not nearly so constant in character as any common kind of cabbage.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the kinds keep true if carefully preserved from crossing,\r\nyet the seed-beds must be yearly examined, and a few seedlings are\r\ngenerally found false; but even in this case the force of inheritance is\r\nshown, for, as Metzger has remarked (9/72. 'Kohlarten' s. 22.) when\r\nspeaking of Brussel-sprouts, the variations generally keep to their \"unter\r\nart,\" or main race. But in order that any kind may be truly propagated\r\nthere must be no great change in the conditions of life; thus cabbages will\r\nnot form heads in hot countries, and the same thing has been observed with\r\nan English variety grown during an extremely warm and damp autumn near\r\nParis. (9/73. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 52; Metzger 'Kohlarten' s.\r\n22.) Extremely poor soil also affects the characters of certain varieties.\r\n\r\nMost authors believe that all the races are descended from the wild cabbage\r\nfound on the western shores of Europe; but Alph. De Candolle (9/74.\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 840.) forcibly argues, on historical and other\r\ngrounds, that it is more probable that two or three closely allied forms,\r\ngenerally ranked as distinct species, still living in the Mediterranean\r\nregion, are the parents, now all commingled together, of the various\r\ncultivated kinds. In the same manner as we have often seen with\r\ndomesticated animals, the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no\r\nlight on the characteristic differences between the cultivated forms. If\r\nour cabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species, every\r\ntrace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them is\r\nnow lost, for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without scrupulous\r\ncare to prevent intercrossing.\r\n\r\nThe other cultivated forms of the genus Brassica are descended, according\r\nto the view adopted by Godron and Metzger (9/75. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome\r\n2 page 54; Metzger 'Kohlarten' s. 10.), from two species, B. napus and\r\nrapa; but according to other botanists from three species; whilst others\r\nagain strongly suspect that all these forms, both wild and cultivated,\r\nought to be ranked as a single species. Brassica napus has given rise to\r\ntwo large groups, namely, Swedish turnips (believed to be of hybrid origin)\r\n(9/76. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1856 page 729. See more\r\nespecially ibid 1868 page 275: the writer asserts that he planted a variety\r\nof cabbage (B. oleracea) close to turnips (B. rapa) and raised from the\r\ncrossed seedlings true Swedish turnips. These latter plants ought,\r\ntherefore, to be classed with cabbages or turnips, and not under B. napus.)\r\nand Colzas, the seeds of which yield oil. Brassica rapa (of Koch) has also\r\ngiven rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape.\r\nThe evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so\r\ndifferent in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the\r\nturnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in\r\nuncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross\r\nto such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true. (9/77.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1855 page 730.) Metzger by\r\nculture converted the biennial or winter rape into the annual or summer\r\nrape,--varieties which have been thought by some authors to be specifically\r\ndistinct. (9/78. Metzger, 'Kohlarten' s. 51.)\r\n\r\nIn the production of large, fleshy, turnip-like stems, we have a case of\r\nanalogous variation in three forms which are generally considered as\r\ndistinct species. But scarcely any modification seems so easily acquired as\r\na succulent enlargement of the stem or root--that is, a store of nutriment\r\nlaid up for the plant's own future use. We see this in our radishes, beet,\r\nand in the less generally known \"turnip-rooted\" celery, and in the\r\nfinocchio, or Italian variety of the common fennel. Mr. Buckman has lately\r\nproved by his interesting experiments bow quickly the roots of the wild\r\nparsnip can be enlarged, as Vilmorin formerly proved in the case of the\r\ncarrot. (9/79. These experiments by Vilmorin have been quoted by many\r\nwriters. An eminent botanist, Prof. Decaisne, has lately expressed doubts\r\non the subject from his own negative results, but these cannot be valued\r\nequally with positive results. On the other hand, M. Carriere has lately\r\nstated ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154), that he took seed from a\r\nwild carrot, growing far from any cultivated land, and even in the first\r\ngeneration the roots of his seedlings differed in being spindle-shaped,\r\nlonger, softer, and less fibrous than those of the wild plant. From these\r\nseedlings he raised several distinct varieties.)\r\n\r\nThis latter plant, in its cultivated state, differs in scarcely any\r\ncharacter from the wild English carrot, except in general luxuriance and in\r\nthe size and quality of its roots; but ten varieties, differing in the\r\ncolour, shape, and quality of the root, are cultivated in England and come\r\ntrue by seed. (9/80. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 835.) Hence\r\nwith the carrot, as in so many other cases, for instance with the numerous\r\nvarieties and sub-varieties of the radish, that part of the plant which is\r\nvalued by man, falsely appears alone to have varied. The truth is that\r\nvariations in this part alone have been selected; and the seedlings\r\ninheriting a tendency to vary in the same way, analogous modifications have\r\nbeen again and again selected, until at last a great amount of change has\r\nbeen effected.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the radish, M. Carriere, by sowing the seed of the wild\r\nRaphanus raphanistrum in rich soil, and by continued selection during\r\nseveral generations, raised many varieties, closely like the cultivated\r\nradish (R. sativus) in their roots, as well as the wonderful Chinese\r\nvariety, R. caudatus: (see 'Journal d'Agriculture pratique' tome 1 1869\r\npage 159; also a separate essay 'Origine des Plantes Domestiques' 1869.)\r\nRaphanus raphanistrum and sativus have often been ranked as distinct\r\nspecies, and owing to differences in their fruit even as distinct genera;\r\nbut Professor Hoffman ('Bot. Zeitung' 1872 page 482) has now shown that\r\nthese differences, remarkable as they are, graduate away, the fruit of R.\r\ncaudatus being intermediate. By cultivating R. raphanistrum during several\r\ngenerations (ibid 1873 page 9), Professor Hoffman also obtained plants\r\nbearing fruits like those of R. sativus.\r\n\r\nPEA (Pisum sativum).\r\n\r\nMost botanists look at the garden-pea as specifically distinct from the\r\nfield-pea (P. arvense). The latter exists in a wild state in Southern\r\nEurope; but the aboriginal parent of the garden-pea has been found by one\r\ncollector alone, as he states, in the Crimea. (9/81. Alph. De Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' 960. Mr. Bentham 'Hort. Journal' volume 9 1855 page 141\r\nbelieves that garden and field peas belong to the same species, and in this\r\nrespect he differs from Dr. Targioni.) Andrew Knight crossed, as I am\r\ninformed by the Rev. A. Fitch, the field-pea with a well-known garden\r\nvariety, the Prussian pea, and the cross seems to have been perfectly\r\nfertile. Dr. Alefield has recently studied (9/82. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1860\r\ns. 204.) the genus with care, and, after having cultivated about fifty\r\nvarieties, concludes that certainly they all belong to the same species. It\r\nis an interesting fact already alluded to, that, according to O. Heer\r\n(9/83. 'Die Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866 s. 23.) the peas found in the\r\nlake-habitations of Switzerland of the Stone and Bronze ages, belong to an\r\nextinct variety, with exceedingly small seeds, allied to P. arvense or the\r\nfield-pea. The varieties of the common garden-pea are numerous, and differ\r\nconsiderably from one another. For comparison I planted at the same time\r\nforty-one, English and French varieties. They differed greatly in height,--\r\nnamely from between 6 and 12 inches to 8 feet (9/84. A variety called the\r\nRounciva attains this height, as is stated by Mr. Gordon in 'Transact.\r\nHort. Soc.' 2nd series volume 1 1835 page 374 from which paper I have taken\r\nsome facts.),--in manner of growth, and in period of maturity. Some differ\r\nin general aspect even while only two or three inches in height. The stems\r\nof the Prussian pea are much branched. The tall kinds have larger leaves\r\nthan the dwarf kinds, but not in strict proportion to their height:--HAIR'S\r\nDWARF MONMOUTH has very large leaves, and the POIS NAIN HATIF, and the\r\nmoderately tall BLUE PRUSSIAN, have leaves about two-thirds of the size of\r\nthe tallest kind. In the DANECROFT the leaflets are rather small and a\r\nlittle pointed; in the QUEEN OF DWARFS rather rounded; and in the QUEEN OF\r\nENGLAND broad and large. In these three peas the slight differences in the\r\nshape of the leaves are accompanied by slight differences in colour, in the\r\nPOIS GEANT SANS PARCHEMIN, which bears purple flowers, the leaflets in the\r\nyoung plant are edged with red; and in all the peas with purple flowers the\r\nstipules are marked with red.\r\n\r\nIn the different varieties, one, two, or several flowers in a small\r\ncluster, are borne on the same peduncle; and this is a difference which is\r\nconsidered of specific value in some of the Leguminosae. In all the\r\nvarieties the flowers closely resemble each other except in colour and\r\nsize. They are generally white, sometimes purple, but the colour is\r\ninconstant even in the same variety. In WARNER'S EMPEROR, which is a tall\r\nkind, the flowers are nearly double the size of the POIS NAIN HATIF; but\r\nHAIR'S DWARF MONMOUTH, which has large leaves, likewise has large flowers.\r\nThe calyx in the VICTORIA MARROW is large, and in BISHOP'S LONG POD the\r\nsepals are rather narrow. In no other kind is there any difference in the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nThe pods and seeds, which with natural species afford such constant\r\ncharacters, differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea; and\r\nthese are the valuable, and consequently the selected parts. SUGAR PEAS, or\r\nPOIS SANS PARCHEMIN, are remarkable from their thin pods, which, whilst\r\nyoung, are cooked and eaten whole; and in this group, which, according to\r\nMr. Gordon includes eleven sub-varieties, it is the pod which differs most;\r\nthus LEWIS'S NEGRO-PODDED PEA has a straight, broad, smooth, and dark-\r\npurple pod, with the husk not so thin as in the other kinds; the pod of\r\nanother variety is extremely bowed; that of the POIS GEANT is much pointed\r\nat the extremity; and in the variety \"A GRANDS COSSES\" the peas are seen\r\nthrough the husk in so conspicuous a manner that the pod, especially when\r\ndry, can hardly at first be recognised as that of a pea.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary varieties the pods also differ much in size;--in colour,\r\nthat of WOODFORD'S GREEN MARROW being bright-green when dry, instead of\r\npale brown, and that of the purple-podded pea being expressed by its name;-\r\n-in smoothness, that of DANECROFT being remarkably glossy, whereas that of\r\nthe NE PLUS ULTRA is rugged; in being either nearly cylindrical, or broad\r\nand flat;--in being pointed at the end, as in THURSTON'S RELIANCE, or much\r\ntruncated, as in the AMERICAN DWARF. In the AUVERGNE PEA the whole end of\r\nthe pod is bowed upwards. In the QUEEN OF THE DWARFS and in SCIMITAR PEAS\r\nthe pod is almost elliptic in shape. I here give drawings of the four most\r\ndistinct pods produced by the plants cultivated by me.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 41. PODS AND PEAS. I. Queen of Dwarfs. II. American Dwarf. III.\r\nThurston's Reliance. IV. Pois Geant sans parchemin. a. Dan O'Rourke Pea. b.\r\nQueen of Dwarfs Pea. c. Knight's Tall White Marrow. a. Lewis's Negro Pea.)\r\n\r\nIn the pea itself we have every tint between almost pure white, brown,\r\nyellow, and intense green; in the varieties of the SUGAR PEAS we have these\r\nsame tints, together with red passing through fine purple into a dark\r\nchocolate tint. These colours are either uniform or distributed in dots,\r\nstriae, or moss-like marks; they depend in some cases on the colour of the\r\ncotyledons seen through the skin, and in other cases on the outer coats of\r\nthe pea itself. In the different varieties, the pods contain, according to\r\nMr. Gordon, from eleven or twelve to only four or five peas. The largest\r\npeas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the smallest; and the latter\r\nare not always borne by the most dwarfed kinds. Peas differ much in shape,\r\nbeing smooth and spherical, smooth and oblong, nearly oval in the QUEEN OF\r\nTHE DWARFS, and nearly cubical and crumpled in many of the larger kinds.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the value of the differences between the chief varieties,\r\nit cannot be doubted that, if one of the tall SUGAR-PEAS, with purple\r\nflowers, thin-skinned pods of an extraordinary shape, including large,\r\ndark-purple peas, grew wild by the side of the lowly QUEEN OF THE DWARFS,\r\nwith white flowers, greyish-green, rounded leaves, scimitar-like pods,\r\ncontaining oblong, smooth, pale-coloured peas, which became mature at a\r\ndifferent season: or by the side of one of the gigantic sorts, like the\r\nCHAMPION OF ENGLAND, with leaves of great size, pointed pods, and large,\r\ngreen, crumpled, almost cubical peas,--all three kinds would be ranked as\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nAndrew Knight (9/85. 'Phil. Tract.' 1799 page 196.) has observed that the\r\nvarieties of peas keep very true, because they are not crossed by insects.\r\nAs far as the fact of keeping true is concerned, I hear from Mr. Masters of\r\nCanterbury, well known as the originator of several new kinds, that certain\r\nvarieties have remained constant for a considerable time,--for instance,\r\nKNIGHT'S BLUE DWARF, which came out about the year 1820. (9/86. 'Gardener's\r\nMagazine' volume 1 1826 page 153.) But the greater number of varieties have\r\na singularly short existence: thus Loudon remarks (9/87. 'Encyclopaedia of\r\nGardening' page 823.) that \"sorts which were highly approved in 1821, are\r\nnow, in 1833, nowhere to be found;\" and on comparing the lists of 1833 with\r\nthose of 1855, I find that nearly all the varieties have changed. Mr.\r\nMasters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to\r\nlose their character. As with other plants, certain varieties can be\r\npropagated truly, whilst others show a determined tendency to vary; thus\r\ntwo peas differing in shape, one round and the other wrinkled, were found\r\nby Mr. Masters within the same pod, but the plants raised from the wrinkled\r\nkind always evinced a strong tendency to produce round peas. Mr. Masters\r\nalso raised from a plant of another variety four distinct sub-varieties,\r\nwhich bore blue and round, white and round, blue and wrinkled, and white\r\nand wrinkled peas; and although he sowed these four varieties separately\r\nduring several successive years, each kind always reproduced all four kinds\r\nmixed together!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the varieties not naturally intercrossing, I have\r\nascertained that the pea, which in this respect differs from some other\r\nLeguminosae, is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects. Yet I have\r\nseen humble-bees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and\r\nbecome so thickly dusted with pollen, that it could hardly fail to be left\r\non the stigma of the next flower which was visited. Nevertheless, distinct\r\nvarieties growing closely together rarely cross; and I have reason to\r\nbelieve that this is due to their stigmas being prematurely fertilised in\r\nthis country by pollen from the same flower. The horticulturists who raise\r\nseed-peas are thus enabled to plant distinct varieties close together\r\nwithout any bad consequences; and it is certain, as I have myself found,\r\nthat true seed may be saved during at least several generations under these\r\ncircumstances. (9/88. See Dr. Anderson to the same effect in the 'Bath Soc.\r\nAgricultural Papers' volume 4 page 87.) Mr. Fitch raised, as he informs me,\r\none variety for twenty years, and it always came true, though grown close\r\nto other varieties. From the analogy of kidney-beans I should have expected\r\n(9/89. I have published full details of experiments on this subject in the\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 October 25.) that varieties thus circumstanced\r\nwould have occasionally crossed; and I shall give in the eleventh chapter\r\ntwo cases of this having occurred, as shown (in a manner hereafter to be\r\nexplained) by the pollen of the one variety having acted directly on the\r\nseeds of the other. Whether many of the new varieties which incessantly\r\nappear are due to such occasional and accidental crosses, I do not know.\r\nNor do I know whether the short existence of almost all the numerous\r\nvarieties is the result of mere change of fashion, or of their having a\r\nweak constitution, from being the product of long-continued self-\r\nfertilisation. It may, however, be noticed that several of Andrew Knight's\r\nvarieties, which have endured longer than most kinds, were raised towards\r\nthe close of the last century by artificial crosses; some of them, I\r\nbelieve, were still vigorous in 1860; but now, in 1865, a writer, speaking\r\n(9/90. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 387.) of Knight's four kinds of\r\nmarrows, says, they have acquired a famous history, but their glory has\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Beans (Faba vulgaris), I will say but little. Dr. Alefield\r\nhas given (9/91. 'Bonplandia' 10, 1862 s. 348.) short diagnostic characters\r\nof forty varieties. Everyone who has seen a collection must have been\r\nstruck with the great difference in shape, thickness, proportional length\r\nand breadth, colour, and size which beans present. What a contrast between\r\na Windsor and Horse-bean! As in the case of the pea, our existing varieties\r\nwere preceded during the Bronze age in Switzerland (9/92. Heer 'Die\r\nPflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866 s. 22.) by a peculiar and now extinct\r\nvariety producing very small beans. (9/93. Mr. Bentham informs me that in\r\nPoitou and the adjoining parts of France, varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris\r\nare extremely numerous, and so different that they were described by Savi\r\nas distinct species. Mr. Bentham believes that all are descended from an\r\nunknown eastern species. Although the varieties differ so greatly in\r\nstature and in their seeds, \"there is a remarkable sameness in the\r\nneglected characters of foliage and flowers, and especially in the\r\nbracteoles, an insignificant character in the eyes even of botanists.\")\r\n\r\nPOTATO (Solanum tuberosum).\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt about the parentage of this plant; for the cultivated\r\nvarieties differ extremely little in general appearance from the wild\r\nspecies, which can be recognised in its native land at the first glance.\r\n(9/94. Darwin 'Journal of Researches' 1845 page 285. Sabine in 'Transact.\r\nHort. Soc.' volume 5 page 249.) The varieties cultivated in Britain are\r\nnumerous; thus Lawson (9/95. 'Synopsis of the Vegetable Products of\r\nScotland' quoted in Wilson's 'British Farming' page 317.) gives a\r\ndescription of 175 kinds. I planted eighteen kinds in adjoining rows; their\r\nstems and leaves differed but little, and in several cases there was as\r\ngreat a difference between the individuals of the same variety as between\r\nthe different varieties. The flower varied in size, and in colour between\r\nwhite and purple, but in no other respect, except that in one kind the\r\nsepals were somewhat elongated. One strange variety has been described\r\nwhich always produces two sorts of flowers, the first double and sterile,\r\nthe second single and fertile. (9/96. Sir G. Mackenzie, in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 790.) The fruit or berries also differ, but only in a\r\nslight degree. (9/97. Putsche und Vertuch 'Versuch einer Monographie der\r\nKartoffeln' 1819 s. 9, 15. See also Dr. Anderson 'Recreations in\r\nAgriculture' volume 4 page 325.) The varieties are liable in very different\r\ndegree to the attack of the Colorado potato-beetle. (9/98. Walsh 'The\r\nAmerican Entomologist' 1869 page 160. Also S. Tenney 'The American\r\nNaturalist' May 1871 page 171.)\r\n\r\nThe tubers, on the other hand, present a wonderful amount of diversity.\r\nThis fact accords with the principle that the valuable and selected parts\r\nof all cultivated productions present the greatest amount of modification.\r\nThey differ much in size and shape, being globular, oval, flattened,\r\nkidney-like, or cylindrical. One variety from Peru is described (9/99.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1052.) as being quite straight, and at\r\nleast six inches in length, though no thicker than a man's finger. The eyes\r\nor buds differ in form, position, and colour. The manner in which the\r\ntubers are arranged on the so-called roots or rhizomes is different; thus,\r\nin the gurken-kartoffeln they form a pyramid with the apex downwards, and\r\nin another variety they bury themselves deep in the ground. The roots\r\nthemselves run either near the surface or deep in the ground. The tubers\r\nalso differ in smoothness and colour, being externally white, red, purple,\r\nor almost black, and internally white, yellow, or almost black. They differ\r\nin flavour and quality, being either waxy or mealy; in their period of\r\nmaturity, and in their capacity for long preservation.\r\n\r\nAs with many other plants which have been long propagated by bulbs, tubers,\r\ncuttings, etc., by which means the same individual is exposed during a\r\nlength of time to diversified conditions, seedling potatoes generally\r\ndisplay innumerable slight differences. Several varieties, even when\r\npropagated by tubers, are far from constant, as will be seen in the chapter\r\non Bud-variation. Dr. Anderson (9/100. 'Bath Society Agricult. Papers'\r\nvolume 5 page 127. And 'Recreations in Agriculture' volume 5 page 86.)\r\nprocured seed from an Irish purple potato, which grew far from any other\r\nkind, so that it could not at least in this generation have been crossed,\r\nyet the many seedlings varied in almost every possible respect, so that\r\n\"scarcely two plants were exactly alike.\" Some of the plants which closely\r\nresembled each other above ground, produced extremely dissimilar tubers;\r\nand some tubers which externally could hardly be distinguished, differed\r\nwidely in quality when cooked. Even in this case of extreme variability,\r\nthe parent-stock had some influence on the progeny, for the greater number\r\nof the seedlings resembled in some degree the parent Irish potato. Kidney\r\npotatoes must be ranked amongst the most highly cultivated and artificial\r\nraces; nevertheless their peculiarities can often be strictly propagated by\r\nseed. A great authority, Mr. Rivers (9/101. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863\r\npage 643.) states that \"seedlings from the ash-leaved kidney always bear a\r\nstrong resemblance to their parent. Seedlings from the fluke-kidney are\r\nstill more remarkable for their adherence to their parent stock, for, on\r\nclosely observing a great number during two seasons, I have not been able\r\nto observe the least difference, either in earliness, productiveness, or in\r\nthe size or shape of their tubers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.X.\r\n\r\nPLANTS continued--FRUITS--ORNAMENTAL TREES--FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nFRUITS.\r\n\r\nGRAPES.\r\nVARY IN ODD AND TRIFLING PARTICULARS.\r\n\r\nMULBERRY.\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE GROUP.\r\nSINGULAR RESULTS FROM CROSSING.\r\n\r\nPEACH AND NECTARINE.\r\nBUD-VARIATION.\r\nANALOGOUS VARIATION.\r\nRELATION TO THE ALMOND.\r\n\r\nAPRICOT.\r\n\r\nPLUMS.\r\nVARIATION IN THEIR STONES.\r\n\r\nCHERRIES.\r\nSINGULAR VARIETIES OF.\r\n\r\nAPPLE.\r\n\r\nPEAR.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY.\r\nINTERBLENDING OF THE ORIGINAL FORMS.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY.\r\nSTEADY INCREASE IN SIZE OF THE FRUIT.\r\nVARIETIES OF.\r\n\r\nWALNUT.\r\nNUT.\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEOUS PLANTS.\r\nWONDERFUL VARIATION OF.\r\n\r\nORNAMENTAL TREES.\r\nTHEIR VARIATION IN DEGREE AND KIND.\r\nASH-TREE.\r\nSCOTCH-FIR.\r\nHAWTHORN.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS.\r\nMULTIPLE ORIGIN OF MANY KINDS.\r\nVARIATION IN CONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITIES.\r\nKIND OF VARIATION.\r\nROSES.\r\nSEVERAL SPECIES CULTIVATED.\r\nPANSY.\r\nDAHLIA.\r\nHYACINTH.\r\nHISTORY AND VARIATION OF.\r\n\r\n[THE VINE (Vitis vinifera) (Grapes).\r\n\r\nThe best authorities consider all our grapes as the descendants of one\r\nspecies which now grows wild in western Asia, which grew wild during the\r\nBronze age in Italy (10/1. Heer 'Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866 s. 28.),\r\nand which has recently been found fossil in a tufaceous deposit in the\r\nsouth of France. (10/2. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 872; Dr. A.\r\nTargioni-Tozzetti in 'Jour. Hort. Soc.' vol 9 page 133. For the fossil vine\r\nfound by Dr. G. Planchon see 'Nat. Hist. Review' 1865 April page 224. See\r\nalso the valuable works of M. de Saporta on the 'Tertiary Plants of\r\nFrance.') Some authors, however, entertain much doubt about the single\r\nparentage of our cultivated varieties, owing to the number of semi-wild\r\nforms found in Southern Europe, especially as described by Clemente (10/3.\r\nGodron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 100.) in a forest in Spain; but as the\r\ngrape sows itself freely in Southern Europe, and as several of the chief\r\nkinds transmit their characters by seed (10/4. See an account of M.\r\nVibert's experiments by Alex. Jordan in 'Mem. de l'Acad. de Lyon' tome 2\r\n1852 page 108.), whilst others are extremely variable, the existence of\r\nmany different escaped forms could hardly fail to occur in countries where\r\nthis plant has been cultivated from the remotest antiquity. That the vine\r\nvaries much when propagated by seed, we may infer from the largely\r\nincreased number of varieties since the earlier historical records. New\r\nhot-house varieties are produced almost every year; for instance (10/5.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1864 page 488.) a golden-coloured variety has been\r\nrecently raised in England from a black grape without the aid of a cross.\r\nVan Mons (10/6. 'Arbres Fruitiers' 1836 tome 2 page 290.) reared a\r\nmultitude of varieties from the seed of one vine, which was completely\r\nseparated from all others, so that there could not, at least in this\r\ngeneration, have been any crossing, and the seedlings presented \"les\r\nanalogues de toutes les sortes,\" and differed in almost every possible\r\ncharacter both in the fruits and foliage.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated varieties are extremely numerous; Count Odart says that he\r\nwill not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800, perhaps\r\neven 1000 varieties, but not a third of these have any value. In the\r\ncatalogue of fruit cultivated in the Horticultural Gardens of London,\r\npublished in 1842, 99 varieties are enumerated. Wherever the grape is grown\r\nmany varieties occur: Pallas describes 24 in the Crimea, and Burnes\r\nmentions 10 in Cabool. The classification of the varieties has much\r\nperplexed writers, and Count Odart is reduced to a geographical system; but\r\nI will not enter on this subject, nor on the many and great differences\r\nbetween the varieties. I will merely specify a few curious and trifling\r\npeculiarities, all taken from Odart's highly esteemed work (10/7. Odart\r\n'Ampelographie Universelle' 1849.) for the sake of showing the diversified\r\nvariability of this plant. Simon has classed grapes into two main\r\ndivisions, those with downy leaves, and those with smooth leaves, but he\r\nadmits that in one variety, namely the Rebazo, the leaves are either\r\nsmooth, or downy; and Odart (page 70) states that some varieties have the\r\nnerves alone, and other varieties their young leaves, downy, whilst the old\r\nones are smooth. The Pedro-Ximenes grape (Odart page 397) presents a\r\npeculiarity by which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of other\r\nvarieties, namely, that when the fruit is nearly ripe the nerves of the\r\nleaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow. The Barbera d'Asti is well\r\nmarked by several characters (page 426), amongst others, \"by some of the\r\nleaves, and it is always the lowest on the branches, suddenly becoming of a\r\ndark red colour.\" Several authors in classifying grapes have founded their\r\nmain divisions on the berries being either round or oblong; and Odart\r\nadmits the value of this character; yet there is one variety, the Maccabeo\r\n(page 71), which often produces small round, and large oblong, berries in\r\nthe same bunch. Certain grapes called Nebbiolo (page 429) present a\r\nconstant character, sufficient for their recognition, namely, \"the slight\r\nadherence of that part of the pulp which surrounds the seeds to the rest of\r\nthe berry, when cut through transversely.\" A Rhenish variety is mentioned\r\n(page 228) which likes a dry soil; the fruit ripens well, but at the moment\r\nof maturity, if much rain falls, the berries are apt to rot; on the other\r\nhand, the fruit of a Swiss variety (page 243) is valued for well sustaining\r\nprolonged humidity. This latter variety sprouts late in the spring, yet\r\nmatures its fruit early; other varieties (page 362) have the fault of being\r\ntoo much excited by the April sun, and in consequence suffer from frost. A\r\nStyrian variety (page 254) has brittle foot-stalks, so that the clusters of\r\nfruit are often blown off; this variety is said to be particularly\r\nattractive to wasps and bees. Other varieties have tough stalks, which\r\nresist the wind. Many other variable characters could be given, but the\r\nforegoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and\r\nconstitutional details the vine varies. During the vine disease in France\r\ncertain old groups of varieties (10/8. M. Bouchardat in 'Comptes Rendus'\r\nDecember 1, 1851 quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 435. See also\r\nC.V. Riley on the manner in which some few of the varieties of the American\r\nLabruscan Vine escape the attacks of the Phylloxera: 'Fourth Annual Report\r\non the Insects of Missouri' 1872 page 63 and 'Fifth Report' 1873 page 66.)\r\nhave suffered far more from mildew than others. Thus \"the group of\r\nChasselas, so rich in varieties, did not afford a single fortunate\r\nexception;\" certain other groups suffered much less; the true old Burgundy,\r\nfor instance, was comparatively free from disease, and the Carminat\r\nlikewise resisted the attack. The American vines, which belong to a\r\ndistinct species, entirely escaped the disease in France; and we thus see\r\nthat those European varieties which best resist the disease must have\r\nacquired in a slight degree the same constitutional peculiarities as the\r\nAmerican species.\r\n\r\nWHITE MULBERRY (Morus alba).\r\n\r\nI mention this plant because it has varied in certain characters, namely,\r\nin the texture and quality of the leaves, fitting them to serve as food for\r\nthe domesticated silkworm, in a manner not observed with other plants; but\r\nthis has arisen simply from such variations in the mulberry having been\r\nattended to, selected, and rendered more or less constant. M. de\r\nQuatrefages (10/9. 'Etudes sur les Maladies actuelles du Ver a Soie' 1859\r\npage 321.) briefly describes six kinds cultivated in one valley in France:\r\nof these the AMOUROUSO produces excellent leaves, but is rapidly being\r\nabandoned because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves: the\r\nANTOFINO yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality, but not in great\r\nquantity: the CLARO is much sought for because the leaves can be easily\r\ncollected: lastly, the ROSO bears strong hardy leaves, produced in large\r\nquantity, but with the one inconvenience, that they are best adapted for\r\nthe worms after their fourth moult. MM. Jacquemet-Bonnefont, of Lyon,\r\nhowever, remark in their catalogue (1862) that two sub-varieties have been\r\nconfounded under the name of the roso, one having leaves too thick for the\r\ncaterpillars, the other being valuable because the leaves can easily be\r\ngathered from the branches without the bark being torn.\r\n\r\nIn India the mulberry has also given rise to many varieties. The Indian\r\nform is thought by many botanists to be a distinct species; but as Royle\r\nremarks (10/10. 'Productive Resources of India' page 130.), \"so many\r\nvarieties have been produced by cultivation that it is difficult to\r\nascertain whether they all belong to one species;\" they are, as he adds,\r\nnearly as numerous as those of the silkworm.\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE GROUP.\r\n\r\nWe here meet with great confusion in the specific distinction and parentage\r\nof the several kinds. Gallesio (10/11. 'Traite du Citrus' 1811. 'Teoria\r\ndella Riproduzione Vegetale' 1816. I quote chiefly from this second work.\r\nIn 1839 Gallesio published in folio 'Gli Agrumi dei Giard. Bot. di Firenze'\r\nin which he gives a curious diagram of the supposed relationship of all the\r\nforms.), who almost devoted his life-time to the subject, considers that\r\nthere are four species, namely, sweet and bitter oranges, lemons, and\r\ncitrons, each of which has given rise to whole groups of varieties,\r\nmonsters, and supposed hybrids. One high authority (10/12. Mr. Bentham\r\n'Review of Dr. A. Targioni-Tozzetti, Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page\r\n133.) believes that these four reputed species are all varieties of the\r\nwild Citrus medica, but that the shaddock (Citrus decumana), which is not\r\nknown in a wild state, is a distinct species; though its distinctness is\r\ndoubted by another writer \"of great authority on such matters,\" namely, Dr.\r\nBuchanan Hamilton. Alph. De Candolle (10/13. 'Geograph. Bot.' page 863.),\r\non the other hand--and there cannot be a more capable judge--advances what\r\nhe considers sufficient evidence of the orange (he doubts whether the\r\nbitter and sweet kinds are specifically distinct), the lemon, and citron,\r\nhaving been found wild, and consequently that they are distinct. He\r\nmentions two other forms cultivated in Japan and Java, which he ranks\r\nundoubted species; he speaks rather more doubtfully about the shaddock,\r\nwhich varies much, and has not been found wild; and finally he considers\r\nsome forms, such as Adam's apple and the bergamotte, as probably hybrids.\r\n\r\nI have briefly abstracted these opinions for the sake of showing those who\r\nhave never attended to such subjects, how perplexing they are. It would,\r\ntherefore, be useless for my purpose to give a sketch of the conspicuous\r\ndifferences between the several forms. Besides the ever-recurrent\r\ndifficulty of determining whether forms found wild are truly aboriginal or\r\nare escaped seedlings, many of the forms, which must be ranked as\r\nvarieties, transmit their characters almost perfectly by seed. Sweet and\r\nbitter oranges differ in no important respect except in the flavour of\r\ntheir fruit, but Gallesio (10/14. 'Teoria della Riproduzione' pages 52-57.)\r\nis most emphatic that both kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute\r\ncertainty. Consequently, in accordance with his simple rule, he classes\r\nthem as distinct species; as he does sweet and bitter almonds, the peach\r\nand nectarine, etc. He admits, however, that the soft-shelled pine-tree\r\nproduces not only soft-shelled but some hard-shelled seedlings, so that a\r\nlittle greater force in the power of inheritance would, according to this\r\nrule, raise a soft-shelled pine-tree into the dignity of an aboriginally\r\ncreated species. The positive assertion made by Macfayden (10/15. Hooker\r\n'Bot. Misc.' volume 1 page 302; volume 2 page 111.) that the pips of sweet\r\noranges produced in Jamaica, according to the nature of the soil in which\r\nthey are sown, either sweet or bitter oranges, is probably an error; for M.\r\nAlph. De Candolle informs me that since the publication of his great work\r\nhe has received accounts from Guiana, the Antilles, and Mauritius, that in\r\nthese countries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their character. Gallesio\r\nfound that the willow-leafed and the Little China oranges reproduced their\r\nproper leaves and fruit; but the seedlings were not quite equal in merit to\r\ntheir parents. The red-fleshed orange, on the other hand, fails to\r\nreproduce itself. Gallesio also observed that the seeds of several other\r\nsingular varieties all reproduced trees having a peculiar physiognomy,\r\npartly resembling their parent-forms. I can adduce another case: the myrtle\r\nleaved orange is ranked by all authors as a variety, but is very distinct\r\nin general aspect: in my father's greenhouse, during many years, it rarely\r\nyielded any fruit, but at last produced one; and a tree thus raised was\r\nidentical with the parent-form.\r\n\r\nAnother and more serious difficulty in determining the rank of the several\r\nforms is that, according to Gallesio (10/16. 'Teoria della Riproduzione'\r\npage 53.) they largely intercross without artificial aid; thus he\r\npositively states that seeds taken from lemon-trees (C. lemonum) growing\r\nmingled with the citron (C. medica), which is generally considered as a\r\ndistinct species, produced a graduated series of varieties between these\r\ntwo forms. Again, an Adam's apple was produced from the seed of a sweet\r\norange, which grew close to lemons and citrons. But such facts hardly aid\r\nus in determining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties; for\r\nit is now known that undoubted species of Verbascum, Cistus, Primula,\r\nSalix, etc., frequently cross in a state of nature. If indeed it were\r\nproved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were even\r\npartially sterile, it would be a strong argument in favour of their rank as\r\nspecies. Gallesio asserts that this is the case; but he does not\r\ndistinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the effects of\r\nculture; and he almost destroys the force of this statement by another\r\n(10/17. Gallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' page 69.) namely, that when he\r\nimpregnated the flowers of the common orange with the pollen taken from\r\nundoubted VARIETIES of the orange, monstrous fruits were produced, which\r\nincluded \"little pulp, and had no seeds, or imperfect seeds.\"\r\n\r\nIn this tribe of plants we meet with instances of two highly remarkable\r\nfacts in vegetable physiology: Gallesio (10/18. Ibid page 67.) impregnated\r\nan orange with pollen from a lemon, and the fruit borne on the mother tree\r\nhad a raised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and taste,\r\nbut the pulp was like that of an orange and included only imperfect seeds.\r\nThe possibility of pollen from one variety or species directly affecting\r\nthe fruit produced by another variety of species, is a subject which I\r\nshall fully discuss in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nThe second remarkable fact is, that two supposed hybrids (10/19. Gallesio\r\n'Teoria della Riproduzione' pages 75, 76.) (for their hybrid nature was not\r\nascertained), between an orange and either a lemon or citron, produced on\r\nthe same tree leaves, flowers, and fruit of both pure parent-forms, as well\r\nas of a mixed or crossed nature. A bud taken from any one of the branches\r\nand grafted on another tree produces either one of the pure kinds or a\r\ncapricious tree reproducing the three kinds. Whether the sweet lemon, which\r\nincludes within the same fruit segments of differently flavoured pulp\r\n(10/20. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 613.), is an analogous case, I\r\nknow not. But to this subject I shall have to recur.\r\n\r\nI will conclude by giving from A. Risso (10/21. 'Annales du Museum' tome 20\r\npage 188.) a short account of a very singular variety of the common orange.\r\nIt is the \"citrus aurantium fructu variabili,\" which on the young shoots\r\nproduces rounded-oval leaves spotted with yellow, borne on petioles with\r\nheart-shaped wings; when these leaves fall off, they are succeeded by\r\nlonger and narrower leaves, with undulated margins, of a pale-green colour\r\nembroidered with yellow, borne on footstalks without wings. The fruit\r\nwhilst young is pear-shaped, yellow, longitudinally striated, and sweet;\r\nbut as it ripens, it becomes spherical, of a reddish-yellow, and bitter.\r\n\r\nPEACH AND NECTARINE (Amygdalus persica).\r\n\r\nThe best authorities are nearly unanimous that the peach has never been\r\nfound wild. It was introduced from Persia into Europe a little before the\r\nChristian era, and at this period few varieties existed. Alph. De Candolle\r\n(10/22. 'Geograph. Bot.' page 882.), from the fact of the peach not having\r\nspread from Persia at an earlier period, and from its not having pure\r\nSanscrit or Hebrew names, believes that it is not an aboriginal of Western\r\nAsia, but came from the terra incognita of China. The supposition, however,\r\nthat the peach is a modified almond which acquired its present character at\r\na comparatively late period, would, I presume, account for these facts; on\r\nthe same principle that the nectarine, the offspring of the peach, has few\r\nnative names, and became known in Europe at a still later period.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 42.-PEACH AND ALMOND STONES, of natural size, viewed edgeways. 1.\r\nCommon English peach. 2.

A coloured drawing is given of this\r\nhybrid.), from finding that a seedling-tree, raised from a sweet almond\r\nfertilised by the pollen of a peach, yielded fruit quite like that of a\r\npeach, suspected that the peach-tree is a modified almond; and in this he\r\nhas been followed by various authors. (10/24. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856\r\npage 532. A writer, it may be presumed Dr. Lindley, remarks on the perfect\r\nseries which may be formed between the almond and the peach. Another high\r\nauthority, Mr. Rivers, who has had such wide experience, strongly suspects\r\n('Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 27) that peaches, if left to a state of\r\nnature, would in the course of time retrograde into thick-fleshed almonds.)\r\nA first-rate peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet\r\npulp, surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly flattened stone,\r\ncertainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly furrowed,\r\nmuch flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a tough, greenish layer\r\nof bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham (10/25. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page\r\n168.) has particularly called attention to the stone of the almond being so\r\nmuch more flattened than that of the peach. But in the several varieties of\r\nthe almond, the stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is\r\ncompressed, in size, shape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows, as\r\nmay be seen in figure 42 (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds as I have been able to\r\ncollect. With peach-stones also (Nos. 1 to 3) the degree of compression and\r\nelongation is seen to vary; so that the stone of the Chinese Honey-peach\r\n(No. 3) is much more elongated and compressed than that of the (No. 8)\r\nSmyrna almond. Mr. Rivers, of Sawbridgeworth, to whom I am indebted for\r\nsome of the specimens above figured, and who has had such great\r\nhorticultural experience, has called my attention to several varieties\r\nwhich connect the almond and the peach. In France there is a variety called\r\nthe Peach-Almond, which Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated, and which is\r\ncorrectly described in a French catalogue as being oval and swollen, with\r\nthe aspect of a peach, including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy\r\ncovering, which is sometimes eatable. (10/26. Whether this is the same\r\nvariety as one lately mentioned ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154) by\r\nM. Carriere under the name of persica intermedia, I know not; this variety\r\nis said to be intermediate in nearly all its characters between the almond\r\nand peach; it produces during successive years very different kinds of\r\nfruit.) A remarkable statement by M. Luizet has recently appeared in the\r\n'Revue Horticole' (10/27. Quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 800.),\r\nnamely, that a Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore, during 1863 and 1864\r\nalmonds alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds. M. Carriere, in\r\ncommenting on this fact, cites the case of a double-flowered almond which,\r\nafter producing during several years almonds, suddenly bore for two years\r\nin succession spherical fleshy peach-like fruits, but in 1865 reverted to\r\nits former state and produced large almonds.\r\n\r\nAgain, as I hear from Mr. Rivers, the double-flowering Chinese peaches\r\nresemble almonds in their manner of growth and in their flowers; the fruit\r\nis much elongated and flattened, with the flesh both bitter and sweet, but\r\nnot uneatable, and it is said to be of better quality in China. From this\r\nstage one small step leads us to such inferior peaches as are occasionally\r\nraised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers sowed a number of peach-stones\r\nimported from the United States, where they are collected for raising\r\nstocks, and some of the trees raised by him produced peaches which were\r\nvery like almonds in appearance, being small and hard, with the pulp not\r\nsoftening till very late in the autumn. Van Mons (10/28. Quoted in 'Journal\r\nde La Soc. Imp. d'Horticulture' 1855 page 238.) also states that he once\r\nraised from a peach-stone a peach having the aspect of a wild tree, with\r\nfruit like that of the almond. From inferior peaches, such as these just\r\ndescribed, we may pass by small transitions, through clingstones of poor\r\nquality, to our best and most melting kinds. From this gradation, from the\r\ncases of sudden variation above recorded, and from the fact that the peach\r\nhas not been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that\r\nthe peach is the descendant of the almond, improved and modified in a\r\nmarvellous manner.\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, is opposed to this conclusion. A hybrid, raised by\r\nKnight from the sweet almond by the pollen of the peach, produced flowers\r\nwith little or no pollen, yet bore fruit, having been apparently fertilised\r\nby a neighbouring nectarine. Another hybrid, from a sweet almond by the\r\npollen of a nectarine, produced during the first three years imperfect\r\nblossoms, but afterwards perfect flowers with an abundance of pollen. If\r\nthis slight degree of sterility cannot be accounted for by the youth of the\r\ntrees (and this often causes lessened fertility), or by the monstrous state\r\nof the flowers, or by the conditions to which the trees were exposed, these\r\ntwo cases would afford a good argument against the peach being the\r\ndescendant of the almond.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the peach has proceeded from the almond, it has certainly\r\ngiven rise to nectarines, or smooth peaches, as they are called by the\r\nFrench. Most of the varieties, both of the peach and nectarine, reproduce\r\nthemselves truly by seed. Gallesio (10/29. 'Teoria della Riproduzione\r\nVegetale' 1816 page 86.) says he has verified this with respect to eight\r\nraces of the peach. Mr. Rivers (10/30. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page\r\n1195.) has given some striking instances from his own experience, and it is\r\nnotorious that good peaches are constantly raised in North America from\r\nseed. Many of the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to their\r\nkind, such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited freestone\r\npeaches, the blood clingstone, the heath, and the lemon clingstone. On the\r\nother hand, a clingstone peach has been known to give rise to a freestone.\r\n(10/31. Mr. Rivers 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1859 page 774.) In England it has\r\nbeen noticed that seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same\r\nsize and colour. Some characters, however, contrary to what might have been\r\nexpected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the\r\nglands on the leaves. (10/32. Downing 'The Fruits of America' 1845 pages\r\n475, 489, 492, 494, 496. See also F. Michaux 'Travels in N. America'\r\nEnglish translation page 228. For similar cases in France see Godron 'De\r\nl'Espece' tome 2 page 97.) With respect to nectarines, both cling and\r\nfreestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by seed.\r\n(10/33. Brickell 'Nat. Hist. of N. Carolina' page 102 and Downing 'Fruit\r\nTrees' page 505.) In England the new white nectarine was a seedling of the\r\nold white, and Mr. Rivers (10/34. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1196.)\r\nhas recorded several similar cases. From this strong tendency to\r\ninheritance, which both peach and nectarine trees exhibit,--from certain\r\nslight constitutional differences (10/35. The peach and nectarine do not\r\nsucceed equally well in the some soil: see Lindley 'Horticulture' page\r\n351.) in their nature,--and from the great difference in their fruit both\r\nin appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the\r\ntrees differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that they have been ranked by some\r\nauthors as specifically distinct. Gallesio does not doubt that they are\r\ndistinct; even Alph. De Candolle does not appear perfectly assured of their\r\nspecific identity: and an eminent botanist has quite recently (10/36.\r\nGodron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 1859 page 97.) maintained that the nectarine\r\n\"probably constitutes a distinct species.\"\r\n\r\nHence it may be worth while to give all the evidence on the origin of the\r\nnectarine. The facts in themselves are curious, and will hereafter have to\r\nbe referred to when the important subject of bud-variation is discussed. It\r\nis asserted (10/37. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 394.) that the\r\nBoston nectarine was produced from a peach-stone, and this nectarine\r\nreproduced itself by seed. (10/38. Downing's 'Fruit Trees' page 502.) Mr.\r\nRivers states (10/39. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1195.) that from\r\nstones of three distinct varieties of the peach he raised three varieties\r\nof nectarine; and in one of these cases no nectarine grew near the parent\r\npeach-tree. In another instance Mr. Rivers raised a nectarine from a peach,\r\nand in the succeeding generation another nectarine from this nectarine.\r\n(10/40. 'Journal of Horticulture' February 5, 1866 page 102.) Other such\r\ninstances have been communicated to me, but they need not be given. Of the\r\nconverse case, namely, of nectarine-stones yielding peach-trees (both free\r\nand clingstones), we have six undoubted instances recorded by Mr. Rivers;\r\nand in two of these instances the parent nectarines had been seedlings from\r\nother nectarines. (10/41. Mr. Rivers in 'Gardener's 'Chronicle' 1859 page\r\n774, 1862 page 1195; 1865 page 1059; and 'Journal of Hort.' 1866 page 102.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the more curious case of full-grown peach-trees suddenly\r\nproducing nectarines by bud-variation (or sports as they are called by\r\ngardeners), the evidence is superabundant; there is also good evidence of\r\nthe same tree producing both peaches and nectarines, or half-and-half\r\nfruit; by this term I mean a fruit with the one-half a perfect peach, and\r\nthe other half a perfect nectarine.\r\n\r\nPeter Collinson in 1741 recorded the first case of a peach-tree producing a\r\nnectarine (10/42. 'Correspondence of Linnaeus' 1821 pages 7, 8, 70.) and in\r\n1766 he added two other instances. In the same work, the editor, Sir J.E.\r\nSmith, describes the more remarkable case of a tree in Norfolk which\r\nusually bore both perfect nectarines and perfect peaches; but during two\r\nseasons some of the fruit were half and half in nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Salisbury in 1808 (10/43. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 page 103.)\r\nrecords six other cases of peach-trees producing nectarines. Three of the\r\nvarieties are named; viz., the Alberge, Belle Chevreuse, and Royal George.\r\nThis latter tree seldom failed to produce both kinds of fruit. He gives\r\nanother case of a half-and-half fruit.\r\n\r\nAt Radford in Devonshire (10/44. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' 1826 volume 1.\r\npage 471.) a clingstone peach, purchased as the Chancellor, was planted in\r\n1815, and in 1824, after having previously produced peaches alone, bore on\r\none branch twelve nectarines; in 1825 the same branch yielded twenty-six\r\nnectarines, and in 1826 thirty-six nectarines, together with eighteen\r\npeaches. One of the peaches was almost as smooth on one side as a\r\nnectarine. The nectarines were as dark as, but smaller than, the Elruge.\r\n\r\nAt Beccles a Royal George peach (10/45. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' 1828\r\npage 53.) produced a fruit, \"three parts of it being peach and one part\r\nnectarine, quite distinct in appearance as well as in flavour.\" The lines\r\nof division were longitudinal, as represented in the woodcut. A nectarine-\r\ntree grew five yards from this tree.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chapman states (10/46. Ibid 1830 page 597.) that he has often\r\nseen in Virginia very old peach-trees bearing nectarines.\r\n\r\nA writer in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' says that a peach tree planted\r\nfifteen years previously (10/47. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 617.)\r\nproduced this year a nectarine between two peaches; a nectarine-tree grew\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 (10/48. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 589.) a Vanguard peach-\r\ntree produced, in the midst of its ordinary fruit, a single red Roman\r\nnectarine.\r\n\r\nMr. Calver is stated (10/49. 'Phytologist' volume 4 page 299.) to have\r\nraised in the United States a seedling peach which produced a mixed crop of\r\nboth peaches and nectarines.\r\n\r\nNear Dorking (10/50. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 531.) a branch of the\r\nTeton de Venus peach, which reproduces itself truly by seed (10/51. Godron,\r\n'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 97.), bore its own fruit \"so remarkable for its\r\nprominent point, and a nectarine rather smaller but well formed and quite\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\nThe previous cases all refer to peaches suddenly producing nectarines, but\r\nat Carclew (10/52. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 531.) the unique case\r\noccurred, of a nectarine-tree, raised twenty years before from seed and\r\nnever grafted, producing a fruit half peach and half nectarine;\r\nsubsequently bore a perfect peach.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the foregoing facts; we have excellent evidence of peach-stones\r\nproducing nectarine-trees, and of nectarine-stones producing peach-trees,--\r\nof the same tree bearing peaches and nectarines,--of peach-trees suddenly\r\nproducing by bud-variation nectarines (such nectarines reproducing\r\nnectarines by seed), as well as fruit in part nectarine and in part peach,-\r\n-and, lastly, of one nectarine-tree first bearing half-and-half fruit, and\r\nsubsequently true peaches. As the peach came into existence before the\r\nnectarine, it might have been expected from the law of reversion that\r\nnectarines would have given birth by bud-variation or by seed to peaches,\r\noftener than peaches to nectarines; but this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\nTwo explanations have been suggested to account for these conversions.\r\nFirst, that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids (10/53. Alph.\r\nDe Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 886.) between the peach and nectarine,\r\nand have reverted by bud-variation or by seed to one of their pure parent\r\nforms. This view in itself is not very improbable; for the Mountaineer\r\npeach, which was raised by Knight from the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of\r\nthe violette hative nectarine (10/54. Thompson in Loudon's 'Encyclop. of\r\nGardening' page 911.), produces peaches, but these are said SOMETIMES to\r\npartake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be\r\nobserved that in the previous list no less than six well-known varieties\r\nand several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly produced\r\nperfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an extremely rash\r\nsupposition that all these varieties of the peach, which have been\r\ncultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a vestige of a\r\nmixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second explanation is, that\r\nthe fruit of the peach has been directly affected by the pollen of the\r\nnectarine: although this certainly is possible, it cannot here apply; for\r\nwe have not a shadow of evidence that a branch which has borne fruit\r\ndirectly affected by foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards\r\nto produce buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form.\r\nNow it is known that when a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a nectarine\r\nthe same branch has in several instances gone on during successive years\r\nproducing nectarines. The Carclew nectarine, on the other hand, first\r\nproduced half-and-half fruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may\r\nconfidently accept the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the\r\npeach, which may be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the\r\nfollowing chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he given.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the peach and the nectarine run in parallel lines. In both\r\nclasses the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit being\r\nwhite, red, or yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the flowers\r\nbeing large or small, with certain other characteristic differences; and in\r\nthe leaves being serrated without glands, or crenated and furnished with\r\nglobose or reniform glands. (10/55. 'Catalogue of Fruit in Garden of Hort.\r\nSoc.' 1842 page 105.) We can hardly account for this parallelism by\r\nsupposing that each variety of the nectarine is descended from a\r\ncorresponding variety of the peach; for though our nectarines are certainly\r\nthe descendants of several kinds of peaches, yet a large number are the\r\ndescendants of other nectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced\r\nthat we can scarcely admit the above explanation.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the peach have largely increased in number since the\r\nChristian era, when from two to five varieties were known (10/56. Dr. A.\r\nTargioni-Tozzetti 'Journal Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 167. Alph. de Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 885.) and the nectarine was unknown. At the present\r\ntime, besides many varieties said to exist in China, Downing describes, in\r\nthe United States, seventy-nine native and imported varieties of the peach;\r\nand a few years ago Lindley (10/57. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page\r\n554. See also Carriere 'Description et Class. des Varietes de Pechers.')\r\nenumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine\r\ngrown in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference\r\nbetween the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from distinct\r\nkinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth\r\nand small. Clingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh\r\neither firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also\r\ndiffer in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or\r\nmelters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother\r\nthan in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only in\r\nsize, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped, more\r\nimbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin:\r\nwhereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more\r\ndarkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The leaves are more\r\nor less serrated, and are either destitute of glands, or have globose or\r\nreniform glands (10/58. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 907.) and\r\nsome few peaches, such as the Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular\r\nand kidney-shaped glands. (10/59. M. Carriere in 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1865 page 1154.) According to Robertson (10/60. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 3 page 332. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 271 to same\r\neffect. Also 'Journal of Horticulture' September 26, 1865 page 254.) the\r\ntrees with glandular leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great\r\ndegree to mildew; whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl,\r\nto mildew, and to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the\r\nperiod of their maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the\r\nlatter circumstance being especially attended to in the United States.\r\nCertain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses\r\nbetter than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable\r\nof all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the\r\nstone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer.\r\n(10/61. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 512.) Another Chinese variety,\r\ncalled the Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long\r\nsharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate. (10/62. 'Journal\r\nof Horticulture' September 8, 1853 page 188.) The Emperor of Russia peach\r\nis a third singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the\r\nfruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the\r\nother: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves.\r\n(10/63. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 412.)\r\n\r\nThe peach has also produced in China a small class of trees valued for\r\nornament, namely the double-flowered; of these, five varieties are now\r\nknown in England, varying from pure white, through rose, to intense\r\ncrimson. (10/64. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 page 216.) One of these\r\nvarieties, called the camellia-flowered, bears flowers above 2 1/4 inches\r\nin diameter, whilst those of the fruit-bearing kinds do not at most exceed\r\n1 1/4 inch in diameter. The flowers of the double-flowered peaches have the\r\nsingular property (10/65. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 283.) of\r\nfrequently producing double or treble fruit. Finally, there is good reason\r\nto believe that the peach is an almond profoundly modified; but whatever\r\nits origin may have been, there can be no doubt that it has yielded during\r\nthe last eighteen centuries many varieties, some of them strongly\r\ncharacterised, belonging both to the nectarine and peach form.\r\n\r\nAPRICOT (Prunus armeniaca).\r\n\r\nIt is commonly admitted that this tree is descended from a single species,\r\nnow found wild in the Caucasian region. (10/66. Alph. de Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 879.) On this view the varieties deserve notice,\r\nbecause they illustrate differences supposed by some botanists to be of\r\nspecific value in the almond and plum. The best monograph on the apricot is\r\nby Mr. Thompson (10/67. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' 2nd series volume 1 1835\r\npage 56. See also 'Cat. of Fruit in Garden of Hort. Soc.' 3rd edition\r\n1842.) who describes seventeen varieties. We have seen that peaches and\r\nnectarines vary in a strictly parallel manner; and in the apricot, which\r\nforms a closely allied genus, we again meet with variations analogous to\r\nthose of the peach, as well as to those of the plum. The varieties differ\r\nconsiderably in the shape of their leaves, which are either serrated or\r\ncrenated, sometimes with ear-like appendages at their bases, and sometimes\r\nwith glands on the petioles. The flowers are generally alike, but are small\r\nin the Masculine. The fruit varies much in size, shape, and in having the\r\nsuture little pronounced or absent; in the skin being smooth, or downy, as\r\nin the orange-apricot; and in the flesh clinging to the stone, as in the\r\nlast-mentioned kind, or in readily separating from it, as in the Turkey-\r\napricot. In all these differences we see the closest analogy with the\r\nvarieties of the peach and nectarine. In the stone we have more important\r\ndifferences, and these in the case of the plum have been esteemed of\r\nspecific value: in some apricots the stone is almost spherical, in others\r\nmuch flattened, being either sharp in front or blunt at both ends,\r\nsometimes channelled along the back, or with a sharp ridge along both\r\nmargins. In the Moorpark, and generally in the Hemskirke, the stone\r\npresents a singular character in being perforated, with a bundle of fibres\r\npassing through the perforation from end to end. The most constant and\r\nimportant character, according to Thompson, is whether the kernel is bitter\r\nor sweet: yet in this respect we have a graduated difference, for the\r\nkernel is very bitter in Shipley's apricot; in the Hemskirke less bitter\r\nthan in some other kinds; slightly bitter in the Royal; and \"sweet like a\r\nhazel-nut\" in the Breda, Angoumois, and others. In the case of the almond,\r\nbitterness has been thought by some high authorities to indicate specific\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIn N. America the Roman apricot endures \"cold and unfavourable situations,\r\nwhere no other sort, except the Masculine, will succeed; and its blossoms\r\nbear quite a severe frost without injury.\" (10/68. Downing 'The Fruits of\r\nAmerica' 1845 page 157: with respect to the Alberge apricot in France see\r\npage 153.) According to Mr. Rivers (10/69. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page\r\n364.), seedling apricots deviate but little from the character of their\r\nrace: in France the Alberge is constantly reproduced from seed with but\r\nlittle variation. In Ladakh, according to Moorcroft (10/70. 'Travels in the\r\nHimalayan Provinces' volume 1 1841 page 295.) ten varieties of the apricot,\r\nvery different from each other, are cultivated, and all are raised from\r\nseed, excepting one, which is budded.\r\n\r\nPLUMS (Prunus insititia).\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 43. PLUM STONES, of natural size, viewed laterally. 1. Bullace\r\nPlum. 2. Shropshire Damson. 3. Blue Gage. 4. Orleans. 5. Elvas. 6. Denyers\r\nVictoria. 7. Diamond.)\r\n\r\nFormerly the sloe, P. spinosa, was thought to be the parent of all our\r\nplums; but now this honour is very commonly accorded to P. insititia or the\r\nbullace, which is found wild in the Caucasus and N.-Western India, and is\r\nnaturalised in England. (10/71. See an excellent discussion on this subject\r\nin Hewett C. Watson 'Cybele Britannica' volume 4 page 80.) It is not at all\r\nimprobable, in accordance with some observations made by Mr. Rivers (10/72.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 27.), that both these forms, which some\r\nbotanists rank as a single species, may be the parents of our domesticated\r\nplums. Another supposed parent-form, the P. domestica, is said to be found\r\nwild in the region of the Caucasus. Godron remarks (10/73. 'De l'Espece'\r\ntome 2 page 94. On the parentage of our plums see also Alph. De Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 878. Also Targioni-Tozzetti 'Journal Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 9 page 164. Also Babington 'Manual of Brit. Botany' 1851 page 87.)\r\nthat the cultivated varieties may be divided into two main groups, which he\r\nsupposes to be descended from two aboriginal stocks; namely, those with\r\noblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends, having narrow separate petals\r\nand upright branches; and those with rounded fruit, with stones blunt at\r\nboth ends, with rounded petals and spreading branches. From what we know of\r\nthe variability of the flowers in the peach and of the diversified manner\r\nof growth in our various fruit-trees, it is difficult to lay much weight on\r\nthese latter characters. With respect to the shape of the fruit, we have\r\nconclusive evidence that it is extremely variable: Downing (10/74. 'Fruits\r\nof America' pages 276, 278, 284, 310, 314. Mr. Rivers raised ('Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1863 page 27) from the Prune-peche, which bears large, round,\r\nred plums on stout, robust shoots, a seedling which bears oval, smaller\r\nfruit on shoots that are so slender as to be almost pendulous.) gives\r\noutlines of the plums of two seedlings, namely, the red and imperial gages,\r\nraised from the greengage; and the fruit of both is more elongated than\r\nthat of the greengage. The latter has a very blunt broad stone, whereas the\r\nstone of the imperial gage is \"oval and pointed at both ends.\" These trees\r\nalso differ in their manner of growth: \"the greengage is a very short-\r\njointed, slow-growing tree, of spreading and rather dwarfish habit;\" whilst\r\nits offspring, the imperial gage, \"grows freely and rises rapidly, and has\r\nlong dark shoots.\" The famous Washington plum bears a globular fruit, but\r\nits offspring, the emerald drop, is nearly as much elongated as the most\r\nelongated plum figured by Downing, namely, Manning's prune. I have made a\r\nsmall collection of the stones of twenty-five kinds, and they graduate in\r\nshape from the bluntest into the sharpest kinds. As characters derived from\r\nseeds are generally of high systematic importance, I have thought it worth\r\nwhile to give drawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection;\r\nand they may be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size, outline,\r\nthickness, prominence of the ridges, and state of surface. It deserves\r\nnotice that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated with\r\nthat of the fruit: thus the Washington plum is spherical and depressed at\r\nthe pole, with a somewhat elongated stone, whilst the fruit of the Goliath\r\nis more elongated, but the stone less so, than in the Washington. Again,\r\nDenyer's Victoria and Goliath bear fruit closely resembling each other, but\r\ntheir stones are widely different. On the other hand, the Harvest and Black\r\nMargate plums are very dissimilar, yet include closely similar stones.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the plum are numerous, and differ greatly in size, shape,\r\nquality, and colour,--being bright yellow, green, almost white, blue,\r\npurple, or red. There are some curious varieties, such as the double or\r\nSiamese, and the Stoneless plum: in the latter the kernel lies in a roomy\r\ncavity surrounded only by the pulp. The climate of North America appears to\r\nbe singularly favourable for the production of new and good varieties;\r\nDowning describes no less than forty, of which seven of first-rate quality\r\nhave been recently introduced into England. (10/75. 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1855 page 726.) Varieties occasionally arise having an innate adaptation\r\nfor certain soils, almost as strongly pronounced as with natural species\r\ngrowing on the most distinct geological formations; thus in America the\r\nimperial gage, differently from almost all other kinds, \"is peculiarly\r\nfitted for DRY LIGHT soils where many sorts drop their fruit,\" whereas on\r\nrich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid. (10/76. Downing 'Fruit Trees'\r\npage 278.) My father could never succeed in making the Wine-Sour yield even\r\na moderate crop in a sandy orchard near Shrewsbury, whilst in some parts of\r\nthe same county and in its native Yorkshire it bears abundantly: one of my\r\nrelations also repeatedly tried in vain to grow this variety in a sandy\r\ndistrict in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nMr. Rivers has given (10/77. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 27. Sageret\r\nin his 'Pomologie Phys.' page 346 enumerates five kinds which can be\r\npropagated in France by seed: see also Downing 'Fruit Trees of America'\r\npage 305, 312, etc.) a number of interesting facts, showing how truly many\r\nvarieties can be propagated by seed. He sowed the stones of twenty bushels\r\nof the greengage for the sake of raising stocks, and closely observed the\r\nseedlings; all had the smooth shoots, the prominent buds, and the glossy\r\nleaves of the greengage, but the greater number had smaller leaves and\r\nthorns.\" There are two kinds of damson, one the Shropshire with downy\r\nshoots, and the other the Kentish with smooth shoots, and these differ but\r\nslightly in any other respect: Mr. Rivers sowed some bushels of the Kentish\r\ndamson, and all the seedlings had smooth shoots, but in some the fruit was\r\noval, in others round or roundish, and in a few the fruit was small, and,\r\nexcept in being sweet, closely resembled that of the wild sloe. Mr. Rivers\r\ngives several other striking instances of inheritance: thus, he raised\r\neighty thousand seedlings from the common German Quetsche plum, and \"not\r\none could be found varying in the least, in foliage or habit.\" Similar\r\nfacts were observed with the Petite Mirabelle plum, yet this latter kind\r\n(as well as the Quetsche) is known to have yielded some well-established\r\nvarieties; but, as Mr. Rivers remarks, they all belong to the same group\r\nwith the Mirabelle.\r\n\r\nCHERRIES (Prunus cerasus, avium, etc.).\r\n\r\nBotanists believe that our cultivated cherries are descended from one, two,\r\nfour, or even more wild stocks. (10/78. Compare Alph. De Candolle\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 877. Bentham and Targioni-Tozzetti in 'Hort. Journal'\r\nvolume 9 page 163; Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 92.) That there must be\r\nat least two parent species we may infer from the sterility of twenty\r\nhybrids raised by Mr. Knight from the morello fertilised by pollen of the\r\nElton cherry; for these hybrids produced in all only five cherries, and one\r\nalone of these contained a seed. (10/79. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5\r\n1824 page 295.) Mr. Thompson (10/80. Ibid second series volume 1 1835 page\r\n248.) has classified the varieties in an apparently natural method in two\r\nmain groups by characters taken from the flowers, fruit, and leaves; but\r\nsome varieties which stand widely separate in this classification are quite\r\nfertile when crossed; thus Knight's Early Black cherries are the product of\r\na cross between two such kinds.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight states that seedling cherries are more variable than those of\r\nany other fruit-tree. (10/81. ) In the Catalogue of the Horticultural\r\nSociety for 1842 eighty varieties are enumerated. Some varieties present\r\nsingular characters: thus, the flower of the Cluster cherry includes as\r\nmany as twelve pistils, of which the majority abort; and they are said\r\ngenerally to produce from two to five or six cherries aggregated together\r\nand borne on a single peduncle. In the Ratafia cherry several flower-\r\npeduncles arise from a common peduncle, upwards of an inch in length. The\r\nfruit of Gascoigne's Heart has its apex produced into a globule or drop;\r\nthat of the white Hungarian Gean has almost transparent flesh. The Flemish\r\ncherry is \"a very odd-looking fruit,\" much flattened at the summit and\r\nbase, with the latter deeply furrowed, and borne on a stout, very short\r\nfootstalk. In the Kentish cherry the stone adheres so firmly to the\r\nfootstalk, that it could be drawn out of the flesh; and this renders the\r\nfruit well fitted for drying. The Tobacco-leaved cherry, according to\r\nSageret and Thompson, produces gigantic leaves, more than a foot and\r\nsometimes even eighteen inches in length, and half a foot in breadth. The\r\nweeping cherry, on the other hand, is valuable only as an ornament, and,\r\naccording to Downing, is \"a charming little tree, with slender, weeping\r\nbranches, clothed with small, almost myrtle-like foliage.\" There is also a\r\npeach-leaved variety.\r\n\r\nSageret describes a remarkable variety, LE GRIOTTIER DE LA TOUSSAINT, which\r\nbears at the same time, even as late as September, flowers and fruit of all\r\ndegrees of maturity. The fruit, which is of inferior quality, is borne on\r\nlong, very thin footstalks. But the extraordinary statement is made that\r\nall the leaf-bearing shoots spring from old flower-buds. Lastly, there is\r\nan important physiological distinction between those kinds of cherries\r\nwhich bear fruit on young or on old wood; but Sageret positively asserts\r\nthat a Bigarreau in his garden bore fruit on wood of both ages. (10/82.\r\nThese several statements are taken from the four following works, which\r\nmay, I believe, be trusted: Thompson in 'Hort. Transact.' see above;\r\nSageret 'Pomologie Phys.' 1830 pages 358, 364, 367, 379; 'Catalogue of the\r\nFruit in the Garden of Hort. Soc.' 1842 pages 57, 60; Downing 'The Fruits\r\nof America' 1845 pages 189, 195, 200.)\r\n\r\nAPPLE (Pyrus malus).\r\n\r\nThe one source of doubt felt by botanists with respect to the parentage of\r\nthe apple is whether, besides P. malus, two or three other closely allied\r\nwild forms, namely, P. acerba and praecox or paradisiaca, do not deserve to\r\nbe ranked as distinct species. The P. praecox is supposed by some authors\r\n(10/83. Mr. Lowe states in his 'Flora of Madeira' quoted in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1862 page 215 that the P. malus, with its nearly sessile fruit,\r\nranges farther south than the long-stalked P. acerba, which is entirely\r\nabsent in Madeira, the Canaries, and apparently in Portugal. This fact\r\nsupports the belief that these two forms deserve to be called species. But\r\nthe characters separating them are of slight importance, and of a kind\r\nknown to vary in other cultivated fruit-trees.) to be the parent of the\r\ndwarf paradise stock, which, owing to the fibrous roots not penetrating\r\ndeeply into the ground, is so largely used for grafting; but the paradise\r\nstocks, it is asserted (10/84. See 'Journ. of Hort. Tour, by Deputation of\r\nthe Caledonian Hort. Soc.' 1823 page 459.) cannot be propagated true by\r\nseed. The common wild crab varies considerably in England; but many of the\r\nvarieties are believed to be escaped seedlings. (10/85. H.C. Watson 'Cybele\r\nBritannica' volume 1 page 334.) Every one knows the great difference in the\r\nmanner of growth, in the foliage, flowers, and especially in the fruit,\r\nbetween the almost innumerable varieties of the apple. The pips or seeds\r\n(as I know by comparison) likewise differ considerably in shape, size, and\r\ncolour. The fruit is adapted for eating or for cooking in various ways, and\r\nkeeps for only a few weeks or for nearly two years. Some few kinds have the\r\nfruit covered with a powdery secretion, called bloom, like that on plums;\r\nand \"it is extremely remarkable that this occurs almost exclusively among\r\nvarieties cultivated in Russia.\" (10/86. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume\r\n6 1830 page 83.) Another Russian apple, the white Astracan, possesses the\r\nsingular property of becoming transparent, when ripe, like some sorts of\r\ncrabs. The API ETOILE has five prominent ridges, hence its name; the API\r\nNOIR is nearly black: the TWIN CLUSTER PIPPIN often bears fruit joined in\r\npairs. (10/87. See 'Catalogue of Fruit in Garden of Hort. Soc.' 1842 and\r\nDowning 'American Fruit Trees.') The trees of the several sorts differ\r\ngreatly in their periods of leafing and flowering; in my orchard the COURT\r\nPENDU PLAT produces leaves so late, that during several springs I thought\r\nthat it was dead. The Tiffin apple scarcely bears a leaf when in full\r\nbloom; the Cornish crab, on the other hand, bears so many leaves at this\r\nperiod that the flowers can hardly be seen. (10/88. Loudon's Gardener's\r\nMagazine' volume 4 1828 page 112.) In some kinds the fruit ripens in mid-\r\nsummer; in others, late in the autumn. These several differences in\r\nleafing, flowering, and fruiting, are not at all necessarily correlated;\r\nfor, as Andrew Knight has remarked (10/89. 'The Culture of the Apple' page\r\n43. Van Mons makes the same remark on the pear 'Arbres Fruitiers' tome 2\r\n1836 page 414.), no one can judge from the early flowering of a new\r\nseedling, or from the early shedding or change of colour of the leaves,\r\nwhether it will mature its fruit early in the season.\r\n\r\nThe varieties differ greatly in constitution. It is notorious that our\r\nsummers are not hot enough for the Newtown Pippin (10/90. Lindley's\r\n'Horticulture' page 116. See also Knight on the Apple-Tree, in 'Transact.\r\nof Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 229.), which is the glory of the orchards near\r\nNew York; and so it is with several varieties which we have imported from\r\nthe Continent. On the other hand, our Court of Wick succeeds well under the\r\nsevere climate of Canada. The Caville rouge de Micoud occasionally bears\r\ntwo crops during the same year. The Burr Knot is covered with small\r\nexcrescences, which emit roots so readily that a branch with blossom-buds\r\nmay be stuck in the ground, and will root and bear a few fruit even during\r\nthe first year. (10/91. Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 1812 page 120.) Mr.\r\nRivers has recently described (10/92. 'Journal of Horticulture' March 13,\r\n1866 page 194.) some seedlings valuable from their roots running near the\r\nsurface. One of these seedlings was remarkable from its extremely dwarfed\r\nsize, \"forming itself into a bush only a few inches in height.\" Many\r\nvarieties are particularly liable to canker in certain soils. But perhaps\r\nthe strangest constitutional peculiarity is that the Winter Majetin is not\r\nattacked by the mealy bug or coccus; Lindley (10/93. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 4 page 68. For Knight's case see volume 6 page 547. When the coccus\r\nfirst appeared in this country it is said (volume 2 page 163) that it was\r\nmore injurious to crab-stocks than to the apples grafted on them. The\r\nMajetin apple has been found equally free of the coccus at Melbourne in\r\nAustralia ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1871 page 1065). The wood of this tree\r\nhas been there analysed, and it is said (but the fact seems a strange one)\r\nthat its ash contained over 50 per cent of lime, while that of the crab\r\nexhibited not quite 23 per cent. In Tasmania Mr. Wade ('Transact. New\r\nZealand Institute' volume 4 1871 page 431) raised seedlings of the Siberian\r\nBitter Sweet for stocks, and he found barely one per cent of them attacked\r\nby the coccus. Riley shows ('Fifth Report on Insects of Missouri' 1873 page\r\n87) that in the United States some varieties of apples are highly\r\nattractive to the coccus and others very little so. Turning to a very\r\ndifferent pest, namely, the caterpillar of a moth (Carpocapsa pomonella),\r\nWalsh affirms ('The American Entomologist' April 1869 page 160) that the\r\nmaiden-blush \"is entirely exempt from apple-worms.\" So, it is said, are\r\nsome few other varieties; whereas others are \"peculiarly subject to the\r\nattacks of this little pest.\") states that in an orchard in Norfolk\r\ninfested with these insects the Majetin was quite free, though the stock on\r\nwhich it was grafted was affected: Knight makes a similar statement with\r\nrespect to a cider apple, and adds that he only once saw these insects just\r\nabove the stock, but that three days afterwards they entirely disappeared;\r\nthis apple, however, was raised from a cross between the Golden Harvey and\r\nthe Siberian Crab; and the latter, I believe, is considered by some authors\r\nas specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nThe famous St. Valery apple must not be passed over; the flower has a\r\ndouble calyx with ten divisions, and fourteen styles surmounted by\r\nconspicuous oblique stigmas, but is destitute of stamens or corolla. The\r\nfruit is constricted round the middle, and is formed of five seed-cells,\r\nsurmounted by nine other cells. (10/94. 'Mem. de La Soc. Linn. de Paris'\r\ntome 3 1825 page 164; and Seringe 'Bulletin Bot.' 1830 page 117.) Not being\r\nprovided with stamens, the tree requires artificial fertilisation; and the\r\ngirls of St. Valery annually go to \"faire ses pommes,\" each marking her own\r\nfruit with a ribbon; and as different pollen is used the fruit differs, and\r\nwe here have an instance of the direct action of foreign pollen on the\r\nmother plant. These monstrous apples include, as we have seen, fourteen\r\nseed-cells; the pigeon-apple (10/95. Gardener's Chronicle' 1849 page 24.)\r\non the other hand, has only four, instead of, as with all common apples,\r\nfive cells; and this certainly is a remarkable difference.\r\n\r\nIn the catalogue of apples published in 1842 by the Horticultural Society,\r\n897 varieties are enumerated; but the differences between most of them are\r\nof comparatively little interest, as they are not strictly inherited. No\r\none can raise, for instance, from the seed of the Ribston Pippin, a tree of\r\nthe same kind; and it is said that the \"Sister Ribston Pippin\" was a white\r\nsemi-transparent, sour-fleshed apple, or rather large crab. (10/96. R.\r\nThompson, in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 page 788.) Yet it was a mistake to\r\nsuppose that with most varieties the characters are not to a certain extent\r\ninherited. In two lots of seedlings raised from two well-marked kinds, many\r\nworthless crab-like seedlings will appear, but it is now known that the two\r\nlots not only usually differ from each other, but resemble to a certain\r\nextent their parents. We see this indeed in the several sub-groups of\r\nRussetts, Sweetings, Codlins, Pearmains, Reinettes, etc. (10/97. Sageret\r\n'Pomologie Physiologique' 1830 page 263. Downing 'Fruit Trees' pages 130,\r\n134, 139, etc. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 p. 317. Alexis Jordan\r\n'De l'Origine des diverses Varietes' in 'Mem. de l'Acad. Imp. de Lyon' tome\r\n2 1852 pages 95, 114. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 pages 774, 788.), which\r\nare all believed, and many are known, to be descended from other varieties\r\nbearing the same names.\r\n\r\nPEARS (Pyrus communis).\r\n\r\nI need say little on this fruit, which varies much in the wild state, and\r\nto an extraordinary degree when cultivated, in its fruit, flowers, and\r\nfoliage. One of the most celebrated botanists in Europe, M. Decaisne, has\r\ncarefully studied the many varieties (10/98. 'Comptes Rendus' July 6,\r\n1863.); although he formerly believed that they were derived from more than\r\none species, he now thinks that all belong to one. He has arrived at this\r\nconclusion from finding in the several varieties a perfect gradation\r\nbetween the most extreme characters; so perfect is this gradation that he\r\nmaintains it to be impossible to classify the varieties by any natural\r\nmethod. M. Decaisne raised many seedlings from four distinct kinds, and has\r\ncarefully recorded the variations in each. Notwithstanding this extreme\r\ndegree of variability, it is now positively known that many kinds reproduce\r\nby seed the leading characters of their race. (10/99. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1856 page 804; 1857 page 820; 1862 page 1195.)\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES (Fragaria).\r\n\r\nThis fruit is remarkable on account of the number of species which have\r\nbeen cultivated, and from their rapid improvement within the last fifty or\r\nsixty years. Let any one compare the fruit of one of the largest varieties\r\nexhibited at our Shows with that of the wild wood strawberry, or, which\r\nwill be a fairer comparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild\r\nAmerican Virginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies horticulture\r\nhas effected. (10/100. Most of the largest cultivated strawberries are the\r\ndescendants of F. grandiflora or chiloensis, and I have seen no account of\r\nthese forms in their wild state. Methuen's Scarlet (Downing 'Fruits' page\r\n527) has \"immense fruit of the largest size,\" and belongs to the section\r\ndescended from F. virginiana; and the fruit of this species, as I hear from\r\nProf. A. Gray, is only a little larger than that of F. vesca, or our common\r\nwood-strawberry.) The number of varieties has likewise increased in a\r\nsurprisingly rapid manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in 1746,\r\nwhere this fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had been\r\nintroduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five varieties of\r\nFragaria vesca, with some sub-varieties, had been produced. At the present\r\nday the varieties of the several species are almost innumerable. The\r\nspecies consist of, firstly, the wood or Alpine cultivated strawberries,\r\ndescended from F. vesca, a native of Europe and of North America. There are\r\neight wild European varieties, as ranked by Duchesne, of F. vesca, but\r\nseveral of these are considered species by some botanists. Secondly, the\r\ngreen strawberries, descended from the European F. collina, and little\r\ncultivated in England. Thirdly, the Hautbois, from the European F. elatior.\r\nFourthly, the Scarlets, descended from F. virginiana, a native of the whole\r\nbreadth of North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from F. chiloensis,\r\nan inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of North and\r\nSouth America. Lastly, the pines or Carolinas (including the old Blacks),\r\nwhich have been ranked by most authors under the name of F. grandiflora as\r\na distinct species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this is a manifest error.\r\nThis form is considered by the highest authority, M. Gay, to be merely a\r\nstrongly marked race of F. chiloensis. (10/101. 'Le Fraisier' par le Comte\r\nL. de Lambertye 1864 page 50.) These five or six forms have been ranked by\r\nmost botanists as specifically distinct; but this may be doubted, for\r\nAndrew Knight (10/102. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 1820 page 207.) who\r\nraised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the F.\r\nvirginiana, chiloensis and grandiflora \"may be made to breed together\r\nindiscriminately,\" and he found, in accordance with the principle of\r\nanalogous variation, \"that similar varieties could be obtained from the\r\nseeds of any one of them.\"\r\n\r\nSince Knight's time there is abundant and additional evidence (10/103. See\r\nan account by Prof. Decaisne, and by others in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862\r\npage 335 and 1858 page 172; and Mr. Barnet's paper in 'Hort. Soc.\r\nTransact.' volume 6 1826 page 170.) of the extent to which the American\r\nforms spontaneously cross. We owe indeed to such crosses most of our\r\nchoicest existing varieties. Knight did not succeed in crossing the\r\nEuropean wood-strawberry with the American Scarlet or with the Hautbois.\r\nMr. Williams of Pitmaston, however, succeeded; but the hybrid offspring\r\nfrom the Hautbois, though fruiting well, never produced seed, with the\r\nexception of a single one, which reproduced the parent hybrid form.\r\n(10/104. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 1824 page 294.) Major R. Trevor\r\nClarke informs me that he crossed two members of the Pine class (Myatt's B.\r\nQueen and Keen's Seedling) with the wood and hautbois, and that in each\r\ncase he raised only a single seedling; one of these fruited, but was almost\r\nbarren. Mr. W. Smith, of York, has raised similar hybrids with equally poor\r\nsuccess. (10/105. 'Journal of Horticulture' December 30, 1862 page 779. See\r\nalso Mr. Prince to the same effect ibid 1863 page 418.) We thus see\r\n(10/106. For additional evidence see 'Journal of Horticulture' December 9,\r\n1862 page 721.) that the European and American species can with some\r\ndifficulty be crossed; but it is improbable that hybrids sufficiently\r\nfertile to be worth cultivation will ever be thus produced. This fact is\r\nsurprising, as these forms structurally are not widely distinct, and are\r\nsometimes connected in the districts where they grow wild, as I hear from\r\nProfessor Asa Gray, by puzzling intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThe energetic culture of the Strawberry is of recent date, and the\r\ncultivated varieties can in most cases be classed under some one of the\r\nabove native stocks. As the American strawberries cross so freely and\r\nspontaneously, we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately become\r\ninextricably confused. We find, indeed, that horticulturists at present\r\ndisagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties; and a writer\r\nin the 'Bon Jardinier' of 1840 remarks that formerly it was possible to\r\nclass all of them under some one species, but that now this is quite\r\nimpossible with the American forms, the new English varieties having\r\ncompletely filled up the gaps between them. (10/107. 'Le Fraisier' par le\r\nComte L. de Lambertye pages 221, 230.) The blending together of two or more\r\naboriginal forms, which there is every reason to believe has occurred with\r\nsome of our anciently cultivated productions, we see now actually occurring\r\nwith our strawberries.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated species offer some variations worth notice. The Black\r\nPrince, a seedling from Keen's Imperial (this latter being a seedling of a\r\nvery white strawberry, the white Carolina), is remarkable from \"its\r\npeculiar dark and polished surface, and from presenting an appearance\r\nentirely unlike that of any other kind.\" (10/108. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 6 page 200.) Although the fruit in the different varieties differs\r\nso greatly in form, size, colour, and quality, the so-called seed (which\r\ncorresponds with the whole fruit in the plum) with the exception of being\r\nmore or less deeply embedded in the pulp, is, according to De Jonghe\r\n(10/109. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1858 page 173.) absolutely the same in all:\r\nand this no doubt may be accounted for by the seed being of no value, and\r\nconsequently not having been subjected to selection. The strawberry is\r\nproperly three-leaved, but in 1761 Duchesne raised a single-leaved variety\r\nof the European wood-strawberry, which Linnaeus doubtfully raised to the\r\nrank of a species. Seedlings of this variety, like those of most varieties\r\nnot fixed by long-continued selection, often revert to the ordinary form,\r\nor present intermediate states. (10/110. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page\r\n161.) A variety raised by Mr. Myatt (10/111. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1851\r\npage 440.), apparently belonging to one of the American forms presents a\r\nvariation of an opposite nature, for it has five leaves; Godron and\r\nLambertye also mention a five-leaved variety of F. collina.\r\n\r\nThe Red Bush Alpine strawberry (one of the F. vesca section) does not\r\nproduce stolons or runners, and this remarkable deviation of structure is\r\nreproduced truly by seed. Another sub-variety, the White Bush Alpine, is\r\nsimilarly characterised, but when propagated by seed it often degenerates\r\nand produces plants with runners. (10/112. F. Gloede in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1862 page 1053.) A strawberry of the American Pine section is\r\nalso said to make but few runners. (10/113. Downing 'Fruits' page 532.)\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the sexes of strawberries; the true Hautbois\r\nproperly bears the male and female organs on separate plants (10/114.\r\nBarnet in 'Hort. Transact.' volume 6 page 210.), and was consequently named\r\nby Duchesne dioica; but it frequently produces hermaphrodites; and Lindley\r\n(10/115. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1847 page 539.), by propagating such plants\r\nby runners, at the same time destroying the males, soon raised a self-\r\nprolific stock. The other species often showed a tendency towards an\r\nimperfect separation of the sexes, as I have noticed with plants forced in\r\na hot-house. Several English varieties, which in this country are free from\r\nany such tendency, when cultivated in rich soils under the climate of North\r\nAmerica (10/116. For the several statements with respect to the American\r\nstrawberries see Downing 'Fruits' page 524; 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843\r\npage 188; 1847 page 539; 1861 page 717.) commonly produce plants with\r\nseparate sexes. Thus a whole acre of Keen's Seedlings in the United States\r\nhas been observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male flowers;\r\nbut the more general rule is, that the male plants overrun the females.\r\nSome members of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, especially appointed\r\nto investigate this subject, report that \"few varieties have the flowers\r\nperfect in both sexual organs,\" etc. The most successful cultivators in\r\nOhio plant for every seven rows of \"pistillata,\" or female plants, one row\r\nof hermaphrodites, which afford pollen for both kinds; but the\r\nhermaphrodites, owing to their expenditure in the production of pollen,\r\nbear less fruit than the female plants.\r\n\r\nThe varieties differ in constitution. Some of our best English kinds, such\r\nas Keen's Seedlings, are too tender for certain parts of North America,\r\nwhere other English and many American varieties succeed perfectly. That\r\nsplendid fruit, the British Queen, can be cultivated but in few places\r\neither in England or France: but this apparently depends more on the nature\r\nof the soil than on the climate; a famous gardener says that \"no mortal\r\ncould grow the British Queen at Shrubland Park unless the whole nature of\r\nthe soil was altered.\" (10/117. Mr. D. Beaton in 'Cottage Gardener' 1860\r\npage 86. See also 'Cottage Gardener' 1855 page 88 and many other\r\nauthorities. For the Continent see F. Gloede in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862\r\npage 1053.) La Constantine is one of the hardiest kinds, and can withstand\r\nRussian winters, but it is easily burnt by the sun, so that it will not\r\nsucceed in certain soils either in England or the United States. (10/118.\r\nRev. W.F. Radclyffe in 'Journal of Hort.' March 14, 1865 page 207.) The\r\nFilbert Pine Strawberry \"requires more water than any other variety; and if\r\nthe plants once suffer from drought, they will do little or no good\r\nafterwards.\" (10/119. Mr. H. Doubleday in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page\r\n1101.) Cuthill's Black Prince Strawberry evinces a singular tendency to\r\nmildew; no less than six cases have been recorded of this variety suffering\r\nseverely, whilst other varieties growing close by, and treated in exactly\r\nthe same manner, were not at all infested by this fungus. (10/120.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1854 page 254.) The time of maturity differs much in\r\nthe different varieties: some belonging to the wood or alpine section\r\nproduce a succession of crops throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY (Ribes grossularia).\r\n\r\nNo one, I believe, has hitherto doubted that all the cultivated kinds are\r\nsprung from the wild plant bearing this name, which is common in Central\r\nand Northern Europe; therefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all\r\nthe points, though not very important, which have varied. If it be admitted\r\nthat these differences are due to culture, authors perhaps will not be so\r\nready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown wild parent-\r\nstocks for our other cultivated plants. The gooseberry is not alluded to by\r\nwriters of the classical period. Turner mentions it in 1573, and Parkinson\r\nspecifies eight varieties in 1629; the Catalogue of the Horticultural\r\nSociety for 1842 gives 149 varieties, and the lists of the Lancashire\r\nnurserymen are said to include above 300 names. (10/121. Loudon's\r\n'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 930; and Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.'\r\npage 910.) In the 'Gooseberry Grower's Register' for 1862 I find that 243\r\ndistinct varieties have won prizes at various periods, so that a vast\r\nnumber must have been exhibited. No doubt the difference between many of\r\nthe varieties is very small; but Mr. Thompson in classifying the fruit for\r\nthe Horticultural Society found less confusion in the nomenclature of the\r\ngooseberry than of any other fruit, and he attributes this \"to the great\r\ninterest which the prize-growers have taken in detecting sorts with wrong\r\nnames,\" and this shows that all the kinds, numerous as they are, can be\r\nrecognised with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe bushes differ in their manner of growth, being erect, or spreading, or\r\npendulous. The periods of leafing and flowering differ both absolutely and\r\nrelatively to each other; thus the Whitesmith produces early flowers, which\r\nfrom not being protected by the foliage, as it is believed, continually\r\nfail to produce fruit. (10/122. Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 4\r\n1828 page 112.) The leaves vary in size, tint, and in depth of lobes; they\r\nare smooth, downy, or hairy on the upper surface. The branches are more or\r\nless downy or spinose; \"the Hedgehog has probably derived its name from the\r\nsingular bristly condition of its shoots and fruit.\" The branches of the\r\nwild gooseberry, I may remark, are smooth, with the exception of thorns at\r\nthe bases of the buds. The thorns themselves are either very small, few and\r\nsingle, or very large and triple; they are sometimes reflexed and much\r\ndilated at their bases. In the different varieties the fruit varies in\r\nabundance, in the period of maturity, in hanging until shrivelled, and\r\ngreatly in size, \"some sorts having their fruit large during a very early\r\nperiod of growth, whilst others are small, until nearly ripe.\" The fruit\r\nvaries also much in colour, being red, yellow, green, and white--the pulp\r\nof one dark-red gooseberry being tinged with yellow; in flavour; in being\r\nsmooth or downy,--few, however, of the Red gooseberries, whilst many of the\r\nso-called Whites, are downy; or in being so spinose that one kind is called\r\nHenderson's Porcupine. Two kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on\r\ntheir fruit. The fruit varies in the thickness and veining of the skin,\r\nand, lastly, in shape, being spherical, oblong, oval, or obovate. (10/123.\r\nThe fullest account of the gooseberry is given by Mr. Thompson in\r\n'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 2nd series 1835 page 218 from which most of\r\nthe foregoing facts are taken.)\r\n\r\nI cultivated fifty-four varieties, and, considering how greatly the fruit\r\ndiffers, it was curious how closely similar the flowers were in all these\r\nkinds. In only a few I detected a trace of difference in the size or colour\r\nof the corolla. The calyx differed in a rather greater degree, for in some\r\nkinds it was much redder than in others; and in one smooth white gooseberry\r\nit was unusually red. The calyx also differed in the basal part being\r\nsmooth or woolly, or covered with glandular hairs. It deserves notice, as\r\nbeing contrary to what might have been expected from the law of\r\ncorrelation, that a smooth red gooseberry had a remarkably hairy calyx. The\r\nflowers of the Sportsman are furnished with very large coloured bracteae;\r\nand this is the most singular deviation of structure which I have observed.\r\nThese same flowers also varied much in the number of the petals, and\r\noccasionally in the number of the stamens and pistils; so that they were\r\nsemi-monstrous in structure, yet they produced plenty of fruit. Mr.\r\nThompson remarks that in the Pastime gooseberry \"extra bracts are often\r\nattached to the sides of the fruit.\" (10/124. 'Catalogue of Fruits of Hort.\r\nSoc. Garden' 3rd edition 1842.)\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point in the history of the gooseberry is the steady\r\nincrease in the size of the fruit. Manchester is the metropolis of the\r\nfanciers, and prizes from five shillings to five or ten pounds are yearly\r\ngiven for the heaviest fruit. The 'Gooseberry Growers Register' is\r\npublished annually; the earliest known copy is dated 1786, but it is\r\ncertain that meetings for the adjudication of prizes were held some years\r\npreviously. (10/125. Mr. Clarkson of Manchester on the Culture of the\r\nGooseberry in Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 4 1828 page 482.) The\r\n'Register' for 1845 gives an account of 171 Gooseberry Shows, held in\r\ndifferent places during that year; and this fact shows on how large a scale\r\nthe culture has been carried on. The fruit of the wild gooseberry is said\r\n(10/126. Downing 'Fruits of America' page 213.) to weigh about a quarter of\r\nan ounce or 5 dwts., that is, 120 grains; about the year 1786 gooseberries\r\nwere exhibited weighing 10 dwts., so that the weight was then doubled; in\r\n1817 26 dwts. 17 grs. was attained; there was no advance till 1825, when 31\r\ndwts. 16 grs. was reached; in 1830 \"Teazer\" weighed 32 dwts. 13 grs.; in\r\n1841 \"Wonderful\" weighed 32 dwts. 16 grs.; in 1844 \"London\" weighed 35\r\ndwts. 12 grs., and in the following year 36 dwts. 16 grs.; and in 1852 in\r\nStaffordshire, the fruit of the same variety reached the astonishing weight\r\nof 37 dwts. 7 grs. (10/127. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 811 where a\r\ntable is given; and 1845 page 819. For the extreme weights gained see\r\n'Journal of Horticulture' July 26, 1864 page 61.) or 896 grs.; that is,\r\nbetween seven or eight times the weight of the wild fruit. I find that a\r\nsmall apple, 6 1/2 inches in circumference, has exactly this same weight.\r\nThe \"London\" gooseberry (which in 1852 had altogether gained 333 prizes)\r\nhas, up to the present year of 1875, never reached a greater weight than\r\nthat attained in 1852. Perhaps the fruit of the gooseberry has now reached\r\nthe greatest possible weight, unless in the course of time some new and\r\ndistinct variety shall arise.\r\n\r\nThis gradual, and on the whole steady increase of weight from the latter\r\npart of the last century to the year 1852, is probably in large part due to\r\nimproved methods of cultivation, for extreme care is now taken; the\r\nbranches and roots are trained, composts are made, the soil is mulched, and\r\nonly a few berries are left on each bush (10/128. Mr. Saul of Lancaster in\r\nLoudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 3 1828 page 421; and volume 10 1834 page\r\n42.) but the increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued\r\nselection of seedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of\r\nyielding such extraordinary fruit. Assuredly the \"Highwayman\" in 1817 could\r\nnot have produced fruit like that of the \"Roaring Lion\" in 1825; nor could\r\nthe \"Roaring Lion,\" though it was grown by many persons in many places,\r\ngain the supreme triumph achieved in 1852 by the \"London\" Gooseberry.\r\n\r\nWALNUT (Juglans regia).\r\n\r\nThis tree and the common nut belong to a widely different order from the\r\nforegoing fruits, and are therefore here noticed. The walnut grows wild on\r\nthe Caucasus and in the Himalaya, where Dr. Hooker (10/129. 'Himalayan\r\nJournals' 1854 volume 2 page 334. Moorcroft 'Travels' volume 2 page 146\r\ndescribes four varieties cultivated in Kashmir.) found the fruit of full\r\nsize, but \"as hard as a hickory-nut.\" It has been found fossil, as M. de\r\nSaporta informs me, in the tertiary formation, of France.\r\n\r\nIn England the walnut presents considerable differences, in the shape and\r\nsize of the fruit, in the thickness of the husk, and in the thinness of the\r\nshell; this latter quality has given rise to a variety called the thin-\r\nshelled, which is valuable, but suffers from the attacks of titmice.\r\n(10/130. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 page 723.) The degree to which the\r\nkernel fills the shell varies much. In France there is a variety called the\r\nGrape or cluster-walnut, in which the nuts grow in \"bunches of ten,\r\nfifteen, or even twenty together.\" There is another variety which bears on\r\nthe same tree differently shaped leaves, like the heterophyllous hornbeam;\r\nthis tree is also remarkable from having pendulous branches, and bearing\r\nelongated, large, thin-shelled nuts. (10/131. Paper translated in Loudon's\r\n'Gardener's Mag.' 1829 volume 5 page 202.) M. Cardan has minutely described\r\n(10/132. Quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1849 page 101.) some singular\r\nphysiological peculiarities in the June-leafing variety, which produces its\r\nleaves and flowers four or five weeks later than the common varieties; and\r\nalthough in August it is apparently in exactly the same state of\r\nforwardness as the other kinds, it retains its leaves and fruit much later\r\nin the autumn. These constitutional peculiarities are strictly inherited.\r\nLastly, walnut-trees, which are properly monoicous, sometimes entirely fail\r\nto produce male flowers. (10/133. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1847 pages 541 and\r\n558.)\r\n\r\nNUTS (Corylus avellana).\r\n\r\nMost botanists rank all the varieties under the same species, the common\r\nwild nut. (10/134. The following details are taken from the 'Catalogue of\r\nFruits, 1842 in Garden of Hort. Soc.' page 103; and from Loudon's\r\n'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 943.) The husk, or involucre, differs\r\ngreatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish, and extremely long in\r\nfilberts, in which it is contracted so as to prevent the nut falling out.\r\nThis kind of husk also protects the nut from birds, for titmice (Parus)\r\nhave been observed (10/135. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1860 page 956.) to pass\r\nover filberts, and attack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard.\r\nIn the purple-filbert the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert it is\r\ncuriously laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the kernel is red.\r\nThe shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in Cosford's-nut, and in\r\none variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself differs much in size and\r\nshape, being ovate and compressed in filberts, nearly round and of great\r\nsize in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and longitudinally striated in\r\nCosford's, and obtusely four-sided in the Downton Square nut.\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEOUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThese plants have been for a long period the opprobrium of botanists;\r\nnumerous varieties have been ranked as species, and, what happens more\r\nrarely, forms which now must be considered as species have been classed as\r\nvarieties. Owing to the admirable experimental researches of a\r\ndistinguished botanist, M. Naudin (10/136. 'Annales des Sc. Nat. Bot.' 4th\r\nseries volume 6 1856 page 5.), a flood of light has recently been thrown on\r\nthis group of plants. M. Naudin, during many years, observed and\r\nexperimented on above 1200 living specimens, collected from all quarters of\r\nthe world. Six species are now recognised in the genus Cucurbita; but three\r\nalone have been cultivated and concern us, namely, C. maxima and pepo,\r\nwhich include all pumpkins, gourds, squashes, and the vegetable marrow, and\r\nC. moschata. These three species are not known in a wild state; but Asa\r\nGray (10/137. 'American Journ. of Science' 2nd series volume 24 1857 page\r\n442.) gives good reason for believing that some pumpkins are natives of N.\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThese three species are closely allied, and have the same general habit,\r\nbut their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished, according to\r\nNaudin, by certain almost fixed characters; and what is still more\r\nimportant, when crossed they yield no seed, or only sterile seed; whilst\r\nthe varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost freedom. Naudin\r\ninsists strongly (page 15), that, though these three species have varied\r\ngreatly in many characters, yet it has been in so closely an analogous\r\nmanner that the varieties can he arranged in almost parallel series, as we\r\nhave seen with the forms of wheat, with the two main races of the peach,\r\nand in other cases. Though some of the varieties are inconstant in\r\ncharacter, yet others, when grown separately under uniform conditions of\r\nlife, are, as Naudin repeatedly (pages 6, 16, 35) urges, \"douees d'une\r\nstabilite presque comparable a celle des especes les mieux caracterisees.\"\r\nOne variety, l'Orangin (pages 43, 63), has such prepotency in transmitting\r\nits character, that when crossed with other varieties a vast majority of\r\nthe seedlings come true. Naudin, referring (page 47) to C. pepo, says that\r\nits races \"ne different des especes veritables qu'en ce qu'elles peuvent\r\ns'allier les unes aux autres par voie d'hybridite, sans que leur\r\ndescendance perde la faculte de se perpetuer.\" If we were to trust to\r\nexternal differences alone, and give up the test of sterility, a multitude\r\nof species would have to be formed out of the varieties of these three\r\nspecies of Cucurbita. Many naturalists at the present day lay far too\r\nlittle stress, in my opinion, on the test of sterility; yet it is not\r\nimprobable that distinct species of plants after a long course of\r\ncultivation and variation may have their mutual sterility eliminated, as we\r\nhave every reason to believe has occurred with domesticated animals. Nor,\r\nin the case of plants under cultivation, should we be justified in assuming\r\nthat varieties never acquire a slight degree of mutual sterility, as we\r\nshall more fully see in a future chapter when certain facts are given on\r\nthe high authority of Gartner and Kolreuter. (10/138. Gartner\r\n'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 s. 87 and s. 169 with respect to Maize; on\r\nVerbascum ibid s. 92 and 181; also his 'Kenntniss der Befruchtung' s. 137.\r\nWith respect to Nicotiana see Kolreuter 'Zweite Forts.' 1764 s. 53; though\r\nthis is a somewhat different case.)\r\n\r\nThe forms of C. pepo are classed by Naudin under seven sections, each\r\nincluding subordinate varieties. He considers this plant as probably the\r\nmost variable in the world. The fruit of one variety (pages 33, 46) exceeds\r\nin value that of another by more than two thousand fold! When the fruit is\r\nof very large size, the number produced is few (page 45); when of small\r\nsize, many are produced. No less astonishing (page 33) is the variation in\r\nthe shape of the fruit, the typical form apparently is egg-like, but this\r\nbecomes either drawn out into a cylinder, or shortened into a flat disc. We\r\nhave also an almost infinite diversity in the colour and state of surface\r\nof the fruit, in the hardness both of the shell and of the flesh, and in\r\nthe taste of the flesh, which is either extremely sweet, farinaceous, or\r\nslightly bitter. The seeds also differ in a slight degree in shape, and\r\nwonderfully in size (page 34), namely, from six or seven to more than\r\ntwenty-five millimetres in length.\r\n\r\nIn the varieties which grow upright or do not run and climb, the tendrils,\r\nthough useless (page 31), are either present or are represented by various\r\nsemi-monstrous organs, or are quite absent. The tendrils are even absent in\r\nsome running varieties in which the stems are much elongated. It is a\r\nsingular fact that (page 31) in all the varieties with dwarfed stems, the\r\nleaves closely resemble each other in shape.]\r\n\r\nThose naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often maintain\r\nthat, even in the most variable forms, the characters which they consider\r\nof specific value are unchangeable. To give an example from a conscientious\r\nwriter (10/139. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 64.) who, relying on the\r\nlabours of M. Naudin, and referring to the species of Cucurbita, says, \"au\r\nmilieu de toutes les variations du fruit, les tiges, les feuilles, les\r\ncalices, les corolles, les etamines restent invariables dans chacune\r\nd'elles.\" Yet M. Naudin, in describing Cucurbita pepo (page 30), says,\r\n\"Ici, d'ailleurs, ce ne sont pas seulement les fruits qui varient, c'est\r\naussi le feuillage et tout le port de la plante. Neanmoins, je crois qu'on\r\nla distinguera toujours facilement des deux autres especes, si l'on veut ne\r\npas perdre de vue les caracteres differentiels que je m'efforce de faire\r\nressortir. Ces caracteres sont quelquefois peu marques: il arrive meme que\r\nplusieurs d'entre eux s'effacent presque entierement, mais ii en reste\r\ntoujours quelques-uns qui remettent l'observateur sur la voie.\" Now let it\r\nbe noted what a difference, with regard to the immutability of the so-\r\ncalled specific characters this paragraph produces on the mind, from that\r\nabove quoted from M. Godron.\r\n\r\nI will add another remark: naturalists continually assert that no important\r\norgan varies; but in saying this they unconsciously argue in a vicious\r\ncircle; for if an organ, let it be what it may, is highly variable, it is\r\nregarded as unimportant, and under a systematic point of view this is quite\r\ncorrect. But as long as constancy is thus taken as the criterion of\r\nimportance, it will indeed be long before an important organ can be shown\r\nto be inconstant. The enlarged form of the stigmas, and their sessile\r\nposition on the summit of the ovary, must be considered as important\r\ncharacters, and were used by Gasparini to separate certain pumpkins as a\r\nDISTINCT GENUS; but Naudin says (page 20), these parts have no constancy,\r\nand in the flowers of the Turban varieties of C. maxima they sometimes\r\nresume their ordinary structure. Again, in C. maxima, the carpels (page 19)\r\nwhich form the turban project even as much as two-thirds of their length\r\nout of the receptacle, and this latter part is thus reduced to a sort of\r\nplatform; but this remarkable structure occurs only in certain varieties,\r\nand graduates into the common form in which the carpels are almost entirely\r\nenveloped within the receptacle. In C. moschata the ovarium (page 50)\r\nvaries greatly in shape, being oval, nearly spherical, or cylindrical, more\r\nor less swollen in the upper part, or constricted round the middle, and\r\neither straight or curved. When the ovarium is short and oval the interior\r\nstructure does not differ from that of C. maxima and pepo, but when it is\r\nelongated the carpels occupy only the terminal and swollen portion. I may\r\nadd that in one variety of the cucumber (Cucumis sativus) the fruit\r\nregularly contains five carpels instead of three. (10/140. Naudin 'Annal.\r\ndes Sc. Nat.' 4th series Bot. tome 11 1859 page 28.) I presume that it will\r\nnot be disputed that we here have instances of great variability in organs\r\nof the highest physiological importance, and with most plants of the\r\nhighest classificatory importance.\r\n\r\n[Sageret (10/141. 'Memoire sur les Cucurbitacees' 1826 pages 6, 24.) and\r\nNaudin found that the cucumber (C. sativus) could not be crossed with any\r\nother species of the genus; therefore no doubt it is specifically distinct\r\nfrom the melon. This will appear to most persons a superfluous statement;\r\nyet we hear from Naudin (10/142. 'Flore des Serres' October 1861 quoted in\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 1135. I have often consulted and taken\r\nsome facts from M. Naudin's Memoir on Cucumis in 'Annal. des Sc. Nat.' 4th\r\nseries Bot. tome 11 1859 page 5.) that there is a race of melons, in which\r\nthe fruit is so like that of the cucumber, \"both externally and internally,\r\nthat it is hardly possible to distinguish the one from the other except by\r\nthe leaves.\" The varieties of the melon seem to be endless, for Naudin\r\nafter six years' study had not come to the end of them: he divides them\r\ninto ten sections, including numerous sub-varieties which all intercross\r\nwith perfect ease. (10/143. See also Sageret 'Memoire' page 7.) Of the\r\nforms considered by Naudin to be varieties, botanists have made thirty\r\ndistinct species! \"and they had not the slightest acquaintance with the\r\nmultitude of new forms which have appeared since their time.\" Nor is the\r\ncreation of so many species at all surprising when we consider how strictly\r\ntheir characters are transmitted by seed, and how wonderfully they differ\r\nin appearance: \"Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo\r\nmagis fructuum,\" says Naudin. The fruit is the valuable part, and this, in\r\naccordance with the common rule, is the most modified part. Some melons are\r\nonly as large as small plums, others weigh as much as sixty-six pounds. One\r\nvariety has a scarlet fruit! Another is not more than an inch in diameter,\r\nbut sometimes more than a yard in length, \"twisting about in all directions\r\nlike a serpent.\" It is a singular fact that in this latter variety many\r\nparts of the plant, namely, the stems, the footstalks of the female\r\nflowers, the middle lobe of the leaves, and especially the ovarium, as well\r\nas the mature fruit, all show a strong tendency to become elongated.\r\nSeveral varieties of the melon are interesting from assuming the\r\ncharacteristic features of distinct species and even of distinct though\r\nallied genera: thus the serpent-melon has some resemblance to the fruit of\r\nTrichosanthes anguina; we have seen that other varieties closely resemble\r\ncucumbers; some Egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion\r\nof the pulp, and this is characteristic of certain wild forms. Lastly, a\r\nvariety of melon from Algiers is remarkable from announcing its maturity by\r\n\"a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation,\" when deep cracks suddenly\r\nappear, and the fruit falls to pieces; and this occurs with the wild C.\r\nmomordica. Finally, M. Naudin well remarks that this \"extraordinary\r\nproduction of races and varieties by a single species and their permanence\r\nwhen not interfered with by crossing, are phenomena well calculated to\r\ncause reflection.\"\r\n\r\nUSEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL TREES.\r\n\r\nTrees deserve a passing notice on account of the numerous varieties which\r\nthey present, differing in their precocity, in their manner of growth,\r\ntheir foliage, and bark. Thus of the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the\r\ncatalogue of Messrs. Lawson of Edinburgh includes twenty-one varieties,\r\nsome of which differ much in their bark; there is a yellow, a streaked\r\nreddish-white, a purple, a wart-barked and a fungous-barked variety.\r\n(10/144. Loudon's 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 2 page 1217.) Of hollies\r\nno less than eighty-four varieties are grown alongside each other in Mr.\r\nPaul's nursery. (10/145. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 1096.) In the\r\ncase of trees, all the recorded varieties, as far as I can find out, have\r\nbeen suddenly produced by one single act of variation. The length of time\r\nrequired to raise many generations, and the little value set on the\r\nfanciful varieties, explains how it is that successive modifications have\r\nnot been accumulated by selection; hence, also, it follows that we do not\r\nhere meet with sub-varieties subordinate to varieties, and these again\r\nsubordinate to higher groups. On the Continent, however, where the forests\r\nare more carefully attended to than in England, Alph. De Candolle (10/146.\r\n'Geograph. Bot.' page 1096.) says that there is not a forester who does not\r\nsearch for seeds from that variety which he esteems the most valuable.\r\n\r\nOur useful trees have seldom been exposed to any great change of\r\nconditions; they have not been richly manured, and the English kinds grow\r\nunder their proper climate. Yet in examining extensive beds of seedlings in\r\nnursery-gardens considerable differences may be generally observed in them;\r\nand whilst touring in England I have been surprised at the amount of\r\ndifference in the appearance of the same species in our hedgerows and\r\nwoods. But as plants vary so much in a truly wild state, it would be\r\ndifficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce whether, as I believe to\r\nbe the case, hedgerow trees vary more than those growing in a primeval\r\nforest. Trees when planted by man in woods or hedges do not grow where they\r\nwould naturally be able to hold their place against a host of competitors,\r\nand are therefore exposed to conditions not strictly natural: even this\r\nslight change would probably suffice to cause seedlings raised from such\r\ntrees to be variable. Whether or not our half-wild English trees, as a\r\ngeneral rule, are more variable than trees growing in their native forests,\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt that they have yielded a greater number of\r\nstrongly-marked and singular variations of structure.\r\n\r\nIn manner of growth, we have weeping or pendulous varieties of the willow,\r\nash, elm, oak, and yew, and other trees; and this weeping habit is\r\nsometimes inherited, though in a singularly capricious manner. In the\r\nLombardy poplar, and in certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties of\r\nthorns, junipers, oaks, etc., we have an opposite kind of growth. The\r\nHessian oak (10/147. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page 36.), which is famous\r\nfrom its fastigiate habit and size, bears hardly any resemblance in general\r\nappearance to a common oak; \"its acorns are not sure to produce plants of\r\nthe same habit; some, however, turn out the same as the parent-tree.\"\r\nAnother fastigiate oak is said to have been found wild in the Pyrenees, and\r\nthis is a surprising circumstance; it generally comes so true by seed, that\r\nDe Candolle considered it as specifically distinct. (10/148. Loudon's\r\n'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 3 page 1731.) The fastigiate Juniper (J.\r\nsuecica) likewise transmits its character by seed. (10/149. Ibid volume 4\r\npage 2489.) Dr. Falconer informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta\r\nthe great heat caused apple-trees to become fastigiate; and we thus see the\r\nsame result following from the effects of climate and from some unknown\r\ncause. (10/150. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 91 describes four\r\nvarieties of Robinia remarkable from their manner of growth.)\r\n\r\nIn foliage we have variegated leaves which are often inherited; dark purple\r\nor red leaves, as in the hazel, barberry, and beech, the colour in these\r\ntwo latter trees being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly inherited\r\n(10/151. 'Journal of a Horticultural Tour, by Caledonian Hort. Soc.' 1823\r\npage 107. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 1083. Verlot 'Sur La\r\nProduction des Varietes' 1865 page 55 for the Barberry.); deeply-cut\r\nleaves; and leaves covered with prickles, as in the variety of the holly\r\nwell called ferox, which is said to reproduce itself by seed. (10/152.\r\nLoudon's 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 2 page 508.) In fact, nearly all\r\nthe peculiar varieties evince a tendency, more or less strongly marked, to\r\nreproduce themselves by seed. (10/153. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 92.)\r\nThis is to a certain extent the case, according to Bosc (10/154. Loudon's\r\n'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 3 page 1376.), with three varieties of the\r\nelm, namely, the broad-leafed, lime-leafed, and twisted elm, in which\r\nlatter the fibres of the wood are twisted. Even with the heterophyllous\r\nhornbeam (Carpinus betulus), which bears on each twig leaves of two shapes,\r\n\"several plants raised from seed all retained \"the same peculiarity.\"\r\n(10/155. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 687.) I will add only one other\r\nremarkable case of variation in foliage, namely, the occurrence of two sub-\r\nvarieties of the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves, and which\r\ngenerally transmit their character by seed. (10/156. Godron 'De l'Espece'\r\ntome 2 page 89. In Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 12 1836 page 371, a\r\nvariegated bushy ash is described and figured, as having simple leaves; it\r\noriginated in Ireland.) The occurrence, in trees belonging to widely\r\ndifferent orders, of weeping and fastigiate varieties, and of trees bearing\r\ndeeply cut, variegated, and purple leaves, shows that these deviations of\r\nstructure must result from some very general physiological laws.\r\n\r\nDifferences in general appearance and foliage, not more strongly marked\r\nthan those above indicated, have led good observers to rank as distinct\r\nspecies certain forms which are now known to be mere varieties. Thus, a\r\nplane-tree long cultivated in England was considered by almost every one as\r\na North American species: but is now ascertained by old records, as I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Hooker, to be a variety. So, again, the Thuja pendula or\r\nfiliformis was ranked by such good observers as Lambert, Wallich, and\r\nothers, as a true species; but it is now known that the original plants,\r\nfive in number, suddenly appeared in a bed of seedlings, raised at Mr.\r\nLoddige's nursery, from T. orientalis; and Dr. Hooker has adduced excellent\r\nevidence that at Turin seeds of T. pendula have reproduced the parent form,\r\nT. orientalis. (10/157. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 575.)\r\n\r\nEvery one must have noticed how certain individual trees regularly put\r\nforth and shed their leaves earlier or later than others of the same\r\nspecies. There is a famous horse-chestnut in the Tuileries which is named\r\nfrom leafing so much earlier than the others. There is also an oak near\r\nEdinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period. These differences\r\nhave been attributed by some authors to the nature of the soil in which the\r\ntrees grow; but Archbishop Whately grafted an early thorn on a late one,\r\nand vice versa, and both grafts kept to their proper periods, which\r\ndiffered by about a fortnight, as if they still grew on their own stocks.\r\n(10/158. Quoted from Royal Irish Academy in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841\r\npage 767.) There is a Cornish variety of the elm which is almost an\r\nevergreen, and is so tender that the shoots are often killed by the frost;\r\nand the varieties of the Turkish oak (Q. cerris) may be arranged as\r\ndeciduous, sub-evergreen, and evergreen. (10/159. Loudon 'Arboretum et\r\nFruticetum:' for Elm see volume 3 page 1376; for Oak page 1846.)\r\n\r\nSCOTCH FIR (Pinus sylvestris).\r\n\r\nI allude to this tree as it bears on the question of the greater\r\nvariability of our hedgerow trees compared with those under strictly\r\nnatural conditions. A well-informed writer (10/160. 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1849?, page 822.) states that the Scotch fir presents few varieties in its\r\nnative Scotch forests; but that it \"varies much in figure and foliage, and\r\nin the size, shape, and colour of its cones, when several generations have\r\nbeen produced away from its native locality.\" There is little doubt that\r\nthe highland and lowland varieties differ in the value of their timber, and\r\nthat they can be propagated truly by seed; thus justifying Loudon's remark,\r\nthat \"a variety is often of as much importance as a species, and sometimes\r\nfar more so.\" (10/161. 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 4 page 2150.) I may\r\nmention one rather important point in which this tree occasionally varies;\r\nin the classification of the Coniferae, sections are founded on whether\r\ntwo, three, or five leaves are included in the same sheath; the Scotch fir\r\nhas properly only two leaves thus enclosed, but specimens have been\r\nobserved with groups of three leaves in a sheath. (10/162. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1852 page 693.) Besides these differences in the semi-cultivated\r\nScotch fir, there are in several parts of Europe natural or geographical\r\nraces, which have been ranked by some authors as distinct species. (10/163.\r\nSee 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss Europaischer Pinus-arten von Dr. Christ: Flora,\r\n1864.' He shows that in the Ober-Engadin P. sylvestris and montana are\r\nconnected by intermediate links.) Loudon (10/164. 'Arboretum et Fruticetum'\r\nvolume 4 pages 2159 and 2189.) considers P. pumilio, with its several sub-\r\nvarieties, as mughus, nana, etc., which differ much when planted in\r\ndifferent soils, and only come \"tolerably true from seed,\" as alpine\r\nvarieties of the Scotch fir; if this were proved to be the case, it would\r\nbe an interesting fact as showing that dwarfing from long exposure to a\r\nsevere climate is to a certain extent inherited.\r\n\r\nTHE HAWTHORN (Crataegus oxyacantha).\r\n\r\nThe Hawthorn has varied much. Besides endless slighter variations in the\r\nform of the leaves, and in the size, hardness, fleshiness, and shape of the\r\nberries, Loudon (10/165. Ibid volume 2 page 830; Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.'\r\nvolume 6 1830 page 714.) enumerates twenty-nine well-marked varieties.\r\nBesides those cultivated for their pretty flowers, there are others with\r\ngolden-yellow, black, and whitish berries; others with woolly berries, and\r\nothers with re-curved thorns. Loudon truly remarks that the chief reason\r\nwhy the hawthorn has yielded more varieties than most other trees, is that\r\nnurserymen select any remarkable variety out of the immense beds of\r\nseedlings which are annually raised for making hedges. The flowers of the\r\nhawthorn usually include from one to three pistils; but in two varieties,\r\nnamed monogyna and sibirica, there is only a single pistil; and d'Asso\r\nstates that the common thorn in Spain is constantly in this state. (10/166.\r\nLoudon's 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 2 page 834.) There is also a\r\nvariety which is apetalous, or has its petals reduced to mere rudiments.\r\nThe famous Glastonbury thorn flowers and leafs towards the end of December,\r\nat which time it bears berries produced from an earlier crop of flowers.\r\n(10/167. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 9 1833 page 123.) It is worth\r\nnotice that several varieties of the hawthorn, as well as of the lime and\r\njuniper, are very distinct in their foliage and habit whilst young, but in\r\nthe course of thirty or forty years become extremely like each other\r\n(10/168. Ibid volume 11 1835 page 503.) thus reminding us of the well-known\r\nfact that the deodar, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of the Atlas, are\r\ndistinguished with the greatest ease whilst young, but with difficulty when\r\nold.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS.\r\n\r\nI shall not for several reasons treat the variability of plants which are\r\ncultivated for their flowers alone at any great length. Many of our\r\nfavourite kinds in their present state are the descendants of two or more\r\nspecies crossed and commingled together, and this circumstance alone would\r\nrender it difficult to detect the difference due to variation. For\r\ninstance, our Roses, Petunias, Calceolarias, Fuchsias, Verbenas, Gladioli,\r\nPelargoniums, etc., certainly have had a multiple origin. A botanist well\r\nacquainted with the parent-forms would probably detect some curious\r\nstructural differences in their crossed and cultivated descendant; and he\r\nwould certainly observe many new and remarkable constitutional\r\npeculiarities. I will give a few instances, all relating to the\r\nPelargonium, and taken chiefly from Mr. Beck (10/169. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 623.) a famous cultivator of this plant: some\r\nvarieties require more water than others; some are \"very impatient of the\r\nknife if too greedily used in making cuttings;\" some, when potted, scarcely\r\n\"show a root at the outside of the ball of the earth;\" one variety requires\r\na certain amount of confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flower-\r\nstem; some varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season, others\r\nat the close; one variety is known (10/170. D. Beaton in 'Cottage Gardener'\r\n1860 page 377. See also Mr. Beck on the habits of Queen Mab in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 226.), which will stand \"even pine-apple top and\r\nbottom heat, without looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a\r\ncommon greenhouse; and Blanche Fleur seems as if made on purpose for\r\ngrowing in winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all summer.\" These odd\r\nconstitutional peculiarities would enable a plant in a state of nature to\r\nbecome adapted to widely different circumstances and climates.\r\n\r\nFlowers possess little interest under our present point of view, because\r\nthey have been almost exclusively attended to and selected for their\r\nbeautiful colour, size, perfect outline, and manner of growth. In these\r\nparticulars hardly one long-cultivated flower can be named which has not\r\nvaried greatly. What does a florist care for the shape and structure of the\r\norgans of fructification, unless, indeed, they add to the beauty of the\r\nflower? When this is the case, flowers become modified in important points;\r\nstamens and pistils may be converted into petals, and additional petals may\r\nbe developed, as in all double flowers. The process of gradual selection by\r\nwhich flowers have been rendered more and more double, each step in the\r\nprocess of conversion being inherited, has been recorded in several\r\ninstances. In the so-called double flowers of the Compositae, the corollas\r\nof the central florets are greatly modified, and the modifications are\r\nlikewise inherited. In the columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) some of the\r\nstamens are converted into petals having the shape of nectaries, one neatly\r\nfitting into the other; but in one variety they are converted into simple\r\npetals. (10/171. Moquin-Tandon 'Elements de Teratologie' 1841 page 213.) In\r\nthe \"hose in hose\" primulae, the calyx becomes brightly coloured and\r\nenlarged so as to resemble a corolla; and Mr. W. Wooler informs me that\r\nthis peculiarity is transmitted; for he crossed a common polyanthus with\r\none having a coloured calyx (10/172. See also 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page\r\n133.) and some of the seedlings inherited the coloured calyx during at\r\nleast six generations. In the \"hen-and-chicken\" daisy the main flower is\r\nsurrounded by a brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils of\r\nthe scales of the involucre. A wonderful poppy has been described, in which\r\nthe stamens are converted into pistils; and so strictly was this\r\npeculiarity inherited that, out of 154 seedlings, one alone reverted to the\r\nordinary and common type. (10/173. Quoted by Alph. de Candolle 'Bibl.\r\nUniv.' November 1862 page 58.) Of the cock's-comb (Celosia cristata), which\r\nis an annual, there are several races in which the flower-stem is\r\nwonderfully \"fasciated\" or compressed; and one has been exhibited (10/174.\r\nKnight 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 322.) actually eighteen inches\r\nin breadth. Peloric races of Gloxinia speciosa and Antirrhinum majus can be\r\npropagated by seed, and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical\r\nform both in structure and appearance.\r\n\r\nA much more remarkable modification has been recorded by Sir William and\r\nDr. Hooker (10/175. 'Botanical Magazine' tab. 5160 figure 4; Dr. Hooker in\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1860 page 190; Prof. Harvey in 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1860 page 145; Mr. Crocker in 'Gardener's Chron.' 1861 page\r\n1092.) in Begonia frigida. This plant properly produces male and female\r\nflowers on the same fascicles; and in the female flowers the perianth is\r\nsuperior; but a plant at Kew produced, besides the ordinary flowers, others\r\nwhich graduated towards a perfect hermaphrodite structure; and in these\r\nflowers the perianth was inferior. To show the importance of this\r\nmodification under a classificatory point of view, I may quote what Prof.\r\nHarvey says, namely, that had it \"occurred in a state of nature, and had a\r\nbotanist collected a plant with such flowers, he would not only have placed\r\nit in a distinct genus from Begonia, but would probably have considered it\r\nas the type of a new natural order.\" This modification cannot in one sense\r\nbe considered as a monstrosity, for analogous structures naturally occur in\r\nother orders, as with Saxifragae and Aristolochiaceae. The interest of the\r\ncase is largely added to by Mr. C.W. Crocker's observation that seedlings\r\nfrom the NORMAL flowers produced plants which bore, in about the same\r\nproportion as the parent-plant, hermaphrodite flowers having inferior\r\nperianths. The hermaphrodite flowers fertilised with their own pollen were\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nIf florists had attended to, selected, and propagated by seed other\r\nmodifications of structure besides those which are beautiful, a host of\r\ncurious varieties would certainly have been raised; and they would probably\r\nhave transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator would have\r\nfelt aggrieved, as in the case of culinary vegetables, if his whole bed had\r\nnot presented a uniform appearance. Florists have attended in some\r\ninstances to the leaves of their plant, and have thus produced the most\r\nelegant and symmetrical patterns of white, red, and green, which, as in the\r\ncase of the pelargonium, are sometimes strictly inherited. (10/176. Alph.\r\nde Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 1083; 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page\r\n433. The inheritance of the white and golden zones in Pelargonium largely\r\ndepends on the nature of the soil. See D. Beaton in 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' 1861 page 64.) Any one who will habitually examine highly-\r\ncultivated flowers in gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous\r\ndeviations in structure; but most of these must be ranked as mere\r\nmonstrosities, and are only so far interesting as showing how plastic the\r\norganisation becomes under high cultivation. From this point of view such\r\nworks as Professor Moquin-Tandon's 'Teratologie' are highly instructive.\r\n\r\nROSES.\r\n\r\nThese flowers offer an instance of a number of forms generally ranked as\r\nspecies, namely, R. centifolia, gallica, alba, damascena, spinosissima,\r\nbracteata, indica, semperflorens, moschata, etc., which have largely varied\r\nand been intercrossed. The genus Rosa is a notoriously difficult one, and,\r\nthough some of the above forms are admitted by all botanists to be distinct\r\nspecies, others are doubtful; thus, with respect to the British forms,\r\nBabington makes seventeen, and Bentham only five species. The hybrids from\r\nsome of the most distinct forms--for instance, from R. indica, fertilised\r\nby the pollen of R. centifolia--produce an abundance of seed; I state this\r\non the authority of Mr. Rivers (10/177. 'Rose Amateur's Guide' T. Rivers\r\n1837 page 21.) from whose work I have drawn most of the following\r\nstatements. As almost all the aboriginal forms brought from different\r\ncountries have been crossed and re-crossed, it is no wonder that Targioni-\r\nTozzetti, in speaking of the common roses of the Italian gardens, remarks\r\nthat \"the native country and precise form of the wild type of most of them\r\nare involved in much uncertainty.\" (10/178. 'Journal Hort. Soc.' volume 9\r\n1855 page 182.) Nevertheless, Mr. Rivers in referring to R. indica (page\r\n68) says that the descendants of each group may generally be recognised by\r\na close observer. The same author often speaks of roses as having been a\r\nlittle hybridised; but it is evident that in very many cases the\r\ndifferences due to variation and to hybridisation can now only be\r\nconjecturally distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe species have varied both by seed and by bud; such modified buds being\r\noften called by gardeners sports. In the following chapter I shall fully\r\ndiscuss this latter subject, and shall show that bud-variations can be\r\npropagated not only by grafting and budding, but often by seed. Whenever a\r\nnew rose appears with any peculiar character, however produced, if it\r\nyields seed, Mr. Rivers (page 4) fully expects it to become the parent-type\r\nof a new family. The tendency to vary is so strong in some kinds, as in the\r\nVillage Maid (Rivers page 16), that when grown in different soils it varies\r\nso much in colour that it has been thought to form several distinct kinds.\r\nAltogether the number of kinds is very great: thus M. Desportes, in his\r\nCatalogue for 1829, enumerates 2562 as cultivated in France; but no doubt a\r\nlarge proportion of these are merely nominal.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to specify the many points of difference between the\r\nvarious kinds, but some constitutional peculiarities may be mentioned.\r\nSeveral French roses (Rivers page 12) will not succeed in England; and an\r\nexcellent horticulturist (10/179. The Rev. W.F. Radclyffe in 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' March 14, 1865 page 207.) remarks, that \"Even in the same\r\ngarden you will find that a rose that will do nothing under a south wall\r\nwill do well under a north one. That is the case with Paul Joseph here. It\r\ngrows strongly and blooms beautifully close to a north wall. For three\r\nyears seven plants have done nothing under a south wall.\" Many roses can be\r\nforced, \"many are totally unfit for forcing, among which is General\r\nJacqueminot.\" (10/180. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1831 page 46.) From the\r\neffects of crossing and variation Mr. Rivers enthusiastically anticipates\r\n(page 87) that the day will come when all our roses, even moss-roses, will\r\nhave evergreen foliage, brilliant and fragrant flowers, and the habit of\r\nblooming from June till November. \"A distant view this seems, but\r\nperseverance in gardening will yet achieve wonders,\" as assuredly it has\r\nalready achieved wonders.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while briefly to give the well-known history of one class\r\nof roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (R. spinosissima) were\r\ntransplanted into a garden (10/181. Mr. Sabine in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 4 page 285.); and one of these bore flowers slightly tinged with\r\nred, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous flowers, also tinged\r\nwith red; seedlings from this flower were semi-double, and by continued\r\nselection, in about nine or ten years, eight sub-varieties were raised. In\r\nthe course of less than twenty years these double Scotch roses had so much\r\nincreased in number and kind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties,\r\nclassed in eight sections, were described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841 (10/182.\r\n'An Encyclop. of Plants' by J.C. Loudon 1841 page 443.) it is said that\r\nthree hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near\r\nGlasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, red, marbled,\r\ntwo-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in the size and\r\nshape of the flower.\r\n\r\nPANSY OR HEARTSEASE (Viola tricolor, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe history of this flower seems to be pretty well known; it was grown in\r\nEvelyn's garden in 1687; but the varieties were not attended to till 1810-\r\n1812, when Lady Monke, together with Mr. Lee, the well-known nursery-man,\r\nenergetically commenced their culture; and in the course of a few years\r\ntwenty varieties could be purchased. (10/183. Loudon's 'Gardener's\r\nMagazine' volume 11 1835 page 427; also Journal of Horticulture' April 14,\r\n1863 page 275.) At about the same period, namely in 1813 or 1814, Lord\r\nGambier collected some wild plants, and his gardener, Mr. Thomson,\r\ncultivated them, together with some common garden varieties, and soon\r\neffected a great improvement. The first great change was the conversion of\r\nthe dark lines in the centre of the flower into a dark eye or centre, which\r\nat that period had never been seen, but is now considered one of the chief\r\nrequisites of a first-rate flower. In 1835 a book entirely devoted to this\r\nflower was published, and four hundred named varieties were on sale. From\r\nthese circumstances this plant seemed to me worth studying, more especially\r\nfrom the great contrast between the small, dull, elongated, irregular\r\nflowers of the wild pansy, and the beautiful, flat, symmetrical, circular,\r\nvelvet-like flowers, more than two inches in diameter, magnificently and\r\nvariously coloured, which are exhibited at our shows. But when I came to\r\nenquire more closely, I found that, though the varieties were so modern,\r\nyet that much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage. Florists\r\nbelieve that the varieties (10/184. Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 8\r\npage 575: volume 9 page 689.) are descended from several wild stocks,\r\nnamely, V. tricolor, lutea, grandiflora, amoena, and altaica, more or less\r\nintercrossed. And when I looked to botanical works to ascertain whether\r\nthese forms ought to be ranked as species, I found equal doubt and\r\nconfusion. Viola altaica seems to be a distinct form, but what part it has\r\nplayed in the origin of our varieties I know not; it is said to have been\r\ncrossed with V. lutea. Viola amoena (10/185. Sir J.E. Smith 'English Flora'\r\nvolume 1 page 306. H.C. Watson 'Cybele Britannica' volume 1 1847 page 181.)\r\nis now looked at by all botanists as a natural variety of V. grandiflora;\r\nand this and V. sudetica have been proved to be identical with V. lutea.\r\nThe latter and V. tricolor (including its admitted variety V. arvensis) are\r\nranked as distinct species by Babington, and likewise by M. Gay (10/186.\r\nQuoted from 'Annales des Sciences' in the Companion to the 'Bot. Mag.'\r\nvolume 1 1835 page 159.) who has paid particular attention to the genus;\r\nbut the specific distinction between V. lutea and tricolor is chiefly\r\ngrounded on the one being strictly and the other not strictly perennial, as\r\nwell as on some other slight and unimportant differences in the form of the\r\nstem and stipules. Bentham unites these two forms; and a high authority on\r\nsuch matters, Mr. H.C. Watson (10/187. 'Cybele Britannica' volume 1 page\r\n173. See also Dr. Herbert on the changes of colour in transplanted\r\nspecimens, and on the natural variations of V. grandiflora, in 'Transact.\r\nHort. Soc.' volume 4 page 19.) says that, \"while V. tricolor passes into V.\r\narvensis on the one side, it approximates so much towards V. lutea and V.\r\nCurtisii on the other side, that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy\r\nbetween them.\"\r\n\r\nHence, after having carefully compared numerous varieties, I gave up the\r\nattempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist. Most of\r\nthe varieties present such inconstant characters, that when grown in poor\r\nsoil, or when flowering out of their proper season, they produced\r\ndifferently coloured and much smaller flowers. Cultivators speak of this or\r\nthat kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by this they do not\r\nmean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its character by seed, but\r\nthat the individual plant does not change much under culture. The principle\r\nof inheritance, however, does hold good to a certain extent even with the\r\nfleeting varieties of the Heartsease, for to gain good sorts it is\r\nindispensable to sow the seed of good sorts. Nevertheless, in almost every\r\nlarge seed-bed a few, almost wild seedlings reappear through reversion. On\r\ncomparing the choicest varieties with the nearest allied wild forms,\r\nbesides the difference in the size, outline, and colour of the flowers, the\r\nleaves sometimes differ in shape, as does the calyx occasionally in the\r\nlength and breadth of the sepals. The differences in the form of the\r\nnectary more especially deserve notice; because characters derived from\r\nthis organ have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species\r\nof Viola. In a large number of flowers compared in 1842 I found that in the\r\ngreater number the nectary was straight; in others the extremity was a\r\nlittle turned upwards, or downwards, or inwards, so as to be completely\r\nhooked; in others, instead of being hooked, it was first turned\r\nrectangularly downwards, and then backwards and upwards; in others, the\r\nextremity was considerably enlarged; and lastly, in some the basal part was\r\ndepressed, becoming, as usual, laterally compressed towards the extremity.\r\nIn a large number of flowers, on the other hand, examined by me in 1856\r\nfrom a nursery-garden in a different part of England, the nectary hardly\r\nvaried at all. Now M. Gay says that in certain districts, especially in\r\nAuvergne, the nectary of the wild V. grandiflora varies in the manner just\r\ndescribed. Must we conclude from this that the cultivated varieties first\r\nmentioned were all descended from V. grandiflora, and that the second lot,\r\nthough having the same general appearance, were descended from V. tricolor,\r\nof which the nectary, according to M. Gay, is subject to little variation?\r\nOr is it not more probable that both these wild forms would be found under\r\nother conditions to vary in the same manner and degree, thus showing that\r\nthey ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct?\r\n\r\nTHE DAHLIA\r\n\r\nThe Dahlia has been referred to by almost every author who has written on\r\nthe variation of plants, because it is believed that all the varieties are\r\ndescended from a single species, and because all have arisen since 1802 in\r\nFrance, and since 1804 in England. (10/188. Salisbury in 'Transact. Hort.\r\nSoc.' volume 1 1812 pages 84, 92. A semi-double variety was produced in\r\nMadrid in 1790.) Mr. Sabine remarks that \"it seems as if some period of\r\ncultivation had been required before the fixed qualities of the native\r\nplant gave way and began to sport into those changes which now so delight\r\nus.\" (10/189. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 1820 page 225.) The flowers\r\nhave been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular form. Anemone\r\nand ranunculus-like races (10/190. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 6 1830\r\npage 77.) which differ in the form and arrangement of the florets, have\r\narisen; also dwarfed races, one of which is only eighteen inches in height.\r\nThe seeds vary much in size. The petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or\r\nstriped, and present an almost infinite diversity of tints. Seedlings of\r\nfourteen different colours (10/191. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page\r\n1035.) have been raised from the same plant; yet, as Mr. Sabine has\r\nremarked, \"many of the seedlings follow their parents in colour.\" The\r\nperiod of flowering has been considerably hastened, and this has probably\r\nbeen effected by continued selection. Salisbury, writing 1808, says that\r\nthey then flowered from September to November; in 1828 some new dwarf\r\nvarieties began flowering in June (10/192. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1\r\npage 91; and Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 3 1828 page 179.); and Mr.\r\nGrieve informs me that the dwarf purple Zelinda in his garden is in full\r\nbloom by the middle of June and sometimes even earlier. Slight\r\nconstitutional differences have been observed between certain varieties:\r\nthus, some kinds succeed much better in one part of England than in another\r\n(10/193. Mr. Wildman in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 87. 'Cottage\r\nGardener' April 8, 1856 page 33.) and it has been noticed that some\r\nvarieties require much more moisture than others. (10/194. M. Faivre has\r\ngiven an interesting account of the successive variations of the Chinese\r\nprimrose, since its introduction into Europe about the year 1820: 'Revue\r\ndes Cours Scientifiques' June 1869 page 428.)\r\n\r\nSuch flowers as the CARNATION, COMMON TULIP, and HYACINTH, which are\r\nbelieved to be descended, each from a single wild form, present innumerable\r\nvarieties, differing almost exclusively in the size, form, and colour of\r\nthe flowers. These and some other anciently cultivated plants which have\r\nbeen long propagated by offsets, pipings, bulbs, etc., become so\r\nexcessively variable, that almost each new plant raised from seed forms a\r\nnew variety, \"all of which to describe particularly,\" as old Gerarde wrote\r\nin 1597, \"were to roll Sisyphus's stone, or to number the sands.\"\r\n\r\nHYACINTH (Hyacinthus orientalis).\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be worth while to give a short account of this plant,\r\nwhich was introduced into England in 1596 from the Levant. (10/195. The\r\nbest and fullest account of this plant which I have met with is by a famous\r\nhorticulturist, Mr. Paul, of Waltham, in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1864\r\npage 342.) The petals of the original flower, says Mr. Paul, were narrow,\r\nwrinkled, pointed, and of a flimsy texture; now they are broad, smooth,\r\nsolid, and rounded. The erectness, breadth, and length of the whole spike,\r\nand the size of the flowers, have all increased. The colours have been\r\nintensified and diversified. Gerarde, in 1597, enumerates four, and\r\nParkinson, in 1629, eight varieties. Now the varieties are very numerous,\r\nand they were still more numerous a century ago. Mr. Paul remarks that \"it\r\nis interesting to compare the Hyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864, and to\r\nmark the improvement. Two hundred and thirty-five years have elapsed since\r\nthen, and this simple flower serves well to illustrate the great fact that\r\nthe original forms of nature do not remain fixed and stationary, at least\r\nwhen brought under cultivation. While looking at the extremes, we must not,\r\nhowever, forget that there are intermediate stages which are for the most\r\npart lost to us. Nature will sometimes indulge herself with a leap, but as\r\na rule her march is slow and gradual.\" He adds that the cultivator should\r\nhave \"in his mind an ideal of beauty, for the realisation of which he works\r\nwith head and hand.\" We thus see how clearly Mr. Paul, an eminently\r\nsuccessful cultivator of this flower, appreciates the action of methodical\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIn a curious and apparently trustworthy treatise, published at Amsterdam\r\n(10/196. 'Des Jacinthes, de leur Anatomie, Reproduction, et Culture'\r\nAmsterdam 1768.) in 1768, it is stated that nearly 2,000 sorts were then\r\nknown; but in 1864 Mr. Paul found only 700 in the largest garden at\r\nHaarlem. In this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of any\r\none variety reproducing itself truly by seed: the white kinds, however, now\r\n(10/197. Alph. de Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 1082.) almost always yield\r\nwhite hyacinths, and the yellow kinds come nearly true. The hyacinth is\r\nremarkable from having given rise to varieties with bright blue, pink, and\r\ndistinctly yellow flowers. These three primary colours do not occur in the\r\nvarieties of any other species; nor do they often all occur even in the\r\ndistinct species of the same genus. Although the several kinds of hyacinths\r\ndiffer but slightly from each other except in colour, yet each kind has its\r\nown individual character, which can be recognised by a highly educated eye;\r\nthus the writer of the Amsterdam treatise asserts (page 43) that some\r\nexperienced florists, such as the famous G. Voorhelm, seldom failed in a\r\ncollection of above twelve hundred sorts to recognise each variety by the\r\nbulb alone! This same writer mentions some few singular variations: for\r\ninstance, the hyacinth commonly produces six leaves, but there is one kind\r\n(page 35) which scarcely ever has more than three leaves; another never\r\nmore than five; whilst others regularly produce either seven or eight\r\nleaves. A variety, called la Coryphee, invariably produces (page 116) two\r\nflower-stems, united together and covered by one skin. The flower-stem in\r\nanother kind (page 128) comes out of the ground in a coloured sheath,\r\nbefore the appearance of the leaves, and is consequently liable to suffer\r\nfrom frost. Another variety always pushes a second flower-stem after the\r\nfirst has begun to develop itself. Lastly, white hyacinths with red,\r\npurple, or violet centres (page 129) are the most liable to rot. Thus, the\r\nhyacinth, like so many previous plants, when long cultivated and closely\r\nwatched, is found to offer many singular variations.]\r\n\r\nIn the two last chapters I have given in some detail the range of\r\nvariation, and the history, as far as known, of a considerable number of\r\nplants, which have been cultivated for various purposes. But some of the\r\nmost variable plants, such as Kidney-beans, Capsicum, Millets, Sorghum,\r\netc., have been passed over; for botanists are not at all agreed which\r\nkinds ought to rank as species and which as varieties; and the wild parent-\r\nspecies are unknown. (10/198. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 983.)\r\nMany plants long cultivated in tropical countries, such as the Banana, have\r\nproduced numerous varieties; but as these have never been described with\r\neven moderate care, they are here also passed over. Nevertheless, a\r\nsufficient, and perhaps more than sufficient, number of cases have been\r\ngiven, so that the reader may be enabled to judge for himself on the nature\r\nand great amount of variation which cultivated plants have undergone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XI.\r\n\r\nON BUD-VARIATION, AND ON CERTAIN ANOMALOUS MODES OF REPRODUCTION AND\r\nVARIATION.\r\n\r\nBUD-VARIATION IN THE PEACH, PLUM, CHERRY, VINE, GOOSEBERRY, CURRANT, AND\r\nBANANA, AS SHOWN BY THE MODIFIED FRUIT.\r\nIN FLOWERS: CAMELLIAS, AZALEAS, CHRYSANTHEMUMS, ROSES, ETC.\r\nON THE RUNNING OF THE COLOUR IN CARNATIONS.\r\nBUD-VARIATIONS IN LEAVES.\r\nVARIATIONS BY SUCKERS, TUBERS, AND BULBS.\r\nON THE BREAKING OF TULIPS.\r\nBUD-VARIATIONS GRADUATE INTO CHANGES CONSEQUENT ON CHANGED CONDITIONS OF\r\nLIFE.\r\nGRAFT-HYBRIDS.\r\nON THE SEGREGATION OF THE PARENTAL CHARACTERS IN SEMINAL HYBRIDS BY BUD-\r\nVARIATION.\r\nON THE DIRECT OR IMMEDIATE ACTION OF FOREIGN POLLEN ON THE MOTHER-PLANT.\r\nON THE EFFECTS IN FEMALE ANIMALS OF A PREVIOUS IMPREGNATION ON THE\r\nSUBSEQUENT OFFSPRING.\r\nCONCLUSION AND SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will be chiefly devoted to a subject in many respects\r\nimportant, namely, bud-variation. By this term I include all those sudden\r\nchanges in structure or appearance which occasionally occur in full-grown\r\nplants in their flower-buds or leaf-buds. Gardeners call such changes\r\n\"Sports;\" but this, as previously remarked, is an ill-defined expression,\r\nas it has often been applied to strongly marked variations in seedling\r\nplants. The difference between seminal and bud reproduction is not so great\r\nas it at first appears; for each bud is in one sense a new and distinct\r\nindividual; but such individuals are produced through the formation of\r\nvarious kinds of buds without the aid of any special apparatus, whilst\r\nfertile seeds are produced by the concourse of the two sexual elements. The\r\nmodifications which arise through bud-variation can generally be propagated\r\nto any extent by grafting, budding, cuttings, bulbs, etc., and occasionally\r\neven by seed. Some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have\r\narisen by bud-variation.\r\n\r\nBud-variations have as yet been observed only in the vegetable kingdom; but\r\nit is probable that if compound animals, such as corals, etc., had been\r\nsubjected to a long course of domestication, they would have varied by\r\nbuds; for they resemble plants in many respects. For instance, any new or\r\npeculiar character presented by a compound animal is propagated by budding,\r\nas occurs with differently coloured Hydras, and as Mr. Gosse has shown to\r\nbe the case with a singular variety of a true coral. Varieties of the Hydra\r\nhave also been grafted on other varieties, and have retained their\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI will in the first place give all the cases of bud variations which I have\r\nbeen able to collect, and afterwards show their importance. (11/1. Since\r\nthe publication of the first edition of this work, I have found that M.\r\nCarriere, Chef des Pepinieres au Mus. d'Hist. Nat. in his excellent Essay\r\n'Production et Fixation des Varietes' 1865 has given a list of bud-\r\nvariations far more extensive than mine; but as these relate chiefly to\r\ncases occurring in France I have left my list as it stood, adding a few\r\nfacts from M. Carriere and others. Any one who wishes to study the subject\r\nfully should refer to M. Carriere's Essay.) These cases prove that those\r\nauthors who, like Pallas, attribute all variability to the crossing either\r\nof distinct races, or of distinct individuals belonging to the same race\r\nbut somewhat different from each other, are in error; as are those authors\r\nwho attribute all variability to the mere act of sexual union. Nor can we\r\naccount in all cases for the appearance through bud-variation of new\r\ncharacters by the principle of reversion to long-lost characters. He who\r\nwishes to judge how far the conditions of life directly cause each\r\nparticular variation ought to reflect well on the cases immediately to be\r\ngiven. I will commence with bud-variations, as exhibited in the fruit, and\r\nthen pass on to flowers, and finally to leaves.\r\n\r\n[PEACH (Amygdalus persica).\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I gave two cases of a peach-almond and a double-\r\nflowered almond which suddenly produced fruit closely resembling true\r\npeaches. I have also given many cases of peach-trees producing buds, which,\r\nwhen developed into branches, have yielded nectarines. We have seen that no\r\nless than six named and several unnamed varieties of the peach have thus\r\nproduced several varieties of nectarine. I have shown that it is highly\r\nimprobable that all these peach-trees, some of which are old varieties, and\r\nhave been propagated by the million, are hybrids from the peach and\r\nnectarine, and that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the\r\noccasional production of nectarines on peach-trees to the direct action of\r\npollen from some neighbouring nectarine-tree. Several of the cases are\r\nhighly remarkable, because, firstly, the fruit thus produced has sometimes\r\nbeen in part a nectarine and in part a peach; secondly, because nectarines\r\nthus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed; and thirdly,\r\nbecause nectarines are produced from peach-trees from seed as well as from\r\nbuds. The seed of the nectarine, on the other hand, occasionally produces\r\npeaches; and we have seen in one instance that a nectarine-tree yielded\r\npeaches by bud-variation. As the peach is certainly the oldest or primary\r\nvariety, the production of peaches from nectarines, either by seeds or\r\nbuds, may perhaps be considered as a case of reversion. Certain trees have\r\nalso been described as indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines, and\r\nthis may be considered as bud-variation carried to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\nThe grosse mignonne peach at Montreuil produced \"from a sporting branch\"\r\nthe grosse mignonne tardive, \"a most excellent variety,\" which ripens its\r\nfruit a fortnight later than the parent tree, and is equally good. (11/2.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1854 page 821.) This same peach has likewise\r\nproduced by bud-variation the early grosse mignonne. Hunt's large tawny\r\nnectarine \"originated from Hunt's small tawny nectarine, but not through\r\nseminal reproduction.\" (11/3. Lindley 'Guide to Orchard' as quoted in\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 821. For the Early mignonne peach see\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1864 page 1251.)\r\n\r\nPLUMS.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight states that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum, forty years\r\nold, which had always borne ordinary fruit, produced a branch which yielded\r\nred magnum bonums. (11/4. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 160.) Mr.\r\nRivers, of Sawbridgeworth, informs me (January 1863) that a single tree out\r\nof 400 or 500 trees of the Early Prolific plum, which is a purple kind,\r\ndescended from an old French variety bearing purple fruit, produced when\r\nabout ten years old bright yellow plums; these differed in no respect\r\nexcept colour from those on the other trees, but were unlike any other\r\nknown kind of yellow plum. (11/5. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page\r\n27.)\r\n\r\nCHERRY (Prunus cerasus).\r\n\r\nMr. Knight has recorded (ibid) the case of a branch of a May-Duke cherry,\r\nwhich, though certainly never grafted, always produced fruit, ripening\r\nlater, and more oblong than the fruit on the other branches. Another\r\naccount has been given of two May-Duke cherry-trees in Scotland, with\r\nbranches bearing oblong and very fine fruit, which invariably ripened, as\r\nin Knight's case, a fortnight later than the other cherries. (11/6.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 821.) M. Carriere gives (page 37) numerous\r\nanalogous cases, and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of fruit.\r\n\r\nGRAPES (Vitis vinifera).\r\n\r\nThe black or purple Frontignan in one case produced during two successive\r\nyears (and no doubt permanently), spurs which bore white Frontignan grapes.\r\nIn another case, on the same footstalk, the lower berries \"were well-\r\ncoloured black Frontignans; those next the stalk were white, with the\r\nexception of one black and one streaked berry;\" and altogether there were\r\nfifteen black and twelve white berries on the same stalk. In another kind\r\nof grape, black and amber-coloured berries were produced in the same\r\ncluster. (11/7. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 629; 1856 page 648; 1864\r\npage 986. Other cases are given by Braun 'Rejuvenescence' in 'Ray Soc. Bot.\r\nMem.' 1853 page 314.) Count Odart describes a variety which often bears on\r\nthe same stalk small round and large oblong berries; though the shape of\r\nthe berry is generally a fixed character. (11/8. 'Ampelographie' etc. 1849\r\npage 71.) Here is another striking case given on the excellent authority of\r\nM. Carriere (11/9. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 970.): \"a black Hamburg\r\ngrape (Frankenthal) was cut down, and produced three suckers; one of these\r\nwas layered, and after a time produced much smaller berries, which always\r\nripened at least a fortnight earlier than the others. Of the remaining two\r\nsuckers, one produced every year fine grapes, whilst the other, although it\r\nset an abundance of fruit, matured only a few, and these of inferior\r\nquality.\"\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY (Ribes grossularia).\r\n\r\nA remarkable case has been described by Dr. Lindley (11/10. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1855 pages 597, 612.) of a bush which bore at the same time no\r\nless than four kinds of berries, namely, hairy and red,--smooth, small and\r\nred,--green,--and yellow tinged with buff; the two latter kinds had a\r\ndifferent flavour from the red berries, and their seeds were coloured red.\r\nThree twigs on this bush grew close together; the first bore three yellow\r\nberries and one red; the second twig bore four yellow and one red; and the\r\nthird four red and one yellow. Mr. Laxton also informs me that he has seen\r\na Red Warrington gooseberry bearing both red and yellow fruit on the same\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nCURRANT (Ribes rubrum).\r\n\r\nA bush purchased as the Champagne, which is a variety that bears blush-\r\ncoloured fruit intermediate between red and white, produced during fourteen\r\nyears on separate branches and mingled on the same branch, berries of the\r\nred, white, and champagne kinds. (11/11. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page\r\n873; 1855 page 646. In the 'Chronicle' page 876 Mr. P. Mackenzie states\r\nthat the bush still continues to bear the three kinds of fruit, \"although\r\nthey have not been every year alike.) The suspicion naturally arises that\r\nthis variety may have originated from a cross between a red and white\r\nvariety, and that the above transformation may be accounted for by\r\nreversion to both parent-forms; but from the foregoing complex case of the\r\ngooseberry this view is doubtful. In France, a branch of a red-currant\r\nbush, about ten years old, produced near the summit five white berries) and\r\nlower down, amongst the red berries, one berry half red and half white.\r\n(11/12. 'Revue Horticole' quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 87.)\r\nAlexander Braun (11/13. 'Rejuvenescence in Nature' 'Bot. Memoirs Ray Soc.'\r\n1853 page 314.) also has often seen branches on white currant-trees bearing\r\nred berries.\r\n\r\nPEAR (Pyrus communis).\r\n\r\nDureau de la Malle states that the flowers on some trees of an ancient\r\nvariety, the doyenne galeux, were destroyed by frost: other flowers\r\nappeared in July, which produced six pears; these exactly resembled in\r\ntheir skin and taste the fruit of a distinct variety, the gros doyenne\r\nblanc, but in shape were like the bon-chretien: it was not ascertained\r\nwhether this new variety could be propagated by budding or grafting. The\r\nsame author grafted a bon-chretien on a quince, and it produced, besides\r\nits proper fruit, an apparently new variety, of a peculiar form with thick\r\nand rough skin. (11/14. 'Comptes Rendus' tome 41 1855 page 804. The second\r\ncase is given on the authority of Gaudichaud ibid tome 34 1852 page 748.)\r\n\r\nAPPLE (Pyrus malus).\r\n\r\nIn Canada, a tree of the variety called Pound Sweet, produced (11/15. This\r\ncase is given in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 403.), between two of\r\nits proper fruit, an apple which was well russeted, small in size,\r\ndifferent in shape, and with a short peduncle. As no russet apple grew\r\nanywhere near, this case apparently cannot be accounted for by the direct\r\naction of foreign pollen. M. Carriere (page 38) mentions an analogous\r\ninstance. I shall hereafter give cases of apple-trees which regularly\r\nproduce fruit of two kinds, or half-and-half fruit; these trees are\r\ngenerally supposed, and probably with truth, to be of crossed parentage,\r\nand that the fruit reverts to both parent-forms.\r\n\r\nBANANA (Musa sapientium).\r\n\r\nSir R. Schomburgk states that he saw in St. Domingo a raceme on the Fig\r\nBanana which bore towards the base 125 fruits of the proper kind; and these\r\nwere succeeded, as is usual, higher up the raceme, by barren flowers, and\r\nthese by 420 fruits, having a widely different appearance, and ripening\r\nearlier than the proper fruit. The abnormal fruit closely resembled, except\r\nin being smaller, that of the Musa chinensis or cavendishii, which has\r\ngenerally been ranked as a distinct species. (11/16. 'Journal of Proc.\r\nLinn. Soc.' volume 2 Botany page 131.)\r\n\r\nFLOWERS.\r\n\r\nMany cases have been recorded of a whole plant, or single branch, or bud,\r\nsuddenly producing flowers different from the proper type in colour, form,\r\nsize, doubleness, or other character. Half the flower, or a smaller\r\nsegment, sometimes changes colour.\r\n\r\nCAMELLIA.\r\n\r\nThe myrtle-leaved species (C. myrtifolia), and two or three varieties of\r\nthe common species, have been known to produce hexagonal and imperfectly\r\nquadrangular flowers; and the branches producing such flowers have been\r\npropagated by grafting. (11/17. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1847 page 207.) The\r\nPompon variety often bears \"four distinguishable kinds of flowers,--the\r\npure white and the red-eyed, which appear promiscuously; the brindled pink\r\nand the rose-coloured, which may be kept separate with tolerable certainty\r\nby grafting from the branches that bear them.\" A branch, also, on an old\r\ntree of the rose-coloured variety has been seen to \"revert to the pure\r\nwhite colour, an occurrence less common than the departure from it.\"\r\n(11/18. Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' 1838 page 369.)\r\n\r\nCrataegus oxyacantha.\r\n\r\nA dark pink hawthorn has been known to throw out a single tuft of pure\r\nwhite blossoms (11/19. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 391.); and Mr. A.\r\nClapham, nurseryman, of Bedford, informs me that his father had a deep\r\ncrimson thorn grafted on a white thorn, which during several years, always\r\nbore, high above the graft, bunches of white, pink and deep crimson\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nAzalea indica.\r\n\r\nA. indica is well known often to produce new varieties by buds. I have\r\nmyself seen several cases. A plant of Azalea indica variegata has been\r\nexhibited bearing a truss of flowers of A. ind. gledstanesii \"as true as\r\ncould possibly be produced, thus evidencing the origin of that fine\r\nvariety.\" On another plant of A. ind. variegata a perfect flower of A. ind.\r\nlateritia was produced; so that both gledstanesii and lateritia no doubt\r\noriginally appeared as sporting branches of A. ind. variegata. (11/20.\r\nExhibited at Hort. Soc. London. Report in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page\r\n337.)\r\n\r\nHIBISCUS (Paritium tricuspis).\r\n\r\nA seedling of this plant, when some years old, produced, at Saharunpore\r\n(11/21. Mr. W. Bell 'Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh' May 1863.), some branches\r\n\"which bore leaves and flowers widely different from the normal form.\" \"The\r\nabnormal leaf is much less divided, and not acuminated. The petals are\r\nconsiderably larger, and quite entire. There is also in the fresh state a\r\nconspicuous, large, oblong gland, full of a viscid secretion, on the back\r\nof each of the calycine segments.\" Dr. King, who subsequently had charge of\r\nthese Gardens, informs me that a tree of Paritium tricuspis (probably the\r\nvery same plant) growing there, had a branch buried in the ground,\r\napparently by accident; and this branch changed its character wonderfully,\r\ngrowing like a bush, and producing flowers and leaves, resembling in shape\r\nthose of another species, viz., P. tiliaceum. A small branch springing from\r\nthis bush near the ground, reverted to the parent-form. Both forms were\r\nextensively propagated during several years by cuttings and kept perfectly\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nAlthaea rosea.\r\n\r\nA double yellow Hollyhock suddenly turned one year into a pure white single\r\nkind; subsequently a branch bearing the original double yellow flowers\r\nreappeared in the midst of the branches of the single white kind. (11/22.\r\n'Revue Horticole' quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1845 page 475.)\r\n\r\nPELARGONIUM.\r\n\r\nThese highly cultivated plants seem eminently liable to bud-variation. I\r\nwill give only a few well-marked cases. Gartner has seen (11/23.\r\n'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 s. 76.) a plant of P. zonale with a branch having\r\nwhite edges, which remained constant for years, and bore flowers of a\r\ndeeper red than usual. Generally speaking, such branches present little or\r\nno difference in their flowers: thus a writer (11/24. 'Journal of\r\nHorticulture' 1861 page 336.) pinched off the leading shoot of a seedling\r\nP. zonale, and it threw out three branches, which differed in the size and\r\ncolour of their leaves and stems; but on all three branches \"the flowers\r\nwere identical,\" except in being largest in the green-stemmed variety, and\r\nsmallest in that with variegated foliage: these three varieties were\r\nsubsequently propagated and distributed. Many branches, and some whole\r\nplants, of a variety called compactum, which bears orange-scarlet flowers,\r\nhave been seen to produce pink flowers. (11/25. W.P. Ayres 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1842 page 791.) Hill's Hector, which is a pale red variety,\r\nproduced a branch with lilac flowers, and some trusses with both red and\r\nlilac flowers. This apparently is a case of reversion, for Hill's Hector\r\nwas a seedling from a lilac variety. (11/26. W.P. Ayres ibid.) Here is a\r\nbetter case of reversion: a variety produced from a complicated cross,\r\nafter having been propagated for five generations by seed, yielded by bud-\r\nvariation three very distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from\r\nplants, \"known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in\r\nquestion.\" (11/27. Dr. Maxwell Masters 'Pop. Science Review' July 1872 page\r\n250.) Of all Pelargoniums, Rollisson's Unique seems to be the most\r\nsportive; its origin is not positively known, but is believed to be from a\r\ncross. Mr. Salter, of Hammersmith, states (11/28. 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1861 page 968.) that he has himself known this purple variety to produce\r\nthe lilac, the rose-crimson or conspicuum, and the red or coccineum\r\nvarieties; the latter has also produced the rose d'amour; so that\r\naltogether four varieties have originated by bud variation from Rollisson's\r\nUnique. Mr. Salter remarks that these four varieties \"may now be considered\r\nas fixed, although they occasionally produce flowers of the original\r\ncolour. This year coccineum has pushed flowers of three different colours,\r\nred, rose, and lilac, upon the same truss, and upon other trusses are\r\nflowers half red and half lilac.\" Besides these four varieties, two other\r\nscarlet Uniques are known to exist, both of which occasionally produce\r\nlilac flowers identical with Rollisson's Unique (11/29. Ibid 1861 page\r\n945.); but one at least of these did not arise through bud-variation, but\r\nis believed to be a seedling from Rollisson's Unique. (11/30. W. Paul\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 968.) There are, also, in the trade\r\n(11/31. Ibid page 945.) two other slightly different varieties, of unknown\r\norigin, of Rollisson's Unique: so that altogether we have a curiously\r\ncomplex case of variation both by buds and seeds. (11/32. For other cases\r\nof bud-variation in this same variety see 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 pages\r\n578, 600, 925. For other distinct cases of bud-variation in the genus\r\nPelargonium see 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 194.) Here is a still more\r\ncomplex case: M. Rafarin states that a pale rose-coloured variety produced\r\na branch bearing deep red flowers. \"Cuttings were taken from this 'sport,'\r\nfrom which 20 plants were raised, which flowered in 1867, when it was found\r\nthat scarcely two were alike.\" Some resembled the parent-form, some\r\nresembled the sport, some bore both kinds of flowers; and even some of the\r\npetals on the same flower were rose-coloured and others red. (11/33. Dr.\r\nMaxwell Masters 'Pop. Science Review' July 1872 page 254.) An English wild\r\nplant, the Geranium pratense, when cultivated in a garden, has been seen to\r\nproduce on the same plant both blue and white, and striped blue and white\r\nflowers. (11/34. Rev. W.T. Bree in Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 1832\r\npage 93.)\r\n\r\nCHRYSANTHEMUM.\r\n\r\nThis plant frequently sports, both by its lateral branches and occasionally\r\nby suckers. A seedling raised by Mr. Salter has produced by bud-variation\r\nsix distinct sorts, five different in colour and one in foliage, all of\r\nwhich are now fixed. (11/35. 'The Chrysanthemum: its History and Culture'\r\nby J. Salter 1865 page 41 etc.) A variety called cedo nulli bears small\r\nyellow flowers, but habitually produces branches with white flowers; and a\r\nspecimen was exhibited, which Prof. T. Dyer saw, before the Horticultural\r\nSociety. The varieties which were first introduced from China were so\r\nexcessively variable, \"that it was extremely difficult to tell which was\r\nthe original colour of the variety, and which was the sport.\" The same\r\nplant would produce one year only buff-coloured, and next year only rose-\r\ncoloured flowers; and then would change again, or produce at the same time\r\nflowers of both colours. These fluctuating varieties are now all lost, and,\r\nwhen a branch sports into a new variety, it can generally be propagated and\r\nkept true; but, as Mr. Salter remarks, \"every sport should be thoroughly\r\ntested in different soils before it can be really considered as fixed, as\r\nmany have been known to run back when planted in rich compost; but when\r\nsufficient care and time are expended in proving, there will exist little\r\ndanger of subsequent disappointment.\" Mr. Salter informs me that with all\r\nthe varieties the commonest kind of bud-variation is the production of\r\nyellow flowers, and, as this is the primordial colour, these cases may be\r\nattributed to reversion. Mr. Salter has given me a list of seven\r\ndifferently coloured chrysanthemums, which have all produced branches with\r\nyellow flowers; but three of them have also sported into other colours.\r\nWith any change of colour in the flower, the foliage generally changes in a\r\ncorresponding manner in lightness or darkness.\r\n\r\nAnother Compositous plant, namely, Centauria cyanus, when cultivated in a\r\ngarden, not unfrequently produces on the same root flowers of four\r\ndifferent colours, viz., blue, white, dark-purple, and parti-coloured.\r\n(11/36. Bree in Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 1832 page 93.) The\r\nflowers of Anthemis also vary on the same plant. (11/37. Bronn 'Geschichte\r\nder Natur' b. 2 s. 123.)\r\n\r\nROSES.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of the Rose are known or are believed to have originated by\r\nbud-variation. (11/38. T. Rivers 'Rose Amateur's Guide' 1837 page 4.) The\r\ncommon double moss-rose was imported into England from Italy about the year\r\n1735. (11/39. Mr. Shailer quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1848 page 759.)\r\nIts origin is unknown, but from analogy it probably arose from the Provence\r\nrose (R. centifolia) by bud-variation; for the branches of the common moss-\r\nrose have several times been known to produce Provence roses, wholly or\r\npartially destitute of moss: I have seen one such instance, and several\r\nothers have been recorded. (11/40. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 1822\r\npage 137; 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page 422.) Mr. Rivers also informs me\r\nthat he raised two or three roses of the Provence class from seed of the\r\nold single moss-rose (11/41. See also Loudon's 'Arboretum' volume 2 page\r\n780.); and this latter kind was produced in 1807 by bud-variation from the\r\ncommon moss-rose. The white moss-rose was also produced in 1788 by an\r\noffset from the common red moss-rose: it was at first pale blush-coloured,\r\nbut became white by continued budding. On cutting down the shoots which had\r\nproduced this white moss-rose, two weak shoots were thrown up, and buds\r\nfrom these yielded the beautiful striped moss-rose. The common moss-rose\r\nhas yielded by bud-variation, besides the old single red moss-rose, the old\r\nscarlet semi-double moss-rose, and the sage-leaf moss-rose, which \"has a\r\ndelicate shell-like form, and is of a beautiful blush colour; it is now\r\n(1852) nearly extinct.\" (11/42. All these statements on the origin of the\r\nseveral varieties of the moss-rose are given on the authority of Mr.\r\nShailer, who, together with his father, was concerned in their original\r\npropagation. See 'Gard. Chronicle' 1852 page 759.) A white moss-rose has\r\nbeen seen to bear a flower half white and half pink. (11/43. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 564.) Although several moss-roses have thus certainly\r\narisen by bud-variation, the greater number probably owe their origin to\r\nseed of moss-roses. For Mr. Rivers informs me that his seedlings from the\r\nold single moss-rose almost always produced moss-roses; and the old single\r\nmoss-rose was, as we have seen, the product by bud-variation of the double\r\nmoss-rose originally imported from Italy. That the original moss-rose was\r\nthe product of bud-variation is probable, from the facts above given and\r\nfrom the de Meaux moss-rose (also a variety of R. centifolia) (11/44.\r\n'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 242.) having appeared as a sporting\r\nbranch on the common rose de Meaux. Prof. Caspary has carefully described\r\n(11/45. 'Shriften der Phys. Oekon. Gesell. zu Konigsberg' February 3, 1865\r\ns. 4. See also Dr. Caspary's paper in 'Transactions of the Hort. Congress\r\nof Amsterdam' 1865.) the case of a six-year-old white moss-rose, which sent\r\nup several suckers, one of which was thorny, and produced red flowers,\r\ndestitute of moss, exactly like those of the Provence rose (R. centifolia):\r\nanother shoot bore both kinds of flowers, and in addition longitudinally\r\nstriped flowers. As this white moss-rose had been grafted on the Provence\r\nrose, Prof. Caspary attributes the above changes to the influence of the\r\nstock; but from the facts already given, and from others to be given, bud-\r\nvariation, with reversion, is probably a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\nMany other instances could be added of roses varying by buds. The white\r\nProvence rose apparently originated in this way. (11/46. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1852 page 759.) M. Carriere states (page 36) that he himself\r\nknows of five varieties thus produced by the Baronne Prevost. The double\r\nand highly-coloured Belladonna rose has produced by suckers both semi-\r\ndouble and almost single white roses (11/47. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume\r\n2 page 242.); whilst suckers from one of these semi-double white roses\r\nreverted to perfectly characterised Belladonnas. In St. Domingo, varieties\r\nof the China rose propagated by cuttings often revert after a year or two\r\ninto the old China rose. (11/48. Sir R. Schomburgk 'Proc. Linn. Soc. Bot.'\r\nvolume 2 page 132.) Many cases have been recorded of roses suddenly\r\nbecoming striped or changing their character by segments: some plants of\r\nthe Comtesse de Chabrillant, which is properly rose-coloured, were\r\nexhibited in 1862 (11/49. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 619.), with\r\ncrimson flakes on a rose ground. I have seen the Beauty of Billiard with a\r\nquarter and with half the flower almost white. 'The Austrian bramble (R.\r\nlutea) not rarely (11/50. Hopkirk 'Flora Anomala' 167.) produces branches\r\nwith pure yellow flowers; and Prof. Henslow has seen exactly half the\r\nflower of a pure yellow, and I have seen narrow yellow streaks on a single\r\npetal, of which the rest was of the usual copper colour.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are highly remarkable. Mr. Rivers, as I am informed by\r\nhim, possessed a new French rose with delicate smooth shoots, pale\r\nglaucous-green leaves, and semi-double pale flesh-coloured flowers striped\r\nwith dark red; and on branches thus characterised there suddenly appeared\r\nin more than one instance, the famous old rose called the Baronne Prevost,\r\nwith its stout thorny shoots, and immense, uniformly and richly coloured\r\ndouble flowers; so that in this case the shoots, leaves, and flowers, all\r\nat once changed their character by bud-variation. According to M. Verlot\r\n(11/51. 'Sur La Production et la Fixation des Varietes' 1865 page 4.), a\r\nvariety called Rosa cannabifolia, which has peculiarly shaped leaflets, and\r\ndiffers from every member of the family in the leaves being opposite\r\ninstead of alternate, suddenly appeared on a plant of R. alba in the\r\ngardens of the Luxembourg. Lastly, \"a running shoot\" was observed by Mr. H.\r\nCurtis (11/52. 'Journal of Horticulture' March 1865 page 233.) on the old\r\nAimee Vibert Noisette, and he budded it on Celine; thus a climbing Aimee\r\nVibert was first produced and afterwards propagated.\r\n\r\nDIANTHUS.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common with the Sweet William (D. barbatus) to see differently\r\ncoloured flowers on the same root; and I have observed on the same truss\r\nfour differently coloured and shaded flowers. Carnations and pinks (D.\r\ncaryophyllus, etc.) occasionally vary by layers; and some kinds are so\r\nlittle certain in character that they are called by floriculturists \"catch-\r\nflowers.\" (11/53. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 135.) Mr. Dickson has\r\nably discussed the \"running\" of particoloured or striped carnations, and\r\nsays it cannot be accounted for by the compost in which they are grown:\r\n\"layers from the same clean flower would come part of them clean and part\r\nfoul, even when subjected to precisely the same treatment; and frequently\r\none flower alone appears influenced by the taint, the remainder coming\r\nperfectly clean.\" (11/54. Ibid 1842 page 55.) This running of the parti-\r\ncoloured flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the original\r\nuniform tint of the species.\r\n\r\nI will briefly mention some other cases of bud-variation to show how many\r\nplants belonging to many orders have varied in their flowers; and many\r\nothers might be added. I have seen on a snap-dragon (Antirrhinum majus)\r\nwhite, pink, and striped flowers on the same plant, and branches with\r\nstriped flowers on a red-coloured variety. On a double stock (Matthiola\r\nincana) I have seen a branch bearing single flowers; and on a dingy-purple\r\ndouble variety of the wall-flower (Cheiranthus cheiri), a branch which had\r\nreverted to the ordinary copper colour. On other branches of the same\r\nplant, some flowers were exactly divided across the middle, one half being\r\npurple and the other coppery; but some of the smaller petals towards the\r\ncentre of these same flowers were purple longitudinally streaked with\r\ncoppery colour, or coppery streaked with purple. A Cyclamen (11/55.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 235.) has been observed to bear white and\r\npink flowers of two forms, the one resembling the Persicum strain, and the\r\nother the Coum strain. Oenothera biennis has been seen (11/56. Gartner\r\n'Bastarderzeugung' s. 305.) bearing flowers of three different colours. The\r\nhybrid Gladiolus colvilii occasionally bears uniformly coloured flowers,\r\nand one case is recorded (11/57. Mr. D. Beaton in 'Cottage Gardener' 1860\r\npage 250.) of all the flowers on a plant thus changing colour. A Fuchsia\r\nhas been seen (11/58. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 page 536.) bearing two\r\nkinds of flowers. Mirabilis jalapa is eminently sportive, sometimes bearing\r\non the same root pure red, yellow, and white flowers, and others striped\r\nwith various combinations of these three colours. (11/59. Braun 'Ray Soc.\r\nBot. Mem.' 1853 page 315; Hopkirk 'Flora Anomala' page 164; Lecoq\r\n'Geograph. Bot. de l'Europe' tome 3 1854 page 405; and 'De la Fecondation'\r\n1862 page 303.) The plants of the Mirabilis, which bear such\r\nextraordinarily variable flowers in most, probably in all, cases, owe their\r\norigin, as shown by Prof. Lecoq, to crosses between differently coloured\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nLEAVES AND SHOOTS.\r\n\r\nChanges, through bud-variation, in fruits and flowers have hitherto been\r\ntreated of; incidentally some remarkable modifications in the leaves and\r\nshoots of the rose and Paritium, and in a lesser degree in the foliage of\r\nthe Pelargonium and Chrysanthemum, have been noticed. I will now add a few\r\nmore cases of variation in leaf-buds. Verlot (11/60. 'Des Varietes' 1865\r\npage 5.) states that on Aralia trifoliata, which properly has leaves with\r\nthree leaflets, branches frequently appear bearing simple leaves of various\r\nforms; these can be propagated by buds or by grafting, and have given rise,\r\nas he states, to several nominal species.\r\n\r\nWith respect to trees, the history of but few of the many varieties with\r\ncurious or ornamental foliage is known; but several probably have\r\noriginated by bud-variation. Here is one case:--An old ash-tree (Fraxinus\r\nexcelsior) in the grounds of Necton, as Mr. Mason states, \"for many years\r\nhas had one bough of a totally different character to the rest of the tree,\r\nor of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being short-jointed and densely\r\ncovered with foliage.\" It was ascertained that this variety could be\r\npropagated by grafts. (11/61. W. Mason in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page\r\n878.) The varieties of some trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved\r\nlaburnum, the parsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved beech,\r\nare apt to revert by buds to the common forms. (11/62. Alex. Braun 'Ray\r\nSoc. Bot. Mem.' 1853 page 315; 'Gardener's Chron.' 1841 page 329.) The\r\nfern-like leaves of the beech sometimes revert only partially, and the\r\nbranches display here and there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like,\r\nand variously shaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so-\r\ncalled heterophyllus varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves\r\nof various forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have\r\noriginated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping willow with\r\nleaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters states that a tree of\r\nthis kind kept true in his garden for twenty-five years, and then threw out\r\na single upright shoot bearing flat leaves. (11/63. Dr. M.T. Masters 'Royal\r\nInstitution Lecture' March 16, 1860.)\r\n\r\nI have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees\r\nwith their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had\r\nopened; and as there was nothing in their exposure or character to account\r\nfor this difference, I presume that they had appeared as bud-variations,\r\nlike the early and late fruit-maturing varieties of the peach and\r\nnectarine.\r\n\r\nCryptogamic plants are liable to bud-variation, for fronds on the same fern\r\noften display remarkable deviations of structure. Spores, which are of the\r\nnature of buds, taken from such abnormal fronds, reproduce, with remarkable\r\nfidelity, the same variety, after passing through the sexual stage. (11/64.\r\nSee Mr. W.K. Bridgeman's curious paper in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.'\r\nDecember 1861; also Mr. J. Scott 'Bot. Soc. Edinburgh' June 12, 1862.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to colour, leaves often become by bud-variation zoned,\r\nblotched, or spotted with white, yellow, and red; and this occasionally\r\noccurs even with plants in a state of nature. Variegation, however, appears\r\nstill more frequently in plants produced from seed; even the cotyledons or\r\nseed-leaves being thus affected. (11/65. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861\r\npage 336; Verlot 'Des Varietes' page 76.) There have been endless disputes\r\nwhether variegation should be considered as a disease. In a future chapter\r\nwe shall see that it is much influenced, both in the case of seedlings and\r\nof mature plants, by the nature of the soil. Plants which have become\r\nvariegated as seedlings, generally transmit their character by seed to a\r\nlarge proportion of their progeny; and Mr. Salter has given me a list of\r\neight genera in which this occurred. (11/66. See also Verlot 'Des Varietes'\r\npage 74.) Sir F. Pollock has given me more precise information: he sowed\r\nseed from a variegated plant of Ballota nigra which was found growing wild,\r\nand thirty per cent of the seedlings were variegated; seed from these\r\nlatter being sown, sixty per cent came up variegated. When branches become\r\nvariegated by bud-variation, and the variety is attempted to be propagated\r\nby seed, the seedlings are rarely variegated: Mr. Salter found this to be\r\nthe case with plants belonging to eleven genera, in which the greater\r\nnumber of the seedlings proved to be green-leaved; yet a few were slightly\r\nvariegated, or were quite white, but none were worth keeping. Variegated\r\nplants, whether originally produced from seeds or buds, can generally be\r\npropagated by budding, grafting, etc.; but all are apt to revert by bud-\r\nvariation to their ordinary foliage. This tendency, however, differs much\r\nin the varieties of even the same species; for instance, the golden-striped\r\nvariety of Euonymus japonicus \"is very liable to run back to the green-\r\nleaved, while the silver-striped variety hardly ever changes.\" (11/67.\r\n'Gardener's Chron.' 1844 page 86.) I have seen a variety of the holly, with\r\nits leaves having a central yellow patch, which had everywhere partially\r\nreverted to the ordinary foliage, so that on the same small branch there\r\nwere many twigs of both kinds. In the pelargonium, and in some other\r\nplants, variegation is generally accompanied by some degree of dwarfing, as\r\nis well exemplified in the \"Dandy\" pelargonium. When such dwarf varieties\r\nsport back by buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage, the dwarfed stature\r\nstill remains. (11/68. Ibid 1861 page 963.) It is remarkable that plants\r\npropagated from branches which have reverted from variegated to plain\r\nleaves (11/69. Ibid 1861 page 433; 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 2.) do not\r\nalways (or never, as one observer asserts) perfectly resemble the original\r\nplain-leaved plant from which the variegated branch arose: it seems that a\r\nplant, in passing by bud-variation from plain leaves to variegated, and\r\nback again from variegated to plain, is generally in some degree affected\r\nso as to assume a slightly different aspect.\r\n\r\nBUD-VARIATION BY SUCKERS, TUBERS, AND BULBS.\r\n\r\nAll the cases hitherto given of bud-variation in fruits, flowers, leaves,\r\nand shoots, have been confined to buds on the stems or branches, with the\r\nexception of a few cases incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the\r\nrose, pelargonium, and chrysanthemum. I will now give a few instances of\r\nvariation in subterranean buds, that is, by suckers, tubers, and bulbs; not\r\nthat there is any essential difference between buds above and beneath the\r\nground. Mr. Salter informs me that two variegated varieties of Phlox\r\noriginated as suckers; but I should not have thought these worth\r\nmentioning, had not Mr. Salter found, after repeated trials, that he could\r\nnot propagate them by \"root-joints,\" whereas, the variegated Tussilago\r\nfarfara can thus be safely propagated (11/70. M. Lemoine quoted in\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 74 has lately observed that the Symphytum\r\nwith variegated leaves cannot be propagated by division of the roots. He\r\nalso found that out of 500 plants of a Phlox with striped flowers, which\r\nhad been propagated by root-division, only seven or eight produced striped\r\nflowers. See also on striped Pelargoniums 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page\r\n1000.); but this latter plant may have originated as a variegated seedling,\r\nwhich would account for its greater fixedness of character. The Barberry\r\n(Berberis vulgaris) offers an analogous case; there is a well-known variety\r\nwith seedless fruit, which can be propagated by cuttings or layers; but\r\nsuckers always revert to the common form, which produces fruit containing\r\nseeds. (11/71. Anderson 'Recreations in Agriculture' volume 5 page 152.) My\r\nfather repeatedly tried this experiment, and always with the same result. I\r\nmay here mention that maize and wheat sometimes produce new varieties from\r\nthe stock or root, as does the sugar-cane. (11/72. For wheat see\r\n'Improvement of the Cereals' by P. Shirreff 1873 page 47. For maize and\r\nsugar-cane Carriere ibid pages 40, 42. With respect to the sugar-cane Mr.\r\nJ. Caldwell of Mauritius says ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1874 page 316) the\r\nRibbon cane has here \"sported into a perfectly green cane and a perfectly\r\nred cane from the same head. I verified this myself, and saw at least 200\r\ninstances in the same plantation, and the fact has completely upset all our\r\npreconceived ideas of the difference of colour being permanent. The\r\nconversion of a striped cane into a green cane was not uncommon, but the\r\nchange into a red cane universally disbelieved, and that both events should\r\noccur in the same plant incredible. I find, however, in Fleischman's\r\n'Report on Sugar Cultivation in Louisiana for 1848 by the American Patent\r\nOffice, the circumstance is mentioned, but he says he never saw it\r\nhimself.\")\r\n\r\nTurning now to tubers: in the common Potato (Solanum tuberosum) a single\r\nbud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety; or, occasionally,\r\nand this is a much more remarkable circumstance, all the eyes in a tuber\r\nvary in the same manner and at the same time, so that the whole tuber\r\nassumes a new character. For instance, a single eye in a tuber of the old\r\nFORTY-FOLD POTATO, which is a purple variety, was observed (11/73.\r\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 page 662.) to become white; this eye was cut\r\nout and planted separately, and the kind has since been largely propagated.\r\nKEMP'S POTATO is properly white, but a plant in Lancashire produced two\r\ntubers which were red, and two which were white; the red kind was\r\npropagated in the usual manner by eyes, and kept true to its new colour,\r\nand, being found a more productive variety, soon became widely known under\r\nthe name of TAYLOR'S FORTY-FOLD. (11/74. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1841 page 814.)\r\nThe old FORTY-FOLD POTATO, as already stated, is a purple variety; but a\r\nplant long cultivated on the same ground produced, not, as in the case\r\nabove given, a single white eye, but a whole white tuber, which has since\r\nbeen propagated and keeps true. (11/75. Ibid 1857 page 613.) Several cases\r\nhave been recorded of large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly\r\nchanging their character. (11/76. Ibid 1857 page 679. See also Philips\r\n'Hist. of Vegetables' volume 2 page 91 for other and similar accounts.)\r\n\r\nDahlias propagated by tubers under the hot climate of St. Domingo vary\r\nmuch; Sir R. Schomburgk gives the case of the \"Butterfly variety,\" which\r\nthe second year produced on the same plant \"double and single flowers; here\r\nwhite petals edged with maroon; there of a uniform deep maroon.\" (11/77.\r\n'Journal of Proc. Linn. Soc.' volume 2 Botany page 132.) Mr. Bree also\r\nmentions a plant \"which bore two different kinds of self-coloured flowers,\r\nas well as a third kind which partook of both colours beautifully\r\nintermixed.\" (11/78. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 1832 page 94.)\r\nAnother case is described of a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a\r\nwhite flower streaked with purple. (11/79. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1850 page 536;\r\nand 1842 page 729.)\r\n\r\nConsidering how long and extensively many Bulbous plants have been\r\ncultivated, and how numerous are the varieties produced from seed, these\r\nplants have not perhaps varied so much by offsets,--that is, by the\r\nproduction of new bulbs,--as might have been expected. With the Hyacinth,\r\nhowever, several instances have been given by M. Carriere. A case also has\r\nbeen recorded of a blue variety which for three successive years gave\r\noffsets producing white flowers with a red centre. (11/80. 'Des Jacinthes'\r\netc. Amsterdam 1768 page 122.) Another hyacinth bore (11/81. 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 212.) on the same truss a perfectly pink and a\r\nperfectly blue flower. I have seen a bulb producing at the same time one\r\nstalk or truss with fine blue flowers, another with fine red flowers, and a\r\nthird with blue flowers on one side and red on the other; several of the\r\nflowers being also longitudinally striped red and blue.\r\n\r\nMr. John Scott informs me that in 1862 Imatophyllum miniatum, in the\r\nBotanic Gardens of Edinburgh, threw up a sucker which differed from the\r\nnormal form, in the leaves being two-ranked instead of four-ranked. The\r\nleaves were also smaller, with the upper surface raised instead of being\r\nchannelled.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of TULIPS, seedlings are raised, called selfs or\r\nbreeders, which, \"consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow bottom.\r\nThese, being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil, become broken or\r\nvariegated and produce new varieties. The time that elapses before they\r\nbreak varies from one to twenty years or more, and sometimes this change\r\nnever takes place.\" (11/82. Loudon's 'Encyclopaedia of Gardening' page\r\n1024.) The broken or variegated colours which give value to all tulips are\r\ndue to bud-variation; for although the Bybloemens and some other kinds have\r\nbeen raised from several distinct breeders, yet all the Baguets are said to\r\nhave come from a single breeder or seedling. This bud-variation, in\r\naccordance with the views of MM. Vilmorin and Verlot (11/83. 'Production\r\ndes Varietes' 1865 p. 63.) is probably an attempt to revert to that uniform\r\ncolour which is natural to the species. A tulip, however, which has already\r\nbecome broken, when treated with too strong manure, is liable to flush or\r\nlose by a second act of reversion its variegated colours. Some kinds, as\r\nImperatrix Florum, are much more liable than others to flushing; and Mr.\r\nDickson maintains (11/84. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 782; 1842 page\r\n55.) that this can no more be accounted for than the variation of any other\r\nplant. He believes that English growers, from care in choosing seed from\r\nbroken flowers instead of from plain flowers, have to a certain extent\r\ndiminished the tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or secondary\r\nreversion. Iris xiphium, according to M. Carriere (page 65), behaves in\r\nnearly the same manner, as do so many tulips.\r\n\r\nDuring two consecutive years all the early flowers in a bed of Tigridia\r\nconchiflora (11/85. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1849 page 565.) resembled those of\r\nthe old T. pavonia; but the later flowers assumed their proper colour of\r\nfine yellow, spotted with crimson. An apparently authentic account has been\r\npublished (11/86. 'Transact. Lin. Soc.' volume 2 page 354.) of two forms of\r\nHemerocallis, which have been universally considered as distinct species,\r\nchanging into each other; for the roots of the large-flowered tawny H.\r\nfulva, being divided and planted in a different soil and place, produced\r\nthe small-flowered H. flava, as well as some intermediate forms. It is\r\ndoubtful whether such cases as these latter, as well as the \"flushing\" of\r\nbroken tulips and the \"running\" of particoloured carnations,--that is,\r\ntheir more or less complete return to a uniform tint,--ought to be classed\r\nunder bud-variation, or ought to be retained for the chapter in which I\r\ntreat of the direct action of the conditions of life on organic beings.\r\nThese cases, however, have this much in bud-variation, that the change is\r\neffected through buds and not through seminal reproduction. But, on the\r\nother hand, there is this difference--that in ordinary cases of bud-\r\nvariation, one bud alone changes, whilst in the foregoing cases all the\r\nbuds on the same plant were modified together. With the potato, we have\r\nseen an intermediate case, for all the eyes in one tuber simultaneously\r\nchanged their character.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with a few allied cases, which may be ranked either under\r\nbud-variation, or under the direct action of the conditions of life. When\r\nthe common Hepatica is transplanted from its native woods, the flowers\r\nchange colour, even during the first year. (11/87. Godron 'De l'Espece'\r\ntome 2 page 84.) It is notorious that the improved varieties of the\r\nHeartsease (Viola tricolor), when transplanted, often produce flowers\r\nwidely different in size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a\r\nlarge uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it\r\nthen produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower petals\r\nyellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple spots, and\r\nultimately, towards the end of the same summer, by the original large dark\r\npurple flowers. The slight changes which some fruit-trees undergo from\r\nbeing grafted and regrafted on various stocks (11/88. M. Carriere has\r\nlately described in the 'Revue Horticole' December 1, 1866 page 457, an\r\nextraordinary case. He twice inserted grafts of the Aria vestita on thorn-\r\ntrees (epines) growing in pots; and the grafts, as they grew, produced\r\nshoots with bark, buds, leaves, petioles, petals, and flower-stalks, all\r\nwidely different from those of the Aria. The grafted shoots were also much\r\nhardier, and flowered earlier, than those on the ungrafted Aria.) were\r\nconsidered by Andrew Knight (11/89. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page\r\n160.) as closely allied to \"sporting branches,\" or bud-variations. Again,\r\nwe have the case of young fruit-trees changing their character as they grow\r\nold; seedling pears, for instance, lose with age their spines and improve\r\nin the flavour of their fruit. Weeping birch-trees, when grafted on the\r\ncommon variety, do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow\r\nold: on the other hand, I shall hereafter give the case of some weeping\r\nashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth. All\r\nsuch changes, dependent on age, may be compared with the changes, alluded\r\nto in the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as in the case\r\nof the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in youth, whilst they\r\nclosely resemble each other in old age; and as with certain oaks, and with\r\nsome varieties of the lime and hawthorn. (11/90. For the cases of oaks see\r\nAlph. De Candolle in 'Bibl. Univers.' Geneva November 1862; for limes etc.\r\nLoudon's 'Gard. Mag.' volume 11 1835 page 503.)]\r\n\r\nGRAFT-HYBRIDS.\r\n\r\nBefore giving a summary on Bud-variation I will discuss some singular and\r\nanomalous cases, which are more or less closely related to this same\r\nsubject. I will begin with the famous case of Adam's laburnum or Cytisus\r\nadami, a form or hybrid intermediate between two very distinct species,\r\nnamely, C. laburnum and purpureus, the common and purple laburnum; but as\r\nthis tree has often been described, I will be as brief as I can.\r\n\r\n[Throughout Europe, in different soils and under different climates,\r\nbranches on this tree have repeatedly and suddenly reverted to the two\r\nparent species in their flowers and leaves. To behold mingled on the same\r\ntree tufts of dingy-red, bright yellow, and purple flowers, borne on\r\nbranches having widely different leaves and manner of growth, is a\r\nsurprising sight. The same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers; and\r\nI have seen a single flower exactly divided into halves, one side being\r\nbright yellow and the other purple; so that one half of the standard-petal\r\nwas yellow and of larger size, and the other half purple and smaller. In\r\nanother flower the whole corolla was bright yellow, but exactly half the\r\ncalyx was purple. In another, one of the dingy-red wing-petals had a narrow\r\nbright yellow stripe on it; and lastly, in another flower, one of the\r\nstamens, which had become slightly foliaceous, was half yellow and half\r\npurple; so that the tendency to segregation of character or reversion\r\naffects even single parts and organs. (11/91. For analogous facts see Braun\r\n'Rejuvenescence' in 'Ray Soc. Bot. Mem.' 1853 page 320; and 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1842 page 397; also Braun in 'Sitzungsberichte der Ges.\r\nnaturforschender Freunde' June 1873 page 63.) The most remarkable fact\r\nabout this tree is that in its intermediate state, even when growing near\r\nboth parent-species, it is quite sterile; but when the flowers become pure\r\nyellow or pure purple they yield seed. I believe that the pods from the\r\nyellow flowers yield a full complement of seed; they certainly yield a\r\nlarger number. Two seedlings raised by Mr. Herbert from such seed (11/92.\r\n'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 2 1847 page 100.) exhibited a purple tinge\r\non the stalks of their flowers; but several seedlings raised by myself\r\nresembled in every character the common laburnum, with the exception that\r\nsome of them had remarkably long racemes: these seedlings were perfectly\r\nfertile. That such purity of character and fertility should be suddenly\r\nreacquired from so hybridised and sterile a form is an astonishing\r\nphenomenon. The branches with purple flowers appear at first sight exactly\r\nto resemble those of C. purpureus; but on careful comparison I found that\r\nthey differed from the pure species in the shoots being thicker, the leaves\r\na little broader, and the flowers slightly shorter, with the corolla and\r\ncalyx less brightly purple: the basal part of the standard-petal also\r\nplainly showed a trace of the yellow stain. So that the flowers, at least\r\nin this instance, had not perfectly recovered their true character; and in\r\naccordance with this, they were not perfectly fertile, for many of the pods\r\ncontained no seed, some produced one, and very few contained as many as two\r\nseeds; whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure C. purpureus in my garden\r\ncontained three, four, and five fine seeds. The pollen, moreover, was very\r\nimperfect, a multitude of grains being small and shrivelled; and this is a\r\nsingular fact; for, as we shall immediately see, the pollen-grains in the\r\ndingy-red and sterile flowers on the parent-tree, were, in external\r\nappearance, in a much better state, and included very few shrivelled\r\ngrains. Although the pollen of the reverted purple flowers was in so poor a\r\ncondition, the ovules were well formed, and the seeds, when mature,\r\ngerminated freely with me. Mr. Herbert raised plants from seeds of the\r\nreverted purple flowers, and they differed a VERY LITTLE from the usual\r\nstate of C. purpureus. Some which I raised in the same manner did not\r\ndiffer at all, either in the character of their flowers or of the whole\r\nbush, from the pure C. purpureus. Prof. Caspary has examined the ovules of\r\nthe dingy-red and sterile flowers in several plants of C. adami on the\r\nContinent (11/93. See 'Transact. of Hort. Congress of Amsterdam' 1865; but\r\nI owe most of the following information to Prof. Caspary's letters.) and\r\nfinds them generally monstrous. In three plants examined by me in England,\r\nthe ovules were likewise monstrous, the nucleus varying much in shape, and\r\nprojecting irregularly beyond the proper coats. The pollen grains, on the\r\nother hand, judging from their external appearance, were remarkably good,\r\nand readily protruded their tubes. By repeatedly counting, under the\r\nmicroscope, the proportional number of bad grains, Prof. Caspary\r\nascertained that only 2.5 per cent were bad, which is a less proportion\r\nthan in the pollen of three pure species of Cytisus in their cultivated\r\nstate, viz., C. purpureus, laburnum, and alpinus. Although the pollen of C.\r\nadami is thus in appearance good, it does not follow, according to M.\r\nNaudin's observation (11/94. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page\r\n143.) on Mirabilis, that it would be functionally effective. The fact of\r\nthe ovules of C. adami being monstrous, and the pollen apparently sound, is\r\nall the more remarkable, because it is opposed to what usually occurs not\r\nonly with most hybrids (11/95. See on this head Naudin ibid page 141.), but\r\nwith two hybrids in the same genus, namely in C. purpureo-elongatus, and C.\r\nalpino-laburnum. In both these hybrids, the ovules, as observed by Prof.\r\nCaspary and myself, were well-formed, whilst many of the pollen-grains were\r\nill-formed; in the latter hybrid 20.3 per cent, and in the former no less\r\nthan 84.8 per cent of the grains were ascertained by Prof. Caspary to be\r\nbad. This unusual condition of the male and female reproductive elements in\r\nC. adami has been used by Prof. Caspary as an argument against this plant\r\nbeing considered as an ordinary hybrid produced from seed; but we should\r\nremember that with hybrids the ovules have not been examined nearly so\r\nfrequently as the pollen, and they may be much oftener imperfect than is\r\ngenerally supposed. Dr. E. Bornet, of Antibes, informs me (through Mr. J.\r\nTraherne Moggridge) that with hybrid Cisti the ovarium is frequently\r\ndeformed, the ovules being in some cases quite absent, and in other cases\r\nincapable of fertilisation.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been propounded to account for the origin of C.\r\nadami, and for the transformations which it undergoes. The whole case has\r\nbeen attributed by some authors to bud-variation; but considering the wide\r\ndifference between C. laburnum and purpureus, both of which are natural\r\nspecies, and considering the sterility of the intermediate form, this view\r\nmay be summarily rejected. We shall presently see that, with hybrid plants,\r\ntwo embryos differing in their characters may be developed within the same\r\nseed and cohere; and it has been supposed that C. adami thus originated.\r\nMany botanists maintain that C. adami is a hybrid produced in the common\r\nway by seed, and that it has reverted by buds to its two parent-forms.\r\nNegative results are not of much value; but Reisseck, Caspary, and myself,\r\ntried in vain to cross C. laburnum and purpureus; when I fertilised the\r\nformer with pollen of the latter, I had the nearest approach to success,\r\nfor pods were formed, but in sixteen days after the withering of the\r\nflowers, they fell off. Nevertheless, the belief that C. adami is a\r\nspontaneously produced hybrid between these two species is supported by the\r\nfact that such hybrids have arisen in this genus. In a bed of seedlings\r\nfrom C. elongatus, which grew near to C. purpureus, and was probably\r\nfertilised by it through the agency of insects (for these, as I know by\r\nexperiment, play an important part in the fertilisation of the laburnum),\r\nthe sterile hybrid C. purpureo-elongatus appeared. (11/96. Braun in 'Bot.\r\nMem. Ray. Soc.' 1853 page 23.) Thus, also, Waterer's laburnum, the C.\r\nalpino-laburnum (11/97. This hybrid has never been described. It is exactly\r\nintermediate in foliage, time of flowering, dark striae at the base of the\r\nstandard petal, hairiness of the ovarium, and in almost every other\r\ncharacter, between C. laburnum and alpinus; but it approaches the former\r\nspecies more nearly in colour, and exceeds it in the length of the racemes.\r\nWe have before seen that 20.3 per cent of its pollen-grains are ill-formed\r\nand worthless. My plant, though growing not above thirty or forty yards\r\nfrom both parent-species, during some seasons yielded no good seeds; but in\r\n1866 it was unusually fertile, and its long racemes produced from one to\r\noccasionally even four pods. Many of the pods contained no good seeds, but\r\ngenerally they contained a single apparently good seed, sometimes two, and\r\nin one case three seeds. Some of these seeds germinated, and I raised two\r\ntrees from them; one resembles the present form; the other has a remarkable\r\ndwarf character with small leaves, but has not yet flowered.) spontaneously\r\nappeared, as I am informed by Mr. Waterer, in a bed of seedlings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have a clear and distinct account given to Poiteau\r\n(11/98. 'Annales de la Soc. de l'Hort. de Paris' tome 7 1830 page 93.) by\r\nM. Adam, who raised the plant, showing that C. adami is not an ordinary\r\nhybrid; but is what may be called a graft-hybrid, that is, one produced\r\nfrom the united cellular tissue of two distinct species. M. Adam inserted\r\nin the usual manner a shield of the bark of C. purpureus into a stock of C.\r\nlaburnum; and the bud lay dormant, as often happens, for a year; the shield\r\nthen produced many buds and shoots, one of which grew more upright and\r\nvigorous with larger leaves than the shoots of C. purpureus, and was\r\nconsequently propagated. Now it deserves especial notice that these plants\r\nwere sold by M. Adam, as a variety of C. purpureus, before they had\r\nflowered; and the account was published by Poiteau after the plants had\r\nflowered, but before they had exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert\r\ninto the two parent species. So that there was no conceivable motive for\r\nfalsification, and it is difficult to see how there could have been any\r\nerror. (11/99. An account was given in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857\r\npages 382, 400, of a common laburnum on which grafts of C. purpureus had\r\nbeen inserted, and which gradually assumed the character of C. adami; but I\r\nhave little doubt that C. adami had been sold to the purchaser, who was not\r\na botanist, in the place of C. purpureus. I have ascertained that this\r\noccurred in another instance.) If we admit as true M. Adam's account, we\r\nmust admit the extraordinary fact that two distinct species can unite by\r\ntheir cellular tissue, and subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and\r\nsterile flowers intermediate in character between the scion and stock, and\r\nproducing buds liable to reversion; in short, resembling in every important\r\nrespect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction.]\r\n\r\nI will therefore give all the facts which I have been able to collect on\r\nthe formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties, without the\r\nintervention of the sexual organs. For if, as I am now convinced, this is\r\npossible, it is a most important fact, which will sooner or later change\r\nthe views held by physiologists with respect to sexual reproduction. A\r\nsufficient body of facts will afterwards be adduced, showing that the\r\nsegregation or separation of the characters of the two parent-forms by bud-\r\nvariation, as in the case of Cytisus adami, is not an unusual though a\r\nstriking phenomenon. We shall further see that a whole bud may thus revert,\r\nor only half, or some smaller segment.\r\n\r\n[The famous bizzarria Orange offers a strictly parallel case to that of\r\nCytisus adami. The gardener who in 1644 in Florence raised this tree,\r\ndeclared that it was a seedling which had been grafted; and after the graft\r\nhad perished, the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria. Gallesio, who\r\ncarefully examined several living specimens and compared them with the\r\ndescription given by the original describer, P. Nato (11/100. Gallesio 'Gli\r\nAgrumi dei Giard. Bot. Agrar. di. Firenze' 1839 page 11. In his 'Traite du\r\nCitrus' 1811 page 146, he speaks as if the compound fruit consisted in part\r\nof a lemon, but this apparently was a mistake.), states that the tree\r\nproduces at the same time leaves, flowers, and fruit identical with the\r\nbitter orange and with the citron of Florence, and likewise compound fruit,\r\nwith the two kinds either blended together, both externally and internally,\r\nor segregated in various ways. This tree can be propagated by cuttings, and\r\nretains its diversified character. The so-called trifacial orange of\r\nAlexandria and Smyrna (11/101. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1855 page 628. See also\r\nProf. Caspary in 'Transact. Hort. Congress of Amsterdam' 1865.) resembles\r\nin its general nature the bizzarria, and differs only in the orange being\r\nof the sweet kind; this and the citron are blended together in the same\r\nfruit, or are separately produced on the same tree; nothing is known of its\r\norigin. In regard to the bizzarria, many authors believe that it is a\r\ngraft-hybrid; Gallesio, on the other hand, thinks that it is an ordinary\r\nhybrid, with the habit of partially reverting by buds to the two parent-\r\nforms; and we have seen that the species in this genus often cross\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that when the variegated Jessamine is budded on the common\r\nkind, the stock sometimes produces buds bearing variegated leaves: Mr.\r\nRivers, as he informs me, has seen instances of this. The same thing occurs\r\nwith the Oleander. (11/102. Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 611 gives many\r\nreferences on this subject.) Mr. Rivers, on the authority of a trustworthy\r\nfriend, states that some buds of a golden-variegated ash, which were\r\ninserted into common ashes, all died except one; but the ash-stocks were\r\naffected (11/103. A nearly similar account was given by Brabley in 1724 in\r\nhis 'Treatise on Husbandry' volume 1 page 199.) and produced, both above\r\nand below the points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead\r\nbuds, shoots which bore variegated leaves. Mr. J. Anderson Henry has\r\ncommunicated to me a nearly similar case: Mr. Brown, of Perth, observed\r\nmany years ago, in a Highland glen, an ash-tree with yellow leaves; and\r\nbuds taken from this tree were inserted into common ashes, which in\r\nconsequence were affected, and produced the Blotched Breadalbane Ash. This\r\nvariety has been propagated, and has preserved its character during the\r\nlast fifty years. Weeping ashes, also, were budded on the affected stocks,\r\nand became similarly variegated. It has been repeatedly proved that several\r\nspecies of Abutilon, on which the variegated A. thompsonii has been\r\ngrafted, become variegated. (11/104. Morren 'Bull. de l'Acad. R. des\r\nSciences de Belgique' 2de series tome 28 1869 page 434. Also Magnus\r\n'Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde, Berlin' February 21, 1871 page 13;\r\nibid June 21, 1870 and October 17, 1871. Also 'Bot. Zeitung' February 24,\r\n1871.)\r\n\r\nMany authors consider variegation as the result of disease; and the\r\nforegoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of the inoculation of\r\na disease or some weakness. This has been almost proved to be the case by\r\nMorren in the excellent paper just referred to, who shows that even a leaf\r\ninserted by its footstalk into the bark of the stock is sufficient to\r\ncommunicate variegation to it, though the leaf soon perishes. Even fully\r\nformed leaves on the stock of Abutilon are sometimes affected by the graft\r\nand become variegated. Variegation is much influenced, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, by the nature of the soil in which the plants are grown; and\r\nit does not seem improbable that whatever change in the sap or tissues\r\ncertain soils induce, whether or not called a disease, might spread from\r\nthe inserted piece of bark to the stock. But a change of this kind cannot\r\nbe considered to be of the nature of a graft-hybrid.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the hazel with dark-purple leaves, like those of the\r\ncopper-beech: no one has attributed this colour to disease, and it\r\napparently is only an exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on the\r\nleaves of the common hazel. When this variety is grafted on the common\r\nhazel (11/105. Loudon's 'Arboretum' volume 4 page 2595.), it sometimes\r\ncolours, as has been asserted, the leaves below the graft; although\r\nnegative evidence is not of much value, I may add that Mr. Rivers, who has\r\npossessed hundreds of such grafted trees, has never seen an instance.\r\n\r\nGartner (11/106. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 619.) quotes two separate accounts\r\nof branches of dark and white-fruited vines which had been united in\r\nvarious ways, such as being split longitudinally, and then joined, etc.;\r\nand these branches produced distinct bunches of grapes of the two colours,\r\nand other bunches with berries, either striped, or of an intermediate and\r\nnew tint. Even the leaves in one case were variegated. These facts are the\r\nmore remarkable because Andrew Knight never succeeded in raising variegated\r\ngrapes by fertilising white kinds by pollen of dark kinds; though, as we\r\nhave seen, he obtained seedlings with variegated fruits and leaves, by\r\nfertilising a white variety by the already variegated dark Aleppo grape.\r\nGartner attributes the above-quoted cases merely to bud-variation; but it\r\nis a strange coincidence that the branches which had been grafted in a\r\npeculiar manner should alone thus have varied; and H. Adorne de Tscharner\r\npositively asserts that he produced the described result more than once,\r\nand could do so at will, by splitting and uniting the branches in the\r\nmanner described by him.\r\n\r\nI should not have quoted the following case had not the author of 'Des\r\nJacinthes' (11/107. Amsterdam 1768 page 124.) impressed me with the belief\r\nnot only of his extensive knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that\r\nbulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, and that they will grow\r\ntogether and throw up a united stem (and this I have myself seen) with\r\nflowers of the two colours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point\r\nis, that flowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended\r\ntogether, which makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended\r\ncolours of the grapes on the united vine branches.\r\n\r\nIn the case of roses it is supposed that several graft-hybrids have been\r\nformed, but there is much doubt about these cases, owing to the frequency\r\nof ordinary bud-variations. The most trustworthy instance known to me is\r\none, recorded by Mr. Poynter (11/108. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1860 page 672\r\nwith a woodcut.) who assures me in a letter of the entire accuracy of the\r\nstatement. Rosa devoniensis had been budded some years previously on a\r\nwhite Banksian rose; and from the much enlarged point of junction, whence\r\nthe Devoniensis and Banksian still continued to grow, a third branch\r\nissued, which was neither pure Banksian nor pure Devoniensis, but partook\r\nof the character of both; the flowers resembled, but were superior in\r\ncharacter to those of the variety called Lamarque (one of the Noisettes),\r\nwhile the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to those of the\r\nBanksian rose, with the exception that the longer and more robust shoots\r\nwere furnished with prickles. This rose was exhibited before the Floral\r\nCommittee of the Horticultural Society of London. Dr. Lindley examined it\r\nand concluded that it had certainly been produced by the mingling of R.\r\nbanksiae with some rose like R. devoniensis, \"for while it was very greatly\r\nincreased in vigour and in size of all the parts, the leaves were half-way\r\nbetween a Banksian and Tea-scented rose.\" It appears that rose-growers were\r\npreviously aware that the Banksian rose sometimes affects other roses. As\r\nMr. Poynter's new variety is intermediate in its fruit and foliage between\r\nthe stock and scion, and as it arose from the point of junction between the\r\ntwo, it is very improbable that it owes its origin to mere bud-variation,\r\nindependently of the mutual influence of the stock and scion.\r\n\r\nLastly, with respect to potatoes. Mr. R. Trail stated in 1867 before the\r\nBotanical Society of Edinburgh (and has since given me fuller information),\r\nthat several years ago he cut about sixty blue and white potatoes into\r\nhalves through the eyes or buds, and then carefully joined them, destroying\r\nat the same time the other eyes. Some of these united tubers produced\r\nwhite, and others blue tubers; some, however, produced tubers partly white\r\nand partly blue; and the tubers from about four or five were regularly\r\nmottled with the two colours. In these latter cases we may conclude that a\r\nstem had been formed by the union of the bisected buds, that is, by graft-\r\nhybridisation.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Botanische Zeitung' (May 16, 1868), Professor Hildebrand gives an\r\naccount with a coloured figure, of his experiments on two varieties which\r\nwere found during the same season to be constant in character, namely, a\r\nsomewhat elongated rough-skinned red potato and a rounded smooth white one.\r\nHe inserted buds reciprocally into both kinds, destroying the other buds.\r\nHe thus raised two plants, and each of these produced a tuber intermediate\r\nin character between the two parent-forms. That from the red bud grafted\r\ninto the white tuber, was at one end red and rough, as the whole tuber\r\nought to have been if not affected; in the middle it was smooth with red\r\nstripes, and at the other end smooth and altogether white like that of the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, who had received several accounts of potatoes having been\r\ngrafted by wedge-shaped pieces of one variety inserted into another, though\r\nsceptical on the subject, made twenty-four experiments which he described\r\nin detail before the Horticultural Society. (11/109. 'Gardener's Chronicle'\r\n1869 page 220.) He thus raised many new varieties, some like the graft or\r\nlike the stock; others having an intermediate character. Several persons\r\nwitnessed the digging up of the tubers from these graft-hybrids; and one of\r\nthem, Mr. Jameson, a large dealer in potatoes, writes thus, \"They were such\r\na mixed lot, as I have never before or since seen. They were of all colours\r\nand shapes, some very ugly and some very handsome.\" Another witness says\r\n\"some were round, some kidney, pink-eyed kidney, piebald, and mottled red\r\nand purple, of all shapes and sizes.\" Some of these varieties have been\r\nfound valuable, and have been extensively propagated. Mr. Jameson took away\r\na large piebald potato which he cut into five sets and propagated; these\r\nyielded round, white, red, and piebald potatoes.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzpatrick followed a different plan (11/110. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1869\r\npage 335.); he grafted together not the tubers but the young stems of\r\nvarieties producing black, white, and red potatoes. The tubers borne by\r\nthree of these twin or united plants were coloured in an extraordinary\r\nmanner; one was almost exactly half black and half white, so that some\r\npersons on seeing it thought that two potatoes had been divided and\r\nrejoined; other tubers were half red and half white, or curiously mottled\r\nwith red and white, or with red and black, according to the colours of the\r\ngraft and stock.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. Fenn is of much value, as he is \"a well known potato-\r\ngrower\" who has raised many new varieties by crossing different kinds in\r\nthe ordinary manner. He considers it \"demonstrated\" that new, intermediate\r\nvarieties can be produced by grafting the tubers, though he doubts whether\r\nsuch will prove valuable. (11/111. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1869 page 1018\r\nwith remarks by Dr. Masters on the adhesion of the united wedges. See also\r\nibid 1870 pages 1277, 1283.) He made many trials and laid the results,\r\nexhibiting specimens, before the Horticultural Society. Not only were the\r\ntubers affected, some being smooth and white at one end and rough and red\r\nat the other, but the stems and leaves were modified in their manner of\r\ngrowth, colour and precocity. Some of these graft-hybrids after being\r\npropagated for three years still showed in their haulms their new\r\ncharacter, different from that of the kind from which the eyes had been\r\ntaken. Mr. Fenn gave twelve of the tubers of the third generation to Mr.\r\nAlex. Dean, who grew them, and was thus converted into a believer in graft-\r\nhybridisation, having previously been a complete sceptic. For comparison he\r\nplanted the pure parent-forms alongside the twelve tubers; and found that\r\nmany of the plants from the latter (11/112. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1871 page\r\n837.) were intermediate between the two parent-forms in precocity, in the\r\ntallness, uprightness, jointing, and robustness of the stems, and in the\r\nsize and colour of the leaves.\r\n\r\nAnother experimentalist, Mr. Rintoul, grafted no less than fifty-nine\r\ntubers, which differed in shape (some being kidneys) in smoothness and\r\ncolour (11/113. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1870 page 1506.) and many of the\r\nplants thus raised \"were intermediate in the tubers as well as in the\r\nhaulms.\" He describes the more striking cases.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 I received a letter from Mr. Merrick, of Boston, U.S.A., who states\r\nthat, \"Mr. Fearing Burr, a very careful experimenter and author of a much\r\nvalued book, 'The Garden Vegetables of America' has succeeded in producing\r\ndistinctly mottled and most curious potatoes--evidently graft-hybrids, by\r\ninserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the substance of white ones,\r\nafter removing the eyes of the latter. I have seen the potatoes, and they\r\nare very curious.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the experiments made in Germany, since the publication\r\nof Prof. Hildebrand's paper. Herr Magnus relates (11/114. 'Sitzungsberichte\r\nder Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin' October 17, 1871.) the\r\nresults of numerous trials made by Herren Reuter and Lindemuth, both\r\nattached to the Royal Gardens of Berlin. They inserted the eyes of red\r\npotatoes into white ones, and vice versa. Many different forms partaking of\r\nthe characters of the inserted bud and of the stock were thus obtained; for\r\ninstance, some of the tubers were white with red eyes.\r\n\r\nHerr Magnus also exhibited in the following year before the same Society\r\n(November 19, 1872), the produce of grafts between black, white, and red\r\npotatoes, made by Dr. Neubert. These were made by uniting not the tubers\r\nbut the young stems, as was done by Mr. Fitzpatrick. The result was\r\nremarkable, inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were intermediate in\r\ncharacter, though in a variable degree. Those between the black and the\r\nwhite or the red were the most striking in appearance. Some from between\r\nthe white and red had one half of one colour and the other half of the\r\nother colour.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting of the society Herr Magnus communicated the results of\r\nDr. Heimann's experiments in grafting together the tubers of red Saxon,\r\nblue, and elongated white potatoes. The eyes were removed by a cylindrical\r\ninstrument, and inserted into corresponding holes in other varieties. The\r\nplants thus produced yielded a great number of tubers, which were\r\nintermediate between the two parent-forms in shape, and in the colour both\r\nof the flesh and skin.\r\n\r\nHerr Reuter experimented (11/115. Ibid November 17, 1874. See also\r\nexcellent remarks by Herr Magnus.) by inserting wedges of the elongated\r\nWhite Mexican potato into a Black Kidney potato. Both sorts are known to be\r\nvery constant, and differ much not only in form and colour, but in the eyes\r\nof the Black Kidney being deeply sunk, whereas those of the White Mexican\r\nare superficial and of a different shape. The tubers produced by these\r\nhybrids were intermediate in colour and form; and some which resembled in\r\nform the graft, i.e. the Mexican, had eyes deeply sunk and of the same\r\nshape as in the stock or Black Kidney.]\r\n\r\nAny one who will attentively consider the abstract now given, of the\r\nexperiments made by many observers in several countries, will, I think, be\r\nconvinced that by grafting two varieties of the potato together in various\r\nways, hybridised plants can be produced. It should be observed that several\r\nof the experimentalists are scientific horticulturists, and some of them\r\npotato-growers on a large scale, who, though beforehand sceptical, have\r\nbeen fully convinced of the possibility, even of the ease, of making graft-\r\nhybrids. The only way of escaping from this conclusion is to attribute all\r\nthe many recorded cases to simple bud-variation. Undoubtedly the potato, as\r\nwe have seen in this chapter, does sometimes, though not often, vary by\r\nbuds; but it should be especially noted that it is experienced potato-\r\ngrowers, whose business it is to look out for new varieties, who have\r\nexpressed unbounded astonishment at the number of new forms produced by\r\ngraft-hybridisation. It may be argued that it is merely the operation of\r\ngrafting, and not the union of two kinds, which causes so extraordinary an\r\namount of bud-variation; but this objection is at once answered by the fact\r\nthat potatoes are habitually propagated by the tubers being cut into\r\npieces, and the sole difference in the case of graft-hybrids is that either\r\na half or a smaller segment or a cylinder is placed in close opposition\r\nwith the tissue of another variety. Moreover, in two cases, the young stems\r\nwere grafted together, and the plants thus united yielded the same results\r\nas when the tubers were united. It is an argument of the greatest weight\r\nthat when varieties are produced by simple bud-variation, they frequently\r\npresent quite new characters; whereas in all the numerous cases above\r\ngiven, as Herr Magnus likewise insists, the graft-hybrids are intermediate\r\nin character between the two forms employed. That such a result should\r\nfollow if the one kind did not affect the other is incredible.\r\n\r\nCharacters of all kinds are affected by graft hybridisation, in whatever\r\nway the grafting may have been effected. The plants thus raised yield\r\ntubers which partake of the widely different colours, form, state of\r\nsurface, position and shape of the eye of the parents; and according to two\r\ncareful observers they are also intermediate in certain constitutional\r\npeculiarities. But we should bear in mind that in all the varieties of the\r\npotato, the tubers differ much more than any other part.\r\n\r\nThe potato affords the best evidence of the possibility of the formation of\r\ngraft-hybrids, but we must not overlook the account given of the origin of\r\nthe famous Cytisus adami by M. Adam, who had no conceivable motive for\r\ndeception, and the exactly parallel account of the origin of the Bizzarria\r\norange, namely by graft-hybridisation. Nor must the cases be undervalued in\r\nwhich different varieties or species of vines, hyacinths and roses, have\r\nbeen grafted together, and have yielded intermediate forms. It is evident\r\nthat graft-hybrids can be made much more easily with some plants, as the\r\npotato, than with others, for instance our common fruit trees; for these\r\nlatter have been grafted by the million during many centuries, and though\r\nthe graft is often slightly affected, it is very doubtful whether this may\r\nnot be accounted for, merely by a more or less free supply of nutriment.\r\nNevertheless, the cases above given seem to me to prove that under certain\r\nunknown conditions graft-hybridisation can be effected.\r\n\r\nHerr Magnus asserts with much truth that graft-hybrids resemble in all\r\nrespects seminal hybrids, including their great diversity of character.\r\nThere is, however, a partial exception, inasmuch as the characters of the\r\ntwo parent forms are not often homogeneously blended together in graft-\r\nhybrids. They much more commonly appear in a segregated condition,--that\r\nis, in segments either at first, or subsequently through reversion. It\r\nwould seem that the reproductive elements are not so completely blended by\r\ngrafting as by sexual generation. But segregation of this kind occurs by no\r\nmeans rarely, as will be immediately shown, in seminal hybrids. Finally it\r\nmust, I think, be admitted that we learn from the foregoing cases a highly\r\nimportant physiological fact, namely, that the elements that go to the\r\nproduction of a new being, are not necessarily formed by the male and\r\nfemale organs. They are present in the cellular tissue in such a state that\r\nthey can unite without the aid of the sexual organs, and thus give rise to\r\na new bud partaking of the characters of the two parent-forms.\r\n\r\nON THE SEGREGATION OF THE PARENTAL CHARACTERS IN SEMINAL HYBRIDS BY BUD-\r\nVARIATION.\r\n\r\nI will now give a sufficient number of cases to show that segregation of\r\nthis kind, namely, by buds, may occur in ordinary hybrids raised from seed.\r\n\r\n[Hybrids were raised by Gartner between Tropaeolum minus and majus (11/116.\r\n'Bastarderzeugung' s. 549. It is, however, doubtful whether these plants\r\nshould be ranked as species or varieties.) which at first produced flowers\r\nintermediate in size, colour, and structure between their two parents; but\r\nlater in the season some of these plants produced flowers in all respects\r\nlike those of the mother-form, mingled with flowers still retaining the\r\nusual intermediate condition. A hybrid Cereus between C. speciosissimus and\r\nphyllanthus (11/117. Gartner ibid s. 550.) plants which are widely\r\ndifferent in appearance, produced for the first three years angular, five-\r\nsided stems, and then some flat stems like those of C. phyllanthus.\r\nKolreuter also gives cases of hybrid Lobelias and Verbascums, which at\r\nfirst produced flowers of one colour, and later in the season, flowers of a\r\ndifferent colour. (11/118. 'Journal de Physique' tome 23 1873 page 100.\r\n'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1781 part 1 page 249.) Naudin (11/119.\r\n'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 49.) raised forty hybrids from\r\nDatura laevis fertilised by D. stramonium; and three of these hybrids\r\nproduced many capsules, of which a half, or quarter, or lesser segment was\r\nsmooth and of small size, like the capsule of the pure D. laevis, the\r\nremaining part being spinose and of larger size, like the capsule of the\r\npure D. stramonium: from one of these composite capsules, plants perfectly\r\nresembling both parent-forms were raised.\r\n\r\nTurning now to varieties. A SEEDLING apple, conjectured to be of crossed\r\nparentage, has been described in France (11/120. L'Hermes January 14, 1837\r\nquoted in Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 13 page 230.) which bears fruit\r\nwith one half larger than the other, of a red colour, acid taste, and\r\npeculiar odour; the other side being greenish-yellow and very sweet: it is\r\nsaid scarcely ever to include perfectly developed seed. I suppose that this\r\nis not the same tree as that which Gaudichaud (11/121. 'Comptes Rendus'\r\ntome 34 1852 page 746.) exhibited before the French institute, bearing on\r\nthe same branch two distinct kinds of apples, one a reinette rouge, and the\r\nother like a reinette canada jaunatre: this double-bearing variety can be\r\npropagated by grafts, and continues to produce both kinds; its origin is\r\nunknown. The Rev. J.D. La Touche sent me a coloured drawing of an apple\r\nwhich he brought from Canada, of which half, surrounding and including the\r\nwhole of the calyx and the insertion of the foot-stalk, is green, the other\r\nhalf being brown and of the nature of the pomme gris apple, with the line\r\nof separation between the two halves exactly defined. The tree was a\r\ngrafted one, and Mr. La Touche thinks that the branches which bore this\r\ncurious apple sprung from the point of junction of the graft and stock: had\r\nthis fact been ascertained, the case would probably have come into the\r\nclass of graft-hybrids already given. But the branch may have sprung from\r\nthe stock, which no doubt was a seedling.\r\n\r\nProf. H. Lecoq, who has made a great number of crossings between the\r\ndifferently coloured varieties of Mirabilis jalapa (11/122. 'Geograph. Bot.\r\nde l'Europe' tome 3 1854 page 405; and 'De la Fecondation' 1862 page 302.)\r\nfinds that in the seedlings the colours rarely combine, but form distinct\r\nstripes; or half the flower is of one colour and half of a different\r\ncolour. Some varieties regularly bear flowers striped with yellow, white,\r\nand red; but plants of such varieties occasionally produce on the same root\r\nbranches with uniformly coloured flowers of all three tints, and other\r\nbranches with half-and-half coloured flowers, and others with marbled\r\nflowers. Gallesio (11/123. 'Traite du Citrus' 1811 page 45.) crossed\r\nreciprocally white and red carnations, and the seedlings were striped; but\r\nsome of the striped plants also bore entirely white and entirely red\r\nflowers. Some of these plants produced one year red flowers alone, and in\r\nthe following year striped flowers; or conversely, some plants, after\r\nhaving borne for two or three years striped flowers, would revert and bear\r\nexclusively red flowers. It may be worth mentioning that I fertilised the\r\nPURPLE SWEET-PEA (Lathyrus odoratus) with pollen from the light-coloured\r\nPAINTED LADY: seedlings raised from the same pod were not intermediate in\r\ncharacter, but perfectly resembled either parent. Later in the summer, the\r\nplants which had at first borne flowers identical with those of the PAINTED\r\nLADY, produced flowers streaked and blotched with purple; showing in these\r\ndarker marks a tendency to reversion to the mother-variety. Andrew Knight\r\n(11/124. 'Transact. Linn. Soc.' volume 9 page 268.) fertilised two white\r\ngrapes with pollen of the Aleppo grape, which is darkly variegated both in\r\nits leaves and fruit. The result was that the young seedlings were not at\r\nfirst variegated, but all became variegated during the succeeding summer;\r\nbesides this, many produced on the same plant bunches of grapes which were\r\nall black, or all white, or lead-coloured striped with white, or white\r\ndotted with minute black stripes; and grapes of all these shades could\r\nfrequently be found on the same foot-stalk.\r\n\r\nI will append a very curious case, not of bud-variation, but of two\r\ncohering embryos, different in character and contained within the same\r\nseed. A distinguished botanist, Mr. G.H. Thwaites (11/125. 'Annals and Mag.\r\nof Nat. Hist.' March 1848.) states that a seed from Fuchsia coccinea\r\nfertilised by F. fulgens, contained two embryos, and was \"a true vegetable\r\ntwin.\" The two plants produced from the two embryos were \"extremely\r\ndifferent in appearance and character,\" though both resembled other hybrids\r\nof the same parentage produced at the same time. These twin plants \"were\r\nclosely coherent, below the two pairs of cotyledon-leaves, into a single\r\ncylindrical stem, so that they had subsequently the appearance of being\r\nbranches on one trunk.\" Had the two united stems grown up to their full\r\nheight, instead of dying, a curiously mixed hybrid would have been\r\nproduced. A mongrel melon described by Sageret (11/126. 'Pomologie\r\nPhysiolog.' 1830 page 126.) may perhaps have thus originated; for the two\r\nmain branches, which arose from two cotyledon-buds, produced very different\r\nfruit,--on the one branch like that of the paternal variety, and on the\r\nother branch like to a certain extent that of the maternal variety, the\r\nmelon of China.]\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases of crossed varieties, and in some of the cases of\r\ncrossed species, the colours proper to both parents appeared in the\r\nseedlings, as soon as they first flowered, in the form of stripes or larger\r\nsegments, or as whole flowers or fruit of different kinds borne on the same\r\nplant; and in this case the appearance of the two colours cannot strictly\r\nbe said to be due to reversion, but to some incapacity of fusion. When,\r\nhowever, the later flowers or fruit produced during the same season, or\r\nduring a succeeding year or generation, become striped or half-and-half,\r\netc., the segregation of the two colours is strictly a case of reversion by\r\nbud-variation. Whether all the many recorded cases of striped flowers and\r\nfruit are due to previous hybridisation and reversion is by no means clear,\r\nfor instance with peaches and nectarines, moss-roses, etc. In a future\r\nchapter I shall show that, with animals of crossed parentage, the same\r\nindividual has been known to change its character during growth, and to\r\nrevert to one of its parents which it did not at first resemble. Finally,\r\nfrom the various facts now given, there can be no doubt that the same\r\nindividual plant, whether a hybrid or a mongrel, sometimes returns in its\r\nleaves, flowers, and fruit, either wholly or by segments, to both parent-\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nON THE DIRECT OR IMMEDIATE ACTION OF THE MALE ELEMENT ON THE MOTHER FORM.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable class of facts must be here considered, firstly, because\r\nthey have a high physiological importance, and secondly, because they have\r\nbeen supposed to account for some cases of bud-variation. I refer to the\r\ndirect action of the male element, not in the ordinary way on the ovules,\r\nbut on certain parts of the female plant, or in case of animals on the\r\nsubsequent progeny of the female by a second male. I may premise that with\r\nplants the ovarium and the coats of the ovules are obviously parts of the\r\nfemale, and it could not have been anticipated that they would have been\r\naffected by the pollen of a foreign variety or species, although the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo, inside the embryonic sack, inside the ovule and\r\novarium, of course, depends on the male element.\r\n\r\n[Even as long ago as 1729 it was observed (11/127. 'Philosophical\r\nTransact.' volume 43 1744-45 page 525.) that white and blue varieties of\r\nthe Pea, when planted near each other, mutually crossed, no doubt through\r\nthe agency of bees, and in the autumn blue and white peas were found within\r\nthe same pods. Wiegmann made an exactly similar observation in the present\r\ncentury. The same result has followed several times when a variety with\r\npeas of one colour has been artificially crossed by a differently-coloured\r\nvariety. (11/128. Mr. Goss 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page 234: and\r\nGartner 'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 ss. 81 and 499.) These statements led\r\nGartner, who was highly sceptical on the subject, carefully to try a long\r\nseries of experiments: he selected the most constant varieties, and the\r\nresult conclusively showed that the colour of the skin of the pea is\r\nmodified when pollen of a differently coloured variety is used. This\r\nconclusion has since been confirmed by experiments made by the Rev. J.M.\r\nBerkeley. (11/129. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1854 page 404.)\r\n\r\nMr. Laxton of Stamford, whilst making experiments on peas for the express\r\npurpose of ascertaining the influence of foreign pollen on the mother-\r\nplant, has recently (11/130. Ibid 1866 page 900.) observed an important\r\nadditional fact. He fertilised the Tall Sugar-pea, which bears very thin\r\ngreen pods, becoming brownish-white when dry, with pollen of the Purple-\r\npodded pea, which, as its name expresses, has dark-purple pods with very\r\nthick skin, becoming pale reddish purple when dry. Mr. Laxton has\r\ncultivated the tall sugar-pea during twenty years, and has never seen or\r\nheard of it producing a purple pod: nevertheless, a flower fertilised by\r\npollen from the purple-pod yielded a pod clouded with purplish-red which\r\nMr. Laxton kindly gave to me. A space of about two inches in length towards\r\nthe extremity of the pod, and a smaller space near the stalk, were thus\r\ncoloured. On comparing the colour with that of the purple pod, both pods\r\nhaving been first dried and then soaked in water, it was found to be\r\nidentically the same; and in both the colour was confined to the cells\r\nlying immediately beneath the outer skin of the pod. The valves of the\r\ncrossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger than those of the pods\r\nof the mother-plant, but this may possibly have been an accidental\r\ncircumstance, for I know not how far their thickness is a variable\r\ncharacter in the Tall Sugar-pea.\r\n\r\nThe peas of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry, are pale greenish-brown, thickly\r\ncovered with dots of dark purple so minute as to be visible only through a\r\nlens, and Mr. Laxton has never seen or heard of this variety producing a\r\npurple pea; but in the crossed pod one of the peas was of a uniform\r\nbeautiful violet-purple tint, and a second was irregularly clouded with\r\npale purple. The colour lies in the outer of the two coats which surround\r\nthe pea. As the peas of the purple-podded variety when dry are of a pale\r\ngreenish-buff, it would at first appear that this remarkable change of\r\ncolour in the peas in the crossed pod could not have been caused by the\r\ndirect action of the pollen of the purple-pod: but when we bear in mind\r\nthat this latter variety has purple flowers, purple marks on its stipules,\r\nand purple pods; and that the Tall Sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers\r\nand stipules, and microscopically minute purple dots on the peas, we can\r\nhardly doubt that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents\r\nhas in combination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed pod.\r\nAfter having examined these specimens, I crossed the same two varieties,\r\nand the peas in one pod but not the pods themselves, were clouded and\r\ntinted with purplish-red in a much more conspicuous manner than the peas in\r\nthe uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same plants. I may\r\nnotice as a caution that Mr. Laxton sent me various other crossed peas\r\nslightly, or even greatly, modified in colour; but the change in these\r\ncases was due, as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to the altered colour\r\nof the cotyledons, seen through the transparent coats of the peas; and as\r\nthe cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these cases are not in any way\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the genus Matthiola. The pollen of one kind of stock\r\nsometimes affects the colour of the seeds of another kind, used as the\r\nmother-plant. I give the following case the more readily, as Gartner\r\ndoubted similar statements previously made with respect to the stock by\r\nother observers. A well-known horticulturist, Major Trevor Clarke, informs\r\nme (11/131. See also a paper by this observer read before the International\r\nHort. and Bot. Congress of London 1866.) that the seeds of the large red-\r\nflowered BIENNIAL stock, Matthiola annua (Cocardeau of the French), are\r\nlight brown, and those of the purple branching Queen stock (M. incana) are\r\nviolet-black; and he found that, when flowers of the red stock were\r\nfertilised by pollen from the purple stock, they yielded about fifty per\r\ncent of BLACK seeds. He sent me four pods from a red flowered plant, two of\r\nwhich had been fertilised by their own pollen, and they included pale brown\r\nseed; and two which had been crossed by pollen from the purple kind, and\r\nthey included seeds all deeply tinged with black. These latter seeds\r\nyielded purple-flowered plants like their father; whilst the pale brown\r\nseeds yielded normal red-flowered plants; and Major Clarke, by sowing\r\nsimilar seeds, has observed on a greater scale the same result. The\r\nevidence in this case of the direct action of the pollen of one species on\r\nthe colour of the seeds of another species appears to me conclusive.\r\n\r\nGallesio (11/132. 'Traite du Citrus' page 40.) fertilised the flowers of an\r\norange with pollen from the lemon; and one fruit thus produced bore a\r\nlongitudinal stripe of peel having the colour, flavour, and other\r\ncharacters of the lemon. Mr. Anderson (11/133. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.'\r\nvolume 3 page 318. See also volume 5 page 65.) fertilised a green-fleshed\r\nmelon with pollen from a scarlet-fleshed kind; in two of the fruits \"a\r\nsensible change was perceptible: and four other fruits were somewhat\r\naltered both internally and externally.\" The seeds of the two first-\r\nmentioned fruits produced plants partaking of the good properties of both\r\nparents. In the United States, where Cucurbitaceae are largely cultivated,\r\nit is the popular belief (11/134. Prof. Asa Gray 'Proc. Acad. Sc.' Boston\r\nvolume 4 1860 page 21. I have received statements to the same effect from\r\nother persons in the United States.) that the fruit is thus directly\r\naffected hy foreign pollen; and I have received a similar statement with\r\nrespect to the cucumber in England. It is believed that grapes have been\r\nthus affected in colour, size, and shape: in France a pale-coloured grape\r\nhad its juice tinted by the pollen of the dark-coloured Teinturier; in\r\nGermany a variety bore berries which were affected by the pollen of two\r\nadjoining kinds; some of the berries being only partially affected or\r\nmottled. (11/135. For the French case see 'Journ. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 new\r\nseries 1866 page 50. For Germany see M. Jack quoted in Henfrey's 'Botanical\r\nGazette' volume 1 page 277. A case in England has recently been alluded to\r\nby the Rev. J.M. Berkeley before the Hort. Soc. of London.)\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1751 (11/136. 'Philosophical Transactions' volume 47 1751-52\r\npage 206.) it was observed that, when differently-coloured varieties of\r\nmaize grew near each other, they mutually affected each other's seeds, and\r\nthis is now a popular belief in the United States. Dr. Savi (11/137.\r\nGallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' 1816 page 95.) tried the experiment\r\nwith care: he sowed yellow and black-seeded maize together, and on the same\r\near some of the seeds were yellow, some black, and some mottled, the\r\ndifferently coloured seeds being arranged irregularly or in rows. Prof.\r\nHildebrand has repeated the experiment (11/138. 'Bot. Zeitung' May 1868\r\npage 326.) with the precaution of ascertaining that the mother-plant was\r\ntrue. A kind bearing yellow grains was fertilised with pollen of a kind\r\nhaving brown grains, and two ears produced yellow grains mingled with\r\nothers of a dirty violet tint. A third ear had only yellow grains, but one\r\nside of the spindle was tinted of a reddish-brown; so that here we have the\r\nimportant fact of the influence of the foreign pollen extending to the\r\naxis. Mr. Arnold, in Canada, varied the experiment in an interesting\r\nmanner: \"a female flower was subjected first to the action of pollen from a\r\nyellow variety, and then to that from a white variety; the result was an\r\near, each grain of which was yellow below and white above.\" (11/139. See\r\nDr. J. Stockton-Hough 'American Naturalist' January 1874 page 29.) With\r\nother plants it has occasionally been observed that the crossed offspring\r\nshowed the influence of two kinds of pollen, but in this case the two kinds\r\naffected the mother-plant.\r\n\r\nMr. Sabine states (11/140. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page 69.) that\r\nhe has seen the form of the nearly globular seed-capsule of Amaryllis\r\nvittata altered by the application of the pollen of another species, of\r\nwhich the capsule has gibbous angles. With an allied genus, a well-known\r\nbotanist, Maximowicz, has described in detail the striking results of\r\nreciprocally fertilising Lilium bulbiferum and davuricum with each other's\r\npollen. Each species produced fruit not like its own, but almost identical\r\nwith that of the pollen-bearing species; but from an accident only the\r\nfruit of the latter species was carefully examined; the seeds were\r\nintermediate in the development of their wings. (11/141. 'Bull. de l'Acad.\r\nImp. de St. Petersburg' tome 17 page 275, 1872. The author gives references\r\nto those cases in the So1anaceae of fruit affected by foreign pollen, but\r\nas it does not appear that the mother-plant was artificially fertilised, I\r\nhave not entered into details.)\r\n\r\nFritz Muller fertilised Cattleya leopoldi with pollen of Epidendron\r\ncinnabarinum; and the capsules contained very few seeds; but these\r\npresented a most wonderful appearance, which, from the description given,\r\ntwo botanists, Hildebrand and Maximowicz, attribute to the direct action of\r\nthe pollen of the Epidendron. (11/142. 'Bot. Zeitung' September 1868 page\r\n631. For Maximowicz's judgment see the paper last referred to.)\r\n\r\nMr. J. Anderson Henry (11/143. 'Journal of Horticulture' January 20, 1863\r\npage 46.) crossed Rhododendron dalhousiae with the pollen of R. nuttallii,\r\nwhich is one of the largest-flowered and noblest species of the genus. The\r\nlargest pod produced by the former species, when fertilised with its own\r\npollen, measured 1 2/8 inch in length and 1 1/2 in girth; whilst three of\r\nthe pods which had been fertilised by pollen of R. nuttallii measured 1 5/8\r\ninch in length and no less than 2 inches in girth. Here the effect of the\r\nforeign pollen was apparently confined to increasing the size of the\r\novarium; but we must be cautious in assuming, as the following case shows,\r\nthat size had been transferred from the male parent to the capsule of the\r\nfemale plant. Mr. Henry fertilised Arabis blepharophylla with pollen of A.\r\nsoyeri, and the pods thus produced, of which he was so kind as to send me\r\ndetailed measurements and sketches, were much larger in all their\r\ndimensions than those naturally produced by either the male or female\r\nparent-species. In a future chapter we shall see that the organs of\r\nvegetation in hybrid plants, independently of the character of either\r\nparent, are sometimes developed to a monstrous size; and the increased size\r\nof the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous fact. On the other\r\nhand, M. de Saporta informs me that an isolated female plant of Pistacia\r\nvera is very apt to be fertilised by the pollen of neighbouring plants of\r\nP. terebinthus, and in this case the fruits are only half their proper\r\nsize, which he attributes to the influence of the pollen of P. terebinthus.\r\n\r\nNo case of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on another is\r\nbetter authenticated or more remarkable than that of the common apple. The\r\nfruit here consists of the lower part of the calyx and of the upper part of\r\nthe flower-peduncle (11/144. See on this head the high authority of Prof.\r\nDecaisne in a paper translated in 'Journ. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 new series\r\n1866 page 48.) in a metamorphosed condition, so that the effect of the\r\nforeign pollen has extended even beyond the limits of the ovarium. Cases of\r\napples thus affected were recorded by Bradley in the early part of the last\r\ncentury; and other cases are given in old volumes of the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions' (11/145. Volume 43 1744-45 page 525 volume 45 1747-48 page\r\n602.); in one of these a Russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually\r\naffected each other's fruit; and in another case a smooth apple affected a\r\nrough-coated kind. Another instance has been given (11/146. 'Transact.\r\nHort. Soc.' volume 5 pages 65 and 68. See also Prof. Hildebrand with a\r\ncoloured figure in 'Bot. Zeitung' May 15, 1868 page 327. Puvis also has\r\ncollected 'De La Degeneration' 1837 page 36) several other instances; but\r\nit is not in all cases possible to distinguish between the direct action of\r\nforeign pollen and bud-variations.) of two very different apple-trees\r\ngrowing close to each other, which bore fruit resembling each other, but\r\nonly on the adjoining branches. It is, however, almost superfluous to\r\nadduce these or other cases, after that of the St. Valery apple, the\r\nflowers which, from the abortion of the stamens, do not produce pollen, but\r\nare fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of many kinds;\r\nand they bear fruit, \"differing from one another in size, flavour, and\r\ncolour, but resembling in character the hermaphrodite kinds by which they\r\nhave been fertilised.\" (11/147. T. de Clermont-Tonnerre in 'Mem. de la Soc.\r\nLinn. de Paris' tome 3 1825 page 164.)]\r\n\r\nI have now shown, on the authority of several excellent observers, in the\r\ncase of plants belonging to widely different orders, that the pollen of one\r\nspecies or variety, when applied to the female of a distinct form,\r\noccasionally causes the coats of the seeds, the ovarium or fruit, including\r\neven the calyx and upper part of the peduncle of the apple, and the axis of\r\nthe ear in maize, to be modified. Sometimes the whole ovarium or all the\r\nseeds are thus affected; sometimes only a certain number of the seeds, as\r\nin the case of the pea, or only a part of the ovarium, as with the striped\r\norange, mottled grapes, and maize, is thus affected. It must not be\r\nsupposed that any direct or immediate effect invariably follows the use of\r\nforeign pollen: this is far from being the case; nor is it known on what\r\nconditions the result depends. Mr. Knight (11/148. 'Transact. of Hort.\r\nSoc.' volume 5 page 68.) expressly states that he has never seen the fruit\r\nthus affected, though he crossed thousands of apple and other fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least reason to believe that a branch which has borne seed\r\nor fruit directly modified by foreign pollen is itself affected, so as\r\nafterwards to produce modified buds; such an occurrence, from the temporary\r\nconnection of the flower with the stem, would be hardly possible. Hence,\r\nbut very few, if any, of the cases of bud-variation in the fruit of trees,\r\ngiven in the early part of this chapter can be accounted for by the action\r\nof foreign pollen; for such fruits have commonly been propagated by budding\r\nor grafting. It is also obvious that changes of colour in flowers, which\r\nnecessarily supervene long before they are ready for fertilisation, and\r\nchanges in the shape or colour of leaves, when due to the appearance of\r\nmodified buds, can have no relation to the action of foreign pollen.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of the action of foreign pollen on the mother-plant have been\r\ngiven in considerable detail, because this action, as we shall see in a\r\nfuture chapter, is of the highest theoretical importance, and because it is\r\nin itself a remarkable and apparently anomalous circumstance. That it is\r\nremarkable under a physiological point of view is clear, for the male\r\nelement not only affects, in accordance with its proper function, the germ,\r\nbut at the same time various parts of the mother-plant, in the same manner,\r\nas it affects the same part in the seminal offspring from the same two\r\nparents. We thus learn that an ovule is not indispensable for the reception\r\nof the influence of the male element. But this direct action of the male\r\nelement is not so anomalous as it at first appears, for it comes into play\r\nin the ordinary fertilisation of many flowers. Gartner gradually increased\r\nthe number of pollen grains until he succeeded in fertilising a Malva, and\r\nhas (11/149. Beitrage zur Kenntniss der Befruchtung' 1844 s. 347-351.)\r\nproved that many grains are first expended in the development, or, as he\r\nexpresses it, in the satiation, of the pistil and ovarium. Again, when one\r\nplant is fertilised by a widely distinct species, it often happens that the\r\novarium is fully and quickly developed without any seeds being formed; or\r\nthe coats of the seeds are formed without any embryo being developed\r\nwithin. Prof. Hildebrand, also, has lately shown (11/150. 'Die\r\nFruchtbildung der Orchideen, ein Beweis fur die doppelte Wirkung des\r\nPollens' 'Botanische Zeitung' No. 44 et seq. October 30, 1865; and August\r\n4, 1865 s. 249.) that, in the normal fertilisation of several Orchideae,\r\nthe action of the plant's own pollen is necessary for the development of\r\nthe ovarium; and that this development takes place not only long before the\r\npollen-tubes have reached the ovules, but even before the placentae and\r\novules have been formed; so that with these orchids the pollen acts\r\ndirectly on the ovarium. On the other hand, we must not overrate the\r\nefficacy of pollen in the case of hybridised plants, for an embryo may be\r\nformed and its influence excite the surrounding tissues of the mother-\r\nplant, and then perish at a very early age and be thus overlooked. Again,\r\nit is well known that with many plants the ovarium may be fully developed,\r\nthough pollen be wholly excluded. Lastly, Mr. Smith, the late Curator at\r\nKew (as I hear through Dr. Hooker), observed with an orchid, the Bonatea\r\nspeciosa, the singular fact that the development of the ovarium could be\r\neffected by the mechanical irritation of the stigma. Nevertheless, from the\r\nnumber of the pollen-grains expended \"in the satiation of the ovarium and\r\npistil,\"--from the generality of the formation of the ovarium and seed-\r\ncoats in hybridised plants which produce no seeds,--and from Dr.\r\nHildebrand's observations on orchids, we may admit that in most cases the\r\nswelling of the ovarium, and the formation of the seed-coats are at least\r\naided, if not wholly caused, by the direct action of the pollen,\r\nindependently of the intervention of the fertilised germ. Therefore, in the\r\npreviously given cases we have only to believe in the further power of\r\npollen, when applied to a distinct species or variety, to influence the\r\nshape, size, colour, texture, etc., of certain parts of the mother-plant.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the animal kingdom. If we could imagine the same flower to\r\nyield seeds during successive years, then it would not be very surprising\r\nthat a flower of which the ovarium had been modified by foreign pollen\r\nshould next year produce, when self-fertilised, offspring modified by the\r\nprevious male influence. Closely analogous cases have actually occurred\r\nwith animals. In the case often quoted from Lord Morton (11/151. 'Philos.\r\nTransact.' 1821 page 20.) a nearly purely-bred Arabian chestnut mare bore a\r\nhybrid to a quagga; she was subsequently sent to Sir Gore Ouseley, and\r\nproduced two colts by a black Arabian horse. These colts were partially\r\ndun-coloured, and were striped on the legs more plainly than the real\r\nhybrid, or even than the quagga. One of the two colts had its neck and some\r\nother parts of its body plainly marked with stripes. Stripes on the body,\r\nnot to mention those on the legs, are extremely rare,--I speak after having\r\nlong attended to the subject,--with horses of all kinds in Europe, and are\r\nalmost unknown in the case of Arabians. But what makes the case still more\r\nstriking is that in these colts the hair of the mane resembled that of the\r\nquagga, being short, stiff, and upright. Hence there can be no doubt that\r\nthe quagga affected the character of the offspring subsequently begot by\r\nthe black Arabian horse. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me of a strictly parallel\r\ncase: his neighbour Mr. Lethbridge, of Blackheath, has a horse, bred by\r\nLord Mostyn, which had previously borne a foal by a quagga. This horse is\r\ndun with a dark stripe down the back, faint stripes on the forehead between\r\nthe eyes, plain stripes on the inner side of the fore-legs and rather more\r\nfaint ones on the hind-legs, with no shoulder-stripe. The mane grows much\r\nlower on the forehead than in the horse, but not so low as in the quagga or\r\nzebra. The hoofs are proportionally longer than in the horse,--so much so\r\nthat the farrier who first shod this animal, and knew nothing of its\r\norigin, said, \"Had I not seen I was shoeing a horse, I should have thought\r\nI was shoeing a donkey.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the varieties of our domesticated animals, many similar and\r\nwell-authenticated facts have been published (11/152. Dr. Alex. Harvey on\r\n'A remarkable Effect of Cross-breeding' 1851. On the 'Physiology of\r\nBreeding' by Mr. Reginald Orton 1855. 'Intermarriage' by Alex. Walker 1837.\r\n'L'Heredite Naturelle' by Dr. Prosper Lucas tome 2 page 58. Mr. W. Sedgwick\r\nin 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review' 1863 July page 183.\r\nBronn in his 'Geschichte der Natur' 1843 b. 2 s. 127 has collected several\r\ncases with respect to mares, sows, and dogs. Mr. W.C.L. Martin ('History of\r\nthe Dog' 1845 page 104) says he can personally vouch for the influence of\r\nthe male parent on subsequent litters by other dogs. A French poet, Jacques\r\nSavary, who wrote in 1665 on dogs, was aware of this singular fact. Dr.\r\nBowerbank has given us the following striking case:--A black, hairless\r\nBarbary bitch was first accidentally impregnated by a mongrel spaniel with\r\nlong brown hair, and she produced five puppies, three of which were\r\nhairless and two covered with SHORT brown hair. The next time she was put\r\nto a black, hairless Barbary dog; \"but the mischief had been implanted in\r\nthe mother, and again about half the litter looked like pure Barbarys, and\r\nthe other half like the SHORT-haired progeny of the first father.\" I have\r\ngiven in the text one case with pigs; an equally striking one has been\r\nrecently published in Germany, 'Illust. Landwirth. Zeitung' 1868 November\r\n17 page 143. It is worth notice that farmers in S. Brazil (as I hear from\r\nFritz Muller), and at the C. of Good Hope (as I have heard from two\r\ntrustworthy persons) are convinced that mares which have once borne mules,\r\nwhen subsequently put to horses, are extremely liable to produce colts,\r\nstriped like a mule. Dr. Wilckens of Pogarth gives ('Jahrbuch\r\nLandwirthschaft' 2 1869 page 325) a striking and analogous case. A merino\r\nram, having two small lappets or flaps of skin on the neck, was in the\r\nwinter of 1861-62 put to several Merino ewes, all of whom bore lambs with\r\nsimilar flaps on their necks. The ram was killed in the spring of 1862 and\r\nsubsequently to his death the ewes were put to other Merino rams, and in\r\n1863 to Southdown rams, none of whom ever have neck lappets: nevertheless,\r\neven as long afterwards as 1867, several of these ewes produced lambs\r\nbearing these appendages.), and others have been communicated to me,\r\nplainly showing the influence of the first male on the progeny subsequently\r\nborne by the mother to other males. It will suffice to give a single\r\ninstance, recorded in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' in a paper\r\nfollowing that by Lord Morton: Mr. Giles put a sow of Lord Western's black\r\nand white Essex breed to a wild boar of a deep chestnut colour; and the\r\n\"pigs produced partook in appearance of both boar and sow, but in some the\r\nchestnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed.\" After the boar had long\r\nbeen dead, the sow was put to a boar of her own black and white breed--a\r\nkind which is well known to breed very true and never to show any chestnut\r\ncolour,--yet from this union the sow produced some young pigs which were\r\nplainly marked with the same chestnut tint as in the first litter. Similar\r\ncases have so frequently occurred, that careful breeders avoid putting a\r\nchoice female of any animal to an inferior male, on account of the injury\r\nto her subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow.\r\n\r\nSome physiologists have attempted to account for these remarkable results\r\nfrom a previous impregnation, by the imagination of the mother having been\r\nstrongly affected; but it will hereafter be seen that there are very slight\r\ngrounds for any such belief. Other physiologists attribute the result to\r\nthe close attachment and freely intercommunicating blood-vessels between\r\nthe modified embryo and mother. But the analogy from the action of foreign\r\npollen on the ovarium, seed-coats, and other parts of the mother-plant,\r\nstrongly supports the belief that with animals the male element acts\r\ndirectly on the female, and not through the crossed embryo. With birds\r\nthere is no close connection between the embryo and mother; yet a careful\r\nobserver, Dr. Chapuis, states (11/153. 'Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge' 1865 page\r\n59.) that with pigeons the influence of a first male sometimes makes itself\r\nperceived in the succeeding broods; but this statement requires\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION AND SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nThe facts given in the latter half of this chapter are well worthy of\r\nconsideration, as they show us in how many extraordinary modes the union of\r\none form with another may lead to the modification of the seminal offspring\r\nor of the buds, afterwards produced.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing surprising in the offspring of species or varieties\r\ncrossed in the ordinary manner being modified; but the case of two plants\r\nwithin the same seed, which cohere and differ from each other, is curious.\r\nWhen a bud is formed after the cellular tissue of two species or two\r\nvarieties have been united, and it partakes of the characters of both\r\nparents, the case is wonderful. But I need not here repeat what has been so\r\nlately said on this subject. We have also seen that in the case of plants\r\nthe male element may affect in a direct manner the tissues of the mother,\r\nand with animals may lead to the modification of her future progeny. In the\r\nvegetable kingdom the offspring from a cross between two species or\r\nvarieties, whether effected by seminal generation or by grafting, often\r\nrevert, to a greater or less degree, in the first or in a succeeding\r\ngeneration, to the two parent-forms; and this reversion may affect the\r\nwhole flower, fruit, or leaf-bud, or only the half or a smaller segment of\r\na single organ. In some cases, however, such segregation of character\r\napparently depends on an incapacity for union rather than on reversion, for\r\nthe flowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the\r\ncharacters of both parents. The various facts here given ought to be well\r\nconsidered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point of view\r\nthe many modes of reproduction by gemmation, division, and sexual union,\r\nthe reparation of lost parts, variation, inheritance, reversion, and other\r\nsuch phenomena. Towards the close of the second volume I shall attempt to\r\nconnect these facts together by the hypothesis of pangenesis.\r\n\r\nIn the early half of the present chapter I have given a long list of plants\r\nin which through bud-variation, that is, independently of reproduction by\r\nseed, the fruit has suddenly become modified in size, colour, flavour,\r\nhairiness, shape, and time of maturity; flowers have similarly changed in\r\nshape, colour, in being double, and greatly in the character of the calyx;\r\nyoung branches or shoots have changed in colour, in bearing spines and in\r\nhabit of growth, as in climbing or in weeping; leaves have changed in\r\nbecoming variegated, in shape, period of unfolding, and in their\r\narrangement on the axis. Buds of all kinds, whether produced on ordinary\r\nbranches or on subterranean stems, whether simple or much modified and\r\nsupplied with a stock of nutriment, as in tubers and bulbs, are all liable\r\nto sudden variations of the same general nature.\r\n\r\nIn the list, many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to characters\r\nnot acquired from a cross, but which were formerly present and have since\r\nbeen lost for a longer or shorter time;--as when a bud on a variegated\r\nplant produces plain leaves, or when the variously-coloured flowers of the\r\nChrysanthemum revert to the aboriginal yellow tint. Many other cases\r\nincluded in the list are probably due to the plants being of crossed\r\nparentage, and to the buds reverting either completely or by segments to\r\none of the two parent-forms. (11/154. It may be worth while to call\r\nattention to the several means by which flowers and fruit become striped or\r\nmottled. Firstly, by the direct action of the pollen of another variety or\r\nspecies, as in the cases given of oranges and maize. Secondly, in crosses\r\nof the first generation, when the colours of the two parents do not readily\r\nunite, as with Mirabilis and Dianthus. Thirdly, in crossed plants of a\r\nsubsequent generation by reversion, through either bud or seminal\r\ngeneration. Fourthly, by reversion to a character not originally gained by\r\na cross, but which had long been lost, as with white-flowered varieties,\r\nwhich we shall hereafter see often become striped with some other colour.\r\nLastly, there are cases, as when peaches are produced with a half or\r\nquarter of the fruit like a nectarine, in which the change is apparently\r\ndue to mere variation, through either bud or seminal generation.)\r\n\r\nWe may suspect that the strong tendency in the Chrysanthemum to produce by\r\nbud-variation differently-coloured flowers, results from the varieties\r\nhaving been at some time intentionally or accidentally crossed; and this is\r\ncertainly the case with some kinds of Pelargonium. So it may be to a large\r\nextent with the bud-varieties of the Dahlia, and with the \"broken colours\r\n\"of Tulips. When, however, a plant reverts by bud-variation to its two\r\nparent forms, or to one of them, it sometimes does not revert perfectly,\r\nbut assumes a somewhat new character,--of which fact, instances have been\r\ngiven, and Carriere gives (11/155. 'Production des Varietes' page 37.)\r\nanother in the cherry.\r\n\r\nMany cases of bud-variation, however, cannot be attributed to reversion,\r\nbut to so-called spontaneous variability, as is so common with cultivated\r\nplants raised from seed. As a single variety of the Chrysanthemum has\r\nproduced by buds six other varieties, and as one variety of the gooseberry\r\nhas borne at the same time four distinct kinds of fruit, it is scarcely\r\npossible to believe that all these variations are due to reversion. We can\r\nhardly believe, as remarked in a previous chapter, that all the many\r\npeaches which have yielded nectarine-buds are of crossed parentage. Lastly,\r\nin such cases as that of the moss-rose, with its peculiar calyx, and of the\r\nrose which bears opposite leaves, in that of the Imatophyllum, etc., there\r\nis no known natural species or variety from which the characters in\r\nquestion could have been derived by a cross. We must attribute all such\r\ncases to the appearance of absolutely new characters in the buds. The\r\nvarieties which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external\r\ncharacter from seedlings; this is notoriously the case with the varieties\r\nof the Rose, Azalea, and many other plants. It deserves notice that all the\r\nplants which have yielded bud-variations have likewise varied greatly by\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nThe plants which have varied by buds belong to so many orders that we may\r\ninfer that almost every plant would be liable to variation, if placed under\r\nthe proper exciting conditions. These conditions, as far as we can judge,\r\nmainly depend on long-continued and high cultivation; for almost all the\r\nplants in the foregoing list are perennials, and have been largely\r\npropagated in many soils, under different climates, by cuttings, offsets,\r\nbulbs, tubers, and especially by budding or grafting. The instances of\r\nannuals varying by buds, or producing on the same plant differently\r\ncoloured flowers, are comparatively rare: Hopkirk (11/156. 'Flora Anomala'\r\npage 164.) has seen this with Convolvulus tricolor; and it is not uncommon\r\nwith the Balsam and annual Delphinium. According to Sir R. Schomburgk,\r\nplants from the warmer temperate regions, when cultivated under the hot\r\nclimate of St. Domingo, are eminently liable to bud-variation. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Sedgwick that moss-roses which have often been taken to\r\nCalcutta always there lose their mossiness; but change of climate is by no\r\nmeans a necessary contingent, as we see with the gooseberry, currant, and\r\nin many other cases. Plants living under their natural conditions are very\r\nrarely subject to bud-variation. Variegated leaves have, however, been\r\nobserved under such circumstances; and I have given an instance of\r\nvariation by buds on an ash-tree planted in ornamental grounds, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether such a tree can be considered as living under strictly\r\nnatural conditions. Gartner has seen white and dark-red flowers produced\r\nfrom the same root of the wild Achillea millefolium; and Prof. Caspary has\r\nseen a completely wild Viola lutea bearing flowers of two different colours\r\nand sizes. (11/157. 'Schriften der physisch-okon. Gesell. zu Konigsberg' b.\r\n6 February 3, 1865 s. 4.)\r\n\r\nAs wild plants are so rarely liable to bud-variation, whilst highly\r\ncultivated plants long propagated by artificial means have yielded many\r\nvarieties by this form of reproduction, we are led through a series such as\r\nthe following,--namely, all the eyes in the same tuber of the potato\r\nvarying in the same manner,--all the fruit on a purple plum-tree suddenly\r\nbecoming yellow,--all the fruit on a double-flowered almond suddenly\r\nbecoming peach like,--all the buds on grafted trees being in a very slight\r\ndegree affected by the stock on which they have been worked,--all the\r\nflowers on a transplanted heartsease changing for a time in colour, size,\r\nand shape,--we are led by such a series to look at every case of bud-\r\nvariation as the direct result of the conditions of life to which the plant\r\nhas been exposed. On the other hand, plants of the same variety may be\r\ncultivated in two adjoining beds, apparently under exactly the same\r\nconditions, and those in the one bed, as Carriere insists (11/158.\r\n'Production des Varietes' pages 58, 70.) will produce many bud-variations,\r\nand those in the other not a single one. Again, if we look to such cases as\r\nthat of a peach-tree which, after having been cultivated by tens of\r\nthousands during many years in many countries, and after having annually\r\nproduced millions of buds, all of which have apparently been exposed to\r\nprecisely the same conditions, yet at last suddenly produces a single bud\r\nwith its whole character greatly transformed, we are driven to the\r\nconclusion that the transformation stands in no DIRECT relation to the\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that varieties produced from seeds and from buds resemble each\r\nother so closely in general appearance that they cannot be distinguished.\r\nJust as certain species and groups of species, when propagated by seed, are\r\nmore variable than other species or genera, so it is in the case of certain\r\nbud-varieties. Thus, the Queen of England Chrysanthemum has produced by\r\nthis latter process no less than six, and Rollisson's Unique Pelargonium\r\nfour distinct varieties; moss-roses have also produced several other moss-\r\nroses. The Rosaceae have varied by buds more than any other group of\r\nplants; but this may be in large part due to so many members having been\r\nlong cultivated; but within this same group, the peach has often varied by\r\nbuds, whilst the apple and pear, both grafted trees extensively cultivated,\r\nhave afforded, as far as I can ascertain, extremely few instances of bud-\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nThe law of analogous variation holds good with varieties produced by buds,\r\nas with those produced from seed: more than one kind of rose has sported\r\ninto a moss-rose; more than one kind of camellia has assumed an hexagonal\r\nform; and at least seven or eight varieties of the peach have produced\r\nnectarines.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the same with seminal and bud-\r\nvarieties. We know how commonly reversion comes into play with both, and it\r\nmay affect the whole, or only segments of a leaf, flower, or fruit. When\r\nthe tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same tree, it becomes\r\ncovered with different kinds of leaves, flowers, or fruit; but there is\r\nreason to believe that such fluctuating varieties have generally arisen\r\nfrom seed. It is well known that, out of a number of seedling varieties,\r\nsome transmit their character much more truly by seed than others; so with\r\nbud-varieties, some retain their character by successive buds more truly\r\nthan others; of which instances have been given with two kinds of\r\nvariegated Euonymus and with certain kinds of tulips and pelargoniums.\r\nNotwithstanding the sudden production of bud-varieties, the characters thus\r\nacquired are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction: Mr.\r\nRivers has found that moss-roses generally reproduce themselves by seed;\r\nand the mossy character has been transferred by crossing from one species\r\nof rose to another. The Boston nectarine, which appeared as a bud-\r\nvariation, produced by seed a closely allied nectarine. On the other hand,\r\nseedlings from some bud-variations have proved variable to an extreme\r\ndegree. (11/159. Carriere 'Production des Varietes' page 39.) We have also\r\nheard, on the authority of Mr. Salter, that seeds taken from a branch with\r\nleaves variegated through bud-variation, transmit this character very\r\nfeebly; whilst many plants, which were variegated as seedlings, transmit\r\nvariegation to a large proportion of their progeny.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been able to collect a good many cases of bud-variation, as\r\nshown in the previous lists, and might probably, by searching foreign\r\nhorticultural works, have collected very many more cases, yet their total\r\nnumber is as nothing in comparison with that of seminal varieties. With\r\nseedlings raised from the more variable cultivated plants, the variations\r\nare almost infinitely numerous, but their differences are generally slight:\r\nonly at long intervals of time a strongly marked modification appears. On\r\nthe other hand, it is a singular and inexplicable fact that, when plants\r\nvary by buds, the variations, though they occur with comparative rarity,\r\nare often, or even generally, strongly pronounced. It struck me that this\r\nmight perhaps be a delusion, and that slight changes often occurred in\r\nbuds, but were overlooked or not recorded from being of no value.\r\nAccordingly, I applied to two great authorities on this subject, namely, to\r\nMr. Rivers with respect to fruit-trees, and to Mr. Salter with respect to\r\nflowers. Mr. Rivers is doubtful, but does not remember having noticed very\r\nslight variations in fruit-buds. Mr. Salter informs me that with flowers\r\nsuch do occur, but, if propagated, they generally lose their new character\r\nin the following year; yet he concurs with me that bud-variations usually\r\nat once assume a decided and permanent character. We can hardly doubt that\r\nthis is the rule, when we reflect on such cases as that of the peach, which\r\nhas been so carefully observed, and of which such trifling seminal\r\nvarieties have been propagated, yet this tree has repeatedly produced by\r\nbud-variation nectarines, and only twice (as far as I can learn) any other\r\nvariety, namely, the Early and Late Grosse Mignonne peaches; and these\r\ndiffer from the parent-tree in hardly any character except the period of\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I hear from Mr. Salter that he brings the principle of\r\nselection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds, and has thus\r\ngreatly improved and fixed several varieties. He informs me that at first a\r\nbranch often produces variegated leaves on one side alone, and that the\r\nleaves are marked only with an irregular edging or with a few lines of\r\nwhite and yellow. To improve and fix such varieties, he finds it necessary\r\nto encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly marked leaves,\r\nand to propagate from them alone. By following with perseverance this plan\r\nduring three or four successive seasons, a distinct and fixed variety can\r\ngenerally be secured.\r\n\r\nFinally, the facts given in this chapter prove in how close and remarkable\r\na manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming\r\na bud, resemble each other in all their functions--in their power of\r\ninheritance with occasional reversion,--and in their capacity for variation\r\nof the same general nature, in obedience to the same laws. This\r\nresemblance, or rather identity of character, is shown in the most striking\r\nmanner by the fact that the cellular tissue of one species or variety, when\r\nbudded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate\r\ncharacter. We have seen that variability does not depend on sexual\r\ngeneration, though much more frequently its concomitant than of bud\r\nreproduction. We have seen that bud-variability is not solely dependent on\r\nreversion or atavism to long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired\r\nfrom a cross, but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask\r\nourselves what is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in\r\ndoubt, being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the\r\nexternal conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to feel a\r\nprofound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part, of not\r\nmore importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass of\r\ncombustible matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XII.\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL NATURE OF INHERITANCE.\r\nPEDIGREES OF OUR DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.\r\nINHERITANCE NOT DUE TO CHANCE.\r\nTRIFLING CHARACTERS INHERITED.\r\nDISEASES INHERITED.\r\nPECULIARITIES IN THE EYE INHERITED.\r\nDISEASES IN THE HORSE.\r\nLONGEVITY AND VIGOUR.\r\nASYMMETRICAL DEVIATIONS OF STRUCTURE.\r\nPOLYDACTYLISM AND REGROWTH OF SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS AFTER AMPUTATION.\r\nCASES OF SEVERAL CHILDREN SIMILARLY AFFECTED FROM NON-AFFECTED PARENTS.\r\nWEAK AND FLUCTUATING INHERITANCE: IN WEEPING TREES, IN DWARFNESS, COLOUR OF\r\nFRUIT AND FLOWERS.\r\nCOLOUR OF HORSES.\r\nNON-INHERITANCE IN CERTAIN CASES.\r\nINHERITANCE OF STRUCTURE AND HABITS OVERBORNE BY HOSTILE CONDITIONS OF\r\nLIFE, BY INCESSANTLY RECURRING VARIABILITY, AND BY REVERSION.\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe subject of inheritance is an immense one, and has been treated by many\r\nauthors. One work alone, 'De l'Heredite Naturelle' by Dr. Prosper Lucas,\r\nruns to the length of 1562 pages. We must confine ourselves to certain\r\npoints which have an important bearing on the general subject of variation,\r\nboth with domestic and natural productions. It is obvious that a variation\r\nwhich is not inherited throws no light on the derivation of species, nor is\r\nof any service to man, except in the case of perennial plants, which can be\r\npropagated by buds.\r\n\r\nIf animals and plants had never been domesticated, and wild ones alone had\r\nbeen observed, we should probably never have heard the saying, that \"like\r\nbegets like.\" The proposition would have been as self-evident as that all\r\nthe buds on the same tree are alike, though neither proposition is strictly\r\ntrue. For, as has often been remarked, probably no two individuals are\r\nidentically the same. All wild animals recognise each other, which shows\r\nthat there is some difference between them; and when the eye is well\r\npractised, the shepherd knows each sheep, and man can distinguish a fellow-\r\nman out of millions on millions of other men. Some authors have gone so far\r\nas to maintain that the production of slight differences is as much a\r\nnecessary function of the powers of generation, as the production of\r\noffspring like their parents. This view, as we shall see in a future\r\nchapter, is not theoretically probable, though practically it holds good.\r\nThe saying that \"like begets like\" has, in fact, arisen from the perfect\r\nconfidence felt by breeders, that a superior or inferior animal will\r\ngenerally reproduce its kind; but this very superiority or inferiority\r\nshows that the individual in question has departed slightly from its type.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of inheritance is wonderful. When a new character arises,\r\nwhatever its nature may be, it generally tends to be inherited, at least in\r\na temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner. What can be more\r\nwonderful than that some trifling peculiarity, not primordially attached to\r\nthe species, should be transmitted through the male or female sexual cells,\r\nwhich are so minute as not to be visible to the naked eye, and afterwards\r\nthrough the incessant changes of a long course of development, undergone\r\neither in the womb or in the egg, and ultimately appear in the offspring\r\nwhen mature, or even when quite old, as in the case of certain diseases? Or\r\nagain, what can be more wonderful than the well-ascertained fact that the\r\nminute ovule of a good milking cow will produce a male, from whom a cell,\r\nin union with an ovule, will produce a female, and she, when mature, will\r\nhave large mammary glands, yielding an abundant supply of milk, and even\r\nmilk of a particular quality? Nevertheless, the real subject of surprise\r\nis, as Sir H. Holland has well remarked (12/1. 'Medical Notes and\r\nReflections' 3rd edition 1855 page 267.) not that a character should be\r\ninherited, but that any should ever fail to be inherited. In a future\r\nchapter, devoted to an hypothesis which I have termed pangenesis, an\r\nattempt will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds are\r\ntransmitted from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nSome writers (12/2. Mr. Buckle in his 'History of Civilisation' expresses\r\ndoubts on the subject, owing to the want of statistics. See also Mr. Bowen,\r\nProfessor of Moral Philosophy, in 'Proc. American Acad. of Sciences' volume\r\n5 page 102.), who have not attended to natural history, have attempted to\r\nshow that the force of inheritance has been much exaggerated. The breeders\r\nof animals would smile at such simplicity; and if they condescended to make\r\nany answer, might ask what would be the chance of winning a prize if two\r\ninferior animals were paired together? They might ask whether the half-wild\r\nArabs were led by theoretical notions to keep pedigrees of their horses?\r\nWhy have pedigrees been scrupulously kept and published of the Shorthorn\r\ncattle, and more recently of the Hereford breed? Is it an illusion that\r\nthese recently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities\r\neven when crossed with other breeds? have the Shorthorns, without good\r\nreason, been purchased at immense prices and exported to almost every\r\nquarter of the globe, a thousand guineas having been given for a bull? With\r\ngreyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept, and the names of such dogs,\r\nas Snowball, Major, etc., are as well known to coursers as those of Eclipse\r\nand Herod on the turf. Even with the Gamecock, pedigrees of famous strains\r\nwere formerly kept, and extended back for a century. With pigs, the\r\nYorkshire and Cumberland breeders \"preserve and print pedigrees;\" and to\r\nshow how such highly-bred animals are valued, I may mention that Mr. Brown,\r\nwho won all the first prizes for small breeds at Birmingham in 1850, sold a\r\nyoung sow and boar of his breed to Lord Ducie for 43 guineas; the sow alone\r\nwas afterwards sold to the Rev. F. Thursby for 65 guineas; who writes, \"She\r\npaid me very well, having sold her produce for 300 pounds, and having now\r\nfour breeding sows from her.\" (12/3. For greyhounds see Low 'Domestic\r\nAnimals of the British Islands' 1845 page 721. For game-fowls see 'The\r\nPoultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 page 123. For pigs see Mr. Sidney's\r\nedition of 'Youatt on the Pig' 1860 pages 11, 22.) Hard cash paid down,\r\nover and over again, is an excellent test of inherited superiority. In\r\nfact, the whole art of breeding, from which such great results have been\r\nattained during the present century, depends on the inheritance of each\r\nsmall detail of structure. But inheritance is not certain; for if it were,\r\nthe breeder's art (12/4. 'The Stud Farm' by Cecil page 39.) would be\r\nreduced to a certainty, and there would be little scope left for that\r\nwonderful skill and perseverance shown by the men who have left an enduring\r\nmonument of their success in the present state of our domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible, within a moderate compass, to impress on the mind of\r\nthose who have not attended to the subject, the full conviction of the\r\nforce of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing animals, by\r\nstudying the many treatises which have been published on the various\r\ndomestic animals, and by conversing with breeders. I will select a few\r\nfacts of the kind, which, as far as I can judge, have most influenced my\r\nown mind. With man and the domestic animals, certain peculiarities have\r\nappeared in an individual, at rare intervals, or only once or twice in the\r\nhistory of the world, but have reappeared in several of the children and\r\ngrandchildren. Thus Lambert, \"the porcupine-man,\" whose skin was thickly\r\ncovered with warty projections, which were periodically moulted, had all\r\nhis six children and two grandsons similarly affected. (12/5.\r\n'Philosophical Transactions' 1755 page 23. I have seen only second-hand\r\naccounts of the two grandsons. Mr. Sedgwick, in a paper to which I shall\r\nhereafter often refer, states that FOUR generations were affected, and in\r\neach the males alone.) The face and body being covered with long hair,\r\naccompanied by deficient teeth (to which I shall hereafter refer), occurred\r\nin three successive generations in a Siamese family; but this case is not\r\nunique, as a woman (12/6. Barbara Van Beck, figured, as I am informed by\r\nthe Rev. W.D. Fox, in Woodburn's 'Gallery of Rare Portraits' 1816 volume 2)\r\nwith a completely hairy face who was exhibited in London in 1663, and\r\nanother instance has recently occurred. Colonel Hallam (12/7. 'Proc.\r\nZoolog. Soc.' 1833 page 16.) has described a race of two-legged pigs, \"the\r\nhinder extremities being entirely wanting;\" and this deficiency was\r\ntransmitted through three generations. In fact, all races presenting any\r\nremarkable peculiarity, such as solid-hoofed swine, Mauchamp sheep, niata\r\ncattle, etc., are instances of the long-continued inheritance of rare\r\ndeviations of structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have thus appeared\r\nin a single individual out of many millions, all exposed in the same\r\ncountry to the same general conditions of life, and, again, that the same\r\nextraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in individuals living\r\nunder widely different conditions of life, we are driven to conclude that\r\nsuch peculiarities are not directly due to the action of the surrounding\r\nconditions, but to unknown laws acting on the organisation or constitution\r\nof the individual;--that their production stands in hardly closer relation\r\nto the conditions of life than does life itself. If this be so, and the\r\noccurrence of the same unusual character in the child and parent cannot be\r\nattributed to both having been exposed to the same unusual conditions, then\r\nthe following problem is worth consideration, as showing that the result\r\ncannot be due, as some authors have supposed, to mere coincidence, but must\r\nbe consequent on the members of the same family inheriting something in\r\ncommon in their constitution. Let it be assumed that, in a large\r\npopulation, a particular affection occurs on an average in one out of a\r\nmillion, so that the a priori chance that an individual taken at random\r\nwill be so affected is only one in a million. Let the population consist of\r\nsixty millions, composed, we will assume, of ten million families, each\r\ncontaining six members. On these data, Professor Stokes has calculated for\r\nme that the odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in the ten\r\nmillion families there will not be even a single family in which one parent\r\nand two children will be affected by the peculiarity in question. But\r\nnumerous instances could be given, in which several children have been\r\naffected by the same rare peculiarity with one of their parents; and in\r\nthis case, more especially if the grandchildren be included in the\r\ncalculation, the odds against mere coincidence become something prodigious,\r\nalmost beyond enumeration.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we\r\nconsider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities. Dr. Hodgkin formerly\r\ntold me of an English family in which, for many generations, some members\r\nhad a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the hair. I knew an\r\nIrish gentleman, who, on the right side of his head, had a small white lock\r\nin the midst of his dark hair: he assured me that his grandmother had a\r\nsimilar lock on the same side, and his mother on the opposite side. But it\r\nis superfluous to give instances; every shade of expression, which may\r\noften be seen alike in parents and children, tells the same story. On what\r\na curious combination of corporeal structure, mental character, and\r\ntraining, handwriting depends! yet every one must have noted the occasional\r\nclose similarity of the handwriting in father and son, although the father\r\nhad not taught his son. A great collector of autographs assured me that in\r\nhis collection there were several signatures of father and son hardly\r\ndistinguishable except by their dates. Hofacker, in Germany, remarks on the\r\ninheritance of handwriting; and it has even been asserted that English boys\r\nwhen taught to write in France naturally cling to their English manner of\r\nwriting; but for so extraordinary a statement more evidence is requisite.\r\n(12/8. Hofacker 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc. 1828 s. 34. With respect to\r\nFrance, Report by Pariset in 'Comptes Rendus' 1847 page 592.) Gait,\r\ngestures, voice, and general bearing are all inherited, as the illustrious\r\nHunter and Sir A. Carlisle have insisted. (12/9. Hunter as quoted in\r\nHarlan's 'Med. Researches' page 530. Sir A. Carlisle 'Phil. Transact.' 1814\r\npage 94.) My father communicated to me some striking instances, in one of\r\nwhich a man died during the early infancy of his son, and my father, who\r\ndid not see this son until grown up and out of health, declared that it\r\nseemed to him as if his old friend had risen from the grave, with all his\r\nhighly peculiar habits and manners. Peculiar manners pass into tricks, and\r\nseveral instances could be given of their inheritance; as in the case,\r\noften quoted, of the father who generally slept on his back, with his right\r\nleg crossed over the left, and whose daughter, whilst an infant in the\r\ncradle, followed exactly the same habit, though an attempt was made to cure\r\nher. (12/10. Girou de Buzareingues 'De la Generation' page 282. I have\r\ngiven an analogous case in my book on 'The Expression of the Emotions.') I\r\nwill give one instance which has fallen under my own observation, and which\r\nis curious from being a trick associated with a peculiar state of mind,\r\nnamely, pleasureable emotion. A boy had the singular habit, when pleased,\r\nof rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other, and, when much\r\nexcited, of raising both hands, with the fingers still moving, to the sides\r\nof his face on a level with the eyes; when this boy was almost an old man,\r\nhe could still hardly resist this trick when much pleased, but from its\r\nabsurdity concealed it. He had eight children. Of these, a girl, when\r\npleased, at the age of four and a half years, moved her fingers in exactly\r\nthe same way, and what is still odder, when much excited, she raised both\r\nher hands, with her fingers still moving, to the sides of her face, in\r\nexactly the same manner as her father had done, and sometimes even still\r\ncontinued to do so when alone. I never heard of any one, excepting this one\r\nman and his little daughter, who had this strange habit; and certainly\r\nimitation was in this instance out of the question.\r\n\r\nSome writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes, on which\r\ngenius and talent depend, are inherited, even when both parents are thus\r\nendowed. But he who will study Mr. Galton's able work on 'Hereditary\r\nGenius' will have its doubts allayed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it matters not, as far as inheritance is concerned, how\r\ninjurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life. No one can\r\nread the many treatises (12/11. The works which I have read and found most\r\nuseful are Dr. Prosper Lucas's great work 'Traite de l'Heredite Naturelle'\r\n1847; Mr. W. Sedgwick in 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April\r\nand July 1861 and April and July 1863: Dr. Garrod on Gout is quoted in\r\nthese articles. Sir Henry Holland 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 3rd\r\nedition 1855. Piorry 'De l'Heredite dans les Maladies' 1840. Adams 'A\r\nPhilosophical Treatise on Hereditary Peculiarities' 2nd edition 1815. Essay\r\non 'Hereditary Diseases' by Dr. J. Steinan 1843. See Paget in 'Medical\r\nTimes' 1857 page 192 on the Inheritance of Cancer; Dr. Gould in 'Proc. of\r\nAmerican Acad. of Sciences' November 8, 1853 gives a curious case of\r\nhereditary bleeding in four generations. Harlan 'Medical Researches' page\r\n593.) on hereditary disease and doubt this. The ancients were strongly of\r\nthis opinion, or, as Ranchin expresses it, Omnes Graeci, Arabes, et Latini\r\nin eo consentiunt. A long catalogue could be given of all sorts of\r\ninherited malformations and of predisposition to various diseases. With\r\ngout, fifty per cent of the cases observed in hospital practice are,\r\naccording to Dr. Garrod, inherited, and a greater percentage in private\r\npractice. Every one knows how often insanity runs in families, and some of\r\nthe cases given by Mr. Sedgwick are awful,--as of a surgeon, whose brother,\r\nfather, and four paternal uncles were all insane, the latter dying by\r\nsuicide; of a Jew, whose father, mother, and six brothers and sisters were\r\nall mad; and in some other cases several members of the same family, during\r\nthree or four successive generations, have committed suicide. Striking\r\ninstances have been recorded of epilepsy, consumption, asthma, stone in the\r\nbladder, cancer, profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries, of the\r\nmother not giving milk, and of bad parturition being inherited. In this\r\nlatter respect I may mention an odd case given by a good observer (12/12.\r\nMarshall quoted by Youatt in his work on 'Cattle' page 284.), in which the\r\nfault lay in the offspring, and not in the mother: in a part of Yorkshire\r\nthe farmers continued to select cattle with large hind-quarters, until they\r\nmade a strain called \"Dutch-buttocked,\" and \"the monstrous size of the\r\nbuttocks of the calf was frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows\r\nwere annually lost in calving.\"\r\n\r\n[Instead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations and\r\ndiseases, I will confine myself to one organ, that which is the most\r\ncomplex, delicate, and probably best-known in the human frame, namely, the\r\neye, with its accessory parts. (12/13. Almost any other organ might have\r\nbeen selected. For instance Mr. J. Tomes 'System of Dental Surgery' 2nd\r\nedition 1873 page 114 gives many instances with teeth, and others have been\r\ncommunicated to me.) To begin with the latter: I have received an account\r\nof a family in which one parent and the children are affected by drooping\r\neyelids, in so peculiar a manner, that they cannot see without throwing\r\ntheir heads backwards. Mr. Wade, of Wakefield, has given me an analogous\r\ncase of a man who had not his eyelids thus affected at birth, nor owed\r\ntheir state, as far as was known, to inheritance, but they began to droop\r\nwhilst he was an infant after suffering from fits, and he has transmitted\r\nthe affection to two out of his three children, as was evident in the\r\nphotographs of the whole family sent to me together with this account. Sir\r\nA. Carlisle (12/14. 'Philosoph. Transact.' 1814 page 94.) specifies a\r\npendulous fold to the eyelids, as inherited. \"In a family,\" says Sir H.\r\nHolland (12/15. 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 3rd edition page 33.)\r\n\"where the father had a singular elongation of the upper eyelid, seven or\r\neight children were born with the same deformity; two or three other\r\nchildren having it not.\" Many persons, as I hear from Sir J. Paget, have\r\ntwo or three hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others; and even\r\nso trifling a peculiarity as this certainly runs in families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the eye itself, the highest authority in England, Mr.\r\nBowman, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain\r\ninherited imperfections. First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight: in\r\nthis affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat from\r\nfront to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the retina is\r\nbrought too forward for the focus of the humours; consequently a convex\r\nglass is required for clear vision of near objects, and frequently even of\r\ndistant ones. This state occurs congenitally, or at a very early age, often\r\nin several children of the same family, where one of the parents has\r\npresented it. (12/16. This affection, as I hear from Mr. Bowman, has been\r\nably described and spoken of as hereditary by Dr. Donders of Utrecht, whose\r\nwork was published in English by the Sydenham Society in 1864.) Secondly,\r\nmyopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped and too long from\r\nfront to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus, and is\r\ntherefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This condition\r\nis not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the liability to it\r\nbeing well known to be transmissible from parent to child. The change from\r\nthe spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the immediate consequence of\r\nsomething like inflammation of the coats, under which they yield, and there\r\nis ground for believing that it may often originate in causes acting on the\r\nindividual affected (12/17. M. Giraud-Teulon has recently collected\r\nabundant statistical evidence, 'Revue des Cours Scientifiques' September\r\n1870 page 625, showing that short sight is due to the habit of viewing\r\nobjects from a short distance, c'est le travail assidu, de pres.) and may\r\nthenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are myopic Mr. Bowman\r\nhas observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be heightened,\r\nand some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or in a higher\r\ndegree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting is a familiar example of\r\nhereditary transmission: it is frequently a result of such optical defects\r\nas have been above mentioned; but the more primary and uncomplicated forms\r\nof it are also sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family.\r\nFourthly, CATARACT, or opacity of the crystalline lens, is commonly\r\nobserved in persons whose parents have been similarly affected, and often\r\nat an earlier age in the children than in the parents. Occasionally more\r\nthan one child in a family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other\r\nrelations, presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract affects\r\nseveral members of a family in the same generation, it is often seen to\r\ncommence at about the same age in each: e.g., in one family several infants\r\nor young persons may suffer from it; in another, several persons of middle\r\nage. Mr. Bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen, in several\r\nmembers of the same family, various defects in either the right or left\r\neye; and Mr. White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined\r\nto one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring. (12/18. Quoted by\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer 'Principles of Biology' volume 1 page 244.)\r\n\r\nThe following cases are taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick, and\r\nfrom Dr. Prosper Lucas. (12/19. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg.\r\nReview' April 1861 pages 482-6; 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 pages 391-408.)\r\nAmaurosis, either congenital or coming on late in life, and causing total\r\nblindness, is often inherited; it has been observed in three successive\r\ngenerations. Congenital absence of the iris has likewise been transmitted\r\nfor three generations, a cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in\r\nthis latter case to the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and\r\ncongenital smallness of the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a\r\ncurious case, in which a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever\r\nthe head was bent downwards, apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with\r\nits capsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior\r\nchamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright\r\nlight, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see except\r\nunder a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of this\r\nlatter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same family during\r\nsix generations. The singular incapacity of distinguishing colours, which\r\nhas been called DALTONISM, is notoriously hereditary, and has been traced\r\nthrough five generations, in which it was confined to the female sex.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the colour of the iris: deficiency of colouring matter is\r\nwell known to be hereditary in albinoes. The iris of one eye being of\r\ndifferent colour from that of the other, and the iris being spotted, are\r\ncases which have been inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in addition, on the\r\nauthority of Dr. Osborne (12/20. Dr. Osborne, Pres. of Royal College of\r\nPhys. in Ireland, published this case in the 'Dublin Medical Journal' for\r\n1835.), the following curious instance of strong inheritance: a family of\r\nsixteen sons and five daughters all had eyes \"resembling in miniature the\r\nmarkings on the back of a tortoiseshell cat.\" The mother of this large\r\nfamily had three sisters and a brother all similarly marked, and they\r\nderived this peculiarity from their mother, who belonged to a family\r\nnotorious for transmitting it to their posterity.\r\n\r\nFinally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single\r\nfaculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies; and not one which is\r\nnot subjected to the principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees with the\r\ngeneral truth of this proposition; which of course does not imply that all\r\nmalformations are necessarily inherited; this would not even follow if both\r\nparents were affected by an anomaly which in most cases was transmissible.]\r\n\r\nEven if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance of\r\ndisease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample in the\r\ncase of the horse. And this might have been expected, as horses breed much\r\nquicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have\r\nconsulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of\r\nall nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising.\r\nAuthors who have had wide experience give in detail many singular cases,\r\nand assert that contracted feet, with the numerous contingent evils, of\r\nring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs,\r\nroaring or broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and\r\nblindness (the great French veterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a\r\nblind race could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing and ill-temper, are\r\nall plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying \"there is scarcely a\r\nmalady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;\" and M.\r\nBernard adds that the doctrine \"that there is scarcely a disease which does\r\nnot run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day.\" (12/21. These\r\nvarious statements are taken from the following works and papers:--Youatt\r\non 'The Horse' pages 35, 220. Lawrence 'The Horse' page 30. Karkeek in an\r\nexcellent paper in 'Gard. Chronicle' 1853 page 92. Mr. Burke in 'Journal of\r\nR. Agricul. Soc. of England' volume 5 page 511. 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports'\r\npage 279. Girou de Buzareingues 'Philosoph. Phys.' page 215. See following\r\npapers in 'The Veterinary;' Roberts in volume 2 page 144; M. Marrimpoey\r\nvolume 2 page 387; Mr. Karkeek volume 4 page 5; Youatt on Goitre in 'Dogs'\r\nvolume 5 page 483: Youatt in volume 6 pages 66, 348, 412; M. Bernard volume\r\n11 page 539; Dr. Samesreuther on 'Cattle' in volume 12 page 181; Percivall\r\nin volume 13 page 47. With respect to blindness in horses see also a whole\r\nrow of authorities in Dr. P. Lucas's great work, tome 1 page 399. Mr. Baker\r\nin 'The Veterinary' volume 13 page 721, gives a strong case of hereditary\r\nimperfect vision and of jibbing.) So it is in regard to cattle, with\r\nconsumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, etc. etc. But enough, and more\r\nthan enough, has been said on disease. Andrew Knight, from his own\r\nexperience, asserts that disease is hereditary with plants; and this\r\nassertion is endorsed by Lindley. (12/22. Knight on 'The Culture of the\r\nApple and Pear' page 34. Lindley's 'Horticulture' page 180.)\r\n\r\nSeeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is fortunate that good health,\r\nvigour, and longevity are equally inherited. It was formerly a well-known\r\npractice, when annuities were purchased to be received during the life-time\r\nof a nominee, to search out a person belonging to a family of which many\r\nmembers had lived to extreme old age. As to the inheritance of vigour and\r\nendurance, the English race-horse offers an excellent instance. Eclipse\r\nbegot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A \"cock-tail\" is a horse not purely\r\nbred, but with only one-eighth, or one-sixteenth impure blood in his veins,\r\nyet very few instances have ever occurred of such horses having won a great\r\nrace. They are sometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds, but\r\nas Mr. Robson, the great trainer, asserts, they are deficient in wind, and\r\ncannot keep up the pace. Mr. Lawrence also remarks, \"perhaps no instance\r\nhas ever occurred of a three-part-bred horse saving his 'DISTANCE' in\r\nrunning two miles with thoroughbred racers.\" It has been stated by Cecil,\r\nthat when unknown horses, whose parents were not celebrated, have\r\nunexpectedly won great races, as in the case of Priam, they can always be\r\nproved to be descended, on both sides, through many generations, from\r\nfirst-rate ancestors. On the Continent, Baron Cameronn challenges, in a\r\nGerman veterinary periodical, the opponents of the English race-horse to\r\nname one good horse on the Continent, which has not some English race-blood\r\nin his veins. (12/23. These statements are taken from the following works\r\nin order:--Youatt on 'The Horse' page 48; Mr. Darvill in 'The Veterinary'\r\nvolume 8 page 50. With respect to Robson see 'The Veterinary' volume 3 page\r\n580; Mr. Lawrence on 'The Horse' 1829 page 9; 'The Stud Farm' by Cecil\r\n1851; Baron Cameronn quoted in 'The Veterinary' volume 10 page 500.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the transmission of the many slight, but infinitely\r\ndiversified characters, by which the domestic races of animals and plants\r\nare distinguished, nothing need be said; for the very existence of\r\npersistent races proclaims the power of inheritance.\r\n\r\nA few special cases, however, deserve some consideration. It might have\r\nbeen anticipated, that deviations from the law of symmetry would not have\r\nbeen inherited. But Anderson (12/24. 'Recreations in Agriculture and Nat.\r\nHist.' volume 1 page 68.) states that a rabbit produced in a litter a young\r\nanimal having only one ear; and from this animal a breed was formed which\r\nsteadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also mentions a bitch with a single\r\nleg deficient, and she produced several puppies with the same deficiency.\r\nFrom Hofacker's account (12/25. 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc. 1828 s.\r\n107.) it appears that a one-horned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in\r\nGermany, in 1788 two, and afterwards, from year to year, many were observed\r\nwith only one horn on the right side of the head. A cow lost a horn by\r\nsuppuration (12/26. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 132.), and she\r\nproduced three calves which had on the same side of the head, instead of a\r\nhorn, a small bony lump attached merely to the skin; but we here encroach\r\non the subject of inherited mutilations. A man who is left-handed, and a\r\nshell in which the spire turns in the wrong directions, are departures from\r\nthe normal asymmetrical condition, and they are well-known to be inherited.\r\n\r\n[POLYDACTYLISM.\r\n\r\nSupernumerary fingers and toes are eminently liable, as various authors\r\nhave insisted, to be inherited. Polydactylism graduates (12/27. Vrolik has\r\ndiscussed this point at full length in a work published in Dutch, from\r\nwhich Sir J. Paget has kindly translated for me passages. See, also,\r\nIsidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' 1832 tome 1 page 684.)\r\nby multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous appendage, not including any\r\nbone, to a double hand. But an additional digit, supported on a metacarpal\r\nbone, and furnished with all the proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is\r\nsometimes so perfect, that it escapes detection, unless the fingers are\r\nactually counted. Occasionally there are several supernumerary digits; but\r\nusually only one, making the total number six. This one may be attached to\r\nthe inner or outer margin of the hand, representing either a thumb or\r\nlittle finger, the latter being the more frequent. Generally, through the\r\nlaw of correlation, both hands and both feet are similarly affected. Dr.\r\nBurt Wilder has tabulated (12/28. 'Massachusetts Medical Society' volume 2\r\nNo. 3; and 'Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.' volume 14 1871 page 154.) a\r\nlarge number of cases, and finds that supernumerary digits are more common\r\non the hands than on the feet, and that men are affected oftener than\r\nwomen. Both these facts can be explained on two principles which seem\r\ngenerally to hold good; firstly, that of two parts, the more specialised\r\none is the more variable, and the arm is more highly specialised than the\r\nleg; and secondly that male animals are more variable than females.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a greater number of digits than five is a great anomaly,\r\nfor this number is not normally exceeded by any existing mammal, bird, or\r\nreptile. Nevertheless, supernumerary digits are strongly inherited; they\r\nhave been transmitted through five generations; and in some cases, after\r\ndisappearing for one, two, or even three generations, have reappeared\r\nthrough reversion. These facts are rendered, as Professor Huxley has\r\nobserved, more remarkable from its being known in most cases that the\r\naffected person has not married one similarly affected. In such cases the\r\nchild of the fifth generation would have only 1-32nd part of the blood of\r\nhis first sedigitated ancestor. Other cases are rendered remarkable by the\r\naffection gathering force, as Dr. Struthers has shown, in each generation,\r\nthough in each the affected person married one not affected; moreover, such\r\nadditional digits are often amputated soon after birth, and can seldom have\r\nbeen strengthened by use. Dr. Struthers gives the following instance: in\r\nthe first generation an additional digit appeared on one hand; in the\r\nsecond, on both hands; in the third, three brothers had both hands, and one\r\nof the brothers a foot affected; and in the fourth generation all four\r\nlimbs were affected. Yet we must not over-estimate the force of\r\ninheritance. Dr. Struthers asserts that cases of non-inheritance and of the\r\nfirst appearance of additional digits in unaffected families are much more\r\nfrequent than cases of inheritance. Many other deviations of structure, of\r\na nature almost as anomalous as supernumerary digits, such as deficient\r\nphalanges (12/29. Dr. J.W. Ogle gives a case of the inheritance of\r\ndeficient phalanges during four generations. He adds references to various\r\nrecent papers on inheritance 'Brit. and For. Med.-Chirurg. Review' April\r\n1872.), thickened joints, crooked fingers, etc., are, in like manner,\r\nstrongly inherited, and are equally subject to intermission, together with\r\nreversion, though in such cases there is no reason to suppose that both\r\nparents had been similarly affected. (12/30. For these several statements\r\nsee Dr. Struthers 'Edinburgh New Phil. Journal' July 1863 especially on\r\nintermissions in the line of descent. Prof. Huxley 'Lectures on our\r\nKnowledge of Organic Nature' 1863 page 97. With respect to inheritance, see\r\nDr. Prosper Lucas 'L'Heredite Nat.' tome 1 page 325. Isid. Geoffroy 'Anom.'\r\ntome 1 page 701. Sir A. Carlisle in 'Phil. Transact.' 1814 page 94. A.\r\nWalker on 'Intermarriage' 1838 page 140 gives a case of five generations;\r\nas does Mr. Sedgwick in 'Brit. and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April\r\n1863 page 462. On the inheritance of other anomalies in the extremities see\r\nDr. H. Dobell in volume 46 of Medico-Chirurg. Transactions 1863; also Mr.\r\nSedgwick in op. cit. April 1863 page 460. With respect to additional digits\r\nin the negro see Prichard 'Physical History of Mankind.' Dr. Dieffenbach\r\n'Jour. Royal Geograph. Soc.' 1841 page 208 says this anomaly is not\r\nuncommon with the Polynesians of the Chatham Islands; and I have heard of\r\nseveral cases with Hindus and Arabs.)\r\n\r\nAdditional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other races\r\nof man, and in several of the lower animals, and have been inherited. Six\r\ntoes have been described on the hind feet of the newt (Salamandra\r\ncristata), and are said to have occurred with the frog. It deserves notice,\r\nthat the six-toed newt, though adult, preserved some of its larval\r\ncharacters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly absorbed\r\nduring the act of metamorphosis, was retained. It is also remarkable that\r\nin the case of man various structures in an embryonic or arrested state of\r\ndevelopment, such as a cleft-palate, bifid uterus, etc., are often\r\naccompanied by polydactylism. (12/31. Meckel and Isid G. St. Hilaire insist\r\non this fact. See also M. A. Roujou 'Sur quelques Analogies du Type Humain'\r\npage 61 published, I believe, in the 'Journal of the Anthropolog. Soc. of\r\nParis' January 1872.) Six toes on the hinder feet are known to have been\r\ninherited for three generations of cats. In several breeds of the fowl the\r\nhinder toe is double, and is generally transmitted truly, as is well shown\r\nwhen Dorkings are crossed with common four-toed breeds (12/32. 'The Poultry\r\nChronicle' 1854 page 559.) With animals which have properly less than five\r\ndigits, the number is sometimes increased to five, especially on the front\r\nlegs, though rarely carried beyond that number; but this is due to the\r\ndevelopment of a digit already existing in a more or less rudimentary\r\nstate. Thus, the dog has properly four toes behind, but in the larger\r\nbreeds a fifth toe is commonly, though not perfectly, developed. Horses,\r\nwhich properly have one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the\r\nothers, have been described with each foot bearing two or three small\r\nseparate hoofs: analogous facts have been noticed with cows, sheep, goats,\r\nand pigs. (12/33. The statements in this paragraph are taken from Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' tome 1 pages 688-693. Mr.\r\nGoodman gives, 'Phil. Soc. of Cambridge' November 25, 1872 the case of a\r\ncow with three well developed toes on each hind limb, besides the ordinary\r\nrudiments; and her calf by an ordinary bull had extra digits. This calf\r\nalso bore two calves having extra digits.)\r\n\r\nThere is a famous case described by Mr. White of a child, three years old,\r\nwith a thumb double from the first joint. He removed the lesser thumb,\r\nwhich was furnished with a nail; but to his astonishment it grew again and\r\nreproduced a nail. The child was then taken to an eminent London surgeon,\r\nand the newly-grown thumb was removed by its socket-joint, but again it\r\ngrew and reproduced a nail. Dr. Struthers mentions a case of the partial\r\nregrowth of an additional thumb, amputated when a child was three months\r\nold; and the late Dr. Falconer communicated to me an analogous instance. In\r\nthe last edition of this work I also gave a case of the regrowth of a\r\nsupernumerary little-finger after amputation; but having been informed by\r\nDr. Bachmaier that several eminent surgeons expressed, at a meeting of the\r\nAnthropological Society of Munich, great doubt about my statements, I have\r\nmade more particular inquiries. The full information thus gained, together\r\nwith a tracing of the hand in its present state, has been laid before Sir\r\nJ. Paget, and he has come to the conclusion that the degree of regrowth in\r\nthis case is not greater than sometimes occurs with normal bones,\r\nespecially with the humerus, when amputated at an early age. He further\r\ndoes not feel fully satisfied about the facts recorded by Mr. White. This\r\nbeing so, it is necessary for me to withdraw the view which I formerly\r\nadvanced, with much hesitation, chiefly on the ground of the supposed\r\nregrowth of additional digits, namely, that their occasional development in\r\nman is a case of reversion to a lowly, organised progenitor provided with\r\nmore than five digits.]\r\n\r\nI may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to, but somewhat\r\ndifferent from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland (12/34.\r\n'Medical Notes and Reflections' 1839 pages 24, 34. See also Dr. P. Lucas\r\n'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 page 33.) states that brothers and sisters of the\r\nsame family are frequently affected, often at about the same age, by the\r\nsame peculiar disease, not known to have previously occurred in the family.\r\nHe specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years\r\nold; he also remarks that children of the same family often exhibit in\r\ncommon infantile diseases, the same peculiar symptoms. My father mentioned\r\nto me the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and\r\nseventy, in the same highly peculiar comatose state. An instance has\r\nalready been given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children out\r\nof six in a previously unaffected family. Dr. Devay states (12/35. 'Du\r\nDanger des Mariages Consanguins' 2nd edition 1862 page 103.) that two\r\nbrothers married two sisters, their first-cousins, none of the four nor any\r\nrelation being an albino; but the seven children produced from this double\r\nmarriage were all perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as Mr. Sedgwick\r\n(12/36. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' July 1863 pages 183,\r\n189.) has shown, are probably the result of reversion to a remote ancestor,\r\nof whom no record had been preserved; and all these cases are so far\r\ndirectly connected with inheritance that no doubt the children inherited a\r\nsimilar constitution from their parents, and, from being exposed to nearly\r\nsimilar conditions of life, it is not surprising that they should be\r\naffected in the same manner and at the same period of life.\r\n\r\nMost of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of\r\ninheritance, but we must now consider cases grouped as well as the subject\r\nallows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or deficient the power\r\nof inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity first appears, we can\r\nnever predict whether it will be inherited. If both parents from their\r\nbirth present the same peculiarity, the probability is strong that it will\r\nbe transmitted to at least some of their offspring. We have seen that\r\nvariegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed, taken from a branch\r\nwhich had become variegated through bud-variation, than from plants which\r\nwere variegated as seedlings. With most plants the power of transmission\r\nnotoriously depends on some innate capacity in the individual: thus\r\nVilmorin (12/37. Verlot 'La Product. des Varietes' 1865 page 32.) raised\r\nfrom a peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings, which all resembled their\r\nparent; but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new character,\r\nwhilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during several\r\nsuccessive generations. So again with a variety of the rose, two plants\r\nalone out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the\r\ndesired character; numerous analogous cases could be given.\r\n\r\n[The weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some\r\ncases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I have\r\nselected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance, because\r\nit is certainly not proper to the parent-species, and because, both sexes\r\nbeing borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same character.\r\nEven supposing that there may have been in some instances crossing with\r\nadjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable that all the\r\nseedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court there is a famous\r\nweeping oak; many of its branches \"are 30 feet long, and no thicker in any\r\npart of this length than a common rope:\" this tree transmits its weeping\r\ncharacter, in a greater or less degree, to all its seedlings; some of the\r\nyoung oaks being so flexible that they have to be supported by props;\r\nothers not showing the weeping tendency till about twenty years old.\r\n(12/38. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 12 1836 page 368.) Mr. Rivers\r\nfertilised, as he informs me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn\r\n(Crataegus oxyacantha) with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and\r\nthree young trees, \"now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to\r\nbe pendulous, but as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant.\" According\r\nto Mr. MacNab (12/39. Verlot 'La Product. des Varietes' 1865 page 94.),\r\nseedlings from a magnificent weeping birch (Betula alba), in the Botanic\r\nGarden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen years upright, but\r\nthen all became weepers like their parent. A peach with pendulous branches,\r\nlike those of the weeping willow, has been found capable of propagation by\r\nseed. (12/40. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 121. Mr. Meehan makes a\r\nsimilar statement in 'Proc. Nat. of Philadelphia' 1872 page 235.) Lastly, a\r\nweeping or rather a prostrate yew (Taxus baccata) was found in a hedge in\r\nShropshire; it was a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced\r\nberries; these, being sown, produced seventeen trees all of which had\r\nexactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree. (12/41. Rev. W.A.\r\nLeighton 'Flora of Shropshire' page 497; and Charlesworth 'Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.' volume 1 1837 page 30. I possess prostrate trees produced from these\r\nseeds.)\r\n\r\nThese facts, it might have been thought, would have been sufficient to\r\nrender it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be strictly\r\ninherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab (12/42. Verlot op.\r\ncit. page 93.) sowed seeds of the weeping beech (Fagus sylvatica), but\r\nsucceeded in raising only common beeches. Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised\r\na number of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm; and at\r\nleast one of the parent-trees was so situated that it could not have been\r\ncrossed by any other elm; but none of the young trees, now about a foot or\r\ntwo in height, show the least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly sowed\r\nabove twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and\r\nnot a single seedling was in the least degree pendulous: in Germany, M.\r\nBorchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with the same result. Nevertheless,\r\nMr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic Garden, by sowing seed from a weeping\r\nash, which was found before the year 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised\r\nseveral pendulous trees. (12/43. For these several statements see Loudon's\r\n'Gard. Magazine' volume 10 1834 pages 408, 180; and volume 9 1833 page\r\n597.) Professor Henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female\r\nweeping ash in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge were at first a little\r\npendulous, but afterwards became quite upright: it is probable that this\r\nlatter tree, which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous habit, was\r\nderived by a bud from the same original Cambridgeshire stock; whilst other\r\nweeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But the crowning case,\r\ncommunicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how capricious is the\r\ninheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety of another species of\r\nash (F. lentiscifolia), now about twenty years old, which was formerly\r\npendulous, \"has long lost this habit, every shoot being remarkably erect;\r\nbut seedlings formerly raised from it were perfectly prostrate, the stems\r\nnot rising more than two inches above the ground.\" Thus the weeping variety\r\nof the common ash, which has been extensively propagated by buds during a\r\nlong period, did not with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one\r\nseedling out of above twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a\r\nsecond species of ash, which could not, whilst grown in the same garden,\r\nretain its own weeping character, transmitted to its character the\r\npendulous habit in excess!\r\n\r\nMany analogous facts could be given, showing how apparently capricious is\r\nthe principle of inheritance. All the seedlings from a variety of the\r\nBarberry (B. vulgaris) with red leaves inherited the same character; only\r\nabout one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech (Fagus sylvatica) had\r\npurple leaves. Not one out of a hundred seedlings of a variety of the\r\nCerasus padus, with yellow fruit, bore yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the\r\nseedlings of the variety of Cornus mascula, with yellow fruit, came true\r\n(12/44. These statements are taken from Alph. De Candolle 'Bot. Geograph.'\r\npage 1083.): and lastly, all the trees raised by my father from a yellow-\r\nberried holly (Ilex aquifolium), found wild, produced yellow berries.\r\nVilmorin (12/45. Verlot op. cit. page 38.) observed in a bed of Saponaria\r\ncalabrica an extremely dwarf variety, and raised from it a large number of\r\nseedlings; some of these partially resembled their parent, and he selected\r\ntheir seed; but the grandchildren were not in the least dwarfed: on the\r\nother hand, he observed a stunted and bushy variety of Tagetes signata\r\ngrowing in the midst of the common varieties by which it was probably\r\ncrossed; for most of the seedlings raised from this plant were intermediate\r\nin character, only two perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved\r\nfrom these two plants reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any\r\nselection has since been necessary.\r\n\r\nFlowers transmit their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many annuals\r\ncome true: thus I purchased German seeds of thirty-four named sub-varieties\r\nof one RACE of ten-week stocks (Matthiola annua), and raised a hundred and\r\nforty plants, all of which, with the exception of a single plant, came\r\ntrue. In saying this, however, it must be understood that I could\r\ndistinguish only twenty kinds out of the thirty-four named sub-varieties;\r\nnor did the colour of the flower always correspond with the name affixed to\r\nthe packet; but I say that they came true, because in each of the thirty-\r\nsix short rows every plant was absolutely alike, with the one single\r\nexception. Again, I procured packets of German seed of twenty-five named\r\nvarieties of common and quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-\r\nfour plants; of these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense;\r\nand I considered even a wrong shade of colour as false.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit their\r\ncolour much more truly than any other variety. This fact probably stands in\r\nclose relation with one observed by Verlot (12/46. Op. cit. page 59.),\r\nnamely, that flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other\r\ncolour. I have found that the white varieties of Delphinium consolida and\r\nof the Stock are the truest. It is, indeed, sufficient to look through a\r\nnurseryman's seed-list, to see the large number of white varieties which\r\ncan be propagated by seed. The several coloured varieties of the sweet-pea\r\n(Lathyrus odoratus) are very true; but I hear from Mr. Masters, of\r\nCanterbury, who has particularly attended to this plant, that the white\r\nvariety is the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by seed, is extremely\r\ninconstant in colour, but \"white hyacinths almost always give by seed\r\nwhite-flowered plants\" (12/47. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page\r\n1082.); and Mr. Masters informs me that the yellow varieties also reproduce\r\ntheir colour, but of different shades. On the other hand, pink and blue\r\nvarieties, the latter being the natural colour, are not nearly so true:\r\nhence, as Mr. Masters has remarked to me, \"we see that a garden variety may\r\nacquire a more permanent habit than a natural species;\" but it should have\r\nbeen added, that this occurs under cultivation, and therefore under changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWith many flowers, especially perennials, nothing can be more fluctuating\r\nthan the colour of the seedlings, as is notoriously the case with verbenas,\r\ncarnations, dahlias, cinerarias, and others. (12/48. See 'Cottage Gardener'\r\nApril 10, 1860 page 18 and September 10, 1861 page 456; 'Gardener's\r\nChronicle' 1845 page 102.) I sowed seed of twelve named varieties of\r\nSnapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), and utter confusion was the result. In most\r\ncases the extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in\r\nchief part due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties during\r\nprevious generations. It is almost certain that this is the case with the\r\npolyanthus and coloured primrose (Primula veris and vulgaris), from their\r\nreciprocally dimorphic structure (12/49. Darwin in 'Journal of Proc. Linn.\r\nSoc. Bot.' 1862 page 94.); and these are plants which florists speak of as\r\nnever coming true by seed: but if care be taken to prevent crossing,\r\nneither species is by any means very inconstant, in colour; thus I raised\r\ntwenty-three plants from a purple primrose, fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with\r\nits pollen, and eighteen came up purple of different shades, and only five\r\nreverted to the ordinary yellow colour: again, I raised twenty plants from\r\na bright-red cowslip, similarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one\r\nperfectly resembled its parent in colour, as likewise did, with the\r\nexception of a single plant, 72 grandchildren. Even with the most variable\r\nflowers, it is probable that each delicate shade of colour might be\r\npermanently fixed so as to be transmitted by seed, by cultivation in the\r\nsame soil, by long-continued selection, and especially by the prevention of\r\ncrosses. I infer this from certain annual larkspurs (Delphinium consolida\r\nand ajacis), of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of\r\ncolour than any other plant known to me; yet on procuring seed of five\r\nnamed German varieties of D. consolida, only nine plants out of ninety-four\r\nwere false; and the seedlings of six varieties of D. ajacis were true in\r\nthe same manner and degree as with the stocks above described. A\r\ndistinguished botanist maintains that the annual species of Delphinium are\r\nalways self-fertilised; therefore I may mention that thirty-two flowers on\r\na branch of D. consolida, enclosed in a net, yielded twenty-seven capsules,\r\nwith an average of 17.2 seed in each; whilst five flowers, under the same\r\nnet, which were artificially fertilised, in the same manner as must be\r\neffected by bees during their incessant visits, yielded five capsules with\r\nan average of 35.2 fine seed; and this shows that the agency of insects is\r\nnecessary for the full fertility of this plant. Analogous facts could be\r\ngiven with respect to the crossing of many other flowers, such as\r\ncarnations, etc., of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour.\r\n\r\nAs with flowers, so with our domesticated animals, no character is more\r\nvariable than colour, and probably in no animal more so than with the\r\nhorse. Yet, with a little care in breeding, it appears that races of any\r\ncolour might soon be formed. Hofacker gives the result of matching two\r\nhundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with like-coloured\r\nstallions, without regard to the colour of their ancestors; and of the two\r\nhundred and sixteen colts born, eleven alone failed to inherit the colour\r\nof their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon assert that, after two generations,\r\ncolts of a uniform colour are produced with certainty. (12/50. Hofacker\r\n'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc. s. 10.)]\r\n\r\nIn a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited, apparently from the\r\nforce of inheritance being too strong. I have been assured by breeders of\r\nthe canary-bird that to get a good jonquil-coloured bird it does not answer\r\nto pair two jonquils, as the colour then comes out too strong, or is even\r\nbrown; but this statement is disputed by other breeders. So again, if two\r\ncrested canaries are paired, the young birds rarely inherit this character\r\n(12/51. Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' b. 4 s. 462. Mr. Brent, a\r\ngreat breeder of canaries, informs me that he believes that these\r\nstatements are correct.): for in crested birds a narrow space of bare skin\r\nis left on the back of the head, where the feathers are up-turned to form\r\nthe crest, and, when both parents are thus characterised, the bareness\r\nbecomes excessive, and the crest itself fails to be developed. Mr. Hewitt,\r\nspeaking of Laced Sebright Bantams, says (12/52. 'The Poultry Book' by W.B.\r\nTegetmeier 1866 page 245.) that, \"why this should be so I know not, but I\r\nam confident that those that are best laced frequently produce offspring\r\nvery far from perfect in their markings, whilst those exhibited by myself,\r\nwhich have so often proved successful, were bred from the union of heavily-\r\nlaced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently laced.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that, although several deaf-mutes often occur in the\r\nsame family, and though their cousins and other relations are often in the\r\nsame condition, yet their parents are rarely deaf-mutes. To give a single\r\ninstance: not one scholar out of 148, who were at the same time in the\r\nLondon Institution, was the child of parents similarly affected. So again,\r\nwhen a male or female deaf-mute marries a sound person, their children are\r\nmost rarely affected: in Ireland, out of 203 children thus produced one\r\nalone was mute. Even when both parents have been deaf-mutes, as in the case\r\nof forty-one marriages in the United States and of six in Ireland, only two\r\ndeaf and dumb children were produced. Mr. Sedgwick (12/53. 'British and\r\nForeign Med.-Chirurg. Review' July 1861 pages 200-204. Mr. Sedgwick has\r\ngiven such full details on this subject, with ample references, that I need\r\nrefer to no other authorities), in commenting on this remarkable and\r\nfortunate failure in the power of transmission in the direct line, remarks\r\nthat it may possibly be owing to \"excess having reversed the action of some\r\nnatural law in development.\" But it is safer in the present state of our\r\nknowledge to look at the whole case as simply unintelligible.\r\n\r\nAlthough many congenital monstrosities are inherited, of which examples\r\nhave already been given, and to which may be added the lately recorded case\r\nof the transmission during a century of hare-lip with a cleft-palate in the\r\nwriter's own family (12/54. Mr. Sproule in 'British Medical Journal' April\r\n18, 1863.) yet other malformations are rarely or never inherited. Of these\r\nlatter cases, many are probably due to injuries in the womb or egg, and\r\nwould come under the head of non-inherited injuries or mutilations. With\r\nplants, a long catalogue of inherited monstrosities of the most serious and\r\ndiversified nature could easily be given; and with plants, there is no\r\nreason to suppose that monstrosities are caused by direct injuries to the\r\nseed or embryo.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or\r\naltered by disease, it was until lately difficult to come to any definite\r\nconclusion. Some mutilations have been practised for a vast number of\r\ngenerations without any inherited result. Godron remarks (12/55. 'De\r\nl'Espece' tome 2 1859 page 299.) that different races of man have from time\r\nimmemorial knocked out their upper incisors, cut off joints of their\r\nfingers, made holes of immense size through the lobes of their ears or\r\nthrough their nostrils, tatooed themselves, made deep gashes in various\r\nparts of their bodies, and there is no reason to suppose that these\r\nmutilations have ever been inherited. (12/56. Nevertheless Mr. Wetherell\r\nstates, 'Nature' December 1870 page 168, that when he visited fifteen years\r\nago the Sioux Indians, he was informed \"by a physician, who has passed much\r\nof his time with these tribes, that some times a child was born with these\r\nmarks. This was confirmed by the U.S. Government Indian Agent.\") Adhesions\r\ndue to inflammation and pits from the small-pox (and formerly many\r\nconsecutive generations must have been thus pitted) are not inherited. With\r\nrespect to Jews, I have been assured by three medical men of the Jewish\r\nfaith that circumcision, which has been practised for so many ages, has\r\nproduced no inherited effect. Blumenbach, however, asserts (12/57.\r\n'Philosoph. Mag.' volume 4 1799 page 5.) that Jews are often born in\r\nGermany in a condition rendering circumcision difficult, so that a name is\r\ngiven them signifying \"born circumcised;\" and Professor Preyer informs me\r\nthat this is the case in Bonn, such children being considered the special\r\nfavourites of Jehovah. I have also heard from Dr. A. Newman, of Guy's\r\nHospital, of the grandson of a circumcised Jew, the father not having been\r\ncircumcised, in a similar condition. But it is possible that all these\r\ncases may be accidental coincidence, for Sir J. Paget has seen five sons of\r\na lady and one son of her sister with adherent prepuces; and one of these\r\nboys was affected in a manner \"which might be considered like that commonly\r\nproduced by circumcision;\" yet there was no suspicion of Jewish blood in\r\nthe family of these two sisters. Circumcision is practised by Mahomedans,\r\nbut at a much later age than by Jews; and Dr. Riedel, Assistant Resident in\r\nNorth Celebes, writes to me that the boys there go naked until from six to\r\nten years old; and he has observed that many of them, though not all, have\r\ntheir prepuces much reduced in length, and this he attributes to the\r\ninherited effects of the operation. In the vegetable kingdom oaks and other\r\ntrees have borne galls from primeval times, yet they do not produce\r\ninherited excrescences; and many other such facts could be adduced.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above several negative cases, we now possess conclusive\r\nevidence that the effects of operations are sometimes inherited. Dr. Brown-\r\nSequard (12/58. 'Proc. Royal Soc.' volume 10 page 297. 'Communication to\r\nthe Brit. Assoc.' 1870. 'The Lancet' January 1875 page 7. The extracts are\r\nfrom this last paper. It appears that Obersteiner 'Stricker's Med.\r\nJahrbucher' 1875 No. 2 has confirmed Brown-Sequard's observations.) gives\r\nthe following summary of his observations on guinea-pigs; and this summary\r\nis so important that I will quote the whole:--\r\n\r\n[\"1st. Appearance of epilepsy in animals born of parents having been\r\nrendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. Appearance of epilepsy also in animals born of parents having been\r\nrendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. A change in the shape of the ear in animals born of parents in which\r\nsuch a change was the effect of a division of the cervical sympathetic\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\n\"4th. Partial closure of the eyelids in animals born of parents in which\r\nthat state of the eyelids had been caused either by the section of the\r\ncervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the superior cervical\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\n\"5th. Exophthalmia in animals born of parents in which an injury to the\r\nrestiform body had produced that protrusion of the eyeball. This\r\ninteresting fact I have witnessed a good many times, and I have seen the\r\ntransmission of the morbid state of the eye continue through four\r\ngenerations. In these animals, modified by heredity, the two eyes generally\r\nprotruded, although in the parents usually only one showed exophthalmia,\r\nthe lesion having been made in most cases only on one of the corpora\r\nrestiformia.\r\n\r\n\"6th. Haematoma and dry gangrene of the ears in animals born of parents in\r\nwhich these ear-alterations had been caused by an injury to the restiform\r\nbody near the nib of the calamus.\r\n\r\n\"7th. Absence of two toes out of the three of the hind leg, and sometimes\r\nof the three, in animals whose parents had eaten up their hind-leg toes\r\nwhich had become anaesthetic from a section of the sciatic nerve alone, or\r\nof that nerve and also of the crural. Sometimes, instead of complete\r\nabsence of the toes, only a part of one or two or three was missing in the\r\nyoung, although in the parent not only the toes but the whole foot was\r\nabsent (partly eaten off, partly destroyed by inflammation, ulceration, or\r\ngangrene).\r\n\r\n\"8th. Appearance of various morbid states of the skin and hair of the neck\r\nand face in animals born of parents having had similar alterations in the\r\nsame parts, as effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve.\"]\r\n\r\nIt should be especially observed that Brown-Sequard has bred during thirty\r\nyears many thousand guinea-pigs from animals which had not been operated\r\nupon, and not one of these manifested the epileptic tendency. Nor has he\r\never seen a guinea-pig born without toes, which was not the offspring of\r\nparents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to the sciatic nerve\r\nhaving been divided. Of this latter fact thirteen instances were carefully\r\nrecorded, and a greater number were seen; yet Brown-Sequard speaks of such\r\ncases as one of the rarer forms of inheritance. It is a still more\r\ninteresting fact--\r\n\r\n[\"That the sciatic nerve in the congenitally toeless animal has inherited\r\nthe power of passing through all the different morbid states which have\r\noccurred in one of its parents from the time of the division till after its\r\nreunion with the peripheric end. It is not therefore simply the power of\r\nperforming an action which is inherited, but the power of performing a\r\nwhole series of actions, in a certain order.\"]\r\n\r\nIn most of the cases of inheritance recorded by Brown-Sequard only one of\r\nthe two parents had been operated upon and was affected. He concludes by\r\nexpressing his belief that \"what is transmitted is the morbid state of the\r\nnervous system,\" due to the operation performed on the parents.\r\n\r\nWith the lower animals Dr. Prosper Lucas has collected a long list of\r\ninherited injuries. A few instances will suffice. A cow lost a horn from an\r\naccident with consequent suppuration, and she produced three calves which\r\nwere hornless on the same side of the head. With the horse, there seems\r\nhardly a doubt that exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on\r\nhard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a man who had his\r\nlittle finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence\r\ngrew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly\r\ncrooked. A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye\r\nfrom purulent ophthalmia, and his two sons were microphthalmic on the same\r\nside. (12/59. This last case is quoted by Mr. Sedgwick in 'British and\r\nForeign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April, 1861 page 484. For Blumenbach see\r\nabove-cited paper. See also Dr. P. Lucas 'Traite de l'Hered. Nat.' tome 2\r\npage 492. Also 'Transact. Linn. Soc.' volume 9 page 323. Some curious cases\r\nare given by Mr. Baker in the 'Veterinary' volume 13 page 723. Another\r\ncurious case is given in the 'Annales des Scienc. Nat.' 1st series, tome 11\r\npage 324.) In all cases in which a parent has had an organ injured on one\r\nside, and two or more of the offspring are born with the same organ\r\naffected on the same side, the chances against mere coincidence are almost\r\ninfinitely great. Even when only a single child is born having exactly the\r\nsame part of the body affected as that of his injured parent, the chances\r\nagainst coincidence are great; and Professor Rolleston has given me two\r\nsuch cases which have fallen under his own observation,--namely of two men,\r\none of whom had his knee and the other his cheek severely cut, and both had\r\nchildren born with exactly the same spot marked or scarred. Many instances\r\nhave been recorded of cats, dogs, and horses, which have had their tails,\r\nlegs, etc., amputated or injured, producing offspring with the same parts\r\nill-formed; but as it is not very rare for similar malformations to appear\r\nspontaneously, all such cases may be due to coincidence. It is, however, an\r\nargument on the other side that \"under the old excise laws the shepherd-dog\r\nwas only exempt from tax when without a tail, and for this reason it was\r\nalways removed\" (12/60. 'The Dog' by Stonehenge 1867 page 118.); and there\r\nstill exist breeds of the shepherd-dog which are always born destitute of a\r\ntail. Finally, it must be admitted, more especially since the publication\r\nof Brown-Sequard's observations, that the effects of injuries, especially\r\nwhen followed by disease, or perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are\r\noccasionally inherited. (12/61. The Mot-mot habitually bites the barbs off\r\nthe middle part of the two central tail-feathers, and as the barbs are\r\ncongenitally somewhat reduced on the same part of these feathers, it seems\r\nextremely probable, as Mr. Salvin remarks, 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1873 page\r\n429, that this is due to the inherited effects of long-continued\r\nmutilation.)\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF NON-INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nA large number of cases of non-inheritance are intelligible on the\r\nprinciple, that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist, but that it is\r\noverborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life. No one would\r\nexpect that our improved pigs, if forced during several generations to\r\ntravel about and root in the ground for their own subsistence, would\r\ntransmit, as truly as they now do their short muzzles and legs, and their\r\ntendency to fatten. Dray-horses assuredly would not long transmit their\r\ngreat size and massive limbs, if compelled to live on a cold, damp\r\nmountainous region; we have indeed evidence of such deterioration in the\r\nhorses which have run wild on the Falkland Islands. European dogs in India\r\noften fail to transmit their true character. Our sheep in tropical\r\ncountries lose their wool in a few generations. There seems also to be a\r\nclose relation between certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an\r\nenlarged tail in fat-tailed sheep, which form one of the most ancient\r\nbreeds in the world. With plants, we have seen that tropical varieties of\r\nmaize lose their proper character in the course of two or three\r\ngenerations, when cultivated in Europe; and conversely so it is with\r\nEuropean varieties cultivated in Brazil. Our cabbages, which here come so\r\ntrue by seed, cannot form heads in hot countries. According to Carriere\r\n(12/62. 'Production et Fixation des Varietes' 1865 page 72.) the purple-\r\nleafed beech and barberry transmit their character by seed far less truly\r\nin certain districts than in others. Under changed circumstances,\r\nperiodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted, as the period of\r\nmaturity in summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches. So it is with\r\nanimals: for instance, a person, whose statement I can trust, procured eggs\r\nof Aylesbury ducks from that town, where they are kept in houses and are\r\nreared as early as possible for the London market; the ducks bred from\r\nthese eggs in a distant part of England, hatched their first brood on\r\nJanuary 24th, whilst common ducks, kept in the same yard and treated in the\r\nsame manner, did not hatch till the end of March; and this shows that the\r\nperiod of hatching was inherited. But the grandchildren of these Aylesbury\r\nducks completely lost their habit of early incubation, and hatched their\r\neggs at the same time with the common ducks of the same place.\r\n\r\nMany cases of non-inheritance apparently result from the conditions of life\r\ncontinually inducing fresh variability. We have seen that when the seeds of\r\npears, plums, apples, etc., are sown, the seedlings generally inherit some\r\ndegree of family likeness. Mingled with these seedlings, a few, and\r\nsometimes many, worthless, wild-looking plants commonly appear, and their\r\nappearance may be attributed to the principle of reversion. But scarcely a\r\nsingle seedling will be found perfectly to resemble the parent-form; and\r\nthus may be accounted for by constantly recurring variability induced by\r\nthe conditions of life. I believe in this, because it has been observed\r\nthat certain fruit-trees truly propagate their kind whilst growing on their\r\nown roots; but when grafted on other stocks, and by this process their\r\nnatural state is manifestly affected, they produce seedlings which vary\r\ngreatly, departing from the parental type in many characters. (12/63.\r\nDowning 'Fruits of America' page 5: Sageret 'Pom. Phys.' pages 43, 72.)\r\nMetzger, as stated in the ninth chapter, found that certain kinds of wheat\r\nbrought from Spain and cultivated in Germany, failed during many years to\r\nreproduce themselves truly; but at last, when accustomed to their new\r\nconditions, they ceased to be variable,--that is, they became amenable to\r\nthe power of inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot be propagated\r\nwith any approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which have been long\r\npropagated by buds, cuttings, offsets, tubers, etc., and have in\r\nconsequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their\r\nindividual lives to widely diversified conditions of life. Plants thus\r\npropagated become so variable, that they are subject, as we have seen in\r\nthe last chapter, even to bud-variation. Our domesticated animals, on the\r\nother hand, are not commonly exposed during the life of the individual to\r\nsuch extremely diversified conditions, and are not liable to such extreme\r\nvariability; therefore they do not lose the power of transmitting most of\r\ntheir characteristic features. In the foregoing remarks on non-inheritance,\r\ncrossed breeds are of course excluded, as their diversity mainly depends on\r\nthe unequal development of character derived from either parent or their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the early part of this chapter how commonly new\r\ncharacters of the most diversified nature, whether normal or abnormal,\r\ninjurious or beneficial, whether affecting organs of the highest or most\r\ntrifling importance, are inherited. It is often sufficient for the\r\ninheritance of some peculiar character, that one parent alone should\r\npossess it, as in most cases in which the rarer anomalies have been\r\ntransmitted. But the power of transmission is extremely variable. In a\r\nnumber of individuals descended from the same parents, and treated in the\r\nsame manner, some display this power in a perfect manner, and in some it is\r\nquite deficient; and for this difference no reason can be assigned. The\r\neffects of injuries or mutilations are occasionally inherited; and we shall\r\nsee in a future chapter that the long-continued use and disuse of parts\r\nproduces an inherited effect. Even those characters which are considered\r\nthe most fluctuating, such as colour, are with rare exceptions transmitted\r\nmuch more forcibly than is generally supposed. The wonder, indeed, in all\r\ncases is not that any character should be transmitted, but that the power\r\nof inheritance should ever fail. The checks to inheritance, as far as we\r\nknow them, are, firstly, circumstances hostile to the particular character\r\nin question; secondly, conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh\r\nvariability; and lastly, the crossing of distinct varieties during some\r\nprevious generation, together with reversion or atavism-that is, the\r\ntendency in the child to resemble its grand-parents or more remote\r\nancestors instead of its immediate parents. This latter subject will be\r\ndiscussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.",
