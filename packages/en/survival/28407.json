In a few instances I have not kept exactly to the\r\ntext of the Globe Edition, but these are noted; and I have added the\r\n\"Two Noble Kinsmen,\" which is not in that Edition.\r\n\r\nIn other respects this Second Edition is substantially the same as the\r\nFirst.\r\n\r\n                                                         H.

But I decided to retain them, on\r\nfinding that they interested some readers, by whom the literary and\r\nShakespearean notices were less valued.\r\n\r\nThe weekly preparation of the Papers was a very pleasant study to\r\nmyself, and introduced me to much literary and horticultural information\r\nof which I was previously ignorant. In republishing them I hope that\r\nsome of my readers may meet with equal pleasure, and with some little\r\ninformation that may be new to them.\r\n\r\n                                                         H. N. E.\r\n\r\n     BITTON VICARAGE, GLOUCESTERSHIRE,\r\n     _May, 1878_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the commentators on Shakespeare are agreed upon one point, that he\r\nwas the most wonderfully many-sided writer that the world has yet seen.\r\nEvery art and science are more or less noticed by him, so far as they\r\nwere known in his day; every business and profession are more or less\r\naccurately described; and so it has come to pass that, though the main\r\ncircumstances of his life are pretty well known, yet the students of\r\nevery art and science, and the members of every business and profession,\r\nhave delighted to claim him as their fellow-labourer. Books have been\r\nwritten at various times by various writers, which have proved (to the\r\ncomplete satisfaction of the writers) that he was a soldier,[1:1] a\r\nsailor, a lawyer,[1:2] an astronomer, a physician,[1:3] a divine,[1:4] a\r\nprinter,[1:5] an actor, a courtier, a sportsman, an angler,[2:1] and I\r\nknow not what else besides.\r\n\r\nI also propose to claim him as a fellow-labourer. A lover of flowers and\r\ngardening myself, I claim Shakespeare as equally a lover of flowers and\r\ngardening; and this I propose to prove by showing how, in all his\r\nwritings, he exhibits his strong love for flowers, and a very fair,\r\nthough not perhaps a very deep, knowledge of plants; but I do not intend\r\nto go further. That he was a lover of plants I shall have no difficulty\r\nin showing; but I do not, therefore, believe that he was a professed\r\ngardener, and I am quite sure he can in no sense be claimed as a\r\nbotanist, in the scientific sense of the term. His knowledge of plants\r\nwas simply the knowledge that every man may have who goes through the\r\nworld with his eyes open to the many beauties of Nature that surround\r\nhim, and who does not content himself with simply looking, and then\r\npassing on, but tries to find out something of the inner meaning of the\r\nbeauties he sees, and to carry away with him some of the lessons which\r\nthey were doubtless meant to teach. But Shakespeare was able to go\r\nfurther than this. He had the great gift of being able to describe what\r\nhe saw in a way that few others have arrived at; he could communicate to\r\nothers the pleasure that he felt himself, not by long descriptions, but\r\nby a few simple words, a few natural touches, and a few well-chosen\r\nepithets, which bring the plants and flowers before us in the freshest,\r\nand often in a most touching way.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the study of the Plant-lore of Shakespeare is a very\r\npleasant study, and there are other things which add to this pleasure.\r\nOne especial pleasure arises from the thoroughly English character of\r\nhis descriptions. It has often been observed that wherever the scenes of\r\nhis plays are laid, and whatever foreign characters he introduces, yet\r\nthey really are all Englishmen of the time of Elizabeth, and the scenes\r\nare all drawn from the England of his day. This is certainly true of the\r\nplants and flowers we meet with in the plays; they are thoroughly\r\nEnglish plants that (with very few exceptions) he saw in the hedgerows\r\nand woods of Warwickshire,[2:2] or in his own or his friends' gardens.\r\nThe descriptions are thus thoroughly fresh and real; they tell of the\r\ncountry and of the outdoor life he loved, and they never smell of the\r\nstudy lamp. In this respect he differs largely from Milton, whose\r\ndescriptions (with very few exceptions) recall the classic and Italian\r\nwriters. He differs, too, from his contemporary Spenser, who has\r\ncertainly some very sweet descriptions of flowers, which show that he\r\nknew and loved them, but are chiefly allusions to classical flowers,\r\nwhich he names in such a way as to show that he often did not fully know\r\nwhat they were, but named them because it was the right thing for a\r\nclassical poet so to do. Shakespeare never names a flower or plant\r\nunnecessarily; they all come before us, when they do come, in the most\r\nnatural way, as if the particular flower named was the only one that\r\ncould be named on that occasion. We have nothing in his writings, for\r\ninstance, like the long list of trees described (and in the most\r\ninteresting way) in the first canto of the First Book of the \"Faerie\r\nQueene,\" and indeed he is curiously distinct from all his\r\ncontemporaries. Chaucer, before him, spoke much of flowers and plants,\r\nand drew them as from the life. In the century after him Herrick may be\r\nnamed as another who sung of flowers as he saw them; but the real\r\ncontemporaries of Shakespeare are, with few exceptions,[3:1] very silent\r\non the subject. One instance will suffice. Sir Thomas Wyatt's poems are\r\nall professedly about the country--they abound in woods and vales,\r\nshepherds and swains--yet in all his poems there is scarcely a single\r\nallusion to a flower in a really natural way. And because Shakespeare\r\nonly introduces flowers in their right place, and in the most purely\r\nnatural way, there is one necessary result. I shall show that the number\r\nof flowers he introduces is large, but the number he omits, and which he\r\nmust have known, is also very large, and well worth noting.[4:1] He has\r\nno notice, under any name, of such common flowers as the Snowdrop, the\r\nForget-me-Not, the Foxglove, the Lily of the Valley,[4:2] and many\r\nothers which he must have known, but which he has not named; because\r\nwhen he names a plant or flower, he does so not to show his own\r\nknowledge, but because the particular flower or plant is wanted in the\r\nparticular place in which he uses it.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest in the Plant-lore of Shakespeare is the wide\r\nrange of his observation. He gathers flowers for us from all sorts of\r\nplaces--from the \"turfy mountains\" and the \"flat meads;\" from the \"bosky\r\nacres\" and the \"unshrubbed down;\" from \"rose-banks\" and \"hedges\r\neven-pleached.\" But he is equally at home in the gardens of the country\r\ngentlemen with their \"pleached bowers\" and \"leafy orchards.\" Nor is he a\r\nstranger to gardens of a much higher pretension, for he will pick us\r\nfamous Strawberries from the garden of my Lord of Ely in Holborn; he\r\nwill pick us White and Red Roses from the garden of the Temple; and he\r\nwill pick us \"Apricocks\" from the royal garden of Richard the Second's\r\nsad queen. I propose to follow Shakespeare into these many pleasant\r\nspots, and to pick each flower and note each plant which he has thought\r\nworthy of notice. I do not propose to make a selection of his plants,\r\nfor that would not give a proper idea of the extent of his knowledge,\r\nbut to note every tree, and plant, and flower that he has noted. And as\r\nI pick each flower, I shall let Shakespeare first tell us all he has to\r\nsay about it; in other words, I shall quote every passage in which he\r\nnames the plant or flower; for here, again, it would not do to make a\r\nselection from the passages, my object not being to give \"floral\r\nextracts,\" but to let him say all he can in his own choice words. There\r\nis not much difficulty in this, but there is difficulty in determining\r\nhow much or how little to quote. On the one hand, it often seems cruel\r\nto cut short a noble passage in the midst of which some favourite flower\r\nis placed; but, on the other hand, to quote at too great a length would\r\nextend the book beyond reasonable limits. The rule, therefore, must be\r\nto confine the quotations within as small a space as possible, only\r\ntaking care that the space is not so small as entirely to spoil the\r\nbeauty of the description. Then, having listened to all that Shakespeare\r\nhas to say on each flower, I shall follow with illustrations (few and\r\nshort) from contemporary writers; then with any observations that may\r\npresent themselves in the identification of Shakespeare's plant with\r\ntheir modern representatives, finishing each with anything in the\r\nhistory or modern uses or cultivation of the plant that I think will\r\ninterest readers.\r\n\r\nFor the identification of the plants, we have an excellent and\r\ntrustworthy guide in John Gerard, who was almost an exact contemporary\r\nof Shakespeare. Gerard's life ranged from 1545 to 1612, and\r\nShakespeare's from 1564 to 1616. Whether they were acquainted or not we\r\ndo not know, but it is certainly not improbable that they were; I should\r\nthink it almost certain that they must have known each other's published\r\nworks.[5:1]\r\n\r\nMy subject naturally divides itself into two parts--\r\n\r\n     First, The actual plants and flowers named by Shakespeare;\r\n     Second, His knowledge of gardens and gardening.\r\n\r\nI now go at once to the first division, naming each plant in its\r\nalphabetical order.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1:1] \"Was Shakespeare ever a Soldier?\" by W.

N. Ellacombe, 1883, 12mo.\r\n\r\n[2:2] \"The country around Stratford presents the perfection of quiet\r\nEnglish scenery; it is remarkable for its wealth of lovely wild flowers,\r\nfor its deep meadows on each side of the tranquil Avon, and for its\r\nrich, sweet woodlands.\"--E. DOWDEN'S _Shakespeare in Literature\r\nPrimers_, 1877.\r\n\r\n[3:1] The two chief exceptions are Ben Jonson (1574-1637) and William\r\nBrowne (1590-1645). Jonson, though born in London, and living there the\r\ngreatest part of his life, was evidently a real lover of flowers, and\r\nfrequently shows a practical knowledge of them. Browne was also a keen\r\nobserver of nature, and I have made several quotations from his\r\n\"Britannia's Pastorals.\"\r\n\r\n[4:1] Perhaps the most noteworthy plant omitted is Tobacco--Shakespeare\r\nmust have been well acquainted with it, not only as every one in his day\r\nknew of it, but as a friend and companion of Ben Jonson, he must often\r\nhave been in the company of smokers. Ben Jonson has frequent allusions\r\nto it, and almost all the sixteenth-century writers have something to\r\nsay about it; but Shakespeare never names the herb, or alludes to it in\r\nany way whatever.\r\n\r\n[4:2] It seems probable that the Lily of the Valley was not recognized\r\nas a British plant in Shakespeare's time, and was very little grown even\r\nin gardens. Turner says, \"Ephemerū is called in duch meyblumle, in\r\nfrench Muguet. It groweth plentuously in Germany, but not in England\r\nthat ever I coulde see, savinge in my Lordes gardine at Syon. The\r\nPoticaries in Germany do name it Lilium Cōvallium, it may be called\r\nin englishe May Lilies.\"--_Names of Herbes_, 1548. Coghan in 1596 says\r\nmuch the same: \"I say nothing of them because they are not usuall in\r\ngardens.\"--_Haven of Health._\r\n\r\n[5:1] I may mention the following works as more or less illustrating the\r\nPlant-lore of Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n     1.--\"Shakspere's Garden,\" by Sidney Beisly, 1864. I have to\r\n     thank this author for information on a few points, but on the\r\n     whole it is not a satisfactory account of the plants of\r\n     Shakespeare, and I have not found it of much use.\r\n\r\n     2.--\"Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon,\" and\r\n\r\n     3.--\"Girard's Flowers of Shakespeare and of Milton,\" 2 vols.\r\n     These two works are pretty drawing-room books, and do not\r\n     profess to be more.\r\n\r\n     4.--\"Natural History of Shakespeare, being Selections of\r\n     Flowers, Fruits, and Animals,\" arranged by Bessie Mayou, 1877.\r\n     This gives the greater number of the passages in which flowers\r\n     are named, without any note or comment.\r\n\r\n     5.--\"Shakespeare's Bouquet--the Flowers and Plants of\r\n     Shakespeare,\" Paisley, 1872. This is only a small pamphlet.\r\n\r\n     6.--\"The Rural Life of Shakespeare, as illustrated by his\r\n     Works,\" by J. C. Roach Smith, 8vo, London, 1870. A pleasant\r\n     but short pamphlet.\r\n\r\n     7.--\"A Brief Guide to the Gardens of Shakespeare,\" 1863, 12mo,\r\n     12 pages, and\r\n\r\n     8.--\"Shakespeare's Home and Rural Life,\" by James Walter, with\r\n     Illustrations. 1874, folio. These two works are rather\r\n     topographical guides than accounts of the flowers of\r\n     Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n     9.--\"The Flowers of Shakespeare,\" depicted by Viola, coloured\r\n     plates, 4to, 1882. A drawing-room book of little merit.\r\n\r\n     10.--\"The Shakspere Flora,\" by Leo H. Grindon, 12mo, 1883. A\r\n     collection of very pleasant essays on the poetry of\r\n     Shakespeare, and his knowledge of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n_THE PLANT-LORE OF SHAKESPEARE._\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._ Here's flowers for you.\r\n\r\n                                  _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Duke._ Away before me to sweet beds of flowers.\r\n\r\n                                   _Twelfth Night_, act i, sc. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _K. Henry._\r\n\r\n     The united vessel of their blood,\r\n     Mingled with venom of suggestion--\r\n     As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--\r\n     Shall never leak, though it do work as strong\r\n     As Aconitum or rash gunpowder.\r\n\r\n                         _2nd King Henry IV_, act iv, sc. 4 (44).\r\n\r\nThere is another place in which it is probable that Shakespeare alludes\r\nto the Aconite; he does not name it, but he compares the effects of the\r\npoison to gunpowder, as in the passage above.\r\n\r\n     _Romeo._\r\n\r\n                                   Let me have\r\n     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\r\n     As will disperse itself through all the veins,\r\n     That the life-weary taker may fall dead\r\n     And that the trunk may be discharged of breath\r\n     As violently as hasty powder fired\r\n     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act v, sc. 1 (59).\r\n\r\nThe plant here named as being as powerful in its action as gunpowder is\r\nthe Aconitum Napellus (the Wolf's bane or Monk's-hood). It is a member\r\nof a large family, all of which are more or less poisonous, and the\r\ncommon Monk's-hood as much so as any. Two species are found in America,\r\nbut, for the most part, the family is confined to the northern portion\r\nof the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from the Himalaya through Europe to\r\nGreat Britain. It is now found wild in a few parts of England, but it is\r\ncertainly not indigenous; it was, however, very early introduced into\r\nEngland, being found in all the English vocabularies of plants from the\r\ntenth century downwards, and frequently mentioned in the early English\r\nmedical recipes.\r\n\r\nIts names are all interesting. In the Anglo-Saxon Vocabularies it is\r\ncalled _thung_, which, however, seems to have been a general name for\r\nany very poisonous plant;[10:1] it was then called Aconite, as the\r\nEnglish form of its Greek and Latin name, but this name is now seldom\r\nused, being, by a curious perversion, solely given to the pretty little\r\nearly-flowering Winter Aconite (_Eranthis hyemalis_), which is not a\r\ntrue Aconite, though closely allied; it then got the name of\r\nWolf's-bane, as the direct translation of the Greek _lycoctonum_, a name\r\nwhich it had from the idea that arrows tipped with the juice, or baits\r\nanointed with it, would kill wolves and other vermin; and, lastly, it\r\ngot the expressive names of Monk's-hood[10:2] and the Helmet-flower,\r\nfrom the curious shape of the upper sepal overtopping the rest of the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nAs to its poisonous qualities, all authors agree that every species of\r\nthe family is very poisonous, the A. ferox of the Himalaya being\r\nprobably the most so. Every part of the plant, from the root to the\r\npollen dust, seems to be equally powerful, and it has the special bad\r\nquality of being, to inexperienced eyes, so like some harmless plant,\r\nthat the poison has been often taken by mistake with deadly results.\r\nThis charge against the plant is of long standing, dating certainly from\r\nthe time of Virgil--_miseros fallunt aconita legentes_--and, no doubt,\r\nfrom much before his time. As it was a common belief that poisons were\r\nantidotes against other poisons, the Aconite was supposed to be an\r\nantidote against the most deadly one--\r\n\r\n                \"I have heard that Aconite\r\n     Being timely taken hath a healing might\r\n     Against the scorpion's stroke.\"\r\n\r\n                           BEN JONSON, _Sejanus_, act iii, sc. 3.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of its poisonous qualities, the plant has always held, and\r\ndeservedly, a place among the ornamental plants of our gardens; its\r\nstately habit and its handsome leaves and flowers make it a favourite.\r\nNearly all the species are worth growing, the best, perhaps, being A.\r\nNapellus, both white and blue, A. paniculatum, A. japonicum, and A.\r\nautumnale. All the species grow well in shade and under trees. In\r\nShakespeare's time Gerard grew in his London garden four species--A.\r\nlycoctonum, A. variegatum, A. Napellus, and A. Pyrenaicum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10:1] \"_Aconita_, thung.\" Ælfric's \"Vocabulary,\" 10th century.\r\n\r\n\"_Aconitum_, thung.\" Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary, 11th century.\r\n\r\n\"_Aconita_, thung.\" \"Durham Glossary of the names of Worts,\" 11th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Vocabularies and Glossaries, to which I shall frequently\r\nrefer, are printed in\r\n\r\nI.

The Almond tree is a native\r\nof Asia and North Africa, but it was very early introduced into England,\r\nprobably by the Romans. It occurs in the Anglo-Saxon lists of plants,\r\nand in the \"Durham Glossary\" (11th century) it has the name of the\r\n\"Easterne nutte-beam.\" The tree was always a favourite both for the\r\nbeauty of its flowers, which come very early in the year, and for its\r\nBiblical associations, so that in Shakespeare's time the trees were \"in\r\nour London gardens and orchards in great plenty\" (Gerard). Before\r\nShakespeare's time, Spenser had sung its praises thus--\r\n\r\n     \"Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye\r\n      On top of greene Selinis all alone\r\n      With blossoms brave bedecked daintily;\r\n      Whose tender locks do tremble every one\r\n      At everie little breath that under Heaven is blowne.\"\r\n\r\n                                               _F. Q._, i. 7, 32.\r\n\r\nThe older English name seems to have been Almande--\r\n\r\n     \"And Almandres gret plente,\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose_;\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Noyz de l'almande, nux Phyllidis,\"\r\n\r\n                                                ALEXANDER NECKAM;\r\n\r\nand both this old name and its more modern form of Almond came to us\r\nthrough the French _amande_ (Provençal, _amondala_), from the Greek and\r\nLatin _amygdalus_. What this word meant is not very clear, but the\r\nnative Hebrew name of the plant (_shaked_) is most expressive. The word\r\nsignifies \"awakening,\" and so is a most fitting name for a tree whose\r\nbeautiful flowers, appearing in Palestine in January, show the wakening\r\nup of Creation. The fruit also has always been a special favourite, and\r\nthough it is strongly imbued with prussic acid, it is considered a\r\nwholesome fruit. By the old writers many wonderful virtues were\r\nattributed to the fruit, but I am afraid it was chiefly valued for its\r\nsupposed virtue, that \"five or six being taken fasting do keepe a man\r\nfrom being drunke\" (Gerard).[12:1] This popular error is not yet\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental tree the Almond should be in every shrubbery, and, as\r\nin Gerard's time, it may still be planted in town gardens with\r\nadvantage. There are several varieties of the common Almond, differing\r\nslightly in the colour and size of the flowers; and there is one little\r\nshrub (Amygdalus nana) of the family that is very pretty in the front\r\nrow of a shrubbery. All the species are deciduous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12:1] \"Plutarch mentions a great drinker of wine who, by the use of\r\nbitter almonds, used to escape being intoxicated.\"--_Flora Domestica_,\r\np. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,\r\n     The Aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.\r\n\r\n                                   _A Lover's Complaint_, st. 39.\r\n\r\nAloes have the peculiarity that they are the emblems of the most intense\r\nbitterness and of the richest and most costly fragrance. In the Bible\r\nAloes are mentioned five times, and always with reference to their\r\nexcellence and costliness.[13:1] Juvenal speaks of it only as a bitter--\r\n\r\n            \"Animo corrupta superbo\r\n     Plus Aloes quam mellis habet\" (vi. 180).\r\n\r\nPliny describes it very minutely, and says, \"Strong it is to smell unto,\r\nand bitter to taste\" (xxvii. 4, Holland's translation). Our old English\r\nwriters spoke of it under both aspects. It occurs in several recipes of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon Leechdoms, as a strong and bitter purgative. Chaucer\r\nnotices its bitterness only--\r\n\r\n     \"The woful teres that they leten falle\r\n      As bittre weren, out of teres kynde,\r\n      For peyne, as is ligne Aloes or galle.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _Troilus and Cryseide_, st. 159.\r\n\r\nBut the author of the \"Remedie of Love,\" formerly attributed to Chaucer,\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n     \"My chambre is strowed with myrrhe and incense\r\n      With sote savouring Aloes and sinnamone,\r\n      Breathing an aromaticke redolence.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare only mentions the bitter quality.\r\n\r\nThe two qualities are derived from two very different plants. The\r\nfragrant ointment is the product of an Indian shrub, Aquilaria\r\nagallochum; and the bitter purgative is from the true Aloes, A.\r\nSocotrina, A. vulgaris, and others. These plants were well known in\r\nShakespeare's time, and were grown in England. Turner and Gerard\r\ndescribe them as the Sea Houseleek; and Gerard tells us that they were\r\ngrown as vegetable curiosities, for \"the herbe is alwaies greene, and\r\nlikewise sendeth forth branches, though it remaine out of the earth,\r\nespecially if the root be covered with lome, and now and then watered;\r\nfor so being hanged on the seelings and upper posts of dining-roomes, it\r\nwill not onely continue a long time greene, but it also groweth and\r\nbringeth forth new leaves.\"[14:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13:1] Numbers xxiv. 6; Psalms xlv. 8; Proverbs vii. 17; Canticles iv.\r\n14; John xix. 39.\r\n\r\n[14:1] In the emblems of Camerarius (No. 92) is a picture of a room with\r\nan Aloe suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANEMONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd\r\n     Was melted like a vapour from her sight,\r\n     And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,\r\n     A purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white.\r\n     Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood\r\n     Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.\r\n\r\n                                       _Venus and Adonis_ (1165).\r\n\r\nShakespeare does not actually name the Anemone, and I place this passage\r\nunder that name with some doubt, but I do not know any other flower to\r\nwhich he could be referring.\r\n\r\nThe original legend of the Anemone as given by Bion was that it sprung\r\nfrom the tears of Venus, while the Rose sprung from Adonis' blood--\r\n\r\n     ἆιμα ροδον τίκτει. τά δέ δάκρυα τάν ἀνεμώναν.\r\n\r\n                                             _Bion Idyll_, i, 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Wide as her lover's torrent blood appears\r\n      So copious flowed the fountain of her tears;\r\n      The Rose starts blushing from the sanguine dyes,\r\n      And from her tears Anemones arise.\"\r\n\r\n                                  POLWHELE'S _Translation_, 1786.\r\n\r\nBut this legend was not followed by the other classical writers, who\r\nmade the Anemone to be the flower of Adonis. Theocritus compares the\r\nDog-rose (so called also in his day, κυνοσβατος) and the Anemone with\r\nthe Rose, and the Scholia comment on the passage thus--\"Anemone, a\r\nscentless flower, which they report to have sprung from the blood of\r\nAdonis; and again Nicander says that the Anemone sprung from the blood\r\nof Adonis.\"\r\n\r\nThe storehouse of our ancestors' pagan mythology was in Ovid, and his\r\nwell-known lines are--\r\n\r\n             \"Cum flos e sanguine concolor ortus\r\n     Qualem, quæ; lento celant sub cortice granum\r\n     Punica ferre solent; brevis est tamen usus in illis,\r\n     Namque male hærentem, et nimiâ brevitate caducum\r\n     Excutiunt idem qui præstant nomina, venti,\"--\r\n\r\nThus translated by Golding in 1567, from whom it is very probable that\r\nShakespeare obtained his information--\r\n\r\n     \"Of all one colour with the bloud, a flower she there did find,\r\n      Even like the flower of that same tree, whose fruit in tender rind\r\n      Have pleasant graines enclosede--howbeit the use of them is short,\r\n      For why, the leaves do hang so loose through lightnesse in such\r\n          sort,\r\n      As that the windes that all things pierce[15:1] with everie little\r\n          blast\r\n      Do shake them off and shed them so as long they cannot last.\"[15:2]\r\n\r\nI feel sure that Shakespeare had some particular flower in view. Spenser\r\nonly speaks of it as a flower, and gives no description--\r\n\r\n     \"In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed\r\n      The love of Venus and her Paramoure,\r\n      The fayre Adonis, turned to a flowre.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _F. Q._, iii, 1, 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When she saw no help might him restore\r\n      Him to a dainty flowre she did transmew.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _F. Q._, iii, 1, 38.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson similarly speaks of it as \"Adonis' flower\" (Pan's\r\nAnniversary), but with Shakespeare it is different; he describes the\r\nflower minutely, and as if it were a well-known flower, \"purple\r\nchequered with white,\" and considering that in his day Anemone was\r\nsupposed to be Adonis' flower (as it was described in 1647 by Alexander\r\nRoss in his \"Mystagogus Poeticus,\" who says that Adonis \"was by Venus\r\nturned into a red flower called Anemone\"), and as I wish, if possible,\r\nto link the description to some special flower, I conclude that the\r\nevidence is in favour of the Anemone. Gerard's Anemone was certainly the\r\nsame as ours, and the \"purple\" colour is no objection, for \"purple\" in\r\nShakespeare's time had a very wide signification, meaning almost any\r\nbright colour, just as _purpureus_ had in Latin,[16:1] which had so wide\r\na range that it was used on the one hand as the epithet of the blood and\r\nthe poppy, and on the other as the epithet of the swan (\"purpureis ales\r\noloribus,\" Horace) and of a woman's white arms (\"brachia purpurea\r\ncandidiora nive,\" Albinovanus). Nor was \"chequered\" confined to square\r\ndivisions, as it usually is now, but included spots of any size or\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nWe have transferred the Greek name of Anemone to the English language,\r\nand we have further kept the Greek idea in the English form of\r\n\"wind-flower.\" The name is explained by Pliny: \"The flower hath the\r\npropertie to open but when the wind doth blow, wherefore it took the\r\nname Anemone in Greeke\" (\"Nat. Hist.\" xxi. 11, Holland's translation).\r\nThis, however, is not the character of the Anemone as grown in English\r\ngardens; and so it is probable that the name has been transferred to a\r\ndifferent plant than the classical one, and I think no suggestion more\r\nprobable than Dr. Prior's that the classical Anemone was the Cistus, a\r\nshrub that is very abundant in the South of Europe; that certainly opens\r\nits flowers at other times than when the wind blows, and so will not\r\nwell answer to Pliny's description, but of which the flowers are\r\nbright-coloured and most fugacious, and so will answer to Ovid's\r\ndescription. This fugacious character of the Anemone is perpetuated in\r\nSir William Jones' lines (\"Poet. Works,\" i, 254, ed. 1810)--\r\n\r\n     \"Youth, like a thin Anemone, displays\r\n     His silken leaf, and in a morn decays;\"\r\n\r\nbut the lines, though classical, are not true of the Anemone, though\r\nthey would well apply to the Cistus.[17:1]\r\n\r\nOur English Anemones belong to a large family inhabiting cold and\r\ntemperate regions, and numbering seventy species, of which three are\r\nBritish.[17:2] These are A. Nemorosa, the common wood Anemone, the\r\nbrightest spring ornament of our woods; A. Apennina, abundant in the\r\nSouth of Europe, and a doubtful British plant; and A. pulsatilla, the\r\nPasse, or Pasque flower, _i.e._, the flower of Easter, one of the most\r\nbeautiful of our British flowers, but only to be found on the chalk\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15:1] Golding evidently adopted the reading \"qui perflant omnia,\"\r\ninstead of the reading now generally received, \"qui præstant nomina.\"\r\n\r\n[15:2] Gerard thought that Ovid's Anemone was the Venice\r\nMallow--_Hibiscus trionum_--a handsome annual from the South of Europe.\r\n\r\n[16:1] In the \"Nineteenth Century\" for October, 1877, is an interesting\r\narticle by Mr. Gladstone on the \"colour-sense\" in Homer, proving that\r\nHomer, and all nations in the earlier stages of their existence, have a\r\nvery limited perception of colour, and a very limited and loosely\r\napplied nomenclature of colours. The same remark would certainly apply\r\nto the early English writers, not excluding Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n[17:1] Mr. Leo Grindon also identifies the classical Anemone with the\r\nCistus.

Of the Apple generally I need say nothing, except to\r\nnotice that the name was not originally confined to the fruit now so\r\ncalled, but was a generic name applied to any fruit, as we still speak\r\nof the Love-apple, the Pine-apple,[20:1] &c. The Anglo-Saxon name for\r\nthe Blackberry was the Bramble-apple; and Sir John Mandeville, in\r\ndescribing the Cedars of Lebanon, says: \"And upon the hills growen Trees\r\nof Cedre, that ben fulle hye, and they beren longe Apples, and als grete\r\nas a man's heved\"[20:2] (cap. ix.). In the English Bible it is the same.\r\nThe Apple is mentioned in a few places, but it is almost certain that it\r\nnever means the Pyrus malus, but is either the Orange, Citron, or\r\nQuince, or is a general name for a tree fruit. So that when Shakespeare\r\n(24) and the other old writers speak of Eve's Apple, they do not\r\nnecessarily assert that the fruit of the temptation was our Apple, but\r\nsimply that it was some fruit that grew in Eden. The Apple (_pomum_) has\r\nleft its mark in the language in the word \"pomatum,\" which, originally\r\nan ointment made of Apples, is now an ointment in which Apples have no\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe Crab was held in far more esteem in the sixteenth century than it is\r\nwith us. The roasted fruit served with hot ale (9 and 10) was a\r\nfavourite Christmas dish, and even without ale the roasted Crab was a\r\nfavourite, and this not for want of better fruit, for Gerard tells us\r\nthat in his time \"the stocke or kindred of Apples was infinite,\" but\r\nbecause they were considered pleasant food.[20:3] Another curious use of\r\nCrabs is told in the description of Crab-wake, or \"Crabbing the Parson,\"\r\nat Halesowen, Salop, on St. Kenelm's Day (July 17), in Brand's \"Popular\r\nAntiquities\" (vol. i. p. 342, Bohn's edition). Nor may we now despise\r\nthe Crab tree, though we do not eat its fruit. Among our native trees\r\nthere is none more beautiful than the Crab tree, both in flower and in\r\nfruit. An old Crab tree in full flower is a sight that will delight any\r\nartist, nor is it altogether useless; its wood is very hard and very\r\nlasting, and from its fruit verjuice is made, not, however, much in\r\nEngland, as I believe nearly all the verjuice now used is made in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe Pippin, from being originally a general name for any Apple raised\r\nfrom pips and not from grafts, is now, and probably was in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, confined to the bright-coloured, long-keeping Apples (Justice\r\nShallow's was \"last year's Pippin\"), of which the Golden Pippin (\"the\r\nPippin burnished o'er with gold,\" Phillips) is the type.\r\n\r\nThe Bitter-Sweeting (22) was an old and apparently a favourite Apple. It\r\nis frequently mentioned in the old writers, as by Gower, \"Conf. Aman.\"\r\nviii. 174--\r\n\r\n     \"For all such time of love is lore,\r\n      And like unto the Bitter-swete,[21:1]\r\n      For though it think a man fyrst swete\r\n      He shall well felen at laste\r\n          That it is sower.\"\r\n\r\nBy Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"Yet of that art they conne nought wexe sadde,\r\n      For unto hem it is a Bitter Swete.\"\r\n\r\n                              _Prologue of the Chanoune's Yeman._\r\n\r\nAnd by Ben Jonson--\r\n\r\n     \"That love's a Bitter-sweet I ne'er conceive\r\n      Till the sour minute comes of taking leave,\r\n      And then I taste it.\"[21:2]\r\n\r\n                                                    _Underwoods._\r\n\r\nParkinson names it in his list of Apples, but soon dismisses it--\"Twenty\r\nsorts of Sweetings, and none good.\" The name is now given to an Apple of\r\nno great value as a table fruit, but good as a cider apple, and for use\r\nin silk dyeing.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to identify the Pomewater (21). It was highly esteemed\r\nboth by Shakespeare (\"it hangeth like a jewel in the ear of _cœlo_\")\r\nand many other writers. In Gerard's figure it looks like a Codling, and\r\nits Latin name is _Malus carbonaria_, which probably refers to its good\r\nqualities as a roasting Apple. The name Pomewater (or Water Apple) makes\r\nus expect a juicy but not a rich Apple, and with this agrees Parkinson's\r\ndescription: \"The Pomewater is an excellent, good, and great whitish\r\nApple, full of sap or moisture, somewhat pleasant sharp, but a little\r\nbitter withall; it will not last long, the winter frosts soon causing it\r\nto rot and perish.\" It must have been very like the modern Lord Suffield\r\nApple, and though Parkinson says it will not last long, yet it is\r\nmentioned as lasting till the New Year in a tract entitled \"Vox\r\nGraculi,\" 1623. Speaking of New Year's Day, the author says: \"This day\r\nshall be given many more gifts than shall be asked for; and apples,\r\negges, and oranges shall be lifted to a lofty rate; when a Pomewater\r\nbestuck with a few rotten cloves shall be worth more than the honesty of\r\na hypocrite\" (quoted by Brand, vol. i. 17, Bohn's edition).\r\n\r\nWe have no such difficulty with the \"dish of Apple-johns\" (17 and 18).\r\nHakluyt recommends \"the Apple John that dureth two years to make show of\r\nour fruit\" to be carried by voyagers.[22:1] \"The Deusan (_deux ans_) or\r\nApple-john,\" says Parkinson, \"is a delicate fine fruit, well rellished\r\nwhen it beginneth to be fit to be eaten, and endureth good longer than\r\nany other Apple.\" With this description there is no difficulty in\r\nidentifying the Apple-john with an Apple that goes under many names, and\r\nis figured by Maund as the Easter Pippin. When first picked it is of a\r\ndeep green colour, and very hard. In this state it remains all the\r\nwinter, and in April or May it becomes yellow and highly perfumed, and\r\nremains good either for cooking or dessert for many months.\r\n\r\nThe Codling (2) is not the Apple now so called, but is the general name\r\nof a young unripe Apple.\r\n\r\nThe \"Leathercoats\" (19) are the Brown Russets; and though the \"dish of\r\nCaraways\" in the same passage may refer to the Caraway or Caraway-russet\r\nApple, an excellent little apple, that seems to be a variety of the\r\nNonpareil, and has long been cultivated in England, yet it is almost\r\ncertain that it means a dish of Caraway Seeds.

It is derived undoubtedly from the Latin _præcox or\r\npræcoquus_, under which name it is referred to by Pliny and Martial;\r\nbut, before it became the English Apricot it was much changed by\r\nItalians, Spaniards, French, and Arabians. The history of the name is\r\nvery curious and interesting, but too long to give fully here; a very\r\ngood account of it may be found in Miller and in \"Notes and Queries,\"\r\nvol. ii. p. 420 (1850). It will be sufficient to say here that it\r\nacquired its name of \"the precocious tree,\" because it flowered and\r\nfruited earlier than the Peach, as explained in Lyte's \"Herbal,\" 1578:\r\n\"There be two kinds of Peaches, whereof the one kinde is late ripe,\r\n. . . the other kinds are soner ripe, wherefore they be called Abrecox\r\nor Aprecox.\" Of its introduction into England we have no very certain\r\naccount. It was certainly grown in England before Turner's time (1548),\r\nthough he says, \"We have very few of these trees as yet;\"[23:1] but the\r\nonly account of its introduction is by Hakluyt, who states that it was\r\nbrought from Italy by one Wolf, gardener to King Henry the Eighth. If\r\nthat be its true history, Shakespeare was in error in putting it into\r\nthe garden of the queen of Richard the Second, nearly a hundred years\r\nbefore its introduction.[24:1]\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare's time the Apricot seems to have been grown as a\r\nstandard; I gather this from the description in Nos. 2 (see the entire\r\npassage s.v. \"Pruning\" in Part II.) and 3, and from the following in\r\nBrowne's \"Britannia's Pastorals\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Or if from where he is[24:2] he do espy\r\n      Some Apricot upon a bough thereby\r\n      Which overhangs the tree on which he stands,\r\n      Climbs up, and strives to take them with his hands.\"\r\n\r\n                                                 Book ii.

Yet considering how common a tree the Ash is, and in what high\r\nestimation it was held by our ancestors, it is strange that it is only\r\nmentioned in this one passage. Spenser spoke of it as \"the Ash for\r\nnothing ill;\" it was \"the husbandman's tree,\" from which he got the wood\r\nfor his agricultural implements; and there was connected with it a great\r\namount of mystic folk-lore, which was carried to its extreme limit in\r\nthe Yggdrasil, or legendary Ash of Scandinavia, which was almost looked\r\nupon as the parent of Creation: a full account of this may be found in\r\nMallet's \"Northern Antiquities\" and other works on Scandinavia. It is an\r\nEnglish native tree,[24:3] and it adds much to the beauty of any\r\nEnglish landscape in which it is allowed to grow. It gives its name to\r\nmany places, especially in the South, as Ashdown, Ashstead, Ashford,\r\n&c.; but to see it in its full beauty it must be seen in our northern\r\ncounties, though the finest in England is said to be at Woburn.\r\n\r\n     \"The Oak, the Ash, and the Ivy tree,\r\n      O, they flourished best at hame, in the north countrie.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    _Old Ballad._\r\n\r\nIn the dales of Yorkshire it is especially beautiful, and any one who\r\nsees the fine old trees in Wharfdale and Wensleydale will confess that,\r\nthough it may not have the rich luxuriance of the Oaks and Elms of the\r\nsouthern and midland counties, yet it has a grace and beauty that are\r\nall its own, so that we scarcely wonder that Gilpin called it \"the Venus\r\nof the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24:3] It is called in the \"Promptorium Parvulorum\" \"Esche,\" and the\r\nseed vessels \"Esche key.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Marcus._\r\n\r\n     O, had the monster seen those lily hands\r\n     Tremble, like Aspen leaves, upon a lute.\r\n\r\n                           _Titus Andronicus_, act 2, sc. 4 (44).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Hostess._\r\n\r\n     Feel, masters, how I shake. . . . .

How this perpetual motion in the \"light quivering Aspen\" is\r\nproduced has not been quite satisfactorily explained; and the mediæval\r\nlegend that it supplied the wood of the Cross, and has never since\r\nceased to tremble, is still told as a sufficient reason both in Scotland\r\nand England.\r\n\r\n                       \"Oh! a cause more deep,\r\n     More solemn far the rustic doth assign,\r\n     To the strange restlessness of those wan leaves;\r\n     The cross, he deems, the blessed cross, whereon\r\n     The meek Redeemer bowed His head to death,\r\n     Was formed of Aspen wood; and since that hour\r\n     Through all its race the pale tree hath sent down\r\n     A thrilling consciousness, a secret awe,\r\n     Making them tremulous, when not a breeze\r\n     Disturbs the airy thistle-down, or shakes\r\n     The light lines of the shining gossamer.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     MRS. HEMANS.\r\n\r\nThe Aspen has an interesting botanical history, as being undoubtedly,\r\nlike the Scotch fir, one of the primæval trees of Europe; while its grey\r\nbark and leaves and its pleasant rustling sound make the tree acceptable\r\nin our hedgerows, but otherwise it is not a tree of much use. In\r\nSpenser's time it was considered \"good for staves;\" and before his time\r\nthe tree must have been more valued than it is now, for in the reign of\r\nHenry V. an Act of Parliament was passed (4 Henry V. c. 3) to prevent\r\nthe consumption of Aspe, otherwise than for the making of arrows, with a\r\npenalty of an Hundred Shillings if used for making pattens or clogs.\r\nThis Act remained in force till the reign of James I., when it was\r\nrepealed. In our own time the wood is valued for internal panelling of\r\nrooms, and is used in the manufacture of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBy the older writers the Aspen was the favourite simile for female\r\nloquacity. The rude libel is given at full length in \"The Schoole-house\r\nof Women\" (511-545), concluding thus--\r\n\r\n     \"The Aspin lefe hanging where it be,\r\n      With little winde or none it shaketh;\r\n      A woman's tung in like wise taketh\r\n      Little ease and little rest;\r\n      For if it should the hart would brest.\"\r\n\r\n             HAZLITT'S _Popular English Poetry_, vol. iv, p. 126.\r\n\r\nAnd to the same effect Gerard concludes his account of the tree thus:\r\n\"In English Aspe and Aspen tree, and may also be called Tremble, after\r\nthe French name, considering it is the matter whereof women's tongues\r\nwere made (as the poets and some others report), which seldom cease\r\nwagging.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25:1] \"Espe\" in \"Promptorium Parvulorum.\" \"Aspen\" is the case-ending of\r\n\"Aspe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACHELOR'S BUTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hostess._\r\n\r\n     What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he dances, he\r\n       has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he\r\n       smells April and May; he will carry't, he will carry't; 'tis\r\n       in his Buttons; he will carry't.\r\n\r\n                              _Merry Wives_, act iii, sc. 2 (67).\r\n\r\n\"Though the Bachelor's Button is not exactly named by Shakespeare, it is\r\nbelieved to be alluded to in this passage; and the supposed allusion is\r\nto a rustic divination by means of the flowers, carried in the pocket by\r\nmen and under the apron by women, as it was supposed to retain or lose\r\nits freshness according to the good or bad success of the bearer's\r\namatory prospects.\"[27:1]\r\n\r\nThe true Bachelor's Button of the present day is the double Ranunculus\r\nacris, but the name is applied very loosely to almost any small double\r\nglobular flowers. In Shakespeare's time it was probably applied still\r\nmore loosely to any flowers in bud (according to the derivation from the\r\nFrench _bouton_). Button is frequently so applied by the old writers--\r\n\r\n     \"The more desire had I to goo\r\n      Unto the roser where that grewe\r\n      The freshe Bothum so bright of hewe.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      But o thing lyked me right welle;\r\n      I was so nygh, I myght fele\r\n      Of the Bothom the swote odour\r\n      And also see the fresshe colour;\r\n      And that right gretly liked me.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose._\r\n\r\nAnd by Shakespeare--\r\n\r\n     The canker galls the infants of the Spring\r\n     Too oft before their Buttons be disclosed.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act i, sc. 3 (54).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27:1] Mr. J.

The origin of Balsam was\r\nfor a long time a secret, but it is now known to have been the produce\r\nof several gum-bearing trees, especially the Pistacia lentiscus and the\r\nBalsamodendron Gileadense; and now, as then, the name is not strictly\r\nconfined to the produce of any one plant. But in Nos. 15 and 16 the\r\nreference is no doubt to the Sweet Balm of the English gardens (_Melissa\r\nofficinalis_), a plant highly prized by our ancestors for its medicinal\r\nqualities (now known to be of little value), and still valued for its\r\npleasant scent and its high value as a bee plant, which is shown by its\r\nold Greek and Latin names, Melissa, Mellissophyllum, and Apiastrum. The\r\nBastard Balm (_Melittis melissophyllum_) is a handsome native plant,\r\nfound sparingly in Devonshire, Hampshire, and a few other places, and is\r\nwell worth growing wherever it can be induced to grow; but it is a very\r\ncapricious plant, and is apparently not fond of garden cultivation.\r\n\"Très jolie plante, mais d'une culture difficile\" (Vilmorin). It\r\nprobably would thrive best in the shade, as it is found in copses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\r\n     Of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Vetches, Oats, and Pease.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Constable._\r\n\r\n                        Can sodden water,\r\n     A drench for surrein'd jades, their Barley broth,\r\n     Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?\r\n\r\n                            _Henry V_, act iii, sc. 5 (18).[30:1]\r\n\r\nThese two passages require little note. The Barley (_Hordeum vulgare_)\r\nof Shakespeare's time and our own is the same. We may note, however,\r\nthat the Barley broth (2) of which the French Constable spoke so\r\ncontemptuously as the food of English soldiers was probably beer, which\r\nlong before the time of Henry V. was so celebrated that it gave its name\r\nto the plant (Barley being simply the Beer-plant), and in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, \"though strangers never heard of such a word or such a thing, by\r\nreason it is not everyewhere made,\" yet \"our London Beere-Brewers would\r\nscorne to learne to make beere of either French or Dutch\" (Gerard).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30:1] \"Vires ordea prestant.\"--_Modus Cenandi_, 176.

But neither of these\r\nwriters have quoted the testimony of Sir John Mandeville, which is,\r\nhowever, well worth notice.

In the\r\nfirst there is little doubt that Shakespeare copied from some Italian\r\nsource the superstition that the Bay trees in a country withered and\r\ndied when any great calamity was approaching. We have no proof that such\r\nan idea ever prevailed in England. In the second passage reference is\r\nmade to the decking of the chief dish at high feasts with garlands of\r\nflowers and evergreens. But the Bay tree had been too recently\r\nintroduced from the South of Europe in Shakespeare's time to be so used\r\nto any great extent, though the tree was known long before, for it is\r\nmentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Vocabularies by the name of Beay-beam,\r\nthat is, the Coronet tree;[32:1] but whether the Beay-beam meant our Bay\r\ntree is very uncertain. We are not much helped in the inquiry by the\r\nnotice of the \"flourishing green Bay tree\" in the Psalms, for it seems\r\nvery certain that the Bay tree there mentioned is either the Oleander or\r\nthe Cedar, certainly not the Laurus nobilis.\r\n\r\nThe true Bay is probably mentioned by Spenser in the following lines--\r\n\r\n     \"The Bay, quoth she, is of the victours born,\r\n      Yielded them by the vanquisht as theyr meeds,\r\n      And they therewith doe Poetes heads adorne\r\n      To sing the glory of their famous deeds.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _Amoretti_--Sonnet xxix.\r\n\r\nAnd in the following passage (written in the lifetime of Shakespeare)\r\nthe Laurel and the Bay are both named as the same tree--\r\n\r\n     \"And when from Daphne's tree he plucks more Baies\r\n      His shepherd's pipe may chant more heavenly lays.\"\r\n\r\n                            _Christopher Brooke_--_Introd. verses\r\n                                        to_ BROWNE'S _Pastorals._\r\n\r\nIn the present day no garden of shrubs can be considered complete\r\nwithout the Bay tree, both the common one and especially the Californian\r\nBay (_Oreodaphne Californica_), which, with its bright green lanceolate\r\nfoliage and powerful aromatic scent (to some too pungent), deserves a\r\nplace everywhere, and it is not so liable to be cut by the spring winds\r\nas the European Bay.[32:2] Parkinson's high praise of the Bay tree\r\n(forty years after Shakespeare's death) is too long for insertion, but\r\ntwo short sentences may be quoted: \"The Bay leaves are of as necessary\r\nuse as any other in the garden or orchard, for they serve both for\r\npleasure and profit, both for ornament and for use, both for honest\r\ncivil uses and for physic, yea, both for the sick and for the sound,\r\nboth for the living and for the dead; . . . so that from the cradle to\r\nthe grave we have still use of it, we have still need of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bay tree gives us a curious instance of the capriciousness of\r\nEnglish plant names. Though a true Laurel it does not bear the\r\nname, which yet is given to two trees, the common (and Portugal)\r\nLaurel, and the Laurestinus, neither of which are Laurels--the one\r\nbeing a Cherry or Plum (_Prunus_ or _Cerasus_), the other a Guelder Rose\r\n(_Viburnum_).[33:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32:1] \"The Anglo-Saxon Beay was not a ring only, or an armlet: it was\r\nalso a coronet or diadem. . . .

By some it\r\nwas highly esteemed--\r\n\r\n     \"Corpus alit Faba; stringit cum cortice ventrem,\r\n      Desiccat fleuma, stomacum lumenque relidit\"--\r\n\r\nis the description of the Bean in the \"Modus Cenandi,\" l. 182 (\"Babee's\r\nBook,\" ii, 48). While H. Vaughan describes it as--\r\n\r\n                           \"The Bean\r\n     By curious pallats never sought;\"\r\n\r\nand it was very generally used as a proverb of contempt--\r\n\r\n     \"None other lif, sayd he, is worth a Bene.\"[34:1]\r\n\r\n     \"But natheles I reche not a Bene.\"[34:2]\r\n\r\nIt is not apparently a romantic plant, and yet there is no plant round\r\nwhich so much curious folk lore has gathered. This may be seen at full\r\nlength in Phillips' \"History of Cultivated Vegetables.\" It will be\r\nenough here to say that the Bean was considered as a sacred plant both\r\nby the Greeks and Romans, while by the Egyptian priests it was\r\nconsidered too unclean to be even looked upon; that it was used both for\r\nits convenient shape and for its sacred associations in all elections by\r\nballot; that this custom lasted in England and in most Europeans\r\ncountries to a very recent date in the election of the kings and queens\r\nat Twelfth Night and other feasts; and that it was of great repute in\r\nall popular divinations and love charms. I find in Miller another use of\r\nBeans, which we are thankful to note among the obsolete uses: \"They are\r\nbought up in great quantities at Bristol for Guinea ships, as food for\r\nthe negroes on their passage from Africa to the West Indies.\"\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental garden plant the Bean has never received the attention\r\nit seems to deserve. A plant of Broad Beans grown singly is quite a\r\nstately plant, and the rich scent is an additional attraction to many,\r\nthough to many others it is too strong, and it has a bad\r\ncharacter--\"Sleep in a Bean-field all night if you want to have awful\r\ndreams or go crazy,\" is a Leicestershire proverb:[34:3] and the Scarlet\r\nRunner (which is also a Bean) is one of the most beautiful climbers we\r\nhave. In England we seldom grow it for ornament, but in France I have\r\nseen it used with excellent effect to cover a trellis-screen, mixed with\r\nthe large blue Convolvulus major.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34:1] Chaucer, \"The Marchandes Tale,\" 19.\r\n\r\n[34:2] Ibid., \"The Man of Lawes Tale,\" prologue.\r\n\r\n[34:3] Copied from the mediæval proverb: \"Cum faba florescit, stultorum\r\ncopia crescit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBILBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Pistol._\r\n\r\n     Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,\r\n     There pinch the maids as blue as Bilberry--\r\n     Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery.\r\n\r\n                                _Merry Wives_, act v, sc. 5 (48).\r\n\r\nThe Bilberry is a common British shrub found on all mossy heaths, and\r\nvery pretty both in flower and in fruit. Its older English name was\r\nHeathberry, and its botanical name is Vaccinium myrtillus. We have in\r\nBritain four species of Vaccinium: the Whortleberry or Bilberry (_V.\r\nmyrtillus_), the Large Bilberry (_V. uliginosum_), the Crowberry (_V.\r\nvitis idæa_), and the Cranberry (_V. oxycoccos_). These British species,\r\nas well as the North American species (of which there are several), are\r\nall beautiful little shrubs in cultivation, but they are very difficult\r\nto grow; they require a heathy soil, moisture, and partial shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Duke._\r\n\r\n                                Fond fathers,\r\n     Having bound up the threatening twigs of Birch,\r\n     Only to stick it in their children's sight\r\n     For terror, not to use, in time the rod\r\n     Becomes more mock'd than fear'd.\r\n\r\n                        _Measure for Measure_, act i, sc. 3 (23).\r\n\r\nShakespeare only mentions this one unpleasant use of the Birch tree, the\r\nmanufacture of Birch rods; and for such it seems to have been chiefly\r\nvalued in his day. \"I have not red of any vertue it hath in physick,\"\r\nsays Turner; \"howbeit, it serveth for many good uses, and for none\r\nbetter than for betynge of stubborn boys, that either lye or will not\r\nlearn.\" Yet the Birch is not without interest. The word \"Birch\" is the\r\nsame as \"bark,\" meaning first the rind of a tree and then a barque or\r\nboat (from which we also get our word \"barge\"), and so the very name\r\ncarries us to those early times when the Birch was considered one of\r\nthe most useful of trees, as it still is in most northern countries,\r\nwhere it grows at a higher degree of latitude than any other tree. Its\r\nbark was especially useful, being useful for cordage, and matting, and\r\nroofing, while the tree itself formed the early British canoes, as it\r\nstill forms the canoes of the North American Indians, for which it is\r\nwell suited, from its lightness and ease in working.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Europe it is the most universal and the most useful of\r\ntrees. It is \"the superlative tree in respect of the ground it covers,\r\nand in the variety of purposes to which it is converted in Lapland,\r\nwhere the natives sit in birchen huts on birchen chairs, wearing birchen\r\nboots and breeches, with caps and capes of the same material, warming\r\nthemselves by fires of birchwood charcoal, reading books bound in birch,\r\nand eating herrings from a birchen platter, pickled in a birchen cask.\r\nTheir baskets, boats, harness, and utensils are all of Birch; in short,\r\nfrom cradle to coffin, the Birch forms the peculiar environment of the\r\nLaplander.\"[36:1] In England we still admire its graceful beauty,\r\nwhether it grows in our woods or our gardens, and we welcome its\r\npleasant odour on our Russia leather bound books; but we have ceased to\r\nmake beer from its young shoots,[36:2] and we hold it in almost as low\r\nrepute (from the utilitarian point of view) as Turner and Shakespeare\r\nseem to have held it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36:1] \"Gardener's Chronicle.\"\r\n\r\n[36:2] \"Although beer is now seldom made from birchen twigs, yet it is\r\nby no means an uncommon practice in some country districts to tap the\r\nwhite trunks of Birches, and collect the sweet sap which exudes from\r\nthem for wine-making purposes. In some parts of Leicestershire this sap\r\nis collected in large quantities every spring, and birch wine, when well\r\nmade, is a wholesome and by no means an unpleasant beverage.\"--B. in\r\n_The Garden_, April, 1877. \"The Finlanders substitute the leaves of\r\nBirch for those of the tea-plant; the Swedes extract a syrup from the\r\nsap, from which they make a spirituous liquor.

There is not much to be said for a\r\nplant that is the proverbial type of a barren country or untidy\r\ncultivation, yet the Bramble and the Blackberry have their charms, and\r\nwe could ill afford to lose them from our hedgerows. The name Bramble\r\noriginally meant anything thorny, and Chaucer applied it to the Dog\r\nRose--\r\n\r\n     \"He was chaste and no lechour,\r\n      And sweet as is the Bramble flower\r\n        That bereth the red hepe.\"\r\n\r\nBut in Shakespeare's time it was evidently confined to the\r\nBlackberry-bearing Bramble.\r\n\r\nThere is a quaint legend of the origin of the plant which is worth\r\nrepeating. It is thus pleasantly told by Waterton: \"The cormorant was\r\nonce a wool merchant. He entered into partnership with the Bramble and\r\nthe bat, and they freighted a large ship with wool; she was wrecked, and\r\nthe firm became bankrupt. Since that disaster the bat skulks about till\r\nmidnight to avoid his creditors, the cormorant is for ever diving into\r\nthe deep to discover its foundered vessel, while the Bramble seizes\r\nhold of every passing sheep to make up his loss by stealing the wool.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant, the common Bramble had better be kept out of the\r\ngarden, but there are double pink and white-blossomed varieties, and\r\nothers with variegated leaves, that are handsome plants on rough\r\nrockwork. The little Rubus saxatilis is a small British Bramble that is\r\npretty on rockwork, and among the foreign Brambles there are some that\r\nshould on no account be omitted where ornamental shrubs are grown. Such\r\nare the R. leucodermis from Nepaul, with its bright silvery bark and\r\namber-coloured fruit; R. Nootkanus, with very handsome foliage, and pure\r\nwhite rose-like flowers; R. Arcticus, an excellent rockwork plant from\r\nNorthern Europe, with very pleasant fruit, but difficult to establish;\r\nR. Australis (from New Zealand), a most quaint plant, with leaves so\r\ndepauperated that it is apparently leafless, and hardy in the South of\r\nEngland; and R. deliciosus, a very handsome plant from the Rocky\r\nMountains. There are several others well worth growing, but I mention\r\nthese few to show that the Bramble is not altogether such a villainous\r\nand useless weed as it is proverbially supposed to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37:1] _See_ RAISINS, p. 238.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Maria._ Get ye all three into the Box tree.\r\n\r\n                             _Twelfth Night_, act ii, sc. 5 (18).\r\n\r\nThe Box is a native British tree, and in the sixteenth century was\r\nprobably much more abundant as a wild tree than it is now. Chaucer notes\r\nit as a dismal tree. He describes Palamon in his misery as--\r\n\r\n                \"Like was he to byholde,\r\n     The Boxe tree or the Asschen deed and colde.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _The Knightes Tale._\r\n\r\nSpenser noted it as \"The Box yet mindful of his olde offence,\" and in\r\nShakespeare's time there were probably more woods of Box in England than\r\nthe two which still remain at Box Hill, in Surrey, and Boxwell, in\r\nGloucestershire. The name remains, though the trees are gone, in Box in\r\nWilts, Boxgrove, Boxley, Boxmoor, Boxted, and Boxworth.[39:1] From its\r\nwild quarters the Box tree was very early brought into gardens, and was\r\nespecially valued, not only for its rich evergreen colour, but because,\r\nwith the Yew, it could be cut and tortured into all the ungainly shapes\r\nwhich so delighted our ancestors in Shakespeare's time, though one of\r\nthe most illustrious of them, Lord Bacon, entered his protest against\r\nsuch barbarisms: \"I, for my part, do not like images cut out in Juniper\r\nor other garden stuff; they be for children\" (\"Essay of Gardens\").\r\n\r\nThe chief use of the Box now is for blocks for wood-carving, for which\r\nits close grain makes it the most suitable of all woods.[39:2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39:1] In Boxford, and perhaps in some of the other names, the word has\r\nno connection with the tree, but marks the presence of water or a\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n[39:2] In some parts of Europe almost a sacred character is given to the\r\nBox.

In some of the passages\r\nit probably does not allude to any Rose, but simply to any wild thorny\r\nplant. That this was its common use then, we know from many examples. In\r\n\"Le Morte Arthur,\" the Earl of Ascolot's daughter is described--\r\n\r\n     \"Hyr Rode was rede as blossom or Brere\r\n      Or floure that springith in the felde\" (179).\r\n\r\nAnd in \"A Pleasant New Court Song,\" in the Roxburghe Ballads--\r\n\r\n     \"I stept me close aside\r\n      Under a Hawthorn Bryer.\"\r\n\r\nIt bears the same meaning in our Bibles, where \"Thorns,\" \"Brambles,\" and\r\n\"Briers,\" stand for any thorny and useless plant, the soil of Palestine\r\nbeing especially productive of thorny plants of many kinds. Wickliffe's\r\ntranslation of Matthew vii. 16, is--\"Whether men gaderen grapis of\r\nthornes; or figis of Breris?\" and Tyndale's translation is much the\r\nsame--\"Do men gaddre grapes of thornes, or figges of Bryeres?\"[41:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41:1] \"Brere--Carduus, tribulus, vepres, veprecula.\"--_Catholicon\r\nAnglicum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Iris._\r\n\r\n           And thy Broom groves,\r\n     Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\r\n     Being lass-lorn.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (66).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Puck._\r\n\r\n     I am sent with Broom before\r\n     To sweep the dust behind the door.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act v, sc. 1 (396).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Man._\r\n\r\n     I made good my place; at length they came to the Broomstaff\r\n       with me.\r\n\r\n                                 _Henry VIII_, act v, sc. 4 (56).\r\n\r\nThe Broom was one of the most popular plants of the Middle Ages. Its\r\nmodern Latin name is _Cytisus scoparius_, but under its then Latin name\r\nof _Planta genista_ it gave its name to the Plantagenet family, either\r\nin the time of Henry II., as generally reported, or probably still\r\nearlier. As the favourite badge of the family it appears on their\r\nmonuments and portraits, and was embroidered on their clothes and\r\nimitated in their jewels. Nor was it only in England that the plant was\r\nheld in such high favour; it was the special flower of the Scotch, and\r\nit was highly esteemed in many countries on the Continent, especially in\r\nBrittany. Yet, in spite of all this, there are only these three notices\r\nof the plant in Shakespeare, and of those three, two (2 and 3) refer to\r\nits uses when dead; and the third (1), though it speaks of it as living,\r\nyet has nothing to say of the remarkable beauties of this favourite\r\nBritish flower.

We\r\nare almost driven to the conclusion that Shakespeare could not have had\r\nmuch real acquaintance with the Broom, or he would not have sent his\r\n\"dismissed bachelor\" to \"Broom-groves.\"[42:1] I should very much doubt\r\nthat the Broom could ever attain to the dimensions of a grove, though\r\nSteevens has a note on the passage that \"near Gamlingay, in\r\nCambridgeshire, it grows high enough to conceal the tallest cattle as\r\nthey pass through it; and in places where it is cultivated still\r\nhigher.\" Chaucer speaks of the Broom, but does not make it so much of a\r\ntree--\r\n\r\n     \"Amid the Broom he basked in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd other poets have spoken of the Broom in the same way--thus Collins--\r\n\r\n     \"When Dan Sol to slope his wheels began\r\n      Amid the Broom he basked him on the ground.\"\r\n\r\n                                  _Castle of Indolence_, canto i.\r\n\r\nAnd a Russian poet speaks of the Broom as a tree--\r\n\r\n     \"See there upon the Broom tree's bough\r\n      The young grey eagle flapping now.\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Flora Domestica_, p. 68.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant it is perhaps seen to best advantage when mixed with\r\nother shrubs, as when grown quite by itself it often has an untidy look.\r\nThere is a pure white variety which is very beautiful, but it is very\r\nliable to flower so abundantly as to flower itself to death. There are a\r\nfew other sorts, but none more beautiful than the British.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42:1] Yet Bromsgrove must be a corruption of Broom-grove, and there are\r\nother places in England named from the Broom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULRUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Wooer._\r\n\r\n                Her careless tresses\r\n     A wreake of Bulrush rounded.\r\n\r\n                        _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1 (104).\r\n\r\n_See_ RUSH, p. 262.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURDOCK AND BURS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Celia._\r\n\r\n     They are but Burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday\r\n       foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths our very\r\n       petticoats will catch them.\r\n\r\n     _Rosalind._\r\n\r\n     I could shake them off my coat; these Burs are in my heart.\r\n\r\n                             _As You Like It_, act i, sc. 3 (13).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Lucio._\r\n\r\n     Nay, friar, I am a kind of Bur; I shall stick.\r\n\r\n                      _Measure for Measure_, act iv, sc. 3 (149).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Lysander._\r\n\r\n     Hang oft, thou cat, thou Burr.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 2 (260).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Pandarus._\r\n\r\n     They are Burs, I can tell you; they'll stick where\r\n       they are thrown.\r\n\r\n                    _Troilus and Cressida_, act iii, sc. 2 (118).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Burgundy._\r\n\r\n                  And nothing teems\r\n     But hateful Docks, rough Thistles, Kecksies, Burs.\r\n\r\n                                    _Henry V_, act v, sc. 2 (51).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Cordelia._\r\n\r\n     Crown'd with rank Fumiter and Furrow-weeds,\r\n     With Burdocks, Hemlock, Nettles, Cuckoo-flowers.\r\n\r\n                                  _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 4 (3).\r\n\r\nThe Burs are the unopened flowers of the Burdock (_Arctium lappa_), and\r\ntheir clinging quality very early obtained for them expressive names,\r\nsuch as _amor folia_, love leaves, and philantropium. This clinging\r\nquality arises from the bracts of the involucrum being long and stiff,\r\nand with hooked tips which attach themselves to every passing object.\r\nThe Burdock is a very handsome plant when seen in its native habitat by\r\nthe side of a brook, its broad leaves being most picturesque, but it is\r\nnot a plant to introduce into a garden.[44:1] There is another tribe of\r\nplants, however, which are sufficiently ornamental to merit a place in\r\nthe garden, and whose Burs are even more clinging than those of the\r\nBurdock. These are the Acænas; they are mostly natives of America and\r\nNew Zealand, and some of them (especially A. sarmentosa and A.\r\nmicrophylla) form excellent carpet plants, but their points being\r\nfurnished with double hooks, like a double-barbed arrow, they have\r\ndouble powers of clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNET.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Burgundy._\r\n\r\n     The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\r\n     The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and green Clover.\r\n\r\n                                    _Henry V._ act v, sc. 2 (48).\r\n\r\nThe Burnet (_Poterium sanguisorba_) is a native plant of no great beauty\r\nor horticultural interest, but it was valued as a good salad plant, the\r\nleaves tasting of Cucumber, and Lord Bacon (contemporary with\r\nShakespeare) seems to have been especially fond of it. He says (\"Essay\r\nof Gardens\"):\r\n\r\n\"Those flowers which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by\r\nas the rest, but being trodden upon and crushed, are three--that is,\r\nBurnet, Wild Thyme, and Water Mints; therefore you are to set whole\r\nalleys of them, to have the pleasure when you walk or tread.\" Drayton\r\nhad the same affection for it--\r\n\r\n     \"The Burnet shall bear up with this,\r\n      Whose leaf I greatly fancy.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     _Nymphal V._\r\n\r\nIt also was, and still is, valued as a forage plant that will grow and\r\nkeep fresh all the winter in dry barren pastures, thus often giving food\r\nfor sheep when other food was scarce. It has occasionally been\r\ncultivated, but the result has not been very satisfactory, except on\r\nvery poor land, though, according to the Woburn experiments, as reported\r\nby Sinclair, it contains a larger amount of nutritive matter in the\r\nspring than most of the Grasses. It has brown flowers, from which it is\r\nsupposed to derive its name (Brunetto).[45:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44:1]\r\n\r\n     \"A Clote-leef he had under his hood\r\n      For swoot, and to keep his heed from hete.\"\r\n\r\n                 CHAUCER, _Prologue of the Chanounes Yeman_ (25).\r\n\r\nThis Clote leaf is by many considered to be the Burdock leaf, but it was\r\nmore probably the name of the Water-lily.\r\n\r\n[45:1] \"Burnet colowre, Burnetum, burnetus.\"--_Promptorium Parvulorum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Evans._\r\n\r\n     _Pauca verba_, Sir John; good worts.\r\n\r\n     _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Good worts! good Cabbage.\r\n\r\n                               _Merry Wives_, act i, sc. 1 (123).\r\n\r\nThe history of the name is rather curious. It comes to us from the\r\nFrench _Chou cabus_, which is the French corruption of _Caulis\r\ncapitatus_, the name by which Pliny described it.\r\n\r\nThe Cabbage of Shakespeare's time was essentially the same as ours, and\r\nfrom the contemporary accounts it seems that the sorts cultivated were\r\nas good and as numerous as they are now. The cultivated Cabbage is the\r\nsame specifically as the wild Cabbage of our sea-shores (_Brassica\r\noleracea_) improved by cultivation. Within the last few years the\r\nCabbage has been brought from the kitchen garden into the flower garden\r\non account of the beautiful variegation of its leaves. This, however, is\r\nno novelty, for Parkinson said of the many sorts of Cabbage in his day:\r\n\"There is greater diversity in the form and colour of the leaves of\r\nthis plant than there is in any other that I know groweth on the\r\nground. . . . Many of them being of no use with us for the table, but\r\nfor delight to behold the wonderful variety of the works of God herein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMOMILE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Though the Camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it\r\n       grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner it wears.\r\n\r\n                             _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (443).\r\n\r\nThe low-growing Camomile, the emblem of the sweetness of humility, has\r\nthe lofty names of Camomile (_Chamæmelum_, _i.e._, Apple of the Earth)\r\nand Anthemis nobilis. Its fine aromatic scent and bitter flavour\r\nsuggested that it must be possessed of much medicinal virtue, while its\r\nlow growth made it suitable for planting on the edges of flower-beds and\r\npaths, its scent being brought out as it was walked upon. For this\r\npurpose it was much used in Elizabethan gardens; \"large walks, broad and\r\nlong, close and open, like the Tempe groves in Thessaly, raised with\r\ngravel and sand, having seats and banks of Camomile; all this delights\r\nthe mind, and brings health to the body.\"[46:1] As a garden flower it is\r\nnow little used, though its bright starry flower and fine scent might\r\nrecommend it; but it is still to be found in herb gardens, and is still,\r\nthough not so much as formerly, used as a medicine.\r\n\r\nLike many other low plants, the Camomile is improved by being pressed\r\ninto the earth by rolling or otherwise, and there are many allusions to\r\nthis in the old writers: thus Lily in his \"Euphues\" says: \"The Camomile\r\nthe more it is trodden and pressed down, the more it spreadeth;\" and in\r\nthe play, \"The More the Merrier\" (1608), we have--\r\n\r\n     \"The Camomile shall teach thee patience\r\n      Which riseth best when trodden most upon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46:1] Lawson, \"New Orchard,\" p. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDUUS, _see_ HOLY THISTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n     The fairest flowers o' the season\r\n     Are our Carnations and streak'd Gillyvors,\r\n     Which some call Nature's bastards.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (81).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Polyxenes._\r\n\r\n     Then make your garden rich in Gillyvors,\r\n     And do not call them bastards.\r\n\r\n                                                    _Ibid._ (98).\r\n\r\nThere are two other places in which Carnation is mentioned, but they\r\nrefer to carnation colour--_i.e._, to pure flesh colour.\r\n\r\n     (3) _Quickly._\r\n\r\n     'A could never abide Carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.\r\n\r\n                                   _Henry V_, act ii, sc. 3 (35).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Costard._\r\n\r\n     Pray you, sir, how much Carnation riband may a man buy for a\r\n       remuneration?\r\n\r\n                    _Love's Labour's Lost_, act iii, sc. 1 (146).\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson and others have supposed that the flower is so named from\r\nthe colour, but that this is a mistake is made very clear by Dr. Prior.\r\nHe quotes Spenser's \"Shepherd's Calendar\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Bring Coronations and Sops-in-Wine\r\n      Worn of Paramours.\"\r\n\r\nand so it is spelled in Lyte's \"Herbal,\" 1578, coronations or\r\ncornations. This takes us at once to the origin of the name. The plant\r\nwas one of those used in garlands (_coronæ_), and was probably one of\r\nthe most favourite plants used for that purpose, for which it was well\r\nsuited by its shape and beauty. Pliny gives a long list of garland\r\nflowers (_Coronamentorum genera_) used by the Romans and Athenians, and\r\nNicander gives similar lists of Greek garland plants (στεφανωματικὰ\r\nἄνθη), in which the Carnation holds so high a place that it was called\r\nby the name it still has--Dianthus, or Flower of Jove.\r\n\r\nIts second specific name, Caryophyllus--_i.e._, Nut-leaved--seems at\r\nfirst very inappropriate for a grassy leaved plant, but the name was\r\nfirst given to the Indian Clove-tree, and from it transferred to the\r\nCarnation, on account of its fine clove-like scent. Its popularity as an\r\nEnglish plant is shown by its many names--Pink, Carnation,\r\nGilliflower[48:1] (an easily-traced and well-ascertained corruption from\r\nCaryophyllus), Clove, Picotee,[48:2] and Sops-in-Wine, from the flowers\r\nbeing used to flavour wine and beer.[48:3] There is an historical\r\ninterest also in the flowers. All our Carnations, Picotees, and Cloves\r\ncome originally from the single Dianthus caryophyllus; this is not a\r\ntrue British plant, but it holds a place in the English flora, being\r\nnaturalized on Rochester and other castles. It is abundant in Normandy,\r\nand I found it (in 1874) covering the old castle of Falaise in which\r\nWilliam the Conqueror was born. Since that I have found that it grows on\r\nthe old castles of Dover, Deal, and Cardiff, all of them of Norman\r\nconstruction, as was Rochester, which was built by Gundulf, the special\r\nfriend of William. Its occurrence on these several Norman castles make\r\nit very possible that it was introduced by the Norman builders, perhaps\r\nas a pleasant memory of their Norman homes, though it may have been\r\naccidentally introduced with the Normandy (Caen) stone, of which parts\r\nof the castles are built. How soon it became a florist's flower we do\r\nnot know, but it must have been early, as in Shakespeare's time the\r\nsorts of Cloves, Carnations, and Pinks were so many that Gerard says: \"A\r\ngreat and large volume would not suffice to write of every one at large\r\nin particular, considering how infinite they are, and how every yeare,\r\nevery clymate and countrey, bringeth forth new sorts, and such as have\r\nnot heretofore bin written of;\" and so we may certainly say now--the\r\ndescription of the many kinds of Carnations and Picotees, with\r\ndirections for their culture, would fill a volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48:1] This is the more modern way of spelling it. In the first folio it\r\nis \"Gillyvor.\" \"Chaucer writes it Gylofre, but by associating it with\r\nthe the Nutmeg and other spices, appears to mean the Clove Tree, which\r\nis, in fact, the proper signification.\"--_Flora Domestica._ In the\r\n\"Digby Mysteries\" (Mary Magdalene, l. 1363) the Virgin Mary is addressed\r\nas \"the Jentyll Jelopher.\"\r\n\r\n[48:2] Picotee is from the French word _picoté_ marked with little\r\npricks round the edge, like the \"picots,\" on lace, _picot_ being the\r\ntechnical term in France for the small twirls which in England are\r\ncalled \"purl\" or \"pearl.\"\r\n\r\n[48:3] Wine thus flavoured was evidently a very favourite beverage.\r\n\"Bartholemeus Peytevyn tenet duas Caracutas terræ in Stony-Aston in Com.\r\nSomerset de Domino Rege in capite per servitium unius[48:a] Sextarii\r\nvini Gariophilati reddendi Domino Regi per annum ad Natale Domini.

In Shakespeare's time the seed was very popular, and was much\r\nmore freely used than in our day. \"The seed,\" says Parkinson, \"is much\r\nused to be put among baked fruit, or into bread, cakes, &c., to give\r\nthem a rellish. It is also made into comfits and put into Trageas or (as\r\nwe call them in English) Dredges, that are taken for cold or wind in the\r\nbody, as also are served to the table with fruit.\"\r\n\r\nCarraways are frequently mentioned in the old writers as an\r\naccompaniment to Apples. In a very interesting bill of fare of 1626,\r\nextracted from the account book of Sir Edward Dering, is the following--\r\n\r\n     \"Carowaye and comfites, 6d.\r\n\r\n      A Warden py that the cooke\r\n      Made--we fining y{e} Wardens. 2s. 4d.\r\n\r\n          Second Course.\r\n\r\n      A cold Warden pie.\r\n\r\n          Complement.\r\n      Apples and Carrawayes.\"--_Notes and Queries_, i, 99.\r\n\r\nSo in Russell's \"Book of Nurture:\" \"After mete . . . pepyns Careaway in\r\ncomfyte,\" line 78, and the same in line 714; and in Wynkyn de Worde's\r\n\"Boke of Kervynge\" (\"Babee's Book,\" p. 266 and 271), and in F.

In Shakespeare's time the name was applied to the \"Yellow\r\nCarrot\" or Parsnep, as well as to the Red one. The name of Carrot comes\r\ndirectly from its Latin or rather Greek name, Daucus Carota, but it\r\nonce had a prettier name. The Anglo-Saxons called it \"bird's-nest,\" and\r\nGerard gives us the reason, and it is a reason that shows they were more\r\nobservant of the habits of plants than we generally give them credit\r\nfor: \"The whole tuft (of flowers) is drawn together when the seed is\r\nripe, resembling a bird's nest; whereupon it hath been named of some\r\nBird's-nest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n             And by the spurs pluck'd up\r\n     The Pine and Cedar.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act v, sc. 1 (47).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Dumain._\r\n\r\n     As upright as the Cedar.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act iv, sc. 3 (89).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Warwick._\r\n\r\n     As on a mountain top the Cedar shows,\r\n     That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm.\r\n\r\n                              _2nd Henry VI_, act v, sc. 1 (205).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Warwick._\r\n\r\n     Thus yields the Cedar to the axe's edge,\r\n     Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,\r\n     Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,\r\n     Whose top-branch o'erpeered Jove's spreading tree,\r\n     And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.\r\n\r\n                               _3rd Henry VI_, act v, sc. 2 (11).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Cranmer._\r\n\r\n                 He shall flourish,\r\n     And, like a mountain Cedar, reach his branches\r\n     To all the plains about him.\r\n\r\n                                _Henry VIII_, act v, sc. 5 (215).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Posthumus._\r\n\r\n     When from a stately Cedar shall be lopped branches, which,\r\n       being dead many years, shall after revive.\r\n\r\n         _Cymbeline_, act v, sc. 4 (140); and act v, sc. 5 (457).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Soothsayer._\r\n\r\n     The lofty Cedar, royal Cymbeline,\r\n     Personates thee.

So Shakespeare uses it, and only\r\nin this way; for it is very certain he never saw a living specimen of\r\nthe Cedar of Lebanon. But many travellers in the East had seen it and\r\nminutely described it, and from their descriptions he derived his\r\nknowledge of the tree; but not only, and probably not chiefly from\r\ntravellers, for he was well acquainted with his Bible, and there he\r\nwould meet with many a passage that dwelt on the glories of the Cedar,\r\nand told how it was the king of trees, so that \"the Fir trees were not\r\nlike his boughs, and the Chestnut trees were not like his branches, nor\r\nany tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty, fair by\r\nthe multitude of his branches, so that all the trees of Eden that were\r\nin the garden of God envied him\" (Ezekiel xxxi. 8, 9). It was such\r\ndescriptions as these that supplied Shakespeare with his imagery, and\r\nwhich made our ancestors try to introduce the tree into England. But\r\nthere seems to have been much difficulty in establishing it. Evelyn\r\ntried to introduce it, but did not succeed at first, and the tree is not\r\nmentioned in his \"Sylva\" of 1664. It was, however, certainly introduced\r\nin 1676, when it appears, from the gardeners' accounts, to have been\r\nplanted at Bretby Park, Derbyshire (\"Gardener's Chronicle,\" January,\r\n1877). I believe this is the oldest certain record of the planting of\r\nthe Cedar in England, the next oldest being the trees in Chelsea Botanic\r\nGardens, which were certainly planted in 1683. Since that time the tree\r\nhas proved so suitable to the English soil that it is grown everywhere,\r\nand everywhere asserts itself as the king of evergreen trees, whether\r\ngrown as a single tree on a lawn, or mixed in large numbers with other\r\ntrees, as at Highclere Park, in Hampshire (Lord Carnarvon's). Among\r\nEnglish Cedar trees there are probably none that surpass the fine\r\nspecimens at Warwick Castle, which owe, however, much of their beauty to\r\ntheir position on the narrow strip of land between the Castle and the\r\nriver. I mention these to call attention to the pleasant coincidence\r\n(for it is nothing more) that the most striking descriptions of the\r\nCedar are given by Shakespeare to the then owner of the princely Castle\r\nof Warwick (Nos. 3 and 4).\r\n\r\nThe mediæval belief about the Cedar was that its wood was imperishable.\r\n\"Hæc Cedrus, A{e} sydyretre, et est talis nature quod nunquam putrescet\r\nin aqua nec in terra\" (English Vocabulary--15th cent.); but as a timber\r\ntree the English-grown Cedar has not answered to its old reputation, so\r\nthat Dr. Lindley called it \"the worthless though magnificent Cedar of\r\nLebanon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Helena._\r\n\r\n                So we grew together,\r\n     Like to a double Cherry, seeming parted,\r\n     But yet a union in partition;\r\n     Two lovely berries moulded on one stem.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 2 (208).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Demetrius._\r\n\r\n               O, how ripe in show\r\n     Thy lips, those kissing Cherries, tempting grow!\r\n\r\n                                   _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 2 (139).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Constance._\r\n\r\n                And it' grandam will\r\n     Give it a Plum, a Cherry, and a Fig.\r\n\r\n                                _King John_, act ii, sc. 1 (161).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Lady._\r\n\r\n               'Tis as like you\r\n     As Cherry is to Cherry.\r\n\r\n                                _Henry VIII_, act v, sc. 1 (170).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Gower._\r\n\r\n        She with her neeld composes\r\n     Nature's own shape of bud, bird, branch, or berry;\r\n     That even her art sisters the natural Roses,\r\n     Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied Cherry.\r\n\r\n                                   _Pericles_, act v, chorus (5).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Dromio of Syracuse._\r\n\r\n     Some devils ask but the paring of one's nail,\r\n     A Rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\r\n     A Nut, a Cherry-stone.\r\n\r\n                          _Comedy of Errors_, act iv, sc. 3 (72).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Queen._\r\n\r\n                Oh, when\r\n     The twyning Cherries shall their sweetness fall\r\n     Upon thy tasteful lips.\r\n\r\n                         _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act i, sc. 1 (198).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8)\r\n\r\n     When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,\r\n     That some would sing, some other in their bills\r\n     Would bring him Mulberries and ripe-red Cherries.\r\n     He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.\r\n\r\n                                       _Venus and Adonis_ (1101).\r\n\r\nBesides these, there is mention of \"cherry lips\"[54:1] and\r\n\"cherry-nose,\"[54:2] and the game of \"cherry-pit.\"[54:3] We have the\r\nauthority of Pliny that the Cherry (_Prunus Cerasus_) was introduced\r\ninto Italy from Pontus, and by the Romans was introduced into Britain.\r\nIt is not, then, a true native, but it has now become completely\r\nnaturalized in our woods and hedgerows, while the cultivated trees are\r\neverywhere favourites for the beauty of their flowers, and their rich\r\nand handsome fruit. In Shakespeare's time there were almost as many, and\r\nprobably as good varieties, as there are now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54:1] _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act v, sc. 1; _Richard III_, act i,\r\nsc. 1; _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1.\r\n\r\n[54:2] _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act v, sc. 1.\r\n\r\n[54:3] _Twelfth Night_, act iii, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Witch._\r\n\r\n     A sailor's wife had Chestnuts in her lap,\r\n     And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd.\r\n\r\n                                     _Macbeth_, act i, sc. 3 (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Petruchio._\r\n\r\n     And do you tell me of a woman's tongue\r\n     That gives not half so great a blow to hear\r\n     As will a Chestnut in farmer's fire?\r\n\r\n                       _Taming of the Shrew_, act i, sc. 2 (208).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Rosalind._\r\n\r\n     I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\r\n\r\n     _Celia._\r\n\r\n     An excellent colour; your Chestnut was ever the only colour.\r\n\r\n                           _As You Like It_, act iii, sc. 4 (11).\r\n\r\nThis is the Spanish or Sweet Chestnut, a fruit which seems to have been\r\nheld in high esteem in Shakespeare's time, for Lyte, in 1578, says of\r\nit, \"Amongst all kindes of wilde fruites the Chestnut is best and\r\nmeetest for to be eaten.\" The tree cannot be regarded as a true native,\r\nbut it has been so long introduced, probably by the Romans, that grand\r\nspecimens are to be found in all parts of England; the oldest known\r\nspecimen being at Tortworth, in Gloucestershire, which was spoken of as\r\nan old tree in the time of King Stephen; while the tree that is said to\r\nbe the oldest and the largest in Europe is the Spanish Chestnut tree on\r\nMount Etna, the famous Castagni du Centu Cavalli, which measures near\r\nthe root 160 feet in circumference. It is one of our handsomest trees,\r\nand very useful for timber, and at one time it was supposed that many of\r\nour oldest buildings were roofed with Chestnut. This was the current\r\nreport of the grand roof at Westminster Hall, but it is now discovered\r\nto be of Oak, and it is very doubtful whether the Chestnut timber is as\r\nlasting as it has long been supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe Horse Chestnut was probably unknown to Shakespeare. It is an Eastern\r\ntree, and in no way related to the true Chestnut, and though the name\r\nhas probably no connection with horses or their food, yet it is curious\r\nthat the petiole has (especially when dry) a marked resemblance to a\r\nhorse's leg and foot, and that both on the parent stem and the petiole\r\nmay be found a very correct representation of a horseshoe with its\r\nnails.[55:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55:1] For an excellent description of the great differences between the\r\nSpanish and Horse Chestnut, see \"Gardener's Chronicle,\" Oct. 29, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Burgundy._\r\n\r\n     The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\r\n     The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and green Clover.\r\n\r\n                                    _Henry V_, act v, sc. 2 (48).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Tamora._\r\n\r\n     I will enchant the old Andronicus\r\n     With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,\r\n     Than baits to fish, or Honey-stalks to sheep,\r\n     When, as the one is wounded with the bait,\r\n     The other rotted with delicious food.\r\n\r\n                          _Titus Andronicus_, act iv, sc. 4 (89).\r\n\r\n\"Honey-stalks\" are supposed to be the flower of the Clover. This seems\r\nvery probable, but I believe the name is no longer applied. Of the\r\nClover there are two points of interest that are worth notice. The\r\nClover is one of the plants that claim to be the Shamrock of St.\r\nPatrick. This is not a settled point, and at the present day the\r\nWoodsorrel is supposed to have the better claim to the honour. But it is\r\ncertain that the Clover is the \"clubs\" of the pack of cards. \"Clover\" is\r\na corruption of \"Clava,\" a club. In England we paint the Clover on our\r\ncards and call it \"clubs,\" while in France they have the same figure,\r\nbut call it \"trefle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Biron._\r\n\r\n     A Lemon.\r\n\r\n     _Longaville._\r\n\r\n               Stuck with Cloves.\r\n\r\n                _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (633).[56:1]\r\n\r\nAs a mention of a vegetable product, I could not omit this passage, but\r\nthe reference is only to the imported spice and not to the tree from\r\nwhich then, as now, the Clove was gathered.

Who is able to tel his dylygent preaching? which every\r\ndaye and every houre laboreth to sowe Cockel and Darnel\" (Latimer's\r\nFourth Sermon). And to the same effect Spenser--\r\n\r\n     \"And thus of all my harvest-hope I have\r\n        Nought reaped but a weedie crop of care,\r\n      Which when I thought have thresht in swelling sheave,\r\n        Cockle for corn, and chaff for barley bare.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cockle or Campion is said to do mischief among the Wheat, not only,\r\nas the Poppy and other weeds, by occupying room meant for the better\r\nplant, but because the seed gets mixed with the corn, and then \"what\r\nhurt it doth among corne, the spoyle unto bread, as well in colour,\r\ntaste, and unwholsomness is better known than desired.\" So says Gerard,\r\nbut I do not know how far modern experience confirms him. It is a pity\r\nthe plant has so bad a character, for it is a very handsome weed, with a\r\nfine blue flower, and the seeds are very curious objects under the\r\nmicroscope, being described as exactly like a hedgehog rolled up.[58:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57:1] \"Cokylle--quædam aborigo, zazannia.\"--_Catholicon Anglicum._\r\n\r\n[58:1] In Dorsetshire the Cockle is the bur of the Burdock.

As a drug it was imported in\r\nShakespeare's time and long before, but he may also have known the\r\nplant. Gerard seems to have grown it, though from his describing it as a\r\nnative of the sandy shores of the Mediterranean, he perhaps confused it\r\nwith the Squirting Cucumber (_Momordica elaterium_). It is a native of\r\nTurkey, but has been found also in Japan. It is also found in the East,\r\nand we read of it in the history of Elisha: \"One went out into the field\r\nto gather herbs, and found a wild Vine, and gathered thereof wild\r\nGourds, his lap full.\"[59:1] It is not quite certain what species of\r\nGourd is here meant, but all the old commentators considered it to be\r\nthe Colocynth,[59:2] the word \"vine\" meaning any climbing plant, a\r\nmeaning that is still in common use in America.\r\n\r\nAll the tribe of Cucumbers are handsome foliaged plants, but they\r\nrequire room. On the Continent they are much more frequently grown in\r\ngardens than in England, but the hardy perennial Cucumber (_Cucumis\r\nperennis_) makes a very handsome carpet where the space can be spared,\r\nand the Squirting Cucumber (also hardy and perennial) is worth growing\r\nfor its curious fruit.

Among his \"gardyn of sweet floures,\r\nthat dainty odours from them threw around,\" he places--\r\n\r\n     \"Her neck lyke to a bounch of Cullambynes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, still earlier, Skelton (1463-1529) spoke of it with high praise--\r\n\r\n     \"She is the Vyolet,\r\n      The Daysy delectable,\r\n      The Columbine commendable,\r\n      The Ielofer amyable.\"--_Phyllip Sparrow._\r\n\r\nBoth the English and the Latin names are descriptive of the plant.\r\nColumbine, or the Dove-plant, calls our attention to the \"resemblance of\r\nits nectaries to the heads of pigeons in a ring round a dish, a\r\nfavourite device of ancient artists\" (Dr. Prior); or to \"the figure of a\r\nhovering dove with expanded wings, which we obtain by pulling off a\r\nsingle petal with its attached sepals\" (Lady Wilkinson); though it may\r\nalso have had some reference to the colour, as the word is used by\r\nChaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"Come forth now with thin eyghen Columbine.\"\r\n\r\n                                    _The Marchaundes Tale_ (190).\r\n\r\nThe Latin name, _Aquilegia_, is generally supposed to come from\r\n_aquilegus_, a water-collector, alluding to the water-holding powers of\r\nthe flower; it may, however, be derived from _aquila_, an eagle, but\r\nthis seems more doubtful.\r\n\r\nAs a favourite garden flower, the Columbine found its way into heraldic\r\nblazonry. \"It occurs in the crest of the old Barons Grey of Vitten, as\r\nmay be seen in the garter coat of William Grey of Vitten\" (Camden\r\nSociety 1847), and is thus described in the Painter's bill for the\r\nceremonial of the funeral of William Lord Grey of Vitten (MS. Coll. of\r\nArms, i, 13, fol. 35a): \"Item, his creste with the favron, or, sette on\r\na leftehande glove, argent, out thereof issuyinge, caste over threade, a\r\nbraunch of Collobyns, blue, the stalk vert.\" Old Gwillim also enumerates\r\nthe Columbine among his \"Coronary Herbs,\" as follows: \"He beareth\r\nargent, a chevron sable between three Columbines slipped proper, by the\r\nname of Hall of Coventry. The Columbine is pleasing to the eye, as well\r\nin respect of the seemly (and not vulgar) shape as in regard of the\r\nazury colour thereof, and is holden to be very medicinable for the\r\ndissolving of imposthumations or swellings in the throat.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant the Columbine still holds a favourite place. Hardy,\r\nhandsome, and easy of cultivation, it commends itself to the most\r\nornamental as well as to the cottage garden, and there are so many\r\ndifferent sorts (both species and varieties) that all tastes may be\r\nsuited. Of the common species (A. vulgaris) there are double and single,\r\nblue, white, and red; there is the beautiful dwarf A. Pyrenaica, never\r\nexceeding six inches in height, but of a very rich deep blue; there are\r\nthe red and yellow ones (A. Skinneri and A. formosa) from North America;\r\nand, to mention no more, there are the lovely A. cœrulea and the\r\ngrand A. chrysantha from the Rocky Mountains, certainly two of the most\r\ndesirable acquisitions to our hardy flowers that we have had in late\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Rosalind._\r\n\r\n     I prythee take the Cork out of thy mouth, that I may hear thy\r\n       tidings.\r\n\r\n                          _As You Like It_, act iii, sc. 2 (213).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     As you'ld thrust a Cork into a hogshead.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iii, sc. 3 (95).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Cornwall._\r\n\r\n     Bind fast his Corky arms.\r\n\r\n                                _King Lear_, act iii, sc. 7 (28).\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that Shakespeare had no further acquaintance with\r\nthe Cork tree than his use of Corks. The living tree was not introduced\r\ninto England till the latter part of the seventeenth century, yet is\r\nvery fairly described both by Gerard and Parkinson. The Cork, however,\r\nwas largely imported, and was especially used for shoes. Not only did\r\n\"shoemakers put it in shoes and pantofles for warmness sake,\" but for\r\nits lightness it was used for the high-heeled shoes of the fashionable\r\nladies. I suppose from the following lines that these shoes were a\r\ndistinguishing part of a bride's trousseau--\r\n\r\n     \"Strip off my bride's array,\r\n      My Cork-shoes from my feet,\r\n      And, gentle mother, be not coy\r\n      To bring my winding sheet.\"\r\n\r\n                         _The Bride's Burial_--Roxburghe Ballads.\r\n\r\nThe Cork tree is a necessary element in all botanic gardens, but as an\r\nornamental tree it is not sufficiently distinct from the Ilex. Though a\r\nnative of the South of Europe it is hardy in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Gonzalo._\r\n\r\n     No use of metal, Corn, or wine, or oil.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act ii, sc. 1 (154).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Duke._\r\n\r\n     Our Corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.\r\n\r\n                       _Measure for Measure_, act iv, sc. 1 (76).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Playing on pipes of Corn, (67)\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The green Corn\r\n     Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act ii, sc. 1 (94).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _K.

And so at last, when each sense has had its\r\nfill of the flower, and they are thoroughly tired of their play, the\r\nchildren rest from their celebration of the Cowslip. Blessed are such\r\nflowers that appeal to every sense.\" So wrote Dr. Forbes Watson in his\r\nvery pretty and Ruskinesque little work \"Flowers and Gardens,\" and the\r\npassage well expresses one of the chief charms of the Cowslip. It is the\r\nmost favourite wild flower with children. It must have been also a\r\nfavourite with Shakespeare, for his descriptions show that he had\r\nstudied it with affection. The minute description in (6) should be\r\nnoticed. The upright golden Cowslip is compared to one of Queen\r\nElizabeth's Pensioners, who were splendidly dressed, and are frequently\r\nnoticed in the literature of the day. With Mrs. Quickly they were the\r\n_ne plus ultra_ of grandeur--\"And yet there has been earls, nay, which\r\nis more, pensioners\" (\"Merry Wives,\" act ii, sc. 2). Milton, too, sings\r\nin its praise--\r\n\r\n     \"Now the bright morning star, day's harbinger,\r\n      Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her\r\n      The flowering May, who from her green lap throws\r\n      The yellow Cowslip and the pale Primrose.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Song on May Morning._\r\n\r\n     \"Whilst from off the waters fleet,\r\n      Then I set my printless feet\r\n      O'er the Cowslip's velvet head\r\n      That bends not as I tread.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _Sabrina's Song in Comus._\r\n\r\nBut in \"Lycidas\" he associates it with more melancholy ideas--\r\n\r\n     \"With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,\r\n      And every flower that sad embroidery wears.\"\r\n\r\nThis association of sadness with the Cowslip is copied by Mrs. Hemans,\r\nwho speaks of \"Pale Cowslips, meet for maiden's early bier;\" but these\r\nare exceptions. All the other poets who have written of the Cowslip (and\r\nthey are very numerous) tell of its joyousness, and brightness, and\r\ntender beauty, and its \"bland, yet luscious, meadow-breathing scent.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the plant are a puzzle; botanically it is a Primrose, but\r\nit is never so called. It has many names, but its most common are Paigle\r\nand Cowslip. Paigle has never been satisfactorily explained, nor has\r\nCowslip. Our great etymologists, Cockayne and Dr. Prior and Wedgwood,\r\nare all at variance on the name; and Dr. Prior assures us that it has\r\nnothing to do with either \"cows\" or \"lips,\" though the derivation, if\r\nuntrue, is at least as old as Ben Jonson, who speaks of \"Bright\r\nDayes-eyes and the lips of Cowes.\" But we all believe it has, and,\r\nwithout inquiring too closely into the etymology, we connect the flower\r\nwith the rich pastures and meadows of which it forms so pretty a spring\r\nornament, while its fine scent recalls the sweet breath of the\r\ncow--\"just such a sweet, healthy odour is what we find in cows; an odour\r\nwhich breathes around them as they sit at rest on the pasture, and is\r\nbelieved by many, perhaps with truth, to be actually curative of\r\ndisease\" (Forbes Watson).\r\n\r\nBotanically, the Cowslip is a very interesting plant. In all essential\r\npoints the Primrose, Cowslip, and Oxlip are identical; the Primrose,\r\nhowever, choosing woods and copses and the shelter of the hedgerows, the\r\nCowslip choosing the open meadows, while the Oxlip is found in either.\r\nThe garden \"Polyanthus of unnumbered dyes\" (Thomson's \"Seasons:\" Spring)\r\nis only another form produced by cultivation, and is one of the most\r\nfavourite plants in cottage gardens. It may, however, well be grown in\r\ngardens of more pretension; it is neat in growth, handsome in flower, of\r\nendless variety, and easy cultivation. There are also many varieties of\r\nthe Cowslip, of different colours, double and single, which are very\r\nuseful in the spring garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[65:1] Drayton also allotted the Cowslip as the special\r\nFairies' flower--\r\n\r\n          \"For the queene a fitting bower,\r\n     (Quoth he) is that tall Cowslip flower.\"--_Nymphidia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRABS, _see_ APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROCUS, _see_ SAFFRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROW-FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Queen._\r\n\r\n     There with fantastic garlands did she come\r\n     Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daisies, and Long Purples.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 7 (169).\r\n\r\nThe Crow-flower is now the Buttercup,[67:1] but in Shakespeare's time it\r\nwas applied to the Ragged Robin (_Lychnis flos-cuculi_), and I should\r\nthink that this was the flower that poor Ophelia wove into her garland.\r\nGerard says, \"They are not used either in medicine or in nourishment;\r\nbut they serve for garlands and crowns, and to deck up gardens.\" We do\r\nnot now use the Ragged Robin for the decking of our gardens, not that we\r\ndespise it, for it is a flower that all admire in the hedgerows, but\r\nbecause we have other members of the same family as easy to grow and\r\nmore handsome, such as the double variety of the wild plant, L.\r\nChalcedonica, L. Lagascæ, L. fulgens, L. Haagena, &c. In Shakespeare's\r\ntime the name was also given to the Wild Hyacinth, which is so named by\r\nTurner and Lyte; but this could scarcely have been the flower of\r\nOphelia's garland, which was composed of the flowers of early summer,\r\nand not of spring. (See Appendix, p. 388.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67:1] In Scotland the Wild Hyacinth is still called the Crow-flower--\r\n\r\n     \"Sweet the Crow-flower's early bell\r\n      Decks Gleniffer's dewy dell,\r\n      Blooming like thy bonny sel,\r\n      My young, my artless dearie, O.\"\r\n\r\n                                      TANNAHILL, _Gloomy Winter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWN IMPERIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._\r\n\r\n              Bold Oxlips, and\r\n     The Crown Imperial.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (125).\r\n\r\nThe Crown Imperial is a Fritillary (_F. imperialis_). It is a native of\r\nPersia, Afghanistan, and Cashmere, but it was very early introduced into\r\nEngland from Constantinople, and at once became a favourite. Chapman, in\r\n1595, spoke of it as--\r\n\r\n     \"Fair Crown Imperial, Emperor of Flowers.\"\r\n\r\n                                       OVID'S _Banquet of Sense_.\r\n\r\nGerard had it plentifully in his garden, and Parkinson gave it the\r\nforemost place in his \"Paradisus Terrestris.\" \"The Crown Imperial,\" he\r\nsays, \"for its stately beautifulnesse deserveth the first place in this\r\nour garden of delight, to be here entreated of before all other\r\nLillies.\" George Herbert evidently admired it much--\r\n\r\n     \"Then went I to a garden, and did spy\r\n              A gallant flower,\r\n      The Crown Imperial.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    _Peace_ (13).\r\n\r\nAnd if not in Shakespeare's time, yet certainly very soon after, there\r\nwere as many varieties as there are now. The plant, as a florist's\r\nflower, has stood still in a very remarkable way. Though it is\r\napparently a plant that invites the attention of the hybridizing\r\ngardener, yet we still have but the two colours, the red and the yellow\r\n(a pure white would be a great acquisition), with single and double\r\nflowers, flowers in tiers, and with variegated leaves. And all these\r\nvarieties have existed for more than two hundred years.\r\n\r\nAs a stately garden plant it should be in every garden. It flowers\r\nearly, and then dies down. But it should be planted rather in the\r\nbackground, as the whole plant has an evil smell, especially in\r\nsunshine. Yet it should have a close attention, if only to study and\r\nadmire the beautiful interior of the flower. I know of no other flower\r\nthat is similarly formed, and it cannot be better described than in\r\nGerard's words: \"In the bottome of each of the bells there is placed six\r\ndrops of most cleere shining sweet water, in taste like sugar,\r\nresembling in shew faire Orient pearles, the which drops if you take\r\naway, there do immediately appeare the like; notwithstanding, if they\r\nmay be suffered to stand still in the floure according to his owne\r\nnature, they wil never fall away, no, not if you strike the plant untill\r\nit be broken.\" How these drops are formed, and what service they perform\r\nin the economy of the flower, has not been explained, as far as I am\r\naware; but there is a pretty German legend which tells how the flower\r\nwas originally white and erect, and grew in its full beauty in the\r\ngarden of Gethsemane, where it was often noticed and admired by our\r\nLord; but in the night of the agony, as our Lord passed through the\r\ngarden, all the other flowers bowed their head in sorrowful adoration,\r\nthe Crown Imperial alone remaining with its head unbowed, but not for\r\nlong--sorrow and shame took the place of pride, she bent her proud[69:1]\r\nhead, and blushes of shame, and tears of sorrow soon followed, and so\r\nshe has ever continued, with bent head, blushing colour, and\r\never-flowing tears. It is a pretty legend, and may be found at full\r\nlength in \"Good Words for the Young,\" August, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69:1] The bent head of the Crown Imperial could not well escape\r\nnotice--\r\n\r\n     \"The Polyanthus, and with prudent head,\r\n      The Crown Imperial, ever bent on earth,\r\n      Favouring her secret rites, and pearly sweets.\"--FORSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCKOO-BUDS AND FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Song of Spring._\r\n\r\n     When Daisies pied, and Violets blue,\r\n       And Lady-smocks all silver-white,\r\n     And Cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,\r\n       Do paint the meadows with delight.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (904).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Cordelia._\r\n\r\n                    He was met even now\r\n     As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;\r\n     Crown'd with rank Fumiter and Furrow-weeds,\r\n     With Burdocks, Hemlock, Nettles, Cuckoo-flowers,\r\n     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\r\n     In our sustaining Corn.\r\n\r\n                                  _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 4 (1).\r\n\r\nThere is a difficulty in deciding what flower Shakespeare meant by\r\nCuckoo-buds. We now always give the name to the Meadow Cress (_Cardamine\r\npratensis_), but it cannot be that in either of these passages, because\r\nthat flower is mentioned under its other name of Lady-smocks in the\r\nprevious line (No. 1), nor is it \"of yellow hue;\" nor does it grow among\r\nCorn, as described in No. 2. Many plants have been suggested, and the\r\nchoice seems to me to lie between two. Mr. Swinfen Jervis[70:1] decides\r\nwithout hesitation in favour of Cowslips, and the yellow hue painting\r\nthe meadows in spring time gives much force to the decision; Schmidt\r\ngives the same interpretation; but I think the Buttercup, as suggested\r\nby Dr. Prior, will still better meet the requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70:1] \"Dictionary of the Language of Shakespeare,\" 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUPID'S FLOWER, _see_ PANSIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     What am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast?

The Currants--black, white, and\r\nred--are natives of the northern parts of Europe, and are probably wild\r\nin Britain. They do not seem to have been much grown as garden fruit\r\ntill the early part of the sixteenth century, and are not mentioned by\r\nthe earlier writers; but that they were known in Shakespeare's time we\r\nhave the authority of Gerard, who, speaking of Gooseberries, says: \"We\r\nhave also in our London gardens another sort altogether without prickes,\r\nwhose fruit is very small, lesser by muche than the common kinde, but of\r\na perfect red colour.\" This \"perfect red colour\" explains the \"currant\r\nlip\" of No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYME, _see_ SENNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPRESS.[71:1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Suffolk._\r\n\r\n     Their sweetest shade, a grove of Cypress trees!\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 2 (322).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Aufidius._\r\n\r\n     I am attended at the Cypress grove.\r\n\r\n                                 _Coriolanus_, act i, sc. 10 (30).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Gremio._\r\n\r\n     In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns,\r\n     In Cypress chests my arras counterpoints.\r\n\r\n                      _Taming of the Shrew_, act ii, sc. 1 (351).\r\n\r\nThe Cypress (_Cupressus sempervirens_), originally a native of Mount\r\nTaurus, is found abundantly through all the South of Europe, and is said\r\nto derive its name from the Island of Cyprus. It was introduced into\r\nEngland many years before Shakespeare's time, but is always associated\r\nin the old authors with funerals and churchyards; so that Spenser calls\r\nit the \"Cypress funereal,\" which epithet he may have taken from Pliny's\r\ndescription of the Cypress: \"Natu morosa, fructu supervacua, baccis\r\ntorva, foliis amara, odore violenta, ac ne umbrâ quidem gratiosa--Diti\r\nsacra, et ideo funebri signo ad domos posita\" (\"Nat. Hist.,\" xvi. 32).\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville mentions the Cypress in a very curious way: \"The\r\nCristene men, that dwellen beyond the See, in Grece, seyn that the tree\r\nof the Cros, that we callen Cypresse, was of that tree that Adam ete the\r\nAppule of; and that fynde thei writen\" (\"Voiage,\" &c., cap. 2). And the\r\nold poem of the \"Squyr of lowe degre,\" gives the tree a sacred\r\npre-eminence--\r\n\r\n     \"The tre it was of Cypresse,\r\n      The fyrst tre that Iesu chese.\"\r\n\r\n                  RITSON'S _Ear. Eng. Met. Romances_, viii. (31).\r\n\r\n\"In the Arundel MS. 42 may be found an alphabet of plants. . . . The\r\nauthor mentions his garden 'by Stebenhythe by syde London,' and relates\r\nthat he brought a bough of Cypress with its Apples from Bristol 'into\r\nEstbritzlond,' fresh in September, to show that it might be propagated\r\nby slips.\"--_Promptorium Parvulorum_, app. 67.\r\n\r\nThe Cypress is an ornamental evergreen, but stiff in its growth till it\r\nbecomes of a good age; and for garden purposes the European plant is\r\nbecoming replaced by the richer forms from Asia and North America, such\r\nas C. Lawsoniana, macrocarpa, Lambertiana, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71:1] Cypress, or Cyprus (for the word is spelt differently in the\r\ndifferent editions), is also mentioned by Shakespeare in the following--\r\n\r\n     (1) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     In sad Cypress let me be laid.\r\n\r\n                                  _Twelfth Night_, act ii, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Olivia._\r\n\r\n            To one of your receiving\r\n     Enough is shown; and Cyprus, not a bosom,\r\n     Hides my poor heart.\r\n\r\n                                         _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Autolycus._\r\n\r\n     Lawn as white as driven snow,\r\n     Cyprus, black as e'er was crow.\r\n\r\n                                  _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3.\r\n\r\nBut in all these cases the Cypress is not the name of the plant, but is\r\nthe fabric which we now call crape, the \"sable stole of Cypre's lawn\" of\r\nMilton's \"Penseroso.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAFFODILS.[73:1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Autolycus._\r\n\r\n     When Daffodils begin to peer,\r\n       With heigh! the doxy o'er the dale,\r\n     Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year.\r\n\r\n                              _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n                         Daffodils\r\n     That come before the swallow dares, and take\r\n     The winds of March with beauty.\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 4 (118).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Wooer._\r\n\r\n     With chaplets on their heads of Daffodillies.\r\n\r\n                         _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1 (94).\r\n\r\n_See also_ NARCISSUS, p. 175.\r\n\r\nOf all English plants there have been none in such constant favour as\r\nthe Daffodil, whether known by its classical name of Narcissus, or by\r\nits more popular names of Daffodil, or Daffadowndilly, and Jonquil. The\r\nname of Narcissus it gets from being supposed to be the same as the\r\nplant so named by the Greeks first and the Romans afterwards. It is a\r\nquestion whether the plants are the same, and I believe most authors\r\nthink they are not; but I have never been able to see very good reasons\r\nfor their doubts. The name Jonquil comes corrupted through the French,\r\nfrom _juncifolius_ or \"rush-leaf,\" and is properly restricted to those\r\nspecies of the family which have rushy leaves. \"Daffodil\" is commonly\r\nsaid to be a corruption of Asphodel (\"Daffodil is Ασφοδελον, and has\r\ncapped itself with a letter which eight hundred years ago did not belong\r\nto it.\"--COCKAYNE, _Spoon and Sparrow_, 19), with which plant it was\r\nconfused (as it is in Lyte's \"Herbal\"), but Lady Wilkinson says very\r\npositively that \"it is simply the old English word 'affodyle,'[73:2]\r\nwhich signifies 'that which cometh early.'\" \"Daffadowndilly,\" again is\r\nsupposed to be but a playful corruption of \"Daffodil,\" but Dr. Prior\r\nargues (and he is a very safe authority) that it is rather a corruption\r\nof \"Saffron Lily.\" Daffadowndilly is not used by Shakespeare, but it is\r\nused by his contemporaries, as by Spenser frequently, and by H.\r\nConstable, who died in 1604--\r\n\r\n     \"Diaphenia, like the Daffadowndilly,\r\n      White as the sun, fair as the Lilly,\r\n          Heigh, ho! how I do love thee!\"\r\n\r\nBut however it derived its pretty names, it was the favourite flower of\r\nour ancestors as a garden flower, and especially as the flower for\r\nmaking garlands, a custom very much more common then than it is now. It\r\nwas the favourite of all English poets. Gower describes the Narcissus--\r\n\r\n     \"For in the winter fresh and faire\r\n      The flowres ben, which is contraire\r\n      To kind, and so was the folie\r\n      Which fell of his surquedrie\"--_i.e._, of Narcissus.\r\n\r\n                      _Confes. Aman._ lib. prim. (1. 121 Paulli).\r\n\r\nShakespeare must have had a special affection for it, for in all his\r\ndescriptions there is none prettier or more suggestive than Perdita's\r\nshort but charming description of the Daffodil (No. 2). A small volume\r\nmight be filled with the many poetical descriptions of this \"delectable\r\nand sweet-smelling flower,\" but there are some which are almost\r\nclassical, and which can never be omitted, and which will bear\r\nrepetition, however well we know them. Milton says, \"The Daffodillies\r\nfill their cups with tears.\"[74:1] There are Herrick's well-known\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n     \"Fair Daffodils, we weep to see\r\n      You haste away so soon,\r\n        As yet the early-rising sun\r\n      Has not attained his noon;\r\n                  Stay, stay,\r\n      Until the hastening day\r\n                  Has run\r\n      But to the even-song;\r\n      And having prayed together, we\r\n        Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n      We have short time to stay as you,\r\n        We have as short a spring,\r\n      As quick a growth to meet decay,\r\n        As you or anything.\r\n                  We die,\r\n      As your hours do, and dry\r\n                  Away,\r\n      Like to the summer's rain,\r\n        Or as the pearls of morning dew,\r\n      Ne'er to be found again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there are Keats' and Shelley's well-known and beautiful lines which\r\nbring down the praises of the Daffodil to our own day. Keats says--\r\n\r\n     \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,\r\n      Its loveliness increases, it will never\r\n      Pass into nothingness.  .  .  .  .  .\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  In spite of all\r\n      Some shape of beauty moves away the pale\r\n      From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\r\n      Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\r\n      For simple sheep; and such are Daffodils\r\n      With the green world they live in.\"\r\n\r\nShelley is still warmer in his praise--\r\n\r\n     \"Narcissus, the fairest among them all,\r\n      Who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess,\r\n      Till they die of their own dear loveliness.\"\r\n\r\n                                     _The Sensitive Plant_, p. 1.\r\n\r\nNor must Wordsworth be left out when speaking of the poetry of\r\nDaffodils. His stanzas are well known, while his sister's prose\r\ndescription of them is the most poetical of all: \"They grew among the\r\nmossy stones; . . . some rested their heads on these stones as on a\r\npillow, the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they\r\nverily laughed with the wind, they looked so gay and glancing.\"[76:1]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to come to prose. The Daffodil of Shakespeare is the Wild\r\nDaffodil (_Narcissus pseudo-Narcissus_) that is found in abundance in\r\nmany parts of England. This is the true English Daffodil, and there is\r\nonly one other species that is truly native--the N. biflorus, chiefly\r\nfound in Devonshire. But long before Shakespeare's time a vast number\r\nhad been introduced from different parts of Europe, so that Gerard was\r\nable to describe twenty-four different species, and had \"them all and\r\nevery of them in our London gardens in great abundance.\" The family, as\r\nat present arranged by Mr. J. G. Baker, of the Kew Herbarium, consists\r\nof twenty-one species, with several sub-species and varieties; all of\r\nwhich should be grown. They are all, with the exception of the Algerian\r\nspecies, which almost defy cultivation in England, most easy of\r\ncultivation--\"Magnâ curâ non indigent Narcissi.\" They only require after\r\nthe first planting to be let alone, and then they will give us their\r\ngraceful flowers in varied beauty from February to May. The first will\r\nusually be the grand N. maximus, which may be called the King of\r\nDaffodils, though some authors have given to it a still more illustrious\r\nname. The \"Rose of Sharon\" was the large yellow Narcissus, common in\r\nPalestine and the East generally, of which Mahomet said: \"He that has\r\ntwo cakes of bread, let him sell one of them for some flower of the\r\nNarcissus, for bread is the food of the body, but Narcissus is the food\r\nof the soul.\" From these grand leaders of the tribe we shall be led\r\nthrough the Hoop-petticoats, the many-flowered Tazettas, and the sweet\r\nJonquils, till we end the Narcissus season with the Poets' Narcissus\r\n(Ben Jonson's \"chequ'd and purple-ringed Daffodilly\"), certainly one of\r\nthe most graceful flowers that grows, and of a peculiar fragrance that\r\nno other flower has; so beautiful is it, that even Dr. Forbes Watson's\r\ndescription of it is scarcely too glowing: \"In its general expression\r\nthe Poets' Narcissus seems a type of maiden purity and beauty, yet\r\nwarmed by a love-breathing fragrance; and yet what innocence in the\r\nlarge soft eye, which few can rival amongst the whole tribe of flowers.\r\nThe narrow, yet vivid fringe of red, so clearly seen amidst the\r\nwhiteness, suggests again the idea of purity, gushing passion--purity\r\nwith a heart which can kindle into fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73:1] This account of the Daffodil, and the accounts of some other\r\nflowers, I have taken from a paper by myself on the common English names\r\nof plants read to the Bath Field Club in 1870, and published in the\r\n\"Transactions\" of the Club, and afterwards privately printed.--H.

But in\r\nShakespeare's time Darnel, like Cockle (which see), was the general name\r\nfor any hurtful weed. In the old translation of the Bible, the Zizania,\r\nwhich is now translated Tares, was sometime translated Cockle,[78:1] and\r\nNewton, writing in Shakespeare's time, says--\"Under the name of Cockle\r\nand Darnel is comprehended all vicious, noisom and unprofitable graine,\r\nencombring and hindring good corne.\"--_Herball to the Bible._ The Darnel\r\nis not only injurious from choking the corn, but its seeds become mixed\r\nwith the true Wheat, and so in Dorsetshire--and perhaps in other\r\nparts--it has the name of \"Cheat\" (Barnes' Glossary), from its false\r\nlikeness to Wheat. It was this false likeness that got for it its bad\r\ncharacter. \"Darnell or Juray,\" says Lyte (\"Herball,\" 1578), \"is a\r\nvitious graine that combereth or anoyeth corne, especially Wheat, and in\r\nhis knotten straw, blades, or leaves is like unto Wheate.\" Yet Lindley\r\nsays that \"the noxious qualities of Darnel or Lolium temulentum seem to\r\nrest upon no certain proof\" (\"Vegetable Kingdom,\" p. 116).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78:1] \"When men were a sleepe, his enemy came and oversowed Cockle\r\namong the wheate, and went his way.\"--_Rheims Trans._, 1582.

The Date Palm grows over\r\nthe whole of Southern Europe, North Africa, and South-eastern Asia; but\r\nit is not probable that Shakespeare ever saw the tree, though Neckam\r\nspeaks of it in the twelfth century, and Lyte describes it, and Gerard\r\nmade many efforts to grow it; he tried to grow plants from the seed,\r\n\"the which I have planted many times in my garden, and have grown to the\r\nheight of three foot, but the first frost hath nipped them in such sort\r\nthat they perished, notwithstanding mine industrie by covering them, or\r\nwhat else I could do for their succour.\" The fruit, however, was\r\nimported into England in very early times, and was called by the\r\nAnglo-Saxons Finger-Apples, a curious name, but easily explained as the\r\ntranslation of the Greek name for the fruit, δακτυλοι which was also the\r\norigin of the word date, of which the olden form was dactylle.[80:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[80:1] \"A dactylle frute dactilis.\"--_Catholicon Anglicum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD MEN'S FINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Queen._\r\n\r\n     Our cold maids do Dead Men's Fingers call them.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 7 (172).\r\n\r\n_See_ LONG PURPLES, p. 148.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEWBERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Feed him with Apricocks and Dewberries.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 1 (169).\r\n\r\nThe Dewberry (_Rubus cæsius_) is a handsome fruit, very like the\r\nBlackberry, but coming earlier. It has a peculiar sub-acid flavour,\r\nwhich is much admired by some, as it must have been by Titania, who\r\njoins it with such fruits as Apricots, Grapes, Figs, and Mulberries. It\r\nmay be readily distinguished from the Blackberry by the fruit being\r\ncomposed of a few larger drupes, and being covered with a glaucous\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAN'S BUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Oberon._\r\n\r\n     Be, as thou wast wont to be\r\n                   (touching her eyes with an herb),\r\n     See, as thou wast wont to see;\r\n     Dian's Bud o'er Cupid's flower\r\n     Hath such force and blessed power.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (76).\r\n\r\nThe same herb is mentioned in act iii, sc. 2 (366)--\r\n\r\n     Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye,\r\n     Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,\r\n     To take from thence all error, with his might,\r\n     And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.\r\n\r\nBut except in these two passages I believe the herb is not mentioned by\r\nany author. It can be nothing but Shakespeare's translation of\r\nArtemisia, the herb of Artemis or Diana, a herb of wonderful virtue\r\naccording to the writers before Shakespeare's day.

An old name for the plant was \"Patience;\" the \"bitter\r\npatience\" of Spenser, which is supposed by Dr. Prior to be a corruption\r\nof Passions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Dramatis personæ_ in _Much Ado About Nothing._)\r\n\r\nThe Dogberry is the fruit either of the Cornus sanguinea or of the\r\nEuonymus Europæus. Parkinson limits the name to the Cornus, and says:\r\n\"We for the most part call it the _Dogge berry tree_, because the\r\nberries are not fit to be eaten, or to be given to a dogge.\" The plant\r\nis only named by Shakespeare as a man's name, but it could scarcely be\r\nomitted, as I agree with Mr. Milner that it was \"probable that our\r\ndramatist had the tree in his mind when he gave a name to that fine\r\nfellow for a 'sixth and lastly,' Constable, Dogberry of the Watch\"\r\n(\"Country Pleasures,\" p. 229).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEBONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _King._\r\n\r\n     The Ebon-coloured ink.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act i, sc. 1 (245).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _King._\r\n\r\n     By heaven, thy love is black as Ebony.\r\n\r\n     _Biron._\r\n\r\n     Is Ebony like her?

The\r\ntimber is the produce of more than one species, but comes chiefly from\r\nDiospyros Ebenum, Ebenaster, Melanoxylon, Mabola, &c. (Lindley), all\r\nnatives of the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGLANTINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Oberon._\r\n\r\n     I know a bank where the wild Thyme blows,\r\n     Where Oxlips and the nodding Violet grows;\r\n     Quite over-canopied with luscious Woodbine,\r\n     With sweet Musk-Roses and with Eglantine.\r\n\r\n                  _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act ii, sc. 1 (249).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n                           Thou shalt not lack\r\n     The flower that's like thy face, pale Primrose, nor\r\n     The azured Harebell, like thy veins, no, nor\r\n     The leaf of Eglantine, whom not to slander,\r\n     Out-sweeten'd not thy breath.\r\n\r\n                                _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (220).\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare had only written these two passages they would\r\nsufficiently have told of his love for simple flowers. None but a dear\r\nlover of such flowers could have written these lines. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the Eglantine in his time was the Sweet Brier--his notice of\r\nthe sweet leaf makes this certain. Gerard so calls it, but makes some\r\nconfusion--which it is not easy to explain--by saying that the flowers\r\nare white, whereas the flowers of the true Sweet Brier are pink. In the\r\nearlier poets the name seems to have been given to any wild Rose, and\r\nMilton certainly did not consider the Eglantine and the Sweet Brier to\r\nbe identical. He says (\"L'Allegro\")--\r\n\r\n     \"Through the Sweet Briar or the Vine,\r\n        Or the twisted Eglantine.\"\r\n\r\nBut Milton's knowledge of flowers was very limited. Herrick has some\r\npretty lines on the flower, in which it seems most probable that he was\r\nreferring to the Sweet Brier--\r\n\r\n     \"From this bleeding hand of mine\r\n      Take this sprig of Eglantine,\r\n      Which, though sweet unto your smell,\r\n      Yet the fretful Briar will tell,\r\n      He who plucks the sweets shall prove\r\n      Many Thorns to be in love.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus the emblem of pleasure mixed with pain--\r\n\r\n     \"Sweet is the Eglantine, but pricketh nere.\"\r\n\r\n                                          SPENSER, _Sonnet_ xxvi.\r\n\r\nAnd so its names pronounced it to be; it was either the Sweet Brier, or\r\nit was Eglantine, the thorny plant (Fr., _aiglentier_). There was also\r\nan older name for the plant, of which I can give no explanation. It was\r\ncalled Bedagar. \"Bedagar dicitur gallice aiglentier\" (John de\r\nGerlande). \"_Bedagrage_, spina alba, wit-thorn\" (Harl. MS., No. 978 in\r\n\"Reliquiæ Antiquæ,\" i, 36).[84:1] The name still exists, though not in\r\ncommon use; but only as the name of a drug made from \"the excrescences\r\non the branches of the Rose, and particularly on those of the wild\r\nvarieties\" (Parsons on the Rose).\r\n\r\nIt is a native of Britain, but not very common, being chiefly confined\r\nto the South of England. I have found it on Maidenhead Thicket. As a\r\ngarden plant it is desirable for the extremely delicate scent of its\r\nleaves, but the flower is not equal to others of the family. There is,\r\nhowever, a double-flowered variety, which is handsome. The fruit of the\r\nsingle flowered tree is large, and of a deep red colour, and is said to\r\nbe sometimes made into a preserve. In modern times this is seldom done,\r\nbut it may have been common in Shakespeare's time, for Gerard says\r\nquaintly: \"The fruit when it is ripe maketh most pleasant meats and\r\nbanqueting dishes, as tarts and such like, the making whereof I commit\r\nto the cunning cooke, and teeth to eat them in the rich man's mouth.\"\r\nAnd Drayton says--\r\n\r\n     \"They'll fetch you conserve from the hip,\r\n      And lay it softly on your lip.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    _Nymphal II._\r\n\r\nEglantine has a further interest in being one of the many thorny trees\r\nfrom which the sacred crown of thorns was supposed to be made--\"And\r\nafterwards he was led into a garden of Cayphas, and there he was crowned\r\nwith Eglantine\" (Sir John Mandeville).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84:1] \"Est et cynosrodos, rosa camina, ung eglantier, folia myrti\r\nhabens, sed paulo majora; recta assurgens in mediam altitudinem inter\r\narborem et fruticem; fert spongiolas, quibus utuntur medici, ad malefica\r\ncapitis ulcera, la malle tigne, vocatur antem vulgo in officinis\r\npharmacopolarum, bedegar.\"--_Stephani de re Hortensi Libellus_, p. 17,\r\n1536.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n     And let the stinking Elder, grief, untwine\r\n     His perishing root with the increasing Vine!\r\n\r\n                                 _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (59).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Host._\r\n\r\n     What says my Æsculapius? my Galen? my heart of Elder?\r\n\r\n                               _Merry Wives_, act ii, sc. 3 (29).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Saturninus._\r\n\r\n               Look for thy reward\r\n     Among the Nettles at the Elder tree,\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     This is the pit and this the Elder tree.\r\n\r\n                         _Titus Andronicus_, act ii, sc. 3 (271).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Williams._\r\n\r\n     That's a perilous shot out of an Elder gun, that a poor and\r\n       private displeasure can do against a monarch.\r\n\r\n                                  _Henry V_, act iv, sc. 1 (200).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Holofernes._\r\n\r\n     Begin, sir, you are my Elder.\r\n\r\n     _Biron._\r\n\r\n     Well followed; Judas was hanged on an Elder.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (608).\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no tree round which so much of contradictory\r\nfolk-lore has gathered as the Elder tree.[85:1] With many it was simply\r\n\"the stinking Elder,\" of which nothing but evil could be spoken. Biron\r\n(No. 5) only spoke the common mediæval notion that \"Judas was hanged on\r\nan Elder;\" and so firm was this belief that Sir John Mandeville was\r\nshown the identical tree at Jerusalem, \"and faste by is zit, the Tree of\r\nEldre that Judas henge himself upon, for despeyr that he hadde, when he\r\nsolde and betrayed oure Lord.\" This was enough to give the tree a bad\r\nfame, which other things helped to confirm--the evil smell of its\r\nleaves, the heavy narcotic smell of its flowers, its hard and heartless\r\nwood,[85:2] and the ugly drooping black fungus that is almost\r\nexclusively found on it (though it occurs also on the Elm), which was\r\nvulgarly called the Ear of Judas (_Hirneola auricula Judæ_). This was\r\nthe bad character; but, on the other hand, there were many who could\r\ntell of its many virtues, so that in 1644 appeared a book entirely\r\ndevoted to its praises. This was \"The Anatomie of the Elder, translated\r\nfrom the Latin of Dr. Martin Blockwich by C. de Iryngio\" (_i.e._,\r\nChrist. Irvine), a book that, in its Latin and English form, went\r\nthrough several editions. And this favourable estimate of the tree is\r\nstill very common in several parts of the Continent. In the South of\r\nGermany it is believed to drive away evil spirits, and the name\r\n\"'Holderstock' (Elder Stock) is a term of endearment given by a lover to\r\nhis beloved, and is connected with Hulda, the old goddess of love, to\r\nwhom the Elder tree was considered sacred.\" In Denmark and Norway it is\r\nheld in like esteem, and in the Tyrol an \"Elder bush, trained into the\r\nform of a cross, is planted on the new-made grave, and if it blossoms\r\nthe soul of the person lying beneath it is happy.\" And this use of the\r\nElder for funeral purposes was, perhaps, also an old English custom; for\r\nSpenser, speaking of Death, says--\r\n\r\n     \"The Muses that were wont greene Baies to weare,\r\n      Now bringen bittre Eldre braunches seare.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _Shepherd's Calendar--November._\r\n\r\nNor must we pass by the high value that was placed on the wood both by\r\nthe Jews and Greeks. It was the wood chiefly used for musical\r\ninstruments, so that the name Sambuke was applied to several very\r\ndifferent instruments, from the fact that they were all made of Elder\r\nwood. The \"sackbut,\" \"dulcimer,\" and \"pipe\" of Daniel iii. are all\r\nconnected together in this manner.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant the common Elder is not admissible, though it forms a\r\nstriking ornament in the wild hedgerows and copses, while its flowers\r\nyield the highly perfumed Elder-flower water, and its fruits give the\r\nElder wine; but the tree runs into many varieties, several of which are\r\nvery ornamental, the leaves being often very finely divided and jagged,\r\nand variegated both with golden and silver blotches. There is a handsome\r\nspecies from Canada (Sambucus Canadensis), which is worth growing in\r\nshrubberies, as it produces its pure white flowers in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85:1] Called also Eldern in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nand still earlier, Eller or Ellyr (\"Catholicon Anglicum\"). \"The Ellern\r\nis a tree with long bowes, ful sounde and sad wythout, and ful holowe\r\nwithin, and ful of certayne nesshe pyth.\"--_Clanvil de prop._\r\n\r\n[85:2] From the facility with which the hard wood can be hollowed out,\r\nthe tree was from very ancient times called the Bore-tree.

Yet Shakespeare does not stand\r\nalone in thus speaking of the Elm in its connection with the Vine.\r\nSpenser speaks of \"the Vine-prop Elme,\" and Milton--\r\n\r\n                       \"They led the Vine\r\n     To wed her Elm; she spoused, about him twines\r\n     Her marriageable arms, and with her brings\r\n     Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\r\n     His barren leaves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Browne--\r\n\r\n                       \"She, whose inclination\r\n     Bent all her course to him-wards, let him know\r\n     He was the Elm, whereby her Vine did grow.\"\r\n\r\n                         _Britannia's Pastorals_, book i, song 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"An Elm embraced by a Vine,\r\n     Clipping so strictly that they seemed to be\r\n     One in their growth, one shade, one fruit, one tree;\r\n     Her boughs his arms; his leaves so mixed with hers,\r\n     That with no wind he moved, but straight she stirs.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  _Ibid._, ii, 4.\r\n\r\nBut I should think that neither Shakespeare, nor Browne, nor Milton ever\r\nsaw an English Vine trained to an Elm; they were simply copying from the\r\nclassical writers.\r\n\r\nThe Wych Elm is probably a true native, but the more common Elm of our\r\nhedgerows is a tree of Southern Europe and North Africa, and is of such\r\nmodern introduction into England that in Evelyn's time it was rarely\r\nseen north of Stamford. It was probably introduced into Southern England\r\nby the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87:1] Why Falstaff should be called a dead Elm is not very apparent;\r\nbut the Elm was associated with death as producing the wood for coffins.\r\nThus Chaucer speaks of it as \"the piler Elme, the cofre unto careyne,\"\r\n_i.e._, carrion (\"Parliament of Fowles,\" 177).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERINGOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Let the sky rain Potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green\r\n       Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits, and snow Eringoes.\r\n\r\n                                _Merry Wives_, act v, sc. 5 (20).\r\n\r\nGerard tells us that Eringoes are the candied roots of the Sea Holly\r\n(_Eryngium maritimum_), and he gives the recipe for candying them. I am\r\nnot aware that the Sea Holly is ever now so used, but it is a very\r\nhandsome plant as it is seen growing on the sea shore, and its fine\r\nfoliage makes it an ornamental plant for a garden. But as used by\r\nFalstaff I am inclined to think that the vegetable he wished for was the\r\nGlobe Artichoke, which is a near ally of the Eryngium, was a favourite\r\ndiet in Shakespeare's time, and was reputed to have certain special\r\nvirtues which are not attributed to the Sea Holly, but which would more\r\naccord with Falstaff's character.[88:1] I cannot, however, anywhere find\r\nthat the Artichoke was called Eringoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88:1] For these supposed virtues of the Artichoke see Bullein's \"Book\r\nof Simples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ophelia._\r\n\r\n     There's Fennel for you and Columbines.\r\n\r\n                                    _Hamlet_, act iv, sc 5 (189).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     And a' plays at quoits well, and eats conger and Fennel.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (266).\r\n\r\nThe Fennel was always a plant of high reputation. The Plain of Marathon\r\nwas so named from the abundance of Fennel (μαραθρον) growing on\r\nit.[89:1] And like all strongly scented plants, it was supposed by the\r\nmedical writers to abound in \"virtues.\" Gower, describing the star\r\nPleiades, says--\r\n\r\n     \"Eke his herbe in speciall\r\n      The vertuous Fenel it is.\"\r\n\r\n                      _Conf. Aman._, lib. sept. (3, 129. Paulli.)\r\n\r\nThese virtues cannot be told more pleasantly than by Longfellow--\r\n\r\n     \"Above the lowly plants it towers,\r\n      The Fennel with its yellow flowers,\r\n      And in an earlier age than ours\r\n      Was gifted with the wondrous powers--\r\n          Lost vision to restore.\r\n      It gave men strength and fearless mood,\r\n      And gladiators fierce and rude\r\n      Mingled it with their daily food:\r\n      And he who battled and subdued\r\n          A wreath of Fennel wore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet the virtues of Fennel, as thus enumerated by Longfellow, do not\r\ncomprise either of those attributes of the plant which illustrate the\r\ntwo passages from Shakespeare. The first alludes to it as an emblem of\r\nflattery, for which ample authority has been found by the\r\ncommentators.[89:2] Florio is quoted for the phrase 'Dare finocchio,'\r\n_to give fennel_, as meaning _to flatter_. In the second quotation the\r\nallusion is to the reputation of Fennel as an inflammatory herb with\r\nmuch the same virtues as are attributed to Eringoes.\"--Mr. J. F. MARSH\r\nin _The Garden_.\r\n\r\nThe English name was directly derived from its Latin name\r\n_Fœniculum_, which may have been given it from its hay-like smell\r\n(_fœnum_), but this is not certain. We have another English word\r\nderived from the Giant Fennel of the South of Europe (_ferula_); this is\r\nthe ferule, an instrument of punishment for small boys, also adopted\r\nfrom the Latin, the Roman schoolmaster using the stalks of the Fennel\r\nfor the same purpose as the modern schoolmaster uses the cane.\r\n\r\nThe early poets looked on the Fennel as an emblem of the early summer--\r\n\r\n     \"Hyt befell yn the month of June\r\n      When the Fenell hangeth yn toun.\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Libæus Diaconus._(1225).\r\n\r\nAs a useful plant, the chief use is as a garnishing and sauce for fish.\r\nLarge quantities of the seed are said to be imported to flavour gin, but\r\nthis can scarcely be called useful. As ornamental plants, the large\r\nFennels (F. Tingitana, F. campestris, F. glauca, &c.) are very desirable\r\nwhere they can have the necessary room.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89:1] \"Fennelle or Fenkelle, feniculum maratrum.\"--_Catholicon\r\nAnglicum._\r\n\r\n[89:2]\r\n\r\n     \"_Christophers._\r\n\r\n      No, my _good lord_.\r\n\r\n      _Count._\r\n\r\n      Your _good lord_!

Now-a-days it is the fashion to admire Ferns, and few\r\nwould be found bold enough to profess an indifference to them. But it\r\nwas not always so. Theocritus seems to have admired the Fern--\r\n\r\n     \"Like Fern my tresses o'er my temples streamed.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _Idyll_ xx. (_Calverley._)\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Come here and trample dainty Fern and Poppy blossom.\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Idyll_ v. (_Calverley._)\r\n\r\nBut Virgil gives it a bad character, speaking of it as \"filicem\r\ninvisam.\" Horace is still more severe, \"neglectis urenda filix\r\ninnascitur agris.\" The Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius spoke\r\ncontemptuously of the \"Thorns, and the Furzes, and the Fern, and all the\r\nweeds\" (Cockayne). And so it was in Shakespeare's time. Butler spoke of\r\nit as the--\r\n\r\n     \"Fern, that vile, unuseful weed,\r\n      That grows equivocably without seed.\"\r\n\r\nCowley spoke the opinion of his day as if the plant had neither use nor\r\nbeauty--\r\n\r\n     \"Nec caulem natura mihi, nec Floris honorem,\r\n        Nec mihi vel semen dura Noverca dedit--\r\n      Nec me sole fovet, nec cultis crescere in hortis\r\n        Concessum, et Foliis gratia nulla meis--\r\n      Herba invisa Deis poteram cœloque videri,\r\n        Et spurio Terræ nata puerperio.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _Plantarum_, lib. i.\r\n\r\nAnd later still Gilpin, who wrote so much on the beauties of country\r\nscenery at the close of the last century, has nothing better to say for\r\nFerns than that they are noxious weeds, to be classed with \"Thorns and\r\nBriers, and other ditch trumpery.\" The fact, no doubt, is that Ferns\r\nwere considered something \"uncanny and eerie;\" our ancestors could not\r\nunderstand a plant which seemed to them to have neither flower nor seed,\r\nand so they boldly asserted it had neither. \"This kinde of Ferne,\" says\r\nLyte in 1587, \"beareth neither flowers nor sede, except we shall take\r\nfor sede the black spots growing on the backsides of the leaves, the\r\nwhiche some do gather thinking to worke wonders, but to say the trueth\r\nit is nothing els but trumperie and superstition.\" A plant so strange\r\nmust needs have strange qualities, but the peculiar power attributed to\r\nit of making persons invisible arose thus:--It was the age in which the\r\ndoctrine of signatures was fully believed in; according to which\r\ndoctrine Nature, in giving particular shapes to leaves and flowers, had\r\nthereby plainly taught for what diseases they were specially\r\nuseful.[91:1] Thus a heart-shaped leaf was for heart disease, a\r\nliver-shaped for the liver, a bright-eyed flower was for the eyes, a\r\nfoot-shaped flower or leaf would certainly cure the gout, and so on; and\r\nthen when they found a plant which certainly grew and increased, but of\r\nwhich the organs of fructification were invisible, it was a clear\r\nconclusion that properly used the plant would confer the gift of\r\ninvisibility. Whether the people really believed this or not we cannot\r\nsay,[92:1] but they were quite ready to believe any wonder connected\r\nwith the plant, and so it was a constant advertisement with the quacks.\r\nEven in Addison's time \"it was impossible to walk the streets without\r\nhaving an advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor who had\r\narrived at the knowledge of the Green and Red Dragon, and had discovered\r\nthe female Fern-seed. Nobody ever knew what this meant\" (\"Tatler,\" No.\r\n240). But to name all the superstitions connected with the Fern would\r\ntake too much space.\r\n\r\nThe name is expressive; it is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon _fepern_,\r\nand so shows that some of our ancestors marked its feathery form; and\r\nits history as a garden plant is worth a few lines. So little has it\r\nbeen esteemed as a garden plant that Mr. J. Smith, the ex-Curator of the\r\nKew Gardens, tells us that in the year 1822 the collection of Ferns at\r\nKew was so extremely poor that \"he could not estimate the entire Kew\r\ncollection of exotic Ferns at that period at more than forty species\"\r\n(Smith's \"Ferns, British and Exotic,\" introduction). Since that time the\r\nsteadily increasing admiration of Ferns has caused collectors to send\r\nthem from all parts of the world, so that in 1866 Mr. Smith was enabled\r\nto describe about a thousand species, and now the number must be much\r\nlarger; and the closer search for Ferns has further brought into notice\r\na very large number of most curious varieties and monstrosities, which\r\nit is still more curious to observe are, with very few exceptions,\r\nconfined to the British species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91:1] See Brown's \"Religio Medici,\" p. ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[92:1] It probably was the real belief, as we find it so often mentioned\r\nas a positive fact; thus Browne--\r\n\r\n     \"Poor silly fool! thou striv'st in vain to know\r\n      If I enjoy or love where thou lov'st so;\r\n      Since my affection ever secret tried\r\n      Blooms like the Fern, and seeds still unespied.\"\r\n\r\n                     _Poems_, p. 26 (Sir E.

The Fig, as we eat it, is\r\nneither fruit nor flower, though partaking of both, being really the\r\nhollow, fleshy receptacle enclosing a multitude of flowers, which never\r\nsee the light, yet come to full perfection and ripen their seed. The Fig\r\nstands alone in this peculiar arrangement of its flowers, but there are\r\nother plants of which we eat the unopened or undeveloped flowers, as the\r\nArtichoke, the Cauliflower, the Caper, the Clove, and the Pine Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[94:1] This proverbial worthlessness of the Fig is of ancient date.\r\nTheocritus speaks of συκινοι ανδρες, useless men; Horace, \"Olim\r\ntruncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum;\" and Juvenal, \"Sterilis mala\r\nrobora ficus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILBERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Caliban._\r\n\r\n     I'll bring thee to clustering Filberds.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act ii, sc. 2(174).\r\n                                                   (_See_ HAZEL.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Cæsar._\r\n\r\n                  This common body\r\n     Like to a vagabond Flag upon the stream\r\n     Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\r\n     To rot itself with motion.\r\n\r\n                       _Antony and Cleopatra_, act i, sc. 4 (44).\r\n\r\nWe now commonly call the Iris a Flag, and in Shakespeare's time the Iris\r\npseudoacorus was called the Water Flag, and so this passage might,\r\nperhaps, have been placed under Flower-de-luce. But I do not think that\r\nthe Flower-de-luce proper was ever called a Flag at that time, whereas\r\nwe know that many plants, especially the Reeds and Bulrushes, were\r\ncalled in a general way Flags. This is the case in the Bible, the\r\nlanguage of which is always a safe guide in the interpretation of\r\ncontemporary literature. The mother of Moses having placed the infant in\r\nthe ark of Bulrushes, \"laid it in the Flags by the river's brink,\" and\r\nthe daughter of Pharaoh \"saw the ark among the Flags.\" Job asks, \"Can\r\nthe Flag grow without water?\" and Isaiah draws the picture of desolation\r\nwhen \"the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up, and the Reeds\r\nand the Flags shall wither.\" But in these passages, not only is the\r\noriginal word very loosely translated, but the original word itself was\r\nso loosely used that long ago Jerome had said it might mean any marsh\r\nplant, _quidquid in palude virens nascitur_. And in the same way I\r\nconclude that when Shakespeare named the Flag he meant any long-leaved\r\nwaterside plant that is swayed to and fro by the stream, and that\r\ntherefore this passage might very properly have been placed under\r\nRushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ford._\r\n\r\n     What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of Flax?\r\n\r\n                               _Merry Wives_, act v, sc. 5 (159).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Clifford._\r\n\r\n     Beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims\r\n     Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and Flax.\r\n\r\n                               _2nd Henry VI_, act v, sc. 2 (54).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Sir Toby._\r\n\r\n     Excellent; it hangs like Flax in a distaff.\r\n\r\n                             _Twelfth Night_, act i, sc. 3 (108).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _3rd Servant._\r\n\r\n     Go thou: I'll fetch some Flax and white of eggs\r\n     To apply to his bleeding face.[95:1]\r\n\r\n                               _King Lear_, act iii, sc. 7 (106).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Ophelia._\r\n\r\n     His beard was as white as snow,\r\n     All Flaxen was his poll.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 5 (195).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Leontes._\r\n\r\n     My wife deserves a name\r\n     As rank as any Flax-wench.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act i, sc. 2 (276).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Emilia._\r\n\r\n                     It could\r\n     No more be hid in him, than fire in Flax.\r\n\r\n                         _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act v, sc. 3 (113).\r\n\r\nThe Flax of commerce (_Linum usitatissimum_) is not a true native,\r\nthough Turner said: \"I have seen flax or lynt growyng wilde in Sommerset\r\nshyre\" (\"Herbal,\" part ii. p. 39); but it takes kindly to the soil, and\r\nsoon becomes naturalized in the neighbourhood of any Flax field or mill.\r\nWe have, however, three native Flaxes in England, of which the smallest,\r\nthe Fairy Flax (_L. catharticum_), is one of the most graceful ornaments\r\nof our higher downs and hills.[96:1] The Flax of commerce, which is the\r\nplant referred to by Shakespeare, is supposed to be a native of Egypt,\r\nand we have early notice of it in the Book of Exodus; and the microscope\r\nhas shown that the cere-cloths of the most ancient Egyptian mummies are\r\nmade of linen. It was very early introduced into England, and the\r\nspinning of Flax was the regular occupation of the women of every\r\nhousehold, from the mistress downwards, so that even queens are\r\nrepresented in the old illuminations in the act of spinning, and \"the\r\nspinning-wheel was a necessary implement in every household, from the\r\npalace to the cottage.\"--WRIGHT, _Domestic Manners_. The occupation is\r\nnow almost gone, driven out by machinery, but it has left its mark on\r\nour language, at least on our legal language, which acknowledges as the\r\nonly designation of an unmarried woman that she is \"a spinster.\"\r\n\r\nA crop of Flax is one of the most beautiful, from the rich colour of the\r\nflowers resting on their dainty stalks. But it is also most useful; from\r\nit we get linen, linseed oil, oilcake, and linseed-meal; nor do its\r\nvirtues end there, for \"Sir John Herschel tells us the surprising fact\r\nthat old linen rags will, when treated with sulphuric acid, yield more\r\nthan their own weight of sugar. It is something even to have lived in\r\ndays when our worn-out napkins may possibly reappear on our tables in\r\nthe form of sugar.\"--LADY WILKINSON.\r\n\r\nAs garden plants the Flaxes are all ornamental. There are about eighty\r\nspecies, some herbaceous and some shrubby, and of almost all colours,\r\nand in most of the species the colours are remarkably bright and clear.\r\nThere is no finer blue than in L. usitatissimum, no finer yellow than in\r\nL. trigynum, or finer scarlet than in L. grandiflorum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[95:1] \"_Juniper._ Go get white of egg and a little Flax, and close the\r\nbreach of the head; it is the most conducible thing that can be.\"--BEN\r\nJONSON, _The Case Altered_, act ii, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n[96:1] \"From the abundant harvests of this elegant weed on the upland\r\npastures, prepared and manufactured by supernatural skill, 'the good\r\npeople' were wont, in the olden time, to procure the necessary supplies\r\nof linen!\"--JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWER-DE-LUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n             Lilies of all kinds,\r\n     The Flower-de-luce being one.\r\n\r\n                             _Winters Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (126).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _K.

I need not therefore dwell on it, especially as my present\r\nbusiness is to settle not what the Fleur-de-luce meant in the arms of\r\nFrance, but what it meant in Shakespeare's writings. But here the same\r\ndifficulty at once meets us, some writers affirming stoutly that it is a\r\nLily, others as stoutly that it is an Iris. For the Lily theory there\r\nare the facts that Shakespeare calls it one of the Lilies, and that the\r\nother way of spelling it is Fleur-de-lys. I find also a strong\r\nconfirmation of this in the writings of St. Francis de Sales\r\n(contemporary with Shakespeare). \"Charity,\" he says, \"comprehends the\r\nseven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and resembles a beautiful Flower-de-luce,\r\nwhich has six leaves whiter than snow, and in the middle the pretty\r\nlittle golden hammers\" (\"Philo,\" book xi., Mulholland's translation).\r\nThis description will in no way fit the Iris, but it may very well be\r\napplied to the White Lily. Chaucer, too, seems to connect the\r\nFleur-de-luce with the Lily--\r\n\r\n     \"Her nekke was white as the Flour de Lis.\"\r\n\r\nThese are certainly strong authorities for saying that the\r\nFlower-de-luce is the Lily. But there are as strong or stronger on the\r\nother side. Spenser separates the Lilies from the Flower-de-luces in his\r\npretty lines--\r\n\r\n     \"Strow mee the grounde with Daffadown-Dillies,\r\n      And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and lovéd Lillies;\r\n                  The Pretty Pawnce\r\n                  And the Chevisaunce\r\n      Shall match with the fayre Floure Delice.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Shepherd's Calendar._\r\n\r\nBen Jonson separates them in the same way--\r\n\r\n     \"Bring rich Carnations, Flower-de-luces, Lillies.\"\r\n\r\nLord Bacon also separates them: \"In April follow the double White\r\nViolet, the Wall-flower, the Stock-Gilliflower, the Cowslip, the\r\nFlower-de-luces, and Lilies of all Natures;\" and so does Drayton--\r\n\r\n     \"The Lily and the Flower de Lis\r\n      For colours much contenting.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     _Nymphal V._\r\n\r\nIn heraldry also the Fleur-de-lis and the Lily are two distinct\r\nbearings. Then, from the time of Turner in 1568, through Gerard and\r\nParkinson to Miller, all the botanical writers identify the Iris as the\r\nplant named, and with this judgment most of our modern writers\r\nagree.[99:1] We may, therefore, assume that Shakespeare meant the Iris\r\nas the flower given by Perdita, and we need not be surprised at his\r\nclassing it among the Lilies. Botanical classification was not very\r\naccurate in his day, and long after his time two such celebrated men as\r\nRedouté and De Candolle did not hesitate to include in the \"Liliacæ,\"\r\nnot only Irises, but Daffodils, Tulips, Fritillaries, and even Orchids.\r\n\r\nWhat Iris Shakespeare especially alluded to it is useless to inquire. We\r\nhave two in England that are indigenous--one the rich golden-yellow (_I.\r\npseudacorus_), which in some favourable positions, with its roots in the\r\nwater of a brook, is one of the very handsomest of the tribe; the other\r\nthe Gladwyn (_I. fœtidissima_), with dull flowers and strong-smelling\r\nleaves, but with most handsome scarlet fruit, which remain on the plant\r\nand show themselves boldly all through the winter and early spring. Of\r\nother sorts there is a large number, so that the whole family, according\r\nto the latest account by Mr. Baker, of Kew, contains ninety-six distinct\r\nspecies besides varieties. They come from all parts of the world, from\r\nthe Arctic Circle to the South of China; they are of all colours, from\r\nthe pure white Iris Florentina to the almost black I. Susiana; and of\r\nall sizes, from a few inches to four feet or more. They are mostly easy\r\nof cultivation and increase readily, so that there are few plants better\r\nsuited for the hardy garden or more ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99:1] G. Fletcher's Flower-de-luce was certainly the Iris--\r\n\r\n     \"The Flower-de-Luce and the round specks of dew\r\n      That hung upon the azure leaves did shew\r\n      Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"leaves\" here must be the petals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUMITER, FUMITORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Cordelia._\r\n\r\n     Crown'd with rank Fumiter and Furrow-weeds.\r\n\r\n                                  _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 4 (3).\r\n                                          (_See_ CUCKOO-FLOWERS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Burgundy._\r\n\r\n                          Her fallow leas\r\n     The Darnel, Hemlock, and rank Fumitory\r\n     Doth root upon.\r\n\r\n                                    _Henry V_, act v, sc. 2 (44).\r\n\r\nOf Fumitories we have five species in England, all of them weeds in\r\ncultivated grounds and in hedgerows. None of them can be considered\r\ngarden plants, but they are closely allied to the Corydalis, of which\r\nthere are several pretty species, and to the very handsome Dielytras, of\r\nwhich one species--D. spectabilis--ranks among the very handsomest of\r\nour hardy herbaceous plants. How the plant acquired its name of\r\nFumitory--_fume-terre_, earth-smoke--is not very satisfactorily\r\nexplained, though many explanations have been given; but that the name\r\nwas an ancient one we know from the interesting Stockholm manuscript of\r\nthe eleventh century published by Mr. J. Pettigrew, and of which a few\r\nlines are worth quoting. (The poem is published in the \"Archæologia,\"\r\nvol. xxx.)--\r\n\r\n     \"Fumiter is erbe, I say,\r\n      Yt spryngyth ī April et in May,\r\n      In feld, in town, in yard, et gate,\r\n      Yer lond is fat and good in state,\r\n      Dun red is his flour\r\n      Ye erbe smek lik in colowur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURZE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ariel._\r\n\r\n                So I charm'd their ears,\r\n     That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through\r\n     Tooth'd Briers, sharp Furzes, pricking Goss, and Thorns.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (178).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Gonzalo._\r\n\r\n     Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of\r\n       barren ground, long Heath, brown Furze, anything.\r\n\r\n                                      _Ibid._, act i, sc. 1 (70).\r\n\r\nWe now call the Ulex Europæus either Gorse, or Furze, or Whin; but in\r\nthe sixteenth century I think that the Furze and Gorse were\r\ndistinguished (_see_ GORSE), and that the brown Furze was the Ulex. It\r\nis a most beautiful plant, and with its golden blossoms and richly\r\nscented flowers is the glory of our wilder hill-sides. It is especially\r\na British plant, for though it is found in other parts of Europe, and\r\neven in the Azores and Canaries, yet I believe it is nowhere found in\r\nsuch abundance or in such beauty as in England. Gerard says, \"The\r\ngreatest and highest that I did ever see do grow about Excester, in the\r\nWest Parts of England;\" and those that have seen it in Devonshire will\r\nagree with him. It seems to luxuriate in the damp, mild climate of\r\nDevonshire, and to see it in full flower as it covers the low hills that\r\nabut upon the Channel between Ilfracombe and Clovelly is a sight to be\r\nlong remembered. It is, indeed, a plant that we may well be proud of.\r\nLinnæus could only grow it in a greenhouse, and there is a well-known\r\nstory of Dillenius that when he first saw the Furze in blossom in\r\nEngland he fell on his knees and thanked God for sparing his life to see\r\nso beautiful a part of His creation. The story may be apocryphal, but we\r\nhave a later testimony from another celebrated traveller who had seen\r\nthe glories of tropical scenery, and yet was faithful to the beauties of\r\nthe wild scenery of England. Mr. Wallace bears this testimony: \"I have\r\nnever seen in the tropics such brilliant masses of colour as even\r\nEngland can show in her Furze-clad commons, her glades of Wild\r\nHyacinths, her fields of Poppies, her meadows of Buttercups and\r\nOrchises, carpets of yellow, purple, azure blue, and fiery crimson,\r\nwhich the tropics can rarely exhibit. We have smaller masses of colour\r\nin our Hawthorns and Crab trees, our Holly and Mountain Ash, our Broom,\r\nFoxgloves, Primroses, and purple Vetches, which clothe with gay colours\r\nthe length and breadth of our land\" (\"Malayan Archipelago,\" ii. 296).\r\n\r\nAs a garden shrub the Furze may be grown either as a single lawn shrub\r\nor in the hedge or shrubbery. Everywhere it will be handsome both in its\r\nsingle and double varieties, and as it bears the knife well, it can be\r\nkept within limits. The upright Irish form also makes an elegant shrub,\r\nbut does not flower so freely as the typical plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARLICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Bottom._\r\n\r\n     And, most clear actors, eat no Onions nor Garlic, for we are\r\n       to utter sweet breath.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 2 (42).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Lucio._\r\n\r\n     He would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and\r\n       Garlic.\r\n\r\n                     _Measure for Measure_, act iii, sc. 2 (193).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Hotspur._\r\n\r\n               I had rather live\r\n     With cheese and Garlic in a windmill.\r\n\r\n                            _1st Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 1 (161).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Menenius._\r\n\r\n             You that stood so much\r\n     Upon the voice of occupation, and\r\n     The breath of Garlic-eaters.\r\n\r\n                                _Coriolanus_, act iv, sc. 6 (96).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Dorcas._\r\n\r\n     Mopsa must be your mistress; marry, Garlic to mend her kissing\r\n       with.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (162).\r\n\r\nThere is something almost mysterious in the Garlick that it should be so\r\nthoroughly acceptable, almost indispensable, to many thousands, while to\r\nothers it is so horribly offensive as to be unbearable. The Garlick of\r\nEgypt was one of the delicacies that the Israelites looked back to with\r\nfond regret, and we know from Herodotus that it was the daily food of\r\nthe Egyptian labourer; yet, in later times, the Mohammedan legend\r\nrecorded that \"when Satan stepped out from the Garden of Eden after the\r\nfall of man, Garlick sprung up from the spot where he placed his left\r\nfoot, and Onions from that which his right foot touched, on which\r\naccount, perhaps, Mohammed habitually fainted at the sight of either.\"\r\nIt was the common food also of the Roman labourer, but Horace could only\r\nwonder at the \"dura messorum illia\" that could digest the plant \"cicutis\r\nallium nocentius.\" It was, and is the same with its medical virtues.\r\nAccording to some it was possessed of every virtue,[102:1] so that it\r\nhad the name of Poor Man's Treacle (the word treacle not having its\r\npresent meaning, but being the Anglicised form of theriake, or\r\nheal-all[103:1]); while, on the other hand, Gerard affirmed \"it yieldeth\r\nto the body no nourishment at all; it ingendreth naughty and sharpe\r\nbloud.\"\r\n\r\nBullein describes it quaintly: \"It is a grosse kinde of medicine, verye\r\nunpleasant for fayre Ladies and tender Lilly Rose colloured damsels\r\nwhich often time profereth sweet breathes before gentle wordes, but both\r\nwould do very well\" (\"Book of Simples\"). Yet if we could only divest it\r\nof its evil smell, the wild Wood Garlick would rank among the most\r\nbeautiful of our British plants. Its wide leaves are very similar to\r\nthose of the Lily of the Valley, and its starry flowers are of the very\r\npurest white. But it defies picking, and where it grows it generally\r\ntakes full possession, so that I have known several woods--especially on\r\nthe Cotswold Hills--that are to be avoided when the plant is in flower.\r\nThe woods are closely carpeted with them, and every step you take brings\r\nout their fœtid odour. There are many species grown in the gardens,\r\nsome of which are even very sweet smelling (as A. odorum and A.\r\nfragrans); but these are the exceptions, and even these have the Garlick\r\nscent in their leaves and roots. Of the rest many are very pretty and\r\nworth growing, but they are all more or less tainted with the evil\r\nhabits of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[102:1] \"You (_i.e._, citizens) are still sending to the apothecaries,\r\nand still crying out to 'fetch Master Doctor to me;' but our (_i.e._,\r\ncountrymen's) apothecary's shop is our garden full of pot herbs, and our\r\ndoctor is a good clove of Garlic.\"--_The Great Frost of January, 1608._\r\n\r\n[103:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Crist, which that is to every harm triacle.\"\r\n\r\n                                    CHAUCER, _Man of Lawes Tale_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Treacle was there anone forthe brought.\"\r\n\r\n                                          _Le Morte Arthur_, 864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGILLIFLOWERS, _see_ CARNATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     I must have Saffron to colour the Warden pies--Mace--Dates?\r\n       none, that's out of my note; Nutmegs, seven--a race or two\r\n       of Ginger, but that I may beg.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (48).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Sir Toby._\r\n\r\n     Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no\r\n       more cakes and ale.\r\n\r\n     _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Yes, by St. Anne, and Ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.\r\n\r\n                            _Twelfth Night_, act ii, sc. 3 (123).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Pompey._\r\n\r\n     First, here's Young Master Rash, he's in for a commodity of\r\n       brown paper and old Ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds,\r\n       of which he made five marks ready money; marry, then, Ginger\r\n       was not much in request, for the old women were all dead.\r\n\r\n                        _Measure for Measure_, act iv, sc. 3 (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Salanio._\r\n\r\n     I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped\r\n       Ginger.\r\n\r\n                        _Merchant of Venice_, act iii, sc. 1 (9).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _2nd Carrier._\r\n\r\n     I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of Ginger to be\r\n       delivered as far as Charing Cross.\r\n\r\n                              _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 1 (26).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Orleans._\r\n\r\n     He's of the colour of the Nutmeg.\r\n\r\n     _Dauphin._\r\n\r\n     And of the heat of the Ginger.\r\n\r\n                                  _Henry V_, act iii, sc. 7 (20).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Julia._\r\n\r\n     What is't you took up so Gingerly?\r\n\r\n                    _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, act i, sc. 2 (70).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Costard._\r\n\r\n     An I had but one penny in the world, thou should'st have it to\r\n       buy Ginger-bread.\r\n\r\n                       _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 1 (74).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Hotspur._\r\n\r\n     Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,\r\n     A good mouth-filling oath, and leave \"in sooth,\"\r\n     And such protest of pepper Ginger-bread\r\n     To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.\r\n\r\n                            _1st Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 1 (258).\r\n\r\nGinger was well known both to the Greeks and Romans. It was imported\r\nfrom Arabia, together with its name, Zingiberri, which it has retained,\r\nwith little variation, in all languages.\r\n\r\nWhen it was first imported into England is not known, but probably by\r\nthe Romans, for it occurs as a common ingredient in many of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon medical recipes. Russell, in the \"Boke of Nurture,\" mentions\r\nseveral kinds of Ginger; as green and white, \"colombyne, valadyne, and\r\nMaydelyn.\" In Shakespeare's time it was evidently very common and cheap.\r\n\r\nIt is produced from the roots of Zingiber officinale, a member of the\r\nlarge and handsome family of the Ginger-worts. The family contains some\r\nof the most beautiful of our greenhouse plants, as the Hedychiums,\r\nAlpinias, and Mantisias; and, though entirely tropical, most of the\r\nspecies are of easy cultivation in England. Ginger is very easily reared\r\nin hotbeds, and I should think it very probable that it may have been so\r\ngrown in Shakespeare's time. Gerard attempted to grow it, but he\r\nnaturally failed, by trying to grow it in the open ground as a hardy\r\nplant; yet \"it sprouted and budded forth greene leaves in my garden in\r\nthe heate of somer;\" and he tells us that plants were sent him by \"an\r\nhonest and expert apothecarie, William Dries, of Antwerp,\" and \"that the\r\nsame had budded and grown in the said Dries' garden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     All the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this\r\n       age shapes them, are not worth a Gooseberry.\r\n\r\n                              _2nd Henry IV_, act i, sc. 2 (194).\r\n\r\nThe Gooseberry is probably a native of the North of England, but Turner\r\nsaid (s.v. _uva crispa_) \"it groweth onely that I have sene in England,\r\nin gardines, but I have sene it in Germany abrode in the fieldes amonge\r\nother busshes.\"\r\n\r\nThe name has nothing to do with the goose. Dr. Prior has satisfactorily\r\nshown that the word is a corruption of \"Crossberry.\" By the writers of\r\nShakespeare's time, and even later, it was called Feaberry (Gerard,\r\nLawson, and others), and in one of the many books on the Plague\r\npublished in the sixteenth century, the patient is recommended to eat\r\n\"thepes, or goseberries\" (\"A Counsell against the Sweate,\" fol. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGORSE OR GOSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Ariel._\r\n\r\n     Tooth'd Briers, sharp Furzes, pricking Goss, and Thorns.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (180).\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Furze (which see), I said that in Shakespeare's time\r\nthe Furze and Gorse were probably distinguished, though now the two\r\nnames are applied to the same plant. \"In the 15th Henry VI. (1436),\r\nlicense was given to Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, to inclose 200 acres\r\nof land--pasture, wode, hethe, vrises,[106:1] and gorste (_bruere, et\r\njampnorum_), and to form thereof a Park at Greenwich.\"--_Rot. Parl._ iv.\r\n498.[106:2] This proves that the \"Gorst\" was different from the \"Vrise,\"\r\nand it may very likely have been the Petty Whin. \"Pricking Goss,\"\r\nhowever, may be only a generic term, like Bramble and Brier, for any\r\nwild prickly plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106:1] There is a hill near Lansdown (Bath) now called Frizen or\r\nFreezing Hill. Within memory of man it was covered with Gorse. This was\r\nprobably the origin of the name, \"Vrisen Hill.\"\r\n\r\n[106:2] \"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" p. 162, note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOURD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Pistol._\r\n\r\n     For Gourd and fullam holds.\r\n\r\n                                _Merry Wives_, act i, sc. 3 (94).\r\n\r\nI merely mention this to point out that \"Gourd,\" though probably\r\noriginally derived from the fruit, is not the fruit here, but is an\r\ninstrument of gambling.

Thus Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"And every grass that groweth upon roote\r\n      Sche schal eek know, to whom it will do boote\r\n      Al be his woundes never so deep and wyde.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _The Squyeres Tale._\r\n\r\nIt is used in the same general way in the Bible, \"the Grass of the\r\nfield.\"\r\n\r\nIn the whole range of botanical studies the accurate study of the\r\nGrasses is, perhaps, the most difficult as the genus is the most\r\nextensive, for Grasses are said to \"constitute, perhaps, a twelfth part\r\nof the described species of flowering plants, and at least nine-tenths\r\nof the number of individuals comprising the vegetation of the world\"\r\n(Lindley), so that a full study of the Grasses may almost be said to be\r\nthe work of a lifetime. But Shakespeare was certainly no such student of\r\nGrasses: in all these passages Grass is only mentioned in a generic\r\nmanner, without any reference to any particular Grass. The passages in\r\nwhich hay is mentioned, I have not thought necessary to quote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAREBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n                             Thou shalt not lack\r\n     The flower that's like thy face, pale Primrose, nor\r\n     The azured Harebell, like thy veins.\r\n\r\n                                _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (220).\r\n                                               (_See_ EGLANTINE.)\r\n\r\nThe Harebell of Shakespeare is undoubtedly the Wild Hyacinth (_Scilla\r\nnutans_), the \"sanguine flower inscribed with woe\" of Milton's\r\n\"Lycidas,\" though we must bear in mind that the name is applied\r\ndifferently in various parts of the island; thus \"the Harebell of Scotch\r\nwriters is the Campanula, and the Bluebell, so celebrated in Scottish\r\nsong, is the Wild Hyacinth or Scilla; while in England the same names\r\nare used conversely, the Campanula being the Bluebell and the Wild\r\nHyacinth the Harebell\" (\"Poets' Pleasaunce\")--but this will only apply\r\nin poetry; in ordinary language, at least in the South of England, the\r\nWild Hyacinth is the Bluebell, and is the plant referred to by\r\nShakespeare as the Harebell.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the chief ornaments of our woods,[109:1] growing in\r\nprofusion wherever it establishes itself, and being found of various\r\ncolours--pink, white, and blue. As a garden flower it may well be\r\nintroduced into shrubberies, but as a border plant it cannot compete\r\nwith its rival relation, the Hyacinthus orientalis, which is the parent\r\nof all the fine double and many coloured Hyacinths in which the florists\r\nhave delighted for the last two centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109:1] \"'Dust of sapphire,' writes my friend Dr. John Brown to me of\r\nthe wood Hyacinths of Scotland in the spring; yes, that is so--each bud\r\nmore beautiful itself than perfectest jewel.\"--RUSKIN, _Proserpina_, p.\r\n73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARLOCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Cordelia._\r\n\r\n     Crown'd with rank Fumiter and Furrow-weeds,\r\n     With Harlocks, Hemlock, Nettles, Cuckoo-flowers.\r\n\r\n                                  _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 4 (3).\r\n                                          (_See_ CUCKOO-FLOWERS.)\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than follow Dr. Prior on this word: \"Harlock, as\r\nusually printed in 'King Lear' and in Drayton, ecl. 4--\r\n\r\n     'The Honeysuckle, the Harlocke,\r\n      The Lily and the Lady-smocke,'\r\n\r\nis a word that does not occur in the Herbals, and which the commentators\r\nhave supposed to be a misprint for Charlock.

He, like\r\nthe other early poets, clearly loved the tree for its beauty; and in\r\npicturesque beauty the Hawthorn yields to none, when it can be seen in\r\nsome sheltered valley growing with others of its kind, and allowed to\r\ngrow unpruned, for then in the early summer it is literally a sheet of\r\nwhite, yet beautifully relieved by the tender green of the young leaves,\r\nand by the bright crimson of the anthers, and loaded with a scent that\r\nis most delicate and refreshing. But not only for its beauty is the\r\nHawthorn a favourite tree, but also for its many pleasant\r\nassociations--it is essentially the May tree, the tree that tells that\r\nwinter is really past, and that summer has fairly begun. Hear Spenser--\r\n\r\n     \"Thilke same season, when all is yclade\r\n      With pleasaunce; the ground with Grasse, the woods\r\n      With greene leaves, the bushes with blooming buds,\r\n      Youngthes folke now flocken in everywhere\r\n      To gather May-baskets and smelling Brere;\r\n      And home they hasten the postes to dight,\r\n      And all the kirk-pillours eare day-light,\r\n      With Hawthorne-buds, and sweet Eglantine,\r\n      And girlondes of Roses, and soppes-in-wine.\"\r\n\r\n                                      _Shepherd's Calendar--May._\r\n\r\nYet in spite of its pretty name, and in spite of the poets, the Hawthorn\r\nnow seldom flowers till June, and I should suppose it is never in flower\r\non May Day, except perhaps in Devonshire and Cornwall; and it is very\r\ndoubtful if it ever were so found, except in these southern counties,\r\nthough some fancy that the times of flowering of several of our flowers\r\nare changed, and in some instances largely changed. But \"it was an old\r\ncustom in Suffolk, in most of the farmhouses, that any servant who could\r\nbring in a branch of Hawthorn in full blossom on the 1st of May was\r\nentitled to a dish of cream for breakfast. This custom is now disused,\r\nnot so much from the reluctance of the masters to give the reward, as\r\nfrom the inability of the servants to find the Whitethorn in\r\nflower.\"--BRAND'S _Antiquities_.[112:1] Even those who might not see the\r\nbeauty of an old Thorn tree, have found its uses as one of the very few\r\ntrees that will grow thick in the most exposed places, and so give\r\npleasant shade and shelter in places where otherwise but little shade\r\nand shelter could be found.\r\n\r\n     \"Every shepherd tells his tale\r\n      Under the Hawthorn in the dale.\"--MILTON.\r\n\r\nAnd \"at Hesket, in Cumberland, yearly on St. Barnabas' Day, by the\r\nhighway side under a Thorn tree is kept the court for the whole forest\r\nof Englewood.\"--_History of Westmoreland._\r\n\r\nThe Thorn may well be admitted as a garden shrub either in its ordinary\r\nstate, or in its beautiful double white, red, and pink varieties, and\r\nthose who like to grow curious trees should not omit the Glastonbury\r\nThorn, which flowers at the ordinary time, and bears fruit, but also\r\nbuds and flowers again in winter, showing at the same time the new\r\nflowers and the older fruit.\r\n\r\nNor must we omit to mention that the Whitethorn is one of the trees that\r\nclaims to have been used for the sacred Crown of Thorns. It is most\r\nimprobable that it was so, in fact almost certain that it was not; but\r\nit was a mediæval belief, as Sir John Mandeville witnesses: \"Then was\r\nour Lord yled into a gardyn, and there the Jewes scorned hym, and maden\r\nhym a crowne of the branches of the Albiespyne, that is Whitethorn, that\r\ngrew in the same gardyn, and setten yt upon hys heved. And therefore\r\nhath the Whitethorn many virtues. For he that beareth a branch on hym\r\nthereof, no thundre, ne no maner of tempest may dere hym, ne in the\r\nhowse that it is ynne may non evil ghost enter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we may finish the Hawthorn with a short account of its name, which\r\nis interesting:--\"Haw,\" or \"hay,\" is the same word as \"hedge\" (\"sepes,\r\nid est, _haies_,\" John de Garlande), and so shows the great antiquity of\r\nthis plant as used for English hedges. In the north, \"haws\" are still\r\ncalled \"haigs;\" but whether Hawthorn was first applied to the fruit or\r\nthe hedge, whether the hedge was so called because it was made of the\r\nThorn tree that bears the haws, or whether the fruit was so named\r\nbecause it was borne on the hedge tree, is a point on which etymologists\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112:1] \"Gilbert White in his 'Naturalists' Calendar' as the result of\r\nobservations taken from 1768 to 1793 puts down the flowering of the\r\nHawthorn as occurring in different years upon dates so widely apart as\r\nthe twentieth of April and the eleventh of June.\"--MILNER'S _Country\r\nPleasures_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Mercutio._\r\n\r\n     Her [Queen Mab's] chariot is an empty Hazel-nut\r\n     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\r\n     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act i, sc. 4 (67).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Petruchio._\r\n\r\n                    Kate like the Hazel twig\r\n     Is straight and slender and as brown in hue\r\n     As Hazel-nuts and sweeter than the kernels.\r\n\r\n                      _Taming of the Shrew_, act ii, sc. 1 (255).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Caliban._\r\n\r\n     I'll bring thee to clustering Filberts.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act ii, sc. 2 (174).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Touchstone._\r\n\r\n     Sweetest Nut hath sourest rind,\r\n       Such a Nut is Rosalind.\r\n\r\n                          _As You Like It_, act iii, sc. 2 (115).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Celia._\r\n\r\n     For his verity in love I do think him as concave as a covered\r\n       goblet or a worm-eaten Nut.\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 4 (25).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Lafeu._\r\n\r\n     Believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light Nut.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act ii, sc. 5 (46).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Mercutio._\r\n\r\n     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking Nuts, having no\r\n       other reason but because thou hast Hazel eyes.\r\n\r\n                         _Romeo and Juliet_, act iii, sc. 1 (20).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Thersites._\r\n\r\n     Hector shall have a great catch, if he knock out either of\r\n       your brains; a' were as good crack a fusty Nut with no\r\n       kernel.\r\n\r\n                     _Troilus and Cressida_, act ii, sc. 1 (109).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Gonzalo._\r\n\r\n     I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no\r\n       stronger than a Nut-shell.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act i, sc. 1 (49).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (10) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     I have a venturous fairy that shall seek\r\n     The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new Nuts.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (40).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (11) _Hamlet._\r\n\r\n     O God, I could be bounded in a Nut-shell and count myself a\r\n       king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act ii, sc. 2 (260).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (12) _Dromio of Syracuse._\r\n\r\n     Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,\r\n     A Rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\r\n     A Nut, a Cherry-stone.\r\n\r\n                          _Comedy of Errors_, act iv, sc. 3 (72).\r\n\r\nDr. Prior has decided that \"'Filbert' is a barbarous compound of\r\n_phillon_ or _feuille_, a leaf, and _beard_, to denote its\r\ndistinguishing peculiarity, the leafy involucre projecting beyond the\r\nnut.\" But in the times before Shakespeare the name was more poetically\r\nsaid to be derived from the nymph Phyllis. Nux Phyllidos is its name in\r\nthe old vocabularies, and Gower (\"Confessio Amantis\") tells us why--\r\n\r\n     \"Phyllis in the same throwe\r\n      Was shape into a Nutte-tree,\r\n      That alle men it might see;\r\n      And after Phyllis philliberde,\r\n      This tre was cleped in the yerde\"\r\n\r\n                                                   (Lib. quart.),\r\n\r\nand so Spenser spoke of it as \"'Phillis' philbert\" (Elegy 17).[115:1]\r\n\r\nThe Nut, the Filbert, and the Cobnut, are all botanically the same, and\r\nthe two last were cultivated in England long before Shakespeare's time,\r\nnot only for the fruit, but also, and more especially, for the oil.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarity in the growth of the Nut that is worth the notice\r\nof the botanical student. The male blossoms, or catkins (anciently\r\ncalled \"agglettes or blowinges\"), are mostly produced at the ends of the\r\nyear's shoots, while the pretty little crimson female blossoms are\r\nproduced close to the branch; they are completely sessile or unstalked.\r\nNow in most fruit trees, when a flower is fertilized, the fruit is\r\nproduced exactly in the same place, with respect to the main tree, that\r\nthe flower occupied; a Peach or Apricot, for instance, rests upon the\r\nbranch which bore the flower. But in the Nut a different arrangement\r\nprevails. As soon as the flower is fertilized it starts away from the\r\nparent branch; a fresh branch is produced, bearing leaves and the Nut or\r\nNuts at the end, so that the Nut is produced several inches away from\r\nthe spot on which the flower originally was. I know of no other tree\r\nthat produces its fruit in this way, nor do I know what special benefit\r\nto the plant arises from this arrangement.\r\n\r\nMuch folk-lore has gathered round the Hazel tree and the Nuts. The\r\ncracking of Nuts, with much fortune-telling connected therewith, was\r\nthe favourite amusement on All Hallow's Eve (Oct. 31), so that the\r\nEve was called Nutcrack Night. I believe the custom still exists; it\r\ncertainly has not been very long abolished, for the Vicar of Wakefield\r\nand his neighbours \"religiously cracked Nuts on All Hallow's Eve.\"\r\nAnd in many places \"an ancient custom prevailed of going a Nutting\r\non Holy Rood Day (Sept. 14), which it was esteemed quite unlucky to\r\nomit.\"--FORSTER.[116:1]\r\n\r\nA greater mystery connected with the Hazel is the divining rod, for the\r\ndiscovery of water and metals. This has always by preference been a\r\nforked Hazel-rod, though sometimes other rods are substituted. The\r\nbelief in its power dates from a very early period, and is by no means\r\nextinct. The divining-rod is said to be still used in Cornwall, and\r\nfirmly believed in; nor has this belief been confined to the uneducated.\r\nEven Linnæus confessed himself to be half a convert to it, and learned\r\ntreatises have been written accepting the facts, and accounting for them\r\nby electricity or some other subtle natural agency. Most of us, however,\r\nwill rather agree with Evelyn's cautious verdict, that the virtues\r\nattributed to the forked stick \"made out so solemnly by the attestation\r\nof magistrates, and divers other learned and credible persons, who have\r\ncritically examined matters of fact, is certainly next to a miracle, and\r\nrequires a strong faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115:1] \"Hic fullus--a fylberd-tre.\"--_Nominale_, 15th cent.\r\n\r\n\"Fylberde, notte--Fillum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Filberde, tre--Phillis.\"--_Promptorium Parvulorum._\r\n\r\n\"The Filbyrdes hangyng to the ground.\"--_Squyr of Lowe Degre_ (37).\r\n\r\n[116:1] See a long account of the connection of nuts with All Hallow's\r\nEve in Hanson, \"Med. ævi Calend.\" i. 363.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Gonzalo._\r\n\r\n     Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of\r\n       barren ground, long Heath, brown Furze, anything.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act i, sc. 1 (70).\r\n\r\nThere are other passages in which the word Heath occurs in Shakespeare,\r\nbut in none else is the flower referred to; the other references are to\r\nan open heath or common. And in this place no special Heath can be\r\nselected, unless by \"long Heath\" we suppose him to have meant the Ling\r\n(_Calluna vulgaris_). And this is most probable, for so Lyte calls it.\r\n\"There is in this countrie two kindes of Heath, one which beareth the\r\nflowres alongst the stemmes, and is called Long Heath.\" But it is\r\nsupposed by some that the correct reading is \"Ling, Heath,\" &c., and in\r\nthat case Heath will be a generic word, meaning any of the British\r\nspecies (_see_ LING). Of British species there are five, and wherever\r\nthey exist they are dearly prized as forming a rich element of beauty in\r\nour landscapes. They are found all over the British Islands, and they\r\nseem to be quite indifferent as to the place of their growth. They are\r\nequally beautiful in the extreme Highlands of Scotland, or on the\r\nQuantock and Exmoor Hills of the South--everywhere they clothe the\r\nhill-sides with a rich garment of purple that is wonderfully beautiful,\r\nwhether seen under the full influence of the brightest sunshine, or\r\nunder the dark shadows of the blackest thundercloud. And the botanical\r\ngeography of the Heath tribe is very remarkable; it is found over the\r\nwhole of Europe, in Northern Asia, and in Northern Africa. Then the\r\ntribe takes a curious leap, being found in immense abundance, both of\r\nspecies and individuals, in Southern Africa, while it is entirely absent\r\nfrom North and South America. Not a single species has been found in the\r\nNew World. A few plants of Calluna vulgaris have been found in\r\nNewfoundland and Massachusetts, but that is not a true Heath.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant the Heath has been strangely neglected. Many of the\r\nspecies are completely hardy, and will make pretty evergreen bushes of\r\nfrom 2ft. to 4ft. high, but they are better if kept close-grown by\r\nconstant clipping. The species best suited for this treatment are E.\r\nMediterranea, E. arborea, and E. codonoides. Of the more humble-growing\r\nspecies, E. vagans (the Cornish Heath) will grow easily in most gardens,\r\nthough in its native habitat it is confined to the serpentine formation;\r\nnor must we omit E. herbacea, which also will grow anywhere, and, if\r\nclipped yearly after flowering, will make a most beautiful border to any\r\nflower-bed; or it may be used more extensively, as it is at Doddington\r\nPark, in Gloucestershire (Sir Gerald Codrington's), where there is a\r\nlarge space in front of the house, several yards square, entirely filled\r\nwith E. herbacea. When this is in flower (and it is so for nearly two\r\nmonths, or sometimes more) the effect, as seen from above, is of the\r\nrichest Turkey carpet, but of such a colour and harmony as no Turkey\r\ncarpet ever attained.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the South-European Heaths were cultivated in England in\r\nShakespeare's time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEBENON OR HEBONA.[118:1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Ghost._\r\n\r\n     Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\r\n     With juice of cursed Hebenon in a vial,\r\n     And in the porches of my ear did pour\r\n     The leperous distilment; whose effect\r\n     Holds such an enmity with blood of man\r\n     That swift as quicksilver it courses through\r\n     The natural gates and alleys of the body,\r\n     And with a sudden vigour it doth posset\r\n     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,\r\n     The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;\r\n     And a most instant tetter bark'd about,\r\n     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,\r\n     All my smooth body.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act i, sc. 5 (61).\r\n\r\nBefore and in the time of Shakespeare other writers had spoken of the\r\nnarcotic and poisonous effects of Heben, Hebenon, or Hebona. Gower\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n                \"Ful of delite,\r\n     Slepe hath his hous, and of his couche,\r\n     Within his chambre if I shall touche,\r\n     Of Hebenus that slepy tre\r\n     The bordes all aboute be.\"\r\n\r\n                    _Conf. Aman._, lib. quart. (ii. 103, Paulli).\r\n\r\nSpenser says--\r\n\r\n     \"Faire Venus sonne, . . .\r\n      Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _F. Q._, introd., st. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"There (in Mammon's garden) Cypresse grew in greatest store,\r\n      And trees of bitter gall and Heben sad.\"\r\n\r\n                               _F. Q._, book ii, c. viij, st. 17.\r\n\r\nAnd he speaks of a \"speare of Heben wood,\" and \"a Heben launce.\"\r\nMarlowe, a contemporary and friend of Shakespeare, makes Barabas curse\r\nhis daughter with--\r\n\r\n     \"In few the blood of Hydra, Lerna's bane,\r\n      The juice of Hebon, and Cocytus breath,\r\n      And all the poison of the Stygian pool.\"\r\n\r\n                                  _Jew of Malta_, act iii, st. 4.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that all these authors allude to the same\r\ntree, but what tree is meant has sorely puzzled the commentators. Some\r\nnaturally suggested the Ebony, and this view is supported by the\r\nrespectable names of Archdeacon Nares, Douce, Schmidt, and Dyce. A\r\nlarger number pronounced with little hesitation in favour of Henbane\r\n(_Hyoscyamus niger_), the poisonous qualities of which were familiar to\r\nthe contemporaries of Shakespeare, and were supposed by most of the\r\nbotanical writers of his day (and on the authority of Pliny) to be\r\ncommunicated by being poured into the ears. But the Henbane is not a\r\ntree, as Gower's \"Hebenus\" and Spenser's \"Heben\" certainly were; and\r\nthough it will satisfy some of the requirements of the plant named by\r\nShakespeare, it will not satisfy all.[119:1]\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that the difficulty would at once have been\r\ncleared up by reference to the accounts of the death of Hamlet's father,\r\nas given by Saxo Grammaticus, and the old \"Hystorie of Hamblet,\" but\r\nneither of these writers attribute his death to poison.[119:2]\r\n\r\nThe question has lately been very much narrowed and satisfactorily\r\nsettled (for the present, certainly, and probably altogether) by Dr.\r\nNicholson and the Rev. W. A. Harrison. These gentlemen have decided that\r\nthe true reading is Hebona, and that Hebona is the Yew. Their views are\r\nstated at full length in two exhaustive papers contributed to the New\r\nShakespeare Society, and published in their \"Transactions.\"[119:3] The\r\nfull argument is too long for insertion here, and my readers will thank\r\nme for referring them to the papers in the \"Transactions.\" The main\r\narguments are based on three facts: 1. That in nearly all the northern\r\nnations (including, of course, Denmark) the name of the Yew is more or\r\nless like Heben. 2. That all the effects attributed by Shakespeare to\r\nthe action of Hebona are described as arising from Yew-poisoning by\r\ndifferent medical writers, some of them contemporary with him, and some\r\nwriting with later experiences. 3. That the _post mortem_ appearances\r\nafter Yew-poisoning and after snake-poisoning are very similar, and it\r\nwas \"given out, that sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me.\"\r\n\r\nBut it may well be asked, How could Shakespeare have known of all these\r\neffects, which (as far as our present search has discovered) are not\r\nnamed by any one writer of his time, and some of which have only been\r\nmade public from the results of Yew-poisoning since his day? I think the\r\nquestion can be answered in a very simple way. The effects are described\r\nwith such marked minuteness that it seems to me not only very probable,\r\nbut almost certain, that Shakespeare must have been an eye-witness of a\r\ncase of Yew-poisoning, and that what he saw had been so photographed on\r\nhis mind that he took the first opportunity that presented itself to\r\nreproduce the picture. With his usual grand contempt for perfect\r\naccuracy he did not hesitate to sweep aside at once the strict\r\nhistorical records of the old king's death, and in its place to paint\r\nfor us a cold-blooded murder carried out by means which he knew from his\r\npersonal experience to be possible, and which he felt himself able to\r\ndescribe with a minuteness which his knowledge of his audiences assured\r\nhim would not be out of place even in that great tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the Yew theory of Hebona, that the Yew is named by\r\nShakespeare under its more usual name, is no real objection. On the same\r\nground Ebony and Henbane must be excluded; together with Gilliflowers,\r\nwhich he elsewhere speaks of as Carnations; and Woodbine, because he\r\nalso speaks of Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118:1] Hebona is the reading of the First Quarto (1603) and of the\r\nSecond Quarto (1604), and is decided by the critics to be the true\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n[119:1] Mr. Beisley suggests Enoron, _i.e._, Nightshade, which Mr. Dyce\r\ndescribes as \"a villainous conjecture.\" In my first edition I expressed\r\nmy belief that Hebenon was either Henbane or a general term for a deadly\r\npoisonous plant; but I had not then seen Dr. Nicholson's and Mr.\r\nHarrison's papers.\r\n\r\n[119:2] Saxo Grammaticus: \"Ubi datus parricidio locus, cruenta manu\r\nmentis libidinem satiavit; trucidati quoque fratris uxore potitus,\r\nincestum parricidio adjecit.\"--_Historiæ Danorum_, lib. iii, fol. xxvii,\r\nEd. 1514.\r\n\r\n\"The Historye of Hamblet, Prince of Denmark:\" Fergon \"having secretly\r\nassembled certain men and perceiving himself strong enough to execute\r\nhis enterprise, Horvendile, his brother, being at a banquet with his\r\nfriends, sodainely set upon him, where he slewe him as treacherously, as\r\ncunningly he purged himselfe of so detestable a murder to his\r\nsubjects.\"--COLLIER'S _Shakespeare's Library_.\r\n\r\n[119:3] \"Hamlet's Cursed Hebenon,\" by Dr. R.

It was introduced into England long\r\nbefore his time, and largely cultivated, but only in few parts of\r\nEngland, and chiefly in the eastern counties. I do not find that it was\r\ncultivated in gardens in his time, but it is a plant well deserving a\r\nplace in any garden, and is especially suitable from its height and\r\nregular growth, for the central plant of a flower-bed. It is supposed to\r\nbe a native of India, and seems capable of cultivation in almost any\r\nclimate.[122:1]\r\n\r\nThe name has a curious history. \"The Greek κάνναβις, and Latin\r\n_cannabis_, are both identical with the Sanscrit _kanam_, as well as\r\nwith the German _hanf_, and the English _hemp_. More directly from\r\n_cannabis_ comes canvas, made up of hemp or flax, and canvass, to\r\ndiscuss: _i.e._, sift a question; metaphorically from the use of hempen\r\nsieves or sifters.\"--BIRDWOOD'S _Handbook to the Indian Court_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122:1] In Shakespeare's time the vulgar name for Hemp was Neckweed, and\r\nthere is a curious account of it under that name by William Bullein, in\r\n\"The Booke of Compounds,\" f. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERB OF GRACE, _see_ RUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Song._\r\n\r\n     Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green Holly:\r\n     Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:\r\n                Then, heigh-ho, the Holly!\r\n                This life is most jolly.\r\n\r\n                           _As You Like It_, act ii, sc. 7 (180).\r\n\r\nFrom this single notice of the Holly in Shakespeare, and from the\r\nslight account of it in Gerard, we might conclude that the plant was not\r\nthe favourite in the sixteenth century that it is in the nineteenth; but\r\nthis would be a mistake. The Holly entered largely into the old\r\nChristmas carols.\r\n\r\n         \"Christmastide\r\n     Comes in like a bride,\r\n     With Holly and Ivy clad\"--\r\n\r\nand it was from the earliest times used for the decoration of houses and\r\nchurches at Christmas. It does not, however, derive its name from this\r\ncircumstance, though it was anciently spelt \"holy,\" or called the \"holy\r\ntree,\" for the name comes from a very different source, and is identical\r\nwith \"holm,\" which, indeed, was its name in the time of Gerard and\r\nParkinson, and is still its name in some parts of England, though it has\r\nalmost lost its other old name of Hulver,[123:1] except in the eastern\r\ncounties, where the word is still in use. But as an ornamental tree it\r\ndoes not seem to have been much valued, though in the next century\r\nEvelyn is loud in the praises of this \"incomparable tree,\" and admired\r\nit both for its beauty and its use. It is certainly the handsomest of\r\nour native evergreens, and is said to be finer in England than in any\r\nother country; and as seen growing in its wild habitats in our forests,\r\nas it may be seen in the New Forest and the Forest of Dean, it stands\r\nwithout a rival, equally beautiful in summer and in winter; in summer\r\nits bright glossy leaves shining out distinctly in the midst of any\r\nsurrounding greenery, while as \"the Holly that outdares cold winter's\r\nire\" (Browne), it is the very emblem of bright cheerfulness, with its\r\nfoliage uninjured in the most severe weather, and its rich coral\r\nberries, sometimes borne in the greatest profusion, delighting us with\r\ntheir brilliancy and beauty. And as a garden shrub, the Holly still\r\nholds its own, after all the fine exotic shrubs that have been\r\nintroduced into our gardens during the present century. It can be grown\r\nas a single shrub, or it may be clipped, and will then form the best and\r\nthe most impregnable hedge that can be grown. No other plant will\r\ncompare with it as a hedge plant, if it be only properly attended to,\r\nand we can understand Evelyn's pride in his \"glorious and refreshing\r\nobject,\" a Holly hedge 160ft. in length, 7ft. in height, and 5ft. in\r\ndiameter, which he could show in his \"poor gardens at any time of the\r\nyear, glittering with its armed and vernished leaves,\" and \"blushing\r\nwith their natural corale.\" Nor need we be confined to plain green in\r\nsuch a hedge. The Holly runs into a great many varieties, with the\r\nleaves of all shapes and sizes, and blotched and variegated in different\r\nfashions and colours. All of these seem to be comparatively modern. In\r\nthe time of Gerard and Parkinson there seems to have been only the one\r\ntypical species, and perhaps the Hedgehog Holly.\r\n\r\nI may finish the notice of the Holly by quoting two most remarkable uses\r\nof the tree mentioned by Parkinson: \"With the flowers of Holly, saith\r\nPliny from Pythagoras, water is made ice; and againe, a staffe of the\r\ntree throwne at any beast, although it fall short by his defect that\r\nthrew it, will flye to him, as he lyeth still, by the speciall property\r\nof the tree.\" He may well add--\"This I here relate that you may\r\nunderstand the fond and vain conceit of those times, which I would to\r\nGod we were not in these dayes tainted withal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[123:1] \"_Hulwur_-tre (huluyr), hulmus, hulcus aut huscus.\"--_Promptorium\r\nParvulorum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLY THISTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Margaret._\r\n\r\n     Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it\r\n       to your heart; it is the only thing for a qualm.\r\n\r\n     _Hero._\r\n\r\n     There thou prickest her with a Thistle.\r\n\r\n     _Beatrice._\r\n\r\n     Benedictus!

It is mentioned\r\nin all the treatises on the Plague, and especially by Thomas Brasbridge,\r\nwho, in 1578, published his \"Poore Mans Jewell, that is to say, a\r\nTreatise of the Pestilence: vnto which is annexed a declaration of the\r\nvertues of the Hearbes Carduus Benedictus and Angelica.\" This little\r\nbook Shakespeare may have seen; it speaks of the virtues of the\r\n\"distilled\" leaves: it says, \"it helpeth the hart,\" \"expelleth all\r\npoyson taken in at the mouth and other corruption that doth hurt and\r\nannoye the hart,\" and that \"the juyce of it is outwardly applied to the\r\nbodie\" (\"lay it to your heart\"), and concludes, \"therefore I counsell\r\nall them that have Gardens to nourish it, that they may have it always\r\nto their own use, and the use of their neighbours that lacke it.\" The\r\nplant has long lost this high character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEYSTALKS, _see_ CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEYSUCKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Hero._\r\n\r\n     And bid her steal into the pleached bower\r\n     Where Honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,\r\n     Forbid the sun to enter.\r\n\r\n                    _Much Ado About Nothing_, act iii, sc. 1 (7).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Ursula._\r\n\r\n     So angle we for Beatrice; who even now\r\n     Is couched in the Woodbine coverture.\r\n\r\n                                                    _Ibid._ (29).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.\r\n     So doth the Woodbine the sweet Honeysuckle\r\n     Gently entwist; the Female Ivy so\r\n     Enrings the barky fingers of the Elm.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (47).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Hostess._\r\n\r\n     O thou Honeysuckle villain.\r\n\r\n                              _2nd Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 1 (52).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Oberon._\r\n\r\n     I know a bank where the wild Thyme blows,\r\n     Where Oxlips and the nodding Violet grows,\r\n     Quite over-canopied with luscious Woodbine.\r\n\r\n                  _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act ii, sc. 1 (249).\r\n\r\nI have joined together here the Woodbine and the Honeysuckle, because\r\nthere can be little doubt that in Shakespeare's time the two names\r\nbelonged to the same plant,[126:1] and that the Woodbine was (where the\r\ntwo names were at all discriminated, as in No. 3), applied to the plant\r\ngenerally, and Honeysuckle to the flower. This seems very clear by\r\ncomparing together Nos. 1 and 2. In earlier writings the name was\r\napplied very loosely to almost any creeping or climbing plant. In an\r\nAnglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the eleventh century it is applied to the Wild\r\nClematis (\"Viticella--Weoden-binde\"); while in Archbishop Ælfric's\r\n\"Vocabulary\" of the tenth century it is applied to the Hedera nigra,\r\nwhich may be either the Common or the Ground Ivy (\"Hedera\r\nnigra--Wude-binde\"); and in the Herbarium and Leechdom books of the\r\ntwelfth century it is applied to the Capparis or Caper-plant, by which,\r\nhowever (as Mr. Cockayne considers), the Convolvulus Sepium is meant.\r\nAfter Shakespeare's time again the words began to be used confusedly.\r\nMilton does not seem to have been very clear in the matter. In \"Paradise\r\nLost\" he makes our first parents \"wind the Woodbine round this arbour\"\r\n(perhaps he had Shakespeare's arbour in his mind); and in \"Comus\" he\r\ntells us of--\r\n\r\n                          \"A bank\r\n     With ivy-canopied, and interwove\r\n     With flaunting Honeysuckle.\"[126:2]\r\n\r\nWhile in \"Lycidas\" he tells of--\r\n\r\n     \"The Musk Rose and the well-attired Woodbine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we can scarcely suppose that he would apply two such contrary\r\nepithets as \"flaunting\" and \"well-attired\" to the same plant. And now\r\nthe name, as of old, is used with great uncertainty, and I have heard it\r\napplied to many plants, and especially to the small sweet-scented\r\nClematis (_C. flammula_).\r\n\r\nBut with the Honeysuckle there is no such difficulty. The name is an old\r\none, and in its earliest use was no doubt indifferently applied to many\r\nsweet-scented flowers (the Primrose amongst them); but it was soon\r\nattached exclusively to our own sweet Honeysuckle of the woods and\r\nhedges. We have two native species (Lonicera periclymenum and L.\r\nxylosteum), and there are about eighty exotic species, but none of them\r\nsweeter or prettier than our own, which, besides its fragrant flowers,\r\nhas pretty, fleshy, red fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Honeysuckle has ever been the emblem of firm and fast affection--as\r\nit climbs round any tree or bush, that is near it, not only clinging to\r\nit faster than Ivy, but keeping its hold so tight as to leave its mark\r\nin deep furrows on the tree that has supported it. The old writers are\r\nfond of alluding to this. Bullein in \"The Book of Simples,\" 1562, says\r\nvery prettily, \"Oh, how swete and pleasant is Wood-binde, in woodes or\r\narbours, after a tender, soft rain: and how friendly doe this herbe, if\r\nI maie so name it, imbrace the bodies, armes, and branches of trees,\r\nwith his long winding stalkes, and tender leaves, openyng or spreading\r\nforthe his swete Lillis, like ladie's fingers, emōg the thornes or\r\nbushes,\" and there is no doubt from the context that he is here\r\nreferring to the Honeysuckle. Chaucer gives the crown of Woodbine to\r\nthose who were constant in love--\r\n\r\n     \"And tho that weare chaplets on their hede\r\n      Of fresh Woodbine, be such as never were\r\n      To love untrue in word, thought, ne dede,\r\n      But aye stedfast; ne for pleasaunce ne fere,\r\n      Though that they should their hertes al to-tere,\r\n      Would never flit, but ever were stedfast\r\n      Till that there lives there asunder brast.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _The Flower and the Leaf._\r\n\r\nThe two last lines well describe the fast union between the Honeysuckle\r\nand its mated tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Woodbines of sweet honey full.\"\r\n\r\n                 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, _Tragedy of Valentinian_.\r\n\r\n[126:2] Milton probably took the idea from Theocritus--\r\n\r\n                          \"Ivy reaches up and climbs,\r\n     Gilded with blossom-dust about its lip;\r\n     Round which a Woodbine wreathes itself, and flaunts\r\n     Her saffron fruitage.\"--_Idyll_ i. (_Calverley_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSSOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iago._\r\n\r\n     'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our\r\n       gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if\r\n       we will plant Nettles or sow Lettuce, set Hyssop, and weed\r\n       up Thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract\r\n       it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness,\r\n       or maimed with industry, why, the power and corrigible\r\n       authority of this lies in our wills.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act i, sc. 3 (322).\r\n\r\nWe should scarcely expect such a lesson of wisdom drawn from the simple\r\nherb-garden in the mouth of the greatest knave and villain in the whole\r\nrange of Shakespeare's writings. It was the preaching of a deep\r\nhypocrite, and while we hate the preacher we thank him for his\r\nlesson.[128:1]\r\n\r\nThe Hyssop (_Hyssopus officinalis_) is not a British plant, but it was\r\nheld in high esteem in Shakespeare's time. Spenser spoke of it as--\r\n\r\n     \"Sharp Isope good for green wounds remedies\"--\r\n\r\nand Gerard grew in his garden five or six different species or\r\nvarieties. He does not tell us where his plants came from, and perhaps\r\nhe did not know. It comes chiefly from Austria and Siberia; yet Greene\r\nin his \"Philomela,\" 1615, speaks of \"the Hyssop growing in America, that\r\nis liked of strangers for the smell, and hated of the inhabitants for\r\nthe operation, being as prejudicial to the one as delightsome to the\r\nother.\" It is now very little cultivated, for it is not a plant of much\r\nbeauty, and its medicinal properties are not much esteemed; yet it is a\r\nplant that must always have an interest to readers of the Bible; for\r\nthere it comes before us as the plant of purification, as the plant of\r\nwhich the study was not beneath the wisdom of Solomon, and especially\r\nas the plant that added to the cruelties of the Crucifixion. Whether\r\nthe Hyssop of Scripture is the Hyssopus officinalis is still a question,\r\nbut at the present time the most modern research has decided that it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128:1] It seems likely from the following passage from Lily's \"Euphues,\r\nthe anatomy of wit,\" 1617, that the plants were not named at random by\r\nIago, but that there was some connection between them. \"Good gardeners,\r\nin their curious knots, mixe Isope with Time, as aiders the one with the\r\nothers; the one being dry, the other moist.\" The gardeners of the\r\nsixteenth century had a firm belief in the sympathies and antipathies of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSANE ROOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Banquo._\r\n\r\n     Were such things here as we do speak about?\r\n     Or have we eaten on the Insane Root\r\n     That takes the reason prisoner?\r\n\r\n                                    _Macbeth_, act i, sc. 3 (83).\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that Shakespeare had no particular plant in view,\r\nbut simply referred to any of the many narcotic plants which, when given\r\nin excess, would \"take the reason prisoner.\" The critics have suggested\r\nmany plants--the Hemlock, the Henbane, the Belladonna, the Mandrake,\r\n&c., each one strengthening his opinion from coeval writers. In this\r\nuncertainty I should incline to the Henbane from the following\r\ndescription by Gerard and Lyte. \"This herbe is called . . . of\r\nApuleia-Mania\" (Lyte). \"Henbane is called . . . of Pythagoras,\r\nZoroaster, and Apuleius, Insana\" (Gerard).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Titania._\r\n\r\n                    The female Ivy so\r\n     Enrings the barky fingers of the Elm.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (48).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n                    That now he was\r\n     The Ivy which had hid my princely trunk\r\n     And suck'd my verdure out on't.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act i, sc. 2 (85).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Adriana._\r\n\r\n     If ought possess thee from me, it is dross,\r\n     Usurping Ivy, Brier, or idle Moss.\r\n\r\n                         _Comedy of Errors_, act ii, sc. 2 (179).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Shepherd._\r\n\r\n     They have scared away two of my best sheep, which I fear the\r\n       wolf will sooner find than the master; if anywhere I have\r\n       them 'tis by the seaside browsing of Ivy.[130:1]\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iii, sc. 3 (66).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Perithores._\r\n\r\n                   His head's yellow,\r\n     Hard hayr'd, and curl'd, thicke twin'd like Ivy tops,\r\n     Not to undoe with thunder.\r\n\r\n                        _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 2 (115).\r\n\r\nThe rich evergreen of \"the Ivy never sear\" (Milton) recommended it to\r\nthe Romans to be joined with the Bay in the chaplets of poets--\r\n\r\n             \"Hanc sine tempora circum\r\n     Inter victrices Hederam tibi serpere lauros.\"--VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n             \"Seu condis amabile carmen\r\n     Prima feres Hederæ victricis præmia.\"--HORACE.\r\n\r\nAnd in mediæval times it was used with Holly for Christmas decorations,\r\nso that Bullein called it \"the womens Christmas Herbe.\" But the old\r\nwriters always assumed a curious rivalry between the two--\r\n\r\n     \"Holly and Ivy made a great party\r\n      Who should have the mastery\r\n              In lands where they go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is a well-known carol of the time of Henry VI., which tells of\r\nthe contest between the two, and of the mastery of the Holly; it is in\r\neight stanzas, of which I extract the last four--\r\n\r\n     \"Holly he hath berries as red as any Rose,\r\n      The foresters, the hunters, keep them from the does;\r\n      Ivy she hath berries as black as any Sloe,\r\n      There come the owls and eat them as they go;\r\n      Holly he hath birds, a full fair flock,\r\n      The nightingale, the popinjay, the gentle laverock;\r\n      Good Ivy, say to us, what birds hast thou?\r\n      None but the owlet that cries 'How, how!'\"\r\n\r\nThus the Ivy was not allowed the same honour inside the houses of our\r\nancestors as the Holly, but it held its place outside the houses as a\r\nsign of good cheer to be had within. The custom is now extinct, but\r\nformerly an Ivy bush (called a tod of Ivy) was universally hung out in\r\nfront of taverns in England, as it still is in Brittany and Normandy.\r\nHence arose two proverbs--\"Good wine needs no bush,\" _i.e._, the\r\nreputation is sufficiently good without further advertisement; and \"An\r\nowl in an Ivy bush,\" as \"perhaps denoting originally the union of wisdom\r\nor prudence with conviviality, as 'Be merry and wise.'\"--NARES.\r\n\r\nThe Ivy was a plant as much admired by our grandfathers of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries as it is now by us. Spenser was evidently fond\r\nof it--\r\n\r\n     \"And nigh thereto a little chappel stoode\r\n      Which being all with Yvy overspread\r\n      Deckt all the roofe, and shadowing the rode\r\n      Seem'd like a grove faire branched over hed.\"\r\n\r\n                                              _F. Q._, vi, v, 25.\r\n\r\nIn another place he speaks of it as--\r\n\r\n     \"Wanton Yvie, flouring fayre.\"--_F. Q._, ii, v, 29.\r\n\r\nAnd in another place--\r\n\r\n     \"Amongst the rest the clambering Ivie grew\r\n      Knitting his wanton armes with grasping hold,\r\n      Least that the Poplar happely should rew\r\n      Her brother's strokes, whose boughs she doth enfold\r\n      With her lythe twigs till they the top survew,\r\n      And paint with pallid greene her buds of gold.\"\r\n\r\n                                                 VIRGIL'S _Gnat_.\r\n\r\nChaucer describes it as--\r\n\r\n     \"The erbe Ivie that groweth in our yard that mery is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the same poem he prettily describes it as--\r\n\r\n     \"The pallid Ivie building his own bowre.\"\r\n\r\nAs a wild plant, the Ivy is found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but not\r\nin America, and wherever it is found it loves to cover old walls and\r\nbuildings, and trees of every sort, with its close and rich drapery and\r\nclusters of black fruit,[132:1] and where it once establishes itself it\r\nis always beautiful, but not always harmless. Both on trees and\r\nbuildings it requires very close watching. It will very soon destroy\r\nsoft-wooded trees, such as the Poplar and the Ash, by its tight embrace,\r\nnot by sucking out the sap, but by preventing the outward growth of the\r\nshoots, and checking--and at length preventing--the flow of sap; and in\r\nbuildings it is no doubt beneficial as long as it is closely watched and\r\nkept in place, but if allowed to drive its roots into joints, or to grow\r\nunder roofs, the swelling roots and branches will soon displace any\r\nmasonry, and cause immense mischief.\r\n\r\nWe have only one species of Ivy in England, and there are only two real\r\nspecies recognized by present botanists, but there are infinite\r\nvarieties, and many of them very beautiful. These variegated Ivies were\r\nknown to the Greeks and Romans, and were highly prized by them, one\r\nespecially with white fruit (at present not known) was the type of\r\nbeauty. No higher praise could be given to a beauty than that she was\r\n\"Hedera formosior alba.\" These varieties are scarcely mentioned by\r\nGerard and Parkinson, and probably were not much valued; they are now in\r\ngreater repute, and nothing will surpass them for rapidly and\r\neffectually covering any bare spaces.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely add that the Ivy is so completely hardy that it will\r\ngrow in any aspect and in any soil; that its flowers are the staple food\r\nof bees in the late autumn; and that all the varieties grow easily from\r\ncuttings at almost any time of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130:1] Sheep feeding on Ivy--\r\n\r\n     \"My sheep have Honeysuckle bloom for pasture; Ivy grows\r\n      In multitudes around them, and blossoms like the Rose.\"\r\n\r\n                            THEOCRITUS, _Idyll_ v.

It seems also to\r\nhave been used for any dry weeds--\r\n\r\n     \"All the wyves of Tottenham came to se that syght,\r\n      With Wyspes, and Kexis, and ryschys ther lyght,\r\n      To fech hom ther husbandes, that wer tham trouth plyght.\"\r\n\r\n                                \"The Tournament of Tottenham,\" in\r\n                            RITSON'S _Ancient Songs and Ballads_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOT-GRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Lysander._\r\n\r\n                      Get you gone, you dwarf;\r\n     You minimus, of hindering Knot-grass made;\r\n     You bead, you Acorn.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 2 (328).\r\n\r\nThe Knot-grass is the Polygonum aviculare, a British weed, low,\r\nstraggling, and many-jointed, hence its name of Knot-grass. There is no\r\ndoubt that this is the plant meant, and its connection with a dwarf is\r\nexplained by the belief, probably derived from some unrecorded character\r\ndetected by the \"doctrine of signatures,\" that the growth of children\r\ncould be stopped by a diet of Knot-grass. Steevens quotes Beaumont and\r\nFletcher to this effect, and this will probably explain the epithet\r\n\"hindering.\" But there may be another explanation. Johnston tells us\r\nthat in the north, \"being difficult to cut in the harvest time, or to\r\npull in the process of weeding, it has obtained the sobriquet of the\r\nDeil's-lingels.\" From this it may well be called \"hindering,\" just as\r\nthe Ononis, from the same habit of catching the plough and harrow, has\r\nobtained the prettier name of \"Rest-harrow.\"\r\n\r\nBut though Shakespeare's Knot-grass is undoubtedly the Polygonum, yet\r\nthe name was also given to another plant, for this cannot be the plant\r\nmentioned by Milton--\r\n\r\n                        \"The chewing flocks\r\n     Had ta'en their supper on the savoury herb\r\n     Of Knot-grass dew-besprent.\"--_Comus._\r\n\r\nIn this case it must be one of the pasture Grasses, and may be Agrostis\r\nstolonifera, as it is said to be in Aubrey's \"Natural History of Wilts\"\r\n(Dr. Prior).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY-SMOCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Song of Spring._\r\n\r\n       And Lady-smocks all silver-white,\r\n     And Cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,\r\n       Do paint the meadows with delight.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (905).\r\n\r\nLady-smocks are the flowers of Cardamine pratensis, the pretty early\r\nmeadow flower of which children are so fond, and of which the popularity\r\nis shown by its many names: Lady-smocks, Cuckoo-flower,[134:1] Meadow\r\nCress, Pinks, Spinks, Bog-spinks, and May-flower, and \"in Northfolke,\r\nCanterbury Bells.\" The origin of the name is not very clear. It is\r\ngenerally explained from the resemblance of the flowers to smocks hung\r\nout to dry, but the resemblance seems to me rather far-fetched.\r\nAccording to another explanation, \"the Lady-smock, a corruption of Our\r\nLady's-smock, is so called from its first flowering about Lady-tide. It\r\nis a pretty purplish white, tetradynamous plant, which blows from\r\nLady-tide till the end of May, and which during the latter end of April\r\ncovers the moist meadows with its silvery-white, which looks at a\r\ndistance like a white sheet spread over the fields.\"--_Circle of the\r\nSeasons._ Those who adopt this view called the plant Our Lady's-smock,\r\nbut I cannot find that name in any old writers. Drayton, coeval with\r\nShakespeare, says--\r\n\r\n                                 \"Some to grace the show,\r\n     Of Lady-smocks most white do rob each neighbouring mead,\r\n     Wherewith their loose locks most curiously they braid.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Isaac Walton, in the next century, drew that pleasant picture of\r\nhimself sitting quietly by the waterside--\"looking down the meadows I\r\ncould see here a boy gathering Lilies and Lady-smocks, and there a girl\r\ncropping Culverkeys and Cowslips.\"[134:2]\r\n\r\nThere is a double variety of the Lady-smock which makes a handsome\r\ngarden plant, and there is a remarkable botanical curiosity connected\r\nwith the plant which should be noticed. The plant often produces in the\r\nautumn small plants upon the leaves, and by the means of these little\r\nparasites the plant is increased, and even if the leaves are detached\r\nfrom the plant, and laid upon moist congenial soil, young plants will be\r\nproduced. This is a process that is well known to gardeners in the\r\npropagation of Begonias, and it is familiar to us in the proliferous\r\nFerns, where young plants are produced on the surface or tips of the\r\nfronds; and Dr. Masters records \"the same condition as a teratological\r\noccurrence in the leaves of Hyacinthus Pouzolsii, Drosera intermedia,\r\nArabis pumila, Chelidonum majus, Chirita Sinensis, Epicia bicolor,\r\nZamia, &c.\"--_Vegetable Teratology_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134:1] \"Ladies-smock.--A kind of water cresses, of whose virtue it\r\npartakes; and it is otherwise called Cuckoo-flower.\"--PHILLIPS, _World\r\nof Words_, 1696.\r\n\r\n[134:2] Culverkeys is mentioned in Dennis' \"Secrets of Angling\" as a\r\nmeadow flower: \"pale Ganderglas, and azor Culverkayes.\" It is also\r\nmentioned by Aubrey, in his \"Natural History of Wilts;\" but the name is\r\nfound in no other writer, and is now extinct. It is difficult to say\r\nwhat plant is meant; many have been suggested: the Columbine, the Meadow\r\nOrchis, the Bluebell, &c. I think it must be the Meadow Geranium, which\r\nis certainly \"azor\" almost beyond any other British plant. \"Culver\" is a\r\ndove or pigeon, and \"keyes\" or \"kayes\" are the seeds of a plant, and the\r\nseeds of the Geranium were all likened to the claws of birds, so that\r\nour British species is called G. columbinum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLARK'S HEELS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Larks heels trim.\r\n\r\n                               _Two Noble Kinsmen_, Introd. song.\r\n\r\nLark's heels is one of the many names of the Garden Delphinium,\r\notherwise called Larkspur, Larksclaw, Larkstoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Clarence._\r\n\r\n         To whom the heavens in thy nativity\r\n     Adjudged an Olive branch and Laurel crown\r\n     As likely to be blest in peace and war.\r\n\r\n                              _3rd Henry VI_, act iv, sc. 6 (33).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Titus._\r\n\r\n     Cometh Andronicus bound with Laurel boughs.\r\n\r\n                           _Titus Andronicus_, act i, sc. 1 (74).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Cleopatra._\r\n\r\n                   Upon your sword\r\n     Sit Laurel victory.\r\n\r\n                       _Antony and Cleopatra_, act i, sc. 3 (99).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Ulysses._\r\n\r\n     Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, Laurels.\r\n\r\n                      _Troilus and Cressida_, act i, sc. 3 (107).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the plants which Shakespeare borrowed from the classical\r\nwriters; it is not the Laurel of our day, which was not introduced till\r\nafter his death,[136:1] but the Laurea Apollinis, the Laurea Delphica--\r\n\r\n     \"The Laurel meed of mightie conquerors\r\n      And poet's sage,\"--SPENSER;\r\n\r\nthat is, the Bay.

But unconsciously Chaucer and Shakespeare spoke with\r\nmore botanical accuracy than we do, the Bay being a true Laurel, while\r\nthe Laurel is a Cherry (_see_ BAY).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136:1] The first Laurel grown in Europe was grown by Clusius in 1576.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._\r\n\r\n               Here's flowers for you;\r\n     Hot Lavender, Mints, Savory, Marjoram.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (103).\r\n\r\nThe mention of Lavender always recalls Walton's pleasant picture of \"an\r\nhonest ale-house, where we shall find a cleanly room, Lavender in the\r\nwindows, and twenty ballads stuck against the wall, and my hostess, I\r\nmay tell you, is both cleanly and handsome and civil.\" Whether it is\r\nfrom this familiar, old-fashioned picture, or from some inherent charm\r\nin the plant, it is hard to say, but it is certain that the smell of\r\nLavender is always associated with cleanliness and freshness.[137:1]\r\n\r\nIt is not a British plant, but is a native of the South of Europe in dry\r\nand barren places, and it was introduced into England in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but it probably was not a common plant in Shakespeare's time,\r\nfor though it is mentioned by Spenser as \"the Lavender still gray\"\r\n(\"Muiopotmos\"), and by Gerard as growing in his garden, it is not\r\nmentioned by Bacon in his list of sweet-smelling plants. The fine\r\naromatic smell is found in all parts of the shrub, but the essential oil\r\nis only produced from the flowers. As a garden plant it is found in\r\nevery garden, but its growth as an extensive field crop is chiefly\r\nconfined to the neighbourhood of Mitcham and Carshalton in Surrey; and\r\nthere at the time of the picking of the flowers, and still more in the\r\nlater autumn when the old woody plants are burned, the air for a long\r\ndistance is strongly and most pleasantly impregnated with the delicate\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137:1] The very name suggests this association. Lavender is the English\r\nform of the Latin name, Lavendula; \"lavendula autem dicta quoniam magnum\r\nvectigal Genevensibus mercatoribus præbet quotannis in Africam eam\r\nferentibus, ubi lavandis fovendisque corporibus Lybes ea utuntur, nec\r\nnisi decocto ejus abluti, mane domo egrediuntur.\"--_Stephani Libellus de\r\nre Hortensi_, 1536, p. 54.

By the Egyptians the plant was almost considered sacred,\r\n\"Porrum et cæpe nefas violare et frangere morsu\" (Juvenal); we know how\r\nLeeks were relished in Egypt by the Israelites; and among the Greeks\r\nthey \"appear to have constituted so important a part in ancient gardens,\r\nthat the term πρασιά, or a bed, derived its name from πρασον, the Greek\r\nword for Onion,\" or Leek[138:1] (Daubeny); while among the Anglo-Saxons\r\nit was very much the same. The name is pure Anglo-Saxon, and originally\r\nmeant any vegetable; then it was restricted to any bulbous vegetable,\r\nbefore it was finally further restricted to our Leek; and \"its\r\nimportance was considered so much above that of any other vegetable,\r\nthat _leac-tun_, the Leek-garden, became the common name of the kitchen\r\ngarden, and _leac-ward_, the Leek-keeper, was used to designate the\r\ngardener\" (Wright). The plant in those days gave its name to the Broad\r\nLeek which is our present Leek, the Yne Leek or Onion, the Garleek\r\n(Garlick), and others of the same tribe, while it was applied to other\r\nplants of very different families, as the Hollow Leek (_Corydalis\r\ncava_), and the House Leek (_Sempervivum tectorum_).\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been considered the hardiest of all flowers. In the\r\naccount of the Great Frost of 1608, \"this one infallible token\" is given\r\nin proof of its severity. \"The Leek whose courage hath ever been so\r\nundaunted that he hath borne up his lusty head in all storms, and could\r\nnever be compelled to shrink for hail, snow, frost, or showers, is now\r\nby the violence and cruelty of this weather beaten unto the earth, being\r\nrotted, dead, disgraced, and trod upon.\"\r\n\r\nIts popularity still continues among the Welsh, by whom it is still, I\r\nbelieve, very largely cultivated; but it does not seem to have been much\r\nvalued in England in Shakespeare's time, for Gerard has but little to\r\nsay of its virtues, but much of its \"hurts.\" \"It hateth the body,\r\ningendreth naughty blood, causeth troublesome and terrible dreames,\r\noffendeth the eyes, dulleth the sight, &c.\" Nor does Parkinson give a\r\nmuch more favourable account. \"Our dainty eye now refuseth them wholly,\r\nin all sorts except the poorest; they are used with us sometimes in Lent\r\nto make pottage, and is a great and generall feeding in Wales with the\r\nvulgar gentlemen.\" It was even used as the proverbial expression of\r\nworthlessness, as in the \"Roumaunt of the Rose,\" where the author says,\r\nspeaking of \"Phiciciens and Advocates\"--\r\n\r\n     \"For by her wille, without leese,\r\n      Everi man shulde be seke,\r\n      And though they die, they settle not a Leke.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"And other suche, deare ynough a Leeke.\"\r\n\r\n                               _Prologue of the Chanoune's Tale._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The beste song that ever was made\r\n      Ys not worth a Leky's blade,\r\n      But men will tend ther tille.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _The Child of Bristowe._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[138:1] For a testimony of the high value placed on the Leek by the\r\nGreeks see a poem on Μῶλυ, in \"Anonymi Carmen de Herbis\" in the \"Poetæ\r\nBucolici et didactici.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Biron._\r\n\r\n     A Lemon.\r\n\r\n     _Longaville._\r\n\r\n              Stuck with Cloves.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (654).\r\n\r\n_See_ ORANGE AND CLOVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iago._\r\n\r\n     If we will plant Nettles or sow Lettuce.

There are two rival candidates for the\r\nhonour--the Lily and the Rose; and as we look on the one or the other,\r\nour allegiance is divided, and we vote the crown first to one and then\r\nto the other. We should have no difficulty \"were t'other fair charmer\r\naway,\" but with two such candidates, both equally worthy of the honour,\r\nwe vote for a diarchy instead of a monarchy, and crown them both.[142:1]\r\nYet there are many that would at once choose the Lily for the queen,\r\nand that without hesitation, and they would have good authority for\r\ntheir choice. \"O Lord, that bearest rule,\" says Esdras, \"of the whole\r\nworld, Thou hast chosen Thee of all the flowers thereof one Lily.\"\r\nSpenser addresses the Lily as--\r\n\r\n     \"The Lily, lady of the flow'ring field\"--_F. Q._, ii, 6, 16,\r\n\r\nwhich is the same as Shakespeare's \"mistress of the field,\" (8), and\r\nmany a poet since his time has given the same vote in many a pretty\r\nverse, which, however, it would take too much space to quote at length;\r\nso that I will content myself with these few lines by Alexander\r\nMontgomery (coeval with Shakespeare)--\r\n\r\n     \"I love the Lily as the first of flowers\r\n        Whose stately stalk so straight up is and stay;\r\n      To whom th' lave ay lowly louts and cowers\r\n        As bound so brave a beauty to obey.\"\r\n\r\nMontgomery here has clearly in his mind's eye the Lily now so called;\r\nbut the name was not so restricted in the earlier writers. \"Lilium,\r\ncojus vox generali et licentiosa usurpatione adscribitur omni flori\r\ncommendabili\" (Laurembergius, 1632). This was certainly the case with\r\nthe Greek and Roman writers, and it is so in our English Bible in most\r\nof the cases where the word is used, but perhaps not universally so. It\r\nis so used by Gower, describing Tarquin cutting off the tall flowers, by\r\nsome said to be Poppies and by others Lilies--\r\n\r\n     \"And in the garden as they gone,\r\n      The Lilie croppes one and one,\r\n      Where that they were sprongen out,\r\n      He smote off, as they stood about.\"\r\n\r\n                                          _Conf. Ama._ lib. sept.\r\n\r\nIt is used in the same way by Bullein when, speaking of the flower of\r\nthe Honeysuckle (_see_ HONEYSUCKLE), and it must have been used in the\r\nsame sense by Isaak Walton, when he saw a boy gathering \"Lilies and\r\nLady-smocks\" in the meadows.\r\n\r\nWe have still many records of this loose way of speaking of the Lily, in\r\nthe Water Lily, the Lily of the Valley, the Lent Lily, St. Bruno's\r\nLily, the Scarborough Lily, the Belladonna Lily, and several others,\r\nnone of which are true Lilies.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to come to Shakespeare's Lilies. In all the twenty-eight\r\npassages the greater portion simply recall the Lily as the type of\r\nelegance and beauty, without any special reference to the flower, and in\r\nmany the word is only used to express a colour, Lily-white. But in the\r\nothers he doubtless had some special plant in view, and there are two\r\nspecies which, from contemporary writers, seem to have been most\r\ncelebrated in his day. The one is the pure White Lily (_Lilium\r\ncandidum_), a plant of which the native country is not yet quite\r\naccurately ascertained. It is reported to grow wild in abundance in\r\nLebanon, and it probably came to England from the East in very early\r\ntimes. It was certainly largely grown in Europe in the Middle Ages, and\r\nwas universally acknowledged by artists, sculptors, and architects, as\r\nthe emblem of female elegance and purity, and none of us would dispute\r\nits claim to such a position. There is no other Lily which can surpass\r\nit, when well grown, in stateliness and elegance, with sweet-scented\r\nflowers of the purest white and the most graceful shape, and crowning\r\nthe top of the long leafy stem with such a coronal as no other plant can\r\nshow. On the rare beauties and excellences of the White Lily it would be\r\neasy to fill a volume merely with extracts from old writers, and such a\r\nvolume would be far from uninteresting. Those who wish for some such\r\naccount may refer to the \"Monographie Historique et Littéraire des Lis,\"\r\npar Fr. de Cannart d'Hamale, 1870. There they will find more than fifty\r\npages of the botany, literary history, poetry, and medical uses of the\r\nplant, together with its application to religious emblems, numismatics,\r\nheraldry, painting, &c. Two short extracts will suffice here:--\"Le lis\r\nblanc, surnommé la fleur des fleurs, les délices de Venus, la Rose de\r\nJunon, qu'Anguillara désigna sous le nom d'Ambrosia, probablement à\r\ncause de son parfum suivant, et pent être aussi de sa soidisante divine\r\norigine, se place tout naturellement à le tête de ce groupe splendide.\"\r\n\"C'est le Lis classique, par excellence, et en même temps le plus beau\r\ndu genre.\"\r\n\r\nThe other is the large Scarlet or Chalcedonian Lily; and this also is\r\none of the very handsomest, though its beauty is of a very different\r\nkind to the White Lily. The habit of the plant is equally stately, and\r\nis indeed very grand, but the colours are of the brightest and clearest\r\nred. These two plants were abundantly grown in Shakespeare's time, but\r\nbesides these there do not seem to have been more than about\r\nhalf-a-dozen species in cultivation. There are now forty-six recognized\r\nspecies, besides varieties in great number.\r\n\r\nThe Lily has a very wide geographical range, spreading from Central\r\nEurope to the Philippines, and species are found in all quarters of the\r\nglobe, though the chief homes of the family seem to be in California and\r\nJapan. Yet we have no wild Lily in England. Both the Martagon and the\r\nPyrenean Lily have been found, but there is no doubt they are garden\r\nescapes.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant it may safely be said that no garden can make any\r\npretence to the name that cannot show a good display of Lilies, many or\r\nfew. Yet the Lily is a most capricious plant; while in one garden almost\r\nany sort will grow luxuriantly, in a neighbouring garden it is found\r\ndifficult to grow any in a satisfactory manner. Within the last few\r\nyears their culture has been much studied, and by the practical\r\nknowledge of such great growers of the family as G. F. Wilson, H. J.\r\nElwes, and other kindred liliophilists, we shall probably in a few years\r\nhave many difficulties cleared up both in the botanical history and the\r\ncultivation of this lovely tribe.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot dismiss the Lily without a few words of notice of its\r\nsacred character. It is the flower specially dedicated to the Virgin\r\nMary, and which is so familiar to us in the old paintings of the\r\nAnnunciation. But it has, of course, a still higher character as a\r\nsacred plant from the high honour placed on it by our Lord in the Sermon\r\non the Mount. After all that has been written on \"the Lilies of the\r\nfield,\" critics have not yet decided whether any, and, if so, what\r\nparticular plant was meant. Each Eastern traveller seems to have\r\nselected the flower that he most admired in Palestine, and then to\r\npronounce that that must be the Lily referred to. Thus, at various times\r\nit has been decided to be the Rose, the Crown Imperial, the White Lily,\r\nthe Chalcedonian Lily, the Oleander, the Wild Artichoke, the\r\nSternbergia, the Tulip, and many others, but the most generally received\r\nopinion now is, that if a true Lily at all, the evidence runs most\r\nstrongly in favour of the L. Chalcedonicum; but that Dean Stanley's view\r\nis more probably the correct one, that the term \"Lily\" is generic,\r\nalluding to the many beautiful flowers, both of the Lily family and\r\nothers, which abound in Palestine. The question, though deeply\r\ninteresting, is not one for which we need to be over-curious as to the\r\ntrue answer. All of us, and gardeners especially, may be thankful for\r\nthe words which have thrown a never dying charm over our favourites, and\r\nhave effectually stopped any foolish objections that may be brought\r\nagainst the deepest study of flowers, as a petty study, with no great\r\nresults. To any such silly objections (and we often hear them) the\r\nanswer is a very short and simple one--that we have been bidden by the\r\nvery highest authority to \"consider the Lilies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[140:1] This is a modern reading, the older and more correct reading is\r\n\"twilled.\"\r\n\r\n[142:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Within the garden's peaceful scene\r\n        Appeared two lovely foes,\r\n      Aspiring to the rank of Queen,\r\n        The Lily and the Rose.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Yours is, she said, the noblest hue,\r\n        And yours the statelier mien,\r\n      And till a third surpasses you\r\n        Let each be deemed a Queen.\"--COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ariel._\r\n\r\n                  All prisoners, sir,\r\n     In the Line-grove which weather-fends your cell.\r\n\r\n                                     _Tempest_, act v, sc. 1 (9).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n     Come, hang them on this Line.\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 1 (193).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Stephano._\r\n\r\n     Mistress Line, is not this my jerkin?\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 1 (235).\r\n\r\nIt is only in comparatively modern times that the old name of Line or\r\nLinden, or Lind,[146:1] has given place to Lime. The tree is a doubtful\r\nnative, but has been long introduced, perhaps by the Romans. It is a\r\nvery handsome tree when allowed room, but it bears clipping well, and so\r\nis very often tortured into the most unnatural shapes. It was a very\r\nfavourite tree with our forefathers to plant in avenues, not only for\r\nits rapid growth, but also for the delicious scent of its flowers; but\r\nthe large secretions of honey-dew which load the leaves, and the fact\r\nthat it comes late into leaf and sheds its leaves very early, have\r\nrather thrown it out of favour of late years. As a useful tree it does\r\nnot rank very high, except for wood-carvers, who highly prize its light,\r\neasily-cut wood, that keeps its shape, and is very little liable to\r\ncrack or split either in the working or afterwards. Nearly all Grinling\r\nGibbons' delicate carving is in Lime wood. To gardeners the Lime is\r\nfurther useful as furnishing the material for bast or bazen mats,[147:1]\r\nwhich are made from its bark, and interesting as being the origin of the\r\nname of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[146:1] \"Be ay of chier as light as lyf on Lynde.\"--CHAUCER, _The\r\nClerkes Tale_, _l'envoi_.\r\n\r\n[147:1] \"Between the barke and the woode of this tree, there bee thin\r\npellicles or skins lying in many folds together, whereof are made bands\r\nand cords called Bazen ropes.\"--PHILEMON HOLLAND'S _Pliny's Nat. Hist._\r\nxvi. 14. The chapter is headed \"Of the Line or Linden Tree.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Gonzalo._\r\n\r\n     Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of\r\n       barren ground, Ling, Heath, brown Furze, anything.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act i, sc. 1 (70).\r\n\r\nIf this be the correct reading (and not Long Heath) the reference is to\r\nthe Heather or Common Ling (_Calluna vulgaris_). This is the plant that\r\nis generally called Ling in the South of England, but in the North of\r\nEngland the name is given to the Cotton Grass (_Eriophorum_). It is very\r\nprobable, however, that no particular plant is intended, but that it\r\nmeans any rough, wild vegetation, especially of open moors and heaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCUSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iago._\r\n\r\n     The food that to him now is as luscious as Locusts, shall be\r\n       to him shortly as bitter as Coloquintida.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act i, sc. 3 (354).\r\n\r\nThe Locust is the fruit of the Carob tree (_Ceratonia siliqua_), a tree\r\nthat grows naturally in many parts of the South of Europe, the Levant,\r\nand Syria, and is largely cultivated for its fruit.[148:1] These are\r\nlike Beans, full of sweet pulp, and are given in Spain and other\r\nsouthern countries to horses, pigs, and cattle, and they are\r\noccasionally imported into England for the same purpose. The Carob was\r\ncultivated in England before Shakespeare's time. \"They grow not in this\r\ncountrie,\" says Lyte, \"yet, for all that, they be sometimes in the\r\ngardens of some diligent Herboristes, but they be so small shrubbes that\r\nthey can neither bring forth flowers nor fruite.\" It was also grown by\r\nGerard, and Shakespeare may have seen it; but it is now very seldom seen\r\nin any collection, though the name is preserved among us, as the\r\njeweller's carat weight is said to have derived its name from the Carob\r\nBeans, which were used for weighing small objects.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the tree being called Locust is a little curious. Readers\r\nof the New Testament, ignorant of Eastern customs, could not understand\r\nthat St. John could feed on the insect locust, which, however, is now\r\nknown to be a common and acceptable article of food, so they looked\r\nabout for some solution of their difficulty, and decided that the\r\nLocusts were the tender shoots of the Carob tree, and that the wild\r\nhoney was the luscious juice of the Carob fruit. Having got so far it\r\nwas easy to go farther, and so the Carob soon got the names of St.\r\nJohn's Bread and St. John's Beans, and the monks of the desert showed\r\nthe very trees by which St. John's life was supported. But though the\r\nCarob tree did not produce the locusts on which St. John fed, there is\r\nlittle or no doubt that \"the husks which the swine did eat,\" and which\r\nthe Prodigal Son longed for, were the produce of the Carob tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[148:1] Pods of the Carob tree were found in a house at Pompeii. For an\r\naccount of the use of the Locust as an article of food, both in ancient\r\nand modern times, see Hogg's \"Classical Plants of Sicily,\" p. 114.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG PURPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Queen._\r\n\r\n     There with fantastic garlands did she come\r\n     Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daisies, and Long Purples,\r\n     That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\r\n     But our cold maids do Dead Men's Fingers call them.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 7 (169).\r\n\r\nIn \"Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon\" (a pretty book published a few\r\nyears ago with plates of twelve of Shakespeare's flowers) it is said\r\nthat \"there can be no doubt that the Wild Arum is the plant alluded to\r\nby Shakespeare as forming part of the nosegay of the crazed Ophelia;\"\r\nbut the authoress gives no authority for this statement, and I believe\r\nthat there can be no reasonable doubt that the Long Purples and Dead\r\nMen's Fingers are the common purple Orchises of the woods and meadows\r\n(Orchis morio, O. mascula, and O. maculata). The name of Dead Men's\r\nFingers was given to them from the pale palmate roots of some of the\r\nspecies (O. latifolia, O. maculata, and Gymnadenia conopsea), and this\r\nseems to have been its more common name.\r\n\r\n     \"Then round the meddowes did she walke,\r\n      Catching each flower by the stalke,\r\n      Such as within the meddowes grew,\r\n      As Dead Man's Thumb and Harebell blew;\r\n      And as she pluckt them, still cried she,\r\n      Alas! there's none 'ere loved like me.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _Roxburghe Ballads._\r\n\r\nAs to the other names to which the Queen alludes, we need not inquire\r\ntoo curiously; they are given in all their \"liberality\" and \"grossness\"\r\nin the old Herbals, but as common names they are, fortunately, extinct.\r\nThe name of Dead Men's Fingers still lingers in a few places, but Long\r\nPurples has been transferred to a very different plant. It is named by\r\nClare and Tennyson--\r\n\r\n     \"Gay Long-purples with its tufty spike;\r\n      She'd wade o'er shoes to reach it in the dyke.\"\r\n\r\n                              CLARE'S _Village Minstrel_, ii, 90.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Round thee blow, self-pleached deep,\r\n      Bramble Roses, faint and pale,\r\n      And Long Purples of the dale.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _A Dirge_, TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nBut in both these passages the plant intended is the Lythrum salicaria,\r\nor Purple Loosestrife.\r\n\r\nThe meadow Orchis, though so common, is thus without any common English\r\nname; for though I have often asked country people for its name, I have\r\nnever obtained one; and so it is another of those curious instances\r\nwhich are so hard to explain, where an old and common English word has\r\nbeen replaced by a Greek or Latin word, which must be entirely without\r\nmeaning to nine-tenths of those who use it.[150:1] There are similar\r\ninstances in Crocus, Cyclamen, Hyacinth, Narcissus, Anemone, Beet,\r\nLichen, Polyanthus, Polypody, Asparagus, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Orchid family is certainly the most curious in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, as it is almost the most extensive, except the Grasses. Growing\r\nall over the world, in any climate, and in all kinds of situations, it\r\nnumbers 3000 species, of which we have thirty-seven native species in\r\nEngland; and with their curious irregular flowers, often of very\r\nbeautiful colours, and of wonderful quaintness and variety of shape,\r\nthey are everywhere so distinct that the merest tyro in botany can\r\nseparate them from any other flower, and the deepest student can find\r\nendless puzzles in them, and increasing interest.\r\n\r\nThough the most beautiful are exotics, and are the chief ornaments of\r\nour stoves and hothouses, yet our native species are full of interest\r\nand beauty. Of their botanical interest we have a most convincing proof\r\nin Darwin's \"Fertilization of Orchids,\" a book that is almost entirely\r\nconfined to the British Orchids, and which, in its wonderfully clear\r\nstatements, and its laborious collection of many little facts all\r\nleading up to his scientific conclusions, is certainly not the least to\r\nbe admired among his other learned and careful books. And as to their\r\nhorticultural interest, it is most surprising that so few gardeners make\r\nthe use of them that they might. They were not so despised in\r\nShakespeare's time, for Gerard grew a large number in his garden. It is\r\ntrue that some of them are very impatient of garden cultivation,\r\nespecially those of the Ophrys section (such as the Bee, Fly, and Spider\r\nOrchises), and the rare O. hircina, which will seldom remain in the\r\ngarden above two or three years, except under very careful and peculiar\r\ncultivation. But, on the other hand, there are many that rejoice in\r\nbeing transferred to a garden, especially O. maculata, O. mascula, O.\r\npyramidalis, and the Butterfly Orchis of both kinds (Habenaria bifolia\r\nand chlorantha). These, if left undisturbed, increase in size and beauty\r\nevery year, their flowers become larger, and their leaves (in O.\r\nmaculata and O. mascula) become most beautifully spotted. They may be\r\nplaced anywhere, but their best place seems to be among low shrubs, or\r\non the rockwork. Nor must the hardy Orchid grower omit the beautiful\r\nAmerican species, especially the Cypripedia (C. spectabile, C.\r\npubescens, C. acaule, and others). They are among the most beautiful of\r\nlow hardy plants, and they succeed perfectly in any peat border that is\r\nnot too much exposed to the sun. The only caution required is to leave\r\nthem undisturbed; they resent removal and broken roots; and though I\r\nhold it to be one of the first rules of good gardening to give away to\r\nothers as much as possible, yet I would caution any one against dividing\r\nhis good clumps of Cypripedia. The probability is that both giver and\r\nreceiver will lose the plants. If, however, a plant must be divided, the\r\nwhole plant should be carefully lifted, and most gently pulled to pieces\r\nwith the help of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150:1] Though country people generally have no common name for the\r\nOrchis morio, yet it is called in works on English Botany the Fool\r\nOrchis; and it has the local names of \"Crake-feet\" in Yorkshire; of\r\n\"giddy-gander\" in Dorset; and \"Keatlegs and Neatlegs\" in Kent. Dr. Prior\r\nalso gives the names \"Goose and goslings\" and \"Gander-gooses\" for Orchis\r\nmorio, and \"Standerwort\" for Orchis mascula. This last is the\r\nAnglo-Saxon name for the flower, but it is now, I believe, quite\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE-IN-IDLENESS, _see_ PANSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Clown._\r\n\r\n     I must have Saffron to colour the warden-pies--Mace--Dates?\r\n       none.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (48).\r\n\r\nThe Mace is the pretty inner rind that surrounds the Nutmeg, when ripe.\r\nIt was no doubt imported with the Nutmeg in Shakespeare's time. (_See_\r\nNUTMEG.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Antonio._\r\n\r\n     He'ld sow't with Nettle seed.\r\n\r\n     _Sebastian._\r\n\r\n     Or Docks, or Mallows.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act ii, sc. 1 (145).\r\n\r\nThe Mallow is the common roadside weed (_Malva sylvestris_), which is\r\nnot altogether useless in medicine, though the Marsh Mallow far\r\nsurpasses it in this respect. Ben Jonson speaks of it as an article of\r\nfood--\r\n\r\n     \"The thresher . . . feeds on Mallows and such bitter herbs.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _The Fox_, act i, sc. 1.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to believe that our common Wild Mallow was so used, and\r\nJonson probably took the idea from Horace--\r\n\r\n     \"Me pascant olivæ,\r\n      Me chichorea, levesque malvæ.\"\r\n\r\nBut the common Mallow is a dear favourite with children, who have ever\r\nloved to collect, and string, and even eat its \"cheeses:\" and these\r\ncheeses are a delight to others besides children. Dr. Lindley, certainly\r\none of the most scientific of botanists, can scarcely find words to\r\nexpress his admiration of them. \"Only compare a vegetable cheese,\" he\r\nsays, \"with all that is exquisite in marking and beautiful in\r\narrangement in the works of man, and how poor and contemptible do the\r\nlatter appear. . . . Nor is it alone externally that this inimitable\r\nbeauty is to be discovered; cut the cheese across, and every slice\r\nbrings to view cells and partitions, and seeds and embryos, arranged\r\nwith an unvarying regularity, which would be past belief if we did not\r\nknow from experience, how far beyond all that the mind can conceive, is\r\nthe symmetry with which the works of Nature are constructed.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant of course the Wild Mallow has no place, though the\r\nfine-cut leaves and faint scent of the Musk Mallow (_M. moschata_) might\r\ndemand a place for it in those parts where it is not wild, and\r\nespecially the white variety, which is of the purest white, and very\r\nornamental. But our common Mallow is closely allied to some of the\r\nhandsomest plants known. The Hollyhock is one very near relation, the\r\nbeautiful Hibiscus is another, and the very handsome Fremontia\r\nCalifornica is a third that has only been added to our gardens during\r\nthe last few years. Nor is it only allied to beauty, for it also claims\r\nas a very near relation a plant which to many would be considered the\r\nmost commercially useful plant in the world, the Cotton-plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANDRAGORA, OR MANDRAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Cleopatra._\r\n\r\n     Give me to drink Mandragora.\r\n\r\n     _Charmian._\r\n\r\n                                  Why, madam?\r\n\r\n     _Cleopatra._\r\n\r\n     That I might sleep out this great gap of time,\r\n     My Antony is away.\r\n\r\n                        _Antony and Cleopatra_, act i, sc. 5 (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Iago._\r\n\r\n          Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,\r\n     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world\r\n     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n     Which thou owedst yesterday.\r\n\r\n                                 _Othello_, act iii, sc. 3 (330).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Thou Mandrake.\r\n\r\n                               _2nd Henry IV_, act i, sc. 2 (16).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Ditto._\r\n\r\n     They called him Mandrake.\r\n\r\n                                   _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 2 (338).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Suffolk._\r\n\r\n     Would curses kill, as doth the Mandrake's groan.\r\n\r\n                            _2nd Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 2 (310).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Juliet._\r\n\r\n     And shrieks like Mandrakes' torn out of the earth\r\n     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act iv, sc. 3 (47).\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no plant on which so many books and treatises\r\n(containing for the most part much sad nonsense) have been written as\r\nthe Mandrake, and there is certainly no plant round which so much\r\nsuperstition has gathered, all of which is more or less silly and\r\nfoolish, and a great deal that is worse than silly. This, no doubt,\r\narose from its first mention in connection with Leah and Rachel, and\r\nthen in the Canticles, which, perhaps, shows that even in those days\r\nsome strange qualities were attributed to the plant; but how from that\r\nbeginning such, and such wide-spread, superstitions could have arisen,\r\nit is hard to say. I can scarcely tell these superstitious fables in\r\nbetter words than Gerard described them: \"There hath been many\r\nridiculous tales brought up of this plant, whether of old wives or some\r\nrunagate surgeons or physicke-mongers I know not. . . . They adde that\r\nit is never or very seldome to be found growing naturally but under a\r\ngallowes, where the matter that has fallen from a dead body hath given\r\nit the shape of a man, and the matter of a woman the substance of a\r\nfemale plant, with many other such doltish dreams. They fable further\r\nand affirme that he who would take up a plant thereof must tie a dog\r\nthereunto to pull it up, which will give a great shreeke at the digging\r\nup, otherwise, if a man should do it, he should surely die in a short\r\nspace after.\" This, with the addition that the plant is decidedly\r\nnarcotic, will sufficiently explain all Shakespeare's references.\r\nGerard, however, omits to notice one thing which, in justice to our\r\nforefathers, should not be omitted. These fables on the Mandrake are by\r\nno means English mediæval fables, but they were of foreign extraction,\r\nand of very ancient date. Josephus tells the same story as held by the\r\nJews in his time and before his time. Columella even spoke of the plant\r\nas \"semi-homo;\" and Pythagoras called it \"Anthropomorphus;\" and Dr.\r\nDaubeny has published in his \"Roman Husbandry\" a most curious drawing\r\nfrom the Vienna MS. of Dioscorides in the fifth century, \"representing\r\nthe Goddess of Discovery presenting to Dioscorides the root of this\r\nMandrake\" (of thoroughly human shape) \"which she had just pulled up,\r\nwhile the unfortunate dog which had been employed for that purpose is\r\ndepicted in the agonies of death.\"[154:1] All these beliefs have long, I\r\nshould hope, been extinct among us; yet even now artists who draw the\r\nplant are tempted to fancy a resemblance to the human figure, and in the\r\n\"Flora Græca,\" where, for the most part, the figures of the plants are\r\nmost beautifully accurate, the figure of the Mandrake is painfully\r\nhuman.[154:2]\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant, the Mandrake is often grown, but more for its\r\ncuriosity than its beauty; the leaves appear early in the spring,\r\nfollowed very soon by its dull and almost inconspicuous flowers, and\r\nthen by its Apple-like fruit. This is the Spring Mandrake (_Mandragora\r\nvernalis_), but the Autumn Mandrake (_M. autumnalis_ or _microcarpa_)\r\nmay be grown as an ornamental plant. The leaves appear in the autumn,\r\nand are succeeded by a multitude of pale-blue flowers about the size of\r\nand very much resembling the Anemone pulsatilla (see Sweet's \"Flower\r\nGarden,\" vol. vii. No. 325). These remain in flower a long time. In my\r\nown garden they have been in flower from the beginning of November till\r\nMay. I need only add that the Mandrake is a native of the South of\r\nEurope and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean, but it was\r\nvery early introduced into England. It is named in Archbishop Ælfric's\r\n\"Vocabulary\" in the tenth century with the very expressive name of\r\n\"Earth-apple;\" it is again named in an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the\r\neleventh century (in the British Museum), but without any English\r\nequivalent; and Gerard cultivated both sorts in his garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[154:1] In the \"Bestiary of Philip de Thaun\" (12 cent.), published in\r\nWright's Popular Treatises on Science written during the Middle Ages,\r\nthe male and female Mandrake are actually reckoned among living beasts\r\n(p. 101).\r\n\r\n[154:2] For some curious early English notices of the Mandrake, see\r\n\"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" p. 324, note.

This is a well-known golden\r\nflower--\r\n\r\n     \"The wild Marsh Marigold shines like fire in swamps and hollows\r\n          gray.\"\r\n\r\n                                                        TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nAnd there is this in favour of its being the flower meant, that the name\r\nsignifies the golden blossom of the marish or marsh; but, on the other\r\nhand, the Caltha does not fulfil the conditions of Shakespeare's\r\nMarigold--it does not open and close its flowers with the sun. 2. The\r\nCorn Marigold (_Chrysanthemum segetum_), a very handsome but mischievous\r\nweed in Corn-fields, not very common in England and said not to be a\r\ntrue native, but more common in Scotland, where it is called Goulands. I\r\ndo not think this is the flower, because there is no proof, as far as I\r\nknow, that it was called Marigold in Shakespeare's time. 3. The Garden\r\nMarigold or Ruddes (_Calendula officinalis_). I have little doubt this\r\nis the flower meant; it was always a great favourite in our forefathers'\r\ngardens, and it is hard to give any reason why it should not be so in\r\nours. Yet it has been almost completely banished, and is now seldom\r\nfound but in the gardens of cottages and old farmhouses, where it is\r\nstill prized for its bright and almost everlasting flowers (looking very\r\nlike a Gazania) and evergreen tuft of leaves, while the careful\r\nhousewife still picks and carefully stores the petals of the flowers,\r\nand uses them in broths and soups, believing them to be of great\r\nefficacy, as Gerard said they were, \"to strengthen and comfort the\r\nheart;\" though scarcely perhaps rating them as high as Fuller: \"we all\r\nknow the many and sovereign vertues . . . in your leaves, the Herb\r\nGenerall in all pottage\" (\"Antheologie,\" 1655, p. 52).\r\n\r\nThe two properties of the Marigold--that it was always in flower, and\r\nthat it turned its flowers to the sun and followed his guidance in their\r\nopening and shutting--made it a very favourite flower with the poets and\r\nemblem writers. T. Forster, in the \"Circle of the Seasons,\" 1828, says\r\nthat \"this plant received the name of Calendula, because it was in\r\nflower on the calends of nearly every month. It has been called Marigold\r\nfor a similar reason, being more or less in blow at the times of all the\r\nfestivals of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the word gold having reference to\r\nits golden rays, likened to the rays of light around the head of the\r\nBlessed Virgin.\" This is ingenious, and, as he adds, \"thus say the old\r\nwriters,\" it is worth quoting, though he does not say what old writer\r\ngave this derivation, which I am very sure is not the true one. The old\r\nname is simply _goldes_. Gower, describing the burning of Leucothoe,\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n     \"She sprong up out of the molde\r\n      Into a flour, was named Golde,\r\n      Which stant governed of the Sonne.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _Conf. Aman._, lib. quint.\r\n\r\nChaucer spoke of the \"yellow Goldes;\"[157:1] in the \"Promptorium\r\nParvulorum\" we have \"Goolde, herbe, solsequium, quia sequitur solem,\r\nelitropium, calendula;\" and Spenser says--\r\n\r\n     \"And if I her like ought on earth might read\r\n      I would her liken to a crowne of Lillies,\r\n      Upon a virgin brydes adorned head,\r\n      With Roses dight and Goolds and Daffodillies.\"\r\n\r\n                                                   _Colin Clout._\r\n\r\nBut it was its other quality of opening or shutting its flowers at the\r\nsun's bidding that made the Marigold such a favourite with the old\r\nwriters, especially those who wrote on religious emblems. It was to them\r\nthe emblem of constancy in affection,[157:2] and sympathy in joy and\r\nsorrow, though it was also the emblem of the fawning courtier, who can\r\nonly shine when everything is bright. As the emblem of constancy, it was\r\nto the old writers what the Sunflower was to Moore--\r\n\r\n     \"The Sunflower turns on her god when he sets\r\n      The same look which she did when he rose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Heliotrope or Solsequium or Turnesol of our forefathers, and\r\nis the flower often alluded to under that name.[158:1] \"All yellow\r\nflowers,\" says St. Francis de Sales, \"and, above all, those that the\r\nGreeks call Heliotrope, and we call Sunflower, not only rejoice at the\r\nsight of the sun, but follow with loving fidelity the attraction of its\r\nrays, gazing at the sun, and turning towards it from its rising to its\r\nsetting\" (\"Divine Love,\" Mulholland's translation).\r\n\r\nOf this higher and more religious use of the emblematic flower there are\r\nfrequent examples. I will only give one from G. Withers, a contemporary\r\nof Shakespeare's later life--\r\n\r\n     \"When with a serious musing I behold\r\n      The grateful and obsequious Marigold,\r\n      How duly every morning she displays\r\n      Her open breast when Phœbus spreads his rays;\r\n      How she observes him in his daily walk,\r\n      Still bending towards him her small slender stalk;\r\n      How when he down declines she droops and mourns,\r\n      Bedewed, as 'twere, with tears till he returns;\r\n      And how she veils her flowers when he is gone.\r\n      When this I meditate, methinks the flowers\r\n      Have spirits far more generous than ours,\r\n      And give us fair examples to despise\r\n      The servile fawnings and idolatries\r\n      Wherewith we court these earthly things below,\r\n      Which merit not the service we bestow.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Withers the poets treated the Marigold very much as the\r\ngardeners did--they passed it by altogether as beneath their notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157:1]\r\n\r\n     \"That werud of yolo Guldes a garland.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _The Knightes Tale._\r\n\r\n[157:2]\r\n\r\n     \"You the Sun to her must play,\r\n      She to you the Marigold,\r\n      To none but you her leaves unfold.\"\r\n\r\n                       MIDDLETON AND ROWLEY, _The Spanish Gipsy_.\r\n\r\nSee also Thynne's \"Emblems,\" No. 18; and Cutwode's \"Caltha Poetarum,\"\r\n1599, st. 18, 19.\r\n\r\n[158:1] \"Solsequium vel heliotropium; Solsece vel sigel-hwerfe\" (_i.e._,\r\nsun-seeker or sun-turner).--ÆLFRIC'S _Vocabulary_.\r\n\r\n\"Marigolde; solsequium, sponsa solis.\"--_Catholicon Anglicum._\r\n\r\nIn a note Mr. Herttage says, \"the oldest name for the plant was\r\n_ymbglidegold_, that which moves round with the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n                   Here's flowers for you;\r\n     Hot Lavender, Mints, Savory, Marjoram.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (103).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Lear._\r\n\r\n     Give the word.\r\n\r\n     _Edgar._\r\n\r\n                    Sweet Marjoram.\r\n\r\n     _Lear._\r\n                                    Pass.\r\n\r\n                                 _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 6 (93).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3)\r\n\r\n     The Lily I condemned for thy hand,\r\n     And buds of Marjoram had stolen thy hair.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Sonnet_ xcix.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Indeed, sir, she was the sweet Marjoram of the Salad, or\r\n       rather the Herb-of-grace.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act iv, sc. 5 (17).\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare's time several species of Marjoram were grown, especially\r\nthe Common Marjoram (_Origanum vulgare_), a British plant, the Sweet\r\nMarjoram (_O. Marjorana_), a plant of the South of Europe, from which\r\nthe English name comes,[159:1] and the Winter Marjoram (_O.\r\nHoracleoticum_). They were all favourite pot herbs, so that Lyte calls\r\nthe common one \"a delicate and tender herb,\" \"a noble and odoriferous\r\nplant;\" but, like so many of the old herbs, they have now fallen into\r\ndisrepute. The comparison of a man's hair to the buds of Marjoram is not\r\nvery intelligible, but probably it was a way of saying that the hair was\r\ngolden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159:1] See \"Catholicon Anglicum,\" s.v.

It is mentioned in the early\r\nvocabularies, and Chaucer gives it a very prominent place in his\r\ndescription of a beautiful garden--\r\n\r\n     \"I was aware of the fairest Medler tree\r\n      That ever yet in alle my life I sie,\r\n      As ful of blossomes as it might be;\r\n      Therein a goldfinch leaping pretile\r\n      Fro' bough to bough, and as him list, he eet\r\n      Here and there of buddes and floweres sweet.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _The Flower and the Leaf_ (240).\r\n\r\nAnd certainly a fine Medlar tree \"ful of blossomes\" is a handsome\r\nornament on any lawn. There are few deciduous trees that make better\r\nlawn trees. There is nothing stiff about the growth even from its early\r\nyouth; it forms a low, irregular, picturesque tree, excellent for\r\nshade, with very handsome white flowers, followed by the curious fruit;\r\nit will not, however, do well in the North of England or Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to have been a favourite fruit with our forefathers.\r\nBullein says \"the fruite called the Medler is used for a medicine and\r\nnot for meate;\" and Shakespeare only used the common language of his\r\ntime when he described the Medlar as only fit to be eaten when rotten.\r\nChaucer said just the same--\r\n\r\n     \"That ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers\r\n      Till it be rote in mullok or in stree--\r\n      We olde men, I drede, so fare we,\r\n      Till we be roten, can we not be rype.\"\r\n\r\n                                               _The Reeves Tale._\r\n\r\nAnd many others writers to the same effect. But, in fact, the Medlar\r\nwhen fit to be eaten is no more rotten than a ripe Peach, Pear, or\r\nStrawberry, or any other fruit which we do not eat till it has reached a\r\ncertain stage of softness. There is a vast difference between a ripe and\r\na rotten Medlar, though it would puzzle many of us to say when a fruit\r\n(not a Medlar only) is ripe, that is, fit to be eaten. These things are\r\nmatters of taste and fashion, and it is rather surprising to find that\r\nwe are accused, and by good judges, of eating Peaches when rotten rather\r\nthan ripe. \"The Japanese always eat their Peaches in an unripe state. In\r\nthe 'Gartenflora' Dr. Regel says, in some remarks on Japanese fruit\r\ntrees, that the Japanese regard a ripe Peach as rotten.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a few varieties of the Medlar, differing in the size and\r\nflavour of the fruits, which were also cultivated in Shakespeare's time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[160:1] So Chester speaks of it as \"the Young Man's Medlar\" (\"Love's\r\nMartyr,\" p. 96, New Sh. Soc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n               Here's flowers for you;\r\n     Hot Lavender, Mints, Savory, Marjoram.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (103).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Armado._\r\n\r\n     I am that flower,\r\n\r\n     _Dumain._\r\n\r\n                       That Mint.\r\n\r\n     _Longaville._\r\n\r\n                                  That Columbine.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (661).\r\n\r\nThe Mints are a large family of highly-perfumed, strong-flavoured\r\nplants, of which there are many British species, but too well known to\r\ncall for any further description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTLETOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Tamora._\r\n\r\n     The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,\r\n     O'ercome with Moss and baleful Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n                          _Titus Andronicus_, act ii, sc. 3 (94).\r\n\r\nThe Mistletoe was a sore puzzle to our ancestors, almost as great a\r\nmystery as the Fern. While they admired its fresh, evergreen branches,\r\nand pretty transparent fruit, and used it largely in the decoration of\r\ntheir houses at Christmas, they looked on the plant with a certain awe.\r\nSomething of this, no doubt, arose from its traditional connection with\r\nthe Druids, which invested the plant with a semi-sacred character, as a\r\nplant that could drive away evil spirits; yet it was also looked upon\r\nwith some suspicion, perhaps also arising from its use by our heathen\r\nancestors, so that, though admitted into houses, it was not (or very\r\nseldom) admitted into churches. And this character so far still attaches\r\nto the Mistletoe, that it is never allowed with the Holly and Ivy and\r\nBox to decorate the churches, and Gay's lines were certainly written in\r\nerror--\r\n\r\n     \"Now with bright Holly all the temples strow,\r\n      With Laurel green and sacred Mistletoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe mystery attaching to the Mistletoe arose from the ignorance as to\r\nits production. It was supposed not to grow from its seeds, and how it\r\nwas produced was a fit subject for speculation and fable. Virgil tells\r\nthe story thus--\r\n\r\n     \"Quale solet sylvis brumali frigore viscum\r\n      Fronde virere novâ, quod non sua seminat arbos,\r\n      Et croceo fœtu teretes circumdare truncos.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _Æneid_, vi, 205.\r\n\r\nIn this way Virgil elegantly veils his ignorance, but his commentator in\r\nthe eighteenth century (Delphic Classics) tells the tale without any\r\ndoubts as to its truth. \"Non nascitur e semine proprio arboris, at neque\r\nex insidentum volucrum fimo, ut putavere veteres, sed ex ipso arborum\r\nvitali excremento.\" This was the opinion of the great Lord Bacon; he\r\nridiculed the idea that the Mistletoe was propagated by the operation of\r\na bird as an idle tradition, saying that the sap which produces the\r\nplant is such as \"the tree doth excerne and cannot assimilate,\" and\r\nBrowne (\"Vulgar Errors\") was of the same opinion. But the opposite\r\nopinion was perpetuated in the very name (\"Mistel: fimus, muck,\"\r\nCockayne),[163:1] and was held without any doubt by most of the writers\r\nin Shakespeare's time--\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the oak, the plumb-tree and the holme,\r\n      The stock-dove and the blackbird should not come,\r\n      Whose mooting on the trees does make to grow\r\n      Rots-curing hyphear, and the Mistletoe.\"\r\n\r\n                                      BROWNE, _Brit. Past._ i, 1.\r\n\r\nSo that we need not blame Gerard when he boldly said that \"this\r\nexcrescence hath not any roote, neither doth encrease himselfe of his\r\nseed, as some have supposed, but it rather commethe of a certaine\r\nmoisture gathered together upon the boughes and joints of the trees,\r\nthrough the barke whereof this vaporous moisture proceeding bringeth\r\nforth the Misseltoe.\" We now know that it is produced exclusively from\r\nthe seeds probably lodged by the birds, and that it is easily grown and\r\ncultivated. It will grow and has been found on almost any deciduous\r\ntree, preferring those with soft bark, and growing very seldom on the\r\nOak.[163:2] Those who wish for full information upon the proportionate\r\ndistribution of the Mistletoe on different British trees will find a\r\ngood summary in \"Notes and Queries,\" vol. iii. p. 226.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163:1] \"_Mistel_ est a _mist_ stercus, quod ex stercore avium\r\npronascitur, nec aliter pronasci potest.\"--WACHTER, _Glossary_ (quoted\r\nin \"Notes and Queries,\" 3rd series, vii. 157. In the same volume are\r\nseveral papers on the origin of the word). Dr. Prior derives it from\r\n_mistl_ (different), and _tan_ (twig), being so unlike the tree it grows\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n[163:2] Mistletoe growing on an oak had a special legendary value. Its\r\nrarity probably gave it value in the eyes of the Druids, and much later\r\nit had its mystic lore. \"By sitting upon a hill late in a evening, near\r\na Wood, in a few nights a fire drake will appeare, mark where it\r\nlighteth, and then you shall find an oake with Mistletoe thereon, at the\r\nRoot whereof there is a Misle-childe, whereof many strange things are\r\nconceived. _Beati qui non crediderunt._\"--PLAT., _Garden of Eden_, 1659,\r\nNo. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Adriana._\r\n\r\n     If ought possess thee from me, it is dross,\r\n     Usurping Ivy, Brier, or idle Moss.\r\n\r\n                         _Comedy of Errors_, act ii, sc. 2 (179).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Tamora._\r\n\r\n     The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,\r\n     O'ercome with Moss and baleful Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n                          _Titus Andronicus_, act ii, sc. 3 (94).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Apemantus._\r\n\r\n                      These Moss'd trees\r\n     That have outlived the eagle.\r\n\r\n                          _Timon of Athens_, act iv, sc. 3 (223).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Hotspur._\r\n\r\n     Steeples and Moss-grown towers.\r\n\r\n                             _1st Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 1 (33).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Oliver._\r\n\r\n     Under an Oak whose boughs were Moss'd with age,\r\n     And high top bald with dry antiquity.\r\n\r\n                           _As You Like It_, act iv, sc. 3 (105).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n                  The ruddock would,\r\n     With charitable bill,\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  bring thee all this;\r\n     Yea, and furr'd Moss besides, when flowers are none,\r\n     To winter-ground thy corse.\r\n\r\n                         _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (224).[164:1]\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the pretty notice of Moss in the last passage (6), we\r\nshould be inclined to say that Shakespeare had as little regard for\r\n\"idle Moss\" as for the \"baleful Mistletoe.\" In his day Moss included all\r\nthe low-growing and apparently flowerless carpet plants which are now\r\ndivided into the many families of Mosses, Lichens, Club Mosses,\r\nHepaticæ, Jungermanniæ, &c., &c. And these plants, though holding no\r\nrank in the eyes of a florist, are yet deeply interesting, perhaps no\r\nfamily of plants more so, to those who have time and patience to study\r\nthem. The Club Mosses, indeed, may claim a place in the garden if they\r\ncan only be induced to grow, but that is a difficult task, and the\r\ntenderer Lycopodiums are always favourites when well grown among\r\ngreenhouse Ferns; but for the most part, the Mosses must be studied in\r\ntheir native haunts, and when so studied, they are found to be full of\r\nbeauty and of wonderful construction. Nor are they without use, and it\r\nis rather strange that Shakespeare should have so markedly called them\r\n\"idle,\" or useless, considering that in his day many medical virtues\r\nwere attributed to them. This reputation for medical virtues they have\r\nnow all lost, except the Iceland Moss, which is still in use for\r\ninvalids; but the Mosses have other uses. The Reindeer Moss (_Cladonia\r\nrangiferina_) and Roch-hair (_Alectoria jubata_) are indispensable to\r\nthe Laplander as food for his reindeer, and Usnea florida is used in\r\nNorth America as food for cattle; the Iceland Moss (_Cetraria\r\nIslandica_) is equally indispensable as an article of food to all the\r\ninhabitants of the extreme North; and the Tripe de la Roche (_Gyrophora\r\ncylindrica_) has furnished food to the Arctic explorers when no other\r\nfood could be obtained; while many dyes are produced from the Lichens,\r\nespecially the Cudbear (a most discordant corruption of the name of the\r\ndiscoverer, Mr. Cuthbert), which is the produce of the Rock Moss\r\n(_Lecanora tartarea_). So that even to us the Mosses have their uses,\r\neven if they do not reach the uses that they have in North Sweden,\r\nwhere, according to Miss Bremer, \"the forest, which is the countryman's\r\nworkshop, is his storehouse, too. With the various Lichens that grow\r\nupon the trees and rocks, he cures the virulent diseases with which he\r\nis sometimes afflicted, dyes the articles of clothes which he wears, and\r\npoisons the noxious and dangerous animals which annoy him.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the beauty of Mosses and Lichens we have only to ask any\r\nartist or go into any exhibition of pictures. Their great beauty\r\nhas been so lovingly described by Ruskin (\"Modern Painters\"), that\r\nno one can venture to do more than quote his description. It is well\r\nknown to many, but none will regret having it called to their\r\nremembrance--\"placuit semel--decies repetita placebit\"--space, however,\r\nwill oblige me somewhat to curtail it. \"Meek creatures! the first mercy\r\nof the earth, veiling with hushed softness its dentless rocks: creatures\r\nfull of pity, covering with strange and tender honour the sacred\r\ndisgrace of ruin, laying quiet fingers on the trembling stones to teach\r\nthem rest. No words that I know of will say what these Mosses are; none\r\nare delicate enough, none perfect enough, none rich enough.. . . . They\r\nwill not be gathered like the flowers for chaplet or love token; but of\r\nthese the wild bird will make its nest and the wearied child its pillow,\r\nand as the earth's first mercy so they are its last gift to us. When all\r\nother service is vain from plant and tree, the soft Mosses and grey\r\nLichens take up their watch by the headstone. The woods, the blossoms,\r\nthe gift-bearing Grasses have done their parts for a time, but these do\r\nservice for ever. Trees for the builder's yard, flowers for the bride's\r\nchamber, Corn for the granary, Moss for the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[164:1] There may be special appropriateness in the selection of the\r\n\"furr'd Moss\" to \"winter-ground thy corse.\" \"The final duty of Mosses is\r\nto die; the main work of other leaves is in their life, but these have\r\nto form the earth, out of which other leaves are to grow.\"--RUSKIN,\r\n_Proserpina_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULBERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Feed him with Apricocks and Dewberries,\r\n     With purple Grapes, green Figs, and Mulberries.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 1 (169).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Volumnia._\r\n\r\n                    Thy stout heart,\r\n     Now humble as the ripest Mulberry\r\n     That will not bear the handling.\r\n\r\n                               _Coriolanus_, act iii, sc. 2 (78).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Prologue._\r\n\r\n     Thisby tarrying in Mulberry shade.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act v, sc. 1 (149).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Wooer._\r\n\r\n                       Palamon is gone\r\n     Is gone to the wood to gather Mulberries.\r\n\r\n                         _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1 (87).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5)\r\n\r\n     The birds would bring him Mulberries and ripe-red Cherries.\r\n\r\n                                       _Venus and Adonis_ (1103).\r\n                                                (_See_ CHERRIES.)\r\n\r\nWe do not know when the Mulberry, which is an Eastern tree, was\r\nintroduced into England, but probably very early. We find in Archbishop\r\nÆlfric's \"Vocabulary,\" \"morus vel rubus, mor-beam,\" but it is doubtful\r\nwhether that applies to the Mulberry or Blackberry, as in the same\r\ncatalogue Blackberries are mentioned as \"flavi vel mori, blace-berian.\"\r\nThere is no doubt that Morum was a Blackberry as well as a Mulberry in\r\nclassical times. Our Mulberry is probably the fruit mentioned by\r\nHorace--\r\n\r\n                        \"Ille salubres\r\n     Æstates peraget, qui nigris prandia Moris\r\n     Finiet ante gravem quæ legerit arbore solem.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _Sat._ ii, 4, 24.\r\n\r\nAnd it certainly is the fruit mentioned by Ovid--\r\n\r\n     \"In duris hærentia mora rubetis.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _Metam._, i, 105.\r\n\r\nIn the Dictionarius of John de Garlande (thirteenth century)[167:1] we\r\nfind, \"Hec sunt nomina silvestrium arborum, qui sunt in luco magistri\r\nJohannis; quercus cum fago, pinus cum lauro, celsus gerens celsa;\" and\r\nMr. Wright translates \"celsa\" by \"Mulberries,\" without, however, giving\r\nhis authority for this translation.[167:2] But whenever introduced, it\r\nhad been long established in England in Shakespeare's time.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a common tree even in Anglo-Saxon times, for the\r\nfavourite drink, Morat, was a compound of honey flavoured with\r\nMulberries (Turner's \"Anglo-Saxons\").[167:3] Spenser spoke of it--\r\n\r\n     \"With love juice stained the Mulberie,\r\n      The fruit that dewes the poet's braine.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     _Elegy_, 18.\r\n\r\nGerard describes it as \"high and full of boughes,\" and growing in sundry\r\ngardens in England, and he grew in his own London garden both the Black\r\nand the White Mulberry. Lyte also, before Gerard, describes it and says:\r\n\"It is called in the fayning of Poetes the wisest of all other trees,\r\nfor this tree only among all others bringeth forth his leaves after the\r\ncold frostes be past;\" and the Mulberry Garden, often mentioned by the\r\nold dramatists, \"occupied the site of the present Buckingham Palace and\r\nGardens, and derived its name from a garden of Mulberry trees planted by\r\nKing James I. in 1609, in which year 935_l._ was expended by the king in\r\nthe planting of Mulberry trees near the Palace of Westminster.\"[168:1]\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental tree for any garden, the Mulberry needs no\r\nrecommendation, being equally handsome in shape, in foliage, and in\r\nfruit. It is a much prized ornament in all old gardens, so that it has\r\nbeen well said that an old Mulberry tree on the lawn is a patent of\r\nnobility to any garden; and it is most easy of cultivation; it will bear\r\nremoval when of a considerable size, and so easily can it be propagated\r\nfrom cuttings that a story is told of Mr. Payne Knight that he cut large\r\nbranches from a Mulberry tree to make standards for his clothes-lines,\r\nand that each standard took root, and became a flourishing Mulberry\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThough most of us only know of the common White or Black Mulberry, yet,\r\nwhere it is grown for silk culture (as it is now proposed to grow it in\r\nEngland, with a promised profit of from £70 to £100 per acre for the\r\nsilk, and an additional profit of from £100 to £500 per acre from the\r\ngrain (eggs)!!), great attention is paid to the different varieties; so\r\nthat M. de Quatrefuges briefly describes six kinds cultivated in one\r\nvalley in France, and Royle remarks, \"so many varieties have been\r\nproduced by cultivation that it is difficult to ascertain whether they\r\nall belong to one species; they are,\" as he adds, \"nearly as numerous as\r\nthose of the silkworm\" (Darwin).\r\n\r\nWe have good proof of Shakespeare's admiration of the Mulberry in the\r\ncelebrated Shakespeare Mulberry growing in his garden at New Place at\r\nStratford-on-Avon. \"That Shakespeare planted this tree is as well\r\nauthenticated as anything of that nature can be, . . . and till this was\r\nplanted there was no Mulberry tree in the neighbourhood. The tree was\r\ncelebrated in many a poem, one especially by Dibdin, but about 1752,\r\nthe then owner of New Place, the Rev. Mr. Gastrell, bought and pulled\r\ndown the house, and wishing, as it should seem, to be 'damned to\r\neverlasting fame,' he had some time before cut down Shakespeare's\r\ncelebrated Mulberry tree, to save himself the trouble of showing it to\r\nthose whose admiration of our great poet led them to visit the poetick\r\nground on which it stood.\"--MALONE. The pieces were made into many\r\nsnuff-boxes[169:1] and other mementoes of the tree.\r\n\r\n     \"The Mulberry tree was hung with blooming wreaths;\r\n      The Mulberry tree stood centre of the dance;\r\n      The Mulberry tree was hymn'd with dulcet strains;\r\n      And from his touchwood trunk the Mulberry tree\r\n      Supplied such relics as devotion holds\r\n      Still sacred, and preserves with pious care.\"\r\n\r\n                                         COWPER, _Task_, book vi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[167:1] The Dictionarius of John de Garlande is published in Wright's\r\n\"Vocabularies.\" His garden was probably in the neighbourhood of Paris,\r\nbut he was a thorough Englishman, and there is little doubt that his\r\ndescription of a garden was drawn as much from his English as from his\r\nFrench experience.\r\n\r\n[167:2] The authority may be in the \"Promptorium Parvulorum:\" \"Mulberry,\r\nMorum (selsus).\"\r\n\r\n[167:3] \"Moratum potionis genus, f. ex vino et moris dilutis\r\nconfectæ.\"--_Glossarium Adelung._\r\n\r\n[168:1] Cunningham's \"Handbook of London,\" p. 346, with many quotations\r\nfrom the old dramatists.\r\n\r\n[169:1] Some of these snuff-boxes were inscribed with the punning motto\r\n\"Memento Mori.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n                You demi-puppets, that\r\n     By moonshine do the greensour ringlets make,\r\n     Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\r\n     Is to make midnight Mushrooms.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act v, sc. 1 (36).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Fairy._\r\n\r\n     I do wander everywhere.\r\n     Swifter than the moon's sphere;\r\n     And I serve the fairy queen,\r\n     To dew her orbs upon the green.\r\n\r\n                    _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act ii, sc. 1 (6).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Quickly._\r\n\r\n     And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,\r\n     Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:\r\n     The expressure that it bears, green let it be,\r\n     More fertile-fresh than all the field to see.\r\n\r\n                                _Merry Wives_, act v, sc. 5 (69).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Ajax._\r\n\r\n     Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.\r\n\r\n                      _Troilus and Cressida_, act ii, sc. 1 (22).\r\n\r\nThe three first passages, besides the notice of the Mushroom, contain\r\nalso the notice of the fairy-rings, which are formed by fungi, though\r\nprobably Shakespeare knew little of this. No. 4 names the Toadstool, and\r\nthe four passages together contain the whole of Shakespeare's fungology,\r\nand it is little to be wondered at that he has not more to say on these\r\ncurious plants. In his time \"Mushrumes or Toadstooles\" (they were all\r\nclassed together) were looked on with very suspicious eyes, though they\r\nwere so much eaten that we frequently find in the old herbals certain\r\nremedies against \"a surfeit of Mushrooms.\" Why they should have been\r\nconnected with toads has never been explained, but it was always so--\r\n\r\n     \"The grieslie Todestoole growne there mought I see,\r\n      And loathed paddocks lording on the same.\"--SPENSER.\r\n\r\nThey were associated with other loathsome objects besides toads, for\r\n\"Poisonous Mushrooms groweth where old rusty iron lieth, or rotten\r\nclouts, or neere to serpent's dens or rootes of trees that bring forth\r\nvenomous fruit.[170:1]. . . Few of them are good to be eaten, and most\r\nof them do suffocate and strangle the eater. Therefore, I give my advice\r\nunto those that love such strange and new-fangled meates to beware of\r\nlicking honey among thornes, lest the sweetnesse of one do not\r\ncounteracte the sharpnesse and pricking of the other.\" This was Gerard's\r\nprudent advice on the eating of \"Mushrumes and Toadstooles,\" but\r\nnowadays we know better. The fungologists tell us that those who refuse\r\nto eat any fungus but the Mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_) are not only\r\nfoolish in rejecting most delicate luxuries, but also very wrong in\r\nwasting most excellent and nutritious food. Fungologists are great\r\nenthusiasts, and it may be well to take their prescription _cum grano\r\nsalis_; but we may qualify Gerard's advice by the well-known\r\nenthusiastic description of Dr. Badham, who certainly knew much more of\r\nfungology than Gerard, and did not recommend to others what he had not\r\npersonally tried himself. After praising the beauty of an English\r\nautumn, even in comparison with Italy, he thus concludes his pleasant\r\nand useful book, \"The Esculent Funguses of England\": \"I have myself\r\nwitnessed whole hundredweights of rich, wholesome diet rotting under\r\ntrees, woods teeming with food, and not one hand to gather it. . . . I\r\nhave, indeed, grieved when I reflected on the straitened conditions of\r\nthe lower orders to see pounds innumerable of extempore beefsteaks\r\ngrowing on our Oaks in the shape of _Fistula hepatica_; _Ag. fusipes_,\r\nto pickle in clusters under them; _Puffballs_, which some of our friends\r\nhave not inaptly compared to sweet-bread for the rich delicacy of their\r\nunassisted flavour; _Hydna_, as good as oysters, which they very much\r\nresemble in taste; _Agaricus deliciosus_, reminding us of tender lamb's\r\nkidneys: the beautiful yellow _Chantarelle_, that _kalon kagathon_ of\r\ndiet, growing by the bushel, and no basket but our own to pick up a few\r\nspecimens in our way; the sweet nutty-flavoured _Boletus_, in vain\r\ncalling himself _edulis_ when there was none to believe him; the dainty\r\n_Orcella_; the _Ag. hetherophyllus_, which tastes like the crawfish when\r\ngrilled; the _Ag. ruber_ and _Ag. virescens_, to cook in any way, and\r\nequally good in all.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the fairy rings (Nos. 1, 2, and 3) a great amount of legendary\r\nlore was connected with them. Browne notices them--\r\n\r\n                        \"A pleasant mead\r\n     Where fairies often did their measures tread,\r\n     Which in the meadows makes such circles green\r\n     As if with garlands it had crowned been.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _Britannia's Pastorals._\r\n\r\nCowley said--\r\n\r\n     \"Where once such fairies dance,\r\n        No grass does ever grow;\"\r\n\r\nand in Shakespeare's time the sheep refused to eat the grass on the\r\nfairy rings (1); I believe they now feed on it, but I have not been able\r\nto ascertain this with certainty. Others, besides the sheep, avoided\r\nthem. \"When the damsels of old gathered may-dew on the grass, which they\r\nmade use of to improve their complexions, they left undisturbed such of\r\nit as they perceived on the fairy rings, apprehensive that the fairies\r\nshould in revenge destroy their beauty, nor was it reckoned safe to put\r\nthe foot within the rings, lest they should be liable to fairies'\r\npower.\"--DOUCE'S _Illustrations_, p. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[170:1] Herrick calls them \"brownest Toadstones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSK ROSES, _see_ ROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Doll._\r\n\r\n     They say Poins has a good wit.\r\n\r\n     _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick as\r\n       Tewksbury Mustard; there is no more conceit in him than in a\r\n       mallet.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (260).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Pease-blossom!

But the\r\nfollowing from an Anglo-Saxon Leech-book seems to speak of it as used\r\nexactly in the modern fashion. After mentioning several ingredients in a\r\nrecipe for want of appetite for meat, it says: \"Triturate all\r\ntogether--eke out with vinegar as may seem fit to thee, so that it may\r\nbe wrought into the form in which Mustard is tempered for flavouring,\r\nput it then into a glass vessel, and then with bread, or with whatever\r\nmeat thou choose, lap it with a spoon, that will help\" (\"Leech Book,\"\r\nii. 5, Cockayne's translation). And Parkinson's account is to the same\r\neffect: \"The seeds hereof, ground between two stones, fitted for the\r\npurpose, and called a quern, with some good vinegar added to it to make\r\nit liquid and running, is that kind of Mustard that is usually made of\r\nall sorts to serve as sauce both for fish and flesh.\" And to the same\r\neffect the \"Boke of Nurture\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Yet make moche of Mustard, and put it not away,\r\n      For with every dische he is dewest who so lust to assay.\"\r\n\r\n                                                        (L. 853).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Euphronius._\r\n\r\n     I was of late as petty to his ends\r\n     As is the morn-dew on the Myrtle-leaf\r\n     To his grand sea.\r\n\r\n                     _Antony and Cleopatra_, act iii, sc. 12 (8).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Isabella._\r\n\r\n                        Merciful Heaven,\r\n     Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\r\n     Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled Oak\r\n     Than the soft Myrtle.\r\n\r\n                      _Measure for Measure_, act ii, sc. 2 (114).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3)\r\n\r\n     Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her,\r\n     Under a Myrtle shade began to woo him.\r\n\r\n                                      _Passionate Pilgrim_ (143).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4)\r\n\r\n     Then sad she hasteth to a Myrtle grove.\r\n\r\n                                        _Venus and Adonis_ (865).\r\n\r\nMyrtle is of course the English form of _myrtus_; but the older English\r\nname was Gale, a name which is still applied to the bog-myrtle.[174:1]\r\nThough a most abundant shrub in the South of Europe, and probably\r\nintroduced into England before the time of Shakespeare, the myrtle was\r\nonly grown in a very few places, and was kept alive with difficulty, so\r\nthat it was looked upon not only as a delicate and an elegant rarity,\r\nbut as the established emblem of refined beauty. In the Bible it is\r\nalways associated with visions and representations of peacefulness and\r\nplenty, and Milton most fitly uses it in the description of our first\r\nparents' \"blissful bower\"--\r\n\r\n                              \"The roofe\r\n     Of thickest covert was inwoven shade,\r\n     Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew\r\n     Of firm and fragrant leaf.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _Paradise Lost_, iv.\r\n\r\nIn heathen times the Myrtle was dedicated to Venus, and from this arose\r\nthe custom in mediæval times of using the flowers for bridal garlands,\r\nwhich thus took the place of Orange blossoms in our time.\r\n\r\n     \"The lover with the Myrtle sprays\r\n      Adorns his crisped cresses.\"\r\n\r\n                                       DRAYTON, _Muse's Elysium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"And I will make thee beds of Roses,\r\n      And a thousand fragrant posies,\r\n      A cap of flowers, and a kirtle\r\n      Embroidered o'er with leaves of Myrtle.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _Roxburghe Ballads._\r\n\r\nAs a garden shrub every one will grow the Myrtle that can induce it to\r\ngrow. There is no difficulty in its cultivation, provided only that the\r\nclimate suits it, and the climate that suits it best is the\r\nneighbourhood of the sea. Virgil describes the Myrtles as \"amantes\r\nlittora myrtos,\" and those who have seen the Myrtle as it grows on the\r\nDevonshire and Cornish coasts will recognise the truth of his\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174:1] \"Gayle; mirtus.\"--_Catholicon Anglicum_, p. 147, with note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCISSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Emilia._\r\n\r\n     This garden has a world of pleasures in't,\r\n     What flowre is this?\r\n\r\n     _Servant._\r\n\r\n                          'Tis called Narcissus, madam.\r\n\r\n     _Emilia._\r\n\r\n     That was a faire boy certaine, but a foole,\r\n     To love himselfe; were there not maides enough?\r\n\r\n                        _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act ii, sc. 2 (130).\r\n\r\n_See_ DAFFODILS, p. 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Cordelia._\r\n\r\n     Crown'd with rank Fumiter and Furrow-weeds,\r\n     With Burdocks, Hemlock, Nettles, Cuckoo-flowers.\r\n\r\n                                 _King Lear_, act iv, sc. 4.

We have two native\r\nspecies (Urtica urens and U. dioica) with sufficiently strong qualities,\r\nbut we have a third (U. pilulifera) very curious in its manner of\r\nbearing its female flowers in clusters of compact little balls, which is\r\nfar more virulent than either of our native species, and is said by\r\nCamden to have been introduced by the Romans to chafe their bodies when\r\nfrozen by the cold of Britain. The story is probably quite apocryphal,\r\nbut the plant is an alien, and only grows in a few places.\r\n\r\nBoth the Latin and English names of the plant record its qualities.\r\nUrtica is from _uro_, to burn; and Nettle is (etymologically) the same\r\nword as needle, and the plant is so named, not for its stinging\r\nqualities, but because at one time the Nettle supplied the chief\r\ninstrument of sewing; not the instrument which holds the thread, and to\r\nwhich we now confine the word needle, but the thread itself, and very\r\ngood thread it made. The poet Campbell says in one of his letters--\"I\r\nhave slept in Nettle sheets, and dined off a Nettle table-cloth, and I\r\nhave heard my mother say that she thought Nettle cloth more durable than\r\nany other linen.\" It has also been used for making paper, and for both\r\nthese purposes, as well as for rope-making, the Rhea fibre of the\r\nHimalaya, which is simply a gigantic Nettle (_Urtica_ or _Böhmeria\r\nnivea_), is very largely cultivated. Nor is the Nettle to be despised as\r\nan article of food.[177:1] In many parts of England the young shoots are\r\nboiled and much relished. In 1596 Coghan wrote of it: \"I will speak\r\nsomewhat of the Nettle that Gardeners may understand what wrong they do\r\nin plucking it for the weede, seeing it is so profitable to many\r\npurposes. . . . Cunning cookes at the spring of the yeare, when Nettles\r\nfirst bud forth, can make good pottage with them, especially with red\r\nNettles\" (\"Haven of Health,\" p. 86). In February, 1661, Pepys made the\r\nentry in his diary--\"We did eat some Nettle porridge, which was made on\r\npurpose to-day for some of their coming, and was very good.\" Andrew\r\nFairservice said of himself--\"Nae doubt I should understand my trade of\r\nhorticulture, seeing I was bred in the Parish of Dreepdaily, where they\r\nraise lang Kale under glass, and force the early Nettles for their\r\nspring Kale\" (\"Rob Roy,\" c. 7). Gipsies are said to cook it as an\r\nexcellent vegetable, and M. Soyer tried hard, but almost in vain, to\r\nrecommend it as a most dainty dish. Having so many uses, we are not\r\nsurprised to find that it has at times been regularly cultivated as a\r\ngarden crop, so that I have somewhere seen an account of tithe of\r\nNettles being taken; and in the old churchwardens' account of St.\r\nMichael's, Bath, is the entry in the year 1400, \"Pro Urticis venditis ad\r\nLawrencium Bebbe, 2d.\"\r\n\r\nNettles are much used in the neighbourhood of London to pack plums and\r\nother fruit with bloom on them, so that in some market gardens they are\r\nnot only not destroyed, but encouraged, and even cultivated. And this\r\nis an old practice; Lawson's advice in 1683 was--\"For the gathering of\r\nall other stone-fruit, as Nectarines, Apricots, Peaches, Pear-plums,\r\nDamsons, Bullas, and such like, . . . in the bottom of your large sives\r\nwhere you put them, you shall lay Nettles, and likewise in the top, for\r\nthat will ripen those that are most unready\" (\"New Orchard,\" p. 96).\r\n\r\nThe \"Nettle of India\" (No. 5) has puzzled the commentators. It is\r\nprobably not the true reading; if the true reading, it may only mean a\r\nNettle of extra-stinging quality; but it may also mean an Eastern plant\r\nthat was used to produce cowage, or cow-itch. \"The hairs of the pods of\r\nMucuna pruriens, &c., constitute the substance called cow-itch, a\r\nmechanical Anthelmintic.\"--LINDLEY. This plant is said to have been\r\ncalled the Nettle of India, but I do not find it so named in\r\nShakespeare's time.\r\n\r\nIn other points the Nettle is a most interesting plant. Microscopists\r\nfind in it most beautiful objects for the microscope; entomologists\r\nvalue it, for it is such a favourite of butterflies and other insects,\r\nthat in Britain alone upwards of thirty insects feed solely on the\r\nNettle plant, and it is one of those curious plants which mark the\r\nprogress of civilization by following man wherever he goes.[178:1]\r\n\r\nBut as a garden plant the only advice to be given is to keep it out of\r\nthe garden by every means. In good cultivated ground it becomes a sad\r\nweed if once allowed a settlement. The Himalayan Böhmerias, however, are\r\nhandsome, but only for their foliage; and though we cannot, perhaps,\r\nadmit our roadside Dead Nettles, which however are much handsomer than\r\nmany foreign flowers which we carefully tend and prize, yet the Austrian\r\nDead Nettle (_Lamium orvala_, \"Bot. Mag.,\" v. 172) may be well admitted\r\nas a handsome garden plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176:1] This a modern reading; the correct reading is \"metal.\"\r\n\r\n[177:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis\r\n      Vivis et Urtica.\"--HORACE, _Ep._ i, 10, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Mihi festa luce coquatar Urtica.\"--PERSIUS vi, 68.\r\n\r\n[178:1] \"L'ortie s'établit partout dans les contrées temperées à la\r\nsuite de l'homme pour disparaitre bientôt si le lieu on elle s'est ainsi\r\nimplanteè cesse d'etre habité.\"--M.

There are the historical Oaks\r\nconnected with the names of William Rufus, Queen Elizabeth, and Charles\r\nII.; there are the wonderful Oaks of Wistman's Wood (certainly the most\r\nweird and most curious wood in England, if not in Europe); there are the\r\nmany passages in which our old English writers have loved to descant on\r\nthe Oaks of England as the very emblems of unbroken strength and\r\nunflinching constancy; there is all the national interest which has\r\nlinked the glories of the British navy with the steady and enduring\r\ngrowth of her Oaks; there is the wonderful picturesqueness of the great\r\nOak plantations of the New Forest, the Forest of Dean, and other royal\r\nforests; and the equally, if not greater, picturesqueness of the English\r\nOak as the chief ornament of our great English parks; there is the\r\nscientific interest which suggested the growth of the Oak for the plan\r\nof our lighthouses, and many other interesting points. It is very\r\ntempting to stop on each and all of these, but the space is too limited,\r\nand they can all be found ably treated of and at full length in any of\r\nthe books that have been written on the English forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\r\n     Of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Vetches, Oats, and Pease.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Spring Song._\r\n\r\n     When shepherds pipe on Oaten straws.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (913).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Bottom._\r\n\r\n     Truly a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry Oats.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (35).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Grumio._\r\n\r\n     Ay, sir, they be ready; the Oats have eaten the horses.\r\n\r\n                     _Taming of the Shrew_, act iii, sc. 2 (207).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _First Carrier._\r\n\r\n     Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of Oats rose--it was\r\n       the death of him.\r\n\r\n                              _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 1 (13).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Captain._\r\n\r\n     I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried Oats,\r\n     If it be man's work, I'll do it.\r\n\r\n                                  _King Lear_, act v, sc. 3 (38).\r\n\r\nShakespeare's Oats need no comment, except to note that the older\r\nEnglish name for Oats was Haver (_see_ \"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" p. 372;\r\nand \"Catholicon Anglicum,\" p. 178, with the notes).

Miller gives 1648 as the\r\nearliest date he could discover, at which time it was grown in the\r\nOxford Botanic Garden. But I have no doubt it was cultivated long before\r\nthat. Parkinson knew it as an English tree in 1640, for he says: \"It\r\nflowereth in the beginning of summer in the warmer countries, but very\r\nlate _with us_; the fruite ripeneth in autumne in Spain, &c., but\r\nseldome _with us_\" (\"Herball,\" 1640). Gerard had an Oleaster in his\r\ngarden in 1596, which Mr. Jackson considers to have been the Olea\r\nEuropea, and with good reason, as in his account of the Olive in the\r\n\"Herbal\" he gives Oleaster as one of the synonyms of Olea sylvestris,\r\nthe wild Olive tree. But I think its introduction is of a still earlier\r\ndate. In the Anglo-Saxon \"Leech Book,\" of the tenth century, published\r\nunder the direction of the Master of the Rolls, I find this\r\nprescription: \"Pound Lovage and Elder rind and Oleaster, that is, wild\r\nOlive tree, mix them with some clear ale and give to drink\" (book i. c.\r\n37, Cockayne's translation). As I have never heard that the bark of the\r\nOlive tree was imported, it is only reasonable to suppose that the\r\nleeches of the day had access to the living tree. If this be so, the\r\ntree was probably imported by the Romans, which they are very likely to\r\nhave done. But it seems very certain that it was in cultivation in\r\nEngland in Shakespeare's time and he may have seen it growing.\r\n\r\nBut in most of the eight passages in which he names the Olive, the\r\nreference to it is mainly as the recognized emblem of peace; and it is\r\nin that aspect, and with thoughts of its touching Biblical associations\r\nthat we must always think of the Olive. It is _the_ special plant of\r\nhonour in the Bible, by \"whose fatness they honour God and man,\" linked\r\nwith the rescue of the one family in the ark, and with the rescue of the\r\nwhole family of man in the Mount of Olives. Every passage in which it is\r\nnamed in the Bible tells the uniform tale of its usefulness, and the\r\nemblematical lessons it was employed to teach; but I must not dwell on\r\nthem. Nor need I say how it was equally honoured by Greeks and Romans.\r\nAs a plant which produced an abundant and necessary crop of fruit with\r\nlittle or no labour (φύτευμ' ἀχείρωτον ἀυτόποιον, Sophocles; \"non ulla\r\nest oleis cultura,\" Virgil), it was looked upon with special pride, as\r\none of the most blessed gifts of the gods, and under the constant\r\nprotection of Minerva, to whom it was thankfully dedicated.[186:1]\r\n\r\nWe seldom see the Olive in English gardens, yet it is a good evergreen\r\ntree to cover a south wall, and having grown it for many years, I can\r\nsay that there is no plant--except, perhaps, the Christ's Thorn--which\r\ngives such universal interest to all who see it. It is quite hardy,\r\nthough the winter will often destroy the young shoots; but not even the\r\nwinter of 1860 did any serious mischief, and fine old trees may\r\noccasionally be seen which attest its hardiness. There is one at Hanham\r\nHall, near Bristol, which must be of great age. It is at least 30ft.\r\nhigh, against a south wall, and has a trunk of large girth; but I never\r\nsaw it fruit or flower in England until this year (1877), when the Olive\r\nin my own garden flowered, but did not bear fruit. Miller records trees\r\nat Campden House, Kensington, which, in 1719, produced a good number of\r\nfruit large enough for pickling, and other instances have been recorded\r\nlately. Perhaps if more attention were paid to the grafting, fruit would\r\nfollow. The Olive has the curious property that it seems to be a matter\r\nof indifference whether, as with other fruit, the cultivated sort is\r\ngrafted on the wild one, or the wild on the cultivated one; the latter\r\nplan was certainly sometimes the custom among the Greeks and Romans, as\r\nwe know from St. Paul (Romans xi. 16-25) and other writers, and it is\r\nsometimes the custom now. There are a great number of varieties of the\r\ncultivated Olive, as of other cultivated fruit.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the Olive is not more grown as a garden tree is that it\r\nis a tree very little admired by most travellers. Yet this is entirely a\r\nmatter of taste, and some of the greatest authorities are loud in its\r\npraises as a picturesque tree. One short extract from Ruskin's account\r\nof the tree will suffice, though the whole description is well worth\r\nreading. \"The Olive,\" he says, \"is one of the most characteristic and\r\nbeautiful features of all southern scenery. . . . What the Elm and the\r\nOak are to England, the Olive is to Italy. . . . It had been well for\r\npainters to have felt and seen the Olive tree, to have loved it for\r\nChrist's sake; . . . to have loved it even to the hoary dimness of its\r\ndelicate foliage, subdued and faint of hue, as if the ashes of the\r\nGethsemane agony had been cast upon it for ever; and to have traced line\r\nby line the gnarled writhing of its intricate branches, and the pointed\r\nfretwork of its light and narrow leaves, inlaid on the blue field of the\r\nsky, and the small, rosy-white stars of its spring blossoming, and the\r\nheads of sable fruit scattered by autumn along its topmost boughs--the\r\nright, in Israel, of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow--and,\r\nmore than all, the softness of the mantle, silver-grey, and tender, like\r\nthe down on a bird's breast, with which far away it veils the undulation\r\nof the mountains.\"--_Stones of Venice_, vol. iii. p. 176.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[186:1] _See_ Spenser's account of the first introduction of the Olive\r\nin \"Muiopotmos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Bottom._\r\n\r\n     And, most dear actors, eat no Onions nor\r\n     Garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 2 (42).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Lafeu._\r\n\r\n     Mine eyes smell Onions, I shall weep anon:\r\n     Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act v, sc. 3 (321).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Enobarbus._\r\n\r\n     Indeed the tears live in Onion that should water this Sorrow.\r\n\r\n                      _Antony and Cleopatra_, act i, sc. 2 (176).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Enobarbus._\r\n\r\n           Look, they weep,\r\n     And I, an ass, am Onion-eyed.\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 2 (34).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Lord._\r\n\r\n     And if the boy have not a woman's gift\r\n     To rain a shower of commanded tears,\r\n     An Onion will do well for such a shift,\r\n     Which in a napkin being close conveyed\r\n     Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.\r\n\r\n                   _Taming of the Shrew_, Induction, sc. 1 (124).\r\n\r\nThere is no need to say much of the Onion in addition to what I have\r\nalready said on the Garlick and Leek, except to note that Onions seem\r\nalways to have been considered more refined food than Leek and Garlick.\r\nHomer makes Onions an important part of the elegant little repast which\r\nHecamede set before Nestor and Machaon--\r\n\r\n     \"Before them first a table fair she spread,\r\n      Well polished and with feet of solid bronze;\r\n      On this a brazen canister she placed,\r\n      And Onions as a relish to the wine,\r\n      And pale clear honey and pure Barley meal.\"\r\n\r\n                    _Iliad_, book xi. (Lord Derby's translation).\r\n\r\nBut in the time of Shakespeare they were not held in such esteem.\r\nCoghan, writing in 1596, says of them: \"Being eaten raw, they engender\r\nall humourous and corruptible putrifactions in the stomacke, and cause\r\nfearful dreames, and if they be much used they snarre the memory and\r\ntrouble the understanding\" (\"Haven of Health,\" p. 58).\r\n\r\nThe name comes directly from the French _oignon_, a bulb, being the bulb\r\n_par excellence_, the French name coming from the Latin _unio_, which\r\nwas the name given to some species of Onion, probably from the bulb\r\ngrowing singly. It may be noted, however, that the older English name\r\nfor the Onion was Ine, of which we may perhaps still have the\r\nremembrance in the common \"Inions.\" The use of the Onion to promote\r\nartificial crying is of very old date, Columella speaking of \"lacrymosa\r\ncæpe,\" and Pliny of \"cæpis odor lacrymosus.\" There are frequent\r\nreferences to the same use in the old English writers.\r\n\r\nThe Onion has been for so many centuries in cultivation that its native\r\nhome has been much disputed, but it has now \"according to Dr. Regel\r\n('Gartenflora,' 1877, p. 264) been definitely determined to be the\r\nmountains of Central Asia.

The Orange is a native of the\r\nEast Indies, and no certain date can be given for its introduction into\r\nEurope. Under the name of the Median Apple a tree is described first by\r\nTheophrastus, and then by Virgil and Palladius, which is supposed by\r\nsome to be the Orange; but as they all describe it as unfit for food, it\r\nis with good reason supposed that the tree referred to is either the\r\nLemon or Citron. Virgil describes it very exactly--\r\n\r\n     \"Ipsa ingens arbor, faciemque simillima lauro\r\n      Et si non alium late jactaret odorem\r\n      Laurus erat; folia hand ullis labentia ventis\r\n      Flos ad prima tenax.\"--_Georgic_ ii, 131.\r\n\r\nDr. Daubeny, who very carefully studied the plants of classical writers,\r\ndecides that the fruit here named is the Lemon, and says that it \"is\r\nnoticed only as a foreign fruit, nor does it appear that it was\r\ncultivated at that time in Italy, for Pliny says it will only grow in\r\nMedia and Assyria, though Palladius in the fourth century seems to have\r\nbeen familiar with it, and it was known in Greece at the time of\r\nTheophrastus.\" But if Oranges were grown in Italy or Greece in the time\r\nof Pliny and Palladius, they did not continue in cultivation. Europe\r\nowes the introduction or reintroduction to the Portuguese, who brought\r\nthem from the East, and they were grown in Spain in the eleventh\r\ncentury. The first notice of them in Italy was in the year 1200, when a\r\ntree was planted by St. Dominic at Rome. The first grown in France is\r\nsaid to have been the old tree which lived at the Orangery at\r\nVersailles till November, 1876, and was called the Grand Bourbon. \"In\r\n1421 the Queen of Navarre gave the gardener the seed from Pampeluna;\r\nhence sprang the plant, which was subsequently transported to Chantilly.\r\nIn 1532 the Orange tree was sent to Fontainebleau, whence, in 1684,\r\nLouis XIV. transferred it to Versailles, where it remained the largest,\r\nfinest, and most fertile member of the Orangery, its head being 17yds.\r\nround.\" It is not likely that a tree of such beauty should be growing so\r\nnear England without the English gardeners doing their utmost to\r\nestablish it here. But the first certain record is generally said to be\r\nin 1595, when (on the authority of Bishop Gibson) Orange trees were\r\nplanted at Beddington, in Surrey, the plants being raised from seeds\r\nbrought into England by Sir Walter Raleigh. The date, however, may be\r\nplaced earlier, for in Lyte's \"Herbal\" (1578) it is stated that \"In this\r\ncountrie the Herboristes do set and plant the Orange trees in there\r\ngardens, but they beare no fruite without they be wel kept and defended\r\nfrom cold, and yet for all that they beare very seldome.\" There are no\r\nOranges in Gerard's catalogue of 1596, and though he describes the trees\r\nin his \"Herbal,\" he does not say that he then grew them or had seen them\r\ngrowing. But by 1599 he had obtained them, for they occur in his\r\ncatalogue of that date under the name of \"Malus orantia, the Arange or\r\nOrange tree,\" so that it is certainly very probable that Shakespeare may\r\nhave seen the Orange as a living tree.\r\n\r\nAs to the beauty of the Orange tree, there is but one opinion. Andrew\r\nMarvel described it as--\r\n\r\n                  \"The Orange bright,\r\n     Like golden lamps in a green night.\"\r\n\r\n                                                      _Bermudas._\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert drew a lesson from its power of constant fruiting--\r\n\r\n     \"Oh that I were an Orenge tree,\r\n          That busie plant;\r\n      Then should I ever laden be,\r\n          And never want\r\n      Some fruit for him that dressed me.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    _Employment._\r\n\r\nAnd its handsome evergreen foliage, its deliciously scented flowers,\r\nand its golden fruit--\r\n\r\n     \"A fruit of pure Hesperian gold\r\n        That smelled ambrosially\"--\r\n\r\n                                                        TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nat once demand the admiration of all. It only fails in one point to make\r\nit a plant for every garden: it is not fully hardy in England. It is\r\nvery surprising to read of those first trees at Beddington, that \"they\r\nwere planted in the open ground, under a movable covert during the\r\nwinter months; that they always bore fruit in great plenty and\r\nperfection; that they grew on the south side of a wall, not nailed\r\nagainst it, but at full liberty to spread; that they were 14ft. high,\r\nthe girth of the stem 29in., and the spreading of the branches one way\r\n9ft., and 12ft. another; and that they so lived till they were entirely\r\nkilled by the great frost in 1739-40.\"--MILLER.[191:1] These trees must\r\nhave been of a hardy variety, for certainly Orange trees, even with such\r\nprotection, do not now so grow in England, except in a few favoured\r\nplaces on the south coast. There is one species which is fairly hardy,\r\nthe Citrus trifoliata, from Japan,[191:2] forming a pretty bush with\r\nsweet flowers, and small but useless fruit (seldom, I believe, produced\r\nout-of-doors); it is often used as a stock on which to graft the better\r\nkinds, but perhaps it might be useful for crossing, so as to give its\r\nhardiness to a variety with better flower and fruit.\r\n\r\nCommercially the Orange holds a high place, more than 20,000 good fruit\r\nhaving been picked from one tree, and England alone importing about\r\n2,000,000 bushels annually. These are almost entirely used as a dessert\r\nfruit and for marmalade, but it is curious that they do not seem to have\r\nbeen so used when first imported. Parkinson makes no mention of their\r\nbeing eaten raw, but says they \"are used as sauce for many sorts of\r\nmeats, in respect of the sweet sourness giving a relish and delight\r\nwhereinsoever they are used;\" and he mentions another curious use, no\r\nlonger in fashion, I believe, but which might be worth a trial: \"The\r\nseeds being cast into the grounde in the spring time will quickly grow\r\nup, and when they are a finger's length high, being pluckt up and put\r\namong Sallats, will give them a marvellous fine aromatick or spicy tast,\r\nvery acceptable.\"[192:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191:1] In an \"Account of Gardens Round London in 1691,\" published in\r\nthe \"Archæologia,\" vol. xii., these Orange trees are described as if\r\nalways under glass.\r\n\r\n[191:2] \"Bot.

The true\r\nOxlip (P. elatior of Jacquin) is an eastern counties' plant; while the\r\ncommon forms of the Oxlip are hybrids between the Cowslip and Primrose.\r\n(_See_ COWSLIP and PRIMROSE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALM TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Rosalind._\r\n\r\n     Look here what I found on a Palm tree.\r\n\r\n                          _As You Like It_, act iii, sc. 2 (185).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Hamlet._\r\n\r\n     As love between them like the Palm might flourish.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act v, sc. 2 (40).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Volumnia._\r\n\r\n     And bear the Palm for having bravely shed\r\n     Thy wife and children's blood.\r\n\r\n                                _Coriolanus_, act v, sc. 3 (117).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Cassius._\r\n\r\n     And bear the Palm alone.\r\n\r\n                              _Julius Cæsar_, act i, sc. 2 (131).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Painter._\r\n\r\n     You shall see him a Palm in Athens again, and flourish with\r\n       the highest.\r\n\r\n                            _Timon of Athens_, act v, sc. 1 (12).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6)\r\n\r\n     _The Vision._--Enter, solemnly tripping one after another,\r\n       six personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their\r\n       heads garlands of Bays, and golden vizards on their faces,\r\n       branches of Bays or Palm in their hands.\r\n\r\n                                     _Henry VIII_, act iv, sc. 2.\r\n\r\nTo these passages may be added the following, in which the Palm tree is\r\ncertainly alluded to though it is not mentioned by name--\r\n\r\n     _Sebastian._\r\n\r\n                   That in Arabia\r\n     There is one tree, the Phœnix' throne; one Phœnix\r\n     At this hour reigning there.\r\n\r\n                           _Tempest_, act iii, sc. 3 (22).[193:1]\r\n\r\nAnd from the poem by Shakespeare, published in Chester's \"Love's\r\nMartyr,\" 1601.\r\n\r\n     \"Let the bird of loudest lay\r\n        On the sole Arabian tree\r\n        Herald sad and Trumpet be,\r\n      To whose sound chaste wings obey.\"\r\n\r\nTwo very distinct trees are named in these passages. In the last five\r\nthe reference is to the true Palm of Biblical and classical fame, as the\r\nemblem of victory, and the typical representation of life and beauty in\r\nthe midst of barren waste and deserts. And we are not surprised at the\r\nveneration in which the tree was held, when we consider either the\r\nwonderful grace of the tree, or its many uses in its native countries,\r\nso many, that Pliny says that the Orientals reckoned 360 uses to which\r\nthe Palm tree could be applied. Turner, in 1548, said: \"I never saw any\r\nperfit Date tree yet, but onely a little one that never came to\r\nperfection;\"[194:1] and whether Shakespeare ever saw a living Palm tree\r\nis doubtful, but he may have done so. (_See_ DATE.) Now there are a\r\ngreat number grown in the large houses of botanic and other gardens, the\r\nPalm-house at Kew showing more and better specimens than can be seen in\r\nany other collection in Europe: even the open garden can now boast of a\r\nfew species that will endure our winters without protection. Chamærops\r\nhumilis and Fortunei seem to be perfectly hardy, and good specimens may\r\nbe seen in several gardens; Corypha australis is also said to be quite\r\nhardy, and there is little doubt but that the Date Palm (_Phœnix\r\ndactylifera_), which has long been naturalized in the South of Europe,\r\nwould live in Devonshire and Cornwall, and that of the thousand species\r\nof Palms growing in so many different parts of the world, some will yet\r\nbe found that may grow well in the open air in England.\r\n\r\nBut the Palm tree in No. 1 is a totally different tree, and much as\r\nShakespeare has been laughed at for placing a Palm tree in the Forest of\r\nArden, the laugh is easily turned against those who raise such an\r\nobjection. The Palm tree of the Forest of Arden is the\r\n\r\n                \"Satin-shining Palm\r\n     On Sallows in the windy gleams of March\"--\r\n\r\n                                    _Idylls of the King_--Vivien.\r\n\r\nthat is, the Early Willow (_Salix caprea_) and I believe it is so called\r\nall over England, as it is in Northern Germany, and probably in other\r\nnorthern countries. There is little doubt that the name arose from the\r\ncustom of using the Willow branches with the pretty golden catkins on\r\nPalm Sunday as a substitute for Palm branches.\r\n\r\n     \"In Rome upon Palm Sunday they bear true Palms,\r\n      The Cardinals bow reverently and sing old Psalms;\r\n      Elsewhere those Psalms are sung 'mid Olive branches,\r\n      The Holly branch supplies the place among the avalanches;\r\n      More northern climes must be content with the sad Willow.\"\r\n\r\n                                       GOETHE (quoted by Seeman).\r\n\r\nBut besides Willow branches, Yew branches are sometimes used for the\r\nsame purpose, and so we find Yews called Palms. Evelyn says they were so\r\ncalled in Kent; they are still so called in Ireland, and in the\r\nchurchwarden's accounts of Woodbury, Devonshire, is the following entry:\r\n\"Memorandum, 1775. That a Yew or Palm tree was planted in the\r\nchurchyard, ye south side of the church, in the same place where one was\r\nblown down by the wind a few days ago, this 25th of November.\"[195:1]\r\n\r\nHow Willow or Yew branches could ever have been substituted for such a\r\nvery different branch as a Palm it is hard to say, but in lack of a\r\nbetter explanation, I think it not unlikely that it might have arisen\r\nfrom the direction for the Feast of Tabernacles in Leviticus xxiii. 40:\r\n\"Ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, the\r\nbranches of Palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and Willows of\r\nthe brook.\" But from whatever cause the name and the custom was derived,\r\nthe Willow was so named in very early times, and in Shakespeare's time\r\nthe name was very common. Here is one instance among many--\r\n\r\n     \"Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day,\r\n      The Palms and May make country houses gay,\r\n      And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay--\r\n      Cuckoo, jug-jug, pee-we, to-witta-woo.\"\r\n\r\n                                              T. NASH. 1567-1601.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[193:1] I do not include among \"Palms\" the passage in _Hamlet_, act i,\r\nsc. 1: \"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,\" because I bow to\r\nArchdeacon Nares' judgment that \"palmy\" here means \"grown to full\r\nheight, in allusion to the palms of the stag's horns, when they have\r\nattained to their utmost growth.\" He does not, however, decide this with\r\ncertainty, and the question may be still an open one.\r\n\r\n[194:1] \"Names of Herbes,\" s.v. Palma.\r\n\r\n[195:1] In connection with this, Turner's account of the Palm in 1538 is\r\nworth quoting: \"Palmā arborem in anglia nunq' me vidisse memini.

The\r\nAnglo-Saxon name was Banwort or Bonewort, though why such a name was\r\ngiven to it we cannot now say. Nor can we satisfactorily explain its\r\ncommon names of Pansy or Pawnce (from the French, _pensées_--\"that is,\r\nfor thoughts,\" says Ophelia), or Heart's-ease,[196:1] which name was\r\noriginally given to the Wallflower. The name Cupid's flower seems to be\r\npeculiar to Shakespeare, but the other name, Love-in-idle, or idleness,\r\nis said to be still in use in Warwickshire, and signifies love in vain,\r\nor to no purpose, as in Chaucer: \"The prophet David saith; If God ne\r\nkepe not the citee, in ydel waketh he that keptit it.\"[196:2] And in\r\nTyndale's translation of the New Testament, \"I have prechid to you, if\r\nye holden, if ye hav not bileved ideli\" (1 Cor. xv. 2). \"Beynge\r\nplenteuous in werk of the Lord evermore, witynge that youre traveil is\r\nnot idel in the Lord\" (1 Cor. xv. 58).\r\n\r\nBut beside these more common names, Dr. Prior mentions the following:\r\n\"Herb Trinity, Three faces under a hood, Fancy, Flamy,[197:1] Kiss me,\r\nCull me or Cuddle me to you, Tickle my fancy, Kiss me ere I rise, Jump\r\nup and kiss me, Kiss me at the garden gate, Pink of my John, and several\r\nmore of the same amatory character.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser gives the flower a place in his \"Royal aray\" for Elisa--\r\n\r\n     \"Strowe me the grounde with Daffadowndillies,\r\n      And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies,\r\n            The pretie Pawnce,\r\n            And the Chevisaunce\r\n      Shall match with the fayre Flower Delice.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another place he speaks of the \"Paunces trim\"--_F. Q._, iii. 1.\r\nMilton places it in Eve's couch--\r\n\r\n                  \"Flowers were the couch,\r\n     Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,\r\n     And Hyacinth, earth's freshest, softest lap.\"\r\n\r\nHe names it also as part of the wreath of Sabrina--\r\n\r\n     \"Pansies, Pinks, and gaudy Daffadils;\"\r\n\r\nand as one of the flowers to strew the hearse of Lycidas--\r\n\r\n     \"The White Pink and the Pansie streaked with jet,\r\n      The glowing Violet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[196:1] \"The Pansie Heart's ease Maiden's call.\"--DRAYTON _Ed._, ix.\r\n\r\n[196:2] And again--\r\n\r\n     \"The other heste of hym is this,\r\n      Take not in ydel my name or amys.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _Pardeners Tale._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Eterne God, that through thy purveance\r\n      Ledest this world by certein governance,\r\n      In idel, as men sein, ye nothinge make.\"\r\n\r\n                                          _The Frankelynes Tale._\r\n\r\n[197:1] \"Flamy, because its colours are seen in the flame of\r\nwood.\"--_Flora Domestica_, 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Biondello._\r\n\r\n     I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the\r\n       garden for Parsley to stuff a rabbit.\r\n\r\n                        _Taming of the Shrew_, act iv, sc 4 (99).\r\n\r\nParsley is the abbreviated form of Apium petroselinum, and is a common\r\nname to many umbelliferous plants, but the garden Parsley is the one\r\nmeant here. This well-known little plant has the curious botanic history\r\nthat no one can tell what is its native country. In 1548 Turner said,\r\n\"Perseley groweth nowhere that I knowe, but only in gardens.\"[198:1] It\r\nis found in many countries, but is always considered an escape from\r\ncultivation. Probably the plant has been so altered by cultivation as to\r\nhave lost all likeness to its original self.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers seem to have eaten the parsley _root_ as well as the\r\nleaves--\r\n\r\n     \"Quinces and Peris ciryppe with Parcely rotes\r\n        Right so bygyn your mele.\"\r\n\r\n                                RUSSELL'S _Boke of Nurture_, 826.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Peres and Quynces in syrupe with Percely rotes.\"\r\n\r\n                            WYNKYN DE WORDE'S _Boke of Kervynge_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198:1] \"Names of Herbes,\" s.v.

Botanically the Peach is closely allied to the Almond, and\r\nstill more closely to the Apricot and Nectarine; indeed, many writers\r\nconsider both the Apricot and Nectarine to be only varieties of the\r\nPeach.\r\n\r\nThe native country of the Peach is now ascertained to be China, and\r\nnot Persia, as the name would imply. It probably came to the Romans\r\nthrough Persia, and was by them introduced into England. It occurs in\r\nArchbishop's Ælfric's \"Vocabulary\" in the tenth century, \"Persicarius,\r\nPerseoctreow;\" and John de Garlande grew it in the thirteenth century,\r\n\"In virgulto Magistri Johannis, pessicus fert pessica.\" It is named in\r\nthe \"Promptorium Parvulorum\" as \"Peche, or Peske, frute--Pesca Pomum\r\nPersicum;\" and in a note the Editor says: \"In a role of purchases for\r\nthe Palace of Westminster preserved amongst the miscellaneous record of\r\nthe Queen's remembrance, a payment occurs, Will le Gardener, pro iij\r\nkoygnere, ij pichere iij_s._--pro groseillere iij_d_, pro j peschere\r\nvj_d._\" A.D. 1275, 4 Edw: 1--\r\n\r\nWe all know and appreciate the fruit of the Peach, but few seem to know\r\nhow ornamental a tree is the Peach, quite independent of the fruit. In\r\nthose parts where the soil and climate are suitable, the Peach may be\r\ngrown as an ornamental spring flowering bush. When so grown preference\r\nis generally given to the double varieties, of which there are several,\r\nand which are not by any means the new plants that they are generally\r\nsupposed to be, as they were cultivated both by Gerard and Parkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were\r\n       as crest-fallen as a dried Pear.\r\n\r\n                   _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act iv, sc. 5 (101).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Parolles._\r\n\r\n     Your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French\r\n       withered Pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a\r\n       withered Pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a\r\n       withered Pear.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act i, sc. 1 (174).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     I must have Saffron to colour the Warden pies.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (48).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Mercutio._\r\n\r\n     O, Romeo . . . thou a Poperin Pear.\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act ii, sc. 1 (37).\r\n\r\nIf we may judge by these few notices, Shakespeare does not seem to have\r\nhad much respect for the Pear, all the references to the fruit being\r\nmore or less absurd or unpleasant. Yet there were good Pears in his day,\r\nand so many different kinds that Gerard declined to tell them at length,\r\nfor \"the stocke or kindred of Pears are not to be numbered; every\r\ncountry hath his peculiar fruit, so that to describe them apart were to\r\nsend an owle to Athens, or to number those things that are without\r\nnumber.\"\r\n\r\nOf these many sorts Shakespeare mentions by name but two, the Warden and\r\nthe Poperin, and it is not possible to identify these with modern\r\nvarieties with any certainty. The Warden was probably a general name for\r\nlarge keeping and stewing Pears, and the name was said to come from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _wearden_, to keep or preserve, in allusion to its lasting\r\nqualities. But this is certainly a mistake. In an interesting paper by\r\nMr. Hudson Turner, \"On the State of Horticulture in England in early\r\ntimes, chiefly previous to the fifteenth century,\" printed in the\r\n\"Archæological Journal,\" vol. v. p. 301, it is stated that \"the Warden\r\nPear had its origin and its name from the horticultural skill of the\r\nCistercian Monks of Wardon Abbey in Bedfordshire, founded in the twelfth\r\ncentury. Three Warden Pears appeared in the armorial bearings of the\r\nAbbey.\"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly an early name. In the \"Catholicon Anglicum\" we find: \"A\r\nParmayn, volemum, Anglice, a Warden;\" and in Parkinson's time the name\r\nwas still in use, and he mentions two varieties, \"The Warden or\r\nLukewards Pear are of two sorts, both white and red, both great and\r\nsmall.\" (The name of Lukewards seems to point to St. Luke's Day, October\r\n18, as perhaps the time either for picking the fruit or for its\r\nripening.) \"The Spanish Warden is greater than either of both the\r\nformer, and better also.\" And he further says: \"The Red Warden and the\r\nSpanish Warden are reckoned amongst the most excellent of Pears, either\r\nto bake or to roast, for the sick or for the sound--and indeed the\r\nQuince and the Warden are the only two fruits that are permitted to the\r\nsick to eat at any time.\" The Warden pies of Shakespeare's day, coloured\r\nwith Saffron, have in our day been replaced by stewed Pears coloured\r\nwith Cochineal.[200:1]\r\n\r\nI can find no guide to the identification of the Poperin Pear, beyond\r\nParkinson's description: \"The summer Popperin and the winter Popperin,\r\nboth of them very good, firm, dry Pears, somewhat spotted and brownish\r\non the outside. The green Popperin is a winter fruit of equal goodnesse\r\nwith the former.\" It was probably a Flemish Pear, and may have been\r\nintroduced by the antiquary Leland, who was made Rector of Popering by\r\nHenry VIII. The place is further known to us as mentioned by Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"A knyght was fair and gent\r\n      In batail and in tornament,\r\n        His name was Sir Thopas.\r\n      Alone he was in fer contre,\r\n      In Flaundres, all beyonde the se,\r\n        At Popering in the place.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden tree the Pear is not only to be grown for its fruit, but as\r\na most ornamental tree. Though the individual flowers are not, perhaps,\r\nso handsome as the Apple blossoms, yet the growth of the tree is far\r\nmore elegant; and an old Pear tree, with its curiously roughened bark,\r\nits upright, tall, pyramidal shape, and its sheet of snow-white\r\nblossoms, is a lovely ornament in the old gardens and lawns of many of\r\nour country houses. It is by some considered a British tree, but it is\r\nprobably only a naturalized foreigner, originally introduced by the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200:1] The Warden was sometimes spoken of as different from Pears. Sir\r\nHugh Platt speaks of \"Wardens _or_ Pears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\r\n     Of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Vetches, Oats, and Pease.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Carrier._\r\n\r\n     Peas and Beans are as dank here as a dog.\r\n\r\n                               _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 1 (9).\r\n                                                   (_See_ BEANS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Biron._\r\n\r\n     This fellow picks up wit, as pigeons Pease.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (315).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Bottom._\r\n\r\n     I had rather have a handful or two of dried Peas.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (41).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Fool._\r\n\r\n     That a shealed Peascod?\r\n\r\n                                 _King Lear_, act i, sc. 4 (219).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Touchstone._\r\n\r\n     I remember the wooing of a Peascod instead of her.\r\n\r\n                            _As You Like It_, act ii, sc. 4 (51).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Malvolio._\r\n\r\n     Not yet old enough to be a man, nor young enough for a boy; as\r\n       a Squash is before 'tis a Peascod, or a Codling when 'tis\r\n       almost an Apple.\r\n\r\n                             _Twelfth Night_, act i, sc. 5 (165).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Hostess._\r\n\r\n     Well, fare thee well!

Peas or\r\nPease (the Anglicised form of Pisum) is the singular, of which the\r\nplural is Peason. \"Pisum is called in Englishe a Pease;\" says Turner--\r\n\r\n     \"Alle that for me thei doo pray,\r\n      Helpeth me not to the uttermost day\r\n      The value of a Pese.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _The Child of Bristowe_, p. 570.\r\n\r\nAnd the word was so used in and after Shakespeare's time, as by Ben\r\nJonson--\r\n\r\n     \"A pill as small as a pease.\"--_Magnetic Lady._\r\n\r\nThe Squash is the young Pea, before the Peas are formed in it, and the\r\nPeascod is the ripe shell of the Pea before it is shelled.[202:1] The\r\ngarden Pea (_Pisum sativum_) is the cultivated form of a plant found in\r\nthe South of Europe, but very much altered by cultivation. It was\r\nprobably not introduced into England as a garden vegetable long before\r\nShakespeare's time. It is not mentioned in the old lists of plants\r\nbefore the sixteenth century, and Fuller tells us that in Queen\r\nElizabeth's time they were brought from Holland, and were \"fit dainties\r\nfor ladies, they came so far and cost so dear.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful ornamental Peas (Sweet Peas, Everlasting Peas, &c.) are of\r\ndifferent family (Lathyrus, not Pisum), but very closely allied. There\r\nis a curious amount of folklore connected with Peas, and in every case\r\nthe Peas and Peascods are connected with wooing the lasses. This\r\nexplains Touchstone's speech (No. 6). Brand gives several instances of\r\nthis, from which one stanza from Browne's \"Pastorals\" may be quoted--\r\n\r\n     \"The Peascod greene, oft with no little toyle,\r\n      He'd seek for in the fattest, fertil'st soile,\r\n      And rend it from the stalke to bring it to her,\r\n      And in her bosom for acceptance wooe her.\"\r\n\r\n                                                 Book ii, song 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[202:1] The original meaning of Peascod is a bag of peas.

It is, like all the\r\npepperworts, a native of the Tropics, but was well known both to the\r\nGreeks and Romans. By the Greeks it was probably not much used, but in\r\nRome it seems to have been very common, if we may judge by Horace's\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n     \"Deferar in vicum, vendentem thus et odores,\r\n      Et piper, et quidquid chartis amicitur ineptis.\"\r\n\r\n                                            _Epistolæ_ ii, 1-270.\r\n\r\nAnd in another place he mentions \"Pipere albo\" as an ingredient in\r\ncooking. Juvenal mentions it as an article of commerce, \"piperis coemti\"\r\n(Sat. xiv. 293). Persius speaks of it in more than one passage, and\r\nPliny describes it so minutely that he evidently not only knew the\r\nimported spice, but also had seen the living plant. By the Romans it was\r\nprobably introduced into England, being frequently met with in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Leech-books. It is mentioned by Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"And in an erthen pot how put is al,\r\n      And salt y-put in and also Paupere.\"\r\n\r\n                              _Prologue of the Chanoune's Yeman._\r\n\r\nIt was apparently, like Ginger, a very common condiment in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, and its early introduction into England as an article of commerce\r\nis shown by passages in our old law writers, who speak of the\r\nreservation of rent, not only in money, but in \"pepper, cummim, and\r\nwheat;\" whence arose the familiar reservation of a single peppercorn as\r\na rent so nominal as to have no appreciable pecuniary value.[204:1]\r\n\r\nThe red or Cayenne Pepper is made from the ground seeds of the\r\nCapsicum, but I do not find that it was used to known in the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[204:1] Littleton does not mention Pepper when speaking of rents\r\nreserved otherwise than in money, but specifies as instances, \"un\r\nchival, ou un esperon dor, ou un clovegylofer\"--a horse, a golden spur,\r\nor a clove gilliflower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG-NUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Caliban._\r\n\r\n     I prythee let me bring thee where Crabs grow;\r\n     And I with my long nails will dig thee Pig-nuts.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act ii, sc. 2 (171).\r\n\r\nPig-nuts or Earth-nuts are the tuberous roots of Conopodium denudatum\r\n(_Bunium flexuosum_), a common weed in old upland pastures; it is found\r\nalso in woods. This root is really of a pleasant flavour when first\r\neaten, but leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It is said to be\r\nmuch improved by roasting, and to be then quite equal to Chestnuts. Yet\r\nit is not much prized in England except by pigs and children, who do not\r\nmind the trouble of digging for it. But the root lies deep, and the\r\nstalk above it is very brittle, and \"when the little 'howker' breaks the\r\nwhite shank he at once desists from his attempt to reach the root, for\r\nhe believes that it will elude his search by sinking deeper and deeper\r\ninto the ground\" (Johnston). I have never heard of its being cultivated\r\nin England, but it is cultivated in some European countries, and much\r\nprized as a wholesome and palatable root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n                She did confine thee,\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Into a cloven Pine;\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n               It was mine art,\r\n     When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape\r\n     The Pine and let thee out.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act i, sc. 2 (273).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Suffolk._\r\n\r\n     Thus droops this lofty Pine and hangs his sprays.\r\n\r\n                              _2nd Henry VI_, act ii, sc. 3 (45).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Prospero._\r\n\r\n               And by the spurs plucked up\r\n     The Pine and Cedar.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act v, sc. 1 (47).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Agamemnon._\r\n\r\n     As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\r\n     Infect the sound Pine and divert his grain\r\n     Tortive and errant from his course of growth.\r\n\r\n                        _Troilus and Cressida_, act i, sc. 3 (7).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Antony._\r\n\r\n             Where yonder Pine does stand\r\n     I shall discover all.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n             This Pine is bark'd\r\n     That overtopped them all.\r\n\r\n                     _Antony and Cleopatra_, act iv, sc. 12 (23).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Belarius._\r\n\r\n                 As the rudest wind\r\n     That by the top doth take the mountain Pine,\r\n     And make him stoop to the vale.\r\n\r\n                                _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (174).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _1st Lord._\r\n\r\n     Behind the tuft of Pines I met them.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act ii, sc. 1 (33).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Richard._\r\n\r\n     But when from under this terrestrial ball\r\n     He fires the proud top of the eastern Pines.\r\n\r\n                               _Richard II_, act iii, sc. 2 (41).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Antonio._\r\n\r\n     You may as well forbid the mountain Pines\r\n     To wag their high tops and to make no noise,\r\n     When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven.\r\n\r\n                        _Merchant of Venice_, act iv, sc. 1 (75).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (10)\r\n\r\n     Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty Pine,\r\n     His leaves will wither, and his sap decay;\r\n     So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away.\r\n\r\n                                                _Lucrece_ (1167).\r\n\r\nIn No. 8 is one of those delicate touches which show Shakespeare's keen\r\nobservation of nature, in the effect of the rising sun upon a group of\r\nPine trees. Mr. Ruskin says that with the one exception of Wordsworth no\r\nother English poet has noticed this. Wordsworth's lines occur in one of\r\nhis minor poems on leaving Italy--\r\n\r\n     \"My thoughts become bright like yon edging of Pines\r\n        On the steep's lofty verge--how it blackened the air!\r\n      But touched from behind by the sun, it now shines\r\n        With threads that seem part of its own silver hair.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Ruskin's account of it is this: \"When the sun rises behind a\r\nridge of Pines, and those Pines are seen from a distance of a mile or\r\ntwo against his light, the whole form of the tree, trunk, branches and\r\nall, becomes one frost-work of intensely brilliant silver, which is\r\nrelieved against the clear sky like a burning fringe, for some distance\r\non either side of the sun.\"--_Stones of Venice_, i. 240.\r\n\r\nThe Pine is the established emblem of everything that is \"high and\r\nlifted up,\" but always with a suggestion of dreariness and solitude. So\r\nit is used by Shakespeare and by Milton, who always associated the Pine\r\nwith mountains; and so it has always been used by the poets, even down\r\nto our own day. Thus Tennyson--\r\n\r\n     \"They came, they cut away my tallest Pines--\r\n      My dark tall Pines, that plumed the craggy ledge--\r\n      High o'er the blue gorge, and all between\r\n      The snowy peak and snow-white cataract\r\n      Fostered the callow eaglet; from beneath\r\n      Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn\r\n      The panther's roar came muffled while I sat\r\n      Down in the valley.\"\r\n\r\n                                            _Complaint of Ænone._\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott similarly describes the tree in the pretty and\r\nwell-known lines--\r\n\r\n     \"Aloft the Ash and warrior Oak\r\n      Cast anchor in the rifted rock;\r\n      And higher yet the Pine tree hung\r\n      His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,\r\n      Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,\r\n      His boughs athwart the narrow sky.\"\r\n\r\nYet the Pine which was best known to Shakespeare, and perhaps the only\r\nPine he knew, was the Pinus sylvestris, or Scotch fir, and this, though\r\nflourishing on the highest hills where nothing else will flourish,\r\ncertainly attains its fullest beauty in sheltered lowland districts.\r\nThere are probably much finer Scotch firs in Devonshire than can be\r\nfound in Scotland. This is the only indigenous Fir, though the Pinus\r\npinaster claims to be a native of Ireland, some cones having been\r\nsupposed to be found in the bogs, but the claim is not generally allowed\r\n(there is no proof of the discovery of the cones); and yet it has become\r\nso completely naturalized on the coast of Dorsetshire, especially about\r\nBournemouth, that it has been admitted into the last edition of\r\nSowerby's \"English Botany.\"\r\n\r\nBut though the Scotch Fir is a true native, and was probably much more\r\nabundant in England formerly than it is now, the tree has no genuine\r\nEnglish name, and apparently never had. Pine comes directly and without\r\nchange from the Latin, _Pinus_, as one of the chief products, pitch,\r\ncomes directly from the Latin, _pix_. In the early vocabularies it is\r\ncalled \"Pin-treow,\" and the cones are \"Pin-nuttes.\" They were also\r\ncalled \"Pine apples,\" and the tree was called the Pine-Apple\r\nTree.[208:1] This name was transferred to the rich West Indian\r\nfruit[208:2] from its similarity to a fir-cone, and so was lost to the\r\nfruit of the fir-tree, which had to borrow a new name from the Greek;\r\nbut it was still in use in Shakespeare's day--\r\n\r\n     \"Sweete smelling Firre that frankensence provokes,\r\n      And Pine Apples from whence sweet juyce doth come.\"\r\n\r\n                                       CHESTER'S _Love's Martyr_.\r\n\r\nAnd Gerard describing the fruit of the Pine Tree, says: \"This Apple is\r\ncalled in . . . Low Dutch, Pyn Appel, and in English, Pine-apple, clog,\r\nand cones.\" We also find \"Fyre-tree,\" which is a true English word\r\nmeaning the \"fire-tree;\" but I believe that \"Fir\" was originally\r\nconfined to the timber, from its large use for torches, and was not till\r\nlater years applied to the living tree.\r\n\r\nThe sweetness of the Pine seeds, joined to the difficulty of extracting\r\nthem, and the length of time necessary for their ripening, did not\r\nescape the notice of the emblem-writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. With them it was the favourite emblem of the happy results of\r\npersevering labour. Camerarius, a contemporary of Shakespeare and a\r\ngreat botanist, gives a pretty plate of a man holding a Fir-cone, with\r\nthis moral: \"Sic ad virtutem et honestatem et laudabiles actiones non\r\nnisi per labores ac varias difficultates perveniri potest, at postea\r\nsequuntur suavissimi fructus.\" He acknowledges his obligation for this\r\nmoral to the proverb of Plautus: \"Qui e nuce nucleum esse vult, frangat\r\nnucem\" (\"Symbolorum,\" &c., 1590).\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare's time a few of the European Conifers were grown in\r\nEngland, including the Larch, but only as curiosities. The very large\r\nnumber of species which now ornament our gardens and Pineta from America\r\nand Japan were quite unknown. The many uses of the Pine--for its timber,\r\nproduction of pitch, tar, resin, and turpentine--were well known and\r\nvalued. Shakespeare mentions both pitch and tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[208:1] For many examples see \"Catholicon Anglicum,\" s.v. Pyne-Tree,\r\nwith note.\r\n\r\n[208:2] The West Indian Pine Apple is described by Gerard as \"Ananas,\r\nthe Pinea, or Pine Thistle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Romeo._\r\n\r\n     A most courteous exposition.\r\n\r\n     _Mercutio._\r\n\r\n     Nay, I am the very Pink of courtesy.\r\n\r\n     _Romeo._\r\n\r\n     Pink for flower.\r\n\r\n     _Mercutio._\r\n\r\n     Right.\r\n\r\n     _Romeo._\r\n\r\n     Why, then is my pump well flowered.\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act ii, sc. 4 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Maiden._\r\n\r\n     Pinks of odour faint.\r\n\r\n                               _Two Noble Kinsmen_, Introd. song.\r\n\r\nTo these may perhaps be added the following, from the second verse sung\r\nby Mariana in \"Measure for Measure,\" act iv, sc. 1 (337)--\r\n\r\n     Hide, oh hide, those hills of snow\r\n       Which thy frozen bosom bears!\r\n     On whose tops the Pinks that grow\r\n       Are of those that April wears.\r\n\r\nThe authority is doubtful, but it is attributed to Shakespeare in some\r\neditions of his poems.\r\n\r\nThe Pink or Pincke was, as now, the name of the smaller sorts of\r\nCarnations, and was generally applied to the single sorts. It must have\r\nbeen a very favourite flower, as we may gather from the phrase \"Pink of\r\ncourtesy,\" which means courtesy carried to its highest point; and from\r\nSpenser's pretty comparison--\r\n\r\n     \"Her lovely eyes like Pincks but newly spred.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Amoretti_, Sonnet 64.\r\n\r\nThe name has a curious history. It is not, as most of us would suppose,\r\nderived from the colour, but the colour gets its name from the plant.\r\nThe name (according to Dr. Prior) comes through _Pinksten_ (German),\r\nfrom Pentecost, and so was originally applied to one species--the\r\nWhitsuntide Gilliflower. From this it was applied to other species of\r\nthe same family. It is certainly \"a curious accident,\" as Dr. Prior\r\nobserves, \"that a word that originally meant 'fiftieth' should come to\r\nbe successively the name of a festival of the Church, of a flower, of an\r\nornament in muslin called _pinking_, of a colour, and of a sword stab.\"\r\nShakespeare uses the word in three of its senses. First, as applied to a\r\ncolour--\r\n\r\n     Come, thou monarch of the Vine,\r\n     Plumpy Bacchus with Pink eyne.\r\n\r\n                    _Antony and Cleopatra_, act ii, sc. 7.[210:1]\r\n\r\nSecond, as applied to an ornament of dress in Romeo's person--\r\n\r\n     Then is my pump well flowered;\r\n\r\n                               _Romeo and Juliet_, act ii, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n_i.e._, well pinked. And in Grumio's excuses to Petruchio for the\r\nnon-attendance of the servants--\r\n\r\n     Nathaniel's coat, Sir, was not fully made,\r\n     And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked\r\n     I' the heel.\r\n\r\n                            _Taming of the Shrew_, act iv, sc. 1.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, as the pinked ornament in muslin--\r\n\r\n     There's a haberdasher's wife of small wit near him, that\r\n       railed upon me till her Pink'd porringer fell off her head.\r\n\r\n                                      _Henry VIII_, act v, sc. 3.\r\n\r\nAnd as applied to the flower in the passage quoted above. He also uses\r\nit in another sense--\r\n\r\n     This Pink is one of Cupid's carriers;\r\n     Clap on more sail--pursue!\r\n\r\n                         _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act ii, sc. 7.\r\n\r\nwhere pink means a small country vessel often mentioned under that name\r\nby writers of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[210:1] It is very probable that this does not refer to the\r\ncolour--\"Pink = winking, half-shut.\"--SCHMIDT. And see Nares, s.v. Pinke\r\neyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Thy banks with Pioned and twilled brims,\r\n     Which spongy April at thy best betrims,\r\n     To make cold nymphs chaste crowns.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (65).\r\n\r\nThere is much dispute about this passage, the dispute turning on the\r\nquestion whether \"Pioned\" has reference to the Peony flower or not. The\r\nword by some is supposed to mean only \"digged,\" and it doubtless often\r\nhad this meaning,[211:1] though the word is now obsolete, and only\r\nsurvives with us in \"pioneer,\" which, in Shakespeare's time, meant\r\n\"digger\" only, and not as now, \"one who goes before to prepare the\r\nway\"--thus Hamlet--\r\n\r\n     Well said, old mole! cans't work i' the earth so fast?\r\n     A worthy pioner?\r\n\r\n                                    _Hamlet_, act i, sc. 5 (161).\r\n\r\nand again--\r\n\r\n     There might you see the labouring pioner\r\n     Begrim'd with sweat, and smeared all with dust.\r\n\r\n                                                _Lucrece_ (1380).\r\n\r\nBut this reading seems very tame, tame in itself, and doubly tame when\r\ntaken in connection with the context, and \"Certainly savours more of the\r\ncommentators' prose than of Shakespeare's poetry\" (\"Edinburgh Review,\"\r\n1872, p. 363). I shall assume, therefore, that the flower is meant,\r\nspelt in the form of \"Piony,\" instead of Peony or Pæony.[211:2]\r\n\r\nThe Pæony (_P. corallina_) is sometimes allowed a place in the British\r\nflora, having been found apparently wild at the Steep Holmes in the\r\nBristol Channel and a few other places, but it is now considered\r\ncertain that in all these places it is a garden escape. Gerard gave one\r\nsuch habitat: \"The male Peionie groweth wilde upon a Coneyberry in\r\nBetsome, being in the parish of Southfleet, in Kent, two miles from\r\nGravesend, and in the ground sometimes belonging to a farmer there,\r\ncalled John Bradley;\" but on this his editor adds the damaging note: \"I\r\nhave been told that our author himselfe planted that Peionee there, and\r\nafterwards seemed to find it there by accident; and I do believe it was\r\nso, because none before or since have ever seen or heard of it growing\r\nwild since in any part of this kingdome.\"\r\n\r\nBut though not a native plant, it had been cultivated in England long\r\nbefore Shakespeare's and Gerard's time. It occurs in most of the old\r\nvocabularies from the tenth century downwards, and in Shakespeare's time\r\nthe English gardens had most of the European species that are now grown,\r\nincluding also the handsome double-red and white varieties. Since his\r\ntime the number of species and varieties has been largely increased by\r\nthe addition of the Chinese and Japanese species, and by the labours of\r\nthe French nurserymen, who have paid more attention to the flower than\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nIn the hardy flower garden there is no more showy family than the Pæony.\r\nThey have flowers of many colours, from almost pure white and pale\r\nyellow to the richest crimson; and they vary very much in their foliage,\r\nmost of them having large fleshy leaves, \"not much unlike the leaves of\r\nthe Walnut tree,\" but some of them having their leaves finely cut and\r\ndivided almost like the leaves of Fennel (_P. tenuifolia_). They further\r\nvary in that some are herbaceous, disappearing entirely in winter, while\r\nothers, Moutan or Tree Pæonies, are shrubs; and in favourable seasons,\r\nwhen the shrub is not injured by spring frosts, there is no grander\r\nshrub than an old Tree Pæony in full flower.\r\n\r\nOf the many different species the best are the Moutans, which, according\r\nto Chinese tradition, have been grown in China for 1500 years, and which\r\nare now produced in great variety of colour; P. corallina, for the\r\nbeauty of its coral-like seeds; P. Cretica, for its earliness in\r\nflowering; P. tenuifolia, single and double, for its elegant foliage; P.\r\nWhitmaniana, for its pale yellow but very fleeting flowers, which,\r\nbefore they are fully expanded, have all the appearance of immense\r\nGlobe-flowers (_trollius_); P. lobata, for the wonderful richness of its\r\nbright crimson flowers; and P. Whitleji, a very old and very double form\r\nof P. edulis, of great size, and most delicate pink and white colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Which to outbarre, with painful pyonings,\r\n      From sea to sea, he heapt a mighty mound!\"\r\n\r\n                                    SPENSER, _F.

We know from Pliny that it was growing in France\r\nin his day on the part opposite Britain, and the name occurs in the old\r\nvocabularies. But from Turner's evidence in 1548 it must have been a\r\nvery scarce tree in the sixteenth century. He says: \"I never saw any\r\nPlaine tree in Englande, saving once in Northumberlande besyde Morpeth,\r\nand an other at Barnwell Abbey besyde Cambryge.\" And more than a hundred\r\nyears later Evelyn records a special visit to Lee to inspect one as a\r\ngreat curiosity. The Plane is not only a very handsome tree, and a fast\r\ngrower, but from the fact that it yearly sheds its bark it has become\r\none of the most useful trees for growing in towns. The wood is of very\r\nlittle value. To the emblem writers the Plane was an example of\r\nsomething good to the eye, but of no real use. Camerarius so moralizes\r\nit (Pl. xix.), and, quoting Virgil's \"steriles platanos,\" he says of it,\r\n\"umbram non fructum platanus dat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Costard._\r\n\r\n     O sir, Plantain, a plain Plantain! no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no\r\n       salve, sir, but a Plantain.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Moth._\r\n\r\n     By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.\r\n     Then call'd you for the l'envoy.\r\n\r\n     _Costard._\r\n\r\n     True! and I for a Plantain.\r\n\r\n                      _Loves Labour's Lost_, act iii, sc. 1 (76).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Romeo._\r\n\r\n     Your Plantain leaf is excellent for that.\r\n\r\n     _Benvolio._\r\n\r\n     For what, I pray thee?\r\n\r\n     _Romeo._\r\n\r\n                            For your broken shin.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act i, sc. 2 (52).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Troilus._\r\n\r\n     As true as steel, as Plantage to the moon.\r\n\r\n                    _Troilus and Cressida_, act iii, sc. 2 (184).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Palamon._\r\n\r\n           These poore slight sores\r\n     Neede not a Plantin.\r\n\r\n                          _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act i, sc. 2 (65).\r\n\r\nThe most common old names for the Plantain were Waybroad (corrupted to\r\nWeybread, Wayborn, and Wayforn) and Ribwort. It was also called\r\nLamb's-tongue and Kemps, while the flower spike with the stalk was\r\ncalled Cocks and Cockfighters (still so called by children).[214:1] The\r\nold name of Ribwort was derived from the ribbed leaves, while Waybroad\r\nmarked its universal appearance, scattered by all roadsides and\r\npathways, and literally bred by the wayside. It has a similar name in\r\nGerman, Wegetritt, that is Waytread; and on this account the Swedes name\r\nthe plant Wagbredblad, and the Indians of North America Whiteman's Foot,\r\nfor it springs up near every new settlement, having sprung up after the\r\nEnglish settlers, not only in America, but also in Australia and New\r\nZealand--\r\n\r\n     \"Whereso'er they move, before them\r\n      Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo,\r\n      Swarms the bee, the honey-maker:\r\n      Wheresoe'er they tread, beneath them\r\n      Springs a flower unknown among us,\r\n      Springs the 'White man's foot' in blossom.\"\r\n\r\n                                         LONGFELLOW'S _Hiawatha_.\r\n\r\nAnd \"so it is a mistake to say that Plantain is derived from the\r\nlikeness of the plant to the sole of the foot, as in Richardson's\r\nDictionary. Rather say, because the herb grows under the sole of the\r\nfoot.\"--JOHNSTON. How, or when, or why the plant lost its old English\r\nnames to take the Latin name of Plantain, it is hard to say. It occurs\r\nin a vocabulary of the names of plants of the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury--\"Plantago, Planteine, Weibrode,\" and apparently came to us from\r\nthe French, \"Cy est assets de Planteyne, Weybrede.\"--WALTER DE\r\nBIBLESWORTH (13th cent.) But with the exception of Chaucer[215:1] I\r\nbelieve Shakespeare is almost the only early writer that uses the name,\r\nthough it is very certain that he did not invent it; but \"Plantage\" (No\r\n3), which is doubtless the same plant, is peculiar to him.[215:2]\r\n\r\nIt was as a medical herb that our forefathers chiefly valued the\r\nPlantain, and for medical purposes its reputation was of the very\r\nhighest. In a book of recipes (Lacnunga) of the eleventh century, by\r\nÆlfric, is an address to the Waybroad, which is worth extracting at\r\nlength--\r\n\r\n     \"And thou, Waybroad!\r\n      Mother of worts,\r\n      Open from eastward,\r\n      Mighty within;\r\n      Over thee carts creaked,\r\n      Over thee Queens rode,\r\n      Over thee brides bridalled,\r\n      Over thee bulls breathed,\r\n      All these thou withstood'st\r\n      Venom and vile things\r\n      And all the loathly ones\r\n      That through the land rove.\"\r\n\r\n                                        COCKAYNE'S _Translation_.\r\n\r\nIn another earlier recipe book the Waybroad is prescribed for\r\ntwenty-two diseases, one after another; and in another of the same date\r\nwe are taught how to apply it: \"If a man ache in half his head . . .\r\ndelve up Waybroad without iron ere the rising of the sun, bind the roots\r\nabout the head with Crosswort by a red fillet, soon he will be well.\"\r\nBut the Plantain did not long sustain its high reputation, which even in\r\nShakespeare's time had become much diminished. \"I find,\" says Gerard,\r\n\"in ancient writers many good-morrowes, which I think not meet to bring\r\ninto your memorie againe; as that three roots will cure one griefe, four\r\nanother disease, six hanged about the neck are good for another maladie,\r\n&c., all which are but ridiculous toys.\" Yet the bruised leaves still\r\nhave some reputation as a styptic and healing plaster among country\r\nherbalists, and perhaps the alleged virtues are not altogether fanciful.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant the Plantain can only be regarded as a weed and\r\nnuisance, especially on lawns, where it is very difficult to destroy\r\nthem. Yet there are some curious varieties which may claim a corner\r\nwhere botanical curiosities are grown. The Plantain seems to have a\r\npeculiar tendency to run into abnormal forms, many of which will be\r\nfound described and figured in Dr. Masters' \"Vegetable Teratology,\" and\r\namong these forms are two which are exactly like a double green Rose,\r\nand have been cultivated as the Rose Plantain for many years. They were\r\ngrown by Gerard, who speaks of \"the beauty which is in the plant,\" and\r\ncompared it to \"a fine double Rose of a hoary or rusty greene colour.\"\r\nParkinson also grew it and valued it highly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[214:1] Of these names Plantain properly belongs to Plantago major;\r\nLamb's-tongue to P. media; and Kemps, Cocks, and Ribwort to P.\r\nlanceolata.\r\n\r\n[215:1]\r\n\r\n     \"His forehead dropped as a stillatorie\r\n      Were ful of Plantayn and peritorie.\"\r\n\r\n                              _Prologue of the Chanoune's Yeman._\r\n\r\n[215:2] Nares, and Schmidt from him, consider Plantage = anything\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMS, WITH DAMSONS AND PRUNES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Constance._\r\n\r\n     Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will\r\n     Give it a Plum, a Cherry, and a Fig.\r\n\r\n                                _King John_, act ii, sc. 1 (161).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Hamlet._\r\n\r\n     The satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards,\r\n       that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick\r\n       amber and Plum-tree gum.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act ii, sc. 2 (198).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Simpcox._\r\n\r\n          A fall off a tree.\r\n\r\n     _Wife._\r\n\r\n     A Plum-tree, master.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Gloucester._\r\n\r\n     Mass, thou lovedst Plums well that wouldst venture so.\r\n\r\n     _Simpcox._\r\n\r\n     Alas! good master, my wife desired some Damsons,\r\n     And made me climb with danger of my life.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry VI_, act ii, sc. 1 (196).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Evans._\r\n\r\n     I will dance and eat Plums at your wedding.\r\n\r\n                   _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act v, sc. 5.[217:1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5)\r\n\r\n     The mellow Plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,\r\n     Or, being early pluck'd, is sour to taste.\r\n\r\n                                        _Venus and Adonis_ (527).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6)\r\n\r\n     Like a green Plum that hangs upon a tree,\r\n     And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.\r\n\r\n                                      _Passionate Pilgrim_ (135).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Slender._\r\n\r\n     Three veneys for a dish of stewed Prunes.\r\n\r\n                    _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act i, sc. 1 (295).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed Prune.\r\n\r\n                            _1st Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 3 (127).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Pompey._\r\n\r\n     Longing (saving your honour's presence) for stewed Prunes.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     And longing, as I said, for Prunes.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     You being then, if you he remembered, cracking the stones of\r\n       the foresaid Prunes.\r\n\r\n                       _Measure for Measure_, act ii, sc. 1 (92).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (10) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Four pounds of Prunes, and as many of Raisins of the sun.\r\n\r\n                              _Winters Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (51).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (11) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Hang him, rogue; he lives upon mouldy stewed Prunes and dried\r\n       cakes.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (158).\r\n\r\nPlums, Damsons, and Prunes may conveniently be joined together, Plums\r\nand Damsons being often used synonymously (as in No. 3), and Prunes\r\nbeing the dried Plums. The Damsons were originally, no doubt, a good\r\nvariety from the East, and nominally from Damascus.[217:2] They seem to\r\nhave been considered great delicacies, as in a curious allegorical\r\ndrama of the fifteenth century, called \"La Nef de Sante,\" of which an\r\naccount is given by Mr. Wright: \"Bonne-Compagnie, to begin the day,\r\norders a collation, at which, among other things, are served Damsons\r\n(_Prunes de Damas_), which appear at this time to have been considered\r\nas delicacies. There is here a marginal direction to the purport that if\r\nthe morality should be performed in the season when real Damsons could\r\nnot be had, the performers must have some made of wax to look like real\r\nones\" (\"History of Domestic Manners,\" &c.).\r\n\r\nThe garden Plums are a good cultivated variety of our own wild Sloe, but\r\na variety that did not originate in England, and may very probably have\r\nbeen introduced by the Romans. The Sloe and Bullace are, speaking\r\nbotanically, two sub-species of Prunus communis, while the Plum is a\r\nthird sub-species (P. communis domestica). The garden Plum is\r\noccasionally found wild in England, but is certainly not indigenous. It\r\nis somewhat strange that our wild plant is not mentioned by Shakespeare\r\nunder any of its well-known names of Sloe, Bullace, and Blackthorn. Not\r\nonly is it a shrub of very marked appearance in our hedgerows in early\r\nspring, when it is covered with its pure white blossoms, but Blackthorn\r\nstaves were indispensable in the rough game of quarterstaff, and the\r\nSloe gave point to more than one English proverb: \"as black as a Sloe,\"\r\nwas a very common comparison, and \"as useless as a Sloe,\" or \"not worth\r\na Sloe,\" was as common.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Amys answered, 'Tho'\r\n      I give thee thereof not one Sloe!\r\n      Do right all that thou may!\"\r\n\r\n                          _Amys and Amylion_--ELLIS'S _Romances_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The offecial seyde, Thys ys nowth\r\n      Be God, that me der bowthe,\r\n      Het ys not worthe a Sclo.\"\r\n\r\n      _The Frere and His Boy_--RITSON'S _Ancient Popular Poetry_.\r\n\r\nThough even as a fruit the Sloe had its value, and was not altogether\r\ndespised by our ancestors, for thus Tusser advises--\r\n\r\n     \"By thend of October go gather up Sloes,\r\n      Have thou in readines plentie of thoes,\r\n      And keepe them in bed-straw, or still on the bow,\r\n      To staie both the flix of thyselfe and thy cow.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the garden Plum was introduced, great attention seems to have\r\nbeen paid to it, and the gardeners of Shakespeare's time could probably\r\nshow as good Plums as we can now. \"To write of Plums particularly,\" said\r\nGerard, \"would require a peculiar volume. . . . Every clymate hath his\r\nowne fruite, far different from that of other countries; my selfe have\r\nthreescore sorts in my garden, and all strange and rare; there be in\r\nother places many more common, and yet yearly commeth to our hands\r\nothers not before knowne.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[217:1] Omitted in the Globe edition.\r\n\r\n[217:2] Bullein, in his \"Government of Health,\" 1588, calls them\r\n\"Damaske Prunes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMEGRANATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Lafeu._\r\n\r\n     Go to, sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out\r\n       of a Pomegranate.\r\n\r\n                _All's Well that Ends Well_, act ii, sc. 3 (275).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Juliet._\r\n\r\n     It was the nightingale and not the lark,\r\n     That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;\r\n     Nightly she sings on yon Pomegranate tree.[219:1]\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act iii, sc. 5 (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Francis._\r\n\r\n     Anon, anon, sir, Look down into the Pomegarnet, Ralph.\r\n\r\n                              _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (41).\r\n\r\nThere are few trees that surpass the Pomegranate in interest and beauty\r\ncombined. \"Whoever has seen the Pomegranate in a favourable soil and\r\nclimate, whether as a single shrub or grouped many together, has seen\r\none of the most beautiful of green trees; its spiry shape and\r\nthick-tufted foliage of vigorous green, each growing shoot shaded into\r\ntenderer verdure and bordered with crimson and adorned with the\r\nloveliest flowers; filmy petals of scarlet lustre are put forth from the\r\nsolid crimson cup, and the ripe fruit of richest hue and most admirable\r\nshape.\"--LADY CALCOTT'S _Scripture Herbal_. A simpler but more valued\r\ntestimony to the beauty of the Pomegranate is borne in its selection for\r\nthe choicest ornaments on the ark of the Tabernacle, on the priest's\r\nvestments, and on the rich capitals of the pillars in the Temple of\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\nThe native home of the Pomegranate is not very certainly known, but the\r\nevidence chiefly points to the North of Africa. It was very early\r\ncultivated in Egypt, and was one of the Egyptian delicacies so fondly\r\nremembered by the Israelites in their desert wanderings, and is\r\nfrequently met with in Egyptian sculpture. It was abundant in Palestine,\r\nand is often mentioned in the Bible, and always as an object of beauty\r\nand desire. It was highly appreciated by the Greeks and Romans, but it\r\nwas probably not introduced into Italy in very early times, as Pliny is\r\nthe first author that certainly mentions it, though some critics have\r\nsupposed that the _aurea mala_ and _aurea poma_ of Virgil and Ovid were\r\nPomegranates. From Italy the tree soon spread into other parts of\r\nEurope, taking with it its Roman name of _Punica malus_ or _Pomum\r\ngranatum_. _Punica_ showed the country from which the Romans derived it,\r\nwhile _granatum_ (full of grains) marked the special characteristic of\r\nthe fruit that distinguished it from all other so-called Apples. Gerard\r\nsays: \"Pomegranates grow in hot countries, towards the south in Italy,\r\nSpaine, and chiefly in the kingdom of Granada, which is thought to be so\r\nnamed of the great multitude of Pomegranates, which be commonly called\r\n_Granata_.\"[220:1] This derivation is very doubtful, but was commonly\r\naccepted in Gerard's day.[220:2] The Pomegranate lives and flowers well\r\nin England, but when it was first introduced is not recorded. I do not\r\nfind it in the old vocabularies, but a prominent place is given to it in\r\n\"that Gardeyn, wele wrought,\" \"the garden that so lyked me;\"--\r\n\r\n     \"There were, and that I wote fulle well,\r\n      Of Pomgarnettys a fulle gret delle,\r\n      That is a fruit fulle welle to lyke,\r\n      Namely to folk whaune they ben sike.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose._\r\n\r\nTurner describes it in 1548: \"Pomegranat trees growe plentuously in\r\nItaly and in Spayne, and there are certayne in my Lorde's gardene at\r\nSyon, but their fruite cometh never with perfection.\"[221:1]\r\n\r\nGerard had it in 1596, but from his description it seems that it was a\r\nrecent acquisition. \"I have recovered,\" he says, \"divers young trees\r\nhereof, by sowing of the seed or grains of the height of three or four\r\ncubits, attending God's leisure for floures and fruit.\" Three years\r\nlater, in 1599, it is noticed for its flowers in Buttes's \"Dyet's Dry\r\nDinner\" (as quoted by Brand), where it is asserted that \"if one eate\r\nthree small Pomegranate flowers (they say) for a whole yeare he shall be\r\nsafe from all manner of eyesore;\" and Gerard speaks of the \"wine which\r\nis pressed forth of the Pomegranate berries named Rhoitas or wine of\r\nPomegranates,\" but this may have been imported. But, when introduced, it\r\nat once took kindly to its new home, so that Parkinson was able to\r\ndescribe its flowers and fruits from personal observation. In all the\r\nsouthern parts of England it grows very well, and is one of the very\r\nbest trees we have to cover a south wall; it also grows well in towns,\r\nas may be seen at Bath, where a great many very fine specimens have been\r\nplanted in the areas in front of the houses, and have grown to a\r\nconsiderable height. When thus planted and properly pruned, the tree\r\nwill bear its beautiful flowers from May all through the summer; but\r\ngenerally the tree is so pruned that it cannot flower. It should be\r\npruned like a Banksian Rose, and other plants that bear their flowers on\r\nlast year's shoots, _i.e._, simply thinned, but not cut back or spurred.\r\nWith this treatment the branches may be allowed to grow in their natural\r\nway without being nailed in, and if the single-blossomed species be\r\ngrown, the flowers in good summers will bear fruit. In 1876 I counted on\r\na tree in Bath more than sixty fruit; the fruits will perhaps seldom be\r\nworth eating, but they are curious and handsome. The sorts usually grown\r\nare the pure scarlet (double and single), and a very double variety with\r\nthe flowers somewhat variegated. These are the most desirable, but there\r\nare a few other species and varieties, including a very beautiful dwarf\r\none from the East Indies that is too tender for our climate\r\nout-of-doors, but is largely grown on the Continent as a window plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[219:1] In illustration of Juliet's speech Mr. Knight very aptly quotes\r\na similar remark from Russell's \"History of Aleppo,\" adding that a\r\n\"friend whose observations as a traveller are as accurate as his\r\ndescriptions are graphic and forcible, informs us that throughout his\r\njourneys in the East he never heard such a choir of nightingales as in a\r\nrow of Pomegranate trees that skirt the road from Smyrna to Bondjia.\"\r\n\r\n[220:1] In a Bill of Medicines furnished for the use of Edward I.\r\n1306-7, is--\r\n\r\n     \"Item pro malis granatis vi. lx s.\r\n      Item pro vino malorum granatorun xx lb., lx s.\"\r\n\r\n                                _Archæological Journal_, xiv, 27.\r\n\r\n[220:2] See Prescott's \"Ferdinand and Isabella,\" vol. iii. p. 346, note\r\n(Ed. 1849)--the arms of the city are a split Pomegranate.\r\n\r\n[221:1] \"Names of Herbes,\" s.v. Malus Punica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMEWATER, _see_ APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPERING, _see_ PEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPPY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iago._\r\n\r\n             Not Poppy or Mandragora,\r\n     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\r\n     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n     Which thou ownedst yesterday.\r\n\r\n                                 _Othello_, act iii, sc. 3 (330).\r\n\r\nThe Poppy had of old a few other names, such as Corn-rose and\r\nCheese-bowls (a very old name for the flower), and being \"of great\r\nbeautie, although of evil smell, our gentlewomen doe call it Jone\r\nSilverpin.\" This name is difficult of explanation, even with Parkinson's\r\nhelp, who says it meanes \"faire without and foule within,\" but it\r\nprobably alludes to its gaudy colour and worthlessness. But these names\r\nare scarcely the common names of the plant, but rather nicknames; the\r\nusual name is, and always has been, Poppy, which is an easily traced\r\ncorruption from the Latin _papaver_, the Saxon and Early English names\r\nbeing variously spelt, _popig_ and _papig_, _popi_ and _papy_; so that\r\nthe Poppy is another instance of a very common and conspicuous English\r\nplant known only or chiefly by its Latin name Anglicised.\r\n\r\nOur common English Poppy, \"being of a beautiful and gallant red colour,\"\r\nis certainly one of the handsomest of our wild flowers, and a Wheat\r\nfield with a rich undergrowth of scarlet Poppies is a sight very dear to\r\nthe artist,[223:1] while the weed is not supposed to do much harm to the\r\nfarmer. But this is not the Poppy mentioned by Iago, for its narcotic\r\nqualities are very small; the Poppy that he alludes to is the Opium\r\nPoppy (_P. somniferum_). This Poppy was well known and cultivated in\r\nEngland long before Shakespeare's day, but only as a garden ornament;\r\nthe Opium was then, as now, imported from the East. Its deadly qualities\r\nwere well known. Gower describes it--\r\n\r\n     \"There is growend upon the ground\r\n      Popy that bereth the sede of slepe.\"\r\n\r\n                      _Conf.

(2, 102 Paulli).\r\n\r\nSpenser speaks of the plant as the \"dull Poppy,\" and describing the\r\nGarden of Proserpina, he says--\r\n\r\n     \"There mournful Cypress grew in greatest store,\r\n      And trees of bitter gall, and Heben sad,\r\n      Dead-sleeping Poppy, and black Hellebore,\r\n      Cold Coloquintida.\"\r\n\r\n                                              _F. Q._, ii, 7, 52.\r\n\r\nAnd Drayton similarly describes it--\r\n\r\n     \"Here Henbane, Poppy, Hemlock here,\r\n      Procuring deadly sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     _Nymphal_ v.\r\n\r\nThe name of opium does not seem to have been in general use, except\r\namong the apothecaries. Chaucer, however, uses it--\r\n\r\n     \"A claire made of a certayn wyn,\r\n      With necotykes, and opye of Thebes fyn.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _The Knightes Tale._\r\n\r\nAnd so does Milton--\r\n\r\n               \"Which no cooling herb\r\n     Or medicinal liquor can asswage,\r\n     Nor breath of vernal air from Snowy Alp;\r\n     Sleep hath forsook and given me o'er\r\n     To death's benumming opium as my only cure.\"\r\n\r\n                                              _Samson Agonistes._\r\n\r\nMany of the Poppies are very ornamental garden plants. The pretty yellow\r\nWelsh Poppy (_Meconopsis Cambrica_), abundant at Cheddar Cliffs, is an\r\nexcellent plant for the rockwork where, when once established, it will\r\ngrow freely and sow itself; and for the same place the little Papaver\r\nAlpinum, with its varieties, is equally well suited. For the open border\r\nthe larger Poppies are very suitable, especially the great Oriental\r\nPoppy (_P. orientale_) and the grand scarlet Siberian Poppy (_P.\r\nbracteatum_), perhaps the most gorgeous of hardy plants: while among the\r\nrarer species of the tribe we must reckon the Meconopses of the\r\nHimalayas (_M. Wallichi_ and _M. Nepalensis_), plants of singular beauty\r\nand elegance, but very difficult to grow, and still more difficult to\r\nkeep, even if once established; for though perfectly hardy, they are\r\nlittle more than biennials. Besides these Poppies, the large double\r\ngarden Poppies are very showy and of great variety in colour, but they\r\nare only annuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[223:1] \"We usually think of the Poppy as a coarse flower; but it is the\r\nmost transparent and delicate of all the blossoms of the field. The\r\nrest, nearly all of them, depend on the texture of their surface for\r\ncolour. But the Poppy is painted _glass_; it never glows so brightly as\r\nwhen the sun shines through it. Wherever it is seen, against the light\r\nor with the light, always it is a flame, and warms the wind like a blown\r\nruby.\"--RUSKIN, _Proserpina_, p. 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Thersites._\r\n\r\n     How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and Potato-finger,\r\n       tickles these together.\r\n\r\n                       _Troilus and Cressida_, act v, sc. 2 (55).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     Let the sky rain Potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green\r\n       Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits, and snow Eringoes.\r\n\r\n                     _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act v, sc. 5 (20).\r\n\r\nThe chief interest in these two passages is that they contain almost the\r\nearliest notice of Potatoes after their introduction into England. The\r\ngenerally received account is that they were introduced into Ireland in\r\n1584 by Sir Walter Raleigh, and from thence brought into England; but\r\nthe year of their first planting in England is not recorded. They are\r\nnot mentioned by Lyte in 1586. Gerard grew them in 1597, but only as\r\ncuriosities, under the name of Virginian Potatoes (_Battata\r\nVirginianorum_ and _Pappas_), to distinguish them from the Spanish\r\nPotato, or Convolvulus Battatas, which had been long grown in Europe,\r\nand in the first edition of his \"Herbal\" is his portrait, showing him\r\nholding a Potato in his hand. They seem to have grown into favour very\r\nslowly, for half a century after their introduction, Waller still spoke\r\nof them as one of the tropical luxuries of the Bermudas--\r\n\r\n     \"With candy'd Plantains and the juicy Pine,\r\n      On choicest Melons and sweet Grapes they dine,\r\n      And with Potatoes fat their wanton swine.\"\r\n\r\n                              _The Battel of the Summer Islands._\r\n\r\nPotato is a corruption of Batatas or Patatas.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Potato arrived in England, it was at once invested with\r\nwonderful restorative powers, and in a long exhaustive note in Steevens'\r\nShakespeare, Mr. Collins has given all the passages in the early writers\r\nin which the Potato is mentioned, and in every case they have reference\r\nto these supposed virtues. These passages, which are chiefly from the\r\nold dramatists, are curious and interesting in the early history of the\r\nPotato, and as throwing light on the manners of our ancestors; but as in\r\nevery instance they are all more or less indelicate, I refrain from\r\nquoting them here.\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant, we now restrict the Potato to the kitchen garden and\r\nthe field, but it belongs to a very large family, the Solanaceæ or\r\nNightshades, of which many members are very ornamental, though as they\r\nchiefly come from the tropical regions, there are very few that can be\r\ntreated as entirely hardy plants. One, however, is a very beautiful\r\nclimber--the Solanum jasminoides from South America--and quite hardy in\r\nthe South of England. Trained against a wall it will soon cover it, and\r\nwhen once established will bear its handsome trusses of white flowers\r\nwith yellow anthers in great profusion during the whole summer. A better\r\nknown member of the family is the Petunia, very handsome, but little\r\nbetter than an annual. The pretty Winter Cherry (_Physalis alkekengi_)\r\nis another member of the family, and so is the Mandrake (_see_\r\nMANDRAKE). The whole tribe is poisonous, or at least to be suspected,\r\nyet it contains a large number of most useful plants, as the Potato,\r\nTomato, Tobacco, Datura, and Cayenne Pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Queen._\r\n\r\n     The Violets, Cowslips, and the Primroses,\r\n     Bear to my closet.\r\n\r\n                                  _Cymbeline_, act i, sc. 5 (83).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Queen._\r\n\r\n     I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,\r\n     Look pale as Primrose with blood-drinking sighs,\r\n     And all to have the noble duke alive.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 2 (62).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n                Thou shalt not lack\r\n     The flower that's like thy face, pale Primrose.\r\n\r\n                                _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (220).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Hermia._\r\n\r\n     In the wood where often you and I\r\n     Upon faint Primrose-beds were wont to lie.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act i, sc. 1 (214).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n              Pale Primroses,\r\n     That die unmarried, ere they can behold\r\n     Bright Phœbus in his strength.\r\n\r\n                            _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (122).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Ophelia._\r\n\r\n     Like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\r\n     Himself the Primrose path of dalliance treads\r\n     And recks not his own rede.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act i, sc. 3 (49).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Porter._\r\n\r\n     I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go\r\n       the Primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.\r\n\r\n                                   _Macbeth_, act ii, sc. 3 (20).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8)\r\n\r\n     Primrose, first-born child of Ver\r\n     Merry spring-time's harbinger,\r\n       With her bells dim.\r\n\r\n                               _Two Noble Kinsmen_, Introd. song.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9)\r\n\r\n     Witness this Primrose bank whereon I lie.\r\n\r\n                                        _Venus and Adonis_ (151).\r\n\r\nWhenever we speak of spring flowers, the first that comes into our\r\nminds is the Primrose. Both for its simple beauty and for its early\r\narrival among us we give it the first place over\r\n\r\n     \"Whatsoever other flowre of worth\r\n      And whatso other hearb of lovely hew,\r\n      The joyous Spring out of the ground brings forth\r\n      To cloath herself in colours fresh and new.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a plant equally dear to children and their elders, so that I\r\ncannot believe that there is any one (except Peter Bell) to whom\r\n\r\n     \"A Primrose by the river's brim\r\n      A yellow Primrose is to him--\r\n      And it is nothing more;\"\r\n\r\nrather I should believe that W. Browne's \"Wayfaring Man\" is a type of\r\nmost English countrymen in their simple admiration of the common\r\nflower--\r\n\r\n     \"As some wayfaring man passing a wood,\r\n      Whose waving top hath long a sea-mark stood,\r\n      Goes jogging on and in his mind nought hath,\r\n      But how the Primrose finely strews the path,\r\n      Or sweetest Violets lay down their heads\r\n      At some tree's roots or mossy feather beds.\"\r\n\r\n                                   _Britannia's Pastorals_, i, 5.\r\n\r\nIt is the first flower, except perhaps the Daisy, of which a child\r\nlearns the familiar name; and yet it is a plant of unfailing interest to\r\nthe botanical student, while its name is one of the greatest puzzles to\r\nthe etymologist. The common and easy explanation of the name is that it\r\nmeans the first Rose of the year, but (like so many explanations that\r\nare derived only from the sound and modern appearance of a a name) this\r\nis not the true account. The full history of the name is too long to\r\ngive here, but the short account is this--\"The old name was Prime\r\nRolles--or primerole. Primerole is an abbreviation of Fr.,\r\n_primeverole_: It., _primaverola_, diminutive of _prima vera_ from _flor\r\ndi prima vera_, the first spring flower. _Primerole_, as an outlandish\r\nunintelligible word, was soon familiarized into _primerolles_, and this\r\ninto _primrose_.\"--DR. PRIOR. The name Primrose was not at first always\r\napplied to the flower, but was an old English word, used to show\r\nexcellence--\r\n\r\n     \"A fairer nymph yet never saw mine eie,\r\n      She is the pride and Primrose of the rest.\"\r\n\r\n                                          SPENSER, _Colin Clout_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Was not I [the Briar] planted of thine own hande\r\n      To bee the Primrose of all thy lande;\r\n      With flow'ring blossomes to furnish the prime\r\n      And scarlet berries in sommer time?\"\r\n\r\n                       SPENSER, _Shepherd's Calendar--Februarie_.\r\n\r\nIt was also a flower name, but not of our present Primrose, but of a\r\nvery different plant. Thus in a Nominale of the fifteenth century we\r\nhave \"hoc ligustrum, a Primerose;\" and in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the\r\nsame date we have \"hoc ligustrum, A{ce} a Prymrose;\" and in the\r\n\"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" \"Prymerose, primula, calendula,\r\nligustrum\"--and this name for the Privet lasted with a slight alteration\r\ninto Shakespeare's time. Turner in 1538 says, \"ligustrum arbor est non\r\nherba ut literatorū vulgus credit; nihil que minus est quam a\r\nPrymerose.\" In Tusser's \"Husbandry\" we have \"set Privie or Prim\"\r\n(September Abstract), and--\r\n\r\n     \"Now set ye may\r\n      The Box and Bay\r\n      Hawthorn and Prim\r\n        For clothe's trim\"--(_January Abstract_).\r\n\r\nAnd so it is described by Gerard as the Privet or Prim Print (_i.e._,\r\n_primé printemps_), and even in the seventeenth century, Cole says of\r\nligustrum, \"This herbe is called Primrose.\" When the name was fixed to\r\nour present plant I cannot say, but certainly before Shakespeare's time,\r\nthough probably not long before. It is rather remarkable that the\r\nflower, which we now so much admire, seems to have been very much\r\noverlooked by the writers before Shakespeare. In the very old\r\nvocabularies it does not at all appear by its present Latin name,\r\nPrimula vulgaris, but that is perhaps not to be wondered at, as nearly\r\nall the old botanists applied that name to the Daisy. But neither is it\r\nmuch noticed by any English name. I can only find it in two of the\r\nvocabularies. In an English Vocabulary of the fourteenth century is \"Hæc\r\npimpinella, A{e} primerolle,\" but it is very doubtful if this can be our\r\nPrimrose, as the Pimpernel of old writers was the Burnet. Gower\r\nmentions it as the flower of the star Canis Minor--\r\n\r\n     \"His stone and herbe as saith the scole\r\n      Ben Achates and Primerole.\"\r\n\r\n                       _Conf. Aman._ lib. sept. (3, 130. Paulli).\r\n\r\nAnd in the treatise of Walter de Biblesworth (13th century) is--\r\n\r\n     \"Primerole et primeveyre (cousloppe)\r\n      Sur tere aperunt en tems de veyre.\"\r\n\r\nI should think there is no doubt this is our Primrose. Then we have\r\nChaucer's description of a fine lady--\r\n\r\n     \"Hir schos were laced on hir legges hyghe\r\n      Sche was a Primerole, a piggesneyghe\r\n      For any lord have liggyng in his bedde,\r\n      Or yet for any gode yeman to wedde.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _The Milleres Tale._\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer than usual on the name of this flower, because it\r\ngives us an excellent example of how much literary interest may be found\r\neven in the names of our common English plants.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to come from the name to the flower. The English Primrose\r\nis one of a large family of more than fifty species, represented in\r\nEngland by the Primrose, the Oxlip, the Cowslip, and the Bird's-eye\r\nPrimrose of the North of England and Scotland. All the members of the\r\nfamily, whether British or exotic, are noted for the simple beauty of\r\ntheir flowers, but in this special character there is none that\r\nsurpasses our own. \"It is the very flower of delicacy and refinement;\r\nnot that it shrinks from our notice, for few plants are more easily\r\nseen, coming as it does when there is a dearth of flowers, when the\r\nfirst birds are singing, and the first bees humming, and the earliest\r\ngreen putting forth in the March and April woods; and it is one of those\r\nplants which dislikes to be looking cheerless, but keeps up a\r\nsmouldering fire of blossom from the very opening of the year, if the\r\nweather will permit.\"--FORBES WATSON. It is this character of\r\ncheerfulness that so much endears the flower to us; as it brightens up\r\nour hedgerows after the dulness of winter, the harbinger of many\r\nbrighter perhaps, but not more acceptable, beauties to come, it is the\r\nvery emblem of cheerfulness. Yet it is very curious to note what\r\nentirely different ideas it suggested to our forefathers. To them the\r\nPrimrose seems always to have brought associations of sadness, or even\r\nworse than sadness, for the \"Primrose paths\" and \"Primrose ways\" of Nos.\r\n6 and 7 are meant to be suggestive of pleasures, but sinful pleasures.\r\n\r\nSpenser associates it with death in some beautiful lines, in which a\r\nhusband laments the loss of a young and beautiful wife--\r\n\r\n     \"Mine was the Primerose in the lowly shade!\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Oh! that so fair a flower so soon should fade,\r\n      And through untimely tempest fade away.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _Daphnidia_, 232.\r\n\r\nIn another place he speaks of it as \"the Primrose trew\"--_Prothalamion_;\r\nbut in another place his only epithet for it is \"green,\" which quite\r\nignores its brightness--\r\n\r\n       \"And Primroses greene\r\n     Embellish the sweete Violet.\"\r\n\r\n                                    _Shepherd's Calendar--April._\r\n\r\nShakespeare has no more pleasant epithets for our favourite flower than\r\n\"pale,\" \"faint,\" \"that die unmarried;\" and Milton follows in the same\r\nstrain yet sadder. Once, indeed, he speaks of youth as \"Brisk as the\r\nApril buds in Primrose season\" (\"Comus\"); but only in three passages\r\ndoes he speak of the Primrose itself, and in two of these he connects it\r\nwith death--\r\n\r\n     \"Bring the rathe Primrose that forsaken dies,\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      And every flower that sad embroidery wears.\"--_Lycidas._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"O fairest flower, no sooner blown but blasted,\r\n      Soft silken Primrose fading timelesslie;\r\n      Summer's chief honour, if thou hadst outlasted\r\n      Bleak winter's force that made thy blossoms drie.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _On the Death of a Fair Infant._\r\n\r\nHis third account is a little more joyous--\r\n\r\n     \"Now the bright morning star, daye's harbinger,\r\n      Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her\r\n      The flowery May, who from her green lap throws\r\n      The yellow Cowslip and the pale Primrose.\"\r\n\r\n                                                _On May Morning._\r\n\r\nAnd nearly all the poets of that time spoke in the same strain, with the\r\nexception of Ben Jonson and the two Fletchers. Jonson spoke of it as\r\n\"the glory of the spring\" and as \"the spring's own spouse.\" Giles\r\nFletcher says--\r\n\r\n     \"Every bush lays deeply perfumed\r\n      With Violets; the wood's late wintry head,\r\n      Wide flaming Primroses set all on fire.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Phineas Fletcher--\r\n\r\n     \"The Primrose lighted new her flame displays,\r\n      And frights the neighbour hedge with fiery rays.\r\n      And here and there sweet Primrose scattered.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Nature seem'd work'd by Art, so lively true,\r\n      A little heaven or earth in narrow space she drew.\"\r\n\r\nI can only refer very shortly to the botanical interest of the Primula,\r\nand that only to direct attention to Mr. Darwin's paper in the \"Journal\r\nof the Linnæan Society,\" 1862, in which he records his very curious and\r\npainstaking inquiries into the dimorphism of the Primula, a peculiarity\r\nin the Primula that gardeners had long recognized in their arrangement\r\nof Primroses as \"pin-eyed\" and \"thrum-eyed.\" It is perhaps owing to this\r\ndimorphism that the family is able to show a very large number of\r\nnatural hybrids. These have been carefully studied by Professor Kerner,\r\nof Innspruck, and it seems not unlikely that a further study will show\r\nthat all the European so-called species are natural hybrids from a very\r\nfew parents.\r\n\r\nYet a few words on the Primrose as a garden plant. If the Primrose be\r\ntaken from the hedges in November, and planted in beds thickly in the\r\ngarden, they make a beautiful display of flowers and foliage from\r\nFebruary till the beds are required for the summer flowers; and there\r\nare few of our wild flowers that run into so many varieties in their\r\nwild state. In Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire I have seen the wild\r\nPrimrose of nearly all shades of colour, from the purest white to an\r\nalmost bright red, and these can all be brought into the garden with a\r\ncertainty of success and a certainty of rapid increase. There are also\r\nmany double varieties, all of which are more often seen in cottage\r\ngardens than elsewhere; yet no gardener need despise them.\r\n\r\nOne other British Primrose, the Bird's-eye Primrose, almost defies\r\ngarden cultivation, though in its native habitats in the north it grows\r\nin most ungenial places. I have seen places in the neighbourhood of the\r\nbleak hill of Ingleborough, where it almost forms the turf; yet away\r\nfrom its native habitat it is difficult to keep, except in a greenhouse.\r\nFor the cultivation of the other non-English species, I cannot do better\r\nthan refer to an excellent paper by Mr. Niven in the \"The Garden\" for\r\nJanuary 29, 1876, in which he gives an exhaustive account of them.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that Primroses are of any use in medicine or cookery, yet\r\nTusser names the Primrose among \"seeds and herbs for the kitchen,\" and\r\nLyte says \"the Cowslips, Primroses, and Oxlips are now used dayly\r\namongst other pot herbes, but in physicke there is no great account made\r\nof them.\" They occur in heraldy. The arms of the Earls of Rosebery\r\n(Primrose) are three Primroses within a double tressure fleury\r\ncounter-fleury, or.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNES, _see_ PLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUMPION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Mrs. Ford._\r\n\r\n     Go to, then. We'll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross\r\n       watery Pumpion.\r\n\r\n                   _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act iii, sc. 3 (42).\r\n\r\nThe old name for the Cucumber (in Ælfric's \"Vocabulary\") is hwer-hwette,\r\n_i.e._, wet ewer, but Pumpion, Pompion, and Pumpkin were general terms\r\nincluding all the Cucurbitaceæ such as Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and\r\nVegetable Marrows. All were largely grown in Shakespeare's days, but I\r\nshould think the reference here must be to one of the large useless\r\nGourds, for Mrs. Ford's comparison is to Falstaff, and Gourds were grown\r\nlarge enough to bear out even that comparison. \"The Gourd groweth into\r\nany forme or fashion you would have it, . . . being suffered to clime\r\nupon an arbour where the fruit may hang; it hath beene seene to be nine\r\nfoot long.\" And the little value placed upon the whole tribe helped to\r\nbear out the comparison. They were chiefly good to \"cure copper faces,\r\nred and shining fierce noses (as red as red Roses), with pimples,\r\npumples, rubies, and such-like precious faces.\" This was Gerard's\r\naccount of the Cucumber, while of the Cucumber Pompion, which was\r\nevidently our Vegetable Marrow, and of which he has described and\r\nfigured the variety which we now call the Custard Marrow, he says, \"it\r\nmaketh a man apt and ready to fall into the disease called the colericke\r\npassion, and of some the felonie.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ford's comparison of a big loutish man to an overgrown Gourd has\r\nnot been lost in the English language, for \"bumpkin\" is only another\r\nform of \"Pumpkin,\" and Mr. Fox Talbot, in his \"English Etymologies,\" has\r\na very curious account of the antiquity of the nickname. \"The Greeks,\"\r\nhe says, \"called a very weak and soft-headed person a Pumpion, whence\r\nthe proverb πεπονος μαλακωτερος, softer than a Pumpion; and even one of\r\nHomer's heroes, incensed at the timidity of his soldiers, exclaims ὠ\r\nπεπονες, you Pumpions! So also _cornichon_ (Cucumber) is a term of\r\nderision in French.\"\r\n\r\nYet the Pumpion or Gourd had its uses, moral uses. Modern critics have\r\ndecided that Jonah's Gourd, \"which came up in a night and perished in a\r\nnight,\" was not a Gourd, but the Palma Christi, or Castor-oil tree. But\r\nour forefathers called it a Gourd, and believing that it was so, they\r\nused the Gourd to point many a moral and illustrate many a religious\r\nemblem. Thus viewed it was the standing emblem of the rapid growth and\r\nquick decay of evil-doers and their evil deeds. \"Cito nata, cito\r\npereunt,\" was the history of the evil deeds, while the doers of them\r\ncould only say--\r\n\r\n     \"Quasi solstitialis herba fui,\r\n      Repente exortus sum, repente occidi.\"\r\n\r\n                                                         PLAUTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Nurse._\r\n\r\n     They call for Dates and Quinces in the pastry.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act iv, sc. 4 (2).\r\n\r\nQuince is also the name of one of the \"homespun actors\" in \"Midsummer\r\nNight's Dream,\" and is no doubt there used as a ludicrous name. The name\r\nwas anciently spelt \"coynes\"--\r\n\r\n     \"And many homely trees ther were\r\n      That Peches, Coynes, and Apples bere,\r\n      Medlers, Plommes, Perys, Chesteyns,\r\n      Cherys, of which many oon fayne is.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose._\r\n\r\nThe same name occurs in the old English vocabularies, as in a Nominale\r\nof the fifteenth century, \"hæc cocianus, a coventre;\" in an English\r\nvocabulary of the fourteenth century, \"Hoc coccinum, a quoyne,\" and in\r\nthe treatise of Walter de Biblesworth, in the thirteenth century--\r\n\r\n     \"Issi troverez en ce verger\r\n      Estang un sek Coigner (a Coyn-tre, Quince-tre).\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is little doubt that \"Quince\" is a corruption of \"coynes\"\r\nwhich again is a corruption, not difficult to trace, of Cydonia, one of\r\nthe most ancient cities of Crete, where the Quince tree is indigenous,\r\nand whence it derived its name of Pyrus Cydonia, or simply Cydonia. If\r\nnot indigenous elsewhere in the East, it was very soon cultivated, and\r\nespecially in Palestine. It is not yet a settled point, and probably\r\nnever will be, but there is a strong consensus of most of the best\r\ncommentators, that the _Tappuach_ of Scripture, always translated Apple,\r\nwas the Quince. It is supposed to be the fruit alluded to in the\r\nCanticles, \"As the Apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my\r\nbeloved among the sons; I sat down under his shadow with great delight,\r\nand his fruit was sweet to my taste;\" and in Proverbs, \"A word fitly\r\nspoken is like Apples of gold in pictures of silver;\" and the tree is\r\nsupposed to have given its name to various places in Palestine, as\r\nTappuach, Beth-Tappuach, and Aen-Tappuach.\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks and Romans the Quince was held in honour as the fruit\r\nespecially sacred to Venus, who is often represented as holding a Quince\r\nin her right hand, the gift which she received from Paris. In other\r\nsculptures \"the amorous deities pull Quinces in gardens and play with\r\nthem. For persons to send Quinces in presents, to throw them at each\r\nother, to eat them together, were all tokens of love; to dream of\r\nQuinces was a sign of successful love\" (Rosenmuller). The custom was\r\nhanded down to mediæval times. It was at a wedding feast that \"they\r\ncalled for Dates and Quinces in the pastry;\" and Brand quotes a curious\r\npassage from the \"Praise of Musicke,\" 1586 (\"Romeo and Juliet\" was\r\npublished in 1596)--\"I come to marriages, wherein as our ancestors did\r\nfondly, and with a kind of doting, maintaine many rites and ceremonies,\r\nsome whereof were either shadowes or abodements of a pleasant life to\r\ncome, as the eating of a Quince Peare to be a preparative of sweet and\r\ndelightful dayes between the married persons.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand this high repute in which the Quince was held, we must\r\nremember that the Quince of hot countries differs somewhat from the\r\nEnglish Quince. With us the fruit is of a fine, handsome shape, and of a\r\nrich golden colour when fully ripe, and of a strong scent, which is very\r\nagreeable to many, though too heavy and overpowering to others. But the\r\nrind is rough and woolly, and the flesh is harsh and unpalatable, and\r\nonly fit to be eaten when cooked. In hotter countries the woolly rind is\r\nsaid to disappear, and the fruit can be eaten raw; and this is the case\r\nnot only in Eastern countries, but also in the parts of Tropical America\r\nto which the tree has been introduced from Europe.\r\n\r\nIn England the Quince is probably less grown now than it was in\r\nShakespeare's time--yet it may well be grown as an ornamental shrub even\r\nby those who do not appreciate its fruit. It forms a thick bush, with\r\nlarge white flowers, followed in the autumn by its handsome fruit, and\r\nrequires no care. \"They love shadowy, moist places;\" \"It delighteth to\r\ngrow on plaine and even ground and somewhat moist withall.\" This was\r\nLyte's and Gerard's experience, and I have never seen handsomer bushes\r\nor finer fruit than I once saw on some neglected bushes that skirted a\r\nhorsepond on a farm in Kent; the trees were evidently revelling in their\r\nstate of moisture and neglect. The tree has a horticultural value as\r\ngiving an excellent stock for Pear-trees, on which it has a very\r\nremarkable effect, for \"Cabanis asserts that when certain Pears are\r\ngrafted on the Quince, their seeds yield more varieties than do the\r\nseeds of the same variety of Pear when grafted on the wild\r\nPear.\"--DARWIN. Its economic value is considered to be but small, being\r\nchiefly used for Marmalade,[236:1] but in Shakespeare's time, Browne\r\nspoke of it as \"the stomach's comforter, the pleasing Quince,\" and\r\nParkinson speaks highly of it, for \"there is no fruit growing in the\r\nland,\" he says, \"that is of so many excellent uses as this, serving as\r\nwell to make many dishes of meat for the table, as for banquets, and\r\nmuch more for their physical virtues, whereof to write at large is\r\nneither convenient for me nor for this work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[236:1] This was a very old use for the Quince. Wynkyn de Worde, in the\r\n\"Boke of Kervynge\" (p. 266), speaks of \"char de Quynce;\" and John\r\nRussell, in the \"Boke of Nurture\" (l. 75), speaks of \"chare de Quynces.\"\r\nThis was Quince marmalade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRADISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     When a' was naked, he was, for all the world, like a fork'd\r\n       Radish.\r\n\r\n                            _2nd Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 2 (333).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Falstaff._\r\n\r\n     If I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of Radish.\r\n\r\n                             _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (205).\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Radish was so named because it was\r\nconsidered by the Romans, for some reason unknown to us, _the_ root _par\r\nexcellence_. It was used by them, as by us, \"as a stimulus before meat,\r\ngiving an appetite thereunto\"--\r\n\r\n                       \"Acria circum\r\n     Rapula, lactucæ, Radices, qualia lassum\r\n     Pervellunt stomachum.\"--HORACE.\r\n\r\nBut it was cultivated, or allowed to grow, to a much larger size than we\r\nnow think desirable. Pliny speaks of Radishes weighing 40lb. each, and\r\nothers speak even of 60lb. and 100lb. But in Shakespeare's time the\r\nRadish was very much what it is now, a pleasant salad vegetable, but of\r\nno great value. We read, however, of Radishes being put to strange\r\nuses. Lupton, a writer of Shakespeare's day, says: \"If you would kill\r\nsnakes and adders strike them with a large Radish, and to handle adders\r\nand snakes without harm, wash your hands in the juice of Radishes and\r\nyou may do without harm\" (\"Notable Things,\" 1586).\r\n\r\nWe read also of great attempts being made to procure oil from the seed,\r\nbut to no great effect. Hakluyt, in describing the sufficiency of the\r\nEnglish soil to produce everything necessary in the manufacture of\r\ncloth, says: \"So as there wanteth, if colours might be brought in and\r\nmade naturall, but onely oile; the want whereof if any man could devise\r\nto supply at the full with anything that might become naturall in this\r\nrealme, he, whatsoever he were that might bring it about, might deserve\r\nimmortal fame in this our Commonwealth, and such a devise was offered to\r\nParliament and refused, because they denied to allow him a certain\r\nliberty, some others having obtained the same before that practised to\r\nwork that effect by Radish seed, which onely made a trial of small\r\nquantity, and that went no further to make that oile in plenty, and now\r\nhe that offered this devise was a merchant, and is dead, and withal the\r\ndevise is dead with him\" (\"Voiages,\" vol. ii.).\r\n\r\nThe Radish is not a native of Britain, but was probably introduced by\r\nthe Romans, and was well-known to the Anglo-Saxon gardener under its\r\npresent name, but with a closer approach to the Latin, being called\r\nRædic, or Radiolle.[237:1]\r\n\r\nA curious testimony to the former high reputation of the Radish survives\r\nin the \"Annual Radish Feast at Levens Hall, a custom dating from time\r\nimmemorial, and supposed by some to be a relic of feudal times, held on\r\nMay 12th at Levens Hall, the seat of the Hon. Mrs. Howard, and adjoining\r\nthe high road about midway between Kendal and Milnthorpe. Tradition hath\r\nit that the Radish feast arose out of a rivalry between the families of\r\nLevens Hall and Dallam Tower, as to which should entertain the\r\nCorporation with their friends and followers, and in which Levens Hall\r\neventually carried the palm. The feast is provided on the bowling green\r\nin front of the Hall, where several long tables are plentifully spread\r\nwith Radishes and brown bread and butter, the tables being repeatedly\r\nfurnished with guests\" (\"Gardener's Chronicle\").\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[237:1] \"Catholicon Anglicum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Four pounds of Prunes and as many of Raisins o' the sun.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (51).\r\n\r\nRaisins are alluded to, if not actually named, in \"1st Henry IV.,\" act\r\nii, sc. 4, when Falstaff says: \"If reasons were as plentiful as\r\nBlackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I----\" \"It\r\nseems that a pun underlies this, the association of reasons with\r\nBlackberries springing out of the fact that _reasons_ sounded like\r\n_raisins_.\"--EARLE, _Philology_, &c.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that Raisin is a corruption of _racemus_, a bunch of\r\nGrapes, we can understand that the word was not always applied, as it is\r\nnow, to the dried fruit, but was sometimes applied to the bunch of\r\nGrapes as it hung ripe on the tree--\r\n\r\n     \"For no man at the firste stroke\r\n      He may not felle down an Oke;\r\n      Nor of the Reisins have the wyne\r\n      Till Grapes be ripe and welle afyne.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose._\r\n\r\nThe best dried fruit were Raisins of the sun, _i.e._, dried in the sun,\r\nto distinguish them from those which were dried in ovens. They were, of\r\ncourse, foreign fruit, and were largely imported. The process of drying\r\nin the sun is still the method in use, at least, with \"the finer kinds,\r\nsuch as Muscatels, which are distinguished as much by the mode of drying\r\nas by the variety and soil in which they are grown, the finest being\r\ndried on the Vines before gathering, the stalk being partly cut through\r\nwhen the fruits are ripe, and the leaves being removed from near the\r\nclusters, so as to allow the full effect of the sun in ripening.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grape thus becomes a Raisin, but it is still further transformed\r\nwhen it reaches the cook; it then becomes a Plum, for Plum pudding has,\r\nas we all know, Raisins for its chief ingredient and certainly no Plums;\r\nand the Christmas pie into which Jack Horner put in his thumb and pulled\r\nout a Plum must have been a mince-pie, also made of Raisins; but how a\r\ncooked Raisin came to be called a Plum is not recorded. In Devonshire\r\nand Dorsetshire it undergoes a further transformation, for there Raisins\r\nare called Figs, and a Plum pudding is called a Fig pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _2nd Servant._\r\n\r\n     I had as lief have a Reed that will do me no service, as a\r\n       partizan I could not heave.\r\n\r\n                      _Antony and Cleopatra_, act ii, sc. 7 (13).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Arviragus._\r\n\r\n     Fear no more the frown o' the great,\r\n     Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;\r\n     Care no more to clothe and eat;\r\n     To thee the Reed is as the Oak;\r\n     The sceptre, learning, physick, must\r\n     All follow this, and come to dust.\r\n\r\n                                _Cymbeline_, act iv, sc. 2 (264).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Ariel._\r\n\r\n     His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops\r\n     From eaves of Reeds.\r\n\r\n                                    _Tempest_, act v, sc. 1 (16).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Ariel._\r\n\r\n     With hair up-staring--then like Reeds, not hair--\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act i, sc. 2 (213).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Hotspur._\r\n\r\n                Swift Severn's flood;\r\n     Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,\r\n     Ran fearfully among the trembling Reeds.\r\n\r\n                              _1st Henry IV_, act 1, sc. 3 (103).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Portia._\r\n\r\n     And speak between the change of man and boy\r\n     With a Reed voice.\r\n\r\n                       _Merchant of Venice_, act iii, sc. 4 (66).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Wooer._\r\n\r\n     In the great Lake that lies behind the Pallace\r\n     From the far shore thick set with Reeds and Sedges.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                The Rushes and the Reeds\r\n     Had so encompast it.\r\n\r\n                     _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1 (71, 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8)\r\n\r\n     To Simois' Reedy banks the red blood ran.\r\n\r\n                                                _Lucrece_ (1437).\r\n\r\nReed is a general term for almost any water-loving, grassy plant, and so\r\nit is used by Shakespeare. In the Bible it is perhaps possible to\r\nidentify some of the Reeds mentioned, with the Sugar Cane in some\r\nplaces, with the Papyrus in others, and in others with the Arundo donax.\r\nAs a Biblical plant it has a special interest, not only as giving the\r\nemblem of the tenderest mercy that will be careful even of \"the bruised\r\nReed,\" but also as entering largely into the mockery of the Crucifixion:\r\n\"They put a Reed in His right hand,\" and \"they filled a sponge full of\r\nvinegar, and put it upon a Reed and gave Him to drink.\" The Reed in\r\nthese passages was probably the Arundo donax, a very elegant Reed, which\r\nwas used for many purposes in Palestine, and is a most graceful plant\r\nfor English gardens, being perfectly hardy, and growing every year from\r\n12ft. to 14ft. in height, but very seldom flowering.[240:1]\r\n\r\nBut in Shakespeare, as in most writers, the Reed is simply the emblem of\r\nweakness, tossed about by and bending to a superior force, and of little\r\nor no use--\"a Reed that will do me no service\" (No. 1). It is also the\r\nemblem of the blessedness of submission, and of the power that lies in\r\nhumility to outlast its oppressor--\r\n\r\n     \"Like as in tempest great,\r\n        Where wind doth bear the stroke,\r\n      Much safer stands the bowing Reed\r\n        Then doth the stubborn Oak.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare mentions but two uses to which the Reed was applied, the\r\nthatching of houses (No. 3), and the making of Pan or Shepherd's pipes\r\n(No. 6). Nor has he anything to say of its beauty, yet the Reeds of our\r\nriver sides (_Arundo phragmites_) are most graceful plants, especially\r\nwhen they have their dark plumes of flowers, and this Milton seems to\r\nhave felt--\r\n\r\n     \"Forth flourish't thick the flustering Vine, forth crept\r\n      The swelling Gourd, up stood the Cornie Reed\r\n      Embattled in her field.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _Paradise Lost_, book vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[240:1] I have only been able to find one record of the flowering of\r\nArundo donax in England--\"Mem: Arundo donax in flower, 15th September,\r\n1762, the first time I ever saw it, but this very hot dry summer has\r\nmade many exotics flower. . . . It bears a handsome tassel of\r\nflowers.\"--P.

Lyte said: \"Rha, as it is thought, hath great broad\r\nleaves;\" and then he says: \"We have found here in the gardens of\r\ncertaine diligent herboristes that strange plant which is thought by\r\nsome to be Rha or Rhabarbum;\" but from the figure it is very certain\r\nthat the plant was not a Rheum. After the time of Parkinson, it was\r\nlargely grown for the sake of producing the drug, and it is still grown\r\nin England to some extent for the same purpose, chiefly in the\r\nneighbourhood of Banbury; though it is doubtful whether any of the\r\nspecies now grown in England are the true species that has long produced\r\nTurkey Rhubarb. The plant is now grown most extensively as a spring\r\nvegetable, though I cannot find when it first began to be so used.\r\nParkinson evidently tried it and thought well of it. \"The leaves have a\r\nfine acid taste; a syrup, therefore, made with the juice and sugar\r\ncannot but be very effectual in dejected appetites.\" Yet even in 1807\r\nProfessor Martyn, the editor of \"Millar's Dictionary,\" in a long article\r\non the Rhubarb, makes no mention of its culinary qualities, but in 1822\r\nPhillips speaks of it as largely cultivated for spring tarts, and forced\r\nfor the London markets, \"medical men recommending it as one of the most\r\ncooling and wholesome tarts sent to table.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant the Rhubarb is highly ornamental, though it is seldom\r\nseen out of the kitchen garden, but where room can be given to them,\r\nRheum palmatum or Rheum officinale, will always be admired as some of\r\nthe handsomest of foliage plants. The finest species of the family is\r\nthe Himalayan Rheum nobile, but it is exceedingly difficult to grow.\r\nBotanically the Rhubarb is allied to the Dock and Sorrel, and all the\r\nspecies are herbaceous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241:1] Quoted in Furnival's forewords to Boorde's \"Introduction to\r\nKnowledge,\" p. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast?\r\n       Three pound of sugar, five pound of Currants, Rice----What\r\n       will this sister of mine do with Rice?[242:1]\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 3 (38).\r\n\r\nShakespeare may have had no more acquaintance with Rice than his\r\nknowledge of the imported grain, which seems to have been long ago\r\nintroduced into England, for in a Nominale of the fifteenth century we\r\nhave \"Hoc risi, indeclinabile, Ryse.\" And in the \"Promptorium\r\nParvulorum,\" \"Ryce, frute. Risia, vel risi, n. indecl. secundum quosdam,\r\nvel risium, vel risorum granum (rizi vel granum Indicum).\" Turner was\r\nacquainted with it: \"Ryse groweth plentuously in watery myddowes between\r\nMyllane and Pavia.\"[242:2] And Shakespeare may have seen the plant, for\r\nGerard grew it in his London garden, though \"the floure did not show\r\nitselfe by reason of the injurie of our unseasonable yeare 1596.\" It is\r\na native of Africa, and was soon transferred to Europe as a nourishing\r\nand wholesome grain, especially for invalids--\"sume hoc ptisanarium\r\noryzæ,\" says the doctor to his patient in Horace, and it is mentioned\r\nboth by Dioscorides and Theophrastus. It has been occasionally grown in\r\nEngland as a curiosity, but seldom comes to any perfection out-of-doors,\r\nas it requires a mixture of moisture and heat that we cannot easily give\r\nit.

To quote these it would be necessary\r\nto extract an entire act, which is very graphic, but too long. I must,\r\ntherefore, content myself with the beginning and the end of the chief\r\nscene, and refer the reader who desires to see it _in extenso_ to \"1st\r\nHenry VI.,\" act ii, sc. 4. The scene is in the Temple Gardens, and\r\nPlantagenet and Somerset thus begin the fatal quarrel--\r\n\r\n     _Plantagenet._\r\n\r\n     Let him that is a true-born gentleman\r\n     And stands upon the honour of his birth,\r\n     If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,\r\n     From off this Brier pluck a White Rose with me.\r\n\r\n     _Somerset._\r\n\r\n     Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,\r\n     But dare maintain the party of the truth,\r\n     Pluck a Red Rose from off this Thorn with me.\r\n\r\nAnd Warwick's wise conclusion on the whole matter is--\r\n\r\n                            This brawl to-day,\r\n     Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,\r\n     Shall send, between the Red Rose and the White,\r\n     A thousand souls to death and deadly night.\r\n\r\nThere are further allusions to the same Red and White Roses in \"3rd\r\nHenry VI.,\" act i, sc. 1 and 2, act ii, sc. 5, and act v, sc. 1; \"1st\r\nHenry VI.,\" act iv, sc. 1; and \"Richard III.,\" act v, sc. 4.\r\n\r\nThere is no flower so often mentioned by Shakespeare as the Rose, and he\r\nwould probably consider it the queen of flowers, for it was so deemed in\r\nhis time. \"The Rose doth deserve the cheefest and most principall place\r\namong all flowers whatsoever, being not onely esteemed for his beautie,\r\nvertues, and his fragrant and odoriferous smell, but also because it is\r\nthe honore and ornament of our English Scepter.\"--GERARD. Yet the\r\nkingdom of the Rose even then was not undisputed; the Lily was always\r\nits rival (_see_ LILY), for thus sang Walter de Biblesworth in the\r\nthirteenth century--\r\n\r\n     \"En ço verger troveroums les flurs\r\n      Des queus issunt les doux odours (swote smel)\r\n      Les herbes ausi pur medicine\r\n      La flur de Rose, la flur de Liz (lilie)\r\n      Liz vaut per royne, Rose pur piz.\"\r\n\r\nBut a little later the great Scotch poet Dunbar, who lived from 1460 to\r\n1520, that is, a century before Shakespeare, asserted the dignity of the\r\nRose as even superior to the Thistle of Scotland.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor hold none other flower in sic dainty\r\n        As the fresh Rose of colour red and white;\r\n      For if thou dost, hurt is thine honesty,\r\n        Considering that no flower is so perfite,\r\n        So full of virtue, pleasaunce, and delight,\r\n      So full of blissful angelic beauty,\r\n      Imperial birth, honour, and dignity.\"\r\n\r\nVolumes have been written, and many more may still be written, on the\r\ndelights of the Rose, but my present business is only with the Roses of\r\nShakespeare. In many of the above passages the Rose is simply the emblem\r\nof all that is loveliest and brightest and most beautiful upon earth,\r\nyet always with the underlying sentiment that even the brightest has its\r\ndark side, as the Rose has its thorns; that the worthiest objects of our\r\nearthly love are at the very best but short-lived; that the most\r\nbeautiful has on it the doom of decay and death. These were the lessons\r\nwhich even the heathen writers learned from their favourite Roses, and\r\nwhich Christian writers of all ages loved to learn also, not from the\r\nheathen writers, but from the beautiful flowers themselves. \"The Rose is\r\na beautiful flower,\" said St. Basil, \"but it always fills me with sorrow\r\nby reminding me of my sins, for which the earth was doomed to bear\r\nthorns.\" And it would be easy to fill a volume, and it would not be a\r\ncheerless volume, with beautiful and expressive passages from poets,\r\npreachers, and other authors, who have taken the Rose to point the moral\r\nof the fleeting nature of all earthly things. Herrick in four lines\r\ntells the whole--\r\n\r\n     \"Gather ye Roses while ye may\r\n        Old time is still a-flying,\r\n      And the same flower that smiles to-day,\r\n        To-morrow will be dying.\"\r\n\r\nBut Shakespeare's notices of the Rose are not all emblematical and\r\nallegorical. He mentions these distinct sorts of Roses--the Red Rose,\r\nthe White Rose, the Musk Rose, the Provençal Rose, the Damask Rose, the\r\nVariegated Rose, the Canker Rose, and the Sweet Briar.\r\n\r\nThe Canker Rose is the wild Dog Rose, and the name is sometimes applied\r\nto the common Red Poppy.\r\n\r\nThe Red Rose and the Provençal Rose (No. 13) are no doubt the same, and\r\nare what we now call R. centifolia, or the Cabbage Rose; a Rose that has\r\nbeen supposed to be a native of the South of Europe, but Dr. Lindley\r\npreferred \"to place its native country in Asia, because it has been\r\nfound wild by Bieberstein with double flowers, on the eastern side of\r\nMount Caucasus, whither it is not likely to have escaped from a\r\ngarden.\"[250:1] We do not know when it was introduced into England, but\r\nit was familiar to Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"The savour of the Roses swote\r\n      Me smote right to the herté rote,\r\n      As I hadde alle embawmed be.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Of Roses there were grete wone,\r\n      So faire were never in Rone.\"\r\n\r\n_i.e._, in Provence, at the mouth of the Rhone. For beauty in shape and\r\nexquisite fragrance, I consider this Rose to be still unrivalled; but it\r\nis not a fashionable Rose, and is usually found in cottage gardens, or\r\nperhaps in some neglected part of gardens of more pretensions. I believe\r\nit is considered too loose in shape to satisfy the floral critics of\r\nexhibition flowers, and it is only a summer Rose, and so contrasts\r\nunfavourably with the Hybrid Perpetuals. Still, it is a delightful Rose,\r\ndelightful to the eye, delightful for its fragrance, and most delightful\r\nfrom its associations.\r\n\r\nThe White Rose of York (No. 20) has never been satisfactorily\r\nidentified. It was clearly a cultivated Rose, and by some is supposed to\r\nhave been only the wild White Rose (_R. arvensis_) grown in a garden.\r\nBut it is very likely to have been the Rosa alba, which was a favourite\r\nin English gardens in Shakespeare's time, and was very probably\r\nintroduced long before his time, for it is the double variety of the\r\nwild White Rose, and Gerard says of it: \"The double White Rose doth grow\r\nwilde in many hedges of Lancashire in great abundance, even as Briers do\r\nwith us in these southerly parts, especially in a place of the countrey\r\ncalled Leyland, and in a place called Roughford, not far from Latham.\"\r\nIt was, therefore, not a new gardener's plant in his time, as has been\r\noften stated. I have little doubt that this is the White Rose of York;\r\nit is not the R. alba of Dr. Lindley's monograph, but the double variety\r\nof the British R. arvensis.\r\n\r\nThe White Rose has a very ancient interest for Englishmen, for \"long\r\nbefore the brawl in the Temple Gardens, the flower had been connected\r\nwith one of the most ancient names of our island. The elder Pliny, in\r\ndiscussing the etymology of the word Albion, suggests that the land may\r\nhave been so named from the White Roses which abounded in it--'Albion\r\ninsula sic dicta ab albis rupibus, quas mare alluit, vel ob rosas\r\nalbas quibus abundat.' Whatever we may think of the etymological\r\nskill displayed in the suggestion . . . we look with almost a new\r\npleasure on the Roses of our own hedgerows, when regarding them as\r\ndescended in a straight line from the 'rosas albas' of those far-off\r\nsummers.\"--_Quarterly Review_, vol. cxiv.\r\n\r\nThe Damask Rose (No. 5) remains to us under the same name, telling its\r\nown history. There can be little doubt that the Rose came from Damascus,\r\nprobably introduced into Europe by the Crusaders or some of the early\r\ntravellers in the East, who speak in glowing terms of the beauties of\r\nthe gardens of Damascus. So Sir John Mandeville describes the city--\"In\r\nthat Cytee of Damasce, there is gret plentee of Welles, and with in the\r\nCytee and with oute, ben many fayre Gardynes and of dyverse frutes. Non\r\nother Cytee is not lyche in comparison to it, of fayre Gardynes, and of\r\nfayre desportes.\"--_Voiage and Travaile_, cap. xi. And in our own day\r\nthe author of \"Eöthen\" described the same gardens as he saw them: \"High,\r\nhigh above your head, and on every side all down to the ground, the\r\nthicket is hemmed in and choked up by the interlacing boughs that droop\r\nwith the weight of Roses, and load the slow air with their damask\r\nbreath. There are no other flowers. The Rose trees which I saw were all\r\nof the kind we call 'damask;' they grow to an immense height and\r\nsize.\"--_Eöthen_, ch. xxvii. It was not till long after the Crusades\r\nthat the Damask Rose was introduced into England, for Hakluyt in 1582\r\nsays: \"In time of memory many things have been brought in that were not\r\nhere before, as the Damaske Rose by Doctour Linaker, King Henry the\r\nSeventh and King Henrie the Eight's Physician.\"--_Voiages_, vol.\r\nii.[252:1]\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental Rose the Damask Rose is still a favourite, though\r\nprobably the real typical Rosa Damascena is very seldom seen--but it has\r\nbeen the parent of a large number of hybrid Roses, which the most\r\ncritical Rosarian does not reject. The whole family are very\r\nsweet-scented, so that \"sweet as Damask Roses\" was a proverb, and Gerard\r\ndescribes the common Damaske as \"in other respects like the White Rose;\r\nthe especiale difference consisteth in the colour and smell of the\r\nfloures, for these are of a pale red colour and of a more pleasant\r\nsmell, and fitter for meate or medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Musk Roses (No. 1) were great favourites with our forefathers. This\r\nRose (_R. moschata_) is a native of the North of Africa and of Spain,\r\nand has been also found in Nepaul. Hakluyt gives the exact date of its\r\nintroduction. \"The turkey cockes and hennes,\" he says, \"were brought\r\nabout fifty yeres past, the Artichowe in time of King Henry the Eight,\r\nand of later times was procured out of Italy the Muske Rose plant, the\r\nPlumme called the Perdigwena, and two kindes more by the Lord Cromwell\r\nafter his travel.\"--_Voiages_, vol. ii. It is a long straggling Rose,\r\nbearing bunches of single flowers, and is very seldom seen except\r\nagainst the walls of some old houses. \"You remember the great bush at\r\nthe corner of the south wall just by the blue drawing-room windows; that\r\nis the old Musk Rose, Shakespeare's Musk Rose, which is dying out\r\nthrough the kingdom now.\"--_My Lady Ludlow_, by Mrs. Gaskell. But\r\nwherever it is grown it is highly prized, not so much for the beauty as\r\nfor the delicate scent of its flowers. The scent is unlike the scent of\r\nany other Rose, or of any other flower, but it is very pleasant, and not\r\noverpowering; and the plant has the peculiarity that, like the Sweet\r\nBriar, but unlike other Roses, it gives out its scent of its own accord\r\nand unsought, and chiefly in the evening, so that if the window of a\r\nbedroom near which this rose is trained is left open, the scent will\r\nsoon be perceived in the room. This peculiarity did not escape the\r\nnotice of Lord Bacon. \"Because the breath of flowers,\" he says, \"is far\r\nsweeter in the air (when it comes and goes like the warbling of music)\r\nthan in the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to\r\nknow what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air. Roses,\r\ndamask and red, are fast flowers of their smells, so that you may walk\r\nby a whole row of them, and find nothing of their sweetness, yea, though\r\nit be in a morning's dew. Bays, likewise, yield no smell as they grow,\r\nRosemary little, nor Sweet Marjoram; that which above all others yields\r\nthe sweetest smell in the air is the Violet, especially the white double\r\nViolet which comes twice a year, about the middle of April, and about\r\nBartholomew-tide; next to that is the Musk-rose.\"--_Essay of Gardens._\r\n\r\nThe Roses mentioned in Nos. 34, 51, and 52 as a mixture of red and white\r\nmust have been the mottled or variegated Roses, commonly called the York\r\nand Lancaster Roses;[253:1] these are old Roses, and very probably\r\nquite as old as the sixteenth century. There are two varieties: in one\r\neach petal is blotched with white and pink; this is the R. versicolor of\r\nParkinson, and is a variety of R. Damascena; in the other most of the\r\npetals are white, but with a mixture of pink petals; this is the Rosa\r\nmundi or Gloria mundi, and is a variety of R. Gallica.\r\n\r\nThese, with the addition of the Eglantine or Sweet Brier (_see_\r\nEGLANTINE), are the only Roses that Shakespeare directly names, and they\r\nwere the chief sorts grown in his time, but not the only sorts; and to\r\nwhat extent Roses were cultivated in Shakespeare's time we have a\r\ncurious proof in the account of the grant of Ely Place, in Holborn, the\r\nproperty of the Bishops of Ely. \"The tenant was Sir Christopher Hatton\r\n(Queen Elizabeth's handsome Lord Chancellor) to whom the greater portion\r\nof the house was let in 1576 for the term of twenty-one years. The rent\r\nwas a Red Rose, ten loads of hay, and ten pounds per annum; Bishop Cox,\r\non whom this hard bargain was forced by the Queen, reserving to himself\r\nand his successors the right of walking in the gardens, and gathering\r\ntwenty bushels of Roses yearly.\"--CUNNINGHAM. We have records also of\r\nthe garden cultivation of the Rose in London long before Shakespeare's\r\ntime. \"In the Earl of Lincoln's garden in Holborn in 24 Edw. I., the\r\nonly flowers named are Roses, of which a quantity was sold, producing\r\nthree shillings and twopence.\"--HUDSON TURNER.\r\n\r\nMy space forbids me to enter more largely into any account of these old\r\nspecies, or to say much of the many very interesting points in the\r\nhistory of the Rose, but two or three points connected with\r\nShakespeare's Roses must not be passed over. First, its name. He says\r\nthrough Juliet (No. 36) that the Rose by any other name would smell as\r\nsweet. But the whole world is against him. Rose was its old Latin name\r\ncorrupted from its older Greek name, and the same name, with slight and\r\neasily-traced differences, has clung to it in almost all European\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nShakespeare also mentions its uses in Rose-water and Rose-cakes, and it\r\nwas only natural to suppose that a flower so beautiful and so sweet was\r\nmeant by Nature to be of great use to man. Accordingly we find that\r\nwonderful virtues were attributed to it,[255:1] and an especial virtue\r\nwas attributed to the dewdrops that settled on the full-blown Rose.\r\nShakespeare alludes to these in Nos. 22 and 27; and from these were made\r\ncosmetics only suited to the most extravagant.\r\n\r\n     \"The water that did spryng from ground\r\n        She would not touch at all,\r\n      But washt her hands with dew of Heaven\r\n        That on sweet Roses fall.\"\r\n\r\n      _The Lamentable Fall of Queen Ellinor._--Roxburghe Ballads.\r\n\r\nAnd as with their uses, so it was also with their history. Such a flower\r\nmust have a high origin, and what better origin than the pretty mediæval\r\nlegend told to us by Sir John Mandeville?--\"At Betheleim is the Felde\r\n_Floridus_, that is to seyne, the _Feld florisched_; for als moche as a\r\nfayre mayden was blamed with wrong and sclaundered, for whiche cause\r\nsche was demed to the Dethe, and to be brent in that place, to the\r\nwhiche she was ladd; and as the Fyre began to brent about hire, sche\r\nmade hire preyeres to oure Lord, that als wissely as sche was not gylty\r\nof that Synne, that He wolde helpe hire and make it to be knowen to alle\r\nmen, of his mercyfulle grace. And when sche hadde thus seyd, sche\r\nentered into the Fuyr; and anon was the Fuyr quenched and oute; and the\r\nBrondes that weren brennynge becomen red Roseres, and the Brondes that\r\nweren not kyndled becomen white Roseres, full of Roses. And these weren\r\nthe first Roseres and Roses, both white and rede, that evere ony man\r\nsaughe.\"--_Voiage and Travaile_, cap. vi.\r\n\r\nWith this pretty legend I may well conclude the account of Shakespeare's\r\nRoses, commending, however, M. Biron's sensible remarks on unseasonable\r\nflowers (No. 26) to those who estimate the beauty of a flower or\r\nanything else in proportion to its being produced out of its natural\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[244:1] This was a familiar idea with the old writers: \"Therefore,\r\nsister Bud, grow wise by my folly, and know it is far greater happinesse\r\nto lose thy virginity in a good hand than to wither on the stalk whereon\r\nthou growest.\"--THOMAS FULLER, _Antheologia_, p. 32. (See also Chester's\r\n\"Cantoes,\" No. 13, p. 137, New Shak. Soc.)\r\n\r\n[245:1] \"Non vivunt contra naturam, qui hieme concupiscunt\r\nrosas?\"--SENECA, _Ep._ 122.\r\n\r\n[250:1] We have an old record of the existence of large double Roses in\r\nAsia by Herodotus, who tells us, that in a part of Macedonia were the\r\nso-called gardens of Midas, in which grew native Roses, each one having\r\nsixty petals, and of a scent surpassing all others (\"Hist.,\" viii. 138).\r\n\r\n[252:1] The Damask Rose was imported into England at an earlier date but\r\nprobably only as a drug. It is mentioned in a \"Bill of Medicynes\r\nfurnished for the use of Edward I., 1306-7: 'Item pro aqua rosata de\r\nDamasc,' lb. xl, iiii_li._\"--_Archæological Journal_, vol. xiv. 271.\r\n\r\n[253:1] The York and Lancaster Roses were a frequent subject for the\r\nepigram writers; and gave occasion for one of the happiest of English\r\nepigrams. On presenting a White Rose to a Lancastrian lady--\r\n\r\n     \"If this fair Rose offend thy sight,\r\n        It in thy bosom wear;\r\n      'Twill blush to find itself less white,\r\n        And turn Lancastrian there.\"\r\n\r\n[255:1] \"A Rose beside his beauty is a cure.\"--G.

It was very early introduced\r\ninto England, and is mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon Herbarium under its\r\nLatin name of Ros marinus, and is there translated by Bothen, _i.e._\r\nThyme; also in an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the eleventh century, where\r\nit is translated Feld-madder and Sun-dew. In these places our present\r\nplant may or may not be meant, but there is no doubt that it is the one\r\nreferred to in an ancient English poem of the fourteenth century, on the\r\nvirtues of herbs, published in Wright and Halliwell's \"Reliquiæ\r\nAntiquæ.\" The account of \"The Gloriouse Rosemaryne\" is long, but the\r\nbeginning and ending are worth quoting--\r\n\r\n     \"This herbe is callit Rosemaryn\r\n      Of vertu that is gode and fyne;\r\n      But alle the vertues tell I ne cane,\r\n      No I trawe no erthely man.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Of thys herbe telles Galiene\r\n      That in hys contree was a quene,\r\n      Gowtus and Crokyt as he hath tolde,\r\n      And eke sexty yere olde;\r\n      Sor and febyl, where men hyr sey\r\n      Scho semyth wel for to dey;\r\n      Of Rosmaryn scho toke sex pow̄de,\r\n      And grownde hyt wel in a stownde,\r\n      And bathed hir threyes everi day,\r\n      Nine mowthes, as I herde say,\r\n      And afterwarde anoynitte wel hyr hede\r\n      With good bame as I rede;\r\n      Away fel alle that olde flessche,\r\n      And yow̄ge i-sprong tender and nessche;\r\n      So fresshe to be scho then began\r\n      Scho coveytede couplede be to man.\" (Vol. i, 196).\r\n\r\nWe can now scarcely understand the high favour in which Rosemary was\r\nformerly held; we are accustomed to see it neglected, or only tolerated\r\nin some corner of the kitchen garden, and not often tolerated there. But\r\nit was very different in Shakespeare's time, when it was in high favour\r\nfor its evergreen leaves and fine aromatic scent, remaining a long time\r\nafter picking, so long, indeed, that both leaves and scent were almost\r\nconsidered everlasting. This was its great charm, and so Spenser spoke\r\nof it as \"the cheerful Rosemarie\" and \"refreshing Rosemarine,\" and good\r\nSir Thomas More had a great affection for it. \"As for Rosemarine,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I lett it run alle over my garden walls, not onlie because my\r\nbees love it, but because tis the herb sacred to remembrance, and\r\ntherefore to friendship; whence a sprig of it hath a dumb language that\r\nmaketh it the chosen emblem at our funeral wakes and in our buriall\r\ngrounds.\" And Parkinson gives a similar account of its popularity as a\r\ngarden plant: \"Being in every woman's garden, it were sufficient but to\r\nname it as an ornament among other sweet herbs and flowers in our\r\ngardens. In this our land, where it hath been planted in noblemen's and\r\ngreat men's gardens against brick walls, and there continued long, it\r\nriseth up in time unto a very great height, with a great and woody stem\r\nof that compasse that, being cloven out into boards, it hath served to\r\nmake lutes or such like instruments, and here with us carpenters' rules\r\nand to divers others purposes.\" It was the favourite evergreen wherever\r\nthe occasion required an emblem of constancy and perpetual remembrance,\r\nsuch especially as weddings and funerals, at both of which it was\r\nlargely used; and so says Herrick of \"The Rosemarie Branch\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Grow for two ends, it matters not at all,\r\n      Be't for my bridall or my buriall.\"\r\n\r\nIts use at funerals was very widespread, for Laurembergius records a\r\npretty custom in use in his day, 1631, at Frankfort: \"Is mos apud nos\r\nretinetur, dum cupresso humile, vel rore marino, non solum coronamus\r\nfunera jamjam ducenda, sed et iis appendimus ex iisdem herbis litteras\r\ncollectas, significatrices nominis ejus quæ defuncta est. Nam in\r\npuellarum funeribus hæc fere fieri solent\" (\"Horticulturæ,\" cap. vj.).\r\n\r\nIts use at weddings is pleasantly told in the old ballad of \"The Bride's\r\nGood-morrow\"--\r\n\r\n     \"The house is drest and garnisht for your sake\r\n        With flowers gallant and green;\r\n      A solemn feast your comely cooks do ready make,\r\n        Where all your friends will be seen:\r\n      Young men and maids do ready stand\r\n      With sweet Rosemary in their hand--\r\n        A perfect token of your virgin's life.\r\n      To wait upon you they intend\r\n      Unto the church to make an end:\r\n        And God make thee a joyfull wedded wife.\"\r\n\r\n                                     _Roxburghe Ballads_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nIt probably is one of the most lasting of evergreens after being\r\ngathered, though we can scarcely credit the statement recorded by\r\nPhillips that \"it is the custom in France to put a branch of Rosemary in\r\nthe hands of the dead when in the coffin, and we are told by Valmont\r\nBomare, in his 'Histoire Naturelle,' that when the coffins have been\r\nopened after several years, the plant has been found to have vegetated\r\nso much that the leaves have covered the corpse.\" These were the\r\ngeneral and popular uses of the Rosemary, but it was of high repute as a\r\nmedicine, and still holds a place, though not so high as formerly, in\r\nthe \"Pharmacopœia.\" \"Rosemary,\" says Parkinson, \"is almost of as\r\ngreat use as Bayes, both for inward and outward remedies, and as well\r\nfor civill as physicall purposes--inwardly for the head and heart,\r\noutwardly for the sinews and joynts; for civile uses, as all do know, at\r\nweddings, funerals, &c., to bestow among friends; and the physicall are\r\nso many that you might as well be tyred in the reading as I in the\r\nwriting, if I should set down all that might be said of it.\"\r\n\r\nWith this high character we may well leave this good, old-fashioned\r\nplant, merely noting that the name is popularly but erroneously supposed\r\nto mean the Rose of Mary. It has no connection with either Rose or Mary,\r\nbut is the Ros marinus, or Ros Maris (as in Ovid--\r\n\r\n     \"Ros maris, et laurus, nigraque myrtus olent;\"\r\n\r\n                                      _De Arte Aman._, iii, 390),\r\n\r\nthe plant that delights in the sea-spray; and so the old spelling was\r\nRosmarin. Gower says of the Star Alpheta--\r\n\r\n     \"His herbe proper is Rosmarine;\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Conf. Aman._, lib. sept.\r\n\r\na spelling which Shenstone adopted--\r\n\r\n     \"And here trim Rosmarin that whilom crowned\r\n      The daintiest garden of the proudest peer.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also sometimes called Guardrobe, being \"put into chests and\r\npresses among clothes, to preserve them from mothes and other vermine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[256:1] Grace was symbolized by the Rue, or Herb of Grace, and\r\nremembrance by the Rosemary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Perdita._\r\n\r\n     For you there's Rosemary and Rue.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (74).\r\n                                         (_See_ ROSEMARY, No. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Gardener._\r\n\r\n     Here did she fall a tear; here in this place\r\n     I'll set a bank of Rue, sour Herb of Grace:\r\n     Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall beseen,\r\n     In the remembrance of a weeping queen.\r\n\r\n                              _Richard II_, act iii, sc. 4 (104).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Antony._\r\n\r\n     Grace grow where these drops fall.\r\n\r\n                      _Antony and Cleopatra_, act iv, sc. 2 (38).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Ophelia._\r\n\r\n     There's Rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it\r\n       Herb-grace o' Sundays: O, you must wear your Rue with a\r\n       difference.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 5 (181).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     Indeed, sir, she was the Sweet Marjoram of the salad, or\r\n       rather the Herb of Grace.\r\n\r\n     _Lafeu._\r\n\r\n     They are not salad-herbs, you knave, they are nose-herbs.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act iv, sc. 5 (17).\r\n\r\nComparing (2) and (3) together, there is little doubt that the same herb\r\nis alluded to in both; and it is, perhaps, alluded to, though not\r\nexactly named, in the following:\r\n\r\n     _Friar Laurence._\r\n\r\n     In man, as well as herbs, grace and rude will.\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act ii, sc. 3 (28).\r\n\r\nShakespeare thus gives us the two names for the same plant, Rue and Herb\r\nof Grace, and though at first sight there seems to be little or no\r\nconnection between the two names, yet really they are so closely\r\nconnected, that the one name was derived from, or rather suggested by,\r\nthe other. Rue is the English form of the Greek and Latin _ruta_, a word\r\nwhich has never been explained, and in its earlier English form of\r\n_rude_ came still nearer to the Latin original. But _ruth_ was the\r\nEnglish word for sorrow and remorse, and _to rue_ was to be sorry for\r\nanything, or to have pity;[260:1] we still say a man will rue a\r\nparticular action, _i.e._, be sorry for it; and so it was a natural\r\nthing to say that a plant which was so bitter, and had always borne the\r\nname _Rue_ or _Ruth_, must be connected with repentance. It was,\r\ntherefore, the Herb of Repentance, and this was soon transformed into\r\nthe Herb of Grace (in 1838 Loudon said, \"It is to this day called Ave\r\nGrace in Sussex\"), repentance being the chief sign of grace; and it is\r\nnot unlikely that this idea was strengthened by the connection of Rue\r\nwith the bitter herbs of the Bible, though it is only once mentioned,\r\nand then with no special remark, except as a tithable garden herb,\r\ntogether with Anise and Cummin.\r\n\r\nThe Rue, like Lavender and Rosemary, is a native of the more barren\r\nparts of the coasts of the Mediterranean, and has been found on Mount\r\nTabor, but it was one of the earliest occupants of the English Herb\r\ngarden. It is very frequently mentioned in the Saxon Leech Books, and\r\nentered so largely into their prescriptions that it must have been very\r\nextensively grown. Its strong aromatic smell,[261:1] and bitter taste,\r\nwith the blistering quality of the leaves, soon established its\r\ncharacter as almost a heal-all.\r\n\r\n     \"Rew bitter a worthy gres (herb)\r\n      Mekyl of myth and vertu is.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Stockholm MS._, 1305.\r\n\r\nEven beasts were supposed to have discovered its virtues, so that\r\nweasels were gravely said, and this by such men as Pliny, to eat Rue\r\nwhen they were preparing themselves for a fight with rats and serpents.\r\nIts especial virtue was an eye-salve, a use which Milton did not\r\noverlook--\r\n\r\n                              \"To nobler sights\r\n     Michael from Adam's eyes the filme removed\r\n     Which that false fruit which promised clearer sight\r\n     Had bred; then purged with Euphrasie and Rue\r\n     The visual nerve, for he had much to see:\"\r\n\r\n                                       _Paradise Lost_, book xi.;\r\n\r\nand which was more fully stated in the old lines of the Schola Salerni--\r\n\r\n     \"Nobilis est Ruta quia lumina reddit acuta;\r\n      Auxilio rutæ, vir lippe, videbis acute;\r\n      Cruda comesta recens oculos Caligine purgat;\r\n      Ruta facit castum, dat lumen, et ingerit astum;\r\n      Cocta facit Ruta et de pollicibus loca tuta.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading this high moral and physical character of the herb, it is\r\nrather startling to find that \"It is believed that if stolen from a\r\nneighbour's garden it would prosper better.\" It was, however, an old\r\nbelief--\r\n\r\n     \"They sayen eke stolen sede is butt the bette.\"\r\n\r\n                     _Palladius on Husbandrie_ (c. 1420) iv, 269.\r\n\r\n\"It is a common received opinion that Rue will grow the better if it\r\nbee filtched out of another man's garden.\"--HOLLAND'S _Pliny_, xix. 7.\r\n\r\nAs other medicines were introduced the Rue declined in favour, so that\r\nParkinson spoke of it with qualified praise--\"Without doubt it is a most\r\nwholesom herb, although bitter and strong. Some do rip up a bead-rowl of\r\nthe virtues of Rue, . . . but beware of the too-frequent or overmuch use\r\ntherof.\" And Dr. Daubeny says of it, \"It is a powerful stimulant and\r\nnarcotic, but not much used in modern practise.\"\r\n\r\nAs a garden plant, the Rue forms a pretty shrub for a rock-work, if\r\nsomewhat attended to, so as to prevent its becoming straggling and\r\nuntidy. The delicate green and peculiar shape of the leaves give it a\r\ndistinctive character, which forms a good contrast to other plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[260:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Rewe on my child, that of thyn gentilnesse\r\n      Rewest on every sinful in destresse.\"\r\n\r\n                                CHAUCER, _The Man of Lawes Tale_.\r\n\r\n[261:1] \"Ranke-smelling Rue.\"--SPENSER, _Muiopotmos_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Rosalind._\r\n\r\n     He taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of\r\n       Rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\r\n\r\n                          _As You Like It_, act iii, sc. 2 (388).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Phœbe._\r\n\r\n                 Lean but on a Rush,\r\n     The cicatrice and capable impressure\r\n     Thy palm some moment keeps.\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 5 (22).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Clown._\r\n\r\n     As fit as Tib's Rush for Tom's forefinger.\r\n\r\n                 _All's Well that Ends Well_, act ii, sc. 2 (24).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Romeo._\r\n\r\n                 Let wantons light of heart\r\n     Tickle the senseless Rushes with their heels.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act i, sc. 4 (35).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Dromio of Syracuse._\r\n\r\n     Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,\r\n     A Rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\r\n     A Nut, a Cherry-stone.\r\n\r\n                          _Comedy of Errors_, act iv, sc. 3 (72).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Bastard._\r\n\r\n                 A Rush will be a beam\r\n     To hang thee on.\r\n\r\n                                _King John_, act iv, sc. 3 (129).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _1st Groom._\r\n\r\n     More Rushes, more Rushes.\r\n\r\n                                _2nd Henry IV_, act v, sc. 5 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Eros._\r\n\r\n     He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns\r\n     The Rush that lies before him.\r\n\r\n                     _Antony and Cleopatra_, act iii, sc. 5 (17).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Othello._\r\n\r\n     Man but a Rush against Othello's breast,\r\n     And he retires.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act v, sc. 2 (270).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (10) _Grumio._\r\n\r\n     Is supper ready, the house trimmed, Rushes strewed, cobwebs\r\n       swept?\r\n\r\n                       _Taming of the Shrew_, act iv, sc. 1 (47).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (11) _Katherine._\r\n\r\n     Be it moon or sun, or what you please,\r\n     And if you please to call it a Rush-candle,\r\n     Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 5 (13).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (12) _Glendower._\r\n\r\n     She bids you on the wanton Rushes lay you down,\r\n     And rest your gentle head upon her lap.\r\n\r\n                            _1st Henry IV_, act iii, sc. 1 (214).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (13) _Marcius._\r\n\r\n                        He that depends\r\n     Upon your favours swims with fins of lead\r\n     And hews down Oaks with Rushes.\r\n\r\n                                _Coriolanus_, act i, sc. 1 (183).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (14) _Iachimo._\r\n\r\n                     Our Tarquin thus\r\n     Did softly press the Rushes.\r\n\r\n                                 _Cymbeline_, act ii, sc. 2 (12).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (15) _Senator._\r\n                          Our gates\r\n     Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with Rushes!\r\n     They'll open of themselves.\r\n\r\n                                 _Coriolanus_, act i, sc. 4 (16).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (16)\r\n\r\n     And being lighted, by the light he spies\r\n     Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks;\r\n     He takes it from the Rushes where it lies.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Lucrece_ (316).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (17) _See_ REEDS, No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (18) _Wooer._\r\n\r\n                      Rings she made\r\n     Of Rushes that grew by, and to 'em spoke\r\n     The prettiest posies.\r\n\r\n                        _Two Noble Kinsmen_, act iv, sc. 1 (109).\r\n\r\n_See also_ FLAG, REED, _and_ BULRUSH.\r\n\r\nLike the Reed, the Rush often stands for any water-loving, grassy\r\nplant, and, like the Reed, it was the emblem of yielding weakness and of\r\nuselessness.[264:1] The three principal Rushes referred to by\r\nShakespeare are the Common Rush (_Juncus communis_), the Bulrush\r\n(_Scirpus lacustris_), and the Sweet Rush (_Acorus calamus_).\r\n\r\nThe Common Rush, though the mark of badly cultivated ground, and the\r\nemblem of uselessness, was not without its uses, some of which are\r\nreferred to in Nos. 1, 3, and 11. In Nos. 3 and 18 reference is made to\r\nthe Rush-ring, a ring, no doubt, originally meant and used for the\r\npurposes of honest betrothal, but afterwards so vilely used for the\r\npurposes of mock marriages, that even as early as 1217 Richard Bishop of\r\nSalisbury had to issue his edict against the use of \"annulum de junco.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rush betrothal ring is mentioned by Spenser--\r\n\r\n     \"O thou great shepheard, Lobbin, how great is thy griefe!\r\n      Where bene the nosegayes that she dight for thee?\r\n      The coloured chaplets wrought with a chiefe,\r\n      The knotted Rush-ringes and gilt Rosemarie.\"\r\n\r\n                                 _Shepherd's Calendar--November._\r\n\r\nAnd by Quarles--\r\n\r\n                                  \"Love-sick swains\r\n     Compose Rush-rings, and Myrtle-berry chains,\r\n     And stuck with glorious King-cups in their bonnets,\r\n     Adorned with Laurel slip, chant true love sonnets.\"\r\n\r\nBut the uses of the Rush were not all bad. Newton, in 1587, said of the\r\nRush--\"It is a round smooth shoote without joints or knots, having\r\nwithin it a white substance or pith, which being drawn forth showeth\r\nlike long white, soft, gentle, and round thread, and serveth for many\r\npurposes. Heerewith be made manie pretie imagined devises for Bride-ales\r\nand other solemnities, as little baskets, hampers, frames, pitchers,\r\ndishes, combs, brushes, stooles, chaires, purses with strings, girdles,\r\nand manie such other pretie and curious and artificiall conceits, which\r\nat such times many do take the paines to make and hang up in their\r\nhouses, as tokens of good will to the new married Bride; and after the\r\nsolemnities ended, to bestow abroad for Bride-gifts or presents.\" It was\r\nthis \"white substance or pith\" from which the Rush candle (No. 11) was\r\nand still is made: a candle which in early days was probably the\r\nuniversal candle, which, till within a few years, was the night candle\r\nof every sick chamber, in which most of us can recollect it as a most\r\nghastly object as it used to stand, \"stationed in a basin on the floor,\r\nwhere it glimmered away like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly\r\nsmall piece of water\" (Pickwick), till expelled by the night-lights, and\r\nwhich is still made by Welsh labourers, and, I suppose, in Shakespeare's\r\ntime was the only candle used by the poor.\r\n\r\n     \"If your influence be quite damm'd up\r\n      With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,\r\n      Though a Rush-candle from the wicker hole\r\n      Of some clay habitation, visit us\r\n      With thy long levell'd rule of streaming light.\"--_Comus._\r\n\r\nBut the chief use of Rushes in those days was to strew the floors of\r\nhouses and churches (Nos. 4, 7, 10, 12, and 14). This custom seems to\r\nhave been universal in all houses of any pretence. \"William the son of\r\nWilliam of Alesbury holds three roods of land of the Lord the King in\r\nAlesbury in Com. Buck by the service of finding straw for the bed of the\r\nLord the King, and to strew his chamber, and also of finding for the\r\nKing when he comes to Alesbury straw for his bed, and besides this Grass\r\nor Rushes to make his chamber pleasant.\"--BLUNT'S _Tenures_. The custom\r\nwent on even to our own day in Norwich Cathedral, and the \"picturesque\r\ncustom still lingers in the West of strewing the floors of the churches\r\non Whit Sunday with Rushes freshly pulled from the meadows. This custom\r\nattains its highest perfection in the church of St. Mary Redcliffe at\r\nBristol. On 'Rush Sunday' the floor is strewn with Rushes. All the\r\nmerchants throw open their conservatories for the vicar to take his\r\nchoice of their flowers, and the pulpit, the lectern, the choir, and the\r\ncommunion rails and table present a scene of great beauty.\"--_The\r\nGarden_, May, 1877.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the Sweet-scented Rush was always used where it could\r\nbe procured, and when first laid down it must have made a pleasant\r\ncarpet; but it was a sadly dirty arrangement, and gives us a very poor\r\nidea of the cleanliness of even the best houses, though it probably was\r\nnot the custom all through the year, as Newton says, speaking of Sedges,\r\nbut evidently confusing the Sedge with the Sweet-scented Rush, \"with the\r\nwhich many in this countrie do use in sommer time to straw their\r\nparlours and churches, as well for cooleness as for pleasant\r\nsmell.\"[266:1] This Rush (_Acorus calamus_) is a British plant, with\r\nbroad leaves, which have a strong cinnamon-like smell, which obtained\r\nfor the plant the old Saxon name of Beewort. Another (so-called) Rush,\r\nthe Flowering Rush (_Butomus umbellatus_), is one of the very handsomest\r\nof the British plants, bearing on a long straight stem a large umbel of\r\nvery handsome pink flowers. Wherever there is a pond in a garden, these\r\nfine Rushes should have a place, though they may be grown in the open\r\nborder where the ground is not too dry.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told by Sir John Mandeville in connection with Rushes\r\nwhich is not easy to understand. According to his account, our Saviour's\r\ncrown of thorns was made of Rushes! \"And zif alle it be so that men seyn\r\nthat this Croune is of Thornes, zee shall undirstande that it was of\r\nJonkes of the See, that is to sey, Russhes of the See, that prykken als\r\nscharpely as Thornes. For I have seen and beholden many times that of\r\nParys and that of Constantynoble, for thei were bothe on, made of\r\nRussches of the See. But men have departed hem in two parties, of the\r\nwhich on part is at Parys, and the other part is at Constantynoble--and\r\nI have on of the precyouse Thornes, that semethe licke a white Thorn,\r\nand that was zoven to me for great specyaltee. . . . The Jewes setten\r\nhim in a chayere and clad him in a mantelle, and then made thei the\r\nCroune of Jonkes of the See.\"--_Voiage and Travaile,_ c. 2.\r\n\r\nI have no certainty to what Rush the pleasant old traveller can here\r\nrefer. I can only guess that as Rushes and Sedges were almost\r\ninterchangeable names, he may have meant the Sea Holly, formerly called\r\nthe Holly-sedge, of which there is a very appropriate account given in\r\nan old Saxon runelay thus translated by Cockayne: \"Hollysedge hath its\r\ndwelling oftenest in a marsh, it waxeth in water, woundeth fearfully,\r\nburneth with blood (_i.e._, draws blood and pains) every one of men who\r\nto it offers any handling.\"[267:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[264:1]\r\n\r\n     \"Around the islet at its lowest edge,\r\n          Lo, there beneath, where breaks th' encircling wave,\r\n          The yielding mud is thick with Rushes crowned.\r\n      No other flower with frond or leafy growth\r\n          Or hardened fibre there can life sustain,\r\n          For none bend safely to the watery shock.\"\r\n\r\n                        DANTE, _Purgatorio_, canto i.

It is mentioned several times in the Anglo-Saxon Leech Books:\r\n\"When he bathes, let him smear himself with oil; mingle it with\r\nSaffron.\"--_Tenth Century Leech Book_, ii. 37. \"For dimness of eyes,\r\nthus one must heal it: take Celandine one spoonful, and Aloes, and\r\nCrocus (Saffron in French).\"--_Schools of Medicine_, tenth century, c.\r\n22. In these instances it may be only the imported drug; but the name\r\noccurs in an English Vocabulary among the Nomina herbarum: \"Hic Crocus,\r\nA{e} Safurroun;\" and in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, \"Hic Crocus, An{ce} Safryn;\" so that I think the plant must\r\nhave been in cultivation in England at that time. The usual statement,\r\nmade by one writer after another, is that it was introduced by Sir\r\nThomas Smith into the neighbourhood of Walden in the time of Edward\r\nIII., but the original authority for this statement is unknown. The most\r\nauthentic account is that by Hakluyt in 1582, and though it is rather\r\nlong, it is worth extracting in full. It occurs in some instructions in\r\n\"Remembrances for Master S.,\" who was going into Turkey, giving him\r\nhints what to observe in his travels: \"Saffron, the best of the\r\nuniversall world, groweth in this realme. . . . It is a spice that is\r\ncordiall, and may be used in meats, and that is excellent in dying of\r\nyellow silks. This commodity of Saffron groweth fifty miles from\r\nTripoli, in Syria, on an high hyll, called in those parts Gasian, so as\r\nthere you may learn at that part of Tripoli the value of the pound, the\r\ngoodnesse of it, and the places of the vent. But it is said that from\r\nthat hyll there passeth yerely of that commodity fifteen moiles laden,\r\nand that those regions notwithstanding lacke sufficiency of that\r\ncommodity. But if a vent might be found, men would in Essex (about\r\nSaffron Walden), and in Cambridgeshire, revive the trade for the benefit\r\nof the setting of the poore on worke. So would they do in Herefordshire\r\nby Wales, where the best of all England is, in which place the soil\r\nyields the wilde Saffron commonly, which showeth the natural inclination\r\nof the same soile to the bearing of the right Saffron, if the soile be\r\nmanured and that way employed. . . It is reported at Saffron Walden that\r\na pilgrim, proposing to do good to his countrey, stole a head of\r\nSaffron, and hid the same in his Palmer's staffe, which he had made\r\nhollow before of purpose, and so he brought the root into this realme\r\nwith venture of his life, for if he had bene taken, by the law of the\r\ncountrey from whence it came, he had died for the fact.\"--_English\r\nVoiages, &c._, vol. ii. From this account it seems clear that even in\r\nHakluyt's time Saffron had been so long introduced that the history of\r\nits introduction was lost; and I think it very probable that, as was\r\nsuggested by Coles in his \"Adam in Eden\" (1657), we are indebted to the\r\nRomans for this, as for so many of our useful plants. But it is not a\r\nRoman or Italian plant. Spenser wrote of it as--\r\n\r\n     \"Saffron sought for in Cilician soyle--\"[270:1]\r\n\r\nand Browne--\r\n\r\n     \"Saffron confected in Cilicia\"--_Brit. Past._, i, 2;\r\n\r\nwhich information they derived from Pliny. It is supposed to be a native\r\nof Asia Minor, but so altered by long cultivation that it never produces\r\nseed either in England or in other parts of Europe.[270:2] This fact led\r\nM. Chappellier, of Paris, who has for many years studied the history of\r\nthe plant, to the belief that it was a hybrid; but finding that when\r\nfertilized with the pollen of a Crocus found wild in Greece, and known\r\nas C. sativus var. Græcus (_Orphanidis_), it produces seed abundantly,\r\nhe concludes that it is a variety of that species, which it very much\r\nresembles, but altered and rendered sterile by cultivation. It is not\r\nnow much cultivated in England, but we have abundant authority from\r\nTusser, Gerard, Parkinson, Camden, and many other writers, that it was\r\nlargely cultivated before and after Shakespeare's time, and that the\r\nquality of the English Saffron was very superior.[271:1] The importance\r\nof the crop is shown by its giving its name to Saffron Walden in\r\nEssex,[271:2] and to Saffron Hill in London, which \"was formerly a part\r\nof Ely Gardens\" (of which we shall hear again when we come to speak of\r\nStrawberries), \"and derives its name from the crops of Saffron which it\r\nbore.\"--CUNNINGHAM. The plant has in the same way given its name to\r\nZaffarano, a village in Sicily, near Mount Etna, and to Zafaranboly,\r\n\"ville située près Inobole en Anatolie, au sud-est de l'ancienne\r\nHéraclée.\"--CHAPPELLIER. The plant is largely cultivated in many parts\r\nof Europe, but the chief centres of cultivation are in the\r\narrondissement of Pithiviers in France, and the province of Arragon in\r\nSpain; and the chief consumers are the Germans. It has also been largely\r\ncultivated in China for a great many years, and the bulbs now imported\r\nfrom China are found to be, in many points, superior to the\r\nEuropean--\"l'invasion Tartare aurait porté le Safran en Chine, et de\r\nleur côté les croisés l'auraient importé en Europe.\"--CHAPPELLIER.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that the parts of the plant that produce the Saffron\r\nare the sweet-scented stigmata, the \"Crocei odores\" of Virgil; but the\r\nuse of Saffron has now so gone out of fashion, that it may be well to\r\nsay something of its uses in the time of Shakespeare, as a medicine, a\r\ndye, and a confection. On all three points its virtues were so many that\r\nthere is a complete literature on Crocus. I need not name all the books\r\non the subject, but the title page of one (a duodecimo of nearly three\r\nhundred pages) may be quoted as an example: \"Crocologia seu curiosa\r\nCroci Regis Vegetabilium enucleatio continens Illius etymologiam,\r\ndifferencias, tempus quo viret et floret, culturam, collectionem, usum\r\nmechanicum, Pharmaceuticum, Chemico medicum, omnibus pene humani\r\ncorporis partibus destinatum additis diversis observationibus et\r\nquestionibus Crocum concernentibus ad normam et formam S. R. I. Academiæ\r\nNaturæ curiosorum congesta a Dan: Ferdinando Hertodt, Phys. et Med.\r\nDoc., &c., &c. Jenæ. 1671.\" After this we may content ourselves with\r\nGerard's summary of its virtues: \"The moderate use of it is good for the\r\nhead, and maketh sences more quicke and lively, shaketh off heavy and\r\ndrowsie sleep and maketh a man mery.\" For its use in confections this\r\nwill suffice from the \"Apparatus Plantarum\" of Laurembergius, 1632: \"In\r\nre familiari vix ullus est telluris habitatus angulus ubi non sit Croci\r\nquotodiana usurpatio, aspersi vel incocti cibis.\" And as to its uses as\r\na dye, its penetrating powers were proverbial, of which Luther's Sermons\r\nwill supply an instance: \"As the Saffron bag that hath bene ful of\r\nSaffron, or hath had Saffron in it, doth ever after savour and smel of\r\nthe swete Saffron that it contayneth; so our blessed Ladye which\r\nconceived and bare Christe in her wombe, dyd ever after resemble the\r\nmaners and vertues of that precious babe which she bare\" (\"Fourth\r\nSermon,\" 1548). One of the uses to which Saffron was applied in the\r\nMiddle Ages was for the manufacture of the beautiful gold colour used in\r\nthe illumination of missals, &c., where the actual gold was not used.\r\nThis is the recipe from the work of Theophilus in the eleventh century:\r\n\"If ye wish to decorate your work in some manner take tin pure and\r\nfinely scraped; melt it and wash it like gold, and apply it with the\r\nsame glue upon letters or other places which you wish to ornament with\r\ngold or silver; and when you have polished it with a tooth, take Saffron\r\nwith which silk is colored, moistening it with clear of egg without\r\nwater, and when it has stood a night, on the following day cover with a\r\npencil the places which you wish to gild, the rest holding the place of\r\nsilver\" (Book i, c. 23, Hendrie's translation).\r\n\r\nThough the chief fame of the Saffron Crocus is as a field plant, yet it\r\nis also a very handsome flower; but it is a most capricious one, which\r\nmay account for the area of cultivation being so limited. In some places\r\nit entirely refuses to flower, as it does in my own garden, where I have\r\ncultivated it for many years but never saw a flower, while in a\r\nneighbour's garden, under apparently the very same conditions of soil\r\nand climate, it flowers every autumn. But if we cannot succeed with the\r\nSaffron Crocus, there are many other Croci which were known in the time\r\nof Shakespeare, and grown not \"for any other use than in regard of\r\ntheir beautiful flowers of several varieties, as they have been\r\ncarefully sought out and preserved by divers to furnish a garden of\r\ndainty curiosity.\" Gerard had in his garden only six species; Parkinson\r\nhad or described thirty-one different sorts, and after his time new\r\nkinds were not so much sought after till Dean Herbert collected and\r\nstudied them. His monograph of the Crocus, in 1847, contained the\r\naccount of forty-one species, besides many varieties. The latest\r\narrangement of the family by Mr. George Maw, of Broseley, contains\r\nsixty-eight species, besides varieties; of these all are not yet in\r\ncultivation, but every year sees some fresh addition to the number,\r\nchiefly by the unwearied exertions in finding them in their native\r\nhabitats, and the liberal distribution of them when found, of Mr. Maw,\r\nto whom all the lovers of the Crocus are deeply indebted. And the Croci\r\nare so beautiful that we cannot have too many of them; they are, for the\r\nmost part, perfectly hardy, though some few require a little protection\r\nin winter; they are of an infinite variety of colour, and some flower in\r\nthe spring and some in the autumn. Most of us call the Crocus a spring\r\nflower, yet there are more autumnal than vernal species, but it is as a\r\nspring flower that we most value it. The common yellow Crocus is almost\r\nas much \"the first-born of the year's delight\" as the Snowdrop. No one\r\ncan tell its native country, but it has been the brightest ornament of\r\nour gardens, not only in spring, but even in winter, for many years. It\r\nwas probably first introduced during Shakespeare's life. \"It hath\r\nfloures,\" says Gerard, \"of a most perfect shining yellow colour, seeming\r\nafar off to be a hot glowing coal of fire. That pleasant plant was sent\r\nunto me from Robinus, of Paris, that painful and most curious searcher\r\nof simples.\" From that beginning perhaps it has found its way into every\r\ngarden, for it increases rapidly, is very hardy, and its brightness\r\ncommends it to all. It is the \"most gladsome of the early flowers. None\r\ngives more glowing welcome to the season, or strikes on our first\r\nglance with a ray of keener pleasure, when, with some bright morning's\r\nwarmth, the solitary golden fringes have kindled into knots of\r\nthick-clustered yellow bloom on the borders of the cottage garden. At a\r\ndistance the eye is caught by that glowing patch, its warm heart open to\r\nthe sun, and dear to the honey-gathering bees which hum around the\r\nchalices.\"--FORBES WATSON.\r\n\r\nWith this pretty picture I may well close the account of the Crocus, but\r\nnot because the subject is exhausted, for it is very tempting to go much\r\nfurther, and to speak of the beauties of the many species, and of the\r\nendless forms and colours of the grand Dutch varieties; and whatever\r\nadmiration may be expressed for the common yellow Dutch Crocus, the same\r\nI would also give to almost every member of this lovely and cheerful\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[268:1] Fuller says of the crocodile--\"He hath his name of χροχό-δειλος,\r\nor the Saffron-fearer, knowing himself to be all poison, and it all\r\nantidote.\"--_Worthies of England_, i, 336, ed. 1811.\r\n\r\n[270:1] \"Cilician,\" or \"Corycean,\" were the established classical\r\nepithets to use when speaking of the Saffron.

The plant grows round all the coasts\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland, wherever there are suitable rocks on which\r\nit can grow, and on all the coasts of Europe, except the northern\r\ncoasts; and it is a plant very easily recognized, if not by its\r\npale-green, fleshy leaves, yet certainly by its taste, or its \"smell\r\ndelightful and pleasant.\" The leaves form the pickle, \"the pleasantest\r\nsauce, most familiar, and best agreeing with man's body,\" but now much\r\nout of fashion. In Shakespeare's time the gathering of Samphire was a\r\nregular trade, and Steevens quotes from Smith's \"History of Waterford\"\r\nto show the danger attending the trade: \"It is terrible to see how\r\npeople gather it, hanging by a rope several fathoms from the top of the\r\nimpending rocks, as it were in the air.\" In our own time the quantity\r\nrequired could be easily got without much danger, for it grows in places\r\nperfectly accessible in sufficient quantity for the present\r\nrequirements, for in some parts it grows away from the cliffs, so that\r\n\"the fields about Porth Gwylan, in Carnarvonshire, are covered with\r\nit.\" It may even be grown in the garden, especially in gardens near the\r\nsea, and makes a pretty plant for rockwork.\r\n\r\nThere is a story connected with the Samphire which shows how botanical\r\nknowledge, like all other knowledge, may be of great service, even where\r\nleast expected. Many years ago a ship was wrecked on the Sussex coast,\r\nand a small party were left on a rock not far from land. To their horror\r\nthey found the sea rising higher and higher, and threatening before long\r\nto cover their place of refuge. Some of them proposed to try and swim\r\nfor land, and would have done so, but just as they were preparing for it\r\nan officer saw a plant of Samphire growing on the rock, and told them\r\nthey might stay and trust to that little plant that the sea would rise\r\nno further, for that the Samphire, though always growing within the\r\nspray of the sea, never grows where the sea could actually touch it.\r\nThey believed him and were saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274:1] Dr. Prior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._\r\n\r\n                   Here's flowers for you;\r\n     Hot Lavender, Mints, Savory, Marjoram.\r\n\r\n                           _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4. (103).\r\n\r\nSavory might be supposed to get its name as being a plant of special\r\nsavour, but the name comes from its Latin name _Saturcia_, through the\r\nItalian _Savoreggia_. It is a native of the South of Europe, probably\r\nintroduced into England by the Romans, for it is mentioned in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon recipes under the imported name of Savorie. It was a very\r\nfavourite plant in the old herb gardens, and both kinds, the Winter and\r\nSummer Savory, were reckoned \"among the farsing or farseting herbes, as\r\nthey call them\" (Parkinson), _i.e._, herbs used for stuffing.[275:1]\r\nBoth kinds are still grown in herb gardens, but are very little used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[275:1]\r\n\r\n     \"His typet was ay farsud ful of knyfes\r\n      And pynnes, for to give fair wyves.\"\r\n\r\n                                     _Canterbury Tale_, Prologue.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The farced title running before the King.\"\r\n\r\n                                  _Henry V_, act iv, sc. 1 (431).\r\n\r\nThe word still exists as \"forced;\" _e.g._, \"a forced leg of mutton,\"\r\n\"forced meat balls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _2nd Servant._\r\n\r\n     And Cytherea all in Sedges hid,\r\n     Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,\r\n     Even as the waving Sedges play with wind.\r\n\r\n                   _Taming of the Shrew_, Induction, sc. 2.

Thus we read of the Moor Secg, and the Red Secg, and the Sea\r\nHolly (_Eryngium maritimum_) is called the Holly Sedge. And so it was\r\ndoubtless used by Shakespeare. In our day Sedge is confined to the genus\r\nCarex, a family growing in almost all parts of the world, and containing\r\nabout 1000 species, of which we have fifty-eight in Great Britain; they\r\nare most graceful ornaments both of our brooks and ditches; and some of\r\nthem will make handsome garden plants. One very handsome\r\nspecies--perhaps the handsomest--is C. pendula, with long tassel-like\r\nflower-spikes hanging down in a very beautiful form, which is not\r\nuncommon as a wild plant, and can easily be grown in the garden, and\r\nthe flower-spikes will be found very handsome additions to tall\r\nnosegays. There is another North American species, C. Fraseri, which is\r\na good plant for the north side of a rock-work: it is a small plant, but\r\nthe flower is a spike of the purest white, and is very curious, and\r\nunlike any other flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Macbeth._\r\n\r\n     What Rhubarb, Senna, or what purgative drug\r\n     Would scour these English hence?[277:1]\r\n\r\n                                    _Macbeth_, act v, sc. 3 (55).\r\n\r\nEven in the time of Shakespeare several attempts were made to grow the\r\nSenna in England, but without success; so that he probably only knew it\r\nas an important \"purgative drug.\" The Senna of commerce is made from the\r\nleaves of Cassia lanceolata and Cassia Senna, both natives of Africa,\r\nand so unfitted for open-air cultivation in England. The Cassias are a\r\nlarge family, mostly with handsome yellow flowers, some of which are\r\nvery ornamental greenhouse plants; and one from North America, Cassia\r\nMarylandica, may be considered hardy in the South of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[277:1] In this passage the old reading for \"Senna\" is \"Cyme,\" and this\r\nis the reading of the Globe Shakespeare; but I quote the passage with\r\n\"Senna\" because it is so printed in many editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEARGRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Peto._\r\n\r\n     He persuaded us to do the like.\r\n\r\n     _Bardolph._\r\n\r\n     Yea, and to tickle our noses with Speargrass to make them\r\n       bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear\r\n       it was the blood of true men.\r\n\r\n                             _1st Henry IV_, act ii, sc. 4 (339).\r\n\r\nExcept in this passage I can only find Speargrass mentioned in Lupton's\r\n\"Notable Things,\" and there without any description, only as part of a\r\nmedical recipe: \"Whosoever is tormented with sciatica or the hip gout,\r\nlet them take an herb called Speargrass, and stamp it and lay a little\r\nthereof upon the grief.\" The plant is not mentioned by Lyte, Gerard,\r\nParkinson, or the other old herbalists, and so it is somewhat of a\r\npuzzle. Steevens quotes from an old play, \"Victories of Henry the\r\nFifth\": \"Every day I went into the field, I would take a straw and\r\nthrust it into my nose, and make my nose bleed;\" but a straw was never\r\ncalled Speargrass. Asparagus was called Speerage, and the young shoots\r\nmight have been used for the purpose, but I have never heard of such a\r\nuse; Ranunculus flammula was called Spearwort, from its lanceolate\r\nleaves, and so (according to Cockayne) was Carex acuta, still called\r\nSpiesgrass in German. Mr. Beisly suggests the Yarrow or Millfoil; and we\r\nknow from several authorities (Lyte, Hollybush, Gerard, Phillip, Cole,\r\nSkinner, and Lindley) that the Yarrow was called Nosebleed; but there\r\nseems no reason to suppose that it was ever called Speargrass, or could\r\nhave been called a Grass at all, though the term Grass was often used in\r\nthe most general way. Dr. Prior suggests the Common Reed, which is\r\nprobable. I have been rather inclined to suppose it to be one of the\r\nHorse-tails (Equiseta).[278:1] They are very sharp and spearlike, and\r\ntheir rough surfaces would soon draw blood; and as a decoction of\r\nHorse-tail was a remedy for stopping bleeding of the nose, I have\r\nthought it very probable that such a supposed virtue could only have\r\narisen when remedies were sought for on the principle of \"similia\r\nsimilibus curantur;\" so that a plant, which in one form produced\r\nnose-bleeding, would, when otherwise administered, be the natural\r\nremedy. But I now think that all these suggested plants must give way in\r\nfavour of the common Couch-grass (_Triticum repens_). In the eastern\r\ncounties, this is still called Speargrass; and the sharp underground\r\nstolons might easily draw blood, when the nose is tickled with them. The\r\nold emigrants from the eastern counties took the name with them to\r\nAmerica, but applied it to a Poa (Webster's \"Dictionary,\" s.v.\r\nSpeargrass).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[278:1] \"Hippurus Anglice dicitur sharynge gyrs.\"--TURNER'S _Libellus_,\r\n1538.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUASH, _see_ PEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\r\n     And flat meads thatch'd with Stover, them to keep.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (62).\r\n\r\nIn this passage, Stover is probably the bent or dried Grass still\r\nremaining on the land, but it is the common word for hay or straw, or\r\nfor \"fodder and provision for all sorts of cattle; from _Estovers_, law\r\nterm, which is so explained in the law dictionaries.

It was\r\ncelebrated for its Roses (_see_ ROSE); it was so celebrated for its\r\nSaffron Crocuses that part of it acquired the name which it still keeps,\r\nSaffron Hill; and now we hear of its \"good Strawberries;\" while the\r\nremembrance of \"the ample garden,\" and of the handsome Lord Chancellor\r\nto whom it was given when taken from the bishopric, is still kept alive\r\nin its name of Hatton Garden. How very good our forefathers'\r\nStrawberries were, we have a strong proof in old Isaak Walton's happy\r\nwords: \"Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of angling as Dr. Boteler\r\nsaid of Strawberries: 'Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but\r\ndoubtless God never did;' and so, if I might be judge, God never did\r\nmake a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling.\" I doubt\r\nwhether, with our present experience of good Strawberries, we should\r\njoin in this high praise of the Strawberries of Shakespeare's or Isaak\r\nWalton's day, for their varieties of Strawberry must have been very\r\nlimited in comparison to ours. Their chief Strawberry was the Wild\r\nStrawberry brought straight from the woods, and no doubt much improved\r\nin time by cultivation. Yet we learn from Spenser and from Tusser that\r\nit was the custom to grow it just as it came from the woods.\r\n\r\nSpenser says--\r\n\r\n     \"One day as they all three together went\r\n      Into the wood to gather Strawberries.\"--_F. Q._, vi. 34;\r\n\r\nand Tusser--\r\n\r\n     \"Wife, into thy garden, and set me a plot\r\n      With Strawbery rootes of the best to be got:\r\n      Such growing abroade, among Thornes in the wood,\r\n      Wel chosen and picked, prove excellent good.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      The Gooseberry, Respis, and Roses al three\r\n      With Strawberies under them trimly agree.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _September's Husbandry._\r\n\r\nAnd even in the next century, Sir Hugh Plat said--\r\n\r\n     \"Strawberries which grow in woods prosper best in gardens.\"\r\n\r\n                                  _Garden of Eden_, i, 20.[281:1]\r\n\r\nBesides the wild one (_Fragaria vesca_), they had the Virginian (_F.\r\nVirginiana_), a native of North America, and the parent of our scarlets;\r\nbut they do not seem to have had the Hautbois (_F. elatior_), or the\r\nChilian, or the Carolinas, from which most of our good varieties have\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry is among fruits what the Primrose and Snowdrop are among\r\nflowers, the harbinger of other good fruits to follow. It is the\r\nearliest of the summer fruits, and there is no need to dwell on its\r\ndelicate, sweet-scented freshness, so acceptable to all; but it has also\r\na charm in autumn, known, however, but to few, and sometimes said to be\r\nonly discernible by few. Among \"the flowers that yield sweetest smell in\r\nthe air,\" Lord Bacon reckoned Violets, and \"next to that is the Musk\r\nRose, then the Strawberry leaves dying, with a most excellent cordial\r\nsmell.\" In Mrs. Gaskell's pretty tale, \"My Lady Ludlow,\" the dying\r\nStrawberry leaves act an important part. \"The great hereditary faculty\r\non which my lady piqued herself, and with reason, for I never met with\r\nany other person who possessed it, was the power she had of perceiving\r\nthe delicious odour arising from a bed of Strawberry leaves in the late\r\nautumn, when the leaves were all fading and dying.\" The old lady quotes\r\nLord Bacon, and then says: \"'Now the Hanburys can always smell the\r\nexcellent cordial odour, and very delicious and refreshing it is. In the\r\ntime of Queen Elizabeth the great old families of England were a\r\ndistinct race, just as a cart-horse is one creature and very useful in\r\nits place, and Childers or Eclipse is another creature, though both are\r\nof the same species. So the old families have gifts and powers of a\r\ndifferent and higher class to what the other orders have. My dear,\r\nremember that you try and smell the scent of dying Strawberry leaves in\r\nthis next autumn, you have some of Ursula Hanbury's blood in you, and\r\nthat gives you a chance.' 'But when October came I sniffed, and sniffed,\r\nand all to no purpose; and my lady, who had watched the little\r\nexperiment rather anxiously, had to give me up as a hybrid'\" (\"Household\r\nWords,\" vol. xviii.). On this I can only say in the words of an old\r\nwriter, \"A rare and notable thing, if it be true, for I never proved it,\r\nand never tried it; therefore, as it proves so, praise it.\"[282:1]\r\nSpenser also mentions the scent, but not of the leaves or fruit, but of\r\nthe flowers--\r\n\r\n     \"Comming to kisse her lyps (such grace I found),\r\n      Me seem'd I smelt a garden of sweet flowres\r\n      That dainty odours from them threw around:\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Her goodly bosome, lyke a Strawberry bed,\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Such fragrant flowres doe give most odorous smell.\"[282:2]\r\n\r\n                                                   _Sonnet_ lxiv.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable interest connected with the name of the plant,\r\nand much popular error. It is supposed to be called Strawberry because\r\nthe berries have straw laid under them, or from an old custom of selling\r\nthe wild ones strung on straws.[282:3] In Shakespeare's time straw was\r\nused for the protection of Strawberries, but not in the present\r\nfashion--\r\n\r\n     \"If frost doe continue, take this for a lawe,\r\n      The Strawberies look to be covered with strawe.\r\n      Laid ouerly trim upon crotchis and bows,\r\n      And after uncovered as weather allows.\"\r\n\r\n                                  TUSSER, _December's Husbandry_.\r\n\r\nBut the name is much more ancient than either of these customs.\r\nStrawberry in different forms, as Strea-berige, Streaberie-wisan,\r\nStreaw-berige, Streaw-berian wisan, Streberilef, Strabery,\r\nStrebere-wise, is its name in the old English Vocabularies, while it\r\nappears first in its present form in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the\r\nfifteenth century, \"Hoc ffragrum, A{ce} a Strawbery.\" What the word\r\nreally means is pleasantly told by a writer in Seeman's \"Journal of\r\nBotany,\" 1869: \"How well this name indicates the now prevailing practice\r\nof English gardeners laying straw under the berry in order to bring it\r\nto perfection, and prevent it from touching the earth, which without\r\nthat precaution it naturally does, and to which it owes its German\r\n_Erdbeere_, making us almost forget that in this instance 'straw' has\r\nnothing to do with the practice alluded to, but is an obsolete\r\npast-participle of 'to strew,' in allusion to the habit of the plant.\"\r\nThis obsolete word is preserved in our English Bibles, \"gathering where\r\nthou hast not strawed,\" \"he strawed it upon the water,\" \"straw me with\r\napples;\" and in Shakespeare--\r\n\r\n     The bottom poison, and the top o'erstrawed\r\n     With sweets.--_Venus and Adonis._\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view there is almost as great a mistake in the\r\nsecond half of the name, for in strict botanical language the fruit of\r\nthe Strawberry is not a berry; it is not even \"exactly a fruit, but is\r\nmerely a fleshy receptacle bearing fruit, the true fruit being the ripe\r\ncarpels, which are scattered over its surface in the form of minute\r\ngrains looking like seeds, for which they are usually mistaken, the\r\nseed lying inside of the shell of the carpel.\" It is exactly the\r\ncontrary to the Raspberry, a fruit not named by Shakespeare, though\r\ncommon in his time under the name of Rasps. \"When you gather the\r\nRaspberry you throw away the receptacle under the name of core, never\r\nsuspecting that it is the very part you had just before been feasting\r\nupon in the Strawberry. In the one case, the receptacle robs the carpels\r\nof all their juice in order to become gorged and bloated at their\r\nexpense; in the other case, the carpels act in the same selfish manner\r\nupon the receptacles.\"--LINDLEY, _Ladies' Botany_.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's mention of the Strawberry and the Nettle (No. 2) deserves\r\na passing note. It was the common opinion in his day that plants were\r\naffected by the neighbourhood of other plants to such an extent that\r\nthey imbibed each other's virtues and faults. Thus sweet flowers were\r\nplanted near fruit trees, with the idea of improving the flavour of the\r\nfruit, and evil-smelling trees, like the Elder, were carefully cleared\r\naway from fruit trees, lest they should be tainted. But the Strawberry\r\nwas supposed to be an exception to the rule, and was supposed to thrive\r\nin the midst of \"evil communications\" without being corrupted. Preachers\r\nand emblem-writers naturally seized upon this: \"In tilling our gardens\r\nwe cannot but admire the fresh innocence and purity of the Strawberry,\r\nbecause although it creeps along the ground, and is continually crushed\r\nby serpents, lizards, and other venomous reptiles, yet it does not\r\nimbibe the slightest impression of poison, or the smallest malignant\r\nquality, a true sign that it has no affinity with poison. And so it is\r\nwith human virtues,\" &c. \"In conversation take everything peacefully, no\r\nmatter what is said or done. In this manner you may remain innocent\r\namidst the hissing of serpents, and, as a little Strawberry, you will\r\nnot suffer contamination from slimy things creeping near you.\"--ST.\r\nFRANCIS DE SALES.\r\n\r\nI need only add that the Strawberry need not be confined to the kitchen\r\ngarden, as there are some varieties which make very good carpet plants,\r\nsuch as the variegated Strawberry, which, however, is very capricious in\r\nits variegation; the double Strawberry, which bears pretty white\r\nbutton-like flowers; and the Fragaria lucida from California, which has\r\nvery bright shining leaves, and was, when first introduced, supposed to\r\nbe useful in crossing with other species; but I have not heard that this\r\nhas been successfully effected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279:1] \"Mrs. Somerville made for me a delicate outline sketch of what\r\nis called Othello's house in Venice, and a beautifully coloured copy of\r\nhis shield surmounted by the Doge's cap, and bearing three Mulberries\r\nfor device--proving the truth of the assertion that the _Otelli del\r\nMoro_ were a noble Venetian folk, who came originally from the Morea,\r\nwhose device was the Mulberry, the growth of that country, and showing\r\nhow curious a jumble Shakespeare has made both of name and device in\r\ncalling him a _Moor_, and embroidering his arms on his handkerchief as\r\n_Strawberries_.\"--F. KEMBLE'S _Records_, vol. i. 145.\r\n\r\n[281:1] It seems probable that the Romans only knew of the Wild\r\nStrawberry, of which both Virgil and Ovid speak--\r\n\r\n     \"Qui legitis flores et humi nascentia fraga.\"--_Ecl._, ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Contentique cibis nullo cogente creatis\r\n      Arbuteos fœtus montanaque fraga legebant.\"--_Metam._, i, 105.\r\n\r\n[282:1] \"Quæ neque confirmare argumentis neque refellere in animo est;\r\nex ingenio suo quisque demat vel addat fidem.\"--TACITUS.\r\n\r\n[282:2] The flowers of Fragaria lucida are slightly violet-scented, but\r\nI know of no Strawberry flower that can be said to \"give most odorous\r\nsmell.\"\r\n\r\n[282:3]\r\n\r\n     \"The wood nymphs oftentimes would busied be,\r\n      And pluck for him the blushing Strawberry,\r\n      Making from them a bracelet on a bent,\r\n      Which for a favour to this swain they sent.\"\r\n\r\n                                    BROWNE'S _Brit.

Yet the history of the migrations of the\r\nSugar-plant is sufficiently interesting to call for a short notice.\r\n\r\nIts original home seems to have been in the East Indies, whence it was\r\nimported in very early times. It is probably the \"sweet cane\" of the\r\nBible; and among classical writers it is named by Strabo, Lucan, Varro,\r\nSeneca, Dioscorides, and Pliny. The plant is said to have been\r\nintroduced into Europe during the Crusades, and to have been cultivated\r\nin the Morea, Rhodes, Malta, Sicily, and Spain.[286:1] By the Spaniards\r\nit was taken first to Madeira and the Cape de Verd Islands, and, very\r\nsoon after the discovery of America, to the West Indies. There it soon\r\ngrew rapidly, and increased enormously, and became a chief article of\r\ncommerce, so that though we now almost look upon it as entirely a New\r\nWorld plant, it is in fact but a stranger there, that has found a most\r\ncongenial home.\r\n\r\nIn 1468 the price of Sugar was sixpence a pound, equal to six shillings\r\nof our money,[287:1] but in Shakespeare's time it must have been very\r\ncommon,[287:2] or it could not so largely have worked its way into the\r\ncommon English language and proverbial expressions; and it must also\r\nhave been very cheap, or it could not so entirely have superseded the\r\nuse of honey, which in earlier times was the only sweetening material.\r\n\r\nShakespeare may have seen the living plant, for it was grown as a\r\ncuriosity in his day, though Gerard could not succeed with it: \"Myself\r\ndid plant some shootes thereof in my garden, and some in Flanders did\r\nthe like, but the coldness of our clymate made an end of myne, and I\r\nthink the Flemmings will have the like profit of their labour.\" But he\r\nbears testimony to the large use of Sugar in his day; \"of the juice of\r\nthe reede is made the most pleasant and profitable sweet called Sugar,\r\nwhereof is made infinite confections, sirupes, and such like, as also\r\npreserving and conserving of sundrie fruits, herbes and flowers, as\r\nroses, violets, rosemary flowers and such like.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[286:1] \"It is the juice of certain canes or reedes whiche growe most\r\nplentifully in the Ilandes of Madera, Sicilia, Cyprus, Rhodus and Candy.\r\nIt is made by art in boyling of the Canes, much like as they make their\r\nwhite salt in the Witches in Cheshire.\"--COGHAN, _Haven of Health_,\r\n1596, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[287:1] \"Babee's Book,\" xxx.\r\n\r\n[287:2] It is mentioned by Chaucer--\r\n\r\n     \"Gyngerbred that was so fyn.\r\n      And licorys and eek comyn\r\n      With Sugre that is trye.\"--_Tale of Sir Thopas._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET MARJORAM, _see_ MARJORAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYCAMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Desdemona_ (singing).\r\n\r\n     The poor soul sat sighing by a Sycamore tree.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act iv, sc. 3 (41).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Benvolio._\r\n\r\n     Underneath the grove of Sycamore\r\n     That westward rooteth from the city's side,\r\n     So early walking did I see your son.\r\n\r\n                          _Romeo and Juliet_, act i, sc. 1 (130).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Boyet._\r\n\r\n     Under the cool shade of a Sycamore\r\n     I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour.\r\n\r\n                       _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (89).\r\n\r\nIn its botanical relationship, the Sycamore is closely allied to the\r\nMaple, and was often called the Great Maple, and is still so called in\r\nScotland. It is not indigenous in Great Britain, but it has long been\r\nnaturalized among us, and has taken so kindly to our soil and climate\r\nthat it is one of our commonest trees. It is one of the best of forest\r\ntrees for resisting wind; it \"scorns to be biassed in its mode of growth\r\neven by the prevailing wind, but shooting its branches with equal\r\nboldness in every direction, shows no weatherside to the storm, and may\r\nbe broken, but never can be bended.\"-_Old Mortality_, c. i.\r\n\r\nThe history of the name is curious. The Sycomore, or Zicamine tree of\r\nthe Bible and of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, is the Fig-mulberry, a\r\nlarge handsome tree indigenous in Africa and Syria, and largely planted,\r\npartly for the sake of its fruit, and especially for the delicious shade\r\nit gives. With this tree the early English writers were not acquainted,\r\nbut they found the name in the Bible, and applied it to any shade-giving\r\ntree. Thus in Ælfric's Vocabulary in the tenth century it is given to\r\nthe Aspen--\"Sicomorus vel celsa æps.\" Chaucer gives the name to some\r\nhedge shrub, but he probably used it for any thick shrub, without any\r\nvery special distinction--\r\n\r\n     \"The hedge also that yedde in compas\r\n      And closed in all the greene herbere\r\n      With Sicamour was set and Eglateere,\r\n      Wrethen in fere so well and cunningly\r\n      That every branch and leafe grew by measure\r\n      Plaine as a bord, of an height by and by.\"\r\n\r\n                                       _The Flower and the Leaf._\r\n\r\nOur Sycamore would be very ill suited to make the sides and roof of an\r\narbour, but before the time of Shakespeare it seems certain that the\r\nname was attached to our present tree, and it is so called by Gerard and\r\nParkinson.\r\n\r\nThe Sycamore is chiefly planted for its rapid growth rather than for\r\nits beauty. It becomes a handsome tree when fully grown, but as a young\r\ntree it is stiff and heavy, and at all times it is so infested with\r\nhoneydew as to make it unfit for planting on lawns or near paths. It\r\ngrows well in the north, where other trees will not well flourish, and\r\n\"we frequently meet with the tree apart in the fields, or unawares in\r\nremote localities amidst the Lammermuirs and the Cheviots, where it is\r\nthe surviving witness of the former existence of a hamlet there. Hence\r\nto the botanical rambler it has a more melancholy character than the\r\nYew. It throws him back on past days, when he who planted the tree was\r\nthe owner of the land and of the Hall, and whose name and race are\r\nforgotten even by tradition. . . . And there is reasonable pride in the\r\nancestry when a grove of old gentlemanly Sycamores still shadows the\r\nHall.\"--JOHNSTON. But these old Sycamores were not planted only for\r\nbeauty: they were sometimes planted for a very unpleasant use. \"They\r\nwere used by the most powerful barons in the West of Scotland for\r\nhanging their enemies and refractory vassals on, and for this reason\r\nwere called _dool_ or grief trees. Of these there are three yet\r\nstanding, the most memorable being one near the fine old castle of\r\nCassilis, one of the seats of the Marquis of Ailsa, on the banks of the\r\nRiver Doon. It was used by the family of Kennedy, who were the most\r\npowerful barons of the West of Scotland, for the purpose above\r\nmentioned.\"--JOHNS.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the Sycamore is useful for turning and a few other purposes,\r\nbut is not very durable. The sap, as in all the Maples, is full of\r\nsugar, and the pollen is very curious; \"it appears globular in the\r\nmicroscope, but if it be touched with anything moist, the globules burst\r\nopen with four valves, and then they appear in the form of a\r\ncross.\"--MILLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHISTLE (_see also_ HOLY THISTLE).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Burgundy._\r\n\r\n                         And nothing teems\r\n     But hateful Docks, rough Thistles, Kecksies, Burs.\r\n\r\n                                    _Henry V_, act v, sc. 2 (51).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Bottom._\r\n\r\n     Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your weapons ready\r\n       in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped humble bee on the top\r\n       of a Thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iv, sc. 1 (10).\r\n\r\nThistle is the old English name for a large family of plants occurring\r\nchiefly in Europe and Asia, of which we have fourteen species in Great\r\nBritain, arranged under the botanical families of Carlina, Carduus, and\r\nOnopordon. It is the recognized symbol of untidiness and carelessness,\r\nbeing found not so much in barren ground as in good ground not properly\r\ncared for. So good a proof of a rich soil does the Thistle give, that a\r\nsaying is attributed to a blind man who was choosing a piece of\r\nland--\"Take me to a Thistle;\" and Tusser says--\r\n\r\n     \"Much wetnes, hog-rooting, and land out of hart makes Thistles\r\n     a number foorthwith to upstart. If Thistles so growing proove\r\n     lustie and long, It signifieth land to be hartie and strong.\"\r\n\r\n                                      _October's Husbandry_ (13).\r\n\r\nIf the Thistles were not so common, and if we could get rid of the\r\nassociations they suggest, there are probably few of our wild plants\r\nthat we should more admire: they are stately in their foliage and habit,\r\nand some of their flowers are rich in colour, and the Thistledown, which\r\ncarries the seed far and wide, is very beautiful, and was once\r\nconsidered useful as a sign of rain, for \"if the down flyeth off\r\nColtsfoot, Dandelyon, or Thistles when there is no winde, it is a signe\r\nof rain.\"--COLES.\r\n\r\nIt had still another use in rustic divination--\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the various earth's embroidered gown,\r\n      There is a weed upon whose head grows down,\r\n      Sow Thistle 'tis y'clept, whose downy wreath\r\n      If anyone can blow off at a breath\r\n      We deem her for a maid.\"--BROWNE'S _Brit. Past._, i, 4.\r\n\r\nBut it is owing to these pretty Thistledowns that the plant becomes a\r\nmost undesirable neighbour, for they carry the seed everywhere, and\r\nwherever it is carried, it soon vegetates, and a fine crop of Thistles\r\nvery quickly follows. In this way, if left to themselves, the Thistles\r\nwill soon monopolize a large extent of country, to the extinction of\r\nother plants, as they have done in parts of the American prairies, and\r\nas they did in Australia, till a most stringent Act of Parliament was\r\npassed about twenty years ago, imposing heavy penalties upon all who\r\nneglected to destroy the Thistles on their land. For these reasons we\r\ncannot admit the Thistle into the garden, at least not our native\r\nThistles; but there are some foreigners which may well be admitted.\r\nThere are the handsome yellow Thistles of the South of Europe\r\n(_Scolymus_), which besides their beauty have a classical interest.\r\n\"Hesiod elegantly describing the time of year, says,\r\n\r\n     ἠμος δε σκολυμος τ'ανθει,\r\n\r\nwhen the Scolymus flowers, _i.e._, in hot weather or summer (\"Op. et\r\ndies,\" 582). This plant crowned with its golden flowers is abundant\r\nthroughout Sicily.\"--HOGG'S _Classical Plants of Sicily_. There is the\r\nFish-bone Thistle (_Chamæpeuce diacantha_) from Syria, a very handsome\r\nplant, and, like most of the Thistles, a biennial; but if allowed to\r\nflower and go to seed, it will produce plenty of seedlings for a\r\nsuccession of years. And there is a grand scarlet Thistle from Mexico,\r\nthe Erythrolena conspicua (\"Sweet,\" vol. ii. p. 134), which must be\r\nalmost the handsomest of the family, and which was grown in England\r\nfifty years ago, but has been long lost. There are many others that may\r\ndeserve a place as ornamental plants, but they find little favour, for\r\n\"they are only Thistles.\"\r\n\r\nAny notice of the Thistle would be imperfect without some mention of the\r\nScotch Thistle. It is the one point in the history of the plant that\r\nprotects it from contempt. We dare not despise a plant which is the\r\nhonoured badge of our neighbours and relations, the Scotch; which is\r\nennobled as the symbol of the Order of the Thistle, that claims to be\r\nthe most ancient of all our Orders of high honour; and which defies you\r\nto insult it or despise it by its proud mottoes, \"Nemo me impune\r\nlacessit,\" \"Ce que Dieu garde, est bien gardé.\" What is the true Scotch\r\nThistle even the Scotch antiquarians cannot decide, and in the\r\nuncertainty it is perhaps safest to say that no Thistle in particular\r\ncan claim the sole honour, but that it extends to every member of the\r\nfamily that can be found in Scotland.[292:1]\r\n\r\nShakespeare has noticed the love of the bee for the Thistle, and it\r\nseems that it is for other purposes than honey gathering that he finds\r\nthe Thistle useful. For \"a beauty has the Thistle, when every delicate\r\nhair arrests a dew-drop on a showery April morning, and when the purple\r\nblossom of a roadside Thistle turns its face to Heaven and welcomes the\r\nwild bee, who lies close upon its flowerets on the approach of some\r\nstorm cloud until its shadow be past away. For with unerring instinct\r\nthe bee well knows that the darkness is but for a moment, and that the\r\nsun will shine out again ere long.\"--LADY WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[292:1] See an interesting and fanciful account of the fitness of the\r\nThistle as the emblem of Scotland in Ruskin's \"Proserpina,\" pp. 135-139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ariel._\r\n\r\n     Tooth'd Briers, sharp Furzes, pricking Goss, and Thorns,\r\n     Which entered their frail skins.\r\n\r\n                                  _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (180).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Quince._\r\n\r\n     One must come in with a bush of Thorns and a lanthorn, and say\r\n       he comes in to disfigure, or to present, the person of\r\n       Moonshine.\r\n\r\n                  _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Puck._\r\n\r\n     For Briers and Thorns at their apparel snatch.\r\n\r\n                                    _Ibid._, act iii, sc. 2 (29).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Prologue._\r\n\r\n     This man with lanthorn, dog, and bush of Thorn,\r\n     Presenteth Moonshine.\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act v, sc. 1 (136).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Moonshine._\r\n\r\n     All that I have to say, is to tell you that the lanthorn is\r\n       the moon; I, the man in the moon; this Thorn-bush, my\r\n       Thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Ibid._ (261).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Dumain._\r\n\r\n     But, alack, my hand is sworn\r\n     Ne'er to pluck thee from thy Thorn.\r\n\r\n                     _Love's Labour's Lost_, act iv, sc. 3 (111).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Carlisle._\r\n\r\n     The woe's to come; the children yet unborn\r\n     Shall feel this day as sharp to them as Thorn.\r\n\r\n                               _Richard II_, act iv, sc. 1 (322).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _King Henry._\r\n\r\n                The care you have of us,\r\n     To mow down Thorns that would annoy our foot,\r\n     Is worthy praise.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 1 (66).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (9) _Gloucester._\r\n\r\n     And I--like one lost in a Thorny wood,\r\n     That rends the Thorns and is rent with the Thorns,\r\n     Seeking a way, and straying from the way.\r\n\r\n                            _3rd Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 2 (174).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (10) _K.

They might need\r\nno further comment beyond referring for further information about them\r\nto Hawthorn, Briar, Rose, and Bramble; but in speaking of the Bramble I\r\nmentioned the curious legend which tells why the Bramble employs itself\r\nin collecting wool from every stray sheep, and there is another very\r\ncurious instance in Blount's \"Antient Tenures\" of a connection between\r\nThorns and wool. The original document is given in Latin, and is dated\r\n39th Henry III. It may be thus translated: \"Peter de Baldwyn holds in\r\nCombes, in the county of Surrey, by the service to go a wool gathering\r\nfor our Lady the Queen among the White Thorns, and if he refuses to\r\ngather it he shall pay into the Treasury of our Lord the King xxs. per\r\nannum.\" I should almost suspect a false reading, as the editor is\r\ninclined to do, but that many other services, equally curious and\r\nimprobable, may easily be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYME.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Oberon._\r\n\r\n     I know a bank where the wild Thyme blows.\r\n\r\n                  _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act ii, sc. 1 (249).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Iago._\r\n\r\n     We will plant Nettles or sow Lettuce, set Hyssop and weed up Thyme.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act i, sc. 3 (324).\r\n                                                  (_See_ HYSSOP.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) And sweet Time true.\r\n\r\n                               _Two Noble Kinsmen_, Introd. song.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most curious of the curiosities of English plant names\r\nthat the Wild Thyme--a plant so common and so widely distributed, and\r\nthat makes itself so easily known by its fine aromatic, pungent scent,\r\nthat it is almost impossible to pass it by without notice--has yet no\r\nEnglish name, and seems never to have had one. Thyme is the Anglicised\r\nform of the Greek and Latin _Thymum_, which name it probably got from\r\nits use for incense in sacrifices, while its other name of _serpyllum_\r\npointed out its creeping habit. I do not know when the word Thyme was\r\nfirst introduced into the English language, for it is another curious\r\npoint connected with the name, that _thymum_ does not occur in the old\r\nEnglish vocabularies. We have in Ælfric's \"Vocabulary,\" \"Pollegia,\r\nhyl-wyrt,\" which may perhaps be the Thyme, though it is generally\r\nsupposed to be the Pennyroyal; we have in a Vocabulary of thirteenth\r\ncentury, \"Epitime, epithimum, fordboh,\" which also may be the Wild\r\nThyme; we have in a Vocabulary of the fifteenth century, \"Hoc sirpillum,\r\nA{ce} petergrys;\" and in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the same date, \"Hoc\r\ncirpillum, A{ce} a pellek\" (which word is probably a misprint, for in\r\nthe \"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" c. 1440, it is \"Peletyr, herbe, _serpillum\r\npiretrum_\"), both of which are almost certainly the Wild Thyme; while in\r\nan Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the tenth or eleventh century we have\r\n\"serpulum, crop-leac,\" _i.e._, the Onion, which must certainly be a\r\nmistake of the compiler. So that not even in its Latin form does the\r\nname occur, except in the \"Promptorium Parvulorum,\" where it is \"Tyme,\r\nherbe, _Tima_, _Timum_--Tyme, floure, _Timus_;\" and in the \"Catholicon\r\nAnglicum,\" when it is \"Tyme; _timum epitimum; flos ejus est_.\" It is\r\nthus a puzzle how it can have got naturalized among us, for in\r\nShakespeare's time it was completely naturalized.\r\n\r\nI have already quoted Lord Bacon's account of it under BURNET, but I\r\nmust quote it again here: \"Those flowers which perfume the air most\r\ndelightfully, not passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon and\r\ncrushed, are three--that is Burnet, Wild Thyme, and Water mints;\r\ntherefore you are to set whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure when\r\nyou walk or tread;\" and again in his pleasant description of the heath\r\nor wild garden, which he would have in every \"prince-like garden,\" and\r\n\"framed as much as may be to a natural wildness,\" he says, \"I like also\r\nlittle heaps, in the nature of mole-hills (such as are in wild heaths)\r\nto be set some with Wild Thyme, some with Pinks, some with Germander.\"\r\nYet the name may have been used sometimes as a general name for any\r\nwild, strong-scented plant. It can only be in this sense that Milton\r\nused it--\r\n\r\n     \"Thee, shepherd! thee the woods and desert caves,\r\n      With Wild Thyme and the gadding Vine o'ergrown,\r\n      And all their echoes mourn.\"\r\n\r\n                                                       _Lycidas._\r\n\r\nfor certainly a desert cave is almost the last place in which we should\r\nlook for the true Wild Thyme.\r\n\r\nIt is as a bee-plant especially that the Thyme has always been\r\ncelebrated. Spenser speaks of it as \"the bees alluring Tyme,\" and Ovid\r\nsays of it, speaking of Chloris or Flora--\r\n\r\n     \"Mella meum munus; volucres ego mella daturos\r\n      Ad violam et cytisos, et Thyma cana voco.\"\r\n\r\n                                                      _Fasti_, v.\r\n\r\nso that the Thyme became proverbial as the symbol of sweetness. It was\r\nthe highest compliment that the shepherd could pay to his mistress--\r\n\r\n     \"Nerine Galatea, Thymo mihi dulcior Hyblæ.\"\r\n\r\n                                              VIRGIL, _Ecl._ vii.\r\n\r\nAnd it was because of its wild Thyme that Mount Hymettus became so\r\ncelebrated for its honey--\"Mella Thymi redolentia flore\" (Ovid). \"Thyme,\r\nfor the time it lasteth, yeeldeth most and best honni, and therefore in\r\nold time was accounted chief (Thymus aptissimus ad mellificum--Pastus\r\ngratissimus apibus Thymum est--Plinii, 'His. Nat.')\r\n\r\n     'Dum thymo pascentur apes, dum rore cicadæ.'\r\n\r\n                                                 VIRGIL, _Georg._\r\n\r\nHymettus in Greece and Hybla in Sicily were so famous for Bees and\r\nHonni, because there grew such store of Tyme; propter hoc Siculum mel\r\nfert palmam, quod ibi Thymum bonum et frequens est.\"--VARRO, _The\r\nFeminine Monarchie_, 1634.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Thyme can scarcely be considered a garden plant, except in its\r\nvariegated and golden varieties, which are very handsome, but if it\r\nshould ever come naturally in the turf, it should be welcomed and\r\ncherished for its sweet scent. The garden Thyme (_T. vulgaris_) must of\r\ncourse be in every herb garden; and there are a few species which make\r\ngood plants for the rockwork, such as T. lanceolatus from Greece, a very\r\nlow-growing shrub, with narrow, pointed leaves; T. carnosus, which makes\r\na pretty little shrub, and others; while the Corsican Thyme (_Mentha\r\nRequieni_) is perhaps the lowest and closest-growing of all herbs,\r\nmaking a dark-green covering to the soil, and having a very strong\r\nscent, though more resembling Peppermint than Thyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOADSTOOLS, _see_ MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Anne._\r\n\r\n     Alas! I had rather be set quick i' the earth\r\n     And boul'd to death with Turnips.\r\n\r\n                   _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act iii, sc. 4 (89).\r\n\r\nThe Turnips of Shakespeare's time were like ours, and probably as good,\r\nthough their cultivation seems to have been chiefly confined to gardens.\r\nIt is not very certain whether the cultivated Turnip is the wild Turnip\r\nimproved in England by cultivation, or whether we are indebted for it to\r\nthe Romans, and that the wild one is only the degenerate form of the\r\ncultivated plant; for though the wild Turnip is admitted into the\r\nEnglish flora, yet its right to the admission is very doubtful. But if\r\nwe did not get the vegetable from the Romans we got its name. The old\r\nname for it was _nœp_, _nep_, or _neps_, which was only the English\r\nform of the Latin _napus_, while Turnip is the corruption of _terræ\r\nnapus_, but when the first syllable was added I do not know. There is a\r\ncurious perversion in the name, for our Turnip is botanically Brassica\r\nrapa, while the Rape is Brassica napus, so that the English and Latin\r\nhave changed places, the Napus becoming a Rape and the Rapa a Nep.\r\n\r\nThe present large field cultivation of Turnips is of comparatively a\r\nmodern date, though the field Turnip and garden Turnip are only\r\nvarieties of the same species, while there are also many varieties both\r\nof the field and garden Turnip. \"One field proclaims the Scotch variety,\r\nwhile the bluer cast tells its hardy Swedish origin; the tankard\r\nproclaims a deep soil, and the lover of boiled mutton, rejoicing, sees\r\nthe yellower tint of the Dutch or Stone Turnip, which he desires to meet\r\nwith again in the market.\"--PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to speak of the moral qualities of Turnips, or to\r\nmake them the symbols of much virtue, yet Gwillim did so: \"He beareth\r\nsable, a Turnip proper, a chief or gutte de Larmes. This is a wholesome\r\nroot, and yieldeth great relief to the poor, and prospereth best in a\r\nhot sandy ground, and may signifie a person of good disposition, whose\r\nvertuous demeanour flourisheth most prosperously, even in that soil,\r\nwhere the searching heat of envy most aboundeth. This differeth much in\r\nnature from that whereof it is said, 'And that there should not be among\r\nyou any root that bringeth forth gall and wormwood.'\"--GWILLIM'S\r\n_Heraldry_, sec. iii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas,\r\n     Of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Vetches, Oats, and Pease.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\nThe cultivated Vetch (_Vicia sativa_) is probably not a British plant,\r\nand it is not very certain to what country it rightly belongs; but it\r\nwas very probably introduced into England by the Romans as an excellent\r\nand easily-grown fodder-plant. There are several Vetches that are true\r\nBritish plants, and they are among the most beautiful ornaments of our\r\nlanes and hedges. Two especially deserve to take a place in the garden\r\nfor their beauty; but they require watching, or they will scramble into\r\nparts where their presence is not desirable; these are V. cracca and V.\r\nsylvatica. V. cracca has a very bright pure blue flower, and may be\r\nallowed to scramble over low bushes; V. sylvatica is a tall climber, and\r\nmay be seen in copses and high hedges climbing to the tops of the Hazels\r\nand other tall bushes. It is one of the most graceful of our British\r\nplants, and perhaps quite the most graceful of our climbers; it bears an\r\nabundance of flowers, which are pure white streaked and spotted with\r\npale blue; it is not a very common plant, but I have often seen it in\r\nGloucestershire and Somersetshire, and wherever it is found it is\r\ngenerally in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe other name for the Vetch is Tares, which is, no doubt, an old\r\nEnglish word that has never been satisfactorily explained. The word has\r\nan interest from its biblical associations, though modern scholars\r\ndecide that the Zizania is wrongly translated Tares, and that it is\r\nrather a bastard Wheat or Darnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVINES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Titania._\r\n\r\n     Feed him with Apricocks and Dewberries,\r\n     With purple Grapes, green Figs, and Mulberries.\r\n\r\n                 _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act iii, sc. 1 (169).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Menenius._\r\n\r\n     The tartness of his face sours ripe Grapes.\r\n\r\n                                 _Coriolanus_, act v, sc. 4 (18).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Song._\r\n\r\n     Come, thou monarch of the Vine,\r\n     Plumpy Bacchus, with pink eyne!\r\n     In thy fats our cares be drown'd,\r\n     With thy Grapes our hairs be crown'd.\r\n\r\n                     _Antony and Cleopatra_, act ii, sc. 7 (120).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Cleopatra._\r\n\r\n                          Now no more\r\n     The juice of Egypt's Grape shall moist this lip.\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act v, sc. 2 (284).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Timon._\r\n\r\n     Dry up thy Marrows, Vines, and plough-torn leas.\r\n\r\n                          _Timon of Athens_, act iv, sc. 3 (193).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Timon._\r\n\r\n     Go, suck the subtle blood o' the Grape,\r\n     Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Ibid._ (432).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Touchstone._\r\n\r\n     The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a Grape,\r\n       would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning\r\n       thereby that Grapes were made to eat and lips to open.\r\n\r\n                             _As You Like It_, act v, sc. 1 (36).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Iago._\r\n\r\n     Blessed Fig's end!

But none of these passages gives us much insight\r\ninto the culture of the Vine in England, the whole history of which is\r\ncurious and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe Vine is not even a native of Europe, but of the East, whence it was\r\nvery early introduced into Europe; so early, indeed, that it has\r\nrecently been found \"fossil in a tufaceous deposit in the South of\r\nFrance.\"--DARWIN. It was no doubt brought into England by the Romans.\r\nTacitus, describing England in the first century after Christ, says\r\nexpressly that the Vine did not, and, as he evidently thought, could not\r\ngrow there. \"Solum, præter oleam vitemque et cætera calidioribus terris\r\noriri sueta, patiens frugum, fæcundum.\" Yet Bede, writing in the eighth\r\ncentury, describes England as \"opima frugibus atque arboribus insula, et\r\nalendis apta pecoribus et jumentis Vineas etiam quibusdam in locis\r\ngerminans.\"[301:1]\r\n\r\nFrom that time till the time of Shakespeare there is abundant proof not\r\nonly of the growth of the Vine as we now grow it in gardens, but in\r\nlarge Vineyards. In Anglo-Saxon times \"a Vineyard\" is not unfrequently\r\nmentioned in various documents. \"Edgar gives the Vineyard situated at\r\nWecet, with the Vine-dressers.\"--TURNER'S _Anglo-Saxons_. \"'Domesday\r\nBook' contained thirty-eight entries of valuable Vineyards; one in Essex\r\nconsisted of six acres, and yielded twenty hogsheads of wine in a good\r\nyear. There was another of the same extent at Ware.\"--H. EVERSHED, in\r\n_Gardener's Chronicle_. So in the Norman times, \"Giraldus Cambrensis,\r\nspeaking of the Castle of Manorbeer (his birthplace), near Pembroke,\r\nsaid that it had under its walls, besides a fishpond, a beautiful\r\ngarden, enclosed on one side by a Vineyard and on the other by a wood,\r\nremarkable for the projection of its rocks and the height of its Hazel\r\ntrees. In the twelfth century Vineyards were not uncommon in\r\nEngland.\"--WRIGHT. Neckam, writing in that century, refers to the\r\nusefulness of the Vine when trained against the wall-front: \"Pampinus\r\nlatitudine suâ excipit æris insultus, cum res ita desiderat, et fenestra\r\nclementiam caloris solaris admittat.\"--HUDSON TURNER.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Shakespeare I suppose that most of the Vines in England\r\nwere grown in Vineyards of more or less extent, trained to poles. These\r\nformed the \"pole-clipt Vineyards\" of No. 21, and are thus described by\r\nGerard: \"The Vine is held up with poles and frames of wood, and by that\r\nmeans it spreadeth all about and climbeth aloft; it joyneth itselfe unto\r\ntrees, or whatsoever standeth next unto it\"--in other words, the Vine\r\nwas then chiefly grown as a standard in the open ground.\r\n\r\nThere are numberless notices in the records and chronicles of extensive\r\nvineyards in England, which it is needless to quote; but it is worth\r\nnoticing that the memory of these Vineyards remains not only in the\r\nchronicles and in the treatises which teach of Vine-culture, but also in\r\nthe names of streets, &c., which are occasionally met with. There is\r\n\"Vineyard Holm,\" in the Hampshire Downs, and many other places in\r\nHampshire; the \"Vineyard Hills,\" at Godalming; the \"Vines,\" at Rochester\r\nand Sevenoaks; the \"Vineyards,\" at Bath and Ludlow; the \"Vine Fields,\"\r\nnear the Abbey at Bury St. Edmunds;[302:1] the \"Vineyard Walk\" in\r\nClerkenwell; and \"near Basingstoke the 'Vine' or 'Vine House,' in a\r\nrichly wooded spot, where, as is said, the Romans grew the first Vine in\r\nBritain, the memory of which now only survives in the Vine\r\nHounds;\"[303:1] and probably a closer search among the names of fields\r\nin other parts would bring to light many similar instances.[303:2]\r\n\r\nAmong the English Vineyards those of Gloucestershire stood pre-eminent.\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, writing of Gloucestershire in the twelfth\r\ncentury, says: \"This county is planted thicker with Vineyards than any\r\nother in England, more plentiful in crops, and more pleasant in flavour.\r\nFor the wines do not offend the mouth with sharpness, since they do not\r\nyield to the French in sweetness\" (\"De Gestis Pontif.,\" book iv.) Of\r\nthese Vineyards the tradition still remains in the county. The Cotswold\r\nHills are in many places curiously marked with a succession of steps or\r\nnarrow terraces, called \"litchets\" or \"lynches;\" these are traditionally\r\nthe sites of the old Vineyards, but the tradition cannot be fully\r\ndepended on, and the formation of the terraces has been variously\r\naccounted for. By some they are supposed to be natural formations, but\r\nwherever I have seen them they appear to me too regular and artificial;\r\nnor, as far as I am aware, does the oolite, on which formation these\r\nterraces mostly occur, take the form of a succession of narrow terraces.\r\nIt seems certain that the ground was artificially formed into these\r\nterraces with very little labour, and that they were utilized for some\r\nspecial cultivation, and as likely for Vines as for any other.[303:3] It\r\nis also certain that as the Gloucestershire Vineyards were among the\r\nmost ancient and the best in England, so they held their ground till\r\nwithin a very recent period. I cannot find the exact date, but some time\r\nduring the last century there is \"satisfactory testimony of the full\r\nsuccess of a plantation in Cromhall Park, from which ten hogsheads of\r\nwine were made in the year. The Vine plantation was discontinued or\r\ndestroyed in consequence of a dispute with the Rector on a claim of the\r\ntythes.\"--RUDGE'S _History of Gloucestershire_. This, however, is not\r\nquite the latest notice I have met with, for Phillips, writing in 1820,\r\nsays: \"There are several flourishing Vineyards at this time in\r\nSomersetshire; the late Sir William Basset, in that county, annually\r\nmade some hogsheads of wine, which was palatable and well-bodied. The\r\nidea that we cannot make good wine from our own Grapes is erroneous; I\r\nhave tasted it quite equal to the Grave wines, and in some instances,\r\nwhen kept for eight or ten years, it has been drunk as hock by the\r\nnicest judges.\"--_Pomarium Britannicum._ It would have been more\r\nsatisfactory if Mr. Phillips had told us the exact locality of any of\r\nthese \"flourishing Vineyards,\" for I can nowhere else find any account\r\nof them, except that in a map of five miles round Bath in 1801 a\r\nVineyard is marked at Claverton, formerly in the possession of the\r\nBassets, and the Vines are distinctly shown.[304:1] At present the\r\nexperiment is again being tried by the Marquis of Bute, at Castle Coch,\r\nnear Cardiff, to establish a Vineyard, not to produce fruit for the\r\nmarket, but to produce wine; and as both soil and climate seem very\r\nsuitable, there can be little doubt that wine will be produced of a very\r\nfair character. Whether it will be a commercial success is more\r\ndoubtful, but probably that is not of much consequence.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length on the subject of the English Vineyards,\r\nbecause the cultivation of the Vine in Vineyards, like the cultivation\r\nof the Saffron, is a curious instance of an industry foreign to the soil\r\nintroduced, and apparently for many years successful,[304:2] and then\r\nentirely, or almost, given up. The reasons for the cessation of the\r\nEnglish Vineyards are not far to seek. Some have attributed it to a\r\nchange in the seasons, and have supposed that our summers were formerly\r\nhotter than they are now, bringing as a proof the Vineyards and\r\nEnglish-made wine of other days. This was Parkinson's idea. \"Our yeares\r\nin these times do not fall out to be so kindly and hot to ripen the\r\nGrape to make any good wine as formerly they have done.\" But this is a\r\nmere assertion, and I believe it not to be true. I have little doubt\r\nthat quite as good wine could now be made in England as ever was made,\r\nand wine is still made every year in many old-fashioned farmhouses. But\r\nforeign wines can now be produced much better and much cheaper, and that\r\nhas caused the cessation of the English Vineyards. It is true that\r\nFrench and Spanish wines were introduced into England very early, but it\r\nmust have been in limited quantities, and at a high price. When the\r\nquantities increased and the price was lowered, it was well to give up\r\nthe cultivation of the Vine for some more certain crop better suited to\r\nthe soil and the climate, for it must always have been a capricious and\r\nuncertain crop. Hakluyt was one who was very anxious that England should\r\nsupply herself with all the necessaries of life without dependence on\r\nforeign countries, yet, writing in Shakespeare's time, he says: \"It is\r\nsayd that since we traded to Zante, that the plant that beareth the\r\nCoren is also broughte into this realme from thence, and although it\r\nbring not fruit to perfection, yet it may serve for pleasure, and for\r\nsome use, like as our Vines doe which we cannot well spare, although the\r\nclimat so colde will not permit us to have good wines of them\"\r\n(\"Voiages, &c.,\" vol. ii. p. 166). Parkinson says to the same effect:\r\n\"Many have adventured to make Vineyards in England, not only in these\r\nlater days but in ancient times, as may well witness the sundry places\r\nin this land, entituled by the name of Vineyards, and I have read that\r\nmany monasteries in this kingdom having Vineyards had as much wine made\r\ntherefrom as sufficed their convents year by year, but long since they\r\nhave been destroyed, and the knowledge how to order a Vineyard is also\r\nutterly perished with them. For although divers both nobles and\r\ngentlemen have in these later times endeavoured to plant and make\r\nVineyards, and to that purpose have caused Frenchmen, being skilfull in\r\nkeeping and dressing Vines, to be brought over to perform it, yet either\r\ntheir skill faileth them or their Vines were not good, or (the most\r\nlikely) the soil was not fitting, for they could never make any wine\r\nthat was worth the drinking, being so small and heartlesse, that they\r\nsoon gave over their practise.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to say anything of the modern culture of the Vine, or\r\nits many excellent varieties. Even in Virgil's time the varieties\r\ncultivated were so many that he said--\r\n\r\n     \"Sed neque quam multæ species, nec nomina quæ sint\r\n      Est numerus; neque enim numero comprendere refert;\r\n      Quem qui scire velit, Lybici velit æquoris idem\r\n      Discere quam multæ Zephyro turbentur arenæ;\r\n      Aut ubi navigiis violentior incidit Eurus\r\n      Nosse quot Ionii veniant ad littora fluctus.\"\r\n\r\n                                             _Georgica_, ii, 103.\r\n\r\nAnd now the number must far exceed those of Virgil's time. \"The\r\ncultivated varieties are extremely numerous; Count Odart says that he\r\nwill not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800,\r\nperhaps even 1,000 varieties; but not a third of these have any\r\nvalue.\"--DARWIN. These are the Grapes that are grown in our hothouses;\r\nsome also of a fine quality are produced in favourable years\r\nout-of-doors. There are also a few which are grown as ornamental shrubs.\r\nThe Parsley-leaved Vine (_Vitis laciniosa_) is one that has been grown\r\nin England, certainly since the time of Shakespeare, for its pretty\r\nfoliage, its fruit being small and few; but it makes a pretty covering\r\nto a wall or trellis. The small Variegated Vine (_Vitis_ or _Cissus\r\nheterophyllus variegatus_) is another very pretty Vine, forming a small\r\nbush that may be either trained to a wall or grown as a low rockwork\r\nbush; it bears a few Grapes of no value, and is perfectly hardy. Besides\r\nthese there are several North American species, which have handsome\r\nfoliage, and are very hardy, of which the Vitis riparia or Vigne des\r\nBattures is a desirable tree, as \"the flowers have an exquisitely fine\r\nsmell, somewhat resembling that of Mignonnette.\"--DON. I mention this\r\nparticularly, because in all the old authors great stress is laid on the\r\nsweetness of the Vine in all its parts, a point of excellence in it\r\nwhich is now generally overlooked. Lord Bacon reckons \"Vine flowers\"\r\namong the \"things of beauty in season\" in May and June, and reckons\r\namong the most sweet-scented flowers, next to Musk Roses and Strawberry\r\nleaves dying, \"the flower of the Vines; it is a little dust, like the\r\ndust of a bent, which grows among the duster in the first coming\r\nforth.\" And Chaucer says: \"Scorners faren like the foul toode, that may\r\nnoughte endure the soote smel of the Vine roote when it\r\nflourisheth.\"--_The Persones Tale._\r\n\r\nNor must we dismiss the Vine without a few words respecting its sacred\r\nassociations, for it is very much owing to these associations that it\r\nhas been so endeared to our forefathers and ourselves. Having its native\r\nhome in the East, it enters largely into the history and imagery of the\r\nBible. There is no plant so often mentioned in the Bible, and always\r\nwith honour, till the honour culminates in the great similitude, in\r\nwhich our Lord chose the Vine as the one only plant to which He\r\ncondescended to compare Himself--\"I am the true Vine!\" No wonder that a\r\nplant so honoured should ever have been the symbol of joy and plenty, of\r\nnational peace and domestic happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[301:1] According to Vopiscus, England is indebted to the Emperor Probus\r\n(A.D. 276-282) for the Vine: \"Gallis omnibus et Britannis et Hispanis\r\nhinc permisit ut vites haberent, et Vinum conficerent.\"\r\n\r\n[302:1] At Stonehouse \"there are two arpens of Vineyard.\"--_Domesday\r\nBook_, quoted by Rudder. Also \"the Vineyard\" was the residence of the\r\nAbbots of Gloucester. It was at St. Mary de Lode near Gloucester, and\r\n\"the Vineyard and Park were given to the Bishopric of Gloucester at its\r\nfoundation and again confirmed 6th Edward VI.\"--RUDDER.\r\n\r\n[303:1] \"Edinburgh Review,\" April, 1860.\r\n\r\n[303:2] See Preface to \"Palladius on Husbandrie,\" p. viii.

One of these is the\r\nViola tricolor, from which is descended the Pansy, or Love-in-Idleness\r\n(_see_ PANSY). But in all the passages in which Shakespeare names the\r\nViolet, he alludes to the purple sweet-scented Violet, of which he was\r\nevidently very fond, and which is said to be very abundant in the\r\nneighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon. For all the eighteen passages tell\r\nof some point of beauty or sweetness that attracted him. And so it is\r\nwith all the poets from Chaucer downwards--the Violet is noticed by all,\r\nand by all with affectation. I need only mention two of the greatest.\r\nMilton gave the Violet a chief place in the beauties of the \"Blissful\r\nBower\" of our first parents in Paradise--\r\n\r\n                       \"Each beauteous flower,\r\n     Iris all hues, Roses, and Jessamin\r\n     Rear'd high their flourish't heads between, and wrought\r\n     Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,\r\n     Crocus and Hyacinth with rich inlay\r\n     Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone\r\n     Of costliest emblem;\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Paradise Lost_, book iv.\r\n\r\nand Sir Walter Scott crowns it as the queen of wild flowers--\r\n\r\n     \"The Violet in her greenwood bower,\r\n        Where Birchen boughs with Hazels mingle,\r\n      May boast itself the fairest flower\r\n        In glen, in copse, or forest dingle.\"\r\n\r\nYet favourite though it ever has been, it has no English name. Violet is\r\nthe diminutive form of the Latin Viola, which again is the Latin form\r\nof the Greek ἴον. In the old Vocabularies Viola frequently occurs, and\r\nwith the following various translations:--\"Ban-wyrt,\" _i.e._, Bone-wort\r\n(eleventh century Vocabulary); \"Clœfre,\" _i.e._, Clover (eleventh\r\ncentury Vocabulary); \"Violé, Appel-leaf\" (thirteenth century\r\nVocabulary);[310:1] \"Wyolet\" (fourteenth century Vocabulary); \"Vyolytte\"\r\n(fifteenth century Nominale); \"Violetta, A{ce}, a Violet\" (fifteenth\r\ncentury Pictorial Vocabulary); and \"Viola Cleafre, Ban-vyrt\" (Durham\r\nGlossary). It is also mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon translation of the\r\nHerbarium of Apuleius in the tenth century as \"the Herb Viola purpurea;\r\n(1) for new wounds and eke for old; (2) for hardness of the maw\"\r\n(Cockayne's translation). In this last example it is most probable that\r\nour sweet-scented Violet is the plant meant, but in some of the other\r\ncases it is quite certain that some other plant is meant, and perhaps in\r\nall. For Violet was a name given very loosely to many plants, so that\r\nLaurembergius says: \"Vox Violæ distinctissimis floribus communis\r\nest. Videntur mihi antiqui suaveolentes quosque flores generatim\r\nViolas appellasse, cujuscunque etiam forent generis quasi vi\r\noleant.\"--_Apparat. Plant._, 1632. This confusion seems to have arisen\r\nin a very simple way. Theophrastus described the Leucojum, which was\r\neither the Snowdrop or the spring Snowflake, as the earliest-flowering\r\nplant; Pliny literally translated Leucojum into Alba Viola. All the\r\nearlier writers on natural history were in the habit of taking Pliny for\r\ntheir guide, and so they translated his Viola by any early-flowering\r\nplant that most took their fancy. Even as late as 1693, Samuel Gilbert,\r\nin \"The Florists' Vade Mecum,\" under the head of Violets, only describes\r\n\"the lesser early bulbous Violet, a common flower yet not to be wasted,\r\nbecause when none other appears that does, though in the snow, whence\r\ncalled Snowflower or Snowdrop;\" and I think that even later instances\r\nmay be found.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that there is no genuine English name for the Violet, I\r\nought, perhaps, to mention that one name has been attributed to it, but\r\nI do not think that it is more than a clever guess. \"The commentators on\r\nShakespeare have been much puzzled by the epithet 'happy lowlie down,'\r\napplied to the man of humble station in \"Henry IV.,\" and have proposed\r\nto read 'lowly clown,' or to divide the phrase into 'low lie down,' but\r\nthe following lines from Browne clearly prove 'lowly down' to be the\r\ncorrect term, for he uses it in precisely the same sense--\r\n\r\n     'The humble Violet that lowly down\r\n      Salutes the gay nymphs as they trimly pass.'\r\n\r\n                                            _Poet's Pleasaunce._\"\r\n\r\nThis may prove that Browne called the Violet a Lowly-down, but it\r\ncertainly does not prove that name to have been a common name for the\r\nViolet. It was, however, the character of lowliness combined with\r\nsweetness that gave the charm to the Violet in the eyes of the emblem\r\nwriters: it was for them the readiest symbol of the meekness of\r\nhumility. \"Humilitas dat gratiam\" is the motto that Camerarius places\r\nover a clump of Violets. \"A true widow is, in the church, as a little\r\nMarch Violet shedding around an exquisite perfume by the fragrance of\r\nher devotion, and always hidden under the ample leaves of her lowliness,\r\nand by her subdued colouring showing the spirit of her mortification,\r\nshe seeks untrodden and solitary places,\" &c.--ST. FRANCIS DE SALES. And\r\nthe poets could nowhere find a fitter similitude for a modest maiden\r\nthan\r\n\r\n     \"A Violet by a mossy stone\r\n      Half hidden from the eye.\"\r\n\r\nViolets, like Primroses, must always have had their joyful associations\r\nas coming to tell that the winter is passing away and brighter days are\r\nnear, for they are among\r\n\r\n                    \"The first to rise\r\n     And smile beneath spring's wakening skies,\r\n             The courier of a band\r\n     Of coming flowers.\"\r\n\r\nYet it is curious to note how, like Primroses, they have been ever\r\nassociated with death, especially with the death of the young. I suppose\r\nthese ideas must have arisen from a sort of pity for flowers that were\r\nonly allowed to see the opening year, and were cut off before the full\r\nbeauty of summer had come. This was prettily expressed by H. Vaughan,\r\nthe Silurist:\r\n\r\n                 \"So violets, so doth the primrose fall\r\n     At once the spring's pride and its funeral,\r\n     Such early sweets get off in their still prime,\r\n     And stay not here to wear the foil of time;\r\n     While coarser flowers, which none would miss, if past,\r\n     To scorching summers and cold winters last.\"\r\n\r\n                                                 _Daphnis_, 1678.\r\n\r\nIt was from this association that they were looked on as apt emblems of\r\nthose who enjoyed the bright springtide of life and no more. This\r\nfeeling was constantly expressed, and from very ancient times. We find\r\nit in some pretty lines by Prudentius--\r\n\r\n     \"Nos tecta fovebimus ossa\r\n      Violis et fronde frequente,\r\n      Titulumque et frigida saxa\r\n      Liquido spargemus odore.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare expresses the same feeling in the collection of \"purple\r\nViolets and Marigolds\" which Marina carries to hang \"as a carpet on the\r\ngrave\" (No. 14), and again in Laertes' wish that Violets may spring from\r\nthe grave of Ophelia (No. 8), on which Steevens very aptly quotes from\r\nPersius Satires--\r\n\r\n             \"e tumulo fortunataque favillâ.\r\n     Nascentur Violæ.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit Milton, gathering for the grave of Lycidas--\r\n\r\n     \"Every flower that sad embroidery wears,\"\r\n\r\ngathers among others \"the glowing Violet;\" and the same thought is\r\nrepeated by many other writers.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable botanical curiosity in the structure of the Violet\r\nwhich is worth notice: it produces flowers both in spring and autumn,\r\nbut the flowers are very different. In spring they are fully formed and\r\nsweet-scented, but they are mostly barren and produce no seed, while in\r\nautumn they are very small, they have no petals and, I believe, no\r\nscent, but they produce abundance of seed.[313:1]\r\n\r\nI need say nothing to recommend the Violet in all its varieties as a\r\ngarden plant. As a useful medicinal plant it was formerly in high\r\nrepute--\r\n\r\n     \"Vyolet an erbe cowth\r\n      Is knowyn in ilke manys mowthe,\r\n      As bokys seyn in here language,\r\n      It is good to don in potage,\r\n      In playstrys to wondrys it is comfortyf,\r\n      W{h} oyer erbys sanatyf:\"\r\n\r\n                                                  _Stockholm MS._\r\n\r\nand it still holds a place in the Pharmacopœia, while the chemist\r\nfinds the pretty flowers one of the most delicate tests for detecting\r\nthe presence of acids and alkalies; but as to the many other virtues of\r\nthe Violet I cannot do better than quote Gerard's pleasant and quaint\r\nwords: \"The Blacke or Purple Violets, or March Violets of the garden,\r\nhave a great prerogative above others, not only because the minde\r\nconceiveth a certain pleasure and recreation by smelling and handling of\r\nthose most odoriferous flowres, but also for that very many by these\r\nViolets receive ornament and comely grace; for there be made of them\r\ngarlands for the head, nosegaies, and poesies, which are delightfull to\r\nlooke on and pleasant to smell to, speaking nothing of their appropriate\r\nvertues; yea, gardens themselves receive by these the greatest ornament\r\nof all chiefest beautie and most gallant grace, and the recreation of\r\nthe minde which is taken thereby cannot but be very good and honest; for\r\nthey admonish and stir up a man to that which is comely and honest, for\r\nflowres through their beautie, variety of colour, and exquisite forme,\r\ndo bring to a liberall and greatte many minde the remembrance of\r\nhonestie, comelinesse, and all kindes of vertues. For it would be an\r\nunseemely and filthie thing (as a certain wise man saith) for him that\r\ndoth looke upon and handle faire and beautifull things, and who\r\nfrequenteth and is conversant in faire and beautifull places, to have\r\nhis minde not faire but filthie and deformed.\" With these brave words of\r\nthe old gardener I might well close my account of this favourite\r\nflower, but I must add George Herbert's lines penned in the same\r\nspirit--\r\n\r\n     \"Farewell, dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,\r\n      Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,\r\n                And after death for cures;\r\n      I follow straight without complaint or grief,\r\n      Since if my scent be good, I care not if\r\n                It be as short as yours.\"\r\n\r\n                                                 _Poems on Life._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[310:1] Appel-leaf is given as the English name for Viola in two other\r\nMS. Glossaries quoted by Cockayne, vol. iii. p. 312.\r\n\r\n[313:1] This peculiarity is not confined to the Violet. It is found in\r\nsome species of Oxalis, Impatiens, Campanula, Eranthemum, Amphicarpea,\r\nLeeisia, &c. Such plants are technically called Cleistogamous, and are\r\nall self-fertilizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Petruchio._\r\n\r\n     Why, 'tis a cockle or a Walnut-shell,\r\n     A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.\r\n\r\n                       _Taming of the Shrew_, act iv, sc. 3 (66).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Ford._\r\n\r\n     Let them say of me, \"As jealous as Ford that searched a hollow\r\n       Walnut for his wife's leman.\"\r\n\r\n                   _Merry Wives of Windsor_, act iv, sc. 2 (170).\r\n\r\nThe Walnut is a native of Persia and China, and its foreign origin is\r\ntold in all its names. The Greeks called it Persicon, _i.e._, the\r\nPersian tree, and Basilikon, _i.e._, the Royal tree; the Latins gave it\r\na still higher rank, naming it Juglans, _i.e._, Jove's Nut. \"Hæc glans,\r\noptima et maxima, ab Jove et glande juglans appellata est.\"--VARRO. The\r\nEnglish names tell the same story. It was first simply called Nut, as\r\nthe Nut _par excellence_. \"_Juglantis vel nux_, knutu.\"--ÆLFRIC'S\r\n_Vocabulary_. But in the fourteenth century it had obtained the name of\r\n\"Ban-nut,\" from its hardness. So it is named in a metrical Vocabulary of\r\nthe fourteenth century--\r\n\r\n       Pomus       Pirus     Corulus nux     Avelanaque      Ficus\r\n     Appul-tre   Peere-tre    Hasyl Note    Bannenote-tre    Fygge;\r\n\r\nand this name it still holds in the West of England. But at the same\r\ntime it had also acquired the name of Walnut. \"_Hec avelana_, A{ce}\r\nWalnot-tree\" (Vocabulary fourteenth century). \"_Hec avelana_, a Walnutte\r\nand the Nutte\" (Nominate fifteenth century). This name is commonly\r\nsupposed to have reference to the hard shell, but it only means that\r\nthe nut is of foreign origin. \"Wal\" is another form of Walshe or Welch,\r\nand so Lyte says that the tree is called \"in English the Walnut and\r\nWalshe Nut tree.\" \"The word Welsh (_wilisc_, _woelisc_) meant simply a\r\nforeigner, one who was not of Teutonic race, and was (by the Saxons)\r\napplied especially to nations using the Latin language. In the Middle\r\nAges the French language, and in fact all those derived from Latin, and\r\ncalled on that account _linguæ Romanæ_, were called in German _Welsch_.\r\nFrance was called by the mediæval German writers _daz Welsche lant_, and\r\nwhen they wished to express 'in the whole world,' they said, _in allen\r\nWelschen und in Tiutschen richen_, 'in all Welsh and Teutonic kingdoms.'\r\nIn modern German the name _Wälsch_ is used more especially for\r\nItalian.\"--WRIGHT'S _Celt, Roman, and Saxon_.[315:1] This will at once\r\nexplain that Walnut simply means the foreign or non-English Nut.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a well-established and common tree in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, for all the writers of his day speak of it as a high and large\r\ntree, and I should think it very likely that Walnut trees were even more\r\nextensively planted in his day than in our own. There are many noble\r\nspecimens to be seen in different parts of England, especially in the\r\nchalk districts, for \"it delights,\" says Evelyn, \"in a dry, sound, rich\r\nland, especially if it incline to a feeding chalk or marl; and where it\r\nmay be protected from the cold (though it affects cold rather than\r\nextreme heat), as in great pits, valleys, and highway sides; also in\r\nstony ground, if loamy, and on hills, especially chalky; likewise in\r\ncornfields.\" The grand specimens that may be seen in the sheltered\r\nvillages lying under the chalk downs of Wiltshire and Berkshire bear\r\nwitness to the truth of Evelyn's remarks. But the finest English\r\nspecimens can bear no comparison with the size of the Walnut trees in\r\nwarmer countries, and especially where they are indigenous. There they\r\n\"sometimes attain prodigious size and great age. An Italian architect\r\nmentions having seen at St. Nicholas, in Lorraine, a single plank of the\r\nwood of the Walnut, 25ft. wide, upon which the Emperor Frederick III.\r\nhad given a sumptuous banquet. In the Baidar Valley, near Balaclava, in\r\nthe Crimea, stands a Walnut tree at least 1000 years old. It yields\r\nannually from 80,000 to 100,000 Nuts, and belongs to five Tartar\r\nfamilies, who share its produce equally.\"--_Gardener's Chronicle._\r\n\r\nThe economic uses of the Walnut are now chiefly confined to the timber,\r\nwhich is highly prized both for furniture and gun-stocks, and to the\r\nproduction of oil, which is not much used in Europe, but is highly\r\nvalued in the East. \"It dries much more slowly than any other distilled\r\noil, and hence its great value, as it allows the artist as much time as\r\nhe requires in order to blend his colours and finish his work. In\r\nconjunction with amber varnish it forms a vehicle which leaves nothing\r\nto be desired, and which doubtless was the vehicle of Van Eyck, and in\r\nmany instances of the Venetian masters, and of Correggio.\"--_Arts of the\r\nMiddle Ages_, preface. In mediæval times a high medicinal value was\r\nattached to the fruit, for the celebrated antidote against poison which\r\nwas so firmly believed in, and which was attributed to Mithridates, King\r\nof Pontus, was chiefly composed of Walnuts. \"Two Nuttes (he is speaking\r\nof Walnuts) and two Figges, and twenty Rewe leaves, stamped together\r\nwith a little salt, and eaten fasting, doth defende a man from poison\r\nand pestilence that day.\"--BULLEIN, _Governmente of Health_, 1558.\r\n\r\nThe Walnut holds an honoured place in heraldry. Two large Walnut trees\r\novershadow the tomb of the poet Waller in Beaconsfield churchyard, and\r\n\"these are connected with a curious piece of family history. The tree\r\nwas chosen as the Waller crest after Agincourt, where the head of the\r\nfamily took the Duke of Orleans prisoner, and took afterwards as his\r\ncrest the arms of Orleans hanging by a label in a Walnut tree with this\r\nmotto for the device: _Hæc fructus virtutis._\"--_Gardener's Chronicle_,\r\nAug., 1878.\r\n\r\nWalnuts are still very popular, but not as poison antidotes; their\r\npopularity now rests on their use as pickles, their excellence as autumn\r\nand winter dessert fruits, and with pseudo-gipsies for the rich olive\r\nhue that the juice will give to the skin. These uses, together with the\r\nbeauty in the landscape that is given by an old Walnut tree, will always\r\nsecure for it a place among English trees; yet there can be little doubt\r\nthat the Walnut is a bad neighbour to other crops, and for that reason\r\nits numbers in England have been much diminished. Phillips said there\r\nwas a decided antipathy between Apples and Walnuts, and spoke of the\r\nApple tree as--\r\n\r\n     \"Uneasy, seated by funereal Yew\r\n      Or Walnut (whose malignant touch impairs\r\n      All generous fruits), or near the bitter dews\r\n      Of Cherries.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in this he was probably right, though the mischief caused to the\r\nApple tree more probably arises from the dense shade thrown by the\r\nWalnut tree than by any malarious exhalation emitted from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[315:1] See Earle's \"Philology of the English Tongue,\" p. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARDEN, _see_ PEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Iris._\r\n\r\n     Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\r\n     Of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Vetches, Oats, and Pease.\r\n\r\n                                   _Tempest_, act iv, sc. 1 (60).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Helena._\r\n\r\n     More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,\r\n     When Wheat is green, when Hawthorn-buds appear.\r\n\r\n                   _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act i, sc. 1 (184).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Bassanio._\r\n\r\n     His reasons are as two grains of Wheat hid in two bushels of\r\n       chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when\r\n       you have them, they are not worth the search.\r\n\r\n                        _Merchant of Venice_, act i, sc. 1 (114).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Hamlet._\r\n\r\n     As peace should still her Wheaten garland wear.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act v, sc. 2 (41).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Pompey._\r\n\r\n     To send measures of Wheat to Rome.\r\n\r\n                      _Antony and Cleopatra_, act ii, sc. 6 (36).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Edgar._\r\n\r\n     This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. . . .

Wheat is not an\r\nEnglish plant, nor is it a European plant; its original home is in\r\nNorthern Asia, whence it has spread into all civilized countries.[318:1]\r\nFor the cultivation of Wheat is one of the first signs of civilized\r\nlife; it marks the end of nomadic life, and implies more or less a\r\nsettled habitation. When it reached England, and to what country we are\r\nindebted for it, we do not know; but we know that while we are indebted\r\nto the Romans for so many of our useful trees, and fruits, and\r\nvegetables, we are not indebted to them for the introduction of Wheat.\r\nThis we might be almost sure of from the very name, which has no\r\nconnection with the Latin names, _triticum_ or _frumentum_, but is a\r\npure old English word, signifying originally _white_, and so\r\ndistinguishing it as the white grain in opposition to the darker grains\r\nof Oats and Rye. But besides the etymological evidence, we have good\r\nhistorical evidence that Cæsar found Wheat growing in England when he\r\nfirst landed on the shores of Kent. He daily victualled his camp with\r\nBritish Wheat (\"frumentum ex agris quotidie in castra conferebat\"); and\r\nit was while his soldiers were reaping the Wheat in the Kentish fields\r\nthat they were surrounded and successfully attacked by the British. He\r\ntells us, however, that the cultivation of Wheat was chiefly confined to\r\nKent, and was not much known inland: \"interiores plerique frumenta non\r\nserunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt.\"--_De Bello Gallico_, v, 14. Roman\r\nWheat has frequently been found in graves, and strange stories have\r\nbeen told of the plants that have been raised from these old seeds; but\r\na more scientific inquiry has proved that there have been mistakes or\r\ndeceits, more or less intentional, for \"Wheat is said to keep for seven\r\nyears at the longest. The statements as to mummy Wheat are wholly devoid\r\nof authenticity, as are those of the Raspberry seeds taken from a Roman\r\ntomb.\"--HOOKER, \"Botany\" in _Science Primers_. The oft-repeated stories\r\nabout the vitality of mummy Wheat were effectually disposed of when it\r\nwas discovered that much of the so-called Wheat was South American\r\nMaize.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[318:1] Yet Homer considered it to be indigenous in Sicily--Odyss: ix,\r\n109--and Cicero, perhaps on the authority of Homer, says the same:\r\n\"Insula Cereris . . . ubi primum fruges inventæ esse dicuntur.\"--_In\r\nVerrem_, v, 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Viola._\r\n\r\n     Make me a Willow cabin at your gate.\r\n\r\n                             _Twelfth Night_, act i, sc. 5 (287).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Benedick._\r\n\r\n     Come, will you go with me?\r\n\r\n     _Claudio._\r\n\r\n     Whither?\r\n\r\n     _Benedick._\r\n\r\n     Even to the next Willow, about your own business.\r\n\r\n                   _Much Ado About Nothing_, act ii, sc. 1 (192).\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Benedick._\r\n\r\n     I offered him my company to a Willow tree, either to make him\r\n       a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as\r\n       being worthy to be whipped.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Ibid._ (223).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Nathaniel._\r\n\r\n     These thoughts to me were Oaks, to thee like Osiers bow'd.\r\n\r\n                     _Love's Labour's Lost_, act iv, sc. 2 (112).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Lorenzo._\r\n\r\n                      In such a night\r\n     Stood Dido, with a Willow in her hand,\r\n     Upon the wild sea-banks.\r\n\r\n                          _Merchant of Venice_, act v, sc. 1 (9).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Bona._\r\n\r\n     Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,\r\n     I'll wear the Willow garland for his sake.\r\n\r\n                             _3d Henry VI_, act iii, sc. 3 (227).\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Post._\r\n\r\n     [The same words repeated.]\r\n\r\n                                     _Ibid._, act iv, sc. 1 (99).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Queen._\r\n\r\n     There is a Willow grows aslant a brook,\r\n     That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.\r\n     There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds\r\n     Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke.\r\n\r\n                                   _Hamlet_, act iv, sc. 7 (167).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (7) _Desdemona_ (singing)--\r\n\r\n     The poor soul sat sighing by a Sycamore tree.\r\n               Sing all a green Willow;\r\n     Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,\r\n               Sing Willow, Willow, Willow.\r\n     The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;\r\n               Sing Willow, Willow, Willow.\r\n     Her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones,\r\n               Sing Willow, Willow, Willow.\r\n     Sing all a green Willow must be my garland.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act iv, sc. 3 (41).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (8) _Emilia._\r\n\r\n                           I will play the swan,\r\n     And die in music.

It was also called Osier.\r\n\r\nThe Willow is a native of Britain. It belongs to a large family\r\n(_Salix_), numbering 160 species, of which we have seventeen distinct\r\nspecies in Great Britain, besides many sub-species and varieties. So\r\ncommon a plant, with the peculiar pliability of the shoots that\r\ndistinguishes all the family, was sure to be made much use of. Its more\r\ncommon uses were for basket-making, for coracles, and huts, or\r\n\"Willow-cabins\" (No. 1), but it had other uses in the elegancies and\r\neven in the romance of life. The flowers of the early Willow (_S.\r\ncaprea_) did duty for and were called Palms on Palm Sunday (_see_ PALM),\r\nand not only the flowers but the branches also seem to have been used in\r\ndecoration, a use which is now extinct. \"The Willow is called _Salix_,\r\nand hath his name _à saliendo_, for that it quicklie groweth up, and\r\nsoon becommeth a tree. Heerewith do they in some countries trim up their\r\nparlours and dining roomes in sommer, and sticke fresh greene leaves\r\nthereof about their beds for coolness.\"--NEWTON'S _Herball for the\r\nBible_.[321:1]\r\n\r\nBut if we only look at the poetry of the time of Shakespeare, and much\r\nof the poetry before and after him, we should almost conclude that the\r\nsole use of the Willow was to weave garlands for jilted lovers, male and\r\nfemale. It was probably with reference to this that Shakespeare\r\nrepresented poor mad Ophelia hanging her flowers on the \"Willow tree\r\naslant the brook\" (No. 6), and it is more pointedly referred to in Nos.\r\n2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The feeling was expressed in a melancholy ditty,\r\nwhich must have been very popular in the sixteenth century, of which\r\nDesdemona says a few of the first verses (No. 7), and which concludes\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n     \"Come all you forsaken and sit down by me,\r\n      He that plaineth of his false love, mine's falser than she;\r\n      The Willow wreath weare I, since my love did fleet,\r\n      A garland for lovers forsaken most meet.\"\r\n\r\nThe ballad is entitled \"The Complaint of a Lover Forsaken of His\r\nLove--To a Pleasant New Tune,\" and is printed in the \"Roxburghe\r\nBallads.\" This curious connection of the Willow with forsaken or\r\ndisappointed lovers stood its ground for a long time. Spenser spoke of\r\nthe \"Willow worne of forlorne paramoures.\" Drayton says that--\r\n\r\n     \"In love the sad forsaken wight\r\n      The Willow garland weareth\"--\r\n\r\n                                                _Muse's Elysium._\r\n\r\nand though we have long given up the custom of wearing garlands of any\r\nsort, yet many of us can recollect one of the most popular street songs,\r\nthat was heard everywhere, and at last passed into a proverb, and which\r\nbegan--\r\n\r\n     \"All round my hat I vears a green Willow\r\n      In token,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by many that this melancholy association with the\r\nWillow arose from its Biblical associations; and this may be so, though\r\nall the references to the Willow that occur in the Bible are, with one\r\nnotable exception, connected with joyfulness and fertility. The one\r\nexception is the plaintive wail in the 137th Psalm--\r\n\r\n     \"By the streams of Babel, there we sat down,\r\n      And we wept when we remembered Zion.\r\n      On the Willows among the rivers we hung our harps.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this one record has been sufficient to alter the emblematic\r\ncharacter of the Willow--\"this one incident has made the Willow an\r\nemblem of the deepest of sorrows, namely, sorrow for sin found out, and\r\nvisited with its due punishment. From that time the Willow appears never\r\nagain to have been associated with feelings of gladness. Even among\r\nheathen nations, for what reason we know not, it was a tree of evil\r\nomen, and was employed to make the torches carried at funerals. Our own\r\npoets made the Willow the symbol of despairing woe.\"--JOHNS. This is the\r\nmore remarkable because the tree referred to in the Psalms, the Weeping\r\nWillow (_Salix Babylonica_), which by its habit of growth is to us so\r\nsuggestive of crushing sorrow, was quite unknown in Europe till a very\r\nrecent period. \"It grows abundantly on the banks of the Euphrates, and\r\nother parts of Asia, as in Palestine, and also in North Africa;\" but it\r\nis said to have been introduced into England during the last century,\r\nand then in a curious way. \"Many years ago, the well-known poet,\r\nAlexander Pope, who resided at Twickenham, received a basket of Figs as\r\na present from Turkey. The basket was made of the supple branches of the\r\nWeeping Willow, the very same species under which the captive Jews sat\r\nwhen they wept by the waters of Babylon. The poet valued highly the\r\nsmall and tender twigs associated with so much that was interesting, and\r\nhe untwisted the basket, and planted one of the branches in the ground.\r\nIt had some tiny buds upon it, and he hoped he might be able to rear it,\r\nas none of this species of Willow was known in England. Happily the\r\nWillow is very quick to take root and grow. The little branch soon\r\nbecame a tree, and drooped gracefully over the river, in the same manner\r\nthat its race had done over the waters of Babylon. From that one branch\r\nall the Weeping Willows in England are descended.\"--KIRBY'S\r\n_Trees_.[323:1]\r\n\r\nThere is probably no tree that contributes so largely to the\r\nconveniences of English life as the Willow. Putting aside its uses in\r\nthe manufacture of gunpowder and cricket bats, we may safely say that\r\nthe most scantily-furnished house can boast of some article of Willow\r\nmanufacture in the shape of baskets. British basket-making is, as far as\r\nwe know, the oldest national manufacture; it is the manufacture in\r\nconnection with which we have the earliest record of the value placed on\r\nBritish work. British baskets were exported to Rome, and it would almost\r\nseem as if baskets were unknown in Rome until they were introduced from\r\nBritain, for with the article of import came the name also, and the\r\nBritish \"basket\" became the Latin \"bascauda.\" We have curious evidence\r\nof the high value attached to these baskets. Juvenal describes Catullus\r\nin fear of shipwreck throwing overboard his most precious treasures:\r\n\"precipitare volens etiam pulcherrima,\" and among these \"pulcherrima\" he\r\nmentions \"bascaudas.\" Martial bears a still higher testimony to the\r\nvalue set on \"British baskets,\" reckoning them among the many rich\r\ngifts distributed at the Saturnalia--\r\n\r\n     \"Barbara de pictis veni bascauda Britannis\r\n      Sed me jam vult dicere Roma suam.\"--Book xiv, 99.\r\n\r\nMany of the Willows make handsome shrubs for the garden, for besides\r\nthose that grow into large trees, there are many that are low shrubs,\r\nand some so low as to be fairly called carpet plants. Salix Reginæ is\r\none of the most silvery shrubs we have, with very narrow leaves; S.\r\nlanata is almost as silvery, but with larger and woolly leaves, and\r\nmakes a very pretty object when grown on rockwork near water; S.\r\nrosmarinifolia is another desirable shrub; and among the lower-growing\r\nspecies, the following will grow well on rockwork, and completely clothe\r\nthe surface: S. alpina, S. Grahami, S. retusa, S. serpyllifolia, and S.\r\nreticulata. They are all easily cultivated and are quite hardy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[321:1] In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Willow does not\r\nappear to have had any value for its medical uses. In the present day\r\nsalicine and salicylic acid are produced from the bark, and have a high\r\nreputation as antiseptics and in rheumatic cases.\r\n\r\n[323:1] This is the traditional history of the introduction of the\r\nWeeping Willow into England, but it is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODBINE, _see_ HONEYSUCKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Rosaline._\r\n\r\n     To weed this Wormwood from your fruitful brain.\r\n\r\n                      _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v, sc. 2 (857).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Nurse._\r\n\r\n     For I had then laid Wormwood to my dug.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     When it did taste the Wormwood on the nipple\r\n     Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool.\r\n\r\n                           _Romeo and Juliet_, act i, sc. 3 (26).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Hamlet_ (aside).\r\n\r\n     Wormwood, Wormwood.\r\n\r\n                                  _Hamlet_, act iii, sc. 2 (191).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4)\r\n\r\n     Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,\r\n     Thy private feasting to a public fast,\r\n     Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,\r\n     Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter Wormwood taste.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Lucrece_ (890).\r\n\r\n_See also_ DIAN'S BUD.\r\n\r\nWormwood is the product of many species of Artemisia, a family\r\nconsisting of 180 species, of which we have four in England. The whole\r\nfamily is remarkable for the extreme bitterness of all parts of the\r\nplant, so that \"as bitter as Wormwood\" is one of the oldest proverbs.\r\nThe plant was named Artemisia from Artemis, the Greek name of Diana, and\r\nfor this reason: \"Verily of these three Worts which we named Artemisia,\r\nit is said that Diana should find them, and delivered their powers and\r\nleechdom to Chiron the Centaur, who first from these Worts set forth a\r\nleechdom, and he named these Worts from the name of Diana, Artemis, that\r\nis, Artemisias.\"--_Herbarium Apulæi_, Cockayne's translation. The\r\nWormwood was of very high reputation in medicine, and is thus\r\nrecommended in the Stockholm MS.:\r\n\r\n     \"Lif man or woman, more or lesse\r\n      In his head have gret sicknesse\r\n      Or gruiance or any werking\r\n      Awoyne he take wt. owte lettyng\r\n      It is called Sowthernwode also\r\n      And hony eteys et spurge stamp yer to\r\n      And late hy yis drunk, fastined drinky\r\n      And his hed werk away schall synkyn.\"[325:1]\r\n\r\nBut even in Shakespeare's time this high character had somewhat abated,\r\nthough it was still used for all medicines in which a strong bitter was\r\nrecommended. But its chief use seems to have been as a protection\r\nagainst insects of all kinds, who might very reasonably be supposed to\r\navoid such a bitter food. This is Tusser's advice about the plant--\r\n\r\n     \"While Wormwood hath seed get a handful or twaine\r\n      To save against March, to make flea to refraine:\r\n      Where chamber is sweeped and Wormwood is strowne,\r\n      No flea, for his life, dare abide to be knowne.\r\n      What saver is better (if physick be true),\r\n      For places infected than Wormwood and Rue?\r\n      It is as a comfort for hart and the braine,\r\n      And therefore to have it, it is not in vaine.\"\r\n\r\n                                              _July's Husbandry._\r\n\r\nThis quality was the origin of the names of Mugwort[326:1] and Wormwood.\r\nIts other name (in the Stockholm MS. referred to), Avoyne or Averoyne is\r\na corruption of the specific name of one of the species, A. Abrotanum.\r\nSouthernwood is the southern Wormwood, _i.e._, the foreign, as\r\ndistinguished from the native plant. The modern name for the same\r\nspecies is Boy's Love, or Old Man. The last name may have come from its\r\nhoary leaves, though different explanations are given: the other name is\r\ngiven to it, according to Dr. Prior, \"from an ointment made with its\r\nashes being used by young men to promote the growth of a beard.\" There\r\nis good authority for this derivation, but I think the name may have\r\nbeen given for other reasons. \"Boy's Love\" is one of the most favourite\r\ncottage-garden plants, and it enters largely into the rustic language of\r\nflowers. No posy presented by a young man to his lass is complete\r\nwithout Boy's Love; and it is an emblem of fidelity, at least it was so\r\nonce. It is, in fact, a Forget-me-Not, from its strong abiding smell; so\r\nSt. Francis de Sales applied it: \"To love in the midst of sweets, little\r\nchildren could do that; but to love in the bitterness of Wormwood is a\r\nsure sign of our affectionate fidelity.\" Not that the Wormwood was ever\r\nnamed Forget-me-Not, for that name was given to the Ground Pine (_Ajuga\r\nchamæpitys_) on account of its unpleasant and long-enduring smell, until\r\nit was transferred to the Myosotis (which then lost its old name of\r\nMouse-ear), and the pretty legend was manufactured to account for the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn England Wormwood has almost fallen into complete disuse; but in\r\nFrance it is largely used in the shape of Absinthe. As a garden plant,\r\nTarragon, which is a species of Wormwood, will claim a place in every\r\nherb garden, and there are a few, such as A. sericea, A. cana, and A.\r\nalpina, which make pretty shrubs for the rockwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[325:1] Wormwood had a still higher reputation among the ancients, as\r\nthe following extract shows:\r\n\r\n     Ἀρτεμισία μονόκλωνος.\r\n\r\n     Αὐει γὰρ κόπον ἀυδρὸς ὁδοιπόρου, ὅς κ᾽ ένι χέρσιν\r\n     την μονόκλωνον ἔχη· περὶ δ᾿ ἀυ ποσὶν ἕρπετα πάντα\r\n     φεύγει, ἤν τις ἔχη ἐν ὁδῶ, κὰι φάσματα δεινά.\r\n\r\n                 _Anonymi Carmen de Herbis, in \"Poetæ Bucolici.\"_\r\n\r\n[326:1] In connection with Mugwort there is a most curious account of\r\nthe formation of a plant name given in a note in the \"Promptorium\r\nParvulorum,\" s.v. Mugworte: \"Mugwort, al on as seyn some, Modirwort;\r\nlewed folk that in manye wordes conne no rygt sownyge, but ofte shortyn\r\nwordys, and changyn lettrys and silablys, they coruptyn the _o_ in to\r\n_a_ and _d_ in to _g_, and syncopyn _i_ smytyn a-wey _i_ and _r_ and\r\nseyn mugwort.\"--_Arundel MS._, 42, f. 35 v.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) _Song._\r\n\r\n     My shroud of white, stuck all with Yew,\r\n     Oh! prepare it.\r\n\r\n                             _Twelfth Night_, act ii, sc. 4 (56).\r\n\r\n\r\n     _(2) 3rd Witch._\r\n\r\n     Gall of goat, and slips of Yew\r\n     Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse.\r\n\r\n                                   _Macbeth_, act iv, sc. 1 (27).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Scroop._\r\n\r\n     Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\r\n     Of double-fatal Yew against thy state.\r\n\r\n                              _Richard II_, act iii, sc. 2 (116).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Tamora._\r\n\r\n     But straight they told me they would bind me here\r\n     Unto the body of a dismal Yew.\r\n\r\n                         _Titus Andronicus_, act ii, sc. 3 (106).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _Paris._\r\n\r\n     Under yond Yew-trees lay thee all along,\r\n     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;\r\n     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\r\n     (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\r\n     But thou shalt hear it.\r\n\r\n                            _Romeo and Juliet_, act v, sc. 3 (3).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (6) _Balthasar._\r\n\r\n     As I did sleep under this Yew tree here,[327:1]\r\n     I dreamt my master and another fought,\r\n     And that my master slew him.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Ibid._ (137).\r\n\r\n_See also_ HEBENON, p. 118.\r\n\r\nThe Yew, though undoubtedly an indigenous British plant, has not a\r\nBritish name. The name is derived from the Latin _Iva_, and \"under this\r\nname we find the _Yew_ so inextricably mixed up with the _Ivy_ that, as\r\ndissimilar as are the two trees, there can be no doubt that these names\r\nare in their origin identical.\" So says Dr. Prior, and he proceeds to\r\ngive a long and very interesting account of the origin of the name. The\r\nconnection of Yew with _iva_ and _Ivy_ is still shown in the French\r\n_if_, the German _eibe_, and the Portuguese _iva_. _Yew_ seems to be\r\nquite a modern form; in the old vocabularies the word is variously spelt\r\niw, ewe,[328:1] eugh-tre,[328:2] haw-tre, new-tre, ew, uhe, and iw.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the Yew with churchyards and funerals is noticed by\r\nShakespeare in Nos. 1, 5, and 6, and its celebrated connection with\r\nEnglish bow-making in No. 3, where \"double-fatal\" may probably refer to\r\nits noxious qualities when living and its use for deadly weapons\r\nafterwards. These noxious qualities, joined to its dismal colour, and to\r\nits constant use in churchyards, caused it to enter into the supposed\r\ncharms and incantations of the quacks of the Middle Ages. Yet Gerard\r\nentirely denies its noxious qualities: \"They say that the fruit thereof\r\nbeing eaten is not onely dangerous and deadly unto man, but if birds do\r\neat thereof it causeth them to cast their feathers and many times to\r\ndie--all which I dare boldly affirme is altogether untrue; for when I\r\nwas yong and went to schoole, divers of my schoolfellowes, and likewise\r\nmy selfe, did eat our fils of the berries of this tree, and have not\r\nonly slept under the shadow thereof, but among the branches also,\r\nwithout any hurt at all, and that not at one time but many times.\"\r\nBrowne says the same in his \"Vulgar Errors:\" \"That Yew and the berries\r\nthereof are harmlesse, we know\" (book ii. c. 7). There is no doubt that\r\nthe Yew berries are almost if not quite harmless,[328:3] and I find them\r\nforming an element in an Anglo-Saxon recipe, which may be worth quoting\r\nas an example of the medicines to which our forefathers submitted. It is\r\ngiven in a Leech Book of the tenth century or earlier, and is thus\r\ntranslated by Cockayne: \"If a man is in the water elf disease, then are\r\nthe nails of his hand livid, and the eyes tearful, and he will look\r\ndownwards. Give him this for a leechdom: Everthroat, cassuck, the\r\nnetherward part of fane, a yew berry, lupin, helenium, a head of marsh\r\nmallow, fen, mint, dill, lily, attorlothe, pulegium, marrubium, dock,\r\nelder, fel terræ, wormwood, strawberry leaves, consolida; pour them over\r\nwith ale, add holy water, sing this charm over them thrice [here follow\r\nsome long charms which I need not extract]; these charms a man may sing\r\nover a wound\" (\"Leech Book,\" iii. 63).\r\n\r\nI need say little of the uses of the Yew wood in furniture, nor of the\r\nmany grand specimens of the tree which are scattered throughout the\r\nchurchyards of England, except to say that \"the origin of planting Yew\r\ntrees in churchyards is still a subject of considerable perplexity. As\r\nthe Yew was of such great importance in war and field sports before the\r\nuse of gunpowder was known, perhaps the parsons of parishes were\r\nrequired to see that the churchyard was capable of supplying bows to the\r\nmales of each parish of proper age; but in this case we should scarcely\r\nhave been left without some evidence on the matter. Others again state\r\nthat the trees in question were intended solely to furnish branches for\r\nuse on Palm Sunday\"[329:1] (_see_ PALM, p. 195), \"while many suppose\r\nthat the Yew was naturally selected for planting around churches on\r\naccount of its emblematic character, as expressive of the solemnity of\r\ndeath, while, from its perennial verdure and long duration, it might be\r\nregarded as a pattern of immortality.\"--_Penny Magazine_, 1843.\r\n\r\nA good list of the largest and oldest Yews in England will be found in\r\nLoudon's \"Arboretum.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"dismal Yew\" concludes the list of Shakespeare's plants and the\r\nfirst part of my proposed subject; and while I hope that those readers\r\nwho may have gone with me so far have met with some things to interest\r\nthem, I hope also they will agree with me that gardening and the love of\r\nflowers is not altogether the modern accomplishment that many of our\r\ngardeners now fancy it to be. Here are two hundred names of plants in\r\none writer, and that writer not at all writing on horticulture, but only\r\nmentioning plants and flowers in the most incidental manner as they\r\nhappened naturally to fall in his way. I should doubt if there is any\r\nsimilar instance in any modern English writer, and feel very sure that\r\nthere is no such instance in any modern English dramatist. It shows how\r\nfamiliar gardens and flowers were to Shakespeare, and that he must have\r\nhad frequent opportunities for observing his favourites (for most surely\r\nhe was fond of flowers), not only in their wild and native homes, but in\r\nthe gardens of farmhouses and parsonages, country houses, and noblemen's\r\nstately pleasaunces. The quotations that I have been able to make from\r\nthe early writers in the ninth and tenth centuries, down to gossiping\r\nold Gerard, the learned Lord Chancellor Bacon, and that excellent old\r\ngardiner Parkinson, all show the same thing, that the love of flowers is\r\nno new thing in England, still less a foreign fashion, but that it is\r\ninnate in us, a real instinct, that showed itself as strongly in our\r\nforefathers as in ourselves; and when we find that such men as\r\nShakespeare and Lord Bacon (to mention no others) were almost proud to\r\nshow their knowledge of plants and love of flowers, we can say that such\r\nlove and knowledge is thoroughly manly and English.\r\n\r\nIn the inquiry into Shakespeare's plants I have entered somewhat largely\r\ninto the etymological history of the names. I have been tempted into\r\nthis by the personal interest I feel in the history of plant names, and\r\nI hope it may not have been uninteresting to my readers; but I do not\r\nthink this part of the subject could have been passed by, for I agree\r\nwith Johnston: \"That there is more interest and as much utility in\r\nsettling the nomenclature of our pastoral bards as that of all\r\nherbalists and dry-as-dust botanists\" (\"Botany of the Eastern Border\").\r\nI have also at times entered into the botany and physiology of the\r\nplants; this may have seemed needless to some, but I have thought that\r\nsuch notices were often necessary to the right understanding of the\r\nplants named, and again I shelter myself under the authority of a\r\nfavourite old author: \"Consider (gentle readers) what shiftes he shall\r\nbe put unto, and how rawe he must needs be in explanation of metaphors,\r\nresemblances, and comparisons, that is ignorant of the nature of herbs\r\nand plants from whence their similitudes be taken, for the inlightening\r\nand garnishing of sentences.\"--NEWTON'S _Herball for the Bible_.\r\n\r\nI have said that my subject naturally divides itself into two parts,\r\nfirst, The Plants and Flowers named by Shakespeare; second, His\r\nKnowledge of Gardens and Gardening. The first part is now concluded, and\r\nI go to the second part, which will be very much shorter, and which may\r\nbe entitled \"The Garden-craft of Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[327:1] The reading of the folio is \"young tree,\" for \"Yew tree.\"\r\n\r\n[328:1]\r\n\r\n     \"An Eu tre (Ewetre); taxus, taximus.\"--_Catholicon Anglicum._\r\n\r\n[328:2]\r\n\r\n     \"The eugh obedient to the bender's will.\"--SPENSER, _F.

It is from these\r\npassages, even more than from the passages I have already quoted, in\r\nwhich particular flowers are named, that we learn how thoroughly his\r\nearly country life had influenced and marked his character, and how his\r\nwhole spirit was most naturally coloured by it. Numberless allusions to\r\nflowers and their culture prove that his boyhood and early manhood were\r\nspent in the country, and that as he passed through the parks, fields,\r\nand lanes of his native county, or spent pleasant days in the gardens\r\nand orchards of the manor-houses and farm-houses of the neighbourhood,\r\nhis eyes and ears were open to all the sights and sounds of a healthy\r\ncountry life, and he was, perhaps unconsciously, laying up in his memory\r\na goodly store of pleasant pictures and homely country talk, to be\r\nintroduced in his own wonderful way in tragedies and comedies, which,\r\nwhile often professedly treating of very different times and countries,\r\nhave really given us some of the most faithful pictures of the country\r\nlife of the Englishman of Queen Elizabeth's time, drawn with all the\r\nfreshness and simplicity that can only come from a real love of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Flowers I noted,\" is his own account of himself (Sonnet xcix.), and\r\nwith what love he noted them, and with what carefulness and faithfulness\r\nhe wrote of them, is shown in every play he published, and almost in\r\nevery act and every scene. And what I said of his notices of particular\r\nflowers is still more true of his general descriptions--that they are\r\nnever laboured, or introduced as for a purpose, but that each passage is\r\nthe simple utterance of his ingrained love of the country, the natural\r\noutcome of a keen, observant eye, joined to a great power of faithful\r\ndescription, and an unlimited command of the fittest language. It is\r\nthis vividness and freshness that gives such a reality to all\r\nShakespeare's notices of country life, and which make them such pleasant\r\nreading to all lovers of plants and gardening.\r\n\r\nThese notices of the \"Garden-craft of Shakespeare\" I now proceed to\r\nquote; but my quotations in this part will be made on a different plan\r\nto that which I adopted in the account of his \"Plant-lore.\" I shall not\r\nhere think it necessary to quote all the passages in which he mentions\r\ndifferent objects of country life, but I shall content myself with such\r\npassages as throw light on his knowledge of horticulture, and which to\r\nsome extent illustrate the horticulture of his day, and these passages I\r\nmust arrange under a few general heads. In this way the second part of\r\nmy subject will be very much shorter than my first, but I have good\r\nreasons for hoping that those who have been interested in the long\r\naccount of the \"Plant-lore of Shakespeare\" will be equally interested in\r\nthe shorter account of his \"Garden-craft,\" and will acknowledge that the\r\none would be incomplete without the other.

True, our conservatories are full of the choicest plants from\r\nevery clime: we ripen the Grape and the Pine-apple with an art unknown\r\nbefore, and even the Mango, the Mangosteen, and the Guava are made to\r\nyield their matured fruits; but the real beauty and poetry of a garden\r\nare lost in our efforts after rarity, and strangeness, and variety.\" So,\r\nnearly forty years ago, wrote the author of \"The Poetry of Gardening,\" a\r\npleasant, though somewhat fantastic essay, first published in the\r\n\"Carthusian,\" and afterwards re-published in Murray's \"Reading for the\r\nRail,\" in company with an excellent article from the \"Quarterly\" by the\r\nsame author under the title of \"The Flower Garden;\" and I quote it\r\nbecause this \"vain assumption\" is probably stronger and more widespread\r\nnow than when that article was written. We often hear and read accounts\r\nof modern gardening in which it is coolly assumed, and almost taken for\r\ngranted, that the science of horticulture, and almost the love of\r\nflowers, is a product of the nineteenth century. But the love of flowers\r\nis no new taste in Englishmen, and the science of horticulture is in no\r\nway a modern science. We have made large progress in botanical science\r\nduring the present century, and our easy communications with the whole\r\nhabitable globe have brought to us thousands of new and beautiful plants\r\nin endless varieties; and we have many helps in gardening that were\r\nquite unknown to our forefathers. Yet there were brave old gardeners in\r\nour forefathers' times, and a very little acquaintance with the\r\nliterature of the sixteenth century will show that in Shakespeare's time\r\nthere was a most healthy and manly love of flowers for their own sake,\r\nand great industry and much practical skill in gardening. We might,\r\nindeed, go much further back than the fifteenth century, and still find\r\nthe same love and the same skill. We have long lists of plants grown in\r\ntimes before the Conquest, with treatises on gardening, in which there\r\nis much that is absurd, but which show a practical experience in the\r\nart, and which show also that the gardens of those days were by no means\r\nill-furnished either with fruit or flowers. Coming a little later,\r\nChaucer takes every opportunity to speak with a most loving affection\r\nfor flowers, both wild and cultivated, and for well-kept gardens; and\r\nSpenser's poems show a familiar acquaintance with them, and a warm\r\nadmiration for them. Then in Shakespeare's time we have full records of\r\nthe gardens and gardening which must have often met his eye; and we find\r\nthat they were not confined to a few fine places here and there, but\r\nthat good gardens were the necessary adjunct to every country house, and\r\nthat they were cultivated with a zeal and a skill that would be a credit\r\nto any gardener of our own day. In Harrison's description of \"England in\r\nShakespeare's Youth,\" recently published by the new Shakespeare Society,\r\nwe find that Harrison himself, though only a poor country parson, \"took\r\npains with his garden, in which, though its area covered but 300ft. of\r\nground, there was 'a simple' for each foot of ground, no one of them\r\nbeing common or usually to be had.\" About the same time Gerard's\r\nCatalogues show that he grew in his London garden more than a thousand\r\nspecies of hardy plants; and Lord Bacon's famous \"Essay on Gardens\" not\r\nonly shows what a grand idea of gardening he had himself, but also that\r\nthis idea was not Utopian, but one that sprang from personal\r\nacquaintance with stately gardens, and from an innate love of gardens\r\nand flowers. Almost at the same time, but a little later, we come to the\r\ncelebrated \"John Parkinson, Apothecary of London, the King's Herbarist,\"\r\nwhose \"Paradisus Terrestris,\" first published in 1629, is indeed \"a\r\nchoise garden of all sorts of rarest flowers.\" His collection of plants\r\nwould even now be considered an excellent collection, if it could be\r\nbrought together, while his descriptions and cultural advice show him to\r\nhave been a thorough practical gardener, who spoke of plants and gardens\r\nfrom the experience of long-continued hard work amongst them. And\r\ncontemporary with him was Milton, whose numerous descriptions of flowers\r\nare nearly all of cultivated plants, as he must have often seen them in\r\nEnglish gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd so we are brought to the conclusion that in the passages quoted\r\nabove in which Shakespeare speaks so lovingly and tenderly of his\r\nfavourite flowers, these expressions are not to be put down to the fancy\r\nof the poet, but that he was faithfully describing what he daily saw or\r\nmight have seen, and what no doubt he watched with that carefulness and\r\nexactness which could only exist in conjunction with a real affection\r\nfor the objects on which he gazed, \"the fresh and fragrant flowers,\"\r\n\"the pretty flow'rets,\" \"the sweet flowers,\" \"the beauteous flowers,\"\r\n\"the sweet summer buds,\" \"the blossoms passing fair,\" \"the darling buds\r\nof May.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--GARDENS.\r\n\r\n     (1) _King_ (reads).\r\n\r\n     It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner\r\n       of thy curious-knotted Garden.\r\n\r\n                       _Loves Labour's Lost_, act i, sc. 1 (248).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Isabella._\r\n\r\n     He hath a Garden circummured with brick,\r\n     Whose western side is with a Vineyard back'd;\r\n     And to that Vineyard is a planched gate\r\n     That makes his opening with this bigger key:\r\n     The other doth command a little door\r\n     Which from the Vineyard to the garden leads.\r\n\r\n                       _Measure for Measure_, act iv, sc. 1 (28).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (3) _Antonio._\r\n\r\n     The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached\r\n       alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of\r\n       mine.\r\n\r\n                      _Much Ado About Nothing_, act i, sc. 2 (9).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (4) _Iago._\r\n\r\n     Our bodies are our Gardens, &c.\r\n\r\n                   (_See_ HYSSOP.) _Othello_, act i, sc. 3 (323).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (5) _1st Servant._\r\n\r\n     Why should we, in the compass of a pale,\r\n     Keep law and form and due proportion,\r\n     Showing as in a model our firm estate,\r\n     When our sea-walled Garden, the whole land,\r\n     Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,\r\n     Her fruit-trees all unpruned, her hedges ruin'd,\r\n     Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs\r\n     Swarming with caterpillars?\r\n\r\n                               _Richard II_, act iii, sc. 4 (40).\r\n\r\nThe flower-gardens of Shakespeare's time were very different to the\r\nflower-gardens of our day; but we have so many good descriptions of them\r\nin books and pictures that we have no difficulty in realizing them both\r\nin their general form and arrangement. I am now speaking only of the\r\nflower-gardens; the kitchen-gardens and orchards were very much like our\r\nown, except in the one important difference, that they had necessarily\r\nmuch less glass than our modern gardens can command. In the\r\nflower-garden the grand leading principle was uniformity and formality\r\ncarried out into very minute details. \"The garden is best to be square,\"\r\nwas Lord Bacon's rule; \"the form that men like in general is a square,\r\nthough roundness be _forma perfectissima_,\" was Lawson's rule; and this\r\nform was chosen because the garden was considered to be a purtenance and\r\ncontinuation of the house, designed so as strictly to harmonize with the\r\narchitecture of the building. And Parkinson's advice was to the same\r\neffect: \"The orbicular or round form is held in its own proper existence\r\nto be the most absolute form, containing within it all other forms\r\nwhatsoever; but few, I think, will chuse such a proportion to be joyned\r\nto their habitation. The triangular or three-square form is such a form\r\nalso as is seldom chosen by any that may make another choise. The\r\nfour-square form is the most usually accepted with all, and doth best\r\nagree with any man's dwelling.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the shape of the ideal garden--\r\n\r\n     \"And whan I had a while goon,\r\n      I saugh a gardyn right anoon,\r\n      Full long and broad; and every delle\r\n      Enclosed was, and walled welle\r\n      With high walles embatailled.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      I felle fast in a waymenting\r\n      By which art, or by what engyne\r\n      I might come into that gardyne;\r\n      But way I couthe fynd noon\r\n      Into that gardyne for to goon.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Tho' gan I go a fulle grete pas,\r\n      Environyng evene in compas,\r\n      The closing of the square walle,\r\n      Tyl that I fonde a wiket smalle\r\n      So shett that I ne'er myght in gon,\r\n      And other entre was ther noon.\"\r\n\r\n                                           _Romaunt of the Rose._\r\n\r\nThis square enclosure was bounded either by a high wall--\"circummured\r\nwith brick,\" \"with high walles embatailled,\"--or with a thick high\r\nhedge--\"encompassed on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge.\"\r\nThese hedges were made chiefly of Holly or Hornbeam, and we can judge of\r\ntheir size by Evelyn's description of his \"impregnable hedge of about\r\n400ft. in length, 9ft. high, and 5ft. in diameter.\" Many of these hedges\r\nstill remain in our old gardens. Within this enclosure the garden was\r\naccurately laid out in formal shapes,[343:1] with paths either quite\r\nstraight or in some strictly mathematical figures--\r\n\r\n     \"And all without were walkes and alleyes dight\r\n      With divers trees enrang'd in even rankes;\r\n      And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,\r\n      And shadie seats, and sundry flowring bankes,\r\n      To sit and rest the walkers' wearie shankes.\"\r\n\r\n                                              _F. Q._, iv, x, 25.\r\n\r\nThe main walks were not, as with us, bounded with the turf, but they\r\nwere bounded with trees, which were wrought into hedges, more or less\r\nopen at the sides, and arched over at the top. These formed the \"close\r\nalleys,\" \"coven alleys,\" or \"thick-pleached alleys,\" of which we read in\r\nShakespeare and others writers of that time. Many kinds of trees and\r\nshrubs were used for this purpose; \"every one taketh what liketh him\r\nbest, as either Privit alone, or Sweet Bryer and White Thorn interlaced\r\ntogether, and Roses of one, two, or more sorts placed here and there\r\namongst them. Some also take Lavender, Rosemary, Sage, Southernwood,\r\nLavender Cotton, or some such other thing. Some again plant Cornel\r\ntrees, and plash them or keep them low to form them into a hedge; and\r\nsome again take a low prickly shrub that abideth always green, called in\r\nLatin Pyracantha\" (Parkinson). It was on these hedges and their adjuncts\r\nthat the chief labour of the garden was spent. They were cut and\r\ntortured into every imaginable shape, for nothing came amiss to the\r\nfancy of the topiarist. When this topiary art first came into fashion in\r\nEngland I do not know, but it was probably more or less the fashion in\r\nall gardens of any pretence from very early times, and it reached its\r\nhighest point in the sixteenth century, and held its ground as the\r\nperfection of gardening till it was driven out of the field in the last\r\ncentury by the \"picturesque style,\" though many specimens still remain\r\nin England, as at Levens[344:1] and Hardwicke on a large scale, and in\r\nthe gardens of many ancient English mansions and old farmhouses on a\r\nsmaller scale. It was doomed as soon as landscape gardeners aimed at the\r\nnatural, for even when it was still at its height Addison described it\r\nthus: \"Our British gardeners, instead of humouring Nature, love to\r\ndeviate from it as much as possible. Our trees rise in cones, globes,\r\nand pyramids; we see the mark of the scissors upon every plant and\r\nbush.\"\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression: I must return to the Elizabethan garden, which\r\nI have hitherto only described as a great square, surrounded by wide,\r\ncovered, shady walks, and with other similar walks dividing the central\r\nsquare into four or more compartments. But all this was introductory to\r\nthe great feature of the Elizabethan garden, the formation of the\r\n\"curious-knotted garden.\" Each of the large compartments was divided\r\ninto a complication of \"knots,\" by which was meant beds arranged in\r\nquaint patterns, formed by rule and compass with mathematical precision,\r\nand so numerous that it was a necessary part of the system that the\r\nwhole square should be fully occupied by them. Lawn there was none; the\r\nwhole area was nothing but the beds and the paths that divided them.\r\nThere was Grass in other parts of the pleasure grounds, and apparently\r\nwell kept, for Lord Bacon has given his opinion that \"nothing is more\r\npleasant to the eye than green Grass kept finely shorn,\" but it was\r\napparently to be found only in the orchard, the bowling-green, or the\r\n\"wilderness;\" in the flower-garden proper it had no place. The \"knots\"\r\nwere generally raised above the surface of the paths, the earth being\r\nkept in its place by borders of lead, or tiles, or wood, or even bones;\r\nbut sometimes the beds and paths were on the same level, and then there\r\nwere the same edgings that we now use, as Thrift, Box, Ivy, flints, &c.\r\nThe paths were made of gravel, sand, spar, &c., and sometimes with\r\ncoloured earths: but against this Lord Bacon made a vigorous protest:\r\n\"As to the making of knots or figures with divers coloured earths, that\r\nthey may lie under the windows of the house on that side on which the\r\ngarden stands they be but toys; you may see as good sights many times in\r\ntarts.\"\r\n\r\nThe old gardening books are full of designs for these knots; indeed, no\r\ngardening book of the date seems to have been considered complete if it\r\ndid not give the \"latest designs,\" and they seem to have much tried the\r\nwit and ingenuity of the gardeners, as they must have also sorely tried\r\ntheir patience to keep them in order; and I doubt not that the\r\nefficiency of an Elizabethan gardener was as much tested by his skill\r\nand experience in \"knot-work,\" as the efficiency of a modern gardener is\r\ntested by his skill in \"bedding-out,\" which is the lineal descendant of\r\n\"knot-work.\" In one most essential point, however, the two systems very\r\nmuch differed. In \"bedding-out\" the whole force of the system is spent\r\nin producing masses of colours, the individual flowers being of no\r\nimportance, except so far as each flower contributes its little share of\r\ncolour to the general mass; and it is for this reason that so many of us\r\ndislike the system, not only because of its monotony, but more\r\nespecially because it has a tendency \"to teach us to think too little\r\nabout the plants individually, and to look at them chiefly as an\r\nassemblage of beautiful colours. It is difficult in those blooming\r\nmasses to separate one from another; all produce so much the same sort\r\nof impression. The consequence is people see the flowers on the beds\r\nwithout caring to know anything about them or even to ask their names.\r\nIt was different in the older gardens, because there was just variety\r\nthere; the plants strongly contrasted with each other, and we were ever\r\npassing from the beautiful to the curious. Now we get little of\r\nquaintness or mystery, or of the strange delicious thought of being lost\r\nor embosomed in a tall rich wood of flowers. All is clear, definite, and\r\nclassical, the work of a too narrow and exclusive taste.\"--FORBES\r\nWATSON. The old \"knot-work\" was not open to this censure, though no\r\ndoubt it led the way which ended in \"bedding-out.\" The beginning of the\r\nsystem crept in very shortly after Shakespeare's time. Parkinson spoke\r\nof an arrangement of spring flowers which, when \"all planted in some\r\nproportion as near one unto another as is fit for them will give such a\r\ngrace to the garden that the place will seem like a piece of tapestry of\r\nmany glorious colours, to encrease every one's delight.\" And again--\"The\r\nTulipas may be so matched, one colour answering and setting off another,\r\nthat the place where they stand may resemble a piece of curious\r\nneedlework or piece of painting.\" But these plants were all perennial,\r\nand remained where they were once planted, and with this one exception\r\nnamed by Parkinson, the planting of knot-work was as different as\r\npossible from the modern planting of carpet-beds. The beds were planted\r\ninside their thick margins with a great variety of plants, and\r\napparently set as thick as possible, like Harrison's garden quoted\r\nabove, with its 300 separate plants in as many square feet. These were\r\nnearly all hardy perennials,[347:1] with the addition of a few hardy\r\nannuals, and the great object seems to have been to have had something\r\nof interest or beauty in these gardens at all times of the year. The\r\nprinciple of the old gardeners was that \"Nature abhors a vacuum,\" and,\r\nas far as their gardens went, they did their best to prevent a vacuum\r\noccurring at any time. In this way I think they surpassed us in their\r\npractical gardening, for, even if they did not always succeed, it was\r\nsurely something for them to aim (in Lord Bacon's happy words), \"to have\r\n_ver perpetuum_ as the place affords.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the space would allow of it, the garden was further decorated with\r\nstatues, fountains, \"fair mounts,\" labyrinths, mazes,[347:2] arbours and\r\nalcoves, rocks, \"great Turkey jars,\" and \"in some corner (or more) a\r\ntrue Dial or Clock, and some Antick works\" (Lawson). These things were\r\nfitting ornaments in such formal gardens, but the best judges saw that\r\nthey were not necessaries, and that the garden was complete without\r\nthem. \"They be pretty things to look on, but nothing for health or\r\nsweetness.\" \"Such things are for state and magnificence, but nothing to\r\nthe true pleasure of a garden.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the Elizabethan garden in its general outlines; the sort of\r\ngarden which Shakespeare must have often seen both in Warwickshire and\r\nin London. According to our present ideas such a garden would be far too\r\nformal and artificial, and we may consider that the present fashion of\r\nour gardens is more according to Milton's idea of Eden, in which there\r\ngrew--\r\n\r\n     \"Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice art\r\n      In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon\r\n      Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine.\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Paradise Lost_, book iv.\r\n\r\nNone of us probably would now wish to exchange the straight walks and\r\nlevel terraces of the sixteenth century for our winding walks and\r\nundulating lawns, in the laying out of which the motto has been \"ars est\r\ncelare artem\"--\r\n\r\n     \"That which all faire workes doth most aggrace,\r\n      The art, which all that wrought, appeareth in no place.\"\r\n\r\n                                            _F. Q._, ii, xii, 58.\r\n\r\nYet it is pleasant to look back upon these old gardens, and to see how\r\nthey were cherished and beloved by some of the greatest and noblest of\r\nEnglishmen. Spenser has left on record his judgment on the gardens of\r\nhis day--\r\n\r\n     \"To the gay gardens his unstaid desire\r\n      Him wholly carried, to refresh his sprights;\r\n      There lavish Nature, in her best attire,\r\n      Poures forth sweete odors and alluring sights:\r\n      And Arte, with her contending, doth aspire\r\n      To excell the naturall with made delights;\r\n      And all, that faire or pleasant may be found,\r\n      In riotous excesse doth there abound.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      There he arriving around about doth flie,\r\n      From bed to bed, from one to other border;\r\n      And takes survey, with curious busie eye,\r\n      Of every flowre and herbe there set in order.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    _Muiopotmos._\r\n\r\nClearly in Spenser's eyes the formalities of an Elizabethan garden (for\r\nwe must suppose he had such in his thoughts) did not exclude nature or\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nIt was also with such formal gardens in his mind and before his eyes\r\nthat Lord Bacon wrote his \"Essay on Gardens,\" and commenced it with the\r\nwell-known sentence (for I must quote him once again for the last time),\r\n\"God Almighty first planted a garden, and indeed it is the purest of all\r\nhuman pleasures; it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man,\r\nwithout which buildings and palaces are but gross handiworks; and a man\r\nshall ever see, that when ages grow to civility and elegance, men come\r\nto build stately sooner than to garden finely, as if gardening were the\r\ngreater perfection.\" And, indeed, in spite of their stiffness and\r\nunnaturalness, there must have been a great charm in those gardens, and\r\nthough it would be antiquarian affectation to attempt or wish to\r\nrestore them, yet there must have been a stateliness about them which\r\nour gardens have not, and they must have had many points of real comfort\r\nwhich it seems a pity to have lost. Those long shady \"covert alleys,\"\r\nwith their \"thick-pleached\" sides and roof, must have been very pleasant\r\nplaces to walk in, giving shelter in winter, and in summer deep shade,\r\nwith the pleasant smell of Sweet Brier and Roses. They must have been\r\nthe very places for a thoughtful student, who desired quiet and\r\nretirement for his thoughts--\r\n\r\n     \"And adde to these retired leisure\r\n      That in trim gardens takes his pleasure\"--\r\n\r\n                                                  _Il Penseroso._\r\n\r\nand they must have been also \"pretty retiring places for conference\" for\r\nfriends in council. The whole fashion of the Elizabethan garden has\r\npassed away, and will probably never be revived; but before we condemn\r\nit as a ridiculous fashion, unworthy of the science of gardening, we may\r\nremember that it held its ground in England for nearly two hundred\r\nyears, and that during that time the gardens of England and the flowers\r\nthey bore won not the cold admiration, but the warm affection of the\r\ngreatest names in English history, the affection of such a queen as\r\nElizabeth,[349:1] of such a grave and wise philosopher as Bacon, of such\r\na grand hero as Raleigh, of such poets as Spenser and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[343:1] These beds (as we should now call them) were called \"tables\" or\r\n\"plots\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Mark out the tables, ichon by hem selve\r\n      Sixe foote in brede, and xii in length is beste\r\n      To clense and make on evey side honest.\"\r\n\r\n                               _Palladius on Husbandrie_, i. 116.\r\n\r\n\"Note this generally that all plots are square.\"--LAWSON'S _New\r\nOrchard_, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[344:1] For an account of Levens, with a plate of the Topiarian garden,\r\nsee \"Archæological Journal,\" vol. xxvi.\r\n\r\n[347:1] Including shrubs--\r\n\r\n                            \"'Tis another's lot\r\n     To light upon some gard'ner's curious knot,\r\n     Where she upon her breast (love's sweet repose),\r\n     Doth bring the Queen of flowers, the English Rose.\"\r\n\r\n                                    BROWNE'S _Brit.

There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners,\r\n       ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam's profession.\r\n\r\n                                     _Hamlet_, act v, sc. 1 (34).\r\n\r\nVery little is recorded of the gardeners of the sixteenth century, by\r\nwhich we can judge either of their skill or their social position.\r\nGerard frequently mentions the names of different persons from whom he\r\nobtained plants, but without telling us whether they were professional\r\nor amateur gardeners or nurserymen; and Hakluyt has recorded the name of\r\nMaster Wolfe as gardener to Henry VIII. Certainly Richard II.'s Queen\r\ndid not speak with much respect to her gardener, reproving him for his\r\n\"harsh rude tongue,\" and addressing him as a \"little better thing than\r\nearth\"--but her angry grief may account for that. Parkinson also has not\r\nmuch to say in favour of the gardeners of his day, but considers it his\r\nduty to warn his readers against them: \"Our English gardeners are all,\r\nor the most of them, utterly ignorant in the ordering of their\r\noutlandish (_i.e._, exotic) flowers as not being trained to know\r\nthem. . . . And I do wish all gentlemen and gentlewomen, whom it may\r\nconcern for their own good, to be as careful whom they trust with the\r\nplanting and replanting of their fine flowers, as they would be with so\r\nmany jewels, for the roots of many of them being small and of great\r\nvalue may soon be conveyed away, and a clean tale fair told, that such a\r\nroot is rotten or perished in the ground if none be seen where it should\r\nbe, or else that the flower hath changed his colour when it hath been\r\ntaken away, or a counterfeit one hath been put in the place thereof; and\r\nthus many have been deceived of their daintiest flowers, without remedy\r\nor true knowledge of the defect.\" And again, \"idle and ignorant\r\ngardeners who get names by stealth as they do many other things.\" This\r\nis not a pleasant picture either of the skill or honesty of the\r\nsixteenth-century gardeners, but there must have been skilled gardeners\r\nto keep those curious-knotted gardens in order, so as to have a \"_ver\r\nperpetuum_ all the year.\" And there must have been men also who had a\r\nlove for their craft; and if some stole the rare plants committed to\r\ntheir charge, we must hope that there were some honest men amongst them,\r\nand that they were not all like old Andrew Fairservice, in \"Rob Roy,\"\r\nwho wished to find a place where he \"wad hear pure doctrine, and hae a\r\nfree cow's grass, and a cot and a yard, and mair than ten punds of\r\nannual fee,\" but added also, \"and where there's nae leddy about the town\r\nto count the Apples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--GARDENING OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. PRUNING, ETC.\r\n\r\n     (1) _Orlando._\r\n\r\n     But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,\r\n     That cannot so much as a blossom yield\r\n     In lieu of all thy pains and industry.\r\n\r\n                            _As you Like It_, act ii, sc. 3 (63).\r\n\r\n\r\n     (2) _Gardener._\r\n\r\n     Go, bind thou up yon dangling Apricocks,\r\n     Which, like unruly children, make their sire\r\n     Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:\r\n     Give some supportance to the bending twigs.\r\n     Go thou, and like an executioner,\r\n     Cut off the heads of too-fast growing sprays,\r\n     That look too lofty in our commonwealth:\r\n     All must be even in our government.\r\n     You thus employ'd, I would go root away\r\n     The noisome weeds, which without profit suck\r\n     The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   O, what pity is it,\r\n     That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land\r\n     As we this garden! We at time of year\r\n     Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,\r\n     Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,\r\n     With too much riches it confound itself:\r\n     Had he done so to great and growing men,\r\n     They might have lived to bear and he to taste\r\n     Their fruits of duty; superfluous branches\r\n     We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:\r\n     Had he done so, himself had borne the crown\r\n     Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.\r\n\r\n                               _Richard II_, act iii, sc. 4 (29).\r\n\r\nThis most interesting passage would almost tempt us to say that\r\nShakespeare was a gardener by profession; certainly no other passages\r\nthat have been brought to prove his real profession are more minute than\r\nthis. It proves him to have had practical experience in the work, and I\r\nthink we may safely say that he was no mere 'prentice hand in the use of\r\nthe pruning knife.\r\n\r\nThe art of pruning in his day was probably exactly like our own, as far\r\nas regarded fruit trees and ordinary garden work, but in one important\r\nparticular the pruner's art of that day was a for more laborious art\r\nthan it is now. The topiary art must have been the triumph of pruning,\r\nand when gardens were full of castles, monsters, beasts, birds, fishes,\r\nand men, all cut out of Box and Yew, and kept so exact that they boasted\r\nof being the \"living representations\" and \"counterfeit presentments\" of\r\nthese various objects, the hands and head of the pruner could seldom\r\nhave been idle; the pruning knife and scissors must have been in\r\nconstant demand from the first day of the year to the last. The pruner\r\nof that day was, in fact, a sculptor, who carved his images out of Box\r\nand Yew instead of marble, so that in an amusing article in the\r\n\"Guardian\" for 1713 (No. 173), said to have been written by Pope, is a\r\nlist of such sculptured objects for sale, and we are told that the\r\n\"eminent town gardener had arrived to such perfection that he cuts\r\nfamily pieces of men, women, and children. Any ladies that please may\r\nhave their own effigies in Myrtle, or their husbands in Hornbeam. He is\r\na Puritan wag, and never fails when he shows his garden to repeat that\r\npassage in the Psalms, 'Thy wife shall be as the fruitful Vine, and thy\r\nchildren as Olive branches about thy table.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nB. MANURING, ETC.\r\n\r\n     _Constable._\r\n\r\n     And you shall find his vanities forespent\r\n     Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,\r\n     Covering discretion with a coat of folly;\r\n     As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots\r\n     That shall first spring and be most delicate.\r\n\r\n                                   _Henry V_, act ii, sc. 4 (36).\r\n\r\nThe only point that needs notice under this head is that the word\r\n\"manure\" in Shakespeare's time was not limited to its present modern\r\nmeaning. In his day \"manured land\" generally meant cultured land in\r\nopposition to wild and barren land.[353:1] So Falstaff uses the word--\r\n\r\n     Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold\r\n       blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like\r\n       lean, sterile and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled\r\n       with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of\r\n       fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant.\r\n\r\n                             _2nd Henry IV_, act iv, sc. 3 (126).\r\n\r\nAnd in the same way Iago says--\r\n\r\n     Either to have it (a garden) sterile with idleness or manured\r\n       with industry.\r\n\r\n                                   _Othello_, act i, sc. 3 (296).\r\n\r\nMilton and many other writers used the word in this its original sense;\r\nand Johnson explains it \"to cultivate by manual labour,\" according to\r\nits literal derivation.

You see, sweet maid, we marry\r\n     A gentle scion to the wildest stock,\r\n     And make conceive a bark of baser kind\r\n     By bud of nobler race: this is an art\r\n     Which does mend nature, change it rather, but\r\n     The art itself is nature.\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._\r\n\r\n                               So it is.\r\n\r\n     _Polixenes._\r\n\r\n     Then make your garden rich in Gillyvors,\r\n     And do not call them bastards.\r\n\r\n     _Perdita._\r\n\r\n                                    I'll not put\r\n     The dibble in the earth to set one slip of them.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter's Tale_, act iv, sc. 4 (81).\r\n\r\nThe various ways of propagating plants by grafts, cuttings, slips, and\r\nartificial impregnation (all mentioned in the above passages), as used\r\nin Shakespeare's day, seem to have been exactly like those of our own\r\ntime, and so they need no further comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[353:1] The Act 31 Eliz. c. 7, enacts that \"noe person shall within this\r\nRealme of England make buylde or erect any Buyldinge or Howsinge . . . .\r\nas a Cottage for habitation . . . . unlesse the same person do assigne\r\nand laye to the same Cottage or Buyldinge fower acres of Grounde at the\r\nleast . . . to be contynuallie occupied and manured therewith.\" Gerard's\r\nChapter on Vines is headed, \"Of the manured Vine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--GARDEN ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

for my object was in no case to give an exhaustive account of the\r\nflowers, but only to give such an account of each plant as might\r\nillustrate its special use by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nHaving often quoted my favourite authority in gardening matters, old\r\n\"John Parkinson, Apothecary, of London,\" I will again make use of him to\r\nhelp me to say my last words: \"Herein I have spent my time, pains, and\r\ncharge, which, if well accepted, I shall think well employed. And thus I\r\nhave finished this work, and have furnished it with whatsoever could\r\nbring delight to those that take pleasure in those things, which how\r\nwell or ill done I must abide every one's censure; the judicious and\r\ncourteous I only respect; and so Farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[357:1]\r\n\r\n                    \"Flowers depart\r\n     To see their mother-root, when they have blown;\r\n               Where they together,\r\n               All the hard weather\r\n     Dead to the world, keep house unknown.\"\r\n\r\n                                        G.

It was then published in \"The Garden,\" and a few copies were\r\nreprinted for private circulation. I now publish it as an Appendix to\r\nthe \"Plant-lore of Shakespeare,\" with very few alterations from its\r\noriginal form, preferring thus to reprint it _in extenso_ than to make\r\nan abstract of it for the illustration of Shakespeare's Daisies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAISY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI almost feel that I ought to apologize to the Field Club for asking\r\nthem to listen to a paper on so small a subject as the Daisy. But,\r\nindeed, I have selected that subject because I think it is one\r\nespecially suited to a Naturalists' Field Club. The members of such a\r\nclub, as I think, should take notice of everything. Nothing should be\r\nbeneath their notice. It should be their province to note a multitude of\r\nlittle facts unnoticed by others; they should be \"minute philosophers,\"\r\nand they might almost take as their motto the wise words which Milton\r\nput into the mouth of Adam, after he had been instructed to \"be lowlie\r\nwise\" (especially in the study of the endless wonders of sea, and earth,\r\nand sky that surrounded him)--\r\n\r\n                                 \"To know\r\n     That which before us lies in daily life,\r\n     Is the prime wisdom.\"--_Paradise Lost_, viii. (192).\r\n\r\nI do not apologize for the lowness and humbleness of my subject, but,\r\nwith \"no delay of preface\" (Milton), I take you at once to it. In\r\nspeaking of the Daisy, I mean to confine myself to the Daisy, commonly\r\nso-called, merely reminding you that there are also the Great or Ox-eye,\r\nor Moon Daisy (_Chrysanthemum leucanthemum_), the Michaelmas Daisy\r\n(_Aster_), and the Blue Daisy of the South of Europe (_Globularia_).\r\nThe name has been also given to a few other plants, but none of them are\r\ntrue Daisies.\r\n\r\nI begin with its name. Of this there can be little doubt; it is the\r\n\"Day's-eye,\" the bright little eye that only opens by day, and goes to\r\nsleep at night. This, whether the true derivation or not, is no modern\r\nfancy. It is, at least, as old as Chaucer, and probably much older. Here\r\nare Chaucer's well-known words--\r\n\r\n        \"Men by reason well it calle may\r\n     The Daïsie, or else the Eye of Day,\r\n     The Empresse and the flowre of flowres all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ben Jonson boldly spoke of them as \"bright Daye's-eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another derivation. Dr. Prior says: \"Skinner derives\r\nit from dais or canopy, and Gavin Douglas seems to have understood it in\r\nthe sense of a small canopy in the line:\r\n\r\n     \"The Daisie did unbraid her crounall small.\r\n\r\n\"Had we not the A.-S. dæges-eage, we could hardly refuse to admit that\r\nthis last is a far more obvious and probable explanation of the word\r\nthan the pretty poetical thought conveyed in Day's-eye.\" This was Dr.\r\nPrior's opinion in his first edition of his valuable \"Popular Names of\r\nBritish Plants;\" but it is withdrawn in his second edition, and he now\r\nis content with the Day's-eye derivation. Dr. Prior has kindly informed\r\nme that he rejected it because he can find no old authority for\r\nSkinner's derivation, and because it is doubtful whether the Daisy in\r\nGavin Douglas's line does not mean a Marigold, and not what we call a\r\nDaisy. The derivation, however, seemed worth a passing notice. Its other\r\nEnglish names are Dog Daisy, to distinguish it from the large Ox-eyed\r\nDaisy; Banwort, \"because it helpeth bones[362:1] to knit agayne\"\r\n(Turner); Bruisewort, for the same reason; Herb Margaret, from its\r\nFrench name; and in the North, Bairnwort, from its associations with\r\nchildhood. As to its other names, the plant seems to have been unknown\r\nto the Greeks, and has no Greek name, but is fortunate in having as\r\npretty a name in Latin as it has in English. Its modern botanical name\r\nis Bellis, and it has had the name from the time of Pliny. Bellis must\r\ncertainly come from _bellus_ (pretty), and so it is at once stamped as\r\nthe pretty one even by botanists--though another derivation has been\r\ngiven to the name, of which I will speak soon. The French call it\r\nMarguerite, no doubt for its pearly look, or Pasquerette, to mark it as\r\nthe spring flower; the German name for it is very different, and not\r\neasy to explain--Gänseblume, _i.e._, Goose-flower; the Danish name is\r\nTusinfryd (thousand joys); and the Welsh, Sensigl (trembling star).\r\n\r\nAs Pliny is the first that mentions the plant, his account is worth\r\nquoting. \"As touching a Daisy,\" he says (I quote from Holland's\r\ntranslation, 1601), \"a yellow cup it hath also, and the same is crowned,\r\nas it were, with a garland, consisting of five and fifty little leaves,\r\nset round about it in manner of fine pales. These be flowers of the\r\nmeadow, and most of such are of no use at all, no marvile, therefore, if\r\nthey be namelesse; howbeit, some give them one tearme and some another\"\r\n(book xxi. cap. 8). And again, \"There is a hearbe growing commonly in\r\nmedows, called the Daisie, with a white floure, and partly inclining to\r\nred, which, if it is joined with Mugwort in an ointment, is thought to\r\nmake the medicine farre more effectual for the King's evil\" (book xxvi.\r\ncap. 5).\r\n\r\nWe have no less than three legends of the origin of the flower. In one\r\nlegend, not older, I believe, than the fourteenth century (the legend is\r\ngiven at full length by Chaucer in his \"Legende of Goode Women\"),\r\nAlcestis was turned into a Daisy. Another legend records that \"this\r\nplant is called Bellis, because it owes its origin to Belides, a\r\ngranddaughter to Danaus, and one of the nymphs called Dryads, that\r\npresided over the meadows and pastures in ancient times. Belides is said\r\nto have encouraged the suit of Ephigeus, but whilst dancing on the grass\r\nwith this rural deity she attracted the admiration of Vertumnus, who,\r\njust as he was about to seize her in his embrace, saw her transformed\r\ninto the humble plant that now bears her name.\" This legend I have only\r\nseen in Phillips's \"Flora Historica.\" I need scarcely tell you that\r\nneither Belides or Ephigeus are classical names--they are mediæval\r\ninventions. The next legend is a Celtic one; I find it recorded both by\r\nLady Wilkinson and Mrs. Lankester. I should like to know its origin; but\r\nwith that grand contempt for giving authorities which lady-authors too\r\noften show, neither of these ladies tells us whence she got the legend.\r\nThe legend says that \"the virgins of Morven, to soothe the grief of\r\nMalvina, who had lost her infant son, sang to her, 'We have seen, O!\r\nMalvina, we have seen the infant you regret, reclining on a light mist;\r\nit approached us, and shed on our fields a harvest of new flowers. Look,\r\nO! Malvina. Among these flowers we distinguish one with a golden disk\r\nsurrounded by silver leaves; a sweet tinge of crimson adorns its\r\ndelicate rays; waved by a gentle wind, we might call it a little infant\r\nplaying in a green meadow; and the flower of thy bosom has given a new\r\nflower to the hills of Cromla.'\" Since that day the daughters of Morven\r\nhave consecrated the Daisy to infancy. \"It is,\" said they, \"the flower\r\nof innocence, the flower of the newborn.\" Besides these legends, the\r\nDaisy is also connected with the legendary history of St. Margaret. The\r\nlegend is given by Chaucer, but I will tell it to you in the words of a\r\nmore modern poet--\r\n\r\n     \"There is a double flouret, white and rede,\r\n      That our lasses call Herb Margaret\r\n      In honour of Cortona's penitent;\r\n      Whose contrite soul with red remorse was rent.\r\n      While on her penitence kind Heaven did throwe\r\n      The white of puritie surpassing snowe;\r\n      So white and rede in this faire floure entwine,\r\n      Which maids are wont to scatter on her shrine.\"\r\n\r\n                 _Catholic Florist_, Feb. 22, St. Margaret's Day.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the general association of Daisies with St. Margaret,\r\nMrs. Jameson says that she has seen one, and only one, picture of St.\r\nMargaret with Daisies.\r\n\r\nThe poetry or poetical history of the Daisy is very curious. It begins\r\nwith Chaucer, whose love of the flower might almost be called an\r\nidolatry. But, as it begins with Chaucer, so, for a time, it almost ends\r\nwith him. Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton scarcely mention it. It holds\r\nalmost no place in the poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies; but, at the close of the eighteenth century, it has the good\r\nluck to be uprooted by Burns's plough, and he at once sings its dirge\r\nand its beauties; and then the flower at once becomes a celebrity.\r\nWordsworth sings of it in many a beautiful verse; and I think it is\r\nscarcely too much to say that since his time not an English poet has\r\nfailed to pay his homage to the humble beauty of the Daisy. I do not\r\npurpose to take you through all these poets--time and knowledge would\r\nfail me to introduce you to them all. I shall but select some of those\r\nwhich I consider best worth selection. I begin, of course, with Chaucer,\r\nand even with him I must content myself with a selection--\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the floures in the mede,\r\n      Then love I most those floures white and redde;\r\n      Such that men callen Daisies in our town.\r\n      To them I have so great affection,\r\n      As I said erst when comen is the Maye,\r\n      That in my bedde there dawneth me no daie,\r\n      That I n'am up and walking in the mede\r\n      To see this floure against the sunné sprede.\r\n      When it upriseth early by the morrow,\r\n      That blessed sight softeneth all my sorrow.\r\n      So glad am I, when that I have presence\r\n      Of it, to done it all reverence--\r\n      As she that is of all floures the floure,\r\n      Fulfilled of all virtue and honoure;\r\n      And ever ylike fair and fresh of hue,\r\n      And ever I love it, and ever ylike new,\r\n      And ever shall, till that mine heart die,\r\n      All swear I not, of this I will not lye.\r\n      There loved no wight hotter in his life,\r\n      And when that it is eve, I run blithe,\r\n      As soon as ever the sun gaineth west,\r\n      To see this floure, how it will go to rest.\r\n      For fear of night, so hateth she darkness,\r\n      Her cheer is plainly spread in the brightness\r\n      Of the sunne, for there it will unclose;\r\n      Alas, that I ne had English rhyme or prose\r\n      Suffisaunt this floure to praise aright.\"\r\n\r\nI could give you several other quotations from Chaucer, but I will\r\ncontent myself with this, for I think unbounded admiration of a flower\r\ncan scarcely go further than the lines I have read to you.\r\n\r\nIn an early poem published by Ritson is the following--\r\n\r\n     \"Lenten ys come with love to toune\r\n      With blosmen ant with briddes roune\r\n          That al thys blisse bryngeth;\r\n      Dayeseyes in this dales,\r\n      Notes suete of nyghtegales\r\n          Vch foul song singeth.\"\r\n\r\n                      _Ancient Songs and Ballads_, vol. i, p. 63.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawes, who lived in the time of Henry VII., wrote a poem called\r\nthe \"Temple of Glass.\" In that temple he tells us--\r\n\r\n            \"I saw depycted upon a wall,\r\n     From est to west, fol many a fayre image\r\n     Of sundry lovers.     .     .     .    .\"\r\n\r\nAnd among these lovers--\r\n\r\n     \"And Alder next was the freshe quene,\r\n      I mean Alceste, the noble true wife,\r\n      And for Admete howe she lost her life,\r\n      And for her trouthe, if I shall not lye,\r\n      How she was turned into a Daysye.\"\r\n\r\nWe next come to Spenser. In the \"Muiopotmos,\" he gives a list of flowers\r\nthat the butterfly frequents, with most descriptive epithets to each\r\nflower most happily chosen. Among the flowers are--\r\n\r\n     \"The Roses raigning in the pride of May,\r\n      Sharp Isope good for greene woundes' remedies,\r\n      Faire Marigoldes, and bees-alluring Thyme,\r\n      Sweet Marjoram, and Daysies decking prime.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"decking prime\" he means they are the ornament of the morning.[366:1]\r\nAgain he introduces the Daisy in a stanza of much beauty, that commences\r\nthe June Eclogue of the \"Shepherd's Calendar.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Lo! Colin, here the place whose pleasaunt syte\r\n      From other shades hath weand my wandring minde.\r\n      Tell me, what wants me here to work delyte?\r\n      The simple ayre, the gentle warbling winde,\r\n      So calm, so cool, as no where else I finde;\r\n      The Grassie ground, with daintie Daysies dight;\r\n      The Bramble bush, where byrdes of every kinde\r\n      To the waters' fall their tunes attemper right.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Spenser we come to Shakespeare, and when we remember the vast\r\nacquaintance with flowers of every kind that he shows, and especially\r\nwhen we remember how often he almost seems to go out of his way to tell\r\nof the simple wild flowers of England, it is surprising that the Daisy\r\nis almost passed over entirely by him. Here are the passages in which he\r\nnames the flowers. First, in the poem of the \"Rape of Lucrece,\" he has a\r\nvery pretty picture of Lucrece as she lay asleep--\r\n\r\n     \"Without the bed her other faire hand was\r\n      On the green coverlet, whose perfect white\r\n      Showed like an April Daisy on the Grass.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Love's Labour's Lost\" is the song of Spring, beginning--\r\n\r\n     \"When Daisies pied, and Violets blue;\r\n        And Lady-smocks all silver-white,\r\n      And Cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\r\n        Do paint the meadows with delight.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Hamlet\" Daisies are twice mentioned in connection with Ophelia in\r\nher madness. \"There's a Daisy!\" she said, as she distributed her\r\nflowers; but she made no comment on the Daisy as she did on her other\r\nflowers. And, in the description of her death, the Queen tells us that--\r\n\r\n     \"There with fantastick garlands did she come\r\n      Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daisies, and Long Purples.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in \"Cymbeline\" the General Lucius gives directions for the burial of\r\nCloten--\r\n\r\n                                 \"Let us\r\n     Find out the prettiest Daisied plot we can,\r\n     And make him with our pikes and partisans\r\n     A grave.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the introductory song to the \"Two Noble Kinsmen,\" which is\r\nclaimed by some as Shakespeare's, we find among the other flowers of\r\nspring--\r\n\r\n     \"Daisies smel-lesse, yet most quaint.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the only places in which the Daisy is mentioned in\r\nShakespeare's plays, and it is a little startling to find that of these\r\nsix one is in a song for clowns, and two others are connected with the\r\npoor mad princess. I hope that you will not use Shakespeare's authority\r\nagainst me, that to talk of Daisies is only fit for clowns and madmen.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Shakespeare was Cutwode, who in the \"Caltha Poetarum,\"\r\npublished in 1599, thus describes the Daisy--\r\n\r\n     \"On her attends the Daisie dearly dight\r\n        that pretty Primula of Lady Ver\r\n      As handmaid to her Mistresse day and night\r\n        so doth she watch, so waiteth she on her,\r\n      With double diligence, and dares not stir,\r\n      A fairer flower perfumes not forth in May\r\n      Then is this Daisie or this Primula.\r\n\r\n      About her neck she wears a rich wrought ruffe,\r\n        with double sets most brave and broad bespread,\r\n      Resembling lovely Lawn or Cambrick stuffe\r\n        pind up and prickt upon her yealow head,\r\n      Wearing her haire on both sides of her shead;\r\n      And with her countenance she hath acast\r\n      Wagging the wāton with each wynd and blast.\"\r\n\r\n                                                   Stanza 21, 22.\r\n\r\nDrayton, in the \"Polyolbion,\" 15th Song, represents the Naiads engaged\r\nin twining garlands for the marriage of Tame and Isis, and considering\r\nthat he--\r\n\r\n     \"Should not be dressed with flowers to garden that belong\r\n      (His bride that better fitteth), but only such as spring\r\n      From the replenisht meads and fruitful pasture neere,\"\r\n\r\nthey collect among other wild flowers--\r\n\r\n     \"The Daysie over all those sundry sweets so thick\r\n      As nature doth herself, to imitate her right;\r\n      Who seems in that her pearle so greatly to delight\r\n      That every plaine therewith she powdereth to beholde.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to the same effect, in his \"Description of Elysium\"--\r\n\r\n     \"There Daisies damask every place,\r\n        Nor once their beauties lose,\r\n      That when proud Phœbus turns his face,\r\n        Themselves they scorn to close.\"\r\n\r\nBrowne, contemporary with Shakespeare, has these pretty lines on the\r\nDaisy--\r\n\r\n     \"The Daisy scattered on each mead and down,\r\n      A golden tuft within a silver crown;\r\n      (Fair fall that dainty flower! and may there be\r\n      No shepherd graced that doth not honour thee!).\"\r\n\r\n                                            _Brit. Past._, ii. 3.\r\n\r\nAnd the following must be about the same date--\r\n\r\n     \"The pretty Daisy which doth show\r\n      Her love to Phœbus, bred her woe;\r\n          (Who joys to see his cheareful face,\r\n          And mournes when he is not in place)--\r\n      'Alacke! alacke! alacke!' quoth she,\r\n      'There's none that ever loves like me.'\"\r\n\r\n        _The Deceased Maiden's Lover_--Roxburghe Ballads, i, 341.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised to find that Milton barely mentions the Daisy. His\r\nknowledge of plants was very small compared to Shakespeare's, and seems\r\nto have been, for the most part, derived from books. His descriptions of\r\nplants all savour more of study than the open air. I only know of two\r\nplaces in which he mentions the Daisy. In the \"l'Allegro\" he speaks of\r\n\"Meadows trim with Daisies pied,\" and in another place he speaks of\r\n\"Daisies trim.\" But I am surprised to find the Daisy overlooked by two\r\nsuch poets as Robert Herrick and George Herbert. Herrick sang of flowers\r\nmost sweetly, few if any English poets have sung of them more sweetly,\r\nbut he has little to say of the Daisy. He has one poem, indeed,\r\naddressed specially to a Daisy, but he simply uses the little flower,\r\nand not very successfully, as a peg on which to hang the praises of his\r\nmistress. He uses it more happily in describing the pleasures of a\r\ncountry life--\r\n\r\n     \"Come live with me and thou shalt see\r\n      The pleasures I'll prepare for thee,\r\n      What sweets the country can afford,\r\n      Shall bless thy bed and bless thy board.\r\n      .      .      .  Thou shalt eat\r\n      The paste of Filberts for thy bread,\r\n      With cream of Cowslips buttered;\r\n      Thy feasting tables shall be hills,\r\n      With Daisies spread and Daffodils.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n     \"Young men and maids meet,\r\n      To exercise their dancing feet,\r\n      Tripping the comely country round,\r\n      With Daffodils and Daisies crowned.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert had a deep love for flowers, and a still deeper love for\r\nfinding good Christian lessons in the commonest things about him. He\r\ndelights in being able to say--\r\n\r\n     \"Yet can I mark how herbs below\r\n        Grow green and gay;\"\r\n\r\nbut I believe he never mentions the Daisy.\r\n\r\nOf the poets of the seventeenth century I need only make one short\r\nquotation from Dryden--\r\n\r\n     \"And then the band of flutes began to play,\r\n      To which a lady sang a tirelay:\r\n      And still at every close she would repeat\r\n      The burden of the song--'The Daisy is so sweet,\r\n      The Daisy is so sweet'--when she began\r\n      The troops of knights and dames continued on\r\n      The consort; and the voice so charmed my ear\r\n      And soothed my soul that it was heaven to hear.\"\r\n\r\nI need not dwell on the other poets of the seventeenth century. In most\r\nof them a casual allusion to the Daisy may be found, but little more.\r\nNor need I dwell at all on the poets of the eighteenth century. In the\r\nso-called Augustan age of poetry, the Daisy could not hope to attract\r\nany attention. It was the correct thing if they had to speak of the\r\ncountry to speak of the \"Daisied\" or \"Daisy-spangled\" meads, but they\r\ncould not condescend to any nearer approach to the little flower. If\r\nthey had they would have found that they had chosen their epithet very\r\nbadly. I never yet saw a \"Daisy-spangled\" meadow.[370:1] The flowers may\r\nbe there, but the long Grasses effectually hide them. And so I come _per\r\nsaltum_ to the end of the eighteenth century, and at once to Burns, who\r\nbrought the Daisy again into notice. He thus regrets the uprooting of\r\nthe Daisy by his plough--\r\n\r\n     \"Wee, modest, crimson-tippèd flower,\r\n      Thou'st met me in an evil hour;\r\n      For I must crush amongst the stour\r\n              Thy slender stem.\r\n      To spare thee now is past my power,\r\n              Thou bonny gem.\r\n\r\n      Cold blew the bitter, biting north,\r\n      Upon thy humble birth,\r\n      Yet cheerfully thou venturest forth\r\n              Amid the storm,\r\n      Scarce reared above the Parent-earth\r\n              Thy tender form.\r\n\r\n      The flaunting flowers our gardens yield\r\n      High sheltering woods and walks must shield;\r\n      But thou, between the random bield\r\n              Of clod or stone,\r\n      Adorn'st the rugged stubble field,\r\n              Unseen, alone.\r\n\r\n      There, in thy scanty mantle clad,\r\n      Thy snowy bosom sunward spread,\r\n      Thou lift'st thy unassuming head\r\n              In humble guise;\r\n      But now the share uptears thy bed,\r\n              And low thou lies!\"\r\n\r\nWith Burns we may well join Clare, another peasant poet from\r\nNorthamptonshire, whose poems are not so much known as they deserve to\r\nbe. His allusions to wild flowers always mark his real observation of\r\nthem, and his allusions to the Daisy are frequent; thus--\r\n\r\n     \"Smiling on the sunny plain\r\n        The lovely Daisies blow,\r\n      Unconscious of the careless feet\r\n        That lay their beauties low.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, alluding to his own obscurity--\r\n\r\n     \"Green turfs allowed forgotten heap,\r\n        Is all that I shall have,\r\n      Save that the little Daisies creep\r\n        To deck my humble grave.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in his description of evening, he does not omit to notice the\r\nclosing of the Daisy at sunset--\r\n\r\n     \"Now the blue fog creeps along,\r\n      And the birds forget their song;\r\n      Flowers now sleep within their hoods,\r\n      Daisies button into buds.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to Wordsworth, whose love of the Daisy almost equalled\r\nChaucer's. His allusions and addresses to the Daisy are numerous, but I\r\nhave only space for a small selection. First, are two stanzas from a\r\nlong poem specially to the Daisy--\r\n\r\n     \"When soothed awhile by milder airs,\r\n      Thee Winter in the garland wears,\r\n      That thinly shades his few gray hairs,\r\n          Spring cannot shun thee.\r\n      While Summer fields are thine by right,\r\n      And Autumn, melancholy wight,\r\n      Doth in thy crimson head delight\r\n          When rains are on thee.\r\n\r\n      Child of the year that round dost run\r\n      Thy course, bold lover of the sun,\r\n      And cheerful when thy day's begun\r\n          As morning leveret.\r\n      Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain,\r\n      Dear shalt thou be to future men,\r\n      As in old time, thou not in vain\r\n          Art nature's favourite.\"\r\n\r\nThe other poem from Wordsworth that I shall read to you is one that has\r\nreceived the highest praise from all readers, and by Ruskin (no mean\r\ncritic, and certainly not always given to praises) is described as \"two\r\ndelicious stanzas, followed by one of heavenly imagination.\"[372:1] The\r\npoem is \"An Address to the Daisy\"--\r\n\r\n     \"A nun demure--of holy port;\r\n      A sprightly maiden--of love's court,\r\n      In thy simplicity the sport\r\n          Of all temptations.\r\n      A queen in crown of rubies drest,\r\n      A starveling in a scanty vest,\r\n      Are all, as seems to suit thee best,\r\n          Thy appellations.\r\n\r\n      I see thee glittering from afar,\r\n      And then thou art a pretty star,\r\n      Not quite so fair as many are\r\n          In heaven above thee.\r\n      Yet like a star with glittering crest,\r\n      Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;\r\n      Let peace come never to his rest\r\n          Who shall reprove thee.\r\n\r\n      Sweet flower, for by that name at last,\r\n      When all my reveries are past,\r\n      I call thee, and to that cleave fast.\r\n          Sweet silent creature,\r\n      That breath'st with me in sun and air;\r\n      Do thou, as thou art wont, repair\r\n      My heart with gladness, and a share\r\n          Of thy meek nature.\"\r\n\r\nWith these beautiful lines I might well conclude my notices of the\r\npoetical history of the Daisy, but, to bring it down more closely to our\r\nown times, I will remind you of a poem by Tennyson, entitled \"The\r\nDaisy.\" It is a pleasant description of a southern tour brought to his\r\nmemory by finding a dried Daisy in a book. He says--\r\n\r\n            \"We took our last adieu,\r\n     And up the snowy Splugen drew,\r\n     But ere we reached the highest summit,\r\n     I plucked a Daisy, I gave it you,\r\n     It told of England then to me,\r\n     And now it tells of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThus I have picked several pretty flowers of poetry for you from the\r\ntime of Chaucer to our own. I could have made the posy fifty-fold\r\nlarger, but I could, probably, have found no flowers for the posy more\r\nbeautiful, or more curious, than these few.\r\n\r\nI now come to the botany of the Daisy. The Daisy belongs to the immense\r\nfamily of the Compositæ, a family which contains one-tenth of the\r\nflowering plants of the world, and of which nearly 10,000 species are\r\nrecorded. In England the order is very familiar, as it contains three of\r\nour commonest kinds, the Daisy, the Dandelion, and the Groundsel. It may\r\ngive some idea of the large range of the family when we find that there\r\nare some 600 recorded species of the Groundsel alone, of which eleven\r\nare in England. I shall not weary you with a strictly scientific\r\ndescription of the Daisy, but I will give you instead Rousseau's\r\nwell-known description. It is fairly accurate, though not strictly\r\nscientific: \"Take,\" he says, \"one of those little flowers, which cover\r\nall the pastures, and which every one knows by the name of Daisy. Look\r\nat it well, for I am sure you would never have guessed from its\r\nappearance that this flower, which is so small and delicate, is really\r\ncomposed of between two and three hundred other flowers, all of them\r\nperfect, that is, each of them having its corolla, stamens, pistil, and\r\nfruit; in a word, as perfect in its species as a flower of the Hyacinth\r\nor Lily. Every one of these leaves, which are white above and red\r\nunderneath, and form a kind of crown round the flower, appearing to be\r\nnothing more than little petals, are in reality so many true flowers;\r\nand every one of those tiny yellow things also which you see in the\r\ncentre, and which at first you have perhaps taken for nothing but\r\nstamens, are real flowers. . . . Pull out one of the white leaves of the\r\nflower; you will think at first that it is flat from one end to the\r\nother, but look carefully at the end by which it was fastened to the\r\nflower, and you will see that this end is not flat, but round and hollow\r\nin the form of a tube, and that a little thread ending in two horns\r\nissues from the tube. This thread is the forked style of the flower,\r\nwhich, as you now see, is flat only at top. Next look at the little\r\nyellow things in the middle of the flower, and which, as I have told\r\nyou, are all so many flowers; if the flower is sufficiently advanced,\r\nyou will see some of them open in the middle and even cut into several\r\nparts. These are the monopetalous corollas. . . . . This is enough to\r\nshow you by the eye the possibility that all these small affairs, both\r\nwhite and yellow, may be so many distinct flowers, and this is a\r\nconstant fact\" (Quoted in Lindley's \"Ladies' Botany,\" vol. i.)[374:1]\r\n\r\nBut Rousseau does not mention one feature which I wish to describe to\r\nyou, as I know few points in botany more beautiful than the arrangement\r\nby which the Daisy is fertilized. In the centre of each little flower is\r\nthe style surrounded closely by the anthers. The end of the style is\r\ndivided, but, as long as it remains below among the anthers, the two\r\nlips are closed. The anthers are covered, more or less, with pollen; the\r\nstyle has its outside surface bristling with stiff hairs. In this\r\ncondition it would be impossible for the pollen to reach the interior\r\n(stigmatic) surfaces of the divided style, but the style rises, and as\r\nit rises it brushes off the pollen from the anthers around it. Its lips\r\nare closed till it has risen well above the whole flower, and left the\r\nanthers below; then it opens, showing its broad stigmatic surface to\r\nreceive pollen from other flowers, and distribute the pollen it has\r\nbrushed off, not to itself (which it could not do), but to other flowers\r\naround it. By this provision no flower fertilizes itself, and those of\r\nyou who are acquainted with Darwin's writings will know how necessary\r\nthis provision may be in perpetuating flowers. The Daisy not only\r\nproduces double flowers, but also the curious proliferous flower called\r\nHen and Chickens, or Childing Daisies, or Jackanapes on Horseback. These\r\nare botanically very interesting flowers, and though I, on another\r\noccasion, drew your attention to the peculiarity, I cannot pass it over\r\nin a paper specially devoted to the Daisy. The botanical interest is\r\nthis: It is a well-known fact in botany, that all the parts of a\r\nplant--root, stem, flowers and their parts, thorns, fruits, and even the\r\nseeds, are only different forms of leaves, and are all interchangeable,\r\nand the Hen and Chickens Daisy is a good proof of it. Underneath the\r\nflowerhead of the Daisy is a green cushion, composed of bracts; in the\r\nHen and Chickens Daisy some of these bracts assume the form of flowers,\r\nand are the chickens. If the plant is neglected, or does not like its\r\nsoil, the chickens again become bracts.\r\n\r\nThe only other point in the botany of the Daisy that occurs to me is its\r\ngeographical range. The old books are not far wrong when they say \"it\r\ngroweth everywhere.\" It does not, however, grow in the Tropics. In\r\nEurope it is everywhere, from Iceland to the extreme south, though not\r\nabundant in the south-easterly parts. It is found in North America very\r\nsparingly, and not at all in the United States. It is also by no means\r\nfastidious in its choice of position--by the river-side or on the\r\nmountain-top it seems equally at home, though it somewhat varies\r\naccording to its situation, but its most chosen habitat seems to be a\r\nwell-kept lawn. There it luxuriates, and defies the scythe and the\r\nmowing machine. It has been asserted that it disappears when the ground\r\nis fed by sheep, and again appears when the sheep are removed, but this\r\nrequires confirmation. Yet it does not lend itself readily to gardening\r\npurposes. It is one of those--\r\n\r\n     \"Flowers, worthy of Paradise, which not nice art\r\n      In beds and curious knots, but Nature's boon\r\n      Pour'd forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,\r\n      Both where the morning sun first warmly smote\r\n      The open field, and where the unpierc'd shade\r\n      Imbrown'd the noontide bowers.\"\r\n\r\n                                        _Paradise Lost_, iv, 240.\r\n\r\nUnder cultivation it becomes capricious; the sorts degenerate and\r\nrequire much care to keep them true. As to its time of flowering it is\r\ncommonly considered a spring and summer flower; but I think one of its\r\nchief charms is that there is scarcely a day in the whole year in which\r\nyou might not find a Daisy in flower.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through something of the history, poetry, and botany of\r\nthe Daisy, but there are still some few points which I could not well\r\nrange under either of these three heads, yet which must not be passed\r\nover. In painting, the Daisy was a favourite with the early Italian and\r\nFlemish painters, its bright star coming in very effectively in their\r\nforegrounds. Some of you will recollect that it is largely used in the\r\nforeground of Van Eyck's grand picture of the \"Adoration of the Lamb,\"\r\nnow at St. Bavon's, in Ghent. In sculpture it was not so much used, its\r\nsmall size making it unfit for that purpose. Yet you will sometimes see\r\nit, both in the stone and wood carvings of our old churches. In heraldry\r\nit is not unknown. When Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, was about to\r\nmarry Margaret of Flanders, he instituted an order of Daisies; and in\r\nChifflet's Lilium Francicum (1658) is a plate of his arms, France and\r\nFlanders quarterly surrounded by a collar of Daisies. A family named\r\nDaisy bear three Daisies on their coat of arms. In an old picture of\r\nChaucer, a Daisy takes the place in the corner usually allotted to the\r\ncoat of arms in mediæval paintings. It was assumed as an heraldic\r\ncognizance by St. Louis of France in honour of his wife Margaret; by the\r\ngood Margaret of Valois, Queen of Navarre; by Margaret of Anjou, the\r\nunfortunate wife of our Henry VI.; while our Margaret, Countess of\r\nRichmond, mother of our Henry VII., and dear to Oxford and Cambridge as\r\nthe foundress of the Margaret Professorships, and of Christ College in\r\nCambridge, bore three Daisies on a green turf.\r\n\r\nTo entomologists the Daisy is interesting as an attractive flower to\r\ninsects; for \"it is visited by nine hymenoptera, thirteen diptera, three\r\ncoleoptera, and two lepidoptera--namely, the least meadow-brown and the\r\ncommon blue butterflies.\"[377:1]\r\n\r\nIn medicine, I am afraid, the Daisy has so lost its virtues that it has\r\nno place in the modern pharmacopœia: but in old days it was not so.\r\nCoghan says \"of Deysies, they are used to be given in potions in\r\nfractures of the head and deep wounds of the breast. And this experience\r\nI have of them, that the juyce of the leaves and rootes of Deysies being\r\nput into the nosethrils purgeth the brain; they are good to be used in\r\npottage.\"[377:2] Gerard says, \"the Daisies do mitigate all kinds of\r\npaines, especially in the joints, and gout proceeding from a hot or dry\r\nhumoure, if they be stamped with new butter, unsalted, and applied upon\r\nthe pained place.\" Nor was this all. In those days, doctors prescribed\r\naccording to the so-called \"doctrines of signatures,\" _i.e._, it was\r\nsupposed that Nature had shown, by special marks, for what special\r\ndisease each plant was useful; and so in the humble growth of the little\r\nlow-growing Daisy the doctors read its uses, and here they are. \"It is\r\nsaid that the roots thereof being boyled in milk, and given to little\r\npuppies, will not suffer them to grow great.\"--COLE'S _Adam in Eden_.\r\nOne more virtue. Miss Pratt says that \"an author, writing in 1696, tells\r\nus that they who wish to have pleasant dreams of the loved and absent,\r\nshould put 'Dazy roots under their pillow.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the English language, the Daisy has had little influence, though some\r\nhave derived \"lackadaisy\" and \"lackadaisical\" from the Daisy, but there\r\nis, certainly, no connection between the words. Daisy, however, was\r\n(and, perhaps, still is) a provincial adjective in the eastern counties.\r\nA writer in \"Notes and Queries\" (2nd Series, ix. 261) says that Samuel\r\nParkis, in a letter to George Chalmers, dated February 16, 1799, notices\r\nthe following provincialisms: \"Daisy: remarkable, extraordinary\r\nexcellent, as 'She's a Daisy lass to work,' _i.e._, 'She is a good\r\nworking girl.' 'I'm a Daisy body for pudding,' _i.e._, 'I eat a great\r\ndeal of pudding.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd I must not leave the Daisy without noticing one special charm, that\r\nit is peculiarly the flower of childhood. The Daisy is one of the few\r\nflowers of which the child may pick any quantity without fear of\r\nscolding from the surliest gardener. It is to the child the herald of\r\nspring, when it can set its little foot on six at once, and it readily\r\nlends itself to the delightful manufacture of Daisy chains.\r\n\r\n     \"In the spring and play-time of the year,\r\n      . . . . the little ones, a sportive team,\r\n      Gather king-cups in the yellow mead,\r\n      And prank their hair with Daisies.\"--COWPER.\r\n\r\nIt is then the special flower of childhood, but we cannot entirely give\r\nit up to our children. And I have tried to show you that the humble\r\nDaisy has been the delight of many noble minds, and may be a fit subject\r\nof study even for those children of a larger growth who form the \"Bath\r\nField Club.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[362:1] \"In the curious Treatise of the Virtues of Herbs, Royal MS. 18,\r\na. vi, fol. 72 b, is mentioned: 'Brysewort, or Bonwort, or Daysye,\r\n_consolida minor_, good to breke bocches.'\"--_Promptorium Parvulorum_,\r\np. 52, note. See also a good note on the same word in \"Babee's Book,\" p.\r\n185.\r\n\r\n[366:1] This is the general interpretation, but \"decking prime\" may mean\r\nthe ornament of spring.\r\n\r\n[370:1] This statement has been objected to, but I retain it, because in\r\nspeaking of a meadow, I mean what is called a meadow in the south of\r\nEngland, a lowland, and often irrigated, pasture. In such a meadow\r\nDaisies have no place. In the North the word is more loosely used for\r\nany pasture, but in the South the distinction is so closely drawn that\r\nhay dealers make a great difference in their prices for \"upland\" or\r\n\"meadow hay.\"\r\n\r\n[372:1] \"Modern Painters,\" vol. ii. p. 186.\r\n\r\n[374:1] In the \"Cornhill Magazine\" for January, 1878, is a pleasant\r\npaper on \"Dissecting a Daisy,\" treating a little of the Daisy, but still\r\nmore of the pleasures that a Daisy gives to different people, and the\r\ndifferent reasons for the different sorts of pleasure.

The subject is so\r\nclosely connected with the \"Plant-lore of Shakespeare,\" that I add it as\r\nan Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASONS OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this paper I do not propose to make any exhaustive inquiry into the\r\nseasons of Shakespeare's plays, but (at Mr. Furnivall's suggestion) I\r\nhave tried to find out whether in any case the season that was in the\r\npoet's mind can be discovered by the flowers or fruits, or whether,\r\nwhere the season is otherwise indicated, the flowers and fruits are in\r\naccordance. In other words, my inquiry is simply confined to the\r\nargument, if any, that may be derived from the flowers and fruits,\r\nleaving out of the question all other indications of the seasons.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the inquiry is, what plants or flowers are mentioned\r\nin each play?

rush.\r\n\r\nThis I believe to be a complete list of the flowers of Shakespeare\r\narranged according to the plays, and they are mentioned in one of three\r\nways--first, adjectively, as \"flaxen was his pole,\" \"hawthorn-brake,\"\r\n\"barley-broth,\" \"thou honeysuckle villain,\" \"onion-eyed,\"\r\n\"cowslip-cheeks,\" but the instances of this use by Shakespeare are not\r\nmany; second, proverbially or comparatively, as \"tremble like aspen,\"\r\n\"we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted,\" \"the stinking\r\nelder, grief,\" \"thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,\" \"not worth a\r\ngooseberry.\" There are numberless instances of this use of the names of\r\nflowers, fruits, and trees, but neither of these uses give any\r\nindication of the seasons; and in one or other of these ways they are\r\nused (and only in these ways) in the following plays:--_Tempest_, _Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona_, _Measure for Measure_, _Merchant of Venice_, _As\r\nYou Like It_, _Taming of the Shrew_, _Comedy of Errors_, _Macbeth_,\r\n_King John_, _1st Henry IV._, _2nd Henry VI._, _3rd Henry VI._, _Henry\r\nVIII._, _Troilus and Cressida_, _Coriolanus_, _Julius Cæsar_,\r\n_Pericles_, _Othello_. These therefore may be dismissed at once. There\r\nremain the following plays in which indications of the seasons intended\r\neither in the whole play or in the particular act may be traced. In some\r\ncases the traces are exceedingly slight (almost none at all); in others\r\nthey are so strongly marked that there is little doubt that Shakespeare\r\nused them of set purpose and carefully:--_Merry Wives_, _Twelfth Night_,\r\n_Much Ado_, _Midsummer Night's Dream_, _Love's Labour's Lost_, _As You\r\nLike It_, _All's Well_, _Winter's Tale_, _Richard II._, _1st Henry IV._,\r\n_Henry V._, _2nd Henry VI._, _Richard III._, _Timon of Athens_, _Antony\r\nand Cleopatra_, _Cymbeline_, _Titus Andronicus_, _Romeo and Juliet_,\r\n_King Lear_, _Hamlet_, and _Two Noble Kinsmen_.\r\n\r\n_Merry Wives._ Herne's oak gives the season intended--\r\n\r\n                          \"Herne the hunter,\r\n     Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,\r\n     Doth _all the winter time_ at still midnight\r\n     Walk round about an oak with ragged horns.\"\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare really meant to place the scene in mid-winter, there may\r\nbe a fitness in Mrs. Quickly's looking forward to \"a posset at night, at\r\nthe latter end of a sea-coal fire,\" for it was a \"raw rheumatick day\"\r\n(act iii, sc. 1), in Pistol's--\r\n\r\n     \"Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing,\"\r\n\r\nin Ford's \"birding\" and \"hawking,\" and in the concluding words--\r\n\r\n                             \"Let us every one go home,\r\n     And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire\" (act v, sc. 5);\r\n\r\nbut it is not in accordance with the literature of the day to have\r\nfairies dancing at midnight in the depth of winter.\r\n\r\n_Twelfth Night._ We know that the whole of this play occupies but a few\r\ndays, and is chiefly \"matter for a May morning.\" This gives emphasis to\r\nOlivia's oath, \"By the roses of the Spring . . . I love thee so\" (act\r\nii, sc. 4).\r\n\r\n_Much Ado._ The season must be summer. There is the sitting out of doors\r\nin the \"still evening, hushed on purpose to grace harmony;\" and it is\r\nthe time of year for the full leafage when Beatrice might\r\n\r\n           \"Steal into the pleached bower,\r\n     Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,\r\n     Forbid the sun to enter\" (act iii, sc. 1).\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Night's Dream._ The name marks the season, and there is a\r\nprofusion of flowers to mark it too. It may seem strange to us to have\r\n\"Apricocks\" at the end of June, but in speaking of the seasons of\r\nShakespeare and others it should be remembered that their days were\r\ntwelve days later than ours of the same names; and if to this is added\r\nthe variation of a fortnight or three weeks, which may occur in any\r\nseason in the ripening of a fruit, \"apricocks\" might well be sometimes\r\ngathered on their Midsummer day. But I do not think even this elasticity\r\nwill allow for the ripening of mulberries and purple grapes at that\r\ntime, and scarcely of figs. The scene, however, being laid in Athens and\r\nin fairyland, must not be too minutely criticized in this respect. But\r\nwith the English plants the time is more accurately observed. There is\r\nthe \"_green_ corn;\" the \"dewberries,\" which in a forward season may be\r\ngathered early in July; the \"lush woodbine\" in the fulness of its\r\nlushness at that time; the pansies, or \"love-in-idleness,\" which (says\r\nGerard) \"flower not onely in the spring, but for the most part all\r\nsommer thorowe, even untill autumne;\" the \"sweet musk-roses and the\r\neglantine,\" also in flower then, though the musk-roses, being rather\r\nlate bloomers, would show more of the \"musk-rose buds\" in which Titania\r\nbid the elves \"kill cankers\" than of the full-blown flower; while the\r\nthistle would be exactly in the state for \"Mounsieur Cobweb\" to \"kill a\r\ngood red-hipped humble bee on the top of it\" to \"bring the honey-bag\" to\r\nBottom. Besides these there are the flowers on the \"bank where the wild\r\nthyme blows; where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\" and I think the\r\ndistinction worth noting between the \"_blowing_\" of the wild thyme,\r\nwhich would then be at its fullest, and the \"_growing_\" of the oxlips\r\nand the violet, which had passed their time of blowing, but the living\r\nplants continued \"growing.\"[386:1]\r\n\r\n_Love's Labour's Lost._ The general tone of the play points to the full\r\nsummer, the very time when we should expect to find Boyet thinking \"to\r\nclose his eyes some half an hour under the cool shade of a sycamore\"\r\n(act v, sc. 2).\r\n\r\n_All's Well that Ends Well._ There is a pleasant note of the season in--\r\n\r\n     \"The time will bring on summer,\r\n      When briars will have leaves as well as thorns,\r\n      And be as sweet as sharp\" (act iv, sc. 4);\r\n\r\nbut probably that is only a proverbial expression of hopefulness, and\r\ncannot be pushed further.\r\n\r\n_Winter's Tale._ There seems some little confusion in the season of the\r\nfourth act--the feast for the sheep-shearing, which is in the very\r\nbeginning of summer--yet Perdita dates the season as \"the year growing\r\nancient\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Nor yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\r\n      Of trembling winter\"--\r\n\r\nand gives Camillo the \"flowers of middle summer.\" The flowers named are\r\nall summer flowers; carnations or gilliflowers, lavender, mints, savory,\r\nmarjoram, and marigold.\r\n\r\n_Richard II._ There are several marked and well-known dates in this\r\nplay, but they are not much marked by the flowers. The intended combat\r\nwas on St. Lambert's day (17th Sept.), but there is no allusion to\r\nautumn flowers. In act iii, sc. 3, which we know must be placed in\r\nAugust, there is, besides the mention of the summer dust, King Richard's\r\nsad strain--\r\n\r\n     \"Our sighs, and they (tears) shall lodge the summer corn,\"\r\n\r\nand in the same act we have the gardener's orders to trim the rank\r\nsummer growth of the \"dangling apricocks,\" while in the last act, which\r\nmust be some months later, we have the Duke of York speaking of \"this\r\nnew spring of time,\" and the Duchess asking--\r\n\r\n                            \"Who are the violets now\r\n     That strew the green lap of the new-come spring?\"\r\n\r\nand though in both cases the words may be used proverbially, yet it\r\nseems also probable that they may have been suggested by the time of\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_2nd Henry IV._ There is one flower-note in act ii, sc. 4, where the\r\nHostess says to Falstaff, \"Fare thee well! I have known thee these\r\ntwenty-five years come peascod time,\" of which it can only be said that\r\nit must have been spoken at some other time than the summer.\r\n\r\n_Henry V._ The exact season of act v, sc. 1, is fixed by St. David's day\r\n(March 1) and the leek.\r\n\r\n_1st Henry VI._ The scene in the Temple gardens (act ii, sc. 4), where\r\nall turned on the colour of the roses, must have been at the season when\r\nthe roses were in full bloom, say June.\r\n\r\n_Richard III._ Here too the season of act ii, sc. 4, is fixed by the\r\nripe strawberries brought by the Bishop of Ely to Richard. The exact\r\ndate is known to be June 13, 1483.\r\n\r\n_Timon of Athens._ An approximate season for act iv, sc. 3, might be\r\nguessed from the medlar offered by Apemantus to Timon. Our medlars are\r\nripe in November.\r\n\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra._ The figs and fig-leaves brought to Cleopatra\r\ngive a slight indication of the season of act v.[388:1]\r\n\r\n_Cymbeline._ Here there is a more distinct plant-note of the season of\r\nact i, sc. 3. The queen and her ladies, \"whiles yet the dew's on ground,\r\ngather flowers,\" which at the end of the scene we are told are violets,\r\ncowslips, and primroses, the flowers of the spring. In the fourth act\r\nLucius gives orders to \"find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,\" to\r\nmake a grave for Cloten; but daisies are too long in flower to let us\r\nattempt to fix a date by them.\r\n\r\n_Hamlet._ In this play the season intended is very distinctly marked by\r\nthe flowers. The first act must certainly be some time in the winter,\r\nthough it may be the end of winter or early spring--\"The air bites\r\nshrewdly, it is very cold.\" Then comes an interval of two months or\r\nmore, and Ophelia's madness must be placed in the early summer, _i.e._,\r\nin the end of May or the beginning of June; no other time will all the\r\nflowers mentioned fit, but for that time they are exact. The violets\r\nwere \"all withered;\" but she could pick fennel and columbines, daisies\r\nand pansies in abundance, while the evergreen rosemary and rue (\"which\r\nwe may call Herb of Grace on Sundays\") would be always ready. It was the\r\ntime of year when trees were in their full leafage, and so the \"willow\r\ngrowing aslant the brook would show its hoar leaves in the glassy\r\nstream,\" while its \"slivers,\" would help her in making \"fantastic\r\ngarlands\" \"of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\" or\r\n\"dead men's fingers,\" all of which she would then be able to pick in\r\nabundance in the meadows, but which in a few weeks would be all gone.\r\nPerhaps the time of year may have suggested to Laertes that pretty but\r\nsad address to his sister,\r\n\r\n                    \"O Rose of May!\r\n     Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!\"\r\n\r\n_Titus Andronicus._ There is a plant-note in act ii, sc. 2--\r\n\r\n     \"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,\r\n      O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe.\"\r\n\r\n_Romeo and Juliet._ A slight plant-note of the season may be detected in\r\nthe nightly singing of the nightingale in the pomegranate tree in the\r\nthird act.\r\n\r\n_King Lear._ The plants named point to one season only, the spring. At\r\nno other time could the poor mad king have gone singing aloud,\r\n\r\n     \"Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,\r\n      With harlock, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\r\n      And darnel.\"\r\n\r\nI think this would also be the time for gathering the fresh shoots of\r\nthe samphire; but I do not know this for certain.[389:1]\r\n\r\n_Two Noble Kinsmen._ Here the season is distinctly stated for us by the\r\npoet. The scene is laid in May, and the flowers named are all in\r\naccordance--daffodils, daisies, marigolds, oxlips, primrose, roses, and\r\nthyme.\r\n\r\nI cannot claim any great literary results from this inquiry into the\r\nseasons of Shakespeare as indicated by the flowers named; on the\r\ncontrary, I must confess that the results are exceedingly small--I might\r\nalmost say, none at all--still I do not regret the time and trouble that\r\nthe inquiry has demanded of me. In every literary inquiry the value of\r\nthe research is not to be measured by the visible results. It is\r\nsomething even to find out that there are no results, and so save\r\ntrouble to future inquirers. But in this case the research has not been\r\naltogether in vain. Every addition, however small, to the critical study\r\nof our great Poet has its value; and to myself, as a student of the\r\nNatural History of Shakespeare, the inquiry has been a very pleasant\r\none, because it has confirmed my previous opinion, that even in such\r\ncommon matters as the names of the most familiar every-day plants he\r\ndoes not write in a careless hap-hazard way, naming just the plant that\r\ncomes uppermost in his thoughts, but that they are all named in the most\r\ncareful and correct manner, exactly fitting into the scenes in which\r\nthey are placed, and so giving to each passage a brightness and a\r\nreality which would be entirely wanting if the plants were set down in\r\nthe ignorance of guess-work. Shakespeare knew the plants well; and\r\nthough his knowledge is never paraded, by its very thoroughness it\r\ncannot be hid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[386:1] If \"the rite of May\" (act iv, sc. 1) is to be strictly limited\r\nto May-Day, the title of a \"_Midsummer_ Night's Dream\" does not apply.\r\nThe difficulty can only be met by supposing the scene to be laid at any\r\nnight in May, even in the last night, which would coincide with our 12th\r\nof June.\r\n\r\n[388:1] \"The Alexandrine figs are of the black kind having a white rift\r\nor Chanifre, and are surnamed Delicate. . . . Certain figs there be,\r\nwhich are both early and also lateward; . . . . they are ripe first in\r\nharvest, and afterwards in time of vintage; . . . . also some there be\r\nwhich beare thrice a year\" (Pliny, _Nat. Hist._ b. xv., c. 18, P.\r\nHolland's translation, 1601).\r\n\r\n[389:1] The objection to fixing the date of the play in spring is that\r\nCordelia bids search to be made for Lear \"in every acre of the\r\nhigh-grown field.\" If this can only refer to a field of corn at its full\r\ngrowth, there is a confusion of seasons. But if the larger meaning is\r\ngiven to \"field,\" which it bears in \"flowers of the field,\" \"beasts of\r\nthe field,\" the confusion is avoided. The words would then refer to the\r\nwild overgrowth of an open country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n_NAMES OF PLANTS._\r\n\r\n     _Juliet._\r\n\r\n     What's in a name? That which we call a Rose\r\n     By any other name would smell as sweet.\r\n\r\n                               _Romeo and Juliet_, act ii, sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding that many are interested in the old names of the plants named by\r\nShakespeare, I give in this appendix the names of the plants, showing at\r\none view how they were written and explained by different writers in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The list might have been very largely\r\nincreased, especially by giving the forms used at an earlier date, but\r\nmy object is to show the forms of the names in which they were (or might\r\nhave been) familiar to Shakespeare. The authors quoted are these:\r\n\r\n     1440. \"Promptorium Parvulorum.\"\r\n     1483. \"Catholicon Anglicum.\"\r\n     1548. Turner's \"Names of Herbes,\" and \"Herbal,\" 1568.\r\n     1597.

FRANCIS FOSTER.\r\n\r\nPress Notices.\r\n\r\n\"In this pleasant and original little book the authoress not only enters\r\na vigorous protest against the bedding-out system and the so-called\r\n'natural' style of gardening, but gives very good practical advice for\r\ngardens of a different sort.\"--_Gardener's Chronicle._\r\n\r\n\"This little book proceeds from a true lover of flowers and\r\nwill be welcome to all who take an interest in their care and\r\nculture.\"--_Civilian._\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant and unpretending little volume.\"--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n\"The charm consists in its author's evident love of her subject. Like a\r\ntrue lover she has gone far and wide in her search for old plants and\r\nold plant lore. We agree with Mrs. Foster that the most perfect\r\nherbaceous border is one that has an old wall behind it. Blue larkspurs\r\nand white lilies, roses, phloxes, and evening primroses never look so\r\nwell as when they are seen against a background of wall, mellowed\r\nwith age and clothed with its beautiful garment of wall-growing\r\nseedlings. . . . Mrs. Foster's book, too, is most useful in its lists of\r\nflowers that bloomed in the days of Chaucer and Shakespeare. She also\r\ndevotes one chapter entirely to quotations from old poets on gardens and\r\nall the delights that spring from them. If it helps her readers to know\r\nfor themselves those authors, who found among the flowers of the garden\r\napt similes of all that is truest in human nature, she will have added a\r\nvery substantial addition to the pleasure already enjoyed by those who\r\nlove gardens, but yet are unfamiliar with the pages of the poets who\r\nknew well how to speak their praises.\"--_Spectator._\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant book.\"--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo, cloth.
